<p>時評</p>
<h3>英工黨政府與保守黨</h3>
<p>近來各國政府與反對黨之爭。除法内閣易倒外他若德國之白魯甯内閣日本之濱口内閣英國之工黨内閣雖皆處反對黨循環攻擊之中。而終能勉力支撑者各有一種特殊之能力與手段也即以英工黨内閣言之反對政府之保守黨可謂百出其方法以推倒之矣。而工黨首領之麥克唐納卒未爲所屈者以麥應付之步驟不亂主張堅定而不爲衆說所摇也。反對黨先以攻擊政府經濟政策。政府以辭職。無效則進而以逼成總選舉。使陷政府於難局。以爲工黨政府。必將無法應付。然而麥氏亦早已自爲地步對於經濟政策之攻擊則益努力於經濟狀况之改善。聲言非遇彈劾案失敗。决不自行辭職。對於總選舉則一方面設法避免决定非至萬不得已决不陷於總選舉窮境之中。一方面提出改良選舉法案。以爲即使辦理選舉。亦可免保守黨以少數選舉人而得下院多數議席之前例。蓋保守黨之逼成選舉。仍欲以前法恢復政權。故麥氏爲此預防之政策也。可知工黨政府對付反對黨之作戰計劃。亦自步步留神。壁壘嚴整勿予人以深入重地之隙。其手段自非反對黨所能及。故雖屢遇危局而恒能轉危爲安者。以是故也。</p>

<h3>市敎育局長徐佩璜補行宣誓就職</h3>
<p>上海敎育局長徐佩璜氏、自經國府正式任命、已經一月有餘、昨日上午十時、在局補行宣誓就職禮、</p>
<p>▲到會人物救育部特派代表顧樹森監誓、市長張岳軍氏亦親臨致訓、此外到市黨部代表童行白市府秘書長俞鴻鈞、中委褚民誼、大學校長胡庶華黎照寰王景岐劉湛恩褚輔成歐元懷、市府參事秘書科長及各局局長及各校校長各機關代表來賓、凡四百餘人濟濟一堂、頗極盛况、主席張市長、紀録姚賡夔陳端志、</p>
<p>▲典禮秩序（一）全體肅立（二）唱黨歌、（三）向黨國旗及總理遺像行三鞠躬禮、（四）主席恭讀總理遺囑、（五）監誓長官就位、局長就位、（六）市長授印、局長授印、（七）局長宣誓、（八）監誓長官致訓詞（九）來賓演說（十）局長答詞（十）（一）攝影、（十）（二）禮成茶點、</p>
<p>▲敎部顧蔭亭訓辭略謂「本人代表敎育部參加徐局長就職典禮、非常榮幸上海爲全國最大部市各種設施、均足引起中外之注意、故上海敎育不特爲全國之中樞、即在全世界亦當有相當地位、按之敎育原理、大都會之敎育、有異於尋常都會或鄉村之敎育、第一應注意兒童之身心、因大都會産業之突進社會、亦隨之而變遷、苟不周密計劃、往往入於歧途、歐美各大都會、對於社會敎育、莫不致以全力者、即以此耳、試以芝加哥論全市設小學公共運動場七十餘處、其他若小公園小圖書館游泳池等莫不徧於全市、蓋欲使身心旺盛之兒童、於受學校敎育以外、再行導入公共場所以訓練之可免、一　十寒之弊、其次除設施普通敎育外、更須注意於特殊敎育、天才兒童直注意低、能兒童亦宜注意、因混合施敎、各蒙其害也、其次普通學校、咸宜注意職業訓練、使畢業以後、可以應付都市生活、尤其要者、則實施三民主義敎育、將總理遺敎溶化於各科敎材、以冀造成中心思想至若整頓私校以敎育宣傳反動思想者或以敎育爲營業目的者、均當取締、總之辦理上海敎育一方、須應世界潮流、一方須　特殊環境、徐局長向在敎育界服務、又在市府供職多年、對於今後上海敎育必有努力之貢獻」云云、</p>
<p>▲張市長訓詞略謂「本人對於敎育、很少經驗不過每次參加本黨各種大會、總看到各項提案及宣言之中、有謂多關於敎育的提案、這可以見得中央對敎育的重視了、還記得本黨三次全國代表大會的政治報告中、有關於敎育的一段話、很切中時弊的說、現代的敎育界中、無論是學生敎員、主持校務者及行政人員、個個人都感覺不滿意、行政人員不滿於主持校務者、主持校務者不滿於敎員、敎員不滿於學生、學生不滿於學校學校不滿於行政人員、在這種上下交相不滿的局中、敎育事業的效果就不能得見了、原來在今日的環境下、舊的文化基礎、已經崩潰、新的文化基礎、尚未建立、敎育事業發現了「六難」、行政難經費難、辦學難、敎員難、讀書雖、升學難、無一不難、因之、逐有「四惡」、一是敎育成爲私人的工具、二是敎育的結果非但不能造就人才而且埋没人才三是辦理學校的結果非但不能提高讀書慾望、而且可以無須讀書、四是爲社曾多造了些失業分利的人使國家元氣大大的喪失、又因四惡而發生「三害」害個人害社會、害國家、這麽說來要弄成怎樣一個結果呢雖然這不是說個個學校、都如此不過這也夠使我們警惕的了、所以三全大會議决、確定以三民主義爲我國惟一的敎育宗旨根本問題、就在於把三民主義的文化建立起來而後才可以促進民族的繁榮、民權的普遍、民生的建設、得到了具體的功效、所以今天我就把此意爲貢獻、希望徐局長能依着這個方針來促進本市的敎育、徐局長在市府服務多年、在敎育界亦素有成績、來長敎局必能恪遵誓詞、努力實現三民主義的敎育」云云、</p>
<p>▲來賓演說市黨部代表童行白氏致辭、略謂「本市幅員廣大希望徐局長主意整個的發展、尤須重視鄉村敎育及勞工敎育」云云、次因胡庶華褚輔成王雲王諸氏演說、辭長從略、</p>
<p>▲徐局長答詞佩璜受市長特達之知奉國府之任命、來任上海市敎育局局長、今日宣誓就職蒙敎育部代表及市長蒞臨監視致訓、又承上海市黨部代表曁其他各機關代表來賓等賜敎、詞周情摯、所垂敎於佩璜者甚渥、而所期望於佩璜中亦甚厚、　璜敬聆之餘、且感且慚、重以此處會堂狹小、招待不周、諸多簡慢、尤深抱歉、佩璜兹謹以至誠接受諸位訓詞、誓以全力遵循、切實奉行、並將佩璜對於本市敎育所抱發展計畫略陳於諸君之前、尚希指正賜敎（一）本局當前最切要之一部分工作、厥在整理現有事業、本局三年半以來長官屢易、雖局務年有進展、而效能之淺薄與夫頭緒之紛亂、亦無庸諱言、整理之方、厥在提綱挈領、、所謂「振衣者、必提其領、舉目者必挈其綱、」綜計現在進行者、計有數端如下、</p>
<p>甲·「本局與附屬機關之敏捷聯絡、」本局附屬機關、即以市立中小學校及民衆學校等機關而論、已有二百九十餘所之多、以前關係散漫、聯絡甚少、平時除公事外、殊少來往佩璜現正力求改善、務使局之與校如家庭之與子弟、日臻親洽、以期遇有事故、如手之使臂、臂之使指、息息相關、無復睽隔之虞如古人所謂「堂高簾遠者、務使其絶對不復存」在本局本此意旨、除增加視察外務使各附屬機關主管人員及校長、多與局中各職員見面聚談、以期溝通聲氣一破從前隔膜之象、而辦事方面、亦力求其迅捷、使事無不達、案無擱置、</p>
<p>乙·「各項事業之成績考核」凡百事業貴有專成、藉知事業處理之當否與夫處理事業成績之高下、以事業言、斯可以舉爲楷模、以處理事業者言、亦可以資爲　懲考核之爲用固非僅爲消極之警惕、而實爲積極之率導也、本局事業甚緊、職務尤重佩璜視事業之開展、爲惟一之責任、竊抱爲事擇人之旨、使事業集中其力量而增厚其效能無廢才、斯無廢事、無廢事、始得速其成功、本局現於各種業務、胥本此宗旨而行或可一洗泄泄沓沓之弊乎、</p>
<p>丙·「增高局内外辦事效率」各種事業辦理之效率、高則事半而功倍、且用人少而費省、辦理之效率低則事倍而功半且用人多而費巨、然欲增高效率不外乎由在上者督率、提倡勸懲有方、由在下者各自努力、視公如私本局現在並本此旨、以期提高局内外辦事效率、即如頃間所述各項事業之成績考核、亦即以提高效率目的者也、</p>
<p>丁·「一切事業務使適合規章」規章之設、本在使人有所遵循作業、有制有一定之標準而可免紊亂之弊、若有規章而不遵循、則規章等於虚設且辦事不循軌道、必致失其效果、不但不合科學管理之法、且不適於現今世界潮流、何况工作效率、亦必因此减低、適與提高效率之旨背道而馳、是以本局此後務令事事悉遵規章、蓋規章如模型、工作如未製之器皿務使製成之器皿、悉與模型相合、無異其有規章不合事理者、應設法改　之、而不應有所違背、本局嚴守此意、必求事事悉上執道而後已總之、關於局内外工作方面、務使一分經費、有一分之效用、而本局所辦學校所有事業、均爲合理化合科學化之學校、與事業庶不負付託之重與期望之殷也、</p>
<p>（二）除整理工作外已在進行或最近應着手辦理者、亦有數端、</p>
<p>甲·「關於一般敎育者」黨國至大基礎、首重敎育、四日全會後中央對於改進全國敎育、尤爲注意上海爲全國敎育之重心、亟應遵照中央意旨之敎育宗旨、亦經政府及市府期望、實現各項計劃及事務</p>
<p>（一）使三民主義貫澈全市敎育三民主義爲總理一生革命救國之結晶品、無可不包、無所不容、而三民主義之敎育宗旨亦經政府確定爲奉行敎育事業惟一之目標、然徒托空言難有效果苟不認識主義之眞精神、則主義决不能實現、敎育界經先覺覺人之職、尤應以三民主義爲中心信仰、以身作則促其實現、使敎者學者皆能確切信仰、以身實踐俾能一致努力於三民主義敎育之建設、蓋辦理本市敎育事業者、而人人皆能有三民主義之中心信仰、則本市敎育事業始能有偉大開展蓋必能自身實行者、始能負此深重之職責、而領導學生庶幾可求學風之整飭、而庶幾可令學校爲一有主義有秩序有條理之訓練所也、故本局現在對於一般敎育首在貫注三民主義總理遺敎、此在本局視爲最切要之工作、至此外並應注重者、</p>
<p>（二）、科學敎育總理遵敎之中、煌煌貽示我人仿效西法非學其政治文章風俗等等、而在學其科學、蓋世界一切文明、人生幸福增進、莫不導源於科學之發達惟科學爲最適實用、不尚空談、且以科學之法辦理事業、均必有秩序、有計劃、有組織非紛亂無緒、隨時補苴塞漏者可比故本局以後於一般敎育、尤務注重科學敎育、據近來調查、日本敎育者所言日本敎育最注力於科學、其敎學經費以用於科學設備者佔最大部分、比之吾國、則我國大學之科學敎育設備、尚上海市敎育局長徐佩璜補行宣誓就職之影（王開攝）</p>
<p>不及彼中學校之設備吾國中學校之設備、尚不及彼小學校之設備、至於吾國小學、更不足論矣豈不可憐、是以本局三民主義敎育以外、首注重科學敎育、務使各學校科學敎育、設備逐漸添置完全即小學校畢業生、亦人人有普通科學之智識此不但最足增高國民常識、且於提高國人工民程度、亦最有裨不淺、</p>
<p>（三）義務敎育義務敎育、關係國家生命民族存亡吾國不識字之國民總在百分之九十以上因此民智固陋民力薄弱、不但萬不足與歐美日本抗衡爭雄、即與黨國的建設事業亦實有無限障阻、故四中全會對於義務敎育極爲重視誠爲扼要之圖、上海敎育雖比其他各處、較爲發達但全市入學學齡兒童據調查所得尚不及半數、則義務敎育之推行豈容緩視、然欲使全市敎育普及非經濟充裕、决難實現、即有經費而欲覓許多師資以期辦理有效、亦多困難、故擬遵照四中全會意旨、在以前已經呈請敎育部及市府核准之陸行區、先行試辦義務敎育將來逐漸推及全市各區、</p>
<p>（四）體育我國積弱已久、體育之不發達實爲一因、本市體育事業年來頗有開展、然竊猶以爲未足者則佩　深覺過往之體育事業忙編重於中中等學校以上之學生、此後當力求其普徧、並即以小學校爲基本鍛鍊之所、故本局對於體育場之擴充及其他體育事業之舉辦、已在積極籌劃之中也</p>
<p>乙關於社會敎育社會敎育、在增高民智涵養道德養成良好之公民、以提高社會程度、其性質與義務敎育相似、然義務敎育僅限於已屆學齡之兒童而社會敎育則實爲大衆敎育故其影響效果尤深且大、本局現籌辦三事、（一）擬於十九年度内經詳細計劃後、於二十年度起改組各民衆學校及補習學校、且設法擴充之、以爲推行義務敎育之助（二）市民娱樂場所甚爲緊要四中全會已有議决案、交國府敎育部切實執行、故本局對於籌設美術館音樂廳圖書館博物院動物園、已在文廟積極進行、惟本局財力能力、均屬有限、深盼政府及各界予以援助俾得早觀厥成、（三）電影爲社會敎育最大之輔助品、然用之不善、亦可成爲最大之害、近來傷風敗俗與違法犯禁之事日多一日其原因雖不止一端、而電影片之感化亦未嘗不有極大之影響、本局鑒於此以職責所在、萬不容坐視其横流潰决、故在積極改良方面、擬訂定攝製社會敎育影片規則、並請市府及中央規定奬勵辦法、而在消極取締方面、擬會同有關係各局嚴厲制止不良之中外影片或抽剪之、</p>
<p>此外尚有二點、本局亦在進行辦理、爲本局政策之一部、</p>
<p>（一）奬勵及取締私立學校上海學齡兒童旣如此之多、而市庫經費有限、不能多設學校以收容之、自不得不有賴於私立學校以爲之助而補市校之不及、故本局對於私校之辦理有成績者、擬訂奬勵辦法、使益知所奮勉其尚未立案者、督促其改良立案、使能在一貫之敎育行政系統下、共同努力其有藉學歛錢辦理腐敗者則不得不取締之、俾社會不致受其貽害庶幾在積極方面、可以减少文盲之數而在消極方面、亦可以撲滅貽誤青年之禍坑、</p>
<p>（二）收回租界敎育權關於租界敎育權、本局極爲重視現在公共租界全年收入經費較市府大至三倍、而華童敎育經費極少而且所辦學校、亦不遵照中國敎育法令、法租界亦然租界當局如此輕視華人敎育、蔑視中國主權本局職責所在、决不能漠視不問、現擬積極交涉、不達收回目的不止、</p>
<p>以上數端爲本局事業進行計畫大綱、現先訂定此政策綱目以後即當一一按序進行、或同時兼程並進務求一一實現、不但爲佩璜改善發展上海敎育之大願、而且亦冀有以慰中央·市政府·以及各界人士與社會殷殷之期望、今日承諸君聯袂光臨不勝榮幸之至用貢數言、以爲將來本局工作進行左劵尚希時加賜敎爲幸、</p>

<h3>平漢路之武勝關函洞譚愼餘</h3>
<p>武勝關屬於湖北之應山縣。與河南交界。崗嶺疊複。形勢險要。前清建築平漢鐵路時。因山高不易削平。遂鑿孔道通於其間。孔長十六里有餘。車行需時十五分方能通過。凡曾往來於平漢路之旅客。莫不知武勝關之有函洞也。惟是函洞之設。本爲便利交通。庸詎知其中不知枉死若干無辜小民。蓋民國以來。戰爭迭見。而戰地人民。受害尤烈。因欲逃往他鄉避難。多以搭乘火車爲便。然戰時鐵路運輸兵車運不暇。何來客車之可乘。是以每一火車站上。難民之候車者。觸目皆是。每有兵車經過。則爭往上車。然車廂之中。固不能容若輩插足。於是弱者飮泣痛恨。强者則攀上車頂。因急於逃難之故。雖由武裝軍警嚴加阻止。亦不聽也（平漢路之火車站。未設栅欄。可自由出入。不若京滬路之稍有秩序。故軍警實無法禁止）。車頂之上。類多圓滑。車行時因震蕩之故。其不墮下者幾希。而武勝關之函洞。旣爲人工鑿成。當然不甚高大。僅能容車身之經過。車頂上實不能再加何物。以是火車開至武勝關時。車頂難民。不知函洞之危險。坐其上者。立觸函洞上之岩石而墮下。不死於傷。亦必爲火車所碾斃。</p>
<h3>中國最貴之書潘世珠</h3>
<p>一部值價十萬元</p>
<p>世綵堂韓昌黎及柳河東二集。爲宋版孤本之一。素爲收藏家所重視。蓋世綵堂所用紙張。質地匀結。復經浸以椒水。故歷數百年猶無蟲蛀之患。且所刻之字。有唐人風味。益爲人所愛重。現韓集在海源閣楊氏處。柳集則在海上粤人潘明訓處。去年楊氏後人將海源閣精本廿六種運至天津。韓集亦其中之一。且有出售之意。潘氏爲求全璧計。且不欲寳籍流入日人手中。曾向楊氏後人接洽購買韓集一部。而楊氏云非十萬元不肯脫手。蓋此書價值實足相稱也。現以價格相差過遠。接洽停頓。今不知此書已出售否。但望不致流入日人手中。爲可幸耳。外間曾一度傳說。謂有人擬以二十萬元購其全部廿六種。爲中國保存國粹。用意甚善。但恐無此便宜也。（却酬）</p>
<p>當十八年討馮時。有河南難民劉姓者。全家大小五口。欲逃往漢口避難。由信陽車站攀上某軍兵車車頂。車至武勝關時。全家五口。觸於函洞岩石而墮下者三人。僅餘年約五六十歲之老人。及其十餘齡之孫女。未遭此刧。蓋因伏身車頂之故。否則亦必同歸於盡。此事豫卾之人多能道之者。予前曾服務軍界。討唐之役。亦在前方工作。凱旋後隨隊乘車開回武漢。路過武勝關時。因欲探視函洞情形。特將電筒隨身携帶。車初入洞時。（此時係白晝）烟霧滿罩車廂。此爲機車上散出之煤氣。入洞後則頓成黑暗世界。對面亦不能見人。繼覺臭氣難聞。於是將電筒由車窗照視。則纍纍者皆斷頭折肢之枯骨。發臭者乃腐爛未久之屍體。其數雖無人調查。一瞬視間。已有十餘具之多。則歷年以來無辜小民因兵災避難之葬身於此函洞中者。實不知有若干人也。悲夫。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>贛省匪患紀聞政</h3>
<p>年來湘贛匪之熾。實爲亘古所未有。贛省七十餘縣。而今之省府政令能及。僅十餘縣。民衆所受之蹂躪與茶毒。實難盡述。有友近自贛來。爲道一二。因捉筆記之。</p>
<p>▲戰壕中抛人頭匪方之唯一政策。即爲殺人放火。故關於殺人一事。有專隊司之。偶與軍隊對壘。則以人頭數百。遥擲對方。軍隊見之。無不震駭。其殘忍有如此者。</p>
<p>▲張輝　慘遭毒手南昌衛戍司令兼師長張輝瓚氏。富有韜略。省垣之得保持者。實賴張氏之功爲多。乃前者張氏率軍出征。遇難民一隊。詢之則曰。自匪窟逃出者也。因詢以匪方狀况。若輩咸道匪方之空虚。以爲如未乘勝追擊。不難一鼓而殲。張氏信以爲眞。於是親率營餘士卒開出。孰知匪徒誘令深入。旋即加以包圍。張及二旅長均被執。方悟適間之難民。皆匪黨也。匪旣執張氏。乃付諸所謂人民公判。結果慘遭刳肚。而省垣益岌岌矣。</p>
<p>▲礦山被灌友人經營煤礦。每年以出産所得。差足維持。乃匪勢旣張。礦山亦爲匪所據。後即以水灌之。曰。有是礦者。必爲富人。必毁之。於是此數十萬元之礦山。亦隨之而犧牲矣。</p>
<p>▲一門慘殺有鄉人某。家有四子。一日鄉人爲匪架去。判當處死四子聞訊。齊赴匪巢。曰。父年老。請擇吾四人中一人以代之。匪曰善。若輩旣均不畏死。則悉處死可已。遂遭駢戮。嗚呼。人間慘劇。孰有甚於此者乎。</p>
<h3>巴黎物語（二三）六曾寄於巴黎</h3>
<p>植物園内最著名的是他的迷宮Jabyrinthe和科學陳列館。迷宮構造得狠巧妙。使人進去許久還轉不出來。科學陳列館分做幾部分。有動物學部。地質學部。礦物學部等。裡面收藏的標本都極豐富。並且有許多狠珍貴在别處不能見到的東西。</p>
<p>植物園創設於一六二六年。但以前設備狠簡單。直到大博物家兼大文學家蒲豐Buffon來做管理人時。才擴充到現在的模樣。蒲豐管理植物園差不多有五十年之久（１７３９－１７８８）他一生的精力幾全用在他的傑作「自然歷史」HistoireNaturelle和這植物園裡面。現在園内立有他的銅像。並保有他從前住過的房子。</p>
<p>我每次到植物園散步時。常常回想到幾年前在日本念書時。時常去玩的東京小石川植物園。我狠愛小石川植物園的風景。但小石川植物園没有巴黎植物園這樣豐富的科學陳列館。在歐洲見過的幾個植物園中。我覺得比利時京城的植物園和巴黎植物園狠有些相似的地方。但比京植物園比巴黎植物園的規模小得多了。我國有的是空地。並且植物標本的收集也究竟比别的科學標本容易。我希望將來回國時能夠在我們首都見到一個風景極美的植物園。並且附着一個規模極大的博物學陳列館。</p>
<h3>評歌舞劇「不見去年人」黄花</h3>
<p>歐西各國。盛行舞台歌舞劇。所謂Opera者是。此種歌舞劇。並非祗重歌舞。對於劇情之描寫。亦頗着力。返顧吾國歌舞界。因資格之幼稚。經濟之不足。終至心有餘而力不足也。</p>
<p>報章刋載梅花歌舞團新編一非戰歌舞劇曰「不見去年人」者。演於中央、新中央三星等戲院。作Opera之嘗試。因參觀之。考其立意大體爲征人别妻赴戰。及一載後身受重傷歸來。則家破妻亡。去年人不復見矣。傍襯以當夫妻離别時鴻雁成行。歌舞左右。表示人類至不得已時。終有分散之一日。而我等朝夕共處。决不以戰而離羣。人實不如一禽。庽意尚佳。戰事發生。民衆避禍。則頗多穿插。夫呼其妻。女呼其母。老佛婆則始終手棒觀世音。口念阿彌陀等等。尚不出格。滑稽處則一士兵以形隻影單。無人可别。乃持一美人畫像。以自慰藉。結果終棄其畫而與他人爭一麵包。表演失之過火。而立意重於麵包問題。似尚非胡閙。張仙琳女士飾妻子。歌唱時能表出一腔悲哀。但靜止時未能入木三分。黄昏君之軍人。扮相不弱。唱嫌其低。宜力加研究發音之高下。錢鍾秀、徐粲鶯、蔡一鳴、龔秋霞、張綺、翁蘭魂諸女士飾雁三對、歌舞皆能動人興趣。當罪排練一日之功。戰時電光閃爍。音樂尚和諧。一雛型飛機自院頂飛至台上。因燈光之佈置。不覺其可厭。然此不過一種彩頭耳。一言以蔽之。此劇本若再加精密之修正。當有存在之價值。在中國歌舞劇萌芽時代。吾人目光、自應看低三分。願合編是劇之魏縈波蔡問津兩君。努力培植此萌芽。庶中國之舞台歌舞劇。得漸次向光明之路。而前進焉。</p>
<p>ＡＢ君鑒。奉書極感。所指各節。大半正在計劃中。極盼面敎。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三六四）包天笑</h3>
<p>第十七回駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>花元春旣有了這一對心上人後。雖然伊玉體長生。金剛不壞。可也有點兒應接不暇。其餘的客人。便有些兒餘子碌碌。不足齒數了。然而生意是終要做的。你旣然在生意上。堂唱可以不出嗎。客人可以不應酬敷衍嗎。你所喜歡的人。你就不願意他多花錢。那末瘟生阿木林。你不招致幾位。你這個塲面。如何的支持下去呢。照如此說法。你也得騰出空工夫來。將身體來酬報酬報出錢的施主。的確也有一班客人。花錢反而肯花在那班胡調的姑娘身上。以爲那班人浪漫得有趣。倘然規規矩矩。這是良家閨女的排塲。不是娼門妓女的本分。只是花元春是個經濟家。倒也罷了。無奈伊「飛錢只當飛錢用。東手接來西手去。」所以伊後來便弄得像吳稚睴先生說的「皮寛債緊。」債台已是高築。身體也有點淘虚的了。伊所欠的債。那債權人都是上海的幾個老掮洋錢的。就是那班老阿寳。老阿秀之類。看伊這個樣子。覺得永無翻身之日。他們所最希望的是六小姐做着幾個好客人。捲着幾票。不但是他們的本息有着。而且房間裏的下脚洋錢。也可以多擄幾個。不然。第二個希望六小姐嫁着一個有錢的老爺。拿出幾千塊錢來。給伊渾身上下淴一個浴。他們的錢可以撩轉來。一兩年以後。又可以似迷死鬼一般。去迷伊重行出山。不想六小姐專做一班小白臉。而且那種小白臉。又不是少爺們。又不是人家公子哥兒們。他們要勸伊。也勸不醒。他們要阻擋伊。也阻擋不來。做别個客人也做不長。嫁人也就很難。漫說伊一時有所牽掛。不肯嫁人。人家一打聽有這一對帶拉蘇。又誰肯討伊。借給伊的錢。又始終没有法子可以起出來。後來大家商量。說不如攛掇伊出碼頭去吧。現在北京天津一帶。南邊去的姑娘們很多。因爲南邊的老爺們。到北京去做官。他們當然是喜歡南邊姑娘。不喜歡北邊姑娘的。聽說某某人去了。一夜天功夫。就挑了三千塊洋錢的頭。不要說碰伊的身體。連手都没有攙一攙。大人大物。都是很闊氣的。六小姐這一點功架。那是不能算壞。就是被這兩個冤家釘住了。倘然離開了上海。也許賺一票回來也說不定。現在慶餘堂大肚皮阿金。正要到上海來接小姐。我們給伊說說看。</p>

<h3>期荳餅同趨轉堅</h3>

<h3>五金先令風潮重起漲風</h3>
<p>昨日外匯暴變、如先令美金狂跌、東匯猛漲因此五金成本於無形中又抬高不小、各同業爲血本關係互相扳價、因此大市標準重起漲風、法西釘開九兩二錢半、較前加二錢半、英鋼板亦好起錢半、計五釐估出價爲八兩七釐半七兩六錢一分七兩○五分、新鉛絲新路皮亦提加一錢、水門汀又加二錢半、其他若黑鐵皮白鉛皮馬口鐵盤元釘等無一不在升漲訊中、但客帮及廠家生意一時更爲寥落、以致買賣雙方幾在擯持之局、惟外匯此後仍看高貴、則五金前途標準恐尚有再漲之地步云、</p>

<h3>張羣重要談話</h3>
<p>▲日夜銀行清理事件</p>
<p>▲市政府决負責辦理</p>
<p>▲各工廠先派員視察</p>
<p>▲被派入川完全不確</p>
<p>本報記者、昨在市政府、訪晤市長張羣、詢以日夜銀行清理案之善後、及營業稅等各問題、兹述其談話於次、</p>
<p>▲日夜銀行　張氏謂、關於日夜銀行及大世界游覽儲蓄部之清算事件、儲户以勞工婦女爲多、影響於平民生計至巨、實業部及市政府、迭接債權人來呈呼籲、請爲維持處理、近聞儲户方面因而自殺者、已有三五人、情殊可憫、市府自不得袖手旁觀、現决擬負責辦理、爲債權人多謀一分利益、刻正與各方交換意見、熟商一切、預定二三日中、當可决定方針、至辦法大要、爲集合各方關係人、作公開的磋商、規定償還債户辦法、蓋目下最感困難者爲共發公司、及黄楚九之私産、散處公共租界及法租界、若由法公廨辦理、其權力僅及於大世界與日夜銀行總行、且各店一經停業、損失更大、而債權人更蒙重大損失、總之、市政府此舉、係完全爲債權人謀利益、余當盡力而行、務使結果完美也、</p>
<p>▲營業稅率　關於營業稅率問題、張氏謂、現正由市財政委員會、作詳細的研究、俟决定後、再由市府呈中央核辦、總期得有公平處置、至租界方面商民、同爲中國國民、自應有納稅義務、所困難者、租界已徵收類似營業稅之牌照稅、現正加以考慮、萬不致令商民納二重稅也、</p>
<p>▲視察工廠　工廠法及工廠法施行條例、業由國府會議議决展緩至八月一日實行、昨據張市長談稱、全滬工廠約千數百家、不合於工廠法者數百家、第一步當派員逐一前往調查視察、有不合者設法改革、於事前作充分之準備、則臨時不至再有爲難情事、</p>
<p>▲袁良辭職　公安局長袁良呈請辭職、余已將其辭呈轉呈中央、至繼任已内定爲陳希曾氏、余昨已與晤及、俟中央令下、當可正式接任、</p>
<p>▲赴川風傳　記者叩以外傳中央擬派市長赴川、主持川事確否、張答、絶無此事、四川雖爲余之桑梓、但離川日久、諸多隔膜、對川事頗願供獻意見、而不願加入旋渦、有傳戴季陶院長者、中央亦無此擬議、余近努力於市中心區域之建設、五月動工、七月可奠基、深信一人當專力於一事、庶可稍有成就、中央即有陞任之命、余深知才力不勝、勿敢應也、</p>

<p>▲象山設校　象山確爲一天然良港、現海部决先在該處設一海軍學校、其經費預定二三十萬元、一俟建築計畫擬定、即將開始進行、海部現派通濟練習艦在彼計畫、將來學生决由招考入學、不由各艦抽派、人數大概可容三百名、至於築港、問題、兹事體大、其經費又非十萬八萬得以成事、故報傳象山有積極作築之說、尚非其時、何况計畫及經費兩無辦法時乎、</p>
<p>▲改造軍艦　達安廢艦改築告竣、並換名大同後、繼該艦改築者尚有建威、聞建威工程預計三閱月後、可與新下水之逸仙艦、一同落成、建威舊名决意不用、而新名稱已定爲自强二字、至於甫於建築中之民生軍艦、已築有一半工程、在本年三月終、四月初、即能下水、外傳海軍有向外購置新艦之說、係屬訛傳、因海部中並無此事也云云、</p>

<h3>杜妙娟離婚之訟</h3>
<p>▲曾在外一度和解</p>
<p>▲曹勤業無錢應付</p>
<p>▲妙娟戀戀三子女</p>
<p>▲法官殷殷勸團圞</p>
<p>▲已生一子二女　曾任沙田局長之曹讓之、有子曰勤業、現年二十四歲、在日商公大紗廠會計科服務、十四年、娶醫生杜靜仙之女妙娟爲　、彼此同庚、迄已六年、生有兩女一子、二女一爲五歲、一爲四歲、子僅三齡、然彼夫婦之感情、向不十分融洽、而亦非絶對水火、故尚能維持數載、</p>
<p>▲被毆後請離婚　迨至去年二月一日、杜氏被毆受傷後、乃大反目、一面歸甯求醫治療、一面涉訟法庭、旋以和解了結、兹復積不相解、杜氏延徐炳成律師向特區地方法院對曹提起離婚之訴、請求判准離異及追償妝奩生活醫藥等費外、並所生兩女、准原告領回、一子則由被告撫養、此案前經特區法院一度傳審、諭令出外和解、現因和解難以妥協、</p>
<p>▲和解條件凡四　故於昨晨十時由楊推事開第十庭繼續傳訊、原告杜妙娟及代表律師杜靈俊·徐炳成·被告曹勤業·及代表律師瞿鉞·均到庭候訊、開審後、原告律師即稱、原告對於調解、曾提出下列條件、即（一）被告應向原告道歉、（二）被告應負担醫藥費、（三）被告應負子女敎養費責任、（四）原告以後之生活保障等四條、被告如能完全履行、自可回復夫婦感情、繼續同居、</p>
<p>▲推事力勸和解　楊推事即傳問被告曹勤業稱、原告現已提出和解條件、而此四條件、除第二項醫藥費一千二百元外、第一道歉不成問題、第三子女敎養第四以後生活費、彼此旣經同居、你當然須負責任、故你現能給原告一千元即可和解、但曹供渠在紗廠當會計、每月僅四十元、實無力負此千金之數、楊推事又稱、即向親友借凑千元、亦非難事、且彼此旣爲夫婦、千元之欵、雖給原告、實則仍屬於你、須知如果實行離婚、你損失更大、故以本庭之見、仍以和解爲妙、曹供和解固所願、但無力量何、而原告杜妙娟即聲稱、被告實無誠意和解、楊推事問原告、對三四兩條要錢幾何、原告答稱每月須二百元、</p>
<p>▲被告姊丈之言　楊推事又傳被告姊丈邵中道訊問、邵供、被告在紗廠任事、每月僅三十餘元之薪俸、父親已經去世、僅有庶母在堂、父親在日、雖稍有薄産、</p>
<p>但父親去世後、亦已完盡、現在不但無家産、尚虧人八千八百元、又問、原被兩告相打、你是否在塲、邵答、不在塲、事後據說係被告因不能入睡、特至書房閱報、後被原告拒絶房外而起、</p>
<p>▲現欵地産數目　楊推事問杜妙娟、被告究竟有無家産、杜答、出嫁時聞媒人言、有一二十萬家産、嫁後確知被告在法租界金神父路附近置有地産三處、父親在時、並有現欵存在山東銀行、被告反言貧窮、殊難置信、被告聞原告語後、即謂金神父路本有地産、但已賣盡、而山東銀行之存欵、因受該行倒閉之影響、早已化爲烏有、此事可由姊丈邵中道證明、杜妙娟又供、被告進廠時、每月已有三十元、自後每年加薪兩次、現已六年、豈止四十元、</p>
<p>▲願盡獻其所有　程推事至此、又向兩造力勸一番、曹答、庭上之盛意、固甚感謝、但無力量出此千元之數、且彼此原爲夫婦、旣有誠意和解、又何必斤斤計較金錢乎、又供現願將每月收入盡數給伊應用、將來如能發財時、亦可完全交伊保管、至此、楊推事又訊問原告被毆之經過及傷單一過、復問杜妙娟、你要幾多贍養費、仁答一萬元、並稱被告有一二十萬家産、票求此數、並不爲多、</p>
<p>▲研究離異問題　楊推事問如果和好後、可否不必要求生活費、杜答、非要不可、又問曹勤業、原告已經如此、你對離異願意否、曹答不願意、又問、旣不願意離異、你願出幾多錢給原告、曹仍答無錢、原告律師起立聲稱、日前雙方商議離婚條件時、原告要求贍養費一萬元、被告要求減少、可見被告旣無誠意和解、亦非絶對無錢、程推事問曹勤業有無此事、曹答、他們敲竹槓要求一萬二萬、又問邵中道、你能協助磋商離異條件否、邵答、本人不能恊助、須徵其庶母後始能辦理、云云、</p>
<p>▲受盡六年之苦　至此被告律師瞿鉞力勸兩造和解、並云、條件旣無甚問題、至酬貼醫藥費數目、可請被告自定、其辦法似可分期付給、楊推事亦云、如看在子女身上、仍以不離爲妥、杜妙娟答、庭上之意甚感、我原爲子女之故、乃能忍氣吞聲、受盡六年之苦、但曹勤業不但不顧子女之情、且欲致我之命、因而提此離異之訴、楊推事遂宣告現此案不能和解、須改期俟調查被告家境實際情形及傳證人後、開始辯論、即退庭、</p>

<p>▲槍彈齊發匪懷空　周秉臣於鉅鈔被刦後、因受驚過甚、神經錯亂、立即返奔行中、旣抵階下、已經掩面哭泣、人或詢之、亦不詳答、故永亨行員初亦不知此出店所遭固屬何事也、直至崗捕趕盜、路人呼喊、始悉五千元鈔幣已入匪手、河南路口崗警得報後、即向三盜匪追捕、匪向西竄、且作探手出槍狀、捕爲先發制人計、立即發槍、約三響、擊中其二、一匪當場應聲倒地、此時華捕圍而相助者已多人、因甯波路各里弄及錢主銀行等、都僱有武裝司閽、一聞槍聲、知事不佳、相率出助者比比皆是、移時中央捕房亦得訊、派中西探警至出事地點搜查捕匪無如探囊傷匪懷間、除手槍凶器外、别無長物、所謂五千元者遍尋莫着也、</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Shanxi Army Reduction Issue</h3>
<p>Generally Resolved</p>
<p>Decision to Establish a Military Affairs Committee</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Businessmen Nong, Yongchang Xu, and Yang Xiao'ou went to the Shanxi Grand Hotel on the afternoon of the 3rd to discuss with Ji Hu on maintaining the Tianjin Agreement and implementing the reduction plan. After an hour of discussion, Xu and Yang used the telephone to summon Sun Chu, Yang Xiao'ou, Wang Jingguo, Li Shengda, and others who had been pre-selected by the various army commanders as representatives to discuss. Sun and the others explained to Ji Hu successively the process of negotiation among the army commanders in recent days, and the attitude of the army commanders after the representative Jing returned to Taiyuan and reported the meaning of Vice Chairman Zhang. They said that the principles of the Tianjin Agreement must be earnestly implemented, but it is necessary to quickly think of remedial measures according to the difficulties in the process, and even more willing to implement the Qiao Telegram's proposal to abolish the army commander system. Ji said that he hoped not to insist on this point, and where personal qualifications could help, he would definitely ask for instructions from time to time. After 5 o'clock, the four army commanders left the hotel and went to Sun's residence. At that time, Li Fuying and Zhang Huizhao were already waiting. They then summoned Feng Pengzhu, Yang Fang, and Yang Chengyuan to go. After Sun and the others reported the situation of the hotel meeting, they continued to study the organization of the Military Affairs Committee and other issues, and only dispersed at midnight. According to a certain army commander, it has been generally decided that Sun Chu's troops will still be the Zhengtai Railway Protection Army, and the vacant division commander positions will be filled by Li Fuying, directly under Xu Yongchang. Zhang Huizhao's troops will be changed to provincial defense forces. The three garrison commanders originally planned to be set up by the headquarters are now planned to be temporarily set up in Taiyuan. It has not yet been determined whether to use the name of garrison, security, or Jin-Sui security commander. It has been decided that Rong Honglu will be appointed as the commander. Zhang Huizhao's provincial defense forces will be under Rong's control. The Military Affairs Committee will definitely be established. Internally, it will exercise its powers in the name of a committee. The number of members has not yet been determined. The candidates are planned to be mutually recommended by the army commanders and commanders. Externally, they will still be called by the name of army commanders to avoid complications. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) A certain important person said that the Jin situation dispute has now been largely resolved. Yesterday, Shang, Xu, Yang, Ji Hu, and the army commanders held a meeting at the hotel, which was a concrete expression of the three parties resolving their prejudices and negotiating frankly after the Jin situation dispute. Ji and others expressed great sympathy for the army commanders' acceptance of the principles of the Tianjin Agreement. The main points of the meeting were to study the content and scope of the joint telegram to Chiang and Zhang. The main points have been agreed, and it is currently being drafted and can be sent by telegram within days. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Fu Zuoyi returned to Taiyuan on the 3rd and met with Shang, Xu, Yang, and the army commanders on the 4th, expressing his willingness to obey the majority's opinion on the reduction, and his personal position was not a problem, and he had no prejudices against people or things. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Jing Yaoyue telegraphed Zhang on the 3rd, saying that he was surprised to be received in Shenyang. After returning, he will report to the generals the Vice Chairman's main purpose of taking care of the overall situation and the difficulties in cleaning up the Jin situation. The generals have demonstrated great righteousness and expressed their gratitude in unison. Within the scope of their capabilities, they are willing to work hard to comply with the Tianjin Agreement. However, they still hope that the Vice Chairman will give considerable consideration to the points related to local order and the hopes of the people, so that they dare to take responsibility and strive to carry out everything. He also telegraphed Wang Shuhan, asking him to explain to Zhang Qu and ask for considerable accommodation for the various items previously requested in person. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The army commanders agreed at Sun Chu's residence on the 2nd. In addition to the eight divisions, one railway protection army, and two regiments in each garrison, the method of reorganization and disbandment was initially planned to be mutual transfer between the north and the south. Later, fearing that it would cost too much trouble, it was decided to reorganize and disband on the spot. The organization of the Military Affairs Committee is still under study. The generals expressed in their reply telegram to the Northeast that their main purpose is to maintain the local area from being devastated under the advocacy of the Qiao Telegram. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Jing Yaoyue, the representative sent by the army commanders to the Northeast, has returned. On the 2nd, he reported on his meeting with Zhang, saying: 1. Zhang still insisted on maintaining the Tianjin Agreement, but he agreed to find ways to remedy the difficulties of the army commanders' Qiao Telegram within the possible scope. 2. The army commander system should be retained, and four armies and eight divisions should still be organized, and the addition of railway protection armies and three garrison departments can be discussed and handled according to the actual situation. 3. The total number of troops is 50 large regiments, and the military pay will be assisted by the Northeast and Hebei provinces. The remaining officers will be sent to the Military Academy. The army commanders were satisfied with Jing's report and decided to hold another meeting at the headquarters within days to negotiate specific methods of reorganization and disbandment. They also gathered at Li Fuying's residence in the evening. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Wang Shuhan personally wrote to Rong Honglu, delivered by Jing, saying that the various situations in Shanxi described by Jing, speaking of Jin in Jin, is a common practice, and Vice Chairman Zhang also has difficulties. It is absolutely difficult to do what everyone advocates. It is hoped that everyone will temporarily maintain the Tianjin Plan. After talking with Tai Zhao several times, the Vice Chairman has a thorough understanding of the Jin situation, and the relationship is very harmonious. Tai Zhao will have a detailed report after returning to Taiyuan. I hope to explain to the army commanders and must make concessions to each other to overcome this difficulty. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Shang's attitude has been quite calm recently. As for the military reduction, the generals have already negotiated directly with the Northeast, and the individual does not make any claims. The new provincial government, because all the commissioners have expressed that they are unwilling to take office before the military reduction is completed, Shang has been working hard on internal reorganization for days and has little contact with the outside world. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) It has been decided to establish a Military Affairs Committee. It will consult with the various departments of the headquarters for reorganization. The headquarters is rushing to complete the work. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

The secretary-general and representatives of the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh district party headquarters reported on the work of each district. Member of the Central Committee Chiang Kai-shek gave instructions, saying that the capital city party headquarters and party members should be models for the provinces and cities. The past achievements of Beijing City are the result of the efforts of the representatives. The central government and the brothers are very gratified. It is heard that few people attend the meetings of the lower-level party headquarters. Even if there are meetings, they have little meaning, and there is no way to check the advantages and disadvantages. Party members should abide by their duties and understand their responsibilities. The proposals of the general meeting should be carefully discussed. Party members should be trained to be models for the people. Those who guide party members should pay attention to organization and training, not only within the party but also to organize and train the people. It is even more necessary to eliminate the idea of rights and sacrifice everything for the party. Next, eleven proposals were resolved. The fourth meeting was held in the afternoon, with Xiao Jishan and Zhu Wenzhong presiding. Twenty proposals were resolved, and it was decided to extend the conference by one day. On the evening of the 4th, the municipal party headquarters held a banquet for all the representatives at the Anle Hotel, and it closed at 4 pm on the 5th. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northwest Party Affairs Policy</h3>

Next, the party committees of each province reported on the situation in the Northwest. Chiang also personally drafted a letter to Gu Zhutong, director of the Northwest Headquarters, instructing him to do his best to assist. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Major Changes in the Guangxi Situation</h3>
<p>Talks by Huang Shaoxiong and Wu Tingyang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) I recently met Huang Shaoxiong and talked about the report that changes have occurred in the Guangxi situation. As of now, no formal report has been received. According to my personal speculation, it may be due to the error in reducing Liu Dingxi's troops. Liu had followed Li Mingrui for a long time and was suspected of being a Communist. When I left Guangxi, Liu's troops were planning to be transferred from Longzhou to Nanning for reduction, so the report said, it is assumed that this is a mistake. Liu's troops only have more than 500 guns. Even if disputes arise due to the reduction, it is not difficult to resolve them immediately. Huang also said that the central government has decided to deal with the Guangxi issue through peaceful means. The specific methods are still under discussion. The reorganization of the Guangxi Provincial Government may be realized earlier so that the military and political aftermath can be reorganized at the same time. I and Chief Commander Chen completely regard the central government's intentions as our own. Once the specific methods are decided, we will set a date to leave Beijing. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The reporter recently visited Wu Tingyang and asked about the recent situation in Guangxi. According to him, the report that there have been changes in Guangxi, saying that there have been conflicts between the Bai and Zhang troops and the Huang Xuchu troops in Nanning and Wuzhou, according to personal observation, the Huang troops are currently stationed in Nanning, and the Nanning and Liuzhou radio stations are communicating without any hindrance. The Liuzhou radio station and the Nanjing radio station are connected every day. If there is such an accident, the central government can receive the news at any time, but no telegram has been received so far, which shows that this statement is difficult to confirm. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Wenche Arrives in Pingliang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Wenche, Yan Er'ai, and others were ordered to go to Gansu. They telegraphed that they had arrived in Pingliang and will go to Lanzhou within days. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Business Tax Rates in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of business tax rates in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the Ministry of Finance, according to the presentation of various commercial groups in Shanghai, believes that the tax rates set by the two provinces exceed the standards of the tax rates promulgated by the central government and are extremely heavy. It is requested to be revised. After review by the Taxation Department and the Tax Reorganization Research Committee, meetings have been held for days to discuss that the nature of the tax is to levy tax according to the turnover or capital amount. If the original fixed standard is increased too much, the burden on businesses and people is not good. It is planned to revise it, or the ministry will inform the provincial governments to make their own additions and revisions based on the principles promulgated by the central government. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Law on Punishing Corruption</h3>
<p>Results of the Review by the Legal Group of the Central Political Council</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth Plenary Session submitted for discussion and enacted a separate law to punish corruption. The results of the review by the Legal Group considered that if a public official accepts bribes or embezzled public funds, if the amount is less than 1,000 yuan, it is proposed to double the punishment for the crime of dismissal under the criminal law. If it is more than 1,000 yuan, it is proposed to sentence him to life imprisonment. In addition to recovering the stolen goods, his property may also be confiscated. If he surrenders before being discovered, he may be exempted from punishment. The handling agency will be the High Court as the third instance. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang's proposal to the Central Political Council that stores that trade with government agencies and give private kickbacks, and public officials who collude in malpractice, should be severely punished. It is heard that the results of the review by the Legal Group considered that Article 136 of the Criminal Law already stipulates the punishment for public officials who directly or indirectly engage in illicit activities for matters under their management and supervision. Therefore, the malpractice of public officials and stores should be handled in accordance with that article. As for the kickbacks given by stores to government officials, if the amount is not listed in the documents, resulting in private interests, it is also considered a crime. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Situation of International Disarmament</h3>
<p>Huang Musong Reports to Sun Ke in a Letter</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong, a representative attending the International Disarmament Preparatory Committee, sent a letter from London to Sun Ke, reporting on the difficulty and complexity of disarmament, the factions of representatives of various countries, the concepts and attitudes towards disarmament, and the future trend of international interests after the end of the meeting, which were very detailed. It also said that in order to cope with the future formal conference, there should be a formal organization for research in peacetime. If people are sent temporarily to perfunctorily deal with the situation, it is better to be absent. The work of the League of Nations is not only a thorough debate on domestic affairs, but also a considerable expression on the affairs of other countries in order to convey sympathy to all countries. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Puyang Garrison Demands Local Support</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Various agencies and groups in Puyang telegraphed that the Liu Heiqi troops stationed in the area are demanding local support. The people of Puyang are exhausted and willing to die together. All personnel serving in various party and government agencies and groups in Puyang are requested to resign. Yesterday evening, Shenyang telegraphed, ordering the army not to raise funds locally and dispatching verification officers to go. The armies south of Fenzhou in southern Shanxi are also collecting from the people, as is Suiyuan. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Li Zhangbai Dissolves Newly Recruited Troops</h3>

<h3>Zhu Mao Invades Pingyuan and is Repelled to Xunwu</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhu Mao, with 6,000 to 7,000 men from the 28th Army, invaded Guangdong Pingyuan from Anyuan Xunwu. Xiang Hanping dispatched Chen Ju and Li Zhenliang's two regiments to suppress them. After two days and nights of fighting, the bandits were defeated and retreated to Xunwu. Wu Jianxiong's regiment was ordered to return to the province from Beijiang and transfer oil to increase defense on the Jiangxi border. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee held a regular meeting on the afternoon of the 4th, chaired by Jiao Yitang, to discuss (1) the preliminary review report on the draft Amendment to the Regulations on the Establishment of Standards for Laws and Regulations, passed; (2) the draft Article on Strictly Defining the Leave Regulations for Political Officials, Restricting Officials from Arbitrarily Taking Leave and Leaving Office, and Stipulating Punishment for Absentees, the preliminary review report, was resolved and re-examined; (3) the draft Organization Law of the Committee on Disciplinary Action for Officials, the preliminary review report, was resolved and continued with the preliminary review; (4) the Draft Examination Regulations for Water Workers, submitted by the Yuan, was resolved and the Yuan was not required to review it; (5) the Draft Examination Regulations for River and Sea Navigators, was resolved and the Yuan was not required to review it.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The British Labour Government and the Conservative Party</h3>
<p>Recently, the disputes between governments and opposition parties in various countries, except for the easy collapse of the French cabinet, the cabinets of Germany's Brüning, Japan's Hamaguchi, and the British Labour Party, although all are under the cyclical attack of the opposition parties, are all able to barely support themselves because each has a special ability and means. Taking the British Labour Party cabinet as an example, the Conservative Party opposing the government can be said to have tried every method to overthrow it. However, Labour leader MacDonald was not subdued by the fact that MacDonald's steps in response were not chaotic, his主張堅定 claims were firm, and he was not swayed by public opinion. The opposition party first attacked the government's economic policy. The government resigned to no avail, and then went on to force a general election, putting the government in a difficult situation, thinking that the Labour government would not be able to cope. However, MacDonald had already prepared for this. For the attack on economic policy, he worked harder to improve the economic situation, declaring that he would never resign unless he failed in the impeachment case. For the general election, he tried to avoid it on the one hand, and decided not to fall into the predicament of the general election unless absolutely necessary. On the other hand, he proposed a bill to reform the election law, thinking that even if an election is held, the Conservative Party can be prevented from obtaining a majority of seats in the Lower House with a small number of electors as before. The Conservative Party's forcing of the election still wants to restore power with the previous law. Therefore, MacDonald also has a preventive policy. It can be seen that the Labour government's plan to deal with the opposition party is also step by step careful, with strict defenses, not giving people the opportunity to penetrate deep into the area. Its means are beyond the reach of the opposition party. Therefore, although it has encountered crises many times, it can always turn danger into safety. It is for this reason.</p>

<h3>Wu Peifu Moves to Xuanhan County</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, a certain party received a wireless telegram from Suiding Prefecture, saying that the rumors that Wu Peifu was seriously ill in Heshiba are not true. Wu moved to the Wentianxiang Ancestral Hall at Xiabamiaochang in Xuanhan County last summer and is still living there, with no illness or activities. It was found that Wu lived in Baidicheng for the first six months of entering Sichuan, Dazhu for the second six months, Tanmuchang in Suiding for the third six months, and Heshiba from the year before last to last summer, and now Xiabamiaochang. Not long ago, a certain Sichuan elder visited Wu. Wu said that he had never killed young people or party members in his life. Why does the national opinion not understand me? Someone laughed and said, "You really worked as a night soil collector in the past, carrying Cao Kun on one shoulder and your subordinates on the other. How can people not cover their noses? Now that you have retired to Sichuan, the people of Sichuan treat you very kindly. If it were someone else, you would have been driven away long ago." (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sino-Russian Negotiations are Relatively Close</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to the diplomatic mission, in Sino-Russian negotiations, a certain country frequently promotes propaganda that it is not easy to proceed and that Russia is increasing troops on the border. However, the European and American envoys in Moscow believe that although Sino-Russian negotiations have not yet become concrete, the subcommittees and out-of-meeting contacts are quite close, and they know that Wang Zhengting and Mo Dehui will definitely solve this problem. It was also found that Russia has never increased troops on the Russian border, because Russia has national conscription, and the people are soldiers, so there is no increase or decrease. Russia decided to purchase 100,000 hens from the three northeastern provinces and set up poultry farms in the Vladivostok to伯力 area. Currently, one chicken egg in Russia costs 25 kopecks, equivalent to one-quarter of a gold ruble. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fan Bonk Arrives in Beiping Last Night</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Fan Bonk arrived in Ping at 8:30, and hundreds of people welcomed him at the station. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) American movie star Fan Bonk passed through Tianjin at 5:30 pm on the 4th to go to Ping. Yan Zhikai, director of the Tianjin Art Museum, took a night train to Qinhuangdao on the 3rd to welcome him. Mei Lanfang sent Gao Mengyi to Tianjin to welcome him. In addition, there were more than 30 representatives from film companies such as China United and Mei Cha in North China to welcome him at the station. Because Mr. Fan's performance of "Stealing Treasures from the Moon Palace" was too insulting to the Chinese, no one went to the station to admire his demeanor. Fan told reporters that he did not understand the situation in China before, and there were inevitably some places in the performance films that were disrespectful to the Chinese. However, the fault lies in the script. He traveled to Shanghai the year before last and realized that China is a land of culture and etiquette in East Asia, and he was very impressed. He is very honored to come to Beiping again and receive the teachings of your country's people. The largest Hollywood film company in the United States has had mixed reviews for sound and silent films in recent years. The Japanese film industry has not made much progress in recent years. The Chinese film industry is booming and there are many artistic young people who will have great development prospects in the future when the photography equipment is complete. He will travel in Ping for three or four days and then go to Siam and India to return home. He very much hopes that Dr. Mei Lanfang will travel to Europe and the United States together, but he is afraid that Mei will not agree. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>France-Mexico Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Clipperton Island in the Pacific Ocean</p>
<p>Determined by the Arbitration Committee to be Under French Jurisdiction</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 4th: The dispute between France and Mexico over Clipperton Island, which has been unresolved for 71 years, has now been finally resolved by the Arbitration Committee, and France has won its final victory. The island is located in the Pacific Ocean, 1,200 kilometers west of the Mexican coast. France obtained it in 1858, but did not actually occupy it. In 1897, the United States intended to occupy it, but ultimately failed due to France's arguments. Therefore, the Mexican government ordered a warship to carry out the occupation, claiming to have a right to the island that was superior to France's. It was not until 1908 that both parties agreed to invite the Italian Emperor to serve as the arbitrator, and this case has now come to an end. It is said that there are no residents on the island, but there are several phosphate mines buried there.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Earthquake Still Not Ceasing</h3>
<p>Napier Suffers Severe Damage, Oil Ponds Catch Fire and Burn Down the Whole Town</p>
<p>Seabed Uplift, Roads Collapse, Nearly a Thousand Injured, Authorities Restrict People From Leaving the City</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Wellington, 4th: The Napier earthquake has not yet stopped. Last night, the captain of the British warship Veronica sent a radio telegram, saying that he personally inspected Napier. Almost all brick-built houses were damaged, and many houses are still on fire. Hundreds of wooden houses were also destroyed. Firefighters were unable to put out the fire due to lack of water. The disaster is huge and the residents are terrified. Food relief stations have been organized and street patrols are being carried out. Poor women and children have been moved to the warship. There are nearly a thousand injured in Napier, and fifty oil ponds have caught fire, burning down the whole town, creating a tragic scene. The earthquake started at 10:45 am yesterday and occurred frequently throughout the day. The entire North Island was almost shaken. The seabed uplifted, the coast changed, and some places were completely destroyed. Roads collapsed into huge holes, and railways and rivers were blocked. Rescue teams worked desperately to save those who were buried alive, regardless of the danger. In Hastings, twelve miles from Napier, sixteen employees of a department store were crushed by a collapsed building. After nine hours of work, two people were dug out, one injured and one unharmed.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Wellington, 4th: Crowds gathered outside the telegraph office, wanting to know the news from the earthquake-stricken area, but the reports received here are still very scarce, because telephone and telegram communications are blocked. According to the latest news, a Catholic church collapsed, killing two priests and eight students. The railway tunnel on the coast of Hawke's Bay also collapsed, but fortunately no one was injured. The bottom of the Napier port river has risen by eighteen inches, and even small steamers can no longer enter the inner port. The number of deaths in each disaster area is higher than expected. According to estimates by responsible parties, there are 80 to 100 deaths in Hastings alone, but there are still many people buried in the rubble. A detailed report from Napier has not yet arrived, and it is feared that the number of deaths will be quite high.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Wellington, 4th: Many family members of the victims are camping with blankets and clothes they took from their homes along the Napier coast. Their homes have been destroyed by fire. Within a forty-mile area, almost no chimneys are standing. The magnitude of the disaster can be seen. Napier's newly built municipal theater, magnificent hotel, two of the newest newspaper offices, and two churches have all been destroyed and cannot be repaired.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Wellington, 4th: The authorities ordered tonight that all people in Napier must leave the city within two days, because the drinking water system has been destroyed. If people stay there for a long time, there is a fear of epidemics. The area is still feeling tremors. People in the disaster area are all camping with their families in public squares.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Wellington, 4th: According to refugees who came here from the port of Napier, Napier is in a state of chaos, so the number of victims cannot be estimated. However, all the refugees said that there must be hundreds of deaths, and some said that the number has reached four digits in Napier alone. The disaster described by the refugees is heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Writes to the Viceroy of India</h3>
<p>Urging Immediate Investigation of Police Brutality</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Allahabad, 4th: According to the "Leader" newspaper, Gandhi wrote to Viceroy Irwin, urging a formal investigation into the police brutality in several cases. Gandhi called this a testing event. The newspaper said that if the Viceroy agrees to investigate, Gandhi will regard this as a sincere inclination towards peace and intends to persuade the All-India Congress to change its policy by using Prime Minister MacDonald's speech at the close of the Indian Round Table Conference. Prime Minister MacDonald's speech stated that the British government intends to consider the plan for cooperation between the British government and Indian representatives as soon as possible so that the results of their satisfactory work can be reflected in the new Indian constitution. He also said that if those engaged in non-violent resistance movements can respond in a timely manner to the Viceroy's appeal to them, and if they and others are willing to cooperate in accordance with the government's declared policy, the government intends to take steps to accommodate their work.</p>
<h3>Great Chaos in the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Shidehara Speaks Out of Turn, All Members of the Seiyukai Party Stand Up and Scold</p>
<p>Aggressors Swarm the Stage, Guards Protect the Foreign Minister to Escape to the Minister's Room</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: The House of Representatives Budget Committee reconvened at 1:00 pm on the 3rd. Toshio Shimada of the Seiyukai Party questioned why Prime Minister Hamaguchi did not attend. Committee Chairman Takeuchi replied that Prime Minister Hamaguchi is in good condition and he is confident that he will be able to attend soon, but he cannot give a definite time. Shimada further asked that the Prime Minister's absence is a destruction of constitutional politics and that he should attend even if he is sick. Next, Toyokaku Sakamoto of the Seiyukai Party attacked the Governor-General's office for disrupting discipline and the failure of its "aboriginal" policy regarding the Wushe Incident. He said that Governor-General Ishizuka took his family to climb Mount Niitaka and spent 10,000 yen to build a mountain road. He asked whether this kind of undisciplined behavior could give the "aboriginals" a good impression and asked about the responsibility of Minister Matsuda. Minister Matsuda replied that with regard to the Wushe Incident, Governor-General Ishizuka and others had already resigned to take responsibility and that he had no need to resign. Next, Kunimatsu Hamada of the Seiyukai Party said, "Does Article 2 of the Constitution also apply to Taiwan?" The Minister did not give a clear answer. Hamada also asked, "When suppressing the 'aboriginals', artillery and bombs were used, which is purely an act of war and exceeds the limits of maintaining order. What is the legal basis for mobilizing the army?" Minister Matsuda replied that the police force alone was not enough to quell the incident, so he sought help from the army. Hamada also asked, "Taiwanese magazines have reported that the army used poison gas. What is the truth?" Minister of War Ugaki replied that only tear gas was used to reduce the resistance of the "aboriginals", and that poison gas was never used. A recess was taken at 3:50 pm. The meeting reconvened for the third time at 4:35 pm. Tadahiko Okada of the Seiyukai Party took the stage and said that the local budgets of 33 prefectures besides Tokyo were surprisingly inflated, which could be said to be a thorough implementation of the government's austerity policy. This was because the central government advocated a non-borrowing policy and cut central finances unreasonably, which in turn made local finances increasingly inflated. He listed figures and examples to attack the loopholes in the public debt policy. Interior Minister Adachi replied that the increase in the finances of some localities was due to the approval of public bonds for unemployment relief, which was an unavoidable increase. Next, Shinjiro Ota, an independent, took the stage and said that trying to deal with this recession with such stopgap unemployment relief measures as civil engineering projects would only exacerbate dangerous ideas. Unless the harsh taxes and levies on bankrupt agricultural, industrial, and commercial operators are stopped, ideas will only become increasingly worse. Prime Minister-Acting Shidehara replied that there was no other way but to proceed gradually. Finance Minister Inoue replied that the government was paying very close attention to the collection of taxes, but it could not violate the law. Another recess was taken at 7:12 pm. The meeting reconvened at 8:16 pm. After Nagayoshi Miyawaki of the Seiyukai Party questioned Minister of War Ugaki about the delay in the army system reform, Chikuhei Nakajima of the Seiyukai Party took the stage and said that the military strength agreed to in the London Treaty definitely had a major defect in Japan's national defense. He asked what the government's responsibility was for concluding a treaty with such inferior military strength. Prime Minister-Acting Shidehara replied that the London Treaty had already been approved by the Emperor, and refuted this. As a result, the long-simmering crisis erupted at once. All members of the Seiyukai Party stood up and scolded Prime Minister-Acting Shidehara, and the Minseito Party also responded with harsh words, resulting in a state of great chaos. At 9:50 pm, Toshio Shimada of the Seiyukai Party took the stage amid the commotion and said that Mr. Shidehara's words had forgotten the responsibility of assisting and were a serious slip of the tongue and should be withdrawn immediately. Mr. Shidehara replied that the responsibility for approving the treaty naturally lay with the government and tried hard to argue his case. The opposition parties refused to allow it, shouting "Disrespectful to the Emperor!" "Shifting responsibility to the Emperor is disrespectful!" "A mere withdrawal is not enough to make up for the slip of the tongue!" Aggressors swarmed the stage, and the parliament was in great chaos, almost irredeemable. As the chaos subsided slightly, Committee Chairman Takeuchi declared that the Budget Committee would continue tomorrow and adjourned the meeting at 11:00 pm. However, the Seiyukai aggressors were still unwilling to give up and approached Foreign Minister Shidehara. The Foreign Minister was protected by guards and escaped to the Minister's Room before he was safe.</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Party Issues Statement</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: After the Budget Committee meeting adjourned last night, the Seiyukai Party immediately held an executive meeting in the parliament building to discuss future policies regarding Prime Minister-Acting Shidehara's slip of the tongue. As a result, it was decided that Mr. Shidehara's slip of the tongue disregarded the responsibility of assisting and shifted responsibility to the Emperor, which could not be regarded as a simple slip of the tongue. The Seiyukai Party decided to pursue this matter from beginning to end at the Budget Committee meeting on the 4th. If the government does not show an attitude of reflection, it will absolutely oppose the continued deliberation of the budget and is determined to maintain a tough stance. Subsequently, a statement was issued in the name of Secretary-General Mori, stating in essence that Mr. Shidehara was a rebel against the responsibility of the party and cabinet and that he must be punished from beginning to end.</p>
<h3>Ruling Party Executives Discuss Response</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: Ruling party executives discussed future parliamentary tactics last night after the Budget Committee meeting adjourned and exchanged various opinions. They all agreed that Foreign Minister Shidehara's true intention had already been made clear in his statement that the government was fully responsible for the approval of the London Treaty in response to questions from Mr. Chikuhei Nakajima and Mr. Toshio Shimada, and there was no reason for any responsibility issues to arise. The Seiyukai side, however, roared, cursed, and shouted incessantly and swarmed to the Minister's seat, clearly with a planned disruption of the proceedings. The ruling party decided after the meeting to respond with full vigilance and determination.</p>
<h3>Arouses Attention in the House of Peers</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: Prime Minister-Acting Shidehara's slip of the tongue in the House of Representatives Budget Committee has had a profound impact on the House of Peers, arousing the rise of anti-government members. If the government and the ruling party do not show a sincere attitude towards the overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives, the Seiyukai fighting generals of each Gongzheng Society and Jiaoyou Club are determined to propose this matter in the House of Peers and thoroughly impeach the government. Therefore, Mr. Shidehara's words and deeds will cause a great wave in the House of Peers. At the same time, it is expected that the government's relationship with the House of Peers will be cast into a major reef, with difficulties overlapping.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Continue the Budget Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: The House of Representatives Budget Committee's questioning was originally scheduled to end on the 3rd, but the meeting was disrupted by Prime Minister-Acting Shidehara's slip of the tongue. The dispute was not resolved, and the meeting was adjourned, postponed to today. The second meeting of the Budget Committee reconvened at 10:00 am, starting with a proposal from the ruling party that the questioning should be concluded satisfactorily today, with the questions of Nakajima, Ando, and Dong serving as the conclusion. The Seiyukai Party claimed that it needed to consult with the executive staff about this proposal, but there was no result. The meeting was adjourned after only half an hour, at 10:35 am. In the afternoon, the ruling party disregarded the Seiyukai Party's claims and reconvened the meeting at 2:00 pm. After negotiating the agenda, there was a recess.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: At the second Budget Committee meeting today, the ruling party tried to conclude the questioning today, but was ultimately unsuccessful. After three meetings, the meeting could not be continued and adjourned at 5:45 pm. The meeting is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow at 10:00 am.</p>
<h3>Formal Meeting of the House of Peers</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: The formal meeting of the House of Peers today convened at 10:23 am. Vice-Chairman Konoe took the chairman's seat and continued the questioning from the previous day. Takeji Kawamura (Jiaoyou) took the stage and said, "In addition to laying parallel lines to the South Manchuria Railway, the authorities in Northeast China are also planning the ManMong Railway network, intending to isolate the South Manchuria Railway. What is the government's plan for this? In the Wushe Incident, the government has fundamentally destroyed the traditional 'aboriginal' policy. Why was a martial law order not issued at the time? This is clearly a government failure. Also, when setting fire to the 'aboriginal' villages, people of all ages were indiscriminately killed, which is a violation of the constitution." Foreign Minister Shidehara replied that the South Manchuria Railway parallel lines mentioned had not yet been completed and that he did not think the South Manchuria Railway would be greatly affected. Minister of War Ugaki replied that since combat operations had begun, the most effective methods should be adopted, which was unavoidable. Even if a martial law order should have been issued, there was no time. Mr. Kawamura took the stage again and asked, "The Wushe Incident is more serious than the Miao Street Incident. Minister Matsuda is not taking responsibility, which is inappropriate." Minister Matsuda replied, "I deeply regret the occurrence of the Wushe Incident, but I do not think I should resign." Next, Koichiro Shimizu (Yan) took the stage and raised questions on domestic and foreign policy issues such as the London Treaty, the Wushe Incident, military system reform, and election law amendments. A recess was taken at 12:05 am.</p>
<h3>Reopening of the German Parliament</h3>
<p>Guarded, Inside and Out</p>
<p>Opposition Parties Prepare for Verbal Warfare</p>
<p>▲From the National News Agency, Berlin, March 3rd: The German Parliament reopened this afternoon after the annual recess. To prevent radical elements from causing disturbances, the authorities dispatched a large contingent of police to guard the exterior of the building. The Parliament was remarkably peaceful both inside and out today. Even those in the visitors' gallery hoping to hear heated debates were mostly disappointed, as the agenda consisted mainly of routine business. Consequently, many members were absent. Furthermore, leading figures from all parties were focusing on the work of the Parliament's Committee of Elders. After intense debate, the committee has passed several new proposals that will make parliamentary rules even stricter and make it more difficult for the opposition to operate. For example, motions of no confidence will only be considered after an impeachment proceeding; the government will automatically have the confidence of Parliament. Also, the number of signatures required to initiate an impeachment motion has been increased from fifteen to fifty. All of these measures are designed to limit the activities of the opposition. Therefore, the opposition is now up in arms, accusing the government of abusing its power and attempting to muzzle them. Thus, when these proposals are presented to the plenary session at the end of this week, there is sure to be an unusually fierce verbal battle.</p>
<h3>Disturbance in the Czechoslovak Parliament</h3>
<p>Communist Members Throw Punches</p>
<p>▲From the National News Agency, Prague, March 3rd: Today, Communist members of the Czechoslovak Parliament disrupted the Attorney General’s speech, demanding the immediate release of political prisoners, leading to a major conflict. They even resorted to throwing punches. Eventually, twelve Communist members were forcibly removed from the chamber before order could be restored.</p>
<h3>US Congress Drops Proposal to Pay Out Cash in Silver</h3>
<p>Business Community Joyful Following Warning from Banking Sector About Economic Decline</p>
<p>▲From the National News Agency, Washington, March 3rd: A reliable report released here today states that both houses of Congress have decided to abandon the proposal to pay out cash in silver to veterans of the previous European war. This decision is based on warnings from the banking sector about the current economic decline. Mr. Mitchell, the President of the National Bank of New York, was one of those who issued warnings. Otherwise, the U.S. Treasury would have had to issue another $1,000,000,000 in bonds, which would have triggered a panic in the banking sector. Just a week ago, financial centers in various regions were concerned that Congress might approve the silver payout proposal. However, since the report from Washington was released today, the business community has expressed joy.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Electoral Reform Bill, Passes Second Reading</h3>
<p>▲From Reuters, London, March 3rd: During the second reading debate of the Electoral Reform Bill in the House of Commons today, Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the bill overturned the calculations of the Conservative Party, who had secured a majority of seats in the House of Commons with a minority of voters in the 1914 election and hoped to repeat that experience in the future. This bill differs from proportional representation in that its goal is to represent the majority, not the minority, he said. The bill is officially known as the People’s Enfranchisement Bill. The House of Commons has now passed the second reading of the bill by a vote of 295 to 230.</p>
<p>▲From Reuters, London, March 3rd: Prime Minister MacDonald told Labour members of Parliament today that the government is determined to continue its efforts to improve the current economic situation, and will not plunge the country into a general election unless absolutely necessary. Observers in the visitors' gallery of the House of Commons believe that both the Labour government and the Liberal Party know that a general election would restore the Conservative Party to power, so both parties are determined to avoid a general election.</p>
<h3>Explosion on Britain's Largest Submarine</h3>
<p>▲From Reuters, London, March 3rd: An explosion occurred in the engine room of HMS M1, Britain's largest submarine, during trials on the River Thames, injuring twelve people, two of whom are seriously injured. One of the engines was half-destroyed. The submarine has now returned to Chatham. The cause of the explosion is unknown, but it is thought to be due to compressed air.</p>
<h3>British Prince Tours Jamaica</h3>
<p>▲From Reuters, Jamaica, March 3rd: The British Prince and Prince George, who plan to attend the opening ceremony of the British Goods Exhibition in the capital of Argentina in three days, arrived here today. The people's welcome was extremely enthusiastic, an event not seen since King George visited forty years ago. Public offices are closed and the whole city is flying flags. The British Prince was greeted everywhere with cheers and applause. The British Prince has toured British colonies extensively, but this is his first visit to Jamaica.</p>
<h3>Aviation Agreement Between Britain and Netherlands</h3>
<p>▲From Reuters, The Hague, March 3rd: The Dutch Foreign Minister stated in the Second Chamber today that Britain and the Netherlands have concluded an agreement mutually recognizing each other’s aviation licenses. The British and Dutch governments will cooperate to facilitate airmail services from the Netherlands to the Dutch East Indies and from Australia to other parts of the British Empire.</p>
<h3>Decline of Influenza Epidemic in Spain</h3>
<p>▲From the National News Agency, Madrid, March 3rd: The influenza epidemic here is gradually subsiding, but the death toll has already exceeded seven hundred. However, the epidemic is still spreading in the provinces, with the number of deaths increasing daily. The authorities have ordered schools, theaters, and cinemas to remain closed for another fourteen days.</p>
<h3>EU Committee Mails Documents to the Wrong Places</h3>
<p>▲From the National News Agency, Paris, March 3rd: The Soviet Union and Iceland have not responded to invitations to the European Federation Consideration Committee for a long time, which has caused deep suspicion. It is now known that this is entirely due to the committee mailing documents to the wrong places. The invitation to Iceland was sent to Moscow, and the invitation to the Soviet Union was sent to Iceland. This is somewhat comical, and newspapers are naturally mocking the committee’s absurdity in handling affairs. However, those involved say that someone opposed to inviting the Soviet Union secretly played a trick.</p>
<h3>International Committee to Close</h3>
<p>▲From the National News Agency, Geneva, March 3rd: According to the results of today's discussion by the International Committee considering the reorganization of the League of Nations Secretariat, the international upper-level organization will remain unchanged. The Anglo-French proposal to increase the number of Deputy Secretaries-General, with the directors of each bureau elevated to Deputy Secretary-General, has been rejected. The proposal to eliminate the position of Secretary-General has been rejected, and the current proposal for three Deputy Secretaries-General has also been dropped. The committee will close after discussing some minor issues tomorrow.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Arrives in Jiujiang</h3>
<p>▲Leaves for Nanchang by Special Train on the Morning of the 4th</p>
<p>Jiujiang Dispatch: Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin arrived in Jiujiang at 4:35 PM on the 3rd, after traveling west on the Yong Sui warship from Nanjing on the morning of the 2nd. The ship anchored in Dongliu that evening. Due to heavy fog on the morning of the 3rd, the ship did not set sail until 11:00 AM. Local welcoming personnel had been waiting at the Xun'an Wharf of the Sanbei Company, including Chief of Staff Xie Muhan of the Ninth Route Army, Chief of Staff Guo of the Fifth Division, Provincial Government Committee Members Jiang Ji, Gong Boxun, Huang Bozhong, Yang Mianzhong, Provincial Party Committee Member Liu Zhenqun, He Renhao, Nanxun Railway Bureau Director Yang Zhizhang, Chuqian Warship Captain Zheng Yaogong, Chief of the Second Regiment of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau Gu Baoding, and representatives from all sectors of Jiujiang, including Wang Shirong, Liu Dun, and Peng Keqin, totaling several dozen people. After the Yong Sui warship docked, Minister He raised his hand in salute to the welcoming personnel on the deck, and then went inside to meet with Xie Muhan and the various members of the provincial government and provincial party committee. He first received Lu Diping's report and a map of the bandit areas in the province from Xie Muhan, examining them carefully and inquiring in detail about the bandit situation in Jiangxi. The remaining welcoming personnel were received by Adjutant Wang Renjun, who stated that Minister He had caught a cold before leaving Nanjing and, urged by the Commander-in-Chief, had insisted on traveling while ill. He was not feeling well today, and had ordered him to thank all comrades on his behalf. Minister He's visit to Jiangxi was to eliminate the communist bandits within the set time limit, and he was not expected to leave Jiangxi in the short term.</p>
<p>After meeting with the representatives, He rested on the ship for the night as it was late. He disembarked at 8:30 AM on the 4th, and traveled by car to the railway station. Security along the way was very tight. The special train left for Nanchang at 9:00 AM. The welcoming personnel from the province who had come to Jiujiang all returned to the province with He.

<h3>Preservation of the Haiyuan Pavilion Collection</h3>
<p>▲The Government Presents Three Options</p>
<p>▲The Yang Family is Still Considering</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The collection of the Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng, owned by the Yang family, is of great significance to China's cultural heritage. Due to the Yang family's continuous sales of the collection, the need for preservation measures is increasingly recognized by society. Much of the Yang family's collection was lost during the Nian Rebellion. However, when the Yang family registered the collection with the government in the first year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty in order to preserve it, it still included the following books: (1) the Haiyuan Pavilion Book Catalog in six volumes, totaling 3,236 titles in the four categories of classics, history, philosophy, and literature, comprising over 208,300 volumes; (2) a catalog of Song and Yuan dynasty books in one volume, totaling 464 titles, comprising 11,328 volumes. However, between the summer and autumn of 1918 of the Republic Era, the bandit Wang Jinfal occupied Liaocheng twice, resulting in significant losses to the collection. When the Department of Education dispatched personnel to investigate thoroughly in the winter, only five Song dynasty editions and seventeen Yuan dynasty editions remained, with the rest being fine Ming and Qing dynasty editions. The so-called "fine editions" are the common editions of the Haiyuan Pavilion. However, most of the fine Song and Yuan dynasty editions had been transported to Tianjin by the owner Yang Jingfu for safekeeping before the bandits occupied Liaocheng, and were not lost. What was lost were mostly the common books of the Haiyuan Pavilion. In the spring of last year, when the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Education were about to take steps to preserve the collection, the war suddenly broke out, and Liaocheng was occupied by Wang Jinfal again. During the eight months of occupation, the bandits sold many of the books. When they left in the autumn, they took another portion of the collection with them, which is now scattered in Baoding, with the titles unknown. Some of the books that were sold have been appearing in Jinan from time to time. The Shandong Library has purchased four titles, spending a total of 215 yuan: Feng Shi Wen Jian Ji, collated by Huang Raopu, Zhu Qiuyai, He Yimen, and He Xiaoshan; Jiang Huai Yi Ren Lu, hand-copied by Wu Meian and collated by Huang Raopu; Wu Yi Xin Ji, a Ming dynasty edition; and a calligraphy album written jointly by Liu Wuzhong and his brothers. The ink on these books is still fresh and new, making them truly valuable. There are also several titles of Lin Hejing's collected works, which were reportedly purchased in Qingdao by a certain mayor for 590 yuan. Yang Jingfu sold twelve titles in Tianjin, including the best Song dynasty edition of the Shi Cai Tang edition of Meng Dongye Ji, Meng Xiangyang Ji, Gai Jia Zhou Ji, and Liu Liuzhou Ji, totaling less than thirty volumes. Ye Yuhu and Zhang Daishan jointly offered 60,000 yuan for them, but they were not sold. They were eventually purchased by a Japanese person for 80,000 yuan, through the introduction of a Beijing bookseller named Wang. The Japanese person used gold certificates to purchase the books, as the price of gold was high, so they did not consider the price to be expensive. Last autumn, when the provincial army recovered Liaocheng, the elderly Mrs. Yang transported all of the remaining books to Jinan for safekeeping, totaling fifty-seven cases, mostly containing extremely fine Ming dynasty editions. This represents not only a drop in the ocean compared to the original Haiyuan Pavilion collection, but also only what was left since Zeng. The rare Song and Yuan dynasty editions were all transported to Tianjin by Yang Jingfu. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly telegraphed the Provincial Government and the Department of Education to pay attention to this matter. The Provincial Government's Standing Committee decided to order the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Education to handle the matter. The Department of Civil Affairs dispatched an inspector to Dongxing Lane in the concession area to visit the owner, the elderly Mrs. Yang. A certain gentleman acted as her representative, stating that the books were in disarray when they were transported from Dongchang to Jinan, and that they would invite inspection after they had been organized, which was essentially a rejection. A committee member from the Department of Education directly presented three conditions to the elderly Mrs. Yang. The first option was for the Yang family to donate the entire collection. This option was further divided into three sub-options: (1) The National Government and the Provincial Government would issue a clear decree stating that the ownership of the books would forever belong to the Yang family; (2) A Haiyuan Pavilion Library would be built to display the books for public viewing; (3) A Book Committee would be organized to manage the library, with representatives from the National Government, the Provincial Government, and the Yang family, with the Yang family serving as the chairman. All revenue from entrance tickets to the library and from the reproduction of the books would belong to the Yang family. The National Government would also be requested to issue a commendation to the Yang family. The second option was a semi-donation and semi-sale. The Yang family's books would first be displayed and a catalog compiled. Hu Shi, Yuan Tongli, Fu Zengxiang, and others would be invited to Jinan to inspect and assess the books. The final price would be determined by the majority opinion. For example, if the assessed price was 1 million yuan, the government would give the Yang family 500,000 yuan, and the remaining 500,000 yuan would be considered a donation by the Yang family. This option would also involve building a Haiyuan Pavilion Library, and because the Yang family would be donating 500,000 yuan, the National Government and the Provincial Government would also be petitioned to issue a commendation. The third option was for the government to purchase the entire collection after valuation. The Yang family could choose any of these three options, and could also propose other options for discussion. If the Yang family still wished to preserve the collection privately as before, that would also be acceptable. However, if they were to sell the collection, the Shandong Library would have the right of first refusal. If the Yang family were to sell the collection privately, the government would be able to intervene. After receiving these conditions, the elderly Mrs. Yang seemed open to discussion, but the matter was of great importance and needed to be resolved by a family meeting, and Lao Zhichang (Yang Jingfu's father-in-law) would be asked to come to Jinan to make a decision. It is said that the National Government and the Provincial Government have made preparations for the second and third options, and that funding would not be a problem. The decision depends solely on the Yang family's response. Haiyuan Pavilion books are still frequently appearing on the market in Jinan, indicating that sales are continuing.</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Returns to Wuhan</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Chengjun, Director of the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters, returned to Hankou today (1st) via China National Aviation Corporation's "Wuchang" plane from Nanjing, where he had gone to consult with Chiang Kai-shek regarding bandit suppression strategies. Due to a flight delay, he did not arrive until 4:15 PM. He was accompanied by He Jingwu, Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau. After disembarking, He immediately went to the headquarters of the Third Army Corps, and then summoned Fang Benren, Wu Xingya, Liu Wendao, Xu Yuanquan, Wang Jinyu, Ji Hongchang, Zhang Yinxiang, Xiao Zhichu, Hua Wenxuan, and others to discuss all matters. This reporter drove to visit him and was received by He, who made the following statement: "During my visit to Nanjing, I discussed concrete measures for bandit suppression in the three provinces with the Commander-in-Chief. Minister He Yingqin will soon go to Nanchang. It is not yet known whether he will come to Hankou, but the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters will continue to be responsible for directing bandit suppression affairs in the three provinces as before. Huang Shaohong, after arriving in Nanjing, has already agreed on a proper settlement of the Guangxi affair. I have met with Huang Shaohong and Chen Jitang, and know that Li Bai and others are still sincere, so there are no problems in resolving the Guangxi affair. Regarding the settlement of the Sichuan affair, representatives of Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, and Tian Songyao have all arrived in Nanjing. I, along with Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and others, introduced the representatives to the Commander-in-Chief. The Central Government has decided to handle the Sichuan affair with leniency and peace. The representatives have all expressed their sincere obedience, and concrete solutions will be available within days. Regarding the implementation of the business tax in Hankou, we will follow the orders of the Central Government and consult with all sectors of Hankou to proceed, aiming for mutual assistance and mutual benefit. In addition, I have discussed the Hubei Province Disaster Relief Bond Regulations with President Hu of the Legislative Yuan, and it is hoped that they will be passed." At this point, He was fatigued from his flight and feeling unwell, so this reporter took his leave. (February 1st)</p>

<h3>Freight Train Derails in Linping on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</h3>
<p>A Shanghai-bound freight train that departed from Zhapu on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway at 10:20 AM today (4th) derailed at Linping Station due to improper switching operations during engine shunting. The locomotive completely derailed, overturned, and damaged the switch and the main line tracks, obstructing through traffic. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Circumstances of the Locomotive Derailment: The 21st freight train, which departed from Zhapu at 10:20 AM today and was bound for Shanghai, was hauled by locomotive P2 and consisted of 22 freight cars and 2 empty cars. At 1:40 PM, when the train arrived at Linping Station, the locomotive was disconnected for loading and unloading goods and adding cars, and was driven into the No. 2 siding. As it was about to enter the main line, the switchman inadvertently switched the wrong route, causing all six wheels of the locomotive to derail, overturn beside the track, and damage the switch and the main line tracks, obstructing traffic.</p>
<p>▲Station Master Sends Telegram for Assistance: At 2:00 PM, the station master of Linping Station telegraphed the engine plant in Zhapu and the three workshops of the Shanghai Engine and Vehicle Works, as well as all relevant personnel of the railway, reporting the incident and requesting the prompt dispatch of a rescue train.</p>
<p>▲Passenger Trains Delayed: Following the incident, the 7th express train bound for Shanghai, which departed from Zhapu at 3:50 PM, was detained at Kuanqiao Station. The 9th overnight express train bound for Shanghai, which departed from Zhapu at 5:40 PM, was also detained at Jianqiao Station. The 6th slow train bound for Hangzhou from Shanghai, which departed at 9:20 AM, was detained at Xucun Station. All of these trains will be able to pass only after the damaged tracks at Linping Station are repaired.</p>
<p>▲Engine Plant Dispatches Rescue Train: At 2:47 PM, Chen Mingshou, director of the engine plant at Zhapu Station, accompanied by Jiang Shenghua of the Hangzhou Section of the Engineering Department, Mr. Ding Mengshi (transliteration), a Westerner and head of the Traffic Department, and Huang Shousong, the station affairs inspector, led more than 30 employees of the engine and engineering departments on a special train, carrying a crane, jacks, rails, and all necessary equipment. Upon arriving at Linping, Chen Mingshou, Jiang Shenghua, and others consulted and decided to lay a temporary track next to the siding in order to use jacks to first move the derailed locomotive water tank. After the damaged track is repaired, the derailed front end of the locomotive will be jacked back onto the track. The repair is expected to be completed and traffic restored by 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>▲Tracks Now Repaired: The 7th express train and the 9th overnight express train that departed from Hangzhou for Shanghai today were both detained at Jianqiao. At approximately 8:00 PM, the track at Linping was reported to have been repaired, and the two passenger trains were connected and departed from Jianqiao. It is estimated that they will arrive in Shanghai at approximately 1:00 AM tomorrow (5th). The 6th slow train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, which was detained at Xucun Station, also departed from Xucun at the same time. All of the above passenger trains are delayed by more than five hours. All freight trains in both directions will have to wait until tomorrow to reach their respective stations.</p>
<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Detailed Report on the Rampant Bandits in Jinshan: The bandit leaders Taibao A Shu, Zhuluo A Mei, Lu Yaosheng, and Wang A Jiu are the "Four King Kongs" of the Jinshan gang of bandits. They have over a thousand men under their command, with Jinshanwei, Qianjiaxu, and Nanlu being their main bases. All towns and villages in Jinshan have been looted, with some towns being looted three or four times. Even farmers who barely have enough to eat have not been spared. Each month, these gangs of bandits also openly loot in Songjiang and Pinghu, returning fully loaded with spoils and dividing the loot without any hesitation. Recently, the major and minor leaders have been forcibly taking captured women from good families as their wives and concubines. Last month, bandit leader Lu Yaosheng hosted a banquet for a concubine that one of his bandits had taken. A bandit scout reported that two petty thieves had been captured for impersonating bandits and extorting money. Lu was furious and ordered them to be executed. As his men were pushing them out to be bound, a small number of soldiers passed by on patrol. Fearing that the situation would be exposed, Lu released the two petty thieves. It is said that the internal organization of the various gangs is very tight. In addition to the bandit leader serving as commander, there are ranks of division commander, battalion commander, staff officer, and secretary. Gu, the secretary of Taibao A Shu, was the secretary-general of Li Yi'e two years ago. They are also well-supplied with firearms, including machine guns and Mauser pistols, which are secretly smuggled back from Shanghai in successive shipments. Last autumn, the rice crop in the county was excellent, but due to the impact of the slogan "Do Not Return Rent," landowners have moved away, leaving the fields unattended. The county magistrate is only concerned with protecting the county government, and ignores the banditry in the countryside. Although the county is garrisoned by an army, with one battalion and one company stationed, they are unfamiliar with the area and people, and cannot capture any bandits even if they want to conduct a large-scale search.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the 30th of last month, a gang of over a hundred bandits suddenly arrived in Ganxiang Town, which belongs to Jinshan County. They first seized weapons from the Public Security Bureau, and then claimed to borrow 18,000 yuan from the pawnshops and rice shops, demanding that the money be delivered to the Qilong Temple, three miles from the town, within three days. The township head of the town's district government and the head of the Public Security Bureau went to the county the next day to ask for instructions, but returned disappointed as the county government was helpless. They also consulted with the water police, but they refused to go as they had not received orders from above. There are no wealthy households in the town, so how can such a large sum be raised? The entire town is in a state of fear, and faces certain death.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Case of Neglect of Duty by the Head of the Defense Corps: On the evening of July 1st of last year, Cai Guoqing, the driver of Cai Xiong-yao, head of the Beicai Town Defense Corps in Nanhui County, reported to the corps headquarters that there was a counterfeiting operation in the Zhang family ancestral hall nearby. Cai Xiong-yao immediately led over ten members of the defense corps to search the hall, along with the head of the Xueqiao Township Defense Corps. Upon arriving at the destination, because the Zhang family ancestral hall was quiet, they did not enter, and soon returned to town. On the outskirts of town, they apprehended He Bingyuan and Shi Xiaogou, two individuals with suspicious appearances, and interrogated them briefly. As the interrogation revealed no connection to the crime, they were released the next morning. Tang Zhilian, a resident of the town, learned of the incident and suspected that Cai Xiong-yao had been bribed to release the suspects. She filed a complaint with the Nanhui County government. The county government summoned Cai to the county government for questioning and took him into custody. In November, he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Cai refused to accept the judgment and retained lawyer Pan Chenge to appeal to the High Court. Yesterday (4th), the Third Criminal Court heard the case and announced the end of the debate, with a verdict scheduled for the 9th of this month.</p>
<p>A Reactionary Commits Himself to the High Court: Cao Qiheng, a 21-year-old woman from Jiangdu, worked at the Qingzhenghui (Youth Rectification Society) in Jiangdu in 1929. After the Qingzhenghui ceased operations, she studied at Yangzhou High School. Cao Qiheng had an older brother named Cao Qijin, who joined the Communist Party in 1927. He forced his younger sister Qiheng to join as well. At the time, Qiheng was forced to join because she was unable to resist her brother. Later, Qijin fled due to increased surveillance and has not returned home. After her brother left, Cao Qiheng realized her mistake and came to Suzhou yesterday (4th) to commit herself to the High Court. Zhu, the prosecutor of the High Court Procuratorate, immediately opened a trial to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Successive Water and Land Robberies Occurring During This Winter Defense Period, Robberies Are Rampant in Rural Areas. Unexpectedly, Yesterday, Three Robberies Occurred Continuously on Water and Land: (1) Pu Renbao, a resident of Gu Xi, Nanfangquan, District 14, makes a living by farming and also works as a pig trader. Last month, he hired a boat, loaded dozens of large pigs, and transported them to Dongting Xishan for sale. After selling them all, Pu Renbao, to avoid the danger of bandits in the lake, carried the money and took a steamer to Suzhou, then transferred to a train to return to Wuxi. Zhang Apei, on the other hand, sailed back to Wuxi yesterday. Unexpectedly, when he reached the area near Jiaozhu in Taihu Lake, two bandit boats suddenly appeared, and more than twenty Hunan bandits jumped out, holding several box cannons. They boarded the boat and searched it, robbing two cotton quilts, two silver dollars, and two fur coats belonging to a passenger named Jia. (2) The home of the widow Hua Chen in Xiaoqiao Tou, Nanyan City, was suddenly visited by three bandits at about 2 a.m. last night. Each of them carried a handgun and a flashlight. They broke into the house and robbed three gold bracelets, more than ten silver bracelets, and ten leather jackets, worth about 500 silver dollars. (3) Wang, a mechanic from Nanqiao Town, Yangming Township, came to the city to shop yesterday. At about 4 p.m., he was walking back to his hometown when, unexpectedly, when he reached the Xianli Dun Bridge, three thugs suddenly chased after him from behind, blocked his way, pulled out handguns, and searched his entire body. They robbed a wallet containing 84 silver dollars. After getting the loot, the thugs scurried away. Inspector Zhou Runshi Was Arrested in the Town. Zhou Runshi, a police inspector specially sent to Wuxi by the Civil Affairs Department, stayed at the New World Hotel, frequented prostitutes, and was also involved in a case of adultery and abduction of Shen Xiang's concubine, a local resident. It is now known that after Zhou Runshi fled Suzhou, he went to Zhenjiang the day before yesterday (the 2nd). At about 10 a.m., Zhou went to the Police Academy outside the South Gate to see the principal, Wang Dasui, expressed his remorse, and requested that the case be made up. Principal Wang was furious and immediately rebuked him severely. He also reported the matter to Hu, the head of the Civil Affairs Department, by telephone and asked for instructions. Minister Hu, according to the phone call, instructed to have Zhou watched and escorted to the department for investigation. At 11 a.m., Principal Wang escorted Zhou to the Civil Affairs Department. Minister Hu immediately issued an order to have the provincial guard watch over him. At 4 p.m., Zhai Hongda, a member of the Third Section of the Civil Affairs Department, brought Zhou out for questioning. Zhou confessed that he had indeed frequented prostitutes at the New World Hotel in Wuxi, introduced by Wang Chongxi, the director of the Eighth Sub-bureau. After finishing his official business, he went to Suzhou, where Qin Enrui, a member of the Third Sub-bureau, bought the train ticket for him. After arriving in Suzhou, he met Zhou Xingzhen. Because of their hometown relationship, they were acquainted. She said that she had left home in a fit of anger because of a family quarrel. He took her to the Dongwu Hotel, but there was no case of adultery or abduction. After the interrogation, he was sent back into custody. Minister Hu of the Civil Affairs Department believed that since Zhou Runshi had been arrested, he should be brought to justice as soon as possible. Therefore, he specially telegraphed Pan, the county magistrate of this county, ordering him to immediately summon all the witnesses and bring them to the court for questioning. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Pan immediately instructed Director Xu of the Public Security Bureau to comply. After receiving the order, Director Xu dispatched police officers yesterday (the 4th) afternoon to summon the plaintiff Shen Xiang, Zhou Xingzhen, and the local prostitute Wang Lihong to the bureau to await transfer to the county. However, Wang Chongxi, the director of the Eighth Sub-bureau, and Qin Enrui, a member of the Third Sub-bureau, had to wait until Zhou Runshi was escorted to Wuxi before they could be summoned for questioning. As for Wang Shiyi, the patrol officer of the Third Public Security Bureau of Suzhou, who was suspected of showing favoritism and privately releasing Zhou Runshi, it was feared that he would also have to be summoned for questioning when necessary. In addition, after the case occurred, Director Xu of the Public Security Bureau believed that Wang Chongxi and Qin Enrui, as public security personnel, dared to engage in debauchery and frequent prostitutes, and specially submitted a report to the county government for approval. County Magistrate Pan, after receiving the report, issued a reply yesterday, saying, "Having read the report, Wang Chongxi should be dismissed from his position in advance. The vacancy is approved to be filled by Zhou Jiashan returning to his post, and the date of replacement should be reported for investigation. The officer and Qin Enrui are both incumbent police officers, but they are engaging in debauchery and frequenting prostitutes, and do not know how to restrain themselves. It is extremely absurd and should be submitted to the Civil Affairs Department for punishment to set an example."</p>
<p>Four Suicide Cases in One Day In recent days, suicide cases have been heard frequently in this county. The reasons are mostly economic pressure or quarrels, leading to anger and resentment. Unexpectedly, four suicide cases occurred again the day before yesterday. The details are as follows: (1) Yan Bingjun, a resident of Zhaimen, about five miles north of Zhangjingqiao Town, District 7 (Huai Shang), was 21 years old. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he married A'da (21 years old), the daughter of the late Yuan Qingchen of Hetangqiao in the same district, through a matchmaker. After she entered the family, the couple were on good terms. Recently, Bingjun's elder sister, Xiudi, suddenly had a disagreement with her sister-in-law, Yuan, at home. She then sowed discord in front of Bingjun, causing quarrels between the couple from time to time. Yuan, filled with anger and resentment, suddenly had the idea of ​​ending her life. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at about 8 o'clock, she hanged herself in the room without anyone knowing. (2) Wang, the wife of Zhao Xiangbao, a villager in Zhaojiatang, about two miles northwest of Zhangjingqiao Town in the same district, who was in her twenties, suddenly hanged herself after quarreling with her aunt the day before yesterday. (3) Zhang Yunquan, also known as Yongquan, the owner of the Xieheshun clothing store at the south end of Shengxiang Bridge in the city, was already in his sixties. His wife, Tong, had two sons who were already married. Tong was naturally fierce and often had disputes with her two daughters-in-law. Yunquan often sided with his daughters-in-law, which caused quarrels between the couple from time to time. Yunquan, out of anger, suddenly had the idea of ​​committing suicide. On the day before yesterday, he swallowed several qian of raw opium and several bottles of sedative water. By the time it was noticed, it was too late to save him. (4) Wang Sixi, a 17-year-old apprentice at Lisheng Tea and Preserved Fruit Shop on Tongyun Road outside Guangfu Gate, also swallowed two pieces of red arsenic and four pieces of white arsenic on the morning of the day before yesterday for some unknown reason. After the shop owner noticed, he immediately sent him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, and he was able to turn the corner.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>An Elderly Man with White Hair Was Assassinated. The body of an elderly man with white hair was found in a wheat field in Lujia Yao Feng, Xiaping Bridge, outside the East Gate of the First District of Wuyi County. There were six or seven knife wounds on the top of his head, and his brains were flowing out. Three days later, the district office reported it to the County Court Procuratorate. Yang Kongxi, the chief prosecutor, led the inspection officials to examine the body. The examination confirmed that he died from multiple knife wounds. He ordered the local security chief to prepare a coffin for the body and instructed the police to investigate the criminal involved in the case.</p>
<p>The Knife Society is Dissolved. Recently, many Knife Society groups have been discovered in various townships of Wuyi County. After Zhang, the county magistrate, learned about this, he raised the issue for discussion at the district chief meeting on the 2nd. It was decided that the county government would issue a notice to dissolve them. If there was any resistance, it would be resolved by force. Today (the 4th), the county government has implemented the decision.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>The Zhenhu Provincial Road is Re-routed. The originally planned route of the Zhenhu Provincial Road entered the country through Taicang County, passed outside the West Gate to Nanxiang, and then reached Shanghai in the southeast. A few days ago, Qiu Xijue, the director of the County Construction Bureau, took a car to the province to discuss with the provincial department. It was heard that the Taicang-Jiading section would follow the originally planned route and construction would begin soon. The provincial government also felt that the planned route for the Jiading-Shanghai section was not very appropriate. Director Qiu had already determined another route, bypassing the North Gate from the West Gate and connecting with the Jialuo Motor Road to reach Shanghai directly. He submitted it to the provincial department for approval, and the instruction has been received for approval.</p>
<p>The Xu Cheng Road is Extended Northward. The road between Xuhang and Chengqiao in the eastern township was dilapidated. Previously, Deng Weixin and Lu Jianru and others initiated the repaving of the cobblestone road, which has been completed. The road between Xuhang and Liuhe is also rugged and narrow, making travel inconvenient. Now, fundraising is also underway to extend it northward. It is heard that it will first be built to Tanshiqiao, which will cost about a thousand silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Bandits Attempt to Rob the Seventh District Town. The Seventh District of this county is adjacent to Huadang, and bandits often come and go. Last month, four families were robbed. In order to repair the fold after the sheep were stolen, the Public Security Bureau immediately added 20 water police officers and dispatched three patrol boats from Wangshi to station in the southern countryside. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 p.m. on the 2nd, more than a dozen boats approached from Huadang and landed at Shenbang, intending to rob the Jin Shaofu family there. When the bandits arrived, a large boat guided them and blew a police whistle as a signal. The bandits had box cannons, handguns, rifles, and short knives. After landing, they fired several shots as a show of force. However, the villagers there were wary after the last major robbery. Moreover, the time was still early, and the villagers had not yet gone to bed. Suddenly hearing gunshots, they knew that something had happened and immediately beat gongs to warn everyone. Unexpectedly, the bandits still did not retreat and fired more densely. At this time, they were heard by the defense forces of the district, who rushed out to fight back. The bandits then returned to their boats. The civilians also used telephones to call for reinforcements from neighboring villages such as Lianqi, Xin'an, and Mocheng, and asked them to set off to encircle and suppress the bandits. After receiving the calls, each village advanced toward Shenbing. However, the bandit boats had already escaped into the lake. One of the bandit boats suddenly encountered an armed group from the timber raft depot, and both sides exchanged several shots. As a result, the bandit boats turned and fled into Zhou Dang (Suzhou territory).</p>
<p>The County Annals are Re-edited. The county annals of this county were previously edited by Ding Zuyin (Zhisun), a local resident. After Ding's death last year, there was no one to take charge of the editing. The county government believed that the county annals could not be suspended and appointed Xu Zhaowei, a historian, to continue the editing. Xu has agreed.</p>

An order was issued to abolish the establishment.</p>
<p>The Liang Department Established an Inspection Office. Liang Guanying, the commander of the Twenty-fifth Route, dispatched his troops to Tongzhou for pacification. Because Tongzhou was located on the river and sea, and bandits could easily come and go, he appointed Zhu Guoheng as the director of the Tongzhou Inspection Office. The office was located at Xisi Temple in the south of the city. Inspection teams were stationed at various ports and key passes.</p>
<p>The County Government Investigated and Reported Political Prisoners Eligible for Amnesty.

The Su Wolf Soldiers Field Requested Instructions for Handling. The Ministry of Military Affairs ordered the county government to follow the National Government's order and first order the Tonghai Reclamation Company to pay the price for encroaching on the Suzhen Langshan two battalion soldiers fields. If they were unwilling to comply, it should be auctioned and closed.

<p>The Public Property of the Tax Bureau after the Abolition of Li Tax.

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Elementary School Strike Has Not Yet Been Resolved. The strike for wages in Jiangdu has been brewing for three weeks. As of today (the 3rd), there is still no news of resumption of classes. It is recently heard that the county government has reached the end of its rope in terms of fundraising. Beyond two and a half months, there is really no surplus capacity to raise more funds. The principals of the schools in the urban area also realize that this matter is not easy to resolve satisfactorily. Therefore, the principals of each school are raising funds separately. It is recently heard that the principals of each school can raise about 3,000 yuan. If this money is raised, the urban area can issue half a month's salary more. Then, the principals of each school will separately communicate with the teachers in their respective districts to start classes first. However, the Teachers Association suddenly sent a letter to the Principals Association today, stating that there were still points to be considered regarding the treatment issue. The letter said, "Because the two issues of arrears in salary and treatment have not been satisfactorily resolved, the association unanimously decided on February 2 to submit a letter of resignation to the Principals Association. Of course, the classwork section cannot be responsible. It is hoped that all colleagues will adhere to their original intentions and unite as one." Whether classes can be resumed this week is still unknown.</p>

Unexpectedly, he received a telegram from Nanjing in Cixi yesterday, saying that Mo Dehui was expected to arrive in Beijing on the 3rd. Therefore, Foreign Minister Wang was scheduled to rush back to Nanjing today (the 3rd) to discuss the Sino-Russian incident with Mo.</p>
<p>Ningbo Merchants Oppose the Increase in Freight Charges by the Four Wheel Company. Ningbo commercial organizations believe that this time, the Sanbei Merchants Taikoo Ningshao Four Wheel Shipping Company, under the pretext of adding a convoy, not only increased passenger freight charges but also increased round-trip cargo freight charges by 20%, which is actually taking advantage of the name to seek profits. Moreover, freight charges had already been increased once last year, so it is impossible to agree to another increase this time. Therefore, the commercial organizations decided to express their opposition at the Commercial Statistics Conference yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Records of Robbery Cases. In Hejin Pier, Xixiang, Yin County, the family of Lu Quanlin, a resident, was suddenly visited by five bandits the night before last.

<h3>Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Xu Peihuang, Completes Oath of Office</h3>
<p>Xu Peihuang, the director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, officially appointed by the National Government, completed his oath of office ceremony at the bureau yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, more than a month after his appointment.</p>
<p>▲ Attendees included Gu Shusen, a special representative from the Ministry of Education, who administered the oath; Mayor Zhang Yuejun, who also attended to give instructions; Tong Xingbai, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters; Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee; university presidents Hu Shuhua, Li Zhaohuan, Wang Jingqi, Liu Zhanen, Chu Fucheng, and Ou Yuanhuai; section chiefs and counselors from the Municipal Government Secretariat; bureau chiefs from various bureaus; school principals; representatives from various organizations; and guests, totaling over 400 people, creating a grand occasion. Mayor Zhang served as the chairman, and Yao Gengkui and Chen Duanzhi served as recorders.</p>
<p>▲ Order of the Ceremony: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Bow three times to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the late Premier; (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) The oath administrator takes their seat, and the director takes their seat; (6) The mayor presents the seal, and the director receives the seal; (7) The director takes the oath; (8) The oath administrator delivers instructions; (9) Guests give speeches; (10) The director gives a response; (11) Photography; (12) Ceremony concludes with refreshments.</p>
<p>▲ Excerpts from the instructional speech of Gu Yinting from the Ministry of Education: "I am very honored to represent the Ministry of Education in attending Director Xu's inauguration ceremony. Shanghai, as the largest city in the country, has various facilities that attract attention both domestically and internationally. Therefore, Shanghai's education is not only the central hub of the country but should also hold a significant position worldwide. According to educational principles, the education of a metropolis differs from that of ordinary cities or villages. First, attention should be paid to the physical and mental well-being of children because the rapid advancement of industries in the metropolis leads to societal changes. Without careful planning, they often go astray. Major European and American metropolises devote all their efforts to social education for this reason. Take Chicago, for example, which has over seventy elementary schools and public sports fields throughout the city, as well as small parks, small libraries, swimming pools, etc., all distributed throughout the city. This is to ensure that children with vigorous minds and bodies can receive education beyond school education and be introduced to public places for training to avoid the disadvantages of intermittent effort. Secondly, in addition to implementing general education, attention should be paid to special education. Attention should be paid to gifted children, as well as to children with low abilities. Mixed education harms both groups. Thirdly, general schools should pay attention to vocational training so that graduates can cope with urban life. Most importantly, it is necessary to implement the Three Principles of the People education, incorporating the late Premier's teachings into various course materials to create a central ideology. As for reorganizing private schools that promote reactionary ideas through education or those that use education for commercial purposes, they should all be banned. In short, in managing Shanghai's education, one must respond to global trends and consider the special environment. Director Xu has served in the education sector and has worked in the municipal government for many years. He will surely make efforts and contributions to Shanghai's education in the future," and so on.</p>
<p>▲ Excerpts from Mayor Zhang's instructional speech: "I have little experience in education, but every time I participate in various conferences of our Party, I always see that many proposals and declarations relate to education. This shows the Central Government's emphasis on education. I remember that in the political report of the Third National Congress of our Party, there was a passage on education that keenly pointed out the shortcomings of the time. In today's education sector, whether it is students, teachers, school administrators, or administrative staff, everyone feels dissatisfied. Administrative staff are dissatisfied with school administrators, school administrators are dissatisfied with teachers, teachers are dissatisfied with students, students are dissatisfied with schools, and schools are dissatisfied with administrative staff. In this situation of mutual dissatisfaction, the effectiveness of education cannot be seen. Originally, in today's environment, the old cultural foundation has collapsed, and a new cultural foundation has not yet been established. Education has encountered "six difficulties": administration is difficult, funding is difficult, running schools is difficult, finding teachers is difficult, studying is difficult, and advancing to higher education is difficult—everything is difficult. Consequently, there are "four evils": first, education has become a tool for personal gain; second, the result of education is not only the failure to cultivate talent but also the suppression of talent; third, the result of running schools is not only the failure to increase the desire to study but also the possibility of not needing to study; fourth, society has created more unemployed benefit-seekers, causing the country's vitality to be greatly lost. Furthermore, these four evils lead to "three harms": harming individuals, harming society, and harming the country. What kind of outcome will this lead to? Although this is not to say that every school is like this, it is enough to make us vigilant. Therefore, the Third Plenary Session decided to establish the Three Principles of the People as the sole educational purpose of our country. The fundamental issue lies in establishing the culture of the Three Principles of the People, and only then can we promote national prosperity, universal civil rights, and the construction of people's livelihood, achieving concrete results. So, today, I offer this idea as a contribution, hoping that Director Xu can follow this direction to promote the city's education. Director Xu has served in the municipal government for many years and has a proven track record in the education sector. As the head of the Education Bureau, he will surely恪遵 the oath and strive to realize the education of the Three Principles of the People," and so on.</p>
<p>▲ In his speech, Tong Xingbai, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, stated, "Our city has a vast area. I hope Director Xu will focus on the overall development, especially emphasizing rural education and labor education," and so on. Next, Hu Shuhua, Chu Fucheng, Wang Yun, and other gentlemen gave speeches. Due to their length, they are omitted here.</p>
<p>▲ Director Xu's reply: "I, Peihuang, have been specially appointed by the Mayor and appointed by the National Government to serve as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. Today, at my oath of office, I am honored to have the representative of the Ministry of Education and the Mayor present to supervise and give instructions, and I have also received guidance from the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and representatives from other organizations and guests. Their words are heartfelt, and their teachings to Peihuang are very generous, and their expectations of Peihuang are also very high. After listening respectfully, I am both grateful and ashamed. I especially apologize for the cramped meeting hall and the inadequate reception, which has caused many oversights. Peihuang hereby sincerely accepts everyone's instructions, vows to follow them with all my strength, and earnestly implements them. I will also briefly present my development plan for the city's education to everyone, hoping for your correction and guidance: (1) One of the most important tasks for the Bureau at present is to reorganize existing undertakings. The Bureau has had frequent changes in leadership in the past three and a half years. Although the Bureau's work has progressed year by year, the superficiality of its effectiveness and the confusion of its threads are undeniable. The way to reorganize is to grasp the key points—the so-called 'to shake a garment, one must lift its collar; to raise one's eyes, one must grasp the rope.' Summarizing what is currently underway, there are several aspects as follows:</p>
<p>A. "Nimble communication between the Bureau and its affiliated organizations." The Bureau's affiliated organizations, considering only the municipal primary and secondary schools and community schools, already number more than 290. Previously, relations were scattered, and communication was minimal. Usually, there was little interaction outside of official business. Peihuang is now striving to improve this, aiming to make the relationship between the Bureau and the schools like that between a family and its children, becoming increasingly close so that in the event of an accident, they are as interconnected as a hand directing an arm or an arm directing a finger, with no more concern about separation, just as the ancients said, 'Those who are high in the hall and far from the curtain must ensure that they absolutely no longer exist.' The Bureau, based on this intention, in addition to increasing inspections, also makes the heads and principals of each affiliated organization meet and talk with the staff of the Bureau to communicate and break down the previous sense of separation, and in terms of handling affairs, it also strives for speed so that everything is communicated, and no cases are left unresolved.</p>
<p>B. "Performance evaluation of various undertakings." All undertakings value specialization, so it's important to know whether the handling of undertakings is appropriate and the level of performance in handling undertakings is high or low. In terms of undertakings, this can be used as a model; in terms of those handling undertakings, this can also be used for reward and punishment. The use of performance evaluation is not only for passive warning but also for active guidance. The Bureau's undertakings are very tight, and its duties are especially heavy. Peihuang views the development of undertakings as its sole responsibility, holding the purpose of choosing people for tasks, so that undertakings concentrate their strength and increase their effectiveness. With no wasted talent, there is no wasted work. With no wasted work, success can be achieved quickly. The Bureau is currently operating in this spirit in various businesses. Perhaps the drawbacks of leakage can be washed away.</p>
<p>C. "Increasing the efficiency of internal and external affairs." The efficiency of handling various affairs is high, resulting in twice the results with half the effort, with fewer people and less cost. Low efficiency results in half the results with twice the effort, with more people and greater cost. However, to increase efficiency, those above must supervise and encourage, and those below must work hard, viewing public affairs as private. The Bureau is now working in this spirit, aiming to increase the efficiency of internal and external affairs. The performance evaluation of various undertakings mentioned earlier also aims to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>D. "All undertakings must conform to regulations." The purpose of setting up regulations is to enable people to follow them and to ensure that operations have fixed standards to avoid the drawbacks of disorder. If there are regulations but they are not followed, then the regulations are equal to virtual settings, and handling affairs without following the track will inevitably lose its effect. This not only does not conform to the method of scientific management but also does not adapt to the current world trend. What's more, work efficiency will also be reduced, which runs counter to the purpose of increasing efficiency. Therefore, the Bureau will ensure that everything follows the regulations from now on. Regulations are like models, and work is like utensils that have not yet been manufactured. The utensils must be made to match the model, with no difference. If there are regulations that do not conform to the facts, methods should be devised to change them, and there should be no violation. The Bureau strictly adheres to this idea and must seek to ensure that everything is performed according to the truth. In short, in terms of internal and external work, every amount of money must have the effect of that amount, and all the schools and businesses run by the Bureau must be rationalized and scientific. Thus, the school and the business are not worth the burden of the entrustment and the expectations.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to reorganization work, there are also several aspects that are already underway or should be started soon:</p>
<p>A. "Regarding general education." The foundation of the Party and the nation is extremely important, and education is paramount. After the Fourth Plenary Session, the Central Government paid special attention to improving national education. Shanghai, as the center of national education, should follow the educational purpose of the Central Government, which has also been expected by the government and the municipal government, to realize various plans and affairs.</p>
<p>(1) Make the Three Principles of the People permeate the city's education. The Three Principles of the People are the crystallization of the Premier's lifelong revolution to save the country, all-encompassing and all-embracing, and the educational purpose of the Three Principles of the People has also been determined by the government as the sole goal of pursuing education. However, empty words are difficult to be effective. If the true spirit of the principles is not recognized, then the principles cannot be realized. The education sector, having the duty of enlightening the pre-conscious, should especially take the Three Principles of the People as the central belief and set an example to promote their realization so that both teachers and students can have a firm belief and practice them in person, so that they can work together to build the education of the Three Principles of the People. If those who run the city's education can all have the central belief of the Three Principles of the People, then the city's education can have a great development. Only those who can implement it themselves can bear this important responsibility, and leading students can seek to rectify the school spirit and make schools into training places with principles, order, and discipline. Therefore, the Bureau currently focuses on instilling the Three Principles of the People, the late Premier's teachings, in general education. This is regarded as the most important work in the Bureau. In addition to this, what should also be emphasized are:</p>
<p>(2) Scientific education. Among the late Premier's teachings, he brilliantly instructed us to emulate Western methods not by learning their politics, literature, customs, etc., but by learning their science. The world's civilization and the increase in human happiness all originate from the development of science. Only science is the most practical, not advocating empty talk, and using scientific methods to run businesses will inevitably be orderly, planned, and organized, unlike those that are chaotic and patch things up at any time. Therefore, the Bureau will especially focus on scientific education in general education. According to what Japanese educators have said in recent surveys, Japan's education focuses most on science, and the expenses used for scientific equipment account for the largest part of their teaching expenses. Compared to our country, the scientific education equipment of our country's universities is still lacking. A photo of Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, taking the oath of office (photographed by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>Is not as good as the equipment of their schools. The equipment of our country's middle schools is not as good as the equipment of their elementary schools. As for our country's elementary schools, they are even less worthy of discussion. How pitiful is this? Therefore, in addition to the Three Principles of the People education, the Bureau focuses on scientific education, striving to gradually add and complete the scientific education equipment in each school, so that even elementary school graduates can have common scientific knowledge. This is not only the most sufficient to increase the general knowledge of the people but also the most beneficial to improving the level of the national people.</p>
<p>(3) Compulsory education. Compulsory education is related to the life of the country and the survival of the nation. The total number of illiterate citizens in our country is over 90%, which is why the people's intelligence is narrow and the people's strength is weak. It is not only insufficient to compete with Europe, America, and Japan but also has infinite obstacles to the construction of the Party and the nation. Therefore, the Fourth Plenary Session attached great importance to compulsory education, which is a crucial plan. Although Shanghai's education is more developed than other places, according to surveys, the number of school-age children enrolled in the city is still less than half, so the promotion of compulsory education should not be delayed. However, to make education universal in the city, it is difficult to achieve without sufficient financial resources. Even if there is funding, it is difficult to find many teachers to run it effectively. Therefore, it is planned to follow the intentions of the Fourth Plenary Session and pilot compulsory education in the Lujiazui district, which has been approved by the Ministry of Education and the municipal government, and then gradually promote it to all districts in the city in the future.</p>
<p>(4) Physical education. Our country has been weak for a long time, and the lack of development of physical education is a reason. The physical education business in the city has made considerable progress in recent years, but I still think it is insufficient. I deeply feel that past physical education businesses have been too focused on students in middle schools and above. In the future, we should strive to make it universal and take elementary schools as the basic training place. Therefore, the Bureau is actively planning the expansion of sports fields and the holding of other physical education businesses.</p>
<p>B. Regarding social education. Social education increases the people's intelligence, nourishes morality, cultivates good citizens, and improves the level of society. Its nature is similar to compulsory education, but compulsory education is limited to children of school age, while social education is mass education, so its impact and effect are even deeper and greater. The Bureau is currently planning three things: (1) After detailed planning in the 19th year, reorganize and expand various community schools and supplementary schools starting from the 20th year to help promote compulsory education; (2) Places for citizens' entertainment are very important. The Fourth Plenary Session has passed a resolution, which has been handed over to the Ministry of Education of the National Government for earnest implementation. Therefore, the Bureau is actively working on the construction of art galleries, concert halls, libraries, museums, and zoos in the Confucius Temple. However, the Bureau's financial and ability are limited, and it deeply hopes that the government and all sectors will provide assistance so that it can be completed as soon as possible; (3) Movies are the greatest auxiliary product of social education, but if they are not used well, they can also become the greatest harm. Recently, there have been more and more events that offend customs and violate the law, and although the reasons are not limited to one end, the influence of movies has also had a great impact. In view of this, the Bureau, in its position of duty, cannot tolerate its horizontal flow and collapse. Therefore, in terms of active improvement, it plans to formulate rules for the production of social education films and request the municipal government and the central government to stipulate award methods. In terms of negative prohibition, it plans to work with relevant bureaus to strictly prohibit the showing of bad Chinese and foreign films or cut them.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two points that the Bureau is also carrying out as part of its policy:</p>
<p>(1) Rewarding and banning private schools. There are so many school-age children in Shanghai, and the municipal treasury's expenses are limited and cannot set up more schools to accommodate them, so we have to rely on private schools to help and make up for the shortcomings of municipal schools. Therefore, the Bureau plans to formulate reward methods for those private schools that have achieved results so that they know where to work hard. Those that have not yet been registered will be urged to improve and register so that they can work together under a consistent education administration system. Those that use schools to earn money and run them corruptly will have to be banned so that society will not be harmed by them. This will reduce the number of illiterates in the positive aspect and destroy the pits that mislead young people in the negative aspect.</p>
<p>(2) Recouping the education rights in the concessions. The Bureau attaches great importance to the education rights in the concessions. The annual income of the Public Concession is three times greater than that of the municipal government, but the expenses for Chinese children's education are very small, and the schools are not in accordance with the Chinese education laws and regulations. The French Concession is also like this. The concession authorities despise Chinese education and ignore Chinese sovereignty. The Bureau cannot ignore this, so it is planning to actively negotiate and will not stop until the goal of recouping is achieved.</p>
<p>The above are the outlines of the Bureau's business plan. It will now first formulate this policy outline and then proceed in order, or advance simultaneously, to ensure that each is realized. This is not only Peihuang's great wish to improve and develop Shanghai's education but also hopes to comfort the central government, the municipal government, and all sectors of society. I am very honored to have you all come together today. I use these words as a voucher for the Bureau's future work and hope that you will give me your advice from time to time.</p>

<h3>A Laughable Matter by Haike</h3>
<p>A: You have lunch at C Restaurant every day. How is their food? Is it cooked well?</p>
<p>B: The cooking is not bad. But they treat the chickens and ducks too well. It seems unfair to the general diners.</p>
<p>A: What's going on?</p>
<p>B: They raise chickens and ducks and can't bear to kill them when they are young. They only kill them when they are old. So their mustard chicken and braised duck are all highly respected elders.</p>
<p>A's Wife: My husband is really a blunderer. He is very careless about everything.</p>
<p>B's Wife: How careless?</p>
<p>A's Wife: Just look at the buttons on his clothes. They often fall off. I sew one on, and another one falls off.</p>
<p>B's Wife (shaking her head): Maybe you used too little thread when you sewed them on. Maybe you didn't sew them on very firmly.</p>
<p>A's Wife (shaking her head): Huh. That's none of my business. He sews them on himself.</p>
<p>A: What's in your little bag?</p>
<p>B: It's a poison.</p>
<p>A (feigning surprise): Ah. You bought poison. What for?</p>
<p>B: Don't be scared. It's a rat poison. Rats die as soon as they eat it.</p>
<p>A: Ah. I see. So you're tired of living. You're preparing to commit suicide.</p>
<h3>The Wusheng Pass Tunnel on the Pinghan Railway by Tan Shenyu</h3>
<p>Wusheng Pass belongs to Yingshan County, Hubei Province, bordering Henan. The terrain is mountainous and strategically important. When the Pinghan Railway was built during the late Qing Dynasty, due to the height of the mountains making it difficult to level, a tunnel was dug through them. The tunnel is more than sixteen li long, and it takes fifteen minutes for a train to pass through. Every traveler who has traveled on the Pinghan Railway knows about the Wusheng Pass tunnel. However, the tunnel was originally built to facilitate transportation, but who would have known that countless innocent people would die unjustly within it? Since the founding of the Republic of China, wars have been frequent, and the people in the war zones have suffered the most. In order to escape to other places, many find it convenient to take trains. However, during wartime, the railway is too busy transporting military vehicles to have time for passenger trains. Therefore, every train station is filled with refugees waiting for trains. Whenever a military train passes by, they rush to get on board. However, the train cars cannot possibly accommodate them all. Therefore, the weak cry and hate, while the strong climb onto the roof of the train. Because of their eagerness to escape, they do not listen to the strict prohibitions of the armed police (the train stations on the Pinghan Railway do not have fences and can be entered and exited freely, unlike the Jinghu Railway which is slightly more orderly, so the police cannot really prevent them). The tops of the train cars are often rounded and slippery. Due to the vibrations while the train is moving, very few manage to stay on. Furthermore, the Wusheng Pass tunnel was artificially constructed and is naturally not very high. It can only accommodate the body of the train. Nothing can be added on top of the train. Therefore, when the train arrives at Wusheng Pass, the refugees on the roof of the train are unaware of the danger of the tunnel. Those sitting on it will immediately hit the rocks on top of the tunnel and fall down. If they are not killed by the impact, they will certainly be crushed by the train.</p>
<h3>China's Most Expensive Book by Pan Shizhu</h3>
<p>A Book Worth One Hundred Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The Collected Works of Han Changli and Liu Hedong of the Shicai Hall are one of the few surviving Song Dynasty editions. They have always been valued by collectors. The paper used by the Shicai Hall is of even texture and has been soaked in pepper water, so it does not suffer from insect damage even after hundreds of years. Moreover, the characters are engraved with a Tang Dynasty flavor, making it even more beloved. Currently, the Han collection is with the Yang family of Haiyuan Pavilion, while the Liu collection is with Pan Mingxun, a Cantonese in Shanghai. Last year, the descendants of the Yang family transported twenty-six fine editions from Haiyuan Pavilion to Tianjin, and the Han collection was among them, with the intention of selling them. Pan, in order to complete the collection and not wanting the precious book to fall into the hands of the Japanese, contacted the descendants of the Yang family to purchase the Han collection. However, the Yang family said they would not sell it for less than one hundred thousand yuan, as the value of the book is truly commensurate with the price. Currently, negotiations have stalled due to the excessive price difference. It is unknown whether the book has been sold. It is hoped that it does not fall into the hands of the Japanese, which would be fortunate. There was once a rumor that someone intended to purchase all twenty-six editions for two hundred thousand yuan to preserve China's national essence. The intention is good, but I fear it is not so easy. (Que Chou)</p>
<p>During the campaign against Feng in the eighteenth year of the Republic, a refugee named Liu from Henan, with his entire family of five, wanted to escape to Hankou to avoid the war. They climbed onto the roof of a military vehicle at Xinyang Station. When the train reached Wusheng Pass, three of the five family members hit the rocks in the tunnel and fell down. Only an old man of about fifty or sixty years old and his granddaughter of about ten years old escaped this calamity because they were lying flat on the roof of the train. Otherwise, they would have perished as well. Many people in Henan and Hubei can tell this story. I used to serve in the military and also worked on the front lines during the campaign against Tang. After the victory, I returned to Wuhan by train with the troops. When passing through Wusheng Pass, I wanted to see the condition of the tunnel, so I brought a flashlight with me. When the train first entered the tunnel (at this time it was daytime), the train car was filled with smoke, which was the gas emitted from the locomotive. After entering the tunnel, it immediately became a world of darkness. You could not even see the person across from you. Then, I smelled a foul odor. So, I shined the flashlight out the train window. What I saw were piles of skeletons with severed heads and broken limbs. The foul odor came from corpses that had not been rotting for long. Although no one has investigated the number, in that brief moment, I saw more than ten bodies. So, over the years, how many innocent people seeking refuge from war have been buried in this tunnel? Alas! (Bu Shou Chou)</p>
<h3>Records of Bandit Troubles in Jiangxi Province Zheng</h3>
<p>In recent years, the banditry in Hunan and Jiangxi has been unprecedented. Of the seventy-plus counties in Jiangxi Province, the provincial government's orders can only reach a dozen or so. The trampling and poisoning suffered by the people are truly indescribable. A friend recently came from Jiangxi and told me a few things. So, I took up a pen to record them.</p>
<p>▲Throwing Human Heads in Trenches: The only policy of the bandits is to kill and burn. Therefore, there is a special team responsible for killing. Occasionally, when confronting the army, they throw hundreds of human heads at the opposing side. The army is invariably horrified when they see this. Their cruelty is such.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Hui Met a Tragic End: Zhang Huizan, the commander of the Nanchang Garrison and division commander, was very talented and resourceful. The preservation of the provincial capital was mostly due to Zhang's efforts. However, recently, Zhang led his troops on an expedition and encountered a group of refugees. When asked, they said they had escaped from the bandits' den. When asked about the situation of the bandits, they all said that the bandits were weak and that if they were pursued victoriously, it would not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Zhang believed them to be true. So, he personally led the remaining soldiers of his battalion to advance. Who knew that the bandits had lured them deep into the territory and then surrounded them? Zhang and two brigade commanders were captured. Only then did he realize that the refugees were all bandits. After the bandits captured Zhang, they subjected him to a so-called people's public trial. As a result, he was brutally disemboweled, and the provincial capital became even more precarious.</p>
<p>▲Mines Flooded: A friend operated a coal mine. The income from production each year was just enough to maintain it. However, as the bandits' power expanded, the mine was also occupied by the bandits. Later, they flooded it with water, saying, "Those who own mines must be rich people. We must destroy them." Thus, this mine worth hundreds of thousands of yuan was also sacrificed.</p>
<p>▲Family Massacred: A villager had four sons. One day, the villager was taken away by the bandits and sentenced to death. Upon hearing the news, the four sons went to the bandits' lair and said, "Our father is old. Please choose one of us four to replace him." The bandits said, "Good. Since you are all not afraid of death, then all of you can be executed." Thus, they were all killed together. Alas! What human tragedy is greater than this?</p>
<h3>Parisian Tales (23) Six Once Lived in Paris</h3>
<p>The most famous thing in the botanical garden is its labyrinth (Jabyrinthe) and science museum. The labyrinth is very cleverly constructed, making it difficult for people to find their way out after entering. The science museum is divided into several parts, including zoology, geology, mineralogy, etc. The specimens collected inside are extremely rich, and there are many rare things that cannot be seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>The botanical garden was founded in 1626, but the facilities were very simple before. It was not until the great naturalist and writer Buffon came to be the administrator that it was expanded to its current form. Buffon managed the botanical garden for nearly fifty years (1739-1788). He devoted almost all of his energy to his masterpiece "Natural History" (HistoireNaturelle) and this botanical garden. Now there is a bronze statue of him in the garden, and the house he used to live in is still preserved.</p>
<p>Every time I take a walk in the botanical garden, I often think back to when I was studying in Japan a few years ago, when I often went to the Koishikawa Botanical Garden in Tokyo. I love the scenery of the Koishikawa Botanical Garden, but the Koishikawa Botanical Garden does not have such a rich science museum as the Paris Botanical Garden. Among the several botanical gardens I have seen in Europe, I feel that the botanical garden in the capital of Belgium is very similar to the Paris Botanical Garden. But the size of the Belgian botanical garden is much smaller than that of the Paris Botanical Garden. Our country has plenty of open space, and the collection of plant specimens is ultimately easier than other scientific specimens. I hope that when I return to China in the future, I will be able to see a very beautiful botanical garden in our capital, with a very large natural history museum attached to it.</p>
<h3>Review of the Musical "Where is He Gone?" by Huang Hua</h3>
<p>Opera is popular in Western countries. This kind of opera does not only focus on singing and dancing, but also puts a lot of effort into the depiction of the plot. Looking back at the opera world in our country, due to its young qualifications and insufficient funds, it ends up being ambitious but unable to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>Newspapers have published that the Plum Blossom Opera Troupe has newly compiled a non-war opera called "Where is He Gone?", which is being performed at the Central, New Central, and Samsung theaters. As an attempt at opera, I went to see it. Examining its intention, it is generally about a conscript bidding farewell to his wife to go to war, and after a year, he returns seriously injured, only to find that his family is broken and his wife is dead. The last year's person is gone. It is set off by wild geese flying in formation when the husband and wife are separated, singing and dancing on the left and right, expressing that when humanity is inevitable, there will eventually be a day of separation, and we who live together day and night will never be separated by war. People are not as good as birds. The idea is still good. When the war breaks out, the people flee to avoid disaster, and there are many interjections. The husband calls his wife, the daughter calls her mother, and the old Buddha woman holds the Guanyin statue and chants Amitabha, etc., which is not out of line. The comic part is that a soldier is alone and has no one to say goodbye to, so he holds a portrait of a beautiful woman to comfort himself. As a result, he abandons the painting and competes with others for a piece of bread. The performance is excessive, and the idea focuses on the bread problem, which does not seem to be nonsense. Ms. Zhang Xianlin, who plays the wife, can express a sorrowful feeling when singing, but she fails to be thoroughly convincing when still. Huang Hunjun's soldier's appearance is not bad. His singing is too low. He should study the highs and lows of pronunciation. Ms. Qian Zhongxiu, Xu Canying, Cai Yiming, Gong Qiuxia, Zhang Qi, and Weng Lanhun play three pairs of geese, and their singing and dancing are all interesting. It is said that the rehearsal took a day. During the war, the flashing lights and music are harmonious. A model airplane flies from the top of the theater to the stage. Due to the lighting arrangement, it does not feel annoying. However, this is just a gimmick. In a word, if this script is more carefully revised, it should have value. In the era of the budding of Chinese opera, our vision should be a little lower. I hope that Mr. Wei Yingbo and Cai Wenjin, who co-edited this play, will work hard to cultivate this bud, so that Chinese stage opera can gradually move towards the path of light.</p>
<p>To Mr. A and B: Thank you for your letter. Most of the points you mentioned are already in the planning stage. I look forward to your face-to-face instructions.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (364) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 17: The Art of Staying Young: Emerald Eyebrows and Painted Eyebrows, No Way to Extend Life: Golden Market and Fine Bones</p>
<p>After Hua Yuanchun had this pair of beloved people, although she had eternal life and was indestructible, she was a little overwhelmed. The other guests were a bit mediocre and unworthy of mention. However, business must be done after all. Since you are in business, can you not sing in the hall? Can you not entertain and perfunctorily deal with guests? You don't want the people you like to spend too much money. So, if you don't attract a few of the wretched Awu Lin, how can your scene be supported? According to this statement, you have to make time to reward the patrons who pay the money with your body. Indeed, there is a group of guests who are willing to spend money on those silly girls, thinking that those people are romantically interesting. If they are too proper, it is the scene of a good family girl, not the duty of a prostitute. It's just that Hua Yuanchun is an economist, so it's fine. But she "uses flying money as flying money. It comes in from the east hand and goes out from the west hand." So, she later became like Mr. Wu Zhihui said, "The skin is wide, but the debt is tight." The debt platform is already high, and her body is a little weak. The creditors she owes are all old foreign money brokers in Shanghai, like the old A Bao and old A Xiu. Seeing her like this, they feel that there is no chance of her turning over. What they most hope is that Miss Six will make a few good guests and earn a few big tips. Not only will their principal and interest be there, but also the scraps of foreign money in the room can be looted more. Otherwise, the second hope is that Miss Six will marry a rich master and take out a few thousand yuan to give herself a bath from head to toe. Their money can be turned around. After a year or two, they can go to charm her to return to the industry like a ghost. Unexpectedly, Miss Six only does a bunch of pretty boys, and those pretty boys are not young masters, nor are they young masters of other people's families. They want to persuade her, but they can't persuade her. They want to stop her, but they can't stop her. She can't do other guests for long, and it's very difficult to marry. Not to mention that she is temporarily attached to them and unwilling to marry. When people inquire about this pair of dragging objects, who would want to marry her? The money lent to her can never be recovered. Later, everyone discussed, saying it would be better to instigate her to go out of the pier. Now there are many girls going south to Beijing and Tianjin. Because the masters in the south go to Beijing to be officials, they naturally like the girls in the south and don't like the girls in the north. I heard that someone went and picked up three thousand yuan in one night. Not to mention touching her body, they didn't even touch her hand. The adults are very generous. Miss Six's skills are not bad. It's just that she's been nailed down by these two enemies. If she leaves Shanghai, she might make a big tip and come back. Now A Jin, the big-bellied man from Qingyutang, is coming to Shanghai to pick up the young ladies. Let's talk to him.</p>

<p>New Developments in Commerce</p>
<h3>The Continued Surge in Financial Gold Prices</h3>
<p>▲Wild Gold Speculation Throughout the City Yesterday, the speculation in gold prices on the 4th of February was even more fierce than before. It even saw a shocking and unprecedented price, exceeding the 760 taels mark, breaking the previous record. However, the market was extremely chaotic, changing rapidly. Fluctuations of several taels were common, and people were unusually alarmed, finding it impossible to predict. Transactions in various firms were quite lively. Firms such as Yongheng, Xinheng, Tong Taichang, and Zhifeng Yong bought in (some sold short), while firms such as Taikang Run and Yuan Maoyong mostly sold. Overseas silver markets repeatedly fell, and the Shanghai foreign exchange market was also very tight, with the listed price shrinking by two and a half notches. Some foreign merchants settled accounts, and the gold price had already surged out of the 50 taels mark, rising by more than 10 taels. Later, it slowed down slightly due to Yongheng, Wanxing, Shunli, and others eagerly buying, especially with the foreign exchange becoming more expensive. The recent English gold was only settled at 1 shilling 2 pence 4375. Banks had taken away 2 and a half pence, causing the market to be extremely sharp and soar to a new high of 767 taels. However, Fuchang and others took the opportunity to sell, and the exchange rate also turned peaceful, rushing downstream, falling by more than 10 taels. However, the waves roared, and the momentum was unstoppable. The market was closed on Wednesday, there was no foreign exchange market. However, the gold price seemed to have a reverse trend. It once broke into 50 taels, which was due to major firms selling. Later, it fluctuated constantly, with a callback of eight or nine taels. Finally, it was recorded at 52 taels. This morning, the big market is likely to fall again, but the gold market is feared to undergo drastic changes.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Rises by 10 Taels: From the early morning opening of the March market at 753 taels and 5 qian, it rose by 10 taels. The big market fell severely by 16/7, the forward contract was lower by 8/3. Especially because the selling wind in the United States did not stop, the initial market also fell by 1 point. However, buyers in the market were brave, and Fuchang and Yuancheng both bought in, so it continued to rise. From a high of 52 taels to 58 taels, there were only two or three taels of reversals in a quarter of an hour, and the foreign exchange was tight. Shanghai first offered March English gold at 128125, followed by Mitsui selling to Holland and Youli, etc. at 1275 in March and April. After 9:15, Yuanxing Yong, Taikang Run, and hedgers all sold, so it fell by more than 5 taels. When the shilling was announced, it was 52 and a half taels. However, since the listed price shrank by half a pence, it has already broken into 3 pence, only at 2 and a half pence. The US dollar shrank by 1 yuan, and the Japanese gold added 5.75 points, rising to 56.5 taels. After entering, Yuanheng and others sold, and the internal English gold was still settled at 1275, so it fell again to 51.89 taels.</p>
<p>New Peak of 67 Taels: After 10 o'clock, a peak suddenly appeared. Yongheng, Fuyu, Tong Dachang, Dalian Gang, etc. came in one after another. Because English gold was particularly strong, Mitsui offered 12625 for April. Until 10:30, HSBC and others took away 125 in March, and the market had a soaring momentum, with the rising wind unstoppable. The total surge was more than 15 taels, reaching 67 taels at 11 o'clock. After that, Wanxing, Shunli, Fuchang, etc. tended to sell, and immediately turned down. The sudden storm fell sharply by 12 taels, reaching 54.5 taels at 11:10. However, English gold in March and April must be sold at 12625, and the Japanese Commercial Bank bought in. In an instant, the HSBC listed price shrank again by 125, the US dollar by 25, and the Japanese gold added 1 and a half points, rising to 60 taels at 11:30. It was then sold by Yuan Maoyong and Wupin, etc., and another 4 taels were cut off. The market closed at 55 and a half taels at noon, and it was made again at 54 and a half to 56.7 taels. The listed price was changed to 811 taels and 8 qian, a difference of 59 taels to 60 taels, then 45 taels. At 11:30, because the listed price of Japanese gold added another 1.5 points, it was changed to 819 taels, a suppression of 62.3 taels.</p>
<p>The Aftermarket Presents a Wavering State: The aftermarket opened and fell to 53.5 taels, which was opened lower by Wupin. Then it added one tael. Because Changsheng Yong, Taikang Run, Yuanxing Yong, etc. sold, it fell by six or seven taels to 47.5 taels at 2:15, breaking into 50 taels. After that, there were two taels of ups and downs. However, Xinhang, Xieda, Yuhe, and various firms came in one after another, causing it to rise by 6 taels. After 2:45, it was recorded at 54 taels. Suddenly it fell to 50 taels. After 3 o'clock, it was heard that the Indian exchange reported a shrinkage of 4 annas. People's hearts were excited. Dalien Gang etc. started buying, so it tended to be high. It gradually rose by 6 taels, and between 3:50-4:00pm it reached 56 and half taels. At 4 o'clock, it suddenly saw another setback, with Wupin and Yuancheng selling, falling by 7 taels. At 4:15, it was only 49 and half taels. The market's wavering was unrestrained. After a short while, there were some buyers, and it had already been raised to 72 and a half taels. Approaching the closing, there was still one tael of twists and turns, recorded at 51 taels to 52 taels. The market closed at 4:30 at 51.8 qian, rising 8.3 qian from the previous day. Then it rose again to 4 and a half qian, retreating back to 52.3 taels, making people lose interest. The maximum daily price was 67 taels and the minimum price was 47.5 qian, a fluctuation of 19.5 qian. Wupin opened early at 53.5 qian, noon closed 54.5 afternoon 53.5 close 52. The listed price had a range of 65-72 taels and finished on 66-67 taels. The registered entries were 51 and 56 taels, top-ups for 51 and at 47 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Transactions Are Quite Confusing: Among fellow firms, Yuancheng and Fuchang entered and exited, Yongheng, Tong Taichang, Zhifeng Yong, Hengxing, and Xinhang all entered, and Shunli, Wanxing, and Bingxing all exited, with more entries than exits. Yuanxing Yong, Taikang Run, Hongxing Yong, Yuan Maoyong, and Yuantai, etc. all exited, and Wupin entered and exited from time to time. In the afternoon, Xinhang, Yuan Maoyong, Hengxing Yuan, and Yuantai all entered, and Wanxing, Shunli, and Changsheng Yong were inconsistent. Taikang Run, Yuancheng, and Yuanxing Yong all exited. Transactions in other firms were quite trivial. Dalian Gang entered a total of 27-2800 and exited 25-2600, with not much action from the Guang Gang and a small number bought in.</p>
<h3>Large Shrinkage in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>English Gold Shrunk 75 Points: 1 Shilling 2 Pence 375</p>
<p>US Dollar Reduced 1.25: 29.125 Yuan</p>
<p>Japanese Gold Added 7.25 Points: 1.7 Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, the English, American, Indian, and silver markets all fell miserably. The market was very soft, mainly due to the ongoing selling pressure in India and the United States. The exchange rates between England and America both rose. Markets in Penang, Bangkok, and Kobe were uneventful. HSBC foreign exchange shrank twice in succession, with the English exchange shrinking a total of 2.5 notches (625), the US dollar shrinking 1.25, and Japanese gold rising sharply by 7.25 points. The reason for the sharp drop was that the silver market continued to fall, coupled with the fact that import merchants were settling accounts excessively, causing the English gold to suddenly break into 3 pence. From the beginning of the morning, the English gold shrank by half a penny, listed at 1 shilling 2 pence and a half, and the US dollar at 1 yuan, calculated as 29.175 yuan. The Indian exchange shrank by 2.875 yuan, the franc by 26 yuan, the Japanese yuan by 2.5 yuan, the German exchange by 4.25 yuan, the Singapore exchange added 6 and a half taels, Hong Kong added 5 qian, and Japanese gold added 5.75 points, calculated as 1 liang 6 qian 8.5 fen. At 11:25, it suddenly changed again, shrinking by 125, the English gold is now 1 shilling 2 pence 375, the US dollar by 25, calculated as 29.125 yuan, the Indian exchange by 75, calculated as 80 rupees 625, the franc by 6 yuan, calculated as 742 yuan, the Japanese yuan by 625, calculated as 72 shield 375, the German exchange by 1.25 yuan, calculated as 122 marks 25, the Singapore exchange added 1.75 taels, calculated as 193 taels 25, Hong Kong is still calculated as 78 taels, and Japanese gold added another 1.5 points, reaching 1.7 qian, all of which set new records. As for the domestic market, it was also very tight, and the gold market once rushed past the 760 taels mark, breaking the previous record again. Chinese speculators and gold merchants were settling their positions, but HSBC and others absorbed it because they had to settle accounts. A total of 300,000 pounds of English gold was traded. The demand from Chinese merchants exceeded the supply. Banks such as Shanghai, Hefeng, Anda, Sumitomo, and Mitsui all sold, and Anda HSBC, Mitsui, Datong, Sumitomo, etc. all bought in. Various banks also did tens of thousands of pounds, but US dollars were rarely traded, and only a small number of Japanese gold was traded. The market atmosphere was extremely sharp. By the time the market closed at noon, the English gold had shrunk by 4375 compared to the previous day, the US dollar had shrunk by 875, and the Japanese gold had risen by 5.75. In the afternoon, it was closed on Wednesday as usual,</p>
<p>The Internal Market for English Exchange has a Fluctuation of 3125. The offering prices for February-April were 1 Shilling 2 Pence 75 in the morning.

Noon closing saw Feb offered at 1 liang 6 qian 7 fen 75 with bid at 6 fen 75. March offered at 1 liang 6 qian 7 fen 25 with a bid at 6 fen 25</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Prices Fall More Sharply</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegraph, the silver decline was stronger, and broke into the 13 pence level. There was slight Chinese selling, but there was a lack of buyers and the market was unstable. The market ended weak with the US market selling as the listed price was suppressed. India selling too was the cause for the days falling prices. The recent contract dropped sharply by 4375, to 12 Pence 8125, (combining into one shilling and three pence zero six two five), the far contract also shrunk by 375, calculating to 12 Pence 75. Another New York dispatch reported that the American silver price also fell sharply by a whole penny. The spot price was 27 and one-eighth cents, an increase of one-eighth and seven-eighths to the pound. Calculating to four dollars and eight and five-eighths. An extra five thirty-seconds were added to American compared to English and it came to four dollars and eight and five-eighths of a cent. Japs and Americans remains forty-nine dollars with all its decimals. The English figure remains at two shillings with all its decimals. The English figure dropped two five shillings to a shilling with its full decimals. Mumbai spot was seventeen less anna, calculated to thirty nine rupees and ten annas. Also reported at 10:30am Reuters and 9:50am that the Japanese News Agency had not reported any drops.</p>
<h3>Cessation of Sound and Silence in the Dismantling Market</h3>
<p>Prices are increasingly sluggish… Collection and settlement are still complicated</p>
<p>This time, due to the reform of national calendar relations and commercial habits, settlement still follows the old calendar. Therefore, the silver and money industry, which controls the financial hub, needless to say, has complex sorting procedures. Turning to the formerly prosperous money market, transactions are calm, and prices are low due to few competitors, resulting in a general decline. Silver funds are stagnant due to demand, and naturally, there is no silver dismantling to speak of due to abundant "overnight" funds. Furthermore, foreign silver dollars are also being returned from other ports, and the current base is particularly sufficient, it is said.</p>
<p>The dismantling price and transaction of "foreign silver dollars" in the early market were 7 qian 2 fen and a half li, and the afternoon market was 7 qian 2 fen and 7 hao and a half. Although the result was slightly better than the previous afternoon by 1 hao and 2 li and a half, the state of decline is indescribable. Generally, it still depends on the small denominations for opening remittance drafts. The early market was 1.135 million, the afternoon market was 800,000 with no odd amounts, banknotes in the early market were 75,000, the afternoon market was 50,000, off-exchange banknotes in the early market were 180,000, and the afternoon market was 110,000. Silver transactions in the early market were 800,000 in inter-market trading, and the afternoon market was 550,000. Transactions of small money shops were over 600,000. The "silver dismantling" in the morning and afternoon markets remained at 2 fen, the market atmosphere was as loose and abundant as ever, and drafts were still marked as white. Due to the scarcity of off-industry exchanges and weak demand, the current volume of dismantling draft transactions is only over 200,000.</p>
<p>Silver dollar collection, settlement, and sources: Yesterday, bank collection and settlement of other funds for "silver dismantling" remained moderately complex, and the settlement was not as prosperous as in the past. It is estimated that Chinese merchants collected and settled over 2.3 million in drafts, foreign merchants collected and settled over 2.67 million in drafts, settlement collection and settlement was 2.89 million, special funds were over 2 million, various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds collected and settled over 9 million, and new pledges and settlements amounted to approximately 2.2 million. 1.8 million was released from warehouses, Japanese banks collected and settled various funds for over 5.33 million, settled over 1 million, and released 500,000 from warehouses. Money shops and silver public offices collected and settled over 47.7 million in single transactions, draft funds collected and settled 6.5 million, various remittance funds were over 1.4 million, and cash collection was over 2 million. For "foreign funds," various banks had over 2.1 million in foreign exchange collections and settlements, banknotes collected and issued over 2.1 million, and customer sources included over 400,000 from the Yangtze River, over 300,000 from the interior, and over 900,000 gathered from the local streets. Money shops and foreign public offices collected and settled over 7.4 million in single transactions, foreign draft funds collected and settled 3.4 million, and foreign currency borrowing and lending was over 1.8 million.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on the Cause and Effect of the Rising Price of Broad Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>The Shanghai port is commercially prosperous, and the residents are particularly affluent. Therefore, the demand for daily necessities is also greater than in other metropolitan areas. This time, the unusual rise in the price of broad silver dollars due to a shortage of goods, and the great impact on the people's livelihood, is a logical and inevitable fact. Moreover, the exchange shops are forcibly suppressing prices, causing residents to suffer even more. Few outside the industry know the reasons for the price increase. Therefore, after detailed interviews by reporters, the following cause and effect were obtained. According to past experience, the Shanghai port has always suffered from a glut of broad silver dollars, with supply exceeding demand in the market. Furthermore, shipments from Shantou and Xiamen continue to arrive. Therefore, at the cheapest time, the price has been more than 12 jiao per silver dollar. Last summer, the Dalian gang saw the Shanghai port's exchange rate rising and purchased shipments for export, ranging from 200,000 to 300,000 jiao per batch. This lasted for half a year, and the Shanghai port's current base was almost eroded by more than half. Those in the industry knew that this continuous collection would eventually lead to panic one day, so those with power competed to purchase and hoard them. Afterwards, market prices gradually increased, and the hoarders then sold them at good prices to other gangs, leading to a shortage of cash that everyone needed, and the circulation became tight. After the small exchange shops competed to suppress prices, and the hoarding and trading houses added to the manipulation, it coincided with the end of the lunar year. In the prosperous era of previous years, there were already such strong suppression measures. How much more so in the current time of shortage? As a result, the prices continued to rise, forming the current phenomenon. It is rumored that there may be further contractions in the future, and it is not known whether the price will be one silver dollar for ten jiao. The early market yesterday was 6 qian 8 fen and a half li, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 8 fen and 2 li, an increase of 3 li compared to the previous day. Transactions amounted to 125,000 jiao in the early market and 120,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Jiangnan small foreign silver dollars in the early market were 6 qian 7 fen and 4 li, and in the afternoon market, they were 6 qian 7 fen and 5 li, also with a slight increase of 1 or 2 li. Transactions amounted to 6,000 jiao in the early market and 7,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Steel dollars were lengthened by 500 wen, amounting to 356,500,000 wen, with over 30,000 strings traded.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Weaken, Market Conditions Still Good</h3>
<p>Transaction volume of 8.3 million yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai securities market, spot market activity for various bonds was sporadic, while the futures market was slightly better, and the interest of buyers and sellers also increased. As for the trend of market prices for various public bonds, although market demand was not quiet, the selling party sold briskly. Therefore, when the market opened in the morning, the trend continued to weaken. Before and after the afternoon market, it was particularly low. It was not until the close that it began to rebound, and the result was similar to the opening in the early morning. Compared with the previous day, only the prices of the seven-year financial bond and the twenty-year cigarette bond were fixed. The cash price of the 1929 bond, excluding the current period's principal and interest, rose by two yuan and several jiao compared to the end of last month. All other bonds continued to fall by about three or four jiao. It is estimated that the total daily spot transactions amounted to 53,000 yuan, and the futures transactions amounted to 8,195,000 yuan in the morning and afternoon. Among them, the 1929 Customs, Disarmament, and 1929 Customs bonds were quite active. The Reorganization and Demobilization and twenty-year cigarette bonds were second, and the others were still relatively quiet.</p>

<h3>The Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Turns to a Lively Trend</h3>
<p>The yarn market is turning upward, and the trend is even more severe. In reality, the exchange rate is shrinking, gold prices are soaring, and raw cotton is rising. Therefore, sellers are relatively scarce, and the market situation is rapidly rising. Furthermore, a certain factory has a strong bullish sentiment and remains forceful, unwilling to relax. However, one manufacturer has gradually settled a significant portion of its bullish positions. Nevertheless, the majority of people believe that with the rise in the prices of all goods, the yarn market should take a step up. As a result, there are quite a few buyers, it is said.</p>
<p>The number of people bidding is extremely small. The market opened weak in the early market due to flat American cotton, but sellers were scarce in the market, and the market atmosphere was tight. All months rose by more than one or two yuan. The one-three market situation became increasingly firm, and as a result, each rose by one or two yuan, three, four, five, or six qian to two yuan. The market atmosphere remained firm in the afternoon, and the Xin Cheng Hao also purchased, with each month rising by two, three, five, six, or seven qian. The total daily turnover was 33,350 bales. It was found that Guangfeng sold 2,650 bales, Changfeng sold 2,250 bales, Yichang sold 1,500 bales, Shenchang sold 1,550 bales, and Rongxing sold 800 bales. Meiji bought 1,650 bales, Tianlong bought 1,900 bales, Xincheng bought 1,800 bales, and Shengtai bought 950 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Only 200 Bales The cash yarn business is quite quiet. It was found that the total daily purchases by various gangs were only 200 bales. Among the fellow traders, 250 bales were imported. Market conditions were flat. Among the customer gangs, 140 bales were imported from the mainland, 10 bales from the Ningbo gang, 20 bales from Jiangxi, 20 bales from Hong Kong, and 10 bales from Guangdong.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market's Rising Winds Are Remarkably Strong</h3>
<p>The rising winds in the cotton market are becoming increasingly sharp. However, the situation of foreign cotton is flat, but the exchange rate has shrunk unusually, making it even more difficult to import foreign cotton. Prices are becoming increasingly high, so the buyer's attitude is particularly strong. Scattered households are showing signs of panic, and the market situation is rapidly rising. However, the attitude of the Han gang remains calm, it is said.</p>
<p>Long-Term Han Biao Jumps Up by Eight Qian The Han Biao market opened weak in the early market. Due to the soaring gold prices, sellers were scarce, and each rose by four qian to seven and a half qian. When the market opened in the afternoon, the buying sentiment suddenly intensified due to the slight weakness in gold prices, and each rose again. As a result, each rose by five fen to two qian. The total daily turnover was 91,900 dan. It was found that Guangfeng sold 3,100 dan, Rongxing sold 5,700 dan, Shenxi sold 3,300 dan, and Changfeng sold 2,300 dan. Hengyi bought 6,200 dan, Jifeng bought 3,200 dan, Meiji bought 4,000 dan, and Xinheng bought 3,800 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>April 37.95, Up 7.0, 18,100</p>
<p>Cash Cotton Prices Are High, and Transactions Are Scarce and Quiet Although various factories have transactions for cash cotton transactions, it is difficult to accept due to the high prices. However, those who hold the goods are eager to hoard them. The source is estimated to be 310 bales of Yao cotton, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Turns Firm, Yarn Market Still Weak</h3>
<p>American cotton saw a slight rebound. Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but later became firm due to strong purchases by Wall Street and peers. It is estimated that futures rose by one to six pounds, and spot rose by five pounds. British cotton futures rose by one point, and spot fell by three points.

<h3>Grain, River, Lower Rice Market, South Tight, North Stable</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei Yesterday, more than 30 sources arrived from various gangs. Sales were slightly sluggish. The market for white japonica rice was stable. The high-quality market price was the same as the previous day. The top grade still opened at around 13.5 yuan. The sales market for thin rice was weak, but the source was scarce, and the trend was stable. There was very little high-quality Yangxian rice. The medium quality was not selling well, and prices barely maintained the original level. The supply of Dujian rice was stable. The buying sentiment for Shanghai tip rice was still active, without much change. The high opening was 11.5 yuan. The transformation of yuan coins was sluggish in both supply and sales, and the market turned mediocre. The overall market was quiet all day due to the rain.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai Yesterday, more than 20 sources arrived from the river. Sales on the local streets were still good. The Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongzhou gangs' machine-milled japonica rice was mainly selling high-quality rice, and ordinary rice was also acceptable, but the lower grades were flat. The overall market was moving up by a jiao. The various thin early rice varieties from the southern route were also continuously firm. According to production, the Shanghai market is no longer cost-effective, and future sources may be reduced, with prices rising by one or two jiao. The situation for Yangdu Xian rice was firm and stable, with few transactions, and prices were high, close to a jiao. Both the changing yuan and hanging rice shops made slight progress, and the incoming goods were connected, so the overall market was slightly better.</p>
<h3>Futures Beans and Bean Cake Tend to Turn Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures bean market turned better. According to reports from Dalian, the production was good, and the standard gold price was rising. After the market opened in the morning, the buying sentiment was quite strong. Various parties had a strong appetite, and both near and far terms tended to be tight. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold market was downstream, and the customer gangs slightly sold, so the market was mediocre. As a result, February and May both rose by three fen, March rose by four fen, and April rose by one fen. The futures bean cake market opened firm in the morning. Later, due to the upward trend of the bean market, people's hearts were optimistic. In the afternoon, the customer gangs again inquired, and the situation became active. At the close, March rose by one fen, April and May rose by one fen and seven li and a half, June rose by seven and a half li, and July opened at one liang and six qian and twenty-five.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Shows Lively Signs Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a firm and lively appearance again. The price of foreign wheat rebounded by four, five, six, or seven jiao. Furthermore, due to the soaring gold market and the daily short exchange rate, it is inevitable that it will affect future orders. Therefore, the inland gangs and the local absorption households tried their best to collect. Although the sellers were still continuing to sell, the environment turned better and could not resist the competition from buyers, so the prices of each month rose step by step, especially the long-term ones. Observing the later steps, or fearing the habitual constraints, the market conditions should not fall too far. As a result, this month was better by two and a half li compared to the previous day, March was better by one and a half fen, April was better by one fen and two and a half li, May was better by two fen, June was better by one fen and two and a half li, and July was better by one and a half fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat All See Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month saw a rebound. The price of foreign wheat rebounded quite quickly. Furthermore, due to the earthquake in Australia, it is feared that the supply of foreign wheat from this route will be interrupted in the later steps, so people's hearts suddenly vibrated. As for the short positions, due to the improved environment, most of them wanted to sell, unwilling to release, so the asking prices for each month were invisibly tight. However, the chips in the market are all foreign wheat cover codes. In the future, unless the actual sales are prosperous, the two sides can be evenly matched. Otherwise, there will eventually be a time when the accumulated burden is difficult to reverse. As a result, this month rose by three fen compared to the previous day, March rose by four fen, April and May rose by three fen, June had no comparison, and July was better by five fen, it is said.</p>

<h3>Important Talk by Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>▲Day and Night Bank Liquidation Incident</p>
<p>▲Municipal Government Decides to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>▲Each Factory First Sends Personnel for Inspection</p>
<p>▲Complete Inaccuracy of Being Sent to Sichuan</p>
<p>Our reporter interviewed Mayor Zhang Qun at the Municipal Government yesterday to inquire about the aftermath of the Day and Night Bank liquidation case and various issues such as business tax. The following is a summary of his remarks.</p>
<p>▲Day and Night Bank Regarding the liquidation of the Day and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department, Zhang said that most of the depositors are laborers and women, which has a huge impact on the livelihood of the common people. The Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government have repeatedly received appeals from creditors, requesting maintenance and handling. Recently, it has been heard that three or five depositors have committed suicide as a result, which is very pitiful. The Municipal Government cannot stand idly by. It has now decided to take responsibility for the handling and seek more benefits for the creditors. It is currently exchanging opinions with all parties and carefully discussing everything. It is expected that a direction can be determined in two or three days. The main points of the method are to gather all relevant parties for open consultations and stipulate methods for repaying debtors. Currently, the most difficult issue is the Gongfa Company and Huang Chujiu's private property, which are scattered in the Public Concession and the French Concession. If the French Concession handles it, its power only extends to the Great World and the Day and Night Bank headquarters. Moreover, once the stores are closed, the losses will be even greater, and the creditors will suffer even greater losses. In short, this move by the Municipal Government is entirely to seek benefits for the creditors, and I will do my best to ensure a perfect outcome.</p>
<p>▲Business Tax Rate Regarding the issue of business tax rates, Zhang said that the Municipal Finance Committee is currently conducting detailed research. After the decision is made, the Municipal Government will submit it to the Central Government for approval, hoping to obtain a fair disposition. As for the merchants in the concessions, they are also Chinese nationals and should have the obligation to pay taxes. The difficulty is that the concessions have already levied a license tax similar to business tax. This is currently being considered, and the merchants will not be subject to double taxation.</p>
<p>▲Inspection of Factories The Factory Law and the Implementing Regulations of the Factory Law have been resolved by the National Government meeting to be postponed until August 1. Mayor Zhang said yesterday that there are about one thousand several hundred factories in Shanghai, and several hundred of them do not comply with the Factory Law. The first step is to send personnel to investigate and inspect them one by one. Those who do not comply will find ways to reform and make full preparations in advance, so that there will be no more difficulties in the short term.</p>
<p>▲Yuan Liang's Resignation Public Security Bureau Chief Yuan Liang has submitted his resignation, and I have forwarded his resignation to the Central Government. The successor has been internally determined to be Mr. Chen Xizeng. I met with him yesterday, and he will officially take over after the Central Government issues an order.</p>
<p>▲Rumors of Going to Sichuan When the reporter asked whether the rumors that the Central Government intends to send the mayor to Sichuan to preside over Sichuan affairs were true, Zhang replied that there was no such thing. Although Sichuan is my hometown, I have been away from Sichuan for a long time and have many barriers. I am willing to offer opinions on Sichuan affairs but do not want to join the vortex. There are rumors that President Dai Jitao will go, but the Central Government has no such intention either. I have recently been working hard on the construction of the central area of the city, which will begin in May and be able to lay the foundation in July. I firmly believe that one person should focus on one thing to achieve some success. Even if the Central Government issues an order for promotion, I know that my talent and strength are insufficient and I will not dare to accept it.</p>
<h3>Study Group on Various Industry Tax Regulations Holds Second Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Tax Regulation Study Committee of various industry guilds in this city held its second committee meeting yesterday. The committee members present were Ye Chunqiao, Xie Zhongle, Ge Yuanqing (represented by Ma Jiliang), Luo Qinghua, Shen Weiting, Cheng Youfu, Lin Zhangrong, Shao Baoxing, Wang Lianfang, Hu Juewen, Zhao Xiaolin, and more than ten others. Luo Qinghua served as chairman, and Sun Mingqi was the recorder. The meeting began with the usual formalities. First, the chairman gave a report, and then discussions began. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) Regarding the motion submitted by He Yinsheng, a representative of the candle industry, at the second general meeting of various industries, requesting that the competent authorities handle business tax matters with simplicity and efficiency when implementing them, it was resolved to present the matter to the provincial finance departments for their attention. (2) Regarding the letters from the Western clothing industry, embroidery industry, foil industry, ginseng and bird's nest industry, paint industry, cosmetics industry, ham industry, candle industry, silk and satin industry, and copper and tin industry, requesting to reduce business tax rates, it was resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government based on the opinions of various industries. It was requested that the business tax rates in various provinces and cities not exceed two per thousand, except where the government has other regulations below two per thousand. The wholesale part should still be taxed at one-quarter. The collection method should follow the plan proposed by Anhui Province and be based on the proportion of business volume. (3) Regarding how to stipulate the regular meeting date of this committee, it was resolved to hold a meeting every Wednesday at 2:00 PM. If necessary, temporary meetings will be convened. The remaining matters were brief. Also, the committee sent a document to the Municipal Executive Committee and letters to various members of the Municipal Finance Discussion Committee who are related to the business community. The original texts are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Document Presented to the Municipal Executive Committee: Presenting the matter of implementing business tax in this city, which is related to increasing the burden on citizens, requesting special attention and hoping for verification to benefit people's livelihood. It is noted that after the abolition of likin, using consolidated tax and special tax to compensate for central government losses, and using business tax to compensate for local government losses, was the fundamental plan decided by the likin abolition conference. The level of business tax rates in various provinces and cities should comply with the guidelines promulgated by the Executive Yuan, taking into account the actual losses suffered by the province or city due to the abolition of likin to determine the tax rate, which is not an easy conclusion. However, this city has never had likin revenue. This time, the explicit abolition of likin has not resulted in any losses. It should not follow the example of other provinces and implement business tax. If, as reported in the newspapers in recent days, the business tax planned by the Finance Bureau is purely an unexpected income, then the hope of merchants and people for the abolition of likin to reduce the burden, and the local government's increase in income due to the abolition of likin, would not be the central government's intention to benefit merchants and people, nor would it be consistent with the original intention of the likin abolition policy. Moreover, the situation in this city is special, with the separation of concessions and the presence of foreign capital, which has not yet achieved the goal of universality and equality. The harm caused will be ten times greater than the abuses of likin. This association is an organization composed of more than one hundred industry guilds, and this matter concerns their vital interests. They dare to present this appeal, hoping that your committee will pay special attention to eliminate business difficulties and benefit people's livelihood, which would be a great virtue. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>▲Letter to Discussion Committee Members: To gentlemen Qia Qing, Ji, Yan Song, Hui Jun, and Run Qing, it has often been heard that there is no taxation without representation. This is the golden rule of democratic countries and the initial foundation for the establishment of civil rights. After the National Government was established, it governed the country with the Three Principles of the People. All systems, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, cannot be cited, so that the fundamental law has not yet been promulgated. Taking the city as an example, although the municipal system has been explicitly promulgated, the Municipal Council, which represents the citizens, has not yet been organized according to law. Therefore, there is no formal review and approval body for the municipal tax system, budget, and final accounts, which increase the burden on the people. For the sake of collecting opinions and benefiting widely, the municipal finance authorities have organized a Finance Discussion Committee. Those who are extended invitations are either financial experts or business leaders, and their positions are voluntary. They are not like the members of the Construction Discussion Committee, who can receive a monthly allowance of one hundred yuan. Since the establishment of the Municipal Finance Discussion Committee, the most well-known achievements to the citizens are the borrowing of rental fees and the raising of municipal public bonds, all for the purpose of supporting the progress of municipal construction. Their enthusiasm is admirable. Compared with the former Shanghai Special Municipal Council's discussion of increasing rental donations and deciding to reduce the discount, and the discussion of issuing municipal bonds and deciding to postpone the handling, one is passive and the other is active, which are truly incomparable. Recently, this city plans to implement business tax, and your committee has conducted two discussions, and the collection regulations and implementation rules have been initially passed. As for the tax rate issue, according to the newspaper report on the 2nd of this month, Chairman Wang Xiaolai stated that he will ask various industries to submit their opinions on the tax rate, and the committee will discuss them based on the submissions from various industries, form a draft, and then submit it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene a general meeting of representatives from various industries, which will then be reported to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. This shows that you are concerned about the pain of various industries and the hardships of business. (1) Compared with the financial authorities of Jiangsu Province, who independently formulate without soliciting opinions from merchants and people, it is a hundred times better. Compared with the financial authorities of Zhejiang Province, who only invited a few representatives to pass important cases concerning the burden on the people, and failed to distinguish between luxury and non-luxury goods in detail, they must heavily tax all major products to increase revenue, regardless of whether they should be maintained and how their current situation is declining. As a result, the draft was passed first, and the merchants and people cried out later, accusing and blaming each other on the road. You must have seen the details in the newspapers. I hope that you will learn from the past and avoid repeating the same mistakes, understand the wishes of merchants and people, and only follow the regulations of the central government to use special tax and consolidated tax to compensate for the central government's losses due to the abolition of likin, and use business tax to compensate for the local government's losses due to the abolition of likin. The first step is to ask the municipal finance authorities to publicly announce the amount of losses suffered by this city due to the abolition of likin as the sole criterion for discussing the tax rate. The second step is if the municipal finance authorities believe that construction requires funding, and business tax has already been implemented in various provinces, it would not be cruel to take it in this city. Then, when issuing municipal public bonds in the past, it was also designated for municipal construction. Now that the public bonds have been raised in full, and the construction achievements may be considerable, it is also requested to report to the municipal government to announce the construction projects undertaken by using public bonds to the citizens, so that the citizens can also be happy to support the promotion of new taxes, which will be easily effective. The third step is that the Chinese and concession boundaries must be uniformly implemented, and Chinese and foreign shops should be treated equally. Since the mayor has already said it, you should have a good understanding of it and promote its realization. Furthermore, the citizen representative agency has a fixed organization according to law. Then, you are acting as financial discussion committee members in your current capacity as natural persons. Even if you can speak for merchants and people and think for citizens, your words will not be legitimate if your name is not correct. It is not easy to be understood by citizens. Moreover, there are administrative authorities in the committee, and it is difficult to find people who do not violate their conscience and speak frankly, as Ji An advocated. The intention of this association is to ask you to report to the municipal government authorities to quickly organize the municipal council according to law. If direct elections by citizens are still difficult, then follow the National Assembly election law and have various legal groups elect them separately. If the official representative agency of citizens is established as soon as possible, it will be able to exercise its legally assigned powers in the council, and you can also avoid the blame for perfection. This is a win-win situation. I respectfully present my sincerity, hoping that you will take it into consideration and wish you all the best.</p>
<h3>Xu Yongzuo Discusses Business Tax Issues</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Finance Bureau has repeatedly convened the Finance Discussion Committee to discuss the method of handling business tax in this city. The Tax Regulation Research Association of various industries in this city has sent letters to Finance Minister Song and Finance Discussion Committee members Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo to express their opinions. Yesterday, reporters from various newspapers specially visited accountant Xu to inquire about the details. He provided the following answers: (Question) It was reported in the newspapers a few days ago that the Finance Discussion Committee had passed the draft of the business tax collection regulations and implementation rules. Is this true? (Answer) The committee is an advisory body to the Finance Bureau. Although it has revised and passed the draft regulations, whether they will be implemented according to these regulations still depends on the Finance Bureau, the Municipal Government, and the Central Government for approval. (Question) The business tax rates in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are considered too high by all industries. How is the tax rate in this city compared to Jiangsu and Zhejiang? (Answer) The committee is currently only discussing the articles of the business tax regulations and has not yet talked about the numbers of the tax rate. In the future, it will be based on the Ministry's Business Tax Outline and Supplementary Measures, and there is no need to follow the tax rates set by Jiangsu and Zhejiang. (Question) When discussing the business tax issue in Zhejiang Province, experts were invited to participate. Did you attend at that time? (Answer) I am in Shanghai and have many affairs. I have never been invited to participate in Zhejiang Province, so I have not heard about the discussion. (Question) You must have a good understanding of the business tax issue. What are your opinions on the business tax method in this city? (Answer) I have been invited by various ministries and departments to discuss industrial and commercial tax systems and other laws and regulations, and I have always focused on being suitable for the national conditions and do not want to make unrealistic talk. I am ashamed that I have not deeply studied the various theories and examples of business tax in various countries, so when discussing the business tax method in this city, I should especially take into account the domestic environment as a prerequisite. The industry and commerce in our country are not yet developed, and the tax rate burden should be reduced. (Question) What is your opinion on the letter sent to you by the Tax Regulation Research Association of various industries? (Answer) The statements in the letter from the association that were published in the newspapers are actually due to misunderstandings, but I have not yet received the letter. I have already sent a letter to clarify, "Respected Sirs, I recently read in the newspaper that your association sent a letter to Mr. Pan Xulun and me, stating that when Zhejiang Province discussed the business tax rate, a certain expert attended the meeting and often compared it with the business tax rate in foreign countries. The business tax rate in Jiangsu is based on Zhejiang. The efforts of the chambers of commerce in the sixty counties of Jiangsu are indirectly due to the expert. The Shanghai business tax case is in preparation, and you are all members of the Municipal Finance Bureau Finance Discussion Committee. Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang have made mistakes in the past, this city should prevent repeating the same mistakes and offer good advice as a good medicine. I have not yet received this letter, but it has already been disclosed in the newspaper, which is very suspicious. I have many affairs in Shanghai and have never been invited by Zhejiang Province to go to Hangzhou to discuss the business tax case, so I have not heard about the discussion of the tax rate. Moreover, I have been invited by various ministries and departments in the past to discuss industrial and commercial tax systems and other laws and regulations, all based on the principle of being suitable for the national conditions and not making unrealistic talk. This time, when discussing the business tax issue in this city, I believe that I have not studied the theories and examples of business tax in various countries, and considering that the industry and commerce in our country are not yet developed, I should especially take into account the domestic environment and reduce the burden on various industries. The letter published in the newspaper is obviously due to misunderstandings. I am afraid that it will confuse the hearing, so I specially send this letter to you for your review to eliminate misunderstandings. Sincerely, to the Tax Regulation Research Association of various industry guilds in Shanghai, February 5, 20th year."</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Passes Through Shanghai and Goes to Beijing</h3>
<p>▲Arrived in Port Yesterday Morning by Boat from Ningbo</p>
<p>▲Went to Beijing at Noon to Meet Mo Dehui</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, previously went to Fenghua, his hometown, with his family to celebrate his father-in-law's birthday. Yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, Mr. Wang and his wife and children returned to Shanghai on the Xin Ning Shao vessel. Since Mo Dehui, the supervisor of the China Eastern Railway, had arrived in Beijing and was urgently awaiting a meeting to discuss the Sino-Russian negotiations, Mr. Wang hurriedly took the express train to Beijing at 12:30 PM yesterday noon. His family stayed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲Discussed the Recent Situation of the Navy</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Chen Shaokuan, the Vice Minister of the Navy and Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. The reporter visited him at the shipyard in the afternoon and asked about the recent situation of the navy. He talked about the following:</p>
<p>▲Planning Maritime Rights: Mr. Chen said that foreign fishing boats have repeatedly invaded our country's coastal areas to fish, so determining territorial sea rights is an urgent matter. The day before yesterday, the government ordered the Ministry of Navy to work with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Interior to plan the scope of the territorial sea. It has been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The order has not yet been received today. The regulations are roughly the same as those of other countries. The area within three miles of the coast (excluding beaches and sand beaches where water does not reach) is the territorial sea. Unless it is a port of entry, foreign ships are not allowed to invade. Then, send ships to patrol. Not only will sovereignty not be spilled out, but the fishing industry will also be revitalized. The plan is awaiting the approval of the Yuan order before it can be implemented, so this matter is in progress and cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>▲Yangtze River Defense: The Yangtze River defense is very solid. There are almost no bandits along the riverbanks. Even if there are small groups of bandits, they are all in the inland areas along the river. Although bandits were found in Chenglingji the day before yesterday, they were dispersed by Ren Sheng's suppression. At present, major ports along the river, from Yichang to the capital, have warships stationed. Jiang Zhen ship is stationed in Hankou, Jiang Kun ship in Jianli, Gong Sheng ship in Yuezhou, Jiang Xi ship in Xindi, Chu Qian and Yong Sui ships in Jiujiang, Jiang Yuan ship in Wuxue, Xian Ning ship in Hukou, Wei Sheng ship in Anqing, Chu You ship in Nanjing, and eight torpedo ships, such as Hu Peng, Hu Ying, and Hu Ji, which are exercising in Baguazhou.</p>
<p>▲Establishing a School in Xiangshan: Xiangshan is indeed a natural harbor. The Ministry of Navy has decided to set up a naval school there first. The estimated cost is 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. As soon as the construction plan is drafted, it will begin. The Ministry of Navy has sent the Tong Ji training ship there to plan. In the future, students will be admitted through examinations, not by sending them from various ships. The number of students will probably be 300. As for the port construction, this matter is significant, and the cost is not 100,000 or 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the saying that Xiangshan is actively building the port is not yet the time, let alone when there are no plans or funds.</p>
<p>▲Renovating Warships: The renovation of the abandoned Da An warship has been completed, and it has been renamed Da Tong. Following the renovation of this ship, there is still Jian Wei. It is said that the Jian Wei project is expected to be completed in three months, and it can be completed together with the new Yi Xian ship. The old name of Jian Wei has been decided not to be used, and the new name has been set as Zi Qiang. As for the Min Sheng warship, which is currently under construction, half of the project has been built and will be launched at the end of March or the beginning of April this year. The rumor that the Navy is purchasing new ships from abroad is false because there is no such thing in the Ministry of Navy.</p>
<h3>Yang Xiaotang Asks for Leave to Return Home</h3>
<p>Yang Xiaotang, the Consul General in Penang, has been in office for nearly a year. Recently, he asked for leave to return to China due to personal matters. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and will return to his post after a few weeks.</p>
<h3>Record of People's Movements</h3>
<p>▲Japanese Ambassador Shigemi Mamoru took the night train to Beijing at 11:00 PM last night. ▲Vice Minister of Transportation Wei Yifu took the train out of Beijing last night and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Chinese Shipping Industry Opposes Sino-American Joint Shipping</h3>
<p>▲Serious Expression Will Be Made Within Days</p>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to jointly run Sino-American shipping with the American Dollar Steamship Company, providing a large number of ships for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to use and registering with the Chinese government. Everything is generally controlled by the Chinese. All matters are being actively carried out in recent days. The shipping industry in this port is very shocked upon hearing the news. The initial rhetoric is very pleasant to the ear. For example, Sino-American joint shipping can recover shipping rights and various slogans, but it will ultimately lead to the bankruptcy of the Chinese shipping industry. Once implemented, it will be like letting wolves into the house. It is said that a serious expression will be made within days.</p>
<h3>Important Shipping News</h3>
<p>▲Fog Blocks Various Ships from Entering the Port: Up to forty ships were blocked by the heavy fog outside Wusong this time. The fog dispersed by noon yesterday, and the blocked merchant ships began to arrive in Shanghai one after another. The Tai Gu Ning Shao's Shanghai-Ningbo ship was delayed until 3:00 PM. The remaining Yangtze River and coastal ships arrived in Shanghai within three, four, or five hours, reaching twenty-eight ships. Some ships that were unable to arrive in Shanghai will arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>▲Gong He Ship Runs Aground: The Jardine Matheson Yangtze River ship Gong He ran aground near Datong this time when sailing downstream from Hankou due to the receding river water and fog. Yesterday, the company received a wireless from Gong He saying that after Gong He ran aground, it had reversed out of the shoal during high tide. It had passed Wuhu at 1:00 PM and could reach Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ship Occupies Zhenjiang Water Surface Rights</h3>
<p>▲China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Negotiates with Jardine Matheson</p>
<p>Guo Yanmo, the director of the Zhenjiang branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, presented to General Manager Li Zhonggong yesterday, stating that the Zhenjiang branch's lotus pond wharf ship surface property, which is owned by the bureau, is occupied by a British ship. Negotiations have been requested repeatedly, but the wharf ship is still docked as usual, which has a great impact on the bureau's business economy. It is not just the encroachment of the bureau's property. The export cargo loading in Zhenjiang Port is already light. If the ships can dock at the wharf all year round, it may be possible to compete slightly. Moreover, the sand beaches along the river are unpredictable with the rising and falling tides. Except for the location of the Nisshin wharf ship, the water depth of the lotus pond bureau property is the deepest. If the bureau's wharf ship is moved, it will not be able to dock for almost half of the year. When the water is shallow in winter, small ships are rented to tow iron barges to load and unload passengers and goods, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. When there is a lot of cargo, wooden barges must be hired, which is a loss for the bureau and inconvenient for the passengers. Considering the situation, the relocation of the wharf cannot be delayed. The lotus pond river surface has been occupied by the Jardine Matheson wharf ship. Unless it is negotiated to move back quickly, the bureau's wharf ship cannot be moved. It is reasonable to submit this to your seat and urgently negotiate. General Manager Li believes that the river surface property should not be occupied by foreign ships. Yesterday, he sent a letter to Jardine Matheson, ordering them to return it soon. Otherwise, he will submit it to the central government for negotiation and order them to withdraw the wharf ship as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Ship Escort Team Established Early</h3>
<p>▲Board the Ship on the 20th of This Month</p>
<p>▲Determine the Number of Team Members</p>
<p>▲Recruitment of Escort Team: The addition of escort teams to the Shanghai-Ningbo ships has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the three companies continued to meet and have agreed on the team members to be placed on each ship. They have been reduced again to eleven soldiers and one squad leader per ship. The military police will not be used. Instead, the three companies will recruit them. Thirty-six people will be recruited first. Yu Qiaqing and others have recruited them. After the uniforms are specified and the military equipment is requested, they will be sent to each ship to serve.</p>
<p>▲Request for Military Equipment: Yesterday, the three companies sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting military equipment, stating that cases of pirates looting ships have been frequently seen recently. If precautions are not taken in advance, it is not enough to secure the safety of travelers. The method of pirates attempting to loot ships is generally to dress up as passengers and mix into each cabin. When the ship is in the middle of the journey, they hold firearms and gather together to monitor the crew and kidnap the passengers. They do whatever they want and loot as much as they want. After looting, they either force the crew to drive to the pirate den or the nearby coast, or the pirates drive away themselves. The crew is helpless, and the passengers are stunned. The prevention strategy is to have armed soldiers protect the ship to secure the safety of travelers and maintain the shipping industry. Our company has decided to form an escort team on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, with one captain and one vice-captain to supervise. Each ship will have one squad leader and eleven soldiers stationed on the ship. If any passengers are suspicious or if any firearms are found, they will be immediately sent to your bureau for punishment. If they are discovered midway, they will have the ability to resist. The bandits will not dare to try to board knowing that there is an armed escort team on the ship. At ordinary times, they will protect the passengers, and in case of an emergency, they will be prepared. The roster of soldiers will be reported separately for record. The firearms for the escort team added to our company's ships should be requested to be issued and collected by your bureau (omitted below).</p>
<p>▲Board the Ship Early: Yesterday, the three companies decided to send them to each ship to escort as soon as the firearms are collected. Since the passenger fare for Shanghai-Ningbo will be increased on the 18th, the escort soldiers will also be sent on the first ship in the lunar month of February. It is estimated that it will be implemented on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>▲Reply to Various Tea Rooms: The tea room guilds of various ships expressed opposition to this case and requested to stop increasing the export cargo fare and passenger tickets. Yesterday, the three companies replied to the tea room guilds, stating that adding an escort team and adding passenger fares are the facilities that the business department should have, and it has been decided to implement them. The request to stop adding fares and for the crew to serve as team members cannot be approved.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Organs' Third-Day Report on the Significance of Union Consolidation</h3>

<p>▲ Willing to Accept Consolidation</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 4th), the Popular Training Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, in conjunction with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, convened representatives of various established unions throughout the city at the Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs to hold talks on the issue of union consolidation. This was the third day, following two consecutive days of meetings starting on the 2nd. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Talks at the Municipal Popular Training Committee: Yesterday, the following unions were summoned and attended the meeting at the Party Headquarters on time: Mosi Lithographic Printing Union - Chen Wenxing, Shi Jiulun, Lu Xuefu; Yuanli Printing Union - Fu Kang, Lou Yongfu, Cai Afeng; Lithographic Adhesive Paper Union - Xu Tonghe, Zhang Zihua; Mosi Lithographic Machinery Union - Zhou Yongfa, Zhao Xiangxiao, Zhang Afu; Fubu Dyeing Industry Union - Jin Yixian; Silk Fabric Dyeing Workers Union - Li Shuzhang, Hu Xiongqing; Printed Fabric Dyeing Union - Li Yimei; Qinglan Dyeing Industry Union - Dong Zipeng; Yangse Dyeing Industry Union - Chen Amao; Silk Satin Dyeing Industry Union - Shen Guifu, Jin Neishi; Guangdong Preserved Meat Industry Union - Li Wenlong, Wu Hui; Zhe Ning Slaughtered Duck Industry Union - Huang Boying. After the representatives registered, they held separate talks with staff members Huang Zao Xiong, Lin Meiyan, Zhu Ya Kui, Huang E, Diao Qing En, Zhang Sheng, and others assigned by the Municipal Popular Training Committee. The speakers from the Municipal Popular Training Committee reported on the significance of union consolidation and inquired about the current status of each union. Representatives of each union successively expressed their opinions, indicating acceptance of the issues of reorganization and merger.</p>
<p>▲ Unions to be Summoned Today: The unions to be summoned for talks today (the 5th) are as follows: Those who must go to the Party Headquarters for talks at 10:00 AM are: Zhatie Cement Engineering Industry Union, Repair and Manufacture of Civilian Ships Industry Union, Steamboat Wood Industry Union, North Wharf Railway Loading and Unloading Union, Taikoo Sanbei Steamboat Loading and Unloading Union, Luodian Pudong District Union. Those who must go to the Party Headquarters for talks at 1:00 PM are: Fresh Pig Wharf Ship Union, Lumber Transport Union, Sand and Gravel Sailing Ship Transportation Union, Coal Boat Barge Transport Union, Sand and Gravel Barge Transport Union, Tong Chong Haiyun Barge Union, Customs Broker Union.</p>
<p>▲ Talks at the Bureau of Social Affairs: In the morning, (letterpress printing industry) Yin Wenbai and He Yuren from the Huayang Printing Union attended the talks, represented by Gu Bingyuan and Wang Youmei. From the newspaper industry, Tang Haiquan, Dai Xengeng, and Chen Qingrong from the Newspaper Industry Union attended. From the publishing industry, Yang Youren, Wang Wenhua, and Ni Xiaoxian from the Commercial Press attended; Chen Longzhang, Zhang Ruyu, and Wan Pusheng from the Commercial General Affairs Office Workers Union; Wang Yongliang, Shen Shangfang, and Ma Wei from the Commercial Distribution Office Workers Union; Chen Yuesheng, Zhu Gongchui, and Chen Bowen from the Commercial Translation Office Workers Union, represented by Guo Yongxi and Zhang Shuye, attended the talks. In the afternoon, from the straw hat industry, Wang Yuxiang, Zhou Zhiqing, and Song Wenbiao from the Straw and Felt Hat Industry Union, represented by Gu Bingyuan and Wang Youmei, attended the talks. From the garment industry, Zhou Shangen from the Western Clothing Union and Cai Ziwen from the Garment Union, represented by Guo Yongxi and Zhang Shuye, attended the talks. After the chairman's report, representatives from each union expressed their opinions. They considered there to be no problem with merging into a district union. However, four difficulties were discovered during the talks: (1) Representatives from the Western Clothing and Garment Unions believed it was difficult to merge because their work skills are different. (2) The straw hat industry can only establish a Hunan District Union with only 150 members, and the collected membership fees cannot be maintained. (3) Special areas in the straw hat industry, and others, cannot organize district unions due to insufficient statutory numbers. If the capitalists in that area abuse the recruitment of apprentices, the Hunan District cannot restrict it. (4) Because the Lunar New Year is approaching for the straw hat industry, workers are returning to their hometowns, and it is impossible to convene a reorganization in the shortest possible time. The chairman personally instructed that the party and government organs should carefully review and handle the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Unions to be Summoned Today: Tea and food industry, Chinese and Western pastry industry unions, Zhe Ning tea and food union, Su Ning tea and food industry workers union. Woodworking industry: Red and white wood industry union, red and white woodworking industry union, Western-style woodworking industry union, carved panel chair industry union, mirror wood union, tea box union. Painting industry: Rust removal and painting union. Water and wood industry, construction industry: Hunan District Construction Union, Zhabei District Construction Union, Huxi District Construction Union, Jiangwan District Construction Union, Pudong Construction Union. The above will be discussed at the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<h3>The Newspaper Industry Union and the Four Unions of the Commercial Press Hold Talks with the Bureau of Social Affairs</h3>
<p>▲ Requesting Guarantee of Original Labor-Capital Contracts</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Newspaper Industry Union and the four unions of the Commercial Press were summoned by the Bureau of Social Affairs for talks. Chairman Guo Yongxi reported on the significance of reorganizing the union. Representatives of the Newspaper Industry Union stood up and (asked): After the union is reorganized, will the originally established labor-capital contract still be valid? (Answer): There is no problem with this point, because reorganization and contract are two different issues. (Question): This reorganization is based on the Union Law, and subsequent arbitrations will naturally be based on the Union Law. In that case, the entire labor-capital contract will be shaken. Taking the first article of the contract as an example, if the union has the right to represent all "workers," and the Union Law stipulates that "union members may withdraw from the union at any time, and the standards for handling labor disputes state that 'it is not allowed to stipulate that workers expelled from union membership must also be terminated from their jobs by the capitalists," then members may collude with the capitalists, or the capitalists may buy off members to undermine the organization. The union is bound by the law and cannot prevent it. Such a reorganization is equivalent to dissolution. (Answer): There is no need to worry about this. The Union Law has been implemented for a long time, and no such incidents have occurred. Reorganization may provide protection. (Question): Can you be responsible? (Answer): The scope of today's talks is limited to reorganization. The contract is another issue and is not convenient to answer. (Question): The original contract, agreed upon by both labor and capital, has been in effect for nearly four years. If it loses its protection after reorganization, our association will not dare to reorganize. (Answer): Representatives, do not use contract protection as an exchange condition for reorganization, nor think that a contractual relationship will arise after reorganization. If you do not reorganize, you are an illegal organization, and the contract has even less protection. It is better to reorganize and then submit a request for protection. (Question): Reorganization is not a problem in itself, as long as the contract is protected, it can be reorganized at any time. We hope that the Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs will clearly stipulate this. Chairman Guo (asked): The Union Law has been implemented for a long time. Why has it not been submitted for amendment? (Answer): All the unions in Shanghai have submitted documents four or five times and petitioned in Beijing two or three times, but to no avail. Representatives from the commercial and industrial sectors stood up successively to ask further questions: (1) The rights that our association has fought for four or five years will be lost once due to reorganization. Who wouldn't be heartbroken? (2) Comrade Wu Kaixian said when talking with our association that the labor-capital contract is not a problem. (3) It is necessary to ask the Party and government organs to clearly stipulate that "the labor-capital contract will never be changed due to reorganization," etc. The chairman accepted the opinions and forwarded them to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs, and announced them in the newspapers on the same day.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Trade Association Holds General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Several Important Cases Resolved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association held a general meeting of all members at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 people attended, including Huang Jin Chen, Wang Xiaolai, Chu Huiseng, Zhu Jing'an, and Zhang Peishen. Shen Huachen presided over the meeting, and the formalities were observed. First, the silk factory public debt case was discussed. The chairman reported on the circumstances of the case, stating that the public debt case had been approved by the Administrative Council but had not yet been announced and implemented. At a time when the business community is closing accounts, money is extremely tight, and factories urgently need funds to turn around. Vice Minister Zhang of Finance is currently in Shanghai, and representatives should be elected immediately to urge him in person. In addition to electing Wang Xiaolai, Shen Huachen, Huang Jinchen, Zhu Jing'an, Wu Shenbo, Zhang Yunsheng, Huang Jinfan, and Chu Huiseng, who are rescue committee experts and Shanghai representatives, Shi Xinsheng, Yu Shouchang, Sun Rongchang, Chen Mingshan, and Xu Yunjiang were also added. It was decided to gather at the Wei Cheng Company on Beijing Road at 2:30 PM today and go by car at 3:00 PM to the Central Bank building on the Bund to meet with Vice Minister Zhang of Finance in person and request that he urge the Yuan Department to issue the bonds quickly, and present a summary. Secondly, the silk factory business tax case was discussed. Chu Huiseng stood up and reported on the situation of the representatives who went to Beijing to visit the heads of the Legislative and Executive Yuan, as well as the ministers of finance and industry, and entertained the officials to discuss the situation. It was the consensus that factory silk is related to international trade and should not be treated the same as other luxury goods. It should be requested that the silk cocoon industry, which sells goods in the business tax rate table, be deleted and exempted from taxation. It was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, etc., requesting permission to exempt business tax in order to maintain the silk industry. Thirdly, the dry cocoon special tax case was discussed. It was the consensus that the previous cocoon donation was eight yuan per hundred catties, plus various surcharges and local miscellaneous donations, for a total of only twelve yuan. Now, it has been changed to a special tax, which taxes ten yuan per hundred catties. On the surface, it seems to be reduced by two yuan, but in reality, adding various surcharges will cost about fifteen or sixteen yuan, which is a heavier burden for silk merchants and is difficult to comply with. It was decided that all silk factories would jointly stamp and submit a petition to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, etc., requesting complete reduction and exemption in order to lighten the burden and fund development. Fourthly, the Factory Law was discussed. Wang Xiaolai reported on the situation of going to Beijing to visit Chairman Jiang, etc., and requesting permission to extend the implementation date to August 1st. It was the consensus that the various articles of the Factory Law are too restrictive, and the industry has difficulty complying with them. It was decided to submit petitions to the Yuan Department, ordering them to revise them. Fifthly, the coal industry sent a letter requesting an increase in the package price. The chairman reported that various coal companies had repeatedly sent letters stating that the current coal price is soaring, the source is not sustainable, and the inventory is getting thinner. They requested that the package price for each factory be increased by eight cents per car (the original price was 30 cents per silk car). It was decided to send a letter in reply to reject the request. Finally, the weights and measures case was discussed. The attending members conducted a thorough discussion, and the meeting adjourned at more than 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Commercial Tail-End Finds Will Abolish Li and Use Fen</h3>
<p>▲ Silver and Money Industries are in Contact</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the unit of calculation for the amount of money needed for commercial imports and exports is "fen" for Western merchants and "li" for Chinese merchants. The procedure is particularly cumbersome, but the habit is long-standing and unbreakable. It is now heard that the financial community has proposed that, starting from February 19th or March 1st of this year, following the example of Western merchants, the tail-end numbers of silver dollars will also be calculated in "fen." If there are "li" numbers below "fen," they will be rounded up or down using the rounding method (for example, four "li" will be deleted, and five "li" will be calculated as one "fen"). This proposal has been exchanged between the silver and money industries. If there are no other obstacles, it will be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Sun Baoqi's Funeral Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲ Yan Huiqing and Others Send Telegrams of Condolence</p>
<p>Former Premier Sun Baoqi passed away in his Shanghai residence the night before last, as detailed in this newspaper. It is now learned that Sun's relatives and friends from all over the country, such as Duan Qirui, Cao Kun, Yan Huiqing, and Yuan Yuntai, sent telegrams of condolence yesterday. The minor funeral is scheduled for today, and the major funeral will be held tomorrow (the 6th) at Wei time (1-3 PM). His coffin is specially made of Phoebe nanmu wood, and it is said that it will follow the custom of Hangzhou, and will be moved to the main hall after being placed in the coffin.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegram Urging Provincial Federations of Commerce to Reorganize</h3>
<p>▲ Preparing to Elect Representatives to the National Assembly</p>
<p>The All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent telegrams yesterday to: All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang; Zhejiang Merchant Organization Unification Committee; Guangdong Chamber of Commerce Organization Guidance Committee; General Chambers of Commerce in Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang; County Chambers of Commerce in Xining and Ningxia; and Municipal Chambers of Commerce in Tianjin, Nanjing, and Qingdao. It said: The reorganization of the Federation of Commerce and the Chambers of Commerce has been urged by this Federation several times in the past, but it has not been completed within the time limit. This Federation deeply regrets that the National Assembly is scheduled to be held on May 1st of this year. Recently, the central government has stipulated the number of representatives from our Chambers of Commerce. If the Federation of Commerce fails to complete the reorganization by then, there may be many obstacles to the selection of representatives. Accordingly, another earnest telegram is sent to the Provincial Federations of Commerce and the Unification Committees/Guidance Committees, urging them to immediately supervise the Chambers of Commerce in the province to reorganize within a time limit; the General County Chambers of Commerce where the provincial governments are located should supervise the reorganization of the Chambers of Commerce in the province and initiate the convening of the Provincial Federation of Commerce; the Municipal Chambers of Commerce should immediately seek reorganization themselves. Once the reorganization is completed, they should immediately report to this Federation. This is extremely important. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, and Peng Chuli, respectfully knock.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Inspection Group Cables Thanks to Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Ye Youcai, He Zijing, Yuan Zongyao, Zhang Lingzhou, and other members of the Nanyang Islands Inspection Group went to the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation in Jiu'an Lane at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 4th) to report on the inspection situation in the Nanyang Islands. Jiang Zhonghe, Fang Jiange, Sun Choucheng, Sun Jiren, Shen Mengshi, and others from the Federation came out to greet them. After discussion, everyone agreed that they had been warmly welcomed in various ports during this trip. Now that they have returned to China, they should send a telegram to express their thanks. The telegram was immediately sent as follows: To the General Chambers of Commerce, the Consulate, various organizations, and newspapers in Annam Southern, Singapore, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Penang, Siam, Medan, Jakarta: This mission went to your place to inspect commerce, and we are deeply grateful for your kind reception. We arrived safely in Shanghai on the 2nd and are sending this telegram to express our thanks. Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation Nanyang Islands Inspection Group respectfully knocks.</p>
<h3>Responsibility for Commercial Firm's Letters, Seals, and Guarantees</h3>
<p>▲ Commercial Firms and Their Shareholders and Owners Should Be Responsible</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to explain the issue of responsibility for commercial firms' letters, seals, and guarantees on behalf of others, sent a letter to lawyer Liu Shifang yesterday, stating: I am replying directly. I received your letter stating that there are two views on the issue of the store owner's responsibility when a commercial firm's manager uses the firm's letters and seals to guarantee on behalf of others. One view is that the store owner is also fully responsible, and the other is that the store owner should not be responsible for matters handled by the manager. Each view has its own reasons, and you are instructed to interpret them. After investigating the business practices in the commercial world, the commercial firm's letters and seals represent the commercial firm. The status of a commercial firm is that of a legal person, and the organizers of the commercial firm are the shareholders or owners of the commercial firm. Therefore, for all matters, since the commercial firm's letters and seals have been affixed, the commercial firm is naturally directly responsible, and in practice, the shareholders or owners are indirectly responsible. Because the reason why others trust this seal is that the commercial firm is reliable, and whether the commercial firm is reliable or not depends solely on the credit of its shareholders or store owners. Therefore, the commercial firm's seal can provide guarantees for goods and money in commercial transactions. As for the managers and partners in the commercial firm, they are legally employees, and employees are responsible to the store owner. Therefore, as your letter states, those who use the commercial firm's letters and seals to guarantee on behalf of others are directly the commercial firm, and indirectly the shareholders or store owners of the commercial firm. It cannot be explained by whether they knew about it beforehand or not whether they are responsible or not. Assuming that this letter was indeed issued without the consent of the shareholders or store owners, or if it is stated in the commercial firm's agreement that the seal is not allowed to be used to guarantee on behalf of others (but this does not apply to matters within the scope of the store's business), the method is only to have the shareholders or store owners of the commercial firm first acknowledge this responsibility, and then have the shareholders or store owners order the sealers to bear all the responsibilities that should be borne. It is absolutely impossible to shirk responsibility to the sealers and unload all responsibility. A corresponding letter is replied, hoping that you will check and abide by it.</p>
<h3>Announcement on Determining the Collection of Interest from Pawnshops</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued an announcement yesterday, stating: I have received instructions from the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, stating: I have received instructions from the Provincial Government, stating: According to a report from the Construction Department, the amended Rules for Pawnshop Business in this province have been announced and implemented. Later, the Provincial Pawnshop Association submitted a report stating that Article 16 of the Rules stated that if it is more than one month to five days, half a month's interest will be charged; if it is more than fifteen days, one month's interest will be charged, etc. According to the interpretation of common laws and regulations, it seems that half a month's interest should be charged after five days, and one month's interest should be charged after fifteen days. Please interpret this to show caution, etc. After reporting, the Governor instructed to handle it in accordance with the Association's request, etc. After separately informing and announcing the relevant counties, it was recorded that in December of last year, pawnshop owners from various counties convened a meeting at the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce and publicly submitted a request to temporarily postpone the implementation of Article 16 of the Pawnshop Rules, etc. The Provincial Pawnshop Association also submitted the same request, and the Governor ordered that this case had been rejected in the previous report, etc., ordering to be informed. Now, county magistrates from Jinshan, Changshu, Wuxian, Taixing, Taixian, Chongming, Nanhui, Qingpu, and other counties have separately reported the previous situation. In addition to issuing separate instructions not to allow it, there is a sincere concern that pawnshop owners in various counties may make excuses to request postponement and not comply with the previous clause to calculate interest, which concerns the legal interests of the poor. It is proposed that the Governor instruct the county magistrates of the sixty-one counties to quickly comply and announce it to the public in order to benefit the poor and avoid delays, etc. After investigating this case, the pawnshop representatives from various counties, such as Cao Deliang, etc., submitted a request to temporarily postpone the implementation, which was decided by the 361st meeting of this government's committee not to allow it, and instructions were issued to notify all pawnshops to abide by it. Now, according to the previous situation, it is appropriate to order the department to quickly inform the counties and instruct the pawnshops under their jurisdiction to comply with it and announce it to the public. This order is given for this reason, and except for separate orders, it is appropriate to order the county magistrate to quickly instruct the pawnshops under their jurisdiction to comply with it and announce it to the public. This order is given for this reason. In addition to separate orders to comply with it, it is appropriate to announce it so that pawnshops and all kinds of people should comply with it and not violate it. This announcement is given for this reason.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Explosives Inspection Fee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Fireworks Industry Association, requesting that the Fujian explosives inspection fee be canceled and forwarded to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. Now, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs has approved a reply, ordering the Fujian Saltpeter Bureau to temporarily suspend the collection.</p>
<h3>Continued Record of Baoshan County Administrative Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Second General Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The first general meeting of the third session of the Baoshan County Administrative Conference has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the second general meeting continued yesterday starting at 10:00 AM. Twenty people attended. The chairman was County Magistrate Qiu Mingjiu, and the recorders were Zhang Ruyu and Chen Hongmo. It was decided to discuss cases from case 26 to case 68, which were separately passed, retained, reviewed, or agreed upon in order to implement them.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Association Requests the Burning of Persian Opium Again</h3>
<p>▲ Seized on a German Ship in November Last Year</p>
<p>The large quantity of Persian opium seized by customs on the German cargo ship Klossol in November of last year, totaling 19,400 pounds, is worth more than one million yuan. It is learned that this opium was privately transported by the Japanese, and the Japanese authorities have requested its return. This case has not yet been resolved. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has repeatedly received inquiries from various organizations and individuals and has repeatedly requested the authorities to submit the opium for burning, but this has not been done. In addition to devising methods to resist, the Association also sent a letter yesterday to the Central Prohibition Committee, requesting that the Ministry of Finance be consulted and ordered the Jianghai Customs to submit the opium for burning as soon as possible in order to emphasize the prohibition and satisfy public opinion.</p>
<h3>Jishui Association's Summary of Relief Efforts in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>▲ More Than 10,000 People Eating Gruel</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jishui Association recently received a report from Lu Jun Hefu and Dai Jun Fashan of the Chang'an branch in Shaanxi stating that the number of people eating gruel at the four gruel factories originally run in the east, west, south, and north of Wugong County has increased to more than 10,000. Nearby counties have also heard that there are four gruel factories nearby, and people are flocking to eat, making it difficult to cope. They have no choice but to request that dry food be given instead, in accordance with the methods of the North China Disaster Relief Association. Otherwise, they will have to add two more gruel factories to relieve the suffering people. 1,000 sets of newly made cotton clothes have been transported to Wugong and selectively distributed. The cost of the clothes is 1,850 yuan, and they have requested that the money be delivered to the Yuanji Inn in Houmalu and exchanged at the Jifeng Houhao. It is heard that the Association delivered the money to the Hongfeng Zhuang yesterday.</p>
<h3>A Monk's Medical Practice is Resented</h3>
<p>▲ Life is Not Bad, with Rich Income</p>
<p>▲ Jealous Colleagues Gather to Extort Money</p>
<p>The monk Han Jiang, registered in Nantong, is quite knowledgeable in medicine and practices medicine at 27 Fenzhou Road, Yangshupu. He also gives medicine to the poor and sick. The nearby villagers in the area, who are concerned about collecting firewood, all come to his door for treatment. His life is not bad. Xie Dichen, a Jiangbei native in the area, also practices medicine, but his income is not as rich as Han Jiang's. Therefore, he turned from envy to jealousy. On the evening of the second day, Han Jiang had already gone to bed when he suddenly heard a knock. He ordered the porter to ask. The person outside said that a sick family had specially asked Han Jiang to make a house call. But listening carefully, it seemed that there was more than one person outside. Han Jiang was worried about an accident and said that if they really wanted to see a doctor, they should wait until the next morning. The people outside then began to scold him and knocked on the door more violently. He then ordered the porter to open the door, and saw Xie Dichen leading several people in, saying to Han Jiang, "We are colleagues, but you alone are making a huge profit. Now that the end of the year is approaching, it is difficult to survive. Allow us to borrow 1,000 gold coins, or don't blame us for not having the feelings of a colleague." Han Jiang refused, and Xie and his accomplices left angrily. At 9:00 AM the next morning, Han Jiang was hanging up his sign when Xie and his colleagues Xu Bohua and Li Yuanfang suddenly arrived again, still demanding 1,000 gold coins and preventing him from hanging up his sign, causing a disturbance for a long time before leaving at noon. They went again at the end of the day. If he didn't give them money, they would kill him in three days. During the argument, Han Jiang's maid, Yu Songshi, secretly exited from the back door and reported to the 2115th Huapu, saying that there was a robbery in her employer's house. The Huapu then reported to the police station by telephone, and sent detective Pang Ruiqing and a Western detective to rush to the scene. After investigation, it was confirmed that it was extortion rather than robbery, and the three, Xie, etc., were arrested. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng Shide questioned them. Ru Baoyi, the police station's lawyer, stated that this matter was entirely caused by jealousy among colleagues and requested an investigation. Then, Han Jiang, his gatekeeper Yu Youshan, and his maid Yu Songshi, successively described the three times that the defendants had come to extort money. Questioning Xie, Xu, and Li, they all denied it. Judge Feng finished the questioning and ordered the defendants to be returned to prison to await a scheduled sentence.</p>
<h3>Record of Divorce of an Old Husband and Young Wife</h3>
<p>▲ Cheng Suisheng Breaks Away from the Hu Family</p>
<p>Hu Zhaoxi, a Xiaoshan native residing at 1 Yuyang Lane, Pushi Road in the French Concession, who was in the foreign goods business, took his own life on the 31st of last month because he knew his fate. The family had requested and been granted permission by the Public Concession to waive the autopsy. It is now learned that the reason for Hu's suicide was that his business had failed in recent years, the environment was bad, and as a result, he had a mental breakdown. After his wife died, he married Cheng Suisheng, a Suzhou woman, as his successor in May of last year. She is 18 years old. The old husband and young wife often quarreled. A few days ago, he was trying to get friends to mediate, but it had not been settled when the accident suddenly happened. Now that the funeral is over, Hu Tinglong, born to his previous wife, still asked friends and acquaintances to reopen negotiations at Jin Yu's law firm yesterday to discuss breaking away from the family relationship. As a result of the negotiations, in addition to Hu Tinglong repaying Cheng Suisheng 1,500 silver dollars, other Gengtie and marriage certificates were taken out on the spot, and a certificate was issued.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Person Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Qin Chunsheng, a Jiangbei native, 40 years old, checked into the Xinkang Inn on Mill Street in the French Concession the night before last. Recently, because he had been unemployed for a long time and his life was difficult, he suddenly had the idea of dying and secretly swallowed raw opium in an attempt to end his life. At about 4:00 AM the next morning, the poison took effect and he could not be controlled. His moans reached outside. The tea room attendant noticed and took him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the rescue was ineffective, and he died at 9:00 AM. The hospital transferred the body to Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await autopsy.</p>
<h3>A Car Disappears</h3>
<p>The China Motor Company on Baoshan Road in Zhabei lost a car the night before last. The license plate numbers are City 748 and Concession 17960. After the theft, the company immediately reported it to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for investigation, but as of yesterday there were still no clues.</p>
<h3>A Punch Kills a Man</h3>
<p>▲ The Result of Rickshaw Pullers Competing for Business</p>
<p>Wang Dalang, a native of Haimen Town west of Jiangwan Town, and his younger brother Wang Qilang, currently 20 years old, both earn a living pulling rickshaws. Around 4 PM the day before yesterday, Qilang rented a rickshaw from the rickshaw company opened by Li Yingxiang, a Hebei native, at that location. While touting for business along the way, he soon found a customer. As they were discussing the fare, a rickshaw pulled by Gu Gendi forcibly snatched the customer away. Qilang, extremely angry and unwilling to give up, stepped forward, hoping to retrieve the customer. Unexpectedly, Gu suddenly struck his waist with a powerful punch. A sound of "Ai yo" was heard, and Qilang fell to the ground, motionless. Gu, thinking he was faking it, ignored him and continued pushing the rickshaw. After a while, passersby noticed that he remained motionless for a long time, and upon approaching, they saw that his face was pale, and he was frothing at the mouth, on the verge of death. They quickly sent him back to the rickshaw company and called his elder brother, Dalang. He was still able to say that he had been beaten by Gu Gendi. Just as they were about to send him to the hospital for treatment, he died. Dalang, grieving deeply over his brother's tragic death, immediately reported to the Fifth Precinct of the Fifth Public Security Bureau, ordering the police to detain the murderer, Gu Gendi, and summon the rickshaw owner, Li Yingxiang. According to the elder brother of the deceased, his brother was about to get married next month, but now he has been beaten to death, and he demands justice. Gu Gendi, 22 years old, confessed that it was an accidental act and not intentional, pleading for leniency. Since the case involves a human life, besides ordering the local warden to report to the court for an autopsy, Gu and others will be sent to the Judicial Section for interrogation and handling.</p>

<h3>The Origin of the Heavy Fog in This Port</h3>
<p>▲ Blown in from the Annam Region</p>
<p>For the past few days, there has been a heavy fog blanketing the area around the waterfront of Shanghai. The fog is particularly dense, making it impossible to see anything beyond a few yards. Foreign and coastal ships have been delaying their arrival in Shanghai to avoid the fog. For example, on the day before yesterday, only the Xinjiangtian and Ningxing vessels entered port. In the shipping industry, this has truly been unseen for many years. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, this fog was blown in from the Annam region, spreading along the coast and the Yangtze River basin. When it encountered the cold air of northern China, it became even denser. It is feared that it will not completely dissipate in the next day or two. What is even more strange is that since the fog descended, the weather has become noticeably warmer. Checking the weather on January 31st, the first day the fog was observed, the lowest temperature in this port was 40 degrees, and the highest was 48 degrees. On February 1st, the lowest increased to 41 degrees, and the highest rose to 54 degrees. On February 2nd, the fog became even heavier, and the temperature also increased, with the lowest increasing to 41.9 degrees and the highest reaching 53.6 degrees. The last two days have been even warmer. This kind of temperature is not common in late winter and early spring.</p>
<h3>Du Miaojuan's Divorce Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲ Once Reached a Settlement Out of Court</p>
<p>▲ Cao Qinye Lacks Money to Cope</p>
<p>▲ Miaojuan Loves Her Three Children Dearly</p>
<p>▲ The Judge Earnestly Advises Reconciliation</p>
<p>▲ Having Borne One Son and Two Daughters Cao Rangzhi, who once served as the director of the Shatin Bureau, has a son named Qinye, currently 24 years old. He works in the accounting department of the Japanese-owned Gongda Spinning Factory. In the 14th year, he married Miaojuan, the daughter of physician Du Jingxian. They are the same age and have been married for six years, bearing two daughters and one son. One daughter is five years old, and the other is four years old. The son is only three years old. However, the couple's relationship has never been very harmonious, though not absolutely hostile, so they have managed to maintain it for several years.</p>
<p>▲ Filing for Divorce After Being Beaten It was not until February 1st of last year, after Ms. Du was beaten and injured, that they had a major falling out. She returned to her parents' home for medical treatment and filed a lawsuit in court. The matter was then settled through reconciliation. Now, due to unresolved issues, Ms. Du hired lawyer Xu Bingcheng to file a divorce lawsuit against Cao in the Special District Local Court, requesting a divorce decree, recovery of dowry, living expenses, and medical expenses. She also requested that the two daughters be returned to her custody, while the son would be raised by the defendant. This case was previously heard once by the Special District Court, which ordered them to attempt reconciliation out of court. Now, because reconciliation is difficult to achieve,</p>
<p>▲ Four Conditions for Reconciliation Therefore, at 10 AM yesterday morning, Judge Yang opened the tenth court to continue the hearing. The plaintiff, Du Miaojuan, and her lawyers, Du Lingjun and Xu Bingcheng, the defendant, Cao Qinye, and his lawyer, Qu Yue, were all present in court. After the trial began, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff had proposed the following conditions for reconciliation: (1) The defendant should apologize to the plaintiff; (2) The defendant should bear the medical expenses; (3) The defendant should be responsible for the children's education expenses; (4) The plaintiff's future livelihood should be guaranteed. If the defendant can fully fulfill these conditions, the couple's relationship can be restored, and they can continue to live together.</p>
<p>▲ The Judge Strongly Urges Reconciliation Judge Yang then questioned the defendant, Cao Qinye, stating that the plaintiff has now proposed conditions for reconciliation. Except for the second item, medical expenses of 1,200 yuan, the first item, an apology, is not a problem. For the third item, children's education, and the fourth item, future living expenses, since you are already living together as a couple, you should naturally be responsible. Therefore, if you can give the plaintiff 1,000 yuan now, you can reconcile. However, Cao stated that he works as an accountant in the factory and only earns 40 yuan per month, so he is unable to afford this large sum. Judge Yang also said that it is not difficult to borrow or gather 1,000 yuan from relatives and friends. Furthermore, since you are a couple, although the 1,000 yuan is given to the plaintiff, it still belongs to you in reality. You should know that if you proceed with the divorce, you will lose even more. Therefore, in the opinion of this court, reconciliation is still the best option. Cao stated that he is willing to reconcile, but he lacks the means. The plaintiff, Du Miaojuan, immediately stated that the defendant is not sincere about reconciliation. Judge Yang asked the plaintiff how much money she wants for items three and four. The plaintiff replied that she needs 200 yuan per month.</p>
<p>▲ The Defendant's Brother-in-Law's Statement Judge Yang then summoned the defendant's brother-in-law, Shao Zhongdao, for questioning. Shao stated that the defendant only earns a salary of just over 30 yuan per month at the factory. His father has already passed away, and he only has a stepmother at home. Although his father had some assets when he was alive, they have all been exhausted since his death. Now, not only is there no family property, but he also owes 8,800 yuan. He was also asked if he was present when the plaintiff and defendant fought. Shao replied that he was not present. He later heard that the defendant could not fall asleep, so he went to the study to read the newspaper, but he was refused entry to the room by the plaintiff, which led to the fight.</p>
<p>▲ Current Assets and Property Numbers Judge Yang asked Du Miaojuan if the defendant had any family property at all. Du replied that when she got married, she heard the matchmaker say that he had 100,000 to 200,000 yuan in family property. After marrying, she learned that the defendant had three properties near the Jinshenfu Road in the French Concession. When his father was alive, he also had cash deposits in the Shandong Bank. It is hard to believe that the defendant claims to be poor. After hearing the plaintiff's words, the defendant immediately said that he did own property on Jinshenfu Road, but he has already sold it all. As for the deposits in the Shandong Bank, they have long since vanished due to the bank's collapse. This can be proven by his brother-in-law, Shao Zhongdao. Du Miaojuan also stated that the defendant already earned 30 yuan per month when he entered the factory. Since then, he has received two pay raises each year. It has been six years, so he earns much more than 40 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Willing to Dedicate All His Possessions At this point, Judge Cheng again strongly urged both parties. Cao replied that he is very grateful for the court's kindness, but he lacks the ability to come up with this sum of 1,000 yuan. Furthermore, since they were originally a couple, if they are sincere about reconciliation, why should they haggle over money? He also stated that he is now willing to give all of his monthly income to her for her use. In the future, if he can become wealthy, he can also completely hand it over to her for safekeeping. At this point, Judge Yang again questioned the plaintiff about the events of the beating and the medical certificate. He also asked Du Miaojuan how much alimony she wants. Ren replied 10,000 yuan, and claimed that the defendant has 100,000 to 200,000 yuan in family property. Asking for this amount is not excessive.</p>
<p>▲ Studying the Divorce Issue Judge Yang asked if she would not need to request living expenses if they reconciled. Du replied that it is necessary. He also asked Cao Qinye if he is willing to divorce, since the plaintiff has been like this. Cao replied that he is not willing. He was asked again if he is not willing to divorce, how much money he is willing to give the plaintiff. Cao still replied that he has no money. The plaintiff's lawyer stood up and stated that when the two sides discussed the divorce terms the other day, the plaintiff requested 10,000 yuan in alimony, and the defendant requested a reduction. It can be seen that the defendant is neither sincere about reconciliation nor absolutely without money. Judge Cheng asked Cao Qinye if this was the case. Cao replied that they are extorting him, asking for 12,000 yuan. He also asked Shao Zhongdao if he could assist in negotiating the divorce terms. Shao replied that he cannot assist and must consult his stepmother before proceeding.</p>
<p>▲ Enduring Six Years of Suffering At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Qu Yue, strongly urged both parties to reconcile, saying that the conditions are not a major problem. As for the amount of compensation for medical expenses, the defendant can set the amount himself. The method could be to pay in installments. Judge Yang also said that if you consider the children, it is best not to divorce. Du Miaojuan replied that she is very grateful for the court's intention. It was originally for the sake of the children that she was able to swallow her anger and endure six years of suffering. However, Cao Qinye not only disregarded the feelings of the children but also wanted to take her life, so she filed this divorce lawsuit. Judge Yang then announced that the case cannot be reconciled at this time and must be adjourned until the actual situation of the defendant's family circumstances is investigated and witnesses are summoned, after which arguments will begin. He then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Ningbo Road</h3>
<p>▲ Yongheng Money Shop Robbed Upon Leaving</p>
<p>▲ Three Hundred Yuan Retained, Five Thousand Yuan Snatched</p>
<p>A branch of the Yongheng Bank on Ningbo Road was sending 5,300 yuan in cash to Xingren Lane on the same road yesterday morning. As they were walking west on Shandong Road, three thugs suddenly appeared, blocking the way and robbing 5,000 yuan in cash. The branch staff staggered back to the bank. Aside from crying, there was nothing they could do. Near Happiness Sui Lane, workers were repairing telephones. Seeing the righteousness of the situation, they bravely ran to the police station to report the incident. Upon learning of the incident, the patrolmen immediately pursued the suspects westward. At the intersection of Henan Road, one robber was arrested. He opened fire, was injured, and was captured. The remaining robbers fled with the stolen money, disappearing like yellow cranes. Robberies in broad daylight are not uncommon, but Ningbo Road is an area with many money shops and banks, where security is usually tight. The robbery of a large sum of money on the street and the opening of fire by the police are unprecedented events since the New Year.</p>
<p>▲ Five Thousand Yuan in Banknotes Lightly Parted Between Ningbo Road and Tianjin Road, money shops and banks stand side by side, holding a portion of the Shanghai financial world's power. As the old lunar year draws to a close, businesses are accustomed to settling accounts and collecting money, doing so far more than usual. Yesterday morning around 9:30, the Shanghai Yongheng Bank at No. 86 Ningbo Road was sending 5,300 yuan to a certain shop in Xingren Lane on the same road at their request. Yongheng Bank employees thought that Xingren Lane was close at hand, within sight, and that the sum was not huge, so one person could handle it. Therefore, they ordered branch employee Zhou Bingchen to deliver it alone. However, for the sake of caution, the 5,300 yuan in banknotes was divided into two batches. A small sum of 300 yuan was hidden in his pocket, while the large sum of 5,000 yuan was wrapped in newspaper and held in his hand. To conceal it from prying eyes, they had to use this method of prioritizing the lesser sum. As soon as he left the branch, disaster struck. About thirty or forty steps eastward, three people suddenly emerged. Two people crowded Zhou's shoulders, while one robber stood in front, making a slight bow, and the loud pistol was already pressed against Zhou's chest. Poor Zhou, barely able to regain his composure, watched the banknotes disappear. The robbers were indeed after the 5,000 yuan in the newspaper.</p>
<p>▲ The View from the Top of the Hundred-Foot Pole In the past, Ningbo Road had narrow streets and poor conditions. Today, the area east of Henan Road is lined with grand bank buildings, creating a new atmosphere. Even the Fusuinong and other lanes opposite the Yongheng Bank west of Shandong Road have new, towering buildings, newly renovated. However, because construction has not been long underway, completion is slow, and the relocation of utility poles along the road is a recent event. Because of the relocation of telephone poles at the entrance of Fusu Lane, yesterday there were many workers from the telephone company repairing wires there. From the top of the hundred-foot pole, the ground below is clearly visible. Among them, a certain Mr. Jia witnessed the three robbers attacking Zhou Bingchen in great detail because they were not far away. For a moment, driven by righteous indignation, he roared like a lion and strode forward, following behind the robbers to the intersection of Henan Road, where he informed the patrol police. Therefore, the gun fired, and the robbers were captured. What a pity that the 5,000 yuan in banknotes had already drifted away with the robbers in the gunpowder smoke.</p>
<p>▲ Bullets Fired, Robbers' Pockets Empty After the robbery of the large sum of cash, Zhou Bingchen, due to excessive fright and mental confusion, immediately ran back to the bank. Reaching the steps, he was already weeping with his face covered. When people asked him, he did not answer in detail, so the Yongheng Bank employees initially did not know what had happened to this branch employee. It was not until the patrolmen chased the robbers and passersby shouted that they learned the 5,000 yuan in banknotes had fallen into the hands of the robbers. After receiving the report, the patrol police at the intersection of Henan Road pursued the three robbers. The robbers fled westward and made a gesture of reaching into their pockets for a gun. To preempt them, the police immediately fired their guns, about three shots, hitting two of them. One robber immediately fell to the ground. At this time, many Chinese policemen had already surrounded and assisted. Since each lane and bank on Ningbo Road has armed guards, they rushed out to help when they heard the gunshots. In no time, the Central Police Station also received the news and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to search the scene and arrest the robbers. As if reaching into a bag, the injured robber's pockets were empty. Aside from the pistol weapon, there was nothing else. The so-called 5,000 yuan was nowhere to be found after a thorough search.</p>
<p>▲ Branch Employee Kept Money Safe in His Pocket The injured robber was sent to the Tongren Hospital in a police car for emergency treatment. He claimed to be surnamed Lin, named Dejing, 27 years old, from Jiangbei. He had two gunshot wounds on his body, one in the buttocks and one in the head. Later, this robber was transferred to the Public Concession Hospital. Detectives also discovered that his accomplices lived in the Central Hotel, so they rushed there and arrested two male and one female suspects. As for Zhou Bingchen, the Yongheng Bank branch employee, holding the 300 yuan in banknotes that remained in his pocket, he could not help but reflect on his pain, but as a survivor of the robbery, unharmed, he could be considered very lucky.</p>
<h3>The Dong Yu Divorce Case</h3>
<p>▲ Hope for Reconciliation</p>
<p>In the case where lawyer Dong Yu sued his wife, Jiang Youzhi, for suffering from lung disease and requested a divorce, the court yesterday again gathered to continue the hearing. The plaintiff first stated that the plaintiff had followed the court's instructions and reconciled with the defendant, Ms. Jiang, out of court. Unexpectedly, the defendant suddenly submitted another petition urging the trial, for unknown reasons. He now presents the settlement note from the defendant's lawyer for review. The defendant's lawyer stated that a certain person surnamed Fan did contact our lawyer the other day to negotiate a settlement. Our lawyer then listed the settlement terms and handed them to Mr. Fan. That evening, they scheduled a negotiation in Room 239 of the New World Hotel. Both the plaintiff and defendant arrived, and as a result, the plaintiff was willing to issue a check for 3,000 yuan as a settlement fee. At that time, the defendant thought that her uncle, Dong Banghan, had not arrived, and that the plaintiff was issuing a check and not cash, so it did not materialize and broke up. According to witness Dong Kang, representing lawyer Sheng Shengxiu, just as he was about to speak, the plaintiff Dong Yu vehemently opposed, saying that according to the law, witnesses have no right to have lawyers come to the case and speak. He requested that the court prohibit it, but both the plaintiff and defendant are already sincere about reconciliation. How can a third party be allowed to come out and manipulate? Furthermore, the defendant herself has entrusted accountant Pan Zhaobang to come out and reconcile, which can be proven. The defendant's lawyer also stated that since the plaintiff intends to reconcile, he requested that the court order the money to be deposited with the court for an on-the-spot settlement. Then, the two parties debated for a long time. Judge Gong ruled that the plaintiff should be ordered to hand over the money to the case next Monday for further verification.</p>
<h3>Zou Aizhen Counter-Sues Tang Huixuan</h3>
<p>▲ Trial to Begin at 2 PM Today</p>
<p>Economic Doctor Tang Huixuan sued his wife, Zou Aizhen, for adultery with Chen Genwei. A decision not to prosecute has already been issued. However, during the litigation of this case, Zou Aizhen also counter-sued Tang for false accusation and bigamy. The District Court Prosecutor's Office yesterday ordered both parties to be summoned for questioning at 2 PM today. The questioner will still be Prosecutor Wu Shixin.</p>
<h3>Accomplices in the Zhao Assassination Case Indicted Together</h3>
<p>▲ Preliminary Hearing Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Xia Shaoen, an accomplice in the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, has been indicted by the District Court. The Public Security Bureau has now transferred the arrested principals, Wang Jingshan and Cheng Haibo, to the District Court. Therefore, Prosecutor Wu interrogated Wang Jingshan, Cheng Haibo, and Xia Shaoen for a long time yesterday. The preliminary hearing has already concluded, and they have been indicted together.</p>
<h3>Cause of the Salty Taste of Zhabei Tap Water</h3>
<p>▲ Does Not Harm Health</p>
<p>Recently, the tap water in Zhabei has tasted slightly salty. When asked about this by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, it was said that the reason is that the water plant is located downstream of the Huangpu River, and the Yangtze River's water level is low, making it easier for the sea tide to enter. The water plant has taken precautions, and the chemists test the mixed water every half hour. They only turn on the machines to draw water when the salt content is low. However, the tides have been very strong in recent days. The chloride content in the mixed water in the Huangpu River is at most over two thousand three hundred, and the average is about five hundred parts per million. However, this salty taste does not harm health and is perfectly safe to use. In a day or two, after the tide passes, it will return to its original state.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Special Commissioner David Heath Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Will Travel to North China</p>
<p>David Heath, the Honorary Commissioner of the International Rotary Club, has arrived in Shanghai with his wife and daughter, Mijiaoli, and several others. They are staying at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. Twenty-six years ago, Mr. Heath was the US Consul General in Shanghai, handling diplomatic affairs in the Far East for a total of eight years. He recently organized a Rotary branch in Hong Kong. On the opening day, there were a total of more than 130 members. It is said that Mr. Heath will travel to North China via the Jinpu Railway within this week.</p>
<h3>Eight Immortals Bridge Market Holds Daily Lottery for Locations</h3>
<p>▲ The Chinese Ratepayers Association Sends Personnel to Supervise the Lottery</p>
<p>▲ Small Vendor Representatives Unexpectedly Fail to be Selected</p>
<p>The stall locations at the Eight Immortals Bridge Market in the French Concession have been assigned by lottery in recent days. During the lottery, to prevent impersonation or fraud, the French Municipal Council specially arranged for the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to send personnel to supervise. Therefore, the Association specially sent committee member Cheng Zhusun, carrying the vendor registration forms, to verify with the Municipal Council that there were no errors. The lottery was held at 2 PM on the afternoons of the day before yesterday and yesterday. When the vendors entered, vendor representatives Chen Yunqing, Wei Azhang, Zhang Chuanyan, Zhu Yuxing, Yu Ade, and others, together with Municipal Council personnel, inspected the permits at the door to ensure that the names matched before allowing entry. Therefore, the lottery method was very fair, and each lottery number was inspected by vendor representatives, Association committee member Cheng, and others before being inserted into the lottery drum, and then the lottery was drawn separately. Unexpectedly, as a result of the lottery, the representatives who had worked hard to advocate for all the vendors were not selected. The stall locations they received were all of the worst quality. For example, Chen Achang (one of the representatives) received a location next to the public toilet. In disappointment, he was willing to sacrifice his permit and destroyed it himself. All the vendors witnessed this and praised the representatives for handling matters fairly. It is said that they will have special measures to reward Mr. Chen.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Urges the Relocation of Dock Coal and Charcoal Shops</h3>
<p>▲ To Build Dock Public Toilets</p>
<p>There are coal and charcoal shops such as Gonghexing, Hongji, and Qiaji on the banks of docks with numbers 5, 6, and 7 in South Shanghai, which store coal and charcoal. Due to excessive loads, the banks are in danger. Furthermore, the piled coal and charcoal, as tall as the buildings, affects the appearance and fire safety of the docks. After the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau took over the docks, it was limited to before January 15th, all of which were to be relocated. After the merchants expressed their difficulties, the extension was extended to January 27th. On this day, the merchants relocated all the piled coal and charcoal in heavy snow. The Engineering Bureau completely demolished the dilapidated wooden houses in the area, creating a new look. In addition, the original dock public toilets were insufficient and poorly equipped. The surroundings of the toilets reeked. The former Port Authority had previously worked with the Health Bureau to survey the locations for additional public toilets, ordering the cleaning contractor to handle them, but no construction was started. The Public Utilities Bureau believes that the cleanliness of the docks is related to the appearance of the city for both Chinese and foreigners and cannot be ignored. It has consulted with the Health Bureau, ordering the cleaning contractor to build new-style public toilets with pumping equipment. On January 29th, it sent representatives from the Health, Public Security, Land, and Engineering Bureaus to survey six locations, including docks 1, 3, 10, and 15 and the north ends of the Dachuzhan and Wanyu docks, to build public toilets, with docks 1 and 3 being the first to be built.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Employee Thrift Savings Measures</h3>
<p>▲ Money Deposited in the Shanghai Municipal Bank</p>
<p>▲ Implemented Starting in January</p>
<p>To promote thrift among employees and in view of the poor environment in Shanghai, where young people with unstable minds are particularly vulnerable to falling into depravity, the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau has formulated employee thrift savings measures. It was approved at the 160th Bureau Affairs Meeting and submitted to the Municipal Government for review and filing. It was specially discussed and resolved by the Municipal Council, and the Bureau will first conduct a trial run for half a year to observe the effectiveness. The measures are mandatory for single employees and voluntary for non-single employees and have been implemented since January of this year. A total of 25 single employees have saved 272.50 yuan, and 12 non-single employees have saved 144.50 yuan. In addition, one public servant has also saved 5 yuan. In total, 38 people have saved 422 yuan. The money is entrusted to the Municipal Bank for safekeeping because its interest rate is higher than other banks.</p>
<h3>Western Clothing Industry Asks for a Reduction in Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Clothing Industry Association yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Tax Regulations Research Committee, saying: "Respectfully, for the matter of requesting a submission to the authorities of Beijing, provinces, and cities, please allow a reduction of business tax rate for the Western clothing and woolen industry. The National Government abolished the likin tax, originally to eliminate harmful commercial practices and bad governance. The provinces use business tax to offset the likin tax revenue. Merchants and citizens, in order to respect the central government's regulations, should strive to pay. However, the determination of the business tax rate, if too high or too low, will inevitably become an exorbitant tax, which merchants and citizens find difficult to bear. According to the Outline for the Collection of Business Tax by the Provinces promulgated by the National Government, the collection of business tax should not exceed two per thousand. Western clothing and woolens are at the head of the four essentials of human life. Although they mostly involve the sale of foreign goods, woolens are daily necessities and cannot be compared to luxury goods. At this time when there are no comparable domestic substitutes and there is no need for bans, Western clothing is related to international affairs. The National Dress Code does not prohibit it, so it is needed just like ordinary secondhand clothing, and cannot be regarded as a luxury item or in need of bans. The amount of business tax collected from our industry does not comply with Article 4 of the Outline. Furthermore, the raw materials of ordinary secondhand clothing are not necessarily all domestic products, and the Western clothing industry is striving to use domestic products, so the amount of business tax collected from our industry does not comply with Article 7 of the supplementary measures to the Outline. Moreover, the business profits of our industry are extremely small. Since the increase in tariffs due to the preciousness of gold and the cheapness of silver, it has been difficult to maintain. If the current collection method of Jiangsu Province must be implemented, then the meager profits of our industry's hard work each year will be completely paid to business tax, which is still not enough. In two or three years, they will inevitably be bankrupted, and the livelihoods of all the industry's workers will also be cut off. The dangerous future is unthinkable. Concerning the lives of the people, the peace of society, we must sincerely ask your committee to submit a request to the authorities, please reduce the business tax rate for the Western clothing and woolen industry to at most two per thousand, in order to maintain people's livelihood and benefit commercial transportation. This is the purpose of this letter."</p>
<h3>Opening Date for the Lu Yifang Appeal Case</h3>
<p>▲ 2 PM on the Sixth</p>
<p>Actress Hu Die of the Star Film Company had a problem with her fiancé, Lin Xuehuai, regarding the termination of their engagement. Because the Sanri Daily published an article entitled "Hu Lin Divorce Record," which stated that Hu had entered the red dust and depended on people to be a small star, Hu believed that the newspaper intentionally defamed her reputation and hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to send a letter of correction. After the correction, the newspaper published a photo of the company's male actor, Zhu Fei, with a caption "A Key Figure in the Xue Die Divorce." Hu even more believed that it was deliberately destroying her reputation and filed a criminal self-accusation with the Special District Court. On the afternoon of December 29th last year, after Judge Feng tried the case, he immediately sentenced Lu Yifang to damage to another person's reputation and fined him 300 yuan. If the fine is converted to imprisonment, two yuan will be deducted for each day. Lu Yifang declared in court that he did not accept the appeal. It is now known that Lu has hired another lawyer, Jiang Yiping, to represent him. The case is scheduled to open at 2 PM on the sixth, and there will be another eloquent debate at that time.</p>
<h3>Russian Accused of Opening Gambling Den Case Concludes Debate</h3>
<p>▲ Sentencing set for next Wednesday</p>
<p>The case of Gao Laisi Regaof, Chairman of the Russian Military Association, accusing Ai Haiyingpeng Fan Chelin of embezzling funds from the association to open a gambling den, was heard yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM by Judge Cheng Shangfeng in the Fifth Court. Both defendants and their representing lawyers were present in court. After Judge Cheng ascended the bench, the plaintiff's lawyer, Qiu Fen,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>submitted a piece of evidence to Judge Cheng to question Fan Chelin. (The evidence was a contract between Fan Chelin and Bao Men for the distribution of commissions.) The judge asked Fan Chelin whether the signature on the contract was indeed his. Fan answered that it was. The judge asked, "Who made the contract?" Fan answered that he did not know. The judge then asked, "If you didn't know, why did you sign it?" Fan answered, "I was in a position of arbitration, so I signed it." After Judge Cheng questioned this far, he announced the start of the debate. After plaintiff's lawyer Qiu, and defendant's lawyer Wei, debated the three items of (1) opening a gambling den, (2) embezzling from the association, and (3) making false accusations, Judge Cheng asked the plaintiff if they had anything to add. The plaintiff then stated, "(1) I did not use a handgun to threaten him, (2) Ai Haiyingpeng is merely the facade, and Fan Chelin is the mastermind, (3) the military association must publish various military books and reports every month, and this matter should not be allowed to stop it. At the same time, since this association was originally a military association, opening a gambling den should be prohibited." Judge Cheng then asked Ai Haiyingpeng if he had anything to add. Ai then stated, "I am the manager of the association. Matters within the association cannot be asked of me. It is like a bank collapsing; you should ask the owner, not the manager." Fan Chelin stated, "I do not know about this matter. I only acted as a guarantor on the contract, and I do not know anything else." Judge Cheng then announced the conclusion of the debate on the case and set the sentencing for 2:00 PM next Wednesday. The defendants, Ai Haiyingpeng and Fan Chelin, and the counter-defendant, Gao Laisi Regaof, were each released on bail of a shop guarantee or 1,000 yuan in cash before leaving the court.</p>
<h3>Ka Ming Li Robbery Case Solved</h3>
<p>▲ More than half of the stolen goods have been recovered</p>
<p>On the 24th of last month, the home of Qian Meiting, a Ningbo jeweler at No. 25 Kai Ming Li, Nine Acres, South City, was robbed of a large amount of jewelry and diamonds by violent thieves, and one Zhu Rufa was shot and wounded. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the case was solved the day before yesterday. Although there were brief reports in the newspapers, due to the investigation, it was inconvenient to disclose all the details. It is now learned that the case has been completely solved, and more than half of the stolen goods have been recovered. The detailed process is described below. After the case occurred, Yuan Liang, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, immediately instructed the district offices and teams to solve the case, recover the stolen goods, and arrest the real thieves within a time limit. After receiving the instruction, Lu Ying, the head of the Detective Squad, immediately summoned all the lead detectives for a briefing and supervised them to go to various entertainment venues and hotels in the British and French Concessions for secret investigations. Until the 29th of last month, the leader Qi Haitian reported that the ringleader of the robbery, nicknamed "Little Guangdong" (Wu Chaofang, also known as "Little Ya"), was hiding at No. 3 Jinxiu Fang, Huanghe Road, French Concession. After receiving the report, Captain Lu immediately dispatched detectives Zhang Guangsen, Miao Jinhai, Zhou Peisan, Ling Tianpeng, Yan Zhuming, Zhang Yingpin, etc., together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Police Department, to disguise and wait at the location. At around 3:00 PM on the 30th, they saw five thieves coming from outside and entering the house at No. 3. Seeing that the thieves had entered the house, Qi and the others bravely stepped forward and completely captured the five thieves. They found a diamond-encrusted jade duck egg ring in the house. The five thieves then led them to the Zhongxing Hotel on Xiafei Road, as well as No. 17 on that road, and the Anle Hotel and Nanjing Hotel on Caishi Street, where they arrested Chen Jinsheng, Lu Heshang, and Zhu Genbao. They also seized eleven diamonds. Lu Heshang and Chen Jinsheng then confessed that their accomplice, Liu Guisheng, was hiding at No. 692 Fangbang Road. They arrested Liu and seized seven bullets. There are still accomplices at large, and the investigation is continuing to prevent any from escaping.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Social Bureau to Maintain the Interests of Depositors of the Day and Night Bank</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Shanghai Great World Amusement Savings Department's Day and Night Bank suspending operations and being liquidated, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce received a petition from the bank's creditors in the name of the Creditors' Temporary Committee, requesting that their interests be maintained. The ministry has again ordered the Shanghai Social Bureau to expedite the liquidation and hold those with unlimited liability accountable. The official order is recorded below: Industrial and Commercial Ministry Order No. 890, to be followed: Received a telegram from the Shanghai Great World Amusement Savings Department Day and Night Bank creditors in the name of the Creditors' Temporary Committee stating that, "After the death of Shanghai merchant Huang Chu Jiu, his relatives and friends organized a post-mortem committee to maintain his remaining businesses, such as real estate, tobacco, pharmacies, native products, cinemas, etc., as usual. However, they declared the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department to be under liquidation. So far, there has been no concrete action, causing the rights of thousands of depositors to waver, feeling deeply distressed and miserable beyond words. We have investigated that in the banking industry, operating savings businesses, it is customary for the board of directors and important officers to bear unlimited liability. Moreover, this department was originally a company with unlimited liability. Even if all of Huang's businesses were declared bankrupt, the bank and the department should still repay all depositors' principal and interest in full. Furthermore, since all other businesses are being maintained, the rights of the bank and the department's creditors should be repaid earlier. We implore your ministry to consider that these thousands of depositors are all poor commoners, with only a few thousand or hundreds of yuan each, and as little as dozens or a few yuan, mostly the small amount of sweat and toil accumulated over time by hard work and thrift. Once they suffer losses, their lives and livelihoods are in danger. The weeping and wailing of the elderly and the cries of shop assistants and laborers in front of the bank, the department, and Huang's residence every day are evidence that the rights of these two parts have a great impact on the economy of Shanghai's common people. We beg your ministry to promptly order the Shanghai Municipal Government's Social Bureau to uphold justice and order the post-mortem committee to clear the principal and interest of the bank and the department's creditors in the shortest possible time to protect the rights of creditors and appease the public." We have investigated that this case was previously ordered by the ministry to be handled carefully, as it concerned social finance, and not to be handled according to the method of a limited liability company. Now, according to the previous situation, we hereby order the bureau to expedite the liquidation, holding those with unlimited liability accountable to avoid losses for depositors and maintain social finance. This order.</p>
<h3>Two-Year-Old Boy Missing from Qiao Jia Road</h3>
<p>Kidnappers frequently lurk on the streets of South City, specializing in luring and abducting young boys and girls. It is said that these kidnappers have organized an organization, where they change the children's names, teach them how to address them, and once the training is complete, sell them to other places for profit. Therefore, in recent days, there have been numerous cases of children being abducted and lost, and their families are seen wandering around the city, carrying foot warmer lids and calling out their names in the streets. It is now reported that a two-year-old boy from the family surnamed Mou, residing at a certain address on Qiao Jia Road, Xiaonanmen, was taken by his nanny for a stroll outside the door yesterday morning around 9:00 AM. The nanny then went upstairs to get something, and when she came downstairs, the child had suddenly disappeared. They immediately searched everywhere but could not find him. It is suspected that he was also abducted. After the child's parents learned of this, they cried all day and reported the matter to the police for investigation. It is not known whether the child can be recovered.</p>

<h3>News of the Engineering Society Seeking Talents</h3>
<p>The Chinese Engineering Society is the only organization composed of engineers in our country. Since its establishment, it has gained a reputation for its service to construction and academic research. In particular, the Employment Introduction Committee organized by the society is the most important work. Therefore, many people from various places entrust the society to hire talents. In the past, it was only for the adjustment of employment for the society's members, and it never sought applications from the outside world, so few people knew about it. Recently, the society's members have all had fairly stable positions, but there are still many requests from various places to hire talents on their behalf, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. It is now learned that there are still no applicants for the request letters received by the society, including the following three places: (1) A long-distance bus company in Shanghai needs an engineer to manage the entire road, who must be young, energetic, and not afraid of hard work. The salary is negotiable. (2) A university in Hunan needs a professor of mathematics and physics, who must be a graduate of a European or American university, have teaching experience, and be able to use English textbooks. The monthly salary is 260 yuan. (3) A certain place needs a chemical engineering expert, who must analyze minerals monthly and focus on the research of rare minerals, and must be a graduate of a foreign engineering school to be qualified. The salary is very generous. If any of the readers are interested, please contact the society directly at No. 47 Ningbo Road, Shanghai. Those seeking engineering talents can also send a letter to the society for registration, so that they can be contacted when there is a suitable opportunity in the future. If engineering institutions in various places need to hire engineering talents, they can also inform the society, and the society will surely give a satisfactory reply.</p>
