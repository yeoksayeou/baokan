<p>我們的貢獻</p>
<h3>總動員令（潘仰葊）</h3>
<p>最近日本迭次的無理行爲，激起國人一致的憤慨，國内反日空氣緊張達於極點。在此反日高潮時代，一方抵制日貨，一方就應該提倡國貨。尤其要仗着全國的同胞，下一個總動員令。人人一致的努力於國貨事業。工業界要努力製造國貨，商業界要决心販賣國貨，消費者要立志都用國貨。即農業界也要研究改良，努力於生産的增加。</p>
<p>用國貨，先要認識國貨。凡衣食住行上所需的品物，那種已有國貨，那種還在試驗，那種正侍提倡，那種還没有國貨，大多數的國民，要普遍的個個認識清楚。甚至一家一家的牌號，一種一種的商標，也要本着勇氣，仗着耐心，澈底的調查一下，即就盥先用品而講，牙粉出品有多種，牙膏出品有多種，乃至手巾，面盆，肥皂，牙刷的出品處所種類品質價格，都該旁徵博採，認識得十分清楚，鄭重的紹介於國人，纔是眞正的提倡國貨，尤其是一般熱心反日的同志，希望也要用愼密的工夫，愼重的手腕，眞摯的態度，光明的舉動，心平氣和循規蹈距的把國貨認識得十分清楚，一方堅决的主張到底，一方準備着自給自决。對於，甫在萌芽的國貨事業，要多方維護，多方體諒，多方設計，然後這個總動員令，才有價值。應付起來，才可以百戰百勝。如果步驟一亂，大家鬆懈起來。日本人又要在報紙上標着「排日運動不振」和「排日停頓」的說話來譏笑我們一，輕視我們。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>勗新任駐日蔣公使</h3>
<p>前任駐德公使蔣作賓氏。最近膺受新命。調任駐日公使。日政府方面亦已表示接受。不久蔣氏即將赴日履新。於此對日外交緊急之秋。國人對於駐日外交官吏之期望倍切。記者謹以誠意略貢數點。爲蔣公使勗</p>
<p>（一）我國對外交涉。以對日爲最棘手。亦以對日之糾紛爲最多。故駐日公使之責任尤爲艱鉅。目前日人一般軍閥政客及財閥。時高唱其對華積極侵略之謬論。本月四日日本南陸相。在臨時軍司令官師團長會議席上。對我東北。亦曾發狂論曰。「滿蒙在國防上。與政治經濟上。實屬與我國存亡有關之地。乃近時滿蒙情勢。殊有重大化之象。誠屬一大憾事。而其馴致此種情勢原因。則在中國之排外的國權恢復思想與新興經濟之向滿蒙發展。故吾儕軍人。於此際應預作能盡其職責之準備也。」來日大難。所待於駐日外交官吏折樽衝俎者至多。希望爲兩國國交上闢一康莊大道。謀得正當解决之途徑。故駐日公使於認清其普通外交官責任外尤應認清其特别責任之艱鉅。</p>
<p>（二）目前在帝國主義曲線外交之環境中。對外交涉。大槪不外乎進取與防守。日人對我外交。着着進逼。處處立於進取地位。我對日外交。進取不能。至少應做到一「防」字。彼之陰謀。彼之舉動。彼國與他國之關係。凡彼之一切行動。都應留心考察分析。詳報本國俾預爲之防。母使交涉驟至。無所措手足。</p>
<p>（三）日本駐在我國之外交官吏。率都爲「中國通。」其於我民情物俗。無不盡知。更無不盡力求知。茲後我駐日之外交官吏。對於知日。亦絶不容忽視。蓋知己知彼。然後可以操勝算。我昧於知彼。何能與彼交涉。駐外公使。應爲國家之耳目。耳目不靈。則交涉方針。自難確定。歷年來我國對日交涉之失敗。此亦應爲其一因。蔣公使前駐德時。對知德頗爲注意。返途經蘇聨。於彼國情。亦留心考察。此次駐日。吾人望其能力求知日。窺彼眞實之國情。時作系統之報告。　　最後。值此鮮案與萬案交涉緊急。前任公使汪榮寳氏又已回國。新舊交替。負責無人。吾人深願蔣氏即日就道履新。努力擔負其新的艱難的鉅責。</p>
<p>勉哉蔣氏。國人實不勝其熱烈期望之殷。</p>

<h3>南滿鐵路槪論彬·</h3>
<p>南滿鐵道之敷設與轉移丨滿鐵會社與南滿鐵道網丨滿鐵操持下之鐵道丨滿鐵會社經營之事業丨滿鐵對於我國之迫害丨目前之鐵道協商與如何收回南滿鐵道</p>
<p>日本對我國之侵略。自華盛頓會議而後。愈益集中於我東北三省。而其侵我之强而有力之工具。則爲南滿鐵路。南滿鐵路立於朝鮮鐵路之前。爲日本以渾身力量攻入亞細亞大陸的「日本之楔」。在政治上或經濟上。都爲日本向大陸發展的基本。田中義一有謂。「我把此交通大動脈之權。可以不客氣的侵略滿蒙實行明治大帝第三期滅亡滿蒙之計劃。」其對於我國家之迫害。吾人自可想見。近年來我東北當局爲打破艱難險惡之前途。對於東北鐵道網系之計劃與修築。都極努力。然而我之所孜孜努力者。正日人所慄慄危懼。一般神經過敏之日方。軍閥政客。遂高唱其荒悖之謬論。而日政府亦調任内田康哉爲滿鐵總裁。派木村爲所謂鐵道交涉之代表。一種手忙脚亂之惶急狀態。雖適證其爲庸人自擾。而其對我東北之加緊侵略。則顯然可見。南滿鐵道一日不收回。我國家一日不得安枕。來日大難。端有賴於國人之自起努力。著者特撮取南滿鐵道重要之各方面。槪論於此。俾國人覘知南滿鐵道重大性之一斑。此外著者現正着手編寫南滿鐵道論一書。於其各方面叙述論列較爲詳盡。不久當可公諸國人。藉供參考。著者附識</p>
<h3>（一）南滿鐵道之敷設與轉移</h3>
<p>當吾人每一論及南滿鐵道時。第一個急待明曉之問題。即爲南滿鐵道之歷史。丨如何敷設。如何落入日本之手。明乎此。然後始能論列其他。然後始能論列今後如何收回。</p>
<p>南滿鐵道原爲帝國主義者在我國敷設之第一條鐵道。丨東省鐵道这南支綫。起自東省鐵道幹綫之一站。而迄於大連旅順。東省鐵道幹綫敷設之條約。爲清廷李鴻章與俄相羅拔諾夫於一八九六年五月在俄京所訂立。南滿支綫敷設之條約。爲一八九八年五月二十七日俄人要求租借旅順大連之租借條約訂立後之七月六日所續訂。迨此兩大鐵道系築成。綿長一千六百餘英里。如丁字之利斧。直伸入我東北三省。而東北大陸之命脈。遂日在其斫削與鉗制之下。今日我東北之艱難險局。亦由此而滋生。</p>
<p>日本於俄人跋扈飛揚趾高氣滿之際。亦無時不思伺隙。一逞其北進大陸政策之野心。以扼於强俄。不得不隠忍待時。而對於俄國在我東三省及朝鮮之一舉一動。固無不細心觀察。眼紅耳熱。早已不能忍耐。終於一九○四年爆發爭我東北利權之日俄戰爭。</p>
<p>戰爭結果。日勝俄敗。以美大總統羅斯福之斡旋。日俄兩國於一九○五年九月五日訂立撲茨茅斯媾和條約。條約中第五六兩條有云。</p>
<p>（五）俄國以中國政府之承認。將旅順大連及附近領地領水之租借權。與關聨租借權及組成一部之一切權利特權及讓與。……均讓與日本。……</p>
<p>（六）俄國以中國政府之承認。將長春（寬城子）旅順間之鐵道及其支綫。並同地方附屬一切權利物權及財産與其所有一切經營之煤礦。無條件讓與日本。</p>
<p>一九○五年十二月。日復根據撲茨茅斯條約。强迫清庭訂立中日滿洲善後協約。完全承認日俄和約之有効。并允許其將安東奉天間之戰時軍用鐵道正式敷設。及准南滿鐵道與我國各鐵道接績聨絡。此外又有所謂一九○五年十二月二十日之中日條約附屬秘密議定書要領。於我國權斷送者更多。此秘密議定之有無。實爲絶大疑問。甚或爲日人所僞造。但日人至今則齗齗爭持。據爲口實。</p>
<p>自日俄和約及中日條約相繼訂立後。南滿鐵路及旅順大連。日人乃唾手攫得。加以安奉鐵道之租成權成立。日本以鐵道政策直搗我東三省腹心。及發展其大陸政策之自由。乃得一確實保證。日俄戰戰。我國乃爲其勝利品。大好山河。任人割奪。强徒分贓。主人在側俯首承認。終至於今日之無限風雲。都由此而生。大勢使然歟。我國自取歟。廻溯至此。吾人未嘗不爲之嘆息痛恨於清室之頇　也。丨此爲南滿鐵道之敷設。與轉移。</p>
<h3>（二）滿鐵會社與南滿鐵道網</h3>
<p>日本自攫得南滿鐵路及其港口旅順大連而後、遂於一九○六年六月。由明治帝以勒令頒佈設立南滿鐵道會社接辦。該會社之組織。實爲聳動日本朝野之大政。組織之始。共有籌備員八十人。皆當時日本各界第一流領袖。而以玉兒大將委員長。該會社之特質爲超越經濟的性質。而爲政治化。此於（一）日本政府對於該會社有絶對管轄權。及（二）滿鐵會社有指定滿洲各領事官之權兩點。可以證實。而其組織之宏偉。施設之廣遠。旁涉農工。助振商業。操縱敎育。更處處超越於經濟的範圍之外、該會社目前共職員八·二二三人。合計其他囑託員僱員等共有三四·六一二人。資本總額現共四四○·○○○·○○○元（參照滿蒙年鑑昭和六年版）其規模之宏大。誠不亞於英國侵略印度之東印度公司。該會社自命爲「具備國家諸機能之執行機關」。而自我國視之。日本對我東北政策之形成與發展。該社亦實具有絶大之原動力。吾人謂爲日人侵略我東北之大本營。殆不爲過。</p>
<p>滿鐵會社創辦之初。即注全力於本路之改良及幹綫支綫之擴張。一九○八年五月。南滿路標准軌始告竣。一九一一年十月安奉綫改築標準軌始全部竣工。而旅順支綫與營口支綫亦於此時期改築完成·迨各綫改築旣竣。以南滿綫爲幹路。以大連爲出口港。以其他各路爲營養綫。其營業遂蒸蒸日上。我國鐵道以無出口海港。固難望其項背。即挾有海參威港口之東省鐵道。亦感望塵莫及。其營業發展之狀况。可於下表覘知。</p>

<p>（附註）此表以日圓爲單位</p>
<p>迄至近兩年。一以世界經濟之不振。銀價之暴跌。一以滿鐵運費之過高。營業乃漸不振。截至本年二月。减收總額乃突破二千七百十五萬八千零六十一元日金。日人於此乃大起恐慌。歸咎於我國打通鐵路之建設。及四路聨運運價减低。而開始進行所謂鐵道交涉。朝野呶呶。不可終朝。侵我士地。奪我利權。反干涉我國之交通行政。口言共存共榮。實則扼我咽喉。務置我於死。其强横無理。蓋無以復加。</p>
<p>自該會社基礎確立以後。日人乃以南滿路爲主幹。計劃建築南滿鐵道網。以網羅我東北全部。使無可逃脫。其完成鐵道網系之陰毒手段。大抵不外。</p>
<p>（一）極力發展日本現有之鐵道。并要求新路權建築新鐵道。</p>
<p>（二）極力破壞我國自辦鐵道。破壞不得。則要求投資。力求把持。務使我國徒有其名而日操其實。</p>
<p>（三）與中東路作經濟的競爭。高唱東北門戶開放。陷我國外交於孤立。以便利其鐵道計劃之進行。</p>
<p>所謂以南滿路爲主幹。即南滿鐵道中心主義。而此中心主義之基礎。則又建築於大連港至上主義之上。蓋鐵道不得海港爲尾閭。則其本身之價值最爲有限。終不免成有港鐵道之培養線。故日人利用南滿路之優越地位。極力發展其機能。一面擴充大連港之吞吐量·而增進其設備。一面計劃建築互相銜接之循環鐵路。至於現在。日人之着目點乃又集中於吉會路之完成。與朝鮮北岸海港之開拓。如其成功。則日本衆路並興。多港爭輝。向我東北之東南兩面。夾輔並進。其計劃實現。而其勢力乃如天羅地網。八面罩來。我東北數省究能逃往何處。故國人對於日方要求吉會路之建築。須誓死拒絶。而於葫蘆島築港之完成。尤當竭力以趨。否則茫茫前途。不堪設想矣。</p>
<p>目前南滿路鐵道會社所經營之鐵道。爲</p>
<p>（一）南滿鐵道幹線起長春至大連共四三八·五哩</p>
<p>（二）安奉線起蘇家屯至安東共一六一·七哩</p>
<p>（三）旅順線起旅順至臭水子共三一·六哩</p>
<p>（四）營口線起大石橋至營口共一三·九哩</p>
<p>（五）烟台線起烟台至烟台煤礦共九·七哩</p>
<p>（六）撫順線起洋河至撫順共三五·四哩共長六九○·八哩。就中南滿路與安奉路兩路之租借期。日人於二十一條中。都欲展期至九十九年。旅順大連租期。亦展至九十九年。甚且企圖長此盤據。但二十一條。我國絶未承認。日人自不能籍爲口實也。（未完）</p>

<p>瑞領庇護</p>
<h3>被捕共黨首領之反響</h3>
<p>本市各級黨部、爲駐滬瑞領庇共一節、異常憤慨、茲將四區黨部及九區三分部九區五分部二區六分部等、對此案之主張如下、</p>
<p>四區黨部　共産黨東方部首領牛蘭夫婦兩人、已於六月十六日、在滬公共租界被捕、當塲抄出重要反動證據數百件、其中以指揮紅軍作戰計劃等事件爲最多、該牛蘭被捕時、供稱爲比利士國籍、其妻稱法國籍、經查明該兩犯並無國籍、淞滬警備司令部、乃函請引提、該犯知難逃罪、乃以金錢賄買駐滬瑞土領事、於本月八日到案、承認該犯瑞士國籍、當經特區法院第二分院宋庭長着瑞領代表、提出國籍證據、而一無所得、據此顯然可知瑞士領事受金錢運動、包庇共匪首領、置國交於不顧、殊屬痛惡、昨日本市四區黨部曾去函警告、謂如再敢爲該犯辩護、當即驅逐出境云、</p>
<p>九區五分部　該分部爲瑞士領事包庇共匪首領牛蘭等、呈請上級、准予召集全滬市民大會、討論對瑞斷絶交邦、文云、查共黨第三國際首領牛蘭夫婦兩人、駐華專事指揮中共在湘鄂閩贛等省、從事殺人放火工作、該犯已於七月十六日、在公共租界捕獲、並抄出大批共黨重要文件計六百餘、惟該犯國籍、經捕房法院再三查詢、始知該犯係無國籍外人、由淞滬警備司令部向特二分院引渡、該犯不惜鉅欵賄買瑞士國領事、於本月八日開庭時、派來代表、承認該犯係瑞士籍、因證據毫無、經宋庭長駁斥、准警備司令部引提、不料魔醉金錢、甘心危害我中國四萬萬同胞之瑞士領事、對慘殺我湘鄂閩贛諸省徒手災民之兇犯、不加撲滅、反敢包庇、爲特呈請上級准予召集全滬市民大會討論對瑞斷絶交邦云、</p>
<p>九區三分部　該分部爲警告駐滬瑞士領事包庇共黨發出宣言文云、查東方部共黨首領牛蘭夫婦二人、在公共租界捕獲、抄出重要證據計數百件、其中以指揮蘇浙皖贛閩湘鄂等紅軍作戰計劃、及使用毒瓦斯方法爲最多、該犯被捕後、供稱比利士人、其妻稱法人、經當局向比法兩國查詢、並無其人、該犯係危害中國之紅軍首領、且在贛省匪共中、曾任重要工作、淞滬警備司令部去函引提、該犯自知罪無可掩、乃異想天開、不惜金錢、賄買瑞領、出而袒護、於本月八日、派代表到院要求引渡、歸瑞領辦理、當經宋庭長查明該犯並未向瑞士國登記、又無護照、拒絶提引、依照前情、顯見瑞士領事包庇共黨、已無疑義、但我國正在大舉剿赤之際、瑞士領事、竟敢冒天下大不韙、甘爲全國民衆之公敵、如不改悔、再擬干與、當奮起相抗、謹此宣言、</p>
<p>二區六分部　查共黨之禍甚於水火、世界各羃均視爲公敵、此次共黨東方部首領牛蘭夫婦被捕、查無國籍、而瑞士領事竟認該犯爲瑞士國籍、要求引渡、當經特區二分院宋庭長着該領代表提出證據、因無證據拒絶引渡、查該犯並未向瑞士登記、又無護照、顯係無國籍者、應依照國際公法之規定、凡無國籍者、在何地犯罪、當由該地官廳辦理、該犯被捕後、該領不顧公法、竟敢出而包庇共黨、甘冒天下之大不韙、凡我同志當與力爭、本分部同志誓爲政府後盾、與該國斷絶邦交、謹此宣言、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>收買舊牢獄的奇癖</p>
<p>買地買屋。是現代的最可靠的生財之道。當然是人人歡喜的。然而最有趣的。莫過於英國路頓Luton地方的一位富翁湯麥士烏克來氏。Thomas　Oakley他有收買廢置的舊牢獄的奇癖。先前他早已買進了高斯堡Gosport大倍Derby華昔斯德Worcester三處的牢獄。最近又出了四千一百五十金鎊的代價將吉府Cheshire的納志福牢獄Knrtsfordjail買了下來。他打算廢物利用將它改成一個馬車夫的旅館。取價極其低廉。每人每天只須出三個先令就可以睡眠沐浴。并有早餐可吃了。所有的獄室。完全改成臥室。置備良好的床舖三百隻。每夜即可供三百人睡眠之用。獄中有水泥舖地的空塲三畝。可給車夫們安放空車。三四百輛也容納得下。這牢獄共有基地五畝。坐落在倫敦通往利物浦與孟吉士德的大路上。改作馬車夫的旅館。確是很相宜的。</p>
<p>烏氏除了喜買舊牢獄外。并曾買過輕巡洋艦一艘。飛機塲四處。水晶宫内的水溝一道。格來那軍火廠的一部分。酒廠六七所。棉廠數家。鄉村大厦十四宅。此君眞是一個奇人啊。</p>
<h3>許世英之慘報告</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>今歲入夏以來。霪雨連綿。山洪暴發。災區之大。亘古未有。本報六十二號圖畫週刋。已將各處水災相片。拾尤登載。并逐日分撰水災叢評。以資宣傳。本埠各界領袖。近曾發起上海籌募各省水災急賑會。六日下午。在市商會討論募捐方法。許世英報告各省災狀時。搥胸頓足。大聲疾呼。謂被災區域。已有十六省。以人口言。在五千萬以上。鄙人皖籍。據梓鄉報告。謂沿淮河兩岸。如天長五河阜陽蒙城等十餘縣。或地勢低窪。易受水患。或山洪暴發。堤圩潰决。禾畜蕩没。老幼淹斃。霍邱一日間。淹斃八千餘人。阜陽一縣中。沉没五萬餘戶。安慶之廣濟圩。宣城之陶行圩。均爲産米最盛之區。今亦潰决。太和秋浦全椒等縣。悉成澤國。其他湘豫贛蘇鄂閩浙粤等省。無省不遭水災。即以最近首都而言。前日鄙人赴京時。經堯化門。見鐵路兩旁較高之地。災民結隊成羣。聚集於此。一種悲慘情狀。觀之令人淚下。近來注重民族主義。四萬萬均稱同胞。希望諸君對於被災之同胞。認爲本人之父兄子弟。諸姑姊妹。解囊援救。則造福無窮。聽者無不動容。</p>
<h3>日人宣傳之一斑</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>自萬寳山案發生後。日人多方宣傳人盡知之。最近本埠日本領事館。每日發往福州漢口北平等之無綫電報。日必十餘次。每次必包含百餘字。且均係羅馬字組成之密語。故難洞悉其意義。每次發報之掛號皆爲Riyoji。此乃日本領事館專有之掛號。據無線電台某君語余。每日因此收入不下百金。但日人居心險惡。深愿國人注意及之。</p>
<h3>朱涇殺子案瑣聞</h3>
<p>— 才良</p>
<p>客有自金山來者。曾爲予述該地最近發生之殺子案甚詳。茲擇各報所未披露者。特記之以爲讀者告。</p>
<p>荒淫無度　此案中之主主角王陶氏。本爲平湖某姓之下堂妾。邇雖徐娘老去。而風騷仍不减當年。初與該宅司賬王玉田有染。備極親暱。舉凡玉田所享用者。雖價貴亦所弗惜。雙宿雙飛。儼若夫婦。繼忽日久愛疏。時相齟龉。適渠家又來一圬工名夏阿慶者。作事勤奮。而外貌又遠勝於王。以是頗得王陶氏之信任。寖漸而形成三角戀愛。旋渠子迪卿以穢聲遠。播心殊憤恨。頗思去夏王以爲快。詎事機不密。忽爲渠母所聞知。乃遂召殺身之禍矣。語云。「姦近殺」觀於引事而益信。</p>
<p>失戀遠奔　迪卿被害。旣爲渠母所主使。餘若夏阿慶及小媽媽等。固皆是案中之帮凶犯。至玉田雖不在塲。然亦難逃帮凶之嫌疑。故玉田於事發之翌日。即束裝遠避、迄今消息杳然。即家人亦莫知其居處。現官廳爲明白眞相計。已嚴加緝拿。想偵騎四出。當有水落石出之一日。</p>
<p>牢籠懺語　王陶氏旣身入囹圄。備嘗痛苦。每遇人詢及往事。輒聲淚俱下。某日。適值渠家一女傭來監探視。渠忽作哀懇狀。泣曰。吾殺子實非所願。蓋亦爲環境所迫耳。罪過誠知罪過。但是終要請求少奶奶（渠之媳婦）原諒的。女僕聞言。唯唯而嫁。於以知孟子性善之說。實非無據。奈天良發現。已悔之無及矣。</p>
<p>演劇趣聞　此案旣出。一般好事者。固莫不引爲談資。而素善投機之各地劇塲。亦莫不視爲編劇之好材料。日前金邑民衆敎育館適排演此劇。本地風光。倍覺有趣。當演至王陶氏等用帶勒斃王迪卿時。忽有一少婦突出怪聲。並戟指大駡劇中人不置。時觀衆皆莫名其妙。闔座譁然。迨經查詢。始知該婦即迪卿之未亡人。觸景興悲。不覺蛾眉倒豎。戲劇感人之深。於此可見。旋當局以此劇恐釀事端。遂令輟演云。</p>
<h3>專供兒童閱讀的報紙</h3>
<p>— 聖涵</p>
<p>在中國。專門給兒童閱讀的書籍雜誌出版已不少。可是專門給兒童閱讀的報紙。簡直還没有。</p>
<p>時事敎育的重要。已爲現在一般敎育家所公認。但是普通的日報。多是文言。内容又很艱深。實在不適合於指導兒童研究時事之用。而專供兒童閱讀的報紙又没有。所以一般敎育家。多引爲憾事。</p>
<p>在去年六月一日。各地敎育同人聨合創辦了一張「兒童時報」。他們的宗旨。是「培養兒童看報習慣。充實兒童生活常識。增進兒童閱讀能力。鼓勵兒童創作興趣。　促進兒童敎育。」該報是三日刋。現在已出到一百四十四期。小小的一張報。竟銷行到二十多省。連日本·安南·南洋·各地。也有許多學校定閱。確是中國唯一的兒童報紙。很受許多兒童敎育家和兒童文學家的贊譽。像陳鶴琴先生說。「兒童時報。可說中國最近出版界裏一種别開生面的作品。值得當今敎育者注意的。現在國内各處出版的兒童讀物。雖屬不少。然而專門給兒童讀的報紙。還不大看到。」趙景深先生說。「兒童時報」編得極好。短小精悍·使兒童在最短時間内。獲得國際新聞知識。確實是現代第一種兒童的報紙。」豐子愷先生說「兒童時報。舍下諸兒。均極愛讀。每得新刋。羣聚爭觀。如獲拱璧。」</p>
<p>該報編輯的體裁。排印格式。都非常新頴。内容分「時事」「常識」「文藝」三部。時事的叙述。注重故事化和系統化。常識特闢「小問答」一欄。兒童如有疑難問題。可以函請解答。文藝特闢「小朋友的園地」一欄。專刋兒童作品。文字全用語體。適合小學中高年級學生的程度。無論文字圖畫。取材以富有趣味爲原則。極合兒童心理。</p>
<p>他們是爲敎育謀便利。爲兒童謀幸福。並非營業性質。所以報費。定得很低。這確是兒童的恩物。</p>
<p>啟事　投稿諸君鑒。茲後如承惠稿。封面務請寫明「自由談編輯部」。　以免與個人函件相混。再來稿不蓋章者。槪作却酬論。請注意。自由談編輯部啟。</p>
<p>出版界消息　曹痴公主編之中報三日刋内容頗多精采故出版以來。深受讀者歡迎。近更增闢副刋二種。一爲衛生顧問。延請海上名醫多人。担任撰述。特載醫藥問答一欄。解答一切疑難問題。一爲春野。係一種新文藝副刋。由白蓮文藝社社友担任撰述。已自三十二期起刋載。茲爲優待同文起見。凡附郵一分。寄至上海新閘路B二一三六號。即贈閱一期云。</p>
<h3>西湖消夏之追憶（三）</h3>
<p>— 袁容舫</p>
<p>山中諸洞。自以烟霞風景爲最幽。名亦最著。路亦最遠。石屋紫雲次之。棲霞更次之。惟陰凉宜暑。則烟霞之幽古。石屋之虚朗。紫雲之石色。棲霞之風聲。均令人念念不能忘。余夏日遇極熱。輒清晨携南華經。或古詩數冊。並乾餱少許。往作竟日游。展卷石几。冷趣彌永。不知洞外熱度高至幾何也。</p>
<p>西冷印社爲湖中最幽麗處。結構精雅。佈置簡樸。坡陀高下。奇境層闢。竹徑茅堦。古趣盎然。山頂較熱。宜薄暮時往。余每俟夕陽西下。登四照閣納凉。披襟當風。全湖在望。雲樹蒼茫。塔影共巒光俱没。水烟浩渺。鐘聲與人語同清。此景此樂。今不可復得矣。</p>
<p>人謂春湖不如秋湖。秋湖不如冬湖。余謂晴湖不如雨湖。雨湖不如月湖。惟游月湖於冬則不能。於春秋亦不宜。獨夏爲最佳。蓋夏湖暑氣鬱蒸。游必以夜。夜必有月方趣。故每歲五六七月。上弦後。杭人爭作夜游。一時華舫齊發。錦絃雜奏。有南宋當年景象。余亦時約素心二三。放耀中流。皓月珠懸。繁星棋佈。湖闊天空。颶清露冷。陡覺倦消暑失。而波瑩蟾魄。月碎魚鱗。似坐冰壺裏。似游玉鏡。中此身恍入廣寒仙府矣。或倚舟　笛。學大蘇赤壁之游。或披襟把盞。尋太白丹陽之樂。探月影於三潭。訪小靑於山麓。蘇堤閒步。垂柳倒映。湖亭小泊。雕臺入浸。遙望四圍靑山。如霧裏花。而三五螢火。明滅水面。作流星飛。每俟南屏鐘動。方商量作歸計。則已月落參横。霧濕葛衫。凉沁肌膚。輒恨無可久米囊一披也。舊游若夢。往事如烟。勝地不常。名山已别。深慨乎行樂之須及時也。（終）</p>

<h3>女人女人（一五）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>這時，他覺得已經無法可以再避免去這一個難關，只得還故意裝出一本正經的樣子，用命令式的口氣說；「小榮不是在那一邊嗎？你不用喚他了，把馬車趕快去拉來」，</p>
<p>小夥計摸不着頭腦，只是瞧見小榮同看一個很漂亮的女人在一起，也不敢再多說，自己只顧去了，祗用手指着一邊說：「車子就停在那邊」！</p>
<p>當時，丁小姐固然不知道這是什麽一回事，所以一些也不注意。於是陸先生想用金蟬脫壳之計了，就急急地走向另一邊去，不料却給丁小姐喊住。</p>
<p>「方才那個車夫不是說車子停在那一邊麽」？伊就拉看陸先生望那一邊走，陸先生没有法子，也不能再支吾了，只得跟着伊走。</p>
<p>他把帽簷拉了下來，掩住了一半的面部，在萬分的驚惶之中，只得坐上了他父親的車子，幸而他瞧見當他坐上去的時候，他的父親正在車上打瞌睡。</p>
<p>「快些！到鐵路飯店」！他吩咐着。</p>
<p>小夥計把小榮的父親喚醒了，一面拉了馬車就走，一面却暗暗地拉拉他的衣服，把嘴向後面撇了，意思是呌他回轉頭去看看車子裏坐着的是誰。可是他方才從夢裏醒回來，也並不曾懂得小夥計的意思：偏偏小夥計還輕輕地向他說：「老闆！你瞧瞧後面坐着的是誰」？</p>
<p>「管它做甚？上海來的一男一女也看見得多了」！他雖然也回過頭去瞧了一瞧，只是他祗瞧見了坐在右邊的丁小姐，小榮恰巧坐在他後面，所以他並没有全部的看清。他只以爲這是平常所見慣的一對男女罷了。</p>
<p>小夥計還要多事，他還是輕輕地說：那是小榮呢！</p>
<p>「别胡說罷！我没有福氣生這樣的兒子」！他居然還是不相信，以爲小夥計只是跟他取笑。</p>
<p>鐵路飯店到了，小榮很快的付了車錢，和丁小姐立刻就下了車。那個小夥計正想再呌小榮的父親看看究竟是不是小榮的時候，忽然聽得馬路的那一邊有人喊着：「快些！把馬車拉過來」！</p>
<p>他一聽是生意來了，自然不敢遲延，所以也來不及再呌小榮的父親看看小榮了，立刻就把車子拉了過去，</p>
<p>在路上，小夥計才和小榮的父親細細地說：「方才的那兩個坐車的人，實實在在是小榮和另外一個不相識的女人。」但是，小榮的父親還是將信將疑地以爲他也許是看錯了人。</p>

<h3>紗花上週棉市始漲繼回</h3>
<p>棉市在週初頗有上漲之力、因天氣不正、外棉平定、四方水災劇烈、漢埠水汎愈烈、預料棉産大受打擊、故内地帮及多頭紛紛購進加碼、未幾天時尙佳、美棉形勢又見虚弱、跌風驟起、而美棉現貨跌破八分關口、印棉又有貶價脫售之消息、各廠視大勢未定、皆不敢購辦、因之人心恐慌、一日間曾跌八九錢、十月分最低曾見三十五兩六錢、週末因政府估計發表、買方預料有趨漲之力、散戶購進、市氣猶稍稍回漲、十月份到三十六兩二錢五然測之世界棉市、十分悲觀、前途難以大漲、所以大戶一致抛空、買方以金價有看漲面、拉緊不放、反有購進加碼者、但八日發表之政府報告、本埠九日尙未接到電訉、美棉獨微漲十磅音、惟芝加哥電訉、據官塲估計、棉産有一千五百五十八萬四千包之巨、紐約交易所午後停市、惟芝加哥交易所午後照常有交易、十二月份暴跌一百三十七磅音、爲六分八厘六、七分陣綫已冲破、足見美棉情形之萬分險惡也、本棉前途、亦有極不穏之現象矣現棉交易十分冷澹、來源計姚花六千四百廿包、茲將做開現棉包額錄左、</p>

<h3>上週期現紗跌落二兩餘</h3>
<p>實銷銳減</p>
<p>紗市在上週間、漸向軟途推進、形勢日現衰弱之狀、蓋以海外花紗狀况、一味傾向下游、兼之四方水災頻傳、實需大受打擊、各帮均無興奮氣象、交易完全停頓、人心十分不振、而抛賣者反覺踴躍、大戶安然不動、全無抵補之念、實以根本上鬆勁、原棉趨跌、成本較廉　買方視大勢不良、皆束手不動、總之世界棉市異常悲觀、毫無振作之象、而各路水災、日趨嚴重、年成荒歉、將後秋銷、農民購買力必弱、故大戶一致抛空看小、惟多頭方面、以金價有上漲之望態度尙靜、仍無放手、然現紗交易太清、前途究屬如何、須依實需爲進退也、標紗市氣十分衰弱、賣戶較衆、各月比前週跌二兩外、成交統計二十萬零九千三百包、客帮中現貨生意岑寂、全週各帮買去統計三千八百四十五包、同行中進一千二百八十包、行情跌二兩外、茲將各帮口買去之包額、分誌於後、</p>

<h3>糧食　限盤後之南北米市</h3>
<p>常錫北粳已斷檔</p>
<p>新粳價提半元</p>
<p>南市　裏路來源寥寥、計靑浦一號、同里二號、平湖二號、浦東新粳一號、城鄉交易不見暢旺、因米行公會評價公開、客方亦受影響、常錫北粳無貨應市、早晚稻及洋蘆尖明定暗緊、蘇同帮上落有限、新粳昨抵一筒、計貨一百餘石、和盛·愼利二家買進、行情比前市提起半元、變陰二元、茶食店需要尙殷、又昂三四角、</p>
<p>新閘　米市近來限盤以來、内地來貨略少、船貨存積一萬七千擔左右、市上交易、中關厚粳居多、形勢步增、况頂貨物别二種、因米行公會限價十七元、客入以血本關係、不願出售、早晚　新鮮乏貨、普通略有、故趨勢硬起二角、蘆埠尖高定次緊、洋尖及東新粳隨到隨銷、大盤各漲半元、</p>

<p>上週中本埠洋莊絲市、益形寂寞無神、查歐美各綢廠暑假後、大部份尙未開工、生絲廠銷、依然停滯、加以日絲開價仍廉、幾與滬白廠經價相差二三百兩、日商競銷不懈、華絲無人過問、滬埠去電均不見轉、華洋絲商態度均抱消極、各絲廠存絲日厚、類均减工停機、歐美絲銷之疲滯、達於極點、上週絲市、幾趨停滯、内地綢門銷路亦清、全週祗共成交一百餘包、輸出三百餘包、海外華絲均屬有行無市、滙市下縮、絲價明平暗跌、實無市面之足紀、茲壯曰　週末歐美市塲華絲市價、列表於下、（紐約每磅價單位金元里昂每基羅價單位法郎）</p>

<h3>糖市　劃市交靜市堅</h3>

<h3>五金　新鉛絲扶搖直上</h3>
<p>市塲槪况　昨逢星期日、五金交易因各帮及廠家均休息、故無甚買賣、全市人氣亦十分閑淡、緣是各市進出、亦甚爲寥少耳、</p>
<p>新鉛絲貨少需旺　自東洋鉛絲不能來申後、本埠新鉛絲市面遂有扶搖直上之勢、標準紛紛提漲、計十六號至二十號每擔估十三兩二錢半、二十一號至二十五號售十八兩七錢半、惟市貨奇缺、人氣益堅、而購者愈旺、是以來日標準、勢看再漲也、</p>
<p>竹節鋼反弱爲强　竹節鋼條、近來購者甚旺、而到貨歉薄、市有反弱爲强之勢、計每噸售九十五兩、查開出有六七十噸云、</p>

<h3>General Mobilization Order (Pan Yang'an)</h3>
<p>Recently, Japan's repeated unreasonable actions have aroused unanimous indignation among the Chinese people, and the anti-Japanese atmosphere in the country has reached its peak. In this era of anti-Japanese upsurge, on the one hand, we should boycott Japanese goods, and on the other hand, we should promote domestic products. In particular, we must rely on compatriots across the country to issue a general mobilization order. Everyone should work together for the cause of domestic goods. The industrial sector should strive to manufacture domestic products, the commercial sector should be determined to sell domestic products, and consumers should be determined to use domestic products. Even the agricultural sector should study and improve, and strive to increase production.</p>
<p>To use domestic goods, we must first understand them. For the items needed for food, clothing, housing, and transportation, which ones already have domestic products, which ones are still being tested, which ones are being promoted, and which ones do not yet have domestic products? The majority of the people must have a clear understanding of each of these. Even the brands of each family, and the trademarks of each type, must be thoroughly investigated with courage and patience. Even speaking of daily necessities, there are many kinds of toothpaste products, many kinds of toothpaste products, and even the place of origin, types, quality, and price of towels, washbasins, soaps, and toothbrushes, all should be extensively investigated and understood very clearly, and solemnly introduced to the people of the country. That is the true promotion of domestic goods. In particular, those enthusiastic anti-Japanese comrades, it is hoped that they will also use careful effort, cautious methods, sincere attitude, and bright actions to understand domestic products very clearly in a calm and law-abiding manner, resolutely advocating them to the end on the one hand, and preparing for self-sufficiency and self-determination on the other hand. For the cause of domestic goods that is just budding, we must protect it in many ways, understand it in many ways, and design it in many ways. Then, this general mobilization order will have value. When dealing with it, we can be victorious in every battle. If the steps are in disarray, and everyone becomes lax, the Japanese will again mock and despise us by labeling in newspapers, "The anti-Japanese movement is sluggish" and "The anti-Japanese movement has stalled."</p>

<h3>The Negotiation of Wan'an Case is Delayed</h3>

The provincial government believed that it was inconsistent with the original agreement and ordered Zhong to protest to the Japanese consul, declaring the termination of the protection responsibility and requesting the withdrawal of the police, otherwise it would be unloaded (8th Special Telegram).</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Encouraging the Newly Appointed Envoy to Japan, Mr. Jiang</h3>
<p>The former envoy to Germany, Mr. Jiang Zuobin, has recently received a new appointment to serve as envoy to Japan. The Japanese government has also expressed its acceptance. Mr. Jiang will soon go to Japan to take office. At this time of urgent diplomacy with Japan, the people of the country are placing greater expectations on diplomatic officials stationed in Japan. The reporter would like to sincerely offer a few points to encourage Mr. Jiang.</p>
<p>(1) Among our country's diplomatic negotiations, those with Japan are the most thorny, and the disputes with Japan are the most numerous. Therefore, the responsibility of the envoy to Japan is particularly arduous. At present, Japanese warlords, politicians, and financial groups are constantly advocating their erroneous theories of aggressive invasion of China. On the 4th of this month, Japanese Minister of the Army Minami, at the meeting of temporary army commanders and division commanders, also made a crazy statement about our Northeast, saying, "Manchuria and Mongolia are, in terms of national defense, politics, and economics, related to the survival of our country. However, the situation in Manchuria and Mongolia in recent times has taken on a significant turn, which is truly regrettable. The reason for this situation lies in China's anti-foreign national rights recovery ideology and the emerging economic development towards Manchuria and Mongolia. Therefore, we soldiers should prepare ourselves at this time to fulfill our responsibilities." A great disaster is coming, and much is expected of the diplomatic officials stationed in Japan to mediate and resolve the situation. It is hoped that a broad road can be opened up for the relations between the two countries, and a proper solution can be found. Therefore, the envoy to Japan should recognize not only his ordinary diplomatic responsibilities but also the arduousness of his special responsibilities.</p>
<p>(2) In the current environment of imperialist curvilinear diplomacy, diplomatic negotiations generally consist of advance and defense. The Japanese diplomacy towards us is pressing forward step by step, standing in a position of advance everywhere. Our diplomacy towards Japan cannot advance, but at least we should achieve a "defense." Their conspiracies, their actions, the relationship between their country and other countries—all their actions should be carefully examined and analyzed and reported in detail to our country so that preparations can be made for defense. Do not let negotiations come suddenly, leaving us at a loss.</p>
<p>(3) Japanese diplomatic officials stationed in our country are mostly "China experts." They know everything about our people's customs and habits. Furthermore, they spare no effort to learn more. From now on, our diplomatic officials stationed in Japan must not neglect learning about Japan. Knowing oneself and one's enemy is the only way to win. If we are ignorant of our enemy, how can we negotiate with them? The envoy stationed abroad should be the eyes and ears of the country. If the eyes and ears are not sharp, then the negotiating strategy will be difficult to determine. The failure of our country's negotiations with Japan over the years should be attributed to this as well. When Mr. Jiang was previously stationed in Germany, he paid considerable attention to learning about Germany. On his way back, he passed through the Soviet Union and also carefully examined the situation there. This time stationed in Japan, we hope that he will strive to learn about Japan and gain insight into its true national conditions, making systematic reports from time to time. Finally, with the Xian Incident and the Wan Incident negotiations urgent, and the former envoy, Mr. Wang Rongbao, having returned to the country, there is no one to take responsibility during the transition between the old and the new. We sincerely hope that Mr. Jiang will take office immediately and strive to shoulder his new and difficult major responsibilities.</p>
<p>Strive on, Mr. Jiang. The people of the country are eagerly anticipating you.</p>
<p>Receiving Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<p>The Nationalist News Agency, Berlin, 8th - Those who support and oppose the dissolution of the Prussian Parliament are engaging in campaigns tonight. Slogans on the walls are eye-catching, and leaflets are flying all over the streets like snowflakes. Before midnight, the situation is turbulent, and the police are on strict alert. Near the Communist Party headquarters in the evening, there were clashes between the police and party members. The people used bricks as weapons, and the police used pistols to resist. As a result, one communist was killed and several were injured. Later, several more people were arrested. The situation in Königsberg is even more serious, with 137 communists arrested. However, Berlin and other provinces are currently peaceful. The National Socialist Party has solemnly declared that the party will never use force to seize power. Currently, the two factions are fiercely opposed, and it is unknown who will prevail.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 8th - Bankers expect the National Bank to reduce the discount rate by five percent at the beginning of next week. After the resumption of unlimited banking business, the amount paid into the National Bank is approximately 125 million marks more than the amount withdrawn, and the reorganization of private banks is also satisfactory. The pressure for investment is gradually increasing, but the interest rate on secured and underwriting bank notes is 12%, which is intended to replace private discounts, is not very well received. The reason is that the number of notes discounted by the National Bank and those issued in the last few days of the financial panic, based on ten days, totals approximately 500 million marks, all of which will expire next week. Private banks want to protect themselves to prevent the possibility of financial tightening in the financial market at that time.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 8th - The Schröder Bank, which was closed due to the financial panic, will be fully reopened on Monday after a complete internal reorganization. Mr. Schröder and other directors have resigned, and Mr. Koppke of the Hamburg North German Bank has been appointed as the general manager. The bank has been renamed the North German Wirren Bank, with capital of 12 million marks, which was raised by entrepreneurs from Bremen and the central government.</p>

The clause requiring 90% of the employees of all companies to be Mexican citizens or naturalized Mexicans was not amended. According to this clause, the impact on overseas Chinese is the greatest.

However, overseas Chinese claim that if they are required to employ 90% Mexicans, they will be forced to shut down their businesses.</p>

<h3>General Remarks on the South Manchuria Railway, By Bin</h3>
<p>The Construction and Transfer of the South Manchuria Railway | The South Manchuria Railway Company and the South Manchuria Railway Network | The Railway Operated Under the Control of the South Manchuria Railway | The Businesses Operated by the South Manchuria Railway Company | The Persecution of Our Country by the South Manchuria Railway | The Current Railway Negotiations and How to Recover the South Manchuria Railway</p>
<p>Japan's aggression against our country has become increasingly focused on the three northeastern provinces since the Washington Conference. And its powerful tool for invading us is the South Manchuria Railway. The South Manchuria Railway stands before the Korean Railway, serving as the "Japanese Wedge" for Japan to attack the Asian continent with all its strength. It is fundamental to Japan's development towards the continent in both political and economic terms. Tanaka Giichi said, "By seizing the right to this major transportation artery, we can aggressively implement Emperor Meiji's third-stage plan to destroy Manchuria and Mongolia without hesitation." One can imagine the persecution of our country. In recent years, the authorities in the Northeast have been working hard on the planning and construction of the Northeast railway network in order to break through the difficult and dangerous future. However, what we are diligently striving for is precisely what the Japanese are in constant fear of. The generally nervous Japanese military and politicians have been chanting their absurd fallacies. The Japanese government has also appointed Uchida Kosai as the president of the South Manchuria Railway and dispatched Kimura as the so-called representative for railway negotiations. Although such a flustered and frantic state proves that they are alarmist fools, their intensified aggression against our Northeast is evident. If the South Manchuria Railway is not recovered for a single day, our country will not be able to rest easy for a single day. The great disaster of the future depends on the people of the country rising up and working hard. The author has taken the important aspects of the South Manchuria Railway and made a general discussion here to allow the people of the country to gain a glimpse of the importance of the South Manchuria Railway. In addition, the author is currently writing a book on the South Manchuria Railway, which will describe and discuss its various aspects in more detail. It will soon be published for the people of the country for reference. Author's Note</p>
<h3>(1) The Construction and Transfer of the South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>When we discuss the South Manchuria Railway, the first issue that needs to be clarified is the history of the South Manchuria Railway: how it was constructed and how it fell into the hands of the Japanese. Only by understanding this can we discuss other issues and only then can we discuss how to recover it in the future.</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway was originally the first railway built in our country by imperialists: the southern branch of the Eastern Provinces Railway. It started from a station on the main line of the Eastern Provinces Railway and ended at Dalian and Lushun. The treaty for the construction of the main line of the Eastern Provinces Railway was concluded in the Russian capital by Li Hongzhang of the Qing court and Russian Minister Lobanov in May 1896. The treaty for the construction of the southern branch line was concluded on July 6th, following the conclusion of the lease treaty for the Russian request to lease Lushun and Dalian on May 27, 1898. By the time these two major railway systems were built, they stretched for more than 1,600 miles, like a dagger shaped axe thrusting straight into the three northeastern provinces of our country, and the lifeline of the Northeast continent was being gradually cut and restricted. The difficult and dangerous situation in our Northeast today has also arisen from this.</p>
<p>The Japanese, seeing the arrogant and triumphant Russians, were constantly thinking of opportunities to fulfill their ambition to advance north into the continent. Constrained by the powerful Russians, they had no choice but to endure and wait, but they carefully observed every move of Russia in our three eastern provinces and Korea. They were already unable to endure with eyes red and ears burning. Finally, in 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out to fight for the rights and interests in our Northeast.</p>
<p>As a result of the war, Japan won and Russia lost. Through the mediation of US President Roosevelt, Japan and Russia concluded the Treaty of Portsmouth on September 5, 1905. Articles 5 and 6 of the treaty state:</p>
<p>(5) Russia, with the consent of the Chinese government, transfers and assigns to Japan the lease rights to Lushun, Dalian, and the surrounding territories and waters, as well as all rights, privileges, and concessions related to the lease and the organization of a part thereof...</p>
<p>(6) Russia, with the consent of the Chinese government, unconditionally transfers and assigns to Japan the railway between Changchun (Kuanchengzi) and Lushun and its branch lines, as well as all rights, privileges, properties, and all managed coal mines attached to the same place.</p>
<p>In December 1905, Japan, based on the Treaty of Portsmouth, forced the Qing court to sign the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Post-War Agreement, fully recognizing the validity of the Russo-Japanese peace treaty, and allowing it to officially lay the wartime military railway between Andong and Fengtian and to allow the South Manchuria Railway to connect with our country's railways. In addition, there are the so-called Essentials of the Secret Agreement Attached to the Sino-Japanese Treaty of December 20, 1905, which ceded even more of our country's rights. The existence of this secret agreement is in great doubt and may even have been fabricated by the Japanese. However, the Japanese are still arguing about it and using it as an excuse to this day.</p>
<p>After the Russo-Japanese Peace Treaty and the Sino-Japanese Treaty were successively concluded, the South Manchuria Railway and Lushun Dalian were easily seized by the Japanese. In addition, with the establishment of the lease rights for the Anfeng Railway, Japan's railway policy directly penetrated the heart of our three eastern provinces, and the freedom to develop its continental policy was guaranteed. Our country was the spoils of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War. Our good mountains and rivers were allowed to be divided and seized by others. The strong bandits divided the spoils, and the owner stood by and acknowledged it. This has led to the boundless storms of today. Was it the trend of the times? Or was it self-inflicted by our country? Looking back on this, we cannot help but sigh and hate the ignorance of the Qing dynasty. This is the construction and transfer of the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<h3>(2) The South Manchuria Railway Company and the South Manchurian Railway Network</h3>
<p>After Japan seized the South Manchuria Railway and its ports of Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian, it established the South Manchuria Railway Company in June 1906 by order of the Meiji Emperor. The organization of this company was a major political event that stirred Japan's government and public. At the beginning of its organization, there were eighty preparatory members, all leading figures from various circles in Japan at that time, with General Oku serving as the chairman of the committee. The special characteristic of this company was that it transcended economic considerations and became politicized. This can be confirmed by (1) the absolute jurisdiction of the Japanese government over the company and (2) the right of the South Manchuria Railway Company to designate consuls in Manchuria. Furthermore, its grand organization, extensive facilities, involvement in agriculture and industry, promotion of commerce, and control of education all went beyond the scope of economics. The company currently has 8,223 employees, totaling 34,612 people including other entrusted staff and employees. The total capital is currently 440,000,000 yuan (refer to the Manchuria-Mongolia Yearbook, Showa 6 edition). Its grand scale is truly comparable to the British East India Company's invasion of India. The company calls itself "an executive body with national functions." From our country's perspective, the company has also played a crucial role in the formation and development of Japan's Northeast policy. It is no exaggeration to call it the headquarters for the Japanese invasion of our Northeast.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the South Manchuria Railway Company devoted all its efforts to improving the main line and expanding its branch lines. In May 1908, the South Manchuria Railway's standard gauge was completed. In October 1911, the reconstruction of the standard gauge of the Anfeng Line was completed. The Lushun branch line and the Yingkou branch line were also reconstructed during this period. After the reconstruction of each line was completed, the South Manchuria Railway became the main line, Dalian became the export port, and other lines became feeder lines. Its business flourished day by day. It is difficult for our country's railways to catch up with it because they do not have an export seaport. Even the Eastern Province Railway, which has the port of Vladivostok, feels out of reach. The state of its business development can be seen in the table below.</p>

<p>(Note) This table is in Japanese yen</p>
<p>In the last two years, business has gradually declined due to the global economic downturn and the sharp drop in the price of silver, as well as the excessively high freight rates of the South Manchuria Railway. As of February of this year, the total revenue reduction exceeded 27,158,061 yen. The Japanese were greatly panicked by this, blaming it on the construction of railways by our country and the reduction of freight rates for the Four-Railway Joint Transportation, and began so-called railway negotiations. The government and public clamored incessantly, all day long. They invade our land, seize our interests, and interfere with our country's transportation administration. They speak of co-existence and co-prosperity, but in reality, they strangle our throat and try to put us to death. Their strength and unreasonableness are truly beyond compare.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the company's foundation, the Japanese have planned to build a South Manchurian railway network with the South Manchuria Railway as the main artery to encompass the entire Northeast region and make it inescapable. The insidious means of completing this railway network are generally:</p>
<p>(1) To vigorously develop Japan's existing railways and demand new railway rights to build new railways.</p>
<p>(2) To vigorously sabotage our country's self-operated railways. If sabotage fails, then demand investment and strive for control, so that our country has only the name while Japan controls the reality.</p>
<p>(3) To engage in economic competition with the Chinese Eastern Railway, loudly advocating the opening of the Northeast gateway, isolating our country diplomatically, and facilitating the implementation of its railway plans.</p>
<p>The so-called South Manchuria Railway as the main artery is the South Manchuria Railway centralism. The foundation of this centralism is based on the Dalian Port supremacy. If a railway does not have a seaport as its outlet, then its own value is very limited. It will inevitably become a nurturing line for railways with ports. Therefore, the Japanese have used the superior position of the South Manchuria Railway to vigorously develop its functions. On the one hand, they are expanding the throughput of Dalian Port and improving its facilities. On the other hand, they are planning to build interconnected circular railways. As for now, the Japanese focus is again concentrated on the completion of the Jihui Railway and the development of North Korean seaports. If successful, then the Japanese railways will flourish together, and multiple ports will compete for glory, advancing simultaneously from the southeast sides toward our Northeast. If their plans are realized, then their power will be like a net cast from all directions. Where can the provinces in our Northeast escape to? Therefore, the people of our country must swear to reject the Japanese demand for the construction of the Jihui Railway and should strive to complete the construction of Huludao Port. Otherwise, the future is bleak and unimaginable.</p>
<p>The railways currently operated by the South Manchuria Railway Company are:</p>
<p>(1) The South Manchuria Railway Main Line from Changchun to Dalian, a total of 438.5 miles</p>
<p>(2) The Anfeng Line from Sujiatun to Andong, a total of 161.7 miles</p>
<p>(3) The Lushun Line from Lushun to Choushui, a total of 31.6 miles</p>
<p>(4) The Yingkou Line from Dashiqiao to Yingkou, a total of 13.9 miles</p>
<p>(5) The Yantai Line from Yantai to Yantai Coal Mine, a total of 9.7 miles</p>
<p>(6) The Fushun Line from Yanghe to Fushun, a total of 35.4 miles, totaling 690.8 miles. Among them, the Japanese want to extend the lease period of the South Manchuria Railway and the Anfeng Railway in the twenty-one articles to ninety-nine years. The lease period of Lushun and Dalian has also been extended to ninety-nine years. They even attempt to occupy it permanently. However, our country has never recognized the twenty-one articles, and the Japanese cannot use it as an excuse. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Reorganization of Shi Bu (Shi Yousan's Troops)</h3>
<p>More than 10,000 members of Shi's troops arrived in Shandong</p>
<p>Shi has crossed the Jinpu Railway to leave the country</p>
<p>It has not yet been confirmed that Mi Wenhe has been captured</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Soldiers from Shi Yousan's defeated troops have been arriving in Shandong in droves. This reporter visited Chairman Han Fuqu of the Shandong Provincial Government this afternoon (7th) to inquire about the number of Shi's troops who arrived in Shandong, the resettlement measures, and the whereabouts of Shi Yousan himself. According to Han, more than 10,000 troops of Shi Yousan have retreated to Shandong in recent days and are located near Dezhou and Wucheng. It is not yet known how many more will arrive. The resettlement will first involve gathering and reorganizing the troops. How they will be reorganized will depend on the number of troops that arrive. Commander-in-Chief Chiang sent a telegram to Jinan yesterday, approving a preliminary allocation of 200,000 yuan from the central government for the resettlement of Shi's troops. In the future, the military pay for the reorganized Shi's troops will be determined separately by the central government and disbursed monthly. Currently, all supplies and provisions for Shi's troops are being provided by the government. Flour, military uniforms, etc., were transported from Jinan to Shi's troops the day before yesterday. Shi Yousan's telegram announcing his resignation has already been sent out. It is reported that Shi himself has crossed east of the Jinpu Railway. There are many seaports in the vicinity, and it is likely that he will leave the country from the Yangjiaogou area and will definitely not come to Jinan. This reporter also inquired about the accuracy of the news reported in Zhang Xueliang's telegram yesterday, which stated that Mi Wenhe and Sun Guangqian had been captured. According to Han, it is likely that Sun Guangqian was captured, but it is said that Mi Wenhe has not been captured. (7th)</p>
<p>Ge Guangting's Discussion</p>
<h3>Shi's Troops are in Utter Disarray</h3>
<p>Shi's Troops are completely handed over to Han for reorganization</p>
<p>Vice Commander Zhang will return to Liaoning within days</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway, was ordered by Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang to remain in Jinan due to military tension in order to liaise with Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu regarding important matters. Now that Ge believes that Shi's troops have been largely resolved, and the military situation has come to an end, there is no need to remain in Jinan. Therefore, he took the Jiaoji Railway train back to Qingdao last night (6th). According to Ge's account of the truth about the resolution of Shi's troops, "After Shi's troops were attacked by the Northeast Army and the Central Army, they were in utter disarray. Approximately 20,000 people have surrendered their weapons. Furthermore, according to the telegram of victory forwarded by Vice Commander Zhang this morning from Commander Yu of the First Army Corps, the defeated enemy was ambushed by our cavalry and the South Route Army north of Shulu, and over 10,000 people surrendered their weapons. The remnants then entrenched themselves in the Fanjiazhuang, Dongxi Baying, and Shuangliushu areas and were completely surrounded by our cavalry and the South Route Army. The entire enemy was disarmed around noon. Shi's division commanders Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe, and others were captured. Shi Yousan only led his pistol regiment to escape towards Hengshui. Our Fifth Cavalry Brigade has been tracking and pursuing them, and the Sixth Cavalry Brigade is searching the battlefield. Moreover, Shen Ke, the former division commander of Shi's troops, has indeed surrendered to our side with his troops in Quyang and is awaiting reorganization. Therefore, there are few remaining troops of Shi Yousan. It is reported that Shi himself has arrived in Zaoqiang, and there are reports that he has arrived in Wucheng from Zaoqiang. Chairman Han has indeed received a telegram from Shi expressing his remorse and indicating that he was manipulated by others and requesting to resign, handing over all his troops to Chairman Han for reorganization. Chairman Han has already sent personnel to Dezhou, Wucheng, and other places to negotiate the reorganization of Shi's troops. As for Shi himself, if he can immediately leave the army, Chairman Han can ensure his safety and send him out of the country. As for the reports that Shi will pass through Qingdao to Dalian, that is speculation and not yet certain." Furthermore, "Shi's troops can be completely eliminated within days. It is reported that Vice Commander Zhang will return to Liaoning after Shi's troops are eliminated. I (Ge Guangting) plan to visit Zhang in Ping before Vice Commander Zhang returns to Liaoning to report on the situation in Jinan with Chairman Han and to request instructions on everything. I will probably depart within three or four days." (August 7th)</p>
<p>Korean Residents of Wanbaoshan</p>
<h3>After the Ditch was Completed</h3>
<p>Trial Impoundment Flooded More Than 100 Qing of Civilian Farmland</p>
<p>Japanese Police Claim They Will Leave in a Few Days</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: More than a month has passed since the Wanbaoshan Incident, and the Japanese military police still have no intention of withdrawing. We hereby record the recent situation as follows:</p>
<p>Conditions of the Dike and Ditch: The horizontal earth dike built by Korean farmers under the supervision of the Japanese police is approximately forty zhang wide and fifteen chi high. Willow branches are used to weave fences, which are covered with earth. A place for water to flow is left in the middle, approximately four or five chi deep. If the place for water flow is blocked with earth bags, the water level of the river inside the dike will increase and flow directly into the ditch, which is more than twenty li long. Around July 10th, the dike was completed, and a trial impoundment was carried out. The water in the ditch flowed into the paddy fields, which are located on higher ground than the surrounding area and have no place to discharge the water. More than 100 qing of nearby civilian farmland were flooded. Later, the earth bags were removed, the river level dropped, and the previously flooded fields were spared from water damage. However, the滩地 on the east bank of the river is still under water. The earth dike has sunk about one chi due to water leakage. The root of the earth dike outside the water flow area has been scoured into deep eddies. In the future, if there is a heavy rain, the earth dike will collapse. Liu Jing, the Japanese Consul in Fengtian, and five others arrived in Changchun on July 24th because they were ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the situation of Korean people in the Eastern Provinces. On the 26th and 27th, they went to Wanbaoshan to conduct an on-site investigation, asking farmers about the situation of the water being diverted into the ditch and the farmland being flooded. They instructed that the ditch mouth near the river should be blocked to avoid flooding, which was implemented on July 30th. It was discovered that on June 8th, Consul Liu Jing was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to come to Changchun to investigate this matter. He stayed in Changchun for two weeks before returning to Liaoning. He was deceived and surrounded by the Japanese Consul in Changchun, Tadashige Tashiro, who acted perversely, which led to the event on July 2nd when Japanese military police machine-gunned farmers who were legitimately defending themselves. If Liu Jing had gone to conduct an on-site investigation of this case at that time, it might not have become an issue long ago.</p>
<p>Korean People Attempt to Plant Paddy Rice: Tadashige Tashiro, the Japanese Consul in Changchun, was muddle-headed and obstinate. In late June, when the farming season was already over, he forced the Korean people to try to plant paddy rice. The Korean people all wanted to go elsewhere to make a living. The consul ordered the guarantor not to allow them to go elsewhere. At the same time, he sent police to whip and punish them for their work. The Korean people endured and went through the motions. Without digging ponds or dividing the area, and only removing the weeds, they casually scattered the rice seeds on the barren fields. In mid-July, the rice seedlings only grew to about one inch. The weeds were about two chi deep, and the rice seedlings were all suppressed by the weeds. They have now all turned yellow and withered, which is extremely ridiculous.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of the Resident Japanese Police: There are currently about twenty Japanese police officers at the Majia Sentinel post on the nearby river bank. Most of the Japanese police officers going to take over the shift arrive in the morning, and the police officers being transferred back mostly arrive at night, so it is not possible to obtain the exact number. Half of the Japanese police officers live in the house with the built gun emplacement owned by the He family at the river mouth, and half are scattered in temporary shelters in the wilderness at the river mouth. They patrol the ditch line and the rice fields more than twenty li away from time to time. In the house of the landowner, Zhang Hongbin, there are only six Korean people left to cook for the Japanese police. Now that the sorghum has grown tall, and the green gauze tent is up, bandits appear from time to time. The Japanese police are all on guard and restless day and night. They are all urgently awaiting orders to return to the forcibly occupied civilian houses on the river bank of Majia Sentinel. Currently, only the He family has one house, and the He family is urging them to vacate it immediately because the women in the family have nowhere to live. According to the Japanese police, "Wait a few more days, don't worry, we will be leaving soon."</p>
<p>Heavy Losses to Farmland: The farmland was flooded by more than 100 qing when the water was diverted for trial purposes. Fortunately, it was only for a short time, and there was no major damage. However, the ditch crosses more than twenty li, making it inconvenient for farmers to travel to cultivate their farmland, resulting in a huge loss of time, labor, and wages. In addition, the harvest of the nearby farmland, which was previously guarded by the Japanese police and not allowed to be cultivated, has also been reduced. The nearby willow trees have been forcibly cut down completely. The affected farmers submitted a report to the Jilin Provincial Government, the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, and the Changchun County Government in late July, stating the previous situation and requesting negotiations for compensation. The amount of each loss will be investigated and reported later.</p>
<p>Japanese Secretive State: The situation of the Japanese military tents and police team in Majia Sentinel, aiming with guns in the trenches, was previously photographed and published by news reporters from our country's newspapers. The Japanese were initially pleased, but then became quite regretful. When Professor Zhang Qiyun of the Department of Geography of Nanjing Central University and others went to conduct an on-site investigation on August 1st, the three military tents were combined into one. When the team members were taking photos there, the Japanese police stopped them and said that they were afraid of being publicized by the newspapers and being blamed by Chinese and foreign public opinion.

<p>South Manchuria</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Summer Exercises</h3>
<p>Violating Practice of Not Notifying in Advance</p>
<p>Forcing Residents Within the Line to Relocate</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: The Japanese garrison troops along the South Manchuria and Anfeng lines are strategically deployed, ostensibly to protect the railways and ensure the safety of passengers, but their actual purpose is not only that. According to Japanese military regulations, they conduct military exercises in sections along the railway lines once during the summer and winter, practicing fire maneuvers and conducting group combat. However, before each march, the Japanese military commanders would notify the Chinese authorities, specify the dates of the march and the area of combat, and then announce it to local merchants and residents to avoid panic. However, this summer exercise along the South Manchuria Line, the Japanese army violated the usual practice and did not notify in advance. Suddenly, from July 22nd to the 26th, the Third Artillery Battalion of the Japanese stationed in Haicheng conducted combat exercises in the area of ​​Da Qianhucun, Lizikou, and Donggangzi in the eastern suburbs of Haicheng. The artillery fire was continuous from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM every day, and the sound shook the fields, causing general residents to be extremely frightened. The Japanese military also used the pretext of fire drills and the danger of guns and ammunition, ordering all residents within the battle line to move to other places. Each household was given one yen per day for food expenses. The residents did not dare to resist and had to move to other places with the old and the young, no different from war refugees, wandering the roads. A farmer with the surname Wang in Da Qianhucun had scheduled to marry off his daughter on the 23rd. On that day, his whole family was evicted by the Japanese army. Before they could marry off their daughter, the whole family fled to other places. Also, an old man with the surname Li in Donggangzi Village, nearly seventy years old, had a relapse of a chronic illness that had not healed for years. The Japanese army ordered his family to carry the old man to the neighboring village on a door panel. There was also a farmer named Bai Shiwu in Lizikou, who took his wife and daughter to a neighboring village to hide. Bai accidentally walked into the Japanese battle line and was arrested by the Japanese army, beaten severely, and then released. There were several other villagers who were beaten by the Japanese army for moving too slowly or accidentally stepping into the battle line. The villagers felt uneasy. The local Public Security Bureau repeatedly reported the situation to the villagers, and after dispatching personnel to conduct an on-site investigation, they once tried to stop it, but to no avail. Therefore, they reported it to the county government, requesting negotiations with the Japanese side. The report stated that the Japanese army's live ammunition shooting outside the occupied territories was already detrimental to national dignity. Furthermore, it was even more disregard for our country's sovereignty to commit violence and injure people. If the matter is not seriously negotiated, the Japanese army will be even more unbridled in the future. However, by the time the county government raised the matter for negotiation with the Japanese side, the Japanese military's combat period had ended, and the entire team had returned to defense.

<h3>Unprecedented Flood in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>Disaster-stricken Area Comprises Forty-Two Counties</p>
<p>Estimated Number of Deaths by Drowning Reaches Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer in Hunan Province, it has been raining continuously for months, causing flash floods and turning the plains into rivers. Forty-two counties, including Xiangxiang and Xiangtan, have reported floods one after another. The water situation is especially severe in the counties bordering the lake. The number of deaths by drowning in each county is estimated to be in the tens of thousands, and the number of displaced people reaches hundreds of thousands. Dikes and embankments have collapsed, and crops have been submerged. The crops in the high-lying fields in each county have also been damaged by螟蟊 due to the prolonged rain, and the autumn harvest is completely hopeless. The severity of the disaster is truly unprecedented. The Provincial Relief Affairs Association specially telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting that it consider the severity of the disaster in Hunan and list it as a special disaster area, and issue a large sum of relief money to save the survivors. The original text is as follows: Urgent, Chairman Xu Jun of the Nanjing Relief Affairs Committee, Hunan Province has been suffering from disasters, and misfortunes have followed one another. There is no year without warfare, droughts, and floods. This year, the banditry has not been quelled, and the floods have risen again. Since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain, which has not stopped until now. The disaster has spread throughout the province, and the misery is difficult to describe. The floods have continued to rise, and the disaster situation has expanded day by day. According to Xiangxiang, Xiangtan, Hengshan, Hengyang, Yueyang, Xiangyin, Changde, Taoyuan, Huarong, Nanxian, Yuanjiang, Anxiang, Hanshou, Chaling, Anren, Yiyang, Anhua, 溪 Guiyang, Xintian, Qiancheng, Yongsui, Yuanling, 淑Pu, Yongxing, Qiyang, Sangzhi, Shimen, Linli, Li County, Cili, Yizhang, Chen County, Pingjiang, Ningyuan, Yongshun, Dayong, Leiyang, Guzhang, Changsha, Huitong, and Huang County, and other forty-two counties. The urgent reports are filled with heavy disasters and are unbearable to read. Whether due to flash floods or waterlogging, the mountainous fields are filled with waves and have become泽国. The levee-protected fields have collapsed, and everything from homes to belongings has been washed away. Countless livestock and trees have been lost, and the number of deaths by drowning is estimated to be in the tens of thousands. The number of displaced people is also in the millions. Although the crops in the high-lying fields in other counties have not been flooded, they have also been affected by the prolonged rain, and 螟胜蟊贼, 暗长潜滋, damaged crops, and the harvest is hopeless. Moreover, the rain has not stopped, the flood is increasing day by day, and the insect pests are getting worse. Farmers have worked hard all year round, but they are now without hope. Survival is impossible, and the future is dire. If relief is not urgently sought, the old and weak will have no means of livelihood and will fill the ditches, and the young and strong will take risks, and they will inevitably become bandits, which is a pitiful phenomenon and a worrying hidden danger. Hunan Province has suffered many catastrophes, and its vitality is exhausted. The public and private sectors are in difficulty, and there is no way to raise relief funds. We can only sigh and look up at the roof, unable to fill the gap. In addition to the committee members conducting inspections in various ways, we implore you to consider the extraordinary disaster in Hunan and list it as a special disaster area. We urgently request that you appoint senior officials to come to Hunan for inspection, and issue a large sum of relief money to provide immediate relief. Upon further investigation, the Executive Yuan approved 100,000 yuan for emergency relief last year, but we have not received it despite repeated telegrams. We urge you to forward the letter to the Ministry of Finance and approve the full amount of emergency relief as soon as possible to save the disaster victims and eliminate hidden dangers. We eagerly await your orders, and we are grateful and impressed. Cao Bowen, Zhang Jiongcheng, and Xiwenganyin, Standing Committee Members of the Hunan Provincial Relief Affairs Association.</p>
<h3>Canal Upstream Water Surge</h3>
<p>Liang Guanying Requests Opening of the Zhaoguan Dam</p>
<p>The Great Flood of the Republic Era 10 [1921] Dared Not Lightly Open [the Dam]</p>
<p>A dispatch from Zhenjiang: In the past five days, the source of the Yi River in the upper reaches of the canal has changed from receding to a gradual surge. The Water Conservancy Bureau suddenly received a telegram from Director Mao from Gaoyou the day before yesterday (the 7th), reporting that the Yi River had surged more than ten feet, already showing an alarming trend. Today, telegrams were received continuously from various institutions and organizations of the Huaiyin County Government and Chamber of Commerce, stating that the water in the upper reaches of the canal was surging, and the first and second sluice gates of Huaiyin had been overflowed. The Yi River is arriving again, and the military and civilians are now cooperating to protect the dikes. Please quickly open the Zhaoguan Dam to release the upstream water. It has been more than eighty years since the Zhaoguan Dam was opened, and the diversion canal below the dam has also been quite silted up. During the great flood of the Republic Era 10 [1921], after much contention, it was ultimately not lightly opened. However, the Yi River is surging excessively, and the counties on the eastern bank of the upper reaches of the canal will inevitably become a land of swamps. The area near Mount Mailing is especially vast and boundless, and the mountain will be like an island in a lake or sea. Sun Hongzhe, Director of the Construction Department, and Pei, the Chief Engineer of the Water Conservancy Bureau, led engineering staff and carried large sums of construction funds to inspect the upper and lower reaches of the canal north of the river this afternoon. Furthermore, on the 7th, the water level at Yumatou rose by five minutes [of a foot], reaching a water depth of one foot eight inches nine minutes. Bengbu dropped nine centimeters, with a water depth of nineteen meters seventy-seven. Yaowan rose another nine inches six centimeters, reaching a water depth of twenty-two meters fifty-two.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Yangzhou: The Chief Commander of the Twenty-fifth Route telegraphed Supervisor Su yesterday, saying that the canal water was surging and had been reported repeatedly. Recently, due to the sudden arrival of the Yi River, it has become increasingly turbulent. The areas near Matouzhen are particularly critical. The first sluice gate is only two inches away [from overflowing], and the second sluice gate has already caused flooding. Although the officers and soldiers are blocking day and night, it is useless to block in the east and overflow in the west, and there is no comprehensive solution. The Shuangqiaodongkou of the third sluice gate has not yet been repaired. If it continues to rise, the dikes of the Huaichen sluice gates may collapse and become irreparable. The Zhaoguan Dam in Gaoyou can be opened in the event of large water according to precedent. If the dam is opened, the lives and property of the people in the counties north of the river will have a glimmer of hope. In addition to directly telegraphing Chairman Ye, this telegram is for your attention. However, it is still unknown how the person in charge will handle it.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The water level in Jiangduzhou, discharged from the Chexin and Nan San dams, did not rise or fall on the 7th and 8th, which can be considered stable. The water level record at Gaoyou Yumatou fell to one foot eight inches seven minutes five on the 6th, and rose one inch again on the 7th, with a total water depth of one foot eight inches eight minutes five. However, the northwest wind has been strong in recent days, and the Shao embankment is still dangerous.陸士銓, the section chief of the county, together with the Jiangdu section of the public works office, surveyed and prepared to raise the embankment. The areas to be raised have been determined: Yangzi Bridge in Guazhou, Wantou near the city, and Wangzhuang and Lujin in Shaobo, all to be raised by three feet, with a top width of one zhang. The county is responsible for first building the five-foot (wide) section facing the water, with a deadline of one week for completion. Yesterday (the 7th), the county government, in accordance with provincial orders, ordered the recruitment of 1,500 civilian laborers within three days, carrying tools, to be used by the Water Conservancy Bureau, and provided them with food and wages. The Public Security Bureau was specially ordered to rush the recruitment. The bureau feared that the recruited laborers would misunderstand and suspect it was for military use, so it ordered Liao Chuliang, the chief inspector, to go to Shao early on the 8th with personnel from the Water Conservancy Bureau to recruit nearby along the embankment, designating the specific embankment to be rushed to build, so as to encourage enthusiastic recruitment. It is estimated that it can be completed in three or four days. It is also learned that Sun Hongzhe, Director of the Construction Department, will pass through Yangzhou from the province around 3 p.m. on the 8th to go to Gaoyou for work. The Shaobo public assistance temporary office for the embankment work telegraphed to the provincial and civil construction departments, saying that the wind is tight and the waves are beating the embankment, and the danger is imminent. The cost of rushing to repair is huge, and the strength is weak and unsustainable. Please order the county to allocate funds quickly to protect the embankment and save lives. Hundreds of millions of lives depend on this. Please telegraph a reply quickly.</p>

<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Inspection of Hymen of Female Actors in a Case of Abduction and Indecent Assault：In Hujiaqiao Town of this county, a troupe of male and female actors came to perform new dramas at a borrowed venue. Before even three days had passed, a young man named Xu Shouchang from Hangzhou, who had arrived from Shanghai, reported to the local public security station that Wei Guobin, a male actor in the troupe, had lured and indecently assaulted his younger sister, Xu Qingzhen (who was also an actress in the troupe). However, the station lacked evidence to prove whether the Xus were siblings. Therefore, they brought all involved to the county for investigation. At the same time, Xu Shouchang also submitted a certificate from an officer of the Fifth Division and filed a lawsuit. President Shen then appointed Prosecutor Xu Chengshen to open a court for interrogation. Xu Shouchang claimed that he lived in Zhabei, Shanghai, and worked in journalism. The girl was his third younger sister. She had been missing since the 15th of last month. After repeated investigations, he learned that Wei Guobin, who was involved in new dramas, had abducted her. Xu Qingzhen testified that she was fifteen years old and did not know Wei Guobin. On the night of the 15th of last month, she was cooling off in the Great World entertainment center when Wei, in collusion with an accomplice, lured her to a hotel and confined her, forbidding her from leaving. He then took her to Minhang by steamer and forced her to perform in new dramas. Since she was alone and helpless, she had no choice but to obey his orders and went with him to various places. She was indecently assaulted five times. Wei Guobin, on the other hand, claimed that the girl worked as a hostess at the rooftop garden of the Wing On Company in Shanghai and was a promiscuous woman. She had voluntarily joined the troupe and was paid wages every day. There was no indecent assault. Prosecutor Xu Chengshen, finding the testimonies of both parties contradictory and lacking proof, ordered that Wei Guobin be detained. As for whether Xu Qingzhen had been indecently assaulted, he had sent her to the county clinic's Western medical director, Hu Dacai, and female doctors Zhou Ruiyu and Wang Ziying for examination. The results showed that the girl's development was not complete, and her hymen had a crack but was not broken. However, there were semen secretions outside her labia minora, and the area was scarlet red, resembling inflammation. Based on this report, the county government had planned to continue the interrogation yesterday, but since the plaintiff, Xu Shouchang, had returned to Shanghai, the verdict will be announced next Friday.</p>

<p>Turmoil Over the Removal of a Principal: Chen Jiajie, the former director of the County Education Bureau, who also served as a member of the Party Rectification Committee, caused a student strike due to planting his cronies since he concurrently served as the director on May 1st of this year. The Education Department clearly ordered his dismissal. After the news of Chen's dismissal was announced, he dismissed the principals of Mingqiang and Minghua schools, which had achieved good results, and appointed his relatives and friends, causing a public outcry. Tao Qiqing, the new director, took over on the 1st of this month. After learning the truth, he was deeply afraid of causing disputes again, which would affect the progress of local education. He immediately collected opinions from education inspectors as the standard for the advancement and retreat of principals and convened a bureau affairs meeting on the morning of the 7th to discuss. As a result, Gu Zhiyong, the principal of Huibei Elementary School, was allowed to return to his post. The other dismissed principals were also reappointed or transferred. A turmoil has been calmed.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Sun Shoumei Sues After Release From Prison: Sun Xiangyun, a wealthy resident of Xinzhuang, was kidnapped two years ago. The bandits sent a letter demanding 120,000 yuan. The Sun family, Sun Xu Shi and her daughter Baozhen, suspected that their nephew Sun Shoumei was involved in the kidnapping. They filed a lawsuit and the Songjiang County Government, which also handled judicial affairs, detained him for investigation. The water police captured several bandits, including Huang Miaogen and Liu Asi. The County Court was established and the case was transferred to the court for re-investigation. The kidnappers, including Huang, did not involve Sun Shoumei. Apart from Huang Miaogen and Liu Asi, who were executed, Sun Shoumei was declared innocent. He was detained for one year and ten months. Sun's businesses, such as the Meiyuan Garden, completely withered, causing considerable losses. Both material and spiritual aspects were sacrificed. He sued Sun Xu Shi and her daughter for false accusations and perjury to the Procuratorate. The court opened an investigation yesterday. After the plaintiff stated the previous situation and the defendant testified, the prosecutor said that whether the false accusation was established in this case needed further study. Since several defendants in this case had appealed to the High Court, the original files would be returned after the trial. They were ordered to return.</p>
<p>Approval of Request to Preserve Places of Interest by the Ministry: Cai Guangyao and other members of the Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Industry to revoke the fraudulently obtained mining rights of the Nine Peaks in Song County, which were ancient sites that should be reorganized and protected, and to permanently prohibit mining. They also requested that the Songqing counties be quickly handled. Now, the Ministry of Industry replied: "We have received your request. We have successively ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines that the matter of Jiang Erchang falsely claiming to lead the Tianma Mountain land and violating the order to quarry stones should be prohibited immediately and properly handled by the department. As for the mountain land led by Li Gengyu and Wu Ren'an, the department should investigate and prohibit any unauthorized quarrying strictly. You should know this."</p>

<p>Liuhuo District Xiaohongmiao Primary School Raises Funds to Build a New School Building: Since Principal He took over Liuhuo District Xiaohongmiao Elementary School, he has managed the school affairs diligently and spared no effort, so the achievements are outstanding. It is now heard that the school has decided to build a new school building in the short term because the original school building is not enough to accommodate and is not suitable. It has been carefully estimated that at least 2,500 silver dollars are required. It is also heard that Principal He has hired Zhou Tingzhen and others as members of the preparatory committee for the construction of the school building. Concrete measures have been drawn up for the construction plan and fundraising remuneration.</p>

<p>Returning Home in the Same Car and Suddenly Suffering from a Poisonous Hand: Wu Baozhi from Jurong and his fellow villagers</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Ren Da, Huogen, Dashuigen, and Ni Sheng were all attendants in a bathhouse on Sanma Road in Shanghai. The four people then jointly paid a deposit of 700 yuan. Later, due to poor business, they owed 400 yuan. According to the rules, the four people should bear it together, but Da and others were unwilling. After many days of arguing in Shanghai, the problem could not be resolved. On the evening of the 7th, the four people took the night train to Danyang to return to their hometown to seek a solution. Who knows that Da and others harbored ill intentions? When the car arrived near Yangqiao outside Xiaoximen in this county, Wu was pushed out of the car. No one noticed at the time. Wu was groggy after getting out of the car. It was not until six o'clock on the 8th that a soldier caught sight of him, stepped forward and called him to wake up. Because the injury was quite serious, the station sent a porter to carry Wu to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After the doctor discovered that stones were embedded in his arm and chest, he was in critical condition and may lose his life.</p>
<p>Dismissed District Chief Caught After Fleeing: He Guozhao, the district chief of the seventh district of Zhangpu Township, was accused of fraud by Li Zhihui. The county government took bail for interrogation because the case involved criminal law. Later, he was suspended by a provincial order. Zhang Yilun, the new district chief, went to the township the day before yesterday to take over. Because He had used more than 4,000 yuan of public funds successively and could not make up for it, he gave excuses for handing over procedures that had not been completed. He first handed over the seal and then fled without a trace. Chen Jiafu, the owner of the Zhouzhizhen Chen Dongsheng Rice Shop, who was the guarantor, learned that he immediately sent his staff Shao Cang and Shuiludingqi to search in Su and Shanghai. After many days of not meeting, He was suddenly found at the Datong Hotel in Cangtan (renamed Yu) at 6 p.m. on the 8th. Shao Lu brought He to the county government, and the representative, Chen Jiafu, presented a request to withdraw the guarantee. Judge Pang immediately summoned and interrogated him, and instructed Shao Lu to bring the original guarantor to the case for further verification.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suspicious Officer Leads Team for Verification: There is a Wang Bin who claims to be the adjutant of the 56th Division of the Army. He came to Suzhou from Fuzhou and stayed in room 63 of the Datong Hotel. He went to the Public Security Bureau with a document and asked to send the police to assist in arresting wanted criminals. Director Zou found that the format and seal of the official document were inconsistent, which seemed to be forged. He immediately telegraphed the 2nd Regiment of the Garrison in Suzhou to bring Wang and his team for verification. Yesterday (9th), after the regiment interrogated Wang, Wang Bin confessed that the official document was forged. There were three people when he came to Suzhou, and now two have left, leaving him alone. Commander Jin plans to send Wang to the Capital Garrison Command for verification today according to his confession.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Kidnapped Victim in Yixing Safely Escapes: Chen Xida and Chen Songda, villagers in Shengzhuang Village, Zhangzhu, Yixing, were kidnapped by a gang of bandits. Chen Songda had already been released. It is now learned that Chen Xida was also released from the bandit den the day before yesterday. The Chen family was extremely happy. After Xida returned home, he recounted the experience of being kidnapped, saying, "It has been twenty days since I was kidnapped by the bandits. In the bandit den, two or three bandits took turns guarding me every day and did not allow me to move freely. I had to move several times a day. When it came time to eat, I was taken to the top of the mountain, and there were no tables or stools. We all sat on the ground. After eating, I was still escorted to the bottom of the mountain and confined to the bandit den." Later, one of the bandit leaders talked to me. He said, "You have been kidnapped by our team for a long time. Our team has also sent a letter to notify your family, but no reply has been received and no one has come to negotiate. Now, our team has sent someone to Shen's family to investigate and found that your family is indeed without money, so we will release you today."</p>
<p>Crackdown on Private Counterfeit Coin Production Organization: Gao Chongshan, the director of the first public security bureau, reported yesterday that Pan Renbiao, a resident of No. 4 Tushuguan Road, near Guanqian Street, was privately producing counterfeit coins at home and mixing them on the market, causing a lot of harm. Please send the police to arrest them quickly. Director Gao, according to the report, immediately sent Bureau Officer Qin Jingqing, led Patrol Captain Wu Quan, and informants to execute it. After arriving at the destination, he ordered the informants to buy counterfeit coins with four silver dollars. Sure enough, he bought 22 yuan of lead counterfeit silver dollars. Bureau Officer Qin, with the real money in hand, immediately rushed in and arrested Pan Renbiao first, and found 26 counterfeit silver dollars, 8 counterfeit double dimes, 4 models, and half a can of powder. He then brought the witnesses to the bureau and sent them to the headquarters. After the third section staff Zhang Shuping opened the court and interrogated him, Pan Renbiao confessed that he used to work in a military band. After losing his job, he could not maintain his livelihood, so he did not deny privately producing counterfeit coins. Zhang Jun verified the confession and ordered the detention. Yesterday (9th), he prepared a document and sent it to the county court for interrogation according to law.</p>
<p>A Citywide Furor Over Catching Monkeys: Qin Xiaolu, the former county magistrate of this county, now raises two monkeys, male and female, in Xiaolou Lane in Wancheng. They are docile. At 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, one of the female monkeys escaped. After the Qin family noticed, it was gone. At about 8 o'clock in the evening, the monkey had sneaked into the nursery in front of the new temple and hugged a three-year-old baby and fled. The nanny saw it and immediately stepped forward to chase it before she threw the baby down. But the child was half dead. After a while, the baby went to Zhu Bingdie's house, next door to the nursery, and destroyed the furnishings in the room one by one. He then went to a hawker's house and ate large amounts of honey peaches and watermelon and other fresh fruits. Yesterday (9th) at 9 a.m., the monkey was running east and west on the roofs in and out of the north gate. So, merchants and residents came out to catch it, but the monkey was cunning, so it was not caught. Xu Jigui, the director of the Public Security Bureau, also heard the news. Fearing that it would disrupt public order, he sent four detectives with pistols to catch it. For a time, it spread throughout the city, and the viewers were like a wall. By 4 p.m., it was rumored that the monkey had been caught by detectives on the roof of a certain family.</p>
<p>The Silk Market is in Decline, Requesting Relief: The silk factories in this county and the Silk Factory Association jointly presented to the government, after failing in business last year, were approved to issue 8 million yuan of silk industry relief public bonds, and starting from May 20 this year, 30 yuan of public debt funds were collected per package from the customs when raw silk was exported. Since the beginning of the request for relief last year, it has been a year to date, and the factories have also been bearing the repayment of public debt funds for three months, but the so-called approved public bonds have not yet been issued. The factories are looking forward to it, waiting eagerly. And the government is handling this public bond, on the one hand, to relieve the silk factories that lost money in the 19th year of the Republic and encourage the export of raw silk. On the other hand, they also said that those who could not continue to start work this year would not be eligible to receive the public bonds. Therefore, although the capital of the factories was lost last year and they owed money to the money houses as much as 40,000, 50,000, 60,000, or 70,000, they had to borrow east and west, pledge items, and collect cash as little as several thousand and as much as 10,000 or 20,000 this year to start work with difficulty in order to obtain relief public bonds and repay the money owed to the money houses. This kind of quenching thirst with poison is really a great sigh. In addition, this year's spring and summer cocoons have been affected by the weather, and the harvest is poor, less than 20% compared to previous years. Now, the factories are short of raw materials. If it is an ordinary business, then rare things are expensive, and the price of silk will naturally skyrocket. However, the European and American silk markets are manipulated by Japanese merchants, so the downstream is becoming more and more depressed, and the sales of Chinese silk are extremely sluggish. At present, the price of silk is only 830-840 taels per load, which is not enough to offset the cost of cocoons. The remaining 200 taels of silk reeling is completely unavailable. The managers of the factories calculate on average that each factory reeling one load of silk a day has to lose more than 200 taels of silver. The managers of the factories are in this desperate situation, and they really want to cry without tears and want to die without being able to. The association has received letters from the managers of the factories and has carefully reviewed the current situation of the factories, believing that it is very dangerous. Yesterday, it specifically presented a document to the county government for review and asked them to quickly find ways to coordinate relief to maintain the silk industry.</p>

<p>County Government Summons for Interrogation in the Case of Conflict Between Police and Local Militia: The Houcheng Local Militia was arresting bandits for the Zhouzhuang Branch Big Sword Society one day. Zhang Guangde, a member of the local militia, and the Big Sword Society clashed, resulting in the shooting of Zhou Dougen and the drowning of Xu Bingxiang and Ding Zuomei.

<p>The Impact of Building a Dam on the Sangan River in Changshu: Yangku Fushou Township in the Seventh District has a low terrain. This time, it suffered a heavy flood. The reason is that Changshu is on a higher elevation, and built a dam without authorization, causing the water to be discharged poorly. After the flood, a few landlords in Changshu, who did not understand the overall situation, not only destroyed the dam of the first Sangan River, but also dammed the second and third Sangan rivers at the same time. The farmers in the township gathered thousands of people the day before yesterday, intending to gather themselves to destroy the dam. The district chief, Wang Wenkui, said that the original purpose of dredging the Sangan River was to guide the water source and develop water conservancy, so that it would connect to the Yangtze River in the north and reach Taihu Lake in the south, which could be verified. He has persuaded them on the one hand to wait for the county government to review and handle it. He also presented to the county to quickly telegraph the Changshu County Government to order the dam to be demolished so as to unblock the water flow and send personnel to survey and devise relief measures to benefit people's livelihood. (According to farmers in the fourth district of Changshu, the farmers blocked the flow and built a dam in the Sangan River, causing the farmers in the fifth district to prevent it. The county sent personnel to demolish it, causing a trend. The farmers in the fourth district strive to If you want to demolish the Sangan River Dam, you must first dredge the Thirteen Weigang, which is difficult to solve.)</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>County Executive Committee Requests Handling of Grain Reserves: The Zhenjiang County Executive Committee sent a letter to the county government yesterday, stating that Zhenjiang originally had a grain reserve warehouse, which is now abandoned. The original grain reserve funds have never been cleared, and disaster preparedness is extremely neglected. As the 20th fiscal year approaches, it is appropriate to select and handle matters according to the Ministry of Interior's annual work procedures. Please investigate the silver taels stored in the county's original grain reserve warehouse and discuss promoting its use for disaster preparedness, etc.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>District Court Established: The Ministry of Judicial Administration, due to the increase in litigation cases in the counties of Tong, Ru, Tai, and Hai in northern Jiangsu Province, upgraded the Nantong County Court and reorganized it into a District Court. President Jian is currently preparing everything, and it is scheduled to be established on September 1st.</p>
<p>Land Tax Collected with Conservancy Donation: Nantong is carrying out riverbank conservancy projects, which require substantial funds. The provincial government approved the local request to collect a conservancy donation along with the land tax. The Finance Bureau will begin collecting from the 8th, adding 8 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li of silver for every tael of silver, collected for five consecutive years, yielding over 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Local Public Bond Use: The Nantong Finance Reorganization Committee noted that in 1921, Zhang Xiaoruo, in the name of the Nantong Autonomy Association, issued 2 million yuan in local public bonds, originally for local construction needs. However, the use of these funds has never been made public, and no interest or principal has been repaid. On the 8th, it was resolved to conduct a thorough investigation, sending letters to the original directors to inquire about the process.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Residents of North Gate Petition the County Government: The riverbank outlets and Touzhaikou in this county experienced several incidents yesterday morning (the 5th), but were successfully contained. Unexpectedly, at around 5 PM yesterday, leaks reappeared at the riverbank outlet and Touzhaikou, and by 9 PM, they were still not blocked. Residents outside the North City were greatly alarmed, fearing water would enter the city. They gathered two to three thousand people and went to the county government to petition for: (1) efforts to contain the leaks at Touzhaikou and the riverbank outlet; (2) no accumulation of soil at the four city gates; and (3) the county magistrate to hand over those who privately opened the dams. County Magistrate Wang responded that he would of course make every effort to contain the leaks at Touzhaikou and the riverbank outlet. Regarding the second point, local elders said that soil should be accumulated at the four city gates during major floods, and asked everyone not to misunderstand. While he was speaking, a gong was sounded again at the riverbank outlet to report to the county that the leaks were still not contained. County Magistrate Wang immediately rushed to supervise the containment work, and both leaks were blocked late into the night.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Vagrant Escape from the Vocational Training Center: The Jiaxing Vagrant Vocational Training Center was established in early July. The cotton weaving, sewing, and knitting workshops have already started operations, with a total of thirty-seven vagrants. Unexpectedly, at around 9 PM on the 8th, several vagrants in Cell No. 1 created a disturbance in the cell, claiming they were fighting. The warden and deputy warden, as well as various staff members, were absent at the time. The guards stopped and persuaded them, but they took the opportunity to escape. When the County Public Security Bureau learned of this, it dispatched police to the scene, only to find that eleven vagrants had escaped from the cell. It was also learned that a certain guard, fearing arrest due to responsibility issues, had also allegedly escaped. The names of the escaped vagrants have been listed and submitted to the county government for apprehension.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Qianjiang Ferry Transferred to Private Management: The Qianjiang River is a crucial transportation route between eastern and western Zhejiang. Since the establishment of the public ferry during the Qing Dynasty, it has been convenient for travelers. Recently, although cement docks have been built on both banks, the official management has suffered from fixed funding, leading to the gradual damage and reduction of ferries and boats due to years of neglect. Passengers often complain. To improve the situation, Shi Ying, the Construction Department Director, first allocated funds to repair ships and then recruited forty gentlemen from Shanghai and Hangzhou, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xuanchu, Wang Zhuzhai, and Wang Xiangquan, to form the Qianjiang Ferry Committee. The plan is to transfer the affairs of the Ferry Bureau to the Committee for management, with a monthly allocation of 4,000 yuan. Any shortfall will be raised by the Committee. It is reported that the provincial government has already decided to invite the committee members to a luncheon soon to discuss the handover and management matters.</p>
<p>Accident on the Xiaoshao Section of the Hangzhou-Shaoxing Highway: A passenger vehicle, No. 51, on the Xiaoshao section of the Hangshao Highway, departed from Wuyunmen at 10 AM the day before yesterday. Near Qianqing, an elderly woman was walking along the road, and the driver, unable to avoid her in time, caused the vehicle to overturn. Nine passengers were injured, the most seriously injured being Ding Zhimei, the manager of the Yutai Rice Shop in Shaoxing, and the driver Zhao Fengshui. The injured were taken to the Xiaoshan Jimin Hospital for treatment by ambulance. According to the doctor's diagnosis, Ding's shoulder blade was broken, and he had a back wound of about six inches. After an emergency injection of a cardiac stimulant, his life was no longer in danger.</p>

<h3>Difficulty in Selecting a Director for the Zhejiang Provincial Library</h3>

<p>Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province</p>
<h3>Joint Office Requests Enrollment of Students</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau received a letter yesterday from the Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province, stating: "It has been found that the office, in order to promote compulsory education, urgently needs to train teachers. A request was submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval to continue running the correspondence department for teacher training. The regulations and the application forms to be filled in during registration have been enclosed, and we hereby request that you widely disseminate this information and designate teachers to participate in the training. Now that the third session of students is enrolling, the office strives for universality to increase efficiency. Therefore, we have formulated enrollment measures and request that your bureau refer to them and implement them: (1) In addition to teachers from various locations voluntarily participating in the training, please also ask the Education Bureau of each county to examine the teachers' levels, determine the quota for each school district, and temporarily assign a number of people to register for participation, so that the supply can better meet the needs. (2) Elementary schools with four or more classrooms should immediately recommend one teacher to participate in research as an incentive for further study. (3) Single-level elementary school principals will be paid by the Education Bureau (12 yuan per school) to participate in the research together, in order to improve educational efficiency. (4) Unqualified elementary school teachers should participate in the training in accordance with the Central University's Order No. 9, otherwise their teaching positions will be terminated. (5) Private school teachers who can be improved should be ordered to participate in the training. (6) The Education Bureau should order several copies for reference in educational guidance. (7) It is best if the Education Bureau subsidizes half of the training fee for participating students (6 yuan per person). The training fee paid by the bureau can be withdrawn from the compulsory education mu tax or the teacher reward fund from the tin foil tax, in accordance with the approved plan."</p>
<p>Education Circle in Wuxian County</p>
<h3>Expressing Dissatisfaction with Director Wu</h3>
<p>The principals of the county-run elementary schools in Wuxian County are alarmed by the Education Bureau's announcement of austerity policies and improper measures. This situation has been brewing until now without a solution. Today, 174 principals have presented the facts and unanimously demanded Wu's removal. They have issued a declaration calling for assistance from all sectors and sent telegrams to the Provincial Government, the Ministry of Education, the Education Department, the County Government, and the County Party Consolidation Committee, requesting rectification. The original telegram is as follows (omitted titles): "We, the undersigned, have investigated that since the establishment of education in Wuxian County in the 29th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, nearly 30 years have passed. The standard of treatment for elementary school teachers has not been improved, while the cost of living has increased tenfold or more. Maintaining a livelihood is precarious. Now, Wu Yaozhang, the director of the Wuxian County Education Bureau, disregards the actual situation and repeatedly reduces education funding. All the measures are also improper. We hereby present the details to Your Excellency: (1) It is impossible to reduce funding. The daily increase in the cost of living and the meager treatment of teachers have been described above. Recently, the National Assembly and the Ministry of Education have repeatedly instructed that the treatment of elementary school teachers should be appropriately increased based on local conditions. However, the director ignores this. The solemn orders of the Ministry are treated as mere formalities. Even if it is said that funding is insufficient and measures must be taken to make up for it, the most urgent task is to improve revenue. However, this is not taken into consideration. Moreover, in recent years, the increase in the bureau's internal expenses is astonishing. Before 1924, the annual bureau expenses were only about 2,000 yuan. Now, it has reached over 30,000 yuan. Is this reasonable? (2) The administrative measures are improper. A. The re-division of school districts is baseless. This time, the eight school districts have been changed to six school districts, which is not based on autonomous regions or public security regions. Instead, the existing school districts have been arbitrarily divided and merged without careful consideration. This lacks caution. B. Elementary school principals should be appointed for a long term, as stated in the Provisional Constitution, in order to encourage dedicated service and improve educational efficiency. Since Principal Jiang Yongyuan took over Pingzhi Elementary School, he established senior grades and reorganized the school into a complete elementary school. The students have flourished, making the school the best in the county. The results are remarkable and widely recognized. However, regardless of his interests, he is transferred elsewhere, and his successor is arbitrarily appointed. Principal Wei Yongyao of Weiting Elementary School and Principal Yan Jiajin of Mudu Elementary School have achieved remarkable results since taking office, and the students have also made daily progress. Now, they are being reorganized into central elementary schools and placing eliminated education committee members. They claim to respect the principals' expertise and appoint them as specialist instructors, but this was neither agreed upon beforehand nor is the title of instructor retained afterwards. As leaders, they treat their work as child's play. Such reversed measures make every principal feel insecure. (3) Disregard for Party discipline. Holding commemorative weeks has long been ordered by the Central Committee. However, the bureau sometimes does not hold them, and the county party headquarters has also heard of this and urged attention. Furthermore, the Central Committee recently ordered that when hiring staff, the Party headquarters should be given priority. When dismissing staff, non-Party members should be given priority. However, the director is the opposite. For example, the principals of Pingzhi and Weiting are all Party members, but they are deliberately transferred away from the schools. Most of the bureau's staff are non-Party members. From this one aspect, it can be seen that his behavior is contrary to the principles and infuriating. In summary, we have listed the facts and respectfully request Your Excellency to review and quickly rectify the situation. We await your orders with utmost urgency. [Signed] Wang Jia and 174 other principals of Ban Huan Elementary School."</p>

<h3>Japanese Goods and Essential Raw Materials</h3>
<h3>Deliberations on Levy of Funds</h3>
<p>Principle Approved by Executive Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Detailed Measures Being Drafted by Committee</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association has repeatedly discussed Japanese industrial raw materials and essential goods in the Design Committee and the Executive Committee meetings. It was felt that a blanket boycott was impossible. Factories in need should report to the meeting, await investigation, and set regulations. Recently, various guilds, such as the cotton cloth industry, have written to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, advocating for the levy of industrial raw materials and essential goods as an industrial fund to prepare for the establishment of factories, which has attracted the attention of the Anti-Japanese Association. It is reported that the Anti-Japanese Association is considering the levy of funds. The news is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Method for Levying Funds - At 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Anti-Japanese Association held an executive committee meeting. The issue of levying an industrial fund was discussed in detail. Members present included Tao Baichuan, Zhang Honghai, Lu Xingzhuang, Hou Dachun, Wang Yansong, Xi Yushu, Wang Hanliang, Yan E'sheng, Hu Fengxiang, Zheng Chengqing, Tang Junsheng, and others. As a result, the principle of levying an industrial fund was approved by vote. However, (1) the method of levy and (2) the method of preservation should be extremely meticulous and thorough. This fund should absolutely not be used for other purposes until a sufficient amount is available to establish factories. Detailed rules were drawn up by Wang Yansong, Zheng Chengqing, Hu Fengxiang, Lu Xingzhuang, and Yan E'sheng as drafting committee members, with Zheng Chengqing as the convener. It is said that this drafting meeting will be held soon.</p>
<p>Separate Measures for Fine Yarn - The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Dyeing and Weaving Federation has resolved to levy a fine yarn factory fund on fine yarn produced by Japanese factories. On the one hand, members of the industry will subscribe for 250,000 yuan to show their support. This case was also discussed by the Executive Committee of the Anti-Japanese Association, which resolved to submit it to the Design Committee for further study in order to decide on its handling. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also replied to the Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce regarding the fine yarn issue, stating that: "We are writing to inform you that we received your letter on the 7th of this month, stating that the fine yarn produced by Chinese yarn factories is very small and insufficient. Therefore, previous efforts to store goods have set separate measures to maintain domestic industry. Please forward this letter to the Anti-Japanese Association to seek relief and separate handling. This matter has been resolved by the fourth Executive Committee meeting of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee in our city. Regarding industrial raw materials and daily necessities that cannot be replaced in fact, standards should first be established. Our Association will send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to promptly establish a Research Committee on Resisting Japanese Goods to study and establish standards in detail, and submit them to our Association for reference, etc. Therefore, the method of maintaining industrial raw materials is being considered by the Anti-Japanese Association, and there is no need to send another letter. The organization of our Chamber's Research Committee on Resisting Japanese Goods will also be completed soon. We are writing to inform you accordingly, and please check and notify us."</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association and Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>

<p>Registrations by the Anti-Japanese Association - The Registration Section of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee has received a total of 700 Japanese goods registration forms. The section is now sorting the forms by type of goods and sending them to the Investigation Section for investigation. Once the investigation is completed and the items match, the association will stamp each item of goods, allowing them to be sold. However, because there are so many registered goods, the investigation cannot be completed immediately. In addition to the resolution by the Standing Committee to have the Investigation Section speed up their work, the investigation will be conducted in order of registration.</p>
<p>Registrations by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce - The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously resolved at a temporary members' meeting that the registration matters of factories and shops that purchase and store Japanese goods and are members of the Chamber's trade associations or shop members should be handled by the Chamber. Once the registration deadline has passed, the Chamber will submit the registration forms to the Anti-Japanese Association for review and certification. As of the 6th of this month, a total of 4,116 registration forms have been issued, with three copies each. A total of 849 copies have been completed and submitted to the Chamber.

<p>Goods Ordered Are Not Allowed to Be Registered - The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Hardware Trade Association that orders cannot be registered, stating that: "We are writing to inform you that we received your letter on the 7th of this month, requesting us to discuss with the Anti-Japanese Association about registering goods that have been ordered but not yet shipped. After investigation, the Anti-Japanese Association's registration of Japanese goods, although divided into two methods before the 14th and before the 24th, refers to those who have paid for and stored the goods. Goods that have been ordered but not yet arrived are not included in the registration. It is really inappropriate to follow your request to forward the itemized list to the Association for registration. As for the goods for which a deposit has been paid but the Japanese factory refuses to refund, the Chinese Soap Industry Trade Association has previously inquired about the method, which has been forwarded to the Anti-Japanese Association and is still awaiting a reply. The situation in your letter is roughly the same as that of the Soap Industry. Your association can follow it in the future if there is a commercial solution."</p>
<p>Continued Seizure of Japanese Goods - The Inspection Section of the Anti-Japanese Association continues to announce the following seizures of Japanese goods as of August 6: (1) August 1, Yongxing Silk Factory in Zhabei seized one bundle of Japanese yarn, a total of ten pieces; (2) August 2, two boats of sugar at Caojiadu, five pieces of cloth from Huamei Company at the South Station, thirteen reams of paper from Puye Company, five pieces of white paper from Jiuji, two pieces of Taolin paper, one package of Feng Yunsheng mosquito coils, seven Zhengqin Qin Zheng Qin Zheng Qin Qin from Wei Shun Ji in one piece, and eight bales of thread from Sanxin Company; (3) August 3, one piece of Kaiyang and one piece of Xiangjun from Tongfengxiang at Caojiadu in West Shanghai, 1,000 bags of rice sold to Taichangxiang by Yongda Company in Pudong, two bags of shark fins from Zhenda Company at the North Station in Zhabei, 199 pieces of colored clothing at Rihui Port, over 400 pieces of film from Xielong Match Hardboard Company, one bundle of thermos bottles from Shen Da Company, four pieces of Fuji paper, six reams of paper from Yubenliang Company; (4) August 4, 275 pieces of yarn and 85 pieces of foreign cloth at Huatong Wharf in Pudong, and four small packages of red thread from Huatong Warehouse; (5) August 5, one Zhengqin Qin Zheng Qin Zheng Qin Qin Qin Qin Zheng Qin Zhengqin from Nanyang Socks Factory in Caojiadu, one Zhengqin Qin Zheng Qin Zhengqin from Yufeng, one piece of Ren from Taichang Shipping Bureau, two dozen thermos bottles from Tianshunsheng at the 16th Pier, one box of flashlights from Dehe, one box of cloth from Huitai, two boxes of scarves from Yongli, and two pairs of thin cloth from Yongfeng; (6) August 6, ten bundles of white pine wood from Yongchang Wood Company in Wujiaochang.</p>
<p>Foreign Communists</p>
<h3>Noulens Couple Judged</h3>
<p>Escorted to Garrison Headquarters for Trial</p>
<p>On June 15 of this year, the Political Department of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works learned that the Third International had sent a top-level Communist member to establish a secret organization in the Concession to direct red bandits throughout China and promote domestic turmoil. They raided the organization at No. 49 Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, and seized 600 important documents from various countries. The leader of the party, a Westerner named Noulens (alias Vanderuyssu, 37 years old) and his wife, Notte (alias Vandercruysu.s, 37 years old), were arrested and sent to the Second Branch of the High Court. They were interrogated several times behind closed doors. At 9:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, Song Yuan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court, along with Judges Ye and Gao, resumed the interrogation. The Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing also telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to send a letter to the High Court requesting their transfer. Therefore, yesterday morning, Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Garrison Headquarters, arrived in court to state the reasons for requesting the transfer. The defendants also hired a lawyer to defend them, stating that the defendants were Swiss citizens and should be managed by the Swiss government. The court ruled that the two defendants should be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for handling the case. Upon hearing the verdict, the defendants declared their appeal. The court then ruled that the appeal in this case was not allowed and adjourned the court at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Another report stated that the Westerners, the Vanderuyssu couple, were charged with propagating communism. After repeated court hearings by the Second Branch of the High Court, they were ordered to be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for trial the day before yesterday. Van was arrested on June 15 at No. 235 Sichuan Road. A bunch of keys was found on his person, which matched the room at No. 49 Nanjing Road. The room was subsequently searched and a large number of communist propaganda materials were seized. Van's wife was arrested at the same location and returned to the police station. Van claimed to be a Belgian national, but the Belgian Consul General did not recognize him. He was then sent to the Second Branch of the High Court for trial. During the continued trial the day before yesterday, Van again claimed to be Swiss, originally named Blye, and listed the surnames of his parents. When questioned by the representative of the Swiss Consulate General, he said that although there was such a surname in Switzerland, it was not known whether it was the person himself and further investigation was needed. The judge then stated that the defendant had failed to produce any physical or testimonial evidence sufficient to prove Swiss citizenship, and ordered him to be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for trial. The defendant's lawyer wanted to appeal, but the judge said that an appeal was not allowed according to regulations and did not grant his request. Van's wife was the one who went on a hunger strike in the Xiamen Road West Prison for a week.</p>
<p>Swiss Protection</p>
<h3>Repercussions of the Arrested Communist Leader</h3>
<p>The various levels of party headquarters in this city are extremely indignant about the Swiss Consul's protection of communists in Shanghai. The positions of the party headquarters in the four districts, the three sub-branches in the ninth district, the five sub-branches in the ninth district, and the six sub-branches in the second district on this case are as follows:</p>
<p>Party Headquarters in the Fourth District - Noulens and his wife, the leaders of the Communist Party's Eastern Department, were arrested in the Public Concession of Shanghai on June 16. Hundreds of important reactionary evidence were seized on the spot, the most of which were related to plans to command the Red Army in combat. When Noulens was arrested, he claimed to be of Belgian nationality, and his wife claimed to be of French nationality. After investigation, it was found that the two criminals had no nationality. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters then sent a letter requesting their transfer. The criminals, knowing that they could not escape punishment, bribed the Swiss Consul in Shanghai to admit that the criminals were Swiss citizens on the 8th of this month. The Presiding Judge Song of the Second Branch of the Special District Court then asked the Swiss representative to present evidence of nationality, but nothing was obtained. Based on this, it is clear that the Swiss Consul accepted a bribe and protected the Communist leaders, disregarding international relations, which is extremely abhorrent. Yesterday, the party headquarters in the fourth district of this city sent a letter warning that if they dared to defend the criminals again, they would be expelled from the country.</p>
<p>Five Sub-Branches in the Ninth District - The sub-branch requested permission from its superiors to convene a general assembly of citizens in Shanghai to discuss severing diplomatic relations with Switzerland for the Swiss Consul's protection of Communist leaders such as Noulens. The document stated: "Noulens and his wife, the leaders of the Communist Party's Third International, are stationed in China and specialize in directing the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangxi, and other provinces to engage in murder and arson. The criminals were arrested in the Public Concession on July 16, and a large number of important Communist documents, totaling over 600, were seized. However, the nationality of the criminals was repeatedly investigated by the police station and the court before it was learned that the criminals were foreigners without nationality. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters requested extradition from the Second Branch of the Special Court. The criminals did not hesitate to bribe the Swiss Consul with a large sum of money. A representative was sent to court on the 8th of this month to admit that the criminals were Swiss citizens. Because there was no evidence, Presiding Judge Song rejected the request and allowed the Garrison Headquarters to extradite them. Unexpectedly, the Swiss Consul, intoxicated by money and willing to harm our 400 million compatriots in China, did not suppress the criminals who brutally murdered unarmed victims in Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces, but dared to protect them. Therefore, we specifically request that superiors allow a general assembly of citizens in Shanghai to be convened to discuss severing diplomatic relations with Switzerland."</p>
<p>Three Sub-Branches in the Ninth District - The sub-branch issued a declaration warning the Swiss Consul in Shanghai against protecting Communists, stating: "Noulens and his wife, the leaders of the Communist Party's Eastern Department, were arrested in the Public Concession and hundreds of important pieces of evidence were seized, including plans to command the Red Army in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei, and methods for using poison gas. After the criminals were arrested, they claimed to be Belgian, and his wife claimed to be French. After the authorities inquired with Belgium and France, there was no such person. The criminals are the leaders of the Red Army who harm China, and have held important positions in the Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent a letter requesting their extradition. The criminals knew that their crimes could not be concealed, so they came up with a far-fetched idea and did not hesitate to bribe the Swiss Consul to come out and protect them. On the 8th of this month, a representative was sent to the court to request extradition and to be handled by the Swiss Consul. Presiding Judge Song found that the criminals had not registered in Switzerland and had no passports, and refused to allow the extradition. According to the previous situation, it is clear that the Swiss Consul is protecting Communists, which is beyond doubt. However, our country is currently carrying out a major campaign to suppress the Reds. The Swiss Consul dares to defy the world and become a public enemy of the entire nation. If he does not repent and intends to interfere again, we will rise up and resist. We hereby declare."</p>
<p>Six Sub-Branches in the Second District - "The disaster of the Communist Party is worse than water and fire, and all countries in the world regard them as public enemies. This time, Noulens and his wife, the leaders of the Communist Party's Eastern Department, were arrested and found to have no nationality. However, the Swiss Consul actually recognized the criminals as Swiss citizens and requested their extradition. The Presiding Judge Song of the Second Branch of the Special District Court then asked the Consul's representative to present evidence, but the extradition was refused because there was no evidence. The criminals had not registered in Switzerland and had no passports, and were clearly stateless. According to international law, anyone who commits a crime in a place without nationality should be handled by the local authorities. After the criminals were arrested, the Consul disregarded international law and dared to come out and protect the Communists, defying the world. All our comrades should fight for it. The comrades of this sub-branch vow to be the government's backup and sever diplomatic relations with that country. We hereby declare."</p>
<h3>Victory Report from the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters received a telegram from Director Liu in Kaifeng stating that after being attacked by our northern and southern armies for days, Shi's entire force retreated along the two routes of Shulu, Hengshui, Wuqiang, and Wuyi towards Dezhou. On the morning and evening of the 2nd, we received telegrams from Vice-Minister of Beiping and Commander-in-Chief Liu Fa of Handan. The following is an excerpt: (1) After the enemy collapsed last night, many were captured by our army. Our northern army's pursuit team has been tracking and pursuing along the Hutuo River, and the cavalry group is intercepting in the Anping and Raoyang areas. The southern divisions are advancing rapidly towards Shulu, Hengshui, Jixian, Nangong, and Zaoqiang to intercept the defeated enemy. I am reporting the current pursuit, Liu Yaoyang kowtows, Branch Seal.</p>
<p>High Court Branch Three and Special Courts Two</p>
<h3>New Presidents and Others to Take Oaths This Morning</h3>
<p>Su Xixun, Sent by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, to Supervise the Oaths</p>
<p>The newly appointed President of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, Liang Renjie, and the President of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai, Ying Shi, as well as all officials of the two courts, including the Chief Prosecutor, the Chief Clerk, and the Judges, will hold an oath-taking ceremony at 10:00 a.m. today in the criminal court of the two courts on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. In addition to inviting various agencies and sectors in this city to attend the ceremony, Su Xixun, the Director of General Affairs of the Judicial Yuan Administrative Department, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and is expected to be present to supervise the oaths this morning.</p>
<h3>The China Bookstore Resumes Business Today</h3>
<p>Quietly Awaiting Official Review According to the Law</p>
<p>The Labor Community Will Hold a Meeting Today to Offer Assistance</p>
<p>Following the general factory of the China Bookstore telegraphing its temporary closure, the Bureau of Social Affairs immediately ordered its resumption. After a resolution by the bookstore’s board of directors, it will comply with the order and resume operations today, quietly awaiting review. The labor union has already submitted its demands regarding compensation and benefits. The local labor community will hold a meeting today to discuss assistance. The various developments of yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Notice of Reopening: The China Bookstore issued a notice that it would resume normal operations starting today, in compliance with orders. On the sixth of this month, the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union sent a letter requesting an early dismissal of one and a half hours on the afternoon of the seventh for a meeting. Our bookstore responded with a letter at 10:00 AM on the seventh, inquiring about the scope. The union replied with a letter, and then at 3:00 PM, a large group of people came to the bookstore, blocked the front and back doors of the general factory, and forcibly drove employees from their workplaces to hold a meeting in an open space. These events were reported in a telegram on the evening of the seventh. On the eighth, representatives from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce came to investigate and verify the state of chaos and losses. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs instructed that normal operations must resume tomorrow, quietly awaiting review by the bureau. Our bookstore immediately convened a board meeting and decided that, starting from Monday, the tenth of this month, normal operations would resume. This notice is hereby issued for public awareness.</p>
<p>The Union's Attitude: Chen Xuanren, the executive director of the Municipal Publishing Industry Union, told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday that the China Bookstore's recent shutdown and its attempts to disguise the situation were the most clumsy attempts to undermine the labor movement. Therefore, our union takes a dim view of the bookstore's closure, as we know that it is not a direct response to the union, but rather a tactic to delay improving the terms of employment. Our union has seen through their strategy and has decided to let the closure take its course while focusing on negotiating for better terms of employment, seeking a resolution within three days. If the bookstore can fully understand the true meaning of labor-management cooperation, it should not lead to unexpected disputes. Otherwise, even if the bookstore is determined to close for three months, our union is prepared and can handle it with ease. Their efforts will only prove to be futile.</p>
<p>Union Meeting: More than twenty labor unions, including municipal postal, utilities, letterpress printing, sauce, and cigarette industries, have initiated a representative assembly to assist the publishing industry, sending a notice to all labor unions stating: The China Bookstore branch of the Publishing Industry Union formally established its branch office on August 8, with representatives from party and government agencies attending to provide guidance. The meeting was orderly. However, the bookstore's management has resorted to the base and cunning tactics of the past, disrupting the labor movement by unilaterally suspending operations to assert its dominance. Our unions believe that this action by the China Bookstore's management not only affects the livelihoods of the bookstore's workers but also poses a threat to the entire labor movement. If it is not severely punished, the entire labor movement will be destroyed. We are all in the same boat and cannot shirk our responsibility. We have scheduled a joint meeting at the Postal Workers' Union at 3:00 PM on August 10 to discuss countermeasures. We hope that you will send representatives to attend on time.</p>
<p>Donations for Assistance: The Commerce Press branch of the Publishing Industry Union held a joint meeting of executives and group leaders at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the China Bookstore's management's oppression of labor. It was decided that, in addition to unanimously supporting the Publishing Industry Union, all members, more than forty people, would voluntarily donate one day's wages to help the China Bookstore's employees.</p>

<p>It is found that China's road construction had only 1,500 miles in the tenth year of the Republic of China, but as of this year, it has 35,000 miles. In ten years, it has increased more than twenty times. The association’s promotion has indeed accounted for a large part. The twenty-first year of the Republic of China will usher in a new era of road construction. Therefore, it is firmly believed that the general public will enthusiastically participate in this unprecedented event, supporting the old and leading the young. It is expected that on the opening day, representatives from the north and south will come from more than twenty provinces across the country, and it will be a scene of tens of thousands of people leaving their homes and horses and carriages like clouds, presenting an unprecedented grand scene on the deserted Avenue Petain.</p>

<p>Coal Industry</p>
<p>Please Convene a National Coal Mine Merchants Conference</p>
<p>To Determine National Coal Policy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association yesterday presented to the Executive Yuan, stating: In order to solve the national coal plan, please convene a conference. In recent years, our coal and coke merchants have been suffering due to the poor environment, while foreign coal has taken the opportunity to move in and gradually dominate transportation and sales, controlling the key to manipulation. The life of our country's transportation and industry has already been placed in the hands of foreign coal. As for the leakage of economic benefits, it is becoming more and more serious, and it is unbearable to recall. I respectfully read the Premier's industrial plan, in which the use of coal and the plugging of leaks are already in the eyes of all our citizens who can read. The appeals of the Shanghai coal merchants have also long been heard by the general public. However, since the establishment of the National Government five years ago, no far-sighted plan or fact of development has been made for this major coal mining issue. Therefore, the Shanghai coal merchants are unwilling to remain silent and offer their humble opinions. It is found that the Ministry of Industry previously held an industrial conference. Now, please follow the example to determine the national coal policy. However, coal merchants and miners have a close relationship with railway transportation. I respectfully request your Yuan to order the three ministries of industry, transportation, and railway to jointly convene a national conference of coal merchants and miners to plan, develop, and transport and sell national coal, in order to plug leaks and enrich the country. The above-mentioned proposals are respectfully requested to be adopted and implemented by your Yuan. The Shanghai coal merchants will do their best to serve the country. I respectfully present this to the Executive Yuan of the National Government.</p>

<h3>Liuhe Flood Relief Association Begging Telegram</h3>
<p>To the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Chinese Jisheng Association, the Red Cross Society, the National Flood Relief Association, the Jiangsu Relief Committee, the Lianyi Charity Society, various charity halls, all philanthropists, fathers and elders across the country, and all newspapers: Heaven has punished us in Liuhe. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, after a great drought that turned the entire territory into red land, we have been hit by a flood unseen in more than eighty years. The county is bordered by mountains in the northwest near Anhui and by the river in the southeast. The Chu River runs through the middle, flowing from west to east, and is the only drainage channel. Its capacity is originally narrow and has been silted up due to disrepair. Suddenly, the river rose in the last month and continued for more than ten days, day and night, with heavy rain like pouring water. Mountain floods poured down, and the river tide rose again, causing overflowing in all directions. Ninety-nine percent of the dikes, fields, and farmlands on the east, west, and south sides were breached and completely submerged. The lower-lying farmlands were also affected by the disaster as much as the diked fields. When the flood was at its highest, the drowned population, livestock, and grain (estimated at hundreds of thousands of stones) and the materials of collapsed houses (estimated at more than 30,000) were swept downstream, a sight that was frightening. According to rough estimates, the total area of ​​disaster-stricken farmland is more than 400,000 mu, and more than 300 large and small dikes were broken and submerged, with countless breaches, exceeding half of the total farmland in the county. The remaining small number of farmlands that were least affected were also more than half-affected. More than 100,000 people are displaced, without shelter or livelihood. The direct and indirect losses to the entire county's 360,000 people are unavoidable. Looking up, everything has become a lake. Smoke has stopped, and there is no sound of chickens and dogs. Patrol boats observe that on the small mounds and hills, disaster victims gather like flies and ants, calling out in the wilderness. The city is several feet deep in water. When entering and exiting the city gates, boatmen must crawl to avoid hitting obstacles. According to the old farmers, the flood is worse than that of the late Qing Daoguang years. The surviving people, who have just suffered from a rare drought, have been hit by this disaster again, and their lives are unbearable. Currently, the flood has not receded, and even if it does recede slightly, it will be extremely slow. Counting the seasons, there is no possibility of replanting autumn grain. The hope for the future is gone, and it is difficult to prolong the current breath. In addition to trying our best to scrape together and temporarily prepare coarse grains locally and distribute them selectively to extend their lives, the county is small and the people are poor, the disaster is heavy, and the area is wide. It is difficult to support the situation even for a moment. The situation is extremely critical. We appeal to all charitable organizations and philanthropists to treat everyone equally, send personnel to the county day and night with donations to provide emergency relief, so that the dying can be spared for a moment and struggle again. We are ready to wait for your urgent orders. The Liuhe County Flood Relief Committee kowtows.</p>
<h3>Dongtai Compatriots Discuss Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>Dongtai compatriots in Shanghai received a telegram from the Dongtai County Party, Business, Agriculture, and Education groups, stating that the three dams of Gaoyou were opened at the same time, and the entire county was turned into a swamp. Houses and property were washed away, and the lives of 1.3 million people were in critical danger. We hope to quickly ask various relief associations to release emergency relief and continue to send details by letter. Therefore, an emergency meeting was held at the Youth Association last night. Those who attended included Xia Hucen, Li Baosheng, Yang Zihuo, Qian Shusheng, Meng Yabo, Shi Bohang, Ge Gongzhen, Ge Xianglan, Lu Yuheng, Xiao Zixiang, Zhou Shaoyuan, Xie Yisong, Qian Baoyuan, and Ms. Ge Shao Yi, Ms. Yuan Suzhen, and dozens of others. At the meeting, the compatriots reported the private information they had obtained, and it was resolved to organize a committee. Xia Hucen, Li Baosheng, Yang Zihuo, Qian Shusheng, Shi Bohang, Lu Yuheng, and Ge Gongzhen were publicly elected as committee members to contact various charitable organizations and request that the legal groups in Beijing and the countryside report on the disaster situation and send donation lists at any time, and actively raise funds separately. The meeting adjourned until late at night.</p>
<h3>Anhui Compatriots Organize Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, due to the severe flood disaster in their province, specially convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. Those who attended included Xu Shiying, Li Weihou, Li Cishan, Guan Yunong, Xu Jingren, Wang Yuchen, Liu Zuwang, Li Zhenya, and fifty other people. Xu Jingren was publicly elected as chairman, and he reported that the disaster situation in the province was particularly serious compared to other provinces in the country. Forty-one counties have sent letters and telegrams requesting relief. He asked fellow-provincials to rise up quickly to provide relief in order to save the dying disaster victims. The discussion on the measures was very detailed, as were other cases. The resolutions were as follows: (1) In accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Association’s Articles of Association regarding special organizations, the Anhui Flood Relief Association in Shanghai was established. (2) The relief measures are divided into three steps: emergency relief, work relief, and disaster prevention. The association should actively raise funds, first release emergency relief, and make suggestions to the government on the second and third items for effective implementation. (3) All directors and supervisors will be members of the association, and fellow-provincial organizations in Shanghai will be asked to recommend three to five representatives or those with prestige in their hometowns to participate as members to expand the organization. A general meeting will be held on August 16 to elect a director in charge of standing affairs. (4) Since the fields and houses in various counties have been completely washed away, another telegram will be sent to the National Government and the Provincial Government requesting the immediate suspension of the Weiwei field donations to comfort the survivors. (5) A telegram will be sent to the Relief Committee requesting that 2 million yuan be allocated from the salt surplus treasury bills for emergency relief in Anhui Province as soon as possible to save the dying disaster victims in forty counties. (6) Please ask the Flood Relief Associations of Shanghai and various charitable organizations to provide immediate relief. (7) Formulate investigation forms and send them to various counties to fill in the disaster situation for future reference. (8) The Anhui Secondary School Joint Association opposes He Lu, who is not trustworthy, as the president of Anhui University. A telegram will be sent to the Provincial Government requesting a suitable successor from Anhui. (9) Wuyuan County sent a letter reporting that bandits were rampant. Please provide assistance. A telegram was sent to the Provincial Government requesting that troops be sent to suppress them. (10) Each captain of the fourth requisition should quickly collect the register and set a date for a captains' meeting to compare scores. (11) Li Weihou reported on contacting Li Bolao regarding the situation of the Anhui Hall and hoped to use it for permanent public welfare purposes. (12) The Anhui Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and Finance replied that the case of reducing the surtax in Guichi County has been forwarded to the county for investigation. A telegram was sent to the Anhui Provincial Government, stating: To Chairman Chen of the Anhui Provincial Government, the representatives of various counties in northern Anhui requested exemption from the Weitian donation. The association has previously reported the Gengdai telegram, which detailed the proof of the ownership of Weitian by the people and the determination of property rights. Please cancel the levy to relieve the people's difficulties and invite inspection and verification. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance replied that it had telegraphed the Anhui Official Property Reclamation Bureau to verify and report for verification, etc. Now, the counties along the Yangtze River and Huai River in Anhui Province have all been turned into swamps. The fields and houses have been washed away, the tombs have become ruins, the people have been injured and killed, and saving the dead is not enough. How can we care about the Dingfu and the so-called Weitian donation that the officials are exhaustively searching for? Even if the flood recedes, the sea and the fields will change, and the people will be displaced. There will be no clothes or food, and the eyes will be full of desolation. Even if the government wants to impose harsh taxes, where can it find the difficult refugees who have fled the disaster and force them to pay fees? This is unbearable. It is hoped that the government will uphold the virtue of cherishing life and issue a clear order to permanently exempt this deformed donation, so that the people can recuperate and breathe a little. On behalf of the dying people in Anhui who have suffered from the disaster, we ask for your orders and hope that you will immediately abolish the collection agency and send a swift reply. The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai kowtows. Qing.</p>
<h3>Hubei Native Association Held Disaster Relief Fundraising Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Disaster Area Spans Over Forty Counties</p>
<p>Millions of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>The Hubei Native Association in Shanghai has been receiving telegrams from the Hubei Provincial Government's Hubei Flood Disaster Relief Committee for days, and especially held an emergency meeting at its association's location on South Wuxi Road yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM.

After the formalities were observed, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and read the telegrams, roughly stating that since the beginning of summer, Hubei Province has been experiencing incessant rain, causing flash floods and submerging people, livestock, fields, and homes beyond calculation. The disaster area has now reached over forty counties, with over millions of disaster victims. In Wuhan alone, approximately two hundred thousand people are homeless and without food. Although the Disaster Relief Committee is trying to provide relief, it's like adding a cup of water to a cartload of burning firewood, and the future is long. If post-disaster planning is not addressed, there will be no survivors. It is hoped that everyone present will devise effective methods to provide rescue. Ming Runshen rose and said that since the disaster situation is so severe, a slight delay will render assistance ineffective. All the gentlemen present today are benevolent and enthusiastic about charity. He requested that everyone donate on the spot to the best of their ability. Gao Jianqing said that rescuing disaster victims is an immeasurable act of merit. Even a dollar is not too little, and ten thousand dollars is not too much. In short, donating one more dollar means saving one more life. He hoped for generous donations to save more disaster victims. The chairman immediately put the proposals of the two gentlemen to a vote, which was unanimously approved. Wang Shao Cheng took the lead in pledging two thousand yuan. Liu Wanqing, Liu Renshi, Kun Yongqing, and Luo Buzhou each pledged one thousand yuan. Wang Xiaozhai and Xiao Shouzhi each pledged six hundred yuan. Chang Caichen pledged five hundred yuan.

It was decided to organize the Hubei Native Association in Shanghai Flood Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee, and Liu Renshi, Liu Wanqing, Ming Runshen, Gao Jianqing, Yi Nanzhen, Lu Xingjie, and Zhang Jitang were publicly elected as working committee members. Du Baiqing and Sun Songnian were authorized to handle the donation collection and remittance matters. This was unanimously approved. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>French Concession Revises Corpse Examination Location</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works Hospital</p>
<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>The examination of corpses in cases of fatalities within the French Concession used to be handled during the time of the Mixed Court by detectives dispatched by the police station, who would transport the corpses to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall examination office at the intersection of Ningbo Road and the East Water and Fire Street. Then, the Criminal Division or the Traffic Division of the General Patrol Bureau would report to the judge of the Mixed Court for an inspection. In cases of suspicious corpses that could not be immediately examined, Western doctors would be sent for a detailed examination, or the corpses would be transported by vehicle to the small infirmary of the hospital established by the Bureau of Public Works in Lujiawan for autopsy. Afterward, the doctors would issue an examination report to the Mixed Court for review. Now that the Mixed Court has been taken back by the Chinese government and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court have been established, the court has revised the procedures for corpse examination. The police station is instructed to transport the corpses by vehicle to the small infirmary of the Bureau of Public Works Hospital at the intersection of Qiqi Road and Xujiahui Road, and report to the court's prosecutor for examination in conjunction with a forensic doctor. The hospital has already notified the police station, and the new procedures will be implemented starting today.</p>
<p>Taiwanese Compatriots</p>
<h3>Commemorative Service for Chiang Wei-shui Scheduled</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Office for the Memorial Service for Mr. Chiang Wei-shui, a pioneer of the Taiwan People's Liberation Movement, announced that Mr. Chiang Wei-shui of Taiwan led the Taiwanese people in revolutionary movements for nearly twenty years, with the aim of seeking freedom and equality for the people. During these twenty years, he strived for the revolution with an indomitable spirit. Despite suffering oppression and imprisonment by the Japanese imperialists, he never faltered. Mr. Chiang's revolutionary spirit should be forever immortalized in the history of the Taiwanese revolution. Unexpectedly, the tragic news arrived that he passed away at 7:30 AM on August 5th of this year in Taiwan. The Taiwanese people have lost a great leader, and their grief is immense. All comrades, both domestic and foreign, who support the revolution, will undoubtedly share in this deep sorrow. Therefore, we have decided to hold a memorial service for Mr. Chiang on the morning of the 14th of this month at 9:00 AM at the Southeast Medical College in the Shanghai Military Camp in the South City of Shanghai. We sincerely hope that all our compatriots, comrades, and various organizations and institutions will honor us with their presence or send representatives to participate in the memorial service to comfort the pioneer and encourage those who follow. This is our sincere prayer. August 8th, the 20th year of the Republic of China. Please send condolences to the Preparatory Office, No. 133 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, telephone 19151, Overseas Chinese Hospital.</p>
<h3>Business Tax Still Levied on Off-Site Wholesale Outlets</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating that business tax should still be levied on off-site wholesale outlets, and forwarded the letter to the Science Instrument Hall. The direct reply, dated July 15, stated that it had received a letter stating that if manufactured goods have left the manufacturing site and are sold in established sales outlets, please exempt them from additional sales business tax. The association immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions. Now, the Ministry's Jiang Dai Dian Fu letter No. 6752 states: "The deletion of the telegraph is noted. According to Article 1 of the Business Tax Law, the nature of the business tax is that it is collected from businesses operating in cities within various provinces and does not adhere to the principle of one tax per item. For the convenience of both tax collection and tax payment, the Ministry has issued five interpretation methods for various provincial governments to follow. Previously, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments submitted the business tax rate table for manufacturing industries, and the Qingdao municipal government submitted the business tax regulations to the Ministry. After detailed review and approval, these were submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing. According to the previous telegram, it should still be handled in accordance with the Ministry's Fu letter No. 5675. The manufacturing industry business tax rate tables for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Qingdao Municipal Business Tax Collection Regulations are enclosed for reference. Please forward these to the relevant parties for their information." It was noted that Article 12 of the Qingdao Municipal Business Tax Collection Regulations stipulates that if the manufacturing industry directly sells its manufactured goods at its manufacturing location, regardless of whether it is wholesale or retail, only the manufacturing industry's business tax is levied, and the sales industry's business tax is not levied. However, if it leaves the manufacturing location and establishes another location for sales, regardless of whether it is the same factory owner or the same brand as the original manufacturing plant, the sales industry's business tax is levied, and the manufacturing industry's business tax is not levied. In addition to the various tables and examples, which the association will not attach separately, we are hereby forwarding the telegram for your information.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I read a news item in the Local News column of today's newspaper entitled "Public Bus in Shanghai South Causes Accident." The facts are not consistent with the actual situation. At 9:15 a.m. yesterday, a downbound public bus No. 19 of Route 3 of our company, driven by driver Wu Xiukun, arrived at the Xin Xiaodongmen bus stop. When passengers were about to get off, a armored silver transport vehicle of the China Reclamation and Banking Corporation drove out diagonally from the left rear, intending to cross our company's vehicle. Seeing the front vehicle driving, they panicked and the rear right wheel of the vehicle rubbed against the left front wheel and wing plate of our company's vehicle. The silver transport vehicle was also equipped with armor, which was heavy on top and light on the bottom, and overturned into the tram track. The local French police and the nearest smoke shop eyewitnessed and proved that the silver transport driver was driving illegally. The French police station's vehicle office sent the No. 41 French police chief to the scene of the accident, used a tape measure to measure the road surface, and surveyed the road according to the road traffic regulations. After reporting to the Xiaodongmen French police station for preliminary questioning, it was also designated that the fault lay with the other party. The responsibility for the accident should be fully borne by the driver of the Reclamation and Banking Corporation. In addition to estimating the repair costs of the damaged wings and the loss of business interruption, a list was prepared and a request for compensation from the other party will be submitted at 9 a.m. tomorrow (i.e., Monday) at the French police station's general vehicle office. It is hereby sent a letter requesting your newspaper to promptly correct the situation and avoid confusion. This is sincerely felt. To the Editor-in-Chief (Local News Column Editorial Department) of Shen Bao, Shanghai South Public Bus Company, August 9.</p>

<h3>Proposed Request for Expedited Establishment of Automobile Factories and Self-Manufacturing of Tires, and Adoption of Gasoline Consultation Letter</h3>
<p>Proposer Gu Zaizhen</p>
<p>Since the Road Association advocated road construction for more than ten years, the call for road construction has spread throughout the country. According to recent surveys, the roads completed in various provinces have exceeded 110,000 miles. The association's advocacy deserves admiration. However, as roads increase year by year, transportation also becomes more convenient. In the past, land transportation involved sedan chairs, small carts, donkey carts, and northern large carts. Now, these various vehicles have become outdated. Therefore, current transportation includes rickshaws, horse-drawn carriages, bicycles, automobiles, and trams. Among these, automobiles are the most convenient and fastest. As a result, rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages have been affected. Moreover, the roads built in various provinces recently, some of which are called automobile roads, and the asphalt expressways in major cities, are restricted to automobile traffic to prevent damage to the road surface. This indirectly promotes automobiles. As humans become more civilized and materials evolve, this is a natural trend. In recent times, social morals have declined, and people have become more extravagant. From high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants to vendors and laborers, they all take pride in riding in automobiles but are ashamed of not being able to manufacture them themselves. As a result, building one more road in the country is like selling a few more cars for foreigners. It is heartbreaking to say. Currently, foreign automobiles are sold in China, not only in major commercial ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Hankou, and provincial capitals, but also in remote areas where roads are accessible. Taking the capital city as an example, there are already more than 1,100 automobiles. If we count the automobiles in the whole country, there should be at least 100,000. In addition, tires, gasoline, and accessories are all imported. Even the tires manufactured by overseas Chinese merchants must come from the Dutch East Indies. According to a recent survey, the import report of the Jianghai Customs last year shows that the value of automobiles, gasoline, and accessories imported from foreign countries is about 20 million yuan. This only refers to Shanghai. The goods imported through the customs of Guangdong, Fujian, and Tianjin are not included. The amount of money exported annually in the whole country is staggering. If we do not catch up quickly and establish factories for self-manufacturing, not only will our economic rights be lost, but also if national defense becomes urgent, the sources of automobiles, gasoline, and tires will be cut off. There may be cars without tires, or tires without gasoline. The transportation of soldiers and food will be hampered, and this alone would be enough to lead to the downfall of the country. Automobiles are vehicles for transporting goods in peacetime, but they can also be converted into armored vehicles for carrying cannons in wartime. Therefore, if automobiles can be self-manufactured, their sizes and styles can be specified, and armor and load-bearing capacity can be planned in advance. This way, the cars sold in peacetime can be used as armored vehicles in wartime. With prior planning and preparation, we will not be caught unprepared in times of war. Moreover, in the face of many soldiers and bandits, it is impossible to reduce the number of soldiers, and it is also impossible to eliminate the bandits. Borrowing money and consuming funds to support this source of chaos, why not transform soldiers into workers and build automobile factories, turning non-production into production? With more factories, there will be fewer vagrants, and how can they be driven to take risks and become soldiers and bandits? Therefore, the construction of automobile factories cannot be delayed. The first thing to do when building a factory is to raise huge sums of money. At a time when the country is facing frequent troubles, it is not easy to talk about raising money. Whether it is issuing public bonds, attracting corporate stocks, or investing by Chinese merchants, if the government does not encourage and promote it, I am afraid there will never be a day of success. I believe that at the beginning of the trial operation of the automobile factory, it can be temporarily attached to the existing ordnance factories in various places. The scale should be small. After the products have achieved some success, it can be expanded so that the expenses will not be wasted and can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, the current ordnance factories in various places, such as Shanghai, Hanyang, Dezhou, Guangzhou, Gongxian, and Liaoyang, are large in scale, well-equipped, and have relatively abundant talent. Design, drawing, and manufacturing can be mutually used. If there are parts that cannot be self-manufactured, foreign engineers can be hired to manufacture them, and graduates of mechanical engineering from home and abroad can be recruited, or experienced craftsmen and clerks in the factory can be trained to work and taught other manufacturing and driving skills in their spare time. After the automobile parts can be completely self-manufactured, then the foreign engineers can be dismissed. As for the materials for car manufacturing, if China has its own products, all domestic products should be used to prevent the loss of economic rights and unemployment. Enriching the country and strengthening the people should be based on this. However, the cost of cars initially manufactured in China may be higher, resulting in few buyers. Even if there are durable, beautiful, and durable cars, I am afraid no one will care. However, if the government can handle it properly, there will be no shortage of cars without sales. At the beginning of the sale of Chinese-made cars, they should be sold at cost price and provide convenience for those who speak to order and transport. Preferential treatment should be given for paying taxes and obtaining licenses. On the one hand, the government should order its subordinate agencies to purchase and use them uniformly. In this way, Chinese cars will sell themselves without being sold. On the other hand, merchants should be encouraged to set up factories to imitate. With more factories and better products, strive for perfection. I think that in a few years, Chinese cars will not be difficult to surpass those in Europe and America.</p>
<p>The operation of automobiles depends entirely on tires. The raw materials for tire manufacturing depend on rubber. The tires manufactured by the Chen Jiageng Company of our country's overseas Chinese merchants include automobile tires, rickshaw tires, and bicycle tires. The quality is excellent, and the sales are wide. However, the tires manufactured by overseas Chinese merchants still need to come from the Dutch East Indies. It is very convenient to import them to our country in peacetime, but if diplomatic relations are severed, the impact on transportation will be significant. Moreover, rubber raw materials are not produced domestically. Fujian and Guangdong in our country are close to the tropics and should try to plant them. On the one hand, the government should establish rubber experiment stations to study cultivation, seed selection, and glue making. On the other hand, overseas Chinese should be encouraged to set up factories in the mainland to manufacture them themselves. It is not too late to prepare for a rainy day.</p>
<p>Gasoline is refined from petroleum. In the central part of Sichuan, the Shandan and Jiuquan of Gansu, the Dihua, Turpan, Yanqi of Xinjiang, the Yanken and Fushi in the northern part of Shaanxi, and the Zhenba County in the southern part of Shaanxi, petroleum springs out everywhere and is rich in storage. Moreover, the petroleum in Shaanxi was once deeply excavated, but it was interrupted because it was not completely penetrated and the oil quality did not spring up, and transportation was inconvenient. It is a pity. In recent years, the sales of gasoline, kerosene, and lubricating oil have become more and more extensive. In Shanghai alone, the amount of the above three types of oil imported last year exceeded 20 million gallons. If we count the amount of oil imported in the whole country, it is more than this number. At this time of petroleum , our country has no oil production. The price of oil is entirely manipulated by foreigners. Once the oil price increases sharply and foreign goods do not come, our country has no oil that can be used as a substitute for petroleum. Although it is expensive, it must be purchased and used. Losing power and harming profits, nothing is more serious than this. We should take this time to find ways to explore and refine them, especially in the oil-producing areas, and open up more roads so that the oil produced in the oil-producing areas can be transported to all parts of the country.</p>
<p>The above points are all urgent matters at present, and they are closely related to the promotion of road construction. If they can be implemented, the benefits of building a road can be reaped. The country is fortunate, and the society is fortunate. Is it appropriate? I respectfully await your decision.</p>

<p>The Peculiar Habit of Buying Old Prisons</p>
<p>Buying land and houses is the most reliable way to make money in modern times. Of course, everyone likes it. However, the most interesting thing is that Mr. Thomas Oakley, a wealthy man from Luton, England, has the peculiar habit of buying abandoned old prisons. Previously, he had already bought prisons in Gosport, Derby, and Worcester. Recently, he spent £4,150 to buy Knutsford Jail in Cheshire. He plans to make the most of it and turn it into a hostel for coachmen. The price is extremely low. Each person only needs to pay three shillings a day to sleep and bathe, and breakfast is included. All the prison cells have been completely converted into bedrooms with 300 good beds. It can accommodate 300 people every night. There is a cement-paved open space of three acres in the prison, which can be used by coachmen to park empty cars. Three or four hundred cars can be accommodated. The prison has a total base of five acres and is located on the main road from London to Liverpool and Manchester. It is very suitable to be converted into a hostel for coachmen.</p>
<p>In addition to liking to buy old prisons, Mr. Wu has also bought a light cruiser, four airfields, a ditch in the Crystal Palace, part of the Grenagh Ammunition Factory, six or seven wineries, several cotton mills, and fourteen country mansions. This gentleman is truly a strange person.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying's Tragic Report</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, it has been raining continuously, and mountain floods have broken out. The size of the disaster area is unprecedented. The 62nd issue of this newspaper's pictorial weekly has published photos of floods in various places, and has also written a series of flood reviews every day to promote them. Leaders from all walks of life in this port recently launched the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces. On the afternoon of the 6th, Xu Shiying reported on the disaster situation in various provinces during a discussion on fundraising methods at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. He beat his chest and stamped his feet, and shouted loudly, saying that there were already 16 provinces in the disaster area, with a population of more than 50 million. I am from Anhui. According to reports from my hometown, more than a dozen counties along the Huai River, such as Tianchang, Wuhe, Fuyang, and Mengcheng, are either located in low-lying areas and prone to flooding, or mountain floods have broken out and embankments have collapsed. Crops and livestock were destroyed, and the old and young were drowned. In Huoqiu, more than 8,000 people drowned in one day. In Fuyang County alone, more than 50,000 households were submerged. Guangjiwei in Anqing and Taoxingwei in Xuancheng are the most productive rice areas. Now they have also collapsed. Taihe, Qiupu, and Quanjiao counties have all become swamps. Other provinces such as Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong have all suffered from floods. Taking the recent capital as an example, when I went to Beijing the other day, I passed Yaohuamen and saw groups of disaster victims gathered on the higher ground on both sides of the railway. The tragic situation was heartbreaking to see. Recently, there has been a focus on nationalism, and all 400 million people are called compatriots. I hope that you will regard the disaster-stricken compatriots as your own fathers, brothers, sons, sisters, and aunts, and donate generously to help them, which will bring endless blessings. The listeners were all moved.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Since the Wanbaoshan incident, the Japanese have been extensively disseminating information, and everyone knows it. Recently, the Japanese Consulate in this port has been sending wireless telegraphs to Fuzhou, Hankou, Beiping, and other places more than ten times a day. Each time, it must contain more than a hundred words, and they are all secret words composed of Roman characters, so it is difficult to understand their meaning. The registration number for each telegram is Riyoji. This is the exclusive registration number of the Japanese Consulate. According to a gentleman at the wireless telegraph station, this earns them no less than 100 gold every day. However, the Japanese are treacherous and wish that the people of the country would pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about the Zhu Jing Child Murder Case</h3>
<p>— Cailiang</p>
<p>A guest from Jinshan once told me in detail about the recent child murder case that occurred in that place. I have selected those that have not been disclosed by various newspapers and recorded them for readers.</p>
<p>Rampant Debauchery The main protagonist in this case, Wang Tao, was originally a concubine who had been abandoned by a certain surname in Pinghu. Although she is old, her charm has not diminished. At first, she had an affair with Wang Yutian, the accountant of the house, and they were extremely intimate. Everything that Yutian enjoyed, no matter how expensive, she would not hesitate. They lived together like husband and wife. Then, after a long time, their love faded, and they often quarreled. Just then, a plasterer named Xia Aqing came to her house. He worked diligently, and his appearance was far better than Wang Yutian's, so he gained Wang Tao's trust. Gradually, a love triangle formed. Soon, her son Diqing's reputation spread far and wide, and he was very angry. He wanted to get rid of Xia and Wang quickly. Unexpectedly, the secret was not kept, and his mother heard about it. So, she summoned him to kill him. As the saying goes, "Adultery leads to murder." This incident proves it.</p>
<p>Running Away Due to Lost Love Since Diqing's murder was instigated by his mother, Xia Aqing and Xiaomama and others were all accomplices in the case. As for Yutian, although he was not at the scene, it is difficult to escape the suspicion of being an accomplice. Therefore, Yutian packed his bags and fled the day after the incident, and there has been no news of him so far. Even his family does not know where he lives. Now, in order to clarify the truth, the official authorities have stepped up their efforts to arrest him. I think the detectives are out looking for him, and there will be a day when the truth comes out.</p>
<p>Confession in Prison Wang Tao has been imprisoned and has suffered a lot. Whenever someone asks her about the past, she sheds tears. One day, a maid from her family came to visit her in prison. She suddenly looked pitiful and cried, "I really didn't want to kill my son. I was forced by the environment. I know I'm guilty, but I still want to ask Shao Nian Nai (her daughter-in-law) to forgive me." The maid heard this and agreed. From this, we know that Mencius's theory of the goodness of human nature is not without basis. But it is too late to regret it now that her conscience has been discovered.</p>
<p>Interesting Stories about the Play Since this case came out, people have been talking about it. The theaters in various places, which are good at speculation, have also regarded it as good material for playwriting. The Jin Yi Public Education Center recently rehearsed this play. The local scenery is particularly interesting. When the play was performed to the point where Wang Tao and others strangled Wang Diqing with a belt, a young woman suddenly made a strange sound and pointed and scolded the people in the play. At that time, the audience was puzzled and the whole hall was in an uproar. After inquiry, it was found that the woman was Diqing's widow. She was saddened by the scene and her eyebrows stood on end. The depth of the drama's ability to move people can be seen from this. Soon, the authorities ordered the play to be stopped because it was feared that it would cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Newspapers Exclusively for Children to Read</h3>
<p>— Sheng Han</p>
<p>In China, there are already many books and magazines published exclusively for children to read. However, there are hardly any newspapers exclusively for children to read.</p>
<p>The importance of current affairs education has been recognized by educators in general. However, most ordinary newspapers are written in classical Chinese, and the content is very difficult to understand. It is really not suitable for guiding children to study current affairs. And there are no newspapers exclusively for children to read, so educators in general regard it as a pity.</p>
<p>On June 1st last year, education colleagues from various places jointly created a "Children's Times." Their purpose is to "cultivate children's reading habits, enrich children's common sense, increase children's reading ability, encourage children's creative interest, and promote children's education." The newspaper is published every three days. It has now been published to issue 144. A small newspaper has sold to more than 20 provinces, and many schools in Japan, Annam, and Nanyang have subscribed to it. It is indeed China's only children's newspaper, and it is praised by many children's educators and children's writers. For example, Mr. Chen Heqin said, "The Children's Times can be said to be a unique work in China's recent publishing industry. It is worthy of attention by today's educators. There are many children's publications published in China now, but there are not many newspapers exclusively for children to read." Mr. Zhao Jingshen said, "The Children's Times" is very well edited. It is short and concise, so that children can acquire international news knowledge in the shortest time. It is indeed the first children's newspaper in modern times." Mr. Feng Zikai said, "The Children's Times. All the children in my family love to read it very much. Every time a new issue is obtained, they gather to watch it, as if they have obtained a treasure."</p>
<p>The editing style and printing format of the newspaper are very novel. The content is divided into three parts: "current affairs," "common sense," and "literature and art." The description of current affairs focuses on storytelling and systematization. The "Q&amp;A" column is specially set up for common sense. Children can write to ask for answers if they have any difficult questions. The "Children's Garden" column is specially set up for literature and art to publish children's works. The text is entirely in vernacular Chinese, which is suitable for the level of students in the middle and high grades of elementary school. Regardless of text or pictures, the material is based on being interesting in principle, which is very suitable for children's psychology.</p>
<p>They are seeking convenience for education and happiness for children, and are not of a business nature, so the newspaper fee is very low. This is indeed a treasure for children.</p>

<h3>Memories of Escaping the Summer Heat in West Lake (3)</h3>
<p>— Yuan Rongfang</p>
<p>Among the caves in the mountains, Yanhua Scenic Area is the most secluded and famous, and the road is the farthest. Shiwu and Ziyun are second, and Xixia is next. Only the coolness is suitable for summer, and the ancient Yanhua, the open Shiwu, the stone color of Ziyun, and the sound of the wind of Xixia make people unforgettable. In summer, when I encounter extreme heat, I often bring the Nanhua Sutra or several volumes of ancient poems and a small amount of dry food in the early morning for a day trip. Spreading out the scrolls on the stone table, the cold interest lasts forever. I don't know how high the temperature is outside the cave.</p>
<p>The Xiling Seal Society is the most beautiful place in the lake. The structure is exquisite, and the layout is simple. The slopes are high and low, and the wonderful scenery is layered. The bamboo path and thatched steps are full of ancient charm. The top of the mountain is hotter, so it is suitable to go there in the late evening. I often wait until the sun sets in the west and climb the Sizhao Pavilion to cool off. Spreading my clothes in the wind, I can see the whole lake. The clouds and trees are vast, and the shadows of the towers and mountains are all gone. The mist is vast, and the sound of the bells and people's voices are clear. This scenery and this joy cannot be obtained again.</p>
<p>People say that the spring lake is not as good as the autumn lake, and the autumn lake is not as good as the winter lake. I say that the sunny lake is not as good as the rainy lake, and the rainy lake is not as good as the moonlit lake. However, you cannot swim in the moonlit lake in winter, and it is not suitable in spring and autumn. Only summer is the best. Because the summer lake is hot and sultry, you must swim at night. You must have a moon at night to have fun. Therefore, every year in May, June, and July, after the first quarter of the moon, Hangzhou people compete for night swimming. For a time, luxurious boats are launched together, and brocade strings are played in a mixed way. There is a scene of the Southern Song Dynasty. I also often make appointments with two or three close friends to release the light in the middle of the stream. The bright moon hangs like a pearl, and the stars are scattered like chess pieces. The lake is wide and the sky is wide, and the storm is clear and the dew is cold. I suddenly feel tired and lose the heat, and the waves are crystal clear and the moon is broken into fish scales, as if sitting in an ice pot and swimming in a jade mirror. In this body, I am in the Guanghan Immortal Mansion. Or lean on the boat and blow the flute, learning from Su Shi's trip to the Red Cliff, or spread my clothes and hold the cup, looking for Li Bai's joy in Danyang, exploring the moon shadow in Santan, and visiting Xiaoqing at the foot of the mountain. Strolling leisurely on the Su Causeway, the weeping willows are reflected upside down. Staying in the lake pavilion, the carved platform is immersed. Looking at the surrounding green mountains from a distance, they are like flowers in the fog. And three or five fireflies flicker on the water surface, making shooting stars fly. Every time I wait for the bell of Nanping to move, I discuss making a return plan. Then the moon has set and the stars are horizontal, the fog is wet and the kudzu clothes are cool and refreshing to the skin. I often hate that I have no rice bag to wear for a long time. Old travels are like dreams, and past events are like smoke. The scenic spot is not always there, and the famous mountain has been separated. I deeply sigh that the enjoyment of happiness must be in time. (End)</p>

<h3>Women Women (15)</h3>
<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>At this time, he felt that there was no way to avoid this difficulty, so he had to pretend to be serious and said in a commanding tone; "Isn't Xiao Rong over there? You don't need to call him, hurry up and pull the carriage over."</p>
<p>The boy was confused. He just saw Xiao Rong with a very beautiful woman, so he didn't dare to say anything more. He just went and pointed to one side and said, "The carriage is parked over there!"</p>
<p>At that time, Miss Ding naturally did not know what was going on, so she did not pay any attention. So Mr. Lu wanted to use the trick of getting away unnoticed, so he hurriedly walked to the other side, but Miss Ding stopped him.</p>
<p>"Didn't the coachman just say that the carriage was parked over there?" She pulled Mr. Lu to walk over there. Mr. Lu had no choice and could not dodge any more, so he had to follow her.</p>
<p>He pulled down the brim of his hat, covering half of his face, and in great panic, he had to get into his father's carriage. Fortunately, he saw that his father was dozing off in the carriage when he got in.</p>
<p>"Hurry up! To the Railway Hotel!" he ordered.</p>
<p>The boy woke Xiao Rong's father up, pulled the carriage and walked, while secretly pulling at his clothes, and pointing his mouth behind him, meaning to tell him to turn his head and see who was sitting in the carriage. But he had just woken up from his dream, and did not understand what the boy meant: but the boy still said to him softly: "Boss! Look at who is sitting behind you?"</p>
<p>"What's it to you? I've seen a lot of men and women from Shanghai!" Although he turned his head and took a look, he only saw Miss Ding sitting on the right. Xiao Rong happened to be sitting behind him, so he did not see it all clearly. He only thought that this was an ordinary couple.</p>
<p>The boy wanted to be more troublesome, but he still said softly: That's Xiao Rong!</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense! I don't have the blessing to have such a son!" He still didn't believe it, thinking that the boy was just joking with him.</p>
<p>The Railway Hotel arrived, and Xiao Rong quickly paid the fare and got out of the car with Miss Ding. The boy was just about to call Xiao Rong's father to see if it was Xiao Rong, when he suddenly heard someone shouting on the other side of the road: "Hurry up! Pull the carriage over!"</p>
<p>When he heard that business had come, he naturally did not dare to delay, so he did not have time to call Xiao Rong's father to see Xiao Rong again, and immediately pulled the carriage over.</p>
<p>On the road, the boy told Xiao Rong's father in detail: "The two people who took the car just now are really Xiao Rong and another woman I don't know." However, Xiao Rong's father was still skeptical and thought that he might have seen the wrong person.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Increased by Ten Taels Last Week</h3>
<p>Of the total of about 30,000 exchange contracts, last week's margin deposit showed signs of increasing again. However, the situation was complicated. It started weak at the beginning of the week, then turned firm, breaking through the 750 tael mark. Afterwards, it turned into a consolidation phase with twists and turns due to fluctuating international news. In total, there was a fluctuation of twenty taels, and finally, the total increase was ten taels. It seems that the market was bewildered by the conflicting international news. As for the silver market, there appeared to be a slight drop. The Shanghai exchange rate for drafts was sluggish for a long time, and it only shrank by half a grade at the end of the week. Consequently, the domestic market also tightened slightly, with forward contracts dropping within three "bian" (a unit of currency). Chinese merchants were buying to cover previous short positions, but short positions still dominate, while the gold margin spread is long. It is estimated that there are about thirty thousand exchange contracts, with spot firms and non-industry clients being mostly short, while the Dalian group is mostly long. As for spot red bars, they frequently rose last week, as the Tianjin and Dalian groups were very active. Unexpectedly, transportation was suddenly obstructed over the weekend, leading to a standstill, like a bolt from the blue. The price also fell from 13.5 taels to 11 taels (based on incremental additions to the gold margin). The gold margin, based on the daily exchange settlement price, initially suppressed 50 taels, then only 40 taels, and finally more than 40 taels, resulting in substantial profits for spot shipments. The general situation of the past week is summarized below.</p>
<p>There was a total fluctuation of twenty taels throughout the week. Starting on Monday (August 3rd), the gold exchange was closed for one day due to the bank holiday, but there was no rise or fall in silver or large bars. The next day, there was no market for large bars, the silver price rose by 0.125, while the forward sterling and other currencies remained unchanged. The gold market was back to normal. It opened down 4.3 "qian" (a unit of currency), at 737.5 taels, then 6.5 "qian", due to the rise in the US stock market, especially the reported rise in the silver price. Influenced by this, large investors and speculators bought in, pushing the price above 40 taels, but there were also fluctuations of three or four taels. The noon close was at 40 taels.

As for the gold margin, it opened down 2.7 "qian", at 737 taels, due to reports that cash was being transported from England to the United States, which could lead to an averaging of cash around the world, and the British exchange rate should increase. Therefore, people's hearts were withering, especially the sellers were active, and then it fell to 35.5 taels. Afterwards, due to the activation of spot shipments, it suddenly surged above the 40 tael mark. In the afternoon, the sellers softened again, and the closing price was only 36 taels, a further drop of 3.7 "qian" compared to the previous day. The next day, large bars rose again by 0.0625, the silver price by 0.125, but the external market for forward sterling remained unchanged, and the domestic market seemed slightly better. Dealers first sold and then bought in, and the gold price opened higher, at 37.2 "qian", due to the fall in the US stock market, the sharp drop in the British pound abroad, and reports that France was buying gold from the United States. As a result, the gold market was excited, large investors began to buy in, and then rose to 45.3 "qian". The market was extremely flat in the afternoon, opening at 43.2 "qian", then from four taels to 2.5 "qian", and then back to 4.5 "qian", and the closing price was 3.8 "qian", a rebound of 7.8 "qian" compared to the previous day, reversing three days of consecutive falls.

<h3>Securities: The Unified Tax Price Increased Significantly Last Week</h3>
<p>Other transactions were firm, with more than 110 million in transactions.</p>
<p>Last week's market conditions for various bonds in the local securities market showed sparse spot transactions. The entire week only saw 28,200 yuan traded, including 12,200 yuan in Disbandment Bonds, 9,000 yuan in 1929 Customs Bonds, 5,000 yuan in 1930 Customs Bonds, and 1,000 yuan each in 1929 Charity Bonds and 1930 Rolled Bonds. There were no other transactions. The futures market was more active than the previous week, with buying and selling interest remaining very lively throughout. All bond transactions were far more successful than before. Among them, the 1930 Unified Tax Treasury Bonds developed the fastest, with extremely large daily trading volumes. Even the most prosperous 1930 Customs Bonds seemed inferior in comparison. The daily transaction situation was as follows: Monday reached 25.5 million yuan, Tuesday also had 23.4 million yuan, Wednesday was estimated at more than 18.3 million yuan, the last day of the week was 16.6 million yuan, and Thursday and Friday each had 12-13 million yuan.

As for the trend of market prices of various bonds during the past week, the first half of the week saw a very good situation in the north, with Shi Yousan's forces being defeated in every battle, and the military situation was about to end. The suppression of the Communists in Hunan and Jiangxi also came to a temporary end, and there was also an atmosphere of peace in Guangdong and Guangxi. Therefore, the market was very popular, and various parties bought in, and the demand exceeded the supply, so the price increased strongly. The Unified Tax rose by three yuan on Monday, and the 1930 Customs Rolled Bonds, Disbandment Bonds, and 1929 Customs Bonds each rose by two yuan. Other bonds also rose considerably. On Tuesday, there was a slight contraction, and on Wednesday, it became popular again, with the Unified Tax rising by 1.4 yuan, the 1930 Customs Bonds rising by one yuan, and the rest remaining peaceful. After that, the bond market situation did not have new changes, and the market was waiting and watching. The bond price was very peaceful, and it was abnormally sluggish every day. The changes in the bond market have come to an end. However, during these days, due to the prosperity of the selling side, there was a rotation to the low side. As a result, the Unified Tax, 1930 Customs Bonds, 1929 Customs Bonds, Disbandment Bonds, etc., have all risen quite a bit. The statistics of the high and low fluctuations of various bonds in the past week are listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Cotton Market Initially Rose, Then Retreated Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market had some upward momentum at the beginning of the week due to abnormal weather, stable foreign cotton prices, severe flooding in all directions, and increasingly severe flooding in Hankou, which was expected to have a major impact on cotton production. Therefore, domestic groups and bulls bought in and increased their positions. After a few days, the weather was still good, and the US cotton situation appeared weak again, and a downward trend suddenly started. The spot price of US cotton broke through the 8-cent mark, and there were also reports of Indian cotton being devalued and sold off. Various factories did not dare to purchase due to the uncertain general trend. As a result, people were panicked, and the price fell by eight or nine "qian" in one day. The lowest price for October was 35.6 taels. At the end of the week, due to the release of government estimates, buyers expected an upward trend, and retail investors bought in, and the market price rebounded slightly. The October price reached 36.25 taels. However, the world cotton market is very pessimistic, and it is difficult to rise sharply in the future. Therefore, large investors unanimously sold short. Buyers, on the other hand, are tight-lipped because they expect the price of gold to rise, and some even buy in to increase their positions. However, the government report released on the 8th has not yet been received in the local telegram on the 9th. US cotton alone rose slightly by 10 pounds. However, according to the Chicago telegram, the official estimate is that the cotton production is as high as 15,584,000 bales. The New York Stock Exchange was closed in the afternoon, but the Chicago Stock Exchange still had transactions as usual in the afternoon. The December price plummeted 137 points, to 6.86 cents, and the 7-cent line has been broken, which shows the extreme danger of the US cotton situation. The future of local cotton also has a very unstable phenomenon. Spot cotton trading is very cold, with 6,420 bales of Yao cotton being shipped. The amount of spot cotton that was opened is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Manufacturer	Price	Price	Transaction	Time Limit</p>
<p>Bloc Area	39.00	——	1,000 pieces, to be shipped to the factory immediately</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton	38.00	——	200 pieces	Spot	Also</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Fell by More Than Two Taels Last Week</h3>
<p>Actual Sales Sharply Reduced</p>
<p>The yarn market moved gradually towards a soft path last week, and the situation was increasingly weak. The overseas flower and yarn situation tended to be downstream. In addition, the floods in all directions were frequent, the actual needs were greatly hit, and the various groups had no excitement. The transaction was completely stagnant, and the people were very depressed. The sellers felt active, and the big family was unmoved, and there was no idea of making up for it, because the original cotton was loose and the cost was cheaper. Buyers felt that the general situation was bad, and all the hands were unmoved. In short, the world cotton market was unusually pessimistic, and there was no revitalization. The floods in various places became more and more serious. The farmers will have weak purchasing power in autumn, so the large households unanimously sell out and look small. However, on the multi-faceted side, the attitude is still quiet because the price of gold is expected to rise, and there is no letting go. However, the current yarn transaction is too clear, and how the future will be, it must depend on the actual needs for progress and retreat. The yarn market is very weak, and there are more sellers. Each month fell by two taels from the previous week, and the transaction statistics were 29,300 bales. The current business of the guest gang is quiet, and the statistics of the various gangs in the whole week are 3,845 bales. 1,280 bales in the same industry, the market fell by two taels, and the number of bales bought by each gang is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Before the Government Report Was Released</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was waiting for the government report, and the market was mixed. First, it was firm because of the short position, and then it was weak because of the public sale. The futures rose from 5 to 11 pounds, and the spot rose from 10 pounds. British cotton futures rose from 11 to 12 points, and the spot rose from 15 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 15 points. Indian cotton was firm due to good news from Liverpool and short position coverage, with Pingle rising 2.75 rupees, Aomula rising 3.50 rupees, and Bailuoxi rising 4.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (August 8th telegram)</p>

<p>August 8th New York Telegram: The Department of Agriculture's cotton harvest report has been released at noon today. The amount of cotton production is 15,584,000 bales, an increase of 1,500,000 bales compared to the average of various private estimates.

The only exchange market in the United States that traded on Saturday afternoon was Chicago.

<h3>Food: Limited Post-Market North-South Rice Market</h3>
<p>Changxi North Japonica Rice Has Been Discontinued</p>
<p>New Japonica Rice Price Increases by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>South Market: Few sources from Luli. The trades in Qingpu No. 1, Tongli No. 2, Pinghu No. 2, and Pudong new Japonica rice No. 1 were not smooth. Because the Rice Industry Association's evaluation was public, the customers were also affected. Changxi North Japonica rice was out of stock. Early and late rice and foreign reeds were tight and the prices were slightly increasing. The rise and fall of the Su-Tong gang rice were limited. A boat of new Japonica rice arrived yesterday, with a total of more than 100 "shi" (a unit of volume). He Sheng and Shen Li bought it, and the market price rose by half a yuan compared to the previous market. Bian Yin (a type of rice) rose by two yuan. Tea shops still had strong demand, and the price increased by 0.3-0.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Since the recent limit on the plate, the number of goods coming from the inland has been slightly less. There are about 17,000 "dan" (a unit of weight) of ship cargo in stock. In the market, the trade in Zhongguan thick japonica rice is the most, and the situation is gradually increasing. In addition, there are two kinds of top goods. Because the Rice Industry Association limits the price to 17 yuan, customers are unwilling to sell it because of the blood capital relationship. There is a lack of fresh early and late rice, and there is a slight increase in the general trend. The price of Lu Bu reed (a type of rice) is high and fixed and slightly tighter. Foreign japonica rice and Dongxin japonica rice are sold as soon as they arrive. The large market rose by half a yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Was Lonely and Uninspired Last Week</h3>
<p>European and American Silk Telegrams Were Not Forwarded... Chinese Merchants' Attitudes Were Passive</p>
<p>Silk Factories Reduced Work and Stopped Machines... Silk Sales Were Extremely Sluggish</p>
<p>The silk market in the local foreign firms in last week was increasingly lonely and uninspired. After the summer vacation, most of the European and American silk factories have not yet started work, and the sales of raw silk factories are still stagnant. In addition, Japanese silk is still priced cheaply, and the price difference between Japanese silk and Shanghai White Factory is two or three hundred taels. Japanese merchants continue to sell hard, and no one cares about Chinese silk. The local telegrams in Shanghai were not forwarded, and both Chinese and foreign silk merchants had a passive attitude. Each silk factory's silk is getting thicker, and the types are reducing work and stopping machines. The European and American silk sales have reached their extreme. The silk market in last week has almost stagnated. The inland silk door sales are also clear, and a total of only more than 100 packs were traded in the whole week, and more than 300 packs were exported. Overseas Chinese silks are all marked with no market, and the exchange rate has decreased, and the silk price has fallen in the dark. There is really no market to record. Here is a list of Chinese silk market prices in the European and American markets at the weekend (New York price per pound in gold yuan, Lyon price per kilogram in francs).</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: The Market Is Quiet and Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, the source area telegram, did not arrive on Sunday, and the public meeting market divided the market transaction was very little, but the market was quite firm, and the households shouted for higher prices. The newly arrived No. 24 crude sugar white sand of the Dutch sugar was valued at 11.45 taels, and the trend was very good, and the ordinary goods were 11.4 taels. The market was flat.

<h3>Metals: New Lead Wire Rises Straight Up</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday was Sunday. The metal transaction was not very good because the various gangs and factories were all resting. The city was also very idle. Because of the imports and exports of all cities, it was very small.</p>
<p>New Lead Wire Short and Needed: Since Dongyang lead wire cannot come to Shanghai, the Shanghai New Lead Wire market has a rising trend. The standards have been increased one after another. 16 to 20 per "dan" (unit of weight) is estimated at 13.25 taels, and 21 to 25 is sold at 18.75 taels, but the market is extremely scarce, the popularity is getting stronger, and the buyers are getting more and more prosperous, so the coming standard is expected to rise again.</p>
<p>Bamboo Steel Reverses from Weak to Strong: The recent purchase of bamboo steel bars is very strong, but the goods are scarce. The market has reversed from weak to strong. Each ton is sold at 95 taels. There are six or seventy tons.</p>
