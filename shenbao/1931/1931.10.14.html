<p>時評</p>
<h3>⊙國際協約國當前之重責</h3>
<p>自九月十八日日軍暴行發生以至目前。中國國家與民族。實遭受空前之艱難與威脅。而同時遠東情勢。亦正逐日向悲慘之前途飛躍推進。使世界同時走上安全與破壞之歧途。此種事實。都由日人實施於。我東北有增無減之暴行逐日爲其說明。</p>
<p>國聨爲應付此嚴重之情勢。昨日已再度集會商籌解决矣。前途如何。當可於一兩日之電訊中逐次披露。但吾人認爲負有解决此嚴重情勢之責任者不僅爲國聨。非戰公約與華盛頓九國協約。此時亦正應毫不迴避此種艱難工作起而站立於問題之當面作有效力之發言吾人於非戰公約與九國協約當前之沉默。實至滋疑惑。</p>
<p>查非戰公約釋第一條云。：「各國深覺用戰爭以解决國際爭端。以爲互相間國際政策之工具。應予以廢止。第二條云。「各協約國同意解决各國間發生之任何性質之爭執糾紛。除用和平方法外。不得用其他方法。」</p>
<p>又查九國協約第一條有云。「（一）當尊重中國之主權獨立及領土與行政的完整。。（二）當給予中國以最完全及最無障礙之機會。俾自行發展並維持一方力而安固之政府。（四）當自行抑制勿利用中國之情勢。以求獲得足以減損友邦臣民或市民之權利之特别權利或特典。並勿容許有害友邦安寧之行爲。」第七條有云。。「各締約國協定凡有一種時局。發生在締約國中任何一國之意以爲關係本條約之適用問題。並宜討論此項適用問題者。各關係之協約國間。應即爲充分而無隔閡之交換意見。」</p>
<p>今日人不以外交方式與我國談判解决東北之種種交涉。而逕以暴行相加。不宣而戰。顯係破壞非戰公約第一條之規定。日人以軍力解散我無抵抗之軍隊。佔據我東北各大都市。換易旗幟設置官吏。煽播獨立。宣言要求維持其在東北之特權。甚且以飛機向我錦州抛擲炸彈。派砲艦駛入我腹地。横肆脅迫顯係破壞九國協約第一條各項之規定是則非戰公約之應執行其第二條之規定。九國協約之應執行其第七條之規定。起而維護條約與信義之尊嚴。於此時機。蓋絶無徘徊與等待之餘地。</p>
<p>中國人民今敢正告國際聨盟非戰公約九國協約諸簽字之友邦。日人自　　九月十八以來加諸中國之暴行。實使中國有血氣之人民。斷然可忍受。中國人民今願力持鎭靜。以維持國際條約之尊嚴。并靜候各簽字之友邦共起而維持條約之尊嚴。與各本國之信義使東北事情能獲得和平公允之解决。然而假使各簽字國推諉其應負之責任。不能確切保證國際盟約之尊嚴。不能制止事態之發展。並恢復中國完整之主權。領土。行政。使背棄信義破壞條約者切實承負其責任。則中國人民將終始基於維護國際協約之尊嚴之精神並爲求民族生存之自由。斷然自起擔負此無可迴避之重責。而毫不畏縮。中國今已處於無以控制事態向前推進之境地。能控制者。惟有國際協約簽字之各友邦。中國人民已具最大之决心。將沉着靜聽各友邦爲完成其責任之發言。如其不然。則將以毫不猶豫之態度。準備接受無可避免之嚴重事情之臨到。</p>

<h3>外部部駁覆日使節略</h3>
<p>日政府不履行撤兵約言</p>
<p>日軍仍繼續其侵略行爲</p>
<p>如有不幸結果日本應負全責</p>
<p>（南京）日本政府對我國反日運動、於九日提出節略、作種種無理要求、業經中央特種外交委員會議决、據理駁復、該駁復已於十三日下午三時半、由外交部派亞洲司科員馬長亮、送往日領館、轉交日使重光、茲誌其全文如次、</p>
<p>對於本月九日、日本政府之節略、中國政府茲特申述意見如下、</p>
<p>日本軍隊、不顧國際公法、違反國聨盟約·巴黎非戰公約·及華盛頓九國條約之規定、未受對方之挑釁、即突然侵入中國領土、並佔領中國遼寗、及吉林省各地方、推翻省縣合法行政機關、且於侵入之時、作多種戰事之行爲、及其他即在戰爭時亦爲國際公法所不許之舉動、如殺戮無辜人民、轟擊無防禦之城市、擊射客車、移去並没收公衆及私人之財産等等、中日二國、旣同受上述各國際條約之約束、各該條約、令簽字諸國對於解决切紛爭、應負設法用和平方法之義務、於是中國政府、乃立即提請國聨行政院處理、行政院决議請日本政府、命令該國軍隊、從速撤出、自九月十八日以來佔領之區域、並决定承認日本政府所作莊嚴之保證、謂當遵守該院之請求、如屆時不能履行上述之保證時、規定以十月十四日爲再行集會之日期、中國政府自事變最初發生以來、即不作任何對敵之行爲、雖日本軍隊之挑釁舉動、日見激烈、蔓延益廣、但仍竭力所能、嚴格命令各軍隊、對於日本軍隊繼續之進逼、不作任何形式之抵抗、</p>
<p>同時對於全國施以一種嚴格之紀律、盡其方法、以保護在中國行政權下中國領士内諸日本僑民之生命財産、觀於中國所管轄幅員遼闊之地面、無論何處、均無不幸事變發生、足以確實證明中國對於向國聨行政院所作之保證、實已愼密遵守、政府迭次之命令布告、節制我國人民正當之憤激、使不軼出法律範圍、十月七日、中國政府又命令各地方官吏、「所有外僑生命財産負責保護、並嚴防反動份子、乘機煽惑行動越軌」等語、足見政府之告誡益强而有力、此種明令之頒布、適在日本政府不履行其撤兵約言異常明顧之時、</p>
<p>中國政府遵照國聨行政院之决議、指派大員二人、接收退出地方、並將此事正式通告日本政府、及國聨行政院、但日本政府、迄未實行其所表示之意思、將佔領地方交還於中國官吏、而觀於中立國視察者之報告、瀋陽·吉林·敦化·巨流河·新民·田莊台等處、現尚在日本軍隊佔領之下、一面此種軍隊、仍無故繼續殺傷無辜平民、毁壞財産、</p>
<p>故中國人民之憤激、僅限於不購買日本貨物、此實爲全世界所驚異、夫選擇個人所購物品之自由、乃係個人權利任何政府、均不能加以干涉、政府固有保護外國人民生命財産之責任、然無論任何公認之規則·及無論任何國際法之原則、未有需要政府令其禁止·或懲罰·實行公民初步之權利者、使對於此事果有責任、則責任應完全由日本負之、蓋自萬寳山案件發生以來、日本政府以其多數不友誼之行爲、釀成對於日本貨物、普通厭薄之心理也、</p>
<p>中國政府以最嚴格之方式、遵守國聨行政院之决議、愼密保護日人生命財産、並制止各種足使局勢愈趨嚴重之行爲、其結果無論任何日本人民、均迄未遇有不幸之事變、巳如上述、當此之時、日本軍隊在東省仍繼續其侵略行爲、甚至最近以飛機轟擊自遼寗省城瀋陽佔領後·遼寗省内文官暫時所設辦公處所之錦縣、此種作戰行爲、一如日本政府所深知、使國聨行政院决議提前原定開會之日期、中國政府對於日本政府所引兩國對於國聨之責任一節、表示滿意、惟聲明最近十日以來、對於各種足使局勢愈趨嚴重之行爲、以致國聨行政院之决議、不能實現者、皆出於日本方面、中國政府不負其責任、中國政府雖因日本軍隊繼續不斷之侵略行爲、正處爲異常困難地位、但對於日本僑民生命財産、仍竭力予以保護、但日本如仍用兵力以爲其國家政策之工具、因此如有不幸結果、尤其在兩國政府已將案件提交國聨行政院·及國聨行政院巳規定兩國應循方針之際、日本政府應負完全責任、中國政府因深信中日兩國人民間、感情之隔閡·及兩國通商上之困難、全爲日本軍隊種種非法舉動所造成之當然結果、以爲日本政府倘能努力、將其所以致此之原因、設法解除、於改善兩國間之關係、而維持東亞及世界之和平、當有良好之結果也、（十三日專電）</p>
<h3>日本對美聲明</h3>

<h3>蔣在國府紀念週演詞</h3>
<p>擁護公理與抗禦强權</p>
<p>國民政府昨日（十二日）上午舉行總理紀念週、蔣中正主席、首由孔祥熙報告對日問題後、蔣繼續講演擁護公理與抗禦强權、原詞如下、</p>
<p>「日本軍隊佔據我東北遼寗吉林各地方、迄今巳逾三星期了、上月三十日、國際聨合會决議通知日本撤兵、希望他在兩星期内撤　期限也快要到了、國聨要日本撤兵、本希望此次兵禍不再擴大、此案能和平解决、但是日本非但無澈兵的準備、其軍事行動、反更加積極、尤其本月八號、日軍用許多飛機、在錦州我們遼寗臨時省政府所在的地方、抛擲許多炸彈、使我人民生命財産、損失很重、日軍此種舉動、完全欲憑藉其强大的武力、達到他們侵略的目的、這不但是我國的莫大恥辱、難以忍受、即世界各國、也必視爲公理人道之敵、不能長此容忍的、國聨行政院在上月未閉會的時候、本定本月十四日再行開會、如在十四日以前、日兵完全撤退、即不再開會、但照近日日兵行動、尤其是轟炸錦州、國聨認爲形勢非常嚴重、已决定提前於十三日開會、我們相信這一次開會、一定能依照公道的主張、找得和平的路徑、使東亞和平、以至世界和平、不致被日本一國所破壞、</p>
<p>照最近數日的情形、侵入東北的日軍、不但未遵照國聨的通告、不使事件據大、且更到處騷擾、日日擴展其軍事行動、不僅如此、即在我國南部沿海口岸及長江一帶、也紛紛派遣軍艦、運載陸戰隊、到處示威、且在上海僑居的日本人、昨天開居留居大會、也於散會後集合數千人列隊游行、闖入中國商店、擊傷中國孩童、撕毁標語、肆意辱駡、其有意挑衅更屬明顯、所幸找警察嚴密防範、民衆亦持沉着鎭靜的態度、所以他們雖有挑釁的决心、結果還是無釁可開、我們這種堅忍鎭靜的表示、並非即是屈服、乃是知識程度進步的表現我們國人的知識程度、現在已非三四十年前可比外族武力决不能輕易威脅我們的日本此次無故占領我國土地、必自恃其强大的陸海空軍、以爲中國必非其敵、我若稍與抵抗彼即可藉口開戰、必使我割地賠欵、方肯罷休、我國也有一部份人、也有此種心理、深怕得此結果、欲圖恢復、非數十年或至百年不可、不知此種心理、在我國三四十年以前的情形、是可以適用的、現在却完全不同了、我相信以國人現在知識程度的進步、到了萬不得已而至和平破裂、我們一定不會失敗的、我們現在固要盡力避免戰事、且在未至戰爭的時候、仍要鎭靜持重、無暴其氣、但我們國民知識程度的進步、實在可以和强敵决一死戰、這不僅我們自己要認識、世界各國在這一回事中、都可以認識的了、</p>
<p>前清甲午庚子兩次戰事、中國有兩椿最可恥的事、第一·在甲午年與日本開戰時、北洋艦隊已被日軍戰敗、南洋艦隊依然袖手旁觀、而且宣告中立、這顯然表示中國人無民族思想與國家觀念、使外人視我中國人無團結一致的精神、在此種情形之下、如何能不受人欺侮、如何可免失敗、第二·庚子年的義和團不辨國籍、不分恩怨、一味仇視、充分表示中國人民没有知識、自然要、</p>
<p>給外國人輕蔑欺侮、不過這是三四十年以前國民知識程度的的象徵、绝不是現在民族心理的表現、日本軍人不明此理、猶抱持其三四十年以前的目光、來看民國二十年的中國人、他們這種錯誤、可斷定就是他們失敗的先兆、現在我們人民已經都知道國家是人民共有的、不像以前視作皇帝一個人所有了、因爲以前視國家爲皇帝所有、所以與日本開戰時、便也看作皇帝一人的事、百姓是不必管的到了今日、我們國民已經把這個心理完全更改了、知道國家是人民的國家、無論日本欺侮我們那一處人民或者侵佔我們那一處地方、人民就立刻覺得這是欺侮我們全體人民、與侵佔我們整個國家、人民對國家觀念、不但十分熱烈、且在極熱烈之中依然能保持很明白的理智、不作無意識的行動、不中敵人的狡計、這就是我們立國的基本、也就是禦侮的基本</p>
<p>日本此次出兵、領我遼吉兩省、全國同胞、立刻一致起來反抗、不僅長江一帶如此、即最南部的廣東人民的表示、也十分激昂、這種全國一致的精神、眞是衞國的至寳、比什麽力量都大、照上述理論看來、現在我們的軍備武力、雖然不如日本、但因爲我們人民知識程度提高、所增加的衞國的力量、實在足以保衞我們國家的存在、這種精神的表現、决不能是軍國主義的國家所能壓倒的、所以此次事件、固希望能夠和平解决、但若萬不得已、而須以武力自衞、就必定可以得到最後的勝利、我們必要爲擁國家民族的生、　、　　公理人　的　　、堅持　底、决不屈服、　　　　　力量的表現、不但不爲敵人所　嚇　　要爲　界公理國際公法來盡其所應盡的責任、我們有　　的力量、無論異族用什麽陸海空軍的暴力、來壓迫我們、我們全國仍能以極悲痛沉着的精神、抵抗此莫大的凌侮、現在的國民、已與三四十年以前的國民、大不相同、日本人的　光應當變更、我們自己更要　清此點、我們更要知道世界上任何國家、或任何個人、都不能離開世界而調立、就國家論、立國於世、必有與國、國與國間自必有其相安相助之道、决不能祇顧自己的權益、而妨害甚至侵犯他國的權益、如果如此、則此祇知爲自己的國家、必不能得與國的同情、而安然並存、我國是世界國家之一、即不能離開世界、同樣旣是國際聨合會的一分子、即不能離開國際、任何國家、離開國際、都不免失敗、都要自取滅亡、現在日本即陷於此種境地、軍人只曉得自己的陸軍强大、只想一脚踢進我東三省腹地、即可据爲己有、殊不知世界還有公理、决不容許他這樣飛揚跋扈、來破壞世界的和平世界非僅一日本、國際非僅恃强權、日本佔領東三三省、就是破壞東亞和平、破壞世界和平、日本軍閥不明此理、無異自絶於世界、國際聨合會會本希望日本侵入東省事件不要再擴大、而日軍惟恐其不擴大、日本飛機轟炸錦州事件、遠在國聨訓令日軍撤兵之後、故其暴行、使全世界各國都不能承認、政當此大難、鑑於國民知識程度的提高、以及國際公道的猶存、所以决不存畏懼之心、無論日本武力怎樣强大、都不在我們眼中、我們只要自問有無衆志成城的意志、有無誓死革命的精神、是否遵依世界的公理、是否擁護國際公法的尊嚴、以及是否維持非戰公約的存在、我想我們是世界的一國、又是國聨的一分子、無論如何、都有擁護公法與維持公約的責任、且不但我國有此責任、就是世界各國、也都有這個責任的、今日我們固甚願以和平的方式、來保全非戰公約與國際公約的尊嚴、雖日本侵占我們領土、我們仍不對他宣戰、是爲了要維持公理、爲公法公約而竭力忍耐、但到萬不得已時、公法與公約、都不能維持的時候、也决不惜任何犧牲、以盡我擁護國際公法、維持非戰公約的責任、非戰固是神聖、但爲維持公法公約而戰、無論犧牲怎樣重大、也是有價值的、全國同志同胞、我們知道現在已是文化日進的世界、决非那野蠻武力可以制勝一切的、中國民族已不是三四十年以前的情形、忍耐與奮鬥、都能依着時勢的必要、以表現我們的人格與决心、我們在精神上已有最大的勝算、無論敵軍怎樣强大、怎樣來威脅我們、我們總是處之坦然、不爲屈服的、我們更應相信國際有公約、人類有公道、我們要以和平的心理去遵守、以犧牲的精神去擁護、横暴不足畏、威武不足屈、我們要和平奮鬥、以捍禦此次的國難、以擁國際的公法、</p>

<p>自由談痛心的話  鵑　　親愛的國人。我們不用再痛恨暴日了。這一次日軍長驅直入佔領東省。直好似大敲其暮鼓晨鐘。驚醒了全中國四萬萬人的迷夢。於是向來分裂的。謀團結了。向來搗亂的。願妥洽了。向來不知國貨之應提倡而專在日貨上牟利的。現在也一致的在抵制日貨了。暴日又怕我們發老脾氣。仍只有五分鐘的熱度。於是佔營口。進牛莊。炸錦州。一艘艘的戰艦不絶地開進長江來。這好似在我們的心的爐子裏。多加些燃料。使我們血的熱度不致降落下來。國人啊。我們應當感激暴日。不要孤負了他們的美意。中大義勇軍雜記  絜非　　旬日以來。國人憤暴日之蠻横。與祖國之積弱。紛紛組織義勇軍救護隊。以爲政府之後援。加　中大關於此種組織。已於前日完成。舉校上下。咸列名軍帖。更編定番號已組成之義勇軍什入團。凡四營兩獨立連。救護隊爲女生已組成之十人團救護隊。凡十六隊。其基本之組織。皆爲十人團。凡志願加入義勇軍者。皆須先組織抗日救國十人團。以十人名義。共同加入。加入後。比十人即編爲一班。休戚相關。榮辱與共。對義勇軍之管理訓練工作等項。此十人均負連帶關係。故十人團之組成。多係同鄉或同科系。彼此長年交識。此後並各備一極詳細之身世記錄。以爲訂患難死生終身之交焉。十人團成立時。須於午夜集合。黎明設誓。日出宣誓。宣誓時。須東向立。指天誓日。詞至慷慨悲壯。錄如下。「我○○○以覆我之青天爲誓。以照我之白日爲誓。以祖國之河山爲誓。以祖宗之坵墓爲誓。誓以熱血。誓以赤心。誓以至誠。犧牲身家。犧牲性命。犧牲一切。以撲滅侵略我祖國之敵人。以復興我光華燦爛之祖國。我誓以親愛精誠之精神。與我同胞同生死。共患難。如有悔心。或生二志。人天共戮之。此誓。」邇來雖復秋盡草凋。露冷風寒。然十人團之報告宣誓者。日必數起。宣誓之地點多在棲霞山。紫金山。清凉山·台城·後湖等形勝雄壯處。其赴棲霞紫金者、例須前晚備軍幕。携　糧。露宿山巔荒野中。其赴清凉台城等近處者。則多午夜整隊出發。令嚴夜寂寥。壯士慘不驕。投袂而起。登高而望。祖國河山。隱約於蒼茫月色中。蓋不禁其意態之激昂。聲情之切厲也。該校義勇軍訓練主任。訓練部先有派世界小事記　　印度亡國史中的一件珍寳。所謂「堪寗珍寳」“Canningjewei"近來在英國海荷德伯爵Earl　of　Harewood之手但供私人的欣賞。去年七月。這珍寳忽在索士倍拍賣塲中拍賣。得價一萬金鎊。由一位美國人買去。隨後這美國人因爲此物與英國的歷史有關。所以轉贈與倫敦的維多利亞與亞爾白脫博物院。Victoria　and　Aldert　Mueum并且自隱姓名。不願爲人知道。但這珍寳是甚麽東西呢。原來是一個金質之埀子。實爲復興時代最精美的一件飾物。當印度大叛逆Indian　Mutinv時。英軍佔據台爾希城。Ｄelhi在烏德王　Ｋing　of　Oudh的寳庫中發見此物。便取來獻與當時的印度總督堪寗伯爵。Ｅarl　lt　Canning這埀子的中部是製成一個半人半魚的怪物。上身嵌有大珍珠一顆。而面部是藍色土耳其玉雕的。他的口中還銜有一顆紅寳石。眞精美極了。可是印度亡國以後。終於不能自保。做了英國的戰利品。聨想到吾國東省的無數珍寳。落入倭人之手。不由得心酸涙落。（海客）魏益三將軍意。以中大全體同學一再請願。蔣主席已允爲派何浩若敎授。敎授爲留美陸軍大學畢業。任軍旅要職多年。近復解甲講學於中大法學院。一燕趙悲歌之士也。（移酬助賑）謡諑之起源及取締方法  吳羽伯　　自日本派艦來華。而京滬一帶有種種謡諑。應之而起。尤以十月七日首都所傳遍之無稽讕言。實屬不堪殫述。國人之劣根性於此畢洩無遺。考謡言之發生。不外下述三因。一。私慾過重。吾人之良心一旦爲私慾所蒙蔽。則失其主宰。輕信輕疑。祗有畏禍之心。而無判斷之力。事事皆從自私自利上着想。以一已之得失爲處事標準。小小風吹草動。在心理上遂幻爲莫大的危象。語所謂「風聲鶴唳草木皆兵。」皆從此等心理上的幻覺而來。二。智識短淺。不但不能觀察到事件之眞髓。且生種種錯誤之判斷。鼠目寸光。心地糊塗。旣無善後長策。又乏當前思考。市虎杯弓。皆緣於神經衰弱也。三日缺乏毅力。即意志薄弱之謂。旣愚且懦。又輕信狐疑。凡發育不健全之人。及劣等民族。俱且有上述之徵象。旣無智識。又無熱烈之情緒。復無剛毅之意志。遂於稍經事變之際。種種謡諑。緣之而生。彼造。謡者即信謡之人。首都警廳於昨今兩日佈告通衢捉拿造謡之人。不啻海中撈月。彼造謡者。並非另有其人。即一般信謡者心理中所造之幻象是已。欲遏謡諑之發生。有最要之急務二。一取締公務員及智識階級之輕舉妄動。試看日昨下關車站是何等張皇急促之情形。禁止此輩眷屬之遷徙則謡諑自可减少十之六七。二公佈大小政務。一切俱取公開態度。如重大之外交内政。不可過守秘密。祗要在不妨治安範圍内。皆無妨與舉國民衆共見共聞。至治本方法。非從敎育上着手不可。培植民智養成堅毅之國民性。陶冶智識。修養德性。則縱有造謡之人。人將嗤之以鼻。或則飽以老拳。何至似昨今兩日之張皇急促。致令强鄰齒冷耶。標語風潮之一瞥  蘭茜　　余於十月十一日午後一時。乘一路電車赴狄司威路。道經日本小學。見其門前高懸白布。大書「上海日本居留民大會」數字。果見日人魚貫絡繹。麕聚塲中。余逆料其大會結果。必將有所表示。容當拭目相看。詎知即於是午三時左右。日人成羣結隊。沿北四川路一帶狂撕標語。每撕一處。鼓掌如雷。遇商店門前之貼有標語者。即喝令商人撕去。否則自行動手。攀窗拊牆。在所不計。各隊之後。有日兵驅車保護。察其所爲。隱含挑撥作用。幸吾國上下一心。力持鎭靜。以不抵抗爲旨。乃一任其恣意妄爲。厥後爲租界當局所知。即派兵車十輛。先後追隨日車。以壓其勢。是夕七時半。余與何君同由狄司威路出。察看沿途標語。則見先曾撕去者。今仍高貼如故。反增加焉。及抵利男居。元泰布號。聞該號中人曰。矮奴儘撕。余儕可再貼。又前行。抵月宫舞塲附近。見一日軍官與三日兵同行。彼輩東張西望。皆見標語。則細語喃喃。至同福昌布號。有小夥方登梯標貼「日人獸行······」標語可撕中國人心不可撕一等。亦不敢故都聞見錄銖菴  糞閥　　北人男女皆不用褻器。雖蓽門圭竇。而屏偃之處内外分明。故不虞其無别。北人淳朴。猶沿古制也。俗號溷圊曰茅房。或曰東厠。若在公共處所。則别書之曰堂客曰官客。北人以婦人爲堂客。男子爲官客也。若在人家。則屏以内爲内厠。屏以外爲外厠也。其掃除之役。有糞夫爲之。月給以錢。糞夫皆山東籍。其團體至堅。每恃其衆恣爲訛索。居民恒惡而畏之。與水夫號爲二閥。水夫者。無水管之家則必以人運井水供飲用。此輩就有井水處裝車。逐户運送。以水質之美惡定月資之高下。亦以山東籍爲多。（舊京遺事謂明代水夫皆山西籍。）顧糞夫視水夫尤惡。蓋水可自取。而糞夫則每街止一人。或數街奉一人爲首領。如甲不來則乙亦不肯至也。二十年春間。市政府擬規定運糞時間。卒以羣起罷工。無可如何而罷。其凶燄可知矣。運糞以柳筐哉於獨輪車。裝載旣滿。上無覆蓋。摇摇欲墜。見者莫不憚而避之。以視上海租界推挽以行者益爲可厭。此眞大國之恥。欲袪此惡習。唯有多設公共水厠。使若輩無可要挾。或可嚴令改良耳。今上等住宅。無不自設水厠者矣。　　北都井水多苦鹹不可飲。以西法掘深井。以機出之。則免此患。凡無水管之家。必飲機井。然中等人家亦多已設水管者。憶往年無水管時。豪家飲水取自玉泉。誠爲澄洌。道中水車上標黄旗曰上用者。即玉泉之水也。其實都中水道皆源出玉泉。疏濬澄清。不得其道故耳。否則何至跋涉數十里取諸城外也。制止。此日軍官大踏方步。一如京劇武生之登台焉者　。99跳舞塲前之美國水兵。目送之而大笑。然彼揚揚自得。顯示其强國國民之態度也。　　夫標語。最不切實用者也。今用以喚起民衆。其收效若何。固不可知。然尤不免爲日人所忌。欲以横蠻方法。毁之無遺。不知正足以增人惡感。而恨之愈切。標語因此復加多。則此舉也。不特勞而無功。抑且錯盡錯絶。更有進者。此次日居留民所開大會。以商人爲多以日商而擾華商。致令後者更决心反日。日人之爲計左矣再記古今書畫助賑會  鳳　　虞澹涵唐冠玉兩女士發起徵集古今名人書畫助賑展覽會。將開幕時。予嘗記其大概。開會之第一日。予往參觀全豹。歷兩小時之久。頗覺有再記之價值。前者凡遇書畫助賑。其作品因係捐助性質。往往瑕多瑜少。令人不耐久觀。此次全塲出品。各盡所長。琳琅滿目。且因有精緻之裝璜。愈覺增色。足徵各捐助人與發起人之菩薩心腸。令人油然興感。其中有諸名家合作中堂立軸數幅。尤覺别開生面。賀天健之六大幅山水立軸。各有妙處。予元愛其柳溪晚渡一幅。蒼渾雄秀。仿宋而參以元人逸趣。精品也。馮珮華女士畫白衣大士像。烘以淺青雲彩。莊嚴妙相。筆頗能逸吳湖帆題。虞澹涵女士山水横額。氣秀而厚。裝以精架。另有蕭退闇之篆聨共一號碼。唐冠玉女士之白蓮立軸。與潘公展所書之集定盦聨共一號。亦秀健可愛。俞威丹女士桃源仙境圖。筆甚清潤。狄平子之山水不易求。居然亦有一水墨立軸。且有一對聨。此老胸多邱壑。下筆故不尋常。其餘如嘉雲鶴之人物。吳湖帆之山水。毛璲華孫瓊華之仕女。彭壽之佛。魯少坡之馬。席與珍顧慕珍之山水。均有佳處。而古畫中有一號碼爲張岳軍氏捐助之古今名人書畫扇面共二十葉一葉。余覺其中最可寳者。則張子萬之乾筆山水也。（移酬助賑）短訊  更家庭工業社出品毛筆墨汁。係用化學方法製成。香氣芬芳。質地濃厚。不生沉澱。不起腐化。冬夏不變。入口無毒。書畫屏聨。一經摇動。與手磨墨無異。當此抗日救國聲中。日貨墨汁。萬不可用。請即以此爲代可也。說部扶輪會敲夢的杵（一二）程瞻廬  　　陶遲很想拜見這位受知在先的女座師·只是，未敢造次；聽得唐夫人傳喚，他便似得着將軍令了。似這般受恩深重的女座師，便向着伊石榴裙下磕破了頭皮也情願的！其他，還有一種希望；唐軍門的女兒秀英小姐的玉貌，是陶遲在娘娘廟隨喜時候親眼瞧見的，這眞是張生游殿時所說的丨顚不刺的見了萬千，這般可喜娘突曾見。秀英小姐的玉貌，果然是一時無兩的了；陶遲所心醉的，玉貌以外，便是秀英小姐的裙下雙鈎。未坐上轉輪椅子的陶遲，他是二十世紀的新青年；他對於纖足的流弊，認爲漢族衰弱的大原因；漢唐的國勢，爲什麽可以威及外夷？只爲這時的婦女不是纖足，所以産生的國民有這健强的體魄。趙宋以來的中國，高唱着一種纖足的人工美，漢族便奄奄不振了！一亡於女眞，再亡於蒙古，三亡於滿奴，國民的體魄，失却了原有的健强，這是受着婦女纖足影響！陶遲坐上了轉輪椅子，他的頭腦受着過去的時代化，再也不會産生這般思想了。他不但是，受了八股文章的洗禮；他尤其是，崇拜纖纖金蓮的忠實信徒。爲着唐秀英在娘娘神像前盈盈下拜，他對於秀英小姐的裙下雙鈎，有個很精密很深切的認識；自從清明日起自到重陽以後，唐秀英全體的美丨尤其是纖纖蓮翹，早已盤踞了陶遲的半間心房！餘下的半間，有先入爲主的八股文章盤踞着。據此，可見陶遲生平的愛，只有書與美人；這句話，還嫌範圍太寛，實則他所愛的，只有書中的八股文章，美人裙下的纖纖蓮鈎罷了。他這番高折仙桂第一枝，他的八股文章已取得了相當的代價：他欣然去拜見這位女座師，拜見了女座師，便和這位師姊或師妹丨唐秀英小姐有接近的可能。　　「咄咄！怪事！文科解元到提督衙門去拜見座師！咄咄丨怪事丨文科解元到」提督軍門的夫人面前去行門生禮！」這是街頭巷尾行人口中的嗟嘆怪異聲。</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論自製汽車平議　志政　　　我國有三大困難情形　　辦法祗可採漸進政策　　年來外侮交逼。災祲迭乘。舉國上下。無不憂勤奮發。思所以强國富民之策。而抵制外貨之聲浪。亦甚囂塵上。前者某君復有中國自製汽車之建議。申言自製汽車。以塞漏巵之重要。語重心長。誠爲當務之急汽車輸入。年必巨萬。如自製成績優良。非惟可以自給。且可以一部分供諸海外。又爲本國增加一項輸出。意至善也。惟自製汽車。非空言所可實現者。必有具體之方案。相當之準備。合乎經濟原則。能臻出品精良。然後利可收而效可見。竊嘗考之。覺我會自製汽車。有若干困難之點。不可不深長考慮者。一曰成本過高也。查汽車之構造極繁。其所用之原料。重要部分。有鋼鐵銅木橡皮玻璃布料等。美國因産業發達。故上述各項工廠。如鋼鐵公司橡皮公司等。均已發展至最高程度。成本低廉。故汽車公司之不能自給者。可於其他公司中購買。配合成之。價不致過昂。較大之公司。如通用福特等。則於汽車公司之下。分設所需要原料之工廠。如木廠玻璃廠鐵廠。莫不應有盡有。藉省經手人之各項額外費用。以故成本尤較其他公司之出品爲廉。福特通車物美價廉。非無因也。尤有進者。即各公司規模偉大。分工細微。一日所産。可達車五六千輛。大量重産之結果。即爲每個單位成本（Ｐer　Unit　Cost）之低降、其理蓋極明顯。中國情形。實有異於是。我國産業。尚在極幼稚時代。除紗廠尚有相當成績外。餘如鍊鋼廠·玻璃廠·橡皮廠等爲汽車主要原料之物品。滙付闕如。汽車廠家無可購用。此其一。若令汽車工廠附設各項應用原料廠。勢非有極偉大之資本不可。以最近之將來而言。此巨宗資本何由籌措乎。此其二。即令資本可有。工廠可辦。然出産數量旣微。則每個單位之成本。自必遠超舶來品之上。國人雖樂用國貨。其如高價何。此其三。故於成本方面觀察。中國目前自製汽車。實爲不可能之事實。　　二曰無國家保護也。世界汽車成本之廉。莫過於美。　歐洲方面。若英若意若法。亦皆可自製。供給國内一部部分之需要。是則關稅壁壘保障之功。所以救濟成本原理之家中。當自由貿易時代。固無所謂關稅壁壘。各國貨物。可以自由輸送。保護貿易之說興。舉凡國内幼稚工業。不得以成本與外貨競爭者。則於該貨入口時。徵收高價關稅。務使其成本與國内製品平衡而後已。以汽車言。設美國汽車成本每輛爲三百元。英國爲三百二十元。則英國政府。必課美國汽車以二十元或二十元以上之關稅。如是則英美汽車。立於同等地位。可以暢銷矣。各國對於幼稚工業之保障。幾無不採用是策。惟我國情形。略有不同。關稅尚未達到完全自主之目的。目前之稅則。仍爲協定的。故汽車製造以後。成本不能與外貨抵敵時。關稅不能救濟。亦自陷於失敗地位而已。三曰人材缺乏也近世工業。首重生産合理化。即一切管理方針。當以最經濟之方式爲依歸。所謂科學管理是也也。科學管理。以得人爲第一要義。當歐戰開始時。美國最著名之金剛石牌火柴公司總經理坦鐵尼司氏、曾負責主張凡大規模工廠之工作成績。若以百分數示其成分。則人事問題。須佔百分之九○·七五。其他問題（最重要者爲機器）僅佔百分之二·五。汽車工廠。當然爲大規模工廠之一。其有賴於人事。尤灼然可見。今日我國汽車工業之人材如何。自難樂觀。無人材即有大規模之工廠。辦理亦未必可。達於完善。此亦事實問題。不可忽視者也。　　自製汽車。旣有上述之三大困難。解决之道。當亦應爲吾人所熟慮。愚意可分爲若干步驟。第一步擇汽車原料中之可以自製者。如木材電池等。先行仿製。其必不可少之件。則自歐美輸入。抵華以後。由工廠裝配之。如此則價格方面。必可低減不少。以無線電話機而言。購零料裝配。與購全新者。相差至百餘元。汽車當猶不止此矣。第二步則由實業部曁各工業家興辦鋼鐵·玻璃·橡皮等工廠。以爲自製汽車之準備。經年累月。成本可與外來貨品相埒。則進一步即可以所有需用原料。盡歸本國供給。達於完全自造之域。至於人材方面。最初可借材異國。一方遣派工業學校畢業生赴國外研習。歸爲國用。此大概之準備方案也。　　抑尤有進者。我國地大物博。礦産尤富。藴藏多未開啓。苟能善爲興發。我國所産。當可供汽車應用而有餘。其次則歐美工人。工資甚昂。每週須美金十餘元。中國則生活程度較低。工資方面。可减低不少。要之。我國汽車之須自造。實爲不刋之論。顧茲事體大。非一蹴可就者。第一吾人須明瞭我國情形。與外國不可同而已。不第造車而已也。且宜顧及其成本。蓋成本足以影響其銷路也。明乎中國所處之境况。更進而圖漸進之策。先之以裝配。繼之以興辦工廠。如是而根基可立。汽車自製。亦不致徒托空言矣。質之明達。以爲何如。一九三二式新車又將問世　　黄影呆　　力使駕馭安全　　俾可駛車穩便　　採用全鋼車身　　外觀務求美麗　　荏苒光陰。一年易過。秋盡冬來。又將爲新車問世之期矣。目前歐美各廠。又在亟亟從事。計劃製造新車。然則一九三二式之新車。其構造方面。如何改進。必爲讀者所樂於先知也。因將各廠對於製造新雖之計劃。錄之以告本刋讀者。　新車之計劃以目前之情形。一九三二式新車。諸凡重要各點。因試騐之結果。與一九三一式新車。並無重大之改革。然各廠對於製造方面。莫不竭力從事。精益求精。一廠而有新計畫規定。則數星期後。他廠必從而效之。就事實而言。各廠工程師所定計畫。一九三二式新車之構造情形。本與一九三一式大同小異。並無重大區别。然改革之點。亦復不少。其中尤爲顯著者。則一九三二式新車之趨勢。集中於駕馭之安全。處置之易如。務使購車之人。萬分滿意。而對於外觀方面。亦頗注意。安置問題。須加改良。各廠備極注意。已在着手研究之中。惟構造方面。車輪雖仍採單獨跳動之法。然關於此點。並無改進之處。惟普通式半橢圓形之彈簧。已有極大之進步。而安置問題。因減震器力量之濃厚。較之往年。大有進步。此外改良之點。較爲明顯者。中引擎及底盤。行動之時。聲息較爲低小。是則確爲成功之表現。他如用純鋼製造車身。尤可減低聲息。任何磨擦之聲。均可因而消滅。美國各廠。近來近産車輛。活輪車佔數日多。蓋社會方面。對於活輪之優點。已有相當之認識。惟英國方面。對於活輪車輛。尚不無懐疑之處。是故活輪汽車。在美國已到達最高之點。而在英國則製造活輪車者。僅佔少數也。此待英美兩地。中有大西洋相隔。處境不同。是以英國汽車。平日之銷路。仍與活輪車未發明前。毫無區别也。　　車身之構造八月之中。新車之進行計劃。雖未必十分活動。因各汽車廠。本以八月爲死月也　。然九月之初。各廠對於一九三二式新車。製造之計劃。已均在積極進行矣。其中最足令人注意之點。即各廠計劃。均在求新車外觀之美麗。車身之改進是也。紳鋼車身。行將風盛一時。此殆爲神秘之事也。車廠方面。對於車身之構造。雖尚無具體辦法。然顧客方面。已引頸長望。期新車之速即問世。此亦個性使然乎。即各廠對於車身之製造。形式方面。亦各自不同。有名廠二家　被等所擬車身。與舊車完全不同。相去甚遠。今日所有之車輛。行駛於街市中者。速率雖非常敏捷。然所有車身。新車行將盡行廢去。所存在者將爲數寥寥。此則實爲令人注目之點也。至於改革之入手方法。共分二種。一則完全集中於物質及科學兩方。憑過去之方法及經騐。使其在狂風之中行駛。亦未受任何影響。他如所飾線條。所漆顔色。亦務必使其合於理化。一則專以外觀方面。須使漂亮。俾引顧客之注意。而增加銷車之數量。他如式樣方面。亦有新頴之發展。或則迎合個性。或則仿照舊車。或則完全改新。是故一九三二式之新車花樣繁多。行將得未曾有。而主要原理。不外編於上述二者也。車身所飾條線。各自不同。對於車輛形式方面。具有特殊之關係。而要亦予車廠方面。作爲競爭之工具也。　　汽油之消費觀乎各汽車廠。近來所刋印之目錄。及其他報章雜誌。所有宣傳文字。對於燃料問題。備極注意。一九三二式之新車。對此問題。亦有相當注意。乃必然之事也。汽車之新由廠中製成者。一加倫汽油可行路三十哩。一千哩路程之滑油消費。僅一加倫。諸如此類之文字。我人已見憤矣。蓋車主對於燃料之消費。視爲重要問題。而對於車輛本身之價值。即以汽油之消費爲標準。惟頗通之車輛。汽油之消耗。與速率之比例。每不能與所定標準相同。此實爲不幸之事也。即車主方面。亦大都不能利用汽車本身之能力。使燃料之消費。合於最經濟之原理。於是購車之人。每因而减少信仰。最近美國汽車事業領袖某大車廠。由汽車競賽會指導之下。曾舉行汽車競賽。以實騐燃料之消費問題。競賽之時。曾用不同樣之汽車十七輛。試騐結果。全程長一千哩。共賽二次。每小時行路三十哩。十七輛汽車。大約每加倫汽油。可行路自一三·一五至一二·九四哩。如每小時行路五十五哩。則每加倫可行路一二·二四至一一·零八哩。每小時行三十哩者。共行二千哩。平均每小時。每加倫汽油行一三·零五哩。每小時五十五哩者行五千哩。平均每小時每加倫汽油行一零·五三哩。在每小時行路三十哩之上。加增二十五哩。同時汽油之消費。亦增加百分之一九·二一。是故從嘗試結果。知車行愈速。汽油之消費率愈高。而速度最高之時。其汽油之不經濟。更見較平時爲甚也。同時在賽車之時。用同樣之滑油。每小時行路三十哩者。每千哩路程。耗油四分之一加倫。每小時五十五匹者。行路千哩費滑油五·九加倫。由上文所述。可知汽車行駛愈速。費油愈多。關於此點。已有充分之證明。無可否認。而駕車之人。如欲達到最高速率汽油無可節省·乃彼等對於此種原理。竟完全不知。行車務使神速。而汽油過費。則必責難廠方製車之不良。豈不謬乎。故一九三二式新車。燃料之消費。均以每小時行三十哩爲標準。　　行車之安全近來歐美各國。較大之城市中。對於路政一事。異常注意。而各種行車規則。尤見嚴密。且時有新例令行。行車之人。凡不諳規則者。每易爲警察所阻。然以汽車之本身而言。製造之精良。附件之完備。駕駛之穩便。統馭之易如。凡此種種。亦在在均可使行車安全。免除肇禍事件。是以美國各汽車廠。當此一九三二式新車。計劃進行之初。曾將各地行車規則。編成一書。用以參考。俾可造成完美之汽車。如車燈之明亮。制動之有力。均可减少禍患。保持安全。故各汽車廠。莫不萬分注意。以冀所産新車。能適應各地之環境。不抵觸行車規程。八月份之美國造車業虞　　邇來各業衰落。歐洲經濟狀况大受打擊。出産多。銷路少。貨物壅滯。週轉不靈。幾於百物皆然。汽車製造業雖無顯著之衰落趨勢。然而影響所及。要亦不自處於例外。所謂經濟上的不景氣。幾於到處可聞。而不能有所偏袒也。美國之汽車銷路。本年度未能超越往歲。此係多數人所公認者。故以最近而論。各廠造車雖互有消長之處。然執中以論之。大半出數較稀。未能視爲旺盛之月也。　　據地屈落傳來消息。七月份之汽車出産統計。現下尚未完竣。但據一般人之推</p>

<p>測。則其成績殊未可樂觀。即事前之估計數目。本已就其折中辦法假設者。恐亦未能達到。其尤進一層者。則竟謂所差之數目。不但甚細。抑且大相懸殊。若與五月六月之出産統計比較。必且令人失望。預言者之言語如此。雖未可必其正確可靠。然大勢如此。要亦不能謂爲信口空談也。若以八月份而言。則其所造之汽車數目。亦未必能有所超越於前。而成特殊之高紀錄。此亦未必好爲危言者之推測因七八月兩個時期。在汽車的歷史製造業上。常爲出産低落之特徵時期。加以今年之種種遠因近故。其爲尋常之靜沉月份。殆可以必。出産旣較短少需要自不踴躍。相連帶。互有關係。斯則更無用其詞費矣不過上述之情形。亦祇就大概的局面而言之耳。非謂一廠如是而必廠廠如是也。又非謂一家銷路較遜。而他家出品亦必隨減也。故其中亦自有若干廠家。高聲呼喚。大肆活動。宣告於衆。用盡方法。以求出産之增。俾能供給顧客之殷需。此言驟聆之或以爲過甚之詞。然而事實如斯。並非虛言也。不僅如是已也　。尚有樂觀主義者流。因其出産較豐。深信不疑秋季之購買時期一屆。銷路必旺。厥成可以坐而待之。不過八月份之將爲本年最低産額時期。似在可能之中。所未能遽下斷詞者。則以當視福特之舉動爲轉移也。苟其洛絡河工廠之休息兩星期。或較長之時期見諸實施。則其八月份之約數出産二二五、○○○輛汽車。必致一跌而爲一五○、○○○輛。茲者休業之令。尚未頒下。如果繼續工作。不令中斷者。則其令人驚奇。又可斷言也。　　最近廉值汽車之廠家。其情形又少有不同之處。縱其出産之貨品較低於五六兩月。然夏盡秋來。又當努力。九十兩月必有轉機。需要旣殷。工作自力。今姑以各廠於八月份中之估計出産開列於下。雪佛蘭七○·○○○輛。通用分部包括雪佛蘭言。汽車及運貨車共爲一○○·○○○輛。克雷斯勒約爲四○·○○○輛。其中三○·○○○輛將爲最近宣佈之順風牌汽車。　　除上述諸家之外各廠。所取步驟又各不同。有幾廠將於月中暫時進停工。有幾家則續漸將出産减少。以便另造新車。供秋季之需要。綜計是月之出産額。當合計在三○·○○○輛。與三五·○○○輛間。如以福特之六○、○○○輛併行加入。則八月份之汽車出産當在二二三·○○○輛矣。此數並不細少。蓋將令今年爲二·七○○·○○○之數也。但此則全視福特之進行如何。作爲全體之衰盛轉移。　　基上述各點而論。八月份之出産。大部份未必有所特出之徵象。然少數廠家之活動。亦足以使全部之出産稍着生氣。不過出産雖較少。亦有其當然之利益在。此係往年經騐之談。一九三一年亦不致成爲例外。目下美國所用之汽車。較一年前約爲百萬輛左右。其中有多數之汽車年齡旣大。殊不適於行路之用。故至少有百分之十不能繼續使用。而其餘之九○○·○○○輛主人。因其車之陳廠。當亦有添置新車之想也。統計上海法租界六年來汽車統計沛甘　　汽車數目逐年增加　　肇禍事件相互並進　　上海法租界工部局警務處。最近發表六年來。界内汽車及汽車肇禍事件之增加統計表。茲分述如次。此次該局所佈之圖表。計共四紙第一圖述一九二五年至一九三零年之六年中。法租界之汽車增進數。第二表所記者爲爲貨汽車之加增數。其時間亦與第一圖相同。第三圖爲機器脚踏車統計表。自一九二五年起至一九三零年止。此六年中以一九二八年之數目爲最鉅。其後即逐漸减低。其緣由大概因該局採取必需之機搆考騐條例以測駕駛者。而數目遂見低少。第四國示六年來汽車肇禍之統計。咸有數目字可稽。法租界近年來居民日增。汽車數亦逐年較前增多。故此六年來。汽車肇禍慘案雖年有增長之勢。受傷及喪失生命者。年增一年。然自大體之人口車輛比較上言。則顯有减低之趨勢。自肇禍統計表觀之。法租界於一九二五年中。因汽車肇禍而喪失生命者。計二十九人。同時受汽車撞傷者四百十一人。次年即一九二六年。死於汽車下者增至三十三人。受傷者五百五十一人。但在此時間中。汽車及運貨汽車之增加數。亦相互並長。一九二五年爲一·九三三輛。至一九二六年即增至二·六四九輛、其增加竟至百分之八十有奇。運貨汽車於此時亦已增至六百四十一輛。然此項增加之車輛數。與法租界之人口增加相比所差尚遠。故肇禍之數目雖增鉅。而實際上則不啻减少也。當時警務人員鑒於車輛肇禍之事態嚴重。爲防患未來起見。不時召集會議。以求安全之道。自一九二八年以來。法租界警務當局每月例有會議。俾汽車肇禍事件。得以减少。故雖數目上肇禍事件年有增加。然警務人員則因與比率相較。已見趨减之勢。頗引爲慰。自此項會議實行以來。一九二八年之成效頗爲顯著。當時雖汽車之數增至三·二九七輛。而肇禍事件則减至五百二十四起。又死亡人數自一九二六年之三十三人增至一九二八年之四十二人。而因車輛肇禍受傷者。數亦減低。但自一九二八年以來。近數年間爲汽車肇禍而喪失生命者。數又增加。一九三零年死於汽車下者計四十六人。受傷者五百九十二。若今年則其數或當更增云。機器脚踏車常爲管理交通之警務人員所壓惡。其危害於男女老幼幾乎隨時隨地可以發生。若生手或不諳機構之駕駛人。其爲禍之烈尤難設想。至於熟手駕駛。則轉輾自如。可無他　虞。一九二五年時法租界之機器脚踏車數祇九十四輛。一九二六年增加四輛。至一九二八年一躍而爲一百四十二輛。其時警務處實行專門考騐。另頒管理條例。自後生手及不諳駕駛相者大爲淘汰。直至目下其數銳减。乃爲一百十八輛。然如管理得法。其爲用亦可與汽車相埒。似無必要之减少理由也。各圖表之計數如次（一）汽車統計表。一九二五年。一、九三三輛。一九二六年。二、六四九輛。一九二八年。三、二九七輛。一九三零年。四、四六七輛。（二）運貨汽車統計表。一九二五年、一百十八輛。一九二六年。六百四十一輛。一九二八年。一千零十輛。一九三零年一千七百六十六輛。（三）機器脚踏車統計表。一九二五年。九十四輛。一九二六年。九十八輛。一九二八年一百四十二輛。一九三零年一百十八輛。（四）汽車肇禍表。一九二五年。死亡數二十九人。受傷者四百十一人。一九二六年。死亡數三十三人。受傷者五百五十一人。一九二八年。死亡數四十二人。受傷者五百二十四人。一九三零年。死亡數四十六人。受傷者五百九十二人。譯叢海外汽車零拾虞　　紐約汽車外之馬匹紐約城中汽車充斥。車輛來往無一而非馬托者。常人心中以爲馬匹當盡歸淘汰矣。孰知事實方面殊不盡然。據最近之馬匹統計觀之。自一九二四年以來紐約城中尚有二二、一五六匹馬。此項馬匹大都係商運所用。然據統計者稱其中有一千七百二十九匹馬實係供人乘騎者云。　、　、加省築路十年計劃美國加利福尼亞州。地極富庶。一九三零年中曾添築或改進之州公路計共五百五十英里。若其他之二十八州則其築路之數尚不止此。以加省之人口及汽車數爲比言。其公路之添築及增進。如與其他各州人口若仿者比較。尚覺有遜。故其費用及經費方面亦較他州爲低。現爲增進公路計已定有十年之築路計劃。其時間以一九四零年爲止。預定之維持經費約需三六五·○○○·○○○美金。至其收入之路稅照現在之定律論。約有三二○·○○○○○·○○○元。　　兩州訂定汽車新律美國本薛文尼亞州及加利福尼亞州對於管理汽車又訂新律。在本薛文尼亞之一等二等城中。如有汽車攔路停靠不合法者。得由公家收押爲儆。又凡購置舊車者。必先呈請當局騐視後。始能頒發執照及註冊·加利福尼亞之汽車速率限止。已自每小時四十英里增至四十五英里。　　納許汽車獲得錦標希臘雅典城近舉行汽車爬山比賽。參加者共汽車三十二輛。結果冠軍亞軍均爲納許汽車所獲。其首奬之速率爲十一分鐘。登山之上斜度爲十二基羅米達。山名派尼士。主持此比賽者則爲雅典汽車俱樂部。二奬之納許其速率爲十一分鐘四十一秒。參加比賽之三十二種汽車各種式樣均有之。小者如飛霞脫之兩座汽車。大者則如茂賽第士及胖加笛等。　　英人負擔車稅特重不列顚人民所負擔之汽車稅。較之任何國家爲重。而近來又有謡傳。謂此汽車之稅尚須增加。若以現　之車稅與各種比較。英人所付者不下爲人之兩倍。此蓋就其最近之鄰國法蘭西言也。英國尚年之汽車稅大約爲一百四十元。法國約爲八十元。意大利約七十五元。德意志六十五元。加拿大三十元。美國合衆國則爲二十元。故以英國與美國相較。英人所付之車稅不啻爲美之五倍。若僅與加利福尼亞比則竟爲六倍矣。英國徵稅之法以馬力爲單位計算。每匹馬力須付五金。其超過十分之一馬力者。亦以一匹計。宣眞重耳。消息一週間汽車肇禍記三原日期地址　汽車號碼　受傷人　傷勢　最後情形七日　大興街　運貨汽車　張阿三　碾傷左足　送院醫治八日　非而路　三七九四　小孩三名　死一男孩　傷者送院醫治九日　黄浦灘　一七○一九　周徐氏　碾傷要害　醫治無效身死十日　鴨綠路　一六八一二　二　周姓男孩　重傷身死　候屬認　十二日　民國路　某號　楊良生　左足輕傷　自投醫院求治十三日　嘉興路　某號　江北小孩　手足輕傷　由父送院醫治一週間之汽車肇禍。共有六起。内因重傷身死者。計婦人一名。男孩兩名。重傷男孩二名。手足輕傷者。計男子一人。男孩一名云。</p>

<h3>Extraordinary Meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council Opens</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Le Roulx of Spain Returns Home Due to Business; Briand Appointed Acting Chairman; British Representative Reports on Japanese Military Atrocities; Shi Zhaoji Delivers Stirring Speech</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to a Madrid dispatch, Spanish Foreign Minister and Acting Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Le Roulx, could not attend today's League of Nations Administrative Council meeting because of important matters pending in his country's parliament. According to a New York dispatch, Secretary of State Stimson has cabled American Consul General to Geneva, Gilbert, that if invited to participate in the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, he may attend. It is expected that Gilbert will be invited, and if so, the American representative will be attending the Administrative Council for the first time. According to a London dispatch, the Far Eastern situation is becoming increasingly serious, and there is talk that Prime Minister MacDonald may return to London on Thursday. A Reuters reporter interviewed a representative of the British delegation this morning before an informal meeting, who said, "We are currently optimistic, because this matter must find a solution." The informal meeting convened at 10:00 AM. It is said that the representatives of the five major powers participating in this meeting have discussed ways to deal with the Sino-Japanese problem. It is reported that the Administrative Council will seek a formal guarantee from the Japanese government that there will be no further acts of war in Manchuria. Any proposals made here must first be agreed upon by the Chinese and Japanese governments before the dispute can be resolved. However, China's willingness to hand this matter over to international authorities and Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara's advocacy of peace can be seen as the beginning of a solution. At the last Administrative Council meeting, diplomatic officials from several major powers did not attend. For this reason, Far Eastern countries may have felt that Europe was not paying special attention to what was happening in Asia. Now, the attendance of British Foreign Secretary Reading and American observer Gilbert at the special meeting will surely be welcomed. The public meeting of the Administrative Council opened at noon, with a large audience. At the opening ceremony, Spanish Ambassador to the United States Madariaga chaired, and then invited French Foreign Minister Briand to be the chairman of the Administrative Council meeting, replacing Spanish Foreign Minister Le Roulx. Briand took the chair and delivered a speech, outlining the development of Sino-Japanese negotiations since the adjournment of the previous Administrative Council on September 30. He said that the Administrative Council was originally scheduled to meet on the 14th, but at the request of Chinese representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji, it was changed to the 13th. A few days ago, Representative Shi informed League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond that he had received urgent telegrams of Japanese military offensive operations in Manchuria, such as the bombing of Jinzhou. The Japanese government also notified the Administrative Council of China's boycott of Japanese goods, but the Administrative Council learned that the Chinese government had issued a letter of advice and had taken measures to suppress the boycott. The boycott was taking place outside of Manchuria and there had been no loss of life. The Administrative Council hoped that China would maintain this attitude, as both sides should show calm and moderation. The Chinese government has submitted to the Administrative Council the proposal submitted by Chinese Minister to Japan Jiang Zuobin to the Japanese government, intending to urge the Japanese army in Manchuria to withdraw from areas outside the South Manchurian Railway Zone. The Japanese government's reply emphasized the necessity of direct negotiations between the two governments. At the same time, the U.S. government sent a note to the League of Nations, stating that it fully agreed with the actions of the Administrative Council and had sent two U.S. officials to Manchuria to inspect everything. Briand, having said this, invited Dr. Shi Zhaoji to speak. Dr. Shi rose and said that after China suddenly suffered an unexpected incident on the night of September 18, it applied to the League of Nations. Chinese territory has been occupied by foreign troops, and China has been the victim of violent acts. According to common sense, people would retaliate with violence out of anger, but China did not do so, but turned to the Geneva organization and entrusted its trust to the League of Nations, without reservation, and agreed to the resolution of the Administrative Council as a guide to its actions. At that time, it was hoped that the Japanese army in Manchuria could withdraw into the South Manchurian Railway Zone or outside the Chinese border around the 14th of this month. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army not only did not withdraw, but continued its violent acts, even bombing Jinzhou. The Chinese government, recognizing the seriousness of this violent act, had to request the League of Nations Administrative Council to convene another meeting as soon as possible. Dr. Shi then recounted China's application to the League of Nations and Chairman Chiang's declaration on September 22 (which stated that the Shenyang incident could prove two things: (1) whether there is justice in international affairs, and (2) whether the Chinese people can unite to resist armed aggression) and the remarks made by Chairman Chiang this month. He continued, saying that China had not resisted and had withdrawn its troops, maintaining a dignified and calm attitude, because China was a member of the League of Nations and placed its trust in the League of Nations. The League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact are the two great anchors to which our national boat is tied to resist the storms. We are confident that with this assistance, we can overcome the raging waves. The League of Nations Charter and the Anti-War Pact are the two great pillars of the world's peaceful edifice. If the pillars are broken, the edifice will collapse. May I ask, since all the countries of the world have seen the League of Nations Charter and the Anti-War Pact suffer a terrible defeat in the first great test and leave all kinds of evils in the East, will they still calmly gather in Geneva next February to discuss the issue of disarmament? If the League of Nations fails now, when the United States agrees to cooperate, and fails again at the Disarmament Conference next February, what opportunities will we have to achieve a permanent union or plan a conference based on the Anti-War Pact to remedy actions that harm world peace? If the world degenerates into suspicious nationalism, hateful alliances, and armed competition, and if the East is plunged into chaos, what opportunities do we still have to seek effective cooperation in the face of the financial and economic panic that oppresses the entire world? The disturbances in the Far East, viewed from the West, may seem far away and irrelevant, but the web of destiny binds us together, and we share prosperity and decline together. China has placed itself in the hands of the League of Nations, entrusting its future and cultural spirit and awaiting the outcome. The League of Nations must not fail, for the interests of all civilized countries, including the United States, China, and members of the League of Nations, are tied to the success of the League of Nations. While speaking, Dr. Shi's enthusiasm was evident in his words and expressions. After finishing his speech, applause erupted. The Administrative Council then announced that it would adjourn until 3:30 PM today, at which time the Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, would express his opinion. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council met this afternoon. First, Chairman Madariaga, French Foreign Minister Briand, British Foreign Secretary Reading, and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi successively arrived at the meeting. After the meeting began, Madariaga, on behalf of Spanish Foreign Minister Le Roulx, invited Briand to chair. Briand accepted and took the chair, delivering a short speech, saying that he believed the League of Nations would be able to achieve its main goal of maintaining peace in the face of this crisis. Subsequently, the British representative released a report from the British Consul in Tianjin, reporting that Japanese armored vehicles had arrived in Tongliao, and that Japanese soldiers had destroyed railroad tracks and used mines to bomb warehouses. He also said that the Japanese side had told the American Consul General in Shenyang that there were currently 2,000 troops south of the Manchurian Railway Zone. He also said that the Chinese side denied that Chinese soldiers had engaged in provocative acts when Japanese planes bombed Jinzhou, claiming that there were no anti-aircraft guns in the Chinese army at the time, and that they had not fired a single rifle. Then, Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji delivered a speech, which was extremely impassioned, strongly stating the necessity of the League of Nations to quickly resolve the Liaoning-Jilin incident. He said that if the League of Nations could not resolve this matter, the first result would be the collapse of the disarmament conference next year, and the second would be the disintegration of all international cooperation to safely overcome the financial and economic crisis if the Far Eastern disputes were not resolved. He also said, "I am speaking today with great indignation, and I am deeply afraid that I will make excessive remarks, so I will read a declaration carefully." The declaration stated that when the Council adjourned on September 30, it was originally hoped that the Japanese army would completely withdraw to within the South Manchurian Railway Zone before the 14th of this month, restoring the original state of Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Unexpectedly, during this period, the Japanese army had various acts of invasion, occupation, and violence. Its military activities extended far beyond the South Manchurian Railway Zone, far exceeding the area occupied on September 30. Therefore, the issue before the Council today is still the same, that is, the Japanese army must withdraw from Chinese territory. This action does not require evidence, nor does it need to wait for the restoration of Sino-Japanese relations. If our efforts here are unsuccessful, then there is no need to convene a disarmament conference next year, because if this conference fails to maintain peace, then countries will only rely on their own national power. If we fail now, even with the cooperation of the United States, then what opportunities do we still have to establish a permanent peace organization? Therefore, China now only hopes for the victory of civilized forces and to guarantee the foundation of disarmament." Shi also said, "The issue before us now is whether the international community can take collective action, or whether countries must still act on their own and defend themselves individually. China has chosen the path of collective action. It has issued strict orders to its own troops to do their best to avoid conflicts with the Japanese army, and it has also ordered civil officials to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. Several countries place their hopes in the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, recognizing the two as the cornerstone of world peace laid by twelve years of hard work. If we allow this cornerstone to collapse, then the peace of the whole world will also fall with it. China has completely entrusted the Liaoning-Jilin incident to the League of Nations, hoping that the League of Nations will be able to stop the Japanese military's violent acts, and deeply believes that the League of Nations will be able to guarantee peace in the Far East." Subsequently, Briand stated that since the previous meeting of the Council, the hopes placed in the guarantees given by both China and Japan had unfortunately not been realized. The Council had hoped that today's meeting could be dispensed with, but unexpectedly, the situation has become more and more serious. We value the efforts of both China and Japan, but they have both been ineffective. We especially hope that China will continue to comply with the order to its people to avoid loss of life. He then asked China and Japan to pay attention to the U.S.'s declaration of complete coordination with the League. After Briand finished speaking, the Council adjourned and would reconvene at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, at which time Japanese representative Yoshizawa would deliver a speech. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The organization of the League of Nations Council meeting to discuss the Manchurian issue, which will be convened tomorrow afternoon, has undergone important temporary changes. The chairman of the Council will be assumed by French Foreign Minister Briand, as the president of the Council, Spanish Foreign Minister Le Roulx, has been summoned back by Prime Minister Zamora due to important domestic political affairs en route. British Foreign Secretary Lord Reading, Lord Cecil, and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi are all expected to attend as scheduled. On the German side, as Baoluning, who also holds the position of head, is unable to spare time due to a domestic matter, Dr. Mutius will represent him. Many see Germany's failure to send an important official, Baoluning, to attend the meeting as proof that Germany intends to maintain a strict reserved attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute. On the American side, Swiss American Ambassador Wilson is not prepared to attend and will be represented by American Consul General to Geneva, Gilbert. Gilbert formally notified the League of Nations Secretariat tonight that Salisbury, Secretary of the American Embassy in Tokyo, and Hanson, American Consul in Harbin, have been instructed by the State Department and have obtained permission from the Chinese and Japanese authorities to go to South Manchuria to investigate and will submit a detailed report to the League of Nations Council. The Special Meeting of the Council will likely be held at the end of this week. Although observers and some League of Nations members are pessimistic, according to a semi-official League of Nations announcement tonight, the tense situation in the Far East is expected to be greatly reduced after preliminary exchanges of views by several of the Council's leading figures.

<p>(Geneva) After British Foreign Secretary Reading arrived in Geneva yesterday, he immediately set to work and had a long meeting with Representative Yoshizawa. People in Geneva are paying close attention to the statement made by the U.S. Secretary of State on the 9th to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that the U.S. is willing to assist in all resolutions of the League of Nations. A Reuters reporter learned that British Foreign Secretary Reading and Secretary-General Drummond have discussed the possibility of inviting an American representative to participate in the Administrative Council meeting because of this. It has now been decided not to invite a U.S. representative to attend the Administrative Council, but the committee of the Administrative Council can invite a U.S. representative to participate when considering the basis for a solution and making recommendations to the full meeting. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Before the formal meeting of the League of Nations Council, a secret meeting was held by the representatives of the five major powers: British Foreign Secretary Reading, French Foreign Minister Briand, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, Spanish representative Madariaga, and German representative Mutius, at 10:30 AM this morning. It was reported that it was originally intended to invite the American Consul General to Geneva, Gilbert, to attend the meeting of the five major powers as an observer, but it was later considered that this matter had to be voted on by the Council, so it was expected that the Japanese side would obstruct it, and it was not implemented. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Administrative Council adjourned at the end of September, it was thought that Japan had agreed to withdraw its troops to within the South Manchurian Railway Zone before the 14th of this month. At that time, the U.S. State Department was in contact with the League of Nations, and it was thought that the promise made by Japan was enough to calm public opinion. Recently, unexpected events have occurred from time to time, and China and Japan have made demands to each other in notes, which shows the seriousness of the situation in Manchuria. Indeed, since the Japanese troops have not been completely withdrawn, and the bombing of undefended cities is especially serious. After the Japanese representative spoke to the Administrative Council at the end of last month, Geneva thought that the Japanese troops would definitely withdraw and that the Chinese anti-Japanese movement would also be suspended. Unexpectedly, the trend of peace breaking down is imminent, and the Administrative Council cannot but convene a meeting quickly to maintain peace in an appropriate manner. The U.S. public also has this feeling. Frequent exchanges of views between Washington and Geneva recently show that the Sino-Japanese dispute may expand and must be stopped. The way to stop it lies in a clear attitude. Today, the League of Nations received another note from Stimson, which made this statement even more obvious. The world's peace depends on the Sino-Japanese dispute, and the world's economic and financial difficulties can be resolved smoothly, which also depends on this. Therefore, the powers are using their spiritual and political power to cooperate closely, so as to restore trust and seek to properly resolve the above difficulties one by one. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<h3>Statement by Our Representative to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Geneva telegram from the government, our representative made the following statements at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on the 13th:</p>
<p>First, it is declared that since the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council on September 30, our government has fully implemented the resolution in earnest. (1) The National Government has issued two clear orders to all government agencies on September 20 and October 7 to effectively protect the lives and property of foreigners and maintain order. The September 20 order specifically stated that in addition to effectively protecting the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in China, local governments have done their best to implement it effectively. During these ten days or so, although the people of the whole country were extremely sad and angry, they all advocated forbearance in any place and there was no excessive behavior. (2) Because the government hoped that Japan would accept the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council and implement the withdrawal of troops, it earnestly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, commander of the Northeast Border Defense, on the 2nd to quickly send personnel to be responsible for accepting the area where the Japanese army withdrew, and to effectively be responsible for restoring order. After Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuchang were appointed to take over, the matter was telegraphed to Minister Jiang stationed in Japan to notify the Japanese government and quickly telegraph the officers of the country occupying Liaoning and Jilin to comply with the order to completely withdraw and contact Zhang and Wang, who were sent by our country.</p>
<p>Second, it is declared that after the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Japan not only failed to fulfill its decision to withdraw troops and practice the statement of non-expansion declared by its government, but also continued to carry out various military actions in various places. (1) On October 3, in the Taonan area, more than 30 Japanese troops escorted military vehicle to supply bandits. (2) On the 2nd, the Japanese army transported more than ten ox carts of military equipment to the Liaoyuan area to supply Mongolian bandits. (3) On the 7th, five Japanese planes dropped many bombs in the Xinmin area, killing three people. (4) On the 10th, Japanese armored vehicles drove to Tongliao, destroying the railway and distributing leaflets, and notifying the people that landmines had been buried. (5) On the 8th, twelve Japanese planes attacked Jinzhou, dropping more than 70 bombs and strafing with machine guns, killing a Russian professor at Jiaotong University, a military engineer, and fourteen civilians, injuring more than 20, and distributing leaflets, severely criticizing our senior officials, instigating and coercing our people to break away from the country. (6) Since September 3, eight warships have been continuously added to the Yangtze River inland, and marines have been added, all demonstrating in Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and even Hankou, Daye and other places, adding four warships in the southern part of the Chinese sea, demonstrating in Wenzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou and other places. (7) Provoking and coercing local officials and gentry in various places in the Northeast to organize illegal political organs and carry out the destruction of China's administrative power. (8) On the 10th, Japanese planes flew and demonstrated in the Tangshan industrial area and other places. (9) Four Japanese warships went to Qingdao to demonstrate.

The driver saw that the rails on the bridge were blocked by stones. If he risked rushing over, it would cause a tragedy. He stopped the car. The bandits rushed out and fired shots to demonstrate. The train was pierced in many places by bullets. Several passengers were killed or injured. The bandits boarded the train and searched for robberies in turn, without anyone being spared.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>⊙ The Heavy Responsibility of the International Allied Powers</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Japanese army's atrocities on September 18th to the present, the Chinese nation and country have suffered unprecedented difficulties and threats. At the same time, the situation in the Far East is advancing towards a tragic future day by day, leading the world simultaneously onto the path of security and destruction. These facts are being demonstrated daily by the Japanese, whose atrocities in our Northeast are increasing unabated.</p>
<p>The League of Nations has reconvened to discuss a solution to this serious situation. The future can be gradually revealed in the telegrams in the next day or two. But we believe that the responsibility for resolving this serious situation rests not only with the League of Nations. The Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty should also stand up to this difficult task and make effective statements on the matter. We are deeply puzzled by the silence of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>Article 1 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact states: "The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another." Article 2 states: "The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means."</p>
<p>Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty states: "(1) To respect the sovereignty, the independence, and the territorial and administrative integrity of China; (2) To provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China to develop and maintain for herself an effective and stable government; (4) Neither to take advantage of conditions in China in order to seek special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens of friendly States, and from countenancing action inimical to the security of such States." Article 7 states: "The Contracting Powers agree that, whenever there shall arise a condition which in the opinion of any one of them involves the application of the stipulations of the present Treaty, and renders desirable discussion of such application, there shall be full and frank communication between the Contracting Powers concerned."</p>
<p>Today, the Japanese are not negotiating with our country through diplomatic channels to resolve the various issues in the Northeast, but are directly resorting to violence, waging war without declaration, which clearly violates the provisions of Article 1 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Japanese are using military force to disband our unresisting troops, occupy major cities in our Northeast, change flags, install officials, incite independence, declare their demands to maintain their special rights in the Northeast, and even use aircraft to drop bombs on our Jinzhou and send warships into our hinterland to coerce us, which clearly violates the provisions of Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the Kellogg-Briand Pact should enforce the provisions of Article 2, and the Nine-Power Treaty should enforce the provisions of Article 7, standing up to uphold the dignity of treaties and good faith. At this time, there is absolutely no room for hesitation or waiting.</p>
<p>The Chinese people dare to solemnly inform the friendly nations that signed the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, that the atrocities committed by the Japanese against China since September 18th are absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people are now willing to maintain calm in order to uphold the dignity of international treaties and await the friendly nations to jointly uphold the dignity of treaties and their own good faith so that the Northeast issue can be resolved peacefully and fairly. However, if the signatory nations shirk their responsibilities, fail to effectively guarantee the dignity of international covenants, fail to stop the development of the situation, and fail to restore China's complete sovereignty, territory, and administration, making those who abandon good faith and violate treaties bear their responsibilities, then the Chinese people will ultimately bear this unavoidable heavy responsibility based on the spirit of upholding the dignity of international covenants and seeking freedom for national survival, and will not shrink back. China is now in a position where it cannot control the advancement of the situation. Those who can control it are only the friendly nations that signed the international covenants. The Chinese people have the greatest determination and will calmly listen to the friendly nations' statements to fulfill their responsibilities. If not, they will prepare to accept the coming of inevitable serious events with an unwavering attitude.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Rejects Japanese Envoy's Memorandum</h3>
<p>Japanese Government Does Not Fulfill Promise to Withdraw Troops</p>
<p>Japanese Army Continues its Aggressive Actions</p>
<p>Japan Should Bear Full Responsibility if There are Unfortunate Consequences</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese government presented a memorandum on the 9th regarding the anti-Japanese movement in our country, making various unreasonable demands. The Central Special Diplomatic Committee has resolved to refute it with reason. The refutation was sent to the Japanese Consulate by Ma Changliang, a staff member of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 3:30 PM on the 13th, for transmission to Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese government's memorandum of the 9th of this month, the Chinese government hereby states its opinion as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese army, disregarding international law, violating the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Peace Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, suddenly invaded Chinese territory without provocation from the other party and occupied various places in Liaoning and Jilin provinces in China, overthrowing legitimate administrative organs of the provinces and counties, and engaging in various war-like acts during the invasion, as well as other actions that are not permitted by international law even in wartime, such as killing innocent people, bombing undefended cities, shooting at passenger cars, removing and confiscating public and private property, etc. Since China and Japan are both bound by the above-mentioned international treaties, and these treaties obligate the signatory countries to find ways to resolve all disputes by peaceful means, the Chinese government immediately submitted the matter to the League of Nations Council for handling. The Council resolved to request the Japanese government to order its troops to withdraw as soon as possible from the areas occupied since September 18th and decided to acknowledge the solemn assurance made by the Japanese government that it would abide by the Council's request, stipulating October 14th as the date for reconvening if the above-mentioned assurance could not be fulfilled at that time. Since the initial occurrence of the incident, the Chinese government has not taken any hostile actions, and although the provocative actions of the Japanese army have become increasingly fierce and widespread, it has still done its utmost to strictly order its troops not to offer any form of resistance to the continued advance of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>At the same time, it has imposed a strict discipline on the whole country, doing its best to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents in Chinese territory under Chinese administrative authority. The fact that no unfortunate incidents have occurred anywhere in the vast territory under Chinese jurisdiction is sufficient to prove that China has meticulously complied with the assurances it made to the League of Nations Council. The government has repeatedly issued orders and proclamations to restrain the legitimate indignation of our people so as not to overstep the bounds of the law. On October 7th, the Chinese government again ordered local officials to "be responsible for protecting the lives and property of all foreigners and to strictly prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to incite actions that go astray," which shows that the government's admonitions are becoming stronger and more forceful. The promulgation of this clear order coincided with the time when the Japanese government failed to fulfill its promise to withdraw troops with extraordinary explicitness.</p>
<p>The Chinese government, in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations Council, appointed two senior officials to receive the withdrawn areas and formally notified the Japanese government and the League of Nations Council of this matter. However, the Japanese government has not yet implemented its expressed intention to return the occupied areas to Chinese officials, and according to the reports of neutral observers, Shenyang, Jilin, Dunhua, Juliuhe, Xinmin, and Tianzhuangtai are still under the occupation of the Japanese army. At the same time, these troops continue to kill and injure innocent civilians and destroy property for no reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, the indignation of the Chinese people is limited to not buying Japanese goods, which is surprising to the whole world. The freedom to choose personal purchases is an individual right that no government can interfere with. The government has the responsibility to protect the lives and property of foreign people. However, there is no recognized rule or principle of international law that requires the government to prohibit or punish the exercise of the citizen's preliminary rights. If there is any responsibility for this matter, then the responsibility should be fully borne by Japan. Since the Wanbaoshan incident, the Japanese government has created a general aversion to Japanese goods through its many unfriendly actions.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has complied with the resolution of the League of Nations Council in the strictest manner, meticulously protecting the lives and property of Japanese people, and curbing various actions that could make the situation more serious. As a result, no Japanese people have encountered any unfortunate incidents so far, as mentioned above. At this time, the Japanese army is continuing its aggressive actions in the Eastern Provinces, and even recently used aircraft to bomb Jin County, the temporary office of the civil servants in Liaoning Province after it was occupied, from Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province. This kind of military action, as the Japanese government knows well, caused the League of Nations Council to decide to bring forward the originally scheduled meeting date. The Chinese government expresses satisfaction with the Japanese government's citation of the responsibility of both countries to the League of Nations, but declares that in the last ten days, the Japanese side is responsible for all kinds of actions that have made the situation more serious, resulting in the failure to implement the resolution of the League of Nations Council. The Chinese government does not bear the responsibility for this. Although the Chinese government is in an extremely difficult position due to the continuous aggressive actions of the Japanese army, it is still doing its best to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. However, if Japan still uses military force as an instrument of its national policy, and if there are any unfortunate consequences as a result, especially when the governments of both countries have submitted the case to the League of Nations Council and the League of Nations Council has stipulated the course of action that both countries should follow, the Japanese government should bear full responsibility. The Chinese government firmly believes that the emotional estrangement between the people of China and Japan and the difficulties in trade between the two countries are all natural consequences of the illegal actions of the Japanese army. It believes that if the Japanese government can work hard to find ways to eliminate the causes of this situation, it will have good results in improving relations between the two countries and maintaining peace in East Asia and the world.

<h3>Japan's Statement to the United States</h3>
<p>Concealing Aggressive Behavior</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador Debuchi again visited U.S. Secretary of State Stimson and Undersecretary of State Castle today, and met with the Washington newspaper correspondents' group, reiterating Japan's policy on the Liaoning-Jilin incident. He solemnly stated that Japan has absolutely no intention of acquiring Chinese territory. When he met with Stimson and Castle, he detailed Japan's position in the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute, saying that he deeply believed that war would not break out between China and Japan.

<h3>Certain Party Member Suggests Specific Measures Against Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Someone from the Party has suggested specific measures against Japan, preparing step by step, roughly saying that our country has always been regarded as weak and incompetent by foreigners. Now that the violent Japan has forcibly occupied Southern Manchuria, if we sit idly by and do not resist, we will be even more despised by other countries. Our great country has an extremely low international status. If we want to avenge this national hatred and raise our international status, we can only burn our boats and make a desperate gamble. Knowing that it is impossible, we must do it. Even if we fail and perish, we will surely gain international sympathy and win honor for the nation. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>National Telegrams Three</p>
<h3>Relying on Power, Disregarding Justice</h3>
<p>American Newspapers Disapprove of Japanese Actions</p>
<p>New York According to the National News Agency's New York branch, the opinions of various newspapers here today regarding the Liaoning-Jilin incident can be exemplified by the following newspapers. The New York World Telegram, which belongs to the Scripps-Howard chain, said that Washington sources believe that the United States and the League of Nations have made a big mistake by being too concerned when dealing with the Manchurian situation, which has been seen by the Japanese as weakness and has been manipulated by the Japanese militarists. We also agree with this view. Washington officials now admit that the future of international peace mechanisms is in a state of life and death. If the Japanese General Staff succeeds in Manchuria, the Kellogg-Briand Pact will become waste paper, the League of Nations will lose its usefulness, and the Nine-Power Treaty will be equal to a mere formality. The world will return to the situation in 1914, where might is right and countries will only rely on great armaments. It also said that in order to save the world's peace mechanisms, we believe that the U.S. government should act immediately in accordance with the treaties. The New York Evening Post commented on the Japanese aircraft bombing of Jinzhou, saying that although the Japanese cabinet did not approve of this move, it did not discuss punishing Commander Honjo. The Japanese cabinet is being pressured by the army, so all actions must be in accordance with the wishes of the military. The national affairs of Japan are being controlled by the militarists. The so-called civilian politicians in the cabinet either do not participate in their plans or secretly indulge them. But we cannot allow the cunning and semi-barbaric Japanese military to seize Manchuria while the United States is reducing its navy by 20 percent. The New York Sun Evening News advised Secretary of State Stimson to cooperate with the League of Nations. It sarcastically said that no one in the League of Nations should make things difficult for Secretary of State Stimson. May I ask why the United States is privately complying with the League of Nations charter? No one will disrupt Secretary of State Stimson or authorize him to combine the League of Nations' progress and purpose with the precise organization of U.S. foreign policy. The World Telegram proposed that the U.S. government should abandon its usual policy of tolerance towards the Manchurian situation. Now that Japan is violating treaties and waging a war of aggression against China, the United States, as a signatory, should act immediately in accordance with the treaties to save the world's peace mechanisms.

<h3>Japan Prepares to Organize a National Government</h3>
<p>Can the Current Cabinet Crisis Be Avoided?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In the past two days, influential leaders and jurists, such as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Count Makino, former prime ministers Kiyoura, Yamamoto, Takahashi, and Seiyukai leader Inukai Tsuyoshi, have visited each other and met with Prime Minister Wakatsuki. It is said that Kiyoura plans to go to Kyoto to visit the only genro, Prince Saionji. After the president of the South Manchuria Railway, Count Uchida, arrives in Tokyo tonight for a meeting, he plans to depart. According to observers, this scene of extraordinary activity seems to indicate that Japan will organize a national government to replace the current government in order to effectively respond to the current Sino-Japanese situation and serious financial problems. However, according to other well-informed sources, the important figures have decided that it is unwise to reorganize the cabinet at this time. Therefore, they have urged the Seiyukai to support the Wakatsuki cabinet, or at least not to make things difficult for it. After the crisis has passed and the overall situation has stabilized, the Minseito will transfer power to the Seiyukai. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

According to reliable sources, the government will soon convene an important national political conference. Yesterday's visits by the Prime Minister to three former prime ministers were probably related to this. The cabinet crisis seems to be temporarily avoided due to the Prime Minister's efforts to communicate with all parties. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>German Parliament Reopens</h3>
<p>Berlin, October 12th. Six months after the adjournment of the National Assembly, during which important changes have taken place in the political situation, it will reconvene tomorrow, and all sectors attach great importance to it. The coming days will be a critical juncture for the German political situation. The National Assembly will convene today on the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month after the election, which superstitious people regard as an ominous sign. However, the Prime Minister, Brüning, does not believe in superstition. Officials deeply believe that although the National People's Party opposes the new cabinet, Brüning still has a chance of winning. The attitude of the Social Democratic Party is unclear, but it can also be expected to assist Brüning. It is heard that after Brüning's speech in the National Assembly tomorrow, he will move to adjourn, so that the parties in the middle can consider their position. This motion will inevitably be rejected by the opposition party. If the opposition party's wishes are fulfilled, it will gain an important initial victory. If Brüning is defeated, the opposition party will no longer have hope of victory.</p>
<p>Berlin, October 13th. The National Assembly reopened this afternoon. All around the National Assembly, a large number of police were stationed early in the morning to maintain strict guard. Anyone from the opposition party who wanted to speak to the public was immediately dispersed. The visitors' seats in the National Assembly were full by 10:00 AM, and the rest of the crowd was still waiting outside the back door, unwilling to disperse. At noon, the first batch of deputies arrived at the meeting. The members of the National Socialist Party in brown uniforms, who had withdrawn from the Council Chamber eight months ago, were seen again today coming together, and some of the crowd welcomed them with cheers, and they responded with the Nazi salute. Later, when Prime Minister Brüning drove to the meeting, the enthusiasm of the crowd's welcome was unprecedented. After the National Assembly opened today, the first item on the agenda was to read out the new cabinet's declaration.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Delivers Campaign Speech</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, October 12th. British Prime Minister MacDonald has begun his campaign in his constituency. In a speech in Easington today, he detailed the reasons for his disagreement with his old colleagues in the Labour Party, and said: "Labour is in my blood and bones, I live for the Labour Party and will die for the Labour Party." He also said, "We do not want to drive young workers' movements into making them into machines. I want freedom of thought and an independent mind. If I cannot breathe freely without following the predetermined methods, who would be willing to serve the Labour movement?" The audience was quite large. Although the Labour Party has put forward another candidate, not everyone will vote for MacDonald. However, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party are not competing with him, so even if MacDonald loses many Labour Party votes, he can get votes from other parties. At a meeting of the National Liberal Club, former Foreign Secretary Grey spoke in support of MacDonald, advising Liberal candidates to stand on one side so that the Labour Party and Conservative Party in the National Government can compete directly with the opposition Labour Party. Grey also endorsed the National Government's policy, saying that the possibility of the world being troubled and entangled has greatly increased. It is not appropriate to ask the government for a fixed policy, which would bind its power to adapt to circumstances.</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Germany at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Berlin, October 12th. It is expected that Italian Foreign Minister Grandi will visit Germany on the 25th of this month in response to the German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to Italy and will also visit President Hindenburg.</p>
<p>Rome, October 12th. According to Italian newspapers, Prime Minister Mussolini has drafted a complete program to solve the world's political and economic difficulties, to be presented to President Hoover by Italian Foreign Minister Grandi when he arrives in the United States. The content is unknown, but many believe that Mussolini advocates linking the cancellation of reparations and war debts with next year's disarmament conference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cash Continues to Flow Out</h3>

<h3>The Tragic Situation of Japanese Planes Bombing Jinzhou</h3>
<p>Jinxian Correspondence: Since the Liaoning Provincial Government was established in Jinzhou, the Japanese side has been deliberately sabotaging it to fulfill its ambition of completely swallowing the Northeast. The four grenades thrown at the Dongda Camp last time were almost a prelude to a demonstration. At that time, although the people of Jinzhou were panicked for a while, they soon returned to normal. After the recent organization of the provincial government, even if it is a partial and temporary peace, the people have more to rely on, and they are no longer as chaotic and frightened as in the last ten days of last month. However, on the 8th of this month, suddenly twelve Japanese planes</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>flew to Jinzhou to drop bombs, creating another terrifying situation. After the incident, the reporter conducted a detailed investigation with all relevant parties and learned that the Japanese planes departed from Yingkou at 1:20 pm on that day (the 8th) and came to Jinzhou. Only one plane arrived at the beginning, circling in the sky to explore and observe. Then nine planes flew in successively in three batches, each with three planes. The time between each arrival in Jinzhou was only a few minutes. Finally, two more planes came. After all the planes gathered in the sky over Jinzhou before 2:15 pm, they began their violent work in the area of Jiaotong University (the new site of the provincial government) and the Beining Road Station. The first bomb fell on the southeast corner of Jiaotong University, destroying several windows and glass. The second bomb fell in a clock shop west of the Governor's Office. The third bomb fell on the west side of the station, damaging a locomotive parked there. Other bombs fell on Dongda Camp, the headquarters of the 12th Brigade, the post office next to the station, and near the Second Middle School in the southeast corner of the county seat. A total of more than forty bombs were dropped one after another. For a time, residents fled in panic, not knowing what to do. The sound of exploding bombs and the cries of the people almost merged into one. Fortunately, the city was spared, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable. The Japanese planes' bombing lasted for an hour, and then they flew northeast along the Beining Line. The people who were killed and injured in this bombing have been identified. Wang Chuntian, Hu Yunhan, Su Peisheng, Xian Yude, and Liu Maoling, residents of the Daoyao Sub-district, were all injured and died immediately. Liu Luohan, a resident of the Donglu Sub-district, had his left and right arms blown off. Guo Ziyang had his right leg blown off and his head shattered. Both died tragically within an hour of being bombed. The woman Duan Sun's head was bombed, and her brains burst out. Guo Wu's whole body was almost minced. All died on the spot. In addition, Tu Guilin, Li Qinglian, Wang Zhongwu, Wang Xizi, Cao Youting, and the woman Yang Zhang, residents of the Tiedao North Sub-district, were all seriously injured and died on the spot. Chen Zheng, a resident of the Beilu Sub-district, had his head blown open and died immediately. This is just for those whose names are known. There are many others whose names are unknown. In addition, among those seriously injured, there was a Russian professor from Jiaotong University in the Daoyao Sub-district, as well as Long Chaode, a resident of that area, whose waist was injured, Sun Changyou, whose right leg was injured, and the woman Long Wang, whose right arm and face were injured, all to varying degrees. A woman surnamed Huang, a resident of the Tiedao North Sub-district, also suffered a severe injury to the heel of her right foot. Duan Baoquan, a resident of the Donglu Sub-district, had his entire face injured, and the woman Guan Liu had her leg injured. There were four others, whose names are unknown. As for the damage to houses, it is still under investigation. After the incident, the injured people were all given emergency treatment by the county government and sent to various hospitals for treatment. At the same time, the county government, together with the Public Security Bureau, led photographers to take photos at each bombed location. The Russian professor from Jiaotong University died in Yingji Hospital the next day (the 9th) due to his injuries. After the Japanese planes bombed, the county government telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang to report, and issued announcements to stabilize the people's hearts and restore normalcy. However, the general residents were still afraid that the Japanese planes would come again. In order to avoid innocent harm, they all moved away one after another, and many went west along the Beining Line. For a time, passengers crowded the station, which was extremely congested. At present, the authorities in Jinzhou are still maintaining a calm attitude and working as usual. Merchants and civilians are also slightly more stable. The county government also issued a notice to merchants and civilians on the 9th on how to avoid bombs, advising them to dig cellars in their yards to avoid danger. The purpose of the Japanese planes' bombing in Jinzhou this time was to destroy the provincial government and the Frontier Defense Headquarters, but in the end, neither suffered any losses. The victims were only innocent people and postal transportation. After the Japanese army occupied Shenyang and other places, the people of western Liaoning were extremely angry, but there was no active expression. This move by the Japanese planes only promoted the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people, turning it from mild to tense. It is said that when the Japanese planes bombed Jiaotong University that day, Mi Chunlin had just returned from bathing. Mi, who had been in the military for a long time, was not afraid. Just as he arrived at the yard and stepped on the stone steps, a Japanese plane dropped a bomb, only a few dozen feet away. Mi still calmly moved forward. Fortunately, he was pulled back by his guard, avoiding danger. Provincial Party Committee members Xing Shilian and Peng Jiqun were both at their desks at the time. Shattered glass flew like snowflakes. Neither avoided. Xing went to Ping by night train with Zhang Zhenlu that night to visit Zhang and report. Jinzhou's legal organizations sent a telegram to the League of Nations, the Executive Yuan, and the ambassadors of various countries to China, asking them to inform the Japanese authorities to take into account humanitarianism and to maintain international personality.

<h3>The Story of Wang Yizhe's Troops Escaping Danger</h3>
<p>Jinxian Correspondence: Since the Japanese army invaded and occupied Liaoning and Jilin, the whereabouts of all the soldiers of the 7th Brigade of the Northeast Infantry, originally stationed in the Beida Camp, have been erratic and their news unclear. After the reporter came east, he heard that Wang Yizhe, the brigade commander, had arrived in Jinzhou the day before. After many inquiries, he finally found his address. So he went to visit at 11 am on the 10th. According to his account of the situation of the incident that day and the process of the troops escaping danger, although it is yesterday's news, the facts are indeed certain, which readers will be happy to hear. Before visiting Wang, I first visited Deputy Officer Zhang of the brigade at the hotel and asked him to lead the way. We went to Wang's residence together. Wang had already come out in front of the steps, looking very amiable. Wang was wearing a gray serge camel hair robe, his face was dark, and one could tell that he had experienced hardships. After meeting, we exchanged greetings and expressed our sympathy. Wang first said, "We soldiers don't know what hardship and danger are. We only know how to obey orders." Then he said that on the evening of the 18th, after attending the flood relief fundraising meeting hosted by the military at the Tongze Club, at about 10 o'clock, he received a report from his unit that the Japanese army had surrounded the barracks and the situation was extremely tense. He immediately telegraphed the various commanders and reported to Deputy Commander Zhang by telephone to ask for instructions. He received a reply instructing him not to resist and to let them do what they wanted. When the artillery fire became more and more intense, he had no choice but to telegraph the unit to make a general retreat without resistance, concentrate sixty miles east of the city, and wait for orders. He himself left the city through the Xiaodongmen at about 4 pm on the 19th, met up with his unit, and led them east. Along the way, they were sometimes tracked and pursued by Japanese planes. Because the mountain roads were winding, they were not detected. When they reached the Hada Fort area near Chaoyang Town, they had to cross the South Manchurian Railway before they could turn west. So they first sent a forward team to Chaoyang and telegraphed Jilin and Changchun (both places had been invaded by the Japanese army at that time, and the transportation facilities were also occupied by them) to report that the 7th Brigade would leave for Jilin that night. When the Japanese side heard the news, they suspected it was a counterattack and were panicked, and they transferred troops along the line to Jilin. The brigade took advantage of this opportunity to safely cross the river, cross the Liao River and reach Shanchengzi. After all the troops arrived in Jinzhou to assemble, they went west to defend the Ping-Sui Line. He himself came to Jinzhou first to report to Chief of Staff Rong (Zhen) and to prepare supplies. When the brigade withdrew from the Beida Camp, the soldiers all held their guns and cried bitterly, willing to fight to the death, but because of the orders from above, they did not dare to disobey, so they each carried their weapons and escaped from the rain of bullets. A total of more than 300 soldiers were killed or injured. Fortunately, the rest escaped danger. Along the way, they restrained their troops from eating rice and flour. Regardless of officers and soldiers, they all ate sorghum and millet to satisfy their hunger. Fortunately, everyone understood the overall situation and did not commit any crimes, which was comforting. On the way, they encountered student teams from the Jiangwutang and cavalry teams from the guards, all of whom were carrying weapons. Unfortunately, because there was no one to lead them, the teams were in disarray and looked very miserable. At this point in the conversation, because other guests came to visit, I said goodbye and left. On the way back, I met a soldier from the brigade, who said that in addition to the more than 300 brothers who were killed or injured that day, there were more than 800 civilians who were repairing the barracks at that time, and all of them were staying in the camp at night, so they also suffered the same fate. The most regrettable thing is that all the elite equipment of the brigade, such as armored vehicles, tanks, searchlights, and heavy cannons, were abandoned, and only light machine guns and mortars were taken out. According to reports, the 7th Brigade is known as a model brigade in the Northeast Army, and its equipment is the most sophisticated. This incident has caused a huge loss, which is a pity.

<h3>Jilin Under the Control of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army in Jilin and Changchun is Building Trenches and Actively Setting Up Military Facilities on the Jihui Road</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Yesterday, a gentleman from Jilin came to Jinan to seek refuge. The following is an account of the recent situation of the Japanese army in Jilin, which is recorded as follows: "Since Duomen used guns and cannons to force the change of the provincial government into the Chief Executive's Office, all political power has been completely in the hands of Tsuboi, the commander of the Japanese army. Everything is subject to people's instructions, and everything depends on people's whims. The so-called autonomy is purely fabricated by the Japanese side. Although Xi Qia is nominally the chief executive, he is actually a puppet. There are still more than a thousand Japanese troops stationed in Jilin (1) stationed in Jiangnan Lianhuapao and Beida Mountain in Jilin, (2) stationed in Longtanshan, Tuanshanzi, and Dongdatan, (3) stationed in the three major stations of Jilin, Changchun, Jihai, and Jitun, and Jiutai Station under the Jichang Line. The so-called withdrawal of troops is only one-tenth of the total. In fact, the Japanese side has decided to adopt the policy of secretly increasing troops while ostensibly withdrawing them in order to cover the eyes and ears of foreigners and avoid the intervention of the League of Nations. It can only be called troop transfer, not troop withdrawal. Just look at Duomen, who sent three or four hundred Japanese troops from Jilin to attack Dunhua County, the terminal of the Jitun Road. When the Japanese army occupied Dunhua, the county magistrate abandoned his post and fled, and the military police withdrew in advance. The Japanese army actually opened the prison and released six or seven hundred prisoners, most of whom were famous bandit leaders in our country and leaders of the Korean Communist Party. After their release, they were used to find out the location where our army had retreated. The prisoners escaped from prison like birds released from their cages, fled out of the city, and started looting and kidnapping, claiming that they were willing to help the Japanese army and repay the grace of their release. The Japanese army, seeing that the county seat was ownerless, forced Wang, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, to come forward to maintain the security of the county seat. The so-called withdrawal of troops was only a plan to attack Dunhua County. One part of them was transferred back to Changchun to attack the Northeast Army that had withdrawn from Kaiyuan and seize the weapons of our military and police. One part of the Japanese army that was transferred back to Jilin and Changchun was to launch a general attack on the troops of Wang Yizhe in Tieling, Kaiyuan, and Xinmin. Tieling and Kaiyuan were occupied on the 2nd and 3rd of this month, and all the police and militia were disarmed. The Japanese army stationed in Jilin and Changchun sends troops to the villages and towns under the county every day to search for and seize the guns of merchants and civilians. The rumors that the Japanese army has withdrawn to the attached areas are all fabricated by the Japanese side and are not true. Judging from the attack on Tieling and Kaiyuan and the bombing of Jinzhou, the military operations have not stopped. How can they talk about withdrawing troops? Moreover, a large number of Japanese troops have been transferred from Yanji to Jilin City recently. The political power of Jilin is now in the hands of the Japanese army. All new-minded people are replaced by Xi Qia under pressure from the Japanese side, and old-school bureaucrats are appointed. The appointment of officials must be approved by Tsuboi, the commander of the Japanese army garrison. Xi Qia has no power to make decisions. All people of integrity are unwilling to be traitors and dogs of the Japanese and resign. Zhang Qihuai, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, Ma Deen, the director of the Industry Department, Rong Hou, the director of the Finance Department, Wang Shixuan, the director of the Education Department, and Liu Shuchun, the mayor of Jilin, and fifty or sixty other people have all resigned. All the old and new official fans are running around the door of Tsuboi, begging for favors day and night, in order to seek promotion. These people are divided into three factions: (1) old bureaucrats from the feudal era, (2) local bullies who are social moths, and (3) frustrated politicians and local hooligans. Demons and monsters all appear, and ghosts and goblins come out to govern, using the pretext of maintaining local security and calling for Sino-Japanese friendship. The Japanese use their ignorance and give them the power of traitorous officials. The most shameful thing is that Jiang Dafeng, the former president of the Xinhebao newspaper, who used to call himself a revolutionary, is now the director of the tax bureau under the command of the Japanese. There are many people like this. The rumors that the reorganization of the provincial government was the result of the demands of local legal organizations in Jilin and that Xi Qia was elected as the chief executive by local gentry are purely fabricated by the Japanese. In fact, the reorganization of the provincial government was not approved by the local people, and Xi's appointment as chief executive was not recommended by the gentry. On September 25, when Japanese Army Colonel Tsuboi and Lieutenant General Duomen convened a meeting of local gentry in the provincial government, the Japanese side proposed: (1) dissolve the provincial government and reorganize the Chief Executive's Office, (2) appoint Xi Qia as the chief executive and Tsuboi as the commander of the garrison, (3) the office will have two departments, civil affairs and military affairs, and the original departments will remain, (4) the provincial government's border defense documents will be destroyed and a wooden official seal will be issued by Japan, (5) the regulations of the Chief Executive's Office will be formulated by the Japanese side, (6) the security of Jilin Province and the city will be jointly maintained by the Chinese and Japanese military police, (7) the Chief Executive's Office will be jointly organized by local officials and gentry to elect members, (8) the heads of military and political organs must be supervised and directed by personnel dispatched by the Japanese army, (9) the appointment and removal of officials must be approved by the Japanese side and selected from the current retired new and old factions, (10) the provincial government's guard battalion will be reorganized by the chief executive and the commander of the garrison, and the defense of the province will be undertaken by the Japanese troops stationed there. The above ten items are only a summary record. During the meeting, the provincial government was surrounded by soldiers, cannons were hung on the gates, guns were erected in front of the government, and heavy troops surrounded the place, trying to force and threaten as much as possible. Some leaders of local legal organizations spoke during the meeting, but they did not approve or dare to oppose, and dispersed according to Duomen's proposal. At this time, the Japanese army prepared to reorganize the provincial government and issued an announcement to appease the people on behalf of Xi Qia, which was posted all over Jilin and Changchun. As for the statement spread by the Japanese side that the Jilin gentry telegraphed to declare their secession from the central government, it is even more untrue. The people of Jilin did not make a single declaration, and the telegraphic organs in Jilin and Changchun are still in the hands of the Japanese. The newspapers are being monitored. Even if the gentry of Jilin are foolish, they will never do such a heartless and insane thing to be slaves of a subjugated country. Under the iron heel and guns, they can only endure the pain and submit. Xi Qia's appointment as the chief executive and the dissolution of the provincial committee were indeed caused by the coercion of the Japanese army Duomen, not by the demands of the Jilin gentry. This must be clarified."</p>
<p>"Since the first of this month, the Japanese army has dispatched more than 1,500 marines from Yanji and Dunhua, stationed in Longtanshan, Beida Mountain, Tuanshanzi, Jiangwanzi, and other places. Together with those stationed in Jilin, there are about 2,000 or more. In addition to actively preparing to strengthen their military force,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>they have recently hired five or six hundred Chinese to dig trenches in Beida Mountain... and other places... The already dug trenches, it is heard that there are already more than twenty... are being supervised and dug, and the daily wage is 50 cents in gold... Beida, Jiangwan, Lianhua, and other important matters are all important strongholds, machine guns and cannons are still being set up... As for the Jihui Road, construction has now started, and armed Japanese soldiers are... materials were stored two months ago, about three or four thousand workers, half of whom are Chinese and half are Koreans, starting construction from both ends of Dunhua County to Huining Mansion, working on both sides to achieve rapid connection, so that it can be opened to traffic as soon as possible. The plan is to complete it in the shortest period of time, exclusively as a military railway, with a deadline of two months for completion, and at the latest by the end of the year. The Japanese army is now digging trenches in Jilin and Changchun and building military railways, and their war preparations can be imagined. Facts are the most eloquent. The League of Nations can send personnel to investigate in detail to find out the truth."</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Speech at the National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Upholding Justice and Resisting Might</p>
<p>The National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week yesterday morning (the 12th). Chairman Chiang Kai-shek first listened to Kong Xiangxi's report on the Sino-Japanese issue. Then, Chiang delivered a speech on upholding justice and resisting might. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Japanese troops have occupied our northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang for over three weeks. On the 30th of last month, the League of Nations resolved to notify Japan to withdraw its troops, hoping they would do so within two weeks. That deadline is also approaching. The League of Nations wanted Japan to withdraw its troops, hoping that this military conflict would not escalate further and that the case could be resolved peacefully. However, Japan not only shows no sign of withdrawing its troops, but its military actions have become even more aggressive. In particular, on the 8th of this month, Japanese troops used many aircraft to drop numerous bombs on Jinzhou, where our temporary Liaoning Provincial Government is located, causing heavy losses to our people's lives and property. These actions by the Japanese military are entirely intended to achieve their aggressive goals by relying on their powerful military force. This is not only a great shame and unbearable for our country but will also be regarded by all countries in the world as an enemy of justice and humanity, and cannot be tolerated for long. When the Council of the League of Nations adjourned last month, it had originally scheduled to reconvene on the 14th of this month. If Japanese troops had completely withdrawn before the 14th, the meeting would not be held. However, in light of recent Japanese troop actions, especially the bombing of Jinzhou, the League of Nations considers the situation very serious and has decided to advance the meeting to the 13th. We believe that this meeting will surely find a path to peace in accordance with the principles of justice, so that peace in East Asia and even the world will not be disrupted by Japan alone.</p>
<p>According to the situation in recent days, the Japanese troops invading the Northeast have not only failed to comply with the League of Nations' notification to avoid escalating the situation but have also been harassing everywhere, expanding their military actions daily. Moreover, they have also dispatched warships to the coastal ports and the Yangtze River area of southern China, carrying marines to demonstrate force everywhere. Furthermore, the Japanese residents in Shanghai held a residents' meeting yesterday, and after the meeting, several thousand people gathered in formation and marched, barging into Chinese shops, injuring Chinese children, tearing down slogans, and wantonly insulting and scolding. Their intention to provoke is even more obvious. Fortunately, our police were strictly vigilant, and the public maintained a calm and composed attitude, so although they were determined to provoke, they still had no opportunity to do so. This manifestation of our perseverance and composure is not a sign of submission but a manifestation of the progress of our people’s knowledge. The level of knowledge of our people now is no longer comparable to what it was thirty or forty years ago. Foreign military force cannot easily threaten us. This time, Japan has occupied our land for no reason, relying on its powerful army, navy, and air force, believing that China is no match for them. If we resist even slightly, they can use it as an excuse to start a war and force us to cede territory and pay reparations before they are willing to stop. There is also a part of our people who have this mentality, deeply fearing this result, and thinking that it will take decades or even a century to recover. They do not know that this mentality was applicable in China thirty or forty years ago, but it is completely different now. I believe that with the progress of the knowledge of our people, if we reach a point of no return and peace is broken, we will definitely not fail. We must now do our best to avoid war, and even before war comes, we must remain calm and composed, without losing our temper. But the progress of the level of knowledge of our people is indeed enough to fight a strong enemy to the death. This is not only something we ourselves must recognize, but all countries in the world can also recognize it in this matter.</p>
<p>In the two wars of Jiawu and Gengzi during the late Qing Dynasty, China had two most shameful things. First, when the Jiawu War broke out with Japan, the Beiyang Fleet had been defeated by the Japanese army, but the Nanyang Fleet remained indifferent and even declared neutrality. This clearly showed that the Chinese people had no national consciousness or concept of the country, which made foreigners see that the Chinese people had no spirit of unity. Under such circumstances, how could we not be bullied, how could we avoid failure? Second, the Boxers in the Gengzi year did not distinguish between nationalities, did not distinguish between gratitude and grudges, and blindly hated everything foreign, fully demonstrating that the Chinese people had no knowledge and naturally had to be despised and bullied by foreigners. However, this was a symbol of the level of national knowledge thirty or forty years ago, and it is by no means a manifestation of the current national psychology. The Japanese military does not understand this and still holds the vision of thirty or forty years ago to look at the Chinese people of the Republic of China. This mistake of theirs can be determined to be the precursor to their failure. Now our people already know that the country is jointly owned by the people, unlike in the past when it was regarded as the property of the emperor alone. Because in the past, the country was regarded as the property of the emperor, so when war broke out with Japan, it was also regarded as the emperor's business, and the people did not have to care. Today, our people have completely changed this mentality, knowing that the country is the people's country. No matter which part of our people is bullied by Japan or which part of our territory is occupied, the people immediately feel that this is bullying all of our people and invading our entire country. The people's concept of the country is not only very enthusiastic, but also able to maintain very clear rationality in extreme enthusiasm, not acting unconsciously, not falling into the enemy's tricks. This is the basis of our nation, and it is also the basis of resisting aggression.</p>
<p>This time, Japan sent troops to occupy our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, and the compatriots across the country immediately united to resist. Not only is this the case in the Yangtze River area, but the expression of the people in Guangdong in the southernmost part is also very激昂 (agitated). This spirit of national unity is truly a national treasure, greater than any force. Judging from the above theory, although our military equipment and force are not as good as Japan's now, because the level of knowledge of our people has improved, the increased power to defend the country is indeed enough to protect the existence of our country. The manifestation of this spirit can never be overwhelmed by a militaristic country. Therefore, while we hope that this incident can be resolved peacefully, if it is absolutely necessary to defend ourselves with force, we will definitely be able to achieve final victory. We must defend the life of the country and the nation, defend the cause of justice and humanity, adhere to the bottom line, and never give in. It is a manifestation of the power of the whole nation. It will not only not be frightened by the enemy, but also fulfill its due responsibilities for the sake of international justice and international law. We have the power to resist any violence from foreign races, no matter what kind of army, navy, or air force is used to oppress us. Our country can still resist this great insult with an extremely painful and calm spirit. The current people are very different from the people of thirty or forty years ago. The Japanese should change their vision. We ourselves must be clear about this point. We must also know that no country or individual in the world can stand apart from the world. In terms of the country, a country established in the world must have allies, and there must be a way for countries to coexist and help each other. We must never only care about our own rights and interests and harm or even infringe on the rights and interests of other countries. If this is the case, then this country that only knows how to be for itself will not be able to gain the sympathy of its allies and coexist peacefully. Our country is one of the countries in the world, so it cannot be separated from the world. Similarly, since it is a member of the League of Nations, it cannot be separated from the international community. Any country that leaves the international community will inevitably fail and bring destruction upon itself. Japan is now trapped in this situation. The military only knows that its army is strong and only wants to kick into the hinterland of our three northeastern provinces and occupy it as its own. However, they do not know that there is still justice in the world, and it will never allow them to be so arrogant and destroy world peace. The world is not only Japan, and the international community does not only rely on power. Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces is to destroy peace in East Asia and destroy world peace. The Japanese warlords do not understand this principle, which is tantamount to isolating themselves from the world. The League of Nations originally hoped that the incident of Japan's invasion of the eastern provinces would not expand further, but the Japanese military was afraid that it would not expand. The incident of the Japanese aircraft bombing Jinzhou occurred long after the League of Nations ordered the Japanese troops to withdraw, so its atrocities cannot be recognized by all countries in the world. At this time of great disaster, in view of the improvement of the national knowledge level and the existence of international justice, we will never have any fear. No matter how strong Japan's military force is, we do not care. We only need to ask ourselves whether we have the will to unite as one, whether we have the spirit of revolutionary sacrifice, whether we abide by the justice of the world, whether we uphold the dignity of international law, and whether we maintain the existence of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. I think we are a country in the world and a member of the League of Nations. In any case, we have the responsibility to uphold public law and maintain the treaty. Not only does our country have this responsibility, but all countries in the world also have this responsibility. Today, we are very willing to preserve the dignity of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and international conventions in a peaceful manner. Even though Japan has occupied our territory, we still do not declare war on them. This is to maintain justice and to do our best to endure for the sake of public law and conventions. But when it is absolutely necessary, when public law and conventions cannot be maintained, we will never hesitate to make any sacrifices to fulfill our responsibility to uphold international law and maintain the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Non-war is sacred, but it is valuable to fight to maintain public law and conventions, no matter how great the sacrifice. Comrades and compatriots across the country, we know that we are now in a world of advancing culture, and it is by no means that barbarous force can conquer everything. The Chinese nation is no longer the same as it was thirty or forty years ago. Patience and struggle can both express our personality and determination according to the needs of the times. We already have the greatest chance of winning in spirit. No matter how strong the enemy is or how they threaten us, we will always treat them calmly and will not give in. We should also believe that there are conventions in the international community and justice in humanity. We must abide by them with a peaceful mind and uphold them with a spirit of sacrifice. Tyranny is not to be feared, and coercion is not to be surrendered to. We must strive for peace and struggle to defend this national crisis and to uphold international law.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul in Hankou Attempts to Curb Our National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents from Sichuan and Hunan Provoke Us When Concentrated in Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since the Shenyang Incident occurred, the eyes of the Japanese have shifted from the borderlands of the three northeastern provinces to the heartland of the Yangtze River. The corner of Hankou is particularly valued. Therefore, warships are moored in the river, and electric nets are laid out at the border. Tensions are high, and a touch-and-go situation exists. In recent days, Japanese residents from Sichuan, Hunan, Yichang, and Shashi have concentrated in Hankou, and provocations have been heard daily. They have also manufactured green uniforms similar to those worn by students of our country's Central Military Academy and purchased a large number of gray military uniforms. Every day, they divide the residents into two teams and practice the formation of attacking and defending the Japanese consulate late into the night. Their intentions are particularly obvious. However, the people of Wuhan have long known of the Japanese conspiracy. In addition to working on an orderly boycott movement, they are also trying to avoid unnecessary conflicts. The Japanese, unable to provoke a conflict, had the Japanese consul send a letter to the Hubei Provincial Government, requesting that it severely crack down on the anti-Japanese propaganda and economic severance by the Chinese people, fearing that it would endanger the lives and properties of the Japanese. After receiving the letter, the provincial government specifically replied to the Japanese consul on the 12th, stating that merchants and civilians do not purchase Japanese goods based on patriotic enthusiasm, which is inconvenient to force. The letter is as follows: "I have just received your consul general's letter, which briefly states that the anti-Japanese propaganda and economic severance by the Chinese people may endanger the lives and properties of the Japanese, and requests that we severely crack down on them. After examination, the provincial government is of course responsible for protecting the lives and properties of foreigners, and the Chinese people have not committed any acts that endanger the safety of the Japanese, which has been acknowledged by your consul general, so there is no need to worry about it. As for the merchants and civilians, who are inspired by the recent events in the three northeastern provinces with patriotic enthusiasm, are unwilling to purchase Japanese goods, which is personal freedom, and the government should not force them to do so. However, I hope that your government will quickly uphold justice and completely resolve the incident in the three northeastern provinces, so that the Chinese people will return to their usual friendly state of mind, and then the trade between the two sides will naturally become increasingly developed, so as to satisfy your consul general's hope. The provincial government is also pleased to announce the reiteration of instructions to military and police agencies to make every effort to protect foreigners and to strictly prevent illegal acts by bandits. The above letter is hereby replied to for your reference. (October 12)"</p>
<h3>New German Envoy Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>The newly appointed German envoy to China, Dr. Oskar Trautmann, went to the National Government at 10 a.m. on the 13th to meet with Chairman Chiang and present his credentials. The National Government first prepared a large automobile and dispatched Liu Naifan, Section Chief of the Bureau of Ceremonies, to the German envoy's residence in Shenjuren Lane at 9 a.m. to welcome him. Infantrymen were stationed on both sides of the driveway inside the gate of the National Government. At 9:55 a.m., the German envoy and others arrived at the National Government by car. The infantrymen on the driveway presented arms to salute, and the band played music to welcome them. The National Government dispatched Tang Sanjun, Section Chief Liu, as the reception officer, and Jin Zhixia and Sun Yue, secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as translators. After the German envoy got out of the car, he entered the reception room to rest. The Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies then invited the German envoy to enter for the audience and performed the ritual. Li Jinlun, the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, recited the name of the German envoy. After the recitation, the German envoy delivered a congratulatory speech, followed by the presentation of the credentials. Chairman Chiang delivered a reply and shook hands with the German envoy and inquired about the health of the German President. The German envoy then bid farewell and entered the reception room. At 10:30 a.m., he was escorted back to his residence by the welcoming staff. The congratulatory speech and reply are appended below:</p>
<p>German Envoy's Congratulatory Speech: "Your Excellency, Chairman of the National Government, I, the envoy, am deeply honored to present to Your Excellency the credentials of the President of my country as the Plenipotentiary Envoy Extraordinary to China, along with the letter of recall of the former Envoy Dr. Herbert von Borch. I am commencing my tenure at a difficult time, due to the enormous impact of the shock caused by the European War. Most notably in recent years, the global economy has entered a very dangerous state, causing all countries to hold pessimistic views about the future, and international commerce has also been hit. All countries should have the perseverance to turn the tide. Under these circumstances, only with all countries working together with one heart, trusting each other, and helping each other can we restore the original state. The construction problems of China and Germany are roughly the same. In recent years, international trust between the two countries has become increasingly deep, and the peoples of the two countries have also expressed deep sympathy for each other. I, the envoy, am ordered by the government of my country to devote myself to maintaining and consolidating the friendly relations between our two countries and to make them even closer. I deeply hope that Your Excellency, the Chairman, and the National Government of the Republic of China will provide the same assistance to my work as was given to the former Envoy Dr. Herbert von Borch. I also sincerely wish Your Excellency good health and wish your country prosperity and glory."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Reply: "Your Excellency, Envoy, today you have come in person with the credentials from the President of your country and the letter of recall from the former Envoy, Dr. Herbert von Borch, and I am greatly pleased to accept them. Our two countries recognize that the world economy and commerce have been approaching a very dangerous state. Unless all countries sincerely help each other, there is no way to reverse this crisis. Therefore, in recent years, our two countries have had trusting and close cooperation in the hope of restoring the world to its original state as soon as possible and sharing the happiness of peace. This is not only a wish of myself and Your Excellency, but also the deep sympathy between the peoples of the two countries. I firmly believe that Your Excellency's arrival in this country will certainly enable the existing friendship between the two countries to become even more intimate, and I will provide all the convenience necessary for Your Excellency during your term of office in order to fulfill your wishes. I hereby wish His Excellency the President good health and the prosperity of your country in the name of the National Government and the people."</p>

<p>Bandit Alert in Xishan, Silicun. On the night of the 12th, twenty to thirty bandits carrying guns and weapons arrived in Xishan's Xiaohuawan, Silicun. The villagers were frightened and fled in all directions. The brave ones sounded gongs to warn others. Fortunately, the 3rd Squad of the County Police Team received the news early and rushed to the destination to surround and suppress the bandits. Seeing the police arrive, the bandits opened fire to resist the enemy. The police team also returned fire. After an hour of mutual shooting, the bandits were overwhelmed and went to the boat to escape towards Taihu Lake.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Liyang's Forced Donations Stopped by Provincial Order. Rice merchants from Wuxi residing in Liyang, such as Yuan Xihe and Zhu Yongnian, reported that Zhou Qingsheng and others, under the guise of a disaster relief association, had privately set up disguised likin posts at locations such as Duji Bridge and Kunlun Bridge to forcibly collect donations and even detain rice. The rice merchants, unable to bear the harassment, reported to the Wuxi Rice Grain Shipping Association, which telegraphed the province for assistance and reported to the County Chamber of Commerce. The Shanghai Jiangsu-Zhejiang Rice Grain United Association submitted a report to the province, ordering that the forced collection be stopped. After receiving the report, the province strictly ordered Liyang County to stop the collection and threatened to dismiss and investigate any violators. The order was then relayed to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen of Liyang immediately forwarded a letter to the Disaster Relief Association for compliance. After receiving the letter, the association held a meeting and decided to send Pan Xisheng, the chairman of the Disaster Relief Branch, Di Dianchen, the chairman of the Grain Guild, and representatives from five groups, including the Education and Agricultural Association, to the province to appeal and continue the collection. Pan and others came to Wuxi yesterday and took a train to the province to petition, but it is feared that they will not be approved.</p>

Yesterday, the "Hotsuma" was ordered to leave Zhenjiang and head to Nanjing. When it set sail, it circled the area from Xiangshan to the riverbank for a while before leaving. Three or four sailors from the "Momo" also went ashore occasionally, but their attitude was relatively peaceful. The director of the 4th Public Security Bureau has received instructions that whenever sailors from the ship go ashore, they must be carefully protected and should not be allowed to provoke trouble. Therefore, although the ship is anchored on the riverbank, the current situation is still relatively peaceful.</p>

<p>Pirate Harassment in Juegang. On the 11th, more than three hundred pirates continued to arrive in the Juegang Donglin Port area. They robbed and kidnapped people near Dayu Town, causing severe disturbance. The County Government telegraphed the province to send warships to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Student Union's Strict Inspection of Japanese Goods. Since the outbreak of Japan's invasion of the Northeast, the whole country has risen up to implement an economic boycott. The student unions of various schools in the county have organized a joint association to inspect enemy goods quite strictly. However, various cloth factories and yarn shops are still importing Japanese products on a large scale, taking the opportunity to profit. On the 11th, the student union found more than ten porters at Zhongshan Gate carrying goods from the Huacheng Cloth Factory. At that time, twenty packages were intercepted. The Huacheng brand name was on the carrying poles. The factory was notified, and the factory denied importing Japanese yarn. In the evening, the student union and the anti-Japanese association went to Huacheng to search the yarn room and found 1,369 packages of Japanese yarn, for which the factory issued a receipt, awaiting resolution by the anti-Japanese association.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Meat Tickets from Dongdun Township Escape and Return. Jiang Zhaogao, an accountant at the Hengxingchang Timber Firm in Dongdun Township in the 3rd District of the county, and a villager surnamed Ju, totaling four people, were kidnapped by bandits a few days ago. Now, Jiang and the other four have all escaped and returned. It is said that there were not many bandits. Later, because they retreated to the border of Baoying, the defense was slightly lax, so they were able to escape at night. It is said that they were lucky.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Unrest from Bandits in Xiaoqiao. Bandits were discovered in the Touer, Sanzhuang area of the 2nd district of Huaiyin a few days ago. The county police team went to suppress them, but due to the bandits' superior numbers and the police's inferior forces, five policemen were killed and four or six horses were injured. In addition, the daughter of Wang Laopi, a resident, was cut into several pieces by the bandits. Later, a large team was mobilized to suppress them, and the bandits began to retreat. Xiaoqiao is a few miles away from Matou Town. On the night of the 9th, the bandits invaded again. In addition to killing four members of the family of Wen Liben, the head of the gathering, four more policemen were killed. On the evening of the 10th, the families of the deceased policemen had carried the bodies back to the city, and two bodies were carried to the county government to request compensation. The prevalence of banditry is evident.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>New Development of the Electricity Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since the promulgation of the Supervisory Regulations and the extension of the operating period for private electric power companies, the private electric power industry in our country has gradually shown signs of recovery. In the past two years, the electrical companies in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already increased and planned to increase a total of about 45,000 to 50,000 horsepower. There are more than 200 electric companies in the two provinces, accounting for half of the total number in the country.</p>
<h3>&lt;丨The Three Musketeers丨P]</h3>
<p>Lin Wangsu, Qiu Feihai, and Lin Baohua, the three musketeers of China. This competition seems like a Peach Garden Oath, dividing into a front and back with Wangsu as the elder brother, Feihai second, and Baohua the younger brother. In terms of art, the younger brother Baohua can be called versatile, Feihai is of the mature and steady school, and Wangsu is tough and steady. Although the rankings are temporarily separate, their skills are actually comparable, like three legs of a tripod. Work hard, work hard, and when we meet again at the National Games next year, how about dividing the strong and weak?</p>
<p>丨Five Sets of Momentum丨</p>
<p>Qiu and Lin fought a total of five sets. In the first set, Qiu was completely controlled by Lin's net play, perhaps Qiu was inferior to Lin and would fall into a slump. Little did they know that Qiu's first set loss was almost a routine. In the second set, Qiu performed better, with several drop shots and several interceptions, Lin was at a loss and unable to save the situation. In the third set, Qiu was running out of energy, but survived through desperate fighting, while Lin was negligent and suffered a blow. In the fourth set, Qiu struggled hard at the beginning, but Lin stepped up his work, with rapid shots to the left and right, and Qiu was unable to support himself and lost. The fifth set was similar to the previous set. In the last game, Qiu showed signs of resurgence, but fortunately God took care of the distant guest, and preserved Lin's victory.</p>
<p>丨Qiu Lin Tactics丨</p>
<p>Qiu and Lin were originally from the same family, both from Malaya. At that time, Qiu was at the peak of his dominance, while Lin was just beginning to show his talent. Today, Qiu's skills are still good, but his age is gradually increasing, not as good as Lin's rising sun. The two have the same hitting method, specializing in corner and baseline shots, but their grip is different, one left and one right. In comparison, Qiu is more steady, but lacks physical strength, and his several drop shots and interceptions are amazing. Lin's victory relies on his tough shots and steady returns.</p>
<p>丨Unstoppable丨</p>
<p>Qiu's serve is not as smooth as Lin's under the same hitting method, and he lost two games in a row. In the third game, Qiu had more bad balls and was hit hard again. Lin used a lightning-fast shot to win the fourth game again. In the fifth game, Qiu began to improve, and in one breath, he won three games in a row, making it three to four. When it was Lin's turn to serve, he won four consecutive games. In the eighth and ninth games, Qiu's shots were chaotic and he was hit again. Lin then won the first set with six to three.</p>

<p>丨Show My True Colors丨</p>
<p>Qiu's loss in the first set is already commonplace, it happens every time. In the second set, he showed his true colors and confronted his opponent. However, he lost three times in a row at the beginning, which was discouraging. But in a short time, he won five times and won. The taste was good and his spirit was doubled. He also won the second game with a clean four. In the third game, Qiu changed his strategy and lured Lin to the net, but failed. Qiu's victory in the fourth game was based on skill. The score became three to one. In the fifth and sixth games, Lin won with a clean four, and then won the seventh game. He took the lead with four to three. In the eighth and ninth games, Qiu won again. The situation was tight and the form was serious. The two sides continued to exchange shots. Once, it took thirty-four shots to determine a winner. Soon, there was a tie of five to five. Qiu did not slacken and continued to advance, winning the second set with seven to five.</p>

<p>丨Keep Up The Efforts丨</p>
<p>Qiu's strength is gradually diminishing, but his tactics are excellent, specializing in using skill to gain the advantage. The victory in the first game of the third set was due to this. Lin led the ball and shot it, accurately and powerfully, and won the second and third games. Unexpectedly, he miscalculated his serve, plus two self-kills, and a clean four failure, resulting in a two-two tie. After that, Lin won two more games and took the lead with four to two. In the seventh game, Qiu worked hard to win it back. In the eighth game, he failed to fight back. At that time, Lin was leading with five to three. Starting from the ninth game, Qiu showed his skills, sometimes intercepting the net, sometimes using a drop shot. Lin struggled to cope and lost four games in a row. Qiu won the third set with seven to five with the spirit of continuous efforts.</p>

<p>丨Good Opportunity Lost丨</p>
<p>Qiu had a better chance after winning two sets. He started smoothly and won three times. Lin tried hard and tied the score four times. Qiu won the first game of the fourth set. In the second game, he suffered a setback, losing four times in a row. After one to one, there were consecutive ties of two to two and three to three. Qiu's leg injury broke out and he was walking slowly. Lin took advantage of this and attacked from left and right, gaining a great advantage. He turned around and took a high advantage with five to three. If Qiu won this set, he would definitely win the championship. How could he sit back and lose the opportunity without fighting hard? After six ties, he unexpectedly survived and created a four to five situation, and his vitality returned. However, Lin finally occupied the dominant position and won again. Lin then won the fourth set with six to four.</p>

<p>丨Destiny丨</p>
<p>The two rested for a while and their spirits were revived. This set was a matter of life and death, and they struggled hard. In the last tenth game, if Qiu could turn defeat into victory and make it five to five, Qiu could have won the world and occupied the top spot. The God of Fortune did not want the distant guest to be disappointed, so Qiu had no choice but to bow down to Lin's net play and offer his congratulations. At the beginning of the battle, Qiu won the first game, and Lin won two games in a row. The third game belonged to Qiu, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth games belonged to Lin in a row, which was a fatal injury to Qiu. Qiu used all his energy to save the seventh game, making it three to four. Lin's long strength was superior, and in a blink of an eye, he won the eighth game, taking the lead with five to three. Qiu won the ninth game again, and hope was born again. In the tenth game, the two chased each other for a long time, and were finally taken away by Lin. Lin won the fifth set with six to four, and won with a score of three to two, which can be said to have taken a lot of effort.</p>

<p>丨Doubles Cancelled丨</p>
<p>The triangular port-to-port double performance between Malaya, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Malaya has already won Tianjin, and Tianjin has won Shanghai. The last battle between Malaya and Shanghai was originally scheduled to be held yesterday after the singles were completed. However, yesterday's match ended late, and Lin Wangsu and Qiu Feihai were exhausted and could not fight anymore. It is said that this game has been cancelled in disguise, and if there is a chance, it will be rescheduled, otherwise it will be abandoned. It is said that this doubles match is for performance purposes and does not emphasize winning or losing.</p>
<p>Are the two Lins going to fight?</p>
<p>Lin Wangsu, Qiu Feihai, and Lin Baohua, the three national players, stand like three legs of a tripod. In this competition, Qiu won Lin Baohua, and Lin Wangsu won Qiu Feihai. Although the rankings are divided into high and low, superior and inferior, it is certainly not possible to determine this with this one battle. However, the two Lins have not met in a battle, which is a pity. Shen Siliang, the main leader of the association, once asked Lin Baohua for his opinion. Lin said that this Saturday, there may be a senior singles rematch with Defu, and the battle will be fierce. In order to maintain his strength, he has not fully agreed. If so, the game may be next week.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Heartfelt Words</p>
<p>Cuckoo</p>
<p>Dear compatriots. We no longer need to hate violent Japan. This time, the Japanese army drove straight in and occupied the eastern provinces. It was like a great hammering of the morning drum and evening bell, awakening the daydreams of the 400 million Chinese people. Thus, those who were divided in the past are seeking unity. Those who were disruptive in the past are willing to compromise. Those who did not know that domestic products should be promoted and only profited from Japanese goods in the past are now unanimously boycotting Japanese goods. Violent Japan is also afraid that we will lose our temper and only have five minutes of enthusiasm. Therefore, they occupied Yingkou, entered Niuzhuang, and bombed Jinzhou. Warships kept sailing into the Yangtze River. This is like adding more fuel to the stove in our hearts, so that the heat of our blood does not drop. Compatriots, we should be grateful to violent Japan. Do not fail their good intentions.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes on the Righteous Volunteer Army of Zhongda</p>
<p>Jie Fei</p>
<p>In recent days, the people of the country have been indignant at the brutality of violent Japan and the weakness of the motherland. They have organized righteous volunteer armies and rescue teams as a backup for the government. Zhongda has completed this kind of organization the day before yesterday. The whole school has enlisted in the army. They have compiled regular numbers and have formed righteous volunteer army platoons into regiments, with four battalions and two independent companies. The rescue team is a ten-person team formed by female students, with sixteen teams in total. The basic organization is a ten-person team. Anyone who volunteers to join the righteous volunteer army must first organize a ten-person team to resist Japan and save the country. In the name of ten people, they join together. After joining, the ten people are organized into a class, sharing weal and woe, and sharing honor and disgrace. These ten people are jointly responsible for the management and training of the righteous volunteer army. Therefore, the ten-person teams are mostly from the same hometown or department, and have known each other for many years. Afterwards, they will each prepare a very detailed record of their background in order to form a lifelong friendship through thick and thin. When the ten-person team is established, they must gather at midnight, take an oath at dawn, and swear an oath at sunrise. When swearing, they must stand facing east and point to the sky and swear to the sun. The words are generous and tragic. The record is as follows: "I, ○○○, swear to my blue sky, to my white sun, to the mountains and rivers of my motherland, and to the graves of my ancestors. I swear with hot blood, with a sincere heart, and with utmost sincerity, to sacrifice my family, my life, and everything to eliminate the enemies who invade my motherland and to revive my glorious motherland. I swear to live and die with my compatriots and share weal and woe in the spirit of love and sincerity. If I have regrets or develop ulterior motives, may heaven and earth punish me. This is my oath." Although autumn has passed and the grass has withered, the dew is cold and the wind is cold, the reports and oaths of the ten-person teams are still held several times a day. The places where the oaths are taken are mostly in places with heroic and majestic scenery such as Qixia Mountain, Zijin Mountain, Qingliang Mountain, Taicheng, and Houhu. Those who go to Qixia and Zijin must prepare military tents and carry food the night before, and camp on the barren mountains and wild fields. Those who go to Qingliang and Taicheng and other nearby places mostly set off in formation at midnight. The orders are strict and the night is quiet. The brave men are not proud of their misery. They rise up and look out. The mountains and rivers of the motherland are faintly visible in the vast moonlight. They cannot help but feel excited and their voices are urgent.

The professor is a graduate of the Army University in the United States and has held important positions in the military for many years. Recently, he resigned from the army and lectured at the Zhongda Law School. He is a tragic hero of Yan and Zhao. (Relief for Disaster Relief)</p>
<p>The Origin and Elimination Methods of Rumors</p>
<p>Wu Yubo</p>
<p>Since Japan sent warships to China, various rumors have arisen in the Beijing and Shanghai areas. In particular, the unfounded rumors that spread throughout the capital on October 7th are truly indescribable. The inferior nature of the Chinese people is fully revealed here. The occurrence of rumors can be attributed to the following three causes. 1. Excessive selfishness. Once our conscience is blinded by selfishness, it loses its control. We lightly believe and lightly doubt, and only have a fear of disaster and no power of judgment. We think of everything from the perspective of selfishness and base our actions on personal gain or loss. Small disturbances are幻化into great crises in our minds. The saying "the wind sounds like the crane's cry and the grass looks like soldiers" all comes from this kind of psychological delusion. 2. Short-sightedness. Not only can we not observe the essence of events, but we also make various erroneous judgments. We are shortsighted and muddleheaded. We have neither good long-term strategies nor current thinking. The city tiger and the cup bow are all caused by neurasthenia. 3. Lack of perseverance, that is, weakness of will. We are both foolish and cowardly, and we easily believe and doubt. People with poor development and inferior races all have the above symptoms. With no knowledge, no passionate emotions, and no strong will, various rumors arise during slight changes. Those who create rumors are the same as those who believe in rumors. The capital police department issued notices yesterday and today to capture those who create rumors, which is like trying to find the moon in the sea. Those who create rumors are not other people, but the illusions created in the minds of those who believe in rumors. To curb the occurrence of rumors, there are two most important urgent tasks. 1. Restrict the reckless actions of civil servants and the intellectual class. Just look at the panic and haste at the Shimonoseki train station yesterday. Prohibiting the migration of their families can reduce rumors by sixty or seventy percent. 2. Publicize major and minor political affairs, and take an open attitude in everything. Major foreign and domestic affairs should not be kept secret. As long as it does not affect the scope of public security, it is okay for the public to see and hear. As for the fundamental solution, it must be addressed through education. Cultivate people's intelligence, foster a strong national character, cultivate knowledge, and cultivate morality. Then, even if there are people who create rumors, people will scoff at them or punch them. Why should there be such panic and haste as yesterday and today, causing strong neighbors to sneer?</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Slogan Craze</p>
<p>Lan Xi</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM on October 11th, I took the No. 1 tram to Dixiwei Road. Passing by a Japanese elementary school, I saw a white cloth hanging high in front of the gate, with the words "Shanghai Japanese Residents' General Meeting" written on it. I saw Japanese people filing in and gathering in the field. I expected that the result of their meeting would be some kind of expression. I would wait and see. Who knew that at around 3:00 PM on the same day, Japanese people in groups tore down slogans along North Sichuan Road. They clapped like thunder every time they tore one down. If there were slogans posted in front of stores, they would order the merchants to tear them down. If not, they would do it themselves, climbing windows and grabbing walls, regardless of the consequences. Behind each group, Japanese soldiers drove cars to protect them. Observing their actions, they implicitly contained provocative intentions. Fortunately, our country is united and maintains composure, adhering to the principle of non-resistance, and allowing them to act recklessly. Later, when the authorities of the concession learned about it, they sent ten military vehicles to follow the Japanese vehicles one after another to suppress their momentum. At 7:30 PM that evening, I went out with Mr. He from Dixiwei Road to observe the slogans along the way. I saw that those that had been torn down earlier were still posted high as before, and even more had been added. When we arrived at Linanju and Yuantai Cloth Store, we heard someone in the store say, "The dwarfs tear them down as much as they want. We can post them again." As we went further, near the Moonlight Ballroom, we saw a Japanese military officer walking with three Japanese soldiers. They were looking around and talking softly when they saw the slogans. At the same time, a young man at Tongfuchang Cloth Store was climbing a ladder to post a slogan "Japanese People's Beastly Behavior...Slogans Can Be Torn Down, but Chinese People's Hearts Cannot Be Torn Down." They dared not approach. In the old capital, I heard about a soldier. (I'm not sure what the meaning is.)</p>
<p>The dung valve</p>
<p>Northerners, both men and women, do not use chamber pots. Even in humble homes, the places for excretion are clearly divided inside and outside. Therefore, there is no need to worry about confusion. Northerners are simple and still follow the ancient system. The latrine is commonly called "maofang" or "dongce". If it is in a public place, it is written separately as "tangke" for women and "guanke" for men. In people's homes, it is divided into "neice" inside the screen and "waice" outside the screen. The task of cleaning is done by dung collectors. They are paid monthly. The dung collectors are all from Shandong province. Their organization is very strong. They often rely on their numbers to extort money at will. Residents often hate and fear them. They are called the "two valves" together with the water carriers. The water carriers are those who transport well water for drinking in homes without water pipes. These people set up carts at places with well water and deliver water door-to-door. The price is determined by the quality of the water. Most of them are also from Shandong province. (Old Beijing Anecdotes says that water carriers in the Ming dynasty were all from Shanxi province.) However, dung collectors are even more hated than water carriers. This is because water can be taken by oneself, but there is only one dung collector for each street, or several streets have one leader. If A does not come, then B will not come either. In the spring of the twentieth year, the municipal government planned to regulate the time for transporting dung, but it was stopped by a strike. The ferocity of their power is evident. Dung is transported in willow baskets on wheelbarrows. The baskets are loaded full and there is no cover. They sway and look like they are about to fall. Those who see them cannot help but avoid them. This is even more disgusting than those who push and pull them in the Shanghai concession. This is truly the shame of a great country. To get rid of this bad habit, the only way is to set up more public toilets so that these people have nothing to coerce. Or, strict orders can be made to improve them. Today, high-end residences all have their own water toilets.</p>
<p>The well water in Beijing is mostly bitter and salty and cannot be drunk. If deep wells are dug using Western methods and extracted by machine, this problem can be avoided. All homes without water pipes must drink machine well water. However, many middle-class homes have also installed water pipes. I remember when there were no water pipes, wealthy families took water from Yuquan, which was truly clear and cold. The water carts on the road marked with yellow flags and the words "for imperial use" were the water from Yuquan. In fact, all the city's waterways originate from Yuquan. Dredging and clarifying cannot be done properly. Otherwise, why would one travel dozens of miles to fetch water from outside the city?</p>
<p>Stop it. This Japanese military officer strides forward as if he is a martial arts performer on the Beijing opera stage. The American sailors in front of the 99 Ballroom watch him and laugh loudly. However, he is smug and displays the attitude of a citizen of a strong country.</p>
<p>Slogans are the most impractical thing. Now they are used to awaken the public. How effective they are is not known. However, they are inevitably hated by the Japanese. They want to use barbaric methods to destroy them without leaving any trace. They do not know that this is enough to increase people's resentment and hatred. As a result, the slogans are added more. This move is not only laborious and fruitless, but also completely wrong. Furthermore, this time the Japanese residents held a general meeting, mostly merchants. They harassed Chinese merchants with Japanese merchants, causing the latter to be even more determined to oppose Japan. The Japanese plan is wrong.</p>
<p>Another Record of the Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting Relief Fair</p>
<p>Feng</p>
<p>Ms. Yu Danhan and Ms. Tang Guanyu initiated the collection of ancient and modern celebrity calligraphy and paintings for a relief exhibition. When it was about to open, I recorded its outline. On the first day of the exhibition, I went to see the whole picture and spent two hours. I felt it was worth recording again. In the past, whenever there was a calligraphy and painting relief, the works were often flawed and less beautiful because they were donated. This made people not want to watch them for a long time. This time, all the works on display showed their strengths and were dazzling. Moreover, because of the exquisite mounting, they looked even more beautiful. This shows the compassionate heart of the donors and initiators, which makes people feel emotional. Among them, there are several hanging scrolls co-created by famous artists, which are particularly unique. He Tianjian's six large landscape hanging scrolls each have their own merits. I especially love his Willow Creek Late Ferry, which is majestic and beautiful. It imitates the Song dynasty and incorporates the artistic interests of the Yuan dynasty. It is a masterpiece. Ms. Feng Peihua painted a statue of the White-Robed Guanyin, with light blue clouds in the background. The solemn and wonderful appearance is quite able to escape. Wu Hufan wrote the inscription. Ms. Yu Danhan's landscape horizontal plaque is beautiful and thick. It is mounted on a fine frame. There is also Xiao Tui'an's seal couplet with the same number. Ms. Tang Guanyu's White Lotus hanging scroll and Pan Gongzhan's collection of Ding'an couplet with the same number are also beautiful and lovely. Ms. Yu Weidan's Peach Blossom Spring painting is very clear and moist. Di Pingzi's landscape is not easy to find. There is actually a landscape hanging scroll in ink and wash. There is also a couplet. This old man has many mountains and valleys in his chest, so his writing is not ordinary. The rest, such as Jia Yunhe's figures, Wu Hufan's landscapes, Mao Suihua and Sun Qionghua's ladies, Peng Shou's Buddha, Lu Shaopo's horse, and Xi Yuzhen and Gu Muzhen's landscapes, are all good. Among the ancient paintings, there is a number that is Zhang Yuejun's donation of ancient and modern celebrity calligraphy and painting fan faces, a total of twenty leaves. I feel that the most precious of them is Zhang Ziwan's dry brush landscape. (Relief for Disaster Relief)</p>

<p>The Pestle of Knocking on Dreams (12)</p>
<p>Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Tao Chi really wanted to see this female teacher who had appreciated him in advance, but he did not dare to act rashly. Hearing Mrs. Tang's summons, he felt as if he had received a general's order. He was willing to break his head under her pomegranate skirt for such a deeply indebted female teacher! There was also another hope; Tao Chi had personally seen the jade face of Miss Xiuying, the daughter of Military Governor Tang, when he was donating money at the Niangniang Temple. This was truly what Zhang Sheng said when he was visiting the temple: "I have seen thousands of things, but I have never seen such a lovely girl." Miss Xiuying's jade face was indeed unparalleled at the time. What Tao Chi was infatuated with, besides her jade face, was Miss Xiuying's double-hooked feet under her skirt. Tao Chi, who was not yet sitting on a wheelchair, was a new youth of the twentieth century. He believed that the evils of bound feet were the main reason for the decline of the Han people. Why was the national power of the Han and Tang dynasties able to reach foreign countries? It was only because the women of this time did not have bound feet, so the citizens who were born had this strong physique. Since the Zhao and Song dynasties, China has been singing the praises of an artificial beauty of bound feet, and the Han people have been languishing! They were lost to the Jurchens, then to the Mongols, and then to the Manchus. The citizens' physique lost its original strength. This was affected by the bound feet of women! Tao Chi, who was sitting on a wheelchair, had his mind influenced by the past era, and he would never have such thoughts again. Not only was he baptized by the eight-legged essay, he was especially a faithful believer in worshiping the slender golden lotuses. For Tang Xiuying's graceful bowing in front of the Niangniang statue, he had a very precise and deep understanding of Miss Xiuying's double-hooked feet under her skirt. Since the Qingming Festival to after the Chongyang Festival, the beauty of Tang Xiuying's whole body, especially her slender lotus feet, had already occupied half of Tao Chi's heart! The remaining half was occupied by the pre-emptive eight-legged essay. Based on this, it can be seen that Tao Chi's lifelong love was only for books and beauties. This sentence is still too broad in scope. In reality, what he loved was only the eight-legged essay in the book and the slender lotus hooks under the beauty's skirt. This time he picked the first branch of the laurel, and his eight-legged essay had already obtained a considerable price: he happily went to visit this female teacher. After visiting the female teacher, he had the possibility of getting close to this senior sister or junior sister - Miss Tang Xiuying.</p>
<p>"Tsk! Strange! A top-ranked scholar in the imperial examination goes to the Governor's yamen to visit his teacher! Tsk! Strange! A top-ranked scholar in the imperial examination goes to pay respects to the Governor-General's wife!" This was the sighing and strange sound in the mouths of people on the streets.</p>

<p>Financial Gold Market is Confusing</p>
<p>Results Fall One or Two or Three Coins</p>
<p>Bulls and Bears Confront Each Other, Confused and Helpless</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold price showed a chaotic appearance, changing in an instant, unstoppable, often fluctuating four or five taels, a total of sixteen or seventeen taels throughout the day, with turbulent waves, confused and helpless, and people panicked. In the end, it fell slightly by one tael. The buying side was strong, probably because silver bullion has not yet risen. The opening was low, but then the draft rebounded from loose to firm. This was because Heng Xing Sheng Da and others worked hard to buy. It is said that it was to cover short positions, and they also privately purchased Japanese drafts. This has been cursed by the industry as unscrupulous. However, the market atmosphere suddenly became sharp and exciting, and the price surged by more than ten taels, suddenly breaking out of the 700 tael mark. However, by noon, the atmosphere was bad, and the selling side seemed strong. It turned weak again, shedding eight or nine taels. The later market fluctuated greatly, initially flat and then weak. Then the sellers showed their courage, and then the Cantonese bankers continued to advance, and finally it became eased, but it revolved outside of 690 taels. In short, the number of bars was limited, and the industry's intentions were hesitant, especially because the bulls and bears seemed to be confronting each other.</p>
<p>Cantonese Bankers Covered Short Positions, Once Sharp and Exciting. The opening price dropped by four and a half taels to 691 taels. The price of large bars was expected to fall, but it rose by one-sixteenth. The price of silver was not available due to the holiday market. Because of buying activity, it increased from 90 taels and 2 qian to 93 taels and 4 qian. However, the price of the US dollar seemed loose. The bank bought it for 33 yuan. Afterwards, Dalian bankers Shun Li and others sold it, and it immediately fell by more than five taels to 88 taels at 9:12. At that time, it was heard that HSBC was absorbing US dollars at 32.9375 yuan. Shanghai bought January English gold at 18, and then increased it to 91 and a half taels, but the sellers were not fresh, and the US dollar had to be sold for 33 yuan, so it immediately fell by more than three taels. The English gold price was not changed, and it was 88 taels and 1 qian. HSBC absorbed 33 yuan, and also absorbed English gold at 180625. Then the market situation began to stabilize, so the price rose happily. However, there were two or three taels of ups and downs from time to time. At ten o'clock, it hovered around 700 taels. Tong Taichang, Zhi Fengyong, Cui Changyong, Heng Xing, Yuan Xingyong, Sen Changyong and others all bought in. Later, Heng Xing and Sheng Da continued to advance tirelessly. The exchange rate was also strong, with English gold at 17875 and US dollars at 32.5625, all of which were taken in by the Huashang Bank. As a result, the market atmosphere became more lively, and it rose by another three or four taels to outside of 700 taels. At 11 o'clock, it reached 04 taels and 5 qian. The industry re-plucked US dollars, from 32 and a half yuan to 4375. After entering, Zhi Fengyong, Yu Da, Tong Taichang and others took this opportunity to sell, and due to the situation, they fell by more than 9 taels to 95 and a half taels at 11:40. Shortly afterwards, it increased to 98 taels and 23 qian, until the noon closed at 97 taels, the Indian Exchange did not change. After the market closed, it was made to about 6 taels. The announced price was still more than 750 taels, and the reduction was 667 taels to 50 taels. The noon closed was about 60 taels.</p>
<p>Fluctuations Were Even Greater, but in the End it Looked Tired</p>
<p>The later market opened at 95 taels and 5, followed by 7 taels and 3 qian. Afterwards, sellers were excited, such as Yuan Mao, Zhi Fengyong, Fu Chang, Tong Taichang, Shun Li and others sold out one after another, and the US dollar was also loose, at 32.875 yuan. However, the wheat line absorbed 32.6875 to 75, and then released 625 to 6875, so the gold price fluctuated by two taels. Until after 3 o'clock, the US dollar had to be at 32.875 yuan, and English gold at 180625. Banks made transactions with each other, and the gold price was only 89 taels and 5 qian. Zhi Fengyong and Da Xingyong and others entered the market to buy, and the wheat line bought US dollars at 75, so after more than ten minutes, it increased by 4 taels to 93 taels and 8 qian at 3:30. Shun Li and Fu Chang sold, and it was suppressed to 89 taels and 3 qian. Heng Xing suddenly entered, and it reappeared its peak. HSBC bought November US dollars at 32.8125 yuan, and then released 75, and the gold price soared by six or seven taels, but there were two taels of fluctuations. At 4:20, it reached 96 taels and 7 qian. Unexpectedly, Shun Li and others still sold out. At 4:30, the market closed at 94 taels and 2 qian, and continued to do to about 4 taels. Compared with the day before yesterday, it fell by one tael and three qian. According to the city, the largest was 704 taels and 5, and the smallest was 688 taels, with a total of 16 and a half taels of twists and turns. The early market for goods was 91 taels, the noon closed was 96 taels, and the afternoon was 6 taels and 2 qian. The market closed at 4 taels. According to the announced price, the reduction was 60 taels, the registered price was 97 taels, the make-up water was 97 taels, and the later market was 94 taels. The current red bar has increased to 18 taels.</p>
<p>The Transactions of Each Company Were Complicated and Unstable</p>
<p>On the trading floor, transactions were complicated and divergent. According to statistics, Heng Xing, Sheng Da, Yuan Xingyong, Bing Xing, Cui Changyong, Zhi Fengyong, Da Decheng, Yuan Tai, Sen Changyong, Yi Feng and others all entered, Yi Fengyong and Tong Taichang, Yu Da, entered and exited irregularly, Fu Chang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Da Xingyong, Qian Changxiang, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Taiheng and others all sold out short positions. It is said that the speculator Wu sold out a little. In the afternoon, Heng Xing, Yi Fengyong, Yi Feng, Tian Fengyong, Heng Yu, Da Xingyong, Yuan Mao Yong all entered, and Tong Taichang, Shun Li, Yuan Mao, Fu Chang all exited. Wan Xing and Zhi Fengyong Da Decheng had many entries and exits. Cantonese bankers bought in about 4,000 bars, which was to cover short positions, with occasional hedging. They sold English gold and entered Japanese gold. Dalian bankers sold 2,000, which was to sell long positions, and entered 4 to 5 million bars. The report of the large bar of silver fell</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported from London on the 13th that the price of large silver bars suddenly decreased, with the short-term price being one-quarter less at 17 pence and 25, and the long-term price being 17 and a half pence, which was also one-eighth and seventy-five less than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate Changed Several Times a Day</p>
<p>The Posted Price Did Not Change</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of English silver rose slightly, and the price of American silver was not available. The exchange rate also rose, but the happy market was still flat and there were no major changes. As for the HSBC posted price in Shanghai, it did not move.

<p>Two Gunshots Rumble, Bullets Like Rain, Hostage Safe and Sound</p>
<p>After a Fierce Battle with Bandits, Zhang Xilin Luckily Escapes Danger; Western Detective Chief Hit by Two Bullets, Nineteen Male and Female Bandits Captured</p>
<p>Zhang Xilin, a local resident and owner of Lishengchang Silk Store at No. 147 Shandong Road in the Public Concession, was returning to the store in a hired car at 6:50 PM on the 2nd of this month. As he took off his long gown, preparing for dinner, a group of bandits suddenly barged in, forcibly dragged him to the intersection of Fuzhou Road and a Chinese-Western pharmacy, stuffed him into car number 8381 parked by the roadside, and the bandit driver sped south, disappearing without a trace. That night, the car was found in the desolate suburbs of western Shanghai. After the case was reported, the relevant General Inspectorate immediately investigated the car owner and found it belonged to Wang Zhaolin. However, Wang's driver, Shi Zhongfu from Danyang, had also disappeared on the same day, so it was suspected that Shi was involved. Not long after the car was discovered, Shi was also found in the Yangshupu area, but his hands and feet were tied with ropes, and his mouth was stuffed with cotton. The police brought Shi to the station and interrogated him repeatedly. He finally confessed to colluding with the bandits, binding his hands and feet as a cover-up. He also identified three other members of the gang: Xiao Wang, Tian Chengxiang, and Yan Shaoshan. He claimed that Yan had borrowed the car from him. The police then detained Shi and secretly investigated. Two detectives, Huang Fusen and Jiang Shangpei, knew that Tian Chengxiang lived at No. 1017 Siwenli, Datong Road, New Gate. Based on Shi's confession that Tian was a bandit, they went to arrest him, but he had already fled. Inquiries with neighbors revealed that no one knew his whereabouts. Later, they learned from a former neighbor that Tian had moved to No. 32 Gaofuli, Rue de la Maternité in the French Concession. Detective Huang went to investigate and saw a sign at the door that read "Li Ming, Lawyer's Assistant," and a red paper posted on the wall advertising the rental of the remaining rooms on the third floor. On the morning of Double Ten Day, Detective Huang disguised himself as a groom and took his wife, pretending to be a newly married couple, to rent the remaining rooms. Tian Chengxiang was inside. Upon hearing the knocking, he opened the door. Detective Huang observed his appearance, which closely matched the photo obtained by the police, confirming that he was indeed Tian Chengxiang. He asked Tian about the monthly rent for the remaining rooms, falsely claiming that he was an actor who had just arrived from Beiping. Tian said the monthly rent was thirty yuan. Huang asked for a slight reduction, and Tian said it was negotiable. Huang then said that he needed to bring his parents to see the place before finalizing the deal, shook hands with Tian, and agreed to meet again in the afternoon. Due to the lack of necessary procedures, they did not want to act rashly. It wasn't until 4 PM on the 12th that Chief Detective Zhang Zhiqin, Detectives Geng Debiao, Wu Chunrong, Kang Zengxiang, Pang Jinshan, Ma Mouxiang, Pi Bingzhang, Detectives Huang Fusen, Jiang Shangpei, Zhang Liansheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Deputy Western Detectives Mei Sheng and Mike Warren, all heavily armed, rushed to the scene and arrested Tian Chengxiang. The detectives knew that this place was a secret meeting place for the bandits, and there must be other gang members coming and going. They didn't believe that only Tian was living there. So they sent a team of detectives to stay inside the house and wait. At 7 PM that evening, Xu Agen came to knock on the door. The detectives inside opened the door. When Xu saw that it was not his gang members, he realized something was wrong and tried to escape, but he was caught by the detectives. He confessed that Xiao Wang had asked him to deliver opium paste. The detectives considered Xiao Wang the main suspect in the case, so they urgently inquired about Xiao Wang's whereabouts. Xu said that he was hiding in Room 16 of the Aido Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. They went to arrest him and also apprehended Xu Jianqing and Jiang Ronglin. Soon after, Tang Yiqi and a woman named Bao Liushi entered the hotel and were also arrested. They learned that Xiao Wang's real name was Miao Xingyuan (also known as Lao San), and Bao Liushi was Miao's mistress. Miao also revealed that Yan Shaoshan was hiding in Room 15 of the Renfeng Hotel on Minquan Road. At 3:30 AM yesterday morning, the detectives rushed to the Renfeng Hotel and brought Yan and his wife, Ms. Yu, to the police station. When questioned about the location of the hostage, Yan initially denied it. Realizing he couldn't evade responsibility, he said that if they wanted to know the location of the hostage, they should first go to No. 832 McGonaghy Road in western Shanghai and arrest Xu Heyun, who would be able to reveal it. Since the area Yan mentioned fell under the jurisdiction of the 6th District Police Station, the detectives went to the address and arrested Xu and Wu Futai. Under questioning, Xu revealed the location of the hostage. Only then did they learn that Zhang Xilin was being held in a flat in Gong's residence, west of Zhoujiaqiao on Lincoln Avenue. Chinese and Western detective chiefs, detectives, and officers donned bulletproof vests, armed themselves, and went to raid the bandits' den. It was already dawn. When they arrived, Deputy Western Detective Mike Warren forcibly destroyed the door and charged in. They saw two bandits sleeping beside the living room. As they were about to arrest them, the two bandits woke up and grabbed pistols from their pillows, resisting arrest. The Chinese detectives who followed Mike also opened fire, wounding Liu Jinrong. The remaining bandit, Jin Yuxiang, immediately surrendered. The detectives then tried to enter the room downstairs where the hostage was being held. However, Jiang Huiliang, the bandit guarding the hostage in the room, and a female bandit had been awakened by the gunshots and were firing out of the room. The detectives outside fired back into the room. Gunshots thundered and bullets rained down. After exchanging over ten shots each, Jiang fell wounded to the ground. The female bandit, unable to resist alone, surrendered. Unfortunately, Deputy Western Detective Mike was wearing a steel vest that extended to his knees, which restricted his movement. He had rolled up the bottom edge, leaving his lower abdomen unprotected. He was hit by two bullets in the lower abdomen, suffering severe injuries. Fortunately, the hostage, Zhang Xilin, lying in the room, was unharmed, even though he was surrounded by bullets. He was terrified, but extremely lucky. The detectives rescued him and sent the two wounded bandits, Liu and Jiang, to the nearby Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Mike was sent to the Country Hospital, but his injuries were serious and life-threatening. Xu Heyun, Jin Yushu, and the female bandit were temporarily held at the 6th District Police Station. Zhang Xilin was escorted back to his store, while the detectives guarding the bandits' den at No. 22 Rue de la Maternité continued to capture nine more individuals from the previous night to yesterday morning: Wang Xingcun, who claimed to be Li Ming's lawyer's assistant, Yao Junde, Cao Deyu, Wang Xiting, Gao Qingfu, Lu Pinyu, Gu Hengyu, Hong Jingshan, and Xu Xifu. Together with those previously arrested, a total of nineteen men and women were escorted to the First Special District Court at 9 AM. Judge Xu Jiashi presided over the first criminal court trial. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, explained the circumstances of the case, stating that all the captured bandits were ringleaders, but the evidence was still under investigation. He requested an extension to conduct further investigation and file charges according to the law. Judge Xu then questioned the Chinese and Western detectives about the circumstances of the arrest and approved the police's request, ordering the bandits to be detained for further interrogation. As for the three men and women temporarily detained in the 6th District, the detectives had already gone to the police station yesterday afternoon to bring them back to the General Inspectorate for further investigation.</p>

<p>Ji Fotuo, also known as Jue Mi, from Suining County, Xuzhou, was the chief accountant of the late Shanghai's sole major landowner, Silas Hardoon. Over fifty years old, he had gained the trust of Hardoon's wife, Luo Jialing, and, through a series of events, had become the manager of the Aili Garden. Anyone who knew the great landowner Silas Hardoon knew Ji Fotuo. With Hardoon's passing, Ji became even more of a center of attention. Yesterday morning, Ji went to the Hardoon Foreign Firm on Nanjing Road as usual, and then returned to Aili Garden for lunch at noon. In the afternoon around 3 PM, he accompanied Luo Jialing on an outing before returning to the residence. Around 7 PM in the evening, Ji left alone in his car to visit friends. At around 7:30 PM, on his return, as the car approached the corner of Moulmein Road and Weihaiwei Road, a car with five bandits lying in wait suddenly rushed out, brandishing pistols and blocking the way. Two bandits jumped onto Ji's car from either side, trying to pry open the car door. Ji, sitting inside, realized he was being attacked and held onto the door handle with all his might. Both sides struggled. Unexpectedly, the bandits exerted too much force, and the gun in his hand accidentally fired. Another bandit, who was helping, was struck in the hand by a stray bullet. The gunshot alerted nearby Indian police, who rushed to the scene. The bandits, realizing they couldn't get their hands on the money, jumped back into their car and fired three shots into the air as a warning, speeding away. Ji's driver was quick-thinking and immediately sped west, driving directly to the Jing'an Temple Road police station to report the incident, and then returned to the garden to rest. The police dispatched a large number of detectives to search the area, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Crying Child on Beijing-Shanghai Train</p>
<p>Hostage Kidnapped from Huangdai, Suzhou</p>
<p>Kidnappers Are Teahouse Staff and Accomplice</p>
<p>Zhong Zizhi, a farmer from Yangduantou, Huangdai, Suzhou, owned over twenty mu of fertile land. Having married three wives, he only had one son, Tong Sheng, who was twelve years old. Gentle as a girl, he was loved as a precious gem. Because Zhong's family was well-off, he was targeted by hooligans in the village. They went to Shanghai and gathered a group of kidnappers, mostly teahouse staff and pimps from brothels, many of whom were from Huangdai. On the 8th of this month, they hired a motorboat in Suzhou and sailed to the front of Zhong's house in Yangduantou. Originally, they intended to go ashore and kidnap Tong Sheng, but the children in the countryside were ignorant and rushed to watch the sudden arrival of the motorboat. Tong Sheng was among them. The kidnappers, upon seeing Tong Sheng, realized that he was exactly who they were looking for, and without much effort, kidnapped Tong Sheng onto the motorboat and sped away. When Zhong Zizhi received the news and arrived, he could only sigh and grieve. He immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau to investigate. After the kidnappers kidnapped Zhong Tong Sheng, they ordered Xu Tianxun and Chen Jinshui to take the child to Shanghai first. They immediately took the train to Shanghai outside Qimen, threatening the child on the train not to make a sound. However, Tong Sheng was twelve years old and knew a little about the world. Fear turned into terror, and he began to cry softly. When the train arrived in Kunshan, the railway police saw two men escorting a child who was crying. Suspecting something was wrong, they questioned them. The child said they were forcing him to come with them. Realizing it was a kidnapping, they arrested them and escorted them to the Jinghu Railway Police Department. Zhong Tong Sheng confessed everything. Xu Tianxun claimed to be a waiter at the Xinan Hotel in the French Concession. Chen Jinshui claimed to be an accomplice in a brothel, admitting to kidnapping for ransom but refusing to reveal the names of his accomplices. After further questioning by the police chief, the kidnapping suspects were transferred to the local court for further investigation.</p>
<p>Two High Tides in Shanghai Last Night and This Afternoon</p>
<p>Low-Lying Roads Flooded</p>
<p>Due to the high water level of the Yangtze River and strong winds, the tide was unusually high last night and this afternoon. Low-lying roads in the Public Concession were flooded with several inches of water. It was reported that the high tide last night reached 14.25 feet on the Wusong Customs water gauge, 12.62 feet higher than the lowest low tide in Shanghai, but 1.9 feet lower than the two great storms on August 25th.</p>
<p>News of Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Executive Committee of Various Provincial Flood Relief Associations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Various Provincial Flood Relief held an executive committee meeting at the City General Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Attendees included Xu Shiying, Wang Xiaolai, Qu Wenliu, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Ha Shaofu, Chu Huiseng, Lin Kanghou, Huang Hanzhi, Wu Zhihao, Li Zuyu, Zhang Zhijiang (represented by Weng Guoxun), Mao Youfeng, Sun Choucheng, Cheng Guichu, Ye Jiaxing, Wang Peiyuan, Xu Peihuang, Zhou Xinchu, Zhang Yichen, Chen Guangfu, Guan Yunnong, Chen Jicheng, Yu Zhiang, Pan Xulun, Wang Yiting, Shen Tianxin, Gu Junyang, Zhang Zhizeng, Zhang Gongquan, and representatives from the Jiangxi Flood Relief Association, including Hu Siyi, Lu Fang, Ding Yihong, Wang Mingxuan, and others, totaling dozens. Xu Shiying was elected as chairman and Yang Yunqin as secretary. The chairman first reported on the income and expenditure figures and the disaster relief efforts in various provinces. Qu Wenliu reported that the amount of donations received was decreasing, and if efforts to raise funds were not stepped up, it would be difficult to continue the winter relief efforts, especially since emergency relief was still needed in Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu. Next, Lu Fang, representing the Jiangxi Flood Relief Association, reported that after the bandit disasters in Jiangxi, there were subsequent military disasters, spreading to 60 counties, with more than 40 counties being severely affected. Counties along Poyang Lake were completely submerged, and he asked that more attention be paid to emergency relief in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Matters discussed:</p>
<p>(1) The previous general meeting resolved to encourage major real estate companies to donate one to two months of rent, which would be the largest donation to the association. However, so far, only a few have responded. The question was, how to facilitate this matter. Weng Guoxun proposed inviting major landlords to a banquet and asking the Lawyers Association for help. Li Zuyu suggested first conducting a survey and then hosting the banquet. Zhang Xiaolin reported on his discussions with Mrs. Hardoon, stating that she might be able to donate one month's rent to aid in the disaster relief after her family's legal matters were resolved. It was resolved to establish a fundraising committee for rent, and the following individuals were immediately appointed as members: Wang Xiaolai, Li Zuyu, Wang Yiting, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Ziqiao, Wu Zhihao, Chu Huiseng, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jingren, Lu Shaotang, Ye Shantao, Ying Ziyun, Huang Yanfang, Pan Xulun, Zhong Kecheng, Yu Qiaqing, and Zhang Xiaoliang. Zhang Xiaolin was tasked with convening the committee.</p>
<p>(2) As emergency relief was about to end and winter relief was about to begin, cotton clothing was most needed. In the past, the Flood Relief Association was responsible for making cotton clothing, so this association did not prepare any besides soliciting old clothes. Now, Zhu Ziqiao's reply stated that cotton was difficult to purchase and could not be produced in large quantities. As winter was approaching, how should this association continue to solicit old cotton clothing to provide relief? It was resolved to task the standing committee with planning and handling this matter.</p>
<p>(3) Since its establishment, all donations received by the association had been voluntarily submitted by donors, and the association had not sent anyone out to solicit donations. Now, as winter relief was urgent, how should a fundraising committee be appointed to solicit donations door-to-door? It was resolved to task the fundraising group with planning and carrying out this task.</p>
<p>Work of the Sino-Foreign Relief Society in Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Second Batch of Cotton Clothing Shipped to Yangzhou</p>
<p>The first batch of cotton clothing from the Sino-Foreign Relief Society had already been shipped. Yesterday, a second batch of 125 bales of cotton clothing, totaling 5,000 pieces, and five boxes of hygiene clothing, were shipped to the disaster areas of Yangzhou, Taizhou, Dongtai, Xinghua, and Yancheng. Each area received 1,000 pieces of cotton clothing and one box of hygiene shirts. They were shipped on the Datong wheel. In Qingjiangpu, ten packages of old clothes, totaling 2,067 pieces, were shipped yesterday.</p>
<p>Ordering Flour for Distribution in Relief Efforts</p>
<p>The disaster relief work in the Yangzhou branch has been very intense recently, and there is an urgent need for flour. Yesterday, the Shanghai headquarters ordered 1,500 bags of No. 4 flour from Shenda, which will be shipped to Yangzhou soon.</p>
<p>Xinghua Branch Reports Difficulties</p>
<p>Ke Weilian from the Xinghua Branch reported in a letter that the disaster area was vast and the relief funds were limited. They could only prioritize providing relief to those living in thatched huts and temporary shelters, and temporarily exclude those who still had houses to live in, but their need for relief was also very urgent. On the 5th, the flour that was transported to them was distributed to approximately 6,000 people, with each person receiving about 10 to 20 catties. Winter was approaching, and the disaster situation was becoming more urgent. 70% of the houses in various places had been destroyed, and countless families were now living in small boats, without clothing or food, eagerly awaiting the arrival of cotton clothing to save their lives. However, the number of disaster victims was numerous, and the relief funds were insufficient.</p>
<p>Xiamen Jiangsheng Daily Ends Fundraising</p>
<p>Over 6,900 Yuan Remitted Yesterday</p>
<p>Total Exceeds 32,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Xiamen Jiangsheng Daily, in view of the severe floods in various provinces and the urgent need for funds, set up a disaster relief office in the newspaper. Since the beginning of fundraising on the 9th of last month, it has achieved considerable success, remitting funds to Shanghai five times to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao for distribution to the disaster areas. The amount already exceeded 26,000 yuan. Now that the one-month fundraising period had expired, the newspaper had ended its efforts and remitted all the funds received to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao. However, counties outside of Xiamen were still collecting donations, and they would continue to remit funds when a significant amount had been accumulated. All expenses related to the collection of donations were paid by the newspaper itself, and no disaster relief funds were used. The newspaper sent the following telegram to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao:</p>
<p>Shanghai Wuchen News Agency forwards to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao: Our newspaper's one-month fundraising has ended. We are remitting 6,987 yuan and 1 jiao and 9 fen via China and South Bank. Together with the previous remittances, the total is 32,987 yuan and 1 jiao and 9 fen. Please collect the funds. Outer regions are still collecting. We will remit again when a significant amount is accumulated. Xiamen Jiangsheng Daily.</p>

<p>At the Request of the National Government's Flood Disaster Committee</p>

<p>Anhui Flood Relief Association Hosts Press</p>
<p>Thousands of Miles of Weeping in Northern Anhui</p>
<p>The floods in 21 counties in northern Anhui were particularly severe this time, with thousands of miles of weeping and widespread mourning. Due to transportation difficulties, the outside world has paid little attention. The Anhui Flood Relief Committee sent Chen Ziheng, Gao Weixuan, Li Zhuxi, and Yang Yaonan to Beijing and Shanghai to appeal to the relevant authorities and domestic and foreign charities. Last night at 7 PM, Chen, Yang, and Li hosted a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant for the press and fellow Anhui natives. Reporters from various newspapers and Xu Shiying and others attended. The three representatives gave speeches, requesting the press to publicize the disaster situation in northern Anhui to save the millions of disaster victims there. The banquet ended around 9 PM.</p>

<p>Ningbo Industrial Bank Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Ningbo Industrial Bank has received support and assistance from all sectors, and subscriptions have been very enthusiastic. It has now collected its full share capital, and all preparations have been completed. The bank held an inaugural meeting at the Ningbo Guildhall on Xizang Road, Ningbo Road, at 2 PM yesterday. 126 shareholders attended, and Wang Bao of the Social Affairs Bureau was present to offer guidance. Xiang Songmao was elected chairman, announced the purpose of the meeting, and reported on the preparatory process, stating that the bank's motivation to develop and promote Zhejiang industry came about in June of this year, when Mr. Zhuang Songfu and others discussed plans to develop industry. In particular, they recognized the great potential of the Zhejiang fishing industry, which had been exploited due to the lack of fishermen's knowledge. The lack of financial institutions had led to the decline of the fishing industry. By extension, factories in Shanghai also lacked working capital, impeding their development. The shareholders agreed that industrial development required financial institutions. Fellow villagers were invited to form the Ningbo Industrial Bank and subscribe to shares. The response was enthusiastic. Although the country had been hit by floods in more than ten provinces, and Japan's violence and aggression in the Northeast, the shareholders were still enthusiastic about industry and invested diligently. The capital of 500,000 yuan had been fully subscribed. He announced the establishment of the bank and presented shareholders with the accounts of the establishment expenses for their approval. After the report, the chairman read the articles of association, which were discussed and amended article by article and passed. The shareholders proposed a plan to remedy the situation of shareholders who had not yet subscribed to all the shares. It was decided to increase the capital of the bank by 250,000 yuan, which would be raised by the board of directors and reported to the shareholders' meeting. The meeting adjourned around 6 PM. After that, voting began to elect the directors and supervisors. Lu Qisheng, Chen Zifu, Cao Guohua, and Yu Guozhen were appointed by the shareholders to count the votes. The election results were as follows: Xiang Songmao, He Shaoting, Wu Zhihao, Qin Xiqing, Yu Guozhen, Wang Boyuan, Xu Maotang, Wu Zhihe, Cao Guohua, Chen Zifu, Zhuang Songfu, Dong Zhongxiu, and Yang Songren were elected as directors with the most votes. He Shaoyu, Guo Yonglan, and Lin Kanghou were elected as supervisors. The meeting adjourned after the elections, after 10 PM.</p>
<p>Anthrax in Danyang Farming Cattle</p>
<p>Commercial Inspection Bureau Prepares to Send Personnel for Second Round of Relief</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department reported that more than 40 farming cattle kept by the Danyang Bao Cattle Committee in the disaster area had fallen ill, and telegraphed the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to send personnel with serum and medicine for relief. The bureau dispatched veterinarian Cheng Shaodi and technician Shou Biao to Danyang. After a thorough diagnosis, they confirmed that the cattle were suffering from anthrax, which was extremely virulent. Affected cattle would often eat normally in the afternoon, but suddenly jump for a few minutes in the evening and then die. Four cattle had already died from the disease. The disease was easily transmitted not only to domestic animals, but also to humans. Treatment and prevention required injection of anthrax serum to achieve immunity. Since the bureau did not yet manufacture this serum, it telegraphed the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau to have a specialist send a large quantity of anthrax serum. They are currently waiting for a reply from the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department and will then send Dr. Cheng and technician Shou to Danyang immediately with the serum for injections and strict disinfection to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>After Liu Siqiao's Tragic Death, His Son Baoshan Passes Away</p>
<p>Pan Shiqiu Stops Paying Educational Expenses</p>
<p>Liu's Wife Sues, Requesting Support for Her Daughter</p>
<p>Liu Siqiao, a Chinese medicine practitioner residing at No. 89 Ping Le Li, Xizang Road, was accidentally hit and killed by a car driven by Pan Shiqiu, son of Pan Mingxun, residing at No. 658 Kang Le Li, Beishanxi Road, on April 7 of last year. After mediation by relatives and friends, an agreement was reached in which Pan Shiqiu would pay for the education of Liu Siqiao's son, Baoshan, until he graduated from a university in China. The annual cost of schooling, food, and books was set at 350 yuan. However, Liu Baoshan suddenly died of illness on March 6 of this year, and Pan stopped paying the school expenses. Liu's wife, Ms. Li, hired Jiang Yiping as her lawyer and filed a suit in the First Special District Court, requesting the court to order Pan Shiqiu to fulfill the agreement. During the hearing yesterday, the plaintiff stated that although Liu Baoshan had unfortunately passed away, the original intention of the agreement was to support the orphans so that the plaintiff would have someone to rely on in the future. Now that Baoshan was dead, the late husband had five daughters. Based on the principle of equality between sons and daughters under current laws, and the intent of the settlement agreement, the plaintiff should be allowed to designate one of the five daughters to continue receiving the tuition fees from the defendant. Now that Baoshan was still studying in middle school preparatory classes, there were still ten years until he graduated from a university in China, and it was proposed that these tuition fees be transferred to the second daughter, Baojuan. However, despite repeated requests, the defendant had refused to agree, using evasive excuses. Moreover, both parties were concerned about future disputes, and the plaintiff requested a one-time payment of 3,500 yuan. Next, the defendant's lawyer stated that his client had not arrived. He stated, "The agreement states that 'If Liu Baoshan's studies are neglected, and he is held back twice, or if he commits a serious offense that leads to his expulsion from school, Pan will stop providing educational expenses.' From this, it can be inferred that Pan's provision of tuition fees to Baoshan was entirely due to Baoshan's intelligence and lovability, in the hope that he would be successful, and the intent was entirely to cultivate Baoshan alone. Now that Baoshan had unfortunately passed away, the purpose of his education had been lost, and the obligation to pay should be terminated." The judge advised the defendant to make a one-time payment of 1,000 yuan to settle the matter. The defendant's lawyer agreed on behalf of his client. However, the plaintiff refused, and the judge ordered the lawyers for both parties to begin their arguments and set a date for the verdict.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council to Build a Roberts Road Market</p>
<p>Construction to Begin Soon</p>
<p>Roberts Road, located on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, is lined with factories and is an important transportation hub. The market has been prosperous in recent years, changing rapidly. However, there is no suitable market, and the citizens feel very inconvenienced. Although the Municipal Council has long had a plan to build one, there was no suitable address. Recently, the Council, recognizing that financial institutions were also setting up branches in the area and that the progress of the market was astonishing, decided that the plan could not be delayed any longer. It negotiated with the landowners on Roberts Road and Xiaoshadu Road to allocate more than three mu of land to build a large-scale market to meet the needs. Construction is expected to begin soon.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Graft Bandit Xu Shaofu Arrested and Awaiting Transfer</p>
<p>Xu Shaofu, also known as Xi Ling, from Nanchang, Jiangxi, has long been restless. Hiding in Shanghai, he runs a wild chicken brothel. Since the founding of the Republic, he has established a secret agency in Nanchang to lure young women with the promise of high-paying employment as maids. He brings two or three batches to Shanghai each year. Those who are lured here are first raped and then sent to brothels to work as prostitutes. There are hundreds of Jiangxi prostitutes in the Nanyang Bridge area of the French Concession, all lured by this bandit. The women, having entered the tiger's mouth, have no respite from the heat or cold, rain or snow. They wait on the streets, and if they are unable to find customers, they are severely punished by the pimps, working all night long. Xu Shaofu profits handsomely and has many accomplices. If any of the prostitutes disobeys, they are beaten severely, so no one dares to resist. Although he was arrested by the police two years ago, he was soon released, and his audacity grew. He also colludes with Communists through prostitutes. Last year, when bandits ran rampant in Nanchang, he returned to Nanchang, robbing and killing. After the incident, he fled back to Shanghai. Recently, someone in Nanchang reported him, so the Jiangxi Provincial Government telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Command to request his arrest and transfer for investigation. The detectives were about to investigate when Xu Shaofu arrived in Shanghai from Jiujiang with six abducted women, staying at the Ganhu Customs Office in Daigouqiao. The detectives arrested him and the women and sent them to the Garrison Command. They are now requesting extradition for prosecution. The residents of Jiangxi in Shanghai are rejoicing.</p>
<p>Zhang Shaowen Collects Money Amid National Crisis</p>
<p>Falsely Claims to Be Member of China Youth National Salvation Brave Corps</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invasion of Liaoning and Jilin, anti-Japanese associations and anti-Japanese groups have sprung up everywhere in China. However, some unscrupulous individuals have taken advantage of this to swindle money under false pretenses, and the authorities have taken strict measures to crack down on them. Yesterday, another young man, carrying a leather bag and dressed in fashionable clothes, like a staff member of an institution, was soliciting donations from shops in the Sixteenth Ward of Nanjing. He claimed that he had gathered many comrades to organize a China Youth National Salvation Brave Corps, but they lacked funds and it was difficult to carry out their work, so he had come to solicit donations, hoping that they would be happy to donate. The shops each donated one yuan or less, and the man issued a receipt and gave them a badge as a souvenir. The donors believed him to be genuine. Soon after, the man entered the Changshun Pig Shop in Yonganli to solicit donations. Zhang Renjie from Jiading, an employee of the shop, had never heard of the China Youth National Salvation Brave Corps, and had not seen it mentioned in the newspapers. Suspecting that he was swindling money under false pretenses, he asked about his background. The man stammered and seemed suspicious. Zhang Renjie immediately called the patrol officer Wang Bingkui, who took him to the First District Police Station. During the preliminary trial, the young man stated that his name was Zhang Shaowen, 28 years old, from Hankou, and he was currently staying at the Shunxing Hotel in Dongxinqiao in the French Concession. He claimed that the China Youth National Salvation Brave Corps was organized by Wei Junpei and was located at No. 25 Shundeli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. He said, "I am a member of the corps. Because the corps lacks funds</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Case of a Police Inspector Arresting Europeans for Gambling: Bai Lianxing, a patrol officer from the Tianning Temple Police Station in Jiaxing, recently led police with a ladder and at night, dug into the Hengchang Tea Shop on North Main Street and searched the upper floor, finding mahjong tiles which he claimed were being used for gambling. He also beat the shop apprentice Zhang Shaowu, took him to the station, and after the Chief Gao's judgment, fined him. Subsequently, the mother raised the fine and bailed him out. She took the victim to court to verify the injury. The court has set the 14th to summon witnesses for trial. Now, as this case concerns police reputation, a third party has come forward to mediate, removing Patrol Officer Bai from his post and punishing the three police officers involved in the assault separately. Chief Gao has agreed, and Bai was removed from his post on the 12th. At the same time, the three police officers handling the case were also dismissed and replacements were sent. Therefore, the Zhang family has also filed a request to drop the charges.</p>
