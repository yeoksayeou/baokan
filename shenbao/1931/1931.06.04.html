<p>曁南女生與交通女生先作女錦標之决賽二隊經過猛烈之竸爭曁南反敗爲勝三比二勝交大而獲錦標</p>
<p>全仗運氣曁南交通兩隊實力相仿上下無幾故昨日之勝負均决之於幸運比數之接近可見一斑曁南先勝一局交通反勝二局二比一佔勝利曁南又勝一局成二比二均勢第五局之决賽最後五分鐘之劇烈緊張無以復加十八十八後又成二十比二十交大加上一分成二十一比二十時交大發球曁南失誤交大以爲得勝歡呼大起而裁判宣告死球重發運氣當頭曁南連昨遂獲錦標</p>
<p>風雲不測五局比賽經過略述之交通先攻吳世英發球連得二分第一次曁南黃如霜還拍過重球飛出界交通遂獲一分嗣曁南鄧志君亦得二分二比後相互被殺及張　蓀準而有力連得六分交通十一比六勝上半局惜此後錯誤百出位置失誤第一局竟以十七比二十一失敗勝負之不能預測者有如此第二局交通小心作戰謹愼非凡頓見振作上半局上一比四大勝曁南亦加鞭追上成數次平手交大卒以二十一比十九各勝一局繼續小心作戰交通又勝第三局反以二比一勝戰心一寛以爲可稍放鬆於是錯誤漸出連失二局曁南則反扶搖直上而得錦標此又勝負之變化不測也</p>
<p>兩隊人才曁南之勝一言蔽之人才平均體力强大放球殺球均臻佳境極爲可造之材而交通則參差不齊好者過好弱者過弱中如陶蒓張蒓蓀侯毓芬吳澍皆家學淵源爲民三竸志之健將惜有一二軟弱過甚以致時有位置衝突之病聞交大共有女生十八人得此球隊已可觀矣</p>

<p>（二）復旦獲男錦標</p>
<p>復旦曁南繼女生但作男生組錦標决賽勝來甚易直落三全勝曁南而保持第三年江大排球錦標</p>

<h3 id="c164">肺结核之病原體 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>距今四十九年前時爲一八八二年三月二十四日有德國醫聖考克博士ORROBERTKOC工在德京柏林之生理學大會席上發表醫學上極有價值之一論文題爲肺结核之原因博士所報告之宗旨謂肺结核（即肺痨病）係一種特殊之傅染病並非遺傅症且歷舉種種之　例以證明之（如肺结核菌之培養染色及動物試驗等）自此上下三千載以來之肺痨研究史上闢一特殊之異彩而肺痨之病原體旣明於診斷肺痨病遂得一確切之標準矣</p>
<p>按肺结核菌爲顯微鏡的徽菌其形體極小極微設秤其一格蘭姆計之爲數當在三百五十萬萬個以上其繁殖力極爲可驚破壞入體组織成最可怖之结核病症此項病菌如排出於人體之外則完全不能繁殖差能僅保持其生存而已然一旦使有侵入人體之機會則　據嬌嫩之肺臟據爲大本營肆踨其可怕之勢力嗚呼人類之大敵誠莫過於肺痨病可不懼哉</p>
<h3 id="c165">肺结核菌之構造 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>歷來一般之醫家因未明瞭肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性構造以爲凡爲病菌盡可以消毒之　劑用内服或注射之方法撲減之一如六零六之注射於梅毒也自柏格爾博士DRBERGELL苦心研究後始發表肺結核有一種特殊之防禦力能抵抗一切外來藥力攻擊蓋肺结核菌體係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜構成若非設法破壞其蠟質之防缐及解除其脂肪性之武裝則無由俘擒结核菌而置之死地且结核菌侵入人體局部時其四週即被侵蝕而形成頑强之结節以阻碍血流之通過致使注射或内服之一股消毒藥劑無由越雷池一步宛如特别戒嚴之禁區藥力旣無從接觸患部則雖溺沉全身於藥池中亦不能傷结核菌之毫髮是故撲滅肺结核菌之唯一作戰方略至少必須具下列之兩種先决條件（一）凡藥能破壞结節而直逹患部者</p>
<p>（二）又能剝奪苛溶解其蠟質及脂肪性之内外膜者</p>
<p>如此始能奏破關斬將之功否則隔鞋搔癢彼结核菌且在此兩種保障之下竊笑人之莫余害也</p>
<p>肺结核菌發明家　德國聖醫考克博士</p>
<h3 id="c166">肺结核菌之脫蠟術成功 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>自考克博士發見结核菌爲肺结核症（即肺痨）之病原體以來東西结核學者爭先研究欲期得一殺　此菌之妙方但其结果盡歸失败蓋因彼等不知结核菌能发泌一種蠟質包圍其本體以禦外力侵入之深奥學理故也曾有哈莫塞哈黎氏等發見應用百分之五至下之苛性加里液而得除去结核菌之抗酸性蠟質後有莫純氏應用鹽素瓦斯而亦得除去抗酸性蠟質然此種脫蠟法祗能適用於顯微鏡檢查上染色法而已蓋其藥性劇毒對於入體終不能實用也</p>
<p>近數年來偶有將大楓子油應用於麻瘋症而獲意外之奏效者蓋麻瘋菌與肺结核菌爲同性質之抗酸菌而大楓子油能有脫蠟之作用兼具石炭酸百倍以上之殺菌力於是一般學者遂引起熱狂的注意試以大楓子油應用於結核症患者冀圖凑效而種種之化學的方法提出大楓子油之主要成分試用於結核症患者亦期得相當之效果然袛限於皮膚及表在性結核症能奏良效而對於深部的贜器如肺贜肝贜腎贜等結核則仍不能奏何等之效果</p>
<p>因此我善天下結核病者之大恩師柏格爾博士百尺竿頭再進一步搜集動植礦物性之各種藥物而苦心研究期得一種有脫蠟作用而藥性和平無毒者孜孜數十年不知絞盡幾許腦汁瀝盡幾許心血以求最合理最有效之化學劑不已終發見特殊動物之腸間膜缐壓缐壓縮汁中某一種有效成分對於結核菌有强力脫蠟之作用乃即將此新成分作用於结核菌則其结果完全脫蠟自此昔日東西各醫家所視爲人工不能除去结核菌抗酸性之主張完全推翻誠前後千古醫學界一大疑問的肺结核治療之新曙光也</p>

<p>蓋肺结核（即肺痨）之原因是结核菌而此菌一入人體内則於該處便成结節以斷血行之路又结核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質包圍其體以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入故雖用種種殺菌藥内服或注射終不能逹其病菌之實體内　來醫家所慣用之自然療法對症療法理學的療法血清療法藥劑療法及其他一切治療法等尚未完全成功而肺療無藥之說循满於一世者因未知此深墺學理故耳由此現代结核學者根據上述學理繼續研究不遺餘力结果竟成此殺盡肺痨菌之化學劑名曰三那星SANOSIN此藥係遵肺療菌發明者德國考克博士與肺痨菌脫蠟術發明家德國本格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告此藥有滲透肺病　之结節及溶解蠟質之作用兼具有殺菌力能根治一二三期之肺痨確有萬試萬　之特效在中國業經國民政府中央衛生試驗所化驗藥性和平無毒絶無任何副作用茲略舉醫治作用於下</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中實驗三那星之藥力作用則一分鐘後結核菌皆消失其抗酸性至三分鐘後則此肺結核菌完全殺盡無一倖免</p>
<p>（二）依動物試驗則發見三那星能滲人结核病　内設檢查其病　内潛伏之结核菌則　失其抗酸性此足證明其蠟質之完全解矣</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服三那星一星期左右則立見略痰稀釋體熱下降等等良好狀態（四）更繼續内服三那星逹三十天至六十天以上則顯見體重增加食慾激進一切症狀逐漸緩和終逹其回天　之偉功</p>

<p>— 一得</p>
<p>最近在某刋物讀胡愈之所作菲斯科印象記（九）民族文化與國際文化語多中肯茲特轉錄並加補充如下</p>
<p>莫斯科印象記（九）　愈之</p>
<p>民族文化與國際文化</p>
<p>與U同志閒談文學藝術頗得了一些新的見解</p>
<p>這是一個大的ParDox布爾希维克在政治的立塲上是徹頭徹尾的國際主義者而在文化藝術的立塲上却又是徹頭徹尾的民族主義者</p>
<p>我相信世界上没有一個政府對於民族文化民族語文民族文藝能像蘇維埃政府那樣地提倡保護（當然我這裏所說的民族文化民族語文民族文藝並不是專指俄羅斯文化語文文藝蘇維埃聯邦的内部包含着數十個不同的民族而俾羅斯民族不過其中之一把蘇聯的民族主義和俄羅斯民族主義視爲一物這是最普通易犯的而又是最重要的錯誤之一）革命以前在柴的領土内一般人只知道有一個俄羅斯帝國和俄羅斯民族到了十月革命以後除這俄羅斯民族以外纔發現了烏克蘭白俄羅斯哥薩克喬台亞韃　亞爾美尼TadjiksKhiegizes　UzdeksTuscimans　Tadshiks　Klimea　Balhkiriens　Jakutions　Komis　Kauakopaken以及此外許多數也數不完讀也讀不清的古怪民族不但發現了這一大羣的民族而且更發現了這些民族所獨特的文化語言與文學在蘇聯境内各種語文都和俄羅斯語文有同樣的法律的的效力在我所經過的許多車站上面所標的站名都有四五種或七八種文字並列着國家發行的郵票郵政明信片纸幣印上各種古怪文字的都有國家印刷局用七八十種文字印刷敎科書雜誌報章和文藝作品其中有幾種文字在俄皇時代是從不曾印在纸上過的</p>
<p>在文學藝術方面也是如此十九世紀後半到二十世紀初期的俄羅斯文學如都介湼夫柴霍甫等的作品在技巧與思想上受西歐文字的影響很大所以是世界性的反之新興的普羅文學却是地方性的鄉士的民族的色彩非常濃厚在新興的音樂及跳舞藝術裏也充满着各種的民歌和民間跳舞的情調普羅文藝的最大的源泉是民間文藝所以牠不能不是民族性的</p>
<p>就舉U同志爲例罷他是城巿無産出身而且在早年便信仰布爾希维克主義投身到紅軍裏他所寫的小說幾乎全部是用赤白戰爭來當題材的可是他却全用韃靼文來寫而不用俄文寫雖然他也一樣能寫俄文而且俄文的作品比韃靼文的能得到更多的讀者但他却覺得只有用他的鄉士的語文才能忠實地現出情意據U同志說在蘇聯凡是在政治社會思想上站在革命前綫的人對於民族文化語文的保護最爲固執例如蘇聯政府近年曾主張把蘇聯内部所用的文字都改用拉丁字拚音但這個主張至今還不能實現就只因爲幾個重要政治領袖堅决反對的緣故反對的理由是恐怕改用拉丁字母後語文的形式將喪失其特殊的民族性</p>
<p>這似科在理論上是說不通的布爾希維克在一方面高唱無産者無祖國而在他方面又要盡力提倡保護民族文化關於這民族文化的問題數年前黨内的理論家間也曾引起過劇烈的論爭尤其是在冀的理論家反對提倡民族文化甚力但終於斯太林的主張得了勝利斯太林所持的理由以爲革命的最後目標固然是創立世界的文化以代替一切民族文化但世界文化産生至少要在世界革命成功了許多年之後在目前的過渡的階段内無産者的政權只限於蘇維埃聯邦的國境這樣創造世造世界文化顯然是不可能而且世界文化的創造必須在各民族得平等自由發展其民族個性民族文化以後從各個自由發展的民族文化目前世界的許多的小民族還在帝國主義壓迫之下無從獨特發展其民族文化所以第一步必須使民族文化解放發展第二步方能産生世界文化不然如在蘇聯境内抑制各弱小民族文化語言的生長發展徒然造成了俄羅斯民族文化語文的優越地位以俄羅斯文化統一其他民族文化這樣和帝國主義的同化政策又有什麽分别所以在目前這時期應該儘力扶植各弱小民族文化語文藝術的發展直到了政治的民族界限消滅以後民族文化在相當時期内還有培養扶植的必要因爲民族文化愈充分發展則將來世界文化的質量亦愈充實豐富所以在文化的見地上布爾希维克應是民族主義的自由主義的</p>
<p>我所想補充的是</p>
<p>我國的文學藝術自五四以後纷擾不休直到民國十九年六月一日才有對於我國文學與藝術此後應該如何進展底正確的表示這是在]在那天我們有了民族主義文藝運動宣言自該宣言發表以來到如今影響固然不能不算甚深但眞能了解民族文學民族藝術及民族主義文學與民族主義藝術的也不能不說很少隔了一年愈之君自歐歐洲漫游歸來這篇民族文化與國際文化可說是他及他的一羣對於我們所提倡的運動在理論上深表同情底一種表示於是足見我們正應該從事於民族主義文藝底努力及民族主義文藝底　久的偉大</p>
<p>在我國關於民族文藝底文獻不得不推出（一）傅彥長朱應鵬合作的藝術三家言傅彥長的十六年之雜碎葉秋原的藝術之民族性與國際性及民族主義文藝論集等傅彥長可說是我國提倡民族文學民族藝術底拓荒者</p>

<h3 id="c209">兩個詩人的最後 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 采</p>
<p>—拜倫和雪萊</p>
<p>拜倫對於反對土耳其時虐政而謀獨立的希臘抱非常熱烈的同情所以於八二三年七月他就坐了赫克羅斯號向東方進發去實際參加希臘的運隊而擬給以若干助力</p>
<p>同行的有加姆白伯爵和次萊老尼意大利的非蘭基醫師也是同道的同船載有大砲二尊馬五匹藥昌幾許很多的武器以及西班牙金幣五萬元這些都是去帮助獨立戰爭的</p>
<p>拜倫的心實是爲了愛希臘而燃燒着的他們於翌年的正月抵曼蘇龍其時住民都極力歡呼的迎接他們軍隊並放了禮砲馬白哥逹脫司總督也親出迎接　　　拜倫穿紅色軍服好似蓋世项雄的受一切的人們慶賀拜倫自參加軍隊後即已不是握筆的詩人而是執刀的將軍了</p>
<p>後來他被舉爲總督進攻蘭伯德時威風凛凛誰知道他是個應該文文雅雅的詩人呢而當時他的熱血一方面也因爲受着守護祖國的希臘軍的英武所烯燒所以愈見得宏壯偉大</p>
<p>當時並且殆完全消滅了他的多情多感易怒易嘆的以前的詩人的性格却表現了是個可敬的有克已能力的武將的神態</p>
<p>拜倫在過去是不惜以自已的金錢去接濟無論那個朋友而現在則他也不惜將所得供給希臘的軍隊因此希臘人更是崇拜他敬愛他了大家都明白他的確是在誠心誠意帮助希臘的獨立</p>
<p>在軍事將近结束的某日他和加姆白同道坐馬至海岸散步且不顧下雨而還去海上划船翌月他也曾於雨中至林間散步</p>
<p>结果他的雄圖没有成功而同時又被病魔所擾於是他就不能站立了</p>
<p>在他呻吟於熱病中時非蘭基以下所有的詩客都無分畫夜的看護默禱着熱血詩人恢復健康他在發熱時還常常呌着一前進呀前進呀啊後他還說</p>
<p>我雖把自已的時間健康所得都犧牲了現在身體又弄得如此希臘希臘你究竟將成功一個什麽呢</p>
<p>這是一八二四年四月十九日他臨終時的最後一句話他亨壽祇有三十七歲</p>
<p>拜倫死的消息傅出後希臘全土就像完全被悲嗼和哀情所包圍當時放了和他的年齡同數的三十七響弔砲</p>
<p>死復六年希臘出成功了獨立總算逹了他的遺志</p>
<p>後來希臘爲報答此援助獨立之功臣起見在英國哈美爾　公園建造了一個手携愛犬之英雄的天才詩人的像以作永久的紀念</p>
<p>一八二二年七月八日雪萊自訪了舊友哈敦歸來從司倍基灣坐了以前和拜倫一起造的同其安號船船上雪白的布帆照耀在海波之上實是比盡更要美麗</p>
<p>友人次蘭老尼則坐了另一只船看見同其安號載着雪萊輕快的飄浮在海波之上</p>
<p>這正是一個很熱而悶人的天氣所以不久海就在疾風中起了大浪浪聲高吼着風也非常緊急並且還起了族渦而載着雪萊的同其安號也就在這個風潮中不見了形跡</p>
<p>當然次蘭老尼在安全避難了的甲板上想到了他的走遠而不至去向了的朋友他也顧不到海浪衝到他的脚跟雷雨已濕了他的全身他祇有呌着</p>
<p>雪萊不知怎樣了呀雪萊呀</p>
<p>暴風雨雖不久就無聲無息的停止司倍基　也就恢復了本來平穏美麗的南方海的本色但是同其安號就不知往那裏去了</p>
<p>次蘭老尼把個消息告訴了數和拜倫拜倫當時簡直嚇得說不出話來袛是戰慄着蒼白的嘴唇</p>
<p>友人們雖將海岸的各處都找遍了但是终終於找不出同其安號的破片和雪萊的屍體直至七月十八日雪萊的屍體才於里格的海岸發見屍體的上衣中還裝着哀司克拉斯和基次的詩集基次的詩集還是開着</p>
<p>八月六日拜倫哈敦及次蘭老尼在哀傷悲嘆中把雪萊的遺骸燒了灰是葬在羅馬</p>
<p>和拜倫同是被稱爲一代的天才詩人之他的生涯比拜還少活七個年頭而祗有三十歲</p>

<p>— 霖</p>
<p>跌落水中</p>
<p>砲彈仍舊在各處爆炸我們自已發砲時的震動使得許多人震落水中一個朋友被我從水中拖起三次第四次又落入水中待我發覺已經淹没了我自已也跌落船外抓住了桅桿的繩索方才没有落水可是現在船身下沉我幾乎與水相遇</p>
<p>後來我的知覺失掉了直等到被彈聲震醒我倒睡在指揮塔之前雪尼艦下半天又來龔擊因爲我們没有答應她降從繼續向吾船開砲我看見茂婁艦長吩咐生存的人躱避在鐵甲塔之後他自已却站在前面屹立不動的高大身軀清清楚楚在水平缐上面正對了雪尼艦的砲口我眞不明白他决計要分擔伊大多數手下人的命運可是說來奇怪飛來的砲彈將左右的人擊死打傷他却立在那裏一些也碰不着命運不許伊同了他的手下人及船同死</p>
<p>火熖與浪</p>
<p>到了第二天海浪格外的澎湃船上的情形也愈加不好全船仍舊被火燒着巨大的海鷗不時向我們龔擊船裏已經没有淡水受傷的人慘苦難狀所以我决計跳下船去將傷人搬運到島上我奉准了艦長馮茂婁的允許尤其不能忘記他注視我希望我成功</p>
<p>在魏德福上校指導之下每件事都很小心的辦一根長繩縳在我腰裏要我帶上島去一隻手拿一柄巨刀以防海較我便向巨浪的頂上跳去一個漩渦他的中心在船首之下將我捲入愛姆登的龍骨之下當媁那速率稍退之時我看見水渦直經至少有十尺此外又見愛姆登被夾在兩個珊瑚礁之間那礁石從岸邊伸長出來好像手指一般這個當然是造成巨渦的缘故了</p>
<p>我並不寂寞在我的對面一樣像我没有帮助有一尾大的蛟捲在漩渦裏他白的魚腹正向着我於是片刻的有動靜海水慢慢地起來注满那渦底我聽見豁裂似的一聲巨響渦底中注满了奇異的綠光浪濤都向其中匯注倐忽間一股力量將水從渦中提起好像巨大的噴泉一般將我筆直抛上來愛姆登的龍骨在我眼前經過有如一條紅缐在這一瞬間我覺重已經抛失了我看見那大蛟向船首橫過去現在我又覺得有轉機了</p>
<p>當我回復知覺之第第称身在湍浪駭濤之間離去愛姆登已十分遠人與海灘離約兩百碼我向灘邊游泅過去可是很奇怪的每泅一程京有蕼巨浪打來我不被打在浪面而被打在水底轉在身上的繩索繞住在礁上我像浮標般的被繫着最後繩索斷了我被浪激動没有抵禦的力景我試了幾次不能成功便放棄了</p>
<p>我沉下水去兩次三次每次都很平安我看見蔚藍的天白沙灘岸上的棕　樹葉柔和地在徵風中搖動着我心中實然非異快活一瞬之間我又被聳至空中乘了碎波擲至灘邊我重復得到性命了</p>
<p>我有時候不敢呌這種意外的際遇爲幸運我就想很平穏的休息一下可是老天又與我開玩笑我的解釋是這樣的像一隻沉没在水裏的老鼠我攣痙着將腿伸出去我的右足碰在岩石上又被衝至水裏</p>
<p>奬鐵十字章</p>
<p>爲了上述的經過我受頭等鐵十字奬章後來我許多朋友告訴我那時候他們在甲板上揣想我的生命不值一錢後來我的同伴都集齊起來靠了空的軍火箱向灘邊進發受傷者的情狀十分可慘没有臂没有腿的人被波浪捲來橫臥在灘邊没有扶助的人嘴裏喊渴無從得水最後發狂似的喝了满口　水解渴就是我們能走的人也想不出方法來止住他喝鹽水所以船上的副醫官竟亦喝鹽水止渴送去性命</p>
<p>第二個就是搬運傷人的問題因爲我們寸縷不掛曬在烈日底下實在是很危險我們尚能動作的幾個人就把把那傷人搬送至樹陰和岩石底下歇息去了</p>
<p>隣近有一棵樹椰子樹结满了椰子我們費了半小時的光陰纔爮上了四十尺後來我終算逹到樹巔接着椰子擲了五十从隻到地上幸虧我爲了自已留了四只因爲我的同伴毫不思慮的把所擲下去的椰子都吃掉了我把留着的幾隻分給衰弱而不能到樹底下的幾個同伴一起吃</p>
<p>口渴發狂</p>
<p>我爲了口渴難忍變成發生幻象中顯出一杯啤酒清凉可口泡沬浮在杯子四週可是這隻不易捉摸的杯子常常避去我我就拚命追趕直到倒在地上失去知覺爲止頭腦裏也夢見許多同伴對着船上的水櫃咀駡</p>
<p>當我醒轉來的時侯我看見有小蟲爮在我的皮　上他們咬我非常的痛又有長剌從皮　裏拖出來野的大島停　在我們身旁用　尖利的鈎嘴將没　抵抗力傷人的肌肉撕去我旣懼且怒用力擊殺丁數十頭我們從此覺得必定要有兩個看守人將野寫　逐以免危害傷人</p>
<p>我在灌木叢裏來往走着預備尋點吃的東西忽然看見一隻將要生産的大海鳥週身雪白飛在空中翅膀伸出來足有六尺長在白沙離上留下一個很大的蛋我把蛋拿在手裏那集太島便呌個不停我驚異之餘便把那蛋重置原處我眼見大自然間一件異事一個小尖嘴破榖出來將蛋殻分爲兩半那沙灘上便多了一隻藍的大鳥孤苦的向他母親呌着我看了又年我是一個城裏孩子從來没有看見這種事那盤旋在我頭上的老鳥不多一刻便很從容的飛下夾來對着我伸出了那翅膀保護小鳥不使日光射着最後她蹲在巢顶正對着看我</p>

<h3 id="e4">American Senator Pittman Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Pessimism Regarding the Future of the Silver Price Conference</p>
<p>Nanjing – Pittman arrived in Nanjing this morning and will stay temporarily at the American Consulate. He plans to depart for Shanghai tonight. Although Pittman's visit is brief, he has already met with a certain important person once. According to information obtained from foreigners, Pittman is a Westerner from the silver mining region. Pittman is indeed extremely enthusiastic about maintaining silver prices. However, the American East Coast is indifferent to the silver price issue. Since Lin Bai-ke's return to his country makes it difficult for him to accomplish anything alone, Pittman's proposals will also be difficult to implement. As for the silver price conference, the Chinese authorities no longer advocate holding it in China, fearing that it would lack significant influence and be incomplete. Japan also opposes holding the conference in Kyoto, arguing that Japan does not produce silver and is not qualified to convene it. The original proposal to hold the conference in Washington was also opposed by merchants and gentry on the American East Coast. Therefore, the future of stabilizing the silver price conference is extremely pessimistic. Bei Songsun and others may return without achieving their goals. Two weeks ago, Lin Bai-ke still sent a letter to a certain important person in China, stating that American silver merchants were still very willing to lend silver to China, and that they would be willing to throw the silver into the ocean if the silver price could rise. However, the American government is unwilling to handle the matter directly because, according to American law, if a loan is handled by the government, the repayment responsibility belongs to the government. If it cannot be repaid on time, the government must repay it on behalf of the borrower. The American government is unwilling to assume this responsibility. The Chinese side also has good reasons for opposing it, arguing that if raw silver is dumped in China, the silver price will definitely fall, so they dare not accept it. The foreign advisor Sonier-ski went to the United States to lobby for this reason. Sonier-ski's mission has been completed and he will return to China soon. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Ministry of Justice Issues Order to Improve Prisons <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Adding Prison Rooms for Foreigners</p>
<p>Nanjing – The Ministry of Justice, based on Article 11 of the Regulations on the Implementation of the Administration of Foreigners in China, stipulates that the places for imprisonment, detention, and arrest of foreigners shall be determined by order of the Ministry of Justice. Currently, prisons in Liaoning, Shandong, and Hebei are designated to separately equip them, instructing the presidents and chief prosecutors of the respective High Courts to quickly establish public rooms with a height of 3 meters, a depth of 3.6 Chinese feet, and a width of 2.4 Chinese feet in the respective prisons. It is estimated that there will be 100 rooms in the Liaoning First Prison, 50 rooms in the Shandong Sixth Prison, 40 rooms in the Hebei First Prison, 50 rooms in the Eastern Provinces Special District Prison, and 25 rooms in the Yunnan First Prison. As for detention places, several rooms should be designated from the detention places for application. The existing infirmaries and bathrooms in the prisons should also be modified to be clean. The necessary funds will be allocated after the respective courts submit the drawings, methods, and estimates for verification. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Particularly Tragic Situation in Xiangtan</p>
<p>Changsha – Continuous heavy rains in Hunan Province have caused mountain floods. Xiangtan, Changde, Anxiang, and Xiangxiang counties have repeatedly reported flooding. The situation in Xiangtan is particularly tragic. In the southern four districts, including Changshan, Tongliangshan, and Xieling, mountains have collapsed, causing earthquakes. Water has gushed from the mountainsides, instantly turning farmland into desolate wastelands. Sand and rocks have accumulated for dozens of miles. The deaths and losses are incalculable, making it an unprecedented catastrophe. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

Zhang Ji will return to Nanjing to report on the mediation process. Northern generals deeply understand the righteousness and know that peaceful unification is China's only way out.

<p>Nanjing – Lu Diping cabled Sun Ke, refuting Qin Dian's telegram in many ways, and concluded by saying: "Now, the Red bandits are being suppressed, and the people's lives are on the verge of extinction. Only by advocating peace and maintaining unity can we save the people from drowning. You joined the party at a young age and inherited its principles. You cannot bear to see the recently ceased warfare reignite and the recently established national foundation collapse again. Regarding Jie Gong's advancement and retreat, you should only abide by the laws and regulations and not allow personal preferences to determine his stay or departure. Otherwise, pushing and pulling each other will lead to endless chaos. I still hope you will uphold your consistent desire to support the central government and implement your original intention of mediating the current situation. The survivors of Gan and Xiang express their gratitude. Diping has always been under the leadership of the central government in military and political affairs and aims to complete the National Revolution. I dare not hear of anything else."

<h3 id="e9">Prospects for Salt Administration Improvement <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Zhuang Songfu's Talk</p>
<p>Nanjing – Zhuang Songfu discussed two points that should be noted after the implementation of the new salt law: (1) Although the production of salt is abundant, excessive consumption may lead to insufficient supply, resulting in a shortage of salt. Therefore, it is planned to extract 20% of the annual consumption of 337.5 million kilograms to prepare for salt shortages. (2) The salt prices in various production areas vary greatly, with Huai salt costing over one yuan per dan, Zhejiang salt costing eight or nine jiao per dan, and Changlu salt costing four or five jiao per dan. The price difference is significant, and transportation costs further increase the price. The largest consumers of salt are rural people, and if the price cannot be averaged, it will significantly impact the livelihoods of the common people. Therefore, special attention must be paid to regulatory measures. As for audit authority, it can be fully recovered. It is estimated that all foreign debts guaranteed by salt revenue, amounting to over 80 million, can be cleared within one year after the reorganization of salt taxes. There are no actual restrictions in foreign treaties. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing – The National Government has promulgated the new salt law, and the implementing regulations are currently being carefully reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. The organizational law of the Salt Affairs Reform Committee has also been approved in principle by the central government and will be drafted by the Legislative Yuan. The effective date of the new salt law will be determined by the government through a separate order after the Salt Affairs Reform Committee is formally organized in accordance with the organizational law and has a concrete plan for the matters that need to be implemented and reformed.

<h3 id="e11">Re-export Tax on Domestic Goods <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Four Measures</p>
<p>Nanjing – After the implementation of the new export tariff, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated four measures for levying taxes on the re-export of domestic goods: (1) If domestic goods that have been taxed according to the old export tariff are re-exported via foreign countries within one year after June 1st, the difference will be paid by the merchant if the new tariff rate is higher. If the new tariff stipulates tax exemption, the tax already paid will be refunded. If the new tariff is lower, the difference will also be refunded. (2) For exported goods whose contracts were signed before June 1st, the new tariff should be paid when they are subsequently shipped overseas.

Next, Zhang Qun stood up and said that he was here to represent Chairman Jiang to congratulate the Deputy Commander on his birthday and to offer condolences for his illness.

The large attendance of representatives at this National Assembly is a major blow to the Guangdong faction. The Guangdong side is the shadow of the expanded meeting.

<h3 id="e25">Italy's Anti-Baton Rule and Anti-Church <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Not long ago, the Italian prime minister published an article declaring the success of his Fascist propaganda and encouraging his countrymen to work harder to expand it abroad. His ambition to promote his doctrine throughout Europe is already clearly visible. However, looking back at his own country, the conspiracies against the baton rule have been continuously discovered, and there are even those who, in order to oppose the baton rule, are willing to sacrifice themselves to assassinate the Italian prime minister. According to the World News Agency, the anti-baton rule organization in Italy is a large-scale organization formed by the combination of socialism and nationalism, and many have joined it. Recently, there has also been a reaction against the baton party's movement in Southern European countries, as evidenced by Spain. Therefore, what the Italian prime minister believes to be the success of Fascism is not yet a reality. In order to achieve the success of his doctrine, the Italian prime minister hurriedly began to purge the anti-baton party. It is not yet possible to predict whether this anti-church move has any connection or influence on the purge of the anti-baton rule party. However, we dare to believe that the forces against the baton rule are still not to be underestimated. With the participation of the intellectual class and labor elements, and the secret nature of their organization and actions, it is indeed impossible to eliminate them. Moreover, the power of the Roman Pope is even more not to be easily underestimated. Since the prevalence of his doctrines and the wide spread of his followers have deep roots, he will not easily accept oppression. The current Pope has sent a dispatch to the Italian government demanding an apology and compensation for the material losses suffered by the church's property. If the Italian government does not agree, the dispute will not be easily resolved. Therefore, the Italian government is eager to bring all the people of the country under the guidance of its baton party, but as a result, the baton party has suffered a major blow. Is this not a case of being too hasty to succeed?</p>

Leng and others asked Ji to question Jing Youyan on their behalf as to why the production and sales tax, which had been suspended, was still being fraudulently collected from merchants and civilians in the four villages. Ji said that he could pass this on to Jing and order him to prohibit it, but Jing had no right to decide whether to abolish this tax. Only Deputy Commander Zhang could decide after he recovered. He urged everyone to be patient temporarily and not to take other actions. The issue of the production and sales tax will inevitably be temporarily shelved, but the business community's intention is very firm and it must achieve the goal of abolishing the tax.

<h3 id="e71">Canada Raises Tariff Barriers <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The United States Reaps What It Sows</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Associated Press): Following the United States' implementation of protective tariffs, Canada's retaliatory tariffs also took effect today. Approximately 200 types of American goods imported into Canada will be subject to increased import duties, with some tariffs reaching as high as 40%. Other goods such as automobiles, coal, canned food, and most agricultural products are also subject to increased tariffs. Canada is one of the largest markets for American goods. When the United States raised tariffs, Canada warned of retaliation, but the Canadian Prime Minister repeatedly stated that Canada's tariff revisions were solely to encourage domestic industry and were completely unrelated to the United States' tariff increases.</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, 2nd (Associated Press): Senator Smoot, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told an Associated Press reporter today that even though Canada has issued new tariffs, he will not change his original intention of maintaining the current American tariff rates for the sake of protecting industries. It is difficult to change the current tariff rates and he believes that Canada's tariff revisions are purely to maintain workers' wages and there is no intention of retaliating against the United States.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Dentsu News Agency): The Soviet Russian government yesterday notified the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that in order to realize its five-year plan, it intends to order goods from Japan, including: 10 million yuan worth of ships, 5 million yuan worth of machinery for ships, 5 million yuan worth of rails, 5 million yuan worth of chemical products, 5 million yuan worth of electrical machinery and equipment, 1 million yuan worth of tin, and other goods totaling approximately 50 million yuan.

<p>Not Likely to Cause a Crisis for the Current Cabinet</p>
<p>Former Crown Prince Will Join the Next Presidential Election</p>
<p>Leipzig, 2nd (National News Agency): At today's Social Democratic Party annual meeting, there was continued debate on whether to continue cooperating with the current cabinet. Important speeches were made by both sides, but the number of peace faction members within the party currently accounts for nine-tenths of the attending representatives, so it is unlikely to cause any kind of crisis for the current cabinet. Furthermore, if Brüning can reduce current food prices to benefit the common people, his position will become even more stable.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (National News Agency): The London Daily Telegraph recently published shocking news stating that due to the extreme support of the Stahlhelm Party's recent annual meeting, the former Crown Prince will join the competition in next year's presidential election. A Berlin Daily Newspaper editorial stated that the Stahlhelm Party has 150,000 members, and its power cannot be said to be weak, but it is not enough to control the victory of the election. In order to win the election, the number of votes should be more than 20 million, so the former Crown Prince may not dare to join the competition rashly. Furthermore, although the Stahlhelm Party has 150,000 members, other parties, such as the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party, often have more people gathered from various places when convening national congresses. Therefore, the number of 150,000 is not enough to guarantee the victory of the presidential election.</p>

<p>Geneva, 2nd (Reuters): The League of Nations Committee on Communications and Transit continued its discussion of the Chinese government's request for League of Nations assistance in preventing floods in the Huai River Basin in Henan and Anhui provinces. It was decided today that there is no need to establish a special committee to handle the issues requested by the Chinese government, as other countries may also want the same assistance. Therefore, it was decided to establish a permanent committee with two groups: one group to handle general issues related to public works, and one group to handle technician training issues. Technician training is also one of the issues that the Chinese government wants the League of Nations to assist with. During the discussion, the Committee on Communications and Transit discussed the source of funds for water management in the Huai River Basin, hoping that the sale of reclaimed land and the increase in nearby land prices could offset part of the water management expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Sixth-Third Anti-Smoking Day Commemoration Held <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Liu Ruiheng Reports Reasons for Obstacles in Suppressing Opium</p>
<p>Anti-Smoking Exhibition Also Opens</p>
<p>The Central Opium Suppression Committee, regarding today (the 3rd) as the Sixth-Third Opium Suppression Commemoration Day, specially held a commemoration meeting this morning at the auditorium of the Ministry of Health. On this day, the national flag and the Kuomintang flag were hung at the entrance of the Ministry, and the four walls of the auditorium were covered with anti-smoking slogans. A horizontal banner read "Sixth-Third Opium Suppression Commemoration." In the center of the auditorium was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and his last will and testament. Above it hung the Kuomintang flag, and there was also a bronze sculpture of Lin Zexu. Guests attending the meeting included Li Geng, a representative of the Central Party Headquarters, Shui Zi, a representative of the National Government, Li Danian, a representative of the Executive Yuan, and representatives from various agencies and organizations, totaling about 400 people. The meeting began at 10:00 AM, presided over by Liu Ruiheng, the chairman of the committee. The chairman led the ceremony, read Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament, and anti-drug teachings. Then, the chairman delivered an opening speech, stating that today is the Sixth-Third Opium Suppression Commemoration Day. We should feel deeply pained by the past. The Qing Dynasty believed that opium was extremely harmful and was determined to suppress it. Therefore, Lin Zexu was sent to Guangdong and Guangxi to strictly prohibit opium. More than 20,000 chests of opium were seized and burned, leading to the Opium War, the ceding of territory, and indemnities. Later, opium prohibition was relaxed, and national affairs deteriorated day by day. Although the government issued prohibition orders from time to time, opium was still not eradicated. After the establishment of the National Government, it made the greatest determination regarding opium prohibition policies and established the Opium Suppression Committee to implement opium prohibition policies. However, the reason why opium still exists today is that there are too many obstacles. One is that years of suppression wars have led to a lack of unified government orders. The second is the existence of unequal treaties, which foreigners use to transport drugs to China. The third is that opium addicts in various concessions use the concessions to sell opium. Therefore, if we want to thoroughly implement the opium prohibition policy, we must seek domestic peace and unification, abolish unequal treaties, and take back the concessions. These are the major obstacles to the opium prohibition policy. However, even before these obstacles are fundamentally removed, we must continue to work hard to complete it. Next, Li Geng, a representative of the Central Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating that the Qing court also issued explicit orders to ban opium, and Lin Zexu was the first person to implement opium prohibition. The reason why it was not completely eliminated was that the Qing court from top to bottom failed to lead by example and take practical action. Therefore, the so-called opium prohibition was only a formality. Although opium prohibition has been promoted for more than ten years since the establishment of the Republic of China, some warlords have even rewarded opium cultivation and sheltered the transportation of opium to make profits. The National Government has made a real determination to ban opium, so it has not been completely eliminated for a while. Therefore, there are indeed obstacles that have not been removed, as the chairman said. We hope that the government and the Party Headquarters will work together to implement the opium prohibition plan. Next, Shui Zi, a representative of the National Government, delivered a speech, stating that from the former Qing Dynasty to the present, there has been a consistent advocacy of opium prohibition policies, but the results have been very few. The reason is that there are too many obstacles. Today, we should work hard to remove obstacles to achieve thorough opium prohibition. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>In addition, the Opium Suppression Committee specially held an anti-smoking exhibition at the Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Hall on Banbian Street. It opened today (the 3rd) at 9:00 AM and will last for two weeks. The exhibits are specimens, models, and pictures related to opium suppression, totaling about several hundred kinds, which are shocking to see. In addition, the Jiangning Local Court has a large number of opium and opium paraphernalia seized in opium cases handled on weekdays. It was specially decided to burn them in the square in front of the court today (the 3rd) at 9:00 AM, totaling more than 7,000 taels of opium and more than 8,000 pieces of opium paraphernalia. The Opium Suppression Committee specially sent a member, Li Jihong, to supervise. In addition, the Opium Suppression Committee organized an opium cessation hospital branch next to the Jiangning Local Court, which also opened today (the 3rd) at 2:00 PM. There are more than 60 wards inside, and there are six doctors. The acting dean and director is Yang Jishi. It is planned to implement opium cessation in batches for the opium offenders seized by the Local Court.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Sino-Russian Conference Still Faces Many Difficulties <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Russia's Passive Resistance to Railway Redemption Issue</p>
<p>Eighth Meeting May Be Postponed</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: According to the Moscow telegram obtained here, the eighth Sino-Russian conference is scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM on June 1st to discuss the issue of redeeming the Eastern Railway. It is rumored that the Russian side has proposed a redemption price of 160 million yuan. According to a telegram from Moscow, this has not been mentioned, and confirmation is still needed. However, Tu Wei, a special commissioner appointed by Mo Dehui to report to the central government, and Wang Zengsi have been transferred by the Eastern Railway Supervising Office to Moscow, urging them to quickly bring the railway redemption materials to Russia. Tu and Wang then sent a telegram saying that they are now in Beijing waiting for external documents and will go to Russia with Special Commissioner Zhang Shou Zeng on June 5th. It is heard that due to the news of the Sino-Russian conference negotiating the redemption of the railway, the old rubles accumulated for many years have been traded again, and some people are buying them in the hope that they will be used to redeem the Eastern Railway if the negotiations are successful in the future. It is also heard that a certain important person recently received a letter from a friend in Moscow detailing the situation of the Sino-Russian conference in progress. In general, after the fourth formal meeting between China and the Soviet Union, the redemption of the railway became the focus of the issue. At the fifth meeting, Karakhan made five demands, and our representative replied that there were three or several items that our side could not answer for a while. The plenipotentiary of the Soviet Union agreed to reply at the sixth meeting. After the meeting, Moscow immediately sent a telegram to the central government requesting instructions. The central government replied with a general outline and instructed the two special commissioners, Wang and Tu, to bring detailed programs when they returned to Russia. Therefore, when the sixth meeting was held on May 14th, Karakhan first asked how our side would reply to his suggestion. Moscow gave a brief reply based on the instructions of the central government and expressed deep dissatisfaction with the lack of concrete measures. Therefore, the issue of establishing a special committee to carry out valuation procedures was put on hold at the meeting on that day. When the seventh meeting was held on the 21st, Karakhan sent someone to inform him the night before that he could not attend due to illness and requested a postponement. Thus, it was postponed to the 24th for the meeting. The Russian side now has two mentalities for the meeting. One is to passively resist the railway redemption issue proposed by us by proposing a counter-proposal, so that we know the difficulty and retreat from the original proposal. Finally, we will be forced to discuss the issues of resuming transportation and commerce first. The other is to indefinitely establish a special committee to carry out valuation procedures, so that the meeting is prolonged and falls into a state of invisible stagnation. Therefore, although future meetings will still be convened on time on the surface, there will be no actual progress. The Russian side now has a wait-and-see attitude. There is a risk that the next meeting may be cancelled. According to this observation, the future of the meeting is not optimistic. Recently, the Russian government recalled consuls stationed in various parts of Northeast China and important officials of the Eastern Railway and will hold a Sino-Russian economic discussion in mid-June. Its main purpose is to develop its five-year economic plan and sell goods to China. It is implicit that the Russian side hopes to resume commerce and relations with China first. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Dispute between Beining and Kailuan Resolved <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Kailuan Agrees to Pay 1.25 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Coal and Mining Contract to Be Revised by the End of the Month</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The dispute between the Beining Railway Bureau and the Kailuan Mining Bureau over overdue train fees and other issues has affected the coal market, causing the Chinese people to take the opportunity to call for the recovery of the Kailuan mining rights. The dispute between the railway and the mine was resolved on May 30th. The Ministry of Industry and the Hebei Industrial Department are also studying the steps to recover the mining rights. However, the dispute between the railway and the mine has lasted for more than two months. The cause and resolution of the dispute are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Beining Railway discovered that the price of coal sold by Kailuan Coal Mine to the Jinpu Railway was lower than the price sold to the Beining Railway, and requested Kailuan to refund the overpaid coal price to the Beining Railway. Kailuan claimed that the Jinpu Railway was a special case and could not be used as an example. The Railway Bureau therefore demanded that Kailuan return the overdue train fees over the years and reduced the number of coal transport vehicles to show its resistance. The British general manager of Kailuan, Yang Jiali, did not want to submit to the demands of the Beining Railway and went around trying to use special forces to dispel the demands of the Beining Railway. However, the result was not achieved. At the same time, it aroused the attention of the Chinese people and there was a call for the recovery of the Kailuan mining rights. Kailuan's internal coal production could not be exported, so it wanted to stop work for two days a week, which again caused the Kailuan Miners' Union to strike. The market price of its stock also fell day by day. Therefore, Yang Jiali went to Beijing twice to visit Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and Wang's younger brother, Zhengfu, to ask them to mediate. At that time, Gao Jiyi, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, was in Beijing with Deputy Director Zhang, and the two Wangs mediated once. Gao agreed as requested. Kailuan sent its director of general affairs, the Englishman Puaier, and Secretary-General Luo Xuchao as representatives to meet with Chen Yanjun, the chief auditor of the Beining Railway, and Chang, the director of the accounting office, at the Railway Bureau to discuss the solution. Initially, the Railway Bureau still proposed the original plan and asked Kailuan to return the overdue train fees of 1.2 million yuan and the coal price difference of 800,000 yuan since 1926. The amount that Kailuan agreed to pay was less than half of what Beining required. The reason Kailuan gave was that the overdue train fees were accumulated during the five or six years. During that time, the Railway Bureau deliberately sent the vehicles to the mining area to stop in order to avoid the army seizing the vehicles due to the war. The responsibility for this kind of overdue train cannot be borne by the mine. However, according to the old accounts of the Railway Bureau, there are only records of how many vehicles were stored in the mining area on a certain day of a certain month, and the reason cannot be proven. Therefore, the Railway Bureau agreed to reduce the overdue train fees during the war years as requested by Kailuan to show fairness. However, regarding the number, Kailuan initially agreed to pay 500,000 yuan and finally increased it to 750,000 yuan. The Railway Bureau requested 800,000 yuan for the coal price difference, which was calculated from the time the contract was revised in 1926 to the present. The difference was 0.3 yuan per ton of fine coal and 0.25 yuan per ton of lump coal. The accumulation to date should be this amount. Kailuan said that this matter has been through several directors and that the facts related to the two railway bureaus cannot be paid according to the amount proposed by Beining. It initially agreed to pay 400,000 yuan and finally increased it to 500,000 yuan. The two items totaled 1.25 million yuan, which will be allocated to the Railway Bureau on the day the contract is signed. The Railway Bureau will also provide Kailuan with as many coal transport vehicles as possible after receiving the money. The representatives of the two parties met for the last time on the 30th, and the contract has also been drafted. It is scheduled to be signed by the highest authorities of both parties on the 3rd and 4th of this month. As for the coal transport and coal use contracts signed with Beining, they are all limited to the end of June this year. At that time, they must be renegotiated. It is heard that the previously signed contract was very preferential to Kailuan. When the new contract is revised in the future, it will be treated according to the precedents of Chinese coal merchants and will no longer be given special treatment to maintain the sales market of Chinese-owned coal mines.

<h3 id="e86">Measures to Regulate Farmers' Economy in Northeast China <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Oversupply and Stagnant Sales of Soybeans</p>
<p>Order to Change to Other Grains</p>
<p>Jilin Dispatch: Among the special products of the Northeast, soybeans are the most important. All parties at home and abroad recognize it as the most abundant area for soybean production. However, due to the lack of knowledge of farmers and merchants and the failure to pay attention to quality, the quality has gradually declined, resulting in the elimination of the European market and the formation of an oversupply and stagnant sales situation. The official silver bank of the three northeastern provinces takes the balance of supply and demand as the principle of economy. Therefore, the quantity of production must be adjusted according to the degree of need. Otherwise, there will be a shortage or surplus. Our country's agricultural products are the best in the world, but because the balance between surplus and deficiency cannot be averaged, both rice and noodles feel lacking, and foreign imports are alarming every year. On the contrary, soybeans feel that production is surplus, resulting in delayed sales. In recent years, the price of soybeans in foreign markets has suddenly fallen, which is due to the economic depression of the world, but in fact, the excess of supply over demand has caused it. How can the farmers in the remote countryside see this? If they are allowed to continue to plant, not only will production increase day by day and sales become more stagnant, but I am afraid that the land, capital, and labor will be lost. In addition to soybeans, there are many things that can be planted in the three provinces. For example, it is suitable to grow wheat north of Changchun, and it is suitable to grow miscellaneous grains and other oil grains south of Changchun. Cotton can also be tried. In addition, there are many places where paddy fields can be opened up to grow rice. As long as we observe the suitability of the soil and the accuracy of the climate, success can be expected. If it is suitable for wheat, grow wheat. If there is more wheat, there will be no shortage of flour, and foreign flour can be prevented from being imported. If it is suitable for rice, grow rice. If there is more rice, there will be more rice, and foreign rice will not come from other sources. Other miscellaneous grains, cotton, and other things have corresponding uses and corresponding values. It is not difficult to profit by making up for the deficiency. If supply and demand can be balanced, all agricultural products will not be oversupplied and stagnated, and the farmers' economy will naturally develop. Now, the silver bank has submitted this regulatory measure to the Northeast Political Committee to order the governments of the three provinces to instruct the counties to advise farmers to plant less soybeans and change to other equivalent agricultural products in the future. On the one hand, the county government or local organizations, such as agricultural associations, will convene local gentry or people who are proficient in agricultural science and experienced farmers to jointly study and improve according to local conditions to make adjustments and increase production. The Political Committee believes that the above-mentioned sections are for the purpose of remedying agriculture. Last fall, due to the stagnant sales of soybeans, farmers and merchants suffered hardships. If they are still ignorant of the principle of supply and demand and do not think about adapting to local conditions to improve production, the future of agriculture will inevitably lead to the destruction of vitality, and the national economy and people's livelihood will suffer. It has immediately ordered the three provinces to transfer the order to the agricultural and mineral bureaus to order the counties to supervise the agricultural associations to study the planting of equivalent grains to increase income. The various bureaus in this province have followed the order and instructed their subordinate departments to comply. (28th)</p>

<p>Bao De talks about how this trip is worthwhile</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The railway observation group sent by the Ministry of Railways to Japan arrived in Shenyang from Dalian on the 28th. The group has a total of 18 people and is jointly organized by the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Longhai, Jiaoji, Beining, Jinpu six lines and the Ministry of Railways. The list is as follows: Head of the group: Cheng Zhigang, Director of Documents: Sun Xuexiu, Director of General Affairs: Zhu Bi, Members: Zhong Dan and his wife Liu Huaiwei, Sun Jialu, Xiong Zhengwan, Zeng Guanghe, Chen Guangyuan, Gu Qiwen, Qi Lianyao, Gu Tingyue, Che Shaoling, Luan BaoDe, Lu Tingsi, Xu Zhongwei, Su Baoshan, Sun Wenzao. They stayed in the Ling Ge Kai Ning and Liao Ning three hotels. They have been very busy visiting the machine factories of Beining, Shenhai, and South Manchuria for several days. Yesterday, the reporter met with Luan BaoDe, a member of the group, at the Ling Ge Hotel. According to him, the group stayed in Japan for more than forty days before coming to Shenyang. All major railway machine factories in Japan have been visited. The internal management equipment of the factory is planned by the Ministry of Railways, and the content of each factory is unified. Moreover, most of them have been scientific, so the efficiency is high and the cost is low. The main point of our group's visit this time is the railway machinery factory. The result is quite satisfactory and not in vain. In the future, we will adopt its strengths to reform the machine factories of each road in our country. Due to the limited time, it is decided to leave Shenyang on the 31st and follow the Beining Road to Shanhaiguan, then to Tangshan, Tianjin, and Beiping, and then transfer to Jinpu Road to Jinan, change to Jiaoji Road to Qingdao, and then return to Pukou to return to Beijing to report.

<h3 id="e88">Henan Seventeenth Division Launches Suppression of Zhang Guancheng's Fierce Bandits <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: Notorious bandits Zhang Guancheng, Li Shuangcheng, Zhang Ke, Zhang Lue, Feng Gongwa, Zhang Xiaoping, etc. have about three to four hundred bandits, who are exceptionally fierce. They use villages such as Ao Tou, Xi He, Shang Yao Wan, and Shang Zhuang in the southeast of Ziyou County as their nests, and harass and plunder everywhere. The bandits broke through and looted Yiyang County last year, taking away more than 300 women. Other villages bordering the three counties of Ziyou, Yiyang, and Linru, such as Jin Zhuang, Nei Bu, Du Zhuang, and Lou, have suffered as much as Yiyang County. Shi Keqin's brigade of the Seventy-fifth Division began to suppress the bandit's nest from Linru Town on the 23rd of this month. Li Yaguang, the chief of staff of the division, specially went to Linru Town to discuss the suppression plan with Brigade Commander Shi in order to be cautious. The plan is that the bandit's nests of Ao Tou, Xi He, Shang Yao, and Shang Zhuang are horns to each other and help each other. It is difficult to attack. It is better to use the method of attacking the east and west to tire the bandits. After they are tired, use fierce artillery fire to attack the three villages of Xi He, Shang Yao, and Shang Zhuang at the same time. Then send a surprise force to attack their rear, so that the bandits cannot take care of each other. After the plan was determined, the three villages were successively broken through on the 26th. In this battle, more than 70 bandits were killed and more than 100 guns were captured. More than 50 male and female tickets were shot down. Seven officers and soldiers were killed and wounded. A small number of the remaining bandits escaped into the mountains with their families. The brigade has sent teams to intercept them. The remaining bandits trapped in Ao Tou have become turtles in a jar. Today, Brigade Commander Shi has used fierce artillery fire to bombard the village and has also erected many ladders in preparation for climbing the bandit's nest. The breakthrough of the bandit's nest should be in the next day or two.</p>

<p>Relaxing of City Streets Submitted to the Ministry for Approval: The streets in the city are narrow. Since the opening of the road, pedestrians have felt the hardship of having to give way. Zhong Tai, the chief of the first district, once proposed to widen the streets, and the district affairs meeting decided to submit it to the county government for approval so that a committee could be organized to actively carry it out. It is now learned that the county government has handed it over to the Construction Bureau for review, and the Construction Bureau has submitted another plan. After the 109th meeting of the county government, the plan proposed by the First District Office was temporarily shelved, and the plan of the Construction Bureau was submitted to the Ministry for approval. It is heard that this great project is related to the prosperity of the city and its commerce.

<p>Divorce Case of Hu Zhiqin Ended in Appeal and Settlement: Hu Zhiqin, a teacher at the French Concession of Shanghai, is 25 years old. When he was 16 years old, Hu worked as an accountant in a cloth shop and met Yang Shuzhen, a woman from Changzhou (21 years old this year) who lived next to the shop. They soon fell in love and rented a house at Nine Mu Di inside Xiao Bei Men. Hu had many friends who often visited his house, and Hu suspected that his friend Wang Jingfei was having an affair with Yang Shuzhen. Until the spring of last year, Hu and Yang quarreled and broke up and signed a divorce contract. Afterwards, Hu suddenly asked Yang Shuzhen's family for compensation for losses. Yang Shuzhen then hired lawyer Li Yuan to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court to request the dissolution of the marriage contract. On December 30th, the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected. Yang Shuzhen appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (the 3rd), Judge Lu Wenlan of the Second Civil Division of the High Court held a trial and persuaded them to settle. Yang Shuzhen's mother and daughter did not want to compensate Hu Zhiqin because Yang Shuzhen had been raped by Hu Zhiqin for two years. Hu Zhiqin claimed that both parties agreed to get engaged and live together. They accused me of smoking opium and not doing my job, but I also worked as a contributor to the Robin Hood tabloid in Shanghai. I don't smoke opium now. As for their request for termination of the contract, the appellant must compensate for the losses of the previous engagement of 700 yuan, and he and Wang Jingfei had a physical relationship. Judge Lu persuaded them to settle again, and Yang's mother and daughter also wanted Hu to compensate for the damage to their reputation. As a result, Judge Lu persuaded Yang Shuzhen to pay Hu Zhiqin 170 yuan to settle. Judge Lu drafted the settlement contract and adjourned the court.</p>

<p>The Wuxi Gendarmerie is Preparing to Depart: The Wuxi Gendarmerie Fourth Regiment has been ordered to leave Suzhou and go to Wuxi to perform road protection duties since February 16th of this year, and it has been four months. They have paid great attention to the defense aspect. The acting regiment commander, Ying Huaizong, received a telegram from Gu Zhenglun, the commander of the Capital Garrison, the other day, ordering the entire regiment to prepare to depart and concentrate in Zhenjiang to wait for further orders. After receiving the order, the acting regimental commander has prepared everything and will depart to Zhenjiang as soon as the order arrives to concentrate in one place to await orders to depart. The defense duties left behind will be taken over by a team sent by the First Regiment stationed in Suzhou.</p>
<p>The Silkworm Cocoon Trade in the Four Townships is Opening in Order: The standard opening date for the silkworm cocoon trade in the four townships has been decided by the Silk Cocoon Industry Association to be the 4th of this month. However, due to the different climates in each township, the eastern route has already opened the other day. It is estimated that there are four families in Dongting Town, including Dongchang Yu, Pinghe, Yuchang, and Fuyuan, with a cocoon price of 50 yuan per tan. The western route, including Qianzhou and Yuqi, is scheduled to open today. At present, various silk factories have dispatched temporary staff to report to the Cocoon Industry Association yesterday morning. Those who have reported opening include Erfang, Xia Yuan, Zhang She, Henghe, and Baxi Bridge Guo Xiechang, etc., totaling forty-five families. The total before and after is 117 families, exceeding one-third of the cocoon trade in the county.</p>
<p>Tea Tax to Be Implemented: The original tea stand tax in the county, which is 7 cents per tea stand per month, subsidizes the police expenses and is collected by the Municipal Fund Production Committee. Qian Zhongliang, the chief of the first district, proposed to collect a copper coin per pot of tea from tea guests to be used as autonomous funding because the autonomous funding of various townships was not available. Teahouse merchants expressed their opposition after hearing this, saying that one industry cannot be taxed twice. It is now heard that the tea stand tax can be stopped, and the tea guest tax can be implemented. However, the opinions of the tea merchants are still not consistent. The Qingxiang Committee Re-investigates Household Registration: The Provincial Qingxiang General Bureau recently appointed Ni Weiqing, etc. to go to Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Taicang, Jiading, Wuxian, and Wuxi to investigate Qingxiang affairs. Commissioner Ni came to Wuxi the other day and went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Pan to investigate Qingxiang work. Then, County Magistrate Pan appointed Shen Zao, the chief of the second section, to accompany him to the Qingxiang First Sub-bureau (i.e., the first district) for inspection. After that, he set off to re-investigate the household registration. Commissioner Ni went to the second, fourth, tenth, and seventeenth districts for inspection in recent days. According to Commissioner Ni, this time, the investigation in various counties believes that the names of the local defense regiments are different and they are all nominal and not real. They should be reorganized and renamed in accordance with the law in order to maintain the locality. The registration of ships, household registration investigation, joint insurance measures, and firearm inspection must also be handled separately item by item.</p>

<p>The Yongyu Qianzhuang (Money Shop) Collapses: In the autumn of last year, Gu Guang from Shanghai, along with Yang Peifu and Qin Kanru and others from this town, organized a money shop inside the Guangtai Tin Foil Shop in the North Market of the city, naming it Yongyu. They appointed Qin Kanru as the general manager and Chen Luncai as the deputy. It opened in September but had not joined the Qianye Gonghui (Money Industry Association). It is said that the shop only had a capital of twenty to thirty thousand yuan, but the account books and used promissory notes reached seventeen thousand yuan. From the very beginning, the shop issued many of its own promissory notes, which were discounted everywhere to make up for the turnover. This was a dangerous move of virtual capital and actual profit. At the end of last month, the shop failed to redeem its own promissory notes for foreign currency because it was short two thousand five hundred yuan, leading to its collapse. Chen Luncai and others, seeing that they could not manage, left Changshu first. General Manager Qin Kanru, seeing the crowds of people holding notes for redemption, borrowed the excuse of going out to plan and also fled. Soon, Lawyer Chen prepared a notice to liquidate. According to those familiar with the financial world, the shop has a book loss of sixteen thousand yuan, with an actual loss of only fifteen thousand five hundred yuan. However, the shop has issued many promissory notes, and peers are concerned about the relationship between the shop's notes and themselves. To maintain their own credit, it is said that they will issue a redemption of the shop's notes, otherwise future note issuances will definitely be questioned. As for deposits and debts, they will be discounted in the future, but all large and small businesses here are affected.</p>

<p>The Wounded Soldiers' Factory is Temporarily Difficult to Relocate: After Zhuang Mingyuan, the director of the Eleventh Division's Wounded Soldiers' Factory, explained the misunderstanding to the local authorities, the factory started work first. Commander Luo Zhuoying telegraphed the county government and various groups from Nanchang, stating that the division's wounded soldiers' factory was temporarily borrowing the poverty-stricken workers' workplace to start operations in order to show consideration for the revolutionary soldiers. He hoped that the local groups would deeply understand this purpose and assist them. He further stated that the soldiers of the headquarters would strictly abide by discipline and guaranteed that nothing would happen. He also hoped that local people would uphold the principle of kinship and love the soldiers.</p>

<p>The Police Team Captures Bandits: Recently, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the Four Zou area, and there have been few successes in solving them, so bandits have become fearless. A few days ago, the Cuiyuan Oil Shop outside the East and West Gates was robbed by bandits, losing over one thousand yuan in cash and banknotes. Magistrate Gong was furious upon hearing this and immediately ordered Wu Shaokang, the head of the detective team, to solve the case within five days. Two days later, Luo Qixiang, the police chief, learned that the bandits were hiding in Wuxi and immediately ordered Officer Kong of the water police to lead a team of officers to capture them as the opportunity arose. After Kong arrived in Wuxi, he saw that the bandits had already purchased train tickets and boarded a train to Shanghai. He waited on either side of them. Near Kunshan Station, he gave a command and stepped forward to capture them, arresting Yang Xiude, Xiao Guo, Ji Ruchai, and Meng Yuqing. They were immediately escorted to the team headquarters. The bandit leader is still in Wuxi and is being arrested. It is estimated that they will be escorted to Kunshan this afternoon and dealt with according to law.</p>

According to various reports, Zhang Boling and Guo Bingzhi, the Chinese directors of the conference, together with Liu Zhanen and Shou Jingwei, who had previously attended the conference, sent a letter to the Ministry of Education in the middle of last month requesting that a member be sent to participate. Recently, they received a reply from the Ministry of Education stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously consulted on the method of dispatching representatives for this matter and had replied that they had requested the Minister to instruct the Minister in America to send a member nearby to attend. Later, they received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informing them that they had ordered the Minister to comply with the instructions and had presented a reply.

<p>Preparations are Complete</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai International Games will be held this Saturday and Sunday. A total of nine countries are participating, with more than 250 athletes, both men and women. All are elites from various countries in Shanghai, and it is a grand event of the moment. In recent days, the authorities have spared no effort in compiling and printing the order of events, arranging the venue, and so on.</p>
<p>Fu Shengji Reports on the Tournament: Athletes from nine countries in Europe, America, and Asia are gathered together. It is expected that a large number of spectators will be present at the time. Without clear reports, it is difficult for Fu Shengji to communicate to the entire venue. Therefore, he contacted the Municipal Government to borrow a new large-sized megaphone, which will be installed at the venue. The entire venue will be informed whenever a tournament begins and after each achievement is produced, so that everyone far and near can hear it.</p>
<p>Wireless Radio Broadcasts to Other Cities: In addition to using megaphones for on-site communication, Tianling Company will also install wireless radio at the venue so that the situation of the entire venue and the results of the tournament can be broadcast to other cities inside and outside the city. Therefore, even those who are thousands of miles away will feel as if they are at the scene.</p>
<p>Military Bands Perform at the Venue: There will be two days of performances before and after the tournament. The association has specially invited the British Navy and the American Army's McKinley to lead their military bands to the venue to perform for the entertainment of the guests. It has been agreed by both countries, and there will be melodious and inspiring music that will be appreciated by the audience.</p>
<p>Boy Scouts Maintain Order: The venue layout is quite meticulous. In addition to the original short fences, wire mesh has also been installed to prevent outsiders from mixing in. The Boy Scouts of Guanghua University and the American School will also be invited to the venue to maintain order and facilitate the competition.</p>

<p>The Jingwu Team Gave Up the Right to the Final in a Gesture of Modesty.</p>
<p>The Jingwu Athletic Association, composed of 24 elite troops and a hundred great generals, initiated the Jingwu Cup after more than a month of competition, with strengths and weaknesses already determined and high and low scores divided. Last night was the final scene, and as a result, Benliu lost to Leyu by a score of 32 to 18, and Leyu won the championship.</p>

<p>Benliu, the champion of the Jingzi Group, had previously lost to Leyu. However, because Leyu withdrew from all competitions, all matches were not counted, and Benliu was able to preserve its honor. Last night's performance was very impressive, and the inner guards were particularly strong. Although winning the championship was not without an element of luck, it was not possible without hard work.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Leyu's Efforts Fall Short <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Since the Jingwu Team announced its abandonment of the final, everyone thought that Leyu, the champion of the Huizi Group, would win the championship without a doubt. In the past, its achievements were better than Benliu, and the talent was also evenly matched. However, in last night's battle, it was difficult to see fluency in attack and defense. In the first half, it was able to deal with the situation, losing by only 13 to 14. In the second half, it was greatly disappointed and suffered an irreversible defeat. It can truly be said that its efforts fell short.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Jingwu's Modesty is Admirable <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Jingwu Team is also one of the three groups (Wuzi Group) and the champion of the group. The ball skills and talent are said to be the best of the time, and the call for winning the championship is the highest. However, as the host, it did not want to occupy the top spot, so it announced its abandonment of the final to show great fairness and impartiality. This kind of modesty is rare in the sports world. The team roster is as follows: Captain Guo Zhihong, Secretary Chen Chihua, and members Hu Keli, Chen Jiasheng, Jian Shiyong, Yan Tinghui, Mai Zihuai, Ren Zhongling, Shen Bingcong, and Chen Runsheng.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Jiangnan University Men's and Women's Volleyball Tournament: Fudan and Jinan are Champions <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Fudan defeated Jinan 3-0 to win the men's championship.</p>
<p>Jinan defeated Jiaotong 3-2 to win the women's championship.</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Volleyball Championship was held in two groups, A and B. As a result, Fudan and Jinan won the top spots in the two groups, and the women's championship was won by Jinan and Jiaotong. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the four teams competed in the men's and women's championship finals at the China Athletic Field. The women's group competed first, with Jinan defeating Jiaotong 3-2 to win the championship. In the men's group, Fudan defeated Jinan 3-0 to maintain its third consecutive year of victory.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Jinan Wins the Women's Championship <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Jinan women's team and the Jiaotong women's team first competed in the women's championship final. After fierce competition between the two teams, Jinan reversed the defeat and won 3-2 against Jiaotong to win the championship.</p>
<p>All Thanks to Luck: The strength of the Jinan and Jiaotong teams is similar, with little difference between the top and bottom. Therefore, yesterday's victory or defeat was determined by luck. The closeness of the scores is evident. Jinan won the first game, and Jiaotong won two games in a row, taking a 2-1 lead. Jinan then won another game to tie the score at 2-2. The intensity and tension of the final five minutes of the fifth game were indescribable. After 18-18, the score became 20-20 again. When Jiaotong added a point to make the score 21-20, the Jiaotong team thought they had won and cheered loudly, but the referee announced a dead ball and ordered a re-serve. With luck on their side, Jinan scored consecutive points and won the championship.</p>
<p>Unpredictable Situation: A brief description of the five games: Jiaotong attacked first, with Wu Shiying serving and scoring two consecutive points. In the first instance, Jinan's Huang Rushuang returned the ball too heavily and it flew out of bounds, and Jiaotong gained a point. Later, Jinan's Deng Zhijun also scored two points. After the score was 2-2, the two sides killed each other, and Zhang Junsun scored six consecutive points with accuracy and strength, giving Jiaotong an 11-6 lead in the first half. Unfortunately, they made a lot of mistakes after that, and the first game ended in defeat with a score of 17-21. Such is the unpredictability of victory and defeat. In the second game, Jiaotong played carefully and prudently, and saw a turnaround. In the first half, they won a great victory by a score of 11-4. Jinan also stepped up their efforts and caught up, tying the score several times. Jiaotong finally won 21-19, each winning one game. Continuing to play carefully, Jiaotong won the third game and took a 2-1 lead. With their confidence relaxed, they thought they could relax a little, so mistakes gradually appeared, and they lost two games in a row. Jinan then rose sharply and won the championship. This is another unpredictable change in victory and defeat.</p>
<p>Talent of the Two Teams: In one sentence, Jinan's victory was due to the average talent, strong physical strength, and the fact that both passing and spiking reached a good level, making them extremely promising material. Jiaotong, on the other hand, was uneven, with the good being too good and the weak being too weak. People like Tao Chun, Zhang Junsun, Hou Yufen, and Wu Shu were all veterans of the Sanjingzhi. Unfortunately, there were one or two who were too weak, which often led to positional conflicts. It is said that Jiaotong has a total of 18 female students, and this team is already a sight to behold.</p>

<p>(2) Fudan Wins the Men's Championship</p>
<p>After the women's teams, Fudan and Jinan also competed in the men's championship final. It was easy for Fudan to win, and they won all three games to maintain their third consecutive year of the Jiangnan University Volleyball Championship.</p>
<p>Straight Wins for Fudan, Expanded Venue, Higher Net Position: Fudan's Guan Xun'an served first, and Jinan killed the ball to get the first point. Then, after a back-and-forth battle to 5-5, Fudan took the lead and won the first half 11-6. The difference gradually widened, and Fudan won the first game with a score of 21-17. In the second game, Jinan served first and scored two consecutive points. After a 6-6 tie, Fudan caught up again and won the first half 11-7, and won the second game with a score of 21-18. The score in the third game was even worse, with the farthest difference being 20-11. Lai Suiyi casually extended it to a final score of 21-14.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ball Skills, Jinan is Relatively Weak: Fudan Volleyball is Famous in Jiangnan: The entire team cooperates, trusts, saves, and splits kills, all of which are admirable. General Fei Cao Tingzan withdrew from the third game due to a sore hand, filling the front row wing. Fudan still maintained an absolute advantage. Xie Baochang's split kill became a major problem that Jinan could not cure. Jinan's defeat was due to poor cooperation, inability to save heavy balls, and inability to deliver powerful kills.</p>

<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>Mr. Feng, whose given name was , was a native of Cixi, Zhejiang. He lost his father in his youth and was known for his filial piety towards his mother. His mother, née Yu, was from a prominent family in the town and educated her son with utmost strictness. She burned the midnight oil, personally tutoring him for several years, and as a result, he achieved great academic success. In a certain year during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing dynasty, he was recommended as a tribute student and became very close friends with Ying Qizhi, who was from the same town. Ying was also a man of extraordinary talent and was considered his equal at the time. At that time, the Qing government was corrupt and the country was in decline. Mr. Feng was deeply worried about this, so he and like-minded people in the town established Cihu Middle School, Zhengshi Elementary School, and Dongcheng Girls' School, pioneering the educational atmosphere in Zhejiang. At that time, Zhejiang students studying in Japan published the "Zhejiang Tide" to awaken the demoralized people. Mr. Feng wrote several poems and sent them to the magazine, expressing profound and subtle sentiments. Liang Qichao of Xinhui saw them and exclaimed in amazement, "This young man is not to be taken lightly!" He immediately published them in the "Xinmin congbao" which he edited. Later, when Chen Tianying founded the "Tiantuo bao" in Shanghai, he hired Mr. Feng to manage the fiction section. His essays, along with those of Hong Foshi and Dai Jitao in the newspaper, were known as the "Three Talents of Tiantuo." A few years ago, Mr. Qin Runqing founded the Xiuneng Study Society in Shanghai and hired Mr. Feng as the director of the Arts Department. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to planning and achieved remarkable results. Mr. Feng had a simple and unadorned disposition and did not enjoy seeking official positions. He associated with many virtuous gentlemen in Shanghai, often discussing poetry and literature, and his home was always full of guests. He also loved to encourage younger generations. If anyone was even slightly talented, he would always praise them endlessly. He was especially concerned about the sons of his old friends, doing his best to promote and support them. His friend Kuang Huifeng of Lingui was a lyricist who was not good at officialdom, and lived a simple life, leaving nothing behind after his death. Mr. Feng not only cared for his son but also instructed his second son to marry Kuang’s daughter. A friend from the same town, Wei Gaixiang, had a son who was quite intelligent. After Wei died, Mr. Feng immediately married his daughter to Wei's son. Mr. Feng's way of handling his children's marriages is worthy of emulation. I have a cousin, Shufei, who is Mr. Feng's nephew. My late uncle passed away early, and Mr. Feng treated Shufei as his own son. Their fraternal affection was especially sincere and deep. My family was originally poor, but now Shufei is able to support himself. It can be said that my late uncle has descendants thanks entirely to Mr. Feng's efforts. When I was young, I was still aware of the need to strive, and Mr. Feng loved me very much. He once wrote to my father, urging me to abandon commerce and pursue education. My family had a traditional business, and my father did not agree. After I had been a merchant for only half a month, I received a letter from Mr. Feng and returned home. Alas, my father passed away last winter, and now Mr. Feng has also passed away. As I write this, I cannot continue. Alas! (Reverberating Sigh)</p>
<h3 id="e119">A Record of Appreciating Flowers in the Rain at Little Guanyuan Garden <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Ting Bing Sheng</p>
<p>Jiangwan is very close to Shanghai. Mr. Yang Shouren, the director of Little Guanyuan Garden, wanted to appreciate peonies, so we drove there together. Those who went with me were Shen Guoliang, the chairman of the Dongjiadu Fire Prevention Association, as well as Zhu Pinggu, Section Chief Huang Guangdou of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and literary friends Shen Yongqing and Zhang Ruogu. That day, the sky was cloudy and there was a hint of rain. Everyone brought raincoats and hunting hats, and our joyful mood was not diminished at all. When we arrived at the garden gate, Director Yang was already there to greet us on the side of the road. We got out of the car and greeted each other with joy, and then he led us to sit in the thatched hall. The four walls were painted silver-gray, and the light gleamed like shattered glass. In the middle, there was a platform on which were placed a dozen or so pots of roses and peonies. The vermillion faces and verdant vines, the drunken pink and charming reds, reflected and enhanced each other, making them extremely beautiful. We sat in order and sipped tea in front of the flowers. It seemed as if a faint fragrance flew over the water and filled our noses, allowing us to forget the world. Suddenly, the rain started, falling in continuous strands. All we could see were blurry green shadows, and we couldn't distinguish the branches and leaves. The rain subsided slightly, and the accumulated mist gradually dissipated. The air became fresher and the scenery became even greener. A patch of new green was like jade or emerald brocade. The mud on the branches and leaves seemed to have been washed clean. The multicolored flowers shimmered among the dense greens, like the smile of a young girl. It was a breathtaking sight! Then we all went to the flower garden, stepping on the soft paths and pushing aside the wet grass, walking slowly along the zigzag path, without raising any dust. The gentle coolness felt comfortable on the body. Everywhere we looked, the flowers competed for beauty. I especially loved a "Heart of Ice" rose among the monthly roses. Its color was pure white like mercury, and its petals were large and faced upwards, budding and blooming, as beautiful as a young woman in plain white standing under a white plum tree. There was also a type of "Oriole" rose, whose stamens were deep red like pearls and wine, and whose outer petals were light pink, also lovely, like a dancing girl swaying on a red carpet. There was another type of rose, whose flowers were bright red and clean, as if they would drip, covered with raindrops, looking like a drunken beauty with a plump figure and a coquettish posture. Mr. Zhu pointed to a yellow flower and showed it to me. The shape of its flower was the same as that of a morning glory, and its outer layer was light crimson, which reminded people of Xi Shi frowning. In total, there were about a thousand types of roses, half of which came from America, half from Germany, and the rest were domestic and Japanese varieties. Director Yang said that buying these seeds cost more than three thousand dollars, but only four or five out of ten were able to bloom luxuriantly and beautifully all year round. Section Chief Huang then said that flower workers were more difficult than doctors, because doctors could diagnose illnesses and inquire about the source of the patient's pain, while flower workers could only understand the flowers' proud "smiles," but the flowers could not speak. His words were very clever. Then Chairman Shen suddenly exclaimed, "I have found a rare flower!" Everyone rushed to look at it. The flower's color was a rich, purplish-red, piled with red blushes. Its edges were all wrapped with golden silk, only as long as a hair. It had never been seen before. Director Yang also praised this flower as the crown of the garden, but it only bloomed once a year and had not yet been named. The peonies in the garden included those that were as red as belts, like peonies; those that were slightly green, like green plums; those that were as slender as wisteria flowers; and those that were as vibrant as roses. The tender yellows and light purples swayed and emitted fragrance. It was a pity that I could not describe them all. Their fragrance and color were truly a regret. Soon after, we returned to the thatched hall for a banquet. As the wine flowed and our ears became heated, the gentlemen who accompanied me ordered me to write a record of it. I complied and wrote this without any understanding.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Evening Talk at Huiju's Home <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Wei</p>
<p>Many famous actors who come to the South are usually overwhelmed with banquets. Due to time constraints, they often leave the table after sitting for a short while, and the hosts and guests are only able to enjoy each other's company for a brief time, which is always a pity. The organizers of the Mingxing Opera Troupe are well aware of this, so they usually invite guests to the troupe after the performance at midnight to offer a welcome dinner, not adhering to conventional customs. They sip lightly and chat late into the night, which is also a good way to cut candles and see each other's friendship.</p>
<p>This time, Huiju came to Shanghai for the fourth time and his reputation soared. "Dapao Three Days," a completely new play, was paired with Jupeng's beautiful voice, which made it even more captivating. It shook the city for a time and everyone went to see it. On Saturday evening, the colleagues of Mingxing invited Xun Yan and his friend to a banquet at the company in Dumei Road. That night, it was drizzling and the road was muddy. Huiju and his friends, Furong Cao and Sha Youtian, arrived by car first and chatted with each other. Huiju was originally a consultant for the company and had often visited Shanghai before. Now, I feel that Huiju's appearance is more mature and his spirit is even more radiant. I asked Mr. Ishikawa and learned that he was directing "Such a Paradise" at the Second Photography Studio, so I went to visit in the rain. They were filming a scene in a dancer's rest room. Xia Peizhen, who played a famous dancer, was reclining on a sofa, holding her jade legs, with an unhappy expression on her face. She frequently called out with her fragrant mouth, laboriously massaging her swollen red legs, as if she would not be able to support herself if she had to dance again for a moment. Another dancer approached to offer her diligence, applying powder and massaging her, showing admiration that she could not have. Huiju saw this and smiled, and also asked Director Zhang about various techniques in cinematography. Huiju also pays close attention to the art of the silver screen. Soon, he returned to the opera troupe. Jupeng brought his young son and Yifen and others also came. They took their seats. There were three tables, and Detian, Lü Gong, and She Yu were all present. During the meal, Jianyun and Zhengqiu discussed improving the lyrics of Peking opera with Xun Yan and made many contributions. Jianyun also said that he was going to Hong Kong that day and would be back in about ten days, and he was deeply saddened that he could not listen to the opera every day. At that time, the sound of rain was getting louder outside the window and the clock had struck four. The hosts and guests then parted happily.</p>

<p>A strange method for treating malaria: Use a strip of white paper to write "two black plums, two red dates, two broad beans" according to the person's age, writing one bean for each year of age, ten beans for ten years old, twenty beans for twenty years old, and so on. After writing, fold the paper and tie it to the middle of the wrist or elbow one hour before the onset of malaria. When tying it, do not tell anyone. It must be divided into male left and female right, and then the malaria will not occur. This method is often very effective. Some people do not get better the first time, but get better the second time. It is indeed an extremely magical feat to cure diseases by writing the names of medicines and hanging them on the elbow without using any medicine. As summer gradually turns to autumn, there are those who suffer from this disease. Why not try it? (Know)</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>On the 19th, I arrived in Xijing. Visiting Japan, according to my opinion, it is better to say that Xijing is better than Tokyo.</p>
<p>That day, I visited Yasaka Shrine, Maruyama Park, the museum, the botanical garden, and the zoo, which had rare animals such as hippos and sea dogs. But the most adorable was Kinkaku-ji Temple.</p>
<p>The temple itself is nothing special, but the environment of the temple is extremely beautiful. After fourteen years, the long-awaited reunion made me linger reluctantly.</p>
<p>Revisiting Kinkaku-ji Temple</p>
<p>Having lived in Kinkaku-ji for ten years, my travels are somewhat traceable. Beyond the stream is a pavilion, beyond the pavilion is a road. The setting sun is silent, and the four mountains are deep. The dense pine shadows rise like a curtain, and ten thousand waves of damp green lock in the forest of illusion. The scenery of the stream and mountains is truly beautiful, but none of it is mine. Let my heart be at ease, and heaven enters the solitude.</p>
<p>On the 21st, I arrived in Kobe. How can I not recall my first trip abroad twenty-eight years ago when I arrived in Kobe? How can I not remember the righteousness and hospitality of my fellow villager, Mr. Chen Pingzhai, at that time? Our fellow villagers are truly good people. There was Mr. Chen abroad, and Mr. Yang at home. Alas, our fellow villagers!</p>
<p>Gu Junbingqi, Zhang Junbochu, and I, who went abroad at that time, are still alive today, while the Dongying Pavilion at No. 2 Fushan-cho, Maruyama, Hong District, Tokyo, no longer exists. Mr. Chen and Mr. Yang can no longer be seen. I revisited Mr. Chen's former residence on Shimonosho-dori, Kobe, and it has been transformed into a large building. After all, what have I done in these twenty-eight years of extended life? I must ask myself.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years ago, I fled the country and Mr. Chen Pingzhai took me in here in Kobe. I am moved by my return.</p>
<p>Having lived, I am only like a mayfly. Twenty-eight years ago, I was left with nine deaths. Where else can I find the hundred-foot tower? My return only sees the waterfall flowing in pairs. One heart for a peaceful people. Green dragons fight fiercely in the four seas of autumn. Five voyages to Penglai are made day and night. How many splendid houses and how many mountain hills.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Casual Talks on the Lake (2) <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wosheng</p>
<p>Vinegar fish cake is a famous delicacy of West Lake. It is said that Song Sao fish soup was once praised by Emperor Shou. In fact, fish soup is not vinegar fish. Hangzhou people make fish soup by steaming mandarin fish until cooked, removing the bones, and taking the meat to make soup. They add salt, egg yolk, and vinegar to make a hot and sour soup, which tastes rich and delicious, very similar to crab soup, so it is called fake crab soup. It is most fresh in February, which is when the so-called peach blossom flows and mandarin fish are fat. At that time, crucian carp have spawned and are thin, and Yangtze River Shad has not yet appeared, so only this fish is the best. However, the "West Lake Tour Record" says that there are many miscellaneous fish in the lake, but no mandarin fish. Therefore, Song Sao fish soup was uniquely praised by the emperor precisely because mandarin fish are not found in the lake. Vinegar fish is made by steaming kūn fish on water vapor and pouring vinegar sauce on it. The shredded scallions and shredded meat are not cooked in a pot, so they are fresh and tender. Kūn fish is the fish called kūn in Zhuangzi's "Northern Darkness," with an extremely large body and tender meat that is not old. It looks like a bluefish, but its body is long and round. In recent years, only small ones can be found on the market, called arrow-stem fish because they are thin, round, and slender, quite like arrow stems. Many restaurants on the lake cover them with bamboo cages and sink them in the water, calling them fish tanks. If a guest orders vinegar fish, it always comes with a cake. The so-called cake is made by slicing raw fish into extremely thin slices and mixing them with sesame oil, Sichuan peppercorns, and pepper powder, which tastes extremely fresh. Only those with no bones are considered skilled. This cannot be done in a home kitchen. Its shape is like a thin cake stuck on a Chen platter, so it is called a cake. It must be said that vinegar fish comes with a cake because a fish is specially killed just for this. Only the middle section has few bones and can be used for vinegar-braised fish. The market calls the middle section of vinegar fish the "middle section." If it does not come with a cake, then the fish is only cut in half, removing the head, to provide the tail meat, which has many thorns and cannot be eaten. Therefore, it must come with a cake so that the tail is useful and can be sliced into fish sashimi. Some people only like the cake, so they order a plate of fish sashimi. In the past, fish sashimi cost eight cents of silver per plate, the middle section of vinegar fish cost one dollar and six cents, and the whole vinegar fish cost two dollars and four cents. Whole fish refers to the whole fish with the head and tail attached. It is not half a fan. Hangzhou people do not eat this. If they do eat this, they are called "foreign plates." Hangzhou customs consider "foreign plates" and "large bowls" to be metaphors for largeness. In fact, there are only "large bowls" and no "foreign plates." The explanation of "foreign plates" has a different origin. In the past, the price of goods was calculated in silver, with seventy copper coins considered one cent of silver. Outsiders did not know the Hangzhou custom of considering one Mexican silver dollar worth seven dollars and two cents of treasury silver. In fact, seven dollars and two cents only required 504 copper coins. Copper coins were commonly called square boards. The market called them official coins. Each one weighed one mace according to the scale of the provincial treasury. Every tael of treasury silver exchanged for one thousand coins. Miscellaneous broken silver was taken to the treasury for exchange because its delivery to the Ministry of Revenue required it to be melted and made into ingots, each weighing fifty taels as standard. Therefore, a loss of about three-tenths was required. Only coins that were round and of the same size on both sides were exempt from loss in retail transactions. Because official coins were taken from the people and distributed to the people, and were not delivered to the Ministry of Revenue, the market considered seventy coins to be one cent of silver. One hundred coins would have been required to be one cent of silver, but the officials knew to use them instead of silver, so they reduced it by three-tenths.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Gold and Financial Gold Prices Rise Again <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Soaring Ten Taels Nine</p>
<p>Spot goods are said to be for export. The gold price has been trending upward for the past three days, but not without fluctuations, rising and falling by three or four taels at times. From morning to evening, it totaled eleven taels. Looking back, although the situation was chaotic, confidence remained firm. The silver market rose slightly and was not affected. Instead, the gold price rose sharply. However, the turnover of colleagues was irregular, so the market price hovered around eight hundred taels. When foreign exchange trended upward, it was only half a grade, indicating a bright release and a dark contraction. The afternoon market was particularly promising. A large trader actively purchased, and there was talk that a certain bank wanted to ship spot goods for export. Under the influence of market rumors, the market became sharp. In the end, it reached 807-808 taels. However, since the foreign exchange market lacked activity on Wednesday, the silver market may decline this morning.</p>
<p>The previous market fluctuated several times. The July opening price in the morning rose by one tael to 796.5 taels. The big bars only rose by one-eighth. The silver price was the same. The private telegram slightly increased by sixteen points at a time to 96.23 taels. The buying sentiment in the market was strong. Sen Chang, Yong Shun, Li Yuanmao, Yong Da Xing, Yong Tong, and Tai Chang were all involved. Then it rose to 800 taels and eight cents. The exchange rate was still firm. Mitsui bought Dalian at 1.7125 taels. HSBC bought British gold at 121.875 to 125. Later, Yuancheng, Yongyuanmao, Yongyu Da, Yongfeng, and others sold out. And Mitsui sold British gold at 1875 to 25. When the pre-order was announced, it retreated to 97 taels. Since the price was extended by 125, US gold by 25, and Japanese gold by a decrease of 1.75, the internal market was stable and bought by Hongli, Qianchang, and Xiang. Therefore, it rose to 99 taels in a moment. Later, Yuhe, Qianchang, Xiang, Yongfeng, and Dadecheng sold out. At 9:50 AM, it was 95.5 taels and immediately rose again. Yuancheng, Yongtianxiang, Bingxing, Xinheng, and Qianchangxiang followed suit, adding more than four taels. There was a single tael or two. At 10:30, it was 800 taels. Shortly after, it was suppressed to 97.5 taels. Hengxing came to sell, and suddenly Da Xing Yonghongli and others chased in. Mitsui absorbed British gold by 25. At 11:20, it was 802 taels and goods were sold, dropping to 99.2 cents. British gold could be settled at 1875 to 25. Suddenly, it rose by four taels and at noon it was 803 taels one cent. The market closed at 01.3 cents. It was also the retail sellers that were selling. Therefore, the goods were done at 1.5 taels. The closing price was changed to 838.2 cents. It was estimated that the amount pressed was around forty taels, thirty-six or thirty-seven taels at noon.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was open and bright. The afternoon market opened at 04.2 cents but was difficult to sell, so it was suppressed to 03.56 cents. Therefore, it was difficult for those who limited sales. People questioned the licensed sellers in the market, causing a dispute. It was said that a certain colleague had pre-ordered the sale according to the listed price, so the seller refused to cancel. The council mediated and still followed 4.2 cents, but in the future, it was not allowed to pre-order according to the listed price to avoid entanglement.

<p>The yarn market is stable. Due to the continuous drop in American cotton prices for two days, market sentiment is somewhat weak. However, the Osaka Sampin yarn market is still strong, and current yarn sales are clearer than yesterday, so people feel slightly softened. However, recent spot purchases from various parties have been very brisk, totaling over 40,000 bales, and local yarn accounts for the majority, easing the pressure on factory inventories. If there are no major changes in exchange rates, Northbound transactions are still expected to be substantial. However, buyers' minds are still watching for lower prices and have no intention of covering short positions. Judging from the facts, the yarn market should be stable, as raw materials are expensive and yarn prices are relatively low, so some small bullish investors should remain firm. The trading volume of distant months is accumulating more and more.</p>
<p>People's Standard Average, People's Standard pre-market opening: due to another drop in American cotton prices, market sentiment was weak, with each contract falling by 8 or 9 cents. The second and third sessions rebounded by 3 or 4 cents, resulting in each falling by 7, 8, or 9 cents. In the afternoon, news of gold price rebounds caused Sampin yarn to rebound, with each month rising by 4, 5, or 6 cents. Transaction volume totaled 51,200 dan. Sales exceeded purchases by 1,000 bales of Geng Feng, 1,000 bales of Changji, 1,150 bales of Xie Sheng, and 650 bales. Purchases included 2,050 bales of Yi Yu, 1,300 bales of Li Chang, 1,300 bales of Geng Feng, 750 bales of Shen Xin, and 650 bales of Xin Cheng.

<p>The cotton market is trending downwards. Due to the decline in Indian and American cotton markets, there is a great risk of an unstoppable decline, and with gold prices also weakening, market sentiment has softened, and retail investors are liquidating, causing the price to drop. However, Japanese traders are still purchasing distant-month cotton. Various factories have some transactions. The future of the cotton market is difficult to predict, it is said.</p>

<p>Zhabei. Yesterday, the new Zhabei rice market continued to see abundant sources of Changshu machine-milled japonica rice. Stocks of river rice were still substantial. Due to the weather clearing up, fewer retail stores were stocking up, and trading was slow. Market sentiment was weakening. The situation for the three types of thick japonica rice, early rice, and late rice, was declining. Qingjiao and Dujian varieties were being sold off at discounted prices. Although Changshu and Xiyang wharf premium varieties were abundant, their sales were limited, with transactions to Biànyuán and Dao Yún ending cleanly, showing signs of settling down. Yin Hua rice was slightly better, with no price increases or decreases.</p>
<p>South Shanghai. The South market received 20-30 shipments of Changshu snails. Urban and rural stores showed less interest due to the hot weather, and market sentiment was declining. Changshu machine-milled japonica rice and Zhongguan rice were each down two cents. Early rice demand was scarce, and the situation was also down one cent. Although the sales of thin rice from Ningbo were good, the Yong River was charging excessively. Therefore, they all selected Lian Tang and other market goods with low prices to transport. Duyang premium rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and the price was fixed. There was a shortage of Biànyuán goods. Yin Hua rice merchants needed it, so the price increased by about two cents.</p>

<p>Nanjing Goods Open at 3.9 Qian</p>
<p>Standard Wheat Varies</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, market sentiment was extremely unstable, with both near and distant contracts showing declines of 4-5 points. Because new wheat was about to arrive on the market and the weather was good, according to industry observers, the wheat harvest this year east of Wuxi and in the Shanghai area was not very good. However, the areas above Zhenjiang and in northern Jiangsu had about 70-80% of a normal harvest. Therefore, based on factual analysis, the situation was no worse than in previous years. The change in market sentiment was due to this reason. However, after the opening in the afternoon, because some speculators wanted to make up for their positions, large bulls again engaged in raising prices, so the market rebounded strongly. It is observed that the market may have to temporarily fluctuate for a while. As a result, this month's contract was down slightly by 2 points, July's was down slightly by 1 point, August's was unchanged, September/October's were up slightly by 1 point, and November's was down slightly by 1 point, it is said.</p>
<p>The first batch of new wheat arrived in Shanghai, totaling 400 bags of Nanjing goods, shipped jointly by four merchants from Nanjing. The opening price was 3.9 qian, and Hua Feng purchased it.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market trended weak again in all months. Because most of the domestic merchants, in view of the favorable weather and the arrival of the new wheat harvest, felt that things were going smoothly. It was heard that although Shanghai had been experiencing a lot of rain the week before, northern Jiangsu had been drier. In recent days, samples of new wheat from various producing areas had been continuously sent to Shanghai, and the quality was very good, not as bad as expected. Therefore, not only had market sentiment in outside areas softened, but also speculative bulls in Shanghai had shifted from long to short positions. As a result, market sentiment was weak, and prices fell. June and July contracts were down about 2-1.5 points, and distant contracts were down about 1 point. By the afternoon closing, the market was initially weak but then rebounded strongly due to a surge in short covering and actual sales, recovering about 1 point from the morning.

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegraph reported that the price of current Cuban sugar was lower than the previous telegraph, with May New York sugar futures falling by more than 4 points, and other months also falling by 5 points each. The prices of current Javanese sugar and June futures were unchanged, while July and August were down by 1.25 points each. Although trading in the guild market's marking disc trading was limited, the market situation slightly turned stable. The transaction price for Grade 24 Dutch sugar, coarse sand white, was 11 taels, 4 qian, and 7.5 fen, with over 1,000 bags transacted. Although it had dropped from before, the market situation was particularly strong. Grade 10 medium sand white was calling for 10 taels and 9 qian, but few were taking it. The import and export of Japanese sugar was also slow, and the market also slightly weakened. YP mark was 11 taels, 7 qian, and 7.5 fen, Minghua goods were 11 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, YT mark was 11 taels and 3 qian and 5 fen, Meiji YT mark was 11 taels and 3 qian and 7.5 fen, YR○ mark was 11 taels and 5 fen, Minghua goods were 11 taels and 7.5 fen, AR mark was 11 taels and 5 qian and 5 fen, and TM mark was 11 taels and 2 qian and 2.5 fen.

<p>Improved Varieties, Cocoon Prices Highest at Only 50 Yuan</p>
<p>This year's spring cocoon harvest in Changzhou's various cities and villages is remarkably poor, with overall production at no more than 30% of a normal year. The opening of cocoon trading in the western villages occurred one day earlier than in the eastern villages. Only 12-13 cocoon trading houses opened across the county. Weighing and purchasing have been ongoing for four days, and the supply on the market is not strong. Furthermore, there are few high-quality cocoons and many inferior ones, and opening prices are not high. In Qishuyan, the price for first-grade improved varieties in the eastern villages opened at 50 yuan. In the Mawangqiao area of the western villages, the highest price was only 17-18 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the Yangzhuang tea market in Shanghai, Zhenmei green tea from the eastern road of Wuyuan, opened by Baitou Zhuang Ruichang, Fulin, and other firms, had a new opening price of 190 taels, and Gongxi opened at 102 taels. Both are the highest prices ever seen. The market price of Tunxi extracted Zhenmei continued to increase yesterday, opening up to 340 taels. The prosperity of the green tea market has reached its peak. However, it is still difficult to consider arrivals at the trading houses as optimistic. The trade in Qimen and Fuliang red tea on the market was even scarcer yesterday, and market sentiment continued to weaken. However, the total amount of Qifu red tea this year is only 60,000 boxes, and more than 40,000 boxes have already been sold, so it seems not difficult to sell out. However, most of the remaining goods are of inferior quality. According to the current market situation, Russian firms still find the price expensive, and British firms are not in urgent need, so the market plate is bound to continue to fall, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Yesterday's Anti-Smoking Commemoration Assembly by All Circles in This City <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Simultaneous Pledge to Reject Drugs</p>
<p>Yesterday (June 3rd) marked the 92nd anniversary of Lin Zexu's burning of opium. Prior to this, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the China National Anti-Drug Association jointly prepared and decided to hold a commemoration assembly at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10 a.m. yesterday. They also sent letters to various organs and organizations in the city, inviting them to send representatives to participate. The details of yesterday's meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Representatives from over 60 organizations and individuals, including the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, the China National Anti-Drug Association, totaling over 600 people.</p>
<p>Assembly Staff: Presidium: Pan Gongzhan (City Party Department), Huang Jiahuai (China National Anti-Drug Association), Zhang Qun (Representative of the City Government, Chen Kecheng); Recording: Bingxun Stenography Agency, Shen Fuyang.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered the opening address, stating: "Today, representatives from all circles are gathered here to hold the Anti-Smoking Commemoration Assembly. For the past eighty-odd years, the disasters suffered by China under the oppression of unequal treaties imposed by imperialists all originated from the Opium War. Ninety-two years ago, British merchants sold opium drugs in Guangzhou. In 1838, Governor-General of Liangguang, Mr. Lin Zexu, knowing the harm of opium, ordered British merchants to surrender opium, which was completely burned at Humen. This action truly represented the determination of our Chinese government and people to ban opium. If the people of the whole country could have thoroughly implemented Mr. Lin's policy at that time and strived to resist the British troops, China would not be as poor as it is today, and the people would not be as weak as they are today. Now, under the leadership of the National Government, we should strive to reject drugs according to the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Many representatives in this National Assembly have paid attention to the issue of drug rejection, and the final resolution was to hand it over to the National Government for proper planning. The anti-drug measures to be drafted by the National Government in the future should be based on the proposals of the National Assembly. As for the anti-drug work, it cannot be accomplished by individuals, a few people, or the government alone; it requires all the people of the country to understand the harm of opium before it can be truly effective. It is wrong to rely solely on government laws. Although the government has established very strict anti-smoking laws, what is the effect? Aren't planters still planting, peddlers still peddling, and opium smokers still smoking? Not only has it not decreased, but it has increased. Therefore, the work of eliminating drugs cannot rely solely on government laws; opium can be fundamentally eliminated. The fundamental way is to make the people aware of the harm of opium and to be able to restrain themselves, which is the most important way. In the past, when Chinese people saw opium dealers making a fortune, they all regarded opium dealing as a way to get rich and did not feel ashamed, but instead regarded it as an honorable business. Therefore, the work of rejecting drugs cannot be completed by simply holding meetings; it must be propagated to the public every day. The purpose of our meeting today is to enable the people to implement the work of rejecting drugs, not to approach opium for life, and to persuade those who used to sell and smoke opium not to sell or smoke it again in the future. This is the purpose of today's commemoration meeting." Drug Situation: Subsequently, Guo Zhenliang, representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported on the situation of smoking ban in the city in the past year (details have been seen in yesterday's newspaper). Huang Jiahuai, the director of the China National Anti-Drug Association, then reported on the anti-drug movement in the past year, briefly stating that the association has been established for nearly seven years, and has seen many difficulties and dangers. However, the association is entrusted by the people of the country and hopes to dare to forge ahead and deal with the scourge of smoke in order to seek the final victory. In the past year, the association has strived to promote the anti-drug movement, and the determination of the association to strive for progress has not been diminished due to environmental obstacles. On the occasion of the 92nd anniversary of Lin Gong Zexu's burning of opium, the association's work in the past year is briefly described as follows: (1) Anti-Drug Propaganda: The association has always regarded propaganda as the backbone of its work. Since its establishment, it has worked hard on this end at all times, and the national anti-drug organizations across the country have also based on this guideline. Both internal and external parties have advanced simultaneously, and the National Anti-Drug Movement Week and the National Tour Anti-Drug Movement are held annually. The former was held from October 1st to 7th last year, and anti-drug organizations across the country also held it together. The latter was held in the spring of this year, and the tour anti-drug movement of the association, together with anti-drug exhibits, went to various places for touring exhibitions. Recently, the Zhejiang branch also held the above two movements in eastern Zhejiang, which has greatly benefited the propaganda. (2) Anti-Drug Education: Anti-drug education is the primary work of the anti-drug movement. The association has worked hard to promote it. For example, the anti-drug exhibits compiled by the education section of the association have been sent to various places in Nanyang and Northeast for exhibitions to promote propaganda. At the same time, in order to arouse the anti-drug interest of the student community, a student anti-drug speech contest was held in November last year. In Shanghai, nine universities, more than ten middle schools, and ninety-two elementary schools participated in the competition, breaking the previous record. Recently, the association also held a national student essay competition, and places as far away as Liaoning, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan have successively signed up to join, which shows that the national academic community has felt a considerable interest in the anti-drug movement, and the number of anti-drug organizations in various places that have held separate events is even more numerous. It is estimated that there are currently thirty-eight universities and ninety-six middle schools that have signed up and submitted articles. (3) Drug Situation Survey: In addition to the usual national survey of the opium poisoning situation and the results of the smoking ban this year, the association also sent personnel to Taiwan to investigate the monopoly system, and the investigation of the drug situation of overseas Chinese in the Nanyang colonies is still ongoing. The investigation and statistics of other narcotic drugs are also in progress. (4) Supervising the Smoking Ban: The only purpose of this book is to urge the government to implement the smoking ban. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and adopted the association's proposition of banning opium, the association has vowed to support this policy and promote its thoroughness. In the past year, it has done its best to expose incidents that undermine the smoking ban, such as opposing smoking in Min and Wan, and opposing special taxes in Lianghu. For the large amount of opium seized by the Shanghai Jianghai Customs several times last year, the association has also strongly requested that it be burned to show compliance with the smoking ban laws and to chill the courage of the traitorous merchants. (5) Protesting Against the Opium Public Sale Spring: The association heard from outside that the government had abandoned the policy of banning opium and adopted a public implementation system. For a time, public opinion was divided and foreign countries took notice. In order to implement its consistent proposition, the association united with the Shanghai Transshipment Corporation and the national anti-drug organizations to rise up and protest. Later, the government stated that it was not true and did not adopt this system, but the advocates are still trying their best to promote it. The association is opposing this policy of destroying the country and exterminating the race with all its strength. (6) Promoting Smoking Cessation: The fundamental key to the anti-drug movement is to establish smoking cessation hospitals in various places to benefit the compatriots who are poisoned in various places and actually save many smokers. In Shanghai, smokers often come to the association to request to be sent to the hospital to quit smoking. Most of these smokers are poor people. The association has introduced them to appropriate hospitals. However, due to the large number of people, it is difficult to cope with them. Now, it has contacted various hospitals to provide free or subsidized smoking treatment according to the status of smokers, and will send smokers to quit smoking one after another. The above-mentioned matters are the outline of the association's work in the past year, and it is mostly due to the support of all circles. If the poisonous substance of opium is not cleared up one day, the association's responsibility will not be over. In the future, it will strive for the assistance of compatriots across the country. It is deeply hoped that the people of the country will regard it as their own responsibility and jointly plan for it. This is not only the luck of the anti-drug movement, but also the luck of the party and the country.</p>
<p>Representative Speeches: Subsequently, Dr. Wang Jingqi gave a speech on behalf of Mr. Zhou Chucai, roughly stating that there are 131 factories manufacturing narcotic drugs in various countries around the world, and more than 1.41 million taels of morphine and heroin are imported into our country every year. The foreigners who were arrested for drug trafficking accounted for 208 in five years, and the methods of transportation are even more ingenious. The foreign soil seized by the customs was 4,755 taels in 1929 and 10,104 taels in 1930. We see the evil consequences of China being affected by foreign drugs in this way. Commentators often blame the concessions for not being recovered, but countries around the world falsely accuse us of saying that China does not ban smoking, and there is no way to ban smoking. After the Far East Investigation Team came to China, they made many inaccurate reports to the international community, and erased the advantages of China's smoking ban and said more about China's disadvantages, which is the opposite of our opinions. Imperialism regards opium as a policy to wipe out the people of the colonies they call semi-civilized or uncivilized, and constantly imports the scourge of opium, turning China into the current situation. We should certainly blame the foreigners, but for a hundred years, the people of our country who have been infected with drugs understand its harm but do not repent, and some people only seek profit and are willing to be assistants to imperialism, making themselves mentally anesthetized first. We should blame ourselves even more. Mr. Jingqi asked whether the word "sincerity" was repeatedly raised in the League of Nations. Otherwise, the world's smoking ban would go backwards. Mr. Lin knew the scourge of opium ninety-two years ago and resolutely had the Humen opium burning incident, which is why he is admired by future generations. The perseverance of this great anti-drug figure should be taken as a good example by our anti-drug comrades. If we all use the word "sincerity" to ban smoking and reject drugs, I think everyone can be successors to Mr. Lin and make China's smoking industry very clear. Finally, representatives from the two special party departments and other organizations spoke one after another, roughly hoping that compatriots across the country would unanimously join the anti-drug campaign and that the government would effectively ban smoking. Finally, the oath was taken and the meeting adjourned. It is said that anti-drug organizations across the country contacted local public groups on the same day to hold the same commemoration.</p>
<p>County Government Meeting: The Shanghai County Government held an anti-smoking commemoration at 10 a.m. yesterday. All staff members of the county government and various bureaus and offices attended, and the county party department also sent personnel to participate. After the meeting, etiquette was performed as usual. First, Chairman Yan Shenyu, the county magistrate, delivered the opening address. Then, Yao Fusheng, representative of the Public Security Division, reported on the situation of the smoking ban in the past year, with a total of 37 smoking cases, 355.8 taels of smokers, 187 smoking tools, 3 morphine needles, and more than 2 taels of opium bubbles and opium paste. 51 male offenders and 13 female offenders were reported. After the report, the directors of each bureau spoke successively about the harm of opium. The etiquette was completed and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued a notice yesterday, stating: "It is hereby notified that labor and management are in the same boat and are closely related. It is even more appropriate to work together to overcome difficulties, especially in today's economic invasion. However, recent investigations have revealed that there are many disputes between labor and management due to trivial matters, and they do not apply for mediation or arbitration in accordance with the regulations of the labor-management department, and they shut down and strike suddenly. Such direct actions not only undermine industry and hinder livelihoods, but also affect public security and violate discipline. The bureau has learned from this and jointly issued a notice to reiterate the ban, urging both labor and management in the city to comply. Any disputes should first be negotiated peacefully by representatives directly. If the dispute cannot be resolved, it should be submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. If the dispute has not been resolved through mediation or arbitration, it is strictly prohibited to shut down or strike without authorization. Once verified, it will be severely punished and no leniency will be given. Please be careful of this notice."</p>

<h3 id="e150">Actual Situation of Cigarette Warehouse Coupon Fund <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Talks by Xie Qi, Director of the Unified Tax Administration</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported that the market price of various cigarette warehouse coupons has recently fluctuated slightly, and those who do not know the truth outside may think that it has something to do with a part of the Guangdong cigarette tax. The reporter therefore visited Xie Qi, Director of the Unified Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance, to inquire about the income of the cigarette unified tax and the actual situation of the guarantee of this warehouse coupon. According to Xie, the income of the central cigarette unified tax can exceed 4 million yuan per month in the autumn and winter seasons, that is, in the summer when the mildew season is worth it, the factories produce less cigarettes, and the monthly income is at least more than 3 million yuan. When the 20-year cigarette warehouse coupon was issued, although it was designated that 250,000 yuan per month would be paid from the Guangdong Province cigarette unified tax revenue as part of the fund, on the one hand, 250,000 yuan was still allocated from the unified tax balance as a provincial cooperation fund, and there was also 450,000 yuan in silver dollars to offset the likin cooperation fund. Recently, the unified tax balance is no longer allocated to Guangdong, that is, to pay for the fund, so there is no difference in the fund, and the expenditure of the tax is relatively more economical. It is estimated that the continued issuance of 19-year and 20-year cigarette warehouse coupons requires about 2.7 million yuan per month to repay the principal and interest. According to the cigarette unified tax income in May, which is currently the off-season in the mildew season, the number is still more than 3.11 million yuan, which is more than enough to repay the principal and interest. The recent drop in the price of the warehouse coupon is probably due to the lack of understanding of the original cause by foreigners. Remembering to inquire whether the unified tax warehouse coupon to be issued will affect the cigarette warehouse coupon fund, he gave a separate detailed description. The unified tax warehouse coupon is designated to use the cigarette tax balance and cotton yarn wheat flour tax as the fund, and only needs to guarantee more than 1.4 million yuan in principal and interest per month. The cotton yarn tax was only opened in February, and there are still many old stocks. These stocks were specially allowed to be exempted from the unified tax before they left the factory on April 16 to show leniency. Although there is this huge amount of tax exemption, the income in April was still more than 1.4 million yuan, and it increased to more than 1.6 million yuan in May. The actual revenue of wheat flour tax in April and May was 400,000 yuan. It is already more than enough to allocate these two items to the unified tax warehouse coupon fund.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Ziqiang Battleship Fully Completed <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Test Drive Scheduled for the First of Next Month</p>
<p>The Ziqiang warship, which was ordered to be renovated by the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Bureau of the Navy, has been under construction for nearly half a year and the entire project is about to be completed. A test drive and gun test are scheduled for the first of next month. The general situation and tonnage of the ship are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Ship: The Ziqiang warship was originally named Jianwei and was manufactured in the Fuzhou Mawei Shipyard. It has been 42 years old. In the past, due to disrepair, the authorities regarded the project as huge and almost abandoned it. Last year, Naval Vice-Minister Chen Shaokuan urgently needed a ship for patrolling and suppressing bandits, so he made an overall plan to reform the ship and renamed it Ziqiang. In February this year, he ordered the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Bureau to rush to repair and renovate it. It has been four months since then. Because the repair and renovation project is exceptionally agile, the entire project is about to be completed.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Ship: The ship is 620 feet long, 27 feet wide, 11 feet draft, 1,000 tons of water, and has a speed of 20 nautical miles per hour. It is equipped with 12 large cannons, 3 high-altitude cannons, 2 six-pound cannons, and 8 machine guns.</p>
<p>Scheduled for Test Drive: The Ministry of the Navy ordered the First Fleet Command of this port yesterday to drive to Longhua on July 1 for the first test drive to clarify whether the speed and efficiency are suitable. It is also reported that Naval Vice-Minister Chen Shaokuan will personally come to Shanghai to board the ship for inspection on that day.</p>

<p>Divided into North and South City Four Areas</p>
<p>Old Materials Allowed for Building Flat Houses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating: "In order to encourage citizens to build houses, they often try to save construction costs and use old materials, which often leads to dangers. We have already issued a notice that the load-bearing parts of new houses are prohibited from using old materials without authorization. This restriction was originally to ensure public safety. However, in recent years, the cost of building materials for flat houses in undeveloped areas of the city has become increasingly expensive. The structure of flat houses is simple and not as good as buildings. There have been requests to allow the use of old materials in order to reduce costs. The bureau has reviewed the situation and decided to encourage the people to build houses, facilitate civilian rentals, reduce shantytowns, and revitalize the city. It has now designated the area west of Jumen Road and south of Xie Xu Road in the south of Shanghai, and the area north of Zhongshan North Road (formerly Sanyang Road) and west of Baoxing Road in Zhabei as pilot areas for encouraging house building. Citizens are allowed to use old materials to build low-rent flat houses for the purpose of renting. However, the load-bearing wood must be free of rot, patching, fire damage, etc., and must be completely new. The brick materials for the load-bearing walls must also be whole, with uniform size, to ensure safety. Other procedures such as applying for permits will still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the city's temporary building regulations."</p>
<h3 id="e155">National Goods Association Requests Exemption of Ramie Export Tax <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Ramie is a Sideline Product of Farmers and Should be Treated the Same as Silk and Tea</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association telegraphed the Ministry of Industry yesterday to request exemption of ramie export tax, saying: "Ministry of Industry, Minister Kong Junjian, it is reported that Liu Yufu and Zhao Shihua, representatives of the Jiangxi ramie industry, Duan Yuliang and Peng Jiqing, representatives of the Sichuan ramie industry, Zhang Guozhu, representative of the Hunan ramie industry, and Lin Shichun and Yao Chenggao, representatives of the Guangdong ramie industry, jointly signed a letter stating: 'We respectfully request that you forward the request to exempt ramie from tax in order to maintain special products and promote sales. Ramie in our country is a sideline industry of agriculture. It is woven by women with ramie as raw material. The areas of origin are mostly Jiangxi and Sichuan, followed by Hunan and Chaozhou in Guangdong, and Suzhou in Jiangsu. The total annual output is about 20 million yuan. The largest sales market is North Korea, which is no less than 1,800,000 yuan. In addition, hundreds of thousands of yuan can be sold in the north and south provinces of the country. In recent years, military affairs in the country have been frequent, and taxes and donations in various provinces have been overlapping. The Japanese in North Korea have adopted a policy of rejecting foreign goods and heavily increasing import taxes. Recently, the production area of fine cloth, which is worth more than yuan per 100 jin, is charged 72 yen, the middle grade is charged 52 yuan, and the coarse goods are also charged 34 yuan. Therefore, the annual sales in North Korea have been sharply reduced to more than half, with an annual rate of only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Domestic sales are affected by foreign goods and overlapping taxes, and the cost has increased, so the number of sales is also greatly reduced. If this continues, the future of the ramie business, which is a sideline industry of agriculture, will be in an unimaginable state of decline. At the current value of the government's vigorous implementation of the people's livelihood policy and the revision of the new export tax rules, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has insight into the declining situation of domestic agriculture and commerce. On the Yangri application, in response to the requirements of the times and the commercial theories, it telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to advocate that cooked goods should be exempted from export tax according to commercial policy, and first listed ramie, which is sold in North Korea, as the first type to be exempted from tax. The far-sighted and rapid-growing vision is truly worthy of being a commercial group leading the national business community. Although the annual output of ramie, a special product of our country, is not as large as that of silk and tea, its nature is the same as that of agricultural sideline products, and it is the same as silk and tea. Now that silk and tea have been approved for tax exemption, ramie is the same. Therefore, we especially express the difficulties of agriculture and commerce, the recent decline of the ramie industry, and the urgent need to maintain the situation. We respectfully request the Ministry of Industry to submit the item of ramie to the Legislative Yuan for review and implement tax exemption in order to maintain special products and promote sales. We cannot wait to hear from you.' Since ramie is made by hand weaving and is a common item for summer use, please also allow it to be exempted from tax in the same way as handmade cloth. All farmers and merchants in the country will be infinitely grateful.' Because of the above factors, we rely on your association's leadership and advocacy of national goods, and the enthusiasm and perseverance of the whole country are admired. Therefore, we enumerate the difficult situation of the ramie business, and in addition to requesting the Ministry of Industry, we respectfully request your association to forward the request to the government for strong assistance to achieve the purpose of tax exemption. The national farmers and merchants will benefit from it.' According to this, the Standing Committee of the Association deliberated and decided to forward the report according to the situation. We respectfully request the leaders to forward the report to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval to exempt it from tax in the same way as the handmade cloth industry, so as to reduce costs and maintain industry and commerce. We cannot wait to hear from you. May we have your instructions and obey them." Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqi, Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, bow to you. Jiang Yin.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Goods Ordered Before the Implementation of the Export Tariff <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Also Need to Pay Taxes According to the New Tariff Rate</p>
<p>The Dama Daily reported that Major-General Meilehe of the Customs Service has followed the instructions of the Ministry of Finance and notified all customs offices that all export goods must pay the full amount in accordance with the new export tariff rules issued by the government. Even those who have signed contracts with foreign countries before the implementation of the new tariff rules should also handle it in the same way and should not be allowed to reduce taxes at the time of export. According to Chinese and foreign exporters, the prices set when signing contracts are generally calculated based on the old tariff rate. Now, when delivering goods, they must pay taxes according to the new tariff rate and suffer another loss.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Reduction of Export Taxes on Tung Oil and Bamboo Firecrackers and Cigarettes <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the Oil, Hemp, Firecracker, and Cigarette Industry Association requesting the transfer of a petition to the National Government for a reduction of new export taxes to benefit the export of national goods. Yesterday, it specially submitted the petition to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a review and re-implementation. The summary of the telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Oil: To the esteemed Executive Yuan in Nanjing: On the 2nd of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Oil and Hemp Industry Association stating that after the Ministry of Finance announced the new export tariff regulations, the tax rate on Tung Oil was increased by a huge 2.56 times. We immediately telegraphed to request a re-evaluation of the taxable price and a lighter revision, and requested your association to forward the telegraphic draft to request a tax reduction. We read in the newspaper that your association has already presented the matter to the Ministry of Finance and strongly requested a reduction in the tax rate, which shows your great concern. We are immensely grateful. Now we have received telegram No. 6380 from the Ministry of Finance, which states: "The telegram has been received. After reviewing the new export tariff regulations, the Tung Oil tax rate was reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by decree. The Ministry is unable to comply with the request to revise the Tung Oil export tax rate to be lighter. Please be informed." The Ministry of Finance's seal. Knowing this, the matter concerns legislation, and the Ministry of Finance will not reduce the tax. The suffering of merchants cannot reach the authorities. We implore your association, since you have forwarded the matter to the Ministry of Finance, to appeal to the authorities again to find a way to provide relief so that the Tung Oil export business does not follow in the footsteps of silk and tea, etc. After arriving at the association, we found that the association stated the previous situation: Tung Oil sales abroad have been subject to American planting of Tung trees for resistance, just as Chinese tea has been invaded by Indian and Ceylon products, and the trend is only downward. The new tariff is more than 2.5 times heavier than the old tariff, which will inevitably increase costs and make it more difficult. We telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance to consider that the Tung Oil exported from our country is no longer comparable to the monopoly market of several years ago, to re-evaluate and revise the price, or to change from quantitative tax to ad valorem tax, so as to avoid excessive burden on exporters. So far, we have not received an order to reply. Now it is said that the ministry has rejected the request, and the Tung Oil exporters are suffering without the authorities' concern and relief. The heavy tax will inevitably lead to slow sales, and our country's only exported Tung Oil will fall. According to the tariff protection policy, isn't this going in the opposite direction? It is appropriate to again request your esteemed association to review and instruct the Legislative Yuan to re-examine and revise the tariff, and at the same time order the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend the new tax in order to maintain a lifeline for Tung Oil."</p>
<p>Firecrackers: To the esteemed National Government Ministry of Finance: On May 30, we received a letter from the Firecracker Industry Association of this city stating that the new export tariff regulations promulgated by the National Government tax firecrackers at 1.2 taels per picul, an increase of 7 mace over the original tax rate, which is shocking. The firecracker is purely a handicraft product, and its raw materials, paper and sulfur, have already been taxed. According to the principle of one tax per item, the firecrackers made of this paper and sulfur should be exempted from tax. 1. Most of the sales markets for firecrackers are in Mumbai, Annam, and various ports in Southeast Asia. In order to promote export trade, it should be requested to be tax-free. 2. The number of workers and merchants who live directly and indirectly on firecrackers is no less than several million. In order to maintain the development of their livelihoods, it should be requested to be tax-free. 3. This letter is sent to respectfully request your review and transfer it to the government to follow the precedents of tea and silk to allow tax exemption in order to facilitate development. Upon arrival at the association, it was found that the firecracker industry is related to the livelihood of manual workers. Traditionally, the only place where exports have been sold abroad is Annam, which is worth more than 6 million francs (according to French statistics in 1925). Together with tea and medicines, it is an important export item of China. The association telegraphed to your government on May 7 of this year, stating that the export tax on firecrackers should not be increased. If the newly revised tax rate passed by the Legislative Yuan is indeed higher than before for this export tax, it should be reviewed, revised, and promulgated again. Based on the previous letter, it is appropriate to telegraph again for review and approval as requested.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: (Above omitted) On May 30, we received a letter from the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association (reported in the previous newspaper), specially sent to your association to quickly submit it to the Ministry of Industry and to consider the difficulties of merchants and to provide protection, and to forward it to the National Government to promote the purpose of national products and to temporarily suspend the implementation of the cigarette export tax. Upon arrival at the association, it was found that cigarettes are indeed a consumable product sold domestically. Promoting sales abroad is a manufactured product rather than a raw material. From the perspective of international trade, it should still be encouraged. Therefore, according to the method of imitating foreign goods with machines, the export tax is exempted because it is shipped abroad. Although the newly revised export tariff regulations include machine-made cotton yarn and imitation cigarettes in the tax items, the telegram from the Customs Administration to the Federation of Chinese Yarn Factories stated that the collection and exemption of tariffs on cotton yarn and cotton cloth exported to foreign countries will still be handled according to the existing regulations. That is, the established case of tax exemption for machine-made imitation foreign goods exported abroad will not be changed due to the newly revised export tariff regulations. The machine-made cigarettes are subject to the same rule. It is appropriate to telegraph to clarify the situation in order to reassure merchants. It is for the public good. Respectfully from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Qian Chengxu's Talk After Returning to Shanghai <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Recent Situation of Beining Railway and Kailuan Mining</p>
<p>The Beining Railway Bureau and the Kailuan Mining Bureau had a misunderstanding due to issues such as liquidation, train suspension, and delayed freight charges, which caused a dispute that lasted for more than two months and remained unresolved. In view of the environmental needs, the China General Federation of Industry and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce specially appointed Qian Chengxu as a representative to go to Beiping to mediate with the Kailuan authorities. Yesterday, he returned to Shanghai and said that his mission was not disgraced, and there was no problem with the recovery of coal transportation. The reporter asked Mr. Qian about the reasons for going to Beiping and the process of mediation. Mr. Qian replied that around 1920 and 1930, domestic wars were not over. Kailuan Mining, because of its foreign investment, was not devastated by the war. Users in various places were happy to trade with it because it could provide supplies on time, and they did not prepare large amounts of coal in advance. In March of this year, coal arrived in Shanghai and felt a shortage. The impact was that the market for the coal industry was affected by the inability to adjust supply and demand. Japanese coal took the opportunity to flood the market and could not be contained. At that time, users and the mining bureau had a supply contract, but in fact, after investigation, the sales office had no coal to deliver, and users were unable to purchase from other places due to the high price of coal. They were afraid that a coal shortage would occur when the supply was not available. My mission to Beiping was to promote the recovery of Kailuan in order to have fundamental relief. As for the mediation process, I started from Shanghai on May 12 and presented the general situation to the relevant departments in Beijing and Tianjin. The Ministry of Industry sent Director Lao Shuzhuang of the Labor Bureau and Director Hu Boyuan of the Mining Administration to investigate. On the 14th, I went to Tianjin to meet with Hu Ruoyu, the director of Kailuan Mining, who agreed to take responsibility for mediation. Soon after, Deputy Commander Zhang of the capital sent a telegram to urge him, and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also came forward to mediate. At this time, the attitude of both parties was likely to approach. I will not talk about the official language. At that time, I also proposed conditions to both parties in my position as a mediator: one party would restore the Kailuan coal transportation situation, and the other party would provide 1 million yuan in cash in the name of the industrial and commercial groups as collateral for the Kailuan liquidation account. The Kailuan authorities agreed to give serious consideration to this, but after May 20, both parties began direct negotiations. By the time I returned to the south, all outstanding cases had a predetermined solution plan, and the formalities could be completed after both parties signed. At this point, the reporter asked Mr. Qian about the recent observations of coal use in North China and the business situation of Kailuan. Mr. Qian replied that the source of coal used in North China is very broad. For example, the mines of Kailuan in Hebei Province, Jingxing in Lincheng, Beipiao in Liaoning Province, Zhongkang in Henan Province, Baogao and Datong in Shanxi Province, and Zhongxing and Ludong in Shandong Province have all occupied a considerable position today. The users do not feel a shortage of coal due to the Kailuan problem. In short, the regional status of the coal mine is that more local products are sold locally, which is the convenience of the time and place, which is different from the situation in South China. As for the Kailuan business policy, I observed that since 1921, one party has adopted a huge production policy, and the other party has organized a powerful sales machine. Therefore, it can supply the market with low-priced goods and can directly sell goods to users to eliminate the heavy rebate of middlemen. In addition, the former Jingfeng Railway Bureau's successive foreign car affairs general camps were also British, and their nationalities were the same, and they could contact each other in many ways to obtain convenience. The daily output of coal was only about 8,000 tons a day ten years ago, but now it has jumped to more than 60,000 tons, occupying the first position in the domestic coal mines. However, according to the current situation, the Beining Railway Bureau's car affairs are now managed by Chinese, and in addition to this dispute, foreigners have understood their own environment. As a result, it may abandon its active policy and adopt a tight policy.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Seamen's Industrial Federation is located on Qiujiang Road in northern Shanghai and is the general organization of seamen from various ships. There is also a Shanghai branch in the southern city. In addition to the small amount of membership fees, the association's funding is provided by the Central Party Headquarters with a monthly allocation of more than 2,000 yuan as the association's operating expenses. In April of this year, the association planned to convene a national seamen's representative meeting to report to the Central Party Headquarters. The approval was given that the association must reorganize according to the new organization, and the full representative meeting was temporarily postponed, so it was not implemented. Now the association must implement reorganization and has automatically dissolved. All internal committee members have also left the association. All official documents, equipment, and other items will be temporarily taken over by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters. Before the takeover, they will be sealed and police from the Public Security Bureau will be stationed to guard them.</p>

It was resolved that the matter should be submitted to the provincial government for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus Order Binding Industry to Resume Work <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>If Over Three Days, It Will Be Considered Voluntary Dismissal</p>
<p>More than 120 workers in the local Chinese and foreign bookbinding industry, such as Ma Hongji, went on a third strike to increase wages for six days. The Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus jointly issued a notice yesterday ordering the resumption of work, and it was heard that there would be temporary suspension of work activities and handling of workers who caused trouble. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preventing Work: Yesterday, the striking workers found that Youwen Bookbinding in Hongxingfang, Hongxing Road, Zhabei, was working as usual. At about 8:00 am, they went to prevent it. Each person held a stick of incense and several strings of long ingots. When they saw someone working, they used the incense to burn them. The owner, Tao Xiaochun, was burned. The 5th Branch of the Public Security Bureau sent a large number of armed police to arrest the troublemakers, including Shu Mingzheng, Ji Shunqi, and Shu Fuquan from Deda Bookbinding on Zhiyuan Road, Xia Shuangxi from Ma Hongji Bookbinding, Yin Linhai from Fuyouji Bookbinding, and workers from Hexing Box Factory, a total of thirteen people. After District Chief You questioned them, he decided that because the matter was related to forced strike, they should be sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Joint Notice: Chen Xizeng, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, issued a joint notice stating that the issue of the labor-management treatment agreement requested by the bookbinding industry union had been resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau's legally convened mediation committee on May 29. However, a small number of workers in the industry deliberately made trouble and incited a strike. If this illegal action is not strictly stopped, how can social order be maintained and labor movement be beneficial? It is hereby announced that all workers in the industry must comply and resume work within three days. Those who dare to disobey will be considered voluntarily dismissed, and each employer may recruit new workers. Be careful not to wait and see and mislead yourself.</p>
<p>Maintaining Order: The workers' representatives of the bookbinding industry issued a notice yesterday, stating that in this emergency, please wait patiently for a solution. Please do not gather in crowds or parade in groups. In the past two days, many workers have had misunderstandings, resulting in arrests by the Public Security Bureau. This is because it is illegal. If there are places where people are secretly working, only a few comrades can be sent to persuade them. Do not destroy other people's belongings. You must keep your mouths shut and not speak. This requires everyone's attention. As for the solution, we are actively working on it and will definitely have a solution to inform you. Please maintain order.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Dispute Over Sale of Guangda Steamer <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Employees Present Reasons</p>
<p>Jun'an Society Submits to Prevent Sale</p>
<p>The Guangda Steamer of the China Merchants Bureau's Nanhua Line has been under repair at the Jiangnan Shipyard for two months. Now it has been completed. The business department staff on the ship have suffered huge losses in food, accommodation, and hotels during the suspension period. Recently, they went to the bureau to urge the start of the voyage to maintain their livelihoods. However, they suddenly heard that the bureau was taking the excuse of the Guangda being old and selling it cheaply, and someone had already contacted them. The entire ship's employees were panicked and rushed to the Jun'an Society to ask General Manager Guo to stop the sale. The reasons they put forward are: (1) The steel plate of the Guangda is the best-quality iron of Ximing Maidings, which is several times higher than that of new ships in recent times. (2) There are many ships in the bureau that are older than the Guangda and not as strong as the Guangda. (3) The ship only needs to replace a four-eyed furnace to increase speed and save five tons of coal per day. (4) It costs six to seven hundred thousand to purchase a new ship like Guangda with the current price of hardware. Now, instead of studying the repairs, we have come up with this plan of giving up eating for fear of choking, which not only causes problems for the lives of more than 100 employees on the entire ship but also causes significant losses to the bureau's business and ship prices. They asked the Jun'an Society to submit to the new General Manager to cancel the proposal to sell the Guangda. The Jun'an Society has been comforting the workers for several days, advising them not to panic and to continue to serve on the ship with peace of mind. At the same time, it submitted to the China Merchants Bureau's General Manager according to the situation reported by the workers, asking him to consider the lives of the seamen and asking General Manager Guo to personally inspect the Guangda Steamer to clarify the ship's solid advantages and not sell it at a low price, which would cause disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e163">False Accusation Against Wooden Boat Cleared <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Lin Shicai of Xiushan, Dinghai, owned a sailing ship named Jintai Kang. On May 3 of this year, he loaded timber worth more than 17,000 yuan from the Wantai Timber Company in Fujian and transported it to the Fuheyuan Timber Company in Xiannvzhen, Yangzhou. At 5:00 pm on the 22nd, it sailed to the Damuyang waters of Zhejiang Province. The Jiangxing Steamer, which was loaded with coal, was behind the Jintai Kang sailing ship. Unexpectedly, the helmsman of the steamer neglected his duties and sailed straight towards the Jintai Kang sailing ship. The crew of the Jintai Kang shouted loudly to keep the ship away. Although the steamer heard it and urgently steered away, it was too late. The wire rope on the side of the steamer was trapped in the timber loaded on the right side of the Jintai Kang. At that time, the wind and waves were very strong, and it was impossible to untangle it. The steamer destroyed the wooden cable tied to the right side of the Jintai Kang, causing more than a thousand pieces of timber to drift away, and the spring oar was also damaged. Fortunately, it quickly anchored to avoid further collisions. Chen Ruisheng, the agent of the Jintai Kang, negotiated with the steamer and asked the steamer to tow the Jintai Kang to Dinghai. The steamer refused to tow, saying that it was too weak to tow, but said that the steamer would first go to Dinghai and then hire another steamer to tow it. Then he ordered two sailors to go to the Jintai Kang and invited Chen Ruisheng to take his ship to Dinghai to gain trust. After the agreement was reached, the steamer left first. However, after waiting until the 24th, no steamer came to tow it. Fortunately, the wooden cables were securely tied, so it was barely feasible to sail. So it raised its sails and sailed forward, and because Dafan was approaching the high tide, it was worried that the date would be missed and the business would be hindered. So instead of going to Dinghai, it sailed to Qitou and hired a small boat to send the two sailors of the Jiangxing Steamer to Dinghai, while the Jintai Kang sailed straight to the Jiangsu border and found that it had arrived at Xiannvzhen. However, after the Jiangxing Steamer arrived in Dinghai, it tried to evade compensation and falsely accused the Jintai Kang to the Dinghai Water Police Team of being a pirate ship that robbed the ship's coal. Captain Wu, without asking the truth, arrested Chen Ruisheng, who followed the ship to Dinghai, and sent the Yonggu Steamer to Qitou to detain the Jintai Kang ship. Lin had no choice but to appeal to the Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Bureau. After the bureau collected witnesses and learned the truth about the false accusation, it released Chen Ru. As for the two people who represented the Jiangxing Steamer to the case, they were ordered to post bail. The unjust grievance was reversed and praised the worthy senior official.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Solution to Doctor Registration in French Concession <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Municipal Health Bureau to National Medical Association</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the draft regulations for doctor registration in the French Concession, the Shanghai National Medical Association believed that the methods were harsh and exceeded the necessary scope. The association repeatedly sent people to negotiate and requested the party and government organs to verify the matter. The association received a letter from the Municipal Health Bureau yesterday stating that the doctor registration problem in the French Concession had been resolved to a considerable extent. The original letter is summarized as follows: We have investigated the regulations for doctor registration in the French Concession and found that many of them are not appropriate. We have seriously negotiated with the French Concession and have achieved considerable results as follows: (1) Only one license is required, and the fee is two yuan. (2) Doctors and physicians who do not reside or set up clinics in the French Concession and hold official documents from this bureau do not need to register and obtain a license from the French Concession to practice medicine in the French Concession. When this bureau negotiated with the French Concession, it proposed supplementary measures to prevent unqualified doctors from mixing in, that is, each doctor and physician should take a six-inch film of the license they obtained and carry it with them when practicing medicine in the French Concession, which could be inspected by the French Concession inspectors. However, this bureau is deeply afraid that this kind of film is easy to alter, so it uses a small license that is easy to carry. Doctors and physicians who have already obtained a license can bring a two-and-a-half-inch photo of themselves to the bureau to obtain a small license. In addition to the one-dime stamp tax, there is no charge. In the future, qualified doctors and physicians who register in each session can also obtain a small license.

<p>New Chemical Therapy for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Discovered</p>
<p>Koch Discovers the Pathogen of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Dr. Bergell Successfully Develops a Waxing Technique for Tuberculosis Bacteria</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Pathogen of Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Forty-nine years ago, on March 24, 1882, Dr. Robert Koch, the medical saint of Germany, presented a valuable medical paper at the Physiological Society of Berlin, Germany, entitled "The Cause of Pulmonary Tuberculosis." The purpose of the doctor's report was that pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is a special infectious disease and not a genetic disease, and he cited various examples to prove it (such as the culture, staining, and animal experiments of tuberculosis bacteria). Since then, in the history of pulmonary tuberculosis research for the past 3,000 years, a special splendor has been opened, and the pathogen of pulmonary tuberculosis has been identified, and a clear standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis has been obtained.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis bacteria is a microscopic bacteria, and its shape is extremely small. If one gram is weighed, the number is more than 3.5 million. Its reproduction is extremely alarming, destroying the body tissue to form the most terrible tuberculosis symptoms. If this bacteria is discharged from the human body, it cannot reproduce at all, and can only maintain its survival. However, once there is an opportunity to invade the human body, it will occupy the tender lungs as its base camp and display its terrible power. Alas, the greatest enemy of mankind is pulmonary tuberculosis, which is not to be feared.</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Structure of Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the general medical community did not understand the special structure of tuberculosis bacteria, thinking that all bacteria can be reduced by using disinfection agents internally or by injection, such as the injection of Salvarsan for syphilis. After Dr. Bergell's painstaking research, he published that pulmonary tuberculosis has a special defense force that can resist all external drug attacks. The tuberculosis bacteria body is composed of an inner membrane of neutral fat and an outer membrane of acid-fast wax. If it is not possible to destroy the waxy defense line and remove its fatty armor, there is no way to capture the tuberculosis bacteria and put it to death. Moreover, when tuberculosis bacteria invades a local part of the human body, its surroundings are eroded to form a strong nodule to block the passage of blood flow, so that an injected or internally taken disinfectant can not cross the Lei Chi step, just like a specially martial law zone. Since the drug power cannot contact the affected part, even if the whole body is drowned in a drug pool, it cannot hurt the tuberculosis bacteria. Therefore, the only combat strategy to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria must have at least the following two preconditions: (1) Any drug that can destroy the nodules and directly reach the affected part.</p>
<p>(2) It can also strip and dissolve the waxy and fatty inner and outer membranes.</p>
<p>Only in this way can the merit of breaking through the barriers be achieved. Otherwise, it is like scratching an itch through a shoe. The tuberculosis bacteria will secretly laugh at people's inability to harm it under these two guarantees.</p>
<p>The inventor of tuberculosis bacteria, the German medical saint Dr. Koch</p>
<h3 id="e168">Successful Waxing of Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Since Dr. Koch discovered that tuberculosis bacteria is the pathogen of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption), tuberculosis scholars in the East and West have competed to study and want to find a wonderful way to kill this bacteria, but the results have all failed because they do not know the profound theory that tuberculosis bacteria can secrete a waxy substance to surround its body to resist external force invasion. There have been those such as Hamosehali who discovered that using a caustic potash liquid of 5% or less can remove the acid-fast wax of tuberculosis bacteria. Later, Mr. Mo used chlorine gas to remove the acid-fast wax. However, this waxing method can only be applied to the staining method in microscopic examination, because its medicinal properties are extremely toxic and cannot be used for the human body.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been occasional unexpected results in applying chaulmoogra oil to leprosy, because leprosy bacteria and tuberculosis bacteria are acid-fast bacteria of the same nature, and chaulmoogra oil can have a waxing effect and has a sterilizing power more than a hundred times that of carbolic acid. As a result, the general scholars have aroused fanatical attention and tried to apply chaulmoogra oil to patients with tuberculosis in the hope of a result, and various chemical methods have been proposed. The main components of chaulmoogra oil are tested on patients with tuberculosis, and it is also hoped that a considerable effect can be obtained, but it is limited to the skin and superficial tuberculosis that can have a good effect, while the deep-seated organ tuberculosis such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys still cannot have any effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, Dr. Bergell, the great teacher of the world's tuberculosis sufferers, has gone a step further to collect various drugs of animal, plant, and mineral origin and study them painstakingly in the hope of obtaining a waxing effect and a peaceful and non-toxic medicinal property. For decades, he did not know how much brainpower he had exhausted and how much effort he had put into seeking the most reasonable and effective chemical agent. Finally, he discovered that a certain effective component in the compressed juice of the interintestinal mesenteric gland of a special animal has a strong waxing effect on tuberculosis bacteria. Then, he applied this new component to tuberculosis bacteria, and the result was completely dewaxed. Since then, the claim that the acid resistance of tuberculosis bacteria cannot be removed by human work, which was regarded by doctors in the East and West in the past, has been completely overturned. It is a new dawn in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a great question in the medical world throughout the ages.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Chemical Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that site, blocking the flow of blood. Furthermore, the tubercle bacillus secretes an acid-resistant waxy substance that surrounds it, protecting it from the intrusion of external medicinal forces. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they ultimately fail to reach the actual body of the pathogen. The natural therapies, symptomatic treatments, physical therapies, serum therapies, drug therapies, and all other treatments commonly used by medical practitioners in the past have not been completely successful. The saying that there is no cure for pulmonary tuberculosis has persisted throughout the ages because people were unaware of this profound and intricate scientific principle. Consequently, modern tuberculosis researchers, based on the aforementioned scientific theory, have continued to conduct tireless research, and as a result, have successfully developed a chemical agent that eradicates pulmonary tuberculosis bacilli, called SANOSIN. This drug was developed based on the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch of Germany, the discoverer of the pulmonary tuberculosis bacillus, and Dr. Bengel of Germany, the inventor of the dewaxing technique for the pulmonary tuberculosis bacillus. According to experimental reports from various pulmonary disease sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating pulmonary nodules and dissolving waxy substances, while also possessing bactericidal power, enabling a complete cure for stages one, two, and three of pulmonary tuberculosis. It is indeed effective in every case. In China, the Central Hygiene Laboratory of the National Government has tested the drug and confirmed that it is harmless and non-toxic, with absolutely no side effects. A brief summary of its therapeutic effects is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) In experiments conducted in test tubes, the medicinal effects of Sanosin cause the tubercle bacilli to disappear within one minute. After three minutes, the acid resistance is lost, and the pulmonary tubercle bacilli are completely eradicated without exception.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have revealed that Sanosin can penetrate tuberculous foci. Examination of the tubercle bacilli latent within the foci reveals that they have lost their acid resistance, which sufficiently proves the complete dissolution of the waxy substance.</p>
<p>(3) If a patient takes Sanosin internally for about a week, immediate improvements such as sputum dilution and reduction of body temperature will be observed.</p>
<p>(4) Continuing to take Sanosin internally for thirty to sixty days or more will visibly lead to increased body weight, stimulated appetite, and gradual alleviation of all symptoms, ultimately achieving the remarkable effect of restoring health.</p>

<p>Someone Attempted to Visit Them Forcibly</p>
<p>A Dispute Arose on the Train</p>
<p>Lake bandits Xue Wu and Yang Jiaxi, having murdered for money in Dianshan Lake and subsequently raped and sold the victim's wife, were sentenced to death by the local court. In addition to the death sentence, they were sentenced to nine years of imprisonment for the abduction. The death sentence, in accordance with the Law for the Punishment of Bandits, cannot be appealed, while the abduction sentence was appealed and has been approved. Furthermore, Xu Yan, from the Water Patrol Team, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for dereliction of duty, and his assistant was sentenced to three years of imprisonment; both have also filed appeals. Additionally, Zhang Zhaoxiang, the Chief of the Fourth District Detective Team of the Water Police, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for causing death by injury; he has also filed an appeal. Yesterday, the local court, considering that this batch of appellants were all important criminals, dispatched six additional bailiffs to escort the five defendants to the Suzhou Higher Court. Upon arriving at the North Railway Station to board the train in the morning, more than ten people attempted to forcibly visit them on the train. The escorting bailiffs refused, citing impropriety, and were consequently attacked, almost leading to an incident. The bailiffs then blew their whistles, summoning the road police to the train, who dispersed the crowd, taking only two people to the police station for a reprimand before releasing them. The bailiffs, in addition to escorting the criminals to Soochow, left one officer behind to report back to the court for further investigation.</p>

<p>The Murderer Was Only Thirteen Years Old</p>
<p>The Deceased Was Only Eighteen Years Old</p>
<p>Liu Guilin, the thirteen-year-old son of Liu Li, a woman residing at 69 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, was extremely mischievous and violent, frequently engaging in disputes. Dong Dashan, an eighteen-year-old leatherworker from Yangzhou who resided at 7 Hongqing Lane, had a gambling debt of four copper coins to Guilin. At 9:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Liu demanded these four copper coins from Dong, leading to a quarrel. Liu, from an unknown source, produced a bayonet and stabbed Dong violently in the waist, causing a deep wound with profuse bleeding. Dong fell to the ground, and Liu fled in fear of punishment. The patrol officer immediately took the mother and Dong to the Second Precinct of the Fifth District. Dong was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment but died from his injuries at 5:00 a.m. yesterday. Yesterday, the precinct ordered Ji Yi, the local security officer, to closely monitor the situation and report it to the local court for inquest. Yang Qi, the assigned prosecutor, accompanied by the coroner, arrived at the scene to conduct the inquest and prepared the body for burial pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Du Yuesheng, a prominent gentleman of Shanghai and a respected member of the local community, is known for his charitable deeds. During the recent renovation of his ancestral hall, various organizations and entities, including President Chiang of the National Government, presented plaques to celebrate the occasion. Chairman Xu Shiying of the Central Relief Committee, recognizing Du's tireless efforts in soliciting donations for disaster relief in various provinces and his generous contributions to alleviate the suffering of disaster victims, specially commissioned a plaque bearing the inscription "Accumulating Virtue Brings Lasting Blessings." It is said that Mr. Xu personally composed the calligraphy, which is elegant and meticulously crafted. Yesterday, Jin Guanfu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Relief Committee stationed in Shanghai, and Mr. Qi Junqing, along with a military band and a decorative pavilion, represented the committee in delivering the plaque to the Du residence. Mr. Qi also invited the Political Department of the French Concession Police and patrol detectives to provide security along the route. Furthermore, philanthropist Zhu Qinglan presented a plaque inscribed with "Universally Known Benevolent Gate," which was also delivered by Jin and Qi. Mr. Du personally received the gifts with repeated expressions of humility. Observers commented that this honor was a result of Mr. Du's widespread charitable acts.</p>

<p>The Wusong branch of the Chinese Jisheng Society, fearing that the people would suffer from disasters during this time of rampant white-flag calamities, has launched a three-day grand peace prayer ceremony, scheduled from the 5th to the 7th of this month, to invoke divine harmony and avert calamities. An altar will be set up at the society to chant scriptures and perform repentance rituals, aiming to universally benefit both the living and the deceased.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Wusong Charity Organizations Hold Meeting Regarding Floating Corpses <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Send Representatives to Petition the Court</p>
<p>The Wusong Jide Hall is a charitable organization that handles the unidentified floating corpses recovered from the sea and river by the Lifesaving Bureau, as well as corpses found dead on the streets. The hall takes photographs, examines the bodies for any identifying items, and fills out a corpse identification form. If there are any injuries, the local security officer is immediately instructed to report them to the judicial authorities for investigation. If there are no injuries, the hall prepares a coffin, shrouds the body, and transports it to a charitable cemetery, then advertises for relatives to claim the body. This procedure was previously approved by the former Baoshan County government and has been implemented for many years. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, emphasizing the importance of human life, instructed the Seventh District Office of Wusong that all unidentified floating corpses recovered by the Lifesaving Bureau, regardless of whether they have injuries, must be reported to the local court for investigation before being claimed. However, since the implementation of this new procedure, each floating corpse discovered has required the security officer to report to the court and the prosecutor to travel to Wusong for the inquest, which is a cumbersome process, especially considering the distance between Wusong and Shanghai. This delay often causes the corpse to be left unattended for one or two days or more. Recognizing that the hot weather will cause the floating corpses to decompose quickly if left unattended for too long, emitting foul odors and posing a threat to public health, Jide Hall convened a joint temporary meeting of its board of directors, the Lifesaving Bureau, and personnel from the Municipal Affairs Committee Office yesterday at 1:00 p.m. at the Lifesaving Bureau to discuss solutions. It was generally agreed that the lives of the deceased are certainly important, but the health of all residents in the town should also be considered. After extensive discussion, it was decided that Municipal Affairs Committee member Liu Ziwen and Lifesaving Bureau standing director Gu Danchao would draft a summary, and Zhang Qingshi, Yin Zhenfu, Gu Danchao, and Liu Ziwen would be elected as representatives, along with lawyer Yuan Xilian, to visit the local court and the Social Affairs, Public Security, and Health Bureaus at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th to discuss a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>Japan treats the expulsion and prohibition of Chinese laborers as a common practice. Recently, Shanghai residents Wei Xiaopin, Lin Zufeng, Guo Yigui, and Xue Jiachen were all traveling to Japan as kimono merchants. However, upon arriving in Kobe, the Japanese Maritime Police refused to allow them to disembark and forced them back onto the original ship to return to Shanghai. Furthermore, Hua Shicai and Qian Liangkun were two students traveling to Kyoto, Japan, to study, accompanied by a political science university student named Ma. However, upon arriving in Kobe, the Japanese police claimed that Hua and Qian's clothing did not resemble that of students and refused to allow them to disembark, forcing them back onto the Nagasaki Maru to return home. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The travel expenses incurred by all of the above individuals during this time of heightened anti-Chinese sentiment were substantial.</p>

<p>Due to the repeated conflicts that have arisen in Kangzang in recent years, although the Central Government has dispatched personnel to mediate, newspapers have recently reported that Tibetan troops are still attacking Xikang. The Dalai Lama consistently obeys the British, essentially making it a British territory. The National Government, concerned about the border residents, urgently desires to understand the truth in order to respond appropriately and prevent the transfer of the vast Tibetan territory to British hands. Therefore, it has specially appointed National Government official Ms. Liu Manqing as a special envoy to Tibet. After receiving her orders, Ms. Liu showed no hesitation and, without bringing any attendants, bravely entered Tibet alone to convey the Central Government's intentions. A weak woman venturing thousands of miles into remote and barren regions is truly a rare female hero. Therefore, newspapers at home and abroad have reported on her actions. Many gentlemen and women in Shanghai admire Ms. Liu's ambition. It is learned that Ms. Liu will arrive in Shanghai today. Party affairs commissioners Ge Sang Zeren, writer Yang Zhonghua, Jiang Weixin, military strategist Xue Fengxian, radio expert Pan Ruyan, educator Liu Manyun, and a group of more than ten others, specially sent by the Xikang party to bid farewell, will take the opportunity to visit and express concern for the comrades in the border region, investigate cultural enterprises, and visit Shen Xin Times, Great News, Culture, and China pictorials. They plan to stay for about four days and then return to Beijing. On Saturday, she will give a major public lecture in Shanghai about her experiences traveling to Tibet. Her travelogue has been submitted to the Commercial Press for publication.</p>

<p>The World Women's Temperance Union, an organization composed of women's temperance groups from fifty-one countries, is dedicated to prohibiting tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and vice, and promoting international peace. It holds a convention every three years. The previous 13th convention was held in Lausanne, Switzerland. The Chinese representative was the wife of Mr. Zhao Quan, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations. This year's convention is being held at the Toronto Royal Hotel in Canada. Ms. Liu Wang Liming was originally appointed as the Chinese representative, but she was unable to attend due to the domestic temperance society being busy and her family affairs. Therefore, the wife of the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Wu Chaoshu, and Ms. Chen Weikun, the former president of the Shantou Temperance Branch who is currently studying in the United States, have been specially invited as representatives.</p>

<p>The Dong Tangjia Lane Nursery inside the Great South Gate was founded in the 48th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty and has existed for 222 years, making it a pioneer among Shanghai's charitable institutions. Recently, Mr. Huang Xingjie took over its management. Mr. Huang is highly enthusiastic and has made every effort to reorganize the nursery. Yesterday at noon, the nursery held its annual inspection of the children's health and development, inviting officials from charitable organizations and institutions to attend and evaluate the infants' development. Our reporter made a special visit and observed that each child was dressed in new, clean clothing, and all had rosy lips and fair skin and were very plump and lively. Some were asleep in beds, while others were being breastfed by their wet nurses. Each of them was adorable. The wet nurses cared for the infants as if they were their own, with exceptional affection. The nurses all competed to excel in their care. Furthermore, a continuous stream of women from all directions came to observe with babies in their arms. Even the Shanghai infant competition held previously was not as grand as this. Inside the nursery, only laughter was heard, and not a single cry. This demonstrates the excellent results achieved by the nursery in caring for the infants.</p>

Subsequently, the labor union sent letters to various agencies and the company, detailing the reasons for requesting a salary increase and attaching five questions: (1) Regarding the withholding of union dues; (2) Regarding the tire case of driver Zhu Tian; (3) Regarding the demerit of driver Wu Pingji; (4) Regarding the demerit for driver assaulting another person; (5) Regarding Zhu Ahe's bonus. The text was several thousand words long and provided sufficient justification. Yesterday, the company submitted a document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to be forwarded to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau for instructions regarding this matter. Each of the above five points was debated in detail, and a detailed response was given to the workers' request for double pay on racing days, as follows (abridged): Regarding double pay on racing days, although there are many passengers on racing days, it is not a regular occurrence. It is unreasonable to demand double pay. The company's daily income is insufficient to cover expenses. The loss of 20,000 yuan last year is known to the authorities and understood by us. Although business revenue is one to two hundred dollars higher than usual on racing days, this cannot compensate for losses due to rainy weather. During the rainy season in spring, the roads are muddy, and daily losses are no less than two to three hundred dollars. With the school holidays approaching in the summer, the company relies heavily on students for business. During July and August, the daily loss due to the lack of students is at least about two hundred yuan. Furthermore, the cost of gasoline, tires, and machinery are all purchased from abroad, which has been greatly affected by the rising price of gold. In this situation, it is difficult to continue operations. The labor union is ungrateful and often makes unreasonable and embarrassing demands. The company is suffering and has nowhere to complain. Therefore, we have prepared a detailed report and ask that it be forwarded to the Municipal Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters for instructions.</p>

<p>Work Commenced Yesterday</p>
<p>Four Months of Construction Required</p>
<p>The Dachang steamer, which was sunk at the Wusong Mouth after a collision, is obstructing traffic on a major waterway. The Customs Service has decided to salvage the ship to facilitate navigation. The salvage operation has been contracted to the Japanese-owned Katsumura &amp; Co., located at 188 Minhang Road in Shanghai, and officially began yesterday. A temporary office has been built on the coast of Paotaiwan. The director of the Seventh District of Public Security, Zhao, has dispatched several police officers to provide security. Salvaging operations are scheduled from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. daily and are expected to take about four months to complete. The salvage cost is estimated at 180,000 yuan. It is reported that most of the ship will need to be destroyed with explosives, and a temporary notice will be issued to incoming and outgoing vessels to avoid the area.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Rickshaw Dispute in Western Shanghai <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>In the area of Caojiadu, Western Shanghai, near Songqiao and Xinjing, which lies on the boundary between the Chinese and foreign concessions, most of the roads are built by the foreign concession. There are over four hundred rickshaws, all of which are owner-operated and therefore unlicensed. Recently, the Municipal Government has recovered police powers, and the number of rickshaws in the northern and southern parts of the city has increased from 7,400 to 10,000. Last August, the rickshaw drivers in western Shanghai petitioned the Municipal Government for reorganization, but this increase of 2,600 rickshaws has only allocated to Pudong, Wusong, and the northern and southern parts of the city, and the vehicles in western Shanghai were not included in the reorganization. The Municipal Council has also complained about the unlicensed vehicles in that area, causing great panic among the more than two thousand rickshaw pullers in western Shanghai. On the other day, over three hundred of them went to the Municipal Government to petition and elected Peng Yuzhi, Wang Chenglian, Li Zhiliang, and Yu Hainan as representatives to present their petition. An official from the Second Division of the Municipal Government received them and instructed the representatives to lead the people back and await the Municipal Government's reply. Yesterday, the Sixth Precinct Police Station confiscated all unlicensed vehicles. At approximately 9:00 a.m., eight vehicles were confiscated at the north end of Zhongshan Bridge and transported to the Municipal Council by truck. This action agitated all two hundred rickshaw pullers, who blocked the truck and prevented it from leaving. After persuasion by the director of the Sixth Precinct, Ren Luping, to avoid violence and await the Municipal Government's reply, the crowd dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Major Theft at British Woman's Home Solved <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The case of the theft of jewelry worth 15,000 yuan and bank certificates worth 5,000 yuan from the home of British woman Mrs. Magulf on the night of the 25th of last month has been solved by the French Police yesterday. They apprehended a thief who was attempting to sell some of the stolen goods. Because he was caught with the stolen goods, he was arrested. Another person was detained, but this person worked as a dancer and could prove that he was elsewhere when the theft occurred, so he was soon released. It is reported that both men were Caucasians.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Quan Zhaoxin's Wife Returns to Ningbo and Does Not Return <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Quan Zhaoxin, a native of this county, lives in the Shuanggang area north of the Hu Jia Mu Bridge in Hongkou. He is a coppersmith by trade and is currently twenty-one years old. He married Chen Zhou's daughter, Jin Lang, a woman from Meijia Lane near Beishuanggang, through a matchmaker when he was eighteen years old. Jin Lang is twenty-three years old this year. The following year, she gave birth to a son, who died at three months old. In the early days of Jin Lang's marriage, the relationship with her husband was considered harmonious, but recently, she suddenly changed her behavior and frequently returned to Ningbo on various pretexts. This time, on the 4th day of last month (May) (i.e., March 17th of the lunar calendar), she left at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the pretext of returning to Ningbo and has not returned despite repeated attempts to contact her. Quan Zhaoxin, therefore, was anxious and filed a lawsuit with the Mediation Department of the local court to demand the return of his wife, stating that his wife's mother, Chen Zhou, was hiding his daughter and refused to return her. He requested that she be summoned to court and ordered to return his wife, Jin Lang, to him so that they could be reunited. Yesterday, presiding judge Chen Bingxin opened the court and summoned both parties for mediation. Quan Zhaoxin testified to the previous events and stated that he was still able to see Jin Lang at her mother's house when he went to pick her up the first time, but she had not been seen on the second attempt. His mother-in-law only stated that she would send her daughter back after a few days of lingering, but this was repeatedly delayed, and he was never able to see her despite repeated attempts to pick her up. Therefore, he had no choice but to file a lawsuit to demand her return. The opposing party, Chen Zhou, 62 years old, testified that Jin Lang was her daughter and that her daughter had left her husband's home and that she was not responsible. The judge said, "In the end, she is still your daughter. I will give you one month to find and return her, while Quan Zhaoxin will assist in the search." Chen replied, "I have nowhere to search." The judge, finding that mediation had failed, instructed Quan Zhaoxin to file a formal lawsuit separately.</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Son-in-Law Is Rejected and Sues <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Wang Qiutang, a farmer from Chen Village Township, Sanlintang, Pudong, has no sons, only one daughter named Wang Siying, who is 21 years old this year. On February 25th, the 17th year of the Republic of China, he hired Wang Gen'nan through a matchmaker to be his son-in-law. Gen'nan was renamed Junqi and lived peacefully at his home. However, on the 12th day of the first lunar month of last year, Gen'nan's biological father (who lived in Beicai, Pudong) became seriously ill, so he rushed back to his home in Beicai to care for him. After his father recovered, he returned to Wang's house, but was unexpectedly rejected. Feeling aggrieved, he hired Lawyer Yao Wenshou to sue Wang Qiutang in the Mediation Court of the District Court, accusing him of going back on his marriage agreement and requesting that the marriage be maintained. As mediation failed, he formally filed a lawsuit. The defendant, Wang Qiutang, also hired Lawyer Li Yuan to present his defense. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Zhenhai opened the court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Wang Gen'nan, was absent. His representative, Lawyer Yao Wenshou, appeared in court and stated the plaintiff's age and background. He said that the plaintiff, Wang Gen'nan, was 25 years old and a local. The defendant, Wang Qiutang, stated that he was 51 years old, lived in Sanlin Township, and made a living by farming. Wang Siying testified that she was 21 years old and did not want to marry him (the plaintiff) because he was gluttonous and lazy. Judge Zhao said that since the plaintiff was absent today, no debate would be held, and instructed the lawyers of both parties to go out and reconcile. He also scheduled another hearing.</p>

<p>Wang Chenshi Does Not Eat for Three Days</p>
<p>Grandma Sun Demonstrates Admirable Chivalry</p>
<p>Wang Chenshi, a woman from Changzhou, married Wang Songbai at the age of 17. Songbai, however, did not engage in proper employment and found it difficult to make a living. He instructed his wife to work as a female worker in the Gongda Cotton Mill in Shanghai West. All the hard-earned income was spent by Songbai. Recently, Songbai had a wild idea and gave his wife's birth certificate to street rascals, Electric Car Monk, Wang Jiali A'hu, Yu Futao, and others, putting into practice the principle of selling his wife. He had previously booked a room in the Southeast Hotel, planning to trick Wang Chenshi into going to the hotel to be sold for 500 yuan. At the time, these people did not have a single penny on them and took the five yuan that Wang Chenshi had in her pocket. The next day, they changed to the Wujiang Hotel on Sima Road and held her there for three days, denying her food for three days. At this time, Grandma Sun, Wang Chenshi's second landlord, heard about the matter. On May 10th, she went to the hotel to persuade them, but everyone refused.</p>
<p>They Demanded 90 Yuan to Cover the Losses of the Street Rascals for Selling the Body. Grandma Sun, filled with righteous indignation, volunteered to stay at the hotel in place of Wang Chenshi to raise the money. After Wang Chenshi left, she felt unwilling to accept this fate and hired a lawyer to report the matter to the Sima Road Police Station. The police station, together with the Lao Zhou Police Station, went to the Wujiang Hotel and arrested all those involved. After questioning them, they instructed the three parties to file a lawsuit in the Special District Court. Yesterday was the date for the trial, but the defendants failed to appear. The court ordered warrants to be issued for their arrest for a retrial.</p>

<p>A Western woman, Mai Erzhikang, was walking on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession last month when she was hit by a car driven by Xu Daqi, a chauffeur, and injured. The police investigated and recorded the license plate number, and sent the Western woman to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the police summoned both parties to the French Concession Court for investigation. The head of the traffic department first reported the situation and questioned Xu Daqi. Xu Daqi stated that on that day, a civilian's car was driving from west to east when he saw the plaintiff standing at the tram stop and suddenly rushed out, causing the car to be unable to avoid her, resulting in the accident. The plaintiff, represented by Lawyer Tik Burke, claimed that the police had determined that the defendant was driving too fast.</p>

<p>Li Zuoming, a postal worker from Ningbo, was suspended by the post office and, unable to make a living, began collecting packages from shops under the pretext of sending them by mail, forging customs tax receipts and embezzling taxes and postage. After the post office learned of this, they reported it to the police, who arrested Li and his accomplices, Xu Linxiang and Shui Quanxiang, and seized counterfeit seals and receipts. They were sent to the Special District Court for investigation, as reported earlier. Recently, the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case found that Yuxin Stationery Company at No. 133 Jiaotong Road had also used Li to send goods on five occasions, and the five customs tax receipts held were all forged. The money was divided between Li and Zhou Weiming, a 16-year-old apprentice from Qingpu at Yuxin Company. Zhou was arrested and sent to the Special Court for questioning yesterday morning. Zhou confessed that all the goods sent by mail from the company were brought to Li's place by him, and the fees given totaled more than 60 yuan. Li received 20% and he received 80%.

<p>The Hubei Association in Shanghai held a public banquet at the Atlantic Western Restaurant the night before, in honor of the former Hubei Chairman Fang Muren, Xia Douyin, Commander of the Military, and Cai Fuqing, a philanthropist from Hankou, as well as representatives attending the National Assembly. More than 100 people from the political, commercial, industrial, academic, and journalistic circles in Shanghai attended. Gao Jianqing was elected to give a speech, in which he briefly stated that when Chairman Fang was in charge of Hubei's administration, his political reputation was outstanding and obvious to all. He supervised and suppressed the bandits and had almost eliminated them, but his efforts were abandoned when he left for other duties for the country. His colleagues still feel sorry for this. This time, as a representative of Hubei merchants, he attended the National Assembly and suggested revitalizing industry and commerce to open up sources of profit for the country. His vision is admirable to his colleagues. Commander Xia has always been dedicated to suppressing bandits and pacifying the people, and his reputation has spread everywhere he has been. This time, he was appointed as the garrison commander and has fulfilled his duties to the utmost, relying on local stability and tranquility. All Hubei people deeply admire him. However, at present, there are still bandits who have not been completely suppressed, and there are many brigands who want to cut off their roots, relying on security. If the soldiers leave, the bandits will come, which is not without worry. Before the bandits in Hubei Province are completely suppressed, we hope that the authorities will transfer the troops in all defense areas of the province to the authorities so that they will not be transferred to other places, so as to ensure the safety and security of the people. This is what the colleagues earnestly pray for. The representatives attending the meeting have been running around for the country and working hard. Mr. Fuqing and Mr. Sheng Bochang came to Shanghai to participate in the peace prayer, hoping to avoid the catastrophe. This shows their compassion. Although Mr. Liao is old, he still repeatedly supports the Hubei Association in Shanghai. The gentlemen have either contributed to the party and the country or benefited their hometown. This time, they are resting in Shanghai during their public duties. The colleagues have prepared a humble meal to express their admiration. Mr. Fang Benren replied that he was temporarily in charge of Hubei's administration and that his affairs were contrary to his wishes and that he had no achievements. Later, he left Hubei due to an incident, which led to the abandonment of his responsibilities. He was ashamed that Mr. Gao Jianqing, on behalf of you gentlemen, had generously praised him. Fortunately, Commander Xia is guarding Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and the bandits in Hubei Province will not spread. This time, he and Commander Xia returned to Hubei and decided to report to the authorities on their behalf. There will be very good measures to be taken to eliminate them as soon as possible to comfort the elders. The evening ended at 8 o'clock, and everyone dispersed in joy.</p>

His son, Wenliang, 18, was detained by the Fourth District Police Station for questioning.</p>

All temporary expenses were advanced by the initiators and board members, amounting to more than 10,000 yuan, which urgently needs to be raised through special donations to provide relief. It is heard that it has been approved by the Municipal Government to handle it. In recent days, donation booklets have been distributed by board members and members to enthusiastic local people and factories to encourage donations, regardless of the amount, as a voluntary contribution. Merchants and residents there, in view of the importance of fire prevention, are happy to donate, so the number of people who pledge to donate is extremely enthusiastic.

<p>A letter from the Real Estate Department of the Kenye Bank to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association states: "We are writing to inform you that the northern section of Tongzhou Road, Tonghaili, in the Eastern District, which is leased by our department, is rugged and difficult to walk on, and the accumulation of filth hinders sanitation. Several years ago, Yiyuan Company sent a letter to the Engineering Bureau requesting construction, but it was not approved. At that time, there were relatively few residents along the road, and the amount of donations that could be collected was not large, so it was understandable that this was not paid attention to. Now the situation is very different, and the annual income from house rent is already quite considerable. If construction is not carried out for a long time, how can the residents be comforted and the pedestrians benefited? Furthermore, residents there have complained one after another to the lessees of our department, and even threatened to withhold rent as a protest.

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday said that the Yangtze River basin was hot with fog and thunderstorms. Here on the coast, the seasonal wind is from the southeast, and then the north wind is non-directional. The wind in the South China Sea is quite strong, and its direction is from the southeast to the northeast. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 85.8 and the lowest was 60.8. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 86.4 and the lowest was 70.0.</p>

<p>Editor: I read your newspaper's article on the reorganization of the Overseas Chinese Federation in this port. It said that the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent Fang Zizhen, Qiu Wenshao, Chu Nan, and others as reorganizers, who have already arrived in Shanghai. The reporter also asked Mr. Fang and others about the reorganization steps, and they replied that they have not yet formulated any specific measures. It has been found that Mr. Zhen and others are going to various places to conduct affairs and have not accepted any appointment. When a reporter from the Guowen News Agency came to visit, he also told me this. The article is obviously inconsistent with the facts. I hope to correct it immediately. Sincerely, Fang Zizhen, June 26.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Concerning National Culture <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— One Remark</p>
<p>Recently, while reading Hu Yuzhi's Impressions of Moscow (9) in a certain publication, the section on national culture and international culture contained many pertinent points. I have transcribed and supplemented it as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e211">Impressions of Moscow (9) Yu Zhi <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>National Culture and International Culture</p>
<p>I had a casual conversation with Comrade U regarding literature and art, which yielded some new insights.</p>
<p>This is a major paradox: Bolsheviks are thoroughgoing internationalists in their political stance, yet they are also thoroughgoing nationalists in their cultural and artistic stance.</p>
<p>I believe that no government in the world promotes and protects national culture, national languages, and national arts as much as the Soviet government. (Of course, the national culture, national languages, and national arts I am referring to here are not specifically Russian culture, language, and arts. The Soviet Union encompasses dozens of different nationalities, and the Belarussian nationality is only one of them. Treating Soviet nationalism and Russian nationalism as the same thing is the most common, easily made, and most important mistake.) Before the revolution, people within the territory of the Tsar generally only knew of a Russian Empire and a Russian nationality. Only after the October Revolution were other nationalities discovered besides the Russian nationality, such as Ukrainian, Belarusian, Cossack, Georgian, Tatar, Armenian, Tadjiks, Khiegizes, Uzdeks, Tuscimans, Tadshiks, Klimea, Balhkiriens, Jakutions, Komis, Kauakopaken, and countless other strange nationalities that are difficult to enumerate and pronounce. Not only was this large group of nationalities discovered, but also the unique cultures, languages, and literatures of these nationalities. Within the Soviet Union, all languages have the same legal effect as Russian. The station names marked at the many stations I passed through were listed in four, five, seven, or eight languages. The postage stamps, postal postcards, and banknotes issued by the state are printed with various strange characters. The state printing office uses seventy or eighty languages to print textbooks, magazines, newspapers, and literary works, some of which had never been printed on paper during the Tsarist era.</p>
<p>The same is true in literature and art. Russian literature from the latter half of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, such as the works of Turgenev and Chekhov, was greatly influenced by Western European literature in terms of technique and thought, so it was universal. On the contrary, the newly emerging proletarian literature is local, rustic, and intensely nationalistic. The emerging music and dance arts are also filled with the sentiments of various folk songs and folk dances. The greatest source of proletarian literature and art is folk literature and art, so it cannot but be nationalistic.</p>
<p>Take Comrade U as an example. He comes from a proletarian background in the city and embraced Bolshevism at an early age, joining the Red Army. Almost all of the novels he writes use the Red-White War as their subject matter, but he writes them entirely in Tatar, not in Russian. Although he can also write in Russian and his Russian works would reach a larger audience than his Tatar works, he feels that only by using his native language can he faithfully express his feelings. According to Comrade U, in the Soviet Union, those who stand at the forefront of the revolution in politics, society, and thought are the most insistent on protecting national culture and language. For example, the Soviet government has recently advocated changing all the languages used within the Soviet Union to Latin alphabet spelling, but this proposal has not yet been implemented, solely because several important political leaders firmly oppose it. The reason for their opposition is the fear that the form of the language will lose its special national character after adopting the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>This seems theoretically inconsistent. The Bolsheviks, on the one hand, proclaim that proletarians have no fatherland, and on the other hand, they strive to promote and protect national culture. The issue of national culture sparked fierce debates among party theorists several years ago, especially among those in the Commissariat of Education (冀), who strongly opposed promoting national culture. But finally, Stalin's position prevailed. Stalin argued that the ultimate goal of the revolution is to create a world culture to replace all national cultures, but the emergence of world culture must occur many years after the success of the world revolution. In the current transitional stage, the proletarian regime is limited to the borders of the Soviet Union, so creating a world culture is obviously impossible. Moreover, the creation of world culture must occur after all nations have the equal freedom to develop their national characteristics and national cultures. Many of the world's small nationalities are still under imperialist oppression and cannot uniquely develop their national cultures, so the first step must be to liberate and develop national cultures, and only then can world culture emerge. Otherwise, suppressing the growth and development of the cultures and languages of various small nationalities within the Soviet Union would only create the superior position of Russian national culture and language, using Russian culture to unify other national cultures, which would be no different from the assimilation policies of imperialism. Therefore, at this time, we should strive to support the development of the cultures, languages, and arts of various small nationalities. Even after the political and national boundaries are eliminated, national culture will still need to be cultivated and supported for a considerable period of time, because the more fully national culture develops, the richer the quality of world culture will be in the future. Therefore, in terms of cultural vision, Bolsheviks should be nationalistic and liberal.</p>
<p>What I would like to add is that:</p>
<p>Our country's literature and art have been in turmoil since the May Fourth Movement. It was not until June 1, 1930 (民國十九年) that there was an accurate expression of how our country's literature and art should develop in the future. On that day, we had the Declaration of the Nationalistic Literary Movement. Since the publication of that declaration, its influence has certainly been profound, but it must be said that very few people truly understand national literature, national art, and nationalistic literature and art. A year later, Mr. Yuzhi returned from his travels in Europe. This article on national culture and international culture can be said to be an expression of deep sympathy from him and his group for the movement we are advocating. Therefore, it is evident that we should be engaged in the efforts of nationalistic literature and art, and the lasting greatness of nationalistic literature and art.</p>
<p>In our country, the literature on national literature and art must include (1) "Three Words on Art" by Fu Yanchang and Zhu Yingpeng, Fu Yanchang's "Miscellaneous Leaves of the Sixteenth Year", Ye Qiuyuan's "The Nationality and Internationality of Art" and "Collected Essays on Nationalistic Literature and Art", etc. Fu Yanchang can be said to be the pioneer of promoting national literature and national art in our country.</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e212">The Final Moments of Two Poets <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Cai</p>
<p>— Byron and Shelley</p>
<p>Byron had a very passionate sympathy for the Greeks who were resisting Turkish tyranny and seeking independence. Therefore, in July 1823, he boarded the Hercules and set off for the East to actually participate in the Greek army and provide some assistance.</p>
<p>Accompanying him were Count Gamba and Trelawny, as well as the Italian physician, Dr. Francesco. The ship carried two cannons, five horses, a quantity of ammunition, and 50,000 Spanish gold coins, all to help the war of independence.</p>
<p>Byron's heart was truly burning with love for Greece. They arrived in Missolonghi in January of the following year, where the inhabitants greeted them with cheers. The army fired a salute, and Governor-General Mavrocordatos came out to welcome them in person. Byron, dressed in a red military uniform, looked like a world-class hero being celebrated by everyone. After joining the army, Byron was no longer a poet wielding a pen but a general wielding a sword.</p>
<p>Later, he was appointed governor. When attacking Lepanto, his commanding presence was awe-inspiring. Who would have known that he was a poet who should have been refined and gentle? At that time, his passion was also ignited by the bravery of the Greek army defending their homeland, so he appeared even more magnificent and great.</p>
<p>At that time, it almost completely eliminated the sentimental, easily angered, and easily sighed poet of the past, and instead showed the demeanor of a respectable military commander with self-control.</p>
<p>In the past, Byron was willing to use his own money to help any friend, and now he was also willing to provide his income to the Greek army. Therefore, the Greeks admired and loved him even more. Everyone understood that he was indeed sincerely helping Greece's independence.</p>
<p>One day, when the military operations were nearing their end, he and Gamba rode on horseback to the coast for a walk, and despite the rain, they went boating at sea. The following month, he also went for a walk in the woods in the rain.</p>
<p>In the end, his grand ambitions did not succeed, and at the same time, he was afflicted by illness, so he could no longer stand.</p>
<p>While he was groaning with fever, all the poets, including Dr. Francesco, took care of him day and night, silently praying for the feverish poet to recover. While feverish, he often shouted, "Forward, forward!" Later, he also said:</p>
<p>"Although I have sacrificed my time, health, and possessions, and now my body is in such a state, Greece, Greece, what will you ultimately achieve?"</p>
<p>These were his last words on April 19, 1824, as he was dying. He was only thirty-seven years old.</p>
<p>After the news of Byron's death spread, the entire Greek territory was completely enveloped in grief and sorrow. At that time, thirty-seven cannon shots, the same number as his age, were fired in mourning.</p>
<p>Six years after his death, Greece successfully achieved independence, finally fulfilling his last wish.</p>
<p>Later, to repay this meritorious figure who helped with independence, Greece built a statue of the heroic and talented poet holding his beloved dog in Hyde Park in England as a permanent memorial.</p>
<p>On July 8, 1822, Shelley returned from visiting his old friend Haydon and boarded the Don Juan, a boat he had built with Byron, from Spezia Bay. The pure white sails of the boat shining on the sea waves were even more beautiful than words could describe.</p>
<p>His friend Trelawny was on another boat and saw the Don Juan carrying Shelley, floating lightly on the sea waves.</p>
<p>It was a very hot and sultry day, so soon a big storm arose on the sea. The sound of the waves roared, the wind was very urgent, and a whirlpool formed. The Don Juan carrying Shelley disappeared in this storm.</p>
<p>Of course, Trelawny, on the deck where he had safely taken refuge, thought of his friend who had gone far away and did not know where he was going. He did not care that the waves were crashing at his feet and the rain had soaked his whole body. He could only shout:</p>
<p>"Shelley, what happened to Shelley!"</p>
<p>Although the storm stopped silently not long after, and Spezia Bay regained its original calm and beautiful southern sea color, the Don Juan was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Trelawny told the news to Hunt and Byron. Byron was so shocked that he could not speak, and his lips trembled with pallor.</p>
<p>Although the friends searched all over the coast, they could not find any wreckage of the Don Juan or Shelley's body. It was not until July 18 that Shelley's body was found on the coast of Viareggio. The body's coat still contained collections of poems by Aeschylus and Keats. The collection of Keats' poems was still open.</p>
<p>On August 6, Byron, Hunt, and Trelawny cremated Shelley's remains in mourning and sadness, and the ashes were buried in Rome.</p>
<p>He, like Byron, was called a genius poet of a generation. His life was seven years shorter than Byron's, and he was only thirty years old.</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Most Glorious Page of the Emden (Continued) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Falling into the Water</p>
<p>Shells were still exploding everywhere. The vibration from our own cannons caused many people to fall into the water. I dragged a friend out of the water three times, but the fourth time he fell into the water and drowned before I could notice. I myself fell out of the ship and grabbed a rope from the mast to avoid falling into the water. But now the ship was sinking and I was almost meeting the water.</p>
<p>Later, I lost consciousness. I did not wake up until I was shaken by the sound of shelling. I was lying in front of the command tower. The Sydney came to attack again for half a day because we did not agree to surrender and continued to fire at our ship. I saw Captain von Müller order the survivors to hide behind the armored tower, but he himself stood in front, his tall figure clearly visible above the waterline, directly facing the Sydney's guns. I really did not understand that he was determined to share the fate of most of his men, but strangely, the flying shells killed and injured the people around him, but they did not touch him at all. Fate did not allow him to die with his men and ship.</p>
<p>Flames and Waves</p>
<p>By the next day, the waves were exceptionally turbulent and the situation on the ship was getting worse. The entire ship was still on fire. Huge seagulls were attacking us from time to time. There was no fresh water on the ship and the injured people were in terrible condition. Therefore, I decided to jump off the ship and transport the injured to the island. I was granted permission by Captain von Müller. I will especially never forget him looking at me, hoping that I would succeed.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Colonel Weidtfeld, everything was handled very carefully. A long rope was tied around my waist and I was told to take it to the island. Holding a large knife in one hand to defend against the sharks, I jumped towards the crest of a giant wave. A vortex, its center below the bow of the ship, pulled me under the keel of the Emden. When the speed of the whirlpool decreased slightly, I saw that the whirlpool was at least ten feet in diameter. In addition, I saw the Emden sandwiched between two coral reefs, which extended from the shore like fingers. This, of course, was the reason for the giant whirlpool.</p>
<p>I was not alone. Opposite me, just like me, without help, there was a large shark rolled in the vortex, its white belly facing me. Then, for a moment, there was movement. The seawater slowly rose and filled the bottom of the vortex. I heard a loud cracking sound and the bottom of the vortex was filled with strange green light. The waves all converged into it. Suddenly, a force lifted the water from the vortex like a giant fountain, throwing me straight up. The keel of the Emden passed before my eyes like a red line. In that instant, I felt like I had lost weight. I saw the big shark go across the bow of the ship. Now I felt like there was a turning point.</p>
<p>When I regained consciousness for the first time, I found myself in turbulent waves, far away from the Emden and about two hundred yards from the beach. I swam towards the beach, but strangely, every time I swam, a giant wave came. I was not hit on the surface of the wave, but was hit on the bottom of the water. The rope around my body was wrapped around the reef. I was tethered like a buoy. Finally, the rope broke and I was driven by the waves without the power to resist. I tried several times without success and gave up.</p>
<p>I sank into the water two or three times, each time very safely. I saw the azure sky, the white sandy beach, and the palm trees on the shore gently swaying in the breeze. I felt incredibly happy in my heart. In an instant, I was lifted into the air again, riding the broken waves and thrown onto the beach. I regained my life.</p>
<p>Sometimes I dare not call this unexpected encounter fortunate. I just wanted to rest peacefully for a while, but God was playing tricks on me again. My explanation is this: like a rat submerged in water, I convulsed and stretched out my legs. My right foot touched a rock and was washed back into the water.</p>
<p>Iron Cross Award</p>
<p>For the above experience, I received the Iron Cross First Class. Later, many of my friends told me that at that time, they thought my life was not worth a penny on the deck. Later, my companions all gathered together and headed towards the beach using empty ammunition boxes. The condition of the injured was very miserable. People without arms or legs were rolled by the waves and lay on the beach. Those without help cried out for thirst, unable to get water. Finally, they drank a mouthful of seawater to quench their thirst like crazy. Even those of us who could walk could not think of a way to stop them from drinking seawater. Therefore, the ship's assistant medical officer actually drank seawater to quench his thirst and lost his life.</p>
<p>The second problem was transporting the injured, because it was very dangerous for us to be naked under the scorching sun. The few of us who were still able to move carried the injured to the shade of trees and rocks to rest.</p>
<p>Nearby was a coconut tree full of coconuts. We spent half an hour climbing up forty feet. Later, I finally reached the top of the tree and threw down fifty or sixty coconuts to the ground. Fortunately, I left four for myself, because my companions ate all the coconuts that were thrown down without thinking. I gave the few I had left to the weak and those who could not get to the bottom of the tree to eat together.</p>
<p>Thirsty Madness</p>
<p>Because I was unbearable with thirst, I started having hallucinations, showing a glass of beer, cool and delicious, with foam floating around the glass. But this elusive glass often evaded me. I chased desperately until I fell to the ground and lost consciousness. I also dreamed in my head that many companions were cursing at the water tanks on the ship.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I saw small bugs crawling on my skin, biting me very painfully, and long thorns being dragged out of my skin. A wild bird stopped beside us, using its sharp hooked beak to tear the muscles of the helpless injured. Both afraid and angry, I used my strength to kill dozens of them. From then on, we felt that there must be two guards to drive away the wild birds to prevent them from harming the injured.</p>
<p>I walked back and forth in the bushes, preparing to look for something to eat. Suddenly, I saw a large seabird about to lay eggs, all white, flying in the air with a wingspan of six feet long. It left a large egg on the white sand. I took the egg in my hand and the huge bird kept calling. Surprised, I put the egg back in its original place. I saw an extraordinary thing in nature. A small pointed beak broke out of the shell and divided the eggshell into two halves. There was a blue bird on the beach, calling to its mother miserably. I looked and thought, I am a city child and have never seen such a thing. The old bird hovering above my head flew down calmly in a moment and clamped the little bird, stretching out its wings to protect the little bird from the sunlight. Finally, she squatted on top of the nest, looking directly at me.</p>
