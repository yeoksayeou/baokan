<h3>中美革命潮</h3>
<p>南美之革命旣依次相及今己推而至於中美矣尼加拉圭之亂事方己而宏都拉斯國又起革命之内戰何今日美洲之多事也雖然今日經濟不調之影響幾及於全世界因而國内起不安定之恐慌者各國皆有不過經濟富裕之國政治得宜雖有政爭不致内亂耳不觀乎南歐西班牙與葡萄牙之革會潮流乎雖一則革命者成功而王室失敗一則革命者失敗而政府制勝然其蠢蠢欲動之象固彼此如一也</p>
<p>當二十年前世界革命潮流未盛之時開其機者實爲中美之墨西哥與亞洲之中國兩國自革命之後内戰之事時有所聞世人多非笑之以爲兩國之内爭永無寗息之日也自後歐戰旣起而俄德士之革命隨之至近今之間南美各國又一一革命今又延而至於中美歐洲西葡亦受此潮可知民心一動時不能遽息於今中墨二國漸歸鞏固而安定而世人之視革命反數見不我鮮而不以爲異人類心理之變化誠不可思議也</p>

<h3>日本兒童敎育之橷趨勢</h3>
<p>— 胡叔異</p>
<p>日本敎育年來進步至爲神速尤以基本的兒童敎育變化更我所謂學園也者即日本最近之試騐學校其所設施皆根據世界新敎育之主張而一般素負日本新敎育中心之各附屬小學仍本其研究興趣每特立訌騐部以實地試騐新敎育之主張與理論作者在日考察敎育時用客觀的眼光及根據該國歷史上的敎育主張歸納日本兒童敎育之新趨勢有下列二點（一）健康敎育（二）作業敎育</p>
<p>兹先述日本小學校健康敎育之實施最可驚人者即無論巿内外各小學或幼稚園均有特定之運動時間與指導員及醫藥衛生上之各種考備對於小學或幼稚園兒童之健康問題有詳密的紀錄一校有一校之運動成績及健康紀錄統計一巿或一縣有一巿一縣之運動成績及健康紀錄之統計如在任何一校詢問任何兒童的健康情形其校長即可出示該兒童之健康紀錄一覽了然向一巿或一縣之敎育行政官廳詢問其全巿或全縣之小學兒童體格情形彼等可立即出示其全巿或全縣之最近統計表自三歲以上各年齡之男女兒童身長與體重情形歷歴可數曾訪東京巿敎育局敎育科長知其全巿學校衞生設施情形兹擇要述之如下</p>
<p>（甲）健康敎育方面</p>
<p>檢查身體檢查身體行於就學前之兒童及就學中之兒童及各學校幼稚園之敎職員對於新就學之兒童每年自一月亘三月施行一次乃至三次對於有疾病之兒童通告其父兄於人學前治療對於有傳染病之兒童及不能就學兒童得予以遲缓入學及免除入學之辦法對於就學中之兒童生徒每年五月施行嚴密之定期身體檢查對於學校衞生非常注意對於職員之身體檢查亦以嚴格行之其有疾病者充分治療之</p>
<p>涵養學校衞生思想期學校衛生之向上及完全從事衛生思想之涵養及啟發開設講演會講習會等</p>
<p>關於學校衞生之調查便於學校衛生施行上之參考行兒童之疲勞調查敎室内氣檢查兒童之健康狀態調查兒童之發育狀態調查關於虚弱兒童養護之調查兒童疾病及死亡之調查</p>
<p>夏令之健康設施生活於喧擾與塵埃中之都巿兒童親自然之機會極少其結果有精神上身體上缺陷者甚多昭和三年度東京巿小學校謀救濟之策開設林間學校二十二年海濱學校五十五所參加之兒童有九千九百零五名之多云</p>
<p>（乙）作業敎育方面</p>
<p>作業敎育的語源作業敎育一名詞係德語ＡrteitsPadagogik或譯爲勤勞敎育或譯爲勞作敎育德國之凱興斯泰納敎授爲提倡作業敎育之巨子己爲世所公認德國之敎育界莫不受其影響焉</p>
<p>作業敎育的原理作業敎育之思想以兒童活動爲主體不以被動態度爲滿足所謂活動性者即對於任何時間任何情形任何物件常指示積極的狀態是也今者敎育之對象爲兒童常宜刺激其活動衝動此種衝動自精神現衆之發逹從而逹於辦事的活動此即作業敎育之基本原理凡健全發育之兒童實有旺盛活動衝動之點敎育上不可漠視此種事實漠視此種事實實爲過去之敎育過去之敎育思想以兒童爲容受器容受知識與容受敎訓作業敎育則一反此種思想而使兒童從事活動</p>
<p>作業敎育的實際東京女高師附屬小學校第三部自大正九年度起開始從事新敎育之實騐對於作業敎育作下列之研究（一）以有文化價值之中心爲基礎作業（二）各項作業須全體兒童之參加此項作業適應兒童之興味與能力（三）可以勞動筋骨之作業（四）可以造成創作的發表的工作（五）所有結果由自己訂正（六）養成研究的空氣甲養成研究態度乙指導研究方法</p>
<p>作業上之注意點（一）立作業之目的而定計劃指導其計劃實行上之方法其計劃可書於紙片練習簿或黑板上即計劃之客觀化是也（二）作業之指導事項有甲兒童所能言之事乙體騐情意之事丙反省如何得知識丁認識如何能力戊批判作業之全體即作業之計劃實行力等缺點及優點加以考慮（三）每日一時間爲純粹個人作業（四）敎師於必要時得與兒童共同活動（五）敎師不絶監督全體之作業（六）立於指導者立塲凡認爲兒童之優點當扶助其勞動（七）明瞭作業之範圍何者爲精神作業何者爲肉筋作業</p>
<p>敎師所宜注意之事（一）從事研究兒童所常受社會的自然的印象（二）以銳敏眼光常接近社會的變化自然現象之變化（三）敎師宜對於社會的變化自然的推移接近而觀其反應（四）兒童之對於社會及自然之變化有何不良順應宜從事矯正（五）以男女兩性共同活動爲本則</p>
<p>特設作業時間在小學校之時間分配中如何各時間之課業行作業化可加以研究大正十五年度起將午後之時間定爲全部作業之時間其實施辦法如下（一）午前與午後之時間分爲兩部分（二）午前主爲精神作業午後主爲筋肉作業（三）午後之作業係五年以下兒童從事社會的活動須自學科爲中心發揮其個性（四）午後作業時間之敎師態度甲·在担任課程以外之作業而發見兒童之個性乙·謀個性活動社會活動之調和（五）各年作業之分配甲·低學年行自由作業乙·三四年級爲學習之作業化每週由兒童記入學習片而受敎師之閱覽丙·五年級與三四年級同丁·六年級在敎科内容中附加實習的作業（六）定滴當時間受學科担任敎師之指導（七）每月開作業展覺會一次以資鼓勵　　共同作業與自治制度昭和二年度以前各學級設學級自治委員二名學枃自治委員二名學級自治委員指揮學級之自治活動學校自治委員自全校各學級選出而共同組織學校自治會由敎師中之訓練委員從事指導指揮學校内之自治活動至自治會之職員如下</p>
<p>計劃系二名爲學級自治會之議長爲學校自治會之職員</p>
<p>清潔系二名注意學級内之衞生事項</p>
<p>整頓系二名注意敎室内之整頓</p>

<h3>西湖泉話</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>西湖山水甲於中國其間名泉尤多芬芳甘冽人爭就之偶憶今春所見頗有足述者不憚詞費分誌如次</p>
<p>▲虎跑泉　泉在虎跑禪寺内範石爲池蓄水半之清冷甘美爲湖上各泉冠最奇者該泉水質密度較高寺僧爲娛客計特於池之四隅各沉一孟客以銅元準孟而投然結果往往飄入孟側蓋水質旣密銅元不易直下也春間游人如　該寺每日得自泉中之銅元爲數當亦匪微大池之左别闢一小池以器覆之並大書曰「内係飲料勿擲銅元」全寺所飲皆賴此也予游該寺時女子數人方掬泉而飲詢其所以謂能明目云</p>
<p>▲珍珠泉　出玉泉魚樂國自側門即至珍珠泉珍珠泉者非終年泉水上湧密如聯珠也游各初至每以空無所見失望而返實則該泉之珠須少藉人力始成巨觀予抵該泉時見一客立池畔方以兩足上下跳躍狀如癲狂少頃泉果大湧而四週水珠上升纍纍不絶燦爛玲瓏幻爲奇景予佇足不忍去者久之始悟向之游者殆多未識其奥焉</p>
<p>▲冷泉　冷位住於飛來峯下流水鱗鱗琤琤作響湖上諸泉此爲最巨惟命名曰「冷」誠予吾人以不解之惑蓋除温泉而外天下之泉莫不冷也獨此泉以冷稱抑何故哉或謂是泉摩崖穿石而出其冷度較高顧以手入之初未見其清凉澈骨也</p>
<p>▲韜光泉　自靈隱拾級而上即爲至韜光之山道道旁泉聲潺潺顧遍覓不見其處嗣諦視之始見沿山而下皆有竹管泉皆由管而逹於山麓者西湖諸泉殆以此爲最饒奇趣矣</p>
<p>▲玉泉　玉泉以巨魚著聞湖上其泉發源甚遠伏流數十里至此始見泉極清凈惟以游人投餌哺魚水面常罩油汚該寺僧人每日必加清理非然者積之旬日魚亦隱不可見矣</p>
<h3>爲壇弟子說法</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>吾邑廢曆元宵節城中印姓有槓飯籬姑娘者乃得邀其家主之降臨於是傳者故玄妙其說閨人之韻事遂變而爲士夫拜服唯一之信條蓋某會適居印姓之對門爲商業界走集之中心聲氣</p>
<p>所通響應最速而所謂扶鸞之術某會之房主亦緣是而設嫻於斯道者固優爲之不知者輙不解所以而神之權威竟與日俱增計自設壇以來己經月餘臨壇者某也某也無慮十數其來歷亦靡不言之娓娓而問休咎卜吉凶者如某局長某科長日蹤趾相錯於門非至夜分不散噫亦可怪己</p>
<p>余非不信者流特信之過深故不肯以人世間塵俗之事試其騐否而欲以不可思議之神秘測其究竟考「乩」說文云「卜以問疑也」通典曰「西國用羊卜卜師謂之斯乩」餘無可證而鬼之有無愈難論定外人有發明鬼學之理亦憑虚無實之空談不足爲據近頃科學家一歸於人類之腦力而以心靈兩字名之其說稍進己當一千八百八十二年英倫己有心靈研究會之設以科學方法探索其神秘之現象勃萊德士且爲研究此學之著名人物其所創獲尤富十餘年前曾載之於現代雜誌中惜今己不復能記矣</p>
<p>余謂今欲解决此問題當闢去禍福之見而以學者之態度冥心摉討則庶幾得其幽趣如心理學家有感應之說道德家有超越之覺悟神話時代妖怪與鬼物之區别今盛行之催眼術有何關係巫覡降鬼時之現象甚至古今來與神鬼媾通之史蹟苟能從此研究較之焚香膜拜徒求諸冥冥以利害得失相默禱者必多興味如心理感應日常所遇之例證每或忽之而不知具有實際或謂之「以心傳心」又如超越之覺悟佛家號爲「通天眼」日人逕譯之曰「千里眼」皆研究心靈學者所不可不辨須知自然界中現實之體樊然淆列而人之智識有限固天由一一得其眞諦之所在然如空氣與以太之波動Ｘ光綫之發現昔人謂智力所不能闚目力所不能及者今則可以用照片攝出之可以藉弗光顯著之故醉心於此中者分其公務之餘暇而考其神秘之由來則其成功必能袪疑破惑而有裨於社會亦豈細事哉</p>

<h3>情急</h3>
<p>— 先知</p>
<p>我們此後的生涯是「吃粉灰」的生涯可是對於這種生涯却不是一件輕而易舉的事這是嘗試的和有經騐的告訴我們的所以我們不得不把我們生涯的工具加緊努力去培植同抱這種概念的我們對於那無知的黑板怎樣不爲我們蹂躪摧殘－黑板上的粉筆字句塗得密密層層微露牠的膚肉有時把牠漆黑的衣服頓時更易漂白似的雪衣視力薄弱的同學或許疑爲换了水白板的模樣</p>
<p>那天我剛踏進敎室那光顧黑板的全級同學都不在牠旁邊胡亂的亂塗亂擦只見那黑板中間顯露牠眞相的一處襯現着幾行詩句寫道</p>
<p>錄李白五言新體詩一首</p>
<p>請人吃夜飯</p>
<p>伴客跳舞場</p>
<p>身任訓育責</p>
<p>運動選舉人</p>
<p>物醜其尤極</p>
<p>Ｘ賊豈可容</p>
<p>密訣－運動選舉－醜殺</p>
<p>這幾行詩糊糊朦朦映入眼簾我那一顆脆弱的心靈猶豫猜疑畢竟丈二和尙摸不着頭腦可是一般同學嘻嘻哈哈的對着這首新詩好像猜中了譏諷着誰而得意似的我想問那位嘻笑的旁席同學可恨那上課的鈴聲很緊張的報警上課同時那位同學出去了</p>
<p>鈴響後五分鐘敎師不來授課學生可自由散課這是我校因循上課的規程時間容易大好的光隂死了四分多鐘那平時素負我們表率而不誤時的訓育主任的蹤影尙没有到臨無機敬聆他Ｘ義的學問因此一般愛光隂的同學說「遲上一分鐘全班便要犧牲一課現在將近五分鐘我們整個的損失了五課的敎益試問每天平均有七課那末今日的課程一己向七分之五的死路上葬去好不可嘆有的不滿意他的敎授的說「他旣不能對於黨義深切的了解又操難聽的江北語所以講起來非特没精打彩毫無系統的話并且聽了要令人作三日嘔倒不如希望他不要來罷」有的提議散課這樣一來同學們向外跑掉有的坐在桌子期待的期待有的開坐竊竊耳語的耳語有的談得意揚而拍手的拍手異常熱閙須臾那己向外走心想逃課幾位的同學止其進程而爭先恐後絡繹不絶的還向敎室一時皮鞋底觸在樓板「習個習個」和唇齒相發的「來了來了」相和酬答敎室裏的喧擾雜童漸漸沉靜了</p>
<p>不久果然他－某主任帶着勉强的笑容和灰白的臉兒很快的走進敎室我們個個站起來彎着九十度的腰恭恭的向他致禮可是他微微的點了頭就開始點名了</p>
<p>「你們黑板上不應該胡書亂塗……」某主任帶着不滿意的對我們說</p>
<p>「這樣的胡書亂寫是培植我們後日生涯的唯一條件你忘掉我們的求學本意嗎」章君無意的爭理與論</p>
<p>「啞這幾行新詩你寫的嗎」主任沉臉向章君詰問</p>
<p>「不不我不知道」</p>
<p>「你還說不知道快說出…」</p>
<p>「你還不認咎無恥醜類我平日對於諸位是很佩服并且許替你們之動到中央大學去高造對於你們可謂仁至義盡你這害羣之馬請出去不准再上我的課」</p>
<p>「你眞錯了大錯而特錯了你要我出去也好留在此地也好任憑你的權威罷不過我是弱者希望不要凌弱」</p>
<p>「你眞蠻極了倒說我凌弱滾出去滾出去」</p>
<p>這時主任正在咬牙切齒聲勢洶洶地向章君示威的當兒站立一個含有滑稽口氣的仇君說「不要錯認人家冤枉弱者這首新詩有什麽關係偏要追求現在直言告你撰者是唐時詩仙李太白書者是近時偷生小子」</p>
<p>「有什麽用意請說出他仍執拗的向仇君反問</p>
<p>「没有什麽用意要究命意請問詩仙罷」仇君笑嘻嘻的對答</p>
<p>那時有幾個愛好光隂的書凱子實在不能再緘默下去萬君冒險果敢的說</p>
<p>「這個問題或許是個人的問題不應放在我們正課時間裏討論請勿再虚辨靡費我們的一去不復返的光隂請注意」</p>
<p>這種請求在客觀的眼光看來當然應有的反應可是這首新詩的嗤笑的確剌戟得主任十二萬分的難忍如何如好把這種剌剌戟變爲隱默怎樣不使主任怒恨恨的說「你頑皮眞夠了請說出命意……」</p>
<p>「你可體會不然請問詩仙罷」</p>
<p>「頑皮不可敎誨的蠻子快出去………」</p>
<p>「如果要我說出的話是很難爲情的尤其是衆人知道所以我不說了」</p>
<p>那麽一來他－某主任立刻耳紅毛聳鐵板板的腮頰蒼白間無血色的臉兒戰慄般的免强說「有什麽難爲情總要你說出理由否則請校長除名後悔莫及」</p>
<p>「爲公義而犧牲那也不打緊不過……」</p>
<p>「擾亂課堂藐視師長……」他只說了這幾话嗚嗚咽咽的退出敎室了</p>
<p>「塗黑板的事使他恨恨以去難道</p>

<h3>The Huai River Conservancy Commission Carefully Examines the Huai River Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>Zhuang and Xu Depart Today for Inspection</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhuang Songfu, Vice Chairman of the Huai River Conservancy Commission, along with Committee Member Xu Shiying, are scheduled to depart on the 21st to inspect the water conservancy projects in the lower reaches of the Huai River around Hongze Lake. It is reported that the accompanying personnel include Wang Huzhen and Lin Pingyi from the Engineering Department, and Yan Kangcheng from the Secretariat, among others. They are expected to return to Nanjing in about ten days. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original plan of the Huai River Conservancy Commission was to build a reservoir at Hongze Lake to control the upper reaches' entry into the sea. However, the water level of Hongze Lake would increase after the construction of the reservoir, which would cause flooding in twenty counties in northern Anhui and also in northern Jiangsu. For the sake of prudence, the commission will conduct a more detailed reconnaissance to ensure a foolproof plan. Currently, over seven million yuan from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund has been earmarked for special storage. From this year until 1946, there will be 21 million yuan available for expenditure. It is estimated that after the Huai River is managed, over six million mu of arable land will be added in the Hongze River area, increasing annual income by 27 million yuan. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhuang Songfu talked about the steps for managing the Huai River. Construction should be carried out according to financial resources and from a practical standpoint. Do as much as you can with the available financial resources, and seek benefits without prioritizing harm. Water conservancy accounts for one-third of the total Boxer Indemnity Fund allocation. Based on the current gold price, the Huai River management portion is estimated to be around 30 million yuan. Even if the goal of reaching the sea cannot be achieved with the full amount, diverting water into the Yangtze River should be possible. The dredging of tributaries can be handled by the Jiangsu Provincial Government through labor levies. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[P＞The Ministry of Railways Plans the Western Section of the Longhai Railway Project</p>

The funds will be obtained by issuing public bonds from the Russian Boxer Indemnity Fund. The procedures for issuing the bonds are currently being discussed with the Ministry of Finance.

<h3>The Extension of the Three Companies' Submarine Cable Landing Rights</h3>

<h3>Zhu Peide Advocates Expanding Party Headquarters in Various Divisions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Peide telegraphed Chiang, saying that Qin provinces are experiencing extraordinarily severe natural disasters, and the lives of the people are becoming increasingly difficult. The Red Bandits are taking the opportunity to spread fallacies. The work of the party headquarters in various places is lax, which is extremely worrying. He earnestly requests that the special party headquarters in each division be expanded and that personnel be selected by the central government to be sent to work in the divisions to assist in bandit suppression and propaganda in order to achieve results. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Overview of the Central Bank: Assets Exceed 200 Million This Year</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Song said on the 20th, regarding the Central Bank's overview, that the Central Bank was founded by the late President Sun Yat-sen in 1924. At that time, it not only lacked capital, but even the funds for printing banknotes were borrowed. The late President still thought about the Central Bank when he was ill. In 1927, a preparatory office was established at the old site of the Shanghai Daosheng Bank. In 1928, the government raised 200,000 yuan and officially opened in November. In Shanghai, various banks refused to accept Central Bank notes. It was only after depositing 50,000 yuan with each bank that this stopped. The total assets were 47 million in 1928, 87 million at the end of 1929, and had reached 124 million at the end of 1930. In March of this year, it had exceeded 200 million. The number of banknotes in circulation was 12 million in 1928, 15 million in 1929, and 22 million in 1930. In March of this year, it exceeded 30 million. This is purely due to the expansion of government power and the increase in the bank's credit. In addition to ordinary business, all government banking affairs are handled by the Central Bank. Therefore, both customs and salt taxes are handled by the Central Bank. Most of the bank's directors and supervisors are selected from leaders in the banking and financial sectors. The president and vice president are appointed by the government. This shows that the bank's policy is not purely for the benefit of the government, but also to plan for the development of the national economy. Throughout the years of military service, the bank's loans to the government have never exceeded the quota. Therefore, its reputation has grown stronger with military success. If the country can maintain a peaceful situation, its assets can increase to 200 million within five years, he said. (Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shao Yuanchong Discusses Special Regulations for Money Shops</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Yuanchong said that after the Banking Law is enacted, money shops have requested that separate regulations be enacted. It seems reasonable for the money shops themselves to hold this view. The initial development of money shops was like the old private letter offices, which gradually evolved into post offices. Its business is developing daily. It is predicted that when the banking business reaches a certain point, the organization of money shops will naturally be difficult to apply. The industry operates as a limited liability company with the nature of a bank, specializing in mortgage lending, while the shareholders of money shops bear unlimited liability. The term "double use" has no standard, and it is difficult to guarantee that no danger will occur. The industry has submitted a request for separate regulations. This matter requires considerable consideration, and the government is still unable to make a decision. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Revolutionary Tide in Central and South America</h3>
<p>The revolutions in South America have successively spread and now extend to Central America. The unrest in Nicaragua is ongoing, and now a revolutionary civil war has broken out in Honduras. Why are the Americas so troubled today? Although the impact of today's economic turmoil is felt almost worldwide, causing domestic panic and instability in various countries, countries with economic prosperity and sound politics, even if there are political disputes, will not lead to civil unrest. Consider the revolutionary trends in Spain and Portugal in Southern Europe. Although in one case the revolutionaries succeeded and the royal family failed, and in the other case the revolutionaries failed and the government prevailed, their underlying restless nature is the same.</p>
<p>When the global revolutionary tide was not yet strong twenty years ago, its sparks were ignited by Mexico in Central America and China in Asia. Since the revolutions, news of civil war has been frequently heard in both countries. People often ridiculed them, thinking that the internal strife in these two countries would never end. Since then, the European War broke out, followed by revolutions in Russia, Germany and other countries. Recently, countries in South America have also experienced revolutions one after another, and now they have spread to Central America. Even Spain and Portugal in Europe are affected by this tide. It can be seen that once the people's minds are stirred, they cannot be easily calmed. Today, China and Mexico are gradually becoming consolidated and stable, and people view revolutions without surprise and without considering them strange. The changes in human psychology are truly unfathomable.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Honduran Capital, 19th - The Honduran rebel party has occupied the two major cities of La Ceiba and Progreso on the northern coast and is now advancing rapidly south, engaging in a major battle with government forces.

Another individual was carrying £30,000 in British banknotes. The Duchess of Alba even sewed 750,000 pesetas worth of banknotes into her clothing in an attempt to escape. Currently, those carrying large sums of money out of the country often use certain stock exchange vouchers, so the use of these vouchers should be immediately prohibited in Madrid and elsewhere.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 20th - The new Spanish Minister of Justice declared that the government will soon begin to recover the lands of large landowners, with appropriate compensation.

<p>Chairman's Address: Chairman Cao Haosen's opening address stated in brief that since the European War, various countries have regarded aviation as the only effective tool for military preparedness and have exerted all their efforts to expand and build their forces, and their development has been astonishing. Even Japan in the recent five years has expanded its air force, strengthened its national defense forces, and competed with the powerful countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, and its achievements are almost comparable. China's aviation industry is lagging behind due to financial difficulties, lack of talent, and the impact of the current situation, which is undeniable. It is closely related to the position of national defense, and its future construction should be more important than all the equipment of the army and navy. It is hoped that all sages, scholars, and experts will openly and honestly discuss together according to the needs of the times and the stimulation of the environment, so that the results of the meeting will be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Instructions: Chairman Chiang's instructions from the National Government stated in essence that China has a vast territory and can be called the largest country in the world. However, the previous unification and construction were in name only. Although there are many reasons, the backwardness of transportation construction has a huge impact on unification. In terms of national defense and military affairs, air force strength is more urgent than that of the army and navy. In terms of transportation and economy, aviation equipment is more efficient than trains, ships, and telegrams. If aviation is developed, the government's orders can be fully transmitted to all remote areas of the country within 24 hours, and all cultural and economic undertakings can be developed and promoted, and the effect of unification will be unsurpassed by any force. It is deeply hoped that this meeting will concentrate opinions, determine the overall construction plan, and establish a great foundation for aviation to satisfy the hopes of the people.</p>
<h3>Memorial Week at the Central Party Headquarters and National Government</h3>
<p>Cheng Tianfang Reports on Inspecting Party Affairs in Henan Province</p>
<p>Yu Youren Reports on the Work of the Control Yuan in the Past Two Months</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a Premier's Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 20th, attended by Liu Luyin, Cheng Tianfang, Chen Lifu, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Daofan, Liu Wendao, and hundreds of staff members. Ma Chaojun presided. Cheng Tianfang reported on the inspection of the Henan province situation, briefly stating that he arrived in Kaifeng at the beginning of March and spent five weeks in Henan, visiting Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xinxiang, Huixian, Xuchang and other places. The comrades sent from the central authorities went to inspect dozens of counties separately. Wherever he went, he summoned party committee members from nearby counties to talk, totaling more than 40 counties. When he returned to Kaifeng, he summoned representatives of the county party headquarters to talk, totaling 85 county party offices. He instructed them on the feelings gained from the inspection and the errors that should be corrected. During Feng Yuxiang's rebellion, Henan party affairs were controlled by the Great Alliance and reorganization factions. In May of the 18th year, the central government sent people to guide them, but in less than half a year, the party affairs were suspended again due to the war. In the 19th year, Henan was a war zone for suppressing the rebellion. Until the end of October, the Central Government recovered the entire Henan Province and the provincial party headquarters returned to Kaifeng to resume work. Only four months had passed since he arrived in Kaifeng. Six counties had executive committees, 23 counties had guidance committees, 46 counties had reorganization committees, eight counties had directly affiliated district party headquarters, and eight counties also had directly affiliated district sub-branches. Twenty-one counties had not yet established party headquarters. There were many shortcomings in lower-level party headquarters. 1. There was a lack of party members. The total number of party members in Henan province was only 8,000 during the general registration in the 17th year. After the turmoil in the 18th and 19th years, many were eliminated, and now there are only more than 6,000 people. 2. Economic difficulties. The provincial party headquarters has 13,000 yuan per month, and most counties have between 300 yuan and 450 yuan, which is only enough for living expenses and office expenses, and there are almost no activity expenses. 3. Most of the party headquarters below the county level are very lax in their work, and even have no meeting records. 4. The party headquarters is separated from party members and even more separated from the people. There are also great errors in the ideology and actions of party members. In</p>

<p>Continuation of Important News</p>
<p>terms of ideology, they mistakenly believe that struggle is revolution and that revolution is class-based action. In terms of action, some party members have gradually become corrupt, while others' words and actions tend to be激动的most of the 大多数stop the activity. Since November last year, they began to reorganize, and after February this year, because of the National Assembly, the provincial party headquarters urged the county party headquarters to promptly guide the establishment of people's organizations, which has been quite smooth. As of April 1, 各项people's organizations of 85 counties have been established in accordance with the law. There are two political problems in Henan: one is banditry and the other is finance. The most bandits are in western and southern Henan. The financial aspect is even more difficult. Education funds are completely independent and can still</p>
<p>However, schools suffered great losses during the war and are now working hard to recover. The party and government can work together very well. The painful reasons for the feelings of the people of Henan are: 1. Warlords harass them 2. The people's wisdom is not open, but the climate in Henan is very good, the land is fertile, and the products are rich. As long as the above two reasons are removed, the society will be stable and can become a prosperous province, and so on. After the report, the meeting was adjourned. The National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the same morning, attended by Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Shao Yuanchong, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Ru Yuli, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Zhengting, Liu Shangqing, He Yaozu, Chen Qicai, and 300 staff members. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony. After leading the salute, Yu Youren reported on the work of the Control Yuan in the past two months, briefly stating that the work of the Control Yuan is divided into two parts: 1. Auditing 2. Impeachment. About a dozen impeachment cases have been established and are under review. Thirty or more cases are under investigation in various places, and more than 100 cases are waiting to be investigated. Only two county magistrates have been announced to be impeached. Society thinks that the official position is small and unpleasant. In fact, impeachment does not ask about the size of the official position, nor should it be transferred to rashly seek pleasant and false names, resulting in the loss of fairness and spirit. The Supervisory Yuan set up investigators in various provinces, and six or seven people have set off and will continue to be dispatched to pay attention to whether the provinces are effectively implementing the after-tax collection. In summary, the main points of the work are (1) very fair (2) pay attention to actual (3) those who are impeached should ask themselves whether they have made mistakes and should not hope to be spared or say good things to the Supervisory Yuan, etc. Then the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Establishes Preparation Committee for Repairing the Confucius Temple</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Shandong Provincial Government initiated the reconstruction of the Confucius Temple in Qufu, the National Government and dignitaries from various provinces have sent telegrams expressing their approval and are willing to be listed as donors. Liu Jiwen and Dai Jitao advocated expanding the scope to repair the Meng Temple, Yan Temple, and Zisi Temple at the same time. Liu Jiwen is also willing to raise 300,000 yuan from overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Therefore, the original repair plan has been changed again. Today (18th) at 1:00 pm, a tea party for the initiators was held in the West Flower Hall of the Provincial Government. Those who attended were Li Shuchun, Jiang Bocheng, Zhang Weicun, Ma Liang, Jin Yun'e, Li Jinglin (represented by Zhao Lanyan), Zhang Honglie, Wang Xiangrong, Zhang Shaotang, He Siyuan, etc. It was decided to organize a preparation committee for the restoration of the Confucius Temple in Qufu and elect Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government, as the chairman, and all members of the provincial party department and provincial government, and all the initiators as members, and elect Zhang Shaotang, Zhang Honglie, He Siyuan, and Li Shuchun to draft the organizational outline. The Construction Department sent personnel to Qufu to re-survey the projects that should be repaired. According to Zhang Honglie, director of the Construction Department, the previous personnel sent to survey the Confucius Temple made a selection of important repairs at an estimated cost of tens of thousands of yuan, and a fundamental reconstruction would cost approximately 1.1 million yuan. If the scope is expanded to repair the Meng Temple, Yan Temple, Zisi Temple, etc., although the project has not been surveyed in detail, it is expected to cost approximately 2 million yuan.

<h3>Shandong Army Launches General Offensive on Baodu Ridge</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuju, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, issued a general attack order on the morning of the 16th because the armies besieging Baodu Ridge had been deployed. On the 18th, a general offensive was launched on the entire line. The 22nd Division of Yu Liangmin's troops and Ma Tengjiao's brigade of Ma Hongkui's troops, and Zhao's brigade of Chen Yaohan's troops advanced in different directions. Lei Taiping's pistol brigade was stationed in Teng County as a general reserve force. Li Wenbin's brigade of Wang Jun's troops blocked the area in Zaozhuang. Wang Wanqing, the general commander of the Lunan militia, led a battalion stationed in Shangye, north of Fei County, to take charge of the rear defense. Cao Fulin, commander of the 49th Division, led Qiao Lizhi's troops to block the area in Linqu, and Ning Chunxiao's 64th Brigade blocked the area at Qingshiguan in Boshan. Sun Tongxuan's Zhan Shutang Brigade blocked the area in Yishui. Chen Yaohan sat in Zhen Yizhou. Jiang Chuou, the commander of the armored car, and Dai Hongbin, the commander of the first battalion of the railway artillery unit, led the Heping, Beiping, and Taishan armored cars to patrol between Lincheng, Zaozhuang, Xuzhou, and Yanzhou. The surrounding arrangements were extremely strict. Han Fuju himself went to Teng County again on the evening of the 17th to command. The following are telegrams from the front: (1) Nu Mi Report: (1) The order to suppress Baodu Ridge was issued this morning and it was decided that Ma's brigade would advance from the concentrated areas toward Baiziyu, Laocaoling, Hanhezi, Dayu, Hongling, Xiangzhuang, Qianfo, and the Cuichangli line. Gu's division searched from the concentrated areas toward Wangjiataizi, Dongmuzhugou, Gejiayu, Cuijiagou, Bojiagou, Shilongshan, and the Huolu line. Zhao's Brigade searched toward the Huolu, Liujiazhuang Kongzhuang, Jiancun, and Beilubowo lines. The pistol brigade was a general reserve team in Tengxian County. (2) According to Gu Shichang, Tang Brigade Commander reported that dozens of bandits near Gelu shot at our sentries at Shanwu, and a company of troops was sent to drive them away, capturing three people and two guns, and more than 100 bandits were found near Gejiazhuang and were driven away and fled to Yangshuchuang. (3) According to Ma Brigade Commander, Shahetou, Wuzuodian, Yabazhuang, Liqiao, Dayu, Hongling, Hongshanyu, Liuquan, Hulutao, etc. were all bandit nests and had stone walls. The surrounding villages had long been burned by bandits. (4) According to Division Commander Zijie's telegram, Zhao's brigade has been ordered to proceed expeditiously and can reach the concentration point by Ji Xiao Wan. (5) According to Lunan Militia Army Commander Wang's report, he has led a battalion of troops to Shangye, and the command headquarters is stationed in Pingyi Te Da, younger brother Han Fuju, Xian Xu Yin (2) Nu Mi, younger brother, arrived in Teng at Xiao Wan, just as the chairman returned to Teng from Yi. The bandits in Mengshan have been quelled, and the general attack on the bandits on Baodu Ridge will begin on Qiao Ri, and it will not be difficult to pacify it. Younger brother Zhang Yue Kouxiao Yin.</p>
<p>It is heard that the bandits of Sun Meisong on Baodu Ridge are extremely cruel. Now the houses in the villages near the bandit's lair have been burned and are full of rubble. The torture of the kidnapped hostages is even more inhumane, and the various bandit punishments are difficult to describe. The incident of women being ravaged and then disemboweled to death and living children being torn apart is becoming more and more common. Baodu Ridge is truly a den of devils. The people in the vicinity hate it to the bone and are doing their utmost to assist the anti-bandit army this time. The heavens have a wide net, and it is thought that the day when the bandits will be captured is not far away. (18th)</p>

<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Plans to Pre-collect Land Tax</h3>
<p>Due to a Fiscal Shortfall of 2.5 Million</p>
<p>Pre-collection of One Million from This Year's Second Term Land Tax</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government, due to its budget expenditure exceeding income by 3.34 million yuan this year, initially planned to collect rice surtax and salt surtax, which have been successively revoked. Although the central government has approved a monthly subsidy of 200,000, there is still a shortfall of 1 million. Even if methods are devised to rectify income, it will not provide immediate relief. On the 14th, at the 187th regular meeting of the provincial government, the Department of Finance proposed pre-collecting one million yuan from this year's second-term land tax. It was resolved to designate the directors of the four departments, Yu Enbo, and Liu Fu as inspectors, convened by the Department of Finance. It is reported that this case is now nearing completion of inspection, and the provincial government will resolve to proceed accordingly. The pre-collection method involves the Department of Finance producing printed receipts, distributing them to various counties for fundraising at a monthly interest rate of 8%, starting from May 1st, in two months, to be submitted to the treasury. The monthly interest will cease at the end of August, and the printed receipts can be used to offset the second-term land tax.</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Local People Petition to Preserve the Scenic Beauty of Nine Peaks. The Nine Peaks of Songjiang County are a scenic attraction in the prefecture. Shrines and tombs of local worthies have been built there, as recorded in local chronicles. The number of folk tombs is even more uncountable. In recent years, some people have initiated stone quarrying, disregarding the destruction of scenic spots and only being concerned with profit. Local people have repeatedly petitioned to oppose this, but the quarrying continues as before. Now, all the mountains are coveted, with people rushing to the official property department to obtain licenses and actively proceed. The scenic beauty of the Nine Peaks is about to be completely destroyed, adversely affecting local culture, water conservancy, and farmland. Now, local gentry such as Geng Daochong, Cai Guangyao, and Zhu Xufan have jointly petitioned the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry, requesting them to respect public opinion and immediately issue an order prohibiting quarrying on all the mountains. Their reasons are fourfold: (1) Once the tombs on the Nine Peaks are destroyed, not only will corpses be exposed and the dead resentful in the afterlife, but the living will also be heartbroken. (2) The Nine Peaks have historical sites and shrines dedicated to famous officials, with inscriptions and records, which are of the same significance and should be cherished as much as the steel statue memorial towers of various countries. Once destroyed, it will harm the country's civilization and undermine the people's faith. (3) Stone-laden boats fill the river, obstructing traffic and hindering water conservancy. Stone chips accumulate and spread in the fields, turning fertile land into stony land. The surrounding fertile land covers no less than hundreds of thousands of acres. Reduced agricultural production will lead to a shortfall in national taxes, harming the country and its people more than anything else. (4) Quarrying companies are numerous, employing thousands of workers, both good and bad, making it easy for thieves to mingle in. It is impossible to achieve tranquility in the neighborhoods and suppress banditry. Summarizing the above harms, Daochong and others have witnessed them with heartache and dare not withhold them from the authorities. Their righteousness and words are stern. Local people are united in their determination to preserve the scenic beauty of the Nine Peaks.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Another Mining Dispute: The Sheshan and Xueshan mountains in this county have always been renowned scenic areas and are also important burial sites. The ancestral tombs of the He family are mainly located in these two mountains. A decade ago, petty criminals privately mined mud and quarried stones, resulting in exposed coffins and bones, a gruesome sight. The He family united their clansmen and appealed to the law, temporarily preserving the area. Now, someone is privately quarrying stones, extending to the entire area of both mountains. It is reported that the He family clansmen plan to unite the landowners and tomb owners of both mountains to devise methods of prevention and establish an office at Shanghai Middle School Experimental Primary School on Shangwen Road in Shanghai to negotiate with them.</p>
<p>Education Association Elects Civil Representatives: The county education association and the freelance professionals group elected civil representatives on the 19th.

<p>Brothers Quarrel and Fight with Weapons: Mao Ahan, a farmer from Shenjia Village, District 11 of the county, is naturally strong and tough, and his younger brother, A Yu, is even more fierce. They separated and supported themselves two years ago. Their relationship was initially harmonious, but their feelings turned sour this spring, treating each other as enemies and constantly arguing and insulting each other. The night before last, they quarreled over a trivial matter and then resorted to violence. A Yu suddenly stabbed his older brother in the chest three times with a sharp blade, causing blood to flow profusely. Ahan endured the pain, grabbed a hunting gun, and retaliated, seriously wounding A Yu in the back. Fortunately, bystanders managed to persuade them to stop, preventing a tragedy. Both are now receiving medical treatment, and their lives may be in danger.</p>

<p>Silk Factory Owner Induces and Sells Female Workers: Zhu Ganxian, the young owner of the Shuiyu Factory in Yangyaowan outside the South Gate of this county, is a dissolute person who specializes in enticing women from good families. In the autumn of last year, he secretly agreed with Shen Yaozu, the head of the car section of the factory, to take four female workers from the cleaning silk section, Qian Hongyun, Feng Hexiu, Xi Caidi, and Zhu A'er, by car to Shanghai. They opened a room in the Daxin Hotel for illicit sexual relations. Zhu also swindled a gold ring from Xi Caidi and a civilization bracelet from Zhu A'er, exchanging them for money. Afterwards, he planned to trick Caidi and A'er into becoming prostitutes in the Yaoer brothel at No. 300, Alley 3, Yingchunfang. At that time, he obtained 400 yuan in commission. Later, Caidi and A'er realized that they had fallen into a pit of fire and were terrified, but they had no choice but to submit under coercion. Feng Hexiu and Qian Hongyun then successively returned to Wuxi. Recently, Zhu A'er suddenly escaped from the Shanghai brothel when the opportunity arose. The matter was discovered by Xi Caidi's grandmother, who immediately arrested Zhu A'er and took her to the First Sub-Station of the Public Security Bureau. After a preliminary hearing by the magistrate Yu, Xi Caidi's father, Xi De*, was summoned to the bureau and ordered to personally go to Shanghai to bring his daughter back. It is reported that he brought Caidi back to Wuxi yesterday and reported to the bureau. Magistrate * prepared a document and transferred the case to the * Bureau for further investigation. After interrogation by Section Chief Wang, the case was filed with the County Court.</p>
<p>Literacy Campaign Week Opens: The literacy campaign in Xiyi County was launched in 1928 and has achieved considerable success since then.

<p>A Big Fire in the West Suburbs Kills One Person: Around 3 a.m., a fire broke out at the home of Li Jinde, a shanty dweller in Xicangqiao Xia Town outside the West Gate of Wuyi County. It quickly spread to the left and right, burning a total of 35 households and 51 thatched houses, and 8 tiled houses. During the fire, Xue Guangyao, a resident who was sick in bed, was unable to escape and died in the fire. Fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire for two hours before it was extinguished. Afterwards, the cries of the victims shook the sky. Nearby businesses such as Ding Taiyuan and Tong Yuanji both prepared funds and purchased supplies to help the victims.</p>
<p>A Traveler Commits Suicide and is Rescued: A traveler arrived at the Yuanxing Hotel on Juqian Street in Wuyi County on the evening of the 18th and booked room number 12, registering under the name "Zheng Dazhuo, Wuxi native, military." Because he did not bring luggage, the hotel asked him to pay the room fee in advance. Zheng went out and pawned his thread-spun jacket for 4 yuan and 2 jiao. After paying the room fee, he also purchased sleeping pills and swallowed them. Around 11 a.m. on the 19th, the tea boy noticed his vomiting and opened the door, seeing that his face had changed drastically. Realizing that he had taken poison, he hired a car to take him to Wujin Hospital for treatment. He was out of danger around 8 p.m. that night. Yuanxing Hotel sent someone to send him to the First Sub-Bureau of Public Security. When asked about the reason for his suicide, he claimed that he was 23 years old, a native of Yueyang, Hunan. He recently went to Shanghai from Hankou and then to Suzhou and Wuxi. On the 18th, he took a second-class train to Changzhou. After getting off the train, he did not know when his wallet, containing 136 yuan, was stolen. Feeling that he had no way out, he resorted to suicide. The bureau ordered Yuanxing Hotel to take him back to the hotel to take care of him and sent a police officer to escort him out of the country on the morning of the 20th.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Zhenbao Ferry Boat Detained: The United Office of the Zhenqing Ferry Line recently received a letter from the Yangzhou Fuyun Sub-Bureau stating that it had received a phone call from the Bao Ying Bureau saying that Hu Yuzhang and Meng Qinghuang, members of the standing committee of the Bao Ying Party Department, had purchased tickets from Zhenjiang to Bao (the Bao Ying boat on the 18th). Gu Xiaoshan wanted them to pay the full fare, but they were annoyed and angrily detained Gu Xiaoshan at the Bao Ying Public Security Bureau when they arrived in Bao. The boat and tow were also detained. The letter was sent to the office for transfer. After receiving the letter, the office telegraphed the Bao Ying Fuyun Ferry Bureau to inquire about the reason. It is certainly not a trivial matter to detain escorts and detain boats and obstruct traffic. It is difficult to guess the cause of this case for the time being. Details will be followed up and recorded.</p>
<p>Ye Chu Cang's Remarks on Business Tax: Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to levy business tax from April 1st, various county, district, and town chambers of commerce happened to be meeting in Zhenjiang and refused to pay the tax and issued a declaration. Chairman Ye specifically expressed his opinion, saying that the Department of Finance, in its capacity as a member of the Provincial Government Committee, jointly decided on provincial affairs. The department is responsible for finance in accordance with the resolution of the Provincial Government Committee. The Department of Finance is not a separate agency from the Provincial Government and has no right to act arbitrarily. The decision to levy the tax from April 1st was not a proposal from the Department of Finance, and the resolution is the entire responsibility of the Provincial Government. The above point is known to those with a little common sense. As for the Provincial Government's policy on business tax in the future, in addition to the existing case, it will have a sincere expression to the merchants and people of the province.</p>
<p>Handling Grain Storage to be Conducted in Three Phases: The Provincial Government recently approved the Ministry of Interior's consultation.

Therefore, it specially distributed the original proposed method to each county to determine the number of needs based on local conditions and divide them into three phases to be completed within three years. It will also formulate reward and punishment regulations for each county and city to assess and strengthen the reality and maintain the important policy.</p>
<p>Financial Inspectors of Each District: The Department of Finance recently divided all counties in the province into ten districts, with one financial inspector in each district. The names of the inspectors in each district are as follows: District 1: Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Gaochun, Jintan, Liyang: Shen Zhengshu; District 2: Wujin, Wuxi, Yixing, Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Danyang: Chen Rongshou; District 3: Wu County, Changshu, Kunshan, Wujiang, Taicang, Jiading: Zhang Ling*; District 4: Songjiang, Shanghai, Nanhui, Qingpu, Fengxian, Jinshan: Zhang Desheng; District 5: Chuansha, Baoshan, Jingming, Qidong, Nantong, Haimen: Zhang * Gui; District 6: Jiangpu, Liuhe, Jiangdu, Yizheng, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Jiangxi, Zhongmei; District 7: Dongtai, Taixian, Bao Ying, Gaoyou, Rufao, Taixing, Hua Zhenji; District 8: Huaian, Huaiyin, Siyang, Lianshui, Funing, Yancheng: Wang*; District 9: *Shan, Fengxian, Pei County, Xiao County, *Shan, Pixian: Bao Gong*; District 10: Suqian, Suining, Donghai, *Yang, Guanyun: Qiu Xian.</p>

<p>County Party Department Investigates Reasons for News Coverage: Shen Jianhui, a member of the County Party Department Rectification Committee, heard on the evening of the 16th around 12 o'clock that the Jiangsheng Daily had an article about Wu Luxiang, the administrative officer of the association, embezzling and engaging in corruption. Zhang Jinchun, a member of the Provincial Party Department, secretly investigated and found evidence to suspend his party membership for six months. Therefore, Committee Member Wang Shusheng went to the Changhua Printing House typesetting room and ordered the typesetter to hand over the original manuscript to Zhong Wei for reading. Because the news violated the principles and had not been verified, he ordered the typesetter to remove it. The typesetter refused because the power was in the hands of the newspaper editor. Committee Member Wang then discussed with the Jiangsheng proofreader, requesting the removal. The proofreader said that the power was in the hands of the editor-in-chief and the proofreader could not be responsible, otherwise, please send an official document from the Party Department with the reasons for removing the news. Committee Member Wang did not agree. The news was then put on the press and printed. Around 2 a.m. on the morning of the 18th, the association telephoned the Public Security Bureau and sent Inspector Wang Wenzhong to the Changhua Printing House to order the news to be stopped, otherwise, it would not be allowed to be published. The Public Security Bureau did not comply due to legal procedures. The next day, after the Jiangsheng Daily disclosed the news, the association stated that the Jiangsheng Daily's report was inaccurate and sent a letter to the newspaper to correct it. Wu Luxiang himself submitted evidence based on the facts, requesting the County Rectification Committee to severely punish him to protect the reputation of party members.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaokui's Bail Not Approved: Zhu Zhaokui, the former administrative committee member of Qingyang Township and the current manager of the Jiangsheng Daily, was reported to the county party department by Wang Fugen, the head of the twenty-third village, for embezzling 68 yuan of salt surplus coupons. He was detained by the county and arrested on the previous day. On the 17th, the plaintiff was summoned and stated that he had raised 50 yuan for the first national treasury bond and handed it over to Zhu Zhaotong, and 18 yuan for the second time and handed it over to Zhaokui. Only the receipt was taken, and the treasury coupon was not received. When Zhaokui was questioned, he claimed that he had not handled this matter at all and was completely unaware of it. He requested bail, and the court immediately ordered that you are accused by many people and you are not allowed to post bail. He was still sent back to the detention center.</p>

<p>Bandits Publicly Extort and Murder: Xu Yongbiao's five-year-old son, a farmer in the third district of the county, was kidnapped by bandits the other day and threatened to go to Bali Song within ten days to contact someone holding a red lantern. It was heard that four bandits went to Xu's house around 2 p.m. yesterday (17th) to urge the ransom. Three bandits guarded the gate, and one bandit went inside to negotiate with Xu. Because Xu did not have much money at home, he only allowed 200 yuan. The bandits were extremely angry and shot Xu down. At this time, the bandit suddenly saw that Xu's daughter was beautiful and wanted to take her away. The girl did not refuse at the time and secretly took a grass-cutting knife and slashed the bandit's waist in half when he was unprepared. She and her mother immediately escaped through the back door. The three bandits guarding the gate waited for too long and went inside to investigate and saw that their comrade had been killed. The bandits were furious and immediately hacked Xu Yongbiao, who was injured and lying on the ground, in the head and chest, killing him instantly. They went into the room and stabbed Yongbiao's old mother to death with a knife before fleeing with howling. This morning, Yongbiao's wife and daughter came to the city to report to the county government.</p>
<p>Lintong Yuantong Money Shop Robbed: Four bandits suddenly came to the Yuantong Money Shop in Linzhe Town, county-owned, around three o'clock the other night.

<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>A Kidnapping Occurs in Dayi Township: Dayi Township in the eastern part of Xiaoshan is located in a remote area with no military or police stationed, so bandits appear frequently.

Now the two pagodas have been gradually completed, but the seven chapters of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra handwritten by the late Mr. Lu Zhuangjian on the upper level of the East Pagoda, after being requested and taken away by the county government, have not yet been returned. Now Lu Lanbo and Lu Huisheng, descendants of the Lu family, have repeatedly written to the pagoda repair committee, urging them to return their ancestor's handwriting to be stored in the pagoda to fulfill his wishes. The pagoda repair committee has also repeatedly appealed to the county magistrate, but there is still no progress.

<p>Correspondence</p>
<h3>Letter from the Huai River Conservancy Commission</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: We recently read in the Domestic News section of your newspaper on April 18th that the content regarding Xu Shiying's investigation of Hongze Lake is not consistent with the facts. The original plan of the Huai River Conservancy Project was to separate the river and the sea. However, due to limited funds, the first phase of the project will start with the river. When the national treasury is abundant in the future, the waterway to the sea will be opened up. It has been submitted to the National Government and sent to the Construction Committee and the Ministry of Internal Affairs for review and approval. The 18th meeting of the National Government approved the record, and there was no further meeting to make a decision. We request that you urgently correct this and publish it. Sincerely, The Huai River Conservancy Commission of the National Government, April 19.</p>

<h3>The Latest Trends in Japanese Children's Education</h3>
<p>— Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese education has made rapid progress, especially in basic children's education. What I call "learning gardens" are the latest experimental schools in Japan, whose facilities are based on the principles of new education from around the world. The affiliated primary schools, which are the centers of new education in Japan, still base their research interests on establishing special experimental departments to conduct field tests of new education principles and theories. When the author inspected education in Japan, he used an objective perspective and, based on the country's historical education principles, summarized the new trends in Japanese children's education in the following two points: (1) Health Education; (2) Work Education.</p>
<p>I will first describe the implementation of health education in Japanese primary schools, which is most surprising: regardless of primary schools or kindergartens in the city or suburbs, they all have specific exercise times and instructors, as well as various medical and health preparations. There are detailed records of the health problems of children in primary schools or kindergartens. Each school has its own sports performance and health record statistics. Each city or county has statistics on the sports performance and health records of its city or county. For example, if you inquire about the health of any child in any school, the principal can show you the child's health record at a glance. If you inquire about the physical condition of the primary school children in the entire city or county from the educational administrative authorities of a city or county, they can immediately show you the latest statistical tables for the entire city or county. The height and weight of boys and girls of all ages over three years old are clearly countable. I once visited the head of the Education Section of the Tokyo City Education Bureau to learn about the school health facilities in the entire city. I will briefly describe them as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Health Education</p>
<p>Physical Examination: Physical examinations are conducted for children before entering school and during school, as well as for teachers and staff in various schools and kindergartens. New students are examined once to three times every year from January to March. For children with diseases, their parents or older siblings are notified to seek treatment before entering school. Children with infectious diseases and those who cannot attend school may be allowed to delay enrollment or be exempted from enrollment. Close attention is paid to school hygiene for students during school, and strict physical examinations are conducted regularly every May. The physical examinations of staff are also carried out strictly, and those with diseases are fully treated.</p>
<p>Cultivating School Health Awareness: To improve and complete school hygiene, we engage in the cultivation and enlightenment of health awareness by opening lectures and training courses.</p>
<p>Investigation of School Hygiene: For reference in the implementation of school hygiene, we conduct surveys of children's fatigue, air quality in classrooms, children's health status, children's development status, surveys on the care of frail children, and surveys of children's diseases and deaths.</p>
<p>Summer Health Facilities: Children in cities who live in noise and dust have very few opportunities to be close to nature, resulting in many mental and physical defects. In 1928, the Tokyo City Primary Schools sought relief measures and opened 22 forest schools and 55 seaside schools, with the participation of as many as 9,905 children.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Work Education</p>
<p>Origin of the Term "Work Education": The term "work education" is derived from the German word "ArbeitsPadagogik", which is translated as "labor education" or "manual work education". Professor Kerschensteiner of Germany is a well-recognized giant in advocating work education, and the German education community has been greatly influenced by him.</p>
<p>Principles of Work Education: The ideology of work education takes children's activities as the main body and is not satisfied with a passive attitude. The so-called activity is that for any time, any situation, and any object, it always indicates a positive state. The object of education is children, and it is always appropriate to stimulate their active impulses. This impulse develops from the manifestation of the spirit and thus reaches the activity of handling affairs. This is the basic principle of work education. Children with healthy development actually have strong active impulses, and education should not ignore this fact. Ignoring this fact is actually the past education. The past educational thought regarded children as recipients, receiving knowledge and receiving teachings. Work education reverses this idea and makes children engage in activities.</p>
<p>The Practice of Work Education: The Third Division of the Affiliated Primary School of Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School has been engaged in the experiment of new education since 1920. The following research has been done on work education: (1) Base work on centers with cultural value; (2) All children must participate in each work, and this work should be suitable for children's interests and abilities; (3) Work that can exercise muscles and bones; (4) Work that can create creative publications; (5) All results are corrected by themselves; (6) Develop a research atmosphere, including: A. Develop a research attitude; B. Guide research methods.</p>
<p>Points to Note on Work: (1) Establish the purpose of the work and determine the plan to guide the method of implementing the plan. The plan can be written on paper, exercise books, or blackboards, which is the objectification of the plan; (2) The guidance items of the work include: A. What children can say; B. Matters of experience and affection; C. Reflection on how to obtain knowledge; D. Understanding of how capable; E. Criticism of the whole work, i.e., considering the shortcomings and advantages of the plan's implementation ability, etc.; (3) One hour per day for pure personal work; (4) Teachers may engage in joint activities with children when necessary; (5) Teachers constantly supervise the entire work; (6) Standing in the position of a guide, when you recognize the advantages of children, you should support their labor; (7) Understand the scope of the work, what is mental work and what is muscle and bone work.</p>
<p>Matters that Teachers Should Pay Attention to: (1) Engage in research on the social and natural impressions that children often receive; (2) Always approach social changes and changes in natural phenomena with sharp eyes; (3) Teachers should approach and observe the changes in society and the changes in nature to see their reactions; (4) Correct any maladaptations of children to social and natural changes; (5) Take the joint activities of both sexes as the principle.</p>
<p>Special Work Time: How to study the homework of each time period can be put into operation in the time allocation of primary schools. From 1926, the afternoon time was set as the time for all work, and the implementation method is as follows: (1) The morning and afternoon times are divided into two parts; (2) The morning is mainly mental work, and the afternoon is mainly muscle and bone work; (3) The afternoon work is for children under five years old to engage in social activities and must give play to their personality with the subject as the center; (4) Teachers' attitude during afternoon work: A. Discover children's personality in work other than the courses they are responsible for; B. Seek the harmony of individual activities and social activities; (5) Distribution of work for each year: A. Lower grades do free work; B. Third and fourth grades do learning-oriented work, and children fill in learning sheets every week and receive teachers' reading; C. Fifth grade is the same as third and fourth grades; D. Sixth grade adds practical work to the teaching content; (6) Regularly receive the guidance of the teachers in charge of the subject at the appropriate time; (7) Hold a work exhibition once a month to encourage common work and the self-government system. Before 1927, each class had two class self-government committee members and two school self-government committee members. The class self-government committee members directed the self-government activities of the class. The school self-government committee members were selected from each class in the whole school and jointly organized the school self-government association, and the training committee members from the teachers were responsible for guiding and directing the self-government activities in the school. The staff of the self-government association are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Planning Department members are the chairpersons of the class self-government association and the staff of the school self-government association.</p>
<p>Two Cleaning Department members pay attention to hygiene matters in the class.</p>
<p>Two Tidying Department members pay attention to tidying up the classroom.</p>
<p>Two Discipline Department members manage the discipline of the class.</p>
<p>Two Library Department members manage the class library and the whole school children's library services.</p>
<p>Special Children's Museum and Children's Library</p>
<p>A children's library is indispensable for children's work environment, arousing the attention of ordinary children and cultivating the attitude of using the library. The children's museum is also important for the work environment, collecting and researching materials for geography, history, science, etc., and cultivating the attitude of handling affairs.

<h3>Sakamoto's Lecture on the Overview of Japanese Elementary Education (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>At higher elementary girls' schools, male teachers earn 54 yuan and female teachers 45 yuan; at ordinary elementary schools, male teachers earn 55 yuan and female teachers 43 yuan. Six years of compulsory education are tuition-free, but in reality, fees are sometimes charged: 60 cents per month in cities and 30 cents per month in rural elementary schools. Six years old is the school age; children are required to enter elementary school. Currently, 99% of children are enrolled. Class sizes are limited to no more than 24 classes per school. Ordinary elementary school classes have a maximum of 78 students, while higher elementary school classes have a maximum of 60. In special cases, they may be the same as ordinary elementary schools. The weekly class time for ordinary elementary schools is a maximum of 36 hours and a minimum of 18 hours. According to the yearbook, in recent years, the number of elementary school students in Japan was 9.28 million in 1930, and there were 208,000 teachers. 225.5 out of every 1,000 people attend school. Although this is fewer than in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and England, the proportion is higher than in France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, and other countries. It is truly difficult for Japan, as a late-developing country, to achieve this number. The establishment of elementary schools in Japan differs from other countries. There are very few private schools. A 1930 survey showed only 105 private schools compared to 25,500 public schools. Last year, 2,400 students graduated from public elementary schools, 970,000 from local elementary schools, only 400 from private schools, and 180,000 from municipal schools. Recently, the Japanese education community has launched a reform movement, but they do not oppose the current education system. The slogans of Japan's recent education movement are: (1) Break down aristocratic education and create people-oriented education; (2) Break down the rigid, formalistic education of theory and build practical, effective education that suits human life and enables adaptation to human needs; (3) Adopt practical, personalized education; (4) Education should be localized, adapted to the local environment, and suited to practical life. Now, let's critique the advantages and disadvantages of this current system: (1) Education is widespread; (2) Over 90% of school-age children are enrolled; (3) Teachers' salaries are relatively good; (4) School facilities are complete; (5) School administration is well-organized and discipline is strict; (6) Teachers are respected by society. Disadvantages: (1) Elementary school aims to prepare for middle school; (2) Children are crowded into schools, and admission through exams is difficult; (3) The system is too uniform and rigid; (4) There are too many courses, making it difficult for children to concentrate; (5) The people of the country are too biased towards theory in education and not practical enough; (6) Children have too little activity and are too focused on militarism. In short, Japan is forced by external troubles to be in its current state; otherwise, it would not be so. However, with the emergence of the new movement, a few schools are moving towards reform, such as Tokyo Seikan School, where each class has no more than 30 students. The system is a six-year elementary school and a seven-year middle school, with teachers and students living together. Every day, there is a 15-minute meditation period (quiet rest) and the singing of the "Heart Power Chorus" song. A徹夜會 (all-night meeting) is held every May 27th, and there is a "Fasting Festival" in December to train children's independence and endurance. (End)</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Advocates Baseball</h3>
<p>Telegram to the local Chinese Baseball Team</p>
<p>Expressing His Utmost Support</p>
<p>Nanchang, 19th – The Shanghai YMCA Sports Department forwarded to Zhang Guoxun, Liu Dacheng, Li Baojun, and other members of the Chinese baseball team, regarding their efforts to revitalize the Chinese baseball team: Baseball is not only for physical exercise, but can also cultivate the spirit of courage and initiative. I have always wanted to promote it, but have had no opportunity due to years of service in the field. I greatly approve of your efforts and hope you will actively pursue them. If there is anything I can do in the future, I will do my best to support you. He Yingqin</p>

<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>▲ The Eskimos along the Arctic coast of the Americas travel by sled pulled by dogs. These dogs have a special name called Husky and are very similar to wolves, but they are still afraid of humans, otherwise they would be as dangerous as man-eating wolves.</p>
<p>▲ The cross on top of St. Paul's Cathedral in London looks very small, but it is actually very large. The two sides, when unfolded, are eleven feet long, and the direct length is about the same.</p>
<p>▲ The ladybug, which specializes in killing pests in the garden, can be regarded as the protector of flowers. In the UK and the US, some people raise them for use in gardens. In the US, they are sold by the pound.</p>
<p>▲ In India, some wealthy locals make very thin gold and silver flakes and place them on food as decoration. It is said that they also believe that these metals have medicinal effects and are beneficial when placed with food.</p>
<p>▲ The education sector in London once held a special exam with questions specifically for eleven-year-old elementary school students. Fifty of them answered correctly without error. Later, these questions were used to test American students, but out of seven hundred sixteen-year-old students, not one answered correctly.</p>
<h3>Scary Economic Statistics</h3>
<p>— Huang Hongzhu</p>
<p>If we consider a person's life to be seventy years, and the average person eats three bowls of rice per meal, then each person must eat 229,950 bowls of rice in their lifetime, which is 84 shi of rice. If we calculate the number of grains of rice, it is about 850.4 million grains. Assuming each shi costs 20 yuan, the rice consumed in a lifetime costs a total of 1,680 yuan. If one lives to be a hundred years old or more, of course, they will need to eat many more billions of grains of rice. If we calculate the time spent eating rice as 30 minutes per meal, then one must spend 38,325 hours in their lifetime, which is four years, five months, six days, and twenty-one hours. Recently, some people have advocated a two-meal system, believing that they can benefit greatly in terms of health. If we change to two meals, we can reduce the time to 25,550 hours, which is two years, eleven months, fourteen days, and fourteen hours. The cost of rice can be reduced to 2,240 yuan. Let's also try to calculate the cost of cigarettes and alcohol. If one drinks two he of alcohol every night, then they will drink a total of 51 shi and 1 dou in their lifetime. If we calculate the alcohol at 2 yuan per sheng, then the cost will be 10,220 yuan. If one drinks one sheng of alcohol per day, then the cost of alcohol alone in a lifetime will be over 50,000 yuan. As for cigarettes, if one smokes one pack of paper cigarettes (10 cigarettes per pack) every day, then they will smoke a total of 511,000 cigarettes in their lifetime, worth 4,599 yuan. A person who smokes one pack of paper cigarettes a day will spend 34,066 hours smoking in their lifetime, which is three years, one month, nine days, and ten hours. If one can divert this money and time to other useful purposes, the gains would be considerable.</p>
<p>Let's try to calculate the time women spend in front of the mirror. The average woman starts using a mirror at about six years old. From six to ten years old, they spend seven minutes a day. From eleven to fifteen years old, they spend fifteen minutes a day. From sixteen to nineteen years old, they spend twenty minutes a day. From twenty years old and above, they spend at least one hour or more each day looking in the mirror. From sixty to seventy years old, they spend about seven minutes a day. Based on the above numbers, one will spend 16,000 hours in their lifetime, which is one year and ten months.</p>
<p>The above are statistics on consumption. Let's try to calculate production. The amount of urine produced in a lifetime is 153 shi and 3 dou (on average). If it could be sold at the price of alcohol, then each person could get 30,660 yuan. However, in reality, it costs 76 yuan and 6 jiao in labor costs (such as hiring someone to empty the chamber pot and wash the toilet). In today's world, even urine is not easy. According to legal medical explanations, adults defecate once a day and children twice a day as the standard. If this is the case, then the time spent in the toilet in a lifetime, assuming two minutes per visit, is 8,400 hours, which is 354 days and 20 hours, or eleven months, twenty-four days, and twenty hours.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of an Old Woman's Marriage</h3>
<p>— Te Fo</p>
<p>In the western outskirts of the town, there was an old woman named Wang who was already over sixty years old. Her husband, a farmer, had died eight years ago. Her family was destitute, and she lived a lonely life, but the old woman was unaware of her age. She wore flowers in her hair and powder on her face, swaggering through the market, and people regarded her as a demon. There was an old man named Zheng who was over fifty years old but still unmarried. According to clan rules, an unmarried man could not be the clan chief. Zheng, being of a senior generation, should lead his clan. Therefore, through matchmakers, he married old woman Wang to taste the joys of being a clan chief. On the day the colorful sedan chair arrived at the door, proverbially speaking, a coffin should be added to the dowry. Shao Weng, a neighbor eighty-six years old, was already enjoying his grandchildren. When he was sixty years old, he regretted not having a son. Therefore, he rented a woman from outside the north gate as his wife for a term of three years, paying rent of thirty-six yuan per year. Before the year was over, he joyfully had a son. One day, Shao Weng brought a book to my house, pointing to a red circle in the book, saying to the late mother: "This is the day I went to Beiguo Zhou to see the woman. It is exactly ten months from that day to the day my son was born." At that time, I was young and saw that the book was an almanac with a red circle on the thirteenth day of a certain month, which was taken as a mark. It was the day Shao Weng visited her. The reason he showed it to the late mother was to use the almanac as proof to strengthen the beliefs of the neighbors.</p>
<h3>Talking about Springs in West Lake</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The scenery of West Lake is the best in China, and its famous springs are especially fragrant and sweet. People flock to them. I recall what I saw this spring, which is quite noteworthy. I will record them one by one, not fearing wordiness.</p>
<p>▲ Tiger Spring: The spring is located inside the Tiger Spring Temple. Stone is used to form a pool, filled halfway with water. It is clear, cold, and sweet, and is considered the best of the springs on the lake. The most amazing thing is that the density of the spring water is relatively high. The monks of the temple, to entertain guests, specially sink a bowl at each of the four corners of the pool. Guests use copper coins to aim at the bowl and throw, but the result is often that they float into the side of the bowl. This is because the water quality is dense, and the copper coins are not easy to drop straight down. Visitors like tourists frequent the temple. The amount of copper coins the temple receives from the spring each day is also not small. To the left of the large pool, a small pool is specially built, covered with a vessel, and prominently written: "Drinking water inside, do not throw copper coins." The entire temple relies on this for drinking water. When I visited the temple, several women were scooping spring water to drink. When asked why, they said it could brighten the eyes.</p>
<p>▲ Pearl Spring: It emerges from the Jade Spring Fish Paradise from the side door. It is Pearl Spring. Pearl Spring is not where spring water rises all year round, densely like beads. Tourists who arrive for the first time are often disappointed and return, as they see nothing. In fact, the "pearls" of this spring need a little human effort to create a spectacular sight. When I arrived at the spring, I saw a guest standing by the pool, jumping up and down with both feet like a madman. After a short while, the spring gushed out greatly, and water droplets rose around it, continuously and brilliantly, like glittering pearls, transforming into a wondrous scene. I stood there reluctant to leave for a long time, and then I realized that most of the previous visitors had not recognized its secret.</p>
<p>▲ Cold Spring: It is located at the foot of Feilai Peak. The flowing water is scaly and gurgling. This is the largest of the springs on the lake. However, naming it "Cold" truly puzzles us. Apart from hot springs, aren't all springs in the world cold? Why is only this spring called "Cold"? Some say that this spring emerges from a cliff through stone, and its coldness is relatively high, but when I put my hand in it, I did not see it being refreshingly cool.</p>
<p>▲韬光Spring: Climbing the steps from Lingyin, one arrives at 韬光 Mountain. The sound of the spring water is trickling along the mountain path, but one cannot find its location after searching everywhere. Later, upon closer inspection, it was discovered that there are bamboo pipes running down the mountain. The springs all reach the foot of the mountain through the pipes. This is probably the most interesting of the springs in West Lake.</p>
<p>▲ Jade Spring: Jade Spring is known for its giant fish on the lake. The spring originates very far away, flowing underground for dozens of miles, and is only visible here. The spring is extremely clear, but because tourists often throw bait to feed the fish, the surface of the water is often covered in oil. The monks of the temple must clean it every day. Otherwise, after ten days, the fish will also disappear from sight.</p>
<h3>A Disciple Explains the Dharma for the Altar</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>During the Lantern Festival after the abolished calendar in our town, a maiden from the Yin family in the city, who made a living by carrying meals, was able to invite the head of her family to descend. Thus, the storytellers made it mysterious, and the romantic affairs of the boudoir girl became a single creed of obedience for scholars. The assembly happened to be located across from the Yin family, at the center of the business community where voices could be heard.</p>
<p>The so-called art of spirit writing was also set up by the owner of the assembly hall who was skilled in this practice, while those who did not know it could not understand its reasons, and the authority of the gods increased day by day. Since the establishment of the altar, it has been more than a month, and those who have come to the altar include so-and-so, no less than ten or so. Their origins are also spoken of vividly. Those who ask about fortunes and misfortunes include the head of such-and-such bureau and the head of such-and-such section. Their footsteps overlap at the door until late at night before they disperse. Alas, it is strange indeed.</p>
<p>I am not one who does not believe, but I believe too deeply, so I am unwilling to test its effectiveness with worldly affairs, and want to explore its ultimate mystery with inconceivable mysteries. Examining the word "ji," Shuowen says, "divination to ask about doubts." Tongdian says, "The Western countries use sheep for divination, and the diviner is called 'Si Ji'." I have no way to prove it, and the existence of ghosts is even more difficult to discuss. Outsiders have invented the theory of ghost studies, but it is also based on empty talk without substance and is not sufficient to rely on. Recently, scientists have attributed everything to human brainpower and named it "spirit." Their theory is slightly advanced. In 1882, the British founded a Society for Psychical Research to explore its mysteries using scientific methods. Braddeus was also a famous figure in studying this subject, and his creations were especially rich. More than ten years ago, they were published in a modern magazine, but unfortunately, I can no longer remember them.</p>
<p>I say that if we want to solve this problem today, we should eliminate the view of fortune and misfortune and explore it with a scholar's attitude, so that we can get its mystery. For example, psychologists have the theory of telepathy, moralists have the transcendence of consciousness, and we must distinguish between monsters and ghosts in the age of mythology. What is the relationship between today's popular hypnosis and the phenomena when shamans summon ghosts? Even the historical records of communication between gods and ghosts, from ancient times to the present, if we can study them, will be more interesting than burning incense and praying silently for benefits and losses. For example, telepathy is an example of everyday encounters, often overlooked and unknown to have practical significance, or it is called "communication with heart." Also, transcendence of consciousness is called "the heavenly eye" by Buddhists, and the Japanese translate it directly as "clairvoyance." All are scholars who study the spirit, and must not be confused. It must be known that the realities of the natural world are chaotic, and human knowledge is limited, so it is up to Heaven to obtain the true meaning of each and every one. However, just as the fluctuations of air and ether, and the discovery of X-rays, were once said by ancient people to be beyond the reach of intelligence and invisible to the eye, now they can be photographed and highlighted by Frick light. Therefore, those who are fascinated by this should take advantage of their spare time from their public duties to examine the mystery of its origin, and its success will surely dispel doubts and break confusion and benefit society, which is no small matter.</p>
<p>▲ Short News: Liang Jiasai Zhen's reputation has spread far and wide since dedicating herself to the silver screen. I have met her once and feel that her lively style and charm reveal the childish innocence between her eyebrows. Since joining Star Film Company last year, she has been praised by famous directors, and her skills have improved. Recently, in Mr. Xu Xinfu's directed martial arts tragic film "The Love of Three Arrows," she and Ms. Hu Die each displayed their unique talents to the fullest. The film has already been released, and I don't know how many more boys it will fascinate. (Zi Wei)</p>
<p>▲ Publishing News: The third collection of the Saturday Compilation is bound in a very elegant style. It contains many works by famous artists and is full of aesthetic appeal. There are more than 300 photos, making it even more interesting. It is said that it will be on sale starting today at the actual price of one yuan and two jiao, plus one jiao and a half for postage. If you subscribe at the same time, you only need two yuan and two jiao, and postage is free. Readers who love it can purchase it from the newspaper's office at Maijiaquan.</p>
<h3>Travels in India (30)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the afternoon of December 16th, Professor Ma Shi led me to visit the White Building Temple (Balur). We took the west-bound tram from the Buddhist Association, crossed the Heng River Bridge to the West Station, and changed to a bus. After a quarter of an hour's journey north, we arrived at a place where the trees were lush and the thatched cottages resembled those in China. The place to get off the bus was half a li away from the temple, so we walked there. We saw workers using soil to make square bricks, which were burned in a kiln. The bricks were square. I thought of the brick-making machine company invented by a certain person in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. I don't know where it is now. Last summer, the vegetarian restaurant in Hangzhou discussed the matter in their company, and I was also listed as supporting the company, which could produce thousands of bricks per hour, thus reducing the suffering of manual labor. Industry in India is not developed, but I heard that there is a cannon factory that I was not allowed to visit. Soon, we arrived at the White Building Temple. The temple is on the bank of the Heng River, with a good view of the entire city. The houses are in Western-style squares, scattered about half a li apart. The weather is hot, so it is suitable to live in different places. Outside each house, there are lawns and vegetable gardens. As soon as Professor Ma Shi saw the Heng River, he raised his hand to his forehead and paid his respects to the Heng River, telling me that this was India's sacred river. When I was young and studied mathematics, I saw the number of grains of sand in the Heng River, and I didn't understand it. Now I have seen the sand in the Heng River. In fact, the water in the Heng River is turbid, not sandy, but muddy. Sand still has grains that can be counted, but mud really cannot be counted. The temple room is not very wide, but it is clean and tidy. I saw many large iron pots in the temple with vegetables. I know that they cook their own food. In the room, there were statues of various colors. We sat in the corridor and talked with the monks, asking how many years the temple had been built. They answered thirty years. There are about sixty monks. When asked how they ate, they answered that they cooked their own food and hired a kitchen. Sometimes they also begged for food. From this, I know that the Indian church does not rely entirely on begging. Why did the Buddha set the rule of begging? They eat pure vegetarian food, and do not eat fish or shrimp, which is different from the monks in Ceylon and Burma, and is similar to the Chinese monks. I wanted to see their scriptures, so they led me to a library in the South Building. I took off my shoes and went up. All the books were Western-style, in Sanskrit, Bengali, and English. India has been under British rule for one or two hundred years, and the monks' classics are also Western-style. Most of the monks spoke English. I wanted to see the appearance of their ancient scriptures, so they showed me yellow scrolls of unknown age, copied in neat Sanskrit. I really wanted to see their palm-leaf scriptures, because Indian religion is more ancient than Buddhism and must have also been written on palm leaves. It took a lot of time, so they took a string of palm-leaf scriptures. When I looked at it, it was unexpected. I couldn't tell that it was a leaf, but like bamboo slips. It was about a foot long and only two fingers wide. The words on it were not written, but printed. The palm leaves have veins that can be scraped flat and printed. A string of about a hundred slips is convenient to carry and quite beautiful. I wanted to ask for one or two slips as souvenirs. They said that this style is an ancient slip but newly made. There are sellers at No. 65 University Street. This is also like the people of Henan Province in our country who specialize in manufacturing Han Dynasty camel and horse jars and ancient artifacts underground.</p>
<p>The abbot called "Shami" (novice monk) to guide me to see their shrine. The statues were not big, only two or three feet. Men and women were praying. The statue of Krishna was also there. He is the Buddha of Hinduism, the central saint. There was also a Kali descending calendar statue, which was too evil. I didn't like looking at it. She had human heads hanging around her body and stuck out her tongue. Kali and the new male god 沙地 are husband and wife. Their philosophy is also very profound and difficult to understand suddenly. It is said that this temple is a branch temple of the White Building Temple. It was taught by its famous monk Vivekananda to an American woman named Sister Nivedita. The woman returned to Europe and America and greatly advocated teaching my Indian religion. She has already conquered many Europeans and Americans because her philosophy is profound.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Price: Market Soars</h3>
<p>Soars by Eleven Taels and Three Mace: Yesterday, the 20th, the gold market turned from bad to good, with drastic changes. The morning market only opened with a three or four tael opening, once breaking through the 700 tael mark. The afternoon market gradually improved with unparalleled momentum, reaching almost 720 taels. The entire market had more than 20 taels of retrospective transactions, ultimately soaring by eleven taels. Furthermore, large accounts resisted short positions, and people's hearts tended to rise. The overseas silver market reported an increase, so the initial opening was weak, but then buyers seemed diligent and moved forward, causing the foreign exchange rate to rise. However, the domestic market was firm despite being weak, and the gold price slightly fluctuated. At noon, it was at 700 taels. In the afternoon, it initially stabilized, and then due to the reduction of exchange rate cards, the banks' appetite remained good. Moreover, Dadesheng and other companies expanded their purchases, suddenly presenting a peak. The gathering of the situation and the soaring of more than ten taels was truly unexpected. In short, the short sellers were urgently replenishing. This morning, there are signs of a bearish trend for large contracts.</p>
<p>Initial Opening Shows a Sharp Decline: The early morning opening for the June contract immediately dropped seven taels and five mace to 699 taels (but this price was absolutely difficult to buy, with the three silver price plus three-eighths and the private telegrams also rising by sixteen and five-eighths points, so people's hearts were downward). Soon, companies like Tong Taichang, Shunlifu, Changwanxing, etc., began selling, immediately rebounding by four taels to a total of 703 taels. Then, sellers saw a strong retreat to 702 taels and three mace, and then rose again by three or four taels. The goods arrived and the banks consumed English gold worth 13,875 to the first shilling. The announcement revealed a long position of two and a half US dollars per unit, and the Japanese gold was reduced by two and a half points, but there was no impact. At that time, 700 taels and four taels were only suppressed by a small one tael, another zero taels and eight mace. The bank did inter-bank trading of English gold at eight seven five in April, and soon the bank consumed seven or eight months of eight seven five. Hengxing and others bought in, adding three taels and ten points. A moment later, it was zero six taels. After six or seven minutes, it retreated to zero three taels and eight nine mace, which was sold by Fuyu and others. Mitsui and Zhengjin ate July English gold at eight one two five, and Tianyu, Yongfu, Fuyu, etc., chased purchases. This has now been pulled up three taels and ten points to zero six taels six seven. After entering, Yuan Maoyong and others sold out, and the bank did inter-bank trading in April at eight one two five. Mitsui bought August at eight seven five. At eleven o'clock, it dropped to zero two taels and eight mace. After that, there were three taels of exchanges. After eleven thirty, it slightly rose two or three taels. At noon, it was counted at zero six taels. By the close, it was zero five taels and three mace, and the transactions of various companies were prosperous. The revealed price was counted at 753 taels, pressing 50 taels to 47 or 8 taels. Afterwards, it was changed to 759 taels, suppressing it to between 40 taels. The afternoon was accounted for from zero three taels to zero five taels, and the afternoon was from sixteen taels to eighteen taels. The replenishment water was 699 taels, and in the afternoon, it was 712 taels. The double closing price for the two markets.</p>
<p>Trading Complexity: The inter-bank trading was quite complicated, including Cuichangyong, Chengfengyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Qianchangxiang, and short-selling companies like Fuchang. Yu Da, Hengxing, Yuan Maoyong, etc., all sold out. In the afternoon, Tian Yuyong, Cuichangyong, Daxingyong, Yu Da, Zhifengshui, Yifengyong, Yuantai, Fuxingyong, Yiyu, and Xinxing all bought in. Dadesheng bought more than 4,000 contracts. Qianchangxiang, Fuchang, Changshengyong, Futaiheng, etc., occasionally had ins and outs. Yuan Maoyong, Shunli, Tong Taichang Wanxing, etc., all sold out. It is heard that a certain speculator, Mr. Ying, bought in and out. Guang Bang made a few ins and outs in the morning. It is said that Dadesheng bought more than 4,000 contracts on his behalf to replenish previous shorts. Dalian Bang had a total of more than 4,000 contracts traded in and out.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rate Turns Favorable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rates initially increased, as the English and American silver markets had reported a long-term trend the day before. Later, the exchange rate suddenly shrank by half a grade. The unified core English gold still increased by one and two five US dollars and two five. The Japanese gold decreased by one and two five. From 9:30 in the morning, English gold increased by two five US dollars per unit, Indian exchange rate one and a half yuan, German exchange rate two yuan, franc twelve yuan, Japanese and foreign exchange rate one yuan and two five, Singapore exchange rate fell three taels, Japanese gold fell two and a half points, and Hong Kong's daily rate increased.

Hong Kong is still 78 taels and a half. As for the bank's internal market, it was loose in the morning, flat in the afternoon, and tightened. The gold market almost reached the 720 tael mark because large accounts replenished their short positions. It is heard that many bank drafts were settled. In the Chinese gold industry, Tian Yuyong, Fuchang, Yifengyong, Tongfengyong, Hongli, Runchangyu, Qianchangxiang, Shengda, etc., all sold out to repay the receipts. Banks had a strong buying intention. Shanghai, Huabi, HSBC, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Taiwan, Korea, Zhengjin, Dongya, Datong, etc., all bought in. However, HSBC, Taiwan, Mitsui, and Huabi sold out in the afternoon, which was slightly directed at buying settlements and resisting short positions in the gold industry. However, the unified core supply exceeded demand. English gold had a transaction of about 400,000 to 500,000 pounds, and the US dollar was not very active. Japanese gold had a settlement of several hundred thousand yuan. The result compared to the previous Saturday. English gold shrank by one and two five US dollars and two five. Japanese gold added seven five, showing a clear scene of loose and tight.</p>

<h3>The Big Bill Silver Dollar Market Slightly Better</h3>
<p>The date of the Big Bill coincided with the opening and closing of customs, making settlement particularly troublesome.</p>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, Monday, the bank's opening and closing settlement was busy, coupled with the value of the Big Bill period. The settlement of money houses was also quite considerable, resulting in an exceptionally busy situation of two difficulties colliding. Although the transaction situation in the market was not prosperous, it was still more colorful than usual. However, the prices of silver dollars were still chaotic because no one was competing.

The afternoon market was 7 mace, 2 points, and 8 and a half li, which seemed to be half a li better than the afternoon market the day before. However, people's hearts were firm, so there was no surprising turbulence. "Silver Split" The early and afternoon markets were the same at 2 points, which was the same as the day before. The problem was still that there were too many head linings, and the white markings were excessive.</p>

<h3>Long-Term Funds Transactions Have Been Made Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 20th, and the long-term contracts due for delivery were no less than several million. However, because it is currently early and time is needed, most of them have not yet started transactions. Although large numbers of long-term transactions are due, there is no problem with the transfer of funds that should be issued. It is heard that Chinese merchants, small banks, pledge funds, and mortgage loans have made transactions for three pairs, while transactions for six pairs are rare. Money houses have several hundred thousand and more than one million with customer help, with interest rates from 7 taels, 7 mace, and 5 fen to 8 taels and 2 mace and 5 fen. The various help and flour mills in the foreign firm street were very late in setting the transaction date. It was not agreed until yesterday. It is expected that there will be a large number of news this week.</p>
<h3>Securities Continued Two-Five-Year Market Uniquely Tends to Rise</h3>
<p>Other Bond Prices Were Weaker Than Before</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current public bond market was still clear, with a total of 13,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures were more prosperous than the weekend, but there was no large rise or fall, and the market buyers were not lonely. A total of more than 8 million yuan was traded in the Gongri. The trend of various bond prices was still flat before and after the market, generally slightly weaker than the previous day by about two or three corners. However, the July five-year futures and the continued two-five-year current month futures rose by more than one yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Marked Yarn Finally Brought Good by the Gold Price</h3>
<p>The yarn market started to fall and then rose, but the current yarn sales were flat. Although various gangs did not launch a large number of transactions, the retail business was still continuously prosperous. However, the general retail customers in the market tended to sell short, because the period gradually entered a weak market, and the sales of ten-count yarn became more and more stagnant. Therefore, the bottom was thicker, so the sellers' vision was particularly strong, but a certain giant merchant had no intention of buying in, and sold less, the attitude was still</p>
<p>Yarn also rose, it is said.</p>
<p>The human standard started to fall and then rose. The market atmosphere was very weak at the opening of the early market for the human standard, and it was still weak. By the second and third markets, the market atmosphere suddenly became tense, and each month rose by three, four, five, and seven cents. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 32,200 bales. It was found that Sunkang sold 1,500 bales, Changfeng 1,450 bales, Xincheng 1,100 bales, Gongtai 900 bales, and Shenda 850 bales. Shenda bought 1,700 bales, Yichang 1,450 bales, Tongyu 800 bales, Rongxing 900 bales, and Taixing 650 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

The market situation was flat and weak. Among the customer gangs, 115 bales were entered in the mainland, 85 bales in Jiangxi, 35 bales in Wuhu, 50 bales in Tianjin, 70 bales in Hankou, 30 bales in Shantou, 375 bales in Sichuan, and 150 bales in miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Solid and Tending to be Beautiful</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still strong. The overseas cotton market has turned up and the people's hearts are firm, and the inventory on the ground in various places is exhausted and the source is declining. Therefore, the bottom cargo in the stacks is very thin. The Hankou market price is high and hard. Therefore, Japanese merchants are tightening and are all in a bullish position. Therefore, the future of the external cotton market cannot be underestimated too much.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Rose Three to Five Cents The Hankou standard opened in the morning with American and Indian cotton rising by one or two cents. In the afternoon, the boat was tired with the yarn market, and then to the second and third markets, the price of gold rose greatly and the market atmosphere suddenly turned tense, with each month rising by two or three cents. The total transaction for the whole day was 68,000 dan. It was found that Changfeng sold 3,800 dan, Taichang 2,200 dan, Yuantai 2,200 dan, and Tongxing 1,000 dan. Jifeng bought 2,500 dan, Gongtai 2,800 dan, Yongfeng 2,400 dan, and Shenchang 1,500 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Indian Cotton Sold Clean, Market Flat</h3>
<p>English Cotton Saw a Firm Trend</p>
<p>The Bombay market fluctuated last week. The white Luo Xi for July and August delivery was firm at the beginning of the week due to speculation by speculators, but then turned down due to unfavorable overseas news and long-term settlements. However, the bottom was not sufficient, so sellers did not dare to sell as much as possible. Current sales were sluggish and transporters asked for few inquiries. There were slight inquiries from Europe and no transactions. The Far East had poor needs and the price difference was high. Indian cotton transactions were difficult to facilitate. The statistics for the last week are appended below (unit: thousand bales) 1930 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1st 2798 2603</p>

<p>Liverpool's current goods inquiries are still good. The futures market was completely dependent on the weather conditions in the United States at the beginning of the week. After the shift, the market price rose due to purchases in mainland China and Mumbai. However, the long-term settlement in May returned to fatigue. The market situation was quite dim when the market closed on Friday. Egyptian cotton fell after a period of calm and stability due to wholesale in Europe and Alexandria.</p>

<h3>Grain Rice Market Still Tends to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were only a dozen ships from various roads in Zhabei. Due to the scarcity of goods, the activity was white glutinous rice, and the top-quality goods showed a firm trend. The ordinary glutinous rice below still rose by about half a corner. The situation was very good. The arrival and sale of thin rice were close to each other and saw tightness. The special goods of Yang You were sold very well, so the market price must reach the 12-yuan mark. However, the goods in the market were very scarce. The medium-sized varieties of the Central Customs were slightly better by one corner. The purchase of Duzi Xianbu Xian was slightly better and the street sales were still acceptable. The price was also firm. However, the customer-pointed market was tired and the white Yuan Yin Hua sales were very stagnant and the trend was not strong. In addition, there were many high-quality and few secondary markets, and the market surface was similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were 20 ships arriving in the Li Road of Shanghai South. The sales in this street were active. Changxi, Su, and Tong's white glutinous rice from various machines all rose by one or two corners. The source of Nanbang's thin early rice was not strong, and only a part of the customer helped with the sales. The price rose only one corner. The Yang Du pointed out that it was rare and the sales were flat. The market was tight and the rising close was close to a ruler. Although the Bian Yuan Yin Hua sales were not smooth, it was very uneconomical compared with the inland production price. Therefore, the big market here was still firm.</p>
<h3>Flour Price Hovered Toward Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month was more firm and expensive than the previous weekend due to the fact that the foreign wheat quote was good by three or four corners. Later, it was reported that the customer was throwing foreign flour, which was handled by Gongli. The price of the Hongri brand was 2 yuan and 6 and a half corners, so people's hearts turned tired and each month fell with it. At the beginning of the afternoon, the market was extremely tired and fell about one point compared to the morning. Then, because the inland help received the gold price, it also fell and rose again. The people's hearts were stronger and it was observed that the future steps may have to be temporarily stopped. As a result, this month was smaller by one and a half points than the previous weekend. May was smaller by one point. June and July were smaller by seven li and a half. August and September were smaller by two li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Nearly Stable and Far Away</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, the market for each month was not greatly boosted because the foreign wheat quote was also good by three or four corners. However, the trend of foreign wheat seemed to be uncertain, so most of the observations were calm and the market was better by one or two points than the previous weekend. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, this month was still firm due to the thought of filling the gap. Because the distant flour market turned tired, it was slightly soft. As a result, there was no movement this month and September was one point smaller.</p>
<h3>The Longan of Shimao in the North and South Goods Has Been Out of Stock</h3>
<p>The Market May Turn Up</p>
<p>Shimao Longan was previously sluggish due to the poor market. The Zhenghao Tianhong quoted a price of less than 21 taels, but the inventory was limited and it was soon opened. After checking, the market has been out of stock for a long time and the land price has been rising, making it more difficult to fit the plan, so there is no continued arrival. According to the current calculation, the cost must be 22 taels.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Long-Spit Silk Tea Sales are Smooth and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Sichuan Long-Spit has recently become more popular due to the smoother sales of French and the rare Shanghai stock. The market price has risen sharply. A few days ago, Bailey and others entered 60 dan of Chuanhuang Factory Long-Spit at a price of 155 taels to 60 taels, which was an increase of 5 taels.</p>
<h3>Qimen New Black Tea Has Been Weighed</h3>
<p>The Market Price is 20 to 30 Yuan Higher Than Last Year</p>
<p>Since the 15th of the month, each mountain household in Qimen Black Tea has begun to pick the tea. The weather is clear and the aroma and quality are excellent. However, the number of tea shops in Qifu this year has suddenly increased by 40 to 50, and the tea shops are also operating very enthusiastically, resulting in mountain households asking for a lot of money. In recent days, the price of each dan of tender spikes collected by the tea shops in Gaotang Likou has been 140 to 50 yuan, which is 20 to 30 yuan higher than last year. The cost of each dan transported to Shanghai is 200 taels.</p>
<h3>Seafood Shrimp Roe Head Xun New Goods Have Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The old goods in Shrimp Street have long been sold. The new goods of the head Xun arrived yesterday and were sold by the trade association at 110 taels. The goods are quite good, but the body is wet. The second Xun goods will also arrive in Shanghai soon and the market will gradually loosen. Yantai crab roe has also gradually arrived recently and the selling price is 70 taels.</p>
<h3>Increased Prices for Cloth and Woolen Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Due to the uncertain opening date of the cotton cloth market at this factory, the end of the month is fast approaching, and yesterday, people's attitudes softened. However, there is still a shortage of fine cloth on the spot market, and there has been no excessive price drop. Only the "colorful ball" brand has experienced a more significant price decrease, selling for 7 taels and 5.5 mace. "Blue Double Fish" still requires 7 taels and 7 mace, "Yang Crane" 7 taels and 6.5 mace, and "Blue Chicken" has slightly dropped to 7 taels and 4 mace yesterday. The imported fine twill is softer, with "Yang Crane" at 7 taels and 5.5 mace, and "Blue Double Fish" at 7 taels and 4.5 mace. There were slight transactions on this street, while coarse cloth prices have generally fallen, with 16-pound "Five Cranes" at 8 taels, "Peony" at 7 taels and 8 mace, and 11-pound "People Clock" at 5 taels and 3.5 mace. Due to the drop in spot prices, Jardine Matheson's "Blue Striped Bleached Cloth" was sold yesterday for 8 taels and 5 mace, fulfilling urgent needs, and sales to Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Shantou, and other destinations have been particularly smooth, it is said.</p>
<p>The market for woolen piece goods has seen a slight increase in the price of scarce spot goods lately. Goods that are overstocked are invariably seeing price drops. This is largely because the customs clearance industry has not yet resumed work as the off-season approaches, so there is a great desire to sell goods that require advances. Yesterday, the "straight tribute broadcloth" of eastern goods fell again, and fine broadcloth is also quite sluggish. Only the "printed straight tribute broadcloth" once went out of stock, and yesterday it required 3 mace and 8 fen. Cotton velvet has skyrocketed, with "Black Haired Beauty" red selling for 2 mace 2 fen 7 li 5 hao, "Imperial Concubine Color" for 2 mace 2 fen, and "Chicken Model White" for 2 mace 4 fen 5 hao. Velvet such as "Moonlight Velvet," "Water Wave Velvet," and "Black Flower Velvet," which are imported from Japan, are selling very smoothly, and all brands have risen by about 5 li, it is said.</p>

<h3>Developing the Xing'an Reclamation Area</h3>
<p>A Budget of Over 10 Million Yuan Required</p>
<p>Hoping for Investment from Chinese and Foreign Individuals</p>
<p>Zou Zuohua, the commissioner for the reclamation of the Xing'an region in Northeast China, is currently in China after inspecting reclamation projects in Europe and the United States. Liu Mingjiu, the secretary-general of the Reclamation Office, and Wang Zhongshi, the director of the Agricultural Affairs Department, and others came to Shanghai to see him off. Mr. Wang Zhongshi brought a very detailed reclamation plan. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, he visited Tang Liu at the Foreign Affairs Office to inquire about the arrival date of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Inspection Group in Shanghai, intending to invite the group to inspect the reclamation area in the Northeast in the hopes of securing investment. It is said that the Xing'an reclamation area covers an area of approximately 88,000 square kilometers, with extremely rich mineral resources, especially forests, which account for about 60% of the total area. The current reclamation area has only 100,000 people and can accommodate 800,000 more immigrants. To implement the development plan, at least 10 million yuan is needed. The Northeast does not have such a large sum of money at the moment and sincerely hopes that Chinese and foreign individuals will invest there. In addition to inspecting reclamation affairs, Commissioner Zou also intends to discuss investment during his trip abroad, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Case of the U.S. Military Garrison Shooting and Wounding Sichuan Soldiers</h3>
<p>Conflict Due to Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Multiple Injuries on Both Sides</p>
<p>Result of Mediation by U.S. Warship Captain</p>
<p>The "Yibin" Steamer Has Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Yibin" steamer of the American merchant company "捷江" (Jiéjiāng) in Shanghai, which was returning to Shanghai from Chongqing, had a major conflict with the troops stationed in Yichang due to a misunderstanding during an inspection. As many as 25 soldiers stationed in Yichang were shot and wounded by American soldiers. Yesterday, the steamer had already returned to Shanghai. Our reporter made a special trip to investigate the matter from all sides and met with Anderson, the owner of the "Yibin" steamer, to record the details of the incident as follows:</p>
<p>It has been found that many steamers originally sailed directly from this port to the Sichuan River, and there was no inspection. The reason for the Sichuan army's inspection this time was that a large number of Communist Party members hijacked a merchant steamer in the Badong area earlier this month, loaded a large team of party members, and transported firearms to Yichang, attempting to disrupt the Yichang Garrison Command. Upon receiving the report, the Garrison Command immediately dispatched troops to the Three Travelers' Cave (5 miles upstream from Yichang)</p>
<p>to carry out inspections of commercial steamers to prevent communist bandits from sneaking in, and temporarily issued a notice to inform all steamer companies. When the Chongqing 捷江 Company received the news, the "Yibin" had already departed and could not be notified, so this</p>
<p>major misunderstanding of mutual shooting occurred.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding and Shooting: The "Yibin" steamer encountered an attack by communist bandits at Kuizhou (45 miles from Yichang) on the afternoon of the 8th of this month. The "Yibin" was able to escape at full speed. At 3:00 PM, when the ship arrived at the Three Travelers' Cave, there were four or more soldiers stationed at the Ping Shan Dam, ordering the ship to stop. The owner of the ship, Anderson, ordered the driver to reply to the garrison that it was permissible to dock. As the ship turned, the garrison suspected resistance to inspection and opened fire as a warning. The six American soldiers on board, including one head, also came out to return fire, and bullets flew like continuous pearls, resulting in a mutual bombardment between the two sides. At that time, all the passengers on board were hiding in the cabins, afraid to move.</p>
<p>Injuries on Both Sides: On the "Yibin" steamer, one driver was hit by four bullets in the wrist, abdomen, and head, and one manager and one American soldier were each hit by one bullet. There were a total of 200 soldiers stationed on the shore, and 25 of them were hit by bullets from the American soldiers on board. On the morning of the 9th, Guo Yizhi, the commander of the Yichang Garrison Command, sent a letter to the owner of the "Yibin" steamer, providing a list of the wounded officers and soldiers and demanding that the shipowner bear full responsibility. After the incident occurred, the ship remained in the area to prepare for negotiations.</p>
<p>Mediation by U.S. Warship: After this tragic incident of mutual bombardment occurred, the people of Yichang were very angry. The wounded on both sides were sent to the hospital for treatment. The U.S. gunboat "Tutuila," stationed in Yichang, rushed to the Ping Shan Dam upon receiving the news. On one hand, the captain, 比此少波 (Bǐcǐ Shǎobō), personally visited Commander Guo Yizhi of the Garrison Command and stated that the "Yibin" steamer had not received a clear order to inspect when it departed from Chongqing, so the captain was unaware and could not be blamed for resisting inspection. The shooting on both sides was due to a misunderstanding. In the future, ship travel should respect the garrison's inspection orders. Commander Guo, in order to settle the matter, also agreed not to make further demands, and the wounded on both sides would be treated at their own expense, without paying each other's medical expenses, and allowed the "Yibin" to sail downstream.</p>
<p>"Yibin" Arrives in Shanghai: The "Yibin" has now arrived in Shanghai and is unloading goods at the Gonghexiang Wharf. The seriously injured driver is still in the Yichang hospital. According to Captain Anderson's words to the reporter, the "Yibin" was first grounded by a reef in Changshou, and then the tragic incident occurred in the Three Travelers' Cave. There are many communist bandits in Badong. A merchant steamer hijacked by bandits two weeks ago has not yet been found. The Sichuan army is paying close attention to this case and is currently investigating it.</p>

<h3>Regarding Other News</h3>
<p>The Postal Workers' Union Declaration: The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union issued a declaration on "Postal Workers' Lack of Rights to Participate in the National Election." To all newspaper offices, public organizations, and fellow countrymen across the country: The convening of the National Assembly is in accordance with the late Premier's will and to meet the needs of the people and the country, and is an assembly for the Party and the country and the people to jointly discuss national affairs, seeking peaceful reunification internally to solve the people's livelihood problems, and abolishing unequal treaties externally to improve the international status. All sound organizations have the right to participate. Our Shanghai Postal Workers' Union has a glorious history of revolution in the past, and now it has also been approved by the Shanghai National Election Office and reported in the newspapers. However, in an instant, the Central Government issued an order stating that the organizational members of postal workers' unions in various places are complex, and before they are reorganized in accordance with the law, they do not seem to have the right to elect representatives to the National Assembly. Although we dare not say whether the organization of postal workers' unions in various places is sound and whether the members are complex, our Shanghai Postal Workers' Union has undergone several purges and reorganizations, and nine out of ten of the current executive and supervisory committee members are comrades of our party. In terms of organization, it can be called sound, and in terms of members, they are all loyal. How can it be obliterated and the right to elect be deprived on the pretext? Furthermore, our Postal Workers' Union is one of the special labor unions, so it cannot be compared with ordinary labor unions. Therefore, this association and the special labor unions in various places have repeatedly requested the Central Government to promulgate the Special Labor Union Law to follow, but the Central Government has repeatedly delayed and has not yet promulgated or approved it, resulting in the deprivation of the right to elect in the National Election. Thinking of this, it is truly painful. Moreover, the Seafarers' Union and the Railway Workers' Union are both special labor unions and are no different from the Postal Workers' Union. However, the Seafarers' Union and the Railway Workers' Union both enjoy the right to elect, while this association is deprived of the right to elect. This is extremely unfair. In short, based on the past facts of this association and the claims of conscience, driven by responsibility and not interested in the competition for rights, we do not care whether we participate in this National Assembly. Now, we must continue to demand the promulgation of the Special Labor Union Law to become a legitimate organization. We are very afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth and cause misunderstandings, so we hereby solemnly declare it to the people of the country. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, April 19, 20·4·19.</p>
<p>The Women's Petition Group: According to the 국민社 (Gúomín Shè), women from various places previously organized a petition group to petition the Central Government on the issue of demanding participation in the National Assembly. The Shanghai Women's Association appointed Ms. Lin Kecong and Ms. Shen Jingcun as representatives to go to Beijing on the 10th of this month with the women's petition representatives from various places to petition. Now that the matter is over, they returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Our reporter specially visited Ms. Lin yesterday to inquire about the situation of the petition. According to Ms. Lin, the result of this petition is still satisfactory. Although the Central Government is unable to change the issue of women's participation in the National Assembly due to the established laws and regulations, it has agreed to the request to introduce women candidates from various provinces and cities, and it will not be difficult to elect a small number of women in the future. As for the issue of attending the meeting, it is now being prepared to directly request the presidium of the National Assembly. This matter is expected to be accomplished, so the petition group has telegraphed women's organizations in various places to elect representatives to Beijing to elect representatives to attend the meeting. The reporter also inquired about the candidates for the Shanghai Women's Association to attend the People's Assembly. According to the answer, our representatives are only responsible for petitioning, and the candidates to attend the meeting in the future should be elected separately. As for myself, I am not talented and learned, and I am unable to take on this important task, so I have strongly expressed to the Women's Association that I should not be elected.</p>

<p>The Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting Tax Collection Based on Actual Rent</p>
<p>For Self-Occupied Properties, the Court Should Set Principles</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department, stating: "Regarding the case of assessing and collecting general taxes based on assessed rental value, this association believes that it has not been properly implemented and has repeatedly written to your department to request the abolition of this method. Now, the representatives of this association's general assembly have proposed a discussion, stating that the economic capabilities of the municipal government and taxpayers must be mutually considered in order to achieve the goal of coexistence and common prosperity, and it is necessary to consider the majority of residents below the middle class rather than favoring the municipal government. There is a responsibility to suppress the prices of essential goods for residents. When rice prices are soaring, the municipal government on the one hand announces price limits and on the other hand handles price equalization. The problem of residence has become extremely serious due to the monopoly and hoarding of some landlords who seek to benefit from it. Rental disputes are increasing day by day. If the Public Works Department further breaks the established rules, assessing the rental value to collect general taxes is tantamount to fueling the flames and increasing rents, further trapping residents below the middle class in a more difficult situation. The Public Works Department can use this to increase revenue without the name of increasing taxes, enjoying the reality of increasing taxes. However, the impact is that the poor are increasing day by day, and security is more likely to occur. The cost of maintaining peace and stability will inevitably increase even more, and the losses outweigh the gains can be predicted. According to the footnote on page 457 of the second volume of Municipal Science by Professor Munro, an American municipal expert, the collection of taxes based on rent is actually a British system, and the amount of rent is determined by law, and its principle is that the amount of rent actually paid by the tenants of rented houses, apartments, etc. is the basis for taxation. For other properties, the amount is estimated by taking a percentage of the current land price and a percentage of the building cost. The assessment of rental value and collection of taxes proposed by the Public Works Department is the creation of a house tax calculated based on rent, which is not even available in the UK. Moreover, according to this book, even for houses with no actual rent and self-occupied properties that must be estimated, the principles must be determined by the local court of the special zone, etc." It was unanimously decided to submit it to the executive committee for discussion and to send a letter to the Public Works Department and the Chinese board of directors, etc., for handling. Please investigate and handle it accordingly."</p>

<h3>Update on the Disaster of the Daji Ship</h3>
<p>The Truth About the Attitudes of All Parties</p>
<p>The Daji ship of the Dada Shipping Company was burned in Longjusha, Jiangbei. The number of victims, according to a guest from Zhanghuanggang in Jiangbei, is 398 bodies recovered by the Zhanghuanggang Public Security Bureau (not registered), 11 from Xinshenggang, and 5 from Xingang. Over 210 people were rescued and returned to Shanghai by specially dispatched ships and fishing boats. Due to the cold weather, 7 of those rescued died from freezing. In total, 411 people died. The bodies recovered from each port were clothed and coffined by Dada Company. The coffins are temporarily stored at the Yizhong of Langyue Township, north of Zhanghuanggang. More than 200 coffins have been claimed by family members and returned to their hometowns. Over 100 coffins are still temporarily buried in the Yizhong of that township, numbered for family members from all over to exhume and claim at any time. Regarding the handling of the aftermath for the crew members and families of the victims, the following are the opinions obtained from various parties, which are also recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Dada Company's Attitude: After the Daji ship disaster, the corpses of the victims piled up at various ports. The company, believing that most of the deceased were poor commoners, purchased a large number of coffins at the port and nearby towns to coffin the deceased. The Public Security Bureau of that port, the Shizhuang Relief Institute, and Shanghai Jishengyuan sent staff to handle the matters together with Dada Company's representative Wang Yinqing. The Jishengyuan provided travel expenses to the families of the poor civilians who claimed the coffins and returned to their hometowns. Regarding the handling of the aftermath, the director of the company's board of directors, Wang Yinqing, told a Guo Wen News Agency reporter that the company's board of directors will determine the method of compensating the crew members, such as the accountants, pilots, compradors, tea attendants, laborers, and cooks, according to their years of service and performance, so that the crew members' families can maintain their livelihoods. As for the matter of passenger casualties and requests for compensation, our company will not be responsible for the consolation money of the families of the passenger casualties, based on the old cases of the Shipping Association. On February 19, 1929, after the Zhaoshang Xinhua ship was attacked, the Shipping Association convened a meeting of all members and resolved that the consolation money for passenger casualties was not clearly stipulated by law, and there was no precedent to follow, and no one company could set a precedent. Therefore, they were not responsible for the passenger consolation money. At that time, it was also submitted to the ministry for record. The fault of our company's Daji ship fire this time lies in the soldiers' carelessness, which caused this great disaster. The company believes that most of the deceased were poor commoners. Therefore, it has spent a lot of money on recovering corpses, clothing, coffins, family accommodation, and general family repatriation expenses, totaling 20,000 yuan. The board of directors, based on an old case of the Shipping Association, cannot bear any further consolation money.</p>
<p>The Opinion of the Shipping Association: A Guo Wen News Agency reporter met with Chen Bogang, director of the Shipping Association. Chen replied that Dada Company's Daji ship had sent a letter to the association to inquire about the scope of the crew's consolation money. The association replied to the company based on Article 67 of the Maritime Commerce Law that those who are employed on the ship with a salary, regardless of their position, are all employees of the company, and those without a salary are not included in this example (Dada Company has some small laborers who do not have a salary but rely on the ship to live and make a living). It is a misunderstanding that the Shipping Association must adjudicate the handling of the families of the deceased. The association is based on the Maritime Commerce Law, and Articles 101 to 110 of Section 2 of the law state that the shipping authorities are not responsible for any injuries to passengers.</p>
<h3>German Scholars of Linguistics Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Hieldebrand Brothers</p>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reports that the two German brothers, the Hieldebrand brothers, set out from Germany five years ago to study linguistics and investigate the origins of various ethnic languages in the field. At that time, the elder brother was 23 years old and the younger brother was only 17 years old. While the average young person was paying attention to clothing and seeking romance, the two were able to devote themselves to learning and were not afraid of difficulties, traveling to various parts of Asia. They live with a particular ethnic group, learn their language, inquire about their customs, and study their history for months at a time before leaving. They have now traveled throughout Iraq, Persia, India, Annam, Guangxi, and other places. They recently arrived in Shanghai. It is said that they will stay for about a month before heading to the islands of Oceania and the Southern Ocean, hoping to complete their grand plan in another five years.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Port Affairs Should Be Handled by the Ministry</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Instructs the City Government Branch to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, based on the resolution passed by the Central Political Council last year to establish the fundamental policy of maritime administration, stipulated that all port affairs should be the responsibility of the central competent authority for implementation in order to ensure unification. Now, since the Shanghai Port Area is managed by the Public Works Bureau and the Land Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Government is instructed to have each bureau submit reports to the ministry for review on port affairs at any time or to have the ministry directly issue orders for handling.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Moth Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Workers at 37 Factories, Including the Tongyi Silkworm Moth Factory in the City, Struck Because the Employers Violated the Conditions:  The three solutions that employer and employee representatives arrived at in negotiation were reached the night before yesterday. Yesterday, work could have resumed, but the workers still didn't go back to the factory. Hearing of this, the municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Guilin to go and encourage them, and the workers didn't go back to work until the afternoon. Furthermore, when the striking workers caused trouble the day before yesterday, two freight cars from the Rongcheng Factory in Tanziwan, one freight car from the Guangdetai Factory in Miaotou, and one freight car from the Yingfeng Factory in Tanjiaqiao were destroyed by the workers.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Problems in the Western Restaurant Industry</h3>
<p>Jinlong, Zhongyang, and Hengsheng Dismiss Workers</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Convene a Meeting Today</p>
<p>There are many chefs, waiters, shop clerks, and other employees in the 14 Western restaurants in the city. There has never been a union organization. In addition to the kitchen staff, other tasks in this industry are relatively easy to learn, so employers often stop and lay off workers at will. In addition, the extra tips in this industry are also given by the employers at will and are not made public. Therefore, workers often feel that their livelihoods are at risk. Two weeks ago, workers sought to organize a Western Restaurant Workers' Union to ensure their livelihoods. Gu Youqing, Wu Shenxiang, and 31 other workers from Jinlong and Zhongyang initiated the union and elected Wu Jingchuan, Gu Youqing, Wu Shenxiang, Pu Guangyi, Lin Yi, Zhao Jinghua, Zhou Di, Zhang Yusheng, Jiang Rongsheng, Cao Zuyao, and Yao Ditang as preparatory committee members. They were preparing to apply for permission from the higher-level authorities. After the employers learned of this, they convened a meeting of the industry association and believed that the establishment of the union would hinder the industry. Therefore, they dismissed Gu Youqing, Lai Shengquan, Zhou Yonghe from Jinlong, Wu Shenxiang from Zhongyang, and Jiang Er'a from Hengsheng. On one hand, they contacted workers who had not joined the union to fill out letters of intent to withdraw from the union and published them in the newspaper. On the other hand, employees of the Atlantic sent representatives to participate in the union and made a special large silver shield to present to the workers to encourage them. The dismissed employees of Jinsheng and others were unwilling to accept this and have filed a complaint with the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting relief from the unjustified dismissal of employees. It is said that the Social Affairs Bureau has approved the request and is scheduled to convene a meeting at the bureau at 10:00 AM today for mediation.</p>

<h3>Record of Jin Chongling's Corpse Last August's Tragic Event</h3>
<p>Bought a Ticket for the Korean Ship, Mistakenly Boarded the Shanli Ship</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai, Jumped Off and Fell into the River, Drifting Away with the Waves</p>
<p>Searched Everywhere for the Body, Checked the Floating Corpse Registry</p>
<p>Hung Up a Wooden Sign, Preparing to Transport Him Back to Yunnan for Burial</p>
<p>Jin Chongling, the only son of Jin Shaowei, the brigade commander of the First Cavalry Brigade of the Provisional Cavalry Division of the Army stationed in Henan, who resided in Yiren Lane in the capital city, was 24 years old. He was married and had a daughter still in her infancy. Chongling was studying at Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, and was about to graduate. Last year, Jin Chongling took advantage of the summer vacation to pack up and return home to visit his relatives. On August 22, he purchased a cabin seat on the Korean Ship and boarded the ship with his luggage. Seeing that the ship's departure time was still early, he went ashore to say goodbye to his friends. When the departure time was approaching, Jin hurried back to the ship. Unexpectedly, in his haste, Jin mistakenly boarded the Shanli Ship at the same pier. By the time he realized it, the ship had already departed and there was no way to get ashore. Jin was extremely distressed that all his luggage was on the Korean Ship, fearing that it would be lost. He couldn't sleep or eat as a result. Later, those on the ship told him that this was a common occurrence for passengers and that he could wait for the ship to arrive in Shanghai and claim his luggage on the Korean Ship, which would not be lost. Jin finally felt a little relieved. On the 24th, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, Jin was lying in the cabin. Hearing people on the ship say that the ship had arrived in port, Jin rushed from the cabin to the deck and jumped off the ship. Unexpectedly, the ship had not yet docked, and unfortunately, he fell into the river when he jumped. At that time, the tide was receding and the current was rapid, and he disappeared in an instant. After the ship's owner heard the news, he quickly ordered the sailors to rescue him, but it was too late. Jin's mother, wife, and others had been waiting on the dock for Jin, as he had informed them in advance by letter. When the Korean Ship arrived at the port, they did not see Jin disembark and were very suspicious. They then learned that Jin had fallen into the river from the Shanli Ship, and they all cried in grief. They immediately sent people to search for the body in the Huangpu River, but could not find it anywhere. Afterward, his family sent an urgent telegram to his father, Jin Brigade Commander. After receiving the telegram while on military service, Jin was extremely saddened by the sudden death of his beloved son, but at that time, he was unable to spare himself. Therefore, he set it aside. It was not until the beginning of this month that Jin Brigade Commander was summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Beijing to discuss important matters. He took the opportunity to come to Shanghai and asked Director Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to order a search for the body. Director Chen immediately ordered Xu Jishi, the captain of the water patrol team, to send a large patrol boat to visit all parts of the Huangpu River for many days, but still no trace was found. He also sent people to inquire at the Nanshi Lifesaving Bureau, but there was no clue. Captain Xu, believing that there was no trace of it along the Shanghai coast, ordered Ding Xiaoping, the captain of the Wusong water patrol fourth detachment, to supervise the patrol boats and search all parts of the Wusong coast. He also asked Zheng Shushan, the chairman of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, to notify the ship merchants to cooperate in the search, but the results were all in vain. Finally, Captain Ding of the detachment went to the Wusong Lifesaving Bureau to inquire. He checked the bureau's floating corpse registry and found corpse number forty-two. On August 26 of last year, a body was recovered from the Huangpu River in front of the Zhanghuabang Water and Electricity Plant. The corpse grid was filled with the appearance of wearing student clothes. Captain Ding of the detachment observed that the date was quite consistent, but he could not determine whether it was Jin Chongling's corpse. He then reported the information to Captain Xu, who ordered Jin Brigade Commander to go to Song to identify it. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Captain Xu accompanied Jin Brigade Commander by car to Song. Captain Ding of the detachment led them to the Lifesaving Bureau and inquired in detail about the corpse number forty-two's age, appearance, and clothing from Gu Danchao, the standing director of the bureau. Director Gu explained in detail and took out a photo of the corpse and a package of relics, asking Jin Brigade Commander to examine them. Jin observed the photo and saw that the corpse was roughly similar, but the face was blurred and difficult to identify. Later, he examined the relics and found two small Japanese copper coins and a copper button. The surface of the button had a raised pattern with the characters "Hosei." Therefore, he determined that it was indeed his son's body without a doubt. He could not help but weep and was overcome with grief. Later, Captain Xu, Director Gu, and others persuaded him in many ways to stop crying. That afternoon, the Lifesaving Bureau sent four earthworkers to accompany Jin Brigade Commander, Captain Xu, Captain Ding, and others to the Yizhong near the Beishipai Pavilion in Wusong Town to examine the corpse coffin number forty-two. Jin Brigade Commander briefly examined it. Because Jin needed to go to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, he ordered the earthworkers to bury the coffin next to the Beishipai Pavilion, placing a brick stone on the coffin as a marker. A wooden sign was erected outside the grave with Chongling's age and origin to serve as a memorial. Then, he and Captain Xu returned to Shanghai by car. Before leaving, he explained to the Lifesaving Bureau that the remains of the coffin would be left for him to rebury and transport to his hometown of Yunnan after he had completed his official duties.</p>
<h3>Pregnant Woman Crushed to Death by Train</h3>
<p>The Corpse Was Severed into Three Sections, a Very Tragic Sight</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 6:50 AM, a rural woman was walking near the Danyang Bridge in Zhabei. At that time, a train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was traveling from west to east. The woman did not avoid it in time and was crushed to death. The deceased was Li, the wife of Xu Xuewen from Yancheng, who lived at 10 Caopeng in Huazihang. She was 39 years old and six months pregnant. After being crushed to death by the train, the corpse was severed into three sections, a very tragic sight. Wei Bocheng, who lived nearby, donated a coffin so that she could be properly buried. The area around the scene of the accident is full of slums, and ignorant rural people often die in vain under the wheels of trains. Facts such as these have already been seen countless times.</p>
<h3>How Strange, The So-Called "Muffled Cabin" Thieves</h3>
<p>Highly Organized with Extensive Scale</p>
<p>Having Titles Like Chairman and Secretary</p>
<p>Stolen Goods Worth Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>Water Police Have Already Captured Several</p>
<p>The Maritime Customs Water Police have repeatedly received reports from various foreign shipping companies that numerous large thefts of valuable cargo have occurred on outgoing ships, with losses amounting to tens of thousands. The police then ordered detectives to investigate and discovered that these thieves were known as "Muffled Cabin" thieves. Their method was to first hide in the cabin and then, late at night, collude with accomplices outside using bandit boats to steal goods. Therefore, the ship's cabins were always tightly closed, and only essential personnel could open them, which aroused suspicion. In reality, all these acts were committed by these bandits. It was also discovered that these bandits had a well-organized theft network with a head, namely the Chairman, as well as a Vice-Chairman, Secretary, Members, etc., on a grand scale. As a result of the crackdown at that time, Chen Xiaowuzi, Wu Nailian, and Dou Xiaochezi were arrested. They confessed to the police that they first stole three boxes of Belgian wool and two boxes of Huada woolen fabric from the Changjiang ship; second, they stole eleven boxes of artificial silk from the Gelun Huasi ship; and third, they stole seven boxes of silk and satin from the Xier Wu Paimu ship. They were sent to the local court for prosecution. At the same time, the water police also requested the local court to arrest their accomplices Yan Shirong, Zhang Xiaolian, Chen Erbian, Li Jinyu, and Wang Hongxi, who were also apprehended. After investigation by the court, it was determined that Yan, Zhang, Chen, Li, and Wang were not involved and were released. However, Chen Xiaowuzi, Wu Nailian, and Dou Xiaochezi were prosecuted by the prosecutor and requested to be severely punished. Yesterday, Judge Shen presided over the trial. The defendants claimed to have recanted their confessions and denied the theft, claiming that they were coerced by the detectives. However, the judge pointed out that the defendants had already confessed to the prosecutor, so why would they recant? Defendant Chen Xiaowuzi then admitted his guilt. The judge said that these three cases alone exceeded ten thousand taels of silver, indicating the scale of the thefts. As for whether the accomplices numbered in the dozens as reported by the detectives, the defendants claimed to have not been questioned. The judge then requested Prosecutor Wu to present his arguments. After the arguments were completed, the judge announced the end of the debate and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody pending judgment.</p>
<h3>Engaged as a Virgin, Married with a Son</h3>
<p>Soon After, She Absconded with Valuables</p>
<p>Fei Pinfang Sentenced to Two Months' Imprisonment</p>
<p>Gu Botang, a native of Zhenhai residing at No. 339 Hengtong Road, Zhabei, married Fei Pinfang through matchmakers Mrs. Wang Xu (also known as A Ren Niang, Tun Qiao Xiaomao, Zhang Wenqing, and Chen Yongsheng) in October of last year for a betrothal gift of two hundred yuan. At the time of the engagement, the matchmakers claimed that Fei Pinfang was a virgin. However, when she came to Gu's house, she brought a son with her, claiming that he was born from her previous marriage. Gu negotiated with the matchmakers, but in February of this year, Fei Pinfang suddenly seized an opportunity and absconded with Gu's belongings, taking her son with her. Gu realized that he had encountered a gang of tricksters and filed a criminal lawsuit with the Special District Court. The four male and female matchmakers, including Mrs. Wang Xu, were arrested and sentenced. Mrs. Wang and Qiao Xiaomao were each sentenced to two months' imprisonment, while Zhang and Chen were each sentenced to ten months' imprisonment. Meanwhile, the Special Court issued a warrant for the arrest of Fei Pinfang. She was apprehended by the bailiffs of the Special Court the other day and handed over to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was brought to trial by Judge Ge. Fei claimed that she was twenty-seven years old and a native of Songjiang. Her previous husband had died, and she remarried Gu Botang through a matchmaker last winter. She only received a wedding gift of one hundred and sixty yuan. In February of this year, she returned to Ningbo to visit her seriously ill mother and did not abscond. Judge Ge deemed the woman's statement to be entirely fabricated and immediately sentenced Fei Pinfang to two months' imprisonment for the crime of jointly defrauding property. The number of days detained before the judgment was confirmed would be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>So Inhuman, So Shameless: Forcibly Defiling a Nine-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>Zhang Youcai, a Native of Anhui, is Detestable</p>
<p>The Authorities Should Impose Severe Punishment</p>
<p>Zhang Youcai, a native of Anhui, is a tailor in Shanghai who works with Hu Sanyi, a native of Huzhou. The Hu family lives in the pavilion room on the upper floor of No. 734 Jinyi Lane, Carter Road. Hu's wife, Qian, works as a laundrywoman, and Zhang's clothes are also washed by her. Therefore, he often visits the Hu family without reservation. On the night of the 17th of this month, at 10 p.m., Hu had not returned from work, and Qian had gone out to deliver clothes, leaving only her nine-year-old daughter, A Bao, at home. Zhang suddenly brought two dragons of dirty clothes to the Hu family, asking Qian to wash them. Upon entering the room, he only saw A Bao and learned that her parents were both out. He was overcome with lust and forced A Bao onto the bed, raping her at will. The pitiful, undeveloped girl was unable to resist and could not avoid the abuse. At that moment, Qian suddenly returned from outside and saw the door tightly closed. She called out loudly, and Zhang hurriedly opened the door, his hand still on his waistband. Qian suspected something and asked him about it, but Zhang made excuses, saying that he was just teasing A Bao. Qian, considering that Zhang was almost fifty years old, assumed that he would not do anything improper and did not investigate further. After Zhang left, A Bao kept it a secret. It was not until the next afternoon, when Qian asked A Bao to fetch water, that the girl said her legs were sore and her lower body was especially painful. Qian examined her and saw bloodstains on her crotch. She questioned A Bao sternly, and A Bao finally told her what had happened. Qian confronted Zhang, but he stubbornly denied it, leading to a quarrel. A Chinese constable from No. 2346 saw this and took them to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. After questioning by the head constable, Zhang still denied it, claiming that he had a venereal disease and could not approach women. The head constable then sent detectives to take Zhang and A Bao to the hospital. The doctor confirmed that A Bao had indeed been defiled. Moreover, Zhang Youcai's genitals were not only normal but also infected with venereal disease, which had already been transmitted to the girl. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Zhang to the Special District Court, where Judge Ge Zhiqin interrogated him. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested that the defendant be punished according to Article 240, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law. Hu Qian stated that when she confronted the defendant the day before, he offered her ten yuan as medical expenses, but she refused, leading to a quarrel. However, the bloodstained trousers had been taken away and hidden by a fellow villager of the defendant. She requested a strict investigation. The defendant insisted on denying everything. Judge Ge ordered Zhang Youcai to be detained pending further investigation by the court's forensic doctor.</p>
<h3>The Chenguang Art Society Will Hold a Regular Exhibition</h3>
<p>Opening on the 25th at the Shanghai Art College</p>
<p>The Chenguang Art Society is an art group with a long history. It has not held exhibitions for a long time since 1925. It is now learned that the society has decided to hold its 5th exhibition at the Shanghai Art College located at the intersection of Jiangwan Road and Tongji Road from the 25th of this month (Saturday) to the 3rd of next month (Wednesday). This exhibition will feature works by Zhu Yingpeng, Chen Baoyi, Wang Daoyuan, Qiu Daiming, Fang Ganmin, Li Jinfu, Song Zhiqin, Wang Rongjun, Chen Qiuzhang, Pan Sitong, Zhang Meisun, Xu Suling and other writers, and female writers including Guan Zilan, Wang Shuren, Weng Yuanchun, Lu Xiaoxia and other ladies. Emerging writers such as Yang Qiuren, Du Shiqi, Zeng Zhiliang, Yu Zaisheng, Hua Fuyang, and others will also be exhibiting. There are over 30 exhibitors with about 100 works. The expressions of each writer have a nationalist tendency, which truly opens a new era in Chinese painting. In this bright spring season, such a large-scale and era-defining art exhibition is presented before our eyes, and the grand occasion at that time can be predicted. The society's announcement is attached below. The society was established in 1920 and has been around for twelve years. In the early years, due to the joint efforts of comrades, we asked ourselves that we had made some contribution to the development of art, and the impression left on society may still be remembered by some people. The society held its first exhibition in the spring of 1921 at Huaien Hall on Sichuan Road, the second exhibition in the spring of 1922 at Bansong Garden, the third exhibition in the spring of 1923 at the former site of the society on Baker Road, the fourth exhibition in the spring of 1924 at the Oriental Art School on Pubai Road, and a practice exhibition in the autumn at the former site of the society on Hado Road. A literary and art lecture was held in the summer of 1925 at the Nanguang Commercial School on Luban Road. After 1925, because China's politics showed drastic changes, there were special developments in the history of the revolution. The Nationalist Government's Northern Expedition and the revolutionary forces occupied the north and south of the Yellow River in a very short period of time. Because of the great changes of this era, our comrades were striving for national independence, and their common goals tended to be consistent. Therefore, they went to various revolutionary troops to take on political work. Only a few comrades remained in Shanghai, and the suspension of all cultural undertakings during the military period was inevitable. Therefore, our annual exhibition could not meet with the public as scheduled. Now that the military situation has been settled and the north and south are unified, the comrades have long since returned from their military service to participate in the initial work of the revolution. The experience of the struggle at that time has only left some memories for leisure time. In the past two years, the comrades have mostly lived in difficult economic conditions, making it difficult to concentrate on art research. Our planned exhibition had to be postponed again and again until today when we meet you. We are really ashamed. In today's era of great changes, the nation is struggling and striving every day. Art is the performance of life, especially closely related to the future of the nation. This is generally recognized by informed people and does not need to be mentioned. Therefore, our art, due to the needs of the times, on the one hand, must express our nation's folk thoughts and national sentiments, and on the other hand, exclude all thoughts that hinder the nation's progress, promote the nation's upward development of will, express the history of national struggle to awaken national consciousness and form a new life of the nation. This is the goal we have jointly established. In our past exhibitions, our products have already shown the beginning of this consciousness. Now, based on our proposition, we will select a part of the works we have obtained in the past few years to open the 5th exhibition. We dare not say that we have achieved any results, but we hope that in the field of art, a new path will emerge from this tendency. We are very willing to accept all aspects of guidance and criticism, and even more hope that people from all walks of life will support us so that we can continue to work hard in the long run. We are especially grateful.</p>
<h3>Rampant Pirates Off Wusong Estuary Joint Suppression by Water and Land Authorities</h3>
<p>Due to the rampant pirates in the Sanjia and Lvsi areas outside the estuary, Wu, the director of the Wusong Paotaiwan Coastal Defense Office, specially dispatched the Cheng Sheng and Yi Sheng patrol ships yesterday to suppress them. Zhang, the district chief of the Wusong Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, dispatched the Ce Dian and Jun He warships to join the suppression. The Jiangsu Provincial Security Regiment dispatched a machine gun team, and the Navy Department of the National Government dispatched the Tong Ji warship to jointly suppress them, hoping to eliminate them as soon as possible. The reason for this large-scale suppression by the water and land military police authorities is that the fish market in the ports outside the sea is currently in full swing, and the pirates are taking the opportunity to loot, which not only hinders shipping but also has a significant impact on national tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Renting Houses to Set Up Temples to be Banned by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang of the Shanghai Municipal Government, believing that the monks and Taoists in the urban area are renting houses to set up temples and promote superstition, ordered a ban, limiting them to be closed down by the end of last year. Subsequently, the Buddhist Association requested an extension of three months. Just as the Municipal Government was about to order the Public Security Bureau to send police to enforce the ban, the monk Shouzhen of Kunlu Temple in this city, together with the abbots and monks of all the temples rented in the city, submitted a request to withdraw the order. After reading the request, Mayor Zhang believed that the case was related to banning superstition and could not be stopped immediately. However, considering the sincerity of the monks' request, he temporarily granted another month's extension until the end of April, when all of them should be closed down. As the deadline is approaching, he specially ordered the directors of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to comply and immediately send police to enforce the ban if the temples continue to ignore the order. Recently, the monks in the urban area of the city who are renting houses to set up temples are trying to relocate.</p>
<h3>The Young Owner of a Sock Factory is Sued Again</h3>
<p>Shen Meimei and Her Mother Accuse Him of Defamation</p>
<p>Seeking Compensation for Damages, First Requesting Mediation</p>
<p>Zhong Xiaoqi, the young owner of a Guangdong sock factory, was sued in the Special District Court by Shen Zhu, the mother of Shen Meimei, a minor girl from Suzhou, for enticing her. The case was handled by lawyer Shen Xingxia. After investigation, Zhong Xiaoqi was sentenced to one year in prison, as reported in this newspaper. However, Zhong did not accept the verdict and is currently appealing. Shen and her mother, however, due to Zhong Xiaoqi's arbitrary defamatory statements during the two trials in the Special Court, such as saying that Meimei had done business in the Lehui Lane Qingfeng and Minhe Lane Aiyue brothels, believed that it damaged the reputation of a girl from a good family. Therefore, they hired lawyer Shen again to sue him, requesting that he be convicted according to Article 328 of the Criminal Law and that, according to Article 333 of the same law, the plaintiff be allowed to publish all or part of the verdict in newspapers when the case is judged in the future. The Special Court issued a summons to the defendant according to the complaint, but it is still unknown when the trial will be scheduled. Furthermore, in the previous case in which Shen and her mother sued Zhong for enticement, they originally filed a private lawsuit seeking compensation for losses of 3,895 yuan. After the enticement verdict, the losses were directed to be pursued independently in the civil court. Shen's lawyer has also filed a separate complaint requesting a preliminary mediation. If a mediation can be reached, further litigation can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Chen Jinnan Has Been Missing for Two Months</h3>
<p>Chen Jinnan, the son of Chen Adi of Chenjia Ferry in the west of Shanghai, is currently 18 years old. Chen Adi had only this one son by three concubines. Adi died when Jinnan was eight years old, leaving behind a few acres of thin fields, enough to provide a meager living. Jinnan was raised by his mother. At the age of fifteen, he was introduced by a friend to work as a waiter in a large restaurant in Shanghai. Jinnan learned fashion and became promiscuous in Shanghai. He suddenly disappeared two months ago. His mother has been searching everywhere but has found no trace of him. Yesterday, she reported the case to the police station, requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>Key Suspect in Murder Case Handed Over</h3>
<p>The case of Qiao Shidang, the son of Qiao Zhenyu of Xietu Road in the west of Shanghai, who was murdered and his body moved to the roadside, has been investigated. The cause of the case is that a woman named Shen A Bao was known for being promiscuous. She first had an affair with Qiao Shidang, and they were engaged. However, Shidang's mother did not agree and arranged for Shidang to marry another woman. Shen A Bao's hopes were dashed, so she had an affair with Chen Sannan. However, Qiao Shidang was very unhappy, and jealousy flared up several times. Therefore, Chen Sannan intended to murder him. A Bao and others lured Qiao away, got him drunk, and then Wang Shengcai, Lu Yinjiang, and others beat Qiao to death. Lu and A Bao have been detained by the Second District and handed over to the court. At the same time, the court has also dispatched police to track down and arrest Chen and Wang for investigation.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing in the Case of Water Police Captain Beating a Man to Death</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhaoxiang, the captain of the detective team of the Fourth District of the Water Police, beat boatman Lu Agen to death. The circumstances of the case have been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that this case has been investigated and clarified by Prosecutor Yang Qi, who has prosecuted Zhang and stated that Zhang, as a public official, should be punished more severely for killing a civilian. Yesterday, this case was heard in court by Judge Wu. Zhang claimed that Lu Agen died on March 28th. In the morning, he went to Shanghai with a Japanese friend and took a car to Daminjie, got off and had lunch at Xinbeimen. The car bill was signed by the Japanese person. The judge asked how you could prove it if you didn't sign it yourself. At this point, witness Lu Genxiang claimed that he was a cook on the boat. On March 28th, because there was a shortage of cotton on the boat, Lu Agen asked Zhang Zhaoxiang to go and see it. Unexpectedly, he was slapped and punched several times. He died at 9:00 p.m. that night. Zhang Adong testified that he was a boatman and that his testimony was the same. Lu Yang testified that the deceased was her grandson and that she depended on him for food. On March 28th, he returned home and said to me, "Grandma, save me. I was beaten by the captain surnamed Zhang." He died shortly after leaning on me, asking for justice. Lu Liu testified that the deceased was her husband and that her husband was beaten to death by Captain Zhang, who spat blood from his mouth and died on the spot. The judge believed that it was necessary to summon witnesses in this case and ordered a postponement for further trial. Zhang was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Chen A Xi was Hit and Killed by a Tram</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 3 p.m., tram No. 21 of the French Concession Route 5, pulling a carriage, was returning from the North Railway Station to Ximen. Just as it arrived near Fangbang Bridge, Chen A Xi, a native of Zhenjiang residing behind the Gonghe Cinema there, suddenly ran across the road and was hit by the tram. He immediately lost consciousness. Xu Xiankai, the police officer No. 5 of the Second District General Administration stationed there, checked the scene and immediately copied down the driver's name and number. He then sent Chen by car to Shanghai Hospital. Due to the severity of the injuries, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Wang, the district chief, immediately summoned the driver for preliminary interrogation. According to his statement, his name was Cao Yueqiu, 31 years old, a native of Yancheng, currently residing at No. 3427 Yunhua Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, and working as driver No. 206 for the French Tram Company. He stated that the accident was caused by the deceased's carelessness in trying to cross the road. He asked for an investigation. District Chief Wang immediately ordered the local security to report to the court for verification. It was found that the deceased was only 38 years old, currently unemployed, wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, bald, and blind in one eye. The body is temporarily placed in Shanghai Hospital pending verification.</p>
<h3>The Litigation of the Chang'e Dance Hall Lease</h3>
<p>Fang Jiaohui hired a lawyer to represent him in the French Concession Court to criminally accuse him, saying that the Chang'e Yueji Dance Hall, formerly the National Hotel, located at No. 29 Tianzhutang Street under his jurisdiction, was originally leased by Lu Xihou to Zhang Shangxun for business. Because Zhang had no intention of operating it, he subleased the hall to the plaintiff on March 9 for continued operation and changed the brand to Maoji Dance Hall. The two parties signed a contract with a transfer price of 3,100 yuan. At that time, the defendant Lu Xihou also expressed his agreement and asked Lu to publish it in the newspaper on his behalf. Unexpectedly, just sixteen days after the lease, several strangers broke in, each wielding a pistol, and forcibly forced the plaintiff's employees to leave the house immediately, sealing all the belongings. Despite repeated negotiations, nothing was achieved. Just as Fang Jiaohui and Zhang Shangxun went to our law firm to entrust our lawyer to draft a complaint for litigation, Zhang Shangxun, the plaintiff, not only failed to appear during the summons but also submitted a statement alone requesting the cancellation of the case, which is extremely absurd. Moreover, there is a power of attorney to prove that Zhang Shangxun entrusted our lawyer to file the lawsuit. How can he now request the cancellation of the case without authorization? It is obvious that there are other circumstances. However, with regard to the first plaintiff, Fang Jiaohui, being colluded and forcibly coerced by the defendant and others to prevent him from operating the business, he committed the crime of fraud. In addition to requesting an investigation, he also sought compensation in a private lawsuit. The defendant Lu Xihou did not appear, and his lawyer appeared on his behalf to argue that the ownership of the dance hall has always belonged to our client. Since he leased it to Zhang Shangxun last year, Zhang terminated the lease with Lu Xihou due to poor business. The lease contract signed by the plaintiff Fang Jiaohui with Zhang Shangxun should be sued against Zhang and has nothing to do with our client. Please investigate. Judge Zhu ordered a postponement for further verification.</p>
<h3>Entanglement in the Joint Establishment of a Club</h3>
<p>Sold Without Authorization Midway</p>
<p>The Plaintiff Was Not Willing</p>
<p>A Russian named Ming Kejinfu hired lawyer Tikebeke to represent him in the French Concession Court to accuse him, saying that the plaintiff and the defendant Kelai jointly established a Polish club in April last year. The two parties signed a contract with a total capital of 7,000 yuan. The plaintiff should be responsible for 5,000 yuan, and the defendant should pay 2,000 yuan. At that time, because the defendant was unable to pay, the plaintiff paid on his behalf. Later, the plaintiff left Shanghai due to business matters, and all the general affairs of the club were entrusted to Kang Kelai. Now that the plaintiff has returned to Shanghai, he learned that the defendant sold the general association to someone surnamed Mou in September last year, embezzled the funds, and ignored the plaintiff's principal. The defendant committed the crime of embezzlement and requested an investigation. The defendant also hired lawyer Plaimei to argue on his behalf, saying that this case involves a dispute over accounts and is entirely a civil matter. The plaintiff should not accuse him criminally. However, since the association was established, it violated the police regulations, so the police intervened and stopped it, so it was announced to be liquidated, and a third party was found to reorganize it. Meanwhile, the defendant mortgaged all the assets to a certain bank and did not sell them privately. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that the association has a certain chapter for banning. If it is handled according to the chapter, the police will definitely not intervene. Now, because the defendant violated the chapter's scope, it was banned by the police. This responsibility should be borne by the defendant. Judge Zhu ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Regiment Soldier Robbed and Killed</h3>
<p>The Dong Local Tyrant's Family was Robbed</p>
<p>Tao Honggang Died</p>
<p>Tao Honggang and three sharp members of the Zouxiaqiao Security Regiment in the Zhengtuo District outside Wusong Estuary carried two Mauser pistols, took off their uniforms, sneaked out, and broke into the home of Dong Shihao, a resident of Zhangjiaqiao Kuaiku, west of Motou Town, demanding 200 yuan. A neighbor learned of this and immediately reported it to the nearby Shijiazhuang Public Security Police Station and the Security Regiment Headquarters. Captain Zhao Runxiang sent a team to arrest them together with the police. Upon arriving at the scene, they saw three people coming towards them, looking flustered. Captain Zhao immediately ordered them to stop and searched them. The three people saw that the situation was not good and opened fire with Mauser pistols. The police and regiment also drew their guns and fired back, killing Tao Honggang on the spot. The other two escaped due to the darkness. Yesterday morning, a team was dispatched again to investigate and track them down.</p>
<h3>Arrested Multiple Thieves, Seized Military Arms</h3>
<p>Jiang Yousheng, a native of Shandong, was stealing in Shanghai. On Saturday morning, he went to the Tongyuchun Teahouse on Nanjing Road alone to drink tea. Someone recognized him and reported it to the Huishi Police Station. Detective Ding Baoxiang and Zhang Bingcheng rushed to arrest Jiang. According to his confession, there were accomplices hiding in a certain association at No. 492 Male Lane, Chongqing Road. They then secretly went to continue to arrest Zhang Dian, Jia, Li Xinmin, Lu Meisheng, Li Yuxiang, and other four people. Zhang then confessed that there were military arms hidden in the residence of Song Jinzhi at No. 397 near the association. They then went to the address to arrest Song and seized a pistol and several bullets. Song also confessed that there were guns and bullets hidden in the home of Bao Xiaosan at No. 384 next door. The detectives then copied three pistols and 33 bullets from Bao's wardrobe and brought them back to the police station together with Bao. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Ge interrogated them and ordered them to be detained for further investigation. It is said that Bao is a member of the theater circle and currently belongs to the Gengxin Stage, specializing in singing Damingxi.</p>

<p>At around 6 a.m. yesterday morning, the Guanghua Printing Factory located at No. 1168 near Xinwen Zha Road, Datong Road, suddenly caught fire. The Xin Zha Fire Brigade, upon receiving the news, immediately drove to the scene and tried its best to put out the fire. About an hour later, the fire was extinguished. When the fire was raging, two apprentices were unable to escape and were buried in the fire. Later, the firefighters pulled out the charred bodies, which were horrific to see. One body was found on the floor downstairs, while the other was found in a corner of the house.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau to Mediate Customs Broker Strike Today</h3>
<p>Summoned Labor and Management Representatives for Questioning Yesterday</p>
<p>Over eight hundred workers from the East-West Foreign Goods and Local Cotton Cloth customs brokerage industries have been on strike for several days, fighting for their original vehicle fare, and the issue remains unresolved. Yesterday morning, the Social Bureau summoned representatives from both labor and management for questioning, but no agreement was reached. Details of yesterday's events are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Questioning: At 10:00 AM yesterday, customs broker representatives Su Houxin, Ren Xinxiang, Sun Dong, Wang Wenzhong, Zhou Juxing, and He Yuqin arrived at the Social Bureau for questioning. Chen Songyuan, representing the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, also arrived on time. Guo Yongxi presided over the questioning. The results were as follows: (1) The customs brokers' customary vehicle fare of three dimes and four cents per item should continue to be paid by the cotton cloth merchants as before. (2) The customs brokers' loading and unloading area is defined as from Yangjingbang in the south to the Mitsubishi Company outside Baidu Bridge in the north. If customs brokers are required to transport goods outside this defined area, they should be paid a corresponding additional vehicle fare. (3) The customs brokers should resume work immediately. The labor representatives found these terms satisfactory, but Chen Songyuan, representing the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, refused to accept them, resulting in no agreement. Subsequently, the Social Bureau decided to conduct formal mediation again at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<p>Situation of Goods Accumulation: Approximately two thousand summer goods from East-West foreign firms and one thousand pieces of cotton cloth are stockpiled in warehouses in this port. Most of these goods are intended for shipment to Chongqing, Yichang, Hankou, and other areas along the Yangtze River, as well as Tianjin, Niuzhuang, Fengtian, and other areas in North China. Summer goods are highly time-sensitive, and prolonged strike action could cause delays, particularly for goods destined for those locations. Businesses are extremely eager to resolve the strike quickly and resume shipping. According to a trade union investigation, merchants, including the Sichuan Business Public Welfare Association, Sanshan Guild Hall, Shunzhi Guild Hall, and Shandong Guild Hall, have already sent letters to the Cotton Cloth Trade Association and the Customs Broker Association, pledging to uphold the workers' original vehicle fare.</p>
<p>Customs Broker Union Declaration: The Customs Broker Union issued a declaration to all labor unions and public organizations in the city yesterday, stating: "The Cotton Cloth Trade Association's forced deduction of vehicle fares and inspection fees has triggered a city-wide strike by customs brokers. The authorities, fearing the expansion of the strike and its impact on commerce, appointed Mr. Guo Yongxi to mediate fairly to prevent delays. The authorities summoned both parties twice, instructing the Cotton Cloth Trade Association to maintain the status quo. However, the association... (omitted section) ...published unfounded reasons in the newspapers, claiming that the vehicle fare was paid by the customs brokers or the cotton cloth merchants as a 'bad practice.' Such arguments are laughable to informed observers. This fare has a long history, and traditionally the seller pays it. If the association knew it was a 'bad practice,' why did it not push to have it handed over to the customs brokers decades ago? Now, it suddenly uses excuses and makes unreasonable demands, attempting to force the customs brokers to join the vortex and create division between labor and management to serve its own interests. Fortunately, the executive committee members of the Customs Broker Association are aware of this tactic and have not been swayed. (omitted section) It is important to know that the customs brokers' workers receive this vehicle fare for transporting goods on behalf of the Cotton Cloth Trade Association. Buyers pay a regulation fee of 3 dimes and 4 cents per item, but our workers only receive 1 dime and 5 cents to 4 dimes. Is the regulation fee of 3 dimes and 4 cents sufficient to cover the aforementioned amounts? It is clear that the Cotton Cloth Trade Association exploits our workers' profits. Now, it is further intensifying its efforts to eliminate the sweat and blood money of our workers. The authorities, considering the importance of the customs brokerage industry to transportation, are unwilling to allow the strike to continue and have fairly mediated the dispute, issuing an order on the 17th instructing both parties to immediately restore the status quo. However, the Cotton Cloth Trade Association is stubborn and has obstructed the resumption of work for our workers. We sincerely hope that all labor unions and public organizations in the city will speak out for justice, judge right from wrong, and rescue our hundreds of workers from this dire situation. We will be eternally grateful. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Association Statement: The Cotton Cloth Association submitted a statement to the Social Bureau yesterday, explaining the breakdown of negotiations: "Statement regarding the customs brokers' refusal to release goods, leading to the breakdown of negotiations, requesting the summoning of the Transportation Customs Broker Association and the Customs Broker Union to sign a public agreement to resolve the dispute. Since receiving the instructions from the Bureau, the association has, in order to protect the authority of the Bureau and prevent permanent disputes, proposed various legitimate conditions to the Customs Broker Association for the negotiation of a public agreement to seek a peaceful resolution, given the complexity of the case and the many issues beyond the vehicle fare. However, after days of negotiation, the customs brokers refused to release goods, which is their only due duty, indicating their unwillingness to comply. We have no choice but to declare a breakdown. We hereby request the Bureau to promptly summon the Transportation Customs Broker Association and the Customs Broker Union to sign a public agreement to avoid disputes and maintain commerce, and to prevent public anxiety."</p>

<h3>Record of the Chengzhi Lane Tenant Meeting</h3>
<p>The rent dispute in Chengzhi Lane on Route de la Concession Française has been ongoing since the tenants hired a lawyer to sue the French Concession Municipal Council for rent reduction and return of subletting fees. After two trials, the date for the court's pronouncement has arrived. The original introducer notified the tenants to verbally announce that a satisfactory solution had been reached and invited them to the lawyer's office to publicly announce the court's pronouncement. However, the main text of the judgment only stated that the old tenants would be given a one-month rent concession and that the rent reduction issue should not be discussed. The tenants were disappointed that the judgment was inconsistent with the original complaint and agreed to convene a meeting of all tenants from over twenty shops, including Wanlong Sauce Garden, Tianjitang Pharmacy, Panxinglong Clock Shop, and Da Zhonghua Laundry Company, to discuss relief measures. Tao Ran, the manager of Tianjitang, was elected chairman, and Li from Da Zhonghua was elected secretary. Several resolutions were passed as follows: (1) The Chengzhi Lane Tenants Association was formally established, and Tao Ran of Tianjitang, Jin Wenbi of Wanlong Garden, Wu Ziqin of Europe, Xiang Liren of Da Zhonghua, and Tong Jun of No. 3 were elected as committee members. Tao Ran was elected as the executive chairman to be responsible for various matters. (2) The original representatives should be urged to require Attorney Zheng to continue the appeal in order to achieve the goals of rent reduction and return of subletting fees. (3) Before the goals are achieved, all tenants should uniformly stop paying rent and deposit the rent due from this month into the Bank of China. Tianjitang, Wanlong, and Europe shops should be appointed to keep the passbook and seals. (4) A public declaration should be issued to request assistance from various public organizations. (5) Representatives from all sectors should be invited to report on the beginning and end of the case on a regular basis. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Record of the Shoufu Lane Tenants' Association Meeting</h3>
<p>The tenants of Shoufu Lane on Route du Marché, French Concession, organized the Tenants' Association to oppose the Yong'an Real Estate Company's massive rent increase and the forced signing of lease contracts. Negotiations with the landlord have been ongoing for several months without resolution. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the tenants held a general meeting with over thirty tenants attending. Sun Jianqing was elected chairman. The chairman first reported that the association's chief representative, Mr. Yang Zhengyong, had discussed several items with the landlord's representative. The landlord insisted on a 30% rent increase, but the rent increase date was extended to March. The setting up of a doorman and the repair of the water taps in the lane would be handled. The chairman then reported on how to deal with this and asked for discussion. The tenants expressed their opinion that the increase was too large and the following resolutions were passed: (1) A rent increase of up to 10% to 15% would be recognized. Anything beyond this would be difficult to accept. (2) Since the tenants had retreated, the landlord should be requested to implement the rent increase from July to show mutual concession. (3) There would be no further rent increases within ten years of this rent increase. (4) The above methods should be negotiated with the landlord by chief representative Yang. If the landlord does not agree, they should insist until the goal is achieved. (5) The tenants reported that the lane's doorman had privately torn down all the slogans posted by the association and threatened the tenants. It was discussed how to deal with this. It was resolved that the doorman would be questioned and that the customary gratuities and tips demanded would be canceled from this month. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor: The statement in your newspaper on April 19 that "the court did not allow the autopsy of the bodies of the bandits" is completely untrue and should be corrected: (1) This matter falls within the scope of the Forensic Medicine Practice Institute affiliated with Tongde Medical College and has nothing to do with Tongde Hospital. Our college has a contract with the Jiangsu High Court to establish a forensic medicine training institute, and the judicial authorities supply unclaimed bodies of executed criminals for forensic autopsy. The Shanghai District Court and the Second Prison have also repeatedly complied with orders from the High Court in this regard. (2) On the 17th, our college received a phone call from the Second Prison informing us that there were two unclaimed bodies and that the court had approved their delivery for autopsy, instructing us to collect them immediately. We prepared a document to collect them and received temporary permission from the prison to collect them for autopsy. (3) At that time, because our college had not yet received the official document from the court, it seemed that the procedure was slightly inconsistent with the autopsy regulations. On the morning of the 18th, we were about to prepare a document to apply for this document when we suddenly received a letter from the prison informing us that the families of both corpses had requested their return and had sent a representative to collect them. Also, on the afternoon of the same day, we received a letter from the Shanghai District Court informing us that we should wait for the prosecutor's document to arrive before performing the autopsy. Fortunately, our college was careful with the procedure and had not yet started the operation. We immediately handed over the two corpses to the representative from the prison for their own examination and collection. We hereby express our best wishes. Sincerely, Tongde Medical College, April 19th.</p>

<h3>Anxious</h3>
<p>--- Seer</p>
<p>Our future life is a life of "eating powder ashes", but this kind of life is not an easy task. This is what the experienced ones tell us, so we have to redouble our efforts to cultivate the tools of our life and embrace this concept. How can we not ravage and destroy that ignorant blackboard—the chalk words on the blackboard are densely layered, slightly revealing its flesh, sometimes changing its dark clothes into a snow-white dress, as if they were being bleached. Students with weak eyesight may mistake it for a white board that has changed color.</p>
<p>That day, as soon as I stepped into the classroom, all the classmates who frequented the blackboard were not around it, scribbling and wiping randomly. I only saw a few lines of poetry revealed in the middle of the blackboard, which read:</p>
<p>Recorded a five-character new-style poem by Li Bai</p>
<p>Please people to have dinner at night</p>
<p>Accompany guests to dance halls</p>
<p>Assume the responsibility of moral education</p>
<p>Movement, election person</p>
<p>Object ugly its special extremely</p>
<p>X thief can't be tolerated</p>
<p>Secret - movement election - ugly kill</p>
<p>These few lines of poetry vaguely caught my eye. My fragile heart hesitated and suspected, but after all, I couldn't figure it out. But the general students were laughing and giggling at this new poem, as if they had guessed who it was satirizing and were proud of it. I wanted to ask the laughing student next to me, but the bell for class rang very anxiously, warning that class was about to start. At the same time, that student went out.</p>
<p>Five minutes after the bell rings, the teacher does not come to lecture, and students can freely dismiss class. This is the school's usual course of attending class. Time is easily wasted, and four minutes of great time are dead. The figure of the director of moral education, who is usually our model and never late, has not yet arrived. There is no chance to listen respectfully to his X-ist knowledge. Therefore, some students who cherish time say, "If you are late for one minute, the whole class will have to sacrifice a lesson. Now that it is nearly five minutes, we have lost five lessons of teaching in total. If there are an average of seven lessons every day, then today's curriculum has been buried on the road to 5/7 dead, how lamentable!" Some people who are dissatisfied with his professor say, "He cannot have a deep understanding of the Party's meaning, and he speaks a difficult Jiangbei language, so he speaks not only without energy, no system at all, but also makes people vomit for three days after listening. It is better to hope that he will not come." Some suggested dismissing the class. As a result, some students ran outwards, some sat at the table waiting expectantly, some whispered and gossiped, and some talked triumphantly and clapped their hands. It was unusually lively. After a while, the students who had already walked outside, thinking of escaping class, stopped their progress and rushed to the classroom in succession. The sound of leather shoes hitting the floor, "xi ge xi ge", and the sound of "coming, coming" from their lips and teeth, responded to each other. The noise in the classroom gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>Soon enough, he - a certain director, with a forced smile and a pale face, quickly walked into the classroom. We all stood up and bent our waists at ninety degrees to salute him respectfully, but he nodded slightly and began to call the roll.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't scribble on the blackboard..." A certain director said to us with dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>"Such scribbling is the only condition for cultivating our future life. Have you forgotten our original intention of studying?" Student Zhang unintentionally argued.</p>
<p>"Huh? Did you write these new poems?" The director asked Student Zhang with a stern face.</p>
<p>"No, no, I don't know."</p>
<p>"You still say you don't know? Quickly say..."</p>
<p>"You still don't admit your guilt, shameless ugly person! I have always admired you very much and have promised to move to Central University to build you up to a high level. I can be said to be benevolent and righteous to you. You horse who harms the group, please go out and don't come to my class again."</p>
<p>"You are really wrong, terribly wrong. It's okay for you to ask me to go out or stay here, it's up to your authority. But I am a weak person, and I hope you don't bully the weak."</p>
<p>"You are really extremely stubborn and say that I am bullying the weak? Get out, get out!"</p>
<p>At this time, the director was grinding his teeth, demonstrating fiercely to Student Zhang. Student Chou, who was standing, said with a humorous tone, "Don't wrongly accuse people of wronging the weak. What does this new poem have to do with you that you insist on pursuing now? I will tell you straight, the author is the Tang Dynasty poet Li Taibai, and the writer is a recent young man who stole his life."</p>
<p>"What's the intention? Please tell me." He still stubbornly questioned Student Chou.</p>
<p>"There is no intention, if you want to know the meaning, please ask the poet." Student Chou replied with a smile.</p>
<p>At that time, a few bookworms who loved time could no longer remain silent. Student Wan said adventurously and boldly, "This question may be a personal question and should not be discussed during our regular class time. Please do not waste our irreversible time. Please pay attention."</p>
<p>From an objective point of view, this kind of request should of course have a response, but the ridicule of this new poem did irritate the director twelve thousand times. How to turn this irritating irritation into silence, how not to make the director angrily say, "You are naughty enough! Please tell me the intention..."</p>
<p>"Can you understand it? If not, please ask the poet."</p>
<p>"Naughty, unteachable barbarians, get out quickly..."</p>
<p>"If you want me to say it, it is very embarrassing, especially for everyone to know, so I won't say it."</p>
<p>As soon as that happened, he - a certain director, immediately had red ears, erect hair, and a pale, bloodless face, trembling and reluctantly said, "What's so embarrassing? You must tell me the reason, otherwise, please have the principal remove your name, and you will regret it."</p>
<p>"Sacrificing for justice is not a big deal, but..."</p>
<p>"Disrupting the classroom, despising teachers..." He only said these few words, and then he sobbed and left the classroom.</p>
<p>"The matter of smearing the blackboard made him leave in hatred. Could it be</p>
