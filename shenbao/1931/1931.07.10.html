<p>萬寳山案發生以後。日人仍迄不覺悟。一若深慮無以益我國人悲憤。增我國人對日惡感。更暗示韓人襲擊我旅韓僑胞。據連日報載。韓平壤漢城仁川濟物浦元山津釜山以及各城巿都發生韓暴民慘殺我僑胞劇烈排華之風潮。死傷及損失至多。事態至爲嚴重。受襲擊之僑胞多逃歸與韓接境之我遼屬安東避難。迨韓人襲擊之目的旣巳達到。乃故意派警彈壓。日閣議且决議撫恤我被難僑胞。嚴懲韓暴民。此種故弄玄虚之外交僞術。日人或自以爲可以掩盡天下人之耳目。其實心跡與真相。早巳昭然若揭。日人必欲冒天下之大不韙。再四造出令人忍無可忍之慘劇。吾人抑又何言。將來萬案擴大至若何程度。此時固難預斷。或者能就此結束。擱爲懸案。亦未可知。但日人旣有如此决心。則未來之歲月。當不知更有若干倍嚴重於萬案之事態發生。吾人極目前途。痛外侮之方亟。傷國難之正殷。悲憤之情。莫能自抑。着筆至此。真爲之涕泗滂沱。嗟我國人。其亦應有同感丶（未完）</p>

<p>先往南洋一帶比賽丶回來適可赴美丶藉此綀習丶同時籌備赴美經費丶因爲數可觀丶如每隊員以一千美金計丶當在一萬五六千金之上丶故頗希望</p>
<h3>政府能予以救濟</h3>
<p>此事在全運會時丶將再有一度鄭重考慮丶届時必須完全解决云丶</p>
<h3>反對菲島新計分法</h3>
<p>關於遠東運動會丶菲律賓提議變更計分方法事</p>
<h3>新計分法之内容</h3>
<p>爲以後各項比賽丶概以分數計之丶並不以得第一種類最多之國得總錦標丶須以分數最多者得之丶分數之分配丶以各項參加人數之多寡爲標準丶譬如田賽徑賽全能三項丶參加人數甚多丶則得田賽錦標者得十五分丶徑賽全能亦然丶如籃球網球丶則隊員旣少丶得分亦少丶第一僅得五分丶於是合計各種比賽之第一第二第三之總分丶最多得總錦標丶（有詳細計分分配法）</p>
<h3>菲島提議之理由</h3>
<p>全爲公平起見丶如此則得第一名最多者丶並非必得錦標丶俾得第二第三較多者丶亦有得總錦標機會丶此議表面公允丶惟實際流弊甚多丶故巳去信表示反對丶同時函告日本丶聲明態度丶</p>
<h3>中華反對之理由</h3>
<p>若照此法計算丶則以後國人對於各項運動丶態度將大爲改變丶如網球籃球丶得分旣少丶與總錦標得失丶關係較淺丶將從此輕視不注意之丶或將以爲排球之重要丶竟在網球之上丶觀念一錯丶流毒無窮丶故進一步改正之丶</p>
<h3>作較完善之提議</h3>
<p>仍採計分方法丶而每種一二三三名丶以五三一分計算之丶錦標隊五分丶亞軍三分丶殿軍一分丶計法旣便丶各種比賽丶亦不至有高下之分也丶但亦不知能採納否丶</p>
<h3>今秋將有網球大會</h3>
<p>又詢以全國網球選手將定名次事丶據答未曾知悉此事丶在全國運動會中丶勢難决定名次丶</p>
<h3>須另有全國網球大會</h3>
<p>惟中華全國網球大會之舉行丶尚無是項籌備丶而在計劃者丶則</p>
<h3>有全國中外網球大會</h3>
<p>邀請全國之中外網球名手丶來滬作一大規模比賽丶仿照各國之Invitation　Tenis　Leaque成例丶同時邀請日本及他國之名將丶來滬表演丶藉得觀摩之益丶</p>
<h3>時間在八月底九月初</h3>
<p>約在扶輪杯萬國網球時丶或稍遲則延至九月丶在全運會前丶則各地選手比賽畢丶即可晋京參預全運會也</p>
<h3>明日江南在平比賽</h3>

<h3>世界重量擊拳大戰薛滿林簽字戰意將</h3>
<p>不在紐約舉行</p>
<p>紐約七日電擊敗史屈列勃林之世界重量擊拳錦標手丶今日其管理員宣稱巳簽字與意大利名手卡尼爾一戰丶時間在九月間丶因紐約不承認其爲世界錦標丶故此項比賽丶將不在紐約舉行云丶</p>
<h3>日本朝日棒球隊將來滬</h3>
<p>八日離長崎</p>
<p>日本古河省善通寺縣之朝日棒球隊丶一行十三人丶於八日搭長崎丸自長崎出發來滬丶將與滬上各棒球隊作友誼比賽丶</p>

<h3>世界小事紀</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>秃頂上的廣告計畫</p>
<p>歐美人對於商品的廣告。十分注重。往往不惜工本。從事於此。而他們的廣告方法。也異想天開。推陳出新。有出人意料之外的丶去今不久。曾有一位英國廣告專家。想得一個方法。用電話向電話用户逐家接談。向他們報告各種商品丶那一種肥皂最經濟。那一種香水最優美。但是這種方法太麻煩。無端的去打擾那些電話用户。也容易受人厭惡的。可是最近有人在報紙中登一廣告。招請十二位秃頂的上流紳士。以作廣告之用。那真是再奇妙没有了。他們的計畫。是打算將商品的廣告寫在那光滑的秃頂上面。加以精美的圖畫。而所用的油墨。必須全無毒質。而於頭皮没有損害的。廣告登上之後。就請他們上戲院。音樂會。跳舞會以及禮拜堂等。只須將帽子一脫。廣告就出來了。其引人注意之力。當然比甚麽都强。但是有人應徵與否。還没有把握哩。</p>
<h3>黑皮膚也許可以變白</h3>
<p>日本植物學家瑙古基博士DrY　Noguchi新從巴西回來。他曾用電的滋養法與腺的制裁法。試行於森林中的土人。巳有端倪。據他說。將來全功告成。可以改變人種。也許能使尼格魯人的黑皮膚變爲白晳。對於一個嬰兒的生長。并可用人力支配。身材的長短。屑背的寛狹。都可隨心所欲。這些話是否可以辦到。我們且拭目以觀其後。</p>
<h3>電都瑣聞</h3>
<p>— 石顔也</p>
<p>美國之好萊塢。有電影都巿之稱。友有遨遊其地者。歸以見聞餉余。爰述一二。以付本刋。</p>
<p>女子之美。除面部之秀麗外。尤貴身體之窈窕。始足以言姿態美。欲有苗條之體。須防止肌肉之臃腫。脂肪調節法之發明。即所爲摩登女性謀身體之減瘦也。電影女星之姿態美。爲其職業上必要之修養。故好萊塢女明星於去除臃腫之法。自較常人爲注意。最近知紫菜一物。食之可減削脂肪。於是此菜遂爲一般女星佐餐不可少之品。致有相見時互以今日食紫菜與否爲問。並以之爲餽贈禮物。以電星之提倡。而其他女子。亦效而食之。故紫菜之銷路大廣。價亦增昻。聞此物大多由日本運往云。</p>
<p>好萊塢有不少公司。專採集世界奇人奇物。以供各影片公司之用。而獲其租金。其中奇胖之婦。有鬚之女。以及各種怪人。網羅完備。無奇不有。一切世界之珍禽異獸。亦應有盡有。此外尚有其他神怪之物。足使人見而驚奇不置者。此等奇物。俱爲影片中不時之需。電影公司而苟一一採集。實難如願。投機商人。遂起貯以待之。租與應用。需求供給。各得其所。而亦兩利之道也。</p>
<p>在一年以前。天然彩色之攝影機。舉世不及十架。今則好萊塢巳有三四十架矣。電都電影之發達與進步。於是可見。至其利用此機以攝之彩色片。兩年中之出品。亦不下百部之多矣。</p>
<p>好萊塢演員中之兒童。不下兩千人。此輩兒童之年齡。有僅初生數月者。最長爲十八歲。年旣不一。體力自有强弱。工作時間亦不能不有别。大抵嬰兒每日工作僅一小時。且須别爲數次。不能連續爲之。數齡之童。則工作四小時。别有四小時之休息與游獻·十五六歲以上。工作名爲八小時。然其間休息與游戲。亦佔得數小時也。</p>
<h3>敗盜獲全之幼女</h3>
<p>— 綃</p>
<p>年來江北各邑。萑苻遍地。剿不勝剿。中央雖特設綏靖大員。尚不知何日能收全功也。鹽城某鎮附近之王家村。有農户王某。一生勤儉。薄有積蓄。膝下祗有一女。年方九歲。聰慧異常。此外其妻弟某甲。因怙恃雙失。貧無可依。終年居王家。又長工一。共得五人。丁口固甚簡單也。一夕。同村有人娶婦。王夫婦偕往赴席。初原擬携女去。以女忽言頭痛。巳早臥。遂留之於家。孰意即在是夕。突來盜匪六人。明火執杖。毁户而入。妻弟長工皆戰慄無人色。不敢聲。盜縶其手足畢。直入女之臥室。四瞰無人。祗床上臥一幼女。即呼之起。女睹狀。心識爲盜。知懼亦無益。從容下床。盜曰。咄。爾之父母何在。女應曰。往人家喫喜酒去矣。爾欲何爲。盜曰。我輩來索債耳。銀錢藏在何處。爾當知之。趣以實告。女曰。所有銀錢。悉藏在此箱中。自取之可矣。言次。指示一箱。取鑰授盜。燃洋燭一支。盜得鑰。亟搬所指之箱置地上。俯而啓之。羣盜依次俯觀。果見有洋蚨纍纍。大喜過望。女則持洋燭立羣盜背後爲之照。盜猶以女爲玲瓏可愛。而不知女巳遍將洋燭油暗滴於羣盜之背。做成暗記也。盜得洋去。女更潛躡於後。察其去路方向。知爲赴鎮。始歸待父母返。及王某夫婦得訊返家。盜巳去遠。女以切具告之。王急趕赴鎮報告警察。謂背有燭油者即盜。要求　捕。維時天巳大明。羣盜方以澈夜未賑飢腸轆轆。就一茶社盥洗進食。未幾有　察過。瞥見茶社中有六人共座。察其面貌。均非善類。巳生疑心。遂進内觀其背。果皆有洋燭油。因並捕之。無一脫者。搜其身畔。則贓銀具在。尚一元未少也。</p>
<h3>枕</h3>
<p>— 儉父</p>
<p>釋名枕臥所以薦首者也。因吾人每當睡眠。輒寘首於枕。於是枕之爲物。遂與吾人衛生上。發生密切之關係。語云。高枕無憂。實則喜高枕之人。大都腰背彎曲。非藉重高枕。則氣息不舒。試觀西人多用低枕。或不用枕。蓋西人素重衛生。故其軀幹多挺直。若用高枕。反足阻礙其呼吸。亦習慣之作用耳。至於吾人普通之用枕。以汽枕爲宜。蓋汽枕可以隨人首偏正之分量。爲轉移。可免落枕之患。（吾人夜間就眠日間覺頸項痛疼即是）農人之枕。多實以榖殼或稻草。因農人終歲勞力。而用腦之時絶少。尚無大礙。實則榖殼及稻草之屬。每際溽暑。輒生霉菌。殆吾人每届夏令。汗出如瀋。枕中所實之原料吸收汗汁所致。若不勤加曝滌。則腦中必染霉菌之毒素。最易發生腦病。又近日巿間最盛行之絮枕。其原料多用蘆荻之花絮。實則荻絮蘆花。其性甚暖。宜於冬日。而不適用於夏令。夏令之用枕。除汽枕外。以凉枕爲最宜。近人有發明水枕者。其法以毬膽貯冰汁或凉水。置凉枕之内。翌晨。輒覺腦筋清爽易常。亦夏令衛生之一法也。又有警枕者。始於武肅王錢鏐。鏐在軍中。未常安寢。用圓木小枕。睡熟則欹。由是得寤。故名。後諸葛武侯發明雞鳴枕。以木質爲之。其構造之法。雖未得其詳。然不以示警醒之意。又有所謂仙枕者。開元遺事。龜兹國進一枕。温潤如玉。枕之。則十洲三島。四海五湖。盡在夢中。明皇遂名爲游仙枕。神仙傳。太山父老。時漢武帝東巡。見父鋤於道。頭上白光。高數尺。呼問之。曰有道士敎臣作神枕。枕有三十二竅。應二十四氣。八竅應八風。臣行之轉少而齒更生。事屬不經。姑誌之。以當談助。</p>
<h3>游韓漫談（一）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>最近爲萬寳山事件而演成全朝鮮人民蠢動殺害我華僑的流血慘案。顯然是中日外交上極嚴重的問題。本來很簡單的事實。但結果竟釀成滔天大禍。内容愈閙愈複雜。問題也就越變越大了。試想鮮民在我國境敢如此强横。繼之各地響應。紛起有組織的暴動。這分明是有背景的一齣雙簧戯。握有朝鮮統治權的總督府。事前旣疏於覺察。事後復無力鎮壓。活活的把吾僑胞殺死毆傷整百整千。就算他是承認失察之責了。所謂保護外僑生命財産的安全。遵守雙方條約。維持國際信義。不知當作什麽解釋。</p>
<p>我國僑民。足跡遍於世界。講到被壓迫的苦痛。與謀生活的艱難。莫過於朝鮮的僑胞。其顛連困苦的情形。要不是身歷其境。親目所睹。當然很隔膜的。在一個月以前。我剛從日本到了朝鮮。實地留心華僑的生活。和朝鮮亡國的情景。觸目驚心。紀不勝紀。把它拉雜寫來。以供研究中韓問題者的參考。</p>
<p>朝鮮華僑。大都　以農·工·商·爲業。在新義州者最多。漢城·仁川·平壤次之。散居於針南浦·元山·清津·大邱·釜山·羣山·木浦。等處城鄉的。全數當在十萬以上。他們雖能勤儉自給。但近年來朝鮮當局。限制甚嚴。大有排斥驅逐的趨勢。因此生活不易。立足也就困難。僑商向來以推銷綢緞·麻布爲大宗的貨品。因關稅增加。成本太重。而斷絶進口。日貨取而代之。别種小資本貿易。也非常清淡。商塲的勢力。完全爲日本人奪去。做佃農的·苦工的。受盡了日人的欺凌。鮮民的嫉妒與排除。流離海外。進退兩難。不僅爲了國力不强政府失却保護的緣故。而日本人的奸謀。早想驅逐華僑。移鮮民於滿蒙。把朝鮮半島。清一色的給他日本人自巳來經營。他不便明目張胆的做。先聳動愚蠢的朝鮮暴民。做他的先鋒。在民國十六年冬。巳經下過一次毒手。此番全朝鮮擴大的暴動。是第二次的嘗試。誰敢否認不是他們預定的計畫。</p>

<h3>？？？（一七）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良想到這裏，也無心做事，即忙下樓去一看，當真娘姨也跟了這位主母去了，大門開着。去呌伊們進來呢？此刻没有燒焦飯，當然伊們不肯進來的；聽憑伊們去看呢？我只好在此地替伊們看門；我要上樓去做事，只有把大門關起來。子良想了一回，覺得還是關門的穩當，於是他關了門，下了一個閂，自巳仍舊回到亭子間去。</p>
<p>他心裏定一點了，然後再入手做事，忽然有人叩門。伊們回來了麽？叩門之聲很急，子良只得走下樓去，開門一看，乃是一個郵差。</p>
<p>「快信！打圖章！」</p>
<p>子良接過信來一看，上面寫着潘陶月如女士，是南京寄來的，他就回到樓上去拏圖章，蓋了圖章，郵差一去，仍舊閂上了門，他把信留在客堂廟桌子上，自巳上樓去了。</p>
<p>寫得不過兩三個字，又有人叩門，子良没精打采的下去，開了門，當真是伊們倆回來了，子良轉身來，就跑上樓，不料夫人在後面跟上來：</p>
<p>「青天白日，爲什麽關門？你在裏頭做着秘密的事麽？」</p>
<p>子良不語，到了亭子間裏，就坐下來。</p>
<p>「大出喪，好看啊！軍樂隊，有九起；汽車六十五輛：花圈八十一個：送的人，男男女女，不知有多少？死的是女子，聽說是一個白相人的嫂媫」。</p>
<p>伊說時，臉上現出一副羡慕的神氣來，兀自對丈夫看着：</p>
<p>「白相人的嫂嫂，多麽體面？學校敎師的嫂嫂死了，恐怕只有幾副輓聯罷！」</p>
<p>伊感慨似的說着，見丈夫不開口，似乎很没趣：</p>
<p>「我對你說話，你怎麽响也不响？」</p>
<p>「開了大門，人都跑空了，萬一闖一個賊進來，把東西偷了去，可怎麽辦？」</p>
<p>「我們家　，還有東西給人偷麽」？</p>

<h3>監院委談内外蒙最近狀况</h3>
<p>我國西北兩面邊陲丶地曠人稀丶物産豐富丶惟以交通不便丶更因國内連年戰亂丶以致彼此頗乏密切之往來丶溯自清末以來丶國内與邊疆之關係丶日見退落丶由近而疏丶由疏而遠丶以迄於今丶幾巳完全隔絶丶雖國内各智識階級丶最近巳自知注意丶然碍於交通之不便丶仍不免有地角天涯之感日前有自蒙來滬之某中央監察院委員丶與新聲社記者晤於旅次丶談及内外蒙之最近狀况頗詳丶兹特分紀如下丶以供注意邊疆者之參攷丶</p>
<p>内蒙古</p>
<h3>政治概况</h3>
<p>内蒙共分伊克昭·烏蘭察佈·錫林郭勒·昭烏達·卓索圖·哲里木·六盟·盟之下有旗丶旗之數目丶同盟之大小而定丶屬於盟之外者丶復有獨立旗及特别旗丶如阿拉善·西士迷特·俄極諾·土而滬特丶齊齊哈·伊克綿干丶呼倫貝爾丶索倫巴古·等丶均不歸盟管轄丶以盟爲最高機關丶各盟有盟長丶其下有雜沙克丶即旗之官職也丶統轄所屬之旗丶盟長雖較雜沙克高一級丶然彼並無政治權柄丶司法亦有一定之法律規定丶不如藏方之一任達籟剌麻行使也丶其現行法律丶即照清廷理藩部所頒定之蒙古則律而略加以改良丶</p>
<h3>軍隊組織</h3>
<p>軍隊以「章京」爲軍事領袖丶其職權如内地之都統焉丶軍隊完全爲騎兵丶並無步砲等種類丶軍隊編制之數目丶亦多少不定丶以旗之大小而定丶旗之大者有軍隊兩三千丶小者僅一二百丶内中亦有漢人充軍官及士兵者丶惟在錫林郭勒盟丶則因地屬遊牧丶漢人極稀丶故軍隊中不見漢人踪跡矣丶</p>
<h3>農商交通</h3>
<p>商業方面丶除漢人之茶皮毛等商外丶蒙人並無何種商業可言丶蓋遊牧生活之外丶近來始漸有業農者丶然爲數甚少丶亦不發達丶至交通方面丶僅伊克昭盟與烏蘭察佈盟較便丶然較諸内地丶則尤相差形遠丶旅行除馬·駱駝·牛車·駱駝車·以及由張北一帶所去之轎車外丶别無代步法丶郵電兩項丶僅郵政略有設施丶然亦多不完善丶</p>
<h3>宗敎信仰</h3>
<p>信仰上據内地傳說丶謂蒙人完全信仰佛敎丶其實蒙人之信仰丶亦頗自由丶如回敎耶穌敎等丶蒙人均有信仰者丶現回敎勢力頗盛丶以阿拉善·奇魯·兩旗爲多丶耶敎則勢力極微丶信佛敎者丶雖頗篤信喇嘛丶然喇嘛在蒙丶仍不能操縱政權也丶</p>
<h3>漢人情形</h3>
<p>漢人之旅居内蒙古者丶爲數甚多丶伊克昭烏蘭察佈兩盟爲尤多丶該兩盟之蒙漢兩種人丶比較幾成爲二與八之比丶以營農及商爲主丶蒙漢兩方感情丶亦頗融洽丶農人較商爲多丶</p>
<h3>外蒙古</h3>
<h3>新政組成</h3>
<p>外蒙於民國九年丶叛離中國而獨立丶受第三國際之煽惑丶成立所謂蒙古共和民主國丶其政治上之組織丶以每年一次丶約在秋季八月間舉行之人民代表大會爲最高機關丶該會每年改選常務委員一人丶人數約在二十一人以上（按此即等於執行委員丶因蒙文譯意爲常委丶）由二十餘常務員中丶再互選常川辦公委員五人至七人丶（按此乃常務委員）由常川辦公委員中丶再推委員長一人丶統理蒙古共和政府之一切事宜丶其下有國務總理一人丶爲執行辦公委員長丶爲頒佈之一切命令者丶其下共設内政外交財政交通軍事司法農商敎育等九部丶各部設部長一人丶由人民代表大會所選出之常務委員分任之丶政府之下有部落政府丶（按即省政府之類）部落政府之下丶則爲旗政府丶其組織均與蒙古共和國政府相類丶</p>
<h3>新軍編制</h3>
<p>新軍隊之編制丶雖非外人所詳知丶但就大體言之丶當較以前爲進步丶即軍器一項丶亦應有應有丶且外蒙軍隊丶完全採徵兵制丶凡至當兵年齡丶除殘廢外丶無可或免丶彼規定人民應服兵役之期限爲二年丶滿期退伍後丶猶須每年應所在之旗政府之招集丶練習半月丶其曾任部長丶或其他要職者如不在職而遇徵兵時丶亦須應徵丶否則即不爲政府所容丶故外蒙自實行徵兵以來丶現巳全境皆兵丶</p>
<h3>强迫敎育</h3>
<p>外蒙現除在各部落各旗丶均普設學校外丶並實行强迫敎育丶凡男女兒童至六歲時丶均須入學讀書丶否則即罰其父母丶遇貧寒無力者丶政府亦設有相當補救辦法丶因之十餘年來丶外蒙人民智識之開通丶巳大有可觀丶平素内蒙「歐苦里」（蠢牛意）恥笑外蒙者丶今反之恥笑内蒙矣丶</p>
<h3>監察官吏</h3>
<p>蒙古共和政府之外丶復設一内防處丶爲我國現政府之監察院丶總機關權限極大丶其職務專爲接受人民對某官吏之提出彈劾事宜丶内防處接受彈劾某官吏之請求後丶並不通知丶亦不問虚實丶即先將此被告發之官員丶實行逮捕丶然後判明是否犯罪丶如確係犯罪丶則自當加以嚴厲之處分丶否則仍令加本職丶政府當代爲聲明被誣丶於名譽上仍可不受損失也丶</p>
<h3>俄人勢力</h3>
<p>蘇俄在外蒙丶並無何勢力可言丶非如報紙所傳之甚丶外蒙當局丶亦不容其有勢力存在丶政府方面丶除政府自動聘任之俄人外丶並無任何俄人丶握持外蒙政權丶且俄人之在蒙犯法者丶一律與其他外人處同樣之罪罰丶余（某監委自稱）曾見蒙司法界丶槍斃犯罪之日人俄人各一丶而日俄兩國當局丶亦無敢如何丶</p>
<h3>左右兩派</h3>
<p>外蒙内部丶自三年前起丶則巳分爲左右兩派丶然鬥爭尚不十分劇烈丶最近左派頗佔勢力丶將來尚不知有何變化否丶</p>
<h3>逐漢人事</h3>
<p>驅逐外蒙境内之漢人丶及没收漢人之財産丶事確有之丶但並未全部如此丶其所驅逐之漢人丶以游手好閒者居多丶没收之産業丶亦即此輩人之産業丶其餘如皮毛茶等各漢商丶仍留蒙未被逐丶</p>
<h3>外人入境</h3>
<p>現漢人及其他外人丶仍可入外蒙境丶但須經相當之手續丶如領取護照丶須得蒙古政府之允許丶及檢查行裝等丶現俄蒙邊境丶設有海關丶内蒙及吉黑熱等邊界丶均有關卡丶所携入境之貨物丶均須抽稅丶内蒙人之欲入境者丶亦須經以上各種手續丶</p>
<h3>幣制情形</h3>
<p>外蒙最近丶亦有新幣流通丶對内則以銀爲本位丶對外如徵收關稅等丶以金爲本位丶爲現下我國内地之辦法丶其新幣之流通巿面者丶銅幣爲「蒙哥」等於内地之銅元一分丶角爲「阿拉巴蒙哥丶」即十分之意丶銀幣名「特哥立」等於内地之銀幣一元丶銅幣有一分·二分·十分·三種丶銀幣僅一元者一種丶紙幣有一元·二元·三元·五元·十元·百元·五十元·及萬元等數種丶華幣亦可通用丶銀行在阿拉特（原名庫倫）伍德不倫（原名恰克圖）阿毛倫巴特（原名賣城）及其他重要城鎮均有丶</p>
<h3>風俗一般</h3>
<p>内外蒙古風俗均相同丶服裝仍尚滿洲式之長袍馬褂丶寛而且大丶喜長袖丶然現巳有多數人丶衣西服革履矣丶食則多以牛羊肉茶炒米麵等爲主丶雖現巳有食米者丶然爲數甚少丶庫倫之生活程度丶較内地生活程度高者尤爲高丶但一至鄉間丶則生活程度又極低丶住則除城鎮多北方房屋丶及木製房屋外丶鄉間仍以毡製之棚帳爲最普通丶因彼等游牧丶可於四季隨時遷移丶</p>
<h3>對蒙意見</h3>
<p>中央對内外蒙問題丶其處置辦法丶如仍照應付西藏之辦法丶或派遣數專員調查一次丶即告了事丶恐特不免仍舊失敗丶余意以爲對藏對蒙丶均應由民衆方面作去丶現外蒙内部丶巳有派别挽救尚不爲難丶中央在此時丶再不决定相當辦法丶恐將來内蒙亦將難保丶其原因即内蒙與外蒙丶均爲同言同種丶内蒙日受外蒙之薰陶丶將來與外蒙合併丶或自行獨立丶亦意中事也丶是以將來蒙古問題之如何解决丶亦視中央之應付如何耳丶</p>
<h3>智利代辦請示晉京期</h3>
<p>智利駐華代辦卡魯斯丶於昨日（八日）下午二時丶前往外交部駐滬辦事處丶拜晤楊筱堂處長丶談商赴京日期丶楊處長當即電向外部請示並聞以前智利雖曾派過駐華代辦丶但迄未到任丶故卡氏實爲初任來華丶其辦公地點正在尋覓中丶</p>
<h3>時人行踪錄</h3>
<p>宋子文丶昨晚乘夜車出京丶今晨可抵滬</p>
<p>張靜江昨晨九時十分丶乘車赴杭丶</p>
<p>國民革民軍騎兵第一師第一旅旅長楊國瑞丶前因公來滬丶定今晚偕副官等乘晚車晋京丶轉贛謁蔣丶稍事勾留丶逕返河南防次丶</p>

<h3>持志健兒的暑期生活</h3>
<p>— 金培善</p>
<p>長夏又來到人間、多時過着黄金般的大學生活的學生們、都回到家鄉去做着甜密的夏夜夢、各大學的廣厦高樓、多半是人去臺空、冷清了不少、但是我們持志的運動健兒、他們因爲多半是地北天南的異鄉游子、路途遥遠、所以每年的寒暑兩假都留校不歸、仍在校過着異味的假期中生活、尤其是暑假、這個兩個多月的日子、真是度日如年呢、我現在把持志大學諸健兒的暑期生活報告一些在下面</p>
<p>夏澤人　他是持志的籃球隊長、四年來勞苦功高、爲母校爭光不少、今夏巳戴上了方帽子、得了商學士的榮銜、但是他還不忍一旦離開了他親愛的母校、署假中六時就起了身、到球塲練習、下午必到虹口游水池去游水、夜裏到虹口公園或校園中乘風凉、同他最相愛的是孔廣益老兄、他們是日常相處、寸步不離的、</p>
<p>楊麟毓　他的家鄉遠在海天萬里、波濤掠岸的菲島、巳經是多時没有回去過、他暑假中的生活是愉快而健康的、每日六時必定起身、練習短跑、從江灣路持大前門起、後門回、大約有一英里途程、他朝朝如此、不曾間斷、下午用餐後、也總要去虹口游水池一走、須待到驕陽西下、晚風送凉的時候歸來、每日和他相處的是排球健將鄭夢青同學、因爲兩人都是華僑、言語又是對同的、</p>
<p>夏玉書　他是夏隊長的弟、綽號老三、以滑稽調笑著名全校、去年暑假、在滬江大學暑期學校、又有滑稽大王的號、還有兩件事、就可以曉得他滑稽成性的一班、就是在炎威的夏天、人多畏怕如火的太陽、和蚊子的患、所以人人不能多睡覺、和食量亦人人必减少、但是他每天白日還要打中覺（午睡）、每日還要每餐吃四大碗的飯、但是他有一件美德、好讀書、研究英文、在校是數一數二的了、他又好說英語、看見人總是說Are　You　Happy他暑假裏每日要吃西瓜一隻、吃完了、又睡覺一塲、他的好朋友是東吳大學滑稽家孫武侯、真是志同道合、</p>
<p>孔廣益　他在暑假裏、非但是球不離手、且書不離手、好學深思、可以想見、他歡喜吃汽水和冰淇淋、每日必令校役購來、夜間因爲苦熱和蚊子太多、所以要乘風凉、到十二時方睡、早晨是六時必巳起身了、籃球是他的拿手戲、近來因爲天氣苦熱、故久巳没有練習、專門游水了、</p>
<p>高大韓　他是持志足球隊的柱石、生長高麗、故國兮千里、他是寒暑假都不回去的、每日六時起了身、就要吃冷開水、這真是高麗人的特性、他每日除打網球以外、就練習中文書法、及閱新文藝、關於愛情一類的作品、如「玫瑰春夢」「愛的網」等、</p>
<p>陳栢桑　他的家、遠在南洋雪尼來加影埠、負笈持志、業巳五年未歸、暑假中的學校生活他是過慣了的、他是持志裏的網球健將、與何祚昌主將齊名、他每天打網球的時間、總有三小時以上、雖在今年這般的天炎陽當空、但是终不能阻去他的網球熱、他是喜歡弄音樂的、什麽凡啞林和其他樂具、都是嫻習的、每當晚風送凉、素月臨空的夜、他必在校園内的大樹蔭下、清歌一曲、令人神往、有的時候、和他的南洋朋友、一共在校園的樹蔭下、談笑着、或唱着「雷夢娜」和南洋山歌、他的暑期生活、是含有藝術趣味、很值得人的羡慕、</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>貝當司令從後備軍及東部軍抽調幾師之外、再加第十軍及訓練成熟的美軍兩師、（第三及第五師）、當可挽回頽勢、惟各路作戰的步驟、必須明白規定、切實奉行、我以爲這是轉危爲安的緊要關鍵、三十一日午後、我在曲里堡向貝當司令及長興斯司令（註、即在喜明河覆滅的第）六軍軍長、）凱切說明這點、</p>
<p>然而僅以重要的任務命各司令官注意是不夠的、現在更須招尋新實力供給他們、即在三十一日、海格總指揮來到沙格斯看我、我對他說、正在英軍區域訓練的美軍或將調用幾師到法軍方面、北面支隊裏面或將抽調兩師、敵人向法綫猛攻　時候、或須英軍助戰、現在因須着手準備、</p>
<p>六月一日、敵軍繼續進攻不息、更在馬爾納河與奥爾克河之間、及向費勒高特勒森林方面、獲得重大的進展、</p>
<p>貝當司令見着形勢險惡、緊急辦法愈趨必要、他再函告他支持戰局的困難、重請美英援軍火速前去、</p>
<p>他在信裏附寄加斯拿司令的報告、關照他道、倘使德軍力蔟東部軍防綫、他以缺乏後備隊、惟有命令未遭攻擊的幾師急行退却、重新佈置以待時機、</p>
<p>這顯然明示缺少自信力、五月三十一日我在曲里堡所特别令人注意的一點全然不顧、前幾星期裏我在同一形勢之下曾見英軍方面也呈這同樣的象徵、我因更須向各軍再加鼓勵、</p>
<p>六月二日、在蒲柏内同貝當司令面談之後、我便把我們的談話作成下例方案交他、</p>
<p>「（一）法軍司令務以阻止敵軍向巴黎前進、尤其在馬爾納河北面、爲指揮戰事的方針、</p>
<p>「（二）在這方面以步步爲營的戰略全力固守、</p>
<p>「（三）把各軍士卒作戰的步驟、確確實實作成軍令、切實奉行、如有任何司官不能勝任的即行撒換」、</p>
<p>我爲恢復軍心起見、加上下面的一條、</p>
<p>「（四）全部聯軍皆向這方面儘力助戰」、</p>
<p>我同潘興司令商定、調遣美兵五師至法綫接防平靜的區域、以便該區的法軍調入火綫助戰、並請海格總指揮從英軍總預備隊抽調三師、分路開往亞眠之西、以助英法各軍、末了、我在六月一日遷到莫喜、六月五日又遷到朋朋、以便接近法軍總司令部、</p>
<p>大隊法國援軍開到、前敵指揮官分配得宜、更以敵人久蔟力疲、疴亞斯河與馬爾納河之間的形勢逐漸穩定、六月二三兩日、德軍在沙亞松之南進攻棘手、六月四日敵軍便停攻了、</p>
<p>疴亞斯河之西、諾昻與孟鐵第歐間、另一大戰近在準備中、</p>
<p>孟琴司令奉命指揮這次戰事、十日午後、我在諾亞見他軍事倥偬、正與福悅司令會議一切、他把作戰計劃向我說明、他大部分的隊伍、尤其是砲隊、雖則非到夜裏不能開到、他决定次晨即行一致進攻、他因先召集砲兵師師長以及主力軍軍官在操場訓話、面授進取機宜、分配作戰任務、夜間各軍絡續開到、便即進依照預定計劃分頭進行、</p>
<p>夜晚、孟琴司令便向各師長發號施令、指定砲隊準備的鐘點以及實行攻擊的時刻、</p>

<h3>Seoul Mob Destroys Chinese Consulate General</h3>
<p>Zhang Weicheng Flees to Governor-General's Office</p>
<p>Five Hundred Injured Inside the Consulate</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters received a telegram from Zhang Weicheng stating that the consulate was destroyed by Koreans. Zhang led all the consulate staff to take refuge in the Korean Governor-General's Yamen. He has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report and requested a serious protest. Further news indicates that on the night of the 8th, more than two thousand Korean rioters destroyed the consulate. Utensils and documents were completely destroyed and lost. Many Chinese nationals seeking refuge in the consulate were killed or injured. Weicheng took refuge in the Korean Governor-General's Office. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to semi-official sources, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters received a telegram from Zhang Weicheng, the Chinese Consul-General in Seoul, stating that Korean mobs launched another attack today. The Chinese Consulate was looted and destroyed, resulting in five hundred Chinese who had taken refuge in the consulate being injured. It is reported that Zhang Weicheng has taken refuge in the Korean Governor-General's Office. This news has not yet been verified from other sources. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The situation in Busan, Korea, seems to remain urgent. Koreans clashed in the streets several times, and fourteen Koreans were arrested. This morning, nine hundred Koreans, taking advantage of the small number of police, attacked Chinese cloth shops and restaurants in Mokushima, opposite Busan, smashing the utensils of the shops and throwing all the cloth onto the streets. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Pyongyang) Last night, the whole of Korea was stable and peaceful. Pyongyang was completely quiet due to increased security and rain. The funeral service for the deceased was held at the provincial hospital starting at 5 p.m. last night. The Chinese Consul, the Korean Governor of the province, Chinese representatives, and others attended. The remains were buried in the public cemetery outside Pyongyang. (9th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Korean Violence Purely Instigated</h3>
<p>Talks with a Korean Professor</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ge Changzhi, a professor at the Korean Normal University, came to Beiping and said that the Korean massacre of overseas Chinese was purely instigated by the Japanese. The Japanese used the Wanbaoshan incident to incite the Korean people, creating rumors seven or eight times a day, deliberately exaggerating and sensationalizing. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Official Claims Korea Has Returned to Peace</h3>
<p>Hoping Our Country Will Understand</p>
<p>Negotiations on Outstanding Issues Will Not Be Delayed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hayashi Ide visited the Sajjiawan at 11 a.m. today and met with Foreign Minister Wang again to discuss matters related to Korea, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai tonight. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Secretary Hayashi, under the order of Acting Representative Shigemitsu, visited Foreign Minister Wang at 11 a.m. today and stated that Korea is completely stable, and overseas Chinese can safely resume their jobs as usual, so there is no need to worry. He also hoped that the existing telegraph treaty and the Hankou incident, which are outstanding issues between China and Japan that need to be resolved, would not be delayed by this incident. At 3 p.m., he also visited Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Communications Minister Wang Boqun, making the same statement. (9th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Korean incident, Prime Minister Wakatsuki told reporters yesterday that this incident was a sudden event caused by the emotions of an unintelligent mob, resulting in many sacrifices, which is very regrettable. However, Japanese authorities, not wanting to risk lives, have made every effort to stop the Korean riots and have done their best to protect the Chinese. I believe that the Chinese side will understand this. In other words, Japan has always made sincere efforts to properly handle this unfortunate incident, which is a fact recognized by Chinese officials and people and countries around the world. I firmly believe that this unfortunate sudden incident will not cause new disputes between China and Japan. Compensation for the property of the victims has not yet become an issue, but the Japanese government intends to seek appropriate relief methods for the unfortunate victims and their families.

<h3>Wan Case Negotiated Locally</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Counter-Proposes Compensation Conditions</p>
<p>Jilin Provincial Government Telegraphed Yanbian to Be on Alert</p>
<p>(Jilin) The Wan case is currently being negotiated locally first. If it is not satisfactory, it will be moved to Beijing. The provincial government has reported the entire case to the central government and the Northeast Political Affairs Committee. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jilin) The Japanese Consul stationed in Jilin presented conditions on the 8th: 1. Compensation for material losses to Korean farmers, such as labor costs and grain seeds; 2. Compensation for mental losses, such as living expenses after the withdrawal of the lease; 3. Allowing Korean farmers to freely reside in Wanbaoshan; 4. Retaining the lease rights of Wan land and continuing to handle it through legal procedures in the future. The Japanese Consul also visited the authorities in person, saying that farmer conflicts had also occurred in Fuyu, please pay attention. The provincial government, in view of the Korean people being incited to riot, urgently telegraphed Yanbian to be on alert, and advised that the Chinese and Koreans have historically had good feelings, and the Chinese have never treated the Koreans badly and have no intention of expelling them. The Wan case is a small matter that can be easily resolved. Why bother to cut off relations? It also telegraphed Chang, Nong, Yi, and Fu counties to swear to uphold the national protection and people-preservation principles and resist with all their strength. It is hoped that they will remain calm and not be rash. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Zuoxiang passed through Tianjin last night to discuss the Wanbaoshan incident. The true situation is not as serious as reported in the newspapers. It originated from a Chinese man, Hao Yongde, colluding with Korean Li Zaohe, who had become naturalized, to forcibly occupy civilian land and dig ditches. The Japanese police then protected the Korean excavation work and fired shots to intimidate. After negotiations with the Japanese Consul-General Hayashi stationed in Shenyang, the Japanese police were withdrawn. However, on the 2nd of this month, the Japanese side broke their promise and sent plainclothes police with handguns to protect the Korean work, and conflict broke out again. The intense anti-Chinese sentiment among the Koreans caused by this incident is particularly exaggerated. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) In Wanbaoshan, Korean people are currently being protected by Japanese police to excavate waterways that were filled in by Chinese farmers. Negotiations between the Jilin negotiator and Consul-General Ishiya have made no progress due to the influence of the Korean incident. The Jilin side said that it is necessary to wait for Zhang Zuoxiang's instructions, so it will wait for Zhang Zuoxiang and Consul-General Hayashi to return to Shenyang before negotiating there.

<h3>Original Text of Hao Yongde's Land Lease Contract</h3>
<p>In the Name of Changnong Rice Field Company</p>
<p>Subleased from Farmers in the Second District</p>
<p>Revised Contract Leased to Koreans</p>
<p>(Harbin) In the Wanbaoshan Korean rice planting case, the traitor Hao Yongde, also known as Hao San, is from Tianjin, 53 years old, and has been living in Changchun for many years. He was once a pimp and a porter, and is one of the "Eighteen Heroes of Changchun." In recent years, he has accumulated wealth and become a rich man, but he is still greedy for more money, and he colluded with Korean people who had not naturalized to plant rice. The contract he concluded with the Koreans is as follows: Hao Yongde, the leaseholder, now leases out a piece of wasteland located in the jurisdiction of the third district of Changchun County, 500 mu of land, because he is unable to cultivate it. Through manager Shen Lianze, he has arranged for it to be leased to nine Koreans: Li Shengxun, Li Zaohe, Park Loxing, Li Xichang, Xu Longhao, Jin Dongxian, Shen Hengze, Zheng Yuanze, and Zheng Canyu. The contract is hereby established as follows: From March of the 20th year of the Republic of China in the old lunar calendar to March of the 30th year of the Republic of China in the old lunar calendar. (1) Term: The lease term is ten years. (2) Land area: When harvesting, the land will be measured according to 24 bows per mu. (3) Rent: The annual rent for each mu of paddy field is two dan of rice, and the rent for cultivated paddy field is two dan and three sheng. (4) In case of natural disasters, the rent will be discussed separately. (5) In case of minor disasters and half harvest, the rent will be discussed separately by both parties. (6) The base of the house, small waterways, farm roads, and all public land are not subject to rent. (7) The total area of the land is limited to 500 mu for the first ten-year lease, divided into two terms. After the five-year term, the increase or decrease in the rice rent will be discussed by both parties. (8) Waterway: The rent for the use of the waterway is fixed at three dan of rice per mu per year. (9) Land tax, police fees, school fees, water conservancy, and all official and public donations will be borne equally by both parties each year. (10) The total area of paddy field is 500 mu. After one year of planting, the landlord agrees to lease more land to the tenant. The manager will look at the land and collect the amount of the harvest. (11) After the expiration of the lease, both parties will negotiate. When the tenant moves out, the house built by the tenant will be demolished, and the waterways and paddy fields will be returned to the landlord, managed by the two managers. (12) In case of rent arrears or absconding, there are joint guarantors to take charge. (13) The manager is responsible for collecting and transporting the rice rent, and the landlord will transport it away himself. (14) Now leasing 500 mu, there are hundreds of mu of wasteland. When leasing it next year, the rent will be fixed at two dan of rice per mu as in the current example. (15) If there are hundreds of mu more to be leased, the rules are the same as in the previous clause. The lease is effective from the year of the Republic of China. The above 15 clauses are agreed upon by both parties. Lest there be no proof, this contract is made as evidence. Joint guarantors: Li Derui, Li Zaohe, Park Loxing, Li Xichang, Xu Longhao, Jin Dongxian, Shen Hengze, Zheng Yuanze, Zheng Canyu. Writer: Yang Fucai. Manager: Shen Lianze. Leaseholder: Hao Yongde, April of the 20th year of the Republic of China, new lunar calendar. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Hao Yongde's lease of paddy fields to Korean people was subleased from farmers in the second district in the name of Changnong Rice Field Company. The contract is as follows: Xiao Hanlin, Zhang Hongbin, and others, the leaseholders, have about 500 mu of raw and cultivated land in the area east of the Yitong River in the third district of the county. Through the intermediary's persuasion, they are willing to lease it to Hao Yongde's Changnong Rice Field Company to cultivate rice. At the same time, it is specified that the lease term is ten years, from the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China to the autumn of the 29th year. After the expiration, this contract will lose its validity. This is mutually agreed upon, and neither party shall regret it. The agreed conditions are hereby listed as follows: (1) This wasteland is defined as 2,400 square feet per mu. Although the quota is 500 mu, due to the large number of landlords, it cannot fully meet the quota. In the future, it should be calculated based on the actual number planted, and neither party shall dispute the original quota. (2) The annual rice rent for each mu of raw wasteland is one dan and two dou. Among the raw wasteland, there is some cultivated land that cannot be excavated, which is also used as paddy field, and the annual rice rent for each mu is two dan. The rent shall not be increased or decreased within five years. It will be stipulated separately after five years. (3) If there is a severe drought or flood in the first year, and the autumn harvest is not possible, the rice rent due will be owed according to the amount, and the tenants will pay it to the landlords in the same proportion in the second year when there is a good harvest. The same method will be used for any other year with drought and no harvest. (4) Although the amount of rent can be changed after five years, the lease term is still ten years. Before the expiration of ten years, the landlord shall not lease it to others, and the tenant shall not refuse to plant. (5) The housing base and roads used by farmers in the paddy field shall be surveyed and allocated separately without paying rent. (6) The rent and other official expenses for this paddy field shall be borne by both the landlord and the tenant. (7) The landlords lease the land to Hao Yongde's Changnong Rice Field Company as a whole. The company is responsible for how to cultivate it, sublease it to others, or any accidents that may occur as a result. The landlords will not interfere. (8) During the term of this land, no matter who the landlord is, even if there is a transfer of ownership, they shall not use this as an excuse to unilaterally withdraw it and lease it separately. The ten-year term shall still be the limit. (9) This paddy field must be irrigated with water from the Yitong River. All drainage ditches shall also be surveyed and calculated, and the rent for each mu shall be three dan of rice per year, which shall be paid to the landlords separately by Changnong Rice Field Company. The term shall also be ten years. (10) When draining water from the paddy field in autumn, the</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Changnong Rice Field Company is also responsible for ensuring that it does not hinder others or cause disputes. (11) If water ditches pass through roads, bridges must be built, and Changnong Rice Field Company is also responsible for building them. (12) Both parties shall find reliable guarantors for this contract. If either party violates the contract afterwards, the guarantor shall perform the contract. (13) This contract shall take effect from the date of approval by the county government. If the county government does not approve it, it shall remain invalid. Landlord guarantors: Cao Yanshi, Wang Chenglin. Tenant guarantors: Yang Fucai, Shen Lianlianze. Writer: Yao Huidi. Intermediary: Zhao Xiangyang.

<h3>Anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:00 a.m. today, all sectors of the capital held a celebration of the 5th anniversary of the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking at the city party headquarters auditorium. More than 100 representatives from various agencies and organizations attended. Shi Weihuan presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman reported, stating that the spirit of sacrifice shown by the National Revolutionary Army of our party when taking the oath for the Northern Expedition was extremely great. Therefore, from the Northern Expedition to unification, it took only three years, and the speed of success was rare in the world. However, in recent years, internal reactionary traitors have hindered peace and undermined unification, leading to the gathering of Red bandits and wanton abuse. Externally, we have been subjected to aggression by two red and white imperialists, resulting in increasingly dangerous border situations. Therefore, today, as we commemorate the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking, we should inherit the spirit of sacrifice of all the soldiers and strive to eliminate the Red bandits and suppress the reactionaries, and then unite against foreign aggression. Only in this way can the Chinese nation survive, and the achievements of our party's revolution can be permanently maintained.

<h3>Date of Summoning of London Experts Conference Has Been Decided</h3>
<p>July 17th</p>
<p>Britain and France Still Intend to Convene a Meeting of Finance Ministers</p>
<p>German Political Circles Believe This is Unnecessary</p>
<h3>Reuters, Paris, 8th</h3>
<p>France has agreed to July 17th as the date for experts to gather in London to discuss the reorganization of the Young Plan to suit the Hoover Plan rate, and in principle agreed to convene a meeting of German officials if necessary in the future.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Washington, 8th</h3>
<p>Acting Secretary of State Casell said today that the US government will send observers to attend the London Experts Conference in the middle of next week to discuss the suspension of payments.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, August 8th</h3>
<p>News from London and Paris indicates that the British and French governments are likely to convene two conferences to discuss unresolved issues remaining from the US-France agreement. Following the London Economic Experts Conference, another conference of national finance ministers must be convened in Paris. However, German political circles believe this is unnecessary, as the London conference can resolve all matters, large and small. Furthermore, once the agreement reached by the experts' conference is approved, it can be implemented through ordinary diplomatic channels. Finance ministers of various countries will likely be busy dealing with domestic problems arising from this matter in the coming weeks and will have no time to participate in any international conferences.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, London, August 8th</h3>
<p>It is now decided to convene an economic experts conference of the signatories to the Young Plan in London on July 17th to discuss the modalities of implementing the Hoover new plan. The United States will send a representative from the Treasury Department as an advisor to the conference, but there is no intention to act as chairman, as rumored.

<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, August 9th</h3>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Alas, Manchuria and Mongolia</h3>
<p>The local farmers in the Wanpaoshan Incident have already suffered significant losses, and the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Korea have been almost entirely destroyed. The Busan riots are still ongoing, and the discovered losses are incalculable. There are even reports of the destruction of the Consulate General in telegrams. The humiliation we suffer can be said to be extreme. However, the Japanese authorities only expressed regret in empty words in response to the protests of our resident envoys. The question of who is responsible for this incident has not been mentioned. The future is bleak and it is unknown how things will turn out.</p>
<p>Today, there is another regrettable event, namely, the detention of the Eurasia Aviation plane by Outer Mongolia. The German government believes that Outer Mongolia has become a part of Soviet Russia and does not negotiate with our country but with Soviet Russia. This action by the Germans is indeed strange, but our countrymen have always been indifferent to Outer Mongolia, willingly giving up. The fact is undeniable. How can we blame other countries? A nation must insult itself before others insult it. Soviet Russia has been painstakingly trying to seize our Outer Mongolia, and then to manage the issue of the North Manchurian Eastern Railway, and the conference is again unknown how it will turn out. How shocked and agitated will our countrymen be about the threat to Manchuria and Mongolia? And how will they be inspired to wash away the shame of self-insult?</p>
<p>There is no other way to remove the humiliation than to unite our hearts and minds, strengthen our organizations, promote our industries, cultivate our strength, and abandon all meaningless internal disputes, so that all people can work together to deal with foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Foreign Telegrams</h3>
<p>Guarantee and advance payments and the formation of the German Gold Discount Bank, the total amount of which is limited to 500 million gold marks. This order is the most urgent step in Germany's difficult financial situation. However, because it cannot obtain the benefits of a moratorium on reparations for the time being, it has no choice but to extract national financial resources to relieve its immediate needs and protect national credit.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Berlin, August 8th</h3>
<p>President Hindenburg has approved the government's issuance of an emergency decree recognizing the validity of the contract for a 500 million gold mark bridging loan between the national bank and German banks and commercial firms. Further telegram states: The German government has now issued a presidential decree signed by the ministers of finance and economy, recognizing the validity of the contract. This order will be implemented immediately to stabilize the national bank in order to negotiate a large loan with British and American banks. This loan must be completed before July 15th to avoid financial collapse. The one hundred million loaned to the National Bank last week will expire on July 15th, and other large payments must also be raised. The stock exchange has doubts about the effectiveness of the guarantee, and the market prices of many stocks have fallen, with some falling to eight pounds.</p>

<p>American Aviator's Feat</p>
<p>Non-Stop Flight Across the Pacific</p>
<p>Departing from Seattle to Tokyo</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Fairbanks, August 8th</h3>
<p>American aviators Robbins and Jones departed from Seattle at 3:59 this morning in a single-engine monoplane, attempting a non-stop flight across the Pacific in the hope of winning a 25,000 US dollar prize from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun. The weather along the way was very good. They arrived here at 9:33 tonight and refueled in the sky from another Ford aircraft, then flew to the Bering Strait at 9:48. They will refuel in the sky for the second time there before crossing the ocean to Tokyo. They are expected to reach their destination on Saturday morning.</p>
<h3>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, August 9th</h3>
<p>The average speed of the plane crossing the Pacific Ocean by Lominss and Junges is 78 miles per hour. Arrival at Tachikawa is expected around 1:00 PM on the 11th. Considering that the plane will arrive at night, 450 million candlepower searchlights have been prepared.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Fairbanks, August 8th</h3>
<p>American aviators Rawpings and Jones are flying directly to Tokyo, Japan, in the "West Point" airship without landing. They have flown to Fairbanks, Alaska, hovering 1,000 feet in the air to allow fuel to be injected from another aircraft. Hundreds of gallons of oil have now been injected. The aircraft carrying the oil will load fuel in Suloman and then accompany the "West Point" across the Bering Sea to perform the second sky refueling.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Tokyo, August 9th</h3>
<p>American aviators Rawpings and Jones are expected to arrive here on Saturday morning. Preparations for the reception are being rushed. Although the current climate is not very favorable, according to the Central Meteorological Observatory's prediction, there should be no difficulties. If they reach their destination, they will receive a 25,000 yen prize from the Asahi Shimbun.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Meets with Italian Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Mussolini Hosts Banquet</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Rome, August 8th</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Stimson had his first meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Grandi today. He is scheduled to visit Prime Minister Mussolini tomorrow, and Mussolini has scheduled a banquet for Mr. Stimson tomorrow evening. The content of the first meeting is currently unknown, but according to newspaper reports, it mainly discussed the fact that the world's arms race is a major cause of the world's economic panic, as Mr. Stimson is representing President Hoover in brokering various matters for next year's disarmament conference.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Rome, August 8th</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Stimson landed in Naples and arrived here late tonight by car. He has agreed to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini tomorrow, and has also agreed to meet with Italian Foreign Minister Grandi. Mr. Stimson departed within the past week. At that time, negotiations on the suspension of war debts had not yet been settled between France and the United States. Now, only minor details remain to be resolved by experts. Mr. Stimson will devote most of his energy to the success of next year's disarmament conference. Although Mr. Stimson told people that this trip was only a two-day summer vacation in Europe and did not bear a diplomatic mission, it is said that he will have detailed discussions on important world political issues with the authorities of Italy, France, Germany and England. At present, the obstacles to the success of disarmament are: First, the German-Austrian tax treaty. Although this measure is superficially based on friendship and benefits the trade of goods, those who viewed Germany's old neighbors see it as a gradual merger between Germany and Austria, which is alarming and frightening. Now, all those who want the success of disarmament hope that the International Court of Justice will rule on this case after the convocation of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The second is the naval dispute between France and Italy. Italy wants equality between the two countries and seeks to maintain its advantage. This is the biggest obstacle to the success of disarmament. The great powers hope that the two countries can reach a complete compromise before February of next year. France can also dispel its intention to seek a delay in the disarmament conference. Mr. Stimson attended the London Conference last year as the chief U.S. representative to the UK, but his visit to Europe as Secretary of State is an innovation in American history, except for former Secretary of State Hughes's attendance at the International Bar Association conference in London in 1914.</p>

<p>Telegrams</p>
<h3>Telegram from Yantai</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices and fellow countrymen across the country: We have recently received a telegram from Jiang, Commander-in-Chief, Zhang, Deputy Commander, He, Minister of Military Affairs, and Han, Chairman of Shandong, which reads: We have recently received a telegram from the Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Incheon stating that Japanese newspapers are promoting the Wanpaoshan Incident. Koreans in this port have been rioting violently since the Jiang River. Chinese shops in Pingyang, Wonsan, Sanlipo, Busan, and other places have been burned and looted, and our overseas Chinese have been brutally murdered. Some have had their hearts dug out and their abdomens cut open, and some have even been chopped into mince and forced to jump into the sea. The dead and wounded number approximately several thousand. The various atrocities are rarely heard of at home and abroad. Property losses are incalculable. Japanese police ostensibly provide protection, but actually connive. They wait behind the mobs until their atrocities have passed before pretending to expel them. All traffic has been suddenly cut off. The lives and deaths of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese are unknown. They are in a state of extreme crisis, eagerly awaiting rescue. We beg for assistance, etc. The various circles in Yantai held an emergency meeting on the same day and immediately formed a diplomatic support association to jointly find ways to rescue the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese. More than 1,000 overseas Chinese, including Yang Xinzai and Liu Xingxiang, who had escaped from Incheon and other places to this port, attended the meeting and tearfully recounted the previous events. They pleaded for relief and the crowd was indignant, vowing to support them. It has been found that this Korean riot was purely instigated by Japanese imperialists to realize their ambition of aggression. In addition to convening a mass meeting of citizens from all walks of life to discuss countermeasures and jointly deal with the situation, we have first telegraphed a reply. We hereby respectfully send a telegram to appeal to Your Excellency and respectfully request the central government to immediately lodge a protest with the Japanese government and conduct serious negotiations to immediately stop the Korean riots and protect the overseas Chinese. We will fight to the death to avenge this humiliation. We cannot bear to wait in urgent anticipation, etc. Therefore, we are sending a special telegram to request unanimous support, to express righteous indignation together, and to fight to the death with Japanese imperialists until we achieve our goal. The overseas Chinese are fortunate, the Party and the country are fortunate. Liu Zhennian, commander of the 21st Division of the Army, and all officers and soldiers kowtow together.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Yantai</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices and fellow countrymen across the country: Japanese imperialists used the illegal digging of trenches and planting of rice by Korean overseas Chinese in Wanpaoshan, Changchun County, Jilin Province, as an excuse to send military police to shoot and massacre our compatriots, killing and wounding thousands. They also used their news policy to instigate Koreans to plunder and kill our overseas Chinese compatriots. According to the tearful reports of more than 1,000 overseas Chinese, including Yang Xinzai and Liu Xingxiang, who escaped from Incheon and other places to this port, the riot situation in Incheon, Seoul, Pyongyang, Wonsan, Daegu, Zhennampo, and other places, the tragic massacre of overseas Chinese, and the coercion to jump into the sea resulted in the death and injury of several thousand people. The burning and looting have not stopped. Considering only the port of Incheon, the loss of property has reached several million yuan. Due to the severance of communications, it is impossible to explore other places. Also, overseas Chinese witnessed Japanese police in various places taking off their police hats to participate in the riots and directing them from the middle. Such brutal and ferocious behavior is even worse than the May 30th Massacre. After receiving this report, the people here were filled with righteous indignation and vowed to support them. In addition to contacting the Zhengji and Huitong Shipping Companies to immediately dispatch three ships to Incheon and other places to carry refugees back to the country, they also telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to order the China Merchants Bureau to dispatch ships to assist in the rescue. In addition, it was decided to convene a mass meeting of citizens on the appropriate day to jointly discuss countermeasures. It is hoped that the Party and state authorities will promptly lodge a protest with the Japanese government and conduct serious negotiations to immediately stop the Korean riots to rescue our tens of thousands of overseas Chinese from dire straits. In addition, we unanimously request fellow countrymen in various places to express righteous indignation together and fight to the end with Japanese imperialists to avenge this humiliation. Then the overseas Chinese will be fortunate, and the Party and the country will be fortunate. Shandong Fushan County Party Headquarters, Yantai Chamber of Commerce, County Farmers Association, Labor Union, District Education Association, News Reporters Association, Yantai National Goods Maintenance Group, 56 groups, and the entire population of the port kowtow together.</p>

<h3>A Word of Advice to the Japanese and Koreans Regarding the Wanpaoshan Incident, and Encouragement to Our Fellow Countrymen (Continued) Bin</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we have already understood the true cause of the Wanpaoshan Incident. As for the details of the incident, various domestic newspapers have recently published very detailed accounts, so there is no need for the reporter to repeat them. In order to make it easier for readers to understand the actual situation of the case and the unreasonable atrocities of the Japanese, three tables are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Table of Land Lease Relationships of Koreans in Wanpaoshan</p>
<p>Location　　　　　　Area of Leased Land　Original Landowners　　　　　　　　　　　　Lessee　　　　　　　　Brief Summary of Contract　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sub-Lessee　　　　　　　　Brief Summary of Sub-Lease Contract　　　　　　Remarks</p>
<p>Wanpaoshan　　　500 *xiang*　　　　　　Twelve people including Xiao Hanlin, Zhang Hongbin, and Meng Zhaoye　Hao Yongde, Manager of Changchun Inada Company　Effective for a term of ten years after approval by the Changchun County Government　　　　Nine Koreans including Li Shengxun and Li Zhaohe　　For a term of ten years　　　　　　(1) The lease contract between Hao Yongde and Xiao Hanlin, et al. was not formally approved by Changchun County. (2) Li Shengxun, et al. did not report the lease of the land to the Changchun authorities.</p>
<p>(2) Table of Damages Suffered by Our Farmers Due to the Koreans' Forced Construction of Waterways</p>
<p>Cause　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Damage　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Remarks</p>
<p>Koreans digging waterways and diverting water from the Yitong River　Encroachment on farmland along the way, approximately 20 *li* long and 7-8 *zhang* wide　The farmland belongs to 41 other people and has absolutely no contractual relationship with Hao Yongde and Li Shengxun, et al.</p>
<p>The soil excavated from the waterway is piled up on both sides to serve as dikes, approximately 7-8 *zhang* wide and over 20 *li* long　　　Over 400 *mu* of fertile land destroyed in total</p>
<p>The waterway passes through farmland, and the water flow erodes the farmland　　　　(1) The waterway divides each piece of cultivated land into two sections.</p>
<p>For the purpose of irrigating rice paddies, water from the Yitong River is diverted, and water-stopping dams are built across the existing riverbeds, forcing the water into the waterway. The dams obstruct the water flow, causing the river to overflow　(2) The water flow erodes the cultivated land, turning it into wasteland. The low-lying areas on both sides of the upper reaches of the river, over 2,000 *xiang* of farmland are flooded.</p>
<p>The area where Hao Yongde plans to plant rice paddies is relatively high in elevation and has no outlet for drainage　　Hundreds of *xiang* of low-lying farmland in the lower reaches are flooded</p>
<p>The low-lying areas on both sides of the waterway will inevitably be flooded when the river rises　　　Approximately 4-5,000 *xiang*</p>
<p>The Majia Shao Kou of the river is an important passage to and from the west bank. The Koreans are now blocking the water with dams　　　Traffic on both banks is cut off</p>
<p>The Yitong River has always been an important waterway for farmers in Changchun to transport goods during the summer. The Koreans are building dams across the river　　Public transportation is completely cut off</p>
<p>Hundreds of households living along the Yitong River depend on waterway transportation for their livelihood. The Koreans' construction of dams has cut off traffic　　　Livelihoods are all harmed</p>
<p>(3) Table of the Process of Local Negotiations and Japanese Atrocities</p>
<p>Time　　　　　Our Side　　　　　　　　Japanese Side　　　　　　　　　　　　Remarks</p>
<p>June 1st　　　　The Jilin Provincial Government ordered Changchun County to send personnel to cooperate with the county public security police to the dam construction site to persuade the Korean people to stop building the dam and leave the country by peaceful means.　　　The Korean people declared that they would not stop and would not leave the country even if it meant death. The Public Security Bureau took their leaders, Shen, et al., eight people, to the county government. According to their confession, they were ordered by the Japanese to plant rice.</p>
<p>June 3rd　　　　The Changchun County Public Security Bureau Chief and the Guard Team Leader led a team with Shen et al. to Majia Shao Kou where the water ditch was being dug, and physically drove away the Korean people working there.　　　　　Zhou Yuping, the director of the Changchun Municipal Government Preparatory Office, sent a letter to Japanese Consul Tadashi, protesting and demanding investigation of the illegal Korean people, Shen Yongjun et al., who had been detained, as well as the instigators and compensation for our losses.　　　　　After Sino-Japanese consultation, it was agreed to send personnel to investigate the truth on-site and then resolve it fairly. During the investigation period, the Korean people should immediately stop working.</p>
<p>June ?th　　　　　　　　　　　　　The Japanese Consul still ordered the Japanese police to protect the Korean people to continue building the dam.</p>
<p>June 12th　　　The Municipal Government Office sent another letter to the Japanese Consul, stating that the Japanese side should bear full responsibility for any disputes that may arise in the future.</p>
<p>June ?th　　　　　　　　　　　　　The Japanese Consul replied that the dam had not yet started construction, that digging the ditch would not harm farming, and that the dispatched Japanese police were solely responsible for cracking down on the Korean people.</p>
<p>June 17th　　　The Municipal Government Office sent another letter to the Japanese Consul, hoping that both sides would deal with the matter fairly based on the facts investigated.</p>
<p>June ?th　　　The Consul General of Shenyang, Lin, met with Zhang Zuoxiang of the Jilin Provincial Government and made representations. The Provincial Government advocated that the case should still be handled locally and was unwilling to take responsibility, leading to prolonged negotiations. By the end of June, the Korean farmers were intensifying the construction of the dam as the harvest was already delayed. Our farmers, seeing the water overflowing from the paddy fields and encroaching on dry land, and seeing that the autumn harvest was hopeless, were filled with resentment and agreed to drive them away if the Korean people continued to work, and sent representatives to urge the Municipal Government Office to conduct a final negotiation with the Japanese Consul.</p>
<p>June ?th　　　　　　　　　　　　　The Japanese side decided on a policy of "on-site protection" and "promoting dam construction", purchased a large amount of food and transported it to Wanpaoshan, and transported more than 5,000 bundles of willow branches and more than 500 peach soil baskets to supervise the Korean people to speed up the work, requiring completion before July 5th, and forced the Korean people to randomly plant rice seeds on the wasteland of our people, which was everywhere.</p>
<p>June 27th　　　The Municipal Government Office sent another letter to the Japanese Consul to negotiate.</p>
<p>June 30th　　　The farmers and landlords who were harmed in Wanpaoshan Town and the farmers in the nearby rice-growing areas held a rally in Wanpaoshan Town to support resistance to the Koreans' construction of weirs. More than 500 people attended, responsible officers were appointed, and it was decided to fill the trenches and destroy the dikes.</p>
<p>July 2nd　　　　The farmers of Wanpaoshan gathered 400-500 people and implemented the filling of the trenches. The Municipal Government Office sent a letter to the Japanese Consul requesting the withdrawal of the Japanese police and appropriate punishment.　The Japanese police openly fired live ammunition at the farmers, firing a total of 38 shots. The Japanese Consul did not reply to the letter from the Municipal Government Office and sent a garrison and 60 armed police to Wanpaoshan to protect the Korean people's work, surrounding our farmers and the Ma police and strafing them with machine guns, killing more than a dozen farmers and two Ma police officers.　The chief of the Tian Branch of the Third District Police Station under the jurisdiction of Jilin County came forward to mediate and temporarily persuaded the farmers to return.</p>
<p>July 3rd　　　　　　　　　　　　　The Japanese side sent another 16 Japanese police officers, two heavy vehicles, loaded with military tents, military supplies and food, two machine guns, and ammunition, and dug battle trenches in places such as Majia Shao Kou.　Former Japanese Foreign Minister, the Japanese Yen, sent a telegram to the Japanese Consul in Shenyang, stating that the Japanese government, from the point of view of protecting Japanese residents in Manchuria, had to take appropriate measures, and the result might lead to a very serious situation. The Japanese military in Dalian scheduled a combat air defense exercise from the 4th to the 7th, and would demonstrate and publicize along the South Manchurian Railway to Shenyang. 46 Japanese armed police fired 60-70 shots at our suppression police as a demonstration, but no one was injured. The Japanese Consul General in Jilin requested compensation from the Provincial Government for the losses of the Korean farmers.</p>
<p>Note: This table is based on the news reported in various newspapers recently, and there may be errors and omissions.</p>
<p>However, the table can make the reader see the unreasonable atrocities of the Japanese at a glance, so it is presented first and will be revised later.</p>
<p>After the Wanpaoshan Incident occurred, the Japanese still did not realize their errors, as if deeply worried that they would not be able to increase the grief and indignation of our people, increase our people's resentment against Japan, and further incite the Korean people to attack our Korean-based compatriots. According to reports in the continuous newspapers, violent anti-Chinese riots in which Korean mobs brutally massacred our overseas compatriots occurred in Pyongyang, Seoul, Incheon, Jemulpo, Wonsan, Busan, and other cities. There were many deaths, injuries, and losses. The situation is extremely serious. Most of the attacked overseas compatriots fled to Andong, Liaoning, which borders Korea, for refuge. After the purpose of the Korean people's attack had been achieved, they deliberately sent police to suppress them. The Japanese Cabinet also resolved to comfort our overseas compatriots who had been victimized and severely punish the Korean rioters. This kind of deliberately deceptive diplomatic trickery may be considered by the Japanese to be able to cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world. In fact, their intentions and the truth have long been exposed. The Japanese must defy the great disapproval of the world and repeatedly create unbearable tragedies. What else can we say? To what extent the Wan Incident will expand in the future is difficult to predict at this time. Or it can end here and be shelved as a pending case. It is also possible. But since the Japanese have such determination, there will undoubtedly be more incidents in the coming years that are several times more serious than the Wan Incident. We look at the current situation, mourn the urgency of resisting foreign insults, and grieve for the current hardship of the country. The feeling of grief and indignation is uncontrollable. When I write this, I am truly in tears. Alas, my countrymen, you should also have the same feelings. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial service at 9:00 a.m. on July 9th for the 5th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition Oath-Taking Ceremony in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. Above the auditorium was a horizontal banner with the four characters "Strive to the End". The slogans on both sides were "Inherit the spirit of the oath-taking ceremony, suppress the traitors, eliminate the Red bandits" and "Guarantee the victory of the Northern Expedition, consolidate unity, and maintain peace." Central Committee members Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Shao Yuancong, Ye Chucang, Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Fang Juehui, Chen BuLei, Wang Boqun, Ke Xinge, Miao Peicheng, and representatives from various agencies and departments, as well as staff members, totaling about five or six hundred people, attended. Ding Weifen presided over the meeting. After the music and ceremony, Shao Lizi reported on the process and achievements of the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition Oath-Taking Ceremony, saying that five years ago today, the National Revolutionary Army held the Northern Expedition Oath-Taking Ceremony in Guangzhou with great enthusiasm. Premier Sun devoted his life to the National Revolution and undertook two Northern Expeditions, which he did not complete.　His will was to carry on to the survivors to inherit their responsibilities and careers. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek was entrusted by the Party to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army. At that time, with the military and financial resources of Guangdong, he undertook the great cause of the Northern Expedition. The situation was very difficult. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek was determined to follow Premier Sun's will as the standard, carefully observe the trend of popular sentiment, and firmly believe that Guangdong could be unified within one year and the whole country within three years. At that time, Russian advisers on the Northern Expedition military did not advocate advancing from Guangxi and Hunan to the Yangtze River, but advocated following the sea route north from the northern seaports and landing with troops. This was probably for other purposes. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek had the spirit of perseverance and decisively made plans to move forward. At that time, the revolutionary armed forces were far less adequate than the warlords. Relying on all the armed comrades, who believed in the doctrine and received thorough political training, they had strict discipline and uplifted spirit, so they were able to defeat the many with the few. After establishing the capital in Nanjing, they went through many dangers. Sun Chuanfang returned to power and approached the capital area. The Communist Party created disturbances in the rear. The imperialists tried every possible way to destroy them. The National Revolutionary Army moved forward bravely without slackening their fighting spirit due to these obstacles. With one mind, they strove to persevere. In the 17th year, the army arrived in Jinan, and the imperialists colluded with the warlords to obstruct our Northern Expedition, creating the May 3rd Massacre. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek had profound plans and foresaw the location of their poisonous schemes, and would rather endure pain and humiliation than initiate a conflict with them and fall into their trap. With swift military action, he reached Beiping in the shortest time and unified the whole country. Thinking about the pain now, on this memorial occasion, we should remember the difficulty of success and cultivate its spirit. Now, the Communist bandits in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are massacring the people in a tragic manner. Commander Chiang Kai-shek, in the midst of the summer heat, is leading his armed comrades in sacrifice and struggle to save the people from fire and water. The National Revolution will not succeed until the Communist bandits are eliminated. What is even more regrettable is that the Japanese deliberately provoked trouble. After the Wanpaoshan Incident occurred, they used the Korean people to massacre our overseas compatriots and implement a strict anti-Chinese policy. Many overseas compatriots were killed, and they wanted to use this opportunity to expand the turmoil and create a second Jinan Massacre, sending troops to the Northeast to achieve their aggressive ambitions. All kinds of conspiracies have been completely exposed. This is truly the autumn of our country's crisis and survival. All my comrades, during this memorial period, should know that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and work together and strive to the end, etc. Shao also proposed that the comrades attending the meeting today observe a moment of silence to express their condolences for the generals who died in the Northern Expedition and the overseas compatriots who were killed by the Korean people this time. Fang Juehui then spoke, saying that the Korean people's anti-Chinese riots this time were a manifestation of the Japanese side's entire plan for China. In the future, we must recognize the Korean people residing in the three northeastern provinces as Japanese residents, not as Korean people, and must correct their names to clarify the responsibility. We must also quickly and accurately investigate the actual number of deaths, injuries, and property losses to provide a basis for negotiations, etc. After the speech, the ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>National Government</h3>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held a memorial ceremony for the National Revolutionary Army's Oath-Taking Ceremony. Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Ye Chucang, Wang Zhengting, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, Shao Yuancong, Lin Xiang, and representatives from various departments and bureaus, as well as more than two hundred staff members from the National Government's civil service and military affairs offices, attended. Yu Youren presided over the meeting. After leading the ceremony, Ye Chucang gave a speech, saying: Comrades, today we are holding a memorial ceremony for the 5th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition Oath-Taking Ceremony. Five years ago today, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, entrusted by our Party and adhering to Premier Sun's will, launched the Northern Expedition from Guangzhou amidst the warm welcome of the people of the whole country. In the past five years, through constant difficulties and sacrifices, many comrades lost their lives, and at the same time, the people in the war zone have also suffered instability and losses before we have today. In recent years, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been inspecting and commanding the troops on the front lines during our memorial ceremonies, attacking Feng Yuxiang last year and suppressing the Communists this year. He, along with all the officers and soldiers, has been working hard for the country, regardless of the heat and danger. We should, on the one hand, use boundless enthusiasm to comfort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and all the officers and soldiers, and on the other hand, cherish Premier Sun's great instructions. At the same time, we should work hard to complete Premier Sun's will in times of difficulty. The armed comrades on the front lines are working hard for the country, and the comrades in the rear should also have their own efforts. However, sometimes we feel that we do not know how to work hard. We think of the comrades on the front lines, who are armed and fighting to save the people. This is the duty of the comrades on the front lines. We should also strive to do our duty. If we can abide by our duty, that is the greatest effort. Often, some people think that it is only possible to be called effort if they bear great responsibilities, do great things, and have high-level plans. If they only abide by their duty, it seems that it is not enough effort. This is a big mistake. I believe that we should only be afraid of not being able to do our duty, and do not worry about not being able to do enough. My comrades should only take one duty, that is, to complete Premier Sun's will. May I ask how much of this great and arduous project has been completed by us in recent years? If we just think about this point, the Party members owe too much and are far from their duty, let alone anything else. Duty is not passive, but active. If we can take the purpose of abiding by our duty, then nothing will be impossible and nothing will be indestructible. Any opinion can be eliminated. I am a local official, and I do not seem to be able to do even one-tenth or one-hundredth of the duty of a local official, so I dare not and should not do anything beyond my duty, because it is already very difficult to complete the duty. A clerk in the government diligently engages in clerical work, and a political official diligently engages in political work. Each performs his duties and does his best, which is to abide by his duty and to strive to do his duty. We should encourage each other to complete Premier Sun's will. Let us think about the people in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi who are being ravaged by the Red bandits, which has led to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and all the officers and soldiers fighting after the success of the Northern Expedition. At the same time, thinking of the recent heavy rains and disasters, and the harm done by the Communists, who are like floods and fierce beasts, the floods have caused great harm to the local areas, but the local officials have a great responsibility for disaster relief and preparedness. Now, let me ask how much has been done? In view of the efforts of the officers and soldiers on the front lines, the comrades in the rear should encourage each other more carefully. If we can abide by our duties, so that the war against the Red bandits can end soon and the construction undertakings can be completed as soon as possible, on this memorial day, comrades should recall the difficulties of the past and work harder to achieve the ideal and hope of political affairs as soon as possible. Everyone must encourage each other to work hard in order to be worthy of the officers and soldiers who died since the Northern Expedition and Premier Sun's instructions to us.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Japanese Police Atrocities in the Wanpaoshan Incident</h3>
<p>More than a dozen Chinese wounded, two or three dead, and more than a dozen arrested</p>
<p>The Japanese army stationed in Changchun urgently decided to mobilize on a large scale</p>
<p>Various Chinese organizations in Changchun also decided on countermeasures</p>
<p>Taking the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the release of Chinese farmers as a prerequisite</p>
<p>Changchun dispatch: The Sino-Japanese rice paddy negotiations in Wanpaoshan are worsening. The local landlords and villagers who have been harmed, seeing that the government is unable to drive away the Korean people and stop the digging work, have to take self-defense actions. Therefore, the support association has gathered four or five hundred farmers and workers, each holding shovels and hoes, and started filling the trenches at 7:38 a.m. on the 2nd of this month. Unexpectedly, a dozen Japanese police officers protecting the rice paddies opened fire. The smoke filled the sky. Dozens of Chinese farmers were injured, and two or three died. After the Chinese people retreated into the village courtyard, the Japanese police continued to pursue them and arrested fifteen or sixteen villagers, severely torturing them with hanging, pouring kerosene and chili water, and flogging them with clubs. They were covered with scars. Then they were transferred from Wanpaoshan to the Japanese police station for detention. After the tragedy occurred, the Japanese police department sent out carrier pigeons to report to the Japanese consulate and police station in Changchun. Consul Tadashi and Police Chief Take Nami reported the incident. At 11:48 a.m. on the 2nd, they dispatched three teams of ten Japanese police officers in two military vehicles, fully loaded with guns and ammunition, to provide assistance and issued orders for appropriate action. This group of Japanese police officers arrived at Wanpaoshan Town at 2:55 p.m. and rushed to the rice paddies to assist the Japanese police, going to various villages to continue arresting people and confiscating self-defense guns and ammunition from Chinese farmers. At the same time, Japanese Consul Tadashi and Police Chief Takenami gathered the 3rd Brigade, the 4th Regiment, and the Gendarmerie at the consulate for an emergency military meeting. Commander Nakagawakinzo and Squadron Leader Major Nakamura and others attended, totaling fifty or sixty people. The meeting resulted in five resolutions: (1) continue to send troops and take decisive measures, using maximum force to suppress the Chinese farmers; (2) issue an ultimatum to the Chinese government, demanding a satisfactory reply within 48 hours, otherwise, take final action; (3) Japan will provide practical assistance to the Korean people in the Wanpaoshan rice paddies and continue to urge them to work; (4) call for assistance from all Japanese people in Manchuria and assist in publicity in public opinion; (5) send telegrams to the Japanese government, the Lushun Civil Administration Office, the Kanto Office, and the highest Chinese government officials regarding the rice paddy case and the current situation, and lodge serious protests. In addition, a mobilization order was issued and troops were dispatched. It was found that around 3:00 p.m. on the 2nd, 50 cavalrymen from the garrison set off from Changchun. At 11:20 a.m. on the 3rd, another 20 military policemen were sent to provide assistance. Around 1:00 p.m., another 500 police officers were dispatched, all equipped with two machine guns, two rapid-fire cannons, five or six boxes of ammunition, five hundred artillery shells, and more than two hundred large guns, hundreds of small guns, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. They were issued to the Korean people for "self-defense", but in reality, they were preparing for war. By 2:00 p.m. on the 3rd, a large number of Japanese police and troops had left Changchun one after another and went straight to Wanpaoshan.</p>
<p>Our government authorities are still dealing with this kind of Japanese atrocity calmly. In addition to immediately notifying the county government and public security bureau by telegram from the Third Public Security Branch of the county district to request instructions, the county government reported to the municipal government office and the foreign affairs department, requesting that a protest be lodged with Japan immediately to avoid expanding the scope of the negotiations. The municipal director and foreign affairs director, Zhou Yuping, considered that the Japanese police had opened fire on unarmed farmers, which was inhumane and damaging to national relations. Furthermore, the large-scale dispatch of troops to demonstrate and suppress was a breach of agreement. On the 2nd and 3rd, he summoned County Magistrate Ma, Chamber of Commerce President Sun, Public Security Bureau Chief Lu, Security Team Chief Tang, and leaders of local organizations to the office for an emergency meeting. As a result, it was decided (1) to lodge a final protest with Japan, requesting the withdrawal of the dispatched military police and to stop their illegal activities; (2) the county government would quickly dispatch 300 police and security forces to protect the farmers and monitor the actions of the Japanese army; (3) send personnel to investigate the cause of the disturbance and to express condolences to the wounded and dead villagers; (4) instruct the Japanese consul to order the Korean people to stop digging trenches and building dams and to await resolution by the Sino-Japanese governments; (5) report the truth about the Japanese police firing on our farmers by telegram to the Liaoning and Jilin provincial governments and to the Japanese consul general for serious negotiations; (6) the foreign affairs department requested the Japanese consul to release all the more than ten arrested Chinese people and to compensate our wounded and dead. Based on the above countermeasures, in addition to handling the matter, Director Zhou personally went to the Japanese consulate in Changchun on the 2nd and 3rd and had face-to-face negotiations with Tadashi Judoku, demanding the withdrawal of a large number of military police and the release of the arrested Chinese farmers as a prerequisite, and other matters would be negotiated later. However, after the tragedy occurred, the citizens were very angry and organized a diplomatic support association to serve as a backing for the government and to provide practical assistance to the negotiations, which is currently being actively prepared and will be realized in the near future (July 3rd).</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Korea Arrive in Beijing to Plead</h3>
<p>Korean People Gathered in Mobs and Tragically Harmed Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Earnestly Requesting the Government and Yuan to Lodge Serious Protests with Japan</p>
<p>Beijing News: The tragic case of Korean people massacring Chinese people, which has caused a national sensation, has aroused the public outrage in all circles of our country. The Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Korea, due to Korean people gathering in mobs and tragically injuring our overseas compatriots, and the lives and property of the overseas compatriots are in imminent danger, yesterday dispatched representatives Liu Zhongkui and Cao Jingyu, who rushed to Beijing overnight, carrying petitions, earnestly asking the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee to care about the lives of the people, pay attention to the commercial situation, and quickly negotiate seriously with the Japanese envoy, and to urgently telegraph the Governor-General of Korea to quickly stop the atrocities of the Korean people and find ways to protect the lives and property of the Chinese people in order to save overseas Chinese merchants and maintain the industry. The original text of the representatives' petitions to the National Government and various Yuan and ministries is recorded below and published separately.</p>
<h3>Submission to the National Government Original Text</h3>
<p>Respectfully submitted regarding the violent uprising of Koreans, the tragic injury to the property and lives of overseas Chinese, the escalating situation, and the urgent need to request the swift issuance of an order to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to devise a means of stopping it, in order to protect overseas Chinese property and preserve the lives of our people. It is our understanding that the initial cause of the conflict between Chinese and Korean farmers in Wanbaoshan, Jilin, was the unreasonable and overbearing behavior of the Korean people. However, Japanese newspapers openly fabricated stories of Chinese people oppressing Koreans, deliberately stirring up trouble and exaggerating the situation to incite the gullible Korean population, creating animosity between the two sides. Their country seeks to use the hands of the Koreans to achieve its goal of expelling our overseas Chinese. The Korean people, without examining the facts or considering justice, relied solely on one-sided accounts, recklessly indulging in their cruel intentions. Like a gathering storm, they expanded their actions together. Recently, in places such as the capital, Incheon, Wonsan, Busan, and Pyongyang, tragedies of murdering Chinese people similar to those in 1927 have unfolded, surpassing them in severity. Like a wildfire, they cannot be approached. Detailed information has been published in various newspapers in recent days. Merchants have also received numerous urgent telegrams. Countless Chinese merchants in Korea have been forced to suspend their businesses, their property and lives destroyed. The perilous situation worsens with each passing day. Upon investigation, it is found that the areas of the capital, Incheon, Wonsan, Busan, and Pyongyang are all prosperous and important regions of Korea, heavily guarded by military police. Yet, such events have occurred openly. What more can be said of remote areas? If swift action is not taken to stop it, it will inevitably spread throughout Korea. It is clear that the property and lives of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese merchants in Korea are at risk, and the cruelty will undoubtedly lead to unimaginable consequences. At this critical moment of survival, we are compelled to represent all overseas Chinese merchants in Korea and appeal to you urgently, requesting your government to immediately order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese ambassador, and to request the ambassador to urgently telegraph the Governor-General of Korea to quickly stop the violent actions of the Koreans and to take full responsibility for protecting the safety of the lives and property of our overseas Chinese. As for the punishment of the perpetrators and compensation, we ask that you first declare and reserve the right to address these matters later. We submit this urgent appeal with utmost concern and anxiety to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Submission to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Respectfully submitted regarding the violent uprising of Koreans, the tragic injury to overseas Chinese, the escalating situation, and the urgent need to request the swift transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to devise a means of stopping it, in order to protect overseas Chinese property and preserve lives. It is our understanding that the initial cause of the conflict between Chinese and Korean farmers in Wanbaoshan, Jilin, was the unreasonable and overbearing behavior of the Korean people. However, the media in that country fabricated stories of Chinese people oppressing Koreans, deliberately inciting emotions and exaggerating the situation to sensationalize it. The farmers of that country also failed to examine the facts or investigate justice, relying solely on the clamor of the media, recklessly indulging in their cruel and violent intentions. Like a gathering storm, they blindly followed and joined in. Recently, in places such as the capital, Incheon, Wonsan, and Busan, tragedies of hating and murdering Chinese people similar to those in 1927 have unfolded. Detailed information has been published in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers on July 5th and 6th. Merchants have also received numerous telegrams, and countless businesses have been forced to suspend operations. The situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and the situation is precarious. Upon investigation, it is found that the areas of the capital, Incheon, Busan, and Wonsan are all major regions of Korea, heavily guarded by military police. Yet, such events have occurred. Remote areas must be even worse. If swift action is not taken to stop it, it will inevitably spread throughout Korea, leading to unimaginable consequences. It is clear that the lives and property of tens of thousands of overseas Chinese merchants in Korea are in imminent danger of complete ruin, with no way to protect themselves. The cruel situation could not be worse. At this critical moment of life and death, we are compelled to send representatives Liu Zhongkui and Zeng Jingyu overnight to appeal to you urgently, requesting your government to immediately transfer this matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to immediately notify the Japanese Consulate, and to urgently telegraph the Governor-General of Korea to quickly stop the violent actions of the Koreans and devise a means of protecting the safety of the overseas Chinese. We submit this urgent appeal with utmost anxiety and await your orders to the President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Circumstances of Sino-Russian Talks</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Run, Secretary of the Delegation, Returns Home</p>
<p>The Issue of Redeeming the Railway is Changed to Informal Discussions Outside of the Meeting</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Regarding the progress of discussions in the Sino-Russian talks on the issue of redeeming the railway, the lack of detailed reports from Mo Dehui upon his return home has left the nation uncertain about the specifics. Yesterday at 8:00 AM, Mr. Wu Run, secretary of the delegation, and Ms. Fu Dejin, clerk, returned home together. I visited Mr. Wu at the Beijing Hotel at 9:30 PM last night and inquired about the progress of the meeting. According to him, his return home was to deliver diplomatic documents, which have already been submitted to the Office of the Superintendent of the Eastern Railway and forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Tomorrow, he will go to Liaoning to visit his family and, if necessary, go to Beiping to meet with the Deputy Commander to report. The round trip will take three weeks, and he will return to Russia via this route. The two special envoys, Tu Wei Zeng and Wang Zeng'en, who returned home earlier, have been urged by Mo Quan to return quickly. It is estimated that the two gentlemen will depart for Russia around July 10th. Since Mo Quan's second trip to Russia, the Sino-Russian talks have held six formal meetings on the issue of redeeming the railway and three meetings on changing the Eastern Railway's management methods. Since the ninth meeting, the intervals between formal sessions have gradually shortened. The ninth meeting was held on June 21st, the tenth on June 24th, and the eleventh on June 29th. The twelfth meeting is scheduled for July 4th. Both parties are unwilling to prolong the meeting period, so progress has been quite active. Due to the vastness of the railway's assets, including locomotives, bridges, tracks, and culverts, it is difficult to estimate the price without specialized technical personnel. However, this cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. Both parties agreed to change the issue to informal discussions outside of the meeting to save time. The two plenipotentiaries will hold informal discussions, and they are currently discussing the procedures to expedite the case and how to negotiate the price. Therefore, there has been no actual standstill. Previous reports in domestic and foreign newspapers claiming that Russia had demanded 1.8 billion were premature because neither party is currently prepared to demand or offer a price. The Chinese side proposed the issue of changing the Eastern Railway's management methods because there are many outstanding issues with the Eastern Railway that the Council has not resolved over the years. Therefore, it was specifically raised for discussion at this time. Both parties are currently studying the agenda, and it has not yet reached the stage of formally discussing counter-proposals. It is difficult to predict Russia's views on redeeming the railway and changing the railway's management methods. However, the diplomatic situation changes depending on the political situation in both countries. Recently, the Russian side has observed slight fluctuations in our country's political situation and inevitably harbors a wait-and-see attitude towards the meeting. Recent Japanese newspaper reports claiming that Britain and Russia have proposed twelve management method proposals and that we have proposed eight are purely fabricated. It is hoped that domestic newspapers will correct this. Mo Quan has no intention of returning home to report. The spreading of this rumor is also propagated by a third party and contains ulterior motives. (July 4th)</p>
<h3>Fang and Shao's Factions Attempt to Flee to Wuyuan</h3>
<p>Unable to Enter Fujian, Bandit Gangs Plan to Invade Anhui</p>
<p>Currently Encircled and About to be Eliminated</p>
<p>Wuyuan Dispatch: The two bandit factions of Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping in Eastern Jiangxi, after being besieged by the Ruan and Xu divisions in March, fled from Guangfeng and Qianshan to the areas of Pucheng, Chong'an, Shangxia Mei in Northern Fujian, colluding with local Triad members, engaging in rampant arson and looting. Subsequently, the Fujian provincial defense forces, Qian Yuguang's brigade, the marine corps of Lin Bingzhou's brigade, and the units of Zhou Zequn and Liu Shangzhi, advanced in separate routes to suppress them. The Fang faction then withdrew from Fujian and fled back to Tai'an in Jiangxi Province. Recently, due to Jiangxi Province's large-scale suppression of the Communists, the Ruan division stationed in Eastern Jiangxi also actively encircled the Fang and Shao bandit factions. They made contact with the main force of the Fang and Shao factions in Wannian. The Fang bandits were unable to withstand the attack, suffering a major defeat and collapse. Their remaining two thousand or so men, led by Shao Shiping, fled from Wannian to the eight or nine districts of Dexing, and then planned to directly attack Wucheng (the eight districts are forty miles from Wucheng), hoping to resist stubbornly by relying on the terrain. On the 27th of last month, the Shao faction crossed the river at Tongbu and invaded the southern territory of Wuyuan. At 6:00 AM that day, they captured Caomen Village, looting all of its hundred or so households. At 9:00 AM, another large force of five or six hundred men attacked Taibai Town. The local self-defense corps of the town initially resisted fiercely, but later retreated due to being outnumbered. The bandits then entered the market and searched, sparing no business in the entire town. Before leaving, they kidnapped four hostages, including the grandson of tea merchant Xue Yucheng, demanding a ransom of 4,000 yuan, giving them three days to prepare the money and bring it to Wang Village in Shitian for redemption, or they would tear up the tickets. Nearby Dong Village and six or seven other villages were all searched and looted. After their plunder, they returned to the eight districts of Dexing. On the same day, a tea boat from northern Wuyuan was passing through Tongbu when it was spotted by the bandits, who opened fire to stop it. All the hundreds of cases of tea on the boat were moved ashore. The four members of the boat's crew, Jin Xinyan and his father, were also kidnapped, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. It is reported that the cases of tea carried on this boat were all famous Chouxin Zhenmei teas from northern Wuyuan, worth a huge sum of money. For a time, the situation on the border of Wuyuan became very tense. Magistrate Gao received an alarm about the capture of Taibai and Caomen, and considering the weakness of the city's defenses, he consulted with Zhang's Deputy Battalion Commander of the 55th Division's guerrilla forces and dispatched dozens of soldiers, together with the county police brigade and the Wuyuan southern militia, to pursue them. Because the bandits did not advance, on the 28th, the bandits became even more rampant. The main force of Shao's bandits actually attempted to enter the entire city of Wucheng. Zhang's Deputy Battalion Commander, realizing the perilous situation, immediately ordered martial law. He first closed the city gates on the northeast, south, and east sides, leaving only the west gate open. The ferry across the river surrounding the city was closed, and land and water traffic was cut off, prohibiting people from freely entering or leaving. He also prohibited moving goods or relocating. On one side, the houses near the city walls were demolished, and on the other, the villagers were recruited, with each family sending one person, each holding a bird gun or hunting gun, along with the merchant corps and police team, to climb the city walls and defend them in strict formation. On the 29th and 30th, the military and civilians patrolled the city, not slacking off for two nights. The villages in the Zhongyun area of the southern countryside, fearing that the bandits would attack the county seat, which was an inevitable route, also summoned three thousand hunters and farmers from various districts, each holding a flintlock, pine cannon, and concentrated them at Baishi Cen, a strategic pass leading from Jiangxi, to block and intercept them. Therefore, Shao's bandits retreated from Haikou to Nuanshui Jiudu Jiaocun yesterday (30th). Today, the city defenses have not been lifted because the bandits have not retreated far. However, according to a report from Zhongyun this afternoon, a battalion of reinforcements has arrived in Taibai, and part of the Fourth Division is also being deployed from Yushan to Wuyuan. Two regiments of the 55th Division continued to arrive in Dexing, and Division Commander Ruan also personally arrived in Deyi to command. People's hearts were slightly comforted. Moreover, Shao's bandits are already surrounded. Once the various armies launch a joint attack, it will not be difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. (July 1st)</p>
<h3>The Catastrophe of Flooding in Northwest Jiang of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>More than 40,000 Refugees in North River, with More Than 10,000 Drowned and Starved to Death</p>
<p>Dozens of Enclosures Collapsed in Various Places, the Tragedy No Less Than in the Year of Yimao</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The floods in the Northwest River this time have been disastrous. The West River basin has become a swamp. The disaster situation in the North River is no less than in the year of Yimao. Taking only the disaster areas in the Yingde, Qingyuan, and Yuantan areas as an example, there are currently more than 40,000 refugees in the disaster area. About four or five thousand people have drowned or starved to death. The property loss is no less than several million yuan. The disaster situation in various places obtained in recent days is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>North River</h3>
<p>Along the Guangshao Road to the villages near Yuantan Station, no roof ridge can be seen. The entire area is a vast expanse of water. The water in the rice fields is more than twenty feet deep. Refugees are scattered on the hills, exposed to the wind and eating in the open. In Fuan Village, District Eight of Qingyuan, the floodwaters are more than thirty feet deep. About 5,000 refugees are there. Seeing the Guangzhou relief team arrive, they rushed to them in small boats, dividing the food among themselves. These refugees have not eaten for several days. According to the investigation of the relief team, there are currently more than 6,000 refugees in Zhouxin Township, Qingyuan, about 3,000 disaster victims in Dalangdi Township, about 2,000 disaster victims in Dayou Liao Township, about 6,000 at the mouth of the Pijiang River, about 4,000 refugees in Hengshi, about 3,000 refugees in Lidong, and refugees in smaller and more remote villages are too numerous to count. About two-thirds of the houses in each village have collapsed, and the rice fields and fruit trees have been completely washed away. No less than two or thirty of the levees in each village have been breached. Among them, the Shijiao Levee in Qingyuan is the most important because the levee is at the key point where the northern flood goes south. It was on the verge of collapsing twice this time. Fortunately, the villagers nearby knew the relationship with their lives and property. In advance, all the men were conscripted to guard the levee. On the first of this month, the levee was breached by the floodwaters of the North River by seven or eight feet. The villagers immediately sounded the alarm to rescue and gathered thousands of people to transport pre-stored sandbags to block the breach, which turned the crisis into safety. Extending to 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, it suddenly rained heavily, and mountain floods broke out again. The water flow was more rapid than before. The Shijiao Levee was breached again by two or three feet. The villagers rescued at the risk of their lives, and seven or eight sand-carrying boats filled the breach, and dozens of villages inside the levee were spared from disaster. However, the floodwaters flooded all the villages, and it has been more than three feet deep. On the night of the 3rd, Dalang Yue was breached by several feet. From Yuantan and below, although the water level has been slower since the 4th, it is still a vast expanse of water. Currently, the loss to the Yue Shao Railway is about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan because the subgrade above and below Pijiang Station has collapsed for a total of more than 600 feet. More than a thousand feet of the 61st pile position of Shao Station has collapsed, and another 2,000 feet have collapsed in Bancun. The full road will not be repaired and opened to traffic in less than a month's project.</p>
<h3>West River</h3>
<p>Among the disaster areas in the West River, the area under the jurisdiction of Sanshui County is the most tragic because the southwest of Sanshui is the confluence of the West River and the North River into the Pearl River. From Huangtang along Mafang, about twenty miles below Luba in Sanshui, to Hekou, Shiwanshan and Foshan, the two banks have become swamps. The rice fields have been submerged. At 3:00 AM one morning, the Daqiang Levee near Shangtang (this levee is a barrier for the Shijiao Levee in Qingyuan) collapsed for several hundred feet. Various places inside the levee have become huge immersions. Also, the Meitai Levee in the northern district of Sanshui also collapsed by more than a hundred feet. This levee was breached once in the flood in the year of Yimao. This is the second collapse. Only one-third of the disaster victims in nearby villages escaped. Also, the Mumian base levee under the county's jurisdiction suddenly broke through at 3:00 AM on the night of the 30th of last month. Fortunately, the rescue was effective and did not cause a horizontal break. However, it was in danger again on the evening of the 1st of this month. The villagers rescued day and night and managed to support it. As for the Dapu Levee, it was ineffective to rescue it, and finally dozens of feet of breaches. The water was terrible, and more than a dozen villages became swamps. The Xiebian Levee under the jurisdiction of Nanhai has been breached and blocked repeatedly in recent days. The southwest station of the Guangsan Road has been submerged by water. Passengers use boats instead of walking. Along the Guangsan Railway subgrade, it is also in a huge immersion. The rails of the Sanyanqiao, Tanbian, Chatou Henghe and five stations have been flooded by West flood. (July 7th and 5th)</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Flood in Eastern Anhui</h3>
<p>Mingguang Dispatch: In the areas of Gan Ding in Eastern Anhui, there has been heavy rain for days, causing mountain torrents and a sudden rise in river water of seventeen or eight feet.

This is truly an unprecedented robbery. The water this time was turbulent and abnormal. It only rose four or five feet deep at first, but at about 3:00 AM on the 6th, it suddenly surged, rushing and surging. The water was terrible. Within three or four hours, it rose more than a foot again, so most of the residents in low-lying areas did not have time to avoid it, and some were tragically drowned in their sleep. The Mingnan Railway has been flooded. The Railway Bureau has sent engineering personnel to inspect it. The second express train opened to Tianjin that day was blocked at Xiaobian Village and did not arrive at Ming Station until after 5:00. (July 7th)</p>

It was also ordered by the former Jiangsu Shatian official property affairs bureau that stone quarrying should not be carried out. Jiang Erchang and his wife Jiang Jinheying were not allowed to rent it out to stone merchants for stone quarrying and grave digging, and they encroached on more than 30 acres of official wasteland. It is not appropriate to do so. The departmental certificate should be revoked immediately and the Agricultural and Mining Department should be notified to cancel the registration and prohibit stone quarrying. You should immediately follow the instructions and report for verification.</p>

<h3>The County Chamber of Commerce's Public Outrage at Korean Anti-Chinese Sentiment</h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the National Government's Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 8th regarding the Korean anti-Chinese incident: Recent newspapers have reported that Koreans have taken anti-Chinese actions due to the Wanbaoshan incident, destroying houses and assaulting people, and the situation is dangerous. After reading the letters from the representatives of the Korean Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, this conflict was actually caused by the improper actions of the Koreans. However, the people of that country did not examine the facts and acted recklessly. The lives and property of our overseas Chinese in Korea are in imminent danger. It seems that it is imperative to urgently wire the Consul General stationed in Korea to lodge a serious protest, investigate the truth, and jointly stop the Korean riots with the Governor-General of Korea to reassure the overseas Chinese. The urgency of the telegram cannot be overstated.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Wu Resigns</h3>
<p>Wu Yunzhen, the county magistrate of Wu County, resigned from the provincial government by telegram, stating that he was unable to handle the job. It is now heard that the provincial government has determined that Wu is determined not to do it, so there is already a person internally designated as his successor. After passing the provincial government meeting today (10th), it will be announced. After the 17th district chiefs' meeting was held in the county government yesterday (9th), a plenary conversation meeting was held, and it was decided to stay or leave together regarding the resignation of Huang. Zou Zhaoxiang (District Chief of the First District of Chengxiang), Cheng Anshi (District Chief of the Third District of Chengxiang), Ding Nanzhou (District Chief of the First District of Township), and Zhu Liang (District Chief of the 19th District of Township) were elected on the spot to meet Huang and persuaded him to stay. Huang expressed that there was no way to deal with the county administration of Wu County. The district chiefs separately selected Gu Xiangling, Cheng Anshi, Wu Erchang, and Zhu Yanliang to contact various legal entities and local gentry to retain Huang. At the same time, they jointly sent a telegram to the Civil Affairs Department, requesting that Huang be retained again.</p>
<h3>Please Suppress the Accumulated Bandits in Xianzi Mountain</h3>
<p>Bandits are hiding in Xianzi Mountain, Yangcheng Lake, Xiao Jing, under the county's jurisdiction, and often go out to harass various villages and Changshu and other neighboring counties. Yesterday (9th), the county government convened the 17th district chiefs' meeting. Wang Baoshen, the ninth district chief of Weiting, specifically proposed it for discussion. As a result, it was decided that the county government should order the bureaus and teams to strictly arrest them and seal up the houses of the bandit leader Xia Caizi to clear the source of the bandits.</p>
<h3>The Third Interrogation Record of Li Leng's Bribery Case</h3>

Li Zonggang, Yang Ying, and Li Pinxian, a person involved, were reported to have reported to the court. Zhao Jieshou and Qian Yaojiang of Chen Qing Bao reported that they had arrived. Li Zhibin, Meng Fushou, Lin Fengxiang, Chen Yifeng, and Hu Ayu, the former section chiefs of the Public Security Bureau's third section, were not available for detention. After interrogating them by Prosecutor Lu, regarding Qian Yaojiang, he was asked who contacted him when Chen Qing Bao published on January 26 that someone had bribed 30 yuan in the local case. Qian claimed that Wu Shanbao refused to contact him. Chen Qing Bao published an article on June 19 about Qian Zuopeng's smoke case, saying that there were 4,000 yuan in bribes. Zhao said that he was not in the museum, but the news had been corrected on the 23rd, considering it inaccurate. Li Zonggang asked where the archives of Qian Zuopeng's family smoke case were. Li said that there were no archives at all because no smoking utensils were found. There was a draft, which was inserted on the nail insert at the time. Yang Ying said that he sentenced Qingchang Hu Ayu to morphine, and the fine of 80 yuan was too light. Yang said that the judgment was based on Article 144 of the Criminal Law and with the intention of the county magistrate. Li Pinxian said that on the morning of July 10, at 8:00 AM, on the way home from his relatives' home, he passed Qian's house in Qingguo Lane and saw Wu Qian and patrolmen so and so, etc. holding the smoking utensils, including the head of the pipe, etc. After the interrogation, Yang Ying and Li Zonggang were handed over to the original guarantee, and the rest were ordered to return.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regional Collection</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Province business tax, since the provincial government ordered its collection by individual counties, has seen business tax bureau chiefs from each county meeting with chambers of commerce and various industries to discuss implementation. However, as this is a new tax, its implementation has been extremely difficult. For months, much effort has been expended. Currently, in various counties south of the Yangtze River, such as Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujin, Jiangyin, Changshu, Liyang, Yixing, etc., arrangements are mostly in place, and the amounts to be paid have also been determined. Recently, the newly appointed Finance Commissioner Xu Baoying, considering that the tax amounts have already been individually agreed upon by various industries, simplifying bureau affairs, decided to implement a regional approach for improved coordination and cost savings. Several counties will be grouped into one region. Those already determined include Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, and Liyang as one region, establishing a regional business tax bureau with its office in Wuxi, and Yang Wobian as the bureau chief. Additionally, Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, and Taicang form another region, with the bureau located in Wuxian, and Wang Shutang as the bureau chief. In the abolished counties, a tax supervisor will be appointed to handle business tax matters in that county, under the control of the regional business tax bureau. This has been formally announced and is to be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>A Shocking City Robbery</h3>
<p>In Daliu Lane, behind the Qin family residence in this county, there is a doctor named Wang Dao'an, over fifty years old, originally from Yancheng, who has been in Wuxi for nineteen years. He married a woman named Zhang, and they have a son and a daughter, named Aiqing and Lanying, respectively. Aiqing is already married. The family of four lived in harmony. Yesterday (the 9th), at five o'clock in the morning, four robbers suddenly arrived, each holding a Browning pistol. Three robbers entered the house while one kept watch outside. After entering, they claimed, "Is Dr. Wang at home? We have come specifically to ask him to see a patient." Thereupon, his daughter Lanying replied that her father was in his room. Upon hearing this, the robbers went straight into the room. At that moment, Wang Dao'an, seeing the situation, knew they were robbers and immediately got out of bed, intending to escape. However, he was seized by the robbers, who forcibly removed the two gold rings he was wearing. They then searched the bed and took a leather suitcase containing a pawn ticket and thirty-eight silver dollars. Not satisfied, the robbers tied up his daughter Lanying with rope, forcing her to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Lanying replied that it was in the room, and the robbers then re-entered the room, overturning boxes and chests, and looting extensively. In total, they stole three hundred and fifty silver dollars in banknotes, thirty silver dollars in cash, two hundred and fifty dimes, and a leather coat, valued at over seven hundred dollars. After obtaining the loot, the robbers carried it out the door and tightly fastened the bolt on the Wang family's gate with lead wire, preventing the residents from going outside to report the incident.</p>

<h3>Merchants and Residents Appeal Against Demolition</h3>
<p>Over one hundred merchant and resident households outside Zhenjiang's West Gate, along the canal, have been ordered by the Provincial Capital Construction Project Office to demolish their houses by the 20th of this month, which poses significant difficulties.

<h3>Head of Provincial Hospital Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Yuanchen, the head of the Provincial Hospital, was sued in the Criminal Court of the Zhenjiang District Court by a man named Yi for professional negligence causing disability. During an operation to treat Yi's external injury, Wang allegedly reattached Yi's leg bone incorrectly, rendering Yi immobile and beyond further medical treatment. After being summoned by the court, Wang Yuanchen appeared for questioning at 10 a.m. yesterday, along with witnesses Zhao Zisheng and Liu Yusheng. The plaintiff, Yi, was unable to attend due to his mobility issues. The witnesses were questioned first, followed by the defendant, Wang Yuanchen. Wang stated that because the hospital's equipment was incomplete, he had Yi taken to the Hongren Hospital for X-ray examination, where it was discovered that the bone had been broken. He then performed surgery to fix it, but because it was too painful, he sent Yi back to Hongren to be checked with gas. It was then discovered that the bone had been reattached incorrectly. Wang added that mistakes had been made before, and that his treatment of Yi, twisting the leg and reattaching the bone, was merely an experiment. The questioning of the witnesses continued. After the questioning, Wang Yuanchen was ordered to be released on bail, and the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Regarding a Passenger's Body Thrown into the River</h3>

This was reported by the Nantong County Government, which ordered the head of the local Public Security Bureau, Director Tang, to investigate thoroughly. However, the reply was ambiguous and suspected of bribery, leading to another report. The local court recused itself according to law. It is heard that the higher authorities have ordered the case to be tried by the Zhenjiang Court. The case files have been transferred for review, and summonses will be issued to the parties involved for investigation according to the law.</p>

<p>After days of heavy rain, the river water has risen sharply. The areas affected by flooding include the Jiuqing Enclosure in Section Three of Sihe Township, with the enclosure bank collapsing for eight or nine zhang to the east and over ten zhang to the north. The Fengnan Majia Enclosure has also become a vast expanse of water due to the rapid flow of water from the outer pond into the sluice gate. The water levels are also high in the Ding Tang and Xiewei Enclosures in Yuecheng, and efforts are underway to pump out the water.</p>

On the 6th, County Magistrate Peng interrogated Zhao Zhifang, Jiang Yizun, Huang He Gao, and others, who all claimed to have no connection to the Hongwan case. Huang Bingzhong also vehemently denied any involvement. After the interrogation, it was decided that Jiang Weisheng would be summoned for questioning next time. Huang Bingzhong and others were released on bail.</p>

<h3>Major Flood in Eastern Township Leads to Incident</h3>
<p>In the eastern townships of Nantong, including Yiyu, Jinsha, Shigang, and Qian'an, which are historically salt production areas and have lower terrain, shaped like the bottom of a pot, a major flood has occurred. The upstream areas clashed with the downstream Sanyu area due to the opening of dams. The Sanyu Self-Defense Corps opened fire, killing several villagers from Dongshe Township, provoking outrage from the upstream areas. On the 8th, they mobilized their self-defense corps to head there. Upon learning of this, the county government immediately sent a telegram to stop them. County Magistrate Zhang and the Construction Bureau technician Zhang Ruhong rushed to mediate.</p>
<h3>Martial Law Declared in Bandit-Infested Area at the Border of Tongzhou and Rugao</h3>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Opium Case by the Third District Office</h3>
<p>Pan Qinghua, the District Chief of the Third District Office in Wangjiangjing, Jiaxing, searched the Wancheng Rice Shop for opium a few days ago, causing a strike among the rice merchants in the town. The county chamber of commerce petitioned the county government to send someone to investigate and stabilize the business community. It is now known that the merchants and residents of the town are outraged by this incident and have jointly submitted a petition to the province from over thirty businesses, accusing Pan of illegal actions. Pan also knows that he cannot remain in his position and has submitted his resignation. The county government sent someone to Wangjiangjing on the 8th to investigate everything and submit a report to the provincial government for review.</p>

<h3>Hengtong Pawnshop Clerk Drowns in Capsized Boat</h3>
<p>The Hengtong Pawnshop in Hongxingqiao is a branch of the Hengyu Pawnshop on Guanhua River in this city. In recent years, due to the presence of many bandits in the western townships, the pawnshop transfers valuable jewelry to pawnshops in Huzhou. Hengtong sends clerks to Huzhou to transport these items, using their own long boat every few days. On the 5th of this month, Hengtong sent clerks Liang Dacai and Chen Shoubao to Huzhou to retrieve goods by boat. The next morning, they took five hundred silver dollars and a package of jewelry. Liang, Chen, and the boatmen returned to Hongxingqiao on the same boat. While passing by the Dade Bridge, about three miles from Hongxingqiao, the boatman was careless and capsized the boat. Chen and the boatmen managed to swim to safety, but Liang Dacai tragically drowned. The pawnshops in Huzhou and Hongxingqiao hired many local boats to search the area where the incident occurred, but his body has not yet been found. It is reported that the deceased was from Hang County, and the pawnshop has notified his family by telegram.</p>
<h3>Textile Industry Unrest Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>The Dingxin Textile Shop on North Street in this city held a sales promotion after its opening, but failed to discard the expired advertising materials. They were questioned by other businesses, leading to a physical altercation in which Dingxin's cabinet was overturned and Zhan Dafu, an employee of the Tongyu Shop, was injured in the nose. Afterwards, the city Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of textile industry peers to discuss the matter. As a result, it was resolved that (1) closing the market would harm both parties, so business should resume as usual; (2) all industries are permanently prohibited from holding promotions that disrupt the market unless approved by the relevant industry association, and the county government should issue a notice prohibiting such promotions; (3) as a form of punishment for Dingxin, Dingxin should provide a certain amount of compensation to the industry association's welfare fund. The perpetrators, Ding and Zhang, and the Dingxin manager, Cheng Xiaoyun, would jointly publish an apology to their peers and request the withdrawal of the lawsuit, with Dingxin providing medical expenses to the injured party. After the resolutions were passed, all textile shops reopened today. However, Dingxin is unwilling to accept these terms and has filed a lawsuit with the court this morning. After Inspector Chen visited the Dingxin shop for inspection, it is heard that a summons will be issued on the 9th. Therefore, this unrest is difficult to fully resolve.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province's 20th Year Education Budget (5) Shi Zhang</h3>
<p>(5) The End and the Beginning of Two Years</p>
<p>Outside the Jiangsu Province Education Expenditure Budget for the 19th year, there is a total of 348,890 yuan designated for "separate allocation." These funds were intended for the temporary expenses of various educational institutions, to be allocated by the Education Department as needed. As previously mentioned (see this newspaper on July 7th), after the 19th-year budget was finalized, the income could not cover the expenses, resulting in a significant shortfall. Consequently, these "separate allocation" temporary expenses had to be put on hold. However, due to the urgent and practical needs of various schools for construction, repairs, purchases, and equipment, they continued to plead their case despite the strained educational funding. The Education Funding Committee also expressed considerable sympathy. It was not until the 23rd meeting held on February 27th of this year that it was resolved that "the total amount of provincial education temporary expenses is 180,000 yuan, to be allocated by the Education Department," finally bringing the matter to a conclusion. Unexpectedly, after this decision was made, the Education Funding Management Office faced increasing financial difficulties in practice, and its ability to cope was exhausted. The repeated serious expressions of concern from the faculty and staff were all due to this. Naturally, at this time, the existing payable expenses could not be disbursed, let alone additional temporary expenses. Now that the 19th year has essentially passed, the schools are in the process of closing, and many have already advanced funds for construction and other expenses, which they urgently need to be reimbursed. Recognizing this, the Education Department, at the third meeting of the 20th year (July 3rd), based on the determined total amount, carefully examined the urgent needs of various institutions and made a comprehensive allocation, approving the amount and purpose of the temporary expenses for various educational institutions for the 19th year, and immediately issued orders to comply. This marks the end of the 19th-year budget and also serves as a precursor to the implementation of the 20th-year budget. The allocation of funds is listed below.</p>

<h3>Middle and Elementary School Curriculum Standards Editing Committee</h3>
<p>Postponement of Meeting</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Middle and Elementary School Curriculum Standards Editing and Equipment Committee originally scheduled its second meeting for the 13th, 14th, and 15th of this month at the Ministry of Education. However, as the general opinions on the review of the curriculum standards for each subject have not been submitted on time, it is feared that they will not be completed before the originally scheduled meeting dates. Therefore, the meeting has been postponed to July 20th and 21st for the elementary school group meeting, and July 21st and 22nd for the middle school group meeting. The committee has already sent notices to all members explaining the reasons for the postponement, requesting their timely attendance.</p>

<h3>Important Remarks from Shen Siliang: Chinese Football Team to Organize Next Spring</h3>
<p>| Decision to Participate in World Games in the US |</p>
<p>Opposes Philippine New Scoring Method</p>
<p>National Tennis Tournament This Autumn</p>
<p>During this spring's National Regional Football Tournament, representatives from various regions passed an important resolution: to send a Chinese football team to participate in the World Games held in the United States next August, and to select team members and organize the team between June and July this summer, before heading to Southeast Asia for matches and practice. However, this important resolution has remained silent. We, therefore, visited Shen Siliang, honorary director of the National Progressive Association, and recorded his remarks as follows:</p>
<h3>Postponement to Next Spring for Team Organization</h3>
<p>The Chinese football team will definitely cross the ocean to participate in the World Games in the US next fall. The original plan was to select players this summer. However, the Hong Kong side has already decided to send the Chung Hwa and Nanyang teams to Southeast Asia in advance. Therefore, the organization of the Chung Hwa team</p>
<h3>Has to Be Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>Southeast Asia, Java, and other places do not welcome too many teams to compete. However, the decision to go to the US remains unchanged. When the weather warms up slightly next spring, around March or April,</p>
<h3>A Decision Will Be Made to Organize the Chinese Team</h3>
<p>They will first go to Southeast Asia for matches and then return to the US, using this as practice and also raising funds for the trip, as the amount is considerable. If each team member requires US$1,000, it will cost over US$15,000 or US$16,000. Therefore, it is greatly hoped that</p>
<h3>The Government Can Provide Relief</h3>
<p>This matter will be seriously considered again at the National Games, and a complete resolution must be reached then.</p>
<h3>Opposition to the Philippine New Scoring Method</h3>
<p>Regarding the Far Eastern Games, the Philippines has proposed a change in the scoring method.</p>
<h3>Contents of the New Scoring Method</h3>
<p>In the future, all competitions will be scored, and the country with the most points, not the country with the most first-place finishes, will win the overall championship. The distribution of points will be based on the number of participants in each event. For example, track and field events, with many participants, will award 15 points to the track champion and the same for all-around. Basketball and tennis teams, with fewer players, will receive fewer points, with only 5 points awarded for first place. The total score of first, second, and third places in all competitions will determine the overall champion (detailed scoring and allocation methods are available).</p>
<h3>The Philippine Reason for the Proposal</h3>
<p>Is entirely for fairness. This way, the country with the most first-place finishes will not necessarily win the championship, giving countries with more second and third-place finishes a chance to win the overall championship. This proposal seems fair on the surface, but there are many practical drawbacks. Therefore, a letter expressing opposition has been sent, and Japan has also been informed of our stance.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Reason for Opposition</h3>
<p>If this method is adopted, the attitude of the Chinese towards various sports will greatly change. For example, tennis and basketball, with fewer points awarded, will have less impact on the overall championship and will be neglected.  People might even think that volleyball is more important than tennis.  If this misconception takes hold, the consequences will be disastrous, so we will further amend it.</p>
<h3>A More Complete Proposal Is Made</h3>
<p>Still adopting the scoring method, but awarding points of 5, 3, and 1 for first, second, and third place respectively. The champion team gets 5 points, the runner-up 3 points, and the third-place team 1 point. The calculation method is convenient, and various competitions will not be valued unequally. However, it is unknown whether it will be adopted.</p>
<h3>National Tennis Tournament This Autumn</h3>
<p>When asked about the ranking of national tennis players, the answer was that they were unaware of this matter. It would be difficult to determine the ranking during the National Games.</p>
<h3>A Separate National Tennis Tournament Is Necessary</h3>
<p>However, there are no preparations for the Chinese National Tennis Tournament, but</p>
<h3>There Is a Planned National and Foreign Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Inviting famous national and foreign tennis players to Shanghai for a large-scale competition, modeled after the example of the Invitation Tennis League in various countries, and also inviting famous players from Japan and other countries to Shanghai for exhibition matches, in order to benefit from observation.</p>
<h3>The Time Is Late August or Early September</h3>
<p>Around the time of the Rotary Cup International Tennis Tournament, or slightly later until September. Before the National Games, athletes from various regions will finish their competitions and can then go to Beijing to participate in the National Games.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow Jiangnan Will Compete in Beijing</h3>
<p>Luhe Tongmen Team Will Participate… Strong Force</p>
<p>| No Competition in Liaoning… Return South on the 12th</p>
<p>Beijing, 9th. Wang Fudan, leader of the Jiangnan Track and Field Team, stated that negotiations with the Education Bureau have yielded no results.

<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Plan to Advertise on Bald Heads</p>
<p>Europeans and Americans pay great attention to product advertising, often sparing no expense in pursuing it. Their advertising methods are also imaginative and innovative. Not long ago, a British advertising expert came up with a method of contacting telephone users one by one by telephone, reporting on various products, which soap is the most economical, which perfume is the most beautiful. However, this method is too troublesome, unnecessarily disturbing telephone users and easily causing annoyance. But recently, someone placed an advertisement in the newspaper, inviting twelve bald-headed gentlemen of high society for advertising purposes. That is truly wonderful. Their plan is to write product advertisements on those smooth bald heads, adding exquisite pictures. The ink used must be completely non-toxic and harmless to the scalp. After the advertisement is placed, they will be asked to go to theaters, concerts, dances, and churches. Just take off their hats, and the advertisement will be revealed. The power to attract attention is, of course, stronger than anything else. But whether anyone will respond is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Dark Skin May Be Able to Turn White</h3>
<p>Japanese botanist Dr. Y. Noguchi recently returned from Brazil. He used electrical nourishment and glandular control methods on the natives in the forest, and there are already signs of success. According to him, when fully completed in the future, it can change races. Maybe it can turn the black skin of Negroes into white. The growth of a baby can also be controlled by human power. The length of the body and the width of the shoulders can be as desired. Whether these words can be done, let us wait and see.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Electric Capital</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>Hollywood in the United States is known as the Electric Film Capital. A friend who traveled there shared his observations with me. I will describe one or two items for this publication.</p>
<p>The beauty of a woman, in addition to the beauty of the face, especially values the slenderness of the body. Only then can it be called beautiful in posture. To have a slender body, it is necessary to prevent the swelling of muscles. The invention of the fat regulation method is to seek to reduce the weight of the body for modern women. The beauty of the posture of movie stars is a necessary cultivation for their profession. Therefore, Hollywood actresses pay more attention to the method of removing swelling than ordinary people. Recently, it was learned that seaweed can reduce fat when eaten. Therefore, this vegetable has become an indispensable item for meals for general actresses. When they meet, they ask each other whether they have eaten seaweed today and use it as a gift. With the promotion of the electric stars, other women also eat it. Therefore, the sales of seaweed have greatly increased, and the price has also increased. It is said that most of this item is transported from Japan.</p>
<p>Hollywood has many companies that specialize in collecting strange people and things from around the world for use by various film companies and earn rent. Among them, strangely fat women, bearded women, and various freaks are completely collected. There is nothing strange that they do not have. All the rare birds and animals in the world are also available. In addition, there are other mythical things that are enough to make people see and be surprised. These strange things are the needs of the film from time to time. If the film company collects them one by one, it is really difficult to get what it wants. Speculators then started to store them to wait for them. Rent it to the application, demand supply, each get what they want, and also the way of both benefits.</p>
<p>A year ago, there were fewer than ten natural color cameras in the world. Today, Hollywood has thirty or forty. The development and progress of Electric Capital Films can be seen. As for the color films that use this machine to shoot, the output in the past two years is no less than hundreds.</p>
<p>There are no fewer than two thousand children among the actors in Hollywood. The age of these children ranges from just a few months to eighteen years. As the age is uneven, the physical strength is naturally strong and weak. The working hours must also be different. Generally, babies only work one hour a day and must be separated several times. Can not be continuous for it. Children of several ages work for four hours. There are four hours of rest and game offerings. Over fifteen or sixteen years old, the work is named eight hours. However, the rest and games in the middle also account for several hours.</p>
<h3>Young Girl Who Recovered All Looted Goods</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>In recent years, Jiangbei counties have been plagued by bandits, and suppression has not been successful. Although the central government has specially set up appeasement officials, it is still unknown when the whole work can be completed. Wangjia Village near a town in Yancheng has a farmer named Wang, who is diligent and frugal throughout his life and has little savings. He has only one daughter under his knees, who is nine years old and is exceptionally smart. In addition, his wife's younger brother, Jia, is homeless due to the loss of both parents and lives in Wang's house all year round. There is also a farmhand, for a total of five people. The population is very simple. One night, someone in the same village married a wife. Wang and his wife went to the banquet together. At first, they planned to take their daughter with them, but the daughter suddenly said that she had a headache and had gone to bed early, so they left her at home. Unexpectedly, that night, six bandits suddenly came with open flames and sticks, destroying the door and entering. The wife's younger brother and the farmhand were all pale with fear and dared not speak. The bandits tied their hands and feet, and went straight into the girl's bedroom. They looked around and saw no one. There was only a young girl lying on the bed, so they called her up. The girl saw the situation and knew that they were bandits. Knowing that fear was useless, she calmly got out of bed. The bandit said, "Hey. Where are your parents?" The girl replied, "They went to a wedding feast." What do you want to do?" The bandit said, "We are here to collect debts. Where is the money hidden? You should know. Tell me the truth." The girl said, "All the money is hidden in this box. You can take it yourself." As she spoke, she pointed to a box and gave the key to the bandit. She lit a candle. The bandit got the key. He quickly moved the box pointed to the ground. He leaned over and opened it. The bandits leaned over to watch in turn. Sure enough, there were many oceans. Overjoyed. The girl held the candle and stood behind the bandits to illuminate them. The bandits still thought the girl was cute, but they didn't know that the girl had secretly dripped candle oil on the backs of the bandits, making secret marks. The bandit got the ocean and left. The girl secretly followed behind, observing the direction of their departure. Knowing that they were going to the town. She waited for her parents to return. When Wang and his wife returned home after hearing the news, the bandits had already gone far. The girl told them everything. Wang rushed to report to the police in the town, saying that the person with candle oil on his back was the bandit. He requested arrest. At that time, the sky was already bright. The bandits were hungry after not being comforted all night and went to a teahouse to wash and eat. Before long, a inspector came. He glanced at six people sitting together in the teahouse. Seeing their faces, they were not good people. He had suspicions, so he went inside to look at their backs. Sure enough, they all had candle oil on them. So he arrested them all. No one escaped. Searching their sides, the stolen money was all there, not a penny less.</p>
<h3>Pillow</h3>
<p>— Jian Fu</p>
<p>Explanation of the name The pillow is used to support the head when lying down. Because we always put our heads on the pillow when we sleep. Therefore, the pillow is closely related to our health. As the saying goes, "High pillow without worry." In fact, people who like high pillows mostly have curved waists and backs. Without heavy high pillows, their breathing is not smooth. Try to watch Westerners use low pillows or no pillows. Westerners value health, so their trunks are mostly straight. If you use a high pillow, it will hinder their breathing. It is also the effect of habit. As for our ordinary use of pillows, gas pillows are more suitable. Because the gas pillow can be transferred according to the amount of human head deviation. It can avoid the suffering of stiff neck. (When we go to bed at night, we feel pain in our necks during the day.) Farmers' pillows are mostly filled with grain husks or straw. Because farmers work hard all year round, and they rarely use their brains, there is no big problem. In fact, the attributes of grain husks and straw often produce mold in the heat of summer. Almost every summer, we sweat like Shen. The raw materials filled in the pillow absorb sweat. If you don't wash it frequently, the toxins of mold must be infected in the brain. It is most likely to cause brain disease. In addition, the floc pillow, which is most popular in the market recently, mostly uses the catkins of reeds. In fact, reeds and reed flowers are very warm. It is suitable for winter. Not applicable to summer. In addition to gas pillows, cool pillows are the most suitable for summer. In recent years, some people have invented water pillows. The method is to store ice juice or cold water in a ball bladder and put it inside the cool pillow. The next morning. Often feel that the brain is clear and easy to change. It is also a method of summer health. There is also an alarm pillow. It started with King Wusu Qian Yu. Yu was in the army. He never slept peacefully. Use a small round wooden pillow. When you fall asleep, you will stumble. Therefore, I got awakened. So named. Later, Zhuge Wuhou invented the cock-crowing pillow. Made of wood. Although the method of its construction has not been detailed. However, it does not show the intention of alerting and waking up. There is also a so-called fairy pillow. Kaiyuan Legacy. Guizi country entered a pillow. Warm and moist like jade. pillow it. Then, the ten continents, three islands, four seas and five lakes are all in dreams. Ming Emperor named it Youxian Pillow. Biography of the Immortals. Taishan elders. Shi Han Wudi toured east. Seeing his father plowing in the road. The white light on the head. Several feet high. Call and ask him. It is said that there are Taoists who teach ministers to make god pillows. The pillow has thirty-two holes. Corresponding to twenty-four gas. Eight holes should be eight winds. The minister is turning less and his teeth are more alive. The matter is not true. Gu Zhizhi. To be a help in talking.</p>
<h3>A Stroll Through Korea (1)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Recently, the Wanbaoshan incident has turned into a bloody tragedy in which all Koreans are moved to kill our overseas Chinese. Obviously, it is a very serious issue in Sino-Japanese diplomacy. It was originally a very simple fact. But the result turned into a terrible disaster. The content is getting more and more complicated. The problem is getting bigger and bigger. Just think, the Korean people dare to be so arrogant in our country. Following this, various places responded. Organized riots broke out. This is clearly a two-man show with a background. The Governor-General's Office, which holds the ruling power in Korea. I was negligent in noticing it beforehand. Afterwards, he was unable to suppress it. Hundreds of our overseas Chinese were killed and injured. Even if he admits the responsibility of neglect. The so-called protecting the safety of the lives and property of foreigners. Comply with bilateral treaties. Maintaining international integrity. I don't know what to explain.</p>
<p>My overseas Chinese. Footprints all over the world. When it comes to the suffering of being oppressed. And the difficulty of making a living. No more than overseas Chinese in Korea. The situation of their plight and hardship. If you don't experience it yourself. See it with your own eyes. Of course, it is very estranged. A month ago. I just arrived in Korea from Japan. Pay attention to the life of overseas Chinese on the ground. And the scene of the fall of Korea. Touching. Ji wins. Write it down indiscriminately. For reference by those who study the Sino-Korean issue.</p>
<p>Korean overseas Chinese. Most of them are engaged in agriculture, industry and commerce. The most in Shin Yizhou. Seoul, Incheon and Pyongyang are next. Scattered in Zhennampo, Wonsan, Chongjin, Daegu, Busan, Gunsan, Mokpo. In urban and rural areas, etc. The total number should be over 100,000. Although they can be thrifty and self-sufficient. But in recent years, the Korean authorities. Very strict restrictions. There is a tendency to expel and expel. Therefore, life is not easy. It is difficult to stand. Overseas Chinese businessmen have always sold silk and linen as major commodities. Due to the increase in tariffs. The cost is too high. And cut off imports. Japanese goods replace it. Other small capital trades. Very bland too. The power of the commercial field. Completely taken away by the Japanese. Do tenant farmers. Laborers. Suffering from the bullying of the Japanese. The jealousy and exclusion of the Korean people. Homeless overseas. Difficult to advance or retreat. Not only because of the weak national strength and the government's loss of protection. And the Japanese conspiracy. I wanted to expel the overseas Chinese early. Move the Korean people to Manchuria and Mongolia. Give the Korean peninsula in a clean color to his Japanese to operate. He is not easy to do openly. First sensationalize the foolish Korean rioters. Be his vanguard. In the winter of the Republic of China, the sixteenth year. Has already used poison once. The expanded riot in all of Korea this time. It's the second attempt. Who dares to deny that it is not their predetermined plan.</p>
<p>Rotary Club of Storytelling</p>
<h3>??? (17)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Ziliang thought about this, and he had no intention of working, so he hurried downstairs to take a look. Sure enough, the nanny had also followed this main mother. The door was open. Should I call them in? At this moment, there is no burnt rice, so of course they will not be willing to come in; should I let them go to see? I can only keep the door for them here; I want to go upstairs to work, I can only close the door. Ziliang thought for a while, and felt that it was safer to close the door, so he closed the door, put a bolt on it, and went back to the pavilion room himself.</p>
<p>He felt a little more settled in his heart, and then he started to work again. Suddenly someone knocked on the door. Have they come back? The sound of knocking on the door was very urgent, so Ziliang had to go downstairs and open the door. It turned out to be a postman.</p>
<p>"Express letter! Stamp it!"</p>
<p>Ziliang took the letter and looked at it. It was addressed to Ms. Pan Taoyue, and it was sent from Nanjing. He went back upstairs to get the stamp, stamped it, and when the postman left, he bolted the door again. He left the letter on the temple table in the living room and went upstairs himself.</p>
<p>He had only written two or three words, when someone knocked on the door again. Ziliang went downstairs listlessly and opened the door. It really was the two of them who had come back. Ziliang turned around and ran upstairs, but the wife followed behind:</p>
<p>"In broad daylight, why are you closing the door? Are you doing secret things inside?"</p>
<p>Ziliang didn't say a word, and when he reached the pavilion room, he sat down.</p>
<p>"What a grand funeral, it was beautiful! There were nine military bands; sixty-five cars: eighty-one wreaths: I don't know how many people sent it, men and women? The person who died was a woman, I heard she was the sister-in-law of a playboy."</p>
<p>As she said this, an envious look appeared on her face, and she stared at her husband:</p>
<p>"The sister-in-law of a playboy, how dignified? If the sister-in-law of a school teacher died, I'm afraid there would only be a few elegiac couplets!"</p>
<p>She said with emotion, seeing that her husband did not speak, she seemed very bored:</p>
<p>"I'm talking to you, why don't you make a sound?"</p>
<p>"If you open the door wide, people will run away, what if a thief breaks in and steals things, what can we do?"</p>
<p>"Does our family still have things for people to steal?"</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Rush, a Frightening Surge</h3>
<p>The price rose ten taels and one mace. Yesterday, the benchmark gold price rose rapidly, with drastic changes and fluctuations of about ten taels. In the end, it still rose by ten taels. People's hearts were uneasy, and the market was turbulent. It was difficult to predict. As expected, the silver market reported lower prices, opening high, exceeding 730 taels. However, due to the different actions of each firm, the situation was unpredictable. The market fluctuated outside of 30 taels, but the trend of drafts was firm, and the listed price narrowed by another level. By noon, various drafts were even higher. In particular, with small reports on Indian drafts, buying interest in the market suddenly surged, and the momentum was unparalleled, breaking through the 740-tael mark. The later market turned to flatness due to the firmness of drafts. There were more sellers than buyers on the surface, the atmosphere was unfavorable, and it fell into a slump again. In the end, it only moved between 32 taels. The (unofficial) sentiment among dealers turned downward. However, it is said that the silver market may see lower prices again this morning.</p>
<p>Breaking through the 40-tael Mark. The opening price for early August rose by nine taels and four mace, calculated at 736 taels and five mace. Large bars fell by one-quarter, silver prices fell by three-quarters, and private telegraphs also fell by five-eighths. Dadecheng goods, etc., were all buying. Then, it was 37 and a half taels. However, as Yuan Maoyong, Zhifengyong, Wanxing, Hengxing, Shunli and others divested, it immediately fell by more than five taels. Only one or two taels revolved. As foreign exchange first strengthened and then weakened, it was 32 taels at 9:20. Then it went back up two taels. After the First Order announcement was reduced, it was 34 taels. Before long, it retreated to 2 taels, 8 or 9 mace, due to Chengfengyong, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing buying in. At 10 o'clock, it was 37 taels. HSBC and others still had a good appetite, buying US dollars for August at 31.4375, and also absorbing British gold at 13.5. Later, because Yuanchun, Runchangyu, Tongfengyu, Dadecheng, Hengxing and others all sold, a small weakness seemed to be revealed, but there was no special change, only a small drop of two or three taels. Until 11 o'clock, it was 33 and a half taels, then turned upwards, probably because British gold was also firm. Banks were mutually trading October 4375, settling at 375. Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yiyu, Yongfeng, Yuancheng, Dadecheng, etc., all bought in, and the market price soared, with a sharp rise of more than eight taels. At 11:30, banks absorbed British gold 375. It was also heard that the Indian draft telegram reported a small amount of eight annas, and it suddenly broke through the 40-tael mark. At 11:45, it was 42 taels. Then Yuanheng, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Wanxing, Tongfengyu, Shunli and others sold off, plummeting four taels. The noon closing was 38 taels and two mace, and then traded to 8 taels, 4 or 5 mace. The listed price was changed to 771 taels, calculated to have been pressed down 37 or 8 taels to 30 taels.</p>
<p>Closing Suddenly Entered a Slump. The market opened in the afternoon at 38 taels and eight mace. Indian drafts reported a small two annas, and then increased from 37 and a half taels to 9 taels, 3 or 4 mace. Suddenly, Dadecheng, Richang, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong and others came on the market to sell, and immediately plummeted six or seven taels. At 2:20, it was 32 taels. British gold 4375 was difficult to sell. In a short while, it moved upward again, but people's hearts were uncertain, with slight advances and retreats of one or two taels. After 3 o'clock, British gold 4375 could be bought and sold. Then, Yongfeng suddenly bought, and it increased to 38 and a half taels. After a quarter of an hour, Yifengyong divested, retreating to 35 taels. After 4 o'clock, Hengxing bought in, pulling up more than two taels, to 37 taels and seven mace. By the time of the 4:30 closing, it was 37 taels and two mace, an increase of ten taels and one mace compared to the previous day. Suddenly, because Zhengjin sold British gold 4375, people's hearts were defeated, so it fell to 32 taels after closing, falling into a slump. According to the largest and smallest differences between the before and after markets, there was a difference of ten taels. Goods were 36 taels in the morning market, 8 taels and 8 mace at noon, 8 taels and 5 mace in the afternoon, and 3 taels at the closing. The listed price was calculated to have been suppressed by a small 32 or 3 taels to 39 taels, and finally 34 or 5 taels.</p>
<p>Spot Red Silver Again Shows a Decline. The benchmark gold price only increased by eleven taels and two mace five candareens. Merchant guilds slightly purchased through Yingfenghing. By the afternoon, the market was moderate and could still stand. Also, various firms traded. Zhifengyong, Chengfengyong, Tongtaichang, Runchangyu, and Yongfeng all bought in. Qianchangxiang, Daxingyong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Yuancheng, Yu Da, etc., alternately bought and sold. Dadecheng's buying and selling was very active. Yuanmaoyong and Yuandayong sold more and bought less, approximately rolling out more than 2,000 bars in total. Hengxing sold 2,000 several hundred bars, which were issued on behalf of Dadecheng and others for clearing accounts of 1,000 several hundred bars. Yuanxingyong, Fuchang, and Yuanheng all sold. Shunli and Wanxing had more supply than demand. In the afternoon, Tongtaichang, Yongfeng, Hengxing, and Cuichangyong all bought in. Hengyu bought in first and then sold. Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Yuanheng, Richang, and Yifengyong all sold. Zhifengyong and Yuantai bought and sold a lot.

As for the domestic market, the trends of British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were tight. They were strong from the morning onwards, and then slightly flat. They were even stronger at noon. In the afternoon, they turned from tight to weak. It was because the benchmark gold price once exceeded 740 taels in the pre-market. The market result turned soft in the evening. However, the storm was not over, and rumors were just beginning to rise. However, each exchange rate ultimately, compared to the pre-noon, still saw British gold narrow by 25, American exchange rate narrow by 4375, and Japanese gold add between three cents. Trade among Chinese merchants was still smooth. British gold had more buying than selling in the pre-market, and slightly more selling in the later market. Overall, the entire market had a slight short squeeze, which was hedging. Approximately 300,000 pounds were transacted. Also, US dollars were sold off, and banks also transacted with each other, which was not deserted. It seemed more active than in previous days. As for Japanese gold, it was very quiet.</p>
<p>In the British exchange rate domestic market, there was an increase or decrease of 1875.

<h3>Interest Rate and Discount Market Remained in Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Market observation of the financial market, studying the past and verifying the present, every year, except for seasonal changes that lead to complex or simple transitions, there are rarely any special activities. Examining the current commercial depression, the demand for silver is always weak, and foreign products are also very slow to sell. In the end, the market situation is quiet. For our records, it is like an old monk chanting, with little interest. Judging from the future trends, there is probably not much change to be said.</p>
<p>Interest Rate and Discount Slight Changes (Foreign Interest) The foreign interest rate had slightly more transactions in the morning market, and the price also rose. The closing price was seven cents, two cents and five candareens and a half. The day before yesterday, the market sentiment was sluggish, and transactions were sparse.

Transactions were 80,000 jiao in the morning market, and 20,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were short 1,000 wen, at 378,500 wen.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Fell Slightly, Trend Peaceful</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the securities market, spot transactions of public bonds were sparse, with only 12,000 yuan transacted. Also, stocks of the Chinese Merchants Securities Company suddenly traded 10 shares. The futures market was also very quiet. Morning transactions were more than 6,100,000, and the after market was only 3,100,000, totaling only 9,300,000. The bond market was very calm. Major buyers and sellers were waiting and watching.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Suddenly Became Tighter in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Driven Up by Gold Prices</p>
<p>The yarn market was calm, with a slightly firm trend. Although the overseas situation was not good, gold prices were soaring again. The two offset each other, and were not affected in any way. Therefore, people's hearts were still stable. Current yarn business was more active. Yunnan coarse yarn transactions gradually moved, and Japanese export cotton yarn still existed. Some expected that the actual need in the future would be very promising, so they held on to distant months tightly. Common nervous people in the commercial market recently thought that the Korean's violent anti-Chinese riots might cause a boycott of inferior goods, so the market suddenly became tighter in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Fell and Rose Again. The Exchange Human Standard opened in the pre-market. Because the US cotton report was beneficial to short positions, the situation was flat, and each fell two or three cents. The market suddenly tightened in the afternoon, the atmosphere was thick, and the near term rose three, four, or five cents, and the far term rose nine cents to one tael and one cent. The transaction was 18,800 bales. It was found that Ruidahua sold 1,700 bales, Yudahua 650 bales, Gengfeng 600 bales, Dafeng 650 bales, and Shenchang bought 1,150 bales, Gongtai 650 bales, Xiesheng 800 bales, Tianlong 650 bales, and Mingde 700 bales.

<h3>Reasons for the Divergence Between Chinese and Foreign Cotton Markets</h3>
<p>Gold Prices Soared, Japanese Merchants Increased Stakes in Distant Months</p>
<p>It is Said that Hantong's Sea Cotton Fields Were Flooded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Washington telegram reported that the US cotton field estimate was 41,491,000 acres, and the market price was beneficial to short positions, falling more than 40 pounds. The local market was still flat because the silver price shrank again and the gold price increased. The market price was not affected. Moreover, most of the distant month quota was in the hands of Japanese merchants, and the power of retail investors was weak. In the afternoon, it was said that a large flood had occurred in Hantong Sea, and cotton fields had been damaged. At the same time, the yarn market was more active, and Japanese merchants slightly bought in, so the market situation turned to an upward trend.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Rose Back Two Cents. The Exchange Han Standard opened in the pre-market, falling by one cent and five points, following the foreign cotton. In the afternoon, it was said that Japanese merchants were buying in again, and the gold market was high. The near term rose two cents, and the far term rose three cents. The transaction was 39,500 dan. Yuchang bought 2,000 dan, Rongxing 1,400 dan, Gongtai 1,100 dan, and Yichang 1,400 dan. Shenchang sold 2,600 dan, Dafeng 1,300 dan, and Taixing 600 dan.

<h3>Foreign Cotton Fell into a Slump</h3>
<p>US Government Report Was Beneficial to Short Positions</p>
<p>US cotton fell another 40 pounds yesterday. US cotton was weak due to the field report being beneficial to sellers, Wall Street being weak, and the harvest being smooth. The futures fell 37 to 44 pounds, and the spot fell 40 pounds. British cotton futures fell 20 to 21 points, and the spot fell 22 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell 25 points.

<p>1927-28 41,905</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Increased Again</h3>
<p>Not much new rice arrived at the New Gate yesterday. The total inventory of ship cargo was about 24,000 dan. Transactions between urban and rural areas were not very active. Su Chang thick japonica rice increased by one inch. At the moment, ordinary medium-grade goods are consistently tight. The source of thin rice has become increasingly scarce. Although the purchase appetite in this street is stable, the price has risen again by half an inch. Indica rice has excellent retail sales, and the price has not increased or decreased. Most of the foreign long-grain rice is used as a substitute for Saigon rice, so the local indica rice is scarce and stable. Glutinous rice rose slightly by a few cents, but buying interest was not strong. Each river factory's goods opened at more than 4,000 shi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, few boats came to the South Shanghai district, and the market was not smooth. The arrival of top-quality thin rice was lacking, and the bulk price immediately increased by two or three jiao. Ordinary goods also increased by a jiao or so. News from Qingpu said that the price of brown rice was becoming tighter, but people's hearts were looking up. Changxi's northern japonica rice and Su Tong's white japonica rice each increased by one inch. Ningbang purchased Nangang early rice, so the small amount of inventory was swept away, and the price was also looking up by nearly one inch. The future situation must be determined by the amount of arrivals. Lu Yang long-grain rice had light arrivals and sales, and the price did not increase or decrease. There were very few metamict colors, and there was no formal market to report.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Market Benefit from Torrential Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, the opening of the market in the morning saw a generally calm situation across all months. With the price of foreign wheat continuing to fluctuate slightly, both insiders and outsiders were taking a wait-and-see approach, and trading was not very active. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment suddenly became agitated due to the hot and stuffy weather and unusual darkness, with predictions of more heavy rain. At this point, sentiment had already been shaken. After the market opened, the rain gradually intensified, no less than the heavy rain of a few days ago. The mainland traders believed that various places had already been flooded, and with this heavy rain, the situation would inevitably be more difficult to manage. Therefore, buying interest was unusually strong, gradually increasing and showing a strong momentum. Observing the subsequent steps, due to the excessive rain, it is feared that it will still agitate sentiment. Currently, Flour "Soldier Ship" is increased by 3 cents according to the standard, and Fufeng "Red and Blue Car" is increased by 1 cent. As a result, the current month rose by half a cent compared to the previous day, August rose by 2 cents, September rose by 1.75 cents, and October to December each rose by 2 cents, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat market, after the opening of the market in the morning, the situation across all months generally tended to be stable. Because the price of foreign wheat was fluctuating slightly, and the weather was still good, the opening prices of each session were not much different from the previous day. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, the sky was dark, indicating impending rain, so sentiment rebounded again, with speculators trying their best to cover their positions, and bulls aggressively buying non-stop, leading to simultaneous gains in both near and distant terms. Later, as the rain became heavier, sentiment improved even more, especially for distant terms. Observing this kind of rising trend, it is entirely driven by the rain. Because foreign wheat has been falling for several days, the overseas wheat market is ultimately tending towards surplus. If the environment is ignored and prices are still aggressively raised, there will eventually be setbacks. As a result, the current month rose by 2 cents compared to the previous day, August rose by 3 cents, September rose by 4 cents, October rose by 5 cents, November rose by 6 cents, and December rose by 4 cents. The current wheat market has become stable, as factories have chosen to purchase at higher prices, no longer as silent as before. More than 4,000 packages of wheat from Danyang, Benniu, Zhenjiang, Penglai, Shuangfeng, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Liuhe, Nanjing, Hezhou, Taizhou, Anting, Gaoyou, etc., were purchased by Fuxin, Shenda, Huafeng, etc., it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Japanese Firms Actively Purchase New Silk</h3>
<p>Strong Interest in Double Cocoon Silk</p>
<p>Boiled Cocoons Also See Demand</p>
<p>The spring cocoon market in various provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has long ended, and summer cocoons have already entered the market. New silk from silkworms is now being shipped to Shanghai one after another. Silk merchants are submitting samples to various foreign firms for testing to negotiate new transactions. Recently, Japanese firms such as Mitsui, Harada, and Eika have shown considerable interest in new silk. There is strong interest in double cocoon silk, and boiled cocoons also have demand. It is heard that there are already five to six hundred dan of double cocoon silk, and the transaction price is higher than old cocoons. Superior quality goods require 58-59 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Sales Become Increasingly Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firms' silk market was stagnant, as overseas markets showed no sign of recovery in silk sales, and silk prices continued to be weak. Telegrams from Shanghai were still rarely forwarded to Shanghai. Yesterday, only Lianna imported ten packages of white filature silk into Shanghai, and Taihe and others imported thirty-five packages of new dried silk, with prices remaining stable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Green Tea Harvest Reduced</h3>
<p>Tunxi is an important town in southern Anhui and also a tea market center. There are more than forty tea processing firms. Recently, due to weak tea shipments from various routes, supply cannot meet demand, leading to a gradual and firm rise in tea prices, from 60 yuan per dan to over 90 yuan. Currently, tea merchants and vendors have no tea leaves left in hand, and most firms have already closed down due to lack of tea to buy. According to current reliable surveys and estimates, the total amount of Tunxi green tea this year is only slightly over 30,050 dan, a decrease of 50% compared to last year. The scarcity of tea is unprecedented in more than ten years, it is said.</p>
<h3>New Arrival of American Standard Square Nails</h3>
<p>According to news from foreign firms yesterday, the American standard square nails, which have been in short supply for many days, will have over 4,000 barrels imported next Wednesday or Thursday. The purchasers are said to be Shenchang, Anli, Meikang and other foreign firms, while domestic purchasers are lead firms and construction teams in the North Suzhou Road area, it is said.</p>
<h3>White Lead Sheet No. 6 Sales Active</h3>
<p>The sales of white lead sheets fluctuate between brisk and sluggish, so the decoration of various colors in the market is also sometimes good and sometimes bad. In recent days, No. 5 and No. 6 have seen many transactions due to purchases by battery factories, with the market price estimated at 25.5 taels per dan. It is heard that factories and merchants have been making batch purchases for days, and although it rained lightly yesterday, the transactions still reached more than 180 barrels, it is said.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheet No Stock in Near Term</h3>
<p>Regarding the 18-gauge black iron sheet futures purchased by domestic firms in the previous month, according to news from foreign firms, the factory has telegraphed that there is no stock in the near term and it will be delayed for four weeks before there is stock available for shipment to Shanghai. Therefore, local firms, hearing this news, are in good spirits, and the market price has increased by several cents, estimated at 11.5 taels per dan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Show Slight Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the piece goods market rebounded due to the rise in the gold market. Osaka's fixed prices all rose by 2.5 to 5 cents, so the spot market showed a slightly firming trend. "Four Gentlemen" straight tribute woolen cloth was 3 qian, 1 fen, 7.5 li, Moganshan was 3 qian, 6.5 fen, and Lieyan Muqiu was 3 qian, 6 fen, 7.5 li. Spot goods of plain foreign yarn are increasingly scarce, and Dianqiu Han has reached 10 taels and 1.5 qian yesterday. Brands such as Huameiren, Xiaomeiren, and Shuangtonglu seem to be impossible to find. White crepe remains stable, and Guanghua Se Ting has been arriving in Shanghai successively, with prices opening at 2 qian, 6.5 to 7 fen. Yuehua Velvet is slightly firmer, with large patterns at 2 qian, 5 fen, and medium patterns at 2 qian, 4 fen. Sesame Velvet from Sichuan, Xuzhou, and other regions has strong demand. Niao Meiren is 2 qian, 5 fen, 7.5 li, and Heping is 3 qian, 2 fen. Striped Fuchou and blue striped Se Ting are being cleared out daily due to the approaching off-season. Printed linen and printed Se Ting are being sought after by large buyers, with prices around 2 qian. Fine twill is difficult to rally due to the abundance of supply. The ordering of Western striped Fuchou has been unusually active recently, with all-yarn around 4 qian and single-yarn, single-thread around 5 qian, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Raw Sugar and White Sugar Open at Over 3,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Marked Prices Show Slight Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market telex from the production area reported that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for all months fell back by 1 cent. The spot price of Javanese sugar also lacked fluctuations. In the marked price session of the association market, due to the rising exchange rate, sentiment improved, and buying interest increased slightly. The transaction price for Dutch No. 24 raw sugar was 10 taels and 7 qian, with extremely short supply for delivery. No. 20 medium white sugar was 10 taels and 3 qian, with the highest quality at 10 taels and 4 qian. The market shape was extremely beautiful. The Japanese sugar market also rose slightly, with N mark at 10 taels and 7.5 qian, SH mark at 10 taels and 6 qian to 2.5 fen, J mark at 11 taels and 1 qian, YT mark at 10 taels and 7 qian, YP mark at 11 taels and 5 qian, YRO mark at 10 taels and 5.5 qian, TK mark at 10 taels and 7.5 qian, TM mark at 10 taels and 6 qian 2.5 fen, AE mark at 11 taels and 1 qian, and Taikoo B mark at 11 taels and 1 qian. There were few deliveries, and the asking price for the next session was 11 taels and 1.5 qian. Trading was still active, and the market shape was quite brisk. Jianji Hao opened with 2,500 bags of raw sugar, and Deda Hao sold 900 bags, with prices all at 10 taels and 7 qian. The market was selling firmly, and Zhenxiang, Huaxin and other firms were holding back and not selling, it is said.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods Longkou Vermicelli Market Price Inverted</h3>
<p>The transport of Longkou vermicelli has led to low inventory in the area, and purchase prices are rising. According to recent correspondence, each package has reached 32 taels, and the cost to Shanghai is over 24 taels per dan. Therefore, local goods are also holding tight. Yesterday, a few opened at 23 taels and 2 qian, and the market generally requires 24 taels before being willing to open again. However, local sales have not been brisk, with trading at 23.5 taels being rare, so the market price has become inverted. However, judging from the situation, future sales will eventually turn around. The cost of purchases has increased, and inventory is low, so the market will undoubtedly rise in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 5th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's Swearing-in Ceremony for the Northern Expedition. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters specifically convened people from all walks of life in the city to hold a commemorative meeting. Over 800 representatives attended. The details are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Fellow Representatives, Fellow Comrades, today is the fifth anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's oath to launch the Northern Expedition. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, our Party swore to launch the Northern Expedition, which was of great significance in the revolutionary process. Because of the Northern Expedition sworn five years ago, we have today's situation. Although today's situation is still far from our ideal state, if we are united from top to bottom, work together, and continue the spirit of the Northern Expedition, the National Revolution will not be difficult to succeed, and the Three People's Principles will eventually be realized. Since the Opium War, our country has suffered from the heavy oppression of international imperialism externally, and the ravages and destruction of feudal forces internally. The national economy and people's livelihood have become increasingly precarious. Before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, our Party had worked hard to fight against imperialism and feudal forces, but it ultimately failed. There are three reasons for this. Before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Party's organization was particularly loose. There was no close connection between the Party and its members, between Party members and the people, and between Party members. Once an incident occurred, it relied on personal enthusiasm or the righteous indignation of a few people. There was no strict organization, and even less planned action. It is no wonder that it failed. This is one reason. Before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Party's military force had not been cultivated. It often used troops who expressed sympathy for the revolution to fight against counter-revolutionaries. Whether military training was mature or not was a secondary matter. Whether the construction of ideological beliefs and revolutionary confidence was deep or not had a great impact. It was easy to sympathize for a while, but it was not surprising that incidents of defection and betrayal occurred during a long struggle in hardship. Before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, it was not that there was no Northern Expedition, but the reason for repeated failures was the lack of basic revolutionary military force. This is the second reason. The National Revolution is by no means the business of a few people, nor can it be successful with the struggle of a few people. Before the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Party's work focused on assassination, uprisings, and arousing the people to work together. No attention was paid. As a result, the people were mostly ignorant of the truth about our Party and mostly regarded it as a mob. The easy failure of the revolution was a major reason. This is the third reason. After the reorganization of our Party in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, it swept away the accumulated malpractices of the past. In terms of military affairs, it specially established the Whampoa Military Academy to specialize in cultivating revolutionary military force. In less than two years, its strength was greatly prepared. Therefore, the Central Committee of our Party decided to swear to launch the Northern Expedition on July 9th of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the weather was extremely hot, and sweat poured down like rain, but the revolutionary soldiers' enthusiasm for killing the enemy and achieving results was also as exciting as the climate. Hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers, under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, marched north in a mighty and grand manner. In a few months, they conquered the borders of Guangdong and Guangxi, secured the important towns of Hunan and Hubei, captured Jiangxi, and recovered Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The momentum was unprecedented. After recovering Shanghai, the Central Committee of our Party realized that the Red Bandits' conspiracy to usurp the Party and the country was fully exposed, so it resolutely and decisively carried out the purge. Many of the comrades present today were working in the secret era. Recalling the cruelty of the Communist bandits' oppression of the comrades of our Party in those years is heartbreaking. The arrogance of the Communist bandits in Shanghai was infuriating. Fortunately, Mr. Wu, Cai, Li, and Chiang Kai-shek recognized the Party's crisis, made a choice in an instant, and made a grand plan in an instant. They expelled the Communist Party and punished the fierce and stubborn according to the law, so that sovereignty would not fall into the hands of others, and the Party and the country would turn from danger to safety. Those who read the Party history of our Party and the national history of our country should applaud it. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Communist bandits were wiped out, and the rear was stabilized. The Central Committee resumed the second phase of the Northern Expedition. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek again led a large army and marched north again. Unexpectedly, after recovering Jinan, the Japanese imperialists were mad and massacred our National Army. The May 3rd Jinan Massacre occurred. Diplomat Cai Gongshi was killed, Foreign Minister Huang Yingbai was insulted, and tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians were killed. The loss of property was no less than tens of millions. The situation was tragic, and the disaster was unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek endured the humiliation and pain at this critical moment and detoured the Northern Expedition, because he did not want to fall into the cunning scheme of the Chinese and Japanese. The people of the country were filled with righteous indignation and grief, but they remained calm and waited for the opportunity, because they did not want to disrupt the overall situation. Relying on the bravery of the soldiers to kill the enemy, the Northern Warlords finally collapsed and fled east and west. The peaceful and unified situation that the Prime Minister had eagerly hoped for was finally achieved. The reason why the success of this Northern Expedition was so rapid, and the reason why its achievement was so great, was due to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek's skillful command, the revolutionary soldiers' brave fight against the enemy, and the hard work of the Party's propaganda work, and the assistance of the revolutionary people. Therefore, in addition to warmly supporting Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, who has worked hard, and commemorating the revolutionary martyrs who died for the country, it is even more necessary to strengthen the Party's work and awaken the revolutionary consciousness of the people. It has been two years since the success of the Northern Expedition. The suffering of the people should be alleviated, and the international status should be raised. However, to this day, the people's livelihood is still haggard, and the country is still in danger. The reason for this is the revival and rebellion of new and old warlords. In the recent two years, there was Tang Shengzhi and Zhang Fakui before, and Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang after. Now there is the Guangdong Incident. The misfortunes have come one after another, and the Red Bandits jumping around in the southeast are even more a cause for concern for us. Therefore, the awakened and revolutionary people should recognize the difficult situation since the establishment of the National Government, and should work hard on the following three points, grasp the working line of the revolution, so as to complete the great mission of the times. First, recognize the Party's program and platform, strive to support the Central Committee, and complete the great cause of the revolution. The Guangdong side and all reactionaries often slander the Central Committee and accuse Chiang Kai-shek of dictatorship. In fact, whether the Central Committee's recent measures are accurate, and whether Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is a dictator, are facts that are obvious to all. There is no need for partiality. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek devoted himself to the revolution, his contributions and progress to the revolutionary cause have been demonstrated to the world. There is no need for boasting. Seeking perfection and blaming is indeed the way of the virtuous. If there is another meaning, and a crime is added, then how should those of us who love the Party and the country recognize their cunning schemes, expose their conspiracies, and not be influenced by their instigation? To save China today, to relieve the people's suffering today, there is no other way but to support the Central Committee and ensure peaceful unification. Second, strive to eliminate the Red Bandits. The disasters caused by the Red Bandits in China, and the cruelty of killing the people, are unprecedented at home and abroad. The people of Jiangxi have been haggard and moaning under the ravages of the Red Bandits for more than a year. The people in the southeastern provinces who have been killed, looted, and plundered by the Red Bandits still remember it as if it were yesterday. If this is not extinguished, the troubles in Lu will not end. Now Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek is personally leading the troops to suppress the Red Bandits. The elimination of the Red Bandits will naturally not be a problem. However, the Red Bandits often use lower-level people as a vanguard. The people who are young and ignorant actually recognize the thief as their father and are willing to be driven. This is truly lamentable and heartbreaking. It is hoped that the revolutionary people will bear the greatest responsibility, do their best, save our country, save our nation, and even save our foolish people who have gone astray. Third, the Wanbaoshan Incident was instigated by the Japanese imperialists. The people of the country see it as clearly as fire. The Japanese imperialists are still pretending to be stupid and pretending not to know. It is truly not worth laughing at. From this, it can be seen that the only great enemy of our country's National Revolution, and the greatest obstacle to our country's freedom and equality, is the Japanese imperialists. To achieve peace in the East, it is necessary to overthrow Japanese imperialism. Without eradicating the Japanese imperialists, it is not enough to wash away the shame of the East. Economic non-cooperation has been repeatedly mentioned by my brothers at previous commemorative meetings. I hope that the people of this city will not forget it either. The Korean people willingly act as tools and provide weapons for riots. In addition to deeply sympathizing with them, we also hope that they will realize that they are always being pleased by the enemy and grieved by the onlookers. Today, in the midst of boundless excitement, I report the above points, and I hope that the representatives present will pay attention to them. Finished. Then Chen Kecheng and others successively gave speeches. The speeches were long and abbreviated.</p>
<h3>Memorial Meeting of Various Agencies in the County</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's oath to launch the Northern Expedition. The Shanghai County Party Department Consolidation Committee convened representatives of various agencies in the county, as well as all working comrades, to hold a memorial ceremony in the department's auditorium. Lu Zhe presided, Chen Jiannan was the master of ceremonies, Deng Huanian was the recorder. After the ceremony, the chairman gave a report, saying that the purpose of the Northern Expedition was to overthrow internal and external oppression. Although the Northern Expedition has succeeded and the warlords have been eliminated, the oppression of imperialism has not yet been eliminated. In commemorating July 9th, we should uphold the spirit of sacrifice of the soldiers of the Northern Expedition, recognize our people, follow the principles, and strive to complete the unfinished great cause of the revolution, and so on. Then Chen Guoan and other representatives gave speeches successively (the speeches were long and abbreviated). At the end, they shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<h3>Memorial Meeting of the County Government</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's oath to launch the Northern Expedition. The Shanghai County Government held a memorial meeting at 9:00 am. All staff members of various bureaus and offices attended. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu presided. The music was played, and the entire office stood solemnly to read the will and observe a moment of silence. Then the chairman reported on the course and achievements of the Northern Expedition, followed by speeches by Education Director Shi Han and others, commemorating the significance. The ceremony was completed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Memorial Meeting of Two Railway Party Departments</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Department held a grand meeting at 10:00 am yesterday in the auditorium to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the July 9th Northern Expedition. More than 100 people attended, including representatives of various district party departments, union representatives, and all staff members.

First, the chairman reported on the history of the Northern Expedition and the direction of future efforts. After the report, representatives Wei Yunlou, Chen Pin, and Zhang Yunhe successively gave speeches. At the end, they shouted slogans. At 12:00 pm, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Sino-Foreign Jointly Operated Sugar Factory</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Sugar Industry Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association previously heard that the Ministry of Industry was borrowing money from foreign merchants to establish a sugar factory, but the draft agreement that was drawn up contained many provisions that would lose national sovereignty. It telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to inquire about it. The ministry then sent a vague reply, which aroused even more suspicion among the industry. Subsequently, the industry tried every means to investigate the contents of the draft agreement. It learned that the agreement did contain many points that would humiliate the country and harm the people. The members of the industry were extremely indignant and held a general meeting to discuss the matter. As a result, the various points in the draft agreement where the foreign merchants were deceiving, cunningly taking advantage, and rapaciously seizing were listed in detail and presented in a memorial. Zheng Zenan, Yang Wenshao, and Jiang Yachen were appointed to go to Beijing on the 7th to petition the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry, urging them to correct the contract in order to maintain national sovereignty and save losses. The petition of the association is recorded below:</p>
<h3>To the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Presented to Petition for the Correction of the Ministry of Industry's</p>
<p>Contract with Foreign Merchants to Borrow Money to Establish a Sugar Factory, and Suggestions to Completely Nationalize it in order to Save Losses and Maintain National Sovereignty. Your humble association previously heard that the Ministry of Industry was borrowing money from sugar merchants in Cuba to establish a sugar factory. Because the matter was of great importance to national sovereignty and the sugar industry, it telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to inquire about the truth of the matter. It then received a vague reply from the Ministry, and it was even more suspicious. Then, newspapers continued to report on the matter, detailing it in great detail. The Ministry of Industry has signed a draft contract with the Havana International Sugar Company of Cuba to borrow money to establish a sugar factory. It has been decided by the 222nd Central Political Conference and sent to your esteemed Yuan for review. Your humble association believes that the matter is of great importance to our country's industry and is closely related to the future of the sugar industry. It did not dare to remain indifferent and took action. According to rumors, the contents of the draft contract contain many points that would humiliate the country and harm the people. Upon hearing this, it was at a loss. It is respectfully submitted that the China National Sugar Manufacturing Company went bankrupt due to poor management. If the state-run sugar factory is again controlled and monopolized by foreign merchants, and repeats the mistakes of the National Sugar Manufacturing Company, then there is no hope for the revitalization of our country's sugar manufacturing industry, and the principle of promoting sugar cane planting as a basis for expanding sugar manufacturing is even more hopeless. The huge and alarming losses can also not be recovered. How can one fully express its impact on the rise and fall of national sovereignty, and the rise and fall of agriculture, industry, and commerce? The advantages and disadvantages of industry and commerce are numerous and cannot be fully understood except by those who have personally experienced them. Your humble association has been engaged in this industry for a long time and is very familiar with it. It is deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. Therefore, it is using its own insights to supplement the profound, and listing the harmful points of the contract, and respectfully presenting them to your esteemed Yuan one by one. (1) The sugar factory is nominally state-run, but the hiring and administration are completely subject to interference, and the finances are subject to control and supervision. (2) The interest on the loan is 8% per week. Compared with the ordinary interest rate of 2-3% in European and American countries, it is undoubtedly subject to harsh exploitation. (3) The purchase of raw materials and the export of products are handled by it alone, then the great power of buying and selling the sugar factory is abandoned without reservation. It is given the power to manipulate and monopolize, and to satisfy its endless desires. (4) Regarding the price of purchasing raw materials, it is recognized that the market price at that time is the standard. However, the market price is the surface of each country's market. Its actual price depends on the amount of purchasing power, and the special low-price black market. If the market price is used as the standard, then this raw material may not be able to obtain cheap goods, but instead secretly consume unknown amounts. (5) The purchase of raw materials and the sale of products are handled by it. According to the contract, the money used in and out is about 10 taels of silver per picul. If the sugar factory produces 1,000 tons per month, and the annual production is 330,000 tons except for one month for machine maintenance, then the money obtained will be more than 4 million yuan. Calculated over 20 years, it amounts to more than 80 million yuan, and the interest on this loss is not yet calculated. (6) The entire machine for building a sugar factory with a daily output of 1,000 tons is also purchased by its exclusive authority. The cost of this entire machine is about more than 10 million. According to the custom of the business community, the rebate is 10%, then it can also pocket more than 1 million in huge money, and the embezzlement of the machine price can be imagined. (7) The person who signed on behalf of the merchant, Mr. J.H. Laud, is now organizing the China International Sugar Company as the sole agency for selling the products of the factory. It is said that its sales method is mainly based on local distribution. However, this kind of distribution method has many drawbacks and is most unfavorable to the sugar factory. Before the factory's official announcement of price increases and decreases, distributors collude internally and externally, and can inquire and know the price increase first and sell later, and the price decrease first and sell later. Even if it is inspected, it will definitely be bribed and concealed. The complete failure of Jardine Matheson's sugar transportation and the gradual decline of Taikoo's sugar transportation are all due to this. Japanese sugar and Javanese sugar have abandoned this distribution method, so they can travel smoothly without hindrance. If it is allowed to sell it by distribution, then the losses suffered between price increases and decreases will be numerous. (8) The loan is US$5 million. The Ministry issues corresponding Class A bonds to repay the loan. In addition, it also requires the Ministry to issue another 15 million yuan of Class B bonds to guarantee the repayment of the sugar money. This kind of Class B bonds is guaranteed by all the property of the sugar species, that is, the land, machines, warehouses, and all other buildings, and all the refined and raw sugar stored inside and outside the factory are double-guaranteed. The right to sell products is also controlled by them, and its price is tantamount to its triple guarantee. Judging from its intentions, the contract has already been used to accumulate the capital for aggression, and the sugar factory must fail, fearing that the sugar money will not be secured, so it has this requirement. The intention in this is even more obvious. Therefore, it is like holding guns and wearing steel armor, defending against the Ministry of Industry again and again, and the national system and credit are almost lost. Looking at this contract as a whole, people are knives and boards, and we are fish and meat. There are a hundred harms and no benefits, and the most important right to buy and sell is handed over to others to control, which is a violation of the principle of state-owned enterprises. Moreover, on the surface, it is still using foreign capital to develop industries, but in fact, it is turning it into exploitation and giving it an opportunity for aggression. If the sugar factory fails in the future, it has already grabbed enough and left, and the losses will be borne by the people of our country. Humiliating the country and impoverishing the people is too much to say. Furthermore, the population of Cuba is only 3.5 million, which is only equal to the population of a corner of Shanghai, and it is also a poor country. How can it have the financial resources to lend to others? It is nothing more than using this to implement its aggressive economic ambitions. Our country is a vast country with a large population, and it is shameful to rely on it for the sugar industry and to be cunningly seized and exploited. This is something that our 500 million people cannot bear. It is earnestly requested that your esteemed association grant it a review, and strictly correct this contract. At the very least, the rights to equipment and sales should be completely under our country's autonomy, so as to strengthen national sovereignty and save losses, or fundamentally cancel the contract, and completely nationalize the establishment of sugar factories. All the capital of state-owned enterprises should be filled by the Ministry of Finance issuing corresponding public bonds. The principal repayment fund for these public bonds should be added to the national sugar import tax. Our people would rather bear the burden of increased tariffs than see the decline of national sovereignty and allow others to invade and endanger the foundation of the country. Your humble association is deeply concerned and eager to speak, and dares to express its feelings and petitions without considering being presumptuous. I earnestly hope that your esteemed Yuan will make a decisive decision and approve what is requested. The country will be fortunate, and the sugar industry will be fortunate. Respectfully presented.</p>

It then received a reply from the ministry, which was encouraging. I was pleased and celebrated the future of our country's sugar industry. Then, newspapers continued to report on the matter, detailing it in great detail... (omitted in the middle) I earnestly hope that your esteemed ministry will approve what is requested. The country will be fortunate, and the sugar industry will be fortunate. (omitted below) (The text presented to the Executive Yuan is the same as that of the Legislative Yuan, omitted).</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan Commissioner Talks About the Recent Situation of Inner and Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>Our country's northwest frontier is vast and sparsely populated, with abundant resources. However, due to inconvenient transportation and years of domestic war, there is little close contact with each other. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, the relationship between the country and the border has declined day by day, from close to distant, from distant to far, and to this day, it is almost completely isolated. Although the domestic intellectual classes have recently become aware of this, due to the inconvenience of transportation, they still cannot avoid the feeling of being at the ends of the earth. A member of the Central Supervisory Yuan, who recently came to Shanghai from Mongolia, met with a reporter from the New Voice Society at a hotel and talked about the recent situation of Inner and Outer Mongolia in great detail. The following is specially recorded for the reference of those who pay attention to the border areas.</p>
<p>Inner Mongolia</p>
<h3>Political Overview</h3>
<p>Inner Mongolia is divided into six leagues: Yikezhao, Ulanqab, Xilingol, Ju Ud, Josutu, and Jerim. Under the league, there are banners. The number of banners depends on the size of the league. In addition to the leagues, there are also independent banners and special banners, such as Alxa, Xishimete, Ejin, Torghut, Qiqihar, Yikemiankan, Hulunbuir, Solunbagu, etc., which are not under the jurisdiction of the leagues. The league is the highest organ. Each league has a league chief, and under him there is a jasagh, which is the official position of the banner, who governs the banners under his jurisdiction. Although the league chief is one level higher than the jasagh, he does not have political power. The judiciary also has certain legal provisions, which are not like the Dalai Lama of Tibet who exercises power at will. The current law is the Mongolian Law promulgated by the Qing Dynasty's Lifan Yuan, with slight improvements.</p>
<h3>Military Organization</h3>
<p>The military uses "zhangjing" as the military leader, whose authority is like that of the commander-in-chief in the interior. The army is entirely cavalry, without infantry or artillery. The number of troops is also uncertain, depending on the size of the banner. Large banners have two or three thousand troops, while small banners have only one or two hundred. Among them, there are also Han people serving as officers and soldiers. However, in Xilingol League, because the area belongs to nomadic areas and Han people are extremely rare, there are no Han people in the army.</p>
<h3>Agriculture, Commerce, and Transportation</h3>
<p>In terms of commerce, in addition to Han merchants dealing in tea, furs, etc., the Mongolians have no other commerce to speak of. Apart from nomadic life, in recent years, some people have gradually engaged in agriculture, but the number is very small and it is not developed. In terms of transportation, only Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League are more convenient, but compared to the interior, they are still far behind. In addition to horses, camels, ox carts, camel carts, and sedan cars from Zhangbei, there is no other way to travel. In terms of postal and telecommunications, only the postal service has some facilities, but they are mostly imperfect.</p>
<h3>Religious Belief</h3>
<p>According to rumors in the interior, the Mongolians completely believe in Buddhism. In fact, the Mongolians' belief is also quite free. For example, some Mongolians believe in Islam and Christianity. Currently, the influence of Islam is quite strong, especially in Alxa and Qilu banners. Christianity has very little influence. Although those who believe in Buddhism are quite devout to lamas, lamas in Mongolia still cannot control political power.</p>
<h3>Situation of Han People</h3>
<p>There are many Han people living in Inner Mongolia. Yikezhao and Ulanqab leagues have the most. The proportion of Mongolians and Han people in these two leagues is almost two to eight. They are mainly engaged in agriculture and commerce, with more farmers than merchants. The relationship between Mongolians and Han people is quite harmonious.</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia</p>
<h3>Formation of the New Government</h3>
<p>Outer Mongolia seceded from China and became independent in the ninth year of the Republic of China, and was incited by the Third International to establish the so-called Mongolian People's Republic. Its political organization is the People's Representative Assembly, which is held once a year, around August in the autumn, as the highest organ. The Assembly re-elects one standing committee member every year, with about 21 or more members (this is equivalent to an executive committee member, because the Mongolian translation means standing committee). From the 20-odd standing committee members, 5-7 members are re-elected to the standing office committee (this is the standing committee). From the standing office committee, one chairman is re-elected to manage all affairs of the Mongolian Republican government. Under him is a prime minister, who is the executive office committee chairman and issues all orders. Under him, there are nine ministries: interior affairs, foreign affairs, finance, transportation, military affairs, justice, agriculture and commerce, and education. Each ministry has one minister, who is appointed by the standing committee members elected by the People's Representative Assembly. Under the government, there are tribal governments (equivalent to provincial governments), and under the tribal governments, there are banner governments. Their organizations are similar to the government of the Mongolian Republic.</p>
<h3>New Army Organization</h3>
<p>Although the organization of the new army is not known in detail by outsiders, it is generally considered more advanced than before. Even in terms of weaponry, it should have everything it needs. Furthermore, the Outer Mongolian army has fully adopted conscription. All those reaching military age, except the disabled, have no way to avoid it. They stipulate that the period of military service for the people is two years. After the expiration of the term and discharge, they must still respond to the call of the Banner government in their area every year for half a month of training. Those who have held ministerial or other important positions, if they are not in office when conscripted, must also respond to the call, otherwise they will not be tolerated by the government. Therefore, since the implementation of conscription in Outer Mongolia, the entire territory is now militarized.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>In addition to establishing schools in every tribe and Banner, Outer Mongolia is also implementing compulsory education. All boys and girls must attend school at the age of six, otherwise their parents will be fined. The government also has appropriate remedies for the poor and those without the means. As a result, the opening of the intelligence of the people of Outer Mongolia has been quite impressive over the past ten years. In the past, Inner Mongolians ("Oukuli," meaning stupid cows) ridiculed Outer Mongolia, but now they are ridiculed by Outer Mongolia.</p>
<h3>Supervising Officials</h3>
<p>In addition to the Mongolian Republican Government, there is also an Internal Security Bureau, which is like the Supervisory Yuan of our current government. The central agency has extremely broad powers. Its duty is specifically to accept people's impeachments against certain officials. After the Internal Security Bureau accepts a request to impeach an official, it does not notify the official, nor does it ask about the truth or falsehood of the matter. It first arrests the accused official and then determines whether a crime has been committed. If a crime has indeed been committed, then severe punishment will be imposed. Otherwise, they will be reinstated to their original position, and the government will publicly declare that they were falsely accused, so that their reputation will not be damaged.</p>
<h3>Russian Influence</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia does not have any significant influence in Outer Mongolia, contrary to what is reported in the newspapers. The Outer Mongolian authorities also do not allow them to have any influence. Apart from Russians who are automatically employed by the government, there are no Russians holding political power in Outer Mongolia. Furthermore, Russians who commit crimes in Mongolia are treated the same as other foreigners and punished accordingly. I (a certain supervisory committee member claiming) have seen the Mongolian judiciary execute one Japanese person and one Russian person on the day of execution for crimes committed, and the Japanese and Russian authorities did not dare to do anything.</p>
<h3>Left and Right Factions</h3>
<p>Within Outer Mongolia, since three years ago, there has been a division into left and right factions, but the struggle is not very fierce yet. Recently, the left faction has gained considerable power. It is not yet known what changes will occur in the future.</p>
<h3>Expelling Han Chinese</h3>
<p>The expulsion of Han Chinese from Outer Mongolia and the confiscation of their property did indeed happen, but not completely. Most of the Han Chinese who were expelled were idlers and vagrants. The confiscated property was also the property of these people. The remaining Han merchants, such as those dealing in fur and tea, remain in Mongolia and have not been expelled.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Entering the Country</h3>
<p>Currently, Han Chinese and other foreigners can still enter Outer Mongolia, but they must go through certain procedures, such as obtaining a passport, obtaining permission from the Mongolian government, and inspection of luggage. There are customs offices on the Russian-Mongolian border, and checkpoints on the borders of Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Goods brought into the country are subject to taxation. Inner Mongolians who wish to enter the country must also go through the above procedures.</p>
<h3>Currency Situation</h3>
<p>Recently, Outer Mongolia also has new currency in circulation. Internally, it is based on silver, and externally, such as for collecting tariffs, it is based on gold, similar to the current practice in mainland China. The new currency in circulation includes copper coins called "Mongo," equivalent to one copper cent in mainland China, and a denomination called "Alaba Mongo," meaning ten cents. Silver coins are called "Tegoligo" and are equivalent to one silver dollar in mainland China. There are three types of copper coins: one cent, two cents, and ten cents. There is only one type of silver coin, one dollar. There are several types of paper money, including one yuan, two yuan, three yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, one hundred yuan, fifty yuan, and ten thousand yuan. Chinese currency can also be used. Banks are located in Alata (formerly Kulun), Woodburen (formerly Chakhtu), Amaolunbate (formerly Maimachin), and other important towns.</p>
<h3>General Customs</h3>
<p>The customs of Inner and Outer Mongolia are the same. The clothing is still in the style of Manchu robes and jackets, wide and large, with a preference for long sleeves. However, many people now wear Western suits and leather shoes. The diet mainly consists of beef, mutton, tea, fried rice, and noodles. Although some people now eat rice, they are few in number. The cost of living in Kulun is even higher than the already high cost of living in mainland China, but in the countryside, the cost of living is extremely low. The housing consists of Northern-style houses and wooden houses in the towns, while yurts made of felt are the most common in the countryside, as they are nomadic and can be moved at any time of the year.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Mongolia</h3>
<p>If the central government's handling of the Inner and Outer Mongolia issue continues to follow the approach of dealing with Tibet, or sending a few special commissioners to investigate once and then considering the matter finished, I fear that failure will still be inevitable. In my opinion, the issues of Tibet and Mongolia should be approached from the perspective of the people. Within Outer Mongolia, there are already factions, and it is not too difficult to salvage the situation. If the central government does not decide on appropriate measures at this time, I fear that Inner Mongolia will also be difficult to protect in the future. The reason is that Inner and Outer Mongolia speak the same language and are of the same ethnicity. Inner Mongolia is increasingly influenced by Outer Mongolia. In the future, it is possible that Inner Mongolia will merge with Outer Mongolia or become independent on its own. Therefore, how the Mongolian issue will be resolved in the future also depends on how the central government responds.</p>
<h3>Chilean Chargé d'Affaires Requests Date to Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>The Chilean Chargé d'Affaires to China, Carlos, visited Yang Xiaotang, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, at 2:00 PM yesterday (August 8th) to discuss the date of his trip to Beijing. Director Yang immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions. It is heard that although Chile had previously sent a Chargé d'Affaires to China, he never took office. Therefore, Mr. Carlos is actually the first to come to China. He is currently looking for a place to set up his office.</p>
<h3>Current whereabouts of prominent figures</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen left Beijing by night train last night and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang took a train to Hangzhou at 9:10 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Yang Guorui, Brigade Commander of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division of the National Revolutionary Army, came to Shanghai on official business some time ago. He is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing tonight with his adjutant and others, then proceed to Ganzhou to meet Jiang, stay briefly, and then return to his defense area in Henan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Groups Jointly Oppose the Opium Prohibition Bureau</h3>
<p>Disclosure of the Original Petition</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has been contacting national civic groups for days to oppose the establishment of the Opium Prohibition and Investigation Bureau and the collection of opium taxes.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>All levels of the Party, local anti-drug associations, and anti-drug propaganda associations have unanimously expressed their views separately, as repeatedly reported in various newspapers. Previously, Shanghai sent personnel to solicit signatures from local public organizations and the association's various constituent groups to submit a joint petition to the central government for correction, in order to comfort the people's hopes. The petition has been sent to the central government. The original petition and the names of the jointly signing organizations are copied below. Respectfully submitted to the Central Party Headquarters: Previously, Wu Liande advocated opium public sales, and Li Jihong went to Taiwan to investigate the Japanese public sales methods. There were rumors that the government had abandoned the policy of complete prohibition of opium, causing public anxiety. Later, the government declared that there was absolutely no such thing, and public opinion was relieved. Recently, there have been rumors of implied legalization through taxation in the opium prohibition effort. Although the authorities have strongly stated their determination to prohibit opium, the establishment of investigation offices in various provinces and opium prohibition bureaus in various counties has delighted opium merchants and peddlers. Tax officials are taking advantage of the opportunity to engage in activities. There are even cases of contracting opium taxes, setting quotas, and allowing the transportation of opium with taxes levied by the ounce. The special tax offices in the two Hubei provinces, which were opposed by the people and not allowed by law, continue to exist and are recognized. Combining all these facts with the determination to prohibit opium, there is a phenomenon of running counter to each other. Not only will the opium prohibition efforts of many years be abandoned in one fell swoop, but also the international opium prohibition treaties, the Kuomintang's opium prohibition program, Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug legacy, and the resolutions of the First National Opium Prohibition Conference will all be completely violated. Our association and others love the Party and the country and are heartbroken by the opium scourge. We believe that these measures are unacceptable. Feeling the danger, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we dare to gather public opinion and appeal for correction, to take swift and decisive action against the harm of opium and narcotic drugs, to completely prohibit them, and the people of the whole country are willing to be the backing. We respectfully submit our humble petition and hope that it will be adopted. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, the Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Association, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association, the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, the Shanghai Medical Association, the Jiangsu-Shanghai Lawyers Association, the Customs Chinese Staff Club, the Chinese Students' Christian Association in the World, the Henan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai in Shanghai, the Zhejiang General Association, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Wenzhou Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Shangyu Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Huining Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the General Association of Chinese Christian Churches, the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, the Chinese Christian Educational Association, the Chinese Christian Endeavor Association, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai YWCA, the Shanghai Evangelical Association, the Shanghai Rational Education Federation, the Shanghai University of Shanghai Alumni Association, the Verdi Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, the Shanghai Jingwu Athletic Association, the Youth Preaching Group Executive Committee, the Shanghai Women's Relief Association Preparatory Committee, the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union Council, the Shanghai Chinese Four Prohibitions Association, the Shanghai Aspiration Society, the Shanghai Martial Arts Association, the Hongshun Mutual Aid Association, the Shanghai Christian Beneficiary Society, the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation Preparatory Committee, the Chinese Christian YWCA, the National Association, and forty-two other groups kowtow together.</p>
<h3>The Opium Prohibition and Investigation Bureau Still Open for Business Yesterday</h3>
<p>No Instructions Received from the Opium Prohibition Committee</p>
<p>Several Opium Criminals Sitting and Lying Inside</p>
<p>Due to the enthusiastic opposition from various circles, the Executive Yuan has approved the request of the Opium Prohibition Committee to abolish the established investigation offices. Yesterday, our reporter went to the Opium Prohibition and Investigation Bureau on Xieqiao Suzhou Road and Shanghai, specifically to visit the director of the office, Feng Wenyu. Unfortunately, he was out on official business. According to the staff inside the office, the office was still open for business as usual yesterday, and the instructions from the Opium Prohibition Committee had not yet been received. The office is located at the original site of the Salt Affairs Smuggling Suppression Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, which has been painted and renovated, giving it a completely new appearance. The side rooms next to the two doors have been rebuilt into detention centers to detain captured opium criminals. The floor is covered with thick mats, which is quite clean. Yesterday, several opium criminals were lying inside.</p>
<h3>Various Sectors Protest the Korean Anti-Chinese Case</h3>
<p>The messages and cables of protest from various sectors regarding the Korean anti-Chinese case have been selected and published for days. The following is a record of additional messages and cables.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Nine District Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>(Titles omitted) The Japanese imperialists, worried about the excessive population, food panic, and lack of raw materials on their small island, have no choice but to resort to their deceitful tricks to invade neighboring countries in order to save this crisis. Taiwan and Penghu are not enough to satisfy their greedy desires, so Korea cannot but be followed by annihilation. The various provinces of the East have also become areas coveted by them. The Three Principles of the People of our revolutionary mentor Sun Yat-sen seek not only the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation, but also the further assistance to the self-determination and liberation of all small and weak nations. Our Chinese nation is actively engaged in resisting the aggression of various imperialists, and we are constantly lamenting the failure of the Korean nation to remove the shackles of Japan at an earlier date. However, a group of ignorant Koreans are willing to be instigated by the Japanese, willing to be accomplices, unwilling to regard friends as enemies, and recognize thieves as fathers. Under the pretext of the Wanbaoshan Incident, they have inflicted extremely severe harm on our overseas Chinese. More than one hundred people have died, and more than one thousand have been injured. All places where our Chinese people rest have been completely destroyed. All areas where our Chinese people gather have been swept away. It must be known that the Wanbaoshan Incident was caused by Japanese military police instigating Korean expatriates to forcibly plant rice on our land, dig up our people's land, build dams without authorization, block waterways, and surround our country's agricultural police, using machine guns to fire, causing numerous deaths and injuries. The Koreans did not investigate, but instead used this as a pretext to start riots in Pyongyang, Seoul, Incheon, and other places. This is not only a manifestation of the numbness and decline of Korean national thought, but also a manifestation of being willing to be slaves to Japan. This is not only hated by the Japanese imperialists by our Chinese nation, but also deeply pitied by the Korean nation. We not only do not want the Koreans to be cattle and horses for the Japanese,</p>
<p>we do not want our brethren in Korea to face a brutal end or to be separated and homeless, and above all, we do not want the Japanese to drive out expatriates in Korea and practice their poisonous trick by using the hands of Koreans. We call on all our compatriots to rise up in unison, rescue our fellow countrymen from danger, save our nation from disaster, jointly resist foreign aggression, and jointly wash away our past hatreds.</p>
<h3>Declaration of Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, the Sixth District Water and Electricity Industry Union, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, the Shanghai Steamship Timber Industry Union, the Shanghai Sauce Industry Vocational Union, the Shanghai Newspaper Delivery Vocational Union, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Union, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Trade Vocational Union, the First District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, and more than one hundred other labor unions declared: Since Korea fell to the Japanese imperialists, Korean people have been forced to migrate to China, losing not only the sovereignty of their territory, but also the freedom of residence. The purpose of Japan is not only to gradually eliminate the future troubles of the Korean people, but also to use the Korean people as a tool to invade the Northeast. The poison of its policy is shocking. This time, the Korean people forcibly planted farmland within the territory of Wanbaoshan in our country, arousing the resistance of our country's farmers. The Japanese imperialists sent armed military police to shoot and kill innocent farmers in our country, and incited Koreans in Incheon, Pyongyang, and other places to arbitrarily kill Chinese people residing in Korea. The deaths, injuries, and losses are countless. With such cruel and violent acts, the Japanese imperialists are openly attacking us with despicable means of using borrowed knives to kill people and with the old tricks of treating the Korean people. At this time of revolutionary victory and bright future for our Great Republic of China, will we tolerate the humiliation of allowing the Japanese to act lawlessly, shame the civilization of East Asia, and not rise up and stop them sternly? The situation is critical, and the national crisis is at its height. Our country, from top to bottom, should recognize that this incident is indeed a violent and cruel act of the Japanese imperialists, and also an irreconcilable enemy of our four hundred million compatriots. We must unite and launch an active anti-Japanese imperialist movement. We will not stop until we achieve the goals of withdrawing troops stationed in the Northeast and compensating for damages. The survival of the nation depends on this one move. The members of our union are willing to pledge their lives with all our compatriots and jointly confront the national enemy. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Preparatory Office of the Shandong Business Community in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Respectfully to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Today, the newspaper reported that Koreans in Pyongyang and other places are committing hate crimes against overseas Chinese. The cruelty is appalling and unbearable to witness. Imperialists, through an indirect immigration policy, are migrating their people to Korea, driving the people of Korea to Wanbaoshan in our Jilin Province, and especially using the Wanbaoshan incident to vigorously propagate it, in order to incite the murderous ambitions of the Koreans, leading to the recent massacres in the capital cities of Incheon, Pyongyang, and other places. Koreans, as remnants of a vanquished nation, do not understand public law or speak of humanity, and especially have imperialists to lead them. The means by which they commit their atrocious crimes is as deep as water and as hot as fire, killing, massacring, burning, and destroying. Those who encounter it have their livers and brains splattered and blood raining down. Tens of thousands have left their homes, abandoned their wives and children, and live in various places in Korea as sojourners. Some have their heads separated from their bodies, some have their limbs incomplete, some have their entire families massacred, and their homes have become ruins. The disasters that have come are still developing. If we do not find a way to stop them, we do not know where it will end. Therefore, we appeal to your esteemed association to forward this message to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, as well as to the diplomatic authorities, to conduct serious negotiations as soon as possible, in order to save the tens of thousands of overseas compatriots. I am overwhelmed with urgency and await your command, the ninth day of the seventh month of the twentieth year.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Shandong Guildhall</h3>
<p>The Shandong Guildhall in Shanghai respectfully submits the following telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Based on a telegram from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Korea, after the Wanbaoshan Incident, Koreans in the capital city of Pyongyang, Incheon, and other places in Korea are hostile to Chinese people, and large-scale riots have broken out. Stores and residences have been looted and burned, and completely destroyed. Chinese people have been beaten, with nearly one hundred deaths and hundreds of injuries. The overseas Chinese in Korea are in extreme danger. If they are not rescued urgently, the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese will be subject to murder, injury, looting, and other things. Alas, our overseas compatriots have suffered tragic deaths, injuries, and displacement, and there is no way to appeal. Seeing this tragic situation, anyone with a bit of blood and spirit cannot but be indignant. The cruelty and barbarism of the Japanese toward our Chinese people can be said to have reached their extreme. We hereby report the situation to the esteemed (Ministry) (Government), earnestly requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be urgently instructed to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese side. At the same time, we also request that the Consul General in Korea be urgently instructed to lodge a serious protest with the Korean Governor-General's Office, to immediately stop the Korean riots, protect the lives and property of all Chinese people in Korea, and reserve the rights to punish the perpetrators and provide compensation and guarantees, in order to demonstrate our national dignity and protect the lives of our overseas Chinese. The telegram is urgent, and we cannot but pray for your assistance. The Board of Directors of the Shandong Guildhall in Shanghai kowtows.</p>
<h3>The Workers of the French Municipal Council Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Seventeen Conditions Agreed Upon</p>
<p>All employees and workers of the French Municipal Council went on strike to demand improved treatment. Subsequently, Mr. Du Yuesheng took on the role of mediator. For the sake of respecting the mediator's opinions, the negotiations proceeded smoothly. In particular, the workers were able to maintain order. Even during the strike period, the sanitary work was carried out as usual by Mr. Du's subordinates. Therefore, the French Municipal Council deeply understood this strike. The afternoon before yesterday, Mr. Du submitted the workers' demands to the Municipal Council, which were approved by the Council and immediately signed. Both parties were satisfied. On the workers' side, they have already resumed work yesterday afternoon. The conditions agreed upon are listed below.</p>

Moreover, if the employees can resume work within 48 hours from the morning of the 8th of this month, the salary of full-time employees during the strike period will be paid as usual. (16) All the work of the Bureau's workers is assigned by the foreman, and a deadline is set. If the workers are assigned to other tasks within the specified working hours, the time will be recorded and compensated separately. (17) The Bureau will formulate a separate management regulation for Chinese full-time employees and workers. The United Association may make suggestions when formulating the above-mentioned regulations. The regulations will be implemented at the same time as the aforementioned salary list, that is, on October 1.</p>
<h3>Statement from the Capitalists Regarding the Labor Strike at the Chinese Merchants Electric Company</h3>
<p>Workers of the Chinese Merchants Electric Company requested the company to fulfill the labor-capital contract signed with the capitalists, so on the 4th of this month, they implemented a policy of driving the trams but not selling tickets. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau summoned representatives of both labor and capital to mediate. As a result, the labor side immediately restored the original state on that day. As for the requested conditions, the two issues of bonuses and housing will be resolved after the temporary board of directors is convened. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau scheduled a second conciliation committee to be convened at 8:00 a.m. today to mediate again. The previous newspaper has reported the details. It is now known that yesterday, Lu Bohong, the general manager of the company, submitted a document to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "For the purpose of clarification, your bureau's No. 11999 directive is for the purpose of replying to the previously signed labor-capital contract, proposing to add supplementary clauses, and requesting verification and approval. All submitted documents have been reviewed. After the contract has been agreed and signed, it should be followed and implemented. If there is any unclear meaning, and the two parties cannot reach an agreement, a separate request for instructions and interpretation can be submitted. If changes are made without authorization, it will only cause disputes. Please comply with this directive." After receiving this directive, the company checked the previous notification from your bureau to revise the labor-capital contract. After several conciliations, nine articles were signed on May 28 and scheduled to be implemented on June 1. The company has been implementing them in order. Now, the following will be clarified to our bureau director regarding the implementation that has been completed and can be proven: (1) Yu Ziquan, a worker in the lighting department of our company, died on June 4, and Huang Zhilan, a tea server in the transportation department, died on June 12. After being notified by the labor union, they have been handled in accordance with Article 6 of the new contract. (2) Article 3, regarding the establishment of life insurance savings, a specialist has been hired to establish a savings department on June 15 to prepare the articles of association and investigate the worker roster. The savings passbooks are being printed, so they have not been issued yet. (3) Article 5, regarding the hospital measures, St. Vincent's Hospital and Guangci Hospital have been agreed upon long ago. Representatives have been sent to the Chinese Hospital twice to discuss the subsidy funding plan, but there has been no reply. A letter was sent again on the 23rd to urge a reply, but there has been no response. Pengshoutang Pharmacy has also been contacted and agreed upon. As for Western doctor Zhu Rongsheng, he was originally the doctor appointed by the company, so there is no problem. (4) Article 7, regarding the company's one-time subsidy of 5,000 yuan and a monthly subsidy of 600 yuan from June 1, it has been stated in the agreement that the aforementioned funds will be managed and used by the Huigong (Benefiting Workers) Affairs Committee. Now that the Huigong Affairs Committee has not been established and no one is responsible for the custody, the funds have not been paid. In summary, the company has been implementing the nine articles of the contract signed with the labor union on May 28 in order. However, the board of directors believes that the last sentence of Article 2 still needs to be considered, and Article 6 must be supplemented with clauses. Therefore, they have repeatedly consulted with the labor union representatives. The representatives agreed to inform the other representatives and then reply. However, a directive from your bureau was suddenly received, based on a report from the Shanghai South District Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union, stating that the capitalists are taking the opportunity to delay. An order was issued to submit a report. The general situation has been reported to your bureau. The labor union sent a letter on the 2nd of this month, stating that the company has no sincerity in seeking labor-capital cooperation in the new contract that has been signed by both parties, and requested a detailed and accurate reply by 2:00 p.m. on July 3, otherwise the company should be responsible for any unexpected events. The company replied that the two points of amendment and supplement proposed by the company have not been answered, and the matters that should be done in the contract have already begun to draft the articles of association, but they must be approved by the board of directors before they can be implemented, and it is impossible to hold them immediately. Since it is called labor-capital cooperation, the labor side should also understand the difficulties of the capitalist side. It can be said that the company treats the labor union with sincerity. However, on the morning of the 4th, the labor union suddenly opened the trams as usual, but did not sell tickets to passengers until after 5:00, causing traffic chaos and great losses to the company. The board of directors has now decided that the workers' failure to sell tickets this time can be said to be completely unreasonable. The loss should be borne by the labor union. It is appropriate to truthfully report that the agreement has been fulfilled. Please examine and allow the labor union to be ordered to compensate the company for the loss of not selling tickets in order to uphold the rule of law and sympathize with the difficulties of businesses. As for the amount of the loss, it will be reported again after verification, combined with clarification.</p>

<h3>Pan Xulun Returns to Shanghai to Practice as a Certified Public Accountant</h3>
<p>Dr. Pan Xulun, the director accountant of Lixin Certified Public Accountants Office at No. 452 Jiangxi Road in this port, has been practicing as a certified public accountant in Shanghai for many years and has gained the trust of all sectors. His business has been developing day by day. Last year, the National Government began to reorganize the national accounting administration. Knowing that Mr. Pan has knowledge and experience in accounting, he was appointed as a preparatory committee member of the Accounting Office. After the office was prepared, Mr. Pan was immediately appointed as the Accounting Officer of the National Government and Deputy Director of the Accounting Bureau. At that time, Mr. Pan believed that the planning of the accounting system of various government agencies was of great importance, and in order to serve the party and the country, he had to temporarily suspend his private profession. For the past six months, those who entrusted Lixin Certified Public Accountants Office with matters have been handled by consultants Gu Xun, Qian Naiqi, Yu Huairen, Xu Dunqi, Wang Danru, accountants, and Zhang Qinxian, director of the Document Section. Currently, the Accounting Bureau of the National Government is in urgent need of Mr. Pan to return to preside over everything in person, so Mr. Pan submitted a request to the National Government authorities at the end of last month to resign from his various positions as Accounting Officer and Director of the Accounting Bureau. At the beginning of this month, Mr. Pan returned to Shanghai to serve the society solely as a certified public accountant and will no longer go to Beijing to hold office.</p>

<h3>Dr. Xie Shou Kang Returns Home</h3>
<p>Famous Chinese French Litterateur</p>
<p>Dr. Xie Shou Kang, the Ambassador to Belgium, was sent by the National Government to the Belgian Centennial Independence Memorial Exposition last year to take the opportunity to promote Chinese culture. The various countries of the European continent, such as France and Germany, cultural organizations, competed to extend invitations to give lectures, which were very effective. Because Central University has repeatedly sent telegrams urging him to return home to preside over the School of Literature, he has taken the French ship Andre Lebon east and arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 this morning.</p>
<h3>Rising Sun Society Publishes New Shanghai Map</h3>

Recently, the society has found that many of the various Shanghai maps are outdated and cannot meet the current situation in Shanghai. It has spent several months of effort to conduct on-site investigations and compile a new type of Shanghai map, which is now published. Bookstores such as Datong Minzhi, Qixin, and Wenhua are selling it. In addition, the four-version newly produced Chinese textbook map for middle school students and the Chinese geographical evolution map are being ordered in large quantities by schools in various places to prepare for the next semester.</p>

<h3>Wife Requests Declaration of Husband's Death</h3>
<p>Sun Zhigang Has Not Returned for Ten Years</p>
<p>Gu Yinmei is in Dire Straits</p>
<p>Gu Changfa, a native of Dinghai, Zhejiang, lives at No. 1962 Yuqingli, Dongyouheng Road, is 60 years old. His daughter, Yinmei, is 33 years old and married Sun Zhigang (also known as A Gen), a native of Ningbo, in the fifth year of the Republic of China. They have two sons in total. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Zhigang's father died of illness. Zhigang disagreed with his stepmother, Chen, and took the silver from the Shunda Clothing Store that he had opened and ran away, claiming that he was going to join the army. He never returned, and the Shunda Clothing Store was closed due to lack of a manager. Sun Chen's livelihood in Shanghai was cut off, so she returned to her hometown and abandoned Yinmei. Yinmei had no choice but to rely on her father for a living. Unfortunately, misfortunes never come singly. The two children she gave birth to died one after another. Yinmei went to work at Hecheng Tobacco Factory to make a living. For the past ten years, there has been no news of Sun Zhigang. His death is unknown. Recently, she hired lawyer Lu Qi based on Article 8 of the Civil Code, which states that after a missing person has been missing for ten years, the court may declare the person dead at the request of interested parties. She has filed a lawsuit with the Special Court, requesting that Sun Zhigang be declared dead. The petition has been delivered, but it is not known whether it will be approved. According to Shanghai's usual practice, when a husband runs away, the wife only asks for a divorce. There has never been a case of requesting a declaration of the husband's death. This case is the first case in Shanghai's personal litigation.</p>
<h3>What Was Heard After Ye Zengshou Was Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Father Died, Leaving a Small Inheritance</p>
<p>Golden Business Failed the Year Before Last</p>
<p>Usually Likes to Worship Buddha</p>
<p>Maintained Entirely by Friends</p>
<p>The details of the kidnapping of Ye Zengshou, manager of Zhongfu Foreign Firm, have been reported in this newspaper twice. It is now known that Zengshou's father, named Jinsheng, used to be a steward of a foreign firm. He started from scratch with diligence and thrift and was enthusiastic about charity. After Jinsheng's death, Zengshou also had his father's style, so all his friends were people of morality. He was also a devout Buddhist on weekdays, and he did his best to help whenever there was an emergency. However, he failed in the golden business the year before last, which almost led to bankruptcy. All the real estate inherited from his father was mortgaged to others. At that time, he wanted to commit suicide, but fortunately, his family noticed and was maintained by his friends, which led to this day. Even the wool textiles currently operated by Zhongfu Foreign Firm are affected by the golden business, and they are always cutting meat to mend sores, taking care of the situation. Although he had received several threatening letters from the bandits before the kidnapping, Ye Zengshou ignored them because he thought he had no savings. After the kidnapping, he did not receive any contact letters from the bandits. The Fan family and their children were extremely anxious and had no way to save him. Mei Guan'gen, the driver, was suspected by the director of the First Section of the Seventh District of being involved in Ye's kidnapping and had to be thoroughly investigated. Later, his whole family begged for bail, which shows that Ye Zengshou's usual family management is based on the principle of seeking peace and tranquility.</p>
<h3>Gong Yan'nan, a Notorious Bandit from Nanhui, Transferred to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Local People Hate Him to the Bone</p>
<p>A Telegram Request to the Authorities to Punish Him Severely</p>
<p>The bandit Gong Yan'nan, also known as Xue Lan and Ye Nan, recently using the alias Shao Ruo, was born and raised in Zhujiaqiao, Nanhui, Pudong. He is a disciple of Ma Lisi, a ruthless and merciless womanizer. His wife, Lu Guifeng, is adept at aiding him in his evil deeds. He has many concubines, all of whom he plundered and later abandoned. He has a large number of disciples, such as Song Abai, Yang Qichun, Huang Yejin, Zhu Ahu, Zhou Jiannan, and hundreds of others, who serve as his henchmen. They run rampant in the villages, committing murder in broad daylight. The villagers fear him like a tiger. Anyone who dares to say a word against him is subjected to a barrage of fists. In even more severe cases, they gather a gang to retaliate and end the victim's life. As a result, the practice of armed fighting and kidnapping has become rampant in Pudong. The details of his recent arrest are as follows:</p>
<h3>Multiple Major Crimes</h3>
<p>Pudong has always been known for its tranquility, and the people of Nanhui are particularly honest and simple. However, since the rise of this notorious bandit and his rampaging gang, Yan Zhaoxiong, a relatively wealthy villager in the Fifth Regiment, became a target of the bandit's greed. In 1919, he was kidnapped and a huge ransom was demanded. In September 1921, a merchant named Zhang Meisong went to the bandit to collect payment for socks. The bandit chased him to the upper floor of the Zhangzhang Building and stabbed him multiple times, causing a shower of blood and instant death. In October 1927, he destroyed the Zhujiaqiao police station for gambling profits. In 1929, numerous major crimes such as kidnapping and murder occurred in the surrounding villages, including the tragic Red Disaster in Nicheng, where homes were burned and people were killed. Dozens of families, including Chu Aiqiao, Xue Haichun, Yao Huolin, Ma Qiqin, Gu Guisheng, Shi Guisheng, Gui Musheng, and Sun Changgeng, were robbed. In the Gui Musheng family, one person was even shot and killed. Zhang Zhi of Waxue Village, Yu Genlin of Yanjia Bridge, Ni Rongsheng of Tan Bridge, Jiang Zhiren of Wudian, and the son of Wang Yongqing of Chenjia Bridge were all kidnapped. The repeated incidents are too numerous to mention. All of these crimes were either personally led or instigated by the bandit leader. After the Nanhui County Government issued a warrant for his arrest, the bandit sought refuge with the lake bandit Taibao Ashu. He sent letters to merchants in Zhujiaqiao, threatening to settle accounts when the gunboats arrived. As a result, the merchants of Zhujiaqiao were constantly alarmed and unable to sleep peacefully.</p>
<h3>Rape and Murder of a Young Girl</h3>
<p>The notorious bandit indulged in lewd desires. He raped Bao Xiaodi's young daughter, causing her death. Other cases include the abduction of a Fengxian village girl named Adi and the daughters of villagers Wang and Zhang of Nanhui, all of whom he took as concubines and later abandoned. The villagers are all aware of these incidents.</p>
<h3>Arrest by a Large Force</h3>
<p>After the lake bandit leader Taibao Ashu was executed, the notorious bandit lost his patron. He then colluded with a certain Ma of the Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau, using the alias Gong Shaoruo, and fraudulently became the captain of the Third Squadron of the Fourth Brigade of the Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau in the Su area. He stationed his beloved disciples, Song Abai, Yang Qichun, Lu Meiting, and dozens of others, in the Nan Sitou area of Fengxian. The local area was subjected to endless harassment by them. Complaints were filed with higher authorities, but the Nanhui merchants discovered the bandit's whereabouts and requested his arrest. In April of the lunar calendar, the bandit was arrested by Brigade Commander Wu of the Fourth Anti-Smuggling Brigade. On June 3rd, the Nanhui County Government prepared a document to take custody of him, and he was finally brought to justice on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Transferred to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>The bandit's father, Wenbing, his wife Lu, his brother, and others, upon hearing that the bandit was being brought to justice, went around raising thousands of gold pieces to bribe officials. Recently, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters ordered the Nanhui County Government to immediately transfer the bandit Gong Yan'nan and his case file to the headquarters. After receiving the order, the Nanhui County Government compiled the case file and sent it to the headquarters. Currently, all sectors of Nanhui believe that if such a heinous criminal is not severely punished as a warning to others, the local area will be in a state of utter chaos. Therefore, they have unanimously sent a telegram requesting that he be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Robbery of 10,000 Yuan on the Road</h3>
<p>Four People Detained, Two Bandits Identified</p>
<p>Liu Caixin Has Admitted to the Robbery</p>
<p>Wu Heshun, a 30-year-old from Haimen, is a cook on a Taizhou steamer, frequently traveling between Hai and Shanghai. This time, when the steamer set sail from Haiqi, Wu was entrusted by Haimen Jufengzhuang Company to carry 10,000 yuan in cash to Hengfeng South Goods Store in Dasheng Lane, Xinkaihe, Shanghai, to purchase goods. Yesterday morning, the steamer arrived in Shanghai, and Wu, after tidying up, immediately divided the 10,000 yuan into two bundles of 5,000 yuan each. To be cautious, he asked his colleague Ding Awu to accompany him. At that time, it was raining heavily, so Wu wrapped the cash in oil paper to prevent moisture from penetrating. He gave one bundle to Ding, and they proceeded straight to Xinkaihe. Unexpectedly, when they reached Baodai Lane, which was close to Dasheng Lane, four robbers suddenly emerged from the roadside. One was wearing a white summer cloth gown, one was wearing a light yellow gauze shirt, and two were wearing white short outfits. They pulled out handguns, stopped Wu and Ding, and completely robbed them of the two bundles of cash totaling 10,000 yuan. As they left, they fired two shots into the ground as a warning. By the time the victims shouted for help, the robbers had already made off with the loot and disappeared into the French Concession. Wu reported the incident to the Second Precinct of the First District. Chief Yi, upon hearing the news, immediately led all the police officers to search for the robbers, but it was too late. Chief Yi urgently reported the incident to the French Police Department and, together with Chinese and foreign detectives and the two victims, Wu and Ding, conducted a door-to-door search in the inns west of Xiaodongmen. When they reached the Continental Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, they noticed a man standing at the entrance. Upon seeing the large number of detectives, he immediately looked flustered. Wu identified him as one of the robbers at the scene. He was arrested and interrogated. Three more people were arrested in a room upstairs in the Continental Hotel. Wu identified one of them. He could not mistakenly identify the other two because of their different clothing. All of them were taken into custody. After Chief Yi conducted a preliminary interrogation, the robber arrested at the entrance of the Continental Hotel confessed his name as Liu Caixin, from Ningbo, 30 years old. The other three identified themselves as Zheng Huimin, from Ningbo, 24 years old; Yang Zhurong, from Qingjiang, 38 years old; and Zhang Mingzhi, from Yangzhou, 35 years old. Their statements were extremely cunning. It is reported that the last suspect, Liu, has confessed. Zheng is also highly suspected. The other two, Yang and Zhang, are still under detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fengming's Attempt to Strangle Apprentice Case</h3>
<p>A Hearing Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Further Investigation Is Still Necessary</p>
<p>Qian Minglong, an apprentice at Zhang Shengji Western Clothing Store on Zhonghua Road, Xiaoximen, was sleeping soundly at dawn on the 27th of last month when he was attacked by his former colleague, Zhang Fengming, who used a trouser belt to strangle his neck in an attempt to kill him. Fortunately, he woke up early and cried for help, avoiding a fatal outcome. He immediately reported the incident to the police, who arrested Zhang and handed him over to the District Court for questioning and detention. The details were reported previously. It is now known that this case has been thoroughly investigated by Prosecutor Yang Wenjun, who has filed a public prosecution citing Article 282, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Deng Peiyi specially opened the Fifth Court and ordered the detained Zhang Fengming, 29 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 127 Bazilu, a tailor, to appear in court for questioning. Zhang stated that he worked at Zhang Shengji as a colleague in February of this year, but resigned due to slow business. He is now working at Yushunli in Dongbaoxing Road. (Judge asked) Since you have resigned, why did you come back? (Zhang answered) To find a friend. (Judge asked) When did you come? (Zhang answered) Around 11 o'clock in the evening. (Judge asked) Why didn't you go back? (Zhang answered) Because it was late and the journey back to Zhabei was far, so I borrowed a place to stay overnight at the store. (Judge asked) Do you have any grudges with Qian Minglong? (Zhang answered) No. (Judge asked) If you have no grudges, why did you want to strangle him? (Zhang answered) That's not true. I only hit him a few times with my trouser belt. (Judge asked) You confessed to strangling him at the Public Security Bureau and the Prosecutor's Office. Why are you changing your story now? (Zhang answered) I was frightened at that time, my mind was not clear, I was not in control of myself, and I said a few words in confusion. (Judge asked) How did the injuries on Qian Minglong's neck come about? Zhang was speechless. The judge ordered Qian Minglong to appear in court. He stated that he was 18 years old, from Ningbo, and an apprentice at Zhang Shengji. (Judge asked) Do you have any disagreements with Zhang Fengming? (Qian answered) No. (Judge asked) Why did he want to strangle you? According to my speculation, I am the only one guarding the store. If he killed me, he could steal the goods from the store and sell them. (Judge asked) How did he strangle you? (Qian answered) I slept in the same room with him. At around 4 o'clock, he suddenly untied my trouser belt. I was sound asleep at this time. He wrapped it around my neck and tightened it forcefully. I immediately woke up and struggled with him, crying for help. Fortunately, the tenants upstairs heard the noise and came downstairs to rescue me, so I was not strangled to death. However, I was seriously injured at the time and vomited blood, and so on. Next, the witnesses (i.e., neighbors) Mu He, Zhang Yuyuan, Yao Wang, and others testified to everything. Then, the store owner Zhang Weisheng testified that he was 56 years old, from Ningbo, and in the Western clothing business, currently residing on Avenue Joffre. He stated that he was not in the store on the night of the incident, so he did not know what happened at the time. (Judge asked) Did you dismiss the defendant because of Qian Minglong's words? (Zhang answered) I am an adult, how could I listen to the words of a child? The business was indeed slow, so I dismissed him, and so on. According to Yang Desheng, a patrol officer from the Second Precinct of the Third District, 32 years old, from Shandong, he was on duty at the Xiaoximen entrance at 3:30 that night when a child (referring to the victim Qian Minglong) ran up and claimed that he had been murdered. He listened to the statement and accompanied the child to the scene, where he saw the defendant with two trouser belts tied around his waist. He questioned him, but he was evasive and did not answer, so he took him to the police station. After hearing this, the defendant's lawyers, Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun, stood up and defended the defendant. The judge stated that there was still a need to investigate this case, so he adjourned the debate and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>The Mingyuan Lawsuit Against the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The English Court Declared the Case Dismissed</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that after the Municipal Council ordered the Ming Shen Two Gardens to stop dog racing, the Dog Racing Association, which operates Mingyuan, sued the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Macnaghten, and the Chief Inspector, Martin, for damages of 2.5 million taels. The court issued a notice on April 14 and summoned lawyers from both sides on April 30, ordering them to submit pleadings. On May 15, the plaintiff submitted a pleading, detailing the reasons for the lawsuit. On May 26, the defendant submitted a defense, requesting that the lawsuit be dismissed. At the beginning of last month, Commissioner Crane summoned both parties for questioning and today declared that the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected and the case was dismissed. The court fees were to be borne by the plaintiff. It is reported that the Mingyuan side may file another lawsuit against the Municipal Council in the Consular Court, but this is not certain.</p>
<h3>Two Female Child Laborers Die Tragically in the Yong'an Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>Chen Hedi and Ma Xiaohong</p>
<p>Both Under the Age of Fifteen</p>
<p>Chen Hedi, a 13-year-old female child laborer from Changzhou, living in the Yong'an Second Yarn Factory's workshop No. 41, accidentally got her clothes caught in a fine yarn machine while working in the factory's fine yarn room at around 2 p.m. yesterday. She was unable to break free, and her entire body was pulled into the roller. Her head and chest were severely injured, and she bled from the mouth. She died instantly, a tragic sight. In addition, Ma Xiaohong, a 10-year-old female child laborer from Taixing, living in Zhang Depu's contractor's residence near the factory, was hit in the head by an iron crane while working in the factory at around 4 p.m. on the same day. Her face was covered in blood. The factory immediately sent her to the Seashore Public Hospital for treatment, but her injuries were too severe to be treated, and she died soon after. Both cases have been reported by the local bailiff to the District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>An Ancient Elm Tree Outside the North Gate of Baoshan Was Destroyed by Lightning</h3>
<p>There are two elm trees outside the north gate of Baoshan, on the bank of the moat. Both are more than a hug in circumference, with lush branches and leaves, providing a beautiful green shade. According to legend, they are relics from five or six hundred years ago. At around 3 p.m. yesterday, the sky was overcast with dark clouds, and there was thunder and lightning. Suddenly, there was a loud clap of thunder, and one of the trees was struck by lightning and immediately collapsed to the ground. Fortunately, it was raining heavily at the time, and pedestrians were staying indoors, so no one was injured. However, when the tree was struck and collapsed, the sky was filled with flames, and the sound shook the houses. The residents of the entire city were greatly frightened. Afterwards, the residents learned that the tree had been destroyed by lightning and rushed to watch, causing a crowded scene.</p>
<h3>Record of Commercial Vehicle Trial Run</h3>
<p>Contract Signed with the Railway Bureau</p>
<p>Contract for a Term of Five Years</p>
<p>Freight transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways is congested, and there is often a shortage of vehicles. Situ Xiji gathered funds to organize the Commercial Sino-Vehicle Co., Ltd., and ordered 200 twenty-ton freight cars to help the railway bureau with transportation. The cars have now been shipped to Shanghai. Situ Xi has repeatedly discussed the terms of the lease with the railway bureau. As a result, the 200 cars ordered by the company will be supplied to the railway bureau for transportation, with a term of five years. Within five years, the company will receive one-tenth of the transportation rental fee. After five years, the vehicles will be entirely owned by the railway bureau. After mutual consultation, it was decided yesterday to transport five of the freight cars to the Rihui Port Station. Each car was temporarily loaded with ten tons of coal for a trial run to Hangzhou. If the results are stable, all of the cars can be leased.</p>
<h3>Ye Ruchun Has Been Sentenced to Death, His Mother Requests a Retrial</h3>
<p>Involved in the Cai Fulin Case</p>
<p>Whether to Grant a Retrial Has Not Yet Been Decided</p>
<p>Ye Ruchun, 37, from Yuyao, an employee of the Shanghai Gramophone Company on Zhifu Road, was a special police officer in the patrol. Last winter, he was suspected of being involved in the kidnapping of Cai Fulin, a comprador of the British American Tobacco Company. He was arrested by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate and sentenced to death by the Special District Court after interrogation. Now, Ye's mother, Zhou, has hired lawyer Lu Qi to submit a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting a retrial by the original court, listing several reasons for the request. (1) Cai Fulin identified Ye Ruchun as the driver. When Cai was at the patrol, he claimed that the driver had pockmarks on his face and spoke with a northern accent. However, in court, he saw that Ye had no pockmarks and could not speak with a northern accent, so he dropped this point. This is clearly inconsistent. (2) Cai claimed that he heard Ye's accent in the bandit's den and asked if he had blood on his head. However, Cai testified in court that there were no electric lights in the bandit's den, only kerosene lamps, so he only heard Ye's voice and could not see him clearly. However, two months passed between the time Cai was kidnapped and the time he testified in court. It is impossible to distinguish a person's voice after such a long time. This cannot be adopted. (3) Why was the photograph of the bandit leader Yang Yisheng found in Ye's home? Yang opened a toothbrush shop and was also a member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps for more than ten years. Ye was a special police officer. It is natural for them to be friends since they were both maintaining the security of the concession. Moreover, when Ye turned 36, patrol officers, translators, and others came to celebrate his birthday and took a group photo as a memento. How can the original trial recognize this as evidence of collusion with bandits? Are all the patrol officers who were in the photo also suspected of colluding with bandits? This is unreasonable and laughable. (4) Cai's wife, Qin, testified that when contacting for the ransom, she saw Ye near Yile, as if he was keeping watch. She never testified that Ye Ruchun accompanied Rong Jian to negotiate the ransom. What Cai and Qin saw was that Qin did not go with them, and the testimony lacked the statement of being together. The original judgment was based on nothing and came out of nowhere. Why not deliberately fabricate it? The court has submitted the case file to the provincial government for review. Whether or not Ye's mother's request will be granted will be decided after a meeting of the provincial committee.</p>

<h3>Good News for Purchasing New-Style Residences</h3>
<p>Meihua Company Builds Western-Style Bungalows</p>
<p>Exclusively for Ambitious Young People to Enjoy Happiness</p>
<p>Housing is the most important thing in life. In Shanghai, it is not difficult for wealthy merchants, high-ranking officials, and foreigners to own elegant and beautiful residences to suit their temperaments. However, ordinary people who serve society find it difficult to consider the quality of their housing and even more difficult to talk about buying property. Therefore, they live within their means, sharing rented accommodations. Two or three families live together in one room, separated by partitions. Not to mention the spread of diseases and the varying qualities of people, every time one is in the midst of a good dream, loud noises arise, and men and women mingle together, playing mahjong and singing loudly. Those with strong will feel the pain of insomnia, and their minds will inevitably be distracted the next day. Young people with weak will are assimilated over time and may fall into ruin. Some even find the noise of living together annoying and seek to dispel their boredom in singing halls, dance halls, pubs, and tea houses, wasting both their spirit and money. It is extremely difficult to live in Shanghai, as such. People are busy all day long, relying on their quick minds and hard work to advance society and seek personal happiness. How can it not be a great hardship if there is no suitable place to live, rest, and recuperate to adjust their bodies? In other cities in the interior, it does not take much money to find a simple and comfortable residence. However, in Shanghai, land prices have skyrocketed over the years, so how can one talk about buying property? It is now reported that the Meihua Real Estate Company in Shanghai, in view of this, has recently built forty or fifty Western-style bungalow residences on Sigao Tower Road and Xiangde Road. The architectural style is extremely new and beautiful, with gardens, open space, reception rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and everything else one could need. Each building is sold separately at a reasonable price. The company's purpose is to build exclusively for ambitious and moral people in society. It is still under construction and will be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Avenue Joffre</h3>

Two robbers, armed with guns, broke into the store and snatched 98 yuan in paper money, 56 yuan in silver dollars, and 180 jiao in double coins from the counter. They fled westward into Li Mei Road. The victim reported the loss to the police and requested an investigation.</p>

Moreover, the price is very cheap, so it sells especially well.</p>
<h3>Founding of the School for Specialized Language Studies</h3>
<p>Recently, Miss Gu Shuxing, a graduate of the University of California in the United States, has, together with individuals from China, England, Germany, France, Russia, and Japan in Shanghai, established the School for Specialized Language Studies at No. 127, the intersection of Avenue Road and Xiaoshadu Road. The school teaches the languages and literature of various countries. As a specialized institution, its purpose is to cultivate translators and interpreters. The content and scale are very large, making it the pioneer of language schools in Shanghai. It is also heard that the selection of teachers is extremely strict. Instructors for each language are native speakers. Those who have already been appointed include Mr. Kirk for the German department, as well as Mrs. Hanbo, Mrs. Yu Aimili for the French department, and Miss Tuo Ge Xifa for the Russian department, all of whom have a solid foundation in literature. It is noted that Miss Gu Shuxing, after graduating from the United States, also traveled extensively to Germany, France, and Japan, specializing in language studies. She has been recommended by the initiators as the principal of the school. The board of directors includes Zhou Gengsheng, Xu Chusheng, and others.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Abstract Translation of Feitang Report, Volume Six</h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>This article is compiled by Mr. Feitang, and is an abstract of the sixth volume of his report on the surfaces of roads outside the concessions. To see the whole picture, including charts and detailed content, one should refer to the full text of the report. The original text of Volume 3 of the report can be purchased directly from Bie Fa Foreign Firm, Sino-American Bookstore, and Evans Bookstore Limited, at the price of one dollar each. The Chinese translation is in progress.</p>
<h3>Volume Six</h3>
<p>This volume focuses on the surfaces of roads outside the concessions. Volume 3 of the report includes Volume 6 of the report, with a map showing the surfaces of roads outside the concessions. The so-called surfaces of roads outside the concessions are divided into two areas: one to the west of the Public Concession and one to the north of the Public Concession, surrounded by roads of the Municipal Council outside the concessions, or by the boundaries of the Municipal Council's properties connected to these roads. (1) The western area covers 7.640 acres, where Zhaofeng Park is located, divided into two parts by the arc-shaped railway tracks connecting the Jinghu and Huhang lines. (2) The northern area covers more than 283 acres, located east of the Songhu Railway line, where Hongkou Park is located.</p>
<h3>Chapter One</h3>
<p>This is the preface, stating that the issue of road surfaces outside the concessions is left for discussion in this volume, partly to make it clear and simple, and partly because this issue is felt to be difficult to resolve satisfactorily without reference to considerations affecting the status of the Public Concession itself. Particular attention has been paid to the extent to which the interests of residents in the Public Concession are related to the road surfaces outside the concessions. The two areas are very important to the existing Public Concession. From the perspective of future progress, their relationship is even more significant. If the Public Concession maintains its status as a great commercial and industrial center, and continues to develop accordingly, then the majority of the personnel employed by various institutions, businesses, and factories in the Public Concession will become increasingly dependent on these two areas. This is not only because the two areas can provide expanded locations for residence, but also because the land required for various activities related to the great social life and health is no longer sufficient within the existing boundaries of the Public Concession, and the two areas can meet this urgent need. Therefore, how the two areas are dealt with, and the nature of their administrative regulations, are deeply and closely related to the present and future interests of the Public Concession.

<h3>The Summer Vacation Life of Aspiring and Energetic Youths</h3>
<p>— Jin Peishan</p>
<p>Another long summer has arrived. Students, who usually live a golden university life, have returned to their hometowns to dream sweet summer night dreams. Most of the grand buildings of the universities are deserted and quiet. However, our aspiring and energetic athletes mostly come from different places in the north and south. Because the journey is long, they stay at school during both winter and summer vacations, living a different kind of holiday life. Especially the summer vacation, these two months feel like years. Now I will report on the summer vacation life of the athletes of Chih Chih University.</p>
<p>Xia Zeren He is the captain of the basketball team of Chih Chih University. He has worked hard for four years and won honor for his alma mater. This summer, he has earned his graduation cap and a bachelor's degree in commerce. However, he is still reluctant to leave his beloved alma mater. During the summer vacation, he gets up at 6:00 AM to practice on the basketball court. In the afternoon, he goes to the Hongkou swimming pool to swim. In the evening, he enjoys the cool breeze in Hongkou Park or on campus. The one he loves the most is his old brother Kong Guangyi. They are always together, inseparable.</p>
<p>Yang Linyu His hometown is far away on the Philippines Island, across the vast ocean. He hasn't been back for a long time. His summer vacation life is pleasant and healthy. He always gets up at 6:00 AM to practice sprinting, from the front gate of Chih Chih University on Jiangwan Road, back to the back gate, about a mile's distance. He does this every morning without interruption. After lunch in the afternoon, he also goes to the Hongkou swimming pool. He only returns when the sun sets and the evening breeze brings coolness. He spends every day with Zheng Mengqing, a volleyball player, because they are both overseas Chinese and speak the same language.</p>
<p>Xia Yushu He is Captain Xia's younger brother, nicknamed Lao San. He is famous throughout the school for his humor. Last summer vacation, at the summer school of Shanghai University, he was nicknamed the King of Humor. There are two more things that can show his humorous nature. In the scorching summer, many people are afraid of the sun and mosquitoes, so everyone cannot sleep much, and everyone's appetite must also decrease. But he still takes a nap (siesta) every day, and eats four large bowls of rice for each meal. But he has a virtue, he loves to read and study English, and is one of the best in school. He also likes to speak English, and always says "Are You Happy" when he sees people. During the summer vacation, he eats a watermelon every day. After eating, he takes another nap. His good friend is Sun Wuhou, a humorist from Soochow University. They are truly like-minded.</p>
<p>Kong Guangyi During the summer vacation, he not only has a ball in his hand, but also a book in his hand. It is conceivable that he likes to learn and think deeply. He likes to eat soda and ice cream, and asks the school servant to buy them every day. Because it is too hot and there are too many mosquitoes at night, he enjoys the cool breeze and does not sleep until 12:00 AM. He gets up at 6:00 AM every morning. Basketball is his specialty. Recently, because the weather has been very hot, he hasn't practiced for a long time and has been swimming instead.</p>
<p>Gao Dahan He is the cornerstone of Chih Chih University's soccer team. He was born in Korea. His homeland is thousands of miles away. He never returns for winter or summer vacations. He gets up at 6:00 AM every day and drinks cold water. This is truly a characteristic of Koreans. In addition to playing tennis every day, he practices Chinese calligraphy and reads new literature, especially works about love, such as "Rose Spring Dream" and "Web of Love."</p>
<p>Chen Bosang His home is far away in Kajang, Selangor, Nanyang. He has been studying at Chih Chih University for five years and has not returned home. He is used to school life during the summer vacation. He is a tennis player at Chih Chih University, as famous as He Zuochang. He plays tennis for more than three hours every day. Although the sun is scorching this year, it cannot stop his tennis enthusiasm. He likes to play music. He is proficient in the violin and other musical instruments. Whenever the evening breeze brings coolness and the moon is in the sky, he sings a song under the big tree on campus, which is fascinating. Sometimes, he and his Nanyang friends chat and laugh under the trees on campus, or sing "Ramona" and Nanyang folk songs. His summer vacation life has artistic interest and is very enviable.</p>

<h3>French General Foch's Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Commander Petain can restore the situation by drawing a few divisions from the reserve army and the eastern army, plus the Tenth Army and two well-trained American divisions (the Third and Fifth Divisions). However, the steps of operations on all fronts must be clearly stipulated and strictly followed. I think this is the key to turning danger into safety. On the afternoon of the 31st, I explained this point to Commander Petain and Commander Chang Xingsi (note, i.e., the commander of the Sixth Army, which was destroyed on the Ximing River) in the Curie Castle.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to simply instruct the commanders to pay attention to important tasks. Now it is necessary to seek new forces to supply them. On the 31st, Commander-in-Chief Haig came to Saggs to see me. I told him that a few American divisions that are being trained in the British area may be transferred to the French side, and two divisions may be drawn from the northern detachment. When the enemy attacks the French line fiercely, the British army may need to help. Now preparations must be started.</p>
<p>On June 1, the enemy continued to attack without ceasing, and made major progress between the Marne River and the Ourcq River, and towards the Ferre-Cotterets Forest.</p>
<p>Commander Petain saw that the situation was dangerous, and emergency measures became increasingly necessary. He wrote again to inform him of the difficulties in supporting the war, and strongly requested that the American and British reinforcements go quickly.</p>
<p>In the letter, he attached the report of Commander Gasser, telling him that if the German army exerted pressure on the defense line of the Eastern Army, because of the lack of reserves, he would have to order a few divisions that had not been attacked to retreat quickly, and reorganize to wait for the opportunity.</p>
<p>This clearly shows a lack of confidence, completely disregarding the point that I specifically drew attention to in Curie Castle on May 31. In the past few weeks, I had seen the same symptoms on the British side under the same circumstances. I had to further encourage the armies.</p>
<p>On June 2, after a meeting with Commander Petain in Poppen, I made our conversation into the following plan and handed it to him:</p>
<p>"(1) The French commander must take preventing the enemy from advancing towards Paris, especially north of the Marne River, as the guiding principle of the command of the war.</p>
<p>"(2) On this front, we must hold on with all our strength with a step-by-step strategy.</p>
<p>"(3) The operating procedures of the officers and soldiers of the armies must be made into military orders, strictly followed, and any officer who is incompetent will be replaced."</p>
<p>In order to restore morale, I added the following clause:</p>
<p>"(4) All the Allied forces should do their best to help on this front."</p>
<p>I agreed with Commander Pershing to transfer five American divisions to the French line to take over the peaceful areas, so that the French troops in that area could be transferred to the front line to help the war. I also asked Commander-in-Chief Haig to draw three divisions from the British Army General Reserve and open them to the west of Amiens to assist the British and French armies. Finally, I moved to Morey on June 1 and to Pontpoint on June 5 in order to be close to the French General Staff.</p>
<p>The large French reinforcements arrived, and the front-line commanders allocated them properly. In addition, because the enemy was tired and exhausted, the situation between the Arras River and the Marne River gradually stabilized. On June 23, the German army had a difficult attack south of Soissons. On June 4, the enemy stopped attacking.</p>
<p>West of the Arras River, another major battle is in preparation between Noyon and Montdidier.</p>
<p>Commander Mangin was ordered to command this battle. On the afternoon of the 10th, I saw him in Noyon in a military hurry, and was meeting with Commander Foch on everything. He explained the battle plan to me. Although most of his teams, especially the artillery teams, could not arrive until night, he decided to launch a unified attack the next morning. He first summoned the artillery division commanders and the main army officers to give instructions on the training ground, instructing them on the opportunity to advance and assigning them combat missions. At night, the armies continued to arrive and proceeded according to the scheduled plan.</p>
<p>At night, Commander Mangin issued orders to the division commanders, specifying the time for the artillery to prepare and the time to carry out the attack.</p>
