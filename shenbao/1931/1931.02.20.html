<p>美國之救濟銀賤政策。除以銀貸與中國外。尙有用銀爲輔幣之一策。此策而果得各國贊同者。亦大足以收救濟之實效也。據今日國民社電。美參院外委會。已贊成畢特門建議。請胡佛總統與其他各國政府。協商阻止銀價跌落之計劃。並請於必要時。召集國際大會。協定以銀爲輔幣之辦法。路透電亦。謂美參院財委會。請胡佛與他國談判中止熔化銀幣。及售銀於世界市塲政策。並請召集國際大會商定用銀爲幣辦法。此兩電固同出於華盛頓方面之一種宣傳。然美政府果能以此倡。導亦未始無幾分希望。觀昨日英財政大臣之言。亦贊成國際會議。者倘能英美同心。以號召此救濟銀賤之國際大會。是誠第一步之辦法。也大會成立之後。再能誠心協力以商訂一金銀比例之標。準定出一種通行之輔幣。其獲益絕非其他空言救濟者所能比擬第此事仍關於產金國與產銀國之利害。欲使其意見歸於一致。殊爲不易。則此議仍恐成爲泡影耳</p>

<p>法之里昂大學内有分校一。専爲中國學生程度不及者補習而設。吳氏曾一度爲該分校之副校長。並挈其親屬二人在該校補習。一男一女。女可二十許。而男祇十齡左右耳。校内宿舍。分别男女。絕不相混。乃男者因年太幼。一切均賴女者看護。而宿舍隔絕。諸感不便。吳氏令男戚與女者同住女生宿舍。詎料不數日而全校學生大譁。以女生宿舍不許混居男子。且禀之校長。校長固爲一腦筋頑古之法人也。亦以爲然。即出示禁止之。惟不涉及姓氏。大意謂男女有别。不容混雜。重申前禁。詞頗嚴厲。吳氏見示。固知其爲嘲已也。大憤。即至校長家面質曰。「汝祇知男女而不知長幼乎余戚屬年甫十齡。豈得謂之成人。更豈能有曖昧之行爲乎」。時該校長方手携一幼女。吳氏指而笑語曰。「君與此女者同處。亦將謂之不規則耶」。校長語塞。笑而道歉。吳氏不但擅法文。且亦精於英語。外人多敬服之</p>

<p>文初寄自馬里剌</p>
<p>歷屆嘉年華會。有選舉菲律賓女士。充會中花后。因菲律賓合呂宋米西亞民蘭橈三大羣島組織而成。故於菲律賓女士外。又有呂宋士米西亞女士民蘭橈女士諸名。以位置品貌及財勢稍次者。亦猶正座外有副座也。惟本屆則有特趣者數事。是不可以不記。</p>
<p>變更選舉制在四五年前。其選權操之各股東。以其可乞靈於財勢。乃特設審美委員會。凡各報初選人。須經各委員品頭評足。去年某女士以拒絕穿浴衣。願放棄被選權。而當選之花后。其所肄業天主敎書院。謂其心慕虚榮。致召侮辱。（因穿浴衣任各委員近觀遠視）竟開除其學籍。由是社會上對此舉。發生兩種論調。大起爭辯。本屆乃又變更制度。仍由各股東複選之。究竟眞正美麗之小家碧玉。仍不得公意擁戴。純爲政界名媛。或財閥閨秀所逐鹿。蓋十餘天之皇冕繼承人。大堪爲親戚朋儕光。且令一班豪華少年。拜倒右榴裙下也。</p>
<p>不愧爲龍種本屆所被選之菲律賓女士。乃國書館主任兼大學敎授之女公子。其　於一九○八年。被選爲第一次嘉年華會花后。有全島美人之稱。被選之呂宋女士。爲新怡詩夏省大地主之女公子。其表姊亦爲三年來退任之花后蘭芬桂馥。產在一家。亦選舉聲中一珍聞也。</p>
<p>不願居副　座當加冕之夜。大跳舞塲中。電炬輝煌。香車賓輦爭候於門。嘉年華會當事人。忽接得呂宋女士來函。謂已言旋故鄕。享田家樂趣。不願在此虚榮塲中。過繁華生活云云。據知其内幕者云。呂宋女士以已貌之美。在菲律賓女士上。不願屈居其下。故願犧牲名位。在當局亦不爲循例挽留。即以票數次多者補充云。</p>

<p>（二一二）靈花</p>
<p>十號楊雙林君將之暹羅。有友從暹羅來。約之。余惟暹羅爲世界第一純粹佛敎國。將遊之而未果。今已來緬。然緬甸今主治者爲英人。固非以佛法治國者。而暹能以純粹佛敎治國。且一切已獨立。國勢甚盛。對外獨立。居然收回治外　法權等事。且爲我國所不能爲。必有特異之點。果如此。則佛敎不能治國之例。亦打破矣。友談暹羅入口搜查甚嚴。任何國人均然。不獨對中國。至中國人在暹者。難定確數。或云暹民人數八九百萬。中八種占三分之一但爲國界限制。一切須受暹法律約束。非人種問題也。到暹爲敎習者。須學暹文方可暹人奉佛好施。而貧。施於乞丐亦行敬禮。友人以爲將來世界上免共大刦者。莫若暹緬風俗之厚也。惟今亦受經濟上影響。其良風美俗　。有不能抵抗經濟之壓迫者。至物質尙未發達。衛生亦不重要。生活簡單。人生觀甚自由也。而暹王族因維持血統起見。不與外族通婚。以其本宗姊妹爲后。此乃異子我國甚矣。暹羅佛像與各國異。多軍裝站立之像。少坐像。均以手作抵拒勢。余初在檳城見之未覺其美。據人云。暹佛像所以如此者。因從前遭兵刦。有佛顯靈作此像。故後即遍地塑其像如是云。中國與暹羅之關係。不知何年。有一趣事云。安徽九華山。有佛像坐化。係暹王之弟。化身爲地藏王。某年人訛云暹王弟又將到中國。一時人歡迎甚爲熱烈。要之由此觀之，將來中暹必有一番良好之交際。此爲其動機歟。何吾國崇拜暹王之弟如此其甚也。其謠傳即因暹王弟爲地藏王化身之說。九華山爲地藏道塲每年士女進香極盛。因宗敎感情聯絡國際。亦外交上一良法也。</p>

<h3 id="c170">合作綱要湯彬 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>尹讓能譯</p>
<p>近數十年來、中國經濟環境是受了世界的影響漸使它呈顯着落後的狀態、因爲金融陷於枯涸、常使社會上發生種種不安寗的現象、進一步說就、是各方面都能受經濟落後的影響的、在這種情形之下、我們一定要以一種合理的方法補救這經濟落後的危機、在中一方面就是謀社會的安寗人類的幸、福同時我們要明白、人生於世没有不消费的、那麽我們就非生產不可了、</p>
<p>生產的方法當然很多、我們是要求那合理的產生方法能夠實、現這裏所要述的、即是從普通字典中所引用出來的合作兩字、即照字義上看、也能明瞭、這是人類間一種互相作用的結合、也就是許多人結合起來、依共同的目標、進行一件工作、這當然是很合理的一種經濟行爲、狹義的說例如我國各中學和大學裏的學生、大都有消費合作社的組織、其成績尙有可觀、但其意義推而廣之也和現在所要說的合作一樣、不過範圍的大小區别而已、消費合作是兩個名詞所聯合起來的、所以這「合作綱要」一書對於消費一項也說得很清楚的、</p>
<p>在我們中國、凡是一種合理的事業、常要使人理想到畸形方面的發展、即如消費合作也常要趨向於某一個階級方面、競爭有限的市塲、結果勢必釀商業盛衰的循環、說這才是含有科學的基礎、然而</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>這樣的消費合作、根本就失去了它原來合理的眞義、關於此、這書中的「消費者和社會」的一節裏說得明澈、眞的、「合作不是一個階級運動、這是以一切人們的好處做根據的、它不承認階級、也不挑這一個階級反對那一個階級、它又不加罪於謀利營業、它看得出現在所行的宛易、計算和處理營業等方法的價値、因爲這是由長久經騐做出來的、所以它進而利用它們、來替消費者服務、」這話當然是很正確的、合作社在社會上的可能性、可以從這個事實上看出來、就是、在有些地方上、許多有益的服務已由合作完成、這樣的地方、各國都有、一個在捷克斯拉夫的、可算得是模範、那裏有個勃利格奇村、村裏有三百五十戶人家、每家都是合作社社員、後來這村裏的生活多半仰仗着這個社、這裏就是消費者組織起來、専以較易取得他們所需要的東西爲目的、並且在他們所享受用的東西上、保護他們利益的一個地方、關於其詳細情形及辦理的完善、本書中所述均很詳細、由此、我們可以明瞭消費者爲他們自己好處的組織、是在社會上有重大關係的、消費者不是一個階級、他們乃是一切的人、他們所求的不是一個階級的好處、乃是社會上全體的幸福、所以、提倡合作運動却是一種極有意義的事、</p>
<p>因爲消費的組織、有經久的可能性、正爲了它是爲整個社會謀幸福的一種運動、在合作的一個目的亦是廢止漁利和倚賴、調和資本和勞力、服務的完成、和東西的消費、可以調和在一起、「合作社會」的理想、是工匠受雇於社、會盡其所能去努力最好的工作、盡其所能去創造最好的東西、而他所製造的東西、不是在市面賣去謀利的、它們是歸於他在裏面工作的社會所有、而他也是這社會的一份子、所以他所造出的全部價値、只除去提出來辦社會公益的部份、並且這也是他有份的、倘若這合作实能夠普遍、那麽社會是的安寗也得到鞏固的防衛、</p>
<p>合作社發逹的程序、當然是由小漸大、有許多大的計晝、要起首就辦大的合作社、做大的經營、但是没有奏効的、人們用些相互的約束、首先團結起來、然後學會了怎樣合力去辦一個小的合作事業、這樣才會有成効、等到他們有了成績、然後增加他們的社員、等到他們熟悉了一種經營、然後再向别的方面去推廣合作是經營上一個進化的例子、在中國、各中學和大學校裏有消費合作社的組織、却是一種良好的現象、像學生的智識份子能養成這樣、克苦服務的精神、委實値得我們的敬佩、不過社會上、對於這種合作的組織還很少、這是我們應該盡量鼓吹的、記得在數年前、一般學者曾有合作運動的提倡、但這聲浪在不久之造就消滅成幻影了、</p>
<p>在中國經濟形態這樣的落後之、下這爲全人類謀幸福的合作却有重視之必要、不過像具有正確論斷的關於此項事業發展的専著、在我國目前的出版界實不多見、有的、提着經濟和社會發生了聯繫、那就要有目的在宣傳什麽　　思主義的經濟政策了、這祇有擾亂社會安寗的另一方法、還有什麽合作運動的提倡的必要呢、所以在此種情形之下、這「合作綱要一書、」又値得我來加以推薦的了　　著者華百討博士、是美國合作事業上著名的權威、他這書、又可以作爲美國合作運動的一部小史看、很能在此中找出合作社所具的眞義、同時也可作其它國家準備創辦這事業的参、助在這裏作者是將合作方法的營業和合作運動已有詳盡的描寫、對於合作的缺點和好處都有同樣的注意、所以這裏所謂合作是從消費者的立足點上討論、足供一般學者所研究的、當然、合作並非絕對是一種最好的營業方法、也不能說倘若它是好的、人們就應該採用它、不過將它的事實和可能性表現出來、並且拿它和别的方法比較、這也是極有意義的、</p>
<p>全書計分八章（一）現代狀况的批評（二）對於擬定救濟方法的批評、（三）合作的經濟學、（四）合作的社會方面和經濟方面、（五）實現的方法、（六）合作的缺點和困難、（七）合作的好處、（八）各種各樣的人這每章的記述、都具有正確的眼光、不偏不倚、這實是研究的眞正的態度、所有關於合作的事體、都以著者於現行合作方法的知識做根據、所以這書是很値得我們的重視的、</p>

<p>顧昂若譯</p>
<p>這意思的道德丨並且這是可以施行於各級司令的丨就是他的軍隊的狀况愈加不安和他面前的形勢愈加危急、任何司令官就愈加迫切的要拿他的百折不撓的勇氣力行他在戰事全局裏的他的一部的責任、他决不能讓他自己給他的一部分的不定和危險所影響、因爲全局的成功常常可使他們恢復原狀、反而言之、焦思竭慮設法使他的軍隊支持着渡過危急的時期是他的責任、我的管見以爲馬爾内之勝利已經完全證明此言不虚、現在再度應用的時機到了、</p>
<p>十月八日、前敵總指揮法蘭樞將軍在亞白未頁建立了司令部之後、來到杜龍看我、這是開戰以來我第一次遇着他、舊雨重逢十分快慰、我們相知有素、從前他在法國英國的時候待我很好、我們的關係常能開誠佈公、現在我們又在　大戰中風雨同舟了、</p>
<p>他帶來的消息中有一件是關於安得渥的投降、他問我德軍已做了比利士的主人、我們有何方法可以推翻他、我回答說我們現仍没有同比軍聯絡、並且我們的軍隊離開北海岸尙遠、照我的意思、這問題在我們是否能及時達到這兩個目的、現在假使我們不能包抄敵人的北翼、我們就應當用全力向這點去做、</p>
<p>我的老友亨利威爾遜爵士（後來就是前敵總指揮）是同約翰法蘭樞爵士在一起、我告訴他我很歡喜再遇見他、我並且同他說我深信英軍敏疾的有力的加入戰團完全是他以參謀長的資格妥爲佈置的效果、威爾遜將軍早已顯出他的愛國的警醒和遠大的卓見、後來在作戰的經歷上更加一層證明、</p>
<p>我個人並不見得一般的戰局有怎不好、並且我是很自信的、我曾經看見敵人在魯倫的失敗、我們又在馬爾内擊退他們、敵人現在很想在北面挽回他們局勢、但是我們也能維持我們的地位、他們想迅雷不及掩耳的一戰擊潰法軍的計劃已成泡影、俄軍的力量不久想可施展、况且我們的第二第十兩軍的戰績以及英軍的參戰證明我們北進的戰略很有希望、因此十月十日我寫信給總司令說、</p>
<p>將軍我以爲我們的情形很满意、克斯脫爾诺並不移動、瑪　正進攻亞拉斯、他的成功很遲緩不過仍在前進中、更北、我們的騎兵剛退回到勃西裴塞内綫、但是我並不以爲有何關係、因爲英國第二軍團今天中午就要到裴塞内和列勒斯的、並且英國騎兵團也要到愛爾和迦白克、尙有英軍今天開到聖渥美爾（我們的防區）及其近郊下車、在這狀况之下、德軍的進攻是無須恐懼的、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e3">Sino-American Loan Issues <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Lincoln Asks for Personnel to be Sent to England</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the American government's loan to China, Lincoln had a telegram to Nanjing yesterday requesting the National Government to send personnel to America immediately. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>According to financial circles in Nanjing, the Sino-American silver loan issue has been a topic of discussion for a long time. Through the efforts of Lincoln, the advisor to the National Government, the American side has no further objections to the loan. Lincoln specially dispatched his son, Mr. Lincoln Jr., to Nanjing the day before yesterday to contact the National Government and inquire about the specifics. If the National Government decides to borrow, then the contract will soon be established. As for the amount, it is heard that the National Government will change the huge sum of 100 million ounces to 300 million ounces. (18th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Lincoln announced today in Washington that he received a telegram from Hu Hanmin instructing him to negotiate with the American government for a silver loan of one trillion ounces, which is equivalent to approximately US$260 million at the current silver price. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>In Washington, the Associated Press representative recently met with Lincoln, who stated that the Nanjing government has selected two officials to come to the United States to jointly handle the silver loan of 100 million ounces. Negotiations will begin as soon as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approves the recommendations of the Pittman Silver Committee. Lincoln also showed the Associated Press representative a telegram from Nanjing in which Hu Hanmin agreed to the loan. However, the Chinese Embassy here has not yet received this news. According to general speculation, there is a clear disagreement in Nanjing regarding this matter and the nature of Lincoln's mission. Lincoln is currently staying here to handle the loan negotiations, but he is negotiating with silver mine owners and informal economic experts, or with Mr. Pittman, who represents silver-producing states in Congress. Lincoln stated today that the interest on this silver loan must be low and must not have collateral. If this is successful, it could greatly help the world silver market and alleviate the current economic depression. (19th National News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e35">The American Silver Coinage Proposal <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>America's silver devaluation policy for relief, in addition to lending silver to China, also includes a policy of using silver as a subsidiary coin. If this policy is indeed approved by various countries, it will be largely sufficient to achieve the effectiveness of the relief effort. According to today's National News Agency dispatch, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee has approved the Pittman proposal, requesting President Hoover to consult with other governments to stop the fall in silver prices, and requesting that, if necessary, an international conference be convened to agree on a method of using silver as a subsidiary coin. The Reuters dispatch also stated that the US Senate Finance Committee requested Hoover to negotiate with other countries to stop the policy of melting silver coins and selling silver on the world market, and requested that an international conference be convened to agree on a method of using silver as currency. These two dispatches certainly originate from a kind of publicity from the Washington side, but if the American government can advocate this, it is not without a few points of hope. Looking at the words of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday, he also agreed to an international conference. If Britain and the United States can work together to call for this international conference to save the silver devaluation, it is truly the first step. After the establishment of the conference, if they can sincerely cooperate to negotiate a standard for the gold and silver ratio and determine a common subsidiary coin, the benefits will be far superior to those of other empty words of relief. However, this matter still concerns the interests of gold-producing and silver-producing countries. It is extremely difficult to bring their opinions into agreement. This proposal is still feared to become a bubble.</p>

<h3 id="e51">New Spanish Cabinet Established <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Situation Remains Tense, Asnar Appointed Prime Minister</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, February 18th – Naval leader Asnar was appointed Prime Minister this morning, following a secret meeting of monarchist politicians at the Ministry of the Army. The meeting lasted for a considerable time, concluding only this morning, at which point it was announced that all those present had resolved to remain loyal to the King. They immediately sent representatives to the palace to report the outcome. Previously, reformist leader Alvárez had abandoned the idea of forming a cabinet because the King did not approve of his conditions. Spain currently has forty-five political parties, and the King is navigating them, handling the situation with skill from his established position. The failure of left-winger Guerla to form a revolutionary government further strengthens the King’s position. The Minister of the Army in the new cabinet is Berenguer, the former prime minister. The cabinet includes two non-partisans, two Liberals, and one Conservative and one Democrat each. Once formed, the new cabinet was sworn into office.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, February 19th – According to Asnar's comments today, the new Spanish cabinet intends to restore a normal constitutional government. When General Berenguer succeeded Rivera Ticke as Prime Minister, his policies were more lenient, preparing for future reforms. Asnar intends to continue this work. Municipal elections will be held after the general election, but before the convening of Parliament, which will be a constituent assembly tasked with revising the Constitution of 1876. However, constitutionalists have already decided not to participate in this election.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, February 18th – Admiral Asnar has formed a monarchist coalition cabinet and was sworn into office before the King. The cabinet list is as follows: Foreign Affairs, Román Lamberto (Liberal); Justice, the Marquis of Aconsimai (Democrat); Army, General Berenguer; Interior, the Marquis of Hoia (both non-partisans); Economy, the Count of Bugalere; Labor, the Duke of Maura; Public Works, La Xeval (all three Conservatives); Finance, Ventosa (Liberal). Immediately after taking office, the cabinet ordered the reinstatement of General Berenguer's previous orders to censor news, mail, and restrict constitutional freedoms, even intensifying them. The new cabinet represents the monarchists making a last stand against the republican movement. It is anticipated that their declaration will guarantee the convening of a constitutional revision conference, but only after holding municipal and provincial elections to control the constitutional conference. The opposition's attitude currently seems to be one of wait-and-see, but the situation is extremely tense, with the potential for a sudden eruption.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, February 16th – The King of Spain and the new Prime Minister, Admiral Asnar, traveled together in a car this afternoon to the Ministry of the Army to thank General Berenguer for his assistance in forming the cabinet. Admiral Riviera has been appointed as the Minister of the Navy and will be sworn in tomorrow. The first cabinet meeting is scheduled for Thursday, where they will draft a major policy declaration. The capital is currently calm on the surface, but the situation remains tense.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, February 18th – Following the Spanish censorship of news and mail, rumors are rampant in Hendaye, on the Franco-Spanish border. It is claimed that after the Asnar cabinet was formed, the labor unions decided to hold a national general strike, which will be implemented on Thursday. Strikes have already occurred in cities such as Saragossa, Valencia, and Granada, but Barcelona remains calm. There are also rumors that a major riot occurred in Madrid on Wednesday night, with crowds gathering in front of the royal palace, shouting "Down with the King!" They were dispersed only after a large cavalry patrol charged into the crowd, resulting in many injuries. However, this information is based on rumors and has not yet been verified.</p>

<p>To Negotiate Maintaining Silver Prices</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, February 18th – The Senate Finance Committee has approved a resolution requesting President Hoover to negotiate with other countries to halt the melting of silver coins and the sale of silver on the world market. The committee also proposes convening an international conference to discuss ways to use silver as currency.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, February 18th – Although the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has endorsed the Pittman Committee's recommendations, formal reporting to the President requires action by the full Senate. The current short session of Congress will be adjourned indefinitely on March 3rd, making it doubtful whether the Senate can pass a resolution requesting the President to convene an international silver conference within these few days. Otherwise, the matter must be re-proposed when the newly elected 72nd Congress convenes in December. As for silver loans, there are many opponents in America, and this type of dispute is unlikely to be resolved in a short time. Some say that even if President Hoover actually convenes an international conference in the future, it is doubtful whether it will discuss the proposal of related countries jointly providing silver loans to China.</p>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th – Now that the budget has passed, there are no major issues for the Seiyukai party to fight the government with in the House of Representatives. The Seiyukai fears that the opposition's fighting spirit will stagnate and is proceeding with a third-phase battle plan, focusing on the developments in the House of Peers and, at an appropriate opportunity, submitting a motion of no confidence in the cabinet to launch a comprehensive attack. When submitting the motion of no confidence, President Inukai will personally lead the charge, or Tokonami Takejiro will take the frontline, setting up a formation to denounce the government. Then, Horikiri Zenbei, Yamaguchi Giichi, Yamazaki Iwao, Uehara Etsujiro, and others will take to the podium to expose the government's misrule.</p>

<p>Kijūrō Shidehara and Junnosuke Inoue Attend to Report</p>
<p>Research Society Members Raise Questions</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th – The House of Peers convened its plenary session at 10:00 AM on the 19th. Speaker Tokugawa reported that the budget had been passed by the House of Representatives and transferred to the House of Peers. Prime Minister Shidehara, acting as an alternate, requested the floor. He first expressed his condolences to the House for the Prime Minister Hamaguchi's attack, then expressed his gratitude. Next, he stated that Prime Minister Hamaguchi could not personally attend the deliberation of the budget and other important bills, which was regrettable. However, if there were no further changes, the Prime Minister would be able to attend in early March. Then, the bill to amend the Leprosy Prevention Law was put on the agenda and passed according to the committee chairman's report. Subsequently, Finance Minister Inoue took to the podium, read his fiscal policy speech delivered in the House of Representatives, and reported on the passage of the budget by the House of Representatives. Finally, he said that in last year's special session of parliament, he had stated that the local budget for Showa 5 was 250 million yen less than that for Showa 4, which was an error. It was actually a contraction of 189 million yen, and he now solemnly corrected it, requesting understanding from all factions. Next, Mitsui Seiichiro of the Research Society took to the podium, saying that the content of the proposed budget was in complete contradiction with what the government had said previously, his words were extremely sharp. His questioning was not finished, and the meeting adjourned at 12:23 PM.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th – After the House of Representatives adjourned last night at 7:00 PM, the government held a cabinet meeting within the Diet building to discuss the strategy for the House of Peers. As a result, they determined that the issues of concern in the House of Peers were the same as in the House of Representatives, namely the financial and economic problems, the second supplementary plan, the Wushe Incident, unemployment, the Prime Minister's substitute, and rural issues. It was decided to fully disclose the government's beliefs on the above issues and seek their understanding. Matters related to the Imperial Household, such as replying to Imperial messages and presenting Imperial messages, were not to be the subject of discussion.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th – After the budget was passed by the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Shidehara, acting as an alternate, expressed his feelings, saying, "The budget has been passed, and I am very pleased. During the budget deliberation, the opinions of both the ruling and opposition parties have been fully expressed, and there are no regrets. This experience (referring to the slip of the tongue) was unpleasant, and there are not a few who sympathize with me, but I do not feel bitter."</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th – When the budget passed the House of Representatives, Finance Minister Inoue expressed his feelings, saying, "It is regrettable that I did not hear the Seiyukai's proposals on how to overcome the economic difficulties. The Seiyukai abstractly chants for active policies and protectionist policies, but does not know the current state of the financial world, which requires reorganization and austerity. It is natural for there to be some discrepancy in the estimation of revenue in these difficult times, which is an act of God."</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th – After the budget was passed by the House of Representatives, Seiyukai Secretary-General Mori said, "None of the government's promises in the budget have been fulfilled, especially starting with Prime Minister Shidehara's slip of the tongue, which exposed a mistake in the operation of constitutional government. The Seiyukai has done its duty as an opposition party in exposing the government's hypocrisy. The people, through the questioning battle between the ruling and opposition parties, should now understand how the government's misrule is threatening their lives. The time for the government to apologize to the world for the calamities it has sown is not far off."</p>

<h3 id="e63">Final Agreement on the Jin Situation <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander Telegraphically Approve Flexible Implementation</p>
<p>All Army and Division Commanders Convene a Plenary Meeting</p>
<p>Decide to Form a Joint Military Commission</p>
<p>Post-Settlement Association Questions Expansion of Troops</p>
<p>Taiyuan dispatch: The issue of the reduction of the Jin-Sui Army, which has been delayed until yesterday, has been completely resolved. The flexible implementation measures previously agreed upon by the generals, after consulting with Xu, Fu, Yang and others via joint telegram for instructions, received a reply telegram from Chiang and Zhang, which arrived on the afternoon of the previous day. The original text is as follows: "Urgent, to Fourth Army Commander Shang, Fifth Army Commander Xu, Sixth Army Commander Yang, Seventh Army Commander Fu, Taiyuan. Both of your telegrams received. The fact that you are considering the overall situation demonstrates your painstaking efforts. It is appropriate to temporarily accommodate and approve the proposed implementation. Besides informing Councilor Ji by telegram, please take note. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang [Official Seal]." The so-called flexible measures are roughly the following four points: (1) Sun Chu's unit will form a railway protection army, treated the same as other armies. (2) Rong Honglu will be the garrison commander, and Zhang Huizhao will be the deputy commander. The garrison army will consist of three regiments. (3) Li Fuying's unit will still be organized as a division, under Xu's control. (4) Zhao Chengshou will be the bandit suppression commander, and the cavalry will be organized into three brigades, commanded by Zhao.</p>
<p>In order to study the issues of the retention or abolition of the headquarters and the establishment of a military commission, Shang, Xu, Yang, and Fu, etc., specially convened a plenary meeting of division commanders and commanders at 2:00 PM yesterday in the conference hall of the headquarters. All attendees arrived on time. After Shang and Xu reported on the Chiang-Zhang reply telegram, they discussed the establishment of a military commission and the retention or abolition of the General Headquarters. The army commanders believed that the Jin side's military affairs agencies had a long history and that it would be much more convenient for Xu, Shang, Yang, Fu four army commanders, and Sun Chu, the railway protection army commander, to jointly form a military commission to carry out all matters. There was no need to form another army headquarters. Furthermore, Shang Zhen had previously expressed his willingness to give up the position of army commander for the convenience of the Jin army's operations, so it was planned that the five army commanders would quickly form a military commission to actively handle the post-settlement matters, which would also save a lot of money in terms of expenses. After the garrison headquarters is closed, the commission can replace it. However, some on the scene also advocated that after the headquarters closes at the end of February, a temporary military post-settlement winding-up office should be established, and the salaries of all headquarters staff should be suspended from March onwards. However, this proposal was not passed. The final decision was still for the five army commanders to jointly form a commission to handle all matters, and it was decided that Xu Yongchang, Shang Zhen, Yang Aiyuan, Fu Zuoyi, and Sun Chu would be responsible for planning everything and negotiating post-settlement matters. The army headquarters and the commission would be merged into one. The discussion concluded with the sounding of the six o'clock bell, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>The Shanxi Post-Settlement Promotion Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday and sent a letter to the division commanders questioning the reasons for the troop expansion. The text is as follows: "Respectfully, upon reading your two telegrams, the contents are greatly contradictory, which is truly bewildering. Upon reviewing the Qiao telegram, the Jin army will be reorganized into four armies, which is greatly different from the actual situation of the Jin army and extremely difficult to implement. Today, the army commander system still exists, and the separation of military and civilian affairs has not yet been realized, yet you gentlemen actually took office via a telegram on the Yu day. The prior and subsequent claims are so contradictory, what is the meaning of this? This is the first question. The Tianjin conference's proposal for four armies and eight divisions fails to satisfy the people's sentiments. The Qiao telegram stated that the Jin army would be reorganized into the national army, so that it would receive the same treatment as the central army. The discussion was broad and won the sympathy of the people. But suddenly, the previous proposal was changed, with some advocating for ten divisions, and others advocating for the addition of some kind of command outside of the Tianjin plan. It becomes more and more bizarre, and it is unclear what is going on. Now we even hear that there is an actual increase from eight divisions to eleven divisions, and the addition of railway protection, garrison, and bandit suppression commanders. Shanxi is at a time when the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, unable to sustain itself. You gentlemen do not advocate for reducing and retaining, but rather advocate for reducing and adding, what is your intention? This is the second question. The Tianjin conference proposal was incomplete, which is undeniable. However, Deputy Commander Zhang repeatedly mentioned Shanxi's finances in his letters and telegrams. You gentlemen disregard public opinion, disregard the people's wealth, and focus solely on the existence or non-existence of individual power, assuming that all the funds will be continuously provided by the central government? Or do you feel that Shanxi's financial resources can still bear the burden? Or is it that with your own power secure, the Shanxi post-settlement issue can be solved easily? This is the third question. Since the Yu telegram was issued, street discussions have been raging, and public sentiment has been boiling. Based on public opinion, our association asks these three questions, and we respectfully request that you gentlemen reply to each item by a certain date, so that our association can understand the situation and convey it to the people of the province. This is what we urgently hope for." (February 14)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Chang Bingyi's Remarks After Arriving in Taiyuan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Developing Industry, Focusing on Commercial Operation</p>
<p>Provincial Committee to Take Office First, Then Take Oath</p>
<p>Taiyuan dispatch: The Shanxi Provincial Government and various departments have been extremely busy preparing for the handover these past few days. All the newly appointed members have arrived in the province one after another, and they have telegraphed the central government to select and dispatch oath-supervising officials to Taiyuan as soon as possible. Because the oath-supervising officials dispatched by the central government have not yet arrived with certainty, it is currently planned to take office first and then take the oath afterwards. The reporter interviewed the newly appointed Director of the Department of Agriculture and Industry, Chang Bingyi, yesterday. (Question) How many people came with you this time? Have you met with Deputy Commander Zhang recently? (Answer) I only brought five or six secretaries and staff. After Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang, Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander, issued a clear order appointing me as the Director of the Shanxi Department of Agriculture and Mines, they ordered the Hebei Department of Agriculture and Mines to rush to complete the handover. Recently, after receiving a telegram from Chairman Shang, I went to Shenyang to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang to report on the conclusion of the Hebei Department of Agriculture and Mines. Zhang Jixin, the new director, originally wanted to come with me, but stopped due to illness. (Question) Did Deputy Commander Zhang mention the Jin side's reorganization plan to you? (Answer) This matter was not mentioned to me. However, according to what I have heard, Zhang has no preconceived notions about the Jin army's reduction issue, but only seeks a smooth reorganization. As for the Tianjin proposal, it is the result of many days of consultation between Chiang and Zhang, and they have their own considerable difficulties. It is unknown whether it can be changed. (Question) When will the new members of the provincial government take office? When will you go to the department to take up your new position? (Answer) The new members of the provincial government will wait for Director Chou (Yantian) to return from Shenyang before holding the inauguration. As for my taking up my new position in the Department of Agriculture and Mines, it should be after the provincial committee takes office. (Question) How will you develop Shanxi's agricultural and mining industries in the future? Have you stipulated a plan? (Answer) Shanxi is rich in minerals, with mountains inside and out, and can be unaffected by military affairs. However, the inconvenience of transportation hinders the development of mining. I was the head of agriculture and mines in Hebei for four months and deeply know that in the development of industrial institutions, commercial operation is better than official operation. The most unfavorable to the country and the people is Sino-foreign joint ventures, such as the Kailuan Mining Bureau in Hebei. The annual income is only enough for the expenses of the staff within the bureau. Although there are many reasons for this, the disadvantages of official operation are the greatest. In the future, Shanxi's mining industry will adopt a commercial operation system and protect the capital of merchants with laws, so the investment of the people must be enthusiastic. As he spoke, the reporter excused himself and left. (February 14)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Fourth Route Army Implements Downsizing <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Consisting of Six Divisions and One Zhang Ying Division</p>
<p>Monthly Reduction in Military Expenses of 245,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Fourth Route Army stationed in Hunan has historically drawn its military pay from Hunan Province's national tax revenue. Monthly expenses, including temporary and miscellaneous costs, amounted to approximately 1.2 million yuan. Since the repeated disturbances by bandits and communists, revenue has sharply declined, resulting in accumulated deficits of up to 4.5 million yuan. Recently, the abolition of the consolidated tax and the weakening of the provincial treasury have further strained finances, making it increasingly difficult to maintain operations. He Jian has thus implemented a strict austerity policy, issuing only 80% of all government expenses and also streamlining agencies and reducing redundant personnel. He is now determined to adopt a "consolidate the small into the large" and standardized organizational structure principle for his subordinate units. The existing two independent brigades, the Western Hunan Bandit Suppression Command, the Western Hunan First Guerrilla Command, the Column Command, the directly subordinate independent regiment of the Headquarters, and the three bandit suppression detachments will all be abolished. All officers and soldiers will be incorporated into the 15th Division (Wang Dongyuan Division), the 16th Division (Peng Weiren Division), the 31st Division (Tao Guang Division), and the 32nd Division (Chen Guangzhong Division), to comply with the six-regiment organizational structure per division (the 19th Division of Li Jue and the New 34th Division of Chen Quzhen already have six regiments). Those who cannot be accommodated will be incorporated into the county security brigades, with salaries borne by local authorities. This is estimated to reduce expenses by 245,000 yuan per month and is to be completed by the end of February. He has telegraphed General Commander Jiang for approval and has issued a clear order announcing the merger measures as follows: (1) The 9th Independent Brigade of Tong Kun and the directly subordinate independent regiment of Ye Wenke are to be merged into the New 32nd Division (Commander Chen Guangzhong) as the 3rd Brigade, with Tong Kun remaining as brigade commander. His troops will be organized into two regiments, with Wu Xiezhou and Xu Chuanshu remaining as regimental commanders. Regimental Commander Ye Wenke will be assigned to other duties. (2) He Ying's regiment of the 10th Independent Brigade is to be merged into the 16th Division (Commander Peng Weiren) as a training regiment, with He Ying remaining as regimental commander. (3) The special service battalion of Xiang Kequan's regiment of the 10th Independent Brigade, and the troops of Hong Benhan's guerrilla command, are to be merged into the New 31st Division (Commander Tao Guang) as the 3rd Brigade, with Wang Yuying, the commander of the 2nd Regiment of that division, being promoted to commander of the 3rd Brigade, with Hong Benhan as deputy brigade commander, and Xiang Kequan as regimental commander. (4) The Li Guojun column of the Western Hunan Bandit Suppression Command is to be merged into the 15th Division (Commander Wang Dongyuan) as the 44th Brigade, with Li Guojun acting as brigade commander. (5) Dai Douyuan, commander of the 10th Independent Brigade and concurrently commander of the Western Hunan Bandit Suppression Command, has served in the military for a long time and has demonstrated loyalty. He has been ordered to be transferred to the position of advisor to the General Headquarters and is to be relieved of his command duties. (6) The 1st Bandit Suppression Detachment of Guo Bugao directly under the Headquarters is to be merged with the regular troops of the Chaling Household-by-Household Corps into the Chaling Security Brigade, with Guo Bugao as brigade commander. (7) The 2nd Bandit Suppression Detachment of Zhu Xingshu directly under the Headquarters is to be reorganized into the Pingjiang Security Brigade, with Zhu Xingshu as brigade commander. (8) The 3rd Bandit Suppression Detachment of Qi Guangzhao directly under the Headquarters is to be incorporated into the 3rd Company of the 1st Guard Battalion, with Qi Guangzhao as company commander. (9) The Zhou Xieqing Brigade is to be returned to the establishment of the New 11th Division (Commander Zhang Ying), with Zhou Xieqing remaining as brigade commander. (10) All names such as the 9th and 10th Independent Brigades, the Western Hunan Bandit Suppression Command, the Column Command, the Guerrilla Command, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Bandit Suppression Detachments, and the Independent Regiment, etc., should be abolished. (11) Each division is allowed one special service battalion and each brigade one special service company. No other special service battalions or companies are allowed to be formed. (February 16)</p>

<p>Anhui Provincial Government Orders Yue Division to Defend and Suppress</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The communist bandits in Jiangxi Province are rampant, and the central government has repeatedly dispatched large armies to encircle and suppress them. They are already in a state of exhaustion. According to reliable information from Anqing, a group of more than 300 communist bandits in the Mopan Mountain area of Jiangxi Province, due to the strong encirclement and suppression by the central army, are planning to flee to the Dongliu area of Anhui Province. For precautionary measures, the Anhui Provincial Government has telegraphed the 57th Division of Yue Shengxuan to dispatch troops to intercept them as soon as possible. After receiving the order, Division Commander Yue, in addition to dispatching a detachment from Anqing to Dongliu to guard against them, also telegraphed the 171st Brigade of Wang Leshan, stationed in Wuhu, yesterday to quickly dispatch Xu Guoting's regiment to Guichi to encircle and attack. Brigade Commander Wang ordered the dispatch of the 3rd Battalion of Li Buyun's regiment of the Xu regiment today (18th), taking the Fengle River small steamer and towed civilian ships to Datong, along with a machine gun company. It is expected that they can transfer from Datong to Guichi tomorrow to engage in defense and suppression. (February 18)</p>

<p>Yushan Recovered by Xu Division</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since his arrival in Jiangxi, He Yingqin has been actively deploying bandit suppression efforts in the four provinces, hoping to completely resolve the communist bandit problem. As for the current situation of the bandit suppression units, the Jiang and Cai divisions of the 19th Route Army have completely arrived in Xingguo, the 6th Route Army is in Nanfeng and Nancheng, and the 9th Route Army is in the Ji'an and Yongfeng area. The units of Lu Xiaochen and Hu Zuyu are on the Yihuang and Le'an line. They are taking a defensive posture of encirclement and surveillance against the Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang bandits in Ningdu and Guangchang, waiting for the completion of the deployment of the entire line and the arrival of the main force of Sun Lianzhong before launching a general offensive. Therefore, there are only small contacts on the front line and no major battles. It is reported that He Yingqin's plan is to have Sun's 26th Route Army replace the 9th Route Army in the frontal position east of the Gan River, the 19th Route Army in the frontal position south of the Gan, and the 6th Route Army as the main force in eastern Gan. Xu Tingyao and Ruan Zhaochang are stationed in the northeast of Gan, responsible for clearing the Fang and Shao bandits. The Wang Jinyu unit is stationed in the northwest of Gan, carrying out the clearing of the Kong and Li bandits and the remnants of Peng and Huang in Xiutong, Pinglian, and Anfu.</p>
<p>The Fang and Shao bandits in eastern Gan, after being defeated by the Xu Tingyao and Ruan Zhaochang divisions, are fleeing everywhere. The bandits captured Yushan on the 8th, burning and killing at will. On the 9th, it was recovered by the Xu division. However, the communist bandits in the surrounding villages are still extremely rampant, organizing peasant associations, kidnapping for ransom. Li Guanglie and other representatives from the seven counties of Guangxin have specifically submitted a report to the headquarters, requesting that heavy troops be dispatched to clear them. After receiving the report, He has urgently telegraphed the 55th Division of Ruan Zhaochang, stationed in Leping, to advance and suppress them. (February 15)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: The bandit suppression conference convened by the Wuhan Headquarters held a preparatory meeting on the 15th, and it was decided to formally open the meeting on the 16th. Later, because Fan Shisheng, commander of the 51st Division, was blocked in Xiangyang, it was planned to come to Hankou by plane on the 17th to attend, so the conference was changed to the 18th. On this day, at 2:00 PM, the bandit suppression conference opened at the headquarters.

Regarding bandit suppression, such as improving methods and unifying orders, the headquarters ordered various troops to follow the plans of the general headquarters. Officers and soldiers who were wounded or killed in bandit suppression were to be given pensions in accordance with wartime compensation regulations, and the central government was requested to issue the pensions, which would be paid in advance by the provincial government. Regarding pacification, such as immediately implementing rural cleansing after bandit suppression and emphasizing propaganda work, the provincial party headquarters would formulate methods and hand them over to the county party headquarters for implementation. At the same time, special attention would be paid to the selection of county magistrates, and if any county magistrate failed to assist in bandit suppression, the garrisoned troops could report to the headquarters, which would transfer the matter to the provincial government for handling. A total of more than 30 items were decided on, and Zhu Chuanjing, Chen Guangzu, and Wang Zhenhuai, the three chiefs of staff, were temporarily appointed to be responsible for sorting them out. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. According to a certain important person attending the meeting, this meeting has a significant relationship with bandit suppression in the future. In addition to the plans for various aspects in western and northern Hubei, special attention is paid to the border areas of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. It has now been decided that Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, Fan Xiji, Fan Shisheng, and Xia Douyin will be responsible for the task. They will be mobilized together within a few days to clear the remaining bandits in the shortest possible time. (February 18)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Recent News on Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations in the Northeast <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since Zhang Xueliang left Shenyang on January 18th, Kimura, the director of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), immediately followed him to negotiate the Sino-Japanese railway issue in the Northeast. Initially, there were four proposed items: (1) the parallel line problem, (2) the Jihui Railway problem, (3) the conversion of the arrears of construction costs for the Tao'an-Ang'angxi and Jilin-Dunhua Railways into loans, and (4) the cessation of freight competition and the establishment of freight rate agreements. Northeasterners have been paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese railway negotiations, especially the Jihui Railway problem. Kimura's arrival has been very active, and Japanese newspapers have followed suit, exaggerating the situation, causing suspicion and anxiety among the people of Shenyang. However, in recent days, the actual situation has not been as tense as reported. According to a well-informed Japanese source, the SMR does not intend to raise the first and second items and only wishes to resolve the third and fourth items. However, this is the predetermined step of the Japanese side, not a temporary change. Foreign Minister Shidehara's diplomacy toward China is deeply wary of provoking ill will. He wants to seek appropriate solutions to all problems in a stable manner. The railway negotiations also follow this spirit. The difficulty in winning Chinese sympathy for the Jihui Railway is well known, and the parallel line problem has become a thing of the past. At a time when Sino-Japanese relations have not yet fully recovered, it was not certain in advance that negotiations would be proposed. After Kimura met with Zhang Xueliang, Zhang also stated that it was beyond his authority and he could not intervene. For the sake of avoiding difficulties, the Japanese side only raised the third and fourth items. It is expected that the outcome of the negotiations can be resolved. At the same time, it is also reported that the Chinese authorities also believe that this negotiation is not unfavorable. The issue of converting the arrears of construction costs for the Tao'an-Ang'angxi and Jilin-Dunhua Railways into loans can be considered acceptable if the interest rate is low and the conditions are slightly modified. The issue of freight rate agreements is also not opposed in principle. However, due to the different gold and silver standards and other factors, concrete measures still need to be carefully considered. Currently, Kimura is in Shenyang, running around, visiting banquets, and has no spare time. The Chinese authorities also seem to be drafting countermeasures to prepare for formal discussions. This is the general situation of the railway negotiations in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The railway negotiations were initiated by the Japanese side, needless to say. Last autumn, Japanese military personnel and politicians in the opposition jointly created an atmosphere, saying that China was carrying out a railway encirclement policy and that it would expel Japanese forces from the Northeast. This was especially prevalent during Zhang Xueliang's visit to Beijing. The only excuse was the reduced revenue of the SMR. Regardless of whether the main reason for the SMR's reduced revenue was the general economic downturn in the world, it can be known that it was not caused by the railway encirclement policy by comparing it with the income of Chinese railways. According to the Northeast Transportation Committee, the income of the nine railways in the Northeast in 1919, including the Beining, Shenhai, Siping-Taonan, Hulan-Hailun, Jilin-Hailun, Taonan-Ang'angxi, and Qiqihar-Kezuo Railways, was only more than 64.48 million yuan in silver dollars. However, the income of the SMR is amazing. 1918 was its golden age, with a total income of more than 240 million yen and a net profit of more than 45.5 million yen. Although the income in 1919 was relatively weak, as of January 29th, the road transport revenue alone reached more than 73.64 million yen. According to Japanese estimates, the road transport revenue for the whole year is about 90 million yen, a decrease of 25.1 million yen compared with 1918. However, recently, soybeans and other agricultural products have gradually become prosperous. The freight transport along the Jilin-Changchun and Jilin-Dunhua lines is mostly absorbed by the SMR. Due to the high price of gold, soybeans and other goods from the western line of the Eastern Railway are unwilling to go east through the Eastern Railway and instead go south through the Taonan-Ang'angxi line, passing through the SMR to Dalian for export. Therefore, the income of the SMR has now increased. The road transport revenue on the 4th of this month once reached more than 400,000 yen. Therefore, the total income for this year should not be less than about 200 million yen, which is vastly different from the total annual income of the nine railways in China. Therefore, the issue of freight rate agreements must be given careful consideration. As for the arrears of construction and repair costs of the Taonan-Ang'angxi and Jilin-Dunhua Railways, which are now to be converted into loans, regardless of the low interest rate and whether the conditions are harsh or not, they are of great importance to sovereignty and must be carefully handled.

<p>County Party Rectification Committee Requests Punishment of Hengyi Steamer and Taili Company: After the Hengyi steamer accident, the County Party Rectification Committee believes that the company's steamer arbitrarily overloaded and had no restrictions, resulting in its sinking and the tragic death of more than 30 passengers, which is truly deserved. The committee cannot ignore the subsequent responsibility and future restrictions on steamer loading. It was proposed for discussion at yesterday's 92nd committee meeting, and it was unanimously agreed that the steamer should be held responsible and that the county government should be requested by letter to strictly handle the matter.</p>
<p>Poor Students Exempted from Construction Fees: Previously, due to the lack of school buildings in county schools, it was planned to add new school buildings. The principals' meeting decided to charge each student an annual construction fee of one yuan, regardless of whether they were poor students. Yesterday, an instruction was received from the Education Department stating that the collection of construction fees along with tuition fees was originally a last resort, but poor students should be exempted from the fees to show compassion.</p>
<p>Summary of Resolutions of the County Party Rectification Committee: The County Party Affairs Rectification Committee held its 92nd committee meeting yesterday and resolved the following: (1) Zhang Shou Zeng and other citizens reported that Zhou Zai Shi, a policeman of the Provincial Committee, was prostituting himself and committing adultery, which polluted the official morality. It was requested that he be impeached and severely punished to warn against official corruption. The resolution was that the case had already been reported to the Provincial Committee, but no reply had been received. Permission was granted to resubmit the report. (2) The New World Hotel harbors dirt and filth and does everything it can. The county government should be requested by letter to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter to rectify social customs. The resolution was passed. (3) The Taili Steamer Company arbitrarily overloaded and had no restrictions, resulting in its sinking and the drowning of more than a dozen passengers. The committee cannot ignore the subsequent responsibility and future restrictions on steamer loading. What should the committee do to express its opinion on this case? The resolution was to send a letter to the county government requesting them to be responsible for handling the matter.</p>

<p>Party and Government Organs Order Stores to Open: Merchants here are accustomed to closing their stores for several days during the abolished Lunar New Year. This year, they are still following the old practice of closing their stores on the 17th. Shen Zuguang, the propaganda minister of the county party department, went to the county government and met with County Magistrate Tan. As a result, the county party department, together with the section chief of the county government, Jin Mingjun, the director of the public security bureau, Director Wang, Chief Inspector Lu, and the stationed patrol officers, went to the front of the shops and other places to order the stores to open. As a result, all of them closed their doors because the Bank of China was still closed for business. The party and government personnel had no choice but to return. As for the schools, classes were still held as usual, but very few students attended. The Education Bureau sent special commissioners to the schools to check on attendance. The trial time set by the county government was for seven cases today, but only two cases were reported by the parties concerned, and the rest requested postponement. The steamers traveling to various ports, except for the Shanghai night class steamer, continued to operate as usual. However, due to the small number of passengers, the steamers were all operated with reduced capacity.</p>

They were taken back to Cheng and interrogated by the county government several times. Zhu Awu cunningly refused to confess, while Xie Peizhi confessed to kidnapping Chen Chunrong and others. Xu Yourong confessed that he and the bandit leader Yang Yaoda colluded to gather a crowd to participate in the Makou riot. The county government believed that Zhu Awu and others had repeatedly committed crimes such as robbery, murder, and prison break, and should be severely punished to maintain local peace. It then telegraphed the province for instructions. Yesterday (17th), a telegram was received authorizing the death penalty.

<p>During this year's abolished lunar New Year, the county party headquarters, sincerely fearing that citizens still harbor various old habits, carefully publicized in advance, hoping to arouse public attention. However, on this day (the seventeenth), all agencies and schools worked and attended classes as usual. Although no sounds of gongs and drums or firecrackers were heard within the city, businesses did not open due to the hardship of closing accounts. Peach wood charms and spring couplets were still seen everywhere. Children's clothes, colorful and vibrant, were quite common. The number of lawsuits received by the court was very small, but ordinary villagers still felt unusually busy.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of raising and distributing education funds: The Jiangdu education sector had previously launched strikes to demand back pay. The provincial government and education department repeatedly ordered the county bureau to raise three months' worth of funds within the abolished lunar year, which, together with temporary expenses, required more than 55,000 yuan to cover. Subsequently, under the supervision of County Magistrate Chen, the finance and education bureaus strictly limited each counter, and the principals of various schools in the urban area went out to borrow money separately. The education bureau also made every effort to raise funds, and it was not until 12 o'clock on Lunar New Year's Eve that the fundraising was completed. A total of three months for the urban area, two and a half months for the rural area, plus 3,000 yuan for temporary expenses, were finally settled.</p>
<p>The head of the business tax bureau has been appointed: Ding Buzhou has now been appointed by the provincial department to serve as the head of the Jiangdu County Business Tax Collection Bureau.

He initially demanded a registration fee of two cents, and then refused to be hospitalized, which angered the soldier. Soon, more than ten soldiers beat the person registering the patient and left. However, Mao Ba happened to be away from the hospital at that time. The soldiers said that Mao usually extorted money from patients, and they all said that it would not be satisfying not to beat the owner. So they went a second time to look for him and slapped Mao several times before leaving. At about 11 o'clock, more than ten soldiers rushed into the hospital again, grabbed Mao, and beat him severely. They also smashed several medicine bottles in the dispensing room. Finally, they took his sedan chair and smashed it in the street. Later, the quartermaster came and dispersed them.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Financial Market Opening Plummets <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Wild Plunge of 24 Taels</p>
<p>Extremely Strong Fluctuations: The Gold Exchange opened as usual yesterday, February 19th. The gold price rose and fell, but there were still violent changes like a hurricane and a rainstorm. The dangerous situation was irrepressible, and people were terrified. The price fluctuated by as much as 30 taels throughout the day, with a total plummet of more than 20 taels. Opinions among the industry varied, but the confusion was inevitable. Companies like Hengxing, Yuanfu, Chang, and a certain Lu bought and sold repeatedly. Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Taiyuan, and Shengyuan all bought in. Zhifeng, Yongheng, Xinghongli, etc., mostly sold out. The exchange rates on the foreign exchange market shrank by half, while the domestic market improved, creating a stark contrast. As for the overseas silver market, it shrank and then rose, causing the gold price to open low. Later, due to purchases by large investors and tight exchange rates, it rose rapidly and reached the 800-tael mark. Then, a new record of 99 taels was discovered. Later, speculators like a certain Lu suddenly sold off, causing the exchange rate to weaken. Furthermore, with the possibility of the establishment of a Sino-American silver coin loan, general sentiment was stimulated and a storm broke out. The rapid retreat caused a massive drop of more than 20 taels, with a sense of complete collapse. In the after-hours market, Yuanmao, Yong, Zhifengyong, etc., bought in, while Yuanheng, Hongli, and Yuantai sold. The situation remained confusing, with fluctuations of seven to eight taels at times. It once broke the 70-tael mark, and the final count was 72-73 taels. It is said that the large orders this morning may continue to rise.</p>
<p>Once a High Price Was Discovered: The opening price for April in the morning fell by 4 taels and 5 qian to 791 taels. This was because the total number of taels in the past three days was only one-sixteenth lower. The silver price was balanced, and the European market was strong. Private telegrams also increased by one-fourth. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of more than 4 taels, from 92 and a half taels to 88 taels. Then, sellers became active, and Fuchang, Hengyu, and others bought in, jumping by 8 taels and adding up to 96 taels. Exchange rates also rose, with British banks eating one penny eight one two five each for March and May-June. Then Hengxing sold, slightly reducing it by more than 2 taels. First, an announcement was made that a small one two five had been posted. The US dollar on the 25th, with gold adding one and a half points, was 95 taels and 5 qian at that time. Suddenly, it fell back to 3 and a half taels. In an instant, buyers surpassed Heng, and Dadetai, Hengxing, and Yuan competed to buy. Moreover, British gold banks traded 1175 with each other, and Datong ate 27.9375 US dollars in March, suddenly rising by more than 5 taels. At 9:30, it was a new high of 99 taels. In the blink of an eye, the air on the market was bad. It was rumored that the Sino-American loan could be established, so the price of gold should be viewed as small. In short, the minds of general speculators were different, caused by the rush selling of Hengxing, Changsheng Yong, Hengyu, Zhifengyong, etc., and Hengxingyuan suddenly sold out as well, so the price suddenly turned downwards, plummeting by more than 10 taels to 80 taels at 10:30. Then more than 3 taels were added, and then Yongfeng, Fuyu, Chenfeng, Yongshunli, and Wanxing tended to throw everything away and the storm broke out. After that, it had fallen miserably outside of 10 taels. British gold banks were trading at two pennies and one eight seven five in June, and the US dollar at 28.6875 until 11:20, when it suddenly became 70 taels and 5 qian. However, there were highs and lows of three or four taels in between. The market situation was chaotic and unspeakable. Yuanmao, Yongdadetai, Chengshunli, Wanxing, and Hengxingyuan repurchased, so the price pulled up seven or eight taels to 78 and a half taels. The market closed at noon at 75 taels, then decreased to 72 taels and a little. The price has been changed to 863 taels and 4 qian, a drop of 70 taels to 92 or 3 taels. Noon closed at 89 taels.</p>
<p>The Aftermarket Is Extremely Chaotic: The after-hours market opened at 72 and a half taels, then fell from 74 taels and 5 qian to 72 taels. Because the Indian exchange rate rose, and there were still many sellers in the market, only Yuanmao Yong and others still refused to stop, and they immediately raised it to 75 taels. Suddenly, items were sold from hedging, and in April, the British gold bank used two pennies and one eight seven five to trade, suddenly cutting down five or six taels, and suddenly at 2:20 it was 69 and a half taels. Afterwards, Yu Da Yuanmao, Yongzhifengyong came in. At 2:45 it was 77 taels, and the same Taichang Hengyu and others sold out. At 3:00 it was 70 taels and 3 then. Afterwards, the rise and fall were uncertain, with a cycle of more than 4 taels. After 2:30, buyers seemed to be numerous. Mitsui ate British gold one two five each in May, so they rose again by 7 taels. After 4:00 it was 77 taels and 5 qian. In a moment, the sellers became strong. Yuanheng and Hengxing sold out, and the British gold bank bought in needing two pennies and one eight seven five, so it fell again by more than 6 taels. By 4:30 the market closed at 71 taels, a fall of 24 taels and 5 qian compared to before the holiday (16th), and a heavy trade of 2 taels. But there were no large deals on the market. It was found that the maximum price during the day was 99 taels, and the minimum price was 69 and a half taels, a difference of 29 taels and 5 qian. The early market price of goods was 87 taels, the noon price was 72 taels, the late afternoon price was 72 and a half taels, and the market closed at 71 taels. The price is estimated to be 90 taels, and the market closed at more than 92 taels. Accounts for February at 65 taels, March at 68 taels, April at 75 taels, and water compensation at 65 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions Had No Direction: Transactions among industry members were stable and cumbersome. Yuanmao Yong Dadetai Yuantai Yuancheng and Tongtaichang all bought in. Wanxing Fuchang and Hengxingyuan bought in and sold out. Futaiheng Zhaokang Zhenchangxiang and Fuyu had unequal ins and outs. Hengxing Zhifengyong Hongli and Yuanheng sold more, about 4,500 orders in total. Changsheng Yong and Yuda went in and out first, about 3,000 orders. Goods went in and out erratically. In the afternoon, Yuanmao Yong Dafengyong and Yuda bought in. Hongli Yuantai and Hengxing sold out. Shunli Futaiheng Wanxing Fuyu sometimes went in and out. The big Dalian gang had a total of more than 3,000 orders in and out. The Pingguang gang sold about 1,000 orders.</p>

<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets both reported rising prices, the European market was hard, buyers were not uncommon, and British and American exchange rates rose slightly. However, the HSBC exchange rate in Shanghai shrank by half a grade, and most settlements were made. British gold shrank one two five to one shilling one penny six two five. US dollars twenty-five counted twenty-seven yuan and a half. Indian exchange rates were half a yuan and counted seventy-six robies and a half.

The gold market turned from high to low, and the storm was extremely great. The price changed by about 30 taels throughout the day. It once rose to a new high of 799 taels, and then fell back miserably by more than 20 taels, suddenly breaking the 70-tael mark, making it impossible to grasp, resulting in the loosening of the exchange rate in the end. It is truly a different trend of tight control and hidden looseness. By the close, compared to the 16th, British gold rose three one two five, US dollars rose six two five, and Japanese gold fell three and a half. The market was full of conflicting news, and it was rumored that Sino-American loans could be established, fearing that the price could rise, so people were flustered. However, this is just the confusion of the air. Chinese gold companies such as Zhong Fuchang and Xinhang all sold out, and occasionally hedged gold. The total volume of transactions in British gold was about more than 300,000. Banks had good appetites. Mitsui Zhengjin Sumitomo Anda, Denxing Huabi, and Korea all deposited in. Also, Mumbai had already made electronic purchases, and the interbank trades totaled about tens of thousands of pounds, and one to two million US dollars. Chinese merchants slightly withdrew. There were few transactions in Japanese gold, and only the Dalian Market made some settlements.</p>
<p>The intraday price of British exchange fluctuated by four three seven five.

<h3 id="e85">Silver Money Industry Only Does the Morning Market <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The market situation is very simple and commercial habits are unbreakable. At the beginning of this abolished lunar year, it still maintains its New Year status and shows no sign of change. The copper coin industry started business yesterday, and its market situation is very simple. Only the morning market is open every day. The afternoon market will be held from March 10th. During the 20 days without a noon market, the calmness of the market can be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Foreign Cent is Changed to Small Silver Folding White Loan (Foreign Cent) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The cent price at the beginning of the morning market was seven qian two fen two li two hao, which was half to seven hao and a half smaller than the market price at noon on Monday of this week (that is, Lunar New Year's Eve). However, in previous years there was a red disk market. Now that the old customs have been abolished, this red disk is also an example of abolition, so there is no market price (silver exchange). The morning market still opens a white loan to draw a head and add water. Because most money changers do not trade with banks, there is no water to add.</p>
<p>The Market Situation of Subsidiary Coins is Gradually On Track: The early market of Jiangnan small ocean was six qian seven fen five li, which was one fen better than Monday. The early market of Guangdong small ocean was six qian six fen three li, which fell one fen seven li compared to the noon market on Monday. There is no trading in the noon market as usual, and there is no market price for trading. Jiangjiao has 3,500 jiao, Guangjiao has 105,000 jiao, and silver dollars have suddenly increased by 28,000 wen to 375,000 wen, so the exchange rate on the market is about 2,700 wen.</p>
<p>There Are Few Silver Dollars Going In and Out (Silver Funds)</p>
<p>Although the bank’s receipt and deposit news operates as usual, at the abolished Lunar New Year, receipts and deposits are rare. It is only heard that HSBC received 400,000, customs duties of tens of thousands, and foreign receipts and deposits of more than 300,000. Coin shops and silver offices received and deposited about 5 million, and receipt and deposit of draw fees was more than 2 million. (Foreign funds) HSBC drew and ticked funds of 1,092,000 in the early market, banknotes of 87,000, outside the market banknotes of 145,000. There is no market in the noon market and no trading. Interbank market is 300,000 to 400,000, coin shops Foreign ticket receipts and deposits are one to two million, and foreign draw and tick receipts and deposits are tens of thousands. Transactions in small coin shops are more than 300,000.</p>

<p>Commodity Prices Rising Step by Step, Industry Peers Profiting Greatly</p>
<p>Last year's cloth and head market rose step by step. Whether it was Eastern goods or Western goods, cotton cloth rose sharply. At the end of the year, it jumped a thousand feet. The reason is that the price of gold skyrocketed and the price of silver plummeted. Compared with the spring and winter prices, they are all higher by one-third. The lowest opening price of Eastern goods' Shuangtonglu Zhigong was two qian two fen seven li and a half, Huxinting Biji was two qian two fen and a half, the first Gong Zhigong satin was two qian five fen, and the old flower Zhigong ne was two qian eight fen. The Western goods' Fangli Zhigong ne was two qian two fen, and the striped banling was one qian eight fen. Before the end, Shuangtong business had reached three qian six fen and a half, Huxinting three qian five fen, and the first Gong three qian seven fen. Fangli Zhigong ne was sold out at one qian one fen, and later had to open three qian five fen. The striped banling was three qian to two qian seven fen. During the year, the lowest price of Rengou plain crepe was two taels eight qian and a half, and the highest price was four taels two qian and a half. The lowest price of colored cloth was six qian and a half, and the highest price was nine taels two qian and a half. The difference was huge and unprecedented. Wool silk cloth, red ocean mark, white ocean yarn, and yuan ocean were all priced at record highs. Among the cotton cloths, fine cloth and fine slanting fabrics both reached one tael or more. Coarse cloth and coarse slanting fabrics were six to seven qian. The surplus among industry peers was also the crown of the year. For example, the newly created Xiehe Shentongfeng and others had surpluses of 50,000 to 60,000, and Hongshengyuan Xiexiang Zhaotai and others made even greater profits. The rest were 10,000 to 20,000. The ones that closed down were Meihua, Sheng Fuyuanxiang, and there were very few losses. Only the daily additions were average. In the area of Xiaodongmen, no one failed to profit.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Securities Exchange Yesterday Opened the Market <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Bond Price Rose Slightly, Transaction Volume 3.8 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local Chinese Securities Exchange started trading. However, because the Lunar New Year was still in progress, and the guest helpers had not arrived yet, the market was not deserted in the two morning sessions. Although the exchange opened as usual in the afternoon, most brokers did not come, so there were almost no transactions in various bonds. It is estimated that the previous day's futures trading volume was a total of 313,000 yuan, including 1.9 million for troop reduction, 890,000 for customs, 500,000 for the 20th-year rolled tobacco, and 500,000 for post-settlement incorporation. There were also 300,000 in customs duties. The other transactions were very small. Spot trading was rare, with only 9,000 yuan of bonds traded throughout the day. The bond market was calm, and the supply and demand were relatively balanced, so the bond prices also changed little. Compared with last week, the prices were slightly higher, but the increase was very small. Only the spot prices of post-settlement and 20th-year rolled tobacco bonds rose quite high due to the lack of trading for a long time.</p>

<p>Before the Account Closing Period, Various Ports Transported to Shanghai Were Not Weak</p>
<p>Due to the uncertain fluctuations in the exchange rate in the local foreign merchant raw silk end market, European sales were not smooth, and the production of Sichuan, Lu, Wan, E, Zhejiang, and Jiangbei and other places last year was not abundant, and the Shanghai inventory was not sufficient. Before the account closing period, various silk end merchants actively settled the futures contracts that they had thrown to various foreign firms in order to meet their financial needs, and they also telegraphed the production areas of Sichuan, Lu, and E, instructing them to transport their inventories to Shanghai. It is estimated that there are more than 2,800 pieces, so the Shanghai machine silk end inventory has increased by more than one time before the account closing period.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Protests Against Opium Public Sale from All Circles <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Joint Meeting</p>
<p>The Anti-Opium Association of the Republic of China and various national anti-opium organizations regard the rumored public sale of opium as extremely important, concerning the future of China's opium prohibition and international credibility. They specifically held a joint meeting of all sectors at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Over two hundred representatives from various organizations and individuals attended. Wang Jingqi, Zhou Hanmei, Huang Jiahui, and Li Denghui served as the presidium. The details of the general meeting are as follows: (A) Dr. Tang Shaochuan's proposal: Huang Jiahui reported that Dr. Tang Shaochuan was unable to attend the meeting as scheduled due to a hernia that has been troubling him, preventing him from sitting or standing, and expressed his apologies. He presented his opinions on Dr. Tang Shaochuan's behalf as follows: During the opium prohibition in the late Qing dynasty, I initially advocated strict measures, leading to the signing of the Sino-British Opium Prohibition Treaty, aiming to completely eradicate opium within ten years. Today, the opium scourge is rampant, and prohibition orders are ineffective. All our people should rise up together to petition the government, requesting strict opium prohibition. I believe the government should implement more opium addiction treatment hospitals and issue an order requiring opium addicts to confess their addiction to the government. The government should then mandate admission to hospitals for detoxification within a specified period. During the detoxification period, they should be deprived of their civil rights and required to display "addict" signs to distinguish them. Those who are addicted but do not register for detoxification should be punished. The government should provide the cost of detoxification medicine, while food expenses should be self-supplied. This is the fundamental method for opium prohibition. I hope various organizations will petition the government separately. As for the opium public sale, I believe it will not be realized because the current officials will not adopt such a policy. (B) Dr. Wang Jingqi's proposal: The key points of protesting against the opium public sale are as follows: The opium public sale violates the public's opinion and the late Premier's teachings. Although it is still a rumor, we should jointly protest in advance, considering the importance of the matter, so that everyone knows the public opinion and is not misled by those who promote public sale. On the one hand, we hope that the rumor is inaccurate, but at the same time, we should strive to support the central government's current prohibition policy. In recent years, opium prohibition has been lax, which is undeniable. Now that the internal wars are being quelled, it is time to strictly enforce prohibition. Our fundamental method of protesting against the public sale is to urge and assist in the implementation of the prohibition policy, and to do our best to promote the spirit of the late Premier's anti-drug teachings, so as to avoid the opium prohibition being nominal and providing an excuse for those who advocate public sale. We must understand that this movement is not a matter of opposing people, but of supporting the government's implementation of the opium prohibition policy. It is not a factional dispute, but a dispute of principles. We are fighting to eliminate the opium scourge and preserve the race. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will identify the goal, hold firm to the principles, not be intimidated by power, not be tempted by profit, and move forward bravely to protest to the end. We will surely win the final victory. (C) Resolutions of important cases: (1) Telegraph to the national public, unanimously protesting against the opium public sale; (2) Form a committee to protest against the opium public sale; (3) Various organizations petition the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government separately; (4) Various organizations petition the Legislative Yuan separately to enact laws and regulations to permanently prohibit public sale; (5) Request the Municipal Party Headquarters to publicize and prevent public sale based on the late Premier's teachings; (6) Promote a national campaign to promote opium prohibition; (7) Seek famous figures and important party and state officials to publish articles against public sale; (8) Request the Municipal Party Headquarters to convene a citizens' meeting to express the public's opposition to public sale; (9) Petition the Control Yuan to exercise its supervisory power based on the late Premier's teachings; (10) Petition the government to announce that it will never publicly sell opium; (11) Contact anti-opium branches and public organizations in various provinces to support each other and request the government to stop public sale; (12) Request the press to vigorously publicize and publish special anti-drug issues to expand publicity; (13) Petition the National Government to abolish the special taxes in Hunan and Hubei. (D) The original text of the telegram, immediately drafted as follows: To all national organizations and newspapers, opium public sale is a policy of weakening the country and harming the people. The late Premier had already condemned it and his teachings are clear. The public believes that it is an unchangeable principle. The National Government had previously issued a clear order to abolish it and adopted a plan for complete prohibition. The Kuomintang's program and opium prohibition laws all have concrete provisions. In recent years, opium prohibition has been lax, which is undeniable. Now that the political training has begun, efforts should be made. The Fourth Plenary Session has already resolved to strictly enforce opium prohibition. All nationals are eagerly hoping for the early elimination of the opium scourge. Unexpectedly, rumors of adopting opium public sale have been circulating recently. The rumors are vivid and raise unnecessary suspicions, such as sending personnel to Taiwan to investigate public sale methods. These rumors increase public anxiety. Our association and others feel the danger and cannot remain silent. Therefore, on February 19th, we held a joint meeting in Shanghai and resolved to jointly petition the government to stop the public sale policy. In addition, we hereby inform the national public to unanimously express their disapproval attitude, respect the late Premier's teachings, refuse to surrender to opium, and vigorously support the complete prohibition policy. We urge local authorities to strictly enforce opium prohibition, so as to clear the drug scourge and reassure the people. We hereby telegraph this message and wish you good health. The joint meeting of Shanghai organizations protesting against opium public sale bows and seals.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Postal Workers' Demands Yesterday's News <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations Come to an End</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, due to financial difficulties, demanded that the postal authorities provide postal workers with a universal housing allowance of ten yuan. Qian Chunqi, the Director-General of Posts, went to Beijing with Yu Feipeng, the Vice Minister of Communications, and Dou Juecang, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, to Shanghai to convene representatives of the Postal Joint Workers' Union and the Postal Workers' Union for negotiations. It has been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that after several negotiations between the two parties in the past two days, the issue has come to an end yesterday. The results agreed upon by both parties have been submitted to Wang Boqun, the Minister of Communications, for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>This newspaper received a telegram from Beijing yesterday stating that Wang Boqun spoke about Shanghai postal workers' demands for housing allowance and universal promotion. Considering only Shanghai, there are 2,800 postal workers, requiring tens of thousands of yuan per month, and 300,000 yuan per year. As for the promotion, the amount is even greater when calculated nationwide. In 1929, the total postal deficit will be nearly 1.1 million yuan. Savings deposits are very profitable, and remittances have a surplus, but they are not universal in remote areas. If this request is accepted, the postal service will be greatly affected, and even bankruptcy is possible. Moreover, the Ministry's budget has been approved by the Central Government, and it is impossible to arbitrarily increase it, which would affect the established financial policy. Furthermore, postal workers' salaries are already more generous than those of workers in other state-owned enterprises and private industrial and commercial enterprises. If they are allowed to demand more, it will cause social injustice. According to reports from various parties, the postal workers' actions are inevitably instigated by others for other purposes. Therefore, the Ministry has specifically sent Vice Minister Yu and others to Shanghai to investigate the truth and handle it accordingly, in order to prevent unfortunate incidents.</p>

<p>Result of Deng Zhende's Active Prevention</p>
<p>Meningitis, an acute infectious disease, was previously discovered in Haining and other places near the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. For a time, the epidemic was rampant and there was a danger of it spreading to Shanghai. Deng Zhende, the General Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, believed that railway vehicles and the large number of passengers were most susceptible to infection. He previously went to Hangzhou with Liu Ruiheng, the Director of the Department of Health of the Ministry of Interior, to discuss several epidemic prevention measures with the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. Strict precautions were taken at all stations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and passengers were inspected and treated at epidemic stations. Since the prevention and treatment, the epidemic has been greatly reduced, and there is no fear of further spread. However, he is still ordering intensified work to eradicate it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Sino-Japanese telecommunications case, which has been under negotiation for a long time, has been completed with the Qingzuo Line.

The ship has now arrived in Hong Kong and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd. After the aircraft arrives in Shanghai, it will not accept mail or sell tickets for the time being. It will first conduct a test flight to Manchuria once, because the Beijing, Jinan, Tianjin, and Pingjing airports are not a problem, while the stations in Rehe and Duolun are still under preparation, so a test flight must be conducted first.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Difficult Birth of the Chinese Director-General of the Public Works Department <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Board of Directors Still Did Not Pass the Name Issue Yesterday</p>
<p>The issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Works Department hiring Chinese people as commercial-level administrative staff has been delayed for two months. Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Council held a board meeting, attended by all Chinese and foreign directors. From 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM, the meeting adjourned. The special committee had submitted the issue of the Chinese Director-General for discussion, but the name issue has not been resolved for a long time. The Chinese Director-General of the Public Works Department has become a difficult birth. On the issue, the Chinese directors argued that under the Director-General, there should be two secretaries, one of whom should be a British person, and the other should be a newly hired Chinese person. The British directors believed that the motivation for the Public Works Department to hire a Chinese person as a senior administrative staff member was originally for the convenience of contacting Chinese officials and dealing with Chinese people. Therefore, the initial name was determined to be Chinese Liaison Officer. Later, because the Chinese directors were not satisfied, they agreed to be named Deputy Secretary or Chinese Secretary. In this way, the authority of the Chinese Director-General would be entirely for handling Chinese affairs, and could not interfere with the general responsibilities of the Director-General. The Chinese directors were still not satisfied and insisted that they should be collectively called Director-General, and the word "Chinese" should not be added. The status of the two Director-Generals must be equal externally, and the division of authority is allowed internally. The British directors believed that the name issue was closely related to the future of the concession and was inconsistent with the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang. Therefore, they still could not compromise. Yesterday's meeting did not yield any concrete results on the name issue. The issue was still referred to the special committee for reconsideration and submitted to the next board meeting for discussion. The issue of candidates was not mentioned. The special committee is scheduled to meet next Monday.</p>

<p>The labor strike at the Chunhua Rubber Factory on Jiandaoqiao Road in the Nanshi district of this city, which had been ongoing for some time, had seen the Social Affairs Bureau dispatch personnel for mediation, and both labor and management had also conducted independent negotiations, but without success.

<h3 id="e114">Jisheng Association to Establish Straw Hat Training Center in Beiping <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association recently received letters from Mr. Yu Guisheng, director of the Tianjin office, and Mr. Zhou Jingfu, director of the Beiping office, stating that since the provincial capital of Beiping was moved to Tianjin, more people have become unemployed, and the livelihood of the poor is getting worse year by year. Those who were considered poor in previous years are now extremely poor. Although the association has exclusively established soup kitchens, or invited various charitable organizations to set up soup kitchens, with as many as 25 locations last year, charitable donations are limited, while the number of poor people is increasing endlessly. Continuing to sit idle will lead to inevitable collapse, and it is difficult to provide adequate relief. Moreover, simply feeding the idle is not a good strategy. It is necessary to provide manual labor opportunities and opportunities for production, so that young and middle-aged women have trades they can learn as a basis for making a living, so that the number of poor people will gradually decrease. They requested the establishment of straw hat weaving training centers in two locations in Beiping: Liangjiayuan in the southern city and Huangchenggen in the western city, to collaborate with charitable individuals, raise funds in the name of the association, and recruit women to learn the craft. Currently, 300 female students have registered, with each student requiring about 4 yuan per month for meals. Based on individual aptitude, the training period will be two months or four months. After completing their studies, they will be assessed and paid wages to support their livelihoods. Now, Mr. Lin Ziwen has been sent to Shanghai to discuss funding matters. The association has initially agreed to set up two locations, with the association responsible for the start-up expenses and the daily meals for the female students. If successful in the future, it will be further promoted. This is also a fundamental method of relieving the poor. It is hoped that charitable comrades at home and abroad will emulate this approach, so that poor women can earn their own living.</p>

<p>From the Town to the Ferry Terminal</p>
<p>Gaoqiao Town in Pudong has a large population and abundant local resources. Many residents operate various businesses in Puxi, so their need for reliable and fast transportation is extremely urgent. Since the municipal government's ferry service started operating new ferries, people in the town have repeatedly requested the authorities to extend the service to Gaoqiao. In order to meet the needs, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has added two ferries, which have already been completed. As soon as the Gaoqiao pier is completed, the service can be opened. However, due to the large ships and small harbor, they cannot sail close to the pier site in the town, which is about 1.3 kilometers from the town. The bureau believes that without adequate land transportation links, travel will still be inconvenient. Therefore, it is planned to operate public buses from Gaoqiao Town to the ferry terminal, connecting with the ferry schedule. Roads and bridges have also been built. It is reported that this plan has been approved by the municipal government and is currently being actively prepared by the bureau, using the latest type of buses, to be implemented simultaneously with the ferry service.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Commodity Inspection Bureau Relieves Local Bovine Plague <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Free Serum Injections for Milk Farms</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has been studying methods for preventing livestock diseases since March of last year, under the direction of the Livestock Products Inspection Office. It also began manufacturing bovine plague serum, renting several acres of private land in Jiangwan for testing. At the beginning, due to limited funding, all facilities were still simple. However, its products have been tested repeatedly, and the results are still satisfactory. Last autumn, at the request of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining, the bureau sent personnel to various villages in Qianbeixiang in the fourth district of Zhenjiang to inject serum, curing more than 50 cattle in total. In the spring, the Shanghai Livestock Planting Company purchased four valuable purebred calves from the Red Flower Milk Company in Seattle, USA, and also requested the bureau to inject serum to ensure their health. Recently, bovine plague broke out in Shanghai and is rampant. Through the introduction of Ma Wenjia and Jiang Weiliang of the Dairy Industry Association, Cai Ji, deputy director and veterinarian of the bureau, accompanied by veterinarian Shou Biao and others, went to various milk farms to inject serum free of charge. These included the Huasheng Milk Farm on Huasheng Road, the Huili Milk Farm on Zhoujiazui Road, and the Hongkou Milk Farm and Huishan Milk Farm in Hongkou, saving more than 20 cattle in total. Among them, three were in particularly critical condition and were refused treatment by a well-known Shanghai veterinarian. They were also cured by the bureau using serum. All the cattle owners praised the effectiveness of the serum. In light of past achievements, and because this undertaking is emphasized and promoted by Minister Kong, the bureau is now preparing to submit a request to the Ministry of Industry for permission to actively expand equipment and manufacture more serum to meet the needs of various regions and alleviate the difficulties of farmers.</p>

<p>Chu Chaoding Seriously Injured</p>
<p>At about half past midnight this morning, Chu Chaoding, a 33-year-old from Henan, and Chen Zhengji, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, were passing through Songshan Road in the French Concession when they heard someone calling for help. They immediately followed the sound and saw several bandits blocking passersby and carrying out their killing work. When the bandits saw people coming, they immediately opened fire on them. Unexpectedly, Chu's right waist and Chen's right lower abdomen were each hit by a bullet, and the bullets did not pass through. Patrolman No. 307 of the French Police Station heard the sound and went to the scene, but the bandits had already escaped without a trace. The injured two were then taken by car to the police station to report, and then taken to Renji Hospital for treatment.

<h3 id="e128">Hezong Box Factory in Litigation with Jin Xing Insurance Company <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Jin Xing Unwilling to Pay a Thousand Taels, Court Orders Re-survey</p>
<p>The Hezong Machine Box Factory had insured against fire with Jin Xing Insurance Company for 2,000 taels of silver. In August of the year before last, a fire broke out, and the front buildings of the factory were completely burned down. Fortunately, the fire brigade made every effort to rescue the situation, so the machine installation part in the rear was able to survive. Afterwards, Jin Xing Company specially invited experts to estimate the fire loss. Because the factory was located in the Zhabei Chinese area, they refused foreigners to go to the factory for inspection, so Jin Xing refused to compensate. The company was sued in court. After trial, the court ruled that since only half of the burned buildings were burned, the defendant should compensate for 1,000 taels of insurance. Jin Xing refused to accept this decision and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Higher Branch Court. The reason given was that the burned house was of a very simple structure and not connected to the unburned part of the factory, so it was not covered by the insurance. Even if it was connected to the unburned part, the construction cost would certainly not be equal to the unburned part. In order to compensate for the loss, it is necessary to estimate the value of the burned house in order to show fairness. However, the original judgment ordered compensation based on the reason that half was burned, which is difficult to convince. Yesterday afternoon, Hu Yigu, the presiding judge of the Civil Division of the High Court, judges Li Mo and Gao Junxiang, and clerk Qian Qizhong, held a hearing. First, the lawyer for the appellant stated the reasons, and then the respondent also hired a lawyer to respond. The court believed that the degree of the fire could not be clarified without a personal inspection of the factory, so it ordered both parties to pay 10 yuan each for the survey fee within seven days, and a hearing would be held after the survey was clarified. However, the burned house has already been rebuilt and completed by the factory, and there is no trace of the fire damage left, so the survey may be very difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Zou Aizhen Counter-Sues Tang Huixuan: Trial Begins <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Accusation of False Accusation and Bigamy</p>
<p>Bigamy Seems to Have Exceeded Statute of Limitations</p>
<p>The False Accusation Needs Investigation</p>
<p>Economic Doctor Tang Huixuan, also known as Tang Chongci, sued his wife Zou Aizhen (also known as Zou Weici) for adultery with Chen Genwei, but the case was not established. Zou Aizhen counter-sued Tang Huixuan for false accusation and bigamy, and a public prosecution was initiated.</p>
<p>Tang Huixuan's two written documents are used as evidence for the bigamy charge. Zou Aizhen submitted two papers written by Tang Shuli: (One) the original text is: "Chongci hereby writes the following document with the utmost sincerity: If I break my promise midway, I will accept any punishment from Aizhen and will never disobey. (1) When Chongci and Aizhen got engaged, I did not explain everything, so Aizhen only knew about Chongci and no one else. In the future, if any person surnamed Tang comes to claim kinship or create trouble, Aizhen can use any means to deal with them, and Chongci shall have no objection. (2) When Chongci and Aizhen got engaged, Chongci had no permanent property. Aizhen often provides economic assistance. In the future, when Chongci becomes successful, Aizhen shall personally manage all movable and immovable property and dispose of it freely. No one from the Tang family or others shall interfere, and Chongci shall obey unconditionally. (3) After Chongci and Aizhen are married, all residential issues and Chongci's actions must be agreed upon by Aizhen, and it is decided that he will never return to Guangxi. If it is necessary to return to Guangxi for important matters concerning Chongci's future, it must also be with Aizhen's permission, and no one from the Tang family shall interfere, and Chongci shall obey unconditionally. (4) After Chongci and Aizhen are married, I am willing to love Aizhen with a pure spirit, and will forever abandon bad habits such as gambling, excessive drinking, taking concubines, and frequenting prostitutes, and will not have relationships with other women. If Chongci breaks this promise, Aizhen is free to punish him." Written by Tang Chongci on October 10th, the twelfth year of the Republic of China. (Two) The original text is: "Tang Chongci, the person writing this separation agreement, because when Tang Chongci and Zou Weici (i.e., Aizhen) got engaged, Chongci did not declare to Weici that he had been married in Guangxi and had children, etc., and only after the marriage did I realize that Chongci admitted to having deceived her. Therefore, a contract was drawn up. After returning to China, Chongci repeatedly violated the contract, and Weici repeatedly tried to dissuade him but he would not listen, proving that he intentionally broke the contract and was deceitful. Therefore, Weici could no longer bear it, and both parties agreed to separate for two years so that Chongci could reform himself. After two years, we would reconcile as before; otherwise, we would divorce formally. During these two years of separation, Chongci must send all income and savings, except for the cost of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, to Weici. All his actions must also be with Weici's permission and must not be violated. In order to avoid empty words without proof, this is written as evidence." Written by Tang Chongci on May 27th in Yichang (Year 18, written on stationery with Hubei stamp tax from the Yichang branch).</p>
<p>Tang Huixuan's testimony record is that Zou Aizhen re-engaged lawyer Zheng Xiuxiu (with lawyer Wang Deyi as a substitute) to submit a statement, requesting a private prosecution for damages. Yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., Judge Zhao Yongzhou opened the first courtroom to hear the case. Tang Huixuan hired lawyers Qian Shusheng and Yuan Yang'an to defend him in court. Official (asked): Tang Huixuan, also known as Tang Chongci, age 37, from Guangxi, lives by writing, currently an editor at Datong Bookstore, residing at No. 19, Jincheng Lane, Daxing Street.

(Answer): Married in the third year of the Republic of China, divorced in the seventh year. (Asked): When did you go abroad? (Answer): The eighth year of the Republic of China.

(Answer): Relatives and friends can all testify for me. (Asked): Are your parents alive? (Answer): Yes. (Asked): How many brothers do you have? (Answer): Three. (Asked): When did you marry Zou Aizhen? (Answer): The twelfth year of the Republic of China. (Asked): Where? (Answer): San Francisco. (Asked): Four days after the marriage, did you receive a letter from home saying your wife was doing well? (Answer): No. However, Zou Aizhen said she was a modern woman from Shanghai and did not want to be a concubine. (Asked): Did she not question you, and did you not write a guarantee yourself? (See the original text above). (Answer): This is a false accusation, it didn't happen. (Asked): Where did the documents she submitted to the court come from? (Answer): They are forged. (Asked): How many children did you have with Aizhen? (Answer): Four, two are still alive, one boy and one girl. (Asked): Why are you in litigation?

(Answer): From October of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. I came back from Guangxi and saw their intimate state. Later, the maid told me, so I reported it to the Third Sub-district of the First District and sent two patrol officers to arrest them. This happened on August 16th of last year. (Asked): What is the relationship between Chen Genwei? (Answer): None. (Asked): What about with Zou Aizhen? (Answer): Also none. When I asked, she claimed he was her mother's adopted son, but Chen's own nephew came to testify, proving there was no relationship. (Asked): You once sued for interference with marriage, but the first instance ruled you not guilty. After your appeal was rejected for procedural reasons, it was sent to the prosecutor's office for investigation, and you were not prosecuted? (Answer): Yes. However, Prosecutor Wu said on February 22nd, "This prosecutor is very clear about your case, but you are suffering mentally and financially from being in litigation with them. Why not withdraw the case?" Because I respected the prosecutor's opinion, I stated how they had counter-sued me. The prosecutor said that was not a problem either, so I submitted a statement withdrawing the lawsuit. After receiving the non-prosecution disposition, I wanted to settle the matter peacefully. However, on the eighth day, I received another indictment. This was beyond my expectations. (Asked): After withdrawing the case, did you go to court? (Answer): No. The official said: "This is the false accusation part. You need to provide evidence for the bigamy." (Answer): These documents are forged.

(Asked): Now he doesn't admit it. (Answer): You can compare the handwriting. There is also a separation agreement, written on May 27th of the eighteenth year. (Asked): Where is the paper? (Answer): It has already been submitted to the court. (Asked): He said that he came back from Hubei in the eighteenth year and you refused to live with him. (Answer): He forged stamps himself in Yichang and was wanted. He fled to Hankou and took his accountant, Le Zifang, who was sentenced to six months in prison. He was afraid that people would find him, so he dared not live at home and wanted me to live with him in the concession. You can check the judgment. He is slandering me. How can a wife refuse her husband? When I arrived in Yichang, he had already rented a house with a prostitute and was living with her. I wanted to divorce him, so he wrote a separation agreement to see how things would go. (See the original text above). (Asked): If he didn't come to your house, why would he write a separation agreement? (Answer): It was written in Yichang, in May. Le Zifang can testify. Moreover, this stationery is from the office. I could not have forged it. (Asked): What office? (Answer): The Stamp Tax Bureau. (Asked): What did he do? (Answer): He was the director. The official then turned (asked): Regarding Tang's proof that he already had a wife at home, how can this stationery prove it is American? Zou Aizhen (answered): There is a street in America with entirely Chinese shops (Chinatown). (Asked): Did you not have an affair with Chen Genwei? (Answer): No. (Asked): What is the relationship between Chen Genwei and you? (Answer): Siblings. (Asked): He is surnamed Chen and you are surnamed Zou, how can you be siblings? (Answer): He is adopted. (Asked): When was he adopted? (Answer): At the age of six. (Asked): How old is he this year? (Answer): Twenty-eight years old. (Asked): Tang Huixuan said you had an affair with Chen Genwei, so he sued you. (Answer): This is because he wants a divorce unconditionally and is making a false accusation. (Asked): Is there any proof of his adoption? (Answer): Tang Zouqiu. (Asked): Is there anyone else? (Answer): Many relatives know. (Asked): You still need to provide evidence of the adoption. (Answer): My mother is in charge of this. (Asked): What is your mother's name? (Answer): Zou Yu.</p>
<p>The Statute of Limitations for Bigamy Prosecution. At this point, Tang Huixuan added, "I was in Hankou because of illness. She is completely slandering me. Chen Genwei went to England at the age of twenty and had an affair with a friend's wife. He was almost beaten to death and fled back. I paid for Zou Aizhen's tuition and education expenses. I have spent ten years of savings. If she accuses me of bigamy and falsely accuses me, I have no choice but to commit suicide." At this point, the official said that the case still needs to be investigated. Lawyer Qian Shusheng then said, "Assuming Tang Huixuan is suspected of bigamy, it cannot be established now. The bigamy occurred in the twelfth year of the Republic of China. According to Article 11 of the Implementation Law of the Criminal Law, the statute of limitations for the right to prosecute under the old criminal law should be applied, and it has already expired. The prosecutor did not pay attention when prosecuting. To save time, please pay attention to the presiding judge." Then, lawyer Yuan Yang'an added that according to Article 291 of the old criminal law, the most severe punishment for bigamy is imprisonment for a term of four. According to Article 69, Section 5 of the same law, the statute of limitations for public prosecution expires after one year. This case cannot be established at all. The interrogating official then said that the false accusation part still needs to be investigated, so he must be summoned again. The lawyers said yes, and then the court adjourned, waiting for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>Gong Yinsheng is Unfilial and Wicked</p>
<p>An old woman from Pudong, Gong Xia, 49 years old, runs a safety pin shop at No. 2, Lane 389, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi. Her husband died early, leaving behind a son and a daughter. The son's name is Yinsheng, 27 years old. The daughter's name is Liubao, 20 years old. Yinsheng is violent and dissolute, and only associates with rogues. The old woman has repeatedly rebuked him but he would not repent. So, last year, she drove him out and did not recognize the mother-son relationship. However, he still went to the old woman's house from time to time to ask for money. The old woman could not bear it. Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 p.m., Yinsheng and his mistress went directly to the old woman's house and forcibly demanded money. The old woman refused because he had been asking for money repeatedly. Yinsheng became furious and immediately grabbed a very sharp awl from the table and stabbed the old woman wildly. His sister Liubao rushed forward to stop him and was also affected, resulting in numerous wounds and blood flowing like a stream on both the mother and daughter's arms and other places. Wu Yanyi, the security guard of the 26th post in the area, heard about the incident and rushed to the scene, arresting Yinsheng and taking him and the weapon to the First Sub-district of the First District for preliminary interrogation and handling.</p>

<p>Qian Mingfu Escaped Without a Trace, Zhang Jinshan Died by Poisoning</p>
<p>Zhang Jinshan, a native of Zhenjiang, 55 years old, was an employee in the color printing department of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road in Zhabei, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan. He had been working in the library for more than ten years. He had a close friend named Qian Mingfu, who was in the foreign goods business. After closing his business in the middle of last year, he stayed in Shanghai, destitute. He wanted to become a street vendor, but he lacked capital. Through Zhang's introduction, he purchased goods on credit from a foreign goods store on Haining Road, and Zhang guaranteed everything. Initially, the amount was small, but after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the debt gradually increased. By the end of the year, he owed about 600 yuan, but he kept making excuses to return the money, and then disappeared. The store became alarmed and had no choice but to seek payment from the guarantor. They repeatedly demanded payment from Zhang. On the dawn of the lunar New Year's Day, the collectors were still there at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. Zhang was honest and suffered for others, feeling depressed. The day before yesterday (the 18th), he committed suicide by swallowing opium paste. His colleagues in the dormitory discovered it and immediately sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, he had been poisoned too much and died at about 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Wu Changtai's sand boat, from Nanshi, recently loaded goods worth thirty to forty thousand taels from Jiaozhou, Shandong, and sailed to Shanghai to be sold on consignment. On the 13th of this month, when sailing in the Yanggang sea area, about twenty miles away from Chongming, a large three-masted ship suddenly sailed in front of them and ordered them to stop. Wu's boat did not suspect it was a pirate ship, so they did not stop and continued sailing as usual. Suddenly, the pirate ship opened fire and injured two of Wu's crew. The crew members were shocked and frightened. A group of pirates swarmed onto the boat, searched everywhere, and only managed to steal more than one hundred yuan. They were furious and immediately forced Wu's boat to sail near Tongzhou, where they robbed half of the cargo on the boat, fully loaded the pirate ship, and fled. Wu's boat is now docked at the mouth of Chongming, but the hull was hit by bullets and cannot sail. The injured crew members were sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The Tragic Death of Ma Xiaosanzi</p>
<p>Ma San, a coolie foreman at the wharf in Nanshi, had a son named Xiaosanzi, 13 years old. Because of the Lunar New Year holiday, Ma was resting at home. Yesterday morning, a relative came to visit Ma for the New Year. Ma invited him to lunch. The relative and Ma's son went out to play and came to a nearby toy stall. Xiaosanzi was happy to see the toys. The relative bought him a foreign bubble-blowing toy and gave it to him to play with. Xiaosanzi took it home and immediately put the bubble tube in his mouth in front of the door, blowing the bubbles bigger or smaller. Unexpectedly, he sucked too hard, and with a sudden contraction, he sucked the bubble into his throat. He was immediately speechless, unable to vomit, and his face turned pale. His parents were shocked and frightened when they saw this. They checked his throat but could not see anything. Later, they hired a car to send Xiaosanzi to Nanshi Hospital for treatment. The doctor examined him and found that the bubble skin had shrunk into the intestinal area below the throat. The bubble was made of water, and the poison mixed into the intestines had already rotted. Although the doctor tried to remove the broken bubbles, the intestinal area was too badly rotted to be saved. He died at 4:00 p.m. His parents hugged his body and cried loudly, heartbroken. Those who saw it were saddened.</p>

<p>Xiao A'mei, a maidservant at the home of a Dr. Gu at No. 73 Minhang Road, was only 14 years old. She was originally from Suzhou and had been a maidservant in the Gu family for only five months. The day before yesterday at 11:30 a.m., Xiao A'mei went upstairs for something and saw Gu's chauffeur, Jiang Huagen (20 years old) from Wuxi, burning a stove in the wing room. As soon as Xiao A'mei entered the room, she was pushed to the floor by Jiang, who pulled off her clothes and raped her. Xiao A'mei screamed and cried, but there was no one upstairs, and no one downstairs heard anything. After Jiang had satisfied his lust, she was able to get up. Then her uncle, Zhu Heshang, arrived, and Xiao A'mei told him. Zhu told the employer, who informed the Hongkou Police Station, who sent a detective to arrest Jiang. Xiao A'mei was immediately sent to the hospital, where the doctor confirmed that her hymen had been damaged. Yesterday morning, Jiang was taken to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xiao interrogated him. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, charged Jiang with the crime of raping a minor girl according to Article 140, Section 3 of the Criminal Law and presented the doctor's report and bloodstained pants as evidence. Then, Xiao A'mei recounted the circumstances of the rape. Jiang confessed that he had been a chauffeur in the Gu family for six years. He claimed that what happened yesterday was initiated by Xiao A'mei, who first sat on his lap. He then asked her to go to a hotel with him, but she was too impatient, so this indecent act occurred, and so on. The judge then appointed Shen Xingxia as the defendant's lawyer to defend him. In the end, the defendant was still detained, awaiting a scheduled sentence.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Jiangsu Education Department's Order to Report the 20th Year's Administrative Plan and Education Budget <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department instructed the county magistrates, stating: "The education administrative plan is the basis for annual education facilities, and the education budget should be carefully allocated according to the projects specified in the plan to make the best use of public funds and ensure the successful completion of all tasks. These two are mutually causal and should not be neglected. Since its establishment, this department has deeply understood the relationship between them. Therefore, last year, on one hand, it issued outlines and detailed rules for budget preparation, setting a deadline for submission, and on the other hand, it urged the prompt reporting of administrative plans as a guideline. In the past six months, after repeatedly examining the plans reported by various counties, they often exceeded the budget scope. Even though the budget had been stipulated, projects continued to expand, resulting in numerous requests to draw from the first reserve fund, which seemed to be undisciplined and lacked standards. Both the plan and the budget lost their effectiveness. It was found that the Central Political Council resolved that 'the budget for the 20th year should be prepared before March of the 20th year.' This was previously ordered by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Ministry of Education, and it was relayed for compliance. Now that the deadline is approaching, both the budget and the plan should be prepared immediately. This department, in view of the previous discrepancy between the plan and the budget, if not corrected immediately, it will inevitably become unmanageable. Moreover, the economic conditions of various counties have been fluctuating recently, and items such as 'overdue fines' and 'surcharges' have been allocated to the provincial treasury or the collection has been stopped, and the compensatory measures have not yet been resolved. If we do not prepare in advance, the difficulties in the future will only increase. For the sake of prior supervision and assessment, a special order is issued to the county magistrates to supervise their respective bureau chiefs to quickly formulate an education administrative plan for the 20th year based on the actual local economic conditions, and to prepare the education budget for the entire county for the 20th year in strict accordance with the plan. All should be sent to the department for review before March 31st of this year. The content of this plan includes four categories: 'administration,' 'general education,' 'compulsory education,' and 'social education.' The 'general,' 'compulsory,' and 'social' categories must be divided into two parts: 'consolidation' and 'expansion,' to clarify the details and facilitate review. The budget should still be handled in accordance with the outline and detailed rules for preparing education budgets for various counties issued in the 19th year. Fearing that there may still be misunderstandings or unclear points, another copy of the 'Points to Note for Preparing the 20th Year's Budget for Various Counties' is issued, and should be followed. In addition to separate orders, this order is for the county magistrates to comply with. This matter is an important policy for the year, and the county magistrates bear the responsibility for the entire county's education administration, and cannot be negligent, resulting in delays and disciplinary action. Let each be cautious." Attached: "Points to Note" (1) The annual repair and placement expenses required by each school and institution should be extracted by the bureau as a lump sum and listed in the temporary expenditure section to be used for selective disbursement at any time. Unless there is an unexpected and huge use, do not arbitrarily request to use the first reserve fund. (2) The second reserve fund is set up for famine relief and to offset the difference between the assessed amount and the actual collection amount. Counties with a large average difference between the assessed amount and the actual collection amount should list it according to this difference ratio, but counties with a very small difference should not be less than the prescribed amount. (3) Special funds for compulsory and social education to subsidize administrative and special expenses should be listed separately in the compulsory and social education sub-volumes to facilitate the calculation of the amount when checking the issuance and disbursement documents. (4) Under items such as overdue fines and surcharges, the original collection amount and whether there are offsetting measures should be noted for review."</p>

<p>(1) Training Class Courses and Teachers The courses of the training class have already been drafted, and the teachers of each course have now been hired, many of whom are experts with rich research on cooperation. They are listed below: Party Principles (Yang Daoyu), Overview of Cooperation (Wang Shiying), Agricultural Cooperation (Tang Qiyu), Overview of Economics (Shou Miancheng), Management Theory of Consumer Cooperation (Chen Zhongming), Management Theory of Credit Cooperation (Zhang Dingzhi), Cooperative Bookkeeping (Xie Cheng), Cooperative Laws and Regulations (Hou Zhemang), Commercial Calculation and Abacus (Li Weichao).</p>

<p>Germany is a Strong Enemy in the World, Japan is a Formidable Rising Star</p>
<p>The 10th World Games will be held in Los Angeles, USA next year, from July 31st to August 15th. The preparations have been reported in this newspaper repeatedly. To date, 57 countries have signed up to participate. Almost all independent countries in the world will send representatives to the meeting. It is expected that the grand occasion of this conference will be several times more enthusiastic than the previous one. The United States is now actively preparing for war, preparing to fight against Germany, a strong enemy in the world. Because in the last conference, the most important track and field championship was won by Germany, while the United States was defeated. After the humiliation, the United States vowed to avenge its shame in this conference. Recently, the American head coach Rubardtson made a statement to the press, saying that the tenacity of Germany, Japan, Britain, and France should be guarded against by the Americans. When the previous conference was held in Germany, I was the track and field instructor. Seeing Japan win three items in the field events, the United States was deeply hit. Japan uses the doctrine of sacrifice every time, so the speed of its progress is truly formidable as a rising star in the world. The team that needs to fight hard in the United States is Germany, the only strong enemy. It is unpredictable who will win in the future. And the strength of Britain and France should not be underestimated. The United States is more confident in track and field, especially in jumping and sprinting. There are now five people who can jump over two meters in the high jump, and ten people who can run the short distance in ten seconds and six. The Dutch players with the 100-meter result of ten seconds and two can be called the best in the competition. Other items such as discus and long jump should be able to dominate.</p>

<p>The Jinan football team, which shook the overseas and praised the Far East, returned to the country yesterday on the President Hoover. The ship docked in the river, and at 2:30, it was transferred to a small boat and landed on the Bund. There were many people on the Jiangbian Pier, including Yang Yufen, the representative of the school principal Zheng Hongnian, Hao Chunde and Cai Guoping, the representatives of the alumni association, Li Silian, the nanny of the Chinese football world, and other related men and women, relatives and friends, all looking forward to it. The cold wind did not diminish their enthusiasm. With a surprise, the strong men are in sight, and the joy of reunion after a long absence, under each other's conversation, seems to have another feeling</p>

<p>The Jinan Philippine expeditionary force spent a total of 43 days on this trip, with five charity matches and two friendly matches in the Philippines. A total of seven times, six wins and one loss, and numerous awards, including silver cups from the Charity Association, Education Association, Advisory Group Alumni Association, and Liu Qinggu, and countless other flags, can be said to be a great success. The first battle was lost to La Lili with zero to three, which is not without regret. At that time, the momentum of the expeditionary force was strong. Unfortunately, the shooting at the door was in line with the heart. The expeditionary force lost two goals in the first half. In the second half, the Philippine expeditionary force broke through the barrier twice, and the judges declared offside, which shook the military's morale. As a result, the twelve-yard opportunity later failed. There is no lack of luck in this.</p>

<p>Wei</p>
<p>Central Committee member Wu Zhihui is known to everyone as a pillar of the party and the country who is knowledgeable about the past and the present, and also a famous person who is good at humor. There are many interesting anecdotes about him. Various newspapers have repeatedly described them. I had a cold night talk with a friend who studied in France, involving an anecdote about Wu in France in the past. It seems to be something that Chinese people have not said. I will describe it as follows.</p>
<p>There is a branch of Lyon University in France. It is specially set up for Chinese students who are not at the level to make up for it. Wu once served as the vice president of the branch and brought two of his relatives to study at the school, one male and one female. The female was about 20 years old, and the male was only about 10 years old. The dormitories in the school are separated for men and women and never mixed. However, the male child was too young and relied on the female child to take care of him. The dormitories were isolated and inconvenient. Wu ordered the male relative to live in the female dormitory with the female child. Unexpectedly, within a few days, the students of the whole school were in an uproar, because the female dormitory was not allowed to mix with men, and they reported it to the principal. The principal was originally a stubborn Frenchman, and he thought so. He issued a ban, but it did not involve the surname. The general idea was that men and women are different and should not be mixed. He reiterated the previous ban. The words were quite stern. Wu saw the demonstration and knew that he was mocking himself. He was very angry. He went to the principal's house and questioned him face to face, saying, "You only know men and women, but you don't know the elderly and the young. My relatives are only ten years old. How can they be called adults? How can they have ambiguous behavior?" At that time, the principal was carrying a young daughter in his hand. Wu pointed and laughed and said, "If you are with this daughter, will you also say that it is irregular?" The principal was speechless and apologized with a smile. Wu is not only proficient in French, but also proficient in English. Foreigners admire him very much</p>

<p>Dian Xie Yunnan borders the southern wilderness. The mountains and rivers are intertwined and have a high-rise building potential. The climate is like spring all year round. However, it is limited to Kunming and Dali. If you think about Simao Mengzi Mao Nan land, the rainbow plague is very special. Middlemen die every time. Live at home with bright lights at night, saying it makes the gas go away. The oil-stained hat is more dirty and more precious. When gas comes, it covers the nose to avoid being attacked. Therefore, filthy hats are often worth more than gold.</p>
<p>Qian Cheng Guizhou was the last province in China to open customs. The county rule is mostly made during the Republic of China. Before the Republic of China, I heard that the conquerors of the land would let military officers ride horses. From the beginning to the end, the square was wide, so it became the subordinate. Therefore, there are many large landlords in western Guizhou in recent days. The tillers are his soldiers and soldiers. Mr. Xu, a classmate from Sichuan, recently came from Sichuan and said that there was heavy snow along the way east of Kuimen, while the rape blossoms were colored inside Kuimen. Sichuan is blessed by nature, which can be seen here. However, it also leads to misfortune. Sichuan's money and food have recently been paid to the 30th year of the Republic of China, and the seeds of poppy are regarded as the same as the five grains. As a result, the names of taxes are also very numerous. If it is an opium tax, if it is an addict tax, it is a universal and beautiful word. (Unstamped)</p>

<p>My old friend, Mr. Cai Wenzhun, with his indomitable spirit, and Ms. Wei Yunmei and Ms. Yingbo, jointly founded the Plum Blossom Singing and Dancing Troupe. His contribution is truly remarkable. Recently, he and Ms. Weng Lanhun held an engagement ceremony at the Cai residence in Zhapu, arranged by Ms. Yingbo. On the tenth, they hosted a banquet for relatives and friends at the Yizhixiang Restaurant. Besides the five tigers of the Mei Troupe – Qian Zhongxiu, Zhang Xianlin, Xu Can'ying, Gong Qiuxia, and Zhang Qi – and other troupe members, nearly a hundred guests attended.</p>
<p>A "tall person" played matchmaker, and everyone enjoyed the engaged couple's honey wine. The groom was then asked to report on the engagement process. Mr. Cai spoke eloquently, saying that while the traditional matchmaker is the Old Man Under the Moon, they had a "tall person under the moon." This was because Ms. Yingbo was exceptionally tall, towering over everyone present. He also mentioned that the "tall person under the moon" was the agent of this marriage, while Ms. Xu Can'ying and Ms. Hong Naiqiu were the representatives, acknowledging their significant efforts in bringing it about. Someone in the audience inquired when the "transaction" would be completed, considering the "deal" was finalized today. Mr. Cai blurted out that they would be performing at the Capital Theater in Nanjing starting from the fifteenth, then return to Shanghai to perform "Yang Guifei," and then go to Xiamen. They would be back in Shanghai before the rainy season. Everyone burst into laughter and shouted "rainy season," causing the engaged couple to blush. The power of the maternal uncle! Mr. Cai placed his maternal uncle, the Kunqu opera master Mr. Xu Youfang, in the seat of honor. After Cai's report, the "tall person under the moon" was asked to reenact the proposal. Cai refused. Mr. Youfang then said to me, "Please represent the maternal uncle fully to make it happen." Thus, I, in the capacity of representing the maternal uncle, gave the order. Mr. Cai had no choice but to bow slightly and kiss Ms. Weng's fair hand, whispering, "My dear, do you love me? Will you marry me?" Under the power of the maternal uncle, Ms. Weng had to smile and nod. The guests applauded, and the proposal ceremony was thus completed.</p>
<p>After the meal, they had a photo taken by the New Art Photography Studio to commemorate the occasion. As we were expressing our gratitude to the host, the phonograph in the room began playing "Home, Sweet Home." (Unstamped)</p>
<h3 id="e166">Anecdotes from the Carnival Queen Election <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Written by Wenchuyi from Manila</p>
<p>In past carnivals, there was an election for a Filipina to be the Carnival Queen. Because the Philippines consists of the three major islands of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, there were also titles for Luzon Queen, Visayas Queen, and Mindanao Queen, representing those with slightly lesser status, appearance, and wealth, similar to having vice-seats beside the main seat. However, this year's event had several particularly interesting aspects that deserve recording.</p>
<p>Changes to the election system. Four or five years ago, the voting rights were held by the shareholders, which made it susceptible to influence from wealth and power. Therefore, an aesthetics committee was specially established. All candidates initially selected by the newspapers had to be judged and evaluated by the committee members. Last year, a certain lady refused to wear a swimsuit, willing to forgo the chance to be selected, and the elected Carnival Queen's Catholic school claimed she was chasing vanity, leading to humiliation (due to wearing a swimsuit for close and distant viewing by the committee members), and expelled her. As a result, the event sparked two different viewpoints and heated debates in society. This year, the system was changed again, with the shareholders conducting the final selection. Ultimately, genuinely beautiful common girls still did not receive public support, and the competition remained among daughters of political figures or wealthy families. The crown-bearer for just over ten days brings great honor to relatives and friends, and also causes a group of lavish young men to fall head over heels.</p>
<p>Worthy of the Dragon Seed. The Filipina selected this year is the daughter of the director of the National Library and a university professor. Her mother was selected as the first Carnival Queen in 1908 and was known as the beauty of the entire island. The selected Luzon Queen is the daughter of a large landowner from Nueva Ecija province. Her cousin was the retiring Carnival Queen of three years prior. Fine daughters blossom within the same family, a rare and delightful occurrence amid the election's clamor.</p>
<p>Unwilling to be a Vice-Queen. On the night of the coronation, the grand ballroom was brightly lit with electric lights, and luxurious carriages competed to wait at the entrance. Carnival officials suddenly received a letter from the Luzon Queen, stating that she had already returned to her hometown to enjoy the pleasures of rural life and was unwilling to live a life of excessive luxury in this vain arena. According to those familiar with the inside story, the Luzon Queen believed her beauty surpassed that of the Filipina Queen and was unwilling to be second to her, thus willing to sacrifice the title. The authorities did not insist on retaining her according to custom and simply filled the position with the candidate who received the next highest number of votes.</p>
<h3 id="e167">May Fourth and Revolution · Fei · Wen · Bao <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The motivation for Chinese youth to participate in the revolution originated with the May Fourth Movement. The broker No. 54 in the Goods Exchange was an important place where key figures of the Party and the nation gathered. At that time, the arrogance of the warlords was rampant, and men of ambition often hid among the merchants, biding their time. Later, with the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy, this place became the liaison office in Shanghai. The person in charge was none other than the current Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Mr. Chen Xizeng. It is worth considering that the number "54" is the product of 6 and 9. In the Book of Changes, 6 is the yin number and 9 is the yang number. With yin and yang complementing each other, Earth and Heaven achieve harmony. If we combine the Arabic numerals 6 and 9, they form the Taijitu symbol. Therefore, the future of political clarity, with virtuous people rising and petty people declining, is rooted in this.

<p>(212) Sacred Flower</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Shuanglin will be going to Siam on the 10th. A friend came from Siam and invited him. I always considered Siam to be the most purely Buddhist country in the world and intended to visit it, but I haven't been able to. Now, I'm in Burma, but Burma is ruled by the British and is not governed by Buddhist principles. Siam, however, is able to govern with pure Buddhism and is fully independent. It has even regained extraterritorial rights, something our country has not been able to do. There must be something special about it. If that's the case, then the notion that Buddhism cannot govern a country is also shattered. My friend said that customs inspections in Siam are very strict for people of any country, not just China. As for the number of Chinese people in Siam, it's hard to say for sure. Some say that the Siamese population is eight or nine million, with Chinese accounting for one-third. However, this is limited by national borders; everyone must be subject to Siamese law, regardless of their ethnicity. To teach in Siam, one must learn the Siamese language. Siamese people revere Buddha and are generous, even showing respect to beggars. My friend believes that the thick customs of Siam and Burma are most likely to avert the disaster of communism in the future. However, they are also affected by economic factors, and their good customs and beautiful habits are unable to resist economic pressure. Material things are not yet developed, hygiene is not emphasized, life is simple, and the view of life is very free. The Siamese royal family, in order to maintain its bloodline, does not intermarry with foreign races, taking their own sisters as queens. This is very different from our country. Siamese Buddha statues differ from those of other countries, with many statues standing in military attire, and few seated statues. They all have their hands in a gesture of resistance. I initially saw this in Penang and didn't find it beautiful. According to people, the reason Siamese Buddha statues are like this is that during a previous robbery by soldiers, the Buddha manifested in this form. Therefore, later, his statue was sculpted like this everywhere. The relationship between China and Siam goes back who knows how long. There's an interesting story: In Mount Jiuhua in Anhui, there was a Buddha statue that achieved enlightenment, who was the brother of the King of Siam, reincarnated as Ksitigarbha. One year, people spread the rumor that the King of Siam's brother was coming to China again. For a time, people welcomed him very enthusiastically. In conclusion, judging from this, there will surely be good relations between China and Siam in the future. Could this be the motivation? Why do our people worship the King of Siam's brother so much? The rumor stems from the saying that the King of Siam's brother is a reincarnation of Ksitigarbha. Mount Jiuhua is Ksitigarbha's pilgrimage site, and women and men come to offer incense every year. Using religious sentiment to connect internationally is also a good diplomatic strategy.</p>

She asked about the foreigner with the full beard... and he said that he went back to his country last winter... She showed him her platinum watch... and said it was bought from your store... The man asked, do you have the warranty? Hua Lao Liu said... I lost it... He asked, when did you buy it, which month and day? She couldn't remember clearly either... The man looked at the watch carefully... and said this is an "imported" item... If the watch's internal mechanism is broken... we have watch repairmen who can fix it for you... But we don't fix the problem of a prong coming loose... because Chinese craftsmen can't do that kind of platinum fine work yet... If it's not important... we can send it to a foreign country for you... Hua Lao Liu heard about sending it to a foreign country and was a little worried... It's just a small prong that came loose... nothing major... She tried using a little rosin and alum to glue it firmly... But because a prong was broken off... it would occasionally snag on her clothes... One night... with one of her two beloved rivals... they were enjoying a sweet dream... she didn't know if Hua Lao Liu's... fortune was bad... or if they were too intimate... and they were hooked together at the neck while sleeping... Hua Lao Liu's wrist... unknowingly rested on the face of the man sleeping next to her... Just as he was about to turn over... he pulled his hand away... The man, in a daze... shouted "Ouch!"... and forcefully pushed Hua Lao Liu away... shouting... what's wrong with you?... Hua Lao Liu, rubbing her sleepy eyes, said... what? Are you sleepwalking?... The man said... look... what is it... that scratched my face?... I'm afraid my face is scratched... Hua Yuan Chun, half-raising herself in bed... turned on a light on top of the mosquito net... and looked carefully... only to see on his cheek near the ear... a broken red mark of more than two inches... not quite three inches long... and said... oh my...</p>
<p>...does it hurt?... The man said... what kind of thing did you bring to bed?... you can also take it off when you sleep... are you afraid someone will steal it?... otherwise... you cherish the thing given to you by your sweetheart... and you refuse to take it off... and other people have to suffer!... Hua Yuan Chun said... alright... I won't wear it, then I won't wear it... don't say more...</p>

<p>Translated by Yin Rangneng</p>
<p>In recent decades, China's economic environment has been influenced by the world, gradually making it appear to be lagging behind. Because financial resources are depleted, various social unrest phenomena often occur. Furthermore, all aspects are affected by economic backwardness. Under these circumstances, we must remedy this economic backwardness crisis with a reasonable method. On the one hand, this means seeking social peace and human happiness. At the same time, we must understand that no one lives in this world without consuming, so we must produce.</p>
<p>There are certainly many ways to produce. We are seeking a reasonable production method that can be realized. What is to be described here is the word "cooperation," which is taken from ordinary dictionaries. Even looking at the definition of the word, it can be understood that it is a kind of interaction between humans, that is, many people combine together and carry out a task according to a common goal. This is certainly a very reasonable economic behavior. In a narrow sense, for example, students in various middle schools and universities in our country mostly have consumer cooperatives, and their achievements are still considerable. However, the meaning of this extends to the same as the cooperation that is to be discussed now, only with differences in scope. Consumer cooperation is a combination of two nouns, so this book "Outline of Cooperation" also discusses the consumer item very clearly.</p>
<p>In our China, any reasonable undertaking often causes people to idealize it into a distorted development. For example, consumer cooperation often tends to be oriented toward a certain class, competing for a limited market. As a result, the cycle of commercial prosperity and decline is inevitably brewed. Saying that this contains a scientific basis, however,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>such consumer cooperation fundamentally loses its original reasonable true meaning. Regarding this, the section on "Consumers and Society" in this book speaks clearly. Truly, "Cooperation is not a class movement; it is based on the good of all people. It does not recognize classes, nor does it provoke one class against another. It also does not condemn profit-seeking businesses. It sees the value of the methods currently used for trade, calculation, and business management, because these are made from long-term experience, so it goes on to use them to serve consumers." This statement is certainly very correct. The possibility of cooperatives in society can be seen from the fact that in some places, many beneficial services have been completed by cooperation. There are such places in various countries. One in Czechoslovakia can be regarded as a model. There is a village called Briggitch, with 350 households, each of which is a member of the cooperative. Later, most of the village's life depended on this society. This is a place where consumers are organized for the sole purpose of more easily obtaining what they need and protecting their interests in what they enjoy. Regarding its detailed situation and perfect management, the book describes them very thoroughly. From this, we can understand that the organization of consumers for their own benefit has a major relationship with society. Consumers are not a class; they are everyone. What they seek is not the benefit of one class, but the overall happiness of society. Therefore, advocating the cooperative movement is a very meaningful thing.</p>
<p>Because the organization of consumption has lasting possibilities, it is precisely because it is a movement for the happiness of the entire society. One of the purposes of cooperation is also to abolish profiteering and dependence, harmonize capital and labor, and the completion of service and the consumption of things can be harmonized together. The ideal of the "cooperative society" is that artisans are employed by the society and do their best to work and create the best things. And what he manufactures is not sold on the market for profit; they belong to the society he works in, and he is also a member of this society, so all the value he creates, except for the part proposed to do social welfare, and this is also something he has a share in. If this cooperation can be widespread, then society will be secure and also get consolidated defense.</p>
<p>The process of cooperative development is naturally from small to large. There are many large plans that start by running large cooperatives and doing large-scale operations, but they are ineffective. People use some mutual restraints, first unite together, and then learn how to jointly run a small cooperative business. This is how it will be effective. When they have achieved results, they then increase their members. When they are familiar with one type of management, they then promote cooperation in other aspects. Cooperation is an example of evolution in management. In China, the organization of consumer cooperatives in various middle schools and universities is a good phenomenon. It is really worthy of our admiration that students, as intellectuals, can cultivate such a spirit of hard work and service. However, there are still very few such cooperative organizations in society. This is something we should promote as much as possible. I remember that a few years ago, a group of scholars had promoted a cooperative movement, but this wave disappeared and became an illusion in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Under China's economically backward situation, this cooperation for the happiness of all mankind is necessary to pay attention to. However, like a specialized book with correct judgments about the development of this undertaking, it is really rare in our country's current publishing world. Some, mentioning the connection between economy and society, then want to have the purpose of propagating some economic policies of Marxism. This is only another method of disrupting social peace. What is the need for the promotion of a cooperative movement then? Therefore, under this kind of situation, this "Outline of Cooperation" is also worthy of my recommendation. The author, Dr. Hua Baitao, is a well-known authority on American cooperative business. His book can also be seen as a small history of the American cooperative movement. It is very able to find out the true meaning of the cooperative in this, and it can also be used as a reference for other countries preparing to start this business. Here, the author has detailed descriptions of the operation of cooperative methods and the cooperative movement, and has the same attention to the shortcomings and advantages of cooperation. Therefore, what is called cooperation here is discussed from the standpoint of consumers, which is sufficient for general scholars to study. Of course, cooperation is not absolutely the best business method, and it cannot be said that if it is good, people should adopt it. However, it is also very meaningful to express its facts and possibilities and compare it with other methods.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into eight chapters: (1) Criticism of the Modern Situation, (2) Criticism of the Proposed Relief Methods, (3) The Economics of Cooperation, (4) The Social and Economic Aspects of Cooperation, (5) Methods of Realization, (6) The Shortcomings and Difficulties of Cooperation, (7) The Benefits of Cooperation, (8) All Kinds of People. The descriptions in each chapter have a correct eye and are impartial. This is really the true attitude of research. All matters regarding cooperation are based on the author's knowledge of current cooperative methods, so this book is very worthy of our attention.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The morality of this idea, and this can be applied to commanders at all levels, is that the more uneasy the state of his troops and the more critical the situation in front of him, the more urgently any commander should use his indomitable courage to fulfill his part of the responsibility in the overall war situation. He must never let himself be affected by the uncertainty and danger of his part, because the success of the overall situation can often restore them to their original state. Conversely, it is his responsibility to anxiously and exhaustively devise ways to support his troops through critical periods. My opinion is that the victory of Marne has completely proven this statement to be true. Now is the time to apply it again.</p>
<p>On October 8, after General Franché, the commander of the front lines, established his command headquarters in Albévy, he came to see me in Toulon. This was the first time I had encountered him since the start of the war. It was very pleasant to meet an old friend. We knew each other well. He treated me very well when he was previously in France and England. Our relationship could always be open and honest. Now, we were once again in the same boat in the great war.</p>
<p>One of the pieces of news he brought was about the surrender of Antwerp. He asked me what methods we could use to overthrow the Germans, who had already taken control of Belgium. I replied that we still had no contact with the Belgian army, and our troops were still far from the north coast. In my opinion, the question was whether we could achieve these two goals in time. Now, if we cannot outflank the enemy's northern flank, we should use all our strength to do so.</p>
<p>My old friend Sir Henry Wilson (who later became the commander of the front lines) was with Sir John Franché. I told him I was happy to see him again, and I told him that I firmly believed that the prompt and powerful addition of the British army to the battle group was entirely the result of his proper arrangement as chief of staff. General Wilson had long shown his patriotic vigilance and far-sighted vision, and later operational experience further proved this.</p>
<p>Personally, I didn't think the general war situation was so bad, and I was very confident. I had seen the enemy's defeat in Rouen, and we had repelled them in Marne. The enemy now very much wanted to regain their situation in the north, but we could also maintain our position. Their plan to quickly and overwhelmingly defeat the French army in one battle had failed. The strength of the Russian army would soon be deployed, and the battle achievements of our Second and Tenth Armies and the participation of the British army proved that our northward strategy was very promising. Therefore, on October 10, I wrote to the commander-in-chief saying,</p>
<p>General, I think our situation is very satisfactory. Costerneau is not moving, and Mar is attacking Arras. His success is very slow, but he is still advancing. Further north, our cavalry has just retreated back to the Bussy-Boisnes line, but I don't think there is any relationship, because the British Second Corps will arrive in Boisnes and Lilles at noon today, and the British cavalry regiment will also arrive in Aire and Garbecque. Furthermore, British troops are arriving in Saint-Omer (our defense zone) and its suburbs today to disembark. Under these circumstances, there is no need to fear the German attack. (To be continued)</p>
