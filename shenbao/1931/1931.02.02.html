<p>差不多每件東西都有其歷史上的價值考古家和美術家走進去了可以整天的流連忘返普通人走進去了見到一個教堂内部如此富麗堂皇也可因而窺見天主教在法國勢力之大因爲聖母院至今還爲巴黎大主教駐錫之處以前不但管理教務理政治及教育等都常受他的影響並且聖母院的樂隊和那裡面的音樂設備是世界有名的就没有宗教信仰的人也常顧意屏聲息氣的立在裡面聽聽音樂和歌唱每年聖誔節想到聖母院去參加大彌撤的人是要很早去定位子的　　至於聖母院在法國王朝時代所閱的興亡更是數不勝數許多名王麗后都在這兒行過加冕禮</p>
<p>其中最著名的當然要算雄絶一世的拿破侖大帝了所以游巴黎聖母院的人同時可以得到兩種美的感印一種是實在的美一種是幻想的美實在的美便是兩目顇見的這整個美衛建築幻想的美便是追懹以前在這兒經過的種盛典尤其是讀過詩人嚣俄所著Notredame　de　paris的人對於這種幻想的美更能很容易的把捉着</p>

<p>我們對這臘懊空羣像驚訝地嘆賞了一番之後於是又向左走去再進去是左角的一間小廳希臘大彫刻家派拉克西迪力士Praxiteles(紀元前三八○丨）的代表作品荷默司Hermes神像就兀立在裹面荷默司神受Zeus神的命令而抱着嬰兒（酒神）雙目炯炯右手高舉葡萄一枝在撫弄這嬰兒特别伸長了的軀幹和四肢豐潤柔美爲從來彫刻上的所罕見的派拉克西迪力士的神像表現已漸漸混入了風俗彫刻的要素充滿了真實的感情我們看了這座彫像也就可以證實了</p>
<p>派克迪力士和以前所說的婁西波斯是希臘巨匠婓地亞斯Ｐbidias（西紀前五</p>
<p>○○丨四三二）以後的二大作家但是兩人作品的特點是逈然不同的波氏是柔美的女性的婁氏是激動的男性的前者是希臘藝術白銀時代的大師後者是亞歷山大時代開拓新的時代的健將</p>

<h3>青年升學指導</h3>
<p>湯彬</p>
<p>青年人最大的問題當然不能出乎（擇學·擇業·擇偶）三種而（擇學）尤須最先將它解决因爲它是爲（擇業）時期的準備這樣說來（擇學）旣占青年一生最重要的關鍵所以做父母的當師長的和他自已本人都該萬分的重視上海一地差不多已成爲各種事業的中心即如遠處的青年大都爲了求學的心切而長途跋涉險阻備嘗的負笈於此這種殷殷好之懐委實值得人們的讚許但是人地生疏貿然來此因爲所人的學校非他性之所近或受愚蒙的當然是免不了的事所以在現在的時代就是（升學）一層也須取得良善的指導才可</p>
<p>現在一般青年們無疑地是將升學問題認爲是個人終身成敗的關鍵不能隨隨便便的忽略過去而有貽誤終身的隱憂所以在事前是要認清升學的意義和目的要做到名副其實的升學以期造就一個社會上有用的職業人才將來爲自身努力爲整個的中華民族前途努力所以青年們對於升學問题是須是須重視的如果欲求良好的指示那麽最近出版的這部（青年升學指導）一書是值得述叙的了</p>
<p>現今略述其内容以資作爲準備升學者的參考第一章（引言）是專述升學問題的重要法國哲學家盧騒曾經說過（一個人有兩個誔生期呱呱墮地的時候是第一誕生期從兒童期至青年期是第二誔生期）這是近代心理學者生理學者和教育家所公認的事實當然没有疑義可言在此祇述（青年期）依照我國的學制系統而言一個人逹到了青年期正是中等學校將要終了而要受高等教育或投身社會的時期這時期的青</p>
<p>年因爲生理和心理的突變即發生了許多切身的問題而都是要在這時期以内所感覺的同時也是要急謀解决的（青年期是一個終身成敗的關鍵所以盧　稱之爲（第二誔生期）這升學問題本來</p>
<p>是近代文明國家所不成問題的然而在中國不獨爲青年的個人問題且已經成了中國社會上教育上一個很大的問題許多求知知慾很熾而他的天賦和學力又</p>
<p>是可以造就的青年因爲經濟的關係没有升人專門學校或是大學校求學的在中國的社會上真不知有多少即是經濟不成問題了而他有進人專門學校或大學校去求學的機會又不知有多少關於此著者所調查的是極形詳細同時使</p>
<p>我們在此是可以認識青年升學問題的重要</p>
<p>（升學的意義和目的）這是本書的第二章所謂升學是對於某一階段的學程已經修業終了再進一級較高的學校繼續研究學問以外是還含有其它的意義的如我們初步的學程没有基礎升人較高一級的學校也必定是勞而無功這是預備升學的青年最要明白的同時實際上是進了一種高級學校的校内但没有真正從事於學習這種（升而不學）的現象在我國各學校裏無論在何時何地都可以找得出來這種升學還有什麽意</p>
<p>義和價值呢關於這些在青年們就須取得良善的指示才行這即所謂應該有以明瞭（升學的目的）無非是要真正的爲了（增社知識）（研究學術）决不能以求謀學位而滿足其虚榮的這著者在此書裏是有以切實的指示</p>
<p>第三章（升學前的自省）升學原來是一件極其正當的事體所以我們在事前應該先行反省一下雖然升學是青年努力上進的表現是該給予積極鼓勵的可是事實上則有以不然有許多青年因爲升學問題而發生了許多煩惱因爲升學以後反得著失業的結果有些是（悔不當初）有些是（半途而廢）没有終了所以著者提出這個反省問題是非常重要的（一）須考察預備進入的學校其課程和設備如何教授種種方面能否滿足自已求知的慾望（二）經濟有没有相當的準備（三）所修習的課程是否與自已的志願·才力·興趣·相近的學科（四）所修習的學業是不是爲社會上所急切需要的這等問題的提出討論都足爲青年們升學的借鏡加果這樣有意義的（反省）一定不會有上列種種現象的發生</p>
<p>第四章（升學前的準備）這是述（經</p>
<p>濟的準備）與（知識的準備）兩種第五章（怎樣選擇學校）這是升學時期一個最切要的問題選擇的標準（一）學校的設備（二）學校的教授（二）學校的課程（四）學校的納費及其所在地的生活程度（五）將來的出路調查的方法（一）索取章程（二）實地參觀（三）詢問該校的同學或出身該校的教師（四）委託調查假使我們這樣有計劃的做去一定不會徒然的浪費了時間金銀和勞力的了第六章（息樣應付人學考試）（一）要規定複習的程序（二）要注意複習的方法（三）要顧及身心的健康關於臨塲考試時應注意的種種著者亦有詳細例舉第七章（敬告有志學教育的青年）第八章（至第十九章是敬告有志習農業的工業的商業的法律政治的文學的藝術的體育的醫學的新聞學的圖書館學的自然科學的以及家政科等男女青年並附有各學校所設此項學科的詳表足供升學者的參考第二十章（短期學校補習學校和函授學校）這對於經濟力與時期不足應付的青年却有莫大的助益其它如（工讀問題）（自學問題）東西洋各國升學槪况）著者都有詳細的論及</p>

<h3>Dismissal and Reorganization of Jin Troops: Broad Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>Decision to Reorganize Eight Divisions According to Tianjin Agreement</p>
<p>Establishment of Three Garrison Commands</p>
<p>Xu Celebrates Success of Meeting with Generals</p>
<p>Delegates to Carry Full Proposal to Shenyang to Consult with Zhang</p>
<p>Taiyuan: The headquarters meeting concluded at 8 PM on the 31st. During the meeting, representatives explained the opinions of various generals. Some representatives advocated a rotation of commanders. Xu Yongchang, Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Feng Pengzhu, and others repeatedly debated. Zhang, Fu, Chen, and Gao withdrew from the meeting, and the remaining members continued discussions. Shang Zhen and Xu Qian expressed their willingness to relinquish their positions as division commanders and abolish the division commander system, but no decision was reached. (1) It was decided to reorganize the eight divisions according to the Tianjin Agreement. The designated division commanders were Wang Jingguo, Feng Pengzhu, Yang Yaofang, Yang Xiaoou, Li Shengda, Yang Chengyuan, Fu Zuoyi, and others. Sun Chu's troops would be reorganized into a railway protection force. Sun's position as division commander would be filled by Zhang Huizhao or Li Fuying. (2) Three garrison commands would be established in Jinnan, Jinbei, and Taiyuan, to be headed by Rong Honglu, Li Fuying, and Zhang Huizhao, respectively. Each command would oversee two infantry regiments. (3) Each army originally requested to retain ten regiments. Zhang Xueliang of Liaoning agreed to retain 56 regiments. This number was higher than the initial proposal of 60 regiments, and the public raised no objection. (4) The Military Affairs Commission deliberated for a long time due to the lack of consensus among the generals regarding personnel selections. According to someone present at the meeting, if the above proposals could be implemented, the Military Affairs Commission would be organized by Shang Zhen, Xu Qian, Yang Aiyuan, and others, with representatives from each army participating. It was decided that representatives would be sent to Shenyang within days, carrying the full proposal to consult with Zhang Xueliang. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: Xu Yongchang scheduled a banquet at the Shanxi Grand Hotel on the evening of the 1st to host representatives from various Northeastern outposts, Shanxi generals, and Shang Zhen, Yang Aiyuan, Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, Yue Xiangru, and over 40 others, expressing the success of the meeting and celebrating the camaraderie. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: At the headquarters meeting on the 30th, not all division commanders were present. At 3 PM on the 31st, Shang Zhen, Xu Qian, Yang Aiyuan, division commanders, commanders, and representatives Zhang Hanjie, Fu Cunhuai, and others held a final discussion in the headquarters conference hall. The meeting had not adjourned by 7 PM. In recent days, the numbers for the reorganization have been inconsistently reported. It is said that in addition to the four armies, a railway protection force would be established, with Sun Chu as the commander. Specific plans were expected to be decided at today's meeting. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: Song Zheyuan departed for Yuncheng on the morning of the 31st to handle reorganization. Pang Bingxun's departure date has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: Chen Xingya went to Mount Wutai with his entourage for sightseeing on the morning of the 31st. Others were sent to inspect the military police in Suiyuan. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Beiping: Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun to expedite the reorganization. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Shanxi military police were inspected by Chen Ying, and the Suiyuan military police were inspected by Zeng Qinghai. The inspections are expected to be completed within half a month. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Mo Dehui Passes Through Tianjin</p>
<h3>Important Statements Issued</h3>
<p>The Boli Protocol is History</p>
<p>Future Meetings Expected to Proceed Smoothly</p>
<p>Tianjin: Mo Dehui and Torisawa arrived in Tianjin at 3:40 PM today. Accompanied by Wang Shuchang, they rested at the Provincial Government Club and attended a welcoming dinner. They departed Tianjin at 9:30 PM. Important figures from the province and city were present at the station to see them off. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Mo Dehui told reporters, "I was ordered to serve as an envoy to Russia for over eight months. Although only two formal meetings were held, there were dozens of informal negotiations with Soviet representative Karakhan. The details of the correspondence and arguments are likely already known. What I want to say now is that at the first meeting held on October 11th last year, the Soviet representative, citing China's February 8th declaration, demanded clarification regarding the Boli Protocol. Our side insisted that discussions on issues such as the Eastern Railway must be based on legitimate agreements between China and the Soviet Union. After heated debate, no consensus was reached. Ultimately, our procedures were deemed complete, and the meeting proceeded. This is a memorable event in Sino-Soviet relations. After the first formal meeting, I visited Gatchina at Karakhan's invitation to inspect various new construction projects. On November 11th, I received a letter from Karakhan to negotiate several times. I stated the sole point that we must continue to hold meetings to which Karakhan had no objection.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>His reply supported it. Consequently, the second formal meeting was convened on December 8th. Both sides agreed to establish three committees for the Eastern Railway, trade, and resumption of diplomatic relations, and designated specialists. Karakhan did not mention the Boli Protocol again, as it had become history. I fell ill due to the climate in Russia, suffering from eye ailments and skin problems, so I requested leave to return home to report on the negotiations and seek medical treatment. I arrived in Harbin on December 29th. During my eight months in Russia, I failed to achieve my assigned duties and aspirations, which I greatly regret. Fortunately, the meetings have entered a proper course, and future meetings are expected to proceed smoothly. After returning to Harbin, I should have gone to Nanjing immediately, but I entered the railway hospital for treatment for over ten days. The two proposals of using both Chinese and Russian languages and equal employment on the Eastern Railway have been approved by the board of directors and implemented on New Year's Day. Because of the use of both Chinese and Russian languages, many more Chinese employees have been hired. The so-called equal employment has also been achieved. When I went to Russia, I was only responsible for negotiating the Eastern Railway issue, but later, the tasks of restoring transportation and trade were added. These two matters are of great importance, so I must go to Nanjing for instructions. I will stay in Tianjin for a few days before going north for further discussion." (Special dispatch from the 1st) Tianjin: Vice Foreign Minister Wang Jiazhen, Sino-Russian Conference Commissioner Li Chen, and Eastern Railway Board Secretary Wang Zhaoquan arrived in Tianjin from Liaoning at 6:30 AM on the 1st. Wang told reporters that Mo Dehui was originally scheduled to come to Tianjin together, but he changed his plan after consulting with Zhang Xueliang about one issue. He entered the customs with Torisawa on the evening of the 31st and was expected to arrive in Tianjin in the afternoon of the 1st and then depart south at 9:30 PM, expecting to stay for 10 days and then go north within three weeks at most. The Eastern Railway was built during the Russian Imperial era for the purpose of colonization, not for business. Russian was the primary language, and the more employees the better. After Director Mo's repeated efforts, the use of both Chinese and Russian languages was implemented from January 1st, and at the same time, a policy of reduction was implemented, cutting 550 Russian employees and 50 Chinese employees. In the future, if employees need to be added, they will be added according to the principle of equal employment. The Eastern Railway's annual income was over 60 million yuan in previous years. In 1930, due to the low price of Northeast soybeans in Europe, exports were not possible, and the Eastern Railway's income decreased by more than 10 million yuan, and the impact on Northeast commerce and agriculture was even greater. The Sino-Russian Conference is going well, and when the trade and resumption of diplomatic relations committees are opened, the Northeast will recommend Wang Yumei and Zhang Shouzhen as specialists.

<h3>Bandits on the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Flee into Macheng and are Repelled</h3>
<p>Result of Seven Days and Nights of Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>Hankou: According to military news, 30,000 bandits from the border region of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui provinces infiltrated Macheng County.

Li, Bai, Zhang, and others may be given funds by the central government to go abroad. Their troops, numbering about 20,000, are mostly subordinates of Huang and are concentrated in Liuzhou, Nanning, Guilin, and other places.

<h3>Talk of Silver Loan Subsided</h3>
<p>Beiping: Talk of a silver loan from the US has recently subsided. There has been no progress between the US and China. Sources from Citibank indicated that the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce opposed the silver loan, and new members of the silver group were secretly obstructing it. The US-Canadian financial group felt that it was necessary to conduct a thorough study and decided to prepare for a three-month investigation of all aspects before deciding whether to invest. As a result, the US government denied that the silver loan had been negotiated. People from Germany and Japan still say that nine out of ten American loans to China fail. The previous Nishihara Loan was also initiated by the US, but the result was that the Japanese loan was established and the American loan was a pipe dream. This time, nine out of ten American loans will fail. The British Consulate said that the League of Nations had no loan to China and that the misunderstanding was due to the US-Canadian silver loan. The US-Canadian silver group has the International Silver Corporation brand, but in fact, it has nothing to do with the League of Nations. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>

<h3>International Labor Organization's Unemployment Relief Policy</h3>
<p>The Unemployment Committee of the International Labor Bureau in Geneva put forward three major suggestions: first, to formulate a systematic work procedure; second, to hold large-scale public works; and third, to develop a system of assistance to the unemployed, with national appropriations for subsidies when necessary. Recently, efforts to find a way to relieve unemployment have not gone beyond these three areas. However, to implement these three, the first thing to ask is whether the government has any solutions in terms of economics. If there is no solution, then it is just empty talk. The German representative said that Germany did not want to see empty and broad plans, which is not unreasonable. But if, as the representative wished, a method that would take effect immediately and immediately provide work and bread is desired, then it may not be easy to find. At present, various countries are also trying their best to hold construction projects within the country. The effectiveness achieved can only reduce a small part of unemployment. This can be seen from the efforts of the United States and Germany. To hold large-scale public works of an international nature, it is even more necessary to consider how the project relates to the interests of various countries, how economic strength and the distribution of unemployed workers are, and how difficult it is to reach a consensus can be expected. If there is no consensus, it is difficult to cooperate. Moreover, how many so-called large-scale international projects are enough to accommodate these large numbers of unemployed workers? Therefore, the proposal to hold international projects may only be suspended in ideal. The members of the International Labor Bureau are trying their best for the labor side, but the results of the discussions are only like this, and there is no better method than this. It is really not easy to relieve unemployment.</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Illegal Trade</h3>
<p>China Willing to Cooperate with Other Countries</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 31st: The League of Nations Opium Committee met today.

Japanese management methods are still under observation. More detailed information from China has been received, which is a valuable and satisfactory development. In the future, attention should be paid to the use of ships to engage in illegal trade and to the participation of those enjoying special diplomatic privileges in this type of trade. He proposed compiling an international blacklist that includes merchants and customers who have been found to be engaging in or suspected of engaging in illegal trade.

<h3>International Labour Office Discussing Unemployment Issue</h3>
<p>Committee Presents Three Major Recommendations</p>
<p>Industrial Rationalization Under Attack</p>
<p>National Press, Geneva, 31st: The special committee on unemployment established by the International Labour Office officially convened today. Labour and management representatives discussed the issue and reached agreement on several points regarding unemployment relief. There are currently three major recommendations: first, to formulate a systematic work program to absorb a large number of unemployed workers; second, to organize large-scale public works projects; and third, to develop the existing system of assistance for the unemployed, with national subsidies provided when necessary. Opinions on the issues of working hours and wages have not yet been agreed upon, but a resolution has been passed requesting the International Labour Office to conduct an investigation and collect data to assist both parties in reaching agreement on these two issues as well. During the meeting, German representative, Mr. Weiji, explained the unemployment situation in Germany, stating that the unemployed in Germany do not want to see empty and broad plans, but hope to find practical methods that can take effect immediately to provide work and bread. He welcomed the proposal to organize public works projects, but believed that they must be undertaken internationally to effectively absorb a large number of workers. If they are only national in nature, then each country has already done its utmost, and there are few remaining. He then criticized the rationalization that has been prevalent in recent years because it has not taken the workers' side into consideration, causing the current unemployment panic. He also stated that the wages earned by Germans today that are used to pay for social insurance fees have reached 17 percent, which will become unsustainable if this continues. French representative, Mr. Zhu Wu, strongly criticized the plan to reduce wages, stating that the current situation is the result of rationalization. When the capitalists implemented rationalization, they never consulted with the labour side, so the labour side should not be responsible. From the labour side's perspective, the only way to alleviate the current situation is to increase public purchasing power, which can only be achieved by increasing wages.</p>

<h3>Diet Member of Japanese Seiyukai Questions Diplomacy Toward China</h3>
<p>Bilateral Trade for Tanaka Clearing the Case of Zhang's Bombing</p>
<p>Japan's Policy Toward Manchuria and Mongolia Turns from Hard to Soft</p>
<p>Center of Political Warfare Moves to the House of Peers</p>
<p>Entire Cabinet Discusses Countermeasures</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: At the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 31st, Matsuoka (Seiyukai) raised questions about diplomacy toward China and Russia. Foreign Minister Shidehara. Matsuoka asked whether the government had decided to appoint Ambassador Obata as ambassador to China before he went to Germany, and whether the Nationalist government of China agreed and was rejected, but the government did not consider it an insult. Shidehara replied that such questions did not seem appropriate to answer here due to international relations. Matsuoka asked whether the refusal was agreed to be without any reason. Shidehara replied that there was no such thing as not being able to refuse either in theory or in practice. Matsuoka asked regarding the Nanjing Incident, whether the government representatives and the majority of officials and civilians suffered humiliation and indecency, and losses and injuries to property and body, and whether it was still tolerated, or whether it was a great spirit of Japan since the founding of the country. Shidehara replied that the Nanjing Incident was incited by a Communist faction in the Chinese army to resist the Nanjing government, and our officials and civilians suffered its consequences, and the incident could not be regarded as the attitude of the entire Chinese towards Japan. Matsuoka asked regarding the issue of suppressing the Korean Bank of Yiwopu branch, whether the Russian government had issued a contemptuous statement, and whether it was not considered a national humiliation. Shidehara replied that the so-called issuance of a statement was only a message on paper and not a fact. Matsuoka asked whether the Changda Line and the Jihui Line were decided by former South Manchuria Railway President Yamamoto after negotiating with the then Chinese government authorities in Peiping, and whether the current government inherited the fruits of his labor and paid them to nothing, and whether the议会开会期迫乃狼狈遣木村理事着手铁道交涉此种态度非将满铁利益蔑视忘却乎. Shidehara replied that when the current cabinet was formed, the feelings of the Manchurians and Mongolians towards Japan were extremely bad, and shifting the feelings was an urgent matter, so the slight delay in the railway negotiations was due to this. Matsuoka asked that in the current state of Shidehara's weak diplomacy, the subjects of the empire only had to cede from Manchuria and Mongolia, and whether the government should publish the results of the investigation into the bombing of Zhang Zuolin. Shidehara replied that publishing a past event was of no benefit to the country, and there was no need to make it public again.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: The Seiyukai criticized Shidehara's debate with Matsuoka at yesterday's Budget Committee as follows: (1) The essence of Shidehara's weak diplomacy is to put national interests and the welfare of the people second, and to follow other countries first, which has been exposed in his replies; (1) It is gratifying to show that the bombing of Zhang Zuolin has nothing to do with President Tanaka; (1) Although Foreign Minister Shidehara talked about diplomatic economization, he has exposed his lack of economic knowledge and is not a tool for the Prime Minister's office.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: The House of Representatives Budget Committee will complete the general question tomorrow and move to the subcommittee. Even if it is extended again at the request of the opposition party, it can be completed in another two days. The government knows that the center of political warfare will move to the House of Peers. The government officially convened a temporary cabinet meeting at 3:00 p.m. today, Sunday, to decide on the date of submission of the pending bills to this Diet and other matters. In addition, considering the debates in both houses of the Diet over the past ten days, it will also prepare in advance for how to deal with the House of Peers in the future. Although careful replies in the House of Representatives did not cause major problems, the government is quite worried about (1) the legal basis for setting up a Deputy Prime Minister, (1) the relationship between Shidehara's proxy and Prime Minister Hamaguchi's responsibility for the response from the military council, (1) Prime Minister Hamaguchi's and Security Minister Abo's inconsistent remarks on the ratio of large cruisers to the United States in 1936, (1) whether the revenue shortfall in the fiscal 1930 budget will be used to cover the reconstruction bonds after the earthquake, (1) the relationship between the second naval replenishment plan and the tax reduction plan, and (1) the responsibility of Governor-General Ishizuka's resignation and Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda's responsibility in connection with the Wushe Incident, etc. Since there is no absolute majority to rely on in the House of Peers, if the above questions are raised again, the government's weaknesses will be further exposed. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare carefully for the replies. Therefore, today's cabinet meeting will discuss each of the above issues in order to avoid any mistakes.</p>

<h3>Chicago Financial Crisis</h3>
<p>Banks Refuse to Lend</p>
<p>Municipal Funding Unavailable</p>
<p>Associated Press, Chicago, 31st: Chicago, the second largest city in the United States, is currently in a financial crisis. Municipal authorities have no funds to pay the salaries of police, firefighters, school teachers, etc., so they have had to postpone payments for several days. A famous international lawyer,</p>
<p>The director of the Citizens' Relief Association, Strauss, admitted that Chicago is now bankrupt. According to reports, bankers refused to lend to the city government last year, so Strauss negotiated with Chicago stockbrokers to advance US$74 million with local tax revenue certificates as collateral. Afterwards, the municipal authorities did not make efforts to collect taxes to repay the loan, so today, it is feared that no one will be willing to lend any more. However, if considerable funds are not urgently raised, the city will have no police to protect residents, no firefighters to extinguish fires, garbage will accumulate in high piles, no one will clean the streets, and schools will close their doors and no one will teach. Mayor Thompson is currently running around seeking help, but it is not known how to resolve the situation.</p>

<h3>Central Government Orders Abolition of Additional Tax on Anhui Salt</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In the past, when Liu Xing led troops stationed in Anhui Province, he added a temporary military fee of two yuan per stone of southern Anhui Zhejiang salt due to lack of military expenses. Northern Anhui Huai Lu salt catties were exempted from the increase because they were not within Liu's sphere of influence. Afterwards, when the military situation stabilized, Anhui salt merchants repeatedly requested the cessation of the levy, arguing that the tax was temporary, but the province did not approve it. This year, after receiving an order to abolish the Likin tax, provincial chairman Chen Diaoyuan, citing the lack of funds for the provincial defense army, increased the additional tax on Huai Lu salt catties in northern Anhui by 2 yuan and 4 jiao per load. Merchants and people in northern Anhui, unable to bear the burden, sent representatives to Beijing to petition for the abolition of the tax. In addition to telegraphing the National Government to call for a joint appeal, the provincial chamber of commerce also requested the authorities to stop charging the rice tax. Chen Diaoyuan replied that it would be difficult to cancel the additional tax on Southern Anhui salt catties at this time, and since Northern Anhui was also under the jurisdiction of Anhui Province, it would not be appropriate to treat them differently, so the additional tax of 2 yuan and 4 jiao per load was also levied on Huai Lu salt catties to show fairness. The representatives returned without gaining anything, and the chamber of commerce telegraphed Beijing again. Recently, it was heard that the association had received a reply from the Executive Yuan, stating that it had received the telegram requesting the Anhui Provincial Government to abolish the additional tax on new and old salt catties. The telegram stated that the additional tax and levies on salt catties in each province had been transferred to the Ministry of Finance for acceptance in order to separately reduce or exempt and coordinate the arrangements. According to the National Government's clear order, each provincial government had been notified to comply. The original additional tax on salt catties in Anhui Province should await the receipt and reorganization of the Ministry of Finance. The new additional tax on Zhejiang salt in Southern Anhui and Huai Lu salt catties in Northern Anhui had been repeatedly ordered by the Executive Yuan to be abolished by the Provincial Government. It is hoped that you will be informed. However, the province is actively proceeding with the additional tax on salt catties, and it is unknown whether a piece of paper from the central government can be effective. (30th)</p>
<h3>The Situation of Korean People Migrating to the Northeast</h3>
<p>More Than Three Million People Have Migrated</p>
<p>Another 400,000 Planned to Migrate This Year</p>
<p>The Area Around Eastern Jilin Has Become a Korean World</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The remnants of the Three Hans are being oppressed by Japanese imperialism</p>
<p>Their lives are at the mercy of the Governor-General of Korea. There is nothing that the people of a subjugated country can do. However, the Japanese Colonial Affairs Ministry is afraid that the tens of millions of Koreans will be concerned about their homeland and plan to restore their homeland, and it is also afraid that the population will be large and the land will be scarce, which will affect the livelihood of the Japanese people. Therefore, in recent years, it has been vigorously migrating Koreans to our Northeast, freeing up the land in Korea and replacing it with Japanese people. This can not only eliminate the Korean people's thoughts of their homeland, but also alleviate the panic of Japan's population surplus. It can also indirectly realize the plan to colonize and cohabit with our Northeast. It is a win-win situation. Since the 9th year of the Republic of China, more than 3.7 million Koreans have been migrated to the Northeast by the Japanese government, falsely and nominally. The areas where they are distributed can be roughly divided into three regions: one is in Liaoshi. The number in the lower reaches of the Mingeon County of Antong is about 80.</p>

<p>Continued Important News</p>
<p>10,000 are engaged in planting rice and working as workers for timber companies. Most of these people are usually well-behaved. One is the Eastern Railway Harbin-Suifenhe Line to the four border counties of Yanbian, Hunchun, Helong, and Wangqing, with a total number of about 2 million, of which 35% plant paddy fields, 50% are vagrants, and 15% are engaged in illegal businesses. One is the Nenjiang River Basin in Heilongjiang Province and near Heihe, with a number of no more than 300,000, mostly engaged in farming. Among the Koreans in the above three regions, the total number of those who are diligent and law-abiding in agricultural work is more than 1.2 million. The annual productivity is about 11.5 million tons of rice. The land cultivated by them is about 20 million mu. The rice produced is sold in the Northeast is about 4 million tons, and the rest is transported to Japan. The Japanese people rely on it for their food every year. Calculated at a value of 150 yuan per ton, the value of 11 million tons is also considerable. The benefits that Japan obtains from the Korean people every year are not small. In our country, we are invisibly stripped of a part of the production business by the Korean people. According to economic principles, this kind of production is particularly unfavorable to us. As for local security, there are still many difficulties. Koreans residing in the Eastern Province can be roughly divided into three factions: (1) pro-Japanese faction (2) International Communist Party faction (3) Independent Party faction. The strength of the three factions is just like a tripod. However, there is a clear gap between the strength of the Communist Party and the Independent Party. The Communist Party has Yanji, Hunchun, Helong, and Wangqing as its base, while the Independent Party has Xinminfu as its base. The pro-Japanese faction is everywhere. The three factions each have different stances and often engage in secret struggles. If our local authorities interfere slightly, Japan will take the opportunity to use the excuse of the matter of the people to entangle and tangle for many years. The local authorities regard it as a difficult problem, and the provincial government has no ability to help. So far, the power has fallen to the side, and the situation of the guest is easy to change. People in Yanji and other places in eastern Jilin who do not know the situation still think that they are under our territory. If they actually set foot in it, they will know that it is no longer our country's land. The Korean people rely on the Japanese government as a talisman, and there is no taboo. Wherever there are streets and alleys, they are filled with Koreans. Recently, the Korean people have been directed by the Japanese government to invade the Eastern Railway Suifenhe and Jidun roads. This year, there is a plan to migrate 400,000 people. In the future, the number of Koreans coming to the Northeast will increase with Japan. If our country does not have a good plan to stop it, it will not take many years. I am afraid that at least half of northern Manchuria will not actually belong to me. (27th)</p>

<p>The Chambers of Commerce of Various Jiangsu Counties Oppose</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>Tax Rate Exceeds Ministry Stipulations</p>
<p>Please Re-Amend by the Provincial Authorities</p>
<p>After the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations draft was passed by the Provincial Government, business circles in various counties, citing that the standards set in the regulations exceeded the scope of the Ministry's established guidelines and supplementary measures, and that domestically produced goods that should be promoted were classified as luxury and semi-luxury goods subject to the highest tax rates, jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting that the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations draft be sent to the Jiangsu Finance Department for detailed revision. Furthermore, they requested that representatives from various county chambers of commerce be convened promptly to participate in discussions on the differentiation of tax grades. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, requesting that the draft be revised. The two telegrams are transcribed separately below:</p>
<p>Joint Telegram from Various Chambers of Commerce to Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance:</p>
<p>Respectfully reporting that the draft revision of the business tax regulations formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government stipulates that for those calculated based on capital amount, the tax rates mostly adhere to the highest limits for taxation. For those calculated based on business volume, the tax rates are almost all between five per mille and twenty per mille, especially violating Article 4 of the Ministry's established guidelines, which states "For those based on business volume, the tax rate shall not exceed two per mille at most." Moreover, domestically produced goods that should be promoted and daily necessities for the people are treated as luxury and semi-luxury goods and subject to heavy taxes. Reflecting on the fact that merchants and people, after the great pacification of military affairs, those impoverished hope to rise and those withered hope to flourish, but having just celebrated the abolition of likin, they are again subjected to harsh taxes. How can the melons of Huangtai be picked again? How can crucian carp in a dry rut recover? This Chamber and others feel deeply anxious and do not know what to do. Therefore, they dare to earnestly request that the Ministry, based on the intention of abolishing likin and saving the people, order the Jiangsu Finance Department to revise in detail the portions of the draft business tax regulations formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government that violate the established guidelines and supplementary measures promulgated by the Ministry. Furthermore, the Jiangsu Provincial Government should promptly convene representatives from various chambers of commerce to participate in discussions to establish extremely fair regulations regarding the differentiation of tax grades so that both the upper and lower levels benefit without any drawbacks, and the new tax can be easily implemented. If it is only based on the needs of government expenses and thus inevitably taking from the people, the consequences are beyond what this Chamber dares to say. This urgent submission is made in the hope that your Ministry will take note, swiftly implement it, and ensure public convenience. This telegram is publicly promoted with the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce taking the lead in affixing its seal. The seals of the Chambers are jointly presented and clarified.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce, Tongchonghaitai General Chamber of Commerce, Wuxi, Xinghua, Weining, Danyang, Jiading, Funing, Kunshan, Peixian, Jiangdu, Yixing, Songjiang, Pixian, Suqian, Siyang, Jiangyin, Ganyu, Qingpu, Nanhui, Chuansha, Taixian, Jiangpu, Gaoyou, Yizheng, Liuhe, Yancheng, Jingjiang, Gaochun, Haimen, Huaiyin, Jinshan, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Wujin, Changshu, Qidong, Baoying, Lishui, Dongtai, Jintan, Liyang, Tongshan, Baoshan, Jurong, Lianshui, Huaian and other county chambers of commerce, Zhenze, Pingwang, Fengjing, Minhang, Nanxiang, Shengze, Sishui, Longtan, Yilin, Shaobo, Xianzhen, Jinle District and other town chambers of commerce, respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce to the Jiangsu Provincial Government:</p>
<p>Respectfully informing that this Chamber has received petitions from the thirty-two trade guilds under its jurisdiction, stating that after reviewing the newspaper report on the business tax regulations draft formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the tax standards and the listed tax rate table clearly differ greatly from the established guidelines and supplementary measures of the Ministry. Merchants, after the devastation and having just celebrated the abolition of likin, it seems that the government should not bear to levy heavy taxes. It is presumed that due to the urgency of the timeline and the province's pressing need for funds, the standards set were not equitable. Even matters that should be uniformly followed according to the Ministry's established guidelines and supplementary measures have inevitably been exceeded. However, at the beginning of legislation, there may be areas that were not adequately considered. If changes are only discussed when progress is hindered, then there will be no way to demonstrate adherence to the law and there is also a fear of losing credibility. How about adding further careful and thorough review? Regarding the tax rate, it should fully follow the Ministry's established guidelines and supplementary measures, with the scope being that the tax rate for those based on business volume should not exceed two per mille at most. Regarding the differentiation of tax grades, representatives from various chambers of commerce should be convened promptly to participate in discussions to ensure that there are equitable regulations. Considering the disaster of likin, merchants tremble with fear and cannot help but earnestly request that you forward this to the Provincial Government to revise the draft and quickly convene various chambers of commerce to participate in deciding the standards for tax grades. Based on this, this Chamber believes that the concerns of the trade guilds are very urgent and dares not withhold this information from above. Therefore, this telegram is respectfully submitted in the hope that you will condescend to implement it to comfort the merchants and people. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>

<p>The Fei Family Robbery Case in Dayangzhuang:</p>
<p>On the 29th of last month at around 11 PM, the home of farmer Fei Azhao and Fei Xiaobianzi, located in the sixteenth district of Dayang in the southern countryside of Tinglin, was suddenly stormed by over fifty bandits. They swarmed into the house and began searching and robbing. Azhao's four-year-old daughter was kidnapped as they left. In addition to cash, foreign clothing, and jewelry being robbed, they also kidnapped Tiandan, who worked in the fields. Azhao begged for the release of the hostage, but the demand was ineffective. The same actions were taken at Fei Xiaobianzi's house, and Xiaobianzi's son, AGen, was also kidnapped. After about an hour, they gathered the stolen goods, carried the hostages, and fled towards Yinglongmiao. It is said that the two Feis are uncle and nephew, and the losses are considerable.</p>
<p>Meeting Minutes from Ping County:</p>
<p>The county handled famine relief last year, which was managed by various districts. The funds were disbursed from the grain storage association from the surplus grain funds, amounting to 72,000 yuan. After the famine relief concluded, the Famine Relief Headquarters reviewed it. At a meeting held on the 1st, it was reported that 15,078 shi of rice were sold, which did not match the original number of shi to be sold. As a result, the grain storage association reported to the county government.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Tragic News of Three Sons Dying in Three Hours:</p>
<p>Recently, the weather in the county has been abnormal, leading to the outbreak of an epidemic in the city. Zhang Yunchu, owner of Yuxing Silver Shop on East Street in the city, had three sons. One of them suddenly contracted throat distemper. Zhang Yunchu mistakenly thought it was smallpox and did not pay attention. Yesterday morning (the 1st) at 6 AM, one son suddenly died. By 7 AM, another son also died. By 8 AM, another son had died. All three sons died one after another within two hours. They couldn't even buy coffins in time. Zhang's wife, overwhelmed with grief for her sick children, became unconscious. It can be described as tragic.</p>
<p>Fire at the Sheepskin Scroll:</p>
<p>At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Wang Zhengqing, a tenant of Li Guirong, a resident of the sheepskin scroll area near Yuanluo Nunnery outside the East Gate of the county. At the time, all the men, women, old, and young of the Li and Wang families were sound asleep. When they heard the alarm, they tried to escape but were unable to prevent the tragedy. The fire brigade responded to the alarm and made every effort to extinguish the fire. The fire destroyed three rooms, and the total loss to both parties is estimated to be over 10,000 yuan. It is said that the fire was caused by embers from a foot warmer.</p>
<p>Details of a Civil Affairs Inspector's Seduction of a Married Woman:</p>
<p>In order to rectify police affairs, Hu, the Director of Civil Affairs, specially sent Zhou, a native of Yixing, to various counties to inspect police affairs. On the 24th of last month, after Zhou arrived in Wuxi from the province, he stayed at the New World Hotel. Wang Chongxi, Director of the 8th Public Security Bureau, and Qin Enrui, a member of the 3rd Public Security Bureau, accompanied Zhou. Zhou felt lonely in the hotel, so Director Wang introduced Wang Lihong, a prostitute, to accompany him. For three nights, they exchanged sweet words and affection. Zhou also invited Zhou Qizhen (20 years old, a native of Yixing), the concubine of Shen Xiang, who lived in Niushi Lane, for two nights of illicit relations. Finally, he introduced Xingzhen, hoping that Committee Member Zhou would have illicit relations for two nights. Zhou then went to Suzhou with Xingzhen. Later, Xingzhen's husband, Shen Xi, discovered this and tracked them down to Room 80 of the Dongwu Hotel outside the city gate, where he reported the pair to the police and arrested them. The patrolman Wang Shiyi tried to mediate, offering 50 yuan for a private settlement, but Shen Xiang refused. Patrolman Wang then said, "This is a Committee Member of the Department of Civil Affairs, I cannot handle it," and other similar remarks. Shen Xiang had no choice but to sign a statement and take Xingzhen back. Committee Member Zhou then went to Wujiang. When Shen Xiang returned to Wuxi the day before yesterday, he recalled the previous events and was dissatisfied. He twisted Xingzhen and took her to the police station of the 2nd Public Security Bureau to issue a loss report, stating, "One pair of gold bracelets, one gold chain, two gold rings, one set of gold buttons, two rings inlaid with gemstones, one gold necklace, one gray fur coat, one Tan fur coat, and one Huada single shirt," requesting an investigation and ordering the arrest of the prostitute Wang Lihong, who was involved in the illicit affair, for interrogation. After receiving the report, Sun, Director of the branch station, immediately sent police officers to summon Wang Lihong to the station to conduct a preliminary hearing with Shen Xiang, Zhou Xingzhen, and others.</p>
<p>Zhang Shuping, the acting section chief of the Judiciary Section, held a trial at 4 PM yesterday afternoon. First, Shen Xiang testified about his pursuit of Committee Member Zhou and Zhou Xingzhen in Suzhou, claiming that jewelry and other items had been swept away. Then, Zhou Xingzhen and Wang Lihong were questioned. The two Zhou and Wang fully revealed their illicit relations with Committee Member Zhou and did not conceal anything. After the interrogation, Shen Xiang, Zhou Xingzhen, and Lihong were each ordered to provide a guarantor to await further summons and investigation. However, after the case occurred, it has caused a sensation in the city, the case has expanded, and the situation is serious. It is now heard that Xu, the Director of Public Security, intends to meet with County Magistrate Pan to submit a report to Chairman Ye of the Provincial Government and Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions and handling.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Villagers Entering the City and Local Hoodlums Extorting:</p>
<p>Huang Chongyao, a resident of Dayi in the ninth district of the county, came to the city on the 28th and went to the home of Li Zhusun downstairs in the Dafang Hotel in the north city center. There were several smoking devices in Li's room. It is said that while Huang was smoking, hoodlums Hu Changnian and Zhang Jinan suddenly entered the room, pulled out their guns, and threatened him, saying that he had to pay 300 yuan. Huang had no cash at the time and asked to write a promissory note. As a result, Zhu Zongqing, who lived with him, came forward to mediate and ordered Huang to write a promissory note for 150 yuan. Zhu and Hu took a gold bracelet and a gold ring from Li Zhusun's house. Afterwards, Huang filed a complaint with the Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation of the threat and coercion of writing the note by Hu and others. However, Hu and others learned of this and had someone discuss it with Huang, willing to reduce the amount and settle the matter. They negotiated on the 29th night in Room 94 of the Daxin Hotel and settled for 70 yuan. At the request of Huang, the Public Security Bureau closed the original case. Since Hu and others threatened with guns, the situation necessitates detention and interrogation.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Investigates the Opium Case:</p>
<p>On the 28th, the local newspaper reported that the Jiangyin Detective Team had seized a large amount of opium, over 800 catties (or 50 catties), in Shanquan Lake in Changshu. However, the county government and the Public Security Bureau had not heard of this. Moreover, the county only has Shanqian Lake (about three miles from the city), and there is no Chuquan Lake. Is Shanquan Lake actually Shanqian Lake? After reading the report, the county magistrate was quite surprised and also asked why the Jiangyin Detective Team did not coordinate with the local armed forces when coming to Changshu to seize the opium. Therefore, on the 30th, he sent a letter to Shen Zihan, the county magistrate of Jiangyin, to inquire about the details.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Graduation Ceremony Held for the Current Class of the Police Academy:</p>
<p>The training period for the current class of the Police Academy's training course for land and water public security personnel is set at six months. It has been fully completed since it began in August last year. Examinations were held from January 19th to 25th, and all 146 current land and water students performed very well. In addition to the school submitting a request to the Department of Civil Affairs to return them to their original positions, a graduation ceremony was held in the school's auditorium at 9 AM yesterday (the 31st).</p>
<p>Bandits Rampant in Tangjia Village, Shangdang:</p>
<p>At 7 PM on the 28th of last month, over twenty bandits suddenly arrived at Tangjia Village and other places in Shangdang, Zhenjiang. Each carrying a quick-firing gun, they looted at will and kidnapped over thirty villagers. Nearby villages were also ransacked.</p>
<p>Wang Qigui, the village head of Dongtang Village, heard the alarm and led the local militia to strike a head-on blow, and the bandits were finally unable to withstand the attack and retreated. In addition to rescuing over ten hostages, nineteen people were still kidnapped, including six from Tangjia Village and thirteen from Shangdang.</p>
<p>Police Team Dispatched to Gaozi to Suppress Bandits:</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Police Team received instructions from the county government yesterday to dispatch a team to Gaozi to assist in suppressing bandits. After receiving the order, the team leader immediately ordered Wang, the second squad leader, to lead the entire second squad of police officers to Gaozi at 2 PM yesterday afternoon to assist Guo army Ding Yousong in the suppression.</p>
<p>Mao Jing Being Escorted to Suzhou:</p>
<p>Mao Jing, the former Director of the Dongtai Public Security Bureau, was sentenced to two years in prison by the Zhenjiang Court for corruption in office. Mao appealed, and yesterday, the High Court sent personnel to escort him to Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Meeting on Business Tax:</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce executive supervisors and representatives of various trade guilds and member shops gathered at the Chamber of Commerce at 10 AM on the 31st for a joint meeting to discuss business tax measures. Wang Jingtang chaired the meeting. The results of the discussion were: (1) Regarding the Finance Bureau's letter urging the preparation of business tax and requesting the filling out of declaration forms, it was decided that, as the business season is coming to an end, a letter should be sent to the Bureau requesting a temporary postponement of the declaration. (2) Regarding the number of members of the Business Tax Regulations Research Committee, it was decided to have eleven members, and Hu Xinxiao, Yu Wenqu, Jiang Yunqiu, Dai Jingshan, Guo Lanshi, Sun Yaozhang, Huang Yizhi, Shi Ruizhen, Teng Yizhai, Ruan Lianzhong, and Zhu Chuhe were recommended as members. It was decided that Committee Hu would convene a meeting at 10 AM on the 2nd.</p>
<p>The issue of Guan Dai being removed from the Yangguan opening tax employees:</p>
<p>Except for Zhou, the customs tax secretary and other five people who will be temporarily retained to handle the aftermath, the remaining employees of the customs were all paid and dismissed at 10 AM on the 31st.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Bandit Boat Attacks Xiabazi Bridge, Disturbing Yangzhou Area. Bandit boats have been appearing sporadically in the various ports along the Yangtze River in recent days. A few days ago, they were sighted twice near the Yu Huang Temple in the 60-li market of Xiazhou. Each time, local villagers raised the alarm, causing the bandits to retreat. However, on the 27th, three more bandit boats sailed into the port of Xiabazi Bridge, intending to loot the town. Fortunately, the security patrol noticed them and fired earthen cannons to warn the town. Unexpectedly, the bandit boats returned fire with volleys of gunfire, and the two sides exchanged fire for an hour. Realizing that the town was prepared, the bandit boats then sailed eastward.</p>
<p>Magistrate Xu Cannot Leave. Xu Zusheng, the magistrate of Yangzhou County, has resigned and received approval from the provincial government. It is learned that Xu originally planned to leave Yangzhou today (the 30th), leaving his secretary to handle the handover. However, after various sectors received advance notice on the evening of the 29th, they dispatched more than sixty people to secretly guard the various wharf ports such as Shajia Port, Nanmatou, and Dongxing Port to settle accounts with him, preventing Xu from leaving. On the 30th, demands for payment flooded the county government, including education fees, construction fees, party expenses, and other minor items. However, the largest discrepancy was the collection of reed taxes. The total quota for Yangzhou County was 18,000 taels, discounted to 14,400 taels. The upper-level collectors levied 6 yuan of silver per tael, while the lower-level collectors levied 5 yuan of silver per tael. According to this year's actual collection, it is rumored that more than 80% has been collected, but the reported amount is only 50%. This inside information is known to local gentry members such as Mr. Wang, Mr. Du, and Mr. Liu. Calculating a 30% difference per year, there is a discrepancy of 4,320 taels. Moreover, Xu has been in office for two years, so the amount is likely to be even higher. There are also forty bales of bandit loot, silkworm cocoons seized at Xiabazi Bridge last year. After administrative meetings, it was decided to auction them off to fund the Erdunzi Port project. Xu then sent his wife's younger brother, Sun Zigang, to negotiate the sale. This amount is also more than 10,000 yuan. Now that the port has not been opened, the money should be accounted for. As Xu is about to leave office, he should make a clear accounting. It is heard that Xu is quite anxious because he cannot get away and is currently asking people to mediate with all parties, hoping to leave peacefully. However, the public hopes that there will be a formal accounting and that all the facts will be made public. Private negotiations would be puzzling.</p>
<p>Jin Zhou's Rent Collection Comes Again to Yangzhou County. The Jinzhou school property rent was ordered by the Education and Finance Departments to be taken over and collected by the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau, Yangzhou County Education Bureau, Zhenjiang Middle School, and other three institutions. The county government's deadline for handover at the end of last year was again blocked by Zhou people's petitions, resulting in no takeover until now. Seeing that Yangzhou County Magistrate Xu Zusheng is about to leave office, Zhenjiang has once again sent representatives such as Xue Zhenglin to Yangzhou. On the morning of the 30th, they met with Wang Jun, the head of the general affairs section of the Yangzhou Education Bureau, and jointly visited Magistrate Xu at the county government, demanding the takeover. Xu replied that he would hand over the matter as soon as he found Wang Houqing, the tax collection agent of the Zhou tax collection bureau. Therefore, Representative Xue is still waiting in the hotel, unsure when he will be able to take over.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Eleven Political Prisoners in the Fourth Prison to be Pardoned. The Jiangsu Fourth Prison received an order from the High Court to investigate and identify political prisoners in custody who meet the requirements for pardon under the Great Amnesty Law of the 20th year of the Republic.

Warden Sun Wei has now identified eleven political prisoners who meet the requirements of Article 8 of the Amnesty Law, including Zhu Yinshu, Li Haitai, Tao Xiaohe, Ding Yuan, Zhang Chaoxuan, Cao Huang, Jiang Dong, Song Buzhang, Ji Guangsheng, Zhu Jinkui, and Ding Fei. The report has been submitted for review and approval.</p>
<p>Large Number of Bandit Corpses Found on the Lvsi Beach. Two gangs of sea bandits, Yan Zhen and Zhong Zhao, clashed again on the sea off Lvsi. Zhong's gang was almost wiped out. Eighty-four bandit corpses were found washed up on the Zhenhai beach in the northern part of the Third District. They were all swept in by the tide. Recently, Yan has expressed his willingness to accept government recruitment.</p>
<p>Military, Political, and Police Hold Defense Meeting. Representatives from military, political, and police agencies in Tongyi County held a defense meeting at the county government on the 31st. They resolved to implement a ten-household system in all districts of the county, with patrols and sentry posts. Water and land transportation may be temporarily restricted when necessary. The remaining measures for preventing and suppressing sea bandits cannot be disclosed.</p>
<p>Bandit Executed for Kidnapping Case in Luhongzha. Yang Guofang, a bandit involved in the kidnapping of six male and female hostages from a lumberyard and pig farm in Luhongzha, south of the city, was apprehended by detectives. He has now been tried by the county court and sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>District Chief Suspended for Accepting Bribes, Investigation to Be Conducted. Wu Zaitang, Yao Duo, and other citizens of Baipu District reported that Qin Qilaizi, the son of farmer Qin Tiesan from Jiangyuan Township, was arrested by a group of more than ten security guards dispatched by Zhang Duzhen, the district chief of Baipu District, Gu Jiren, the township chief, and Yuan Duanmu, the Jiangyuan Township chief. Gu Jiren and Yuan Duanmu colluded to instruct the citizen to pay 1,200 yuan to resolve the matter. Qin, fearing punishment, complied and paid the money. The money was then divided among District Chief Zhang and others. After receiving the money, the district chief released Qin Qilaizi. Yao Xinglin was also arrested by them and released after paying a bribe of more than 80 yuan. Yesterday, the facts of the district chief and township chief's acceptance of bribes were reported to the county government for strict investigation. It is heard that after receiving the report, the county government, considering that the case involved public officials accepting bribes, the truth of which should be thoroughly investigated, has suspended District Chief Zhang and transferred the case to the judiciary for interrogation and investigation. Chu Bingyi has been appointed to temporarily fill the vacancy. The old district chief has been ordered to hand over the office immediately, and District Chief Chu has been ordered to proceed to Suiyi for inspection and receipt.</p>
<p>Gu Renwu, a Notorious Bandit from Rutai, Arrested. Gu Renwu, a notorious bandit leader from Rutai and other counties, has repeatedly committed arson and looting. In the year before last, he led his gang to burn down public institutions such as the district office and public security sub-bureau in the 16th district of this county. The number of civilian houses he burned is countless. The people of this county have long hated him to the bone. However, the bandit is extremely cunning and took the opportunity to surrender superficially, but in reality, he continued his activities as usual. After surrendering, he remained unrepentant and became even more reckless. He often opened celebratory ceremonies and privately collected armed donations to plan a major operation. The Tai County government believed that the bandit leader must be eliminated to clear the root of the banditry and that his evil deeds were so numerous that execution was necessary to appease the people and warn the wicked. Therefore, it telegraphed the county government of this county for assistance in arresting him. The county government immediately ordered the county police to secretly arrest him and bring him to justice. Yesterday, Gu Zubo, the captain of the tenth squad of the fourth detachment of the county police, followed the order and arrested the bandit leader Gu Renwu and his accomplices, Zhu Hengqing, and brought them to the county government for legal action.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The 25th Route Command Headquarters, stationed in Qingjiang, previously used ten military vehicles to operate a long-distance bus service. The original routes were Gao (Gaoyou), Bao (Baoying), Huai (Huai'an), Huai (Huaiyin), Lian (Lianshui), Si (Siyang), Su (Suqian), and Mu (Muyang), and the business was quite prosperous. Now, in order to expand transportation and facilitate merchants and travelers, the Suqian route has been extended to Xuzhou and the Puyang route to Haizhou. Passengers generally praise the convenience.</p>
<p>The Construction Department has now appointed Zhu Dafu to Gaoyou to oversee and manage the land tax donation and to investigate the collection and preservation of current and previous outstanding amounts. Commissioner Zhu arrived in Gaoyou last night and went to the Finance Bureau this morning to meet with Director Yang to discuss all matters.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Highway Workers Disturbing the Peace. The section of highway from Pinghu to Zhapu has recently been built to Behelou outside the Dananmen of Pinghu, six li from the city. However, these workers are acting violently. They previously committed robberies along the road when constructing in Zhapu. Although the manager has strictly restrained them, their wild nature has not been completely tamed. Currently, they are causing great disturbance to the villagers in the Behelou area. The workers are borrowing rice from farmers by force and recklessly cutting down trees along the road to sell for money. Yesterday, more than twenty villagers who were victimized went to the landlords in the city to complain bitterly.</p>
<p>Pirates Discovered on the Zhapu Coast. Five or six pirate ships have recently been discovered patrolling the waters off Caiqi Port near Zhapu, Pinghu. On the afternoon of the 30th, a merchant ship sailing to Zhapu, while traveling to Caiqi Gate, was stopped by a pirate ship. The merchant ship, knowing that it had encountered pirates, immediately unfurled its sails, turned the rudder, and sped away, narrowly escaping. It is heard that the Zhapu business community plans to telegraph the offshore patrol fleet, requesting them to send troops to patrol the area.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Power Plant Transferred to Syndicate Management. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has officially mortgaged the Hangzhou Power Plant to the Shanghai-Hangzhou banking community for 5.5 million yuan to meet various needs. The power plant's operations have also been transferred to the management of the Shanghai-Hangzhou banking syndicate. Wang Xiaolai, Pan Mingxin, Zhang Zaiyang, and Wang Zhuzhai are the main directors, and Zhang Zaiyang has been elected as the managing director. Yi Dingxin remains the factory director, and there have been no changes in the plant's staff. The entertainment movie theater also remains the same. However, it is heard that the actual amount is only 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Deadline Set for Completion of All Seawall Repairs. The Construction Department, noting that the seawalls along the Hangzhou-Haiyan-Shaoxing sections have suffered much damage and erosion due to improper construction methods over the years and are unable to withstand the impact of storm tides, and with the spring season approaching and the danger of rising spring tides imminent, has ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to formulate plans, determine costs, and complete the repairs of the dangerous seawall sections within three months, using compressed air grouting to ensure their solidity. The costs for each section have also been set, and construction will begin on all sections as soon as the special funds are allocated.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Beggars Occupying Temples and Shrines. The Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that temples and shrines in the city are often occupied by beggars as places to live and sleep, and that the corpses and filth are not only unsightly but also easily lead to fires. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly crack down on this phenomenon. It has ordered the district offices to strictly crack down and send these beggars to welfare homes.</p>

<h3>Important News: Ministry of Education Review</h3>
<p>Regulations on Pensions for Teachers and Staff in Beijing</p>
<p>Reply to Nanjing Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education replied to the Nanjing Municipal Government regarding the review of the Nanjing Municipal School Teacher and Staff Pension Regulations: "Having reviewed the Nanjing Municipal Government's consultation on the draft Nanjing Municipal School Teacher and Staff Pension Regulations submitted by the Municipal Education Bureau, which proposes modifying the standards and years of service for pension payments stipulated in the Central Government's Regulations on Pensions for Teachers and Staff due to their perceived length and expense, it appears that the bureau intends to supplement the National Government's Regulations on Old-Age Pensions and Pensions for Teachers and Staff by proposing a separate set of regulations for Nanjing Municipality, allowing teachers and staff with shorter service years to receive a smaller pension upon death. This approach does not conflict with the law, and it is feasible if the Nanjing Municipal Government's budget can accommodate it. However, the phrase 'in addition to complying with the Central Government's regulations' in the first article of the regulations should be changed to 'in addition to complying with the provisions of the National Government's Regulations on Old-Age Pensions and Pensions for Teachers and Staff for those who die after ten years of continuous service or due to work-related causes.' Regarding the proposal to modify the Regulations on Old-Age Pensions and Pensions for Teachers and Staff, these regulations were promulgated by the National Government and should be uniformly observed throughout the country. Changes should not be made lightly. Approval is granted in response to your consultation. Please review and instruct compliance."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Strictly Orders Jiangdu County Bureau to Raise Education Funds</h3>
<p>And Orders Persuasion of School Principals to Resume Classes First</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department has repeatedly received reports from Zhuge Guangzhao and other principals of urban and rural primary schools in Jiangdu County stating that education funds have been in arrears for five months, making it difficult to maintain operations, and requesting assistance. In addition to issuing instructions, the Jiangsu Education Department has specifically ordered the Jiangdu County Government to swiftly raise funds to provide relief. The original text is as follows: (1) Jiangsu Provincial Education Department Order No. 125 to the Jiangdu County Government: "According to reports from primary school principals such as Zhuge Guangzhao and primary school teachers such as Jiang Heji, the county's education funds are in arrears for five months, making it impossible to maintain operations, and all primary schools in the county have gone on strike. Please provide instructions.' Having reviewed these reports, it is noted that the county's education funds are reportedly in arrears for more than 70,000 yuan as of the 18th year of the Republic. As a result, the operating funds of various schools have been in arrears for more than five months. If these arrears are due to non-payment of grain taxes, the county's Finance Bureau Director should be strictly supervised to pursue collection. Even if the arrears are due to non-payment by the people, strict urging should be carried out so that education funds are not affected in the slightest. The County Magistrate has the responsibility to supervise the county's finances and education. Since he has usually been inattentive to the arrears of education funds, he should immediately make proper rescue measures and not allow the situation to develop into a teaching strike, so as not to fail in his supervisory responsibilities. Now that the county is in the midst of a prosperous collection period, he should first raise three months of education funds in the shortest possible time to provide relief. The previous arrears should be urged by the Finance Bureau to expedite collection so that they can be transferred for distribution. At the same time, he should persuade the schools to resume classes immediately to avoid the cessation of education throughout the county, and supervise the Directors of the County Finance and Education Bureaus to promptly devise a repayment plan for the previous deficits in accordance with the Department's clearing methods and submit it for review. In addition to issuing instructions and orders, the original reports are copied and sent to the County Magistrate for compliance and immediate reporting of the compliance situation for verification. In addition, regarding the report from primary school teachers such as Jiang Heqing that more than 17,000 yuan of funds have been raised but the Education Bureau is not distributing them, he is to investigate and report on the actual situation and the reasons for it as soon as possible. This order." (2) Jiangsu Provincial Education Department Order No. 367 to the Jiangdu County Education Bureau: "According to reports from primary school principals Zhuge Guangzhao, Jiang Heqing, and others that classes cannot be resumed due to five months of education fund arrears and requesting that the arrears be cleared, it is noted that the County Magistrate has been ordered to raise three months of education funds in the shortest possible time to provide relief and to persuade the school heads to resume classes first. You are to consult with the County Magistrate to properly handle the matter and report for verification. This order." (3) Order No. 161 to the Jiangdu County Government: "According to the report from primary school principals Zhuge Guangzhao and others that the authorities are perfunctorily handling the one-week suspension of classes and are not pursuing the arrears, it is requested that a deadline be set for the pursuit of arrears to ensure livelihoods. Having reviewed this report, it is noted that the amount of education funds that have been collected but not remitted and those that should be remitted but are being deliberately withheld is more than 49,000 yuan. If this is the case, what is the use of these funds? A thorough investigation should be carried out. At a time when education funds are extremely scarce, in addition to the previous order instructing the County to promptly raise three months of education funds to provide relief, all funds that have been collected, should be remitted but have not been remitted, and should be collected but have not been collected should be promptly and accurately investigated, and the Finance Bureau should be strictly ordered to clear and remit the amounts on a deadline and transfer them to the Education Bureau for distribution. If there are any cases of embezzlement or misappropriation by the yamen clerks, strict pursuit and severe punishment should be carried out. At the same time, schools should be persuaded to resume classes immediately in accordance with the previous order to avoid the prolonged absence of children from school. The County Magistrate failed to pay special attention beforehand and should take proper remedial measures afterwards and not fail in his duties. The compliance situation should still be reported immediately for verification. This order."</p>
<h3>Superintendents and Education Committee Members in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Are Absolutely Prohibited from Concurrently Holding Positions within the Bureau</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department Has Submitted a Request for Instructions for Implementation</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Has Resolved to Act Accordingly</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Education Department Document No. 24 to the Provincial Government states: "Having reviewed Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Jiangsu Province Education Bureau Organizational Regulations, which stipulates that section chiefs or staff members may concurrently serve as county superintendents or district education committee members without additional compensation, it is noted that this is a continuation of the old Central University system. However, it is considered that the duties of county superintendents and district education committee members are to inspect and guide education affairs in the entire county or various school districts. Their duties are heavy and their responsibilities are significant. If they are allowed to concurrently hold positions within the bureau, it is inevitable that there will be neglect. Now, in order to emphasize the duties of these officials, it is proposed that county superintendents and district education committee members be absolutely prohibited from concurrently holding positions within or outside the bureau. It is proposed that Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the organizational regulations of the education bureaus of various counties be immediately deleted. If any county education bureau has already followed the regulations and submitted a request for approval, it should be ordered to remove the concurrent officials immediately after the aforementioned article is deleted, and the bureaus should be ordered to follow the burden and present it for review and commission to fill the remaining concurrent official vacancies. Regarding the revision of the regulations, it is appropriate to submit a document requesting your review, approval, deliberation, instruction for implementation, and public convenience. With regards to hiring and recruitment, a tea party was held at the China News Agency at 3:00 PM yesterday (February 1st) to welcome the faculty and staff, and sixty people attended. Dr. Ma delivered a speech on the spot, declaring that it is his responsibility to be responsible, and now that there are rumors circulating in the Central Public, he is even more willing to take on the responsibility to live up to the expectations of the one thousand and hundreds of students who are seeking knowledge. Now that he has had the opportunity to gather with everyone, he would like to express his sincere gratitude. Li Qingya then spoke to express his appreciation for Dr. Ma's feelings and said that the Central Public has always had an organization called the faculty and staff union, but last fall, there was a misunderstanding between the faculty and staff, which led to the withdrawal of the members. This was seen in the Central Public Weekly as a pity and should be restored in order to strengthen the connection. Moreover, the current semester is about to begin, and the old members' positions have changed due to the expiration of their contracts. Therefore, the faculty and staff should be reorganized to include both teachers and staff. Therefore, taking advantage of today's gathering, the participants are requested to decide on the issue. This was supported by a majority of the participants, and nine people, including Li Qingya and Pan Guangdan, were elected as members of the standing committee, and four people, including Yang Honglie, were elected as alternates. The committee's charter will continue to be implemented according to the existing regulations. Four items were also resolved: (1) The standing committee will declare the truth about the student unrest to all sectors of society. (2) The standing committee will personally present the various developments to the school directors. (3) The standing committee will publish a notice in the newspaper to inform all sectors of society about the establishment of the association. (4) The teaching affairs office, general affairs office, and library will each be responsible for accurately counting the number of documents lost from the former teaching affairs office."</p>
<h3>Renovation of Jinan School Journal Contents</h3>
<p>The National Jinan University School Journal has always been printed by the Publishing Group, with an internal emphasis on administrative news. Now, the Publishing Group has been reorganized and merged with the Lecture Notes Group into the Printing Group, and the School Journal is now compiled and printed by this group. From the 101st issue onwards, the contents will be greatly renovated, including: Orders, Official Letters, Announcements, Commemorative Weeks, News from Various Colleges, Important News from Various Departments, Overseas Correspondence, Society Scenes, Meeting Minutes, Sports News, Financial Status, Information on Graduate Services, Overseas Chinese Light (divided into Anecdotes, Notes, Discussions, etc.). In terms of format, it has also been changed from a bound book to a single sheet, which not only saves printing costs but also reduces postage.</p>
<h3>Photography Lecture Conference Held Today</h3>
<p>In recent years, photography in our country has been extremely developed, and the number of researchers has gradually increased. However, there is a lack of opportunities to gather together and exchange ideas. The China Photography Association has always been committed to promoting photography and is the largest photography organization in the country. Following the example of photography societies in various countries, it is heard that today (the 2nd) at 5:30 PM, the first photography lecture conference of this year will be held at the China Harmonica Association on the upper floor of Shuimingchang Furniture Store at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road. Mr. Gao Zixiang, the secretary of the association who specializes in photography after returning from Germany, will speak on the topic of "The Technology of Photography". Mr. Wang Shilian, a member of the Black and White Photography Society who studied in France, will speak on the topic of "Portrait Photography", and Mr. Xiang 'an, a member of the society, will speak on the topic of "The Modification Method of Art Connoisseurs". The three lectures are completely open to the public, and all photography enthusiasts are welcome to attend freely without the need for a ticket. For out-of-towners, a postage of four cents can be attached to a letter requesting the text of the lecture to be sent to 56 Nanjing Road, Photography Express.</p>
<h3>The Second Day of the White Goose Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the 5th White Goose Practice Exhibition. It happened to be a Saturday afternoon and the weather was pleasant. More than a thousand people attended the exhibition, including artists and literati such as Hua Linyu, Daoyuan, Zhang Ruogu, Hu Daozhi, Qiu Daiming, Fan Xinqiong, Liang Desuo, and Wu Liande. Mr. Mo Tianxiang, a photography reporter from the Shen Bao Pictorial Weekly Department, also took a group photo of Chen Fang, Pan Du, and the four gentlemen, as well as a general view of the exhibition hall. As for the exhibition of practice works, there is a kind of old-fashioned spirit that can add appropriate attention to composition, lines, light and shadow, and colors, revealing a lively atmosphere and breaking through the inherent records of previous exhibitions. More than a hundred excellent works guided by the institute have been displayed, and many people have expressed their intention to purchase them separately. However, the association has not determined the price of each work on display, and the original authors generally do not intend to sell them, resulting in a lingering reluctance to leave.</p>

<h3>Lehua Loses Exhaustively in Yesterday's Westerner's First Division Match</h3>
<p>Two to Four in the First Half, Two to Two in the Second Half</p>
<p>Final Score Four to Six, Races Wins. The Lehua Football Team played against Races in the Westerners' First Division match at the Chinese Baseball Field yesterday. The referee was He Chunhui. Lehua's strength today was not originally a match for Races. Losing and conceding ground was already expected. However, their spirit of striving for progress was repeatedly seen even in the disadvantaged final stage, making the score of four to six a considerable achievement.</p>
<h3>Unfavorable Start</h3>
<p>Two Goals Conceded in Thirty Minutes. At the beginning of the game, the Races forwards launched a fierce attack. In less than five minutes, Evan, the left inside forward, broke through and scored a goal. With momentum, the attack became even more fierce. The white eyes could be seen everywhere across Lehua's half of the field. Fortunately, Li Ning and Guan Xun'an defended at the front, and Zhou Xianyan insisted at the back, allowing them to survive. After twenty-five minutes, Races' left winger, Erqi, scored the second goal.</p>
<h3>Amazing Performance</h3>
<p>Left and Right Wingers Make Great Contributions.</p>
<p>When the spectators in the entire stadium were drowsy and sleepy, suddenly a thunderbolt from a clear sky shook the fields. Then, those who were drowsy and sleepy got up and danced. Under the eyes of thousands of spectators, Chen Yutian, the right winger of Lehua, took the lead, took the path on the periphery, passed three levels in a row, and sent the ball to the center. Yang Renwei, the left winger, took advantage of the situation and kicked in the ball. The spirit of the Lehua army was greatly boosted. Yang Renwei passed the ball far to Xi Qiaosheng, who then transferred it to the middle, and the ball hit the goal post and bounced out. Wang Xianghui was lucky and gained without effort, and the score became two to two.</p>
<h3>Feint to the East, Attack the West</h3>
<p>Two More Goals in Five Minutes</p>
<p>Races did not expect Lehua to score an equalizer in the shortest possible time, so they used the tactic of feinting to the east and attacking the west to facilitate their advance. Lehua was greatly troubled by the weakness of the front line and conceded two more goals within five minutes. The scorers were center forward Tang Polun and right winger Ming Gaoqi. Both goals were scored within five steps. Even if Zhou Xianyan had three heads and six arms, he could not deal with it. In the first half, Races had four goals and Lehua had two.</p>
<h3>Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>Each Side Gains Two Goals, Achieving Equilibrium</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, the two armies fought fiercely for a long time. Chen Yutian led troops to the right and secretly crossed the warehouse, attacking the Races' goal. Races' general Ai Yu wore armor and guarded the border pass. When border guards came one after another, they personally went out to disturb them. Chen Yutian was unable to succeed, so he led the troops back. With Races gaining the upper hand, center forward Poplun and inside Kerait each scored a goal. Just as the Races' center forward was injured and left the field, the Lehua's inside appeared slightly calmer. Xi Qiaosheng sent a well-placed pass, and Zhou Shaowen built his merit in a foreign land. Zhu Ji and Yang Renwei missed an open goal, greatly regretting it. Afterwards, Chen Yutian's ball was suddenly intercepted and he stood up and scored, scoring a goal. The result of the game was six to four, with Races winning.</p>

<h3>Northeast Defeats China University Again</h3>
<p>First Half Twenty to Eleven</p>
<p>Second Half Now Two to Twelve</p>
<p>Result: Northeast Greatly Wins</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st - The Northeast Basketball Team played against China University at 7:30 PM on the 1st. Du Tingxiu was the referee. More than 2,000 spectators packed the China University Gymnasium to the point where no water could seep through. The China University team's ball was far from being a match for the Northeast team. The first half was twenty-one to eleven, and the second half was twenty-two to twelve. Northeast won greatly. The team is scheduled to take the Beijing-Liaoning train back to Liaoning on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Northeast Beats Jinling</h3>
<p>Result: 31 to 28</p>
<p>The Northeast basketball team came to Nanjing with its renowned reputation. The general public assumed that Northeast was bound to win. Yesterday at 8 PM, they first competed against the All-University team at the university's gymnasium. The people of the capital had gradually become interested in basketball games, and they were particularly drawn by the fame of the Northeast team. Before 7 PM, the gymnasium was already packed. Spectators from outside continued to arrive, causing some pre-game commotion. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Commotion Among Spectators</h3>
<p>Arriving with Enthusiasm, Leaving Disappointed</p>
<p>The gymnasium is quite small, only able to accommodate about 500 spectators. When there are too many viewers, a game cannot be played. Therefore, around 7 PM, the front and back doors were tightly closed. Most of the male and female guests who came to watch the game had already purchased tickets and were gathered outside the doors, demanding entry. Because they did not receive permission from the administrators, some threw stones and broke several panes of glass. The order outside the venue gradually deteriorated. The school staff had no choice but to telegraph the Capital Garrison Headquarters, and over a dozen armed soldiers were dispatched to maintain order inside and outside the venue. After being questioned by the spectators, the armed soldiers were withdrawn and several police officers were brought in to maintain order. As a result, most spectators who were interested in the basketball game arrived with enthusiasm and left disappointed, suffering the bitterness of being turned away.</p>
<h3>Players Descend by Rope</h3>
<p>Unprecedented Innovation for the Opening Match</p>
<p>At 8:15 PM, the crowd outside the venue was extremely congested. The Northeast players and referee Zhang Xinfu were all standing outside the doors, unable to enter. Finally, a hemp rope was hung down from a high window, and over a dozen members of the Northeast team grabbed the rope and were lifted up by people on a rack to enter. This was truly an unprecedented innovation for the opening match.</p>
<h3>Course of the Fierce Battle Between the Two Teams</h3>
<p>Northeast's Efforts Ultimately Successful</p>
<p>During the first half, each team scored ten points. At 9 PM, the whistle blew and the game began. Within just two minutes, Ma Bingjun, the right guard from Northeast, scored the first point. Soon after, Tan Tianli, the center from Jinling, also scored a basket. The tactics of both sides were evenly matched, and the score was tied at ten to ten by the end of the first half, with the outcome still uncertain.</p>
<p>Northeast Wins the Second Half. After a ten-minute break, both sides regrouped and fought fiercely. Tang Kaixian, the right guard from Jinling, committed a foul and Fan Tingrui of Northeast scored a point from the penalty. Tan Tianli, the center of Jinling, then bravely attacked and, with a swift pass from Yu Xunzi, the left forward, Tan scored two consecutive baskets. Jinling's score surpassed Northeast's by two points, and the momentum shifted greatly. Jinling seemed on the verge of victory. Northeast strengthened its defense, especially with Zhao Lingzhi, the center, and Ma Bingjun, the right guard, who both fought bravely and scored several consecutive baskets. As a result, the score became 21 to 18, and victory ultimately belonged to Northeast. The overall score was 31 to 28. The scorers for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Northeast Team: Right forward Fan Tingrui 5 points, left forward Tian Xinyuan 0 points, center Zhao Lingzhi 11 points, right guard Ma Bingjun 15 points, left guard Shi Wanxian 0 points. Total: 31 points. No fouls.</p>
<p>Jinling Team: The highest scorer was center Tan Tianli with 18 points, followed by right guard Ma Qingxi with 6 points, and left guard Tang Kaixian with 4 points. Fouls were committed by right forward Meng Guangxin once, Ma Qingxi three times, and Tang Kaixian three times.</p>

<h3>National Games Office Has Begun Operations</h3>
<p>Decision to Hold on Double Tenth Festival in Nanjing</p>
<p>Wu Bangwei Transferred to Assist with Competition Matters</p>
<p>This year's National Games have been decided to be held at Linggu Temple in Nanjing on the Double Tenth Festival. The office has already begun operations. However, because the competition matters are numerous and time-consuming, the Preparatory Office has specifically written to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to transfer Wu Bangwei, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Sports Field, to assist with competition matters. The Jiangsu Provincial Department has approved the request. As for the sports regulations, the Organizing Committee has specially appointed Zhang Xinfu and Wu Bangwei to jointly form a Rules Committee with the China National Amateur Athletic Federation to review and finalize all the standards for adoption. Wu Bangwei has already begun the translation, and the committee will revise them in the future. It is expected that everything will be completed by mid-April.</p>

<h3>Japan to Participate in World Games</h3>
<p>Decision to Send 130 Athletes</p>
<p>The 10th World Games, to be held in the United States in 1932, are being prepared for participation by various countries. Japan has recently decided to send 130 athletes to participate in various competitions. The allocation is as follows:</p>

<p>Swimming: 20 athletes, 4 staff</p>
<p>Rowing: 20 official members, 5 alternates, 3 staff</p>

<p>Field Hockey: 11 official members, 4 alternates, 2 staff</p>
<p>Boxing: 4 to 8 athletes, 2 staff</p>
<p>Skating: 10 athletes, 2 staff</p>
<h3>American Swimming Team to Tour Japan</h3>
<p>The United States is the leader in world swimming, and Japan was the runner-up in swimming at the last World Games. Both sides have considerable strength, but Japan's ambition surpasses that of the United States. The Japan Swimming Federation previously contacted the American Swimming Association to arrange a competition in the hopes of settling the matter decisively at the next World Games and defeating them. Because the World Games were approaching and the athletes should not travel abroad, the United States did not agree to the US-Japan competition. However, Japan challenged the United States using all possible means. After discussion, the American Swimming Association decided to lead its elite athletes to Japan this summer after the Pan-Pacific Swimming Championships to hold a US-Japan competition in Japan to determine the superiority of the two countries. After receiving this news, the Japan Swimming Federation began preparing the number of participants, competition events, and athlete selection methods. There will definitely be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Snippets from the New Ming Incident</h3>
<p>Heart Worn</p>
<p>The robbery of the China Merchants' New Ming steamship has been reported in various newspapers. However, at the time, there were various small news items worth recording that outsiders would not know. I have excerpted one or two as follows:</p>
<p>The main dining room serves as the command center. Twelve bandits, with a leader carrying six pistols (mostly obtained from the ship), occupied the main dining room as a temporary command center. Eight bandits were ordered to search, one bandit relayed orders, and one bandit monitored the driver. Silver, clothing, and ornaments looted from the lower cabins were delivered to the main dining room and handed over to the leader. On the 12th, near Honghai Bay, the dining table was piled high with silver dollars, banknotes, gold items, and ornaments. The leader meticulously recorded each item in a small notebook.</p>
<p>Five yuan is not taken, and the person is released. The bandits searched for 48 hours, leaving no stone unturned. When they found only five silver yuan near the berth of a Mr. , the chief bandit exclaimed, "Poor wretch!" He threw the five yuan back and said, "What use is this to me?" He released him into a room. Therefore, all the ship's crew suffered losses, but the was spared.</p>
<p>The steward acts as a bandit host. During the robbery, all the crew members were detained. However, the chief bandit ordered a steward of the main dining room to be free to temporarily serve as a waiter for all the bandits. The preparation of all tea and meals for the bandits was arranged by him, and the bandits did not control him and were very friendly to him. Later, when the chief bandit forcibly attempted to have the business manager, Shen Yougeng, replaced, it was this steward who came forward to mediate, and it was agreed that Zhang Zhongli would act as an impartial inspector instead, otherwise, the ship would be burned.</p>
<p>The Fuzhou branch bureau chief acts as a porter for two days. Wang Hengji, the chief of the Fuzhou branch bureau, was also on the ship. On the 10th, when the robbery began, Wang was afraid of being kidnapped and immediately took off his clothes and threw them into the sea. He rushed to the main dining room to change into tattered clothes and a short shirt. He took a large burlap sack and jumped into it, ordering a sailor to mix him into the baozi room as a piece of miscellaneous cargo. He remained in the sack for 48 hours, starving for two days and nights. He was rescued only after the bandits left. He can be said to have been resourceful.</p>
<p>Kerosene and cotton fill the decks. After the robbery, the bandits only obtained about 7,000 yuan from the business department and about 600 yuan from the shipowners and others. The passengers also lost tens of thousands of yuan, but the bandits were still not satisfied and insisted on having the business manager hand over the keys to the cargo hold. No one would admit it. The chief bandit took out all 40 boxes of kerosene and six large pieces of cotton from the ship, poured it all over the decks, and spread the cotton on the decks. He also opened the seacocks in the lower cabins, saying that if the business manager was not handed over and if anyone reported to the customs or called for help, he would set fire to the ship and sink it. At this time, all the passengers on the ship heard the news and knelt down to pray to heaven, for the situation was dire. Only after Zhang Zhongli agreed to act as the manager was the fire not set.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes About Marriage</h3>
<p>Shi Yanye</p>
<p>A Mr. Lu from Liangxi had a son who received higher education. He married a Miss Jiang from the same village, who also graduated from college. After marriage, their love was deep, and the couple worked as teachers in other places. During their vacation, they returned to their hometown and were even more loving than usual. This year, the couple again returned to Xixi for their annual vacation and agreed to meet at the Xixi Station on the same day. After meeting, they suddenly went to a lawyer's office to request a divorce certificate and publish it in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Afterward, they went to the wife's parents' house, chatting and laughing as usual, and spent the night together, talking until dawn, their voices reaching outside the room. Everyone thought that after a long separation, they should confide their infinite love to each other after being in the same bed. The next day, they went to see their parents together. When the parents saw the divorce advertisement in the newspaper, they were shocked. However, they thought that since their children were so loving, it must be that their surnames were incompatible and they were not their children. But it was such a coincidence. When they saw them return, they hurriedly asked, but they all wanted to say something but stopped. The parents became more anxious and asked more urgently. The son knew he could not hide it and stammered to admit it. The two elders wept and urged them to reconcile, but they tearfully said they could not. Then, they went to the wife's parents' house to report everything. The daughter opened her mouth first, but before she could finish speaking, she collapsed crying into her mother's arms. The son could not bear to watch and resolutely left. From then on, the loving couple became separated. It has been two weeks, and the families and friends of both parties still do not know the reason for their divorce. In recent years, there have been rumors of couples who have been divorced in a few days. However, this is the first time I have encountered such a peaceful and tragic separation. It is also strange.</p>
<p>There was a monk, Liaochen, by the West Lake, who suddenly had lustful thoughts after being well-fed. A Mr. Yuan, a drinking buddy of the monk, told him about it. The monk told Yuan about his inner thoughts, and Yuan said that there were many monks who had families and were happy, and he would help him. The next day, Yuan came and said that there was a Mrs. Ye whose husband had joined the army with the ambition to be a marquis. It had been three years since they had heard from each other, and he was probably a bone on the border. The young woman in the boudoir was struggling to make a living and wanted someone to help her so she could be fed and clothed. She was also beautiful and could be married. The monk was delighted and agreed to meet her. What Yuan said was true. On the same day, he used 300 taels of gold to place the beauty in a golden house. From then on, the monk lived in the Buddhist temple, falsely claiming to be a merchant, and changed his robes in the evening to accompany the beauty. The joy of life was unparalleled. Two months later, the monk returned home in the evening and suddenly saw a young man in military uniform standing in the room, while the woman was crying at the table. The monk was shocked and asked why. The woman sobbed and told him that this young man was her husband, who had been separated from her for a long time. At this point, the monk did not know what to do and hurriedly invited Mr. Yuan. The young man did not want to have this woman, and the woman wanted to serve the monk for a long time. As a result, the young man left with 200 taels of gold. A month later, the monk returned home, and the room was empty. He realized he had been deceived and sighed to himself.</p>
<h3>On Banana Blossoms</h3>
<p>Li Xufan</p>
<p>The banana tree is a herbaceous plant, also known as the sweet dew tree. People often plant it in front of windows and in corners of courtyards because its leaves are long and green, and it can provide shade and coolness in the hot summer breeze. As the Tang Dynasty verse says, "Banana leaves divide the green on the window screen." This is well said. However, the banana tree is a common plant and is easy to cultivate. Except for Guangdong in the tropics, where it can actually bear fruit and become bananas, it is difficult to find a flower in other places. My family has lived in Xujiang, Suzhou. There were four or five trees planted in the west courtyard, with stems as thick as rafters. The trees would wither and flourish year after year. When I was young, I would take the leaves in the summer to use as a mat, which was cool and refreshing to the skin. The neighboring children would scramble for them. In the early summer of Jiawu, one of the larger trees sprouted a flower bud at the end of the stem. It was lotus-colored and light green, and as large as a foot. Starting in April, one petal would open each day. At the base of the petal were twelve stamens with filaments. The filaments had pollen, and below were white bracts, which stored sweet-tasting white dew. The petals and stamens would fall off, and the base of the bract would leave behind a banana fruit about an inch long, but it would not ripen, presumably due to the soil. I remember when I was a child, I would climb a green ladder every morning before sunlight to pick the sweet dew, because it tasted sweet and fragrant, and I considered it a morning beverage. What was different was that during the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Double Ninth Festival, four petals would be placed in the east, west, south, and north directions until the Frost's Descent Festival, when they would wither. The tree that had flowered would wither the following year, and the larger tree next to it would continue to flower in turn for five years. It was once considered strange, but it was not seen by people and has not been studied. Last year, during the Qingming season, the sweet dew tree in front of the courtyard blossomed as before. Thirty years have passed, and because of the proper winter care, it has never been frozen to death and has been maintained for decades. In addition, the location is sunny and easily receives warmth. I am not familiar with the principles of plants. Why does this tree blossom, releasing petals day by day and flowering in turn each year, while other trees do not produce a single flower for years? The changes in living things are unfathomable to humans. I would also like to ask botanists about it.</p>

<h3>Parisian Tales (II) (I)</h3>
<p>Six Societies Lodging in Paris</p>
<p>Looking up from the colonnade again, you see the towers. The north tower can be visited. Tickets cost two francs, which is not expensive, but the 387 spiral stone steps are enough to make you sweat all over. However, if you have the courage to run up, it is not a loss, because the tower is very high and you can see very far. Since it is in the center of Paris and on an island in the Seine River, the beauty of the scenery is self-evident. The south tower is as high as the north tower. Inside the tower is a famous bell that weighs 13,000 kilograms. The clapper alone weighs more than 480 kilograms, so you can imagine how big it is. This bell is the one that the ugly and terrible Quasimodo in the movie "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" struck day and night.</p>
<p>The exterior of Notre Dame is like this, but its interior is even more exquisite. There are sculptures, murals, and very detailed wood carvings. Almost everything has historical value. Archaeologists and artists can linger there all day long. Ordinary people can see how magnificent the interior of a church is and can see how powerful Catholicism is in France. Because Notre Dame is still the residence of the Archbishop of Paris, it used to be influenced by him not only in managing religious affairs but also in politics and education. Furthermore, the Notre Dame orchestra and its musical equipment are world-famous. Even people without religious beliefs often deliberately hold their breath and stand inside to listen to the music and singing. Every Christmas, people who want to attend the High Mass at Notre Dame have to go early to reserve seats. As for the rise and fall of Notre Dame in the era of the French dynasty, it is countless. Many famous kings and queens have been crowned here.</p>
<p>Of course, the most famous of these must be Napoleon the Great, who was the most heroic in the world. Therefore, people who visit Notre Dame in Paris can simultaneously receive two kinds of beautiful impressions: one is the real beauty, and the other is the beauty of fantasy. The real beauty is the entire magnificent architecture that is visible to the two eyes. The beauty of fantasy is to remember the grand ceremonies that have taken place here before, especially those who have read the poem Notredame de paris by the poet Hugo, who can easily grasp this beauty of fantasy.</p>

<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(3) Rome Ten Days (19)</p>
<p>June 4th The Great Cathedral of St. Peter Vatican Palace of the Pope Sistine Chapel</p>
<p>After we admired this Laocoon group of statues with surprise, we went to the left again. The next room on the left corner is a small hall where the representative work of the great Greek sculptor Praxiteles (380 BC), the statue of Hermes, stands upright inside. Hermes, commanded by Zeus, is holding a baby (Dionysus) with sparkling eyes, his right hand high in the air holding a bunch of grapes, caressing the baby. The particularly elongated torso and limbs are plump and soft, which is rare in sculpture. Praxiteles' statue expression has gradually mixed into the elements of customs sculpture, full of real emotion. We can also confirm this by looking at this statue.</p>
<p>Praxiteles and the aforementioned Lysippos are the two great writers after the Greek master Phidias Pbidias (500-432 BC). However, the characteristics of the two people's works are vastly different. Boshi is gentle and feminine, and Loushi is agitated and masculine. The former is the master of the silver age of Greek art, and the latter is a strong general who opened up a new era in the Alexander era.</p>
<p>After passing through the winding stone room and going up the stone steps, we passed through the library, which was deep and secluded, full of the atmosphere of religious philosophy, making people feel the mystery of life. The first great sculptor Myron (about 550-440 BC) near the left side of a room called Salle du Bige is a replica of the famous Greek sculpture (Discobolus), the masterpiece of Myron (about 550-440 BC). Its characteristic is the ability to express the agility of muscles in an instant, breaking the restraint of the frontal balance law and getting rid of the tradition of the past. One foot supports the weight, and the direction of the body tilt is opposite to the direction of throwing the disc. The right hand holds the disc, and the rapid movements of the whole body are expressed according to the rhythm of the line. Such an aggressive posture can only be maintained for an instant. In terms of the expression of this moment of movement, the greatest effect is achieved, because this not only expresses the movement at that time but also implies the movement before this posture and the continuous movement after that. This is the greatest achievement of this painstaking production of Miron in the history of art. Another replica is displayed in the National Museum in London.</p>
<p>After the Greek Allied forces defeated the Persian army, Athens reached a period of prosperity after the great politician Pericls came to power. It was also the period when sculpture was completed. The main writer during this period was Miron Miron was a great writer before the Greek master Phidia Jin.</p>

<h3>Finance The Gold Market Last Week Experienced Great Fluctuations</h3>
<p>There was a difference of more than thirty taels throughout the week. Last week, the gold market was still in a state of hesitation. The dramatic changes in an instant, although avoidable, showed uncertainty in the industry's intentions, making it impossible to predict. In reality, various rumors and messages were conflicting. However, in the end, it rose slightly. The trend weakened from the beginning of the week, probably because the government proposed to ban short selling, causing major speculators to become wary and the bullish trend to dispose of their holdings. The market price suddenly broke through the 700 tael mark, with fluctuations of 20 taels per day. On Tuesday, it suddenly fell to 680 taels and two mace. Then, rumors spread that a certain bank was repeatedly buying spot goods, and the situation turned bullish again. However, the situation was confusing, with rises and falls often hovering around 700 taels, but there was a review of ten taels throughout the day. By the end of the week, major players were covering their shorts, with companies like Xinxing, Yuansheng, and Fuyu actively buying on behalf of Luo. In particular, the silver market fell sharply, suddenly rising to 721 taels. However, the total difference in this week was 32 taels, and the overall rise was only one tael and two qian. As for the overseas silver market, it continued to decline, mostly because the United States still intended to sell, and there was also talk of India imposing import taxes on silver. Therefore, the silver price was not easy to increase. The near-term price of large bars fell a total of 3.75, and the forward price also fell 1.25. The US silver price shrunk by one cent. Panfeng's quotations in the Shanghai market showed no gains or losses for various exchange rates, and they were basically even. The domestic market also did not change much. However, the bidding line price was the largest, pressing down by more than seventy taels, and the smallest was only more than fifty taels. Spot red bars seemed to be active, as buyers continued to increase the forward bids by four or five taels. The total amount of exchange bars was about 30,000, which seems to be one-third more than the previous week. The general situation of these six days is recorded below.</p>
<p>Sudden Drop at the Beginning of the Week, Followed by Upswing. Large silver bars on Monday only added 0.0625 to the forward price. The silver price rose 1.25. The Shanghai market's first order was unchanged, but the domestic market showed signs of loosening, and Chinese merchants were selling off. The initial bidding price was four taels lower, at 711.5 taels. Buyer activity rose from 709 taels to 16.5 taels. Later, due to the Sino-American loan issue and the government's cancellation of the exchange, there were measures to stimulate the market. Therefore, in the afternoon, it broke through the 700 tael mark, suddenly closing at 693.5 taels, 95.5 taels, a sharp drop of 20 taels compared to the previous Saturday. There were a total of 23 taels of twists and turns that day. Hengxing Yuan, a major player named Lu, entered the market. The next day, large bars still added 1.25 to the forward price, and US silver added 1.25. The first order followed with a slight increase, but the domestic market rebounded. Dealers were entering after previously exiting the market. As for the bidding price, it showed an upward trend, opening with an increase of four taels, totaling 699.5 taels, mainly because the silver market rose slightly and owed a lot. Shortly afterward, major players Changsheng Yong, Cuitai, Hengxing Yuan, and Taikangrun tended to sell off, plummeting by more than ten taels, suddenly reaching 688 taels and two mace. Shortly after, it was rumored that banks were opening cash advances, and it suddenly rose by ten taels. In the afternoon, it had jumped out of the 700 tael mark, closing between 705 taels, and had generally recovered by nine taels. However, the storms were raging, and there were seventeen taels of ups and downs throughout the day. On Wednesday, large bars contracted by 0.0625, and the silver price fell by half a cent. The first order also contracted slightly. However, the internal market was flat, and there were still signs of settlement. Banks' intentions to sell were not forgotten. The gold market rose, with the United States tending to sell silver, and people's hearts were soaring. The opening price increased by 5.5 taels to 710 taels. Buyers showed courage and continued to rise to 714.2 taels. After seeing more sellers and hearing that there was a plan to relieve the silver shortage abroad, it suddenly dropped by more than ten taels. In the afternoon, it broke through the 700 tael mark. The result was 703.4 taels, a slight decrease of 1.1 taels. The market fluctuated by a total of 20.2 taels. Due to differing news, there were significant twists and turns. Guangbang Hengxing, Shengda, and other bulls added to their positions. The next day, the silver market's large bars did not change, the US silver added 0.25, and the first order was half a grade longer. The domestic market seemed loose, and there were some who sold off. As for the gold price, it continued to weaken. The opening price was 701 taels, followed by an increase to 0.05 taels. The closing price retreated to within 700 taels, with a total reduction of about four taels. There were twelve or thirteen taels of ups and downs throughout the day. On Friday, large bars retreated 0.0625, and the silver market shrank 0.625. The United States was still selling, and the exchange rate was also strong, with the listed price unchanged. The gold price rebounded to a high point, exceeding 710 taels. The result reached fourteen taels, suddenly rising 14.5 taels. Major buyers were enthusiastic, but the previous market was still flat. In the latter market, the exchange rate trended upwards, and people's hearts were agitated. On Saturday, the large silver bar shrank again from 0.25 to 0.1875, and the silver price only decreased by 0.125. In particular, the United States' selling momentum did not tire, so the Shanghai market's first order also shrunk by half a grade, and the internal market became firm. Although the gold market had a range of seven taels, the market atmosphere was sharp. The opening price rose by 3.5 taels to 717.5 taels. Major players such as Xinxing pursued gains, once reaching 21 taels. Afterward, there were quite a few twists and turns, reaching 14 taels. Finally, it was rumored that India had increased import duties, fearing that large bars would fall again, and people's hearts were agitated. The closing price was 16.7 taels, but it continued to rise to 20 taels. Compared to the previous day (according to the listed price), it rose 1.7 taels, and the atmosphere had turned positive. Here is a breakdown of the high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as exchange rates and bidding prices:</p>

<h3>Overseas Silver Market Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday (Sunday), London's telegram stated that large silver bars continued to fall, with the near-term shrinking by 1.875 to 13 pence 275 (equivalent to 1 shilling 3 pence 8125 English gold). The forward price shrank by 1.25, totaling 13 pence 25. There were a few sales in the American market, but there was a lack of buyers, and the market situation was calm. Furthermore, a New York telegram stated that the US silver price shrank by 1.25 to 2 shillings 8.625 pence. The item added another 3.125 to the US dollar, totaling 4 dollars and 8 shillings and 5.625 pence. The US dollar rose another 3.125 against the pound, totaling 4 dollars and 8 shillings and 5.32 parts out of 21. The US dollar remained at 49 yuan 4375 on the 21st. The British pound remained at 2 shillings 04375. The Shanghai pound shilling remained at 1 shilling 3 pence 875. Spot prices in Mumbai decreased by four anna, totaling 41 rupees 06 anna.</p>
<h3>Sunday's Loan Market Report</h3>
<p>Yesterday's early market exchange rate was 7 qian 2 fen 1 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half. The midday market was 7 qian 2 fen 1 li 7 hao and a half, which was about the same as the previous day's midday market. The silver loan rate in the early market was 8 fen, and in the midday market, it was 6 fen, which was slightly better than the previous day by a few points. The amount of foreign currency transactions was 1,055,000 in the early market and 415,000 in the midday market. The amount of paper money in the early market was 30,000, and the amount of off-site paper money was 45,000 in the early market and 70,000 in the midday market. Banks suspended all collection, delivery, and transactions due to Sunday. Foreign money houses collected and delivered more than 4.7 million yuan. Silver associations collected and delivered more than 35 million yuan. Small money houses transacted more than 300,000 yuan. Collection and delivery of exchange payments from various sources amounted to more than 700,000 yuan. The market price of subsidiary currency, Jiangnan small foreign currency, was 6 qian 7 fen 07 hao and a half in the early market and 6 qian 7 fen 1 li 2 cha hao and a half in the midday market. Transactions amounted to 4,000 jiao in the early market and 5,500 jiao in the midday market. Guangdong small foreign currency was 6 qian 6 fen 8 li in the early market and 6 qian 6 fen 8 li and a half in the midday market. Transactions amounted to 115,000 jiao in the early market and 75,000 jiao in the midday market. Copper coins remained at 358,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Results of the Money Industry's Fundraising Efforts</h3>
<p>The huge amount of outstanding debts between the money industry and various households has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. However, this year, due to the implementation of the National Calendar, the year-end has not yet concluded. Those who are eager to end the year must do so by February 16. Now the deadline is approaching. The amount of funds recovered from this large-scale settlement is still very small. According to industry insiders, only about one-tenth or one-twelfth of the various funds were recovered at the end of last month. If so, the total statistics show that only about three or four-tenths of the funds have been recovered, and the unrecovered amount is still more than double that. We have repeatedly heard about fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to the exchange rate relationship, the accumulated goods cannot be sold smoothly, and the silver market is ultimately unavoidable. Therefore, it is expected that there will be no major achievements in the next week.</p>
<h3>Securities Bond Prices Continued to Rise Last Week</h3>
<p>Turnover of Over 34.2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The spot market conditions of various bonds in Shanghai this past week continued to be inferior to the previous week. Only 68,700 yuan were opened throughout the week. Except for the 19 Customs bonds, which accounted for 36,700 yuan, the other bonds were less than 10,000 yuan each. The futures market was better than the previous week. Although it was during the delivery period, the market was slightly more active due to the continued rise in market prices. Except for Friday, when the market was closed for settlement, only over 2.1 million in paper was opened on Wednesday because the January contract had been discontinued and the February contract had not yet been opened. Only over 5 million yuan was opened on Thursday. The remaining days were quite good. The turnover on Monday was 9.17 million yuan, on Tuesday it was 7.8 million yuan, and on the last day of the week it reached 10 million yuan, totaling 34.23 million yuan, which was only a few tens of thousands of yuan less than the previous week. Among them, the 19 Good Bonds had the best market, with 1.605 million yuan for the January contract, 5.67 million yuan for the February contract, and 1.65 million yuan for the March contract. The 19 Customs Bonds were not as good as the previous ones. The January contract had 1.32 million yuan, the February contract had 4.37 million yuan, and the March contract had 670,000 yuan. The Yuan Reorganization bonds had 945,000 yuan for the January contract, 4.32 million yuan for the February contract, and 1.4 million yuan for the March contract. The Reorganization 96 was flat as before. The Reorganization Bonds had 820,000 yuan for the January contract, 2.49 million yuan for the February contract, and 785,000 yuan for the March contract. The 96 Public Bonds had 945,000 yuan for the January contract, 1.96 million yuan for the February contract, and 725,000 yuan for the March contract. The Government 6 was slightly better, with 500,000 yuan for the January contract, 2.065 million yuan for the February contract, and 395,000 yuan for the March contract. The Customs Bonds had 160,000 yuan for the January contract, 530,000 yuan for the February contract, and 165,000 yuan for the March contract. Other bonds remained quiet, such as the Financial Bonds with 185,000 yuan, the 7-Year Bonds with 155,000 yuan, the Post-War Bonds with 120,000 yuan, and the 19 Bonds with 75,000 yuan. Although the bond market was still calm and suitable for the end-of-month delivery period, the market needed activity and investment from all parties increased compared to the previous period. Therefore, the daily fluctuations tended to be firm, continuing to rise compared to the previous week. On the first day of the week, the prices of all bonds were almost fixed and unchanged. On Tuesday, the market suddenly showed an advantage, such as the Reorganization and 19 Good Bonds, which were lowered by 78 jiao each, but from Monday to Thursday, the daily rebound was particularly pure.</p>
<p>On the last day of the weekend, the upward trend became even stronger. It is estimated that the 19 Good Bonds, Customs Bonds, Reorganization Bonds, and Reorganization Bonds each rose by one yuan yesterday. Other bonds also continued to be firm without exception. Therefore, the results compared to the previous week, except for the Financial 96 price being fixed, all continued to rise from 49 jiao to several yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Spot Yarn Rose Four or Five Taels Last Week</h3>
<p>The yarn market had an upward trend at the beginning of last week, but the Chaozhou gang's solid short sellers declared bankruptcy due to financial difficulties. It was found that there were many empty positions in the market, and most people were optimistic. Fortunately, at the beginning of the week, some retail investors settled a large amount of positions, and the market price fell slightly. However, the gold gang and some manufacturers continued to buy and increase their positions, so the market remained strong. Later, on Wednesday, the market increased the temporary special margin and cancelled buyers, and buyers flocked in, and the market suddenly turned upward. The trend of most floating shorts was increasingly firm, and it was fundamentally difficult to loosen. The buying force was even stronger, so a sharp rise was discovered at the end of the week. On the 27th, Rongxinghao settled more than 10,000 packages for manufacturers, but it was still difficult to reduce the buying atmosphere, which was caused by retail investors' panic. The price of standard yarn in each month rose by four or five taels compared to the previous week. It is estimated that the Keqiao gang bought about six or seven thousand packages of spot yarn. According to some, the Yong'an and Shenxin factories have already shipped goods to various places, and there are also quite a few goods in the local markets. Yarn buyers are very concerned because the exchange rate is difficult to increase, the gold price is high, and the import price has risen sharply, and the prices of all goods have risen. The current situation is very strong, and it is difficult to see a fall in the short term.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Was in Great Shape Last Week</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the cotton market had an upward trend due to the inability of major short sellers to operate. Later, the market held a mixed calculation, and the newly purchased cotton was subject to a special margin of three taels. Some floating longs sold off and settled, and the market atmosphere loosened. Before long, the special margin was cancelled and buyers flocked in. Foreign cotton was also calm, and the import price of foreign cotton rose due to the difficulty of the gold price. The local inventory was weak, and the sources of supply from all over the country were declining. Therefore, the buying sentiment was strong, and scattered shorts were panicked. There was also assistance from large manufacturers in the dark on the long side, so the momentum was even stronger. At the end of the week, the rising wind was unstoppable, and most of the shorts were unable to resist, so the rising trend became higher and higher. Buyers had to submit forty taels. On the 31st, Shenchang Hanbang sold short about 90,000 pieces alone, and Japanese merchants also sold off in large quantities when the mulberry was rising. It is still difficult to predict what the future holds. This kind of skyrocketing is rare in recent times. The price of standard cotton in each month rose by one tael and seven or eight qian compared to the previous week. The factory bought more spot cotton transactions, totaling about 2,000 pieces. The source is not smooth. American cotton is similar to last week.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Fell Back, British and Indian Cotton Continued to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton first rose due to purchases by dealers, and then weakened due to longs settling and manufacturers' disappointment. It is estimated that futures fell by two to five points, and spot prices fell by five points. British cotton futures rose by three to four points, and spot prices rose by six points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by ten points. The market for Indian cotton was very strong due to speculation. It is estimated that Pingle rose by three rupees, Liaoyang futures rose by two rupees, Aomula rose by four rupees, and forward prices rose by three rupees. Bailuoxi rose by four rupees. Original telegrams are recorded on the left (telegram from the 31st):</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Market Prices Are Quite Strong</h3>
<p>Japanese Sugar Market Turned Flat Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market in the producing area was closed due to the Sunday holiday, and there were very few market transactions. The atmosphere was still strong. On the 24th, the initial bid for raw sugar white was ten taels and four qian, and then the hoarders released some goods. The transaction price was ten taels and three qian and a half. The high-quality goods were ten taels and four qian, and there were some transactions. The market was still strong and beautiful. On the 20th, the mid-level white was nine taels and nine qian, and the dealers were relatively quiet. Japanese sugar, Meiji YT brand, was ten taels and four qian. The newly arrived goods that could not be delivered were ten taels and three qian and seven and a half. Minghua YP brand was ten taels and five qian and two and a half. YT brand was ten taels and three qian and a half. Meiji YP brand was ten taels and five qian and a half. There were few transactions for other brands. The market was slightly flatter than before.</p>
<p>Grains: The Rice Market Remains Mediocre</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, about 40 boats arrived on Luli Road. The market sales were still not active. High-quality white japonica rice was extremely rare and sold smoothly, so it showed a steady trend. Ordinary medium and second-grade rice was initially active, and the market was tending to be sluggish. The market had been revised quite a bit, but the overall trend was still flat. There were not many transactions throughout the day, because a small number of cargo owners had a strong intention to sell, but there was no hope of realizing it due to the expiration of the settlement period. The thin japonica rice was dull and lacked energy, and the top-quality goods were particularly bleak. Prices were frequently soft, especially around eleven yuan. Although the glutinous rice market was not good, the downward trend seemed to be stabilizing. The overall market continued to be weak. Dushanzhi and Buzhanlai goods were successively sold in the market, which was dull. The high-quality goods were slightly stable. The middle-level market declined, and the transportation and sales were both deserted. The sales in all directions were inconsistent. The special top-quality opened at twelve yuan and eight jiao. The sales of Yinyuan fell step by step, and the number of sales was very low. The market situation was not good.</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, more than 30 boats were seen under the river. The sales in the local market continued to be sluggish. Changxibei japonica rice plummeted, but the top-quality goods were only slightly dull. The price opened at about twelve yuan and five jiao. The sales of Sumi and other machine japonica rice were really lackluster. Even the retail sales were bleak, so the market price felt suppressed again. The arrival of thin japonica rice and early rice in the Nanlu area was very strong, and the bottom goods were also thick. The situation was dull, and the price saw a step-by-step softness. The buying sentiment for glutinous rice was lonely, and the change in Yinyuan continued to be weak. The special high opened at twelve yuan and a half.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: The Silk Market's Downward Trend Resurfaced Last Week. Japanese Silk Sales Were Unrelenting. Shanghai Factories Experienced a Sharp Drop of More Than One Hundred Taels. Spot Silk Exports Were Actively Smooth. Totaling More Than Three Thousand Pieces Throughout the Week. The silk market in Shanghai experienced a sharp drop last week, with Shanghai white factory silk being the most affected. Since the beginning of the year, European and American silk weaving factories have been continuously sending telegrams to Shanghai requesting Shanghai white factory silk. In addition, Japanese dealers have followed up with purchases to make up for the shortage of goods, and the factory silk price has soared by more than two hundred taels, almost causing a sensation. However, Japanese silk merchants, in view of the turning point in European sales, actively loaded their stored silk for overseas markets. The supply of stored silk in the overseas market has increased sharply, so the price of silk has fallen sharply. The price of Shanghai factory silk has plummeted by more than one hundred taels. All manufacturers have a firm attitude due to the thin inventory and heavy cost, and the transactions are few. A total of only more than 300 packages were sealed. In general, European and American hoarders shipped out batches of their futures silk due to the sharp drop in silk prices, fearing obstacles. Therefore, the export of Chinese silk was smooth during the week. A total of 3,055 pieces were delivered throughout the week. The market prices of European and American Chinese silk have fallen consistently.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipality's Business Tax</h3>
<p>Collection Regulations and Implementation Rules Published</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Interview with Our Reporter</p>
<p>The business tax issue in this city is closely related to the vital interests of all industries. In recent days, letters and telegrams have been exchanged, and representatives have petitioned to give it full attention. Our reporter specially visited Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, yesterday to inquire about the future of the business tax rate. Mr. Wang is also the Chairman of the Municipal Finance Discussion Committee. The committee will hold its third meeting soon to discuss the business tax rate in this city. Mr. Wang replied that the municipal government, in order to widely solicit opinions and listen to public sentiment, has entrusted the business tax issue to the Municipal Finance Committee for discussion. The municipal government is now waiting for the committee to finalize the draft before approving its implementation. The committee has held two meetings and has passed the draft of the business tax collection regulations and the draft of the implementation rules. The third meeting will discuss the draft tax rate. The meeting date has not yet been determined. All industries are now requested to submit their opinions on the tax rate. The committee will discuss the draft based on the opinions submitted by all industries. After the draft is discussed and approved, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will convene a meeting of representatives from all industries for discussion, and then the Finance Bureau will report it to the municipal government for approval and implementation. The likin tax is considered to be an oppressive tax. However, if the business tax rate is set too high or too low, it will inevitably be an oppressive tax. Therefore, we should learn from the past to avoid abuses. It is foreseeable that the business tax rate in this city will definitely be lower than in other places.</p>
<h3>Collection Regulations</h3>
<p>The city's business tax collection regulations and their implementation rules have been approved by the Municipal Finance Committee. After the draft business tax rate is passed, they will be submitted to the municipal government's municipal meeting for approval and implementation.

However, if the business ends in less than half a year, it shall be reported at the time of termination.

<p>Crack Down on Speculative Trading</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Informs Shanghai Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Conference, issued the measures for cracking down on speculative trading in gold and various exchange transactions. The Ministry should comply with it. In addition to the supervisors who should be selected and assigned, the original measures are copied and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government to check and order the Shanghai Gold Exchange and the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange to comply. The consultation document and measures are transcribed as follows:</p>
<h3>Consultation Document</h3>
<p>In order to consult on the matter, the Central Political Conference letter was approved in the file of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that the relationship between the expensive gold and cheap silver is of great importance to the national finance and the national economy. After the financial and economic groups studied the relief measures, it was reported that the various root and branch treatment measures should be submitted to the National Economic Conference for discussion. The article on cracking down on speculative trading in exchanges extracted by Committee Member Kong Xiangxi in the palliative measures should be drafted by your ministry and submitted for approval. It is appropriate to attach a copy of the letter to inform you and ask you to check and discuss it. The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce drafted the measures for supervising speculative trading in gold and various exchange transactions and sent them to be forwarded. Now, the Executive Yuan instructs to approve the letter from the National Government Civil Service Office, stating that the Central Political Conference letter sent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that the ten measures for cracking down on speculative trading in gold and various exchange transactions were discussed and considered that the original measures are still feasible. The same measures were attached to the letter for checking and ordering compliance with the measures. The instructions were delivered to the Executive Yuan, etc. In addition to replying to the letter, the original documents were copied and ordered to be complied with. In addition to replying to the letter, the original documents were copied and sent to the Ministry. Checking the reasons for the expensive gold and cheap silver is different, and the price of gold and silver fluctuates suddenly and unpredictably. Speculative trading in gold and various exchange transactions is really helpful. It is necessary to strictly supervise to prevent this malfeasance. Because of the former reasons, it is appropriate to comply with them. In addition to the supervisors who should be selected and assigned again, the ten measures are copied and consulted for checking and ordering the Shanghai Gold Exchange and the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange to comply. This is to consult the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Measures</h3>

The Ministry shall order the various exchanges dealing in gold trading to inform all brokers to strictly abide by them, and the supervisors shall investigate them at any time. 2. If a broker violates the preceding prohibition, the Ministry shall revoke the broker's business license and severely punish him.

<p>Cosmetics Association's Important Letter</p>
<p>Petition for Differentiated Collection of Business Tax for the Industry</p>
<p>Letter Asking the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, National Goods Association, etc. to Submit for Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association believes that cosmetics are listed as luxury goods in the implementation of business tax, and the products of the industry's manufacturers are either cosmetics or daily hygiene products. There should be separate categories to clarify the boundaries. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Trade Associations Research Tax Rules Committee, and the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation yesterday. The original text is as follows: Respectfully, the implementation of business tax lists cosmetics as luxury goods, so that the wealthy can contribute to the treasury tax and block loopholes. However, many of our colleagues also operate several businesses, and the annual business income has not been carefully divided. According to the business tax regulations, those who also operate several businesses should be taxed separately, which is a fair expression of a good tax law. Checking the trademark law is very strict in the classification of goods, and it should not allow for any imitation. For example, Category 3 is limited to fragrances and cosmetics, while Category 5 is daily hygiene products such as tooth powder, washing powder, and washing lotions. Categories 1 and 4 are even more distinct, showing that the original intention of the legislation has its own goals. If the categories are not distinguished and the boundaries are not clarified when collecting business tax this time, it will inevitably lead to disputes and hinder tax administration. Therefore, the nature and effectiveness of all the specialized and part-time products of our colleagues are listed separately, and we ask your association to forward them to the Ministry and the Provincial Government for review and regulations, so that investigators and taxpayers can follow them and avoid disputes and delays in progress. It is a public convenience. The items are listed as follows: A. Fragrances and cosmetics belonging to Category 3 of the Trademark Law: 1. Make-up powder and palace powder 2. Rouge 3. Lipstick or lip rouge 4. Eyebrow pencil 5. Perfume 6. Expensive snow cream and hair and skin products with a price of more than one yuan 7. Manicure tools and their medicines 8. Sachet, incense pillow, and scented powder paper 9. Make-up scented soap 10. Pocket mirror case and rouge powder box 11. Goose feather or velvet powder puff and glass bottle for spraying perfume 12. Artificial ivory toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, etc. (Explanation) The above items are not necessary for daily life, and the fragrances and decorations used are mostly expensive imports, with the purpose of catering to the luxury lovers. Their value is all more than one yuan, and they are taxed in the same way as ginseng and swallow's nest in medicinal materials, which is sufficient to block loopholes and promote thrift. B. Washing powder, tooth powder, and washing lotions belonging to Category 5 of the Trademark Law: 1. Tooth protection agents such as tooth powder, toothpaste, and mouthwash 2. Hair and skin protection agents such as ordinary hair growth oil, hair growth water, pure honey, and inexpensive snow cream or ointments 3. Washing powder, bath salts, prickly heat powder, toilet water, and their supplies such as boar bristle and cattle bone toothbrushes, rabbit fur or silk cotton powder puffs, etc. (Explanation) The above items are all daily hygiene products that prevent diseases and promote health. Therefore, people in the middle and lower classes of society and laborers who have a little common sense are happy to buy them. Their prices are only a few cents or a few points, which is a major force in recovering the outflow of profits and resisting imported luxury goods in recent years. If heavy taxes are levied, the selling price will be high, and those who cherish small expenses will definitely ignore hygiene and abandon them. They should be taxed in the same category as ordinary medicinal materials and should not be included in the cosmetics category to avoid hindering their sales. C. Those belonging to Category 1 and Category 4 of the Trademark Law: 1. Medicated soap and washing soap 2. Hair, skin, teeth, and tooth treatment agents that specify the formulation method and ingredients 3. Mosquito repellent incense and insecticide (Explanation) The above items, except for washing soap, which belongs to the candle and soap industry, are all set up to relieve the suffering of the sick and should be taxed in the same category as pills, powders, plasters, and pills, and should not be included in the cosmetics category so that doctors and pharmacists can invent new products to relieve the suffering of the people and reduce the encroachment of Western medicine. The above three categories are listed separately according to the nature and actual effects, for reference and to form a good tax law. As for the tax rate, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have always been equal, so please do not treat them differently so that they can be observed. It is especially hoped that there will be no obstacles in tax affairs and business conditions.</p>
<p>Letter from the Shanghai Customs Commissioner</p>
<h3>Opinions on Raising Funds for Dredging the Divine Shoal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation received a letter from the Dredging Bureau with the opinions of Mei Weiliang, the Commissioner of Customs of Jianghai, on raising funds for dredging the Divine Shoal: 1. The Dredging Donation should be 3% of the tax collected according to the current new tariff rules. If calculated according to the original standard of 5% ad valorem old tariff rules, it is about 7%. The original donation rate is that every 100 yuan of goods should pay 15 cents. If calculated according to 7%, it should pay 35 cents. 2. The 3% Dredging Donation collected according to 5% of the cargo price has already been sufficient for the use of the Huangpu River and the engineering expenses of the Dredging Bureau within the Suzhou River that should be installed. This section should be re-determined. 3. All the currently proposed increased amounts should be stored separately for the expenses of dredging the Divine Shoal. If Shanghai's import trade can maintain its current status without decreasing, this amount should be sufficient. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Rice Federation Submits Document to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Appealing to Abolish the Rice Donation Bureau for Anhui Sailboats</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Ning-Shanghai City and County Rice Industry Association telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that according to a letter from the Nanjing City Xiaguan District Grain Branch, the Anhui Sailboat Rice Donation Bureau, which was originally established two and a half miles upstream of Dashengguan, has only posted a notice of donation exemption for one day on January 1 since the Ministry of Finance issued the order to abolish taxes. The next day, it added dozens of armed soldiers in the name of checking rice and grain exports, extorting 6 jiao of ocean per stone of rice and 3 jiao of ocean per stone of rice and miscellaneous grains. The money collected was not given a receipt, but instead ordered the boatmen to extort voluntary payment pledges. The rice boats in Anhui Province were so severely extorted that they did not dare to come to Beijing. If it is delayed for a long time, it will inevitably lead to a rice shortage in Beijing. The Xiaguan Chamber of Commerce has reported the situation to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for an order to abolish them. Now, we are writing to your association for unified assistance in order to achieve the purpose of abolition. The Rice Donation Bureau for Anhui Sailboats is located in Jiangsu, which is under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu. It has always been a difficult situation for merchants. In the spring of last year, the Nanjing General Chamber of Commerce reported to the Ministry of Finance and instructed to stop it. Now, the whole country is implementing the abolition of taxes and all taxes similar to taxes. Provinces are not allowed to request an extension for any reason. The clear order is glorious and announced to China and foreign countries. All provinces under the party's rule are practicing in good faith. The Donation Bureau is openly defying the order with the reason of verifying and charging fees, and the fee has been increased by more than double. If it is not strictly prohibited, it will inevitably be unscrupulous and endless. If the provinces follow suit, the future of the people's food supply will be worrying, and the spirit of the party's rule will be deeply lost. In order to make the abolition of taxes and donations a primary purpose, the undersigned should telegraph to His Excellency to allow the illegal collection of donations by the Two and a Half Mile Donation Bureau to be abolished immediately in order to maintain the laws and regulations and promote prestige, which is a moral convenience.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Continued Request to Reduce Sugar Inspection Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Industry again, requesting a reduction in sugar inspection fees. The original telegram stated: "Respectfully to the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, regarding the Shanghai Sugar Trade Association's request for reduction or exemption of inspection fees, we have already telegraphed your ministry with the facts, humbly requesting your approval and reduction. On January 13th, we received approval No. 362, which has been forwarded to the Trade Association for compliance. Now, we reverently submit the Trade Association's letter stating, 'Our association still has points regarding the inspection fee amount that we cannot help but state again. We believe that the Ministry of Industry's approval of inspection fees also embraces the principle of 'taking from commerce and using for commerce,' with comprehensive planning aiming for utmost lightness. The sugar category is only about three per thousand, etc. The intention to favor merchants is truly virtuous. However, according to reality, it seems there are still things that deeply concern sugar merchants. The so-called 'taking from commerce and using for commerce,' there is no explicit regulation on how it is used for commerce, and it is unknown for which merchants it is used. If it is taken from A and used for B, then the current direct burden is on the ailing sugar merchants, which is truly unfair. Currently, each picul of sugar is charged four cents. Shanghai imports approximately six million piculs annually, so the fees will reach 240,000 yuan. Such a huge amount can hardly be called minor. Moreover, the tax on sugar is already heavy, and the current inspection fee is no different from adding another tax outside of taxes, which is truly unbearable. Therefore, we venture to request your association's further assistance in forwarding a request to the Ministry of Industry, hoping that they will consider the merchants' difficulties and approve the exemption of sugar inspection fees. If that is impossible, we earnestly request that it be changed to calculation by package amount, collecting one per thousand to align with the benevolent intention of lightness and maintain the difficulty of commerce.' According to this, commodity inspection is indeed, as your approval stated, intended to restrict inferior products, study improvements, and increase commodity reputation. The Sugar Trade Association has also clearly understood this point and is not insisting on exemption from inspection. However, with the current charge of four cents per picul, totaling 240,000 yuan based on citywide import statistics, in addition to the customs tax, there is this extra-tax burden. At a time when the sugar market is declining, it is truly beyond their ability to bear. We request a change to package amount calculation, reducing the inspection fee to one per thousand. The total annual income would reach 80,000 yuan, which should be sufficient for the bureau's research and improvement purposes, while also slightly alleviating the burden. We hope to assist your ministry's intention to implement inspection fees with utmost lightness. As the association is entrusted with leading the merchants, and since there has been a continuous submission, it is inappropriate to withhold it. Therefore, we respectfully request your examination and approval, granting a reduction to relieve the merchants' difficulties, which is truly for the public good. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows."</p>

<h3>Tragic Situation of Yu County Suffering from Both Military and Bandit Disasters</h3>
<p>Report Received by the Red Cross</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society previously received a telegram from the Yu County Branch in Henan Province, reporting the disaster situation, and attached the original telegram from Ma Teng, a member of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, to the Provincial Relief Committee.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The section about people being dismembered by bandits is the most cruel and urgently needs to be disclosed next. Ma Committee member's original telegram to the Provincial Original Telegram reads: KaiFeng Henan Provincial Relief Committee Chairman Zhang Junjian Tengxia arrived in Yu to investigate and found that the disasters of military, bandits, drought, hail, and locusts are all very severe, and the two disasters of military and bandits are the most severe. Military disasters: From last winter to the present, the estimated cash, food, soldiers, laborers, livestock, vehicles, firewood, and various distributions, as well as the loss of life and property of the people due to the war, total at least 15 million yuan or more, and the bandit disasters are not included in this. Bandit disasters: Since the beginning of the Republic, there has been no day without them. Past ones that lasted a long time need not be mentioned. Even during this tense war, because there were no troops to suppress them, the bandits took the opportunity to rampage and burn, kill, rape, and plunder, and went wherever they wanted, as if entering no man's land, and no one could do anything about it. Some of the people who were caught were burned to death, some were castrated, some had their feet cut off, some had their ears cut off, and some had their arms and legs removed. Such things are too numerous to count. Therefore, when the county people heard the news of bandits, they were terrified and fled far away, daring not stay at home. The committee member went to the western countryside to investigate and found that the villages were all in ruins, and fertile fields had become overgrown with weeds. There was no smoke from human habitation for sixty or seventy miles west of Wengu Store. The severity of the bandit disaster is truly heartbreaking and shocking. The southern, northern, and eastern townships are also similar. Now that it is deep winter, hundreds of thousands of refugees have no clothing, food, or shelter. If immediate relief is not provided, it will be impossible to attract them and show kindness. In addition to the detailed disaster situation in each district of Yu County, which will be reported in a separate list, I hereby send this telegram first, begging the chairman to advance a large sum of money for relief to save those in dire need. Committee member Ma Tengxia bows."</p>
<h3>Shanghai News on the Tragic Bandit Disaster in Taixing</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Relief Committee for Bandit Disaster in Taixing County</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society yesterday received a telegram from the Relief Committee for Bandit Disaster in Taixing County, saying: "Shanghai Red Cross Society, respectfully. We have received telegrams from Yang Zhongjun et al. of the Third District Party Department of our county, Huang Jialin et al. of the Joint Temporary Relief Office of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts of Taixing, Wang Yuguang et al. of the Huangqiao Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Pei et al. of the Huangqiao Branch of the Red Swastika Society, Ding Shande et al. of the Huangqiao Branch of the Red Cross Society, Huang Guangde, District Chief of the Fourth District, Sun Zhongjie et al., Chief of the Fourth Public Security Sub-bureau. The Taixing bandit disaster is most severe in the eastern townships. In all townships, the houses are half-turned to ashes. In the snowy and icy weather, the people are in distress, unlike the people in other disaster areas who only feel they have no clothes or food. Our county is discussing the formation of a disaster relief organization, but funds have not yet been collected. If we wait until the funds are collected before providing relief, I am afraid that countless people without clothes, food, or shelter will die of starvation, cold, or in the icy and snowy weather. Moreover, the bandit situation has just calmed down, and bandits are everywhere. If they collude again and brew trouble, it will be even more difficult to imagine the overall situation. We plan to urgently telegraph the National Government Relief Committee, the Shanghai Jishi Society, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Society, and the Jiangsu Provisional Charity Relief Society, begging for winter relief. At the same time, the county will quickly raise loans separately, hoping to raise a large sum of money and supplies for urgent relief in the shortest possible time. We are weeping and begging for your help." After investigation, the disaster situation in our county is extremely severe and cannot be compared with other counties. In recent years, we have first suffered from warlord trampling, followed by bandit-communist burning, killing, and plundering. The disaster-stricken area is almost a hundred miles in length and breadth. At this time of icy and snowy weather, those without clothes, food, or shelter will hardly avoid dying of hunger and cold. We have already briefly described the situation and telegraphed your society for relief. Now, we have received the previous instructions and respectfully present this telegram again, begging for swift relief. We are extremely grateful. The Relief Committee for Bandit Disaster in Taixing County respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Report for Jiangxi Province Obtained by Jisheng Society, etc.</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society and the Morality Society jointly undertook disaster relief in Jiangxi Province. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company provided free transportation of the second batch of 2,000 sets of cotton clothes to Xunzhou. They were distributed to the extremely poor after careful inspection during this severe cold. Now we have received a letter from Director Zhang Xianqing, which is recorded as follows: The director and relief workers went to Jiangxi Province and went to the Ji'an Guild Hall, intending to borrow it temporarily for investigating the disaster situation nearby. Unexpectedly, there were as many as seven or eight hundred people who had fled from the disaster area of Ji'an in the hall. The hall had no room to stand. I had to stay temporarily in the next-door Houji Inn. Then the President of the General Chamber of Commerce and others welcomed me into the General Chamber of Commerce as the relief agency for the two societies. For several days, I discussed relief work with gentry merchants from all walks of life and investigated the disaster situation. They all said that the entire province suffered a robbery this time. It is difficult to provide relief without raising tens of millions of funds. It was found that there are eighty-one counties in the province, and the two major regions of southern Jiangxi and Nanchang have not been directly affected. In addition, there are as many as seventy-eight counties with major bandit disasters, with more than 100,000 lives lost and property losses of 130 million. More than 54,000 houses were burned down, which can be called a catastrophe. As for relief, officials and gentry jointly established a shelter in the grain depot in the provincial capital, taking in 527 male and female refugees, old and young. The daily cost of two meals is more than 1,000 yuan per month. It is a pity that a temporary education center has not been established. Currently, the number of poor people who have fled to the province from various disaster areas and are on the verge of death is large. The two societies plan to establish a place to rescue and educate the disaster victims. Relief work in Ji'an has repeatedly been discussed with pure gentry merchants from the same hometown, who all say that it is temporarily difficult to proceed. The county must be slightly calmer and transportation must be unimpeded before going there. Disaster relief is not easy to do in such a big disaster in Jiangxi Province. Now that the charitable comrades of the two societies have entrusted me, I have to do my best. Please give me guidance from time to time. The two societies know that it is difficult, but Mr. Zhang and others boldly set out on this journey in the midst of icy and snowy weather, which is admirable. However, the bandits are rampant, and the suffering of the disaster victims is so great that I cannot help but feel boundless grief.</p>
<h3>Change of Name of All Public Security Bureaus in Baoshan County</h3>
<p>Additional Sub-bureau in the Urban Area, Additional Sub-station in Changxingsha</p>
<p>The Baoshan County Public Security Bureau was previously ordered to change from a bureau to a section due to the suspension of subsidies from the Shanghai Municipal Government and the depletion of funds. The Baoshan County Government prepared a budget for expenses after the change from a bureau to a section and submitted it to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. The county government took over the bureau a few days ago and changed it to the Public Security Section, which was merged into the county government for management. Now it is learned that the Public Security Section will have one section chief, one section member, two inspectors, one detective, and two employees. County Magistrate Qiu Mingjiu carefully planned the saved funds and added the First Sub-bureau to the urban area of the former Public Security Bureau, which was stationed in the city. The first district belongs to it. Changxingsha is isolated in the sea outside Wusongkou, so it is actually beyond reach. Therefore, the First Sub-bureau and Second Sub-station were added to the island. The original First Sub-station directly under the former Public Security Bureau in Yangxing Town was changed to the First Sub-bureau and First Sub-station. The First Sub-bureau in Dachang Town, the Second Sub-bureau in Liuzhu Town, the Third Sub-bureau in Luodian Town, and the Fourth Sub-bureau in Yuepu were all renamed to the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sub-bureaus in accordance with the order of the county's autonomous regions. All sub-stations and police stations under each sub-bureau were also renamed in accordance with the newly revised order of each sub-bureau. The county government has reported to the Department of Civil Affairs for record and notified all agencies in the county to be aware of it. Magistrate Qiu gathered the section chief of the Public Security Section, inspectors, all sub-bureau chiefs, and patrol officers to the county government at 1 PM the day before yesterday for a police affairs meeting. Internal and external duties, winter defense matters, etc. were thoroughly discussed and thoroughly rectified.</p>

<h3>White Russian House Demolition</h3>
<p>Appeal Case to Continue Today</p>
<p>Support Associations Established by All Sectors</p>
<p>Since Qingyun Lane in Hongkou was illegally demolished by two to three hundred White Russians hired by New Sassoon &amp; Co. on September 10th of last year, the injured Miao Shelai and others filed a criminal complaint against Xing Dingcheng, the comprador of the foreign firm. The result of the first instance trial in the Special District Local Court was an acquittal. The tenants of Qingyun Lane were dissatisfied and filed an appeal in the Higher Second Branch Court. The trial was opened by Judge Song Yuan. All the details have been recorded in the previous report. The case is scheduled for 2 PM today. All sectors have paid close attention to this case. At that time, the number of people attending the hearing will be more than the first time.</p>
<p>The tenants of Qingyun Lane have complained to people from all walks of life about the whole process of the case, requesting a fair judgment. It is heard that various groups have expressed their injustice and have risen up to help, and have launched the organization of support associations. The preparatory work has been completed, and the founding conference was held on January 31st at the Tao Tao Restaurant on Dong Wuchang Road in Hongkou. Representatives from more than 120 groups attended the meeting to discuss and decide on the name "Support Association for the White Russian House Demolition Case in Qingyun Lane by All Sectors of Shanghai." On the spot, Zhang Xianfang, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Federation, Long Zhaowu, representative of the Fourth District Branch of the Citizens' Association, Cai Xiaohe, representative of the Ham Industry Union, Liang Yongyi, representative of the Cantonese Restaurant Teahouse Union, Gong Zhilong, representative of the Inkstone Lithographic Machine Union, Hu Shouqi, representative of the Calligraphy and Fan Industry Union, Zhao Zhenhui, representative of the Pharmaceutical Industry, Du Chunsun, representative of Zhabei Puzhi School, Liang Wenlong, representative of the Guangdong Cured Meat Union, Chen Guanghai, representative of the Beef and Mutton Industry Guild, Chen Daosheng, Du Jun, Jiang Xianhe, Tang Huikang, and Gao Jieyuan, representatives of the 17th District Branch of the Citizens' Association were elected as staff to be responsible for hosting the support association affairs. Two motions were voted on the spot: (1) Immediately draft a declaration; (2) Draft a petition to all levels of party and government agencies. Then, Mao Chunpu, representative of the Coal Industry Union, spoke, saying that the notice of vacating the houses issued by the landlord British firm New Sassoon &amp; Co. to Qingyun Lane on June 26th only stated that "the houses will be renovated and the tenants are limited to move out and return the houses before August 31st for construction and demolition." It is already known that the houses have only been thirteen years old and have not reached the necessary time for renovation, and the notice does not have any special reason to allow the tenants to move out immediately. All representatives present should not ignore this matter as a local affair in Qingyun Lane. If this bad example is set, then all small and medium-sized merchants in Shanghai will be slaughtered by capitalists. More than 100 groups have attended the meeting today. I hope that all representatives will uphold their enthusiasm to help the tenants of Qingyun Lane and work together to resist and strive to achieve the ultimate victory to maintain justice. Next, Cai Xiaohe, Guo Zhaowu, Zhang Xianfang, Lu Muqin, Zhao Zhenhui, Li Heyun, and others successively expressed their opinions, all of which were extremely passionate. (The words are too long and will not be repeated.)</p>

But now the gold price is increasing day by day, and the cost is also increasing day by day.

<h3>Xu Juxiang's Miraculous Healing</h3>
<p>Dr. Xu Juxiang, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine residing in Qingli, Beishan Road, Pentang Alley, Shanghai, excels in internal medicine and other disciplines. His diagnostic acumen and healing skills are exceptional. For example, Rong Zongjing, a prominent merchant, had a relative named Zhijun who suffered from persistent fever and chills, accompanied by restlessness, poor appetite, and general weakness. Western doctors, after taking an X-ray, discovered white spots on the lungs and diagnosed infantile tuberculosis, recommending treatment with sunlamps and mechanical respiration. Dr. Xu, however, diagnosed yin deficiency and latent pathogenic factors. After eliminating the pathogens and nourishing the yin with several prescriptions, the patient recovered dramatically. Furthermore, Mrs. Yan Chuntang of Jing'an Temple suffered from mastitis, which had proven resistant to various treatments. Western doctors diagnosed breast cancer and recommended surgery. Dr. Xu, however, successfully cured her. Recently, Zhang Zhenlin, owner of Yuanzhang Jewelry Store in Jinli, suffered from severe typhoid fever, which had become life-threatening. Dr. Xu meticulously treated him, and he recovered in half a month. Out of gratitude, Mr. Zhang presented Dr. Xu with a large silver shield inscribed with the words "The miraculous doctor whose remedies is effective as a wall".</p>

<h3>Two Robbery Cases in Nanshi in Half a Day</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaoquan's Associate Hit by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>Police Apprehend Five Robbers in Succession</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, two robbery cases occurred simultaneously on Danfeng Road and Dasheng Lane in the newly opened river area of Nanshi. The audacious robbers opened fire to resist arrest, wounding a passerby. As a result, the detectives of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with the local police chief of the second precinct of the first district, captured four robbers on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Thriving Fresh Fish Business: Lu Qiasheng, a local resident, has been co-operating with friends at the Guheji Fresh Fish Shop, located at 1 Dongxing Road, South Section, Danfeng Road, Nanshi. The business is thriving, attracting the attention of thieves. Yesterday afternoon, around 5:30 PM, the shop had just received donations totaling more than 4,000 yuan. While they were counting the money, five robbers suddenly appeared: two in Western suits, two in long robes, and one in blue cloth trousers, speaking the local dialect. Four of the robbers had pistols and rushed to the counter, intimidating those present into silence, and looting the money.</p>
<p>Police Chase After Robbery: At that time, around 500 silver dollars and 3,500 yuan in banknotes were robbed, as well as a gold ring worth three yuan. As the robbers left the shop, one of the shop's associates followed them and secretly reported the situation to the No. 3 patrol post. The patrol officer, Chen Fangsong, immediately blew his whistle and gave chase, directly to the north entrance of Xianji Road. The No. 2 patrol officer, Shen Guanjun, also joined the chase. Seeing the situation, the robbers turned around and fired six or seven shots at the two police officers. Fortunately, none of the shots hit.</p>
<p>Associate Wounded by Stray Bullet: At that time, it was dusk, and the number of people on the street was increasing. The police feared that they might accidentally injure innocent bystanders, so they did not dare to return fire. At that time, Fan Youliang (aka Fan Asan, a local resident, 33 years old), an associate of the Zhang Xiaoquan Deji scissors shop on Chenghuangmiao Street, Xiaodongmen, was idly standing at the entrance of the store. He was hit in the buttocks by a stray bullet. The bullet did not penetrate completely, and he immediately fell to the ground in pain, bleeding profusely. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by Xu Zhijun, a colleague at the store. At the same time, a report was filed with the second precinct of the first district.</p>
<p>Police Investigate the Victim's Home: After hearing the report, Police Chief Ma immediately personally supervised patrol officers Tang Mingtao, Wang Wencai, Wu Hao, and senior patrol officers Wang Lianzhong, Nie Wenhua, Li Fuyi, Lei Zhizeng, and Li Changlian to surround the area in search of the robbers. However, the robbers had already disappeared. They then went to the victim's home to conduct a detailed inspection, carefully noting the appearance, clothing, and other characteristics of the robbers in order to carry out the investigation. Unexpectedly, less than an hour after the police chief returned to the station, another alarm was received from Santai Lane, Xinkaihe Road.</p>
<p>Four or Five Suspicious People on the Roadside: At the same time as the Dongxing Lane robbery, Captain Lu of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team had already heard the news and immediately ordered all detectives on duty to defend. Around 8:00 PM, detectives Han Ruisheng, Li Xiaobao, Chen Caifu, Gu Liancheng, Gao Yuhua, Wu Zuorong, Liu Rongfu, Wu Kezhong, Wang Zigui, and others were patrolling near Xiaodongmen when they suddenly spotted a young man in a Western suit leading four or five people who looked like workers, gathered by the roadside, whispering to each other, acting very suspiciously. The detectives exchanged knowing glances and carefully observed the movements of the people.</p>
<p>Four Robbers Apprehended Simultaneously: After the young man whispered to the others, they entered Dasheng Lane in single file and ran into Santai Lane. All of them rushed into No. 7. The detectives, witnessing the situation, knew that they were not good people, so they first reported to the patrol officer at the No. 5 patrol post at the entrance of the lane. At the same time, patrol officer Tang Mingtao happened to be leading a group of senior patrol officers on patrol and joined the ambush outside the door. Just as the robbers were about to start prying open the leather suitcase, the robber guarding the ground floor knew that the detectives were secretly deployed outside the door and urgently signaled the robbers upstairs to rush out the door to escape. The detectives caught them one by one. A total of four people were captured, and one real and one fake pistol were confiscated.</p>
<p>Robbers Were All From Guangdong: The robbers were taken to the second precinct of the first district for interrogation by the police chief. (1) Wang Amei, 36 years old; (2) Li Xiaomao, 28 years old; (3) Chen Maxi, 33 years old; (4) Cai Tianxing, 26 years old. All four were from Guangdong and confessed to planning the robbery of a Fujian resident at No. 7 Santai Lane. They completely denied the Dongxing Lane case on Danfeng Road, but Cai Tianxing was wearing a Western suit and was positively identified by the victim of the fish shop as being similar to the robber in the Western suit at the scene.</p>
<p>Another Robber Apprehended in the French Concession: Just as Chief Ma was finishing the interrogation, Detective Captain Lu Ying arrived by car and took all the robbers to the headquarters for strict interrogation. During the interrogation by Chief Ma, one of the robbers provided information about an accomplice hiding in a certain place in the French Concession. A senior patrol officer was immediately dispatched, along with the detectives of the French Concession, to arrest the robber at the address. He must wait for the preliminary hearing in court today before he can be brought back for questioning.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case in Xiaotang, Fengxian</p>
<h3>Two Robbers Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Connected to the Kidnapping of Ding Ziren</p>
<p>Temporarily Not Transferred to Inland for Questioning</p>
<p>In Du Village, Northwest Lixu, Xiaotang Township, Fengxian County, a kidnapping gang has organized a network to kidnap people for ransom. From the 24th to the 26th of last month, wealthy Kunshan residents Wang Songqi, Wang Bingsheng, Xu Caiming, Xu Genrong, and Wu Renzhai were successively kidnapped, and large sums of money were demanded for ransom. The Fengxian County Public Security Bureau learned of this and dispatched a team to rescue the hostages. Two robbers, Jiang Dahua and Hu Dengkui, were arrested. They confessed that their accomplices, Jiang Huanli and Chen Sishan (also known as Zhang Da Kuaitou), from northern Jiangsu, were hiding in Shanghai, on Xiaoshadu Road and Yichang Road. The Public Security Bureau ordered inspectors Chen Minggui and Xu Rongxiang to come to Shanghai and cooperate with detective Ma Mouxiang of the Putuo Road police station to arrest Jiang and Chen. They were transferred to the Special District Court the other day. According to the police station's lawyer, Ding Ziren, the manager of Fuxin Flour Mill, was kidnapped in western Shanghai last month and subsequently released, but the kidnappers in that case have not yet been apprehended. It is now found that Jiang and Chen are quite related to the Ding kidnapping case. Please temporarily detain them and do not rush to transfer them to the inland authorities for interrogation so that they can be investigated. Judge Cheng then questioned the two robbers briefly and ordered them to be detained for seven days pending the arrival of official documents from the county for further verification.</p>
<p>Expansion of Japanese Textile Mills in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Planned Expansion of 300,000 Spindles</h3>
<p>According to the "Dongbao" reported by the World News Agency, the current situation of Japanese textile mills in Shanghai under the silver appreciation is that the performance of Naigaimen, Goudai, Yufeng, Shanghai, and other companies continues to be good. For example, the Goudai Textile Mill has already exceeded its May futures, and the settlement of the January, February, and March futures under consideration is also expected to be increased after the revision of the tariff. Since last year, Chinese merchants have been requesting early delivery. Currently, there are settlements for February futures, and there is no concern about delivery. Regarding the purchase of raw cotton, each company has prepared to determine the exchange rate when ordering cotton yarn, which is not affected by the silver appreciation. Moreover, due to the increase in cotton yarn prices due to the silver appreciation, Japanese textile mills are more profitable in the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year. With the revision of the tax system, textile mills in China are in a more advantageous position in the sale of products compared to imported products. Currently, there are plans to expand factories by approximately 200,000 spindles, and there are plans for another 100,000 spindles. For example, Naigaimen Textile Mill is engaged in processing products in addition to spinning, in order to seek future development. The construction of large-scale processing factories is underway, and equipment will soon be produced for dyeing cotton cloth. Japanese textile mills in China have taken the opportunity to develop because Chinese textile mills do not strive to improve products and factory equipment, but only engage in speculation in raw cotton products and exchange rates to increase profits, which ultimately leads to failure. In particular, good water for processing, which has been a concern for many years, can now be obtained by digging 500 feet underground. In the future, it seems that the time is ripe to engage in the processing of cotton cloth as well.</p>
<p>Unresolved Case of Indian Soldier Shooting Wang Jingtao</p>
<h3>Widow Pleads for Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Difficult Situation of Family Members</p>
<p>On the afternoon of March 31, 1927, at 7:30 PM, in front of the Wang Family Residence, northeast of Gaolang Bridge, Hudong, on the border between the Chinese-administered area and the international concession, an Indian soldier shot and killed Wang Jingtao, a local resident. The case remains unresolved. Wang's widow, Mrs. Wang Mao, is now facing increasing financial strain as her children grow older, and her deceased husband's coffin remains exposed in the field, unburied. The living are suffering injustice, and the dead cannot rest in peace. She is specifically requesting the Municipal Council to compensate for the loss of her husband's life with 20,000 yuan. However, the Municipal Council replied, agreeing to donate only 100 yuan. After receiving the reply, Mrs. Mao immediately wrote to rebut the reasons given by the Municipal Council and submitted a request to the Municipal Government to initiate negotiations. She also sent letters to Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Xinliu, Hu Mengjia, Wu Hua Dong, Qian Longzhang, Lin Kanghou, Chen Tingrui, Li Fuxun, Wu Yunzhai, Qin Runxiang, and the Six-Hua Committee, requesting that they uphold justice and provide assistance. It is learned that Mrs. Wang Mao's household includes her husband's aunt, Cai, who is already over sixty and still depends on Mrs. Mao for support. Wang Jingtao left behind four children: the eldest son, Quan Gen, 15 years old; the second daughter, Bao Zhen, 12 years old; the third daughter, Feng Zhen, 10 years old; and the fourth son, Hesheng, 6 years old. The family relies entirely on Mrs. Mao's wages from working at a textile mill to survive. However, Mrs. Mao is, after all, a woman who has been sincere, and her monthly wage is only twelve yuan. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to support the family. Mrs. Mao, though young, is not like modern women; she is a traditional housewife who upholds etiquette, respects her aunt, and treats her neighbors with respect. She is a rare example of a woman in modern society who is dedicated to caring for her in-laws, raising her children, and guarding her chastity as a widow. It is also learned that Mrs. Mao is extremely saddened by the fact that her husband was tragically shot and killed by an Indian soldier for no reason and is still seeking redress. She is pleading with the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession and the United Citizens Association to provide assistance in order to facilitate negotiations.</p>
<p>Conflict Over Introduction Fee</p>
<h3>Worker Falsely Accused of Theft</h3>
<p>Yao Yonggui and Wife Despicable</p>
<p>Fined Thirty Yuan After Interrogation</p>
<p>Yao Yonggui, from northern Jiangsu, has been working as a foreman at the Japanese rubber factory on Ningguo Road. Anyone who wants to work at the factory must be introduced by him, and he takes the opportunity to demand an introduction fee. On the 14th of last month, Xu Hongsheng, Wang Da, Zhang Yi, Wang Er, and others went to Yao's house at 300 Huade Road to ask him to recommend them. Yao demanded a fee of ten yuan per person, but Xu and the others had no money and agreed to deduct it from their first paycheck. Yao refused, which led to a conflict. After they left, Yao and his wife, Sun, reported to the Yangshupu police station that the four men were thieves, claiming that they had entered the house with guns to commit robbery and that the family had secretly fled and called for help before they escaped. After the head of the patrol sent detectives to investigate, they initially did not know it was a false accusation. Later, they went to the rubber factory to inquire, and the Japanese manager said that he had gone to Yao's house at 9:00 PM to select workers and had not heard anything about a robbery. The patrol officers stationed near Yao's house also reported that they had not heard any cries for help. It was then determined that Yao and his wife had fabricated the robbery. The other day, they were detained and brought to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xiao interrogated them. Xu Hongsheng and the other four were also summoned to court and testified that they had asked Yao to recommend them for work at 9:00 PM that night, but he had demanded money and a conflict had occurred. Yao and his wife still stubbornly denied the accusations. After questioning, Judge Xiao sentenced Yao Yonggui and Yao Sunshi each to a fine of thirty yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Shen Yuehui Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Kang Huixiang and Yu Ligang, owners of the Huamei Yuji National Products Store in the French Concession, represented by lawyers, criminally accused Shen Yuehui in the French court, stating that the plaintiffs had previously employed Shen Yuehui as a manager but that he had successively embezzled funds totaling several thousand yuan and torn out several pages of the accounting books. They are now submitting the accounting books to the court for verification and requesting that he be prosecuted according to criminal law and that the embezzled funds be recovered. The defendant, represented by a lawyer, argued that although the defendant had deficits, they were not so large and that he had not torn out any pages of the accounting books. The judge ordered that the accountant Pan Zhaobang settle the accounts to determine whether the defendant had committed any acts of misappropriation and then make a decision.</p>
<h3>Litigation After the Closure of Changfa Hotel</h3>
<p>The Changfa Hotel in the French Concession opened on September 24 of last year and suddenly closed on December 6 of the same year. The creditors, including the hotel's employees and teahouse staff, totaling twenty-six people, elected Ye Juyuan and Ren Dejun as representatives and hired a lawyer to sue the hotel's owner, You Zhongshan, and manager, Cheng Ruiting, for fraud in the French Court's Criminal Division. The plaintiff's lawyer stated the other day that the plaintiffs, as employees and tea house staff, had each paid deposits ranging from fifty to one hundred yuan, totaling three thousand six hundred and thirty-five yuan. The hotel closed shortly after opening, which constitutes fraud. He requested an investigation and permission to appoint someone to liquidate the assets. The defendant You Zhongshan did not appear. Cheng Ruiting hired a lawyer to defend him. Cheng Ruiting, said Changfa Hotel was opened by You Zhongshan, and the client Cheng Ruiting was merely the manager. All the funds were taken by You alone, and Cheng had no responsibility. Please, Judge Zhu, clarified, and then assign accountant Pan Zhaobang to liquidate the donation report.</p>

<p>And Fined One Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Rong Xianzhou, the Si Zhen (person in charge of financial relief) of the Tongyu foreign goods store on Wuchang Road, was a Cantonese who was addicted to gambling on weekdays and embezzled 25,000 yuan of store funds. As a result, he was exposed and prosecuted. The Special District Local Court has been hearing the case and has been detaining Rong. It has been reported in the previous report. It is now learned that this case was sentenced the other day by Judge Xiao to one year and six months of imprisonment and a fine of one thousand yuan. If he is unable to pay the fine, he will be allowed to commute the sentence at the rate of three yuan per month and compensate the plaintiff for 20,003 yuan, 5 Jiao, and 3 Fen.</p>
<h3>Yangsiqiao Robbers Break Into Home and Injure Person</h3>
<p>The family of Mrs. Zhou Xia, a wealthy woman living at No. 6 Zhoujiaqiao, Yangsiqiao, Pudong, has often been targeted by thieves. On the evening of the other day, robbers suddenly jumped into her home and used a huge rock to break open the inner door. They tied up her limbs with ropes and forced her to reveal the location of her hidden money. When she refused to speak, they cut her leg with a knife. As a result, they robbed her of 160 silver dollars and three gold rings. Afterwards, Mrs. Zhou filed a complaint with the third precinct of the third district, claiming that she had been robbed by Zhou Gengsheng and Zhou Mingcai, who lived in the same house and had the same surname as her, and identified the two Zhous as having tied her up. The police were dispatched to arrest the two Zhous, but they denied the accusations. Therefore, they were transferred to the local court for interrogation yesterday, and Mrs. Zhou was ordered to be examined at the court for her injuries.</p>
<h3>Robbers Come and Go Freely in Shanghai's South</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 PM last night, at the home of Lu Fengsheng, who runs a foreign goods business at No. 10 South Dahua Lane, Caojiaqiao, Ximen, Shanghai South, the girl living with him happened to open the front door to go out shopping and did not close it properly, allowing five robbers to break in. One of them, wearing a Western suit, held a gun, while the other four were dressed in blue cloth short shirts and pants, looking like workers. When they entered the living room, Lu's maid was having dinner, and the robbers asked if the owner was home. The maid replied that the owner had not returned home yet and asked the mistress if she had gone out. The robbers demanded the keys to the bedroom door, but the maid said that the mistress had taken them. Therefore, the robbers could not enter Lu's bedroom. Two robbers guarded the front and back doors, while three robbers went upstairs and robbed the family of Tang, who lived in the pavilion room, of a large amount of silver dollars, silk, and fur clothing. All the boxes were pried open. While the robbery was in progress, Lu's maid took the opportunity to climb over the clothes drying rack to the neighbor's house and went out to call the police. By the time the police arrived, the robbers had already left through the front door, like a yellow crane taking flight. Afterwards, the Tang family checked the stolen items and filed a report with the second precinct of the second district, requesting that the robbers be arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, in Dongxing Lane, the jurisdiction of the second precinct of the first district, four robbers suddenly came to a certain household in Dongxing Lane, No. 1, in the city's first district and second precinct. Two were wearing Western suits and carrying guns, and two were wearing black long robes. On the pretext of asking for information, they tricked the residents into opening the door and robbed them of silver dollars, clothing, and other items. Because the owner was out, the details of the robbed items are being determined, and a report has been filed with the second precinct of the first district, requesting an investigation. It is heard that after receiving the report, Police Chief Ma immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau by telephone and notified the various districts to assist in the investigation.</p>
<h3>Land Guardian Accused of Stealing Grain and Seizing Land</h3>
<p>Sun Mingde, a local resident, inherited an ancestral tomb plot located in the Huxieqiao area of Shanghai, designated as the 13th map of the 25th Bao. He held the land deed. However, Sun lost his parents at a young age and has been doing business elsewhere, so he paid little attention to his ancestors' burial grounds. Recently, the market in the west of Shanghai has flourished, and land prices have soared. Sun, now an adult, remembered his ancestors. However, he could not find the tomb plot. Although he held the land deed, he had not paid land tax for many years, so he did not know who had encroached upon or stolen the land. This time, when the winter grain tax was being collected, he went to the grain depot to pay the tax. Unexpectedly, Cao Zhixiang, the former land guardian of the 13th map of the 15th Bao, also went to pay the tax. The Land Bureau's Shanghai South Land Tax Collection Office inquired about the land's origin and refused to accept the tax on the spot. Cao Zhixiang then punched the grain counter and shouted loudly, claiming that he would deal with the collection officer. The collection office then telephoned the Land Bureau, which dispatched police to the scene and arrested Cao. At the same time, Sun also accused the land guardian of stealing grain, seizing land, and excavating graves, demanding investigation and prosecution, and requesting the Land Bureau Director to interrogate him. He was then transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Now, upon receipt of the warrant, Sun Mingde is ordered to file a lawsuit in court, after which the case will be summoned and the suspect escorted for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Fabric Shop Salesman Robbed of Account Money</h3>
<p>Chen, a salesman from the Xuyuan Fabric Shop on Huining Road in the south of Shanghai, was collecting account money outside on the afternoon before last, around 7 p.m. On his way back to the shop, not far from the shop, three bandits suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two bandits were wearing overcoats, and one was wearing a long coat and a copper-basin felt hat. One of them held a pistol. They rushed up and stopped the salesman, threatening him into silence. They then searched him and robbed him of 150 silver dollars that Chen had collected, and fled. The shop reported the incident to the Second Precinct, Second Sub-station of the district, requesting them to pursue and arrest the thieves and recover the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Pedestrians Searched and Box Cannon Confiscated</h3>
<p>At around 8:30 p.m. last night, the patrol team of the French Concession Special Agency was inspecting pedestrians in the area of Rue Père Froc and Dapu Bridge when they noticed two people who looked flustered and attempted to turn back and escape. The detectives bravely stepped forward and apprehended them. They found two box cannons on their persons. They immediately took the men to the police station and handed them over to the French Court this morning for review.</p>
<h3>Wife and Concubine Incompatible After Husband's Death</h3>
<p>Wei Yangbao (a native of Pudong), who resided at No. 50 Yangjiazhai in Pudong and formerly worked as a rust removal foreman at the Rui Rong Shipyard, had accumulated some wealth over the years. However, he had no children. He took Zhu (age 31) as a concubine and built a separate residence near Taoyuanzhai for her to live in. In August of this year (lunar calendar), Wei suddenly died of a sudden illness in a certain opium den. Upon notification, Zhu had Wei's body transported back for the funeral. However, Wei's legal wife, Wu (age 39), learned that important items of clothing that Wei had acquired during his lifetime were missing. She then cried loudly and lay in Wei's coffin, preventing the encoffining. After much mediation by relatives and friends, and after forcing Zhu to hand over IOUs for loans totaling over 10,000 yuan to be divided equally, she relented. However, only one day after Wei's death, his wife and concubine regarded each other as enemies and repeatedly quarreled. The day before yesterday, Zhu hired workers to build a tomb enclosure for Wei's grave. Wu complained that the work was not good enough and questioned Zhu for not spending enough money. The two women then began to argue again. Wu, who was naturally weak and powerless, was no match for Zhu. That night, she and Wei's younger brother, Fusheng, went to Zhu's residence to negotiate. Zhu had already hired people to protect her and blew a whistle frantically, shouting that there were thieves. The patrol police arrived at the scene and took Wu, Zhu, and Wei's younger brother, Fusheng, to the district office for questioning. After questioning, the district chief determined that the case involved a family dispute and ordered Wei Fusheng to be released on bail and told them to file a lawsuit in court.</p>
<h3>A Man Died Inside a Locomotive</h3>
<p>Died from Poverty and Illness</p>
<p>At 10:35 a.m. yesterday, someone reported to the police officer Quan Ganting at No. 33, Alley 211, Beijing-Jiang Road, Zhabei, that there was a male corpse there. Upon receiving the report, Officer Quan immediately informed Patrol Chief Wang Zhongxing of the Zhongxing Road Police Station, who went to investigate. The deceased was about 30 years old, barefoot, with a shaved head, wearing a torn cotton robe with thermal underwear underneath and torn cotton pants. He died inside an old locomotive. It was unknown when this old locomotive was placed there. It had been there for a long time, and homeless people often used it as a shelter. According to nearby residents, the deceased made a living by selling wood shavings. Recently, he had been suffering from hunger and cold and was ill, which led to his death. After investigating, the patrol chief immediately reported the case to the Fourth District and instructed Shen Xiaowu, the land guardian of the 11th map, to report to the local court for a post-mortem examination.</p>
<h3>Scavenging Woman Deceived into Being an "Eldest Sister"</h3>
<p>A tenant named Zhou, residing at No. 37 Jiuruli, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, had moved in just over a month ago. The second landlord, Zhao, did not know what kind of business Zhou was engaged in. Beside the garbage bins in the alley, there was often a poor woman who picked up rags. This woman, about 16 years old, collected old cloth scraps in the alley. Although her hair was disheveled and her face was dirty, her appearance was still passable. Zhou saw her and thought there was profit to be made, so he falsely claimed to the woman that his family lacked an "eldest sister" and offered to pay her a monthly wage of one yuan to hire her as an "eldest sister" to work at his home. Before half a month had passed, Zhou terminated his lease with the second landlord and moved away. The woman was also taken away by Zhou, and her whereabouts were unknown. The woman's father repeatedly went to the second landlord to investigate, but he did not know where she had gone. A few days ago, Zhou's father came to retrieve some scattered items that he had forgotten when he moved. He was then arrested by the woman's father and taken to the Second Sub-station of the Fifth District for questioning. He was found guilty and ordered to hand over Zhou to be brought to justice and questioned.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Female Worker Jumps into River, Rescued</h3>
<p>Feared She Could Not Support Her Family</p>
<p>Wang Yao, a young woman from Ningbo, is 29 years old this year. Her husband passed away more than a year ago. Her parents-in-law and two sons still live in her hometown. The eldest son, Qingfa, is nine years old, and the second son, Zhifu, is seven years old. The family of five struggled to make a living. Later, she was introduced to work as a female worker at the Shenxin Yarn Factory in Shanghai, residing at a certain address in Juxingli, Gaolang Bridge. Every day, she remitted all of her wages, except for her room and board expenses, back to her hometown to support her family. However, good things do not last. The yarn factory has been shutting down one after another for two months due to financial difficulties. She suddenly became panicked and anxious, thinking about how her family back home would survive. Yesterday, at 1:30 p.m., she jumped into the Huangpu River from the Waibaidu Bridge. Fortunately, it was during the day and she was rescued by a sampan boat. The police officer from Post 469 came to escort her to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, she was taken back to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Person Crushed to Death by Car</h3>
<p>Zhang Shouyi, a 41-year-old man from Jiangbei, residing at No. 435 Jishanli, Yangzhou Road, Yangshupu, was walking along Pingliang Road at around 2 p.m. yesterday when a speeding delivery truck, No. 12345, from Yunfei Motor Transport Company came by. Zhang was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground. The wheels ran over his abdomen, breaking his ribs. Blood gushed out like a fountain, and he died on the spot. Police Officer No. 1702 investigated and recorded the car number. The body was transported by car to Tongren Hospital and then to the Forensic Examination Office on Faelun Road for examination.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Guangdong Grand Theatre</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Grand Theatre held its grand opening ceremony the day before yesterday (the 31st). The venue was filled with flowers and national flags, creating a very solemn atmosphere. By noon, guests had arrived in droves. Fortunately, the theatre had ample space and was attended by many socialites who helped with the reception, so the order was well maintained. By 2 p.m., even more guests had arrived, and there were barely enough seats. At 2:30 p.m., the bell rang to start the meeting, and Western music was played. First, Ms. Pu Jinyuan went on stage to perform the opening ceremony of smashing a bottle and delivered a speech, briefly stating that the theatre was grandly established and would be victorious in its future operations. Then, Mr. Ou, representing the general manager Li Yaolai, delivered an opening speech and invited famous people from all walks of life, including Jiang Jiemin, Zhou Shaoxing, Lao Jingxiu, Wang Siji, Lin Shusen, Liu Yuzhou, and representatives from the Qunhe Sanyu Association, to speak in turn. The full members of the Sanyu Music Society performed Cantonese music, and the sound of strings and bamboo was very pleasant to listen to. Then, members of the Jiande Music Society performed comedic dances, which were applauded continuously by the audience. After that, the Grape Girls Dance Troupe performed the Three Butterflies Dance, and male and female stars from Tianyi Film Company performed the one-act play "The Real and Fake Mother's Brother," which was very entertaining.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi's Report on Returning from the Belgian Exposition (Continuation 3)</h3>
<p>(IV) Held an Art Exhibition in America. In addition to the 180-odd crates of industrial, commercial, educational and agricultural products from our country that participated in the Belgian Exposition, there were also many paintings by famous domestic artists, collected by Mr. Ye Gongchuo, with a total value of more than 70,000 national currency. These paintings were carefully crafted by modern painters and truly represent Chinese art. Unfortunately, due to the limited space at the venue, they could not all be displayed at the same time. In order to promote Chinese art, Minyi held a Chinese art exhibition at the Liège Art Association in Belgium and displayed 180-odd paintings collected from various artists as much as possible for foreigners to view. The official opening was on October 5. Minyi, together with all the staff of the representative office, personally attended the opening ceremony and invited people from all walks of life in Belgium and from various countries participating in the Belgian Exposition to visit. At the opening ceremony, Minyi gave a speech on the value of Chinese art and its differences from the art of other countries, which foreigners were able to appreciate. The number of visitors was very large.</p>
<p>(V) Visited the Belgian Crown Prince and Presented Souvenirs. Earlier, on August 2, the Belgian King, accompanied by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, the Provincial Governor, and the Mayor, visited our country's exhibition hall. Minyi and others received them as required. The Belgian King praised our country's products and arrangement. Minyi, on behalf of our government, expressed his gratitude. Later, Minyi consulted with the Chargé d'Affaires in Belgium and planned to present several gifts to the Belgian King after the closing of the exposition as a memorial. Therefore, a few days before returning to China, he and Xie, the Chargé d'Affaires in Belgium, the Deputy Representative Liu Xichang, and the Secretary Zhou Shida, took the souvenirs to Brussels to visit the Belgian King. The Belgian King was out traveling, so the Crown Prince received them on his behalf. Minyi presented the gifts and inquired about the King's health. The Belgian Crown Prince expressed his deep gratitude and wished our country prosperity and the Chairman good health, saying that he firmly believed that the relationship between China and Belgium would become stronger in the future.</p>
<p>(VI) The Belgian Exposition Closed and Our Country's Exhibition Hall Closed. The Belgian Exposition closed on November 3 of the current year, after running for six months. During this period, the number of visitors to our country's exhibition hall was very large every day. Although there are no precise statistics, it is estimated that there were several thousand visitors from various countries every day. Two-thirds of the various industrial and commercial products that were of a saleable nature have been sold. This is the opposite of the exhibition halls of other countries. This is because our country's products are priced low. Moreover, foreigners are curious and are more interested in what they are not used to seeing, which are nothing more than mechanical products. Now, they see our country's exquisite and beautiful handicrafts and admire them greatly, especially the women. Among the various products, tea, silk, porcelain, cotton, pottery, silverware, carvings, carpets, and palace lanterns were the most popular with foreigners. From this, it can be seen that our country's products can be developed abroad and increase international trade. It is not an empty word. It is hoped that domestic merchants will have a broad vision and shift their focus outward. Moreover, many manufacturers have learned that our country's products are priced low and have realized the benefits of direct trade. They have come to inquire about the addresses of the product manufacturers and are preparing for direct transactions. We have introduced them one by one. Two-thirds of the industrial and commercial products have already been sold, and the proceeds will be remitted to China to pay the exhibitors. The remaining one-third of the products were packed into fifty crates when the exhibition hall closed and transported by Japanese ships, so that the previous promises could be fulfilled (all items sold will be paid for at the original price, otherwise the original items will be returned) to maintain the credibility of this exhibition and encourage merchants to participate in international exhibitions in the future and no longer hesitate. However, most of the various educational and agricultural products are the achievements of schools at all levels in various places. Since there is no capital involved and the value is not significant, the representative office sent circulars to the exhibiting institutions to solicit their consent on whether they would be willing to donate them to the Belgian government for display in museums or libraries for a long time. Those institutions that replied agreeing have all been donated to the Belgian government. Those who did not want to have their products returned. This is the general situation of the closing of our country's exhibition hall. At this point, all the staff of the representative office set off to return to China one after another. Minyi took the route through the United States and arrived in Shanghai on December 13 of last year. Deputy Representative Liu Xichang, accompanied by Secretary Tian Shoucheng and attendant Jin Shoufeng, took the route through Siberia to return to China and have all safely arrived in the country.

<h3>Youth Advancement Guidance</h3>
<p>By Tang Bin</p>
<p>The biggest problems for young people are naturally the three of (choosing a school, choosing a career, choosing a spouse), and (choosing a school) should be resolved first because it is preparing for the (choosing a career) period. In this way, (choosing a school) occupies the most important key in a young person's life, so parents, teachers, and the person himself should attach great importance to it. Shanghai has almost become the center of various industries, and even young people from afar travel long distances and endure hardships to study here out of a desire to learn. This sincere enthusiasm is really worthy of people's praise, but it is inevitable that people will be unfamiliar and come here rashly because the school they enter is not close to their nature or is deceived. Therefore, in the present era, even the (advancement) level must obtain good guidance.</p>
<p>Nowadays, young people undoubtedly regard the issue of advancement as the key to personal success or failure in life and cannot casually ignore it, fearing that they will leave a hidden danger for the rest of their lives. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the meaning and purpose of advancement beforehand and to achieve a truly worthy advancement in order to create a useful professional talent for society and strive for the future of himself and the entire Chinese nation. Therefore, young people must attach importance to the issue of advancement. If you want to seek good instructions, then this recently published book (Youth Advancement Guidance) is worth describing.</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly describe its contents as a reference for those preparing for advancement. The first chapter (Introduction) is devoted to describing the importance of the issue of advancement. The French philosopher Rousseau once said (A person has two birth periods: the time of birth is the first birth period, and the period from childhood to youth is the second birth period). This is a fact recognized by modern psychologists, physiologists, and educators, and there is no doubt about it. Here, only the (youth period) is described. According to our country's school system, when a person reaches the youth period, it is the time when secondary schools are about to end and they are about to receive higher education or enter society. During this period, young people have many personal problems due to the sudden changes in their physiology and psychology, and they all feel them during this period and urgently seek solutions. (The youth period is a key to success or failure in life, so Rousseau calls it (the second birth period).) This issue of advancement was originally not a problem in modern civilized countries. However, in China, it is not only a personal problem for young people, but it has also become a very big problem in Chinese society and education. Many young people who are eager to learn and whose talents and learning can be cultivated cannot enter vocational schools or universities because of economic reasons. I don’t know how many there are in Chinese society. That is, if the economy is not a problem, I don’t know how many opportunities they have to enter vocational schools or universities to study. The author's investigation on this is extremely detailed, and at the same time, it allows us to recognize the importance of the issue of youth advancement.</p>
<p>(The meaning and purpose of advancement) This is the second chapter of the book. The so-called advancement means that after a certain stage of study has been completed, continuing to study and learn in a higher-level school has other meanings. For example, if our initial course of study does not have a foundation, it will definitely be fruitless to enter a higher-level school. This is what young people preparing for advancement must understand most. At the same time, in reality, they have entered a higher-level school, but they have not really engaged in learning. This phenomenon of (advancing without learning) can be found in all schools in our country at any time and in any place. What is the meaning and value of this kind of advancement? Regarding these, young people must obtain good instructions. This is what is meant by having a clear understanding of (the purpose of advancement), which is nothing more than truly striving for (increasing knowledge) and (researching academic studies), and must not satisfy their vanity by seeking a degree. The author has given practical instructions in this book.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 (Self-examination Before Advancement). Advancement is originally an extremely proper matter, so we should first reflect on it beforehand. Although advancement is a manifestation of young people's efforts to improve themselves and should be actively encouraged, the fact is not so. Many young people have many troubles because of the issue of advancement, because after advancement, they end up losing their jobs. Some (regret it) and some (give up halfway) without finishing. Therefore, the author's raising this issue of reflection is very important. (1) We must investigate the curriculum and facilities of the school we are preparing to enter, and whether various aspects of the teaching can satisfy our desire for knowledge. (2) Do we have sufficient economic preparation? (3) Is the curriculum we are studying similar to our ambitions, talents, interests, and subjects? (4) Is the study we are studying urgently needed by society? The questions raised for discussion can all be used as a reference for young people to advance. If this meaningful (reflection) is carried out, then the various phenomena listed above will definitely not occur.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 (Preparation Before Advancement). This describes the two types of (economic preparation) and (knowledge preparation). Chapter 5 (How to Choose a School). This is the most important issue during the advancement period. Standards for selection (1) School facilities (2) School professors (2) School curriculum (4) School fees and the cost of living in the area where it is located (5) Future career paths. Methods of investigation (1) Request a prospectus (2) Visit the school in person (3) Inquire with students of the school or teachers who graduated from the school (4) Entrust an investigation. If we do this in a planned way, we will definitely not waste time, money, and labor in vain. Chapter 6 (How to Deal with Entrance Exams) (1) Establish a review procedure (2) Pay attention to review methods (3) Take care of physical and mental health. The author has also listed in detail various matters that should be paid attention to during the on-site exam. Chapter 7 (A Word to Young People Aspiring to Study Education). Chapters 8 (to 19) are words to young men and women who aspire to study agriculture, industry, commerce, law, politics, literature, art, sports, medicine, journalism, library science, natural science, and home economics, and an annex with detailed tables of this subject offered by each school is available for reference by those seeking advancement. Chapter 20 (Short-term Schools, Tutoring Schools, and Correspondence Schools). This is of great help to young people who lack economic strength and time. The author has also discussed in detail other topics such as (the problem of work-study), (the problem of self-study), and the general situation of advancement in Western and Eastern countries.</p>
