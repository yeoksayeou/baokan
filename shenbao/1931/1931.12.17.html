<h3 id="c18">嚴重時期之國民黨與國民 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>自甯粤對峙之局成。政治上之紛擾旣已半年。粤方言統一政局。輒舉蔣中正氏下野爲先决條件。代表奔走。和會磋商。時日遷延。統一迄難見諸事實。而强冦外迫。飢饉内擾。國脈民命。愈趨危急。迄至今兹。而蔣氏决然引退。半載以來混沌之時局。至此乃頓時急轉直下。放射出一線晴霽之陽光。</p>
<p>然而就今日之情勢而觀。吾人果遂可以欣然色喜。以爲政治遂可從兹臻於清明。統一之局遂可長久乎。即一般政治上之領袖人物。亦遂可視今日之所得。爲主張之勝利。而遂躊躇滿志乎。吾人認爲正以蔣氏之引退。新舊交替。此一時期。此一階段。乃最爲嚴重最爲吃緊。我舉國人民與執政之國民黨。從兹亟應以新生命之精神。努力於國是之更張。</p>
<p>革命迄今已歷五年。以言時日。不可謂暫。革命伊始。人民何嘗不彈冠相慶。差欣今後我國家我民族庶幾其有復興之機。然而五載艱難。民命塗炭。迄至目前。更强敵外侵。山河破碎。洪水内迫民無死所。革命前後殆使人民興起不堪回首之慨。誰爲爲之。孰令致之此則執政之黨與舉國之人民所不能辭其責者也。</p>
<p>吾人認爲一國之政黨之能存在。能博得人民之擁護。不僅在於有主義有黨綱有政策。而尤在於主義政策黨綱之能切實執行。能切實兌現。今執政之國民黨。固自有其主義政策與黨綱也。然而五年以來。實現者有幾。即執行者又有幾。即有能切實執行。促其實現。其是否能適合於國家與人民之要求。尚爲問題。何况主義成具文。政策爲口頭禪。徒以同一信仰之同志。而滋生無數之糾紛。是烏乎能底定國是。是烏乎能安定人心。是烏乎而不致内亂召外侮。近五年來。人民授與國民黨以爲政之充分機會。忍受一切苦痛。而日復一日。執政之黨。終無以饜民衆之望。目前國脈絲屬。不絶如縷。此種責任。執政之黨詎豈能辭。故今日政治情勢之突呈轉捩。正爲國民黨自贖自新之機。據今日黨政領袖之表示。亦自認赴京爲整理中央政務。吾人深期此整理兩字。能眞誠實踐。能切實兌現。瓜蔓不堪三折。今日已至最後之時機矣。國民黨今後而仍不能實行其主義與政策。一般領袖仍從事於政見或權利上之爭持。則民意無常。絶望之最後。誰能保在政治上不能引起突然之變化。此今日執政之黨。所應認清所應覺悟者也。</p>
<p>至其在我人民者。則對此艱難時局之造成。亦不能遂謂不負若何之責任何也。國以民爲主體。人民對政治。即應時時負監督之責。有負責之人民。而後乃有負責之政府。而後有清明之政治。孫中山先生曾言。「政就是衆人之事。治就是管理」。是則衆人之事。自應衆人共理。雖政府以人民之授與。得有行政上之特權而人民固不容遂依人以生。對政治毫不顧問此一理論。今已爲衆所共明。獨是知而不爲。放棄責任而不負。故以致今日政治上之混亂。又以致今日國步之艱難。兹後而欲打破國難挽救危局。新我國家拯我民族。則舉國人民亟應切實負起監督政府之責。使政府成爲人民之政府。政治成爲人民之政治。而後有成。際兹時局轉換。亦實爲我人民努力自救。并以救國之唯一時機</p>
<p>新舊交替。時代轉換。凛過往之覆轍。一切自應改弦更張。從新做起。吾人請更於今後數日。就過去政治之得失。分陳所見藉以貢其蒭蕘。</p>

<p>日犬養内閣决定貫澈田中政策</p>
<p>昨日閣議提出增兵案</p>
<p>芳澤經西比利亞返國</p>
<p>元老西園寺病勢可虞</p>
<p>▲日聯社十六日東京電　犬養内閣之對滿方針、决定實行田中内閣旣定之滿蒙方針、然犬養内閣成立後、因國内問題甚多、未便討論對滿方針、今已斷行禁金輸出、政務次官人選亦已决定、擬於十六日閣議首次協議對滿態度、並因閣員中有人主張對國民宣布現内閣之對滿方針爲緊急辦法、故於日内將發表關於滿蒙問題之聲明書、</p>
<p>▲電能社十六日東京電　日政府以錦州方面中國軍隊尚未撤退關内、將實行澈底的攻擊錦州侵入關内、定於本日午後閣議提出增兵案、以爲攻錦之準備、聞荒木陵相將派○○師團之混成旅、與○○師團步兵兩旅開往錦州云、</p>
<p>▲路透社十六日東京電　路透訪員探悉、日本因張學良將撤錦州軍隊退入關内、故再派日兵一師半前往滿洲之議、業已打銷、但今日午後内閣開會、將討論派兵一混成旅前往關東租借地、聞因北地嚴寒、兵士久役、多須休養、故欲續派兵前去接防也、如此議果被核准、則此混成旅中將撥出一二大隊開往天津、以防蔣介石辭職後、因華北政治軍事大局不定而起之騷擾也、</p>
<p>▲路透社十六日巴黎電　駐法日大使芳澤現已接受新内閣外相職、定星期五挈眷取道西比利亞返國履新、法報對於芳澤之任外相、頗多美評、巴黎時報指芳澤爲對於中日兩國對國聯之擔任而具有最穩健觀念之外交家、在國聯行政會處理滿洲爭端之極難談判中、表示極廣大之温和精神云、觀察遠東政治者預料芳澤就新職時、日本對外政策將無甚更動、</p>
<p>▲電通社十六日興津電　西園寺元老爲後繼内閣問題、奉召到京、待决定内閣後、復於十三日返興津之坐漁莊、不料突感風邪、病勢頗爲沉重、現由勝治醫學博士極力診治、但恐年邁力衰、不可樂觀、</p>
<p>▲日聯十六東京電　關於鈔票停止兌現之緊急勅令案已在十六日之樞府審查委員會照原案可决、俟十七日在臨時樞府會議可决後、得御諮詢、擬即日施行發令</p>
<p>▲路透十六日東京電　樞密院今日午後開會、討論鈔票停止兌現問題、詢及即下勅令之必要一節、藏相高橋請爲挽救公共禍患計、此舉實屬必要、且因事急不及待議會之核准、又謂渠擬儘速取銷此舉、又問當一九二七年施行金禁令時、何以不必施此舉、高橋答稱、當時中央銀行儲存現金共值十一萬萬元、而今則僅值五萬萬元、高橋又謂渠意金禁令雖已使物價漲高、但足鼓起内國工業與出口貿易、而因以減少失業工人、恢復日本所已失之商塲云、</p>
<p>▲日聯十六日東京電　現在民政黨衆議院議員數爲二百五十之絶對多數、而政友會不過一百七十人、犬養内閣以此少數黨如何對付行將開會之議會、爲各方面所注目、政府方面依照憲政常道、决意解散議會、重行總選舉、然政友會内部决非徒望議會之解散、即政府黨將於議會重開之前、擬與民政黨開始交涉、商義妥協辦法、民政黨若將接收此案、希望圓滿妥協、則議會不必解散、不然若經民政黨拒絶交涉、則斷然解散議會實行總選舉、民政黨對於政府黨此種交涉、將採如何態度、不能預知、議會解散或不解散、全靠民政黨之態度、</p>

<p>資本主義換一新面目</p>
<p>對華侵略將變本加厲</p>
<p>▲國民十五日莫斯科電　蘇俄半官機關報伊斯維斯的亞報、評論日内閣更迭事、預料今後日本資本主義與帝國主義將益變本加厲、謂民政黨與政友會俱屬資本主義政黨、所不同者僅政友會與大實業家及大地主較爲接近耳、故兩黨之易位、在實際上亦無差異、預料今後日本在東三省及全中國與遠東一帶、將視前益爲活動、益肆侵略、其新政府將採用補助實業與增加通貨政策、蓋日本資本主義者冀用此法、以挽救經濟厄運而增財富也、今後對於輸出將盡力擴張、但結果將使日本工人生活程度愈益低落、更增民衆之不滿意、使革命危機益見促進云、</p>

<p>俄農部强迫植棉頒發新令</p>
<p>▲路透十六日里加電　蘇俄農業委員會今日發一新命令其實質爲「不作工、無飯吃、」該項命令謂蘇俄中亞産棉區域中之人、凡身體健全者、無論男女及幼孩、皆必須在棉田中工作、麵包與其他食物、將嚴格按照其工作之多寡而發給之、蘇俄因本季採棉成績不佳、故有此令、</p>

<p>▲路透十五日挪威京城電　挪威瑞典丹麥三國、皆仿效英國、停用金本位、大約因此關係、挪威主要銀行兩家、昨日停止付現、已依照挪威銀行法請渠停付三個月之許可、（路透社註、上海挪威總領事謂已接到挪京情報、兩銀行之准停止付現三月、非因其財政地位之虚弱、但因其在整理其將來營業方針時、有阻止繼續提欵之必要耳、此兩銀行所遇之困難、即爲國際金融之緊張、挪威人士對此殊爲鎭靜、金融界深信挪威銀行制度之穩健、故挪威與紐約間之匯率、自兩銀行停付消息發表後、未有不利之影響云、）</p>

<p>▲國民社十五日羅馬電、印度獨立運動領袖甘地氏今午自畢靈地璽乘船返印、彼所乘者爲畢爾斯那號船之三等艙、但岸上歡送者極衆、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯十六日孟買電　政治暗殺層見迭出、但印度報紙毫未加以批評、緣印度報界恐　當事之怒、對于暗殺不敢贊成、然亦無極積指謫之詞、最近孟加拉英國法官被刺案、在印度政治暗殺史上爲唯一之先例、因印度婦人犯政治罪者、此實第一次、在此以前、印度婦人不過爲革命黨人之助手而已、自一九二八年以來、計有軍官十二人被刺、而謀殺未遂者不下二十次、凡此諸案均屬政治恐怖主義之範圍云、</p>

<p>▲國民十六日瑪德里電　西班牙新閣定今晨就職、今夜出席國會、據聞在國會保可得大多數、蓋現政府在國會内以獨立份子及均田黨社會黨與急進社會黨爲基礎、再加以共和黨内擁護政府各黨員、</p>
<p>▲國民十六日瑪德里電　西班牙前外長勒樂領袖之急進黨議員九十四人、聲明已確定加入反對黨、對新内閣今夜提出之信任動議、將一致投反對票、因此内閣在國會中地位、已不若前料之鞏固、但預料在四六四議席中、政府仍可得二五○至二七○票、</p>

<h3 id="c96">金錢理智與情感 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 無涯</p>
<p>神秘而活動的人生裏，我們時時可發現他矛盾而可笑的現象，這些現象的搆成，大概不外乎金錢，理智，情感三種原素的交錯支配。從這些原素裏，便引起悲歡離合的作用，演成層出不斷的活劇，整個的人生，因此賡續著虚僞的面具，而作沉寂的社會裏一些熱閙的點綴。</p>
<p>天一影片公司最近出品「最後之愛」，便攫住了這三種原素作全劇的靈魂。我們從第一點上領略·張守裕因爲資助了李耕莘去求學，便想把跛女作他的配偶，但是結果却成了泡影，這是金錢不能鞭策理智的一個明證。第二點·王竸芳本來和李耕莘本來是一對甜蜜的未婚夫婦，却無意中發現了他父親是個農人，便陡然掉頭不顧，另覓情侣，這又是金錢支配情感的一個明證。第三點·李耕莘明知侵佔公欵是犯法律的，但是因爲要拯拔梁小芬可憐的環境，便不期然而做了犯法舉動，結果是彌補無方，做了牢獄同志，這又是情感和金錢壓迫理智的明證。而最後一幕，又因梁小芬還了八百元贖身的欵項，使李耕莘疑慮消釋，言歸於好，更可證明金錢有恢復感情的力量。總之，這全劇的中心是人生的，所以我們瞧了便感到格外的親切，而他的組織，又是一個愛字的活動變化，我們更可明瞭親子間朋友間夫婦間一點眞誠。至於這部影片上聲白的清晰，佈景的幽美，在國産有聲電影中自可說得嘴響，人言在先，用不着我來喋喋了。</p>

<p>最後之愛爲天一最近有聲出品。邵醉翁君自任導演。將於今日在新光公映。試片時不佞亦曾往觀。感懷所及。謹述管見。該片劇情。新穎奇突。曲折多致。而處處適合人情。絶不荒誕怪謬。編劇者爲蘇怡及姚蘇鳳二氏。復經嚴獨鶴周瘦鵑等修正。名家手筆。的是不凡。</p>
<p>劇中楊耐梅飾女生王競芳。舉止浪漫。動作風流。表情刻劃入微。張振鐸飾大學生李耕莘。在片中歷盡喜樂哀愁。一張面孔。忽而肌肉鬆弛。忽而眉頭緊皺。忽而怒目裂眥。演來無不佳妙。宜景琳飾女伶梁小芬。一種纒綿悱惻。婉轉多情之致。殊是動人愛憐。其餘諸角。表演周到。堪稱厥職。魏鵬飛。馬東武。秦哈哈等。表演素有成績。惜乎所飾角色。不甚重要。吾人不能多所領略其藝術耳。</p>
<p>攝影配光。均稱佳妙。而發音之準確清晰。尤較「歌場春色」而過之。可謂得未曾有。</p>
<p>該片歌舞音樂。較「歌場春色」爲少。故劇情更爲緊凑。紫羅蘭唱「木蘭從軍。」載歌載舞。調頗新穎别致。陳玉梅與宣景琳合唱「五花洞。」極圓熟動聽。宣在「歌場春色」之中。末場所唱「棟花風」一闋。音韻凄楚。餘音繞樑。三日不絶。余曾爲之戚然感動。在「最後之愛」無此種類似情節。故不能再領略此種情調。於不佞個絶。余曾爲之戚然感動。在「最後之愛」無此種類似情節。故不能再領略此種情調。於不佞個人私衷。實感一種缺憾也。</p>

<p>現代女子。侈談戀愛。然不解戀愛眞諦。朝結合而夕仳離者。所在多有。至若一往情深。歷萬苦千辛。不渝初志者。吾得一人焉。曰梁筠珍。筠珍浙江紹興人。幼失恃。無兄弟姊妹。父爲名孝廉。顧才豐命嗇。侘傺不自聊。筠珍事父頗孝。肄業越州中學。每試輒列前茅。父恒語人曰。此吾家不櫛進士也。校中有男同學李耕莘者。少年英俊。品學冠儕輩。長於運動。尤擅足球。筠珍頗敬愛之。洎後耕莘畢業。赴滬入大學。筠珍家以鄰居失愼。燬於火。未幾。父又歾。筠珍孑然一身。丁此大故。徬徨乏策。其鄰劉錦培。老伶工也。貸筠珍金。俾葬其父。而以從之習戲爲交換條件。筠珍不得已。允焉。筠珍固敏慧。不久藝成。更名小芬。出演於滬上之春江大舞台。芳譽雀起。一日。忽有客造寓相訪。及出視。則中學時同學李耕莘也。蓋耕莘此時。已因故退學。在律師事務所任書記。偕友觀劇。無意中遇筠珍。故來訪也。次日。劉忽語筠珍。謂將應哈埠之聘。不日携之北上。筠珍大恐。自念弱質。不勝跋涉之苦。乃就商於耕莘。耕莘慨然允爲代償宿逋。俾復自由。顧耕莘境殊窘。計無所出。會有公欵二千金。乃私移八百金以付筠珍。詎知劉私與土豪蔣某約。以二千金鬻筠珍爲蔣妾。耕莘交欵後。劉蔣卽强筠珍以去。筠珍力拒無效。至蔣家後。監視甚嚴。一日。蔣飮大醉。筠珍得乘隙遁出。往訪耕莘。則耕莘以虧欵入獄。釋出後不知所之。筠珍茫無所歸。乃投工廠作二以自給。一日。忽一怪客排闥入。衣服襤褸。囚首垢面。遽怒斥筠珍。怪而詢之。其人蓋耕莘也。初，耕莘交筠珍欵後。次日往訪。則已室邇人遐。盡室他徙。而耕莘竟因此被囚。耕莘以被筠珍詐欺。致已身敗名裂。恨之刺骨。今得邂逅。乃尾隨之來。欲洩憤也。筠珍知耕莘誤會。乃詳述經過。並出枕中紙裏示耕莘。則前八百金宛然在。耕莘至是。始渙然氷釋。一雙患難情侣。遂賦同居。友人蘇怡君。將此事編成劇本。由天一影片公司攝成有聲電影。劇名「最後之愛。」於今日起。在上海新光。南京國民曁世界。蘇州東方。四家戲院同時公映云。</p>

<p>— 高季琳</p>
<p>第半章　最後之愛</p>
<p>愛神和財神打架，結果愛神往往是失敗的。李耕莘因爲家裏缺少「大拉司」，從前曾經說眞心愛他人格，愛他才幹的姑娘，終於輕輕他把地抛棄了。丨他失了戀。</p>
<p>失戀送給年青人的禮物是一擔煩悶，一擔懊惱·，自然李耕莘也收到了重重的一份。這一天，耕莘的朋友濟羣邀他去看戲，想用舞影歌聲消遣他的愁懷，台上的一個女伶梁小芬却引起了耕莘的注意·那女伶的面孔是怪熟的。誰呢？想，想，哦，想起來了·那不是他中學時代的女同學梁筠珍嗎？她怎麽上了舞台了？打聽打聽案目看，不曉得梁小芬住在那喪？案目的回答是·「民國路五十六號。」</p>
<p>第二天，耕莘和濟羣倆在民國路五十六號會見了梁小芬。</p>
<p>「密斯梁，你怎麽唱起戲來呢？」照例的寒暄以後，耕莘關切地詢問。</p>
<p>「唉，話長哪！…………」輕輕的一聲嘆氣，梁小芬訴說了她不幸的遭遇·家裏被火燒了。父親又死了，債台高築，無力償還，環境逼得她不能不度歌女的生涯了，丨這際遇使耕莘起了深切的同情。</p>
<p>星期日，耕莘坐在家裏，忽然梁小芬跑來找他。她見面的第一句話是·「我三天之内要跟著師父到哈爾濱去了。」</p>
<p>「哦，哈爾濱？遠得很呀！千里迢遥的跋涉，你受得了這個苦嗎？」</p>
<p>「我短我師父八百塊錢，没法想啊！耕莘，你能不能替我想個法子？感謝你！」</p>
<p>「好，讓我想想看！」耕莘被情感支配着答應了。</p>
<p>答應了，耕莘有八百塊錢嗎？他現在不過是一個律師公館的書記！他一身有的是熱血，感情·少的是「大拉司，」而替同學幫忙的責任却覺得不能不擔負。好！他終於擔負起來了·巧得很！律師剛好有二千塊錢呌他送到法院裏去，他就移挪了八百塊，立刻交給小芬，一面托濟羣趕緊設法借貸了來彌補。</p>
<p>但是，耕莘是上當了！隔了一天，他再去看梁小芬的時候，已是人去樓空，給了他一個意外的失望。回到寓裏，濟羣雖已替他借到了三百塊錢，可是，！不中用，！東窗事發，！兩位警察先生來把他請走了。丨結果？李耕莘侵佔公欵，徒刑三月。</p>
<p>「禍不單行，」古話說得不錯！現在，人間一切的不幸都落在李耕莘頭上了。爲了替同學幫忙，！挪用公欵，爲了挪用公欵，請他坐牢監。但是梁小芬感激他嗎？她是已經飄然遠去，杳如黄鶴。這還不夠，他的好友要到天津去了，臨去時又帶給他一個傷心的消息·「你爸爸因爲你入了獄，急得生病，一天沉重一天，現在不幸死了丨」</p>
<p>三個月鐵窗風味，耕莘受完了又出來。</p>
<p>一個英俊的青年，如今是落拓得篷頭垢面了。耕莘帶著一顆受傷的心，踽踽地在街頭躑躅。啊，不幸！在一個公園的面前，他遇見了遺棄他的情人，和一個西裝少年並著肩走。丨如今她又換了第三個情人了。摩登姑娘的要情人原像是穿皮鞋，穿厭了自然不妨換一雙，再換一雙。丨耕莘氣不過，預備上前敎訓她一番，但是警察先生來干涉了·「滾，流氓」</p>
<p>耕莘再頺喪地走去。他這時忽然感著肚子的空虚了，就到一家小飯店裏去吃飯。唉，冤家，梁小芬也給他碰到了！他氣得肚子幾乎脹破，一口氣追踪到她的家裏去。</p>
<p>「啍，騙人的賊！把我害到這個地步，現在可給我撞著了！…………」</p>
<p>「慢慢著，讓我告訴你，……」梁小芬鎭定地說，她又「如此如此」地告訴了她的經過。耕莘這纔爽然若釋，知道小芬實在没有負他。</p>
<p>他們熱烈地擁抱起來，一雙情人的影子併合在一起。</p>
<p>（上面是天一公司第二部聲片「最後之愛」的一段情節。詳細的，請你自已去看一「最後之愛」罷！）</p>

<p>明嘉靖中葉。倭宼蹂躪沿海各縣。警訊傳來。民衆驚駭。時無錫縣知事王其勤。精明幹練。爲上峯所器重。蒞任後見城垣破毁。即集欵修治之。工未及半。倭冦倐至。離城祇百餘里。王聞警。日夜督匠工作。命其子克保監工。克保見匠疲倦已極。惻然憫之。遽命少息。比倭冦近城。而東門之城垣未及修固。王即以克保誤工而斬之。軍民悚然。無敢存偷懶者。其時倭冦之旗幟。已隱約可見。王急極計生。乃用青布給雉堞而障護之。暗中仍督匠建築。以防萬一。惟倭冦之所以遲遲不至者。蓋亦有一原因在。倭酋捕鄉人何五路。迫之向導。何明知城垣未固。尚在修葺中。乃引倭冦從遠道曲折而行。以冀修城者之竣工。俾可禦敵。後爲倭酋所知。兄弟五人。同時殉難。迨倭冦攻城時。而城中早有所備。矢石交下。倭寇死者。逾千餘人。倭酋　集大隊來攻城陷而王其勤亦戰殁。死事之烈。足與張睢陽比美。朝命建專祠於錫邑。以旌其功。南水仙廟神。相傳即王其勤。邑人崇奉之。香火之盛垂三百年而不衰。今之守土者。讀此篇。得毋内疚於心乎</p>

<p>朔風如吼。六出紛飛。臘鼓聲動歲云暮矣。當此大地寂寞。花木凋殘。惟彼松竹梅。不與桃李爭春。獨凌沍寒以挺秀。孤芳自賞。衆醉獨醒。此人之所以嘆爲歲寒三友也。嗚呼。疾風知勁草。板蕩識患臣。歲寒見松竹梅。世亂自有英傑。吾於今日得新歲寒三友焉三友爲誰。東北三傑之馬韓梁也。馬占山絶塞孤軍。與賊兵奮鬥。於冰天雪地之中。以疲敝之師。當方張之冦。猶能疊獲勝利。雖以彈盡援絶。退守海倫。而仍整頓殘餘。待時以動。冦酋國賊。以利誘。以威脅。均能不爲所動。非若松竹梅之霜雪狂擊。而猶挺然獨秀乎。韓光第當中俄之役。以一旅之衆。駐扎蘭諾爾。戰强俄數倍之師。禦敵衛國。盡軍人守土之責。置生死於度外。其處境之艱苦。不讓於今日之馬將軍。卒之鞠躬盡瘁。死而後已。忠肝義胆。日月光華。人濁我清。非松竹之堅。寒梅之禀乎。梁忠甲在中俄之役。亦一旅長也。於危疑震撼之秋。率部進駐滿洲里。當强俄大軍中東路西來之衝。屢以少許之師。敗多許之冦。危城困守。匝月不挫。彈盡械竭。則徒手搏鬥。誓保國土。不惜一死。艱苦卓絶。韓梁同稱。厥後楚歌四面。路絶電斷。城中外領環請退走。以保民生。並保其生命。公知事不可爲。乃呼天者三。拔槍自殉。而日領眼銳。疾捉其腕。欲死不獲。公曰。斯時旣不我死。但世無降將軍也。我雖無能。我又誓必再殺十百人。力竭死於冦可耳。振臂一呼。從者數十。一馬當先。南間殺出。所之披靡。殲敵甚衆。卒之力盡。自刎。而已不及。爲敵俘虜。被解俄屬伯力囚焉。監視綦嚴。求死不獲。迨後戰止和議。公獲歸來。上官以其忠勇。仍使守滿。民聞之。郊迎者百千人。公益淬勵。圖湔前恥。不謂昊天不弔。猝死臥榻。環而泣者數千人。皆滿之男婦老幼也。醫騐爲心碎而死。嗚呼。公誠心碎而死也。第其心乃早碎於圍城之時。非歸來後之猝碎也。然則梁公之死。非若韓將軍之同爲殉國乎。世人僅知韓之大義殉難永思不已。於梁則淡忘之。余甚爲之抱憾也。之三人者。馬公禦日韓梁摧俄。卓然東北。鼎足而三。今日之軍人。惟知權利。惟知貪生。而公等反其道而行之。當其屈居東北。寂焉無聞。是不與桃李爭妍也。一旦外患迫來。挺身與爭。不屈不撓。凌寒見節義。謂非歲寒之松竹梅乎。吾故謂之新歲寒三友。</p>

<p>（一）英雄的難關</p>
<p>愁雲整堆地浮着。老天也悲傷到極點斷續地流下涙來。這時候。姊姊替我收拾行裝。媽媽正在掩着面啜泣。弟弟却不去上學。爹爹呢他也在晞嘘慨嘆。還有忠厚的娘姨。伊一面勸着媽媽不要傷心。一面仍用悲切温惋的語調呌我不要去。</p>
<p>呵。這個悽慘的環境。的確是悽慘了。但是。儘家中悽慘。我的决心却是無從轉移的了。</p>
<p>「不要哭了。媽。我們是中華民國的國民。國家有難。我們應該要盡點國民的義務。如果我們國民都不去救國。國亡了。我們便要做帝國主義者的奴隸了。」我說　　「是。說得也不差。可是中日如今正在向國聯談判。雙方都要遵守使形勢不致嚴重的諾言。你看。中央政府尚不調動軍隊。恐被日人藉口。你們去。豈不是破壞了政府的信用嗎。」</p>
<p>「况且。你們又没有武器。即使有。何嘗配得上日本十一。這也不去說它。但是。總要有了後盾才能夠前進的吧。」</p>
<p>「再者。此去黑龍江關山遥遠。你們到了北平。日軍却早已派兵截着前路了。怎麽去呢。就算去到。馬將軍也决不給你們上前線的。况關外嚴寒。手指算頭都會凍僵了的。你們在江南。果然不知厲害。」</p>
<p>親愛的爹爹。給了我這番敎訓。在我。惟有接受。祇是我的决心却是無從轉移的了。媽媽仍在啜泣。而且哭得更爲悲楚。於是我毅然决然地說。</p>
<p>「媽。不要哭了。請你當少生了我這一個吧。」</p>
<p>我這句話才說完。爹爹的眼圈漸漸紅了。媽媽竟大聲哭着。姊姊弟弟和娘姨也涙如雨下。</p>
<p>唉我自忖也說錯了。至今猶後悔莫及呢。</p>

<p>▲冰嬉</p>
<p>近年北都冬日盛行冰嬉。北海公園鋪銀百頃。尤適爲此。各大學男女學生。靚服詭裝。馳騁其間。視夏日舞塲尤爲闐塞。南方無此堅冰。故永不能見此盛會也。此風輸自歐西。然往時下級社會固已常爲之。長白敦崇燕京歲時記云。冰鞋以鐵爲之。中有單條。縛於鞵上。身起則行。不能暫止。技之巧者。如蜻蜓點水。紫燕穿波。内廷宴樂。亦陳此戲。冬季就土阜洒水。澆成冰山。高逾數丈。瑩滑異常。更使内監之健壯者。著帶毛豬皮履。自顚溜下。不得俯仰其軀。謂曰打滑溜。其能直下不仆者。爲上乘。日下舊聞考云。太液池冬月陳冰嬉。習勞行賞。以簡武事而修國俗。然則斯固滿洲舊俗矣。余意唐人潑寒胡之戲。必與此相近。蓋苦寒之國。游戲亦取諸本地風光也</p>
<p>燕京歲時記又云。冬至以後。水澤腹堅。則十刹海護城河二閘等處皆有冰床。一人拖之。其行甚速。長約五尺。寛約三尺。以木爲之。脚有鐵條。可坐三四人。雪晴日暖之際。如行玉壺中。王大臣之有恩命者。亦准於西苑門内乘坐拖床。床甚華美。上有宀如車篷。可避風雪。按倚晴閣雜鈔。明時積水灘常有好事者聯十餘床。携都籃酒具。我鋪氍毹其上。轟飮冰凌中以爲樂。誠豪俠之快事也。</p>
<p>蹂躪東省而大肆刦掠也。嗚呼。舊恨新愁。萃於一室。製作之精美。立意之深遠。足以發人猛省睹其狀。恍如親歷其境。實使人有無窮之感焉。沈君告余曰。吾輩但願此室早日撤除。而易爲戰利品之陳列室也。噫。吾不知國人有以副沈君之望乎</p>

<p>— 渭賓</p>
<p>「傀儡家庭」裏有一句名句。是娜拉說的。「爲着這個。不知有幾百萬女子做了犧牲」易卜生在描寫上。毫不客氣的把人類生活的矛盾暴露了。尤其是這一類名句。是值得當時斯干的那維亞各埠人士。充滿着這類不平鳴的宣言。在他們退出了劇塲之後。都爭相仿效着劇中人的口吻。表示熱烈的爭執和同情。</p>
<p>本來。同樣是父母遺傳下來的生動機能。不論男性和女性。應受同等的待遇。乃因感受着歷史的錯誤觀念。有了非人間性的不平衡的歧視。於是黑暗的社會裏又閙成多少使人悲憤不平的事故。如今我國的新法律已經把這一條女子經濟的綳帶解放了。「女子對於血親尊親的遺産有繼承權」這是新法律對於給予女子等權的一種明顯的提示。海上明星影片公司近攝「不幸生爲女兒身」一片。亦就根據這一點。給我被壓迫的婦女們作一聲不平鳴。劇中叙述方仁齋爲了他的侄子要覬觎財産。乃賄通産生婆將其妾所生的女兒。化作男裝。假充了丈夫子。以爲抵制族中人奪産地步。不料在十六年後。這一個秘密計畫。爲穩婆挾恨向族中人說破。族人遂訟於公庭。自以爲得計了。更不料此時法律解放女權。得有財産繼承權狡黠而輕視女性的族人。至此始面面相覬。大受打擊。此劇描寫女性待遇的矛盾點。純從惻面揭破出來。可爲數千年來畸形勢力下喘息的女子吐一口鬱勃之氣吾知此片受女界歡迎、觀衆贊美。其剌激的深刻。當不在斯干的那維半島之於易卜生之下。</p>

<p>第三章　虎口逃生</p>
<p>那兩個賊兵也有此意。一齊說好。於是把槍柄向廟門上敲。早把廟門打開。一個賊兵忙將忠淑從馬上拖下。䭾在身上。向廟裏便走。那兩個賊兵照着電筒。一齊跟着走進。早到得大殿上。此時忠淑身子雖不能動。心裏却十分明白。知這賊兵即將强姦伊了。那麽伊將如何對付呢。自已手裏盒子砲已被他們奪去。宛如小雞遇見了黄狼。無能爲力。所以當那賊兵將伊放倒在蒲團上的時候。伊心中一陣悲憤。暈了過去。忽然耳畔聽得槍聲一響。驚醒了伊的悠悠三魂。睜眸一看。見身旁兩個賊兵正和一條黑影往來刺擊。不多時祗見劍光一閃。一個賊兵倒了下去。那一個賊兵向外一躥。方逃至殿外。槍聲又是一響。那賊兵也倒下地去。伊心上正怙惙着。祗見電筒一亮。方瞧得清楚那立在伊身旁的黑影正是華乃强。不由驚喜參半。原來華乃强在林子裏出恭之時。忽聞槍聲。嚇得他没有了事。急急栓上褲兒。掩出林來。瞧見三個太陽兵夾着馬蹄聲響。已向前邊走去。他掩上前四下一看。祗見一匹死馬。那忠淑的倩影已不知何往。大概已被太陽兵擒去了。那麽自已一定要救伊出險。不忍獨生。於是輕輕地追隨着他們而行。想要覷個間隙。好動手援救。後來見太陽兵擁着忠淑入廟。料想他們或要幹那禽獸行爲。他遂鼓着勇氣。緊握手槍。輕輕掩入廟中。來到殿前。幸在黑暗裏。賊兵没有覺察。方在下手擺佈忠淑的當兒。危險當前。間不容髮。他遂突躍而出。手起一槍。擊倒了首先的一個。跟着跳進殿中。那兩個賊兵的槍械已放在一邊。一時措手不及。拔了身上刺刀。向他猛撲。華乃强施展神勇。竟把那兩個賊兵一齊了結。還劍入鞘。拾起一個電筒來看忠淑。大家說一聲好險啊。忠淑喜道。我若没有你來救時。不堪設想。但是你怎會前來救我的呢。華乃强又取過忠淑的盒子砲。遞給伊的手裏說道。事機緊急。我們快走。以後再談罷。忠淑遂立起身來。隨着他一齊走出廟門。恰好兩匹馬立在那裏嚙蹄。二人一聳身跨上馬鞍。加上數鞭。潑刺刺的衝過鐵路。向前疾馳而去。</p>

<p>— 琢琳</p>
<p>徐敎官「一二」「一二」宏大的喊聲中、我們出發去演習野操了、一路上整齊的步伐聲、時常驚呆了路上的行人向我們看、受了×大學門口站崗的敬禮以後不多久、就到了我們要到的地方、</p>
<p>那邊、一旁靠着鐵道、一旁有一條小河平行着鐵道、兩面是像隔河一樣的田、我們是列成雙行沿着鐵道旁邊條小路走來的、靠這塊地的旁豎着一塊石牌告訴我們說這里「××義塚」、零零落落的也有幾顆樹、三三四四的也有幾具没有埋的小棺材、</p>
<p>「今天」、立在一個高塜上的王敎官說、「我們要在這兒演野操、這兒是一個義塜、但是大家不要怕、因爲戰塲上、總是有死人的、並且、赫裸裸地就躺在地上連棺材都没有的、雖然有紅十字會救護員時常去把牠搬去、但是在火線内要他們不敢去搬的、所以我們預備要上戰塲的話、死人無論如何不能怕的、並且、死人是死的、我們是活的、活的去怕死的、可不是一件笑話嗎、</p>
<p>「大家想一想、我爲甚魔要嚕嚕囌囌的說這麽些話、因爲我們進來的時候、我看見有幾個人在向旁邊的人伸舌頭、或者兩個人互相伸着舌頭、也有幾個人蹙着眉頭、我們要知道、做了軍人、這種態度、是不行的、等一會我們要演操的是散兵線進的伏下、不要大家有畏畏縮縮的樣子、」</p>
<p>我們分成了兩組、我們一組是徐敎官指揮的、</p>
<p>「　囗……」一個急長的哨聲、我們一起伏下了、我伏到的地方、是一個較大的新塜的脚下、很辛運的、旣没有大長而硬的茅草、又没有水潭、我向左看、小王、一顆很茂大的茅草、怡好在他的面前、黑「好一個躱避物」、我輕輕地向他說、「……」他回了我一個苦笑、</p>
<p>我再看過去、就看到最不幸的阿牛、在他右旁、一個亮晶晶的水潭、在他脚後一具簇新的小棺材、當我向他注意的時候、恰巧他也回過頭來向我這邊看、他苦着臉、向我做了他最喜歡做的動作丨一閉了眼睛伸舌頭、</p>
<p>當我們帶了滿身的泥積回校去的時候、我們更挺了胸、更加重了步伐聲、在校門口到操塲上的一路上、今天不出操的同學們向我們身上的泥積摇帽、</p>

When asked if they were not afraid of their families' condemnation, they replied that comforting the soldiers was a common desire, and they would not regret even being condemned. I took out twenty yuan to reward them, but they only accepted it after I insisted. Who knew that when the troops were stationed in Hetao, these three students carried meat again, saying that they dared not accept the reward, but specially used it to buy meat, hoping that the general would eat his fill and kill the enemy.

<h3 id="e18">The Kuomintang and the People in Critical Times <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Since the confrontation between Nanjing and Guangdong took shape, political turmoil has lasted for half a year. The Guangdong side insisted on unifying the political situation, and took Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's resignation as a prerequisite. Representatives traveled back and forth, and held consultations at the peace conference. Time passed, and unification was still difficult to achieve in reality. The strong enemy was pressing from the outside, and famine was causing internal disturbances. The national pulse and the people's lives were becoming increasingly precarious. Until now, Mr. Chiang resolutely resigned. The chaotic situation that had lasted for half a year suddenly took a sharp turn for the better, and a ray of sunshine emerged.</p>
<p>However, judging from the current situation, can we really be happy and think that politics can be clarified from now on, and that the situation of unification can last for a long time? Can even the general political leaders regard today's gains as a victory of their propositions, and be complacent about it? We believe that the period of transition and change between the old and the new due to Mr. Chiang's resignation is the most critical and urgent. From now on, the people of the country and the ruling Kuomintang should work hard to reform the national policy with the spirit of new life.</p>
<p>The revolution has lasted for five years. In terms of time, it cannot be said to be short. At the beginning of the revolution, the people were not happy to celebrate, hoping that our country and our nation would have a chance to revive in the future. However, after five years of hardship, the people's lives have been ruined. Until now, a stronger enemy is invading from the outside, the mountains and rivers are broken, and the floods are forcing the people to have nowhere to die. Before and after the revolution, the people are almost moved to feel unbearable to look back. Who did it? Who caused it? This is the responsibility that the ruling party and the people of the country cannot shirk.</p>
<p>We believe that the ability of a political party in a country to exist and win the support of the people lies not only in having a doctrine, a party platform, and policies, but also in the ability to earnestly implement and fulfill the doctrine, policies, and party platform. Today's ruling Kuomintang does have its own doctrines, policies, and party platforms. However, how many have been realized in the past five years? How many have been implemented? Even if it can be earnestly implemented and its realization can be promoted, whether it can meet the needs of the country and the people is still a problem. What's more, the doctrine becomes a mere formality, and the policy becomes a cliche. Countless disputes are caused only by comrades with the same beliefs. How can this settle the national policy? How can this stabilize people's hearts? How can this not lead to internal chaos and foreign aggression? In the past five years, the people have given the Kuomintang ample opportunity to govern, and endured all kinds of suffering. Day after day, the ruling party has failed to satisfy the people's wishes. At present, the national pulse is hanging by a thread. The ruling party cannot shirk this responsibility. Therefore, the sudden turn of the political situation today is an opportunity for the Kuomintang to redeem itself and renew itself. According to the current leaders of the party and government, they also believe that going to Nanjing is to reorganize the central government affairs. We deeply hope that these two words, "reorganization," can be sincerely and practically fulfilled. It is unbearable to have three folds in a watermelon vine. Today is the last chance. If the Kuomintang still cannot implement its doctrines and policies in the future, and the general leaders are still engaged in disputes over political views or rights, then the people's will is fickle, and in the end of despair, who can guarantee that a sudden change will not be caused in politics? This is what the ruling party today should recognize and realize.</p>
<p>As for our people, they cannot say that they do not bear any responsibility for the creation of this difficult situation. The country is based on the people as the main body. The people should always bear the responsibility of supervising politics. Only when there are responsible people can there be a responsible government, and then there can be clear politics. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "Politics is the affair of the people. Governance is management." Then the affairs of the people should be managed by the people together. Although the government has obtained special administrative privileges through the authorization of the people, the people are not allowed to rely on others to live and not to ask about politics at all. This theory has now been understood by all. It is just knowing but not doing, abandoning responsibility and not taking responsibility. Therefore, it has led to the current political chaos, and also led to the current national difficulties. From now on, if we want to break the national crisis and save the critical situation, to renew our country and save our nation, then the people of the country should earnestly take up the responsibility of supervising the government, so that the government becomes the government of the people, and politics becomes the politics of the people, and then there will be success. This time of political transformation is also the only opportunity for our people to strive for self-salvation and to save the country.</p>
<p>The old is replaced by the new, and the era is transformed. We should be mindful of the mistakes of the past, and everything should be changed and started anew. We would like to further elaborate on our views on the gains and losses of past politics in the next few days, in order to contribute our humble opinions.</p>

Then, acting President of the Executive Yuan Chen said that he was elected by the leaders of the party and the country this time, and he should try his best to obey the order. At the same time, he was moved by Mr. Chiang's great spirit, and he did not care about the advantages and disadvantages of reputation, so he came forward to temporarily maintain the situation. In the future, all matters will be conducted in accordance with the party's intentions and efforts. He hopes that everyone will understand this point and give advice at any time. When talking about the separation of military and civilian affairs, it has always been his proposition, and now it is only for emergency,勉承其乏(reluctantly accepting the burden), and he will still fulfill his original wish in the future. Then, President Yu said briefly that correcting the chaos and returning to the right path is everyone's job.

The resignations of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman, Dai Chuanxian, Chairman of the Special Foreign Affairs Committee, and Song Ziwen, Deputy Chairman, were resolved to be persuaded to stay. (16th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian resigned as Chairman of the Special Foreign Affairs Committee, and the Central Political Council has resolved to persuade him to stay. His resignation petition is as follows: "Respectfully presented, since the Japanese invasion of our Eastern Provinces case occurred, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has left his post, the national crisis is critical, and no one is responsible. The Political Council has specially elected comrades to organize the Special Foreign Affairs Committee, and appointed Chuanxian and Ziwen to serve as the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Special Foreign Affairs Committee. Since taking office, I have been working day and night, working together with all comrades in harmony, adhering to the central policy, and strictly following the Prime Minister's doctrine, doing my best to serve the country loyally and overcome national difficulties. Fortunately, with the spirit of the Prime Minister in heaven and the guidance of the central government, in recent decades, world opinion has gradually gathered sympathy for our country, and international justice has gradually become apparent. Now the third resolution of the League of Nations has been established, and the diplomatic aspect has come to an end. However, foreign affairs require the people of the country to be of one mind and one heart. In order to obtain the unanimous efforts of the whole country to deal with foreign countries, we can only ask the central government to quickly appoint capable people to take responsibility for guiding diplomacy. Chuanxian and others have thin virtue and fresh ability, and can no longer make powerless support, in order to cause worry to the party and the country and further lose credibility with foreign countries. As for all the hosting guidelines of this Foreign Affairs Committee, they have been detailed on the 28th of last month and will not be presented again. (16th special dispatch)</p>

<p>Draft Bill for Troop Increase Submitted to Cabinet Yesterday</p>
<p>Arita Returns Home via Siberia</p>
<p>Elder Saionji's Condition is Precarious</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 16th, Jiji Press: The Inukai Cabinet's policy towards Manchuria has been decided to implement the Tanaka Cabinet's established policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia. However, after the Inukai Cabinet was established, there were many domestic problems and it was inconvenient to discuss the policy towards Manchuria. Now, the ban on gold exports has been decisively implemented, and the selection of the Parliamentary Undersecretary has also been decided. It is planned to discuss the attitude towards Manchuria for the first time at the Cabinet meeting on the 16th, and because some cabinet members advocate announcing the current cabinet's policy towards Manchuria to the people as an emergency measure, a statement on the Manchurian and Mongolian issues will be issued within days.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 16th, Den-En: The Japanese government, because the Chinese army in Jinzhou has not yet withdrawn from the Guannei, will carry out a thorough attack on Jinzhou and invade Guannei. A draft bill for troop increase will be submitted to the Cabinet meeting this afternoon as preparation for attacking Jinzhou. It is heard that Minister of War Araki will dispatch a mixed brigade of the XX Division and two infantry brigades of the XX Division to Jinzhou.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 16th, Reuters: Reuters has learned that the plan to send another one and a half divisions of Japanese troops to Manchuria because Zhang Xueliang will withdraw the Jinzhou army into Guannei has been cancelled. However, the Cabinet will meet this afternoon to discuss sending a mixed brigade to the Kwantung Leased Territory. It is heard that because the soldiers have been serving for a long time in the cold north and need to rest, it is intended to send more troops to replace them. If this proposal is approved, one or two battalions from this mixed brigade will be dispatched to Tianjin to prevent disturbances caused by the uncertain political and military situation in North China after Chiang Kai-shek resigns.</p>
<p>▲ Paris, 16th, Reuters: Arita, the Japanese Ambassador to France, has now accepted the post of Foreign Minister of the new cabinet and is scheduled to leave with his family on Friday via Siberia to return home and assume his new post. The French press has given many positive reviews of Arita's appointment as Foreign Minister. Le Temps of Paris pointed out that Arita is a diplomat with the most sound ideas regarding the handling of the Sino-Japanese relations by the League of Nations, and has demonstrated a great spirit of moderation in the extremely difficult negotiations in the League of Nations Administrative Council on the Manchurian dispute. Observers of Far Eastern politics expect that there will be little change in Japan's foreign policy when Arita takes office.</p>
<p>▲ Okitsu, 16th, Dentsu: Elder Saionji was summoned to Tokyo for the issue of a successor cabinet. After the cabinet was decided, he returned to his Zagyosho residence in Okitsu on the 13th. Unexpectedly, he suddenly contracted a cold and his condition is quite serious. Dr. Katsuji is currently making every effort to diagnose and treat him, but it is feared that he is old and weak, and the outlook is not optimistic.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 16th, Jiji: The emergency imperial edict bill on the suspension of cash payment for banknotes has been approved in its original form by the Privy Council Review Committee on the 16th. After it is approved at the Provisional Privy Council meeting on the 17th, it will be submitted to the Emperor for consultation and is planned to be promulgated immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 16th, Reuters: The Privy Council met this afternoon to discuss the issue of suspending cash payments for banknotes, asking about the necessity of issuing an immediate edict. Finance Minister Takahashi requested that this measure was necessary to save the public from disaster, and that the urgency of the matter did not allow for approval by the parliament. He also asked why this measure was not necessary when the gold embargo was implemented in 1927. Takahashi replied that at that time, the central bank had a cash reserve worth 110 million yuan, while now it is only worth 50 million yuan. Takahashi also said that although the gold embargo had increased prices, it had boosted domestic industry and export trade, thereby reducing unemployed workers and restoring markets that Japan had lost.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 16th, Jiji: The current number of Minseito [Democratic Party] members in the House of Representatives is an absolute majority of 250, while the Seiyukai [Friends of Constitutional Government] has only 170 members. How the Inukai cabinet, with this minority party, will deal with the upcoming parliament is attracting attention from all sides. The government intends to dissolve parliament and hold a general election again in accordance with constitutional conventions. However, the Seiyukai does not merely hope for the dissolution of parliament. The government party plans to start negotiations with the Minseito before parliament reopens to discuss a compromise. If the Minseito accepts this proposal and hopes for a satisfactory compromise, then parliament need not be dissolved. Otherwise, if the Minseito refuses to negotiate, parliament will be decisively dissolved and a general election will be held. It is impossible to predict what attitude the Minseito will take towards this kind of negotiation by the government party. Whether parliament is dissolved or not depends entirely on the attitude of the Minseito.</p>

<p>Capitalism Changes to a New Face</p>
<p>Aggression Against China Will Intensify</p>
<p>▲ Moscow, 15th, Kuomin: Izvestia, the semi-official organ of the Soviet Russian government, commented on the change of the Japanese cabinet, predicting that Japanese capitalism and imperialism will become even more intensified in the future. It said that the Minseito and the Seiyukai are both capitalist parties, and the only difference is that the Seiyukai is closer to large industrialists and large landowners. Therefore, the change of the two parties will not make any difference in practice. It is predicted that in the future, Japan will be more active and more aggressive in the three northeastern provinces and throughout China and the Far East. The new government will adopt policies to subsidize industries and increase currency, as Japanese capitalists hope to use this method to save the economy from disaster and increase wealth. In the future, they will try their best to expand exports, but the result will be to further lower the living standards of Japanese workers, further increase public dissatisfaction, and further promote the revolutionary crisis.</p>

<p>▲ Oslo, 15th, Reuters: Norway, Sweden, and Denmark have all followed Britain and suspended the gold standard. Perhaps because of this, two major Norwegian banks suspended cash payments yesterday and have applied for permission to suspend payments for three months in accordance with Norwegian banking law. (Reuters note: The Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai said that he had received information from Oslo that the suspension of cash payments by the two banks for three months was not due to the weakness of their financial position, but because it was necessary to prevent continued withdrawals while they were reorganizing their future business policies. The difficulties encountered by these two banks are due to international financial tensions. Norwegians are very calm about this, and the financial community is confident in the soundness of the Norwegian banking system. Therefore, the exchange rate between Norway and New York has not been adversely affected since the news of the suspension of payments by the two banks was announced.)</p>

The Indian press is afraid of offending those involved and does not dare to endorse assassinations, but there are also no extremely critical words. The recent assassination case of the British judge in Bengal is the only precedent in the history of political assassinations in India, because it is the first time that an Indian woman has committed a political crime. Before this, Indian women were only assistants to revolutionaries. Since 1928, a total of twelve military officers have been assassinated, and there have been no less than twenty unsuccessful murder attempts. All of these cases fall within the scope of political terrorism.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Li Zongren Reports on the Situation of the Vietnamese-Guangxi Border Guards <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲Rumors of Troop Deployment in Guangdong and Guangxi to Defend the Border</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, the Guangzhou National Government, based on reports from Li Zongren and others in Guangxi Province, stated that Zongren had previously repeatedly reported to Wei Yunsong, the superintendent of defense against Vietnam in Longzhou, on the French government's military preparations in Annam. These reports were promptly submitted. Now, it is believed that the actions of the Vietnamese government in the past two months have affected our southwestern border defense and infringed upon our sovereignty. The facts are listed below: (1) On the 1st and 2nd of the previous month, two French aircraft entered our airspace and reconnoitered the situation in Longzhou. After our protest, the Vietnamese pilots apologized and the matter was dropped. (2) After the Shenyang Incident, the Hanoi newspapers' tone favored Japan, claiming that Japan's protection of Western culture and treaty interests could serve as a model for Europe. (3) The telegram of the previous month stated that France had completed the construction of an airfield in Liangshan, and troops had been increased in all border areas. (4) The telegram of the month before last stated that in addition to recruiting new soldiers, the Vietnamese government was also calling up veterans who had retired more than twenty years ago for training in Hanoi for a period of five months, preparing to deploy them to various locations. (5) Roads within Vietnam are being extended to our border crossings at Ping而 and Shuikou, and their width is being expanded. A barracks for one division of troops has also been built in Liangshan. (6) Vietnam has banned food exports this year and abolished the French silver dollar, hoping to absorb cash. (7) On the [missing]th day of the previous month, seventy to eighty French soldiers crossed the border without reason and attacked farmers in Gaoban Village, wantonly looting. The previous month, they also entered our shops. This is the most serious incident of provocation against us, and a telegram has been sent to the minister requesting negotiations and protests. It is reported that French soldiers have also entered Yunnan Province to harass. (8) Yesterday's telegram stated that France transported cannons, rifles, ammunition, and 20,000 sets of military uniforms to Liangshan, reportedly for distribution to the militia (i.e., veterans). All of the above are facts. The act of crossing the border to attack and loot our country's villages is particularly provocative. Zongren, observing the national situation and concerned about border defense, urgently presented this intelligence and information on France's actions that harm our sovereignty, so that the government could discuss how to respond and make plans to consolidate the southwest and strengthen national defense. He earnestly prayed for this." After receiving this report, Chen Jitang, the Guangdong military authority, accompanied by army commanders Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, and Li Yangjing, visited Li Zongren at his private residence in Shuangpenggang, Dongshan, at 8:00 a.m. on the 10th to discuss major plans for the southwestern border. Bai Chongxi and Zhang Fakui were also present. After a long discussion, Chen and the others bid farewell. It is reported that Guangxi Province has already made arrangements for the Guangxi border defense, and plans to transfer the troops of Zhang Fakui and Li Pinxian to reinforce Longzhou. The authorities in Guangdong Province also intend to transfer troops to Qinzhou and Fangcheng in the southern part of Guangdong Province, which border Vietnam. It is widely rumored that Yu Hanmou's First Army will be transferred to the Fangcheng area to garrison, and if necessary, Xiang Hanping's Second Army will also be ordered to go. However, based on the facts, the Vietnamese border has not yet reached a critical stage. Therefore, it is not yet possible to predict whether the rumored troop deployments in Guangdong and Guangxi will materialize. (December 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Taiyuan Students Petition Against Japan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲Demolish the Provincial Government Education Bureau and the Minguo Daily</p>
<p>▲Student Union Demands the Dismissal of Miao Peicheng</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Students from various schools in the city, in order to urge the authorities to actively resist Japan, sent 53 representatives elected by the Provincial Student Union to the Provincial Government to petition and put forward five demands: (1) Please allow them to go to Beijing to petition; (2) Please ask the Provincial Government to extend the winter vacation in order to widely publicize and awaken the people; (3) Please issue a circular to various places in Shanxi to protect the youth patriotic movement; (4) Please ask the Provincial Government to allocate rifles, bullets, and uniforms for the volunteer army; (5) Please ask the Provincial Government to issue a circular to the county governments in this province to subsidize the anti-Japanese national salvation association expenses of students in public and private schools. First, the Director of Education Miao Peicheng received them, followed by Chairman Tian and Xu Yongchang who gave instructions, dissuading them in various ways. The representatives, believing that their goals had not been achieved, gathered about a thousand students from various schools again yesterday (1st) morning to petition the Provincial Government. At about 10 a.m., they gathered at the Provincial Government. Upon receiving the news, the Provincial Government immediately ordered the guards to close the gate tightly. At that time, there was a strong wind blowing, sand and dust swept their faces, and the cold air was biting. The students did not flinch. Arriving at the Provincial Government, they could not enter and demolished the gate, surging in. Reaching the front of the building, the Director of Public Security Wang Xifu came out to meet them first. The students believed that the matter was of great importance and that Chairman Xu must personally receive them before they would express their opinions. At that time, Xu and others were holding a meeting in the Provincial Government. The students waited for a long time, but no one received them, so they went straight to the Provincial Government conference room. The Provincial Committee and others, seeing that the situation was not good, planned to adjourn the meeting, but in a hurry, they did not even put on their clothes and hats properly. The Director of Construction Tian Jianlong slightly injured his leg because he was walking in a hurry. The remaining committee members all scattered. For a time, the Provincial Government Chairman's office, the Director's office, the Adjutant's office, the Third Section, the Conference Room, the Secretariat, the Provincial Government Office, and the Opium Prohibition Examination Office were filled with flying documents, shattered glass, and dilapidated doors, windows, and tables. After finishing with the Provincial Government, they divided into two teams, one going to the Education Bureau and the other to the Minguo Daily. The Education Bureau was originally divided into one, two, and three courtyards. The Director's office, the Secretary's office, and the Secretary-General's office in the east side courtyard heard that the western stove in the Secretary-General's office had overturned and the files had also been burned. The keys to the accounting office were placed on the ground and the safes were still locked as before. In total, the Education Bureau's losses, except for the Inspector's Office which was not damaged, all official documents were overturned and soaked in water. The employees of the Minguo Daily fled upon hearing the news. All the rooms, windows, and utensils in the newspaper office, regardless of value or size, were completely destroyed. In addition, they also went to the residence of Han Kewen in front of Cangmen and the residence of Chairman Xu on Dongbian Street. Han was not at home. Only an old nanny and a servant were left in the residence. The clothes in the room were all broken. Because the Xu residence had stationed about forty or fifty security guards at various street entrances in advance to block them, they were unable to enter. Until after 3 p.m., the teachers and students of the National Teachers' College went to the Provincial Government to petition again. The garrison commander Rong Honglu received them. Rong gave the students a very sincere speech and agreed to convene a meeting with the student representatives at the alumni association of the Fourth Army School at 9 a.m. tomorrow to find a solution. It is reported that after the National Teachers' College students petitioned, the school gate was tightly closed and they were not allowed to freely enter or leave. There are also problems within the school itself. There is a rumor that the principal and the director of education will be expelled.</p>
<p>At 6 p.m. yesterday, the anti-Japanese associations of various schools held a joint emergency meeting in the Confucius Temple. More than 20 secondary schools attended. After the chairman reported on the significance of the gathering, they discussed the proposals and resolved: (1) To submit a request to the government to dismiss the Director of Education Miao Peicheng and issue a declaration; (2) To send representatives to the Provincial Government to apologize with a letter; (3) To send representatives to persuade the representatives who petitioned the Provincial Government to return to school; (4) To send a letter to the General Student Union requesting that each school be allowed to freely organize petitions; (5) To continue to assist the representatives in realizing the five demands; (6) To post slogans and expand publicity; (7) To send a telegram to the whole country to publicize the truth about the anti-Japanese petition; (8) Students from all schools will continue to suspend classes on the 12th. The letter from the All-Shanxi Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to Chairman Xu is as follows: "We respectfully submit that the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent and the danger of national subjugation is worrying. This time, the students endured pain and sacrificed in order to petition. The original intention was to awaken the people of the country from their dreams and promote the success of diplomacy. However, due to the government's explicit orders, we were unable to achieve our goals. Your Excellency Chairman spoke with sincerity and shed tears. The students listened attentively to your earnest admonitions and are truly grateful. However, the Director of Education Miao Peicheng did not understand our bitter intentions and wantonly scolded us, trying to use high-handed methods to stop the patriotic movement. Judging from his intentions, he only knows how to flatter and fawn, acting as a running dog for a dictator. As for the national crisis and the extermination of the race, he has long abandoned them. If this person is not removed, he will not only be unable to lead Shanxi's education, but also may turn into a traitor. In anger, the students had no choice but to use force to eliminate this scum. During the petition, because the representatives were separated inside the government and the comfort team was separated outside the government, the situation was separated. Because of the severe weather, everyone thought that Miao was in charge of the situation, and they suspected that Miao must also be living in the government at this time, which led to a misunderstanding and the destruction of the doors and windows of the Provincial Government. After the matter was clarified, we regretted it very much. We can only express our apology to Your Excellency Chairman with twelve thousand points of sincerity. We earnestly hope that you will understand the national crisis and forgive the students' righteous anger. We pray without end."</p>
<p>After the students from various schools destroyed the various agencies yesterday, they returned to school separately at about 4 p.m. The authorities sent out military police to maintain order, and the situation suddenly became tense. It is reported that the Director of Construction Tian Jianlong has been hospitalized in the Jesus Hospital for recuperation after injuring his leg. (December 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e68">The Details of the Anomaly in the Northeastern Navy in Qingdao <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: A week ago, Shen Honglie, the commander of the Northeastern Navy stationed in Qingdao, simultaneously replaced the captains of the Haiqi, Haishen, and Zhaochao ships. Although Qingdao newspapers reported this, they did not provide detailed information. Therefore, few people know the inside story. Fortunately, the matter has been resolved quickly, and local security has not been affected. Therefore, I am following up and recording the process as follows:</p>
<p>In recent months, representatives from a certain party have frequently traveled to and from Qingdao, their movements particularly secretive. Their purpose was to instigate the Northeastern ships. Commander Ling Xiao of the Second Fleet and the captains of the Haiqi, Haishen, and Zhaochao ships had all been instigated and compromised. The first step of their plan was to monitor Commander Shen Honglie, then kidnap a certain mayor and a certain chairman, extort a large sum of money, and then set sail south. They had also obtained the consent of the Japanese side in advance. The Japanese were waiting for the ships to mutiny, at which point their stationed troops and marines in Qingdao would land, reoccupy Qingdao, and establish a puppet local maintenance association. Zhao Qi, the former director of the Qingdao Commercial Bureau during the Zhang Zongchang era, would serve as the chairman of the maintenance association. Zhao Qi had also arrived in Qingdao secretly a week ago to make arrangements. Shen Honglie initially knew nothing about this. One day, Shen, Ling Xiao, and the captains of the ships went to the Xiàqīnggōng Taoist temple in Laoshan Bay to discuss Qingdao's coastal defense measures. During the meeting, on command, Shen Honglie was suddenly captured. That evening, Ling Xiao telegraphed a certain important person in Beiping, claiming that Commander Shen had suddenly developed a mental illness and asked someone to act as his proxy. The important person replied in a telegram, approving the proxy. Then, he telegraphed again, saying that Shen was in critical condition, and finally telegraphed that Shen had passed away. It is said that the important person was quite suspicious when he received the second telegram, because if Shen was in critical condition, why was Ling Xiao the only one sending telegrams? Moreover, Shen was usually strong, and it was too sudden for him to be in critical condition. He immediately telegraphed a certain mayor in Qingdao to inquire. After receiving the telegram, the mayor was very surprised and immediately telephoned the naval headquarters to ask if Commander Shen was ill. At that time, there was only one adjutant in the headquarters, who replied that there was no such thing. He further telephoned the Xiàqīnggōng Taoist temple in Laoshan, but the phone was no longer working. At this time, Qingdao City knew that an incident had occurred and planned a rescue method. The adjutant of the naval headquarters summoned two small boats berthed in Qingdao and more than a hundred soldiers, informing them that Commander Shen was in danger. The soldiers were very sad and indignant upon hearing the news, and each was willing to risk their lives to rescue Shen. So, the entire body of soldiers armed themselves and traveled to Laoshan Bay by sea in two small boats. When they arrived, the Haiqi, Haishen, and Zhaochao ships had just set sail and returned to Qingdao. These hundred-plus soldiers immediately went to the Xiàqīnggōng Taoist temple. At this time, Ling Xiao had sent dozens of soldiers to monitor Shen Honglie there. The hundred-plus soldiers rushed in together, completely seizing the weapons of those monitoring Shen Honglie. Shen immediately regained his freedom and led the troops back to Qingdao by land. When he arrived, the captains of the ships were still disembarking. Shen immediately sent people to prepare. When Ling Xiao and the captains landed, they were immediately arrested one by one. At that time, someone advised Shen to execute the conspirators by shooting, but Shen did not allow it. He immediately sent people to replace the positions of the captains, and the disturbance was quelled.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Wuhu Students Hold Large Anti-Japanese Parade <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Wuhu Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of Students, Teachers, and Staff of All Levels of Male and Female Schools believes that the government's diplomacy with Japan has failed repeatedly, and various places in the eastern provinces are still occupied by the violent Japanese. The so-called legitimate self-defense and the use of force to recover lost territories are merely empty words. Therefore, at 9 a.m. today, a joint general meeting of all students was convened and a general anti-Japanese demonstration parade was held. The military and police authorities, having received the news in advance, dispatched a large number of troops and police to patrol the streets and various important locations in full armor early this morning. Because the Japanese Consulate is on the south bank, the soldiers were particularly densely stationed, and the Japanese Consulate was heavily guarded. Plainclothes detectives were even more active in the meeting venue and the parade. At the appointed time, students from various schools, holding banners and flags, successively lined up and gathered in the public gymnasium. More than 10,000 middle and primary school students, both male and female, attended. Before the meeting began, Brigade Commander Wang Leshan arrived at the venue and gave a speech, saying that he was also a student and expressed his sympathy for the patriotic movement of the students. However, at this time of激愤, he especially hoped that they would adopt a calm attitude so as not to give others an excuse and affect public safety, and so on. Then, Chairman Yang Guohua announced the opening of the meeting. Representatives from various schools gave sorrowful speeches, and the atmosphere in the venue was unusually tense. The parade set off at 12:00 noon, passing through Er Street, Dama Road, and Chang Street from the Jiangkou. It was originally planned to cross the river via the Lishui Bridge and detour to the Japanese Consulate. However, because the area was full of soldiers and police, and the bridge had been removed to prevent them from going, the main force went directly up and crossed the river via the pontoon bridge. Along the way, they shouted slogans such as "Withdraw from the League of Nations, use force to recover lost territories, vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy, overthrow traitors, support Ma Zhanshan who is loyal to the country, and oppose the suppression of the people's movement." They dispersed at 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: At the 49th State Council meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 15th, it was resolved to reorganize the Zhejiang Provincial Government, appointing Lu Dipin, Lü Bichou, Zhou Junyan, Chen Bulei, Zeng Yangfu, Jiang Bocheng, Jiang Xihou, Wang Chengying, and Yang Mianzhong as members of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and designating Lu Dipin as the chairman, Lü Bichou concurrently as the Director of Civil Affairs, Zhou Junyan concurrently as the Director of Finance, Chen Bulei concurrently as the Director of Education, and Zeng Yangfu concurrently as the Director of Construction. Lu Dipin immediately telegraphed He Dian, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Capital, at noon today (the 16th), saying that he was scheduled to come to Hangzhou tonight and requested that a team be sent to the station to protect him, and so on. After receiving the telegram, He immediately ordered his subordinates to prepare a welcome and took the telegram to Zhang Nanxian. Zhang then instructed the various departments to expedite the handover. All urgent official business was to be completed immediately, and ordinary documents were not to be submitted for review. He also sent Secretary Chen Xianghui to Shanghai to welcome him. It is reported that Lu Dipin has arranged to travel with Lü Bichou, Chen Bulei, Jiang Bocheng, Zhou Junyan, Zeng Yangfu, and others, and will bring an escort team of 400 people, taking the night train to Hangzhou tonight (the 16th). He will take office tomorrow, but because the time is too short to complete the handover, it will take three or four days. Therefore, he will officially take office around the 20th.</p>

<p>Students Seize a Large Batch of Enemy Goods After the students in Suzhou middle schools went on strike, various tasks were extremely intense. Propaganda teams from female vocational schools and other schools have been giving anti-Japanese speeches in the bustling streets for days. Students from Suzhou High School and other schools were divided into thirteen groups to search for Japanese goods and seized a lot of them. The largest haul was from Ruitaifeng, with more than eighty bolts of cloth, and hundreds of pieces of cosmetics from the Datong Socks Factory. All of them are stored in Suzhou High School, awaiting disposal by the Anti-Japanese Association. It is reported that the seized Japanese goods are worth about 3,000 yuan. Serial Robberies Occur in Urban and Rural Areas Yesterday morning at about 4 o'clock, the home of Xu Ruisheng, who guarded Anleyuan at the Midu Bridge outside Fengmen, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen bandits dressed in gray short clothes, each holding a handgun. They broke down the door and ransacked the house. They then fled to the south. After investigation, the losses were estimated at more than 400 yuan. Also, in Xia Village, about six miles away from Xietang, a bandit boat suddenly arrived yesterday morning at 4 o'clock.

<p>Students Throughout the County Go on Strike Today After receiving a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference announcing a general student strike throughout the province, the Wuxi County Student Anti-Japanese Association held a representative meeting at the Provincial Education Institute in Sheqiaotou yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Shen Kuilong and resolved: (1) Students throughout the county will go on strike to take consistent action with students throughout the province; (2) In accordance with the resolutions of the Provincial Student Anti-Japanese Association, a general strike throughout the county will be held on the 17th; (3) The date of resumption of classes will be temporarily reserved.</p>
<p>A Major Kidnapping Case Occurs in the Seventeenth District The family of Qiang Puchen, who is wealthy in farmland, near Miaotang Bridge in Nian Eryi Tu, Fushan Township, in the 17th district of the county, was suddenly attacked by more than 20 bandits armed with box cannons, pistols, and sharp blades after 8 p.m. the night before last. The two thieves climbed over the high wall and entered, opened the door and let the bandits in. They firmly demanded Qiang Puchen, but could not find him, so they kidnapped his brother-in-law Zhang Xinchu's ten-year-old son Zongwei, and his clothes and silver were also taken away, resulting in heavy losses. In addition, more than a thousand acres of farmland were also taken away. Before leaving, the bandits opened fire continuously, and the residents did not dare to rescue them. Yesterday, Qiang Puchen had rushed back from his father-in-law's house in Huangtutang and immediately reported to the city, requesting that they be apprehended.</p>
<p>Oppose the Collection of Electricity Deposit The Qishuyan Power Plant has recently decided to collect electricity deposit from electricity users due to the increasing number of electricity users and the fear of arrears in electricity bills. Upon hearing this news, the users protested en masse. Yesterday, there were more than 280 commercial users in Beili and more than 300 residential users in the urban and rural areas. They all affixed their seals and sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, asking it to negotiate with the Qi Factory to withdraw the case, otherwise they were willing to cut the lines and form a municipal power plant to resist.</p>
<p>Wanted for Delinquent Theater Tax The chief of the county's finance bureau, Wang Li, recently received a letter from the education bureau stating that Xu Shide, the merchant who had previously been responsible for collecting the theater tax, had contracted to collect 2,000 yuan per month from January to June of this year for a period of six months, totaling 12,000 yuan. However, since July, Xu Shide and his guarantor, Ding [missing]jun (i.e., Ding Hesheng), have both disappeared without a trace, and the tax has not been settled. In addition to the 3,000 yuan that has been paid and the 2,000 yuan of deposit that has been confiscated, there is still 7,000 yuan outstanding, which has greatly embarrassed the education funding and made it impossible to raise the salaries of primary school teachers, and so on. After approving the letter, Chief Wang reported the situation to the county government yesterday, requesting that the former contractor Xu Shide be openly wanted, brought to justice, and forced to repay the debt in order to clear the procedures and emphasize the importance of education funds.</p>
<p>The Court Destroys Confiscated Opium and Red Pills Yang Keqian, the president of the county court of this county, considering that since the establishment of the court, a large number of opium, red pills, and smoking paraphernalia have been seized, specially burned the opium, red pills, and smoking paraphernalia seized from January to June of this year in public. Prior to the event, he presented a report to the High Court requesting it to send personnel to Wuxi to supervise the event. He also sent letters to various agencies and organizations to visit. A total of 216 pieces of opium, red pills, and smoking paraphernalia were burned.</p>

<p>Party and Government Agencies Prevent the Opening of a Public Assembly The Nanjin Student Union, together with the County National Salvation Student Union, opposed the County Executive Council's resolution to return the Japanese yarn from the two factories in Nanzha. It was resolved the day before yesterday to hold a large parade and to open a public assembly on the 15th. Considering that at this time of national crisis and heightened winter defense, it is inevitable that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble, the Party and government agencies specially summoned student representatives Gao Qingyue and others to talk, and turned to the students to stop the assembly. Zhang Yiyan, the acting principal of Nanjin, also rushed back from the province to try to curb the situation and prevent the matter from escalating. The method of handling the Japanese yarn will be determined after the Provincial Committee comes to Cheng to investigate. After the representatives returned to school to persuade the students, the students complied with the order and did not open the public assembly on the 15th to avoid unexpected incidents. Funds for Transportation Laborers Are First Paid 40,000 Yuan County Magistrate Ma received a telegram from the province instructing him to borrow and allocate 70,000 yuan to the province by the end of December to be used as transportation laborer funds. On the 14th, he convened a meeting of various agencies, district chiefs, and commercial firms to decide that the various money shops and factories would lend 30,000 yuan, and the finance bureau would collect and return the old debts and the busy canals. The remaining 40,000 yuan would be borrowed from various businesses and allowed to offset the winter payments in 1920. It was also decided that 40,000 yuan would be paid first on the 23rd.</p>

<p>Youth Support Ma Troupe Arrives in Zhen The Youth Volunteer Troupe to the Northeast to Support Ma arrived in Zhenzhou from Changzhou at about 8 p.m. yesterday. There were about 260 male and female members. The Provincial Party Headquarters specially sent Xie Chengyu, Yu Huaizhong, Wu Liangfu, and others to bring cakes and fruits to express their condolences and inquiries.

<p>The Current Situation of the Flood Victims in Funing The Funing area is divided into thirteen districts. The eleven districts that were more severely affected by the flood currently have about 100,000 flood victims, especially the elderly, weak, women, and children. The Disaster Relief Investigation and Relief Bureau only established soup kitchens in Funing, Goudun, Chenjiayang, and Tiancichang, providing porridge twice a day. However, the districts of Dongkan, Batan, and Liuliqitou are still lacking, resulting in flood victims all over the fields, crying and begging along the way, sleeping in the mist and eating in the wind. Their situation is pitiful. It is hoped that the disaster relief authorities will quickly seek relief so that the flood victims will not be displaced and freeze and starve in the ditches.</p>
<p>Tax Police Seize Smuggled Salt and Kill Starving People The flood victims in the northeast township of the county gathered to discuss going south to find food. There were about a thousand people, each carrying some smuggled salt, divided into more than 30 sailboats, sailing from Wuxin Port. When they passed through Goudun, they were seized by the tax police, resulting in a conflict. Six starving people were killed, more than ten were injured, and about thirty salt boats were seized. The case has been reported to the Yangzhou Inspection Office for handling.</p>

<p>Dongwu Third Middle School Students Petition A Mass Demonstration More than 200 students from Dongwu Third Middle School in this city went to the Wuxing County Party Headquarters at 9 a.m. yesterday to petition. Wu Boyu, a member of the Standing Committee of the headquarters, came out and invited the students to petition here today. He said that he did not yet understand the purpose of the petition, and asked them to first send representatives to contact him so that he could reply immediately. The student delegation then sent seven representatives, including Shen Rui, to the reception room with Wu to talk. The representatives handed over a petition, which included eight points, including immediately declaring war on Japan and punishing [missing]-country traitors. They requested that the petition be forwarded to the central government. Wu promised to forward it to the Provincial Party Headquarters. The representatives then proposed to restore the United Association of Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations of Various Schools in Wuxing in the shortest possible time. Wu replied that he would submit it to the Standing Committee for discussion. The representatives were satisfied and left in formation. When the petition group went to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to petition, no one came out to meet them. As a result, some of the people and students were outraged and slightly damaged the office equipment, doors, and windows of the association. At about 1 p.m., the petition group returned to school in formation and attended classes as usual. It is heard that the members of the Anti-Japanese Association believe that the students' actions were out of patriotic enthusiasm, and although the damaged objects were slightly damaged, the losses were still small, and it was decided not to pursue the matter.</p>

<p>The Machine Gun and Mortar Squadrons of the Tax Police Regiment Arrive in Hangzhou: The Finance Department of Zhejiang's Tax Police Regiment already had a contingent stationed in the Haining area. Yesterday, the First Tax Police Regiment, led by Wang Depu, arrived in Hangzhou at 11:30 AM, consisting of three machine gun squadrons and one mortar squadron, totaling over 500 men. They proceeded to the Haichao Temple to be stationed, in order to maintain order.</p>
<p>Incoming Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e78">Letter from Professors of the Zhejiang University College of Engineering to All Circles Regarding the Student Demonstrations in Hangzhou <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>We have been hired to teach here, and in our humble position, we originally intended to use our knowledge to contribute in a small way, studying and researching with the students to save China from its backwardness in science. Since taking office, we have been immersed day and night in lecturing, conducting experiments, and consulting research. Fortunately, the students are eager to learn, and their scientific knowledge is gradually increasing. The Zhejiang University College of Engineering has gained a small reputation in society. We hoped to continue in this direction, aspiring to join the ranks of the world's renowned universities. However, since the invasion by the Japanese on September 18th of this year, the students, filled with righteous indignation, organized an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and formed a student volunteer army, hoping to put their patriotic actions into practice. This is the natural duty of every citizen, and we deeply support it. We have all participated in the organization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the training of the volunteer army. Subsequently, personnel from the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters established the Hangzhou All-Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association, and our college also joined as a member. At that time, the Japanese goods inspectors hired by the Joint Association often failed to fulfill their responsibilities. The Joint Association repeatedly mobilized students from various schools, dividing them into groups for inspection. The students of our college worked tirelessly, braving wind and rain, taking turns to go out and handle matters conscientiously, earning the respect of the Party Headquarters personnel. Consequently, they were ordered in writing and orally to assign a large number of students from our college to take responsibility for searching for Gao Yitai's privately stored Japanese goods. The students followed the locations specified in the letter and were led by special commissioners. They indeed seized a large quantity of Japanese goods and, fearing their clandestine removal, guarded the premises overnight without food or drink, hoping to handle the matter thoroughly as a warning to others. Later, the Joint Association delayed the case for many days, ultimately resolving it vaguely with a fine of 6,000 yuan. The engineering college students could not understand the Party Headquarters' difficulties in dealing with various parties and suspected the corruption of the Joint Association's leaders. They also felt that joining the Joint Association could not help but was instead exploited, making them tools. Their faith in the Party Headquarters gradually diminished. When students from various schools in Hangzhou planned to form another Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association, the engineering college students also joined, intending to join the All-Circles Anti-Japanese Joint Association in the name of the Student Anti-Japanese Association, following the example of Shanghai and Nanjing. However, the Party Headquarters did not approve of this organization and issued an order from the Education Department to ban it, leading to the demonstration on December 10th. The students requested the Provincial Party Headquarters but were denied, resulting in the beating of committee members, the smashing of objects, and a petition to the Education Department, which refused to meet with them, leading to damage to Director Zhang's private residence and belongings. We could not prevent this unexpected action beforehand. The college president rushed to the Provincial Party Headquarters to dissuade them, but to little avail. We will share the responsibility for failing to educate the students properly. However, the Provincial Party Headquarters issued a statement afterward, suspecting President Li Zhenwu of condoning the actions and blaming the College of Engineering, as if the students from other schools were coerced or deceived into going by the College of Engineering. This kind of false propaganda is far from the truth, revealing ulterior motives. Recently, there have been joint letters from the printing, transportation, and pharmaceutical trade unions, requesting that engineering college students cut off their livelihoods. Today, various trade unions have issued statements denying this, showing that someone is fabricating facts with the intention of sabotage. We will not bother to argue further. However, what we cannot refrain from saying is that the students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation organization and volunteer army stemmed from a fervent patriotic sentiment and were open and selfless. The Party Headquarters' emphasis on engineering college students, assigning them the important task of searching Gao Yitai, also stemmed from a serious and conscientious attitude, open and selfless. At that time, the Hangzhou Min Guo Daily praised the students repeatedly, encouraging and supporting them in every possible way. Later, the college students, due to the lackluster handling of the Gao case, lost faith in the Party Headquarters, leading to this unfortunate incident, transforming a love for the country into actions that disrupted order, which we deeply regret. The Provincial Party Headquarters praised engineering college students before, but afterward, it focused on attacking the college and blaming it on a single school. The different attitudes before and after are perplexing, and we cannot understand the intention behind them. We hold the position of professors at this college and naturally bear the responsibility of guiding and advising students. However, according to current laws and regulations, all mass organizations are under the guidance of the Party Headquarters. Therefore, since the outbreak of this Anti-Japanese movement, we have only joined as individuals and have completely trusted the Party Headquarters to guide student actions, refraining from expressing any opinions to avoid causing misunderstandings. Now, unfortunately, this incident has occurred. We believe that while the students' actions may have exceeded the boundaries, the Party Headquarters also seems to have failed to fully fulfill its guiding responsibilities. At this time of national crisis, our patriotism is no less than anyone else's. We sincerely hope that both sides will regret their past mistakes, engage in self-reflection, and work together to save the nation, converging on the path of resisting Japan and saving the country. We should not use methods that create divisions and sow discord, which will only lead to further disputes. We further state that since the founding of the College of Engineering, more than twenty years have passed, and thousands of graduates have served in various fields. Their achievements are well known to society. All teachers and students in the school are extremely protective of their alma mater and will respond to any external destructive actions with all their strength. We respectfully ask for your understanding of our sincere intentions. Sincerely, All Professors of the National Zhejiang University College of Engineering, December 15th, 2020 of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>The faculty and staff of various universities in this city held a tea party at the new YMCA building yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Number of Participants Yesterday, participants included Zheng Hongnian, Chu Mingyi, Zhang Shouyong, Kang Xuanyi, Chen Zhuzun, Hu Shuhua, Jiang Zhongsan, Li Zhaohuan, He Tingqiu, Huang Zaoshi, Pan Wenhua, and over sixty others.</p>
<p>▲Meeting Details After the customary rituals, Chairman Chu Mingyi delivered a report, stating that the faculty and staff of various universities in Shanghai have historically lacked organization. In the face of the urgent national crisis, we should have a close-knit organization in order to take unified steps and guide students to engage in various concrete and effective patriotic movements. Other matters concerning faculty and staff themselves, such as treatment, research, and health, can also be handled by the joint association. Therefore, the organization of this group is indeed necessary. A meeting was then held for discussion, during which it was resolved to first elect seven preparatory committee members to undertake all preparatory work.</p>
<p>▲Elected Preparatory Committee Members The elected preparatory committee members are Zheng Hongnian, Chu Mingyi, Li Zhaohuan, Kang Xuanyi, Hu Shuhua, He Tingqiu, and Zhang Shouyong. It is reported that the association's declaration will be drafted and completed before the 23rd, and the first preparatory committee meeting will be held on the 26th to further determine the date of the general assembly.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of University Professors in Shanghai sent a telegram to Shanghai students going to Beijing, stating: To the Shanghai students of various schools at Nanjing Central University: According to reports, yesterday, students in Peiping went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and destroyed documents, and then went to the Central Party Headquarters and beat and detained Mr. Cai and Mr. Chen. Although this association knows that the students in Shanghai did not participate, the truth of this matter urgently needs to be clarified. The colleagues of this association have always believed that the patriotism of students in other places is as pure as that of students in Shanghai. However, we consider this kind of action that does not distinguish between right and wrong as inappropriate. We hope that you will telegraph back the circumstances of the incident at that time.

<h3 id="e88">The Plight of Tongji University <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>A telegraph from the National Tongji University states, All newspapers, please note: Since 1928, this school was completely converted into a national university, and the funds were uniformly allocated by the Ministry of Education. The budget has not increased for several years, so although the scale is there, the equipment is incomplete. Two years ago, it was desired to establish a science college in addition to the existing medical and engineering colleges to complete the university organization, but it could not be realized due to lack of funding. The monthly operating expenses are only more than 34,000 yuan, which is less than other national universities. The internship expenses and factory expenses of the medical and engineering colleges are more than those of other schools. Without funds, it must be suspended. More than 20 German professors are hired, and monthly salaries must be sent to maintain their lives. Last year, the Ministry of Education failed to pay this school's arrears for September and the operating expenses for October, November, December, and January, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. At that time, this school was already on the verge of collapse. In desperation, it had to sell more than 60,000 yuan of treasury bonds transferred by the previous administration to repay the salaries owed to the German professors in order to maintain operations. This year, the Ministry of Education again owes this school the operating expenses for September, October, November, and January for half a month, and the silver prices for the German professors have fallen, including a subsidy of 162,000 yuan together with the arrears for August, totaling more than 260,000 yuan in arrears for the tenth year. As a result, this school owes German professors salaries for as long as eight months. The newly hired professors this semester have only received one month's salary. The loan debts and goods debts owed to various stores are pressing urgently. The German professors have many complaints, and the president's dignity has been completely lost. The national face no longer exists. Documents and telegrams are exchanged back and forth, repeatedly appealing to the Ministry of Education, but to no avail. President Hu has repeatedly submitted his resignation to the National Government and the Ministry of Education, but it has not been approved. He could not bear to sit idly by and watch the highest institution of learning fall into closure, so he temporarily maintained operations by overdrafting funds from the bank in his personal capacity. On the one hand, he declared to the Ministry of Education that if it became impossible to maintain operations, he would declare a suspension even if his resignation was not approved. Now, the borrowed funds have long expired, and the Ministry of Education's funds have not yet been allocated, so the personal credit has been lost. This school's accounting vault is empty, and all measures have been suspended. Recently, the electricity and heating will not be supplied due to lack of coal, and the faculty and staff are on the verge of starvation. This school's colleagues are in an unsustainable situation, so they briefly describe the school's plight so that the society can understand the truth of the school's crisis, and hope that domestic and international wise people will take note. National Tongji University respectfully requests,</p>
<h3 id="e89">Letter from the Aurora University Anti-Japanese Association <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Aurora University Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association states: Esteemed Sir, Upon reading the education column of your esteemed newspaper and seeing the section on "Aurora's Response," we were extremely surprised. The current incident is indeed the result of the school's severe oppression. The facts are all there and have long been predictable by the public. The authorities, disregarding the date stipulated by the Ministry of Education, advanced the holiday without prior notice. In the dead of night, they suddenly used swift and overwhelming means to force the students to leave the school immediately. Their sinister intentions are self-evident. As for the letter stating that "many are still staying in the school," that is completely false. According to the registration results of our association, only general religious followers remain. Furthermore, saying that "students are unable to concentrate on their studies due to the current situation" is tantamount to self-admission and precisely demonstrates the cause of the unrest. This matter concerns our national educational rights. We request that this letter be published in the education column of your esteemed newspaper to correct the record and avoid confusing the public. We respectfully wish the chief editor of Shen Bao good health.</p>

<p>A letter from Fudan Experimental Middle School states: The news item published in your newspaper regarding the suspicion of a Fudan Party Ideology Teacher (which was issued by Shanghai News Agency) contains many inaccuracies. It was reported that someone at the time of the "January 29th" Incident stated that our school secretary, Mr. Xu Zeyi, had made a phone call to the city party headquarters. Later, the Fudan University Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent people to investigate and found that this was not the case. Unexpectedly, at 10 a.m. on the 15th of this month, dozens of university students suddenly rushed into the office of our school's director. Without asking for reasons, they arbitrarily beat Mr. Xu Zeyi, causing a severe head injury, and destroyed much of the furniture in the office. All the school's faculty and students are deeply shocked and frightened. The report that there was a conflict with volunteer soldiers on the playground is completely untrue. We request that you publish this letter to clarify the truth. Respectfully addressed to the editorial department of Shen Bao, Fudan Experimental Middle School, December 16th.</p>

<p>Over three hundred male and female spectators witnessed the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team display their agile figures and flexible skills, resulting in a one-sided victory of 34 to 11, defeating West Qing A in last night's West Qing Women's Basketball game. They could not help but beam with joy and leave happy. Liangjiang's strength was originally above West Qing A, so their victory was expected. Shao Xi was the best forward. Xi's performance last night was particularly good, and Wan Rong was uniquely brave. The three inside guards were able to fulfill their duties. Although Chen Xijun was short, she was no less diligent than others. Zhuang Wang was an experienced player, handling things with ease. The first quarter started with a free throw by Shao Jinying and took the lead with 8 to 4. Shao scored the most points in this quarter, totaling six points, and Xi got two points. All three of West Qing A scored. Liangjiang had seventeen and West Qing A had eight points in the first half. In the second quarter, Xi shot at will and was always successful, scoring seven points, and Shao also scored two points. West Qing A's forwards had difficulty moving and only got one point. The score was seven to one. In the last quarter, Shao and Xi were happy and successful, breaking through the enemy's basket. The inside guards also firmly defended their walls, making it difficult to cross. They also took the lead with ten to two. As a result, Liangjiang won 34 to 11. The referee was Shu Hong.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Money, Reason, and Emotion <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Wuyai</p>
<p>In the mysterious and active life, we can often find its contradictory and ridiculous phenomena. The composition of these phenomena is probably nothing more than the interplay of three elements: money, reason, and emotion. From these elements arise the effects of joy, sorrow, separation, and reunion, which develop into an endless series of living dramas. The whole life, therefore, continues with a false mask, making some lively embellishments in a silent society.</p>
<p>The Tianyi Film Company's recent production of "Last Love" has captured these three elements as the soul of the entire play. From the first point, we realize that because Zhang Shouyu sponsored Li Gengxin to study, he wanted to make the crippled girl his spouse, but the result was a bubble. This is a clear proof that money cannot spur reason. The second point: Wang Jingfang and Li Gengxin were originally a sweet engaged couple, but unintentionally discovered that his father was a farmer, and suddenly turned a blind eye, seeking another lover. This is another clear proof that money dominates emotion. The third point: Li Gengxin knew that misappropriating public funds was against the law, but because he wanted to rescue Liang Xiaofen's pitiful situation, he unintentionally committed an illegal act, the result of which was irremediable and made him a fellow inmate. This is another clear proof that emotion and money oppress reason. And the last scene, because Liang Xiaofen returned the eight hundred yuan for redemption, made Li Gengxin's doubts dispelled and they reconciled, which can further prove that money has the power to restore feelings. In short, the center of this whole play is life, so we feel particularly cordial when we watch it, and its organization is an active change of a love word, and we can more clearly understand a little sincerity between parents and children, friends and couples. As for the clarity of the sound and white in this film and the beauty of the scenery, it can be said to be loud in domestic sound films, and people have said it first, so there is no need for me to talk about it.</p>

<p>— Shanling</p>
<p>Love Touchstone Recently, Tianyi Film Company has made a love touchstone. Young men and women can use it to test whether their lover's love for themselves is sincere. It has been repeatedly tested and proven. It is truly a priceless treasure for the youth world. From today onwards, this love touchstone will be on public display at the Xinguang Grand Theater.</p>
<p>▲ The famous garden with spring in all four seasons In Shanghai recently, a new Songbin Park has been built. Not only are the scenery and objects secluded and beautiful, but also the climate in the park is spring in all four seasons. A few days ago, the north wind roared and the weather was severely cold, but the park was still filled with spring breeze and weeping willows. Pairs of young lovers are coming and going in an endless stream. It can be said to be a "fairyland."</p>
<p>▲ The failure of buying a son-in-law In a certain town in China, there was a wealthy man surnamed Zhang. Because his daughter had a physical disability, the marriage problem was difficult to solve. He actually came up with the whimsical idea of spending money to buy a handsome son-in-law. But this plan ended in failure.</p>
<p>▲ The most exquisite residence Recently, the most exquisite building in Shanghai is Miss Wang ChenFong's (Miss Wang Jingfang's) residence. It is said that everything in her home, the arrangements and furnishings, is magnificent, exquisite and elegant, and can be regarded as second to none.</p>

<p>— Youru</p>
<p>I envy the harmony of the pearls and the walls, but I never thought that the affairs of Huyang would not be successful. I, you, you and I get to know each other in vain, and regret being affectionate for a time.</p>
<p>I broke through the poverty and changed my original intention. The dream of tenderness broke and the hatred turned deeper. I discussed the true and false of love and love, but most of the children valued gold.</p>
<p>I went to the theater for this sorrow, and I accidentally met the old Pearl Girl. In those years, I was a fellow student and now a singer. When I talked about the vicissitudes of life, I wanted to break my heart.</p>
<p>I planned to redeem the beauty, but the price was not small. I secretly moved the public funds. When the incident happened in Dongchuang, I was put in a cage. The hidden pain was unspeakable, only tears fell.</p>
<p>I just left the prison and sighed that I had no home. I wandered on the street with the setting sun slanting. Suddenly, I met and told my heart. Dongfeng was haggard and a flower.</p>
<p>I am willing to keep poverty and work in the factory. This body has no share in the Qiluo Cong. The willow branches have the section of the chaste pine. I want to pay homage to Zhangtai.</p>

<p>— Flower Farmer</p>
<p>Last Love is the latest sound production of Tianyi. Mr. Shao Zuiweng himself directed it. It will be publicly shown at Xinguang today. I also went to watch the test film. Touching my feelings, I would like to describe my humble opinion. The plot of the film is novel, strange, tortuous and multifaceted, and it is suitable for human nature everywhere. It is not absurd and strange. The screenwriters are Su Yi and Yao Sufeng. It was revised by Yan Duhe, Zhou Shoujuan and others. The handwritings of famous artists are indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>In the play, Yang Naimei plays the female student Wang Jingfang. Her demeanor is romantic. Her movements are elegant. Her expressions are subtle. Zhang Zhenduo plays the college student Li Gengxin. He has experienced joy, happiness, sorrow, and sorrow in the film. One face, sometimes the muscles are relaxed, sometimes the brow is furrowed, sometimes the eyes are angry and the eyes are cracked. The performance is wonderful. Yi Jinglin plays the female singer Liang Xiaofen. A kind of entanglement and poignant, gentle and affectionate. It is especially moving and lovable. The other roles are well-performed. They can be called their jobs. Wei Pengfei. Ma Dongwu. Qin Haha and others have a good record of performance. It is a pity that the roles played are not very important. We cannot understand its art much.</p>
<p>Photography and lighting are both excellent. The accuracy and clarity of the pronunciation is even better than "The Color of the Singing Field". It can be said that it has never been seen before.</p>
<p>There are fewer songs, dances and music in this film than in "The Color of the Singing Field". Therefore, the plot is more compact. Violet sings and dances "Mulan Joins the Army." The tune is quite novel and unique. Chen Yumei and Xuan Jinglin sang "Wuhua Cave." It is extremely round and pleasant to listen to. Xuan sang "Donghua Feng" in the last scene of "The Color of the Singing Field". The sound and rhyme were poignant. The aftersound lingered around the beam. It lasted for three days. I was deeply moved by it. There are no similar plots in "Last Love". Therefore, I can't appreciate this kind of mood again. I personally feel a lack of regret.</p>

<p>— Tianqi</p>
<p>▲ Liang Junzhen</p>
<p>Modern women talk about love, but they do not understand the true meaning of love. There are many cases of those who combine in the morning and separate in the evening. As for those who are deeply in love, go through all kinds of hardships and do not change their original aspirations, I get one person, namely Liang Junzhen. Junzhen is from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. She lost her mother when she was young. She has no brothers or sisters. Her father was a famous scholar. He was talented but his life was stingy. He was frustrated and did not talk to himself. Junzhen served her father very filial. She studied at Yuezhou Middle School. Every test is listed in the top rank. Her father often said to people, "This is my family's uncombed Jinshi." There was a male classmate Li Gengxin in the school. He was young, handsome, and his character was crowned by his peers. He was good at sports, especially football. Junzhen admired him very much. After Gengxin graduated, he went to Shanghai to enter the university. Junzhen's family was destroyed by fire because of the carelessness of her neighbors. Not long after, her father died. Junzhen was alone. Ding this great event. Wandering and lacking a plan. Her neighbor Liu Jinpei was an old actor. He lent Junzhen gold and asked her to bury her father. And take learning the drama from him as a condition of exchange. Junzhen had no choice but to agree. Junzhen was indeed smart and soon became an artist. Changing his name to Xiaofen. She performed on the Chunjiang Grand Stage in Shanghai. Fang Yu rose. One day, a guest suddenly came to visit the apartment. When she went out to see him, it was Li Gengxin, a classmate in middle school. It turned out that Gengxin had dropped out of school for some reason at this time. He was a clerk in a law firm. He watched the drama with his friend. He accidentally met Junzhen. So he came to visit her. The next day, Liu suddenly said to Junzhen. He said that he would respond to the invitation of Harbin and take her north in the near future. Junzhen was very frightened. She thought she was weak and could not bear the hardship of the journey. So he consulted with Gengxin. Gengxin agreed to pay the debt on his behalf so that he could regain his freedom. Gu Gengxin's situation was very difficult. She had no idea what to do. There would be 2,000 gold in public funds. She secretly moved 800 gold to pay Junzhen. She did not know that Liu had privately agreed with the local tyrant Jiang to sell Junzhen as Jiang's concubine for 2,000 gold. After Gengxin paid the money, Liu Jiang forced Junzhen to leave. Junzhen refused to do so. After arriving at Jiang's house, she was closely monitored. One day, Jiang was drunk. Junzhen was able to escape by taking advantage of the gap. She went to visit Gengxin. Gengxin was imprisoned for losing money. After he was released, he did not know where to go. Junzhen had nowhere to go. She worked in a factory to support herself. One day, a strange guest broke into the door. His clothes were ragged. His head was covered with dirt. He scolded Junzhen angrily. I was surprised and asked him. That person was Gengxin. At first, Gengxin went to visit her the next day after paying Junzhen. But she had already left. The whole family moved elsewhere. And Gengxin was imprisoned for this. Gengxin was deceived by Junzhen, causing her to be disgraced. She hated her to the bone. Now that I met him, I followed him to vent my anger. Junzhen knew that Gengxin had misunderstood. So he described the process in detail. And showed Gengxin the paper inside the pillow. The previous 800 gold was still there. Gengxin finally understood. A pair of lovers in distress lived together. His friend Su Yi compiled this matter into a script. It was made into a sound film by Tianyi Film Company. The title of the play is "Last Love." It will be released simultaneously in Shanghai Xinguang, Nanjing National and World, and Suzhou Oriental from today.</p>

<p>— Gao Jilin</p>
<p>Chapter Half The Last Love</p>
<p>The God of Love and the God of Wealth fought, and the God of Love often failed. Because Gengxin lacked "big Lhasa" in his family, the girl who used to say that she truly loved his personality and talents finally abandoned him lightly. He lost his love.</p>
<p>The gift that losing love gives to young people is a burden of boredom, a burden of annoyance. Naturally, Li Gengxin also received a heavy share. One day, Gengxin's friend Jiqun invited him to go to the theater, wanting to use the dancing shadows and songs to relieve his sorrow. But a female singer Liang Xiaofen on the stage attracted Gengxin's attention. The female singer's face was strangely familiar. Who is it? Think, think, oh, remember! Isn't that his female classmate Liang Junzhen from middle school? How did she get on stage? Ask and ask to see the case, don't you know where Liang Xiaofen lives? The answer to the case is "56 Minguo Road."</p>
<p>The next day, Gengxin and Jiqun met Liang Xiaofen at 56 Minguo Road.</p>
<p>"Miss Liang, how did you start singing?" After the usual greetings, Gengxin asked with concern.</p>
<p>"Alas, it's a long story!......" With a light sigh, Liang Xiaofen told her unfortunate experience. The family was burned by fire. Her father died again, and she was heavily in debt. She was unable to repay it. The environment forced her to live the life of a singer. This encounter aroused Gengxin's deep sympathy.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Gengxin was sitting at home when Liang Xiaofen suddenly ran to him. The first sentence she said when they met was, "I'm going to Harbin with my master in three days."</p>
<p>"Oh, Harbin? That's a long way away! A long journey of thousands of miles, can you bear this hardship?"</p>
<p>"I owe my master eight hundred yuan, I can't think of it! Gengxin, can you think of a way for me? Thank you!"</p>
<p>"Okay, let me think about it!" Gengxin was controlled by emotion and agreed.</p>
<p>Having agreed, did Gengxin have eight hundred yuan? He is now just a clerk in a lawyer's office! What he has is enthusiasm, emotion, and what he lacks is "big Lhasa," but he feels that he cannot but shoulder the responsibility of helping his classmates. Okay! He finally took on the responsibility. Coincidentally! The lawyer happened to have two thousand yuan to send to the court, so he moved eight hundred yuan, immediately gave it to Xiaofen, and asked Jiqun to quickly find a way to borrow it to make up for it.</p>
<p>But, Gengxin was fooled! A day later, when he went to see Liang Xiaofen again, it was already empty, giving him an unexpected disappointment. When he returned to the apartment, although Jiqun had already borrowed three hundred yuan for him, but,! useless,! The incident was exposed,! Two police officers came and took him away. Result? Li Gengxin embezzled public funds and was sentenced to three months in prison.</p>
<p>"Misfortunes never come singly," the old saying is right! Now, all the misfortunes in the world have fallen on Li Gengxin's head. In order to help his classmates,! Misappropriate public funds, for misappropriating public funds, please put him in prison. But is Liang Xiaofen grateful to him? She has already drifted away, like a yellow crane. This is not enough, his good friend is going to Tianjin, and before leaving, he brought him a sad news: "Your father was so worried about you being in prison that he fell ill, and he is getting worse every day. Now he is unfortunately dead!"</p>
<p>After three months of iron window flavor, Gengxin came out again.</p>
<p>A handsome young man is now disheveled. Gengxin walked on the street with a wounded heart. Ah, unfortunately! In front of a park, he met the lover who abandoned him, walking shoulder to shoulder with a young man in a suit. Now she has changed her third lover. A modern girl's boyfriend is like wearing leather shoes, if you are tired of wearing them, you can change a pair, and then change a pair. Gengxin couldn't stand it, so he prepared to go forward and teach her a lesson, but a police officer came to interfere. "Get out, hooligan."</p>
<p>Gengxin walked away dejectedly again. He suddenly felt the emptiness in his stomach at this time, so he went to a small restaurant to eat. Alas, the enemy, Liang Xiaofen, also ran into him! He was so angry that his stomach almost burst, and he followed her to her home in one breath.</p>
<p>"Hum, a liar! You put me in this situation, now I've run into you!......"</p>
<p>"Take it easy, let me tell you,..." Liang Xiaofen said calmly, and she told her experience again "like this like that". Gengxin was relieved when he heard this, knowing that Xiaofen really didn't betray him.</p>
<p>They hugged each other warmly, and the shadows of a pair of lovers merged together.</p>

<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>In the middle of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty. Japanese pirates ravaged the coastal counties. The warning came. The people were shocked. Wang Qiqin, the magistrate of Wuxi County at that time. He was shrewd and capable. He was valued by his superiors. After taking office, he saw that the city walls were destroyed. He immediately raised money to repair them. Before the work was half finished. The Japanese pirates suddenly arrived. Only a hundred miles away from the city. Wang heard the alarm. He urged the craftsmen to work day and night. He ordered his son Kebo to supervise the work. Kebo saw that the craftsmen were extremely tired. He felt sorry for them. He immediately ordered them to rest for a while. By the time the Japanese pirates approached the city. The city walls of the East Gate had not been repaired. Wang immediately beheaded Kebo for delaying the work. The soldiers and civilians were horrified. No one dared to be lazy. At that time, the flags of the Japanese pirates could be seen faintly. Wang was in a hurry to think of a plan. He used blue cloth to protect the battlements. Secretly, he continued to urge the craftsmen to build. To prevent the unexpected. The reason why the Japanese pirates were slow to arrive. There is also a reason. The Japanese chief captured the villager He Wulu. He forced him to guide them. He Mingzhi knew that the city walls were not strong. He was still being repaired. So he led the Japanese pirates to travel far and tortuously. In order to hope that the city builders would complete their work. It can defend against the enemy. Later, he was known by the Japanese chief. Five brothers. They were martyred at the same time. By the time the Japanese pirates attacked the city. The city had already been prepared. Arrows and stones were fired down. The Japanese pirates killed. There were more than a thousand people. The Japanese chiefs gathered a large army to attack the city and the city fell. Wang Qiqin also died in battle. The fierce martyrdom. It is comparable to Zhang Suiyang. The imperial court ordered the construction of a special ancestral hall in Xiyi. To commend his achievements. The god of Nanshui Xianmiao. According to legend, he is Wang Qiqin. The people of the city worshipped him. The incense is strong for three hundred years without waning. Today's guardians of the land. Reading this article. I can't help but feel guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e105">New Year's Three Friends in Winter <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>The north wind howls. The six-petaled snowflakes flutter. The sound of the lunar New Year drums moves, indicating the year is ending. At this time, the earth is desolate, and the flowers and trees wither. Only the pine, bamboo, and plum, not competing with the peach and plum for spring, stand proudly in the bitter cold, appreciating their own solitary beauty, being sober while all others are drunk. This is why people sigh and call them the Three Friends of Winter. Alas! The storm knows the strong grass, and troubled times recognize loyal ministers. In the cold of winter, one sees the pine, bamboo, and plum; in times of chaos, there are heroes. Today, I find new Three Friends of Winter. Who are these three friends? Ma, Han, and Liang, the three heroes of the Northeast! Ma Zhanshan, with his isolated army beyond the border, fought fiercely against the invading soldiers in the frozen wilderness. With weary troops, he resisted the advancing enemy and still managed to achieve repeated victories. Even though his ammunition was exhausted and reinforcements were cut off, he retreated to Hailun but continued to reorganize the remaining forces, waiting for the opportunity to strike. The enemy chieftains and national traitors tried to lure him with benefits and threaten him with force, but he remained unmoved. Isn't this like the pine, bamboo, and plum, standing proudly despite the relentless assault of frost and snow? During the Sino-Russian War, Han Guangdi, with a small force, was stationed in Jalainor, fighting against the powerful Russian army, many times larger, defending the country and fulfilling the duty of a soldier to protect the land, disregarding life and death. His situation was no less arduous than General Ma's today. In the end, he exhausted himself and died in service. His loyal heart and righteous spirit shine like the sun and moon. He remained pure while the world was turbid. Isn't this the steadfastness of pine and bamboo, the essence of winter plum? Liang Zhongjia was also a regimental commander during the Sino-Russian War. In the autumn of great apprehension and turbulence, he led his troops to garrison Manzhouli, facing the onslaught of the strong Russian army coming from the west along the Chinese Eastern Railway. He repeatedly defeated the numerous enemies with a small force, defending the besieged city stubbornly for a month without yielding. When ammunition and weapons were exhausted, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat, vowing to protect the national territory and not fearing death. His hardship and dedication matched Han's. Later, surrounded by enemies on all sides, with roads and communication cut off, the foreign consuls in the city all requested him to retreat in order to protect the people and their lives. Knowing that the situation was hopeless, he cried to heaven three times, pulled out his gun to commit suicide. However, the sharp-eyed Japanese consul quickly grabbed his wrist, preventing his death. Liang said, "Since I cannot die at this time, but there are no surrendered generals in the world. Although I am incompetent, I swear to kill another ten or hundred enemies and die exhausted at the hands of the invaders." With a shout, dozens followed him, charging out to the south, scattering the enemy before them, killing many. In the end, exhausted, he tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat, but he failed and was captured by the enemy and imprisoned in Khabarovsk, Russia, under strict surveillance, unable to seek death. Later, when the war ended and peace was negotiated, he was allowed to return. His superiors, impressed by his loyalty and bravery, allowed him to continue to defend Manzhouli. The people, hearing this, welcomed him on the outskirts of the city by the thousands. He worked even harder, determined to wash away his previous shame. But Heaven did not favor him, and he died suddenly in bed. Thousands of people surrounded him, weeping, all men, women, old and young, from Manzhouli. Doctors determined that he had died of a broken heart. Alas! He did die of a broken heart. Indeed, his heart had been broken during the siege, not suddenly after his return. Therefore, wasn't Liang's death the same as General Han's, a martyrdom for the country? The world only knows Han's great righteousness and sacrifice, remembering him endlessly. But Liang is mostly forgotten, which I greatly regret. These three men, Ma resisting the Japanese, Han and Liang fighting the Russians, stood tall in the Northeast, a triumvirate. Today's soldiers only know about rights and are only concerned with clinging to life. But these men acted in the opposite way. When they were humbly serving in the Northeast, unknown and unheard of, they did not compete with the peach and plum for beauty. Once foreign aggression came, they bravely stepped forward, unyielding and indomitable, showing integrity in the cold winter. Are they not the pine, bamboo, and plum of the winter? Therefore, I call them the new Three Friends of Winter.</p>

<p>— A Member of the Youth Supporting Ma Group</p>
<p>(1) The Hero's Difficulty</p>
<p>Clouds of sorrow piled up. Even the heavens were grieving to the extreme, intermittently shedding tears. At this time, my older sister was packing my luggage. My mother was covering her face, sobbing. My younger brother didn't go to school. My father? He was also sighing in grief. And the loyal nanny, she was comforting my mother, telling her not to be sad, while at the same time, in a sorrowful and gentle tone, begging me not to go.</p>
<p>Ah, this tragic environment, it truly was tragic. But, no matter how tragic the family was, my resolve could not be shaken.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, Mom. We are citizens of the Republic of China. When the country is in trouble, we should fulfill our duties as citizens. If none of us goes to save the country, the country will be lost, and we will become slaves of the imperialists," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, what you say is not wrong. But China and Japan are now negotiating with the League of Nations. Both sides must abide by the promise to prevent the situation from becoming serious. Look, the central government is not even mobilizing troops, fearing that the Japanese will use it as an excuse. If you go, wouldn't you be undermining the government's credibility?"</p>
<p>"Moreover, you don't have any weapons. Even if you did, how could you match the Japanese army? Let's not even talk about that. But you need to have a backup force to advance."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, it's a long way to Heilongjiang. By the time you get to Beiping, the Japanese army will have already sent troops to block the way forward. How will you get there? Even if you do get there, General Ma will definitely not let you go to the front lines. Besides, the Northeast is extremely cold. Your fingers and toes will freeze. You are in Jiangnan, you really don't know how severe it is."</p>
<p>My dear father gave me this lecture. I could only accept it. But my resolve could not be shaken. My mother was still sobbing, and crying even more sadly. And so, I resolutely said:</p>
<p>"Mom, don't cry. Just pretend you gave birth to one less child."</p>
<p>As soon as I said these words, my father's eyes gradually turned red. My mother started crying loudly. My older sister, younger brother, and nanny were also shedding tears like rain.</p>
<p>Alas, I realized I had said the wrong thing. I still regret it now.</p>
<h3 id="e107">A Record of the National Humiliation Room at the Songjiang First Public Education Center <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Gong</p>
<p>The Songjiang First Public Education Center has always been highly praised for its progress in its work. Now, at a time when the brutal Japanese are acting wantonly and the nation is in a perilous state, the center has specially opened a National Humiliation Room to awaken our compatriots. The threshold is worn through by the daily visitors. Yesterday, I was invited by the director, Mr. Shen Benqian, to view the so-called National Humiliation Room. Thus, I take up my pen to record it.</p>
<p>The National Humiliation Room is located on the upper floor of the center, in the northern part. Over the door hangs a red heart, inscribed with "National Humiliation," pierced by a sharp arrow. Upon entering, one sees national humiliation models displayed in glass cases on both sides of the room, created by Director Shen, Mr. Yu Xiaolian, and Mr. Shen Mingruo. They include descriptions and phonetic symbols. Looking closely, one sees piles of wooden boxes and soldiers standing guard, with a man in a yellow jacket sitting beside them, resembling a commander: Lin Zexu's destruction of British soil (opium). A map is spread open, with the British flag planted on it: the result of the Opium War, ceding Hong Kong and opening five treaty ports. Two peaks stand facing each other, with Qing soldiers lined up strictly at the pass: the Battle of Zhennanguan. Beside it, a man in a red hat and yellow jacket sits talking with Westerners: Li Hongzhang's negotiations after the Sino-French War. Huge waves surge, with warships sinking into the sea: the Sino-Japanese War. A man in a red hat and yellow jacket sits in a green sedan chair, his face injured, with a broken glass window and a Japanese man holding a pistol, making a shooting gesture beside him: the Japanese man Oyama Kitaro's assassination attempt on the peace negotiation minister Li Hongzhang. A vast expanse of water, with warships gathered, and Qing soldiers guarding the cannons on the fort: the Eight-Nation Alliance's attack on Dagu. A face resembling the image on the silver three-dollar coin of the Republic of China, holding a pen and signing a document, with the calendar showing May 9th: Yuan Shikai's signing of the Twenty-One Demands, a treaty that sold out the country. Beside it, a piece of paper written in tiny characters: the full text of the Twenty-One Demands. A man in Japanese clothing shooting workers: the killing of Gu Zhenghong by the Japanese in the cotton mill. An Indian policeman in front of the police station raising a gun, with a Chinese man lying in a pool of blood: the May 30th Massacre in the Shanghai British Concession. Foreign soldiers firing across the river, with Chinese people running wildly, many falling to the ground: the Shakem Massacre. The river roars, with a ship being hit: Yang Sen's warship being sunk by a British merchant ship. A warship with huge cannons bombarding the city walls: the British warships bombing Wanxian. City buildings destroyed, corpses scattered, with a large group of soldiers, riding horses and dragging cannons, entering the city: the Japanese soldiers entering Jinan. In the darkness of night, a searchlight shines, with several Japanese soldiers holding a man, tying his hands and cutting off his nose, blood flowing all over his face: the brutal killing of our diplomat Cai Gongshi in the May 3rd Jinan Incident. Fields and paths crisscross, with many people hoeing and digging ditches: the cause of the Wanbaoshan Incident. Shops destroyed, Chinese people beaten, red and green silk fabrics hanging on the power lines: Koreans, incited by the Japanese, engaging in anti-Chinese riots. Under the starlight, cannons fire incessantly, city walls collapsing: the Japanese soldiers' attack on Shenyang on September 18th. A military man holding guns, cannons, airplanes, silver boxes, and the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries: the deeds of Honjo...</p>
<p>trampling on the Eastern Provinces and looting wantonly. Alas! Old hatreds and new sorrows are gathered in one room. The exquisite craftsmanship and profound intentions are enough to awaken people. Seeing the scenes, one feels as if one is personally experiencing them, truly leaving one with endless feelings. Mr. Shen told me: "We only hope that this room can be removed soon and replaced with a display of war trophies." Alas, I wonder if the Chinese people will be able to live up to Mr. Shen's expectations.</p>

<p>▲Ice Games</p>
<p>In recent years, ice games have become popular in Beiping in winter. Beihai Park, covered in a hundred acres of silver, is especially suitable for this. Male and female students from various universities, dressed in beautiful and strange costumes, gallop through it, even more crowded than the dance floor in summer. The South does not have such solid ice, so it will never be able to see this grand gathering. This custom was imported from the West. However, in the past, the lower classes often did this. The "Changbai Dun Chong Yanjing Suishi Ji" says, "Ice skates are made of iron, with a single strip in the middle, tied to the shoes. One can move when standing up, but cannot stop temporarily. The skillful ones can skim like dragonflies touching water or purple swallows cutting through the waves. This entertainment is also presented at imperial banquets. In winter, water is sprinkled on earthen mounds to create ice mountains, which can be more than ten feet high and extraordinarily smooth. Strong eunuchs are made to wear fur-lined pigskin shoes and slide down from the top, without bending their bodies, which is called 'playing on the slippery ice.' Those who can slide straight down without falling are considered the best." The "Rixia Jiuwen Kao" says, "In the winter months, Taiye Pond holds ice games, practicing labor and giving rewards, to simplify military affairs and cultivate national customs." Thus, this is originally a Manchu custom. I think that the Tang people's "splashing cold Hu" game must be similar to this. In cold countries, the games also draw from the local scenery.</p>
<p>The "Yanjing Suishi Ji" also says, "After the winter solstice, when the water and lakes are firmly frozen, ice beds are available at places such as Shicha Lake, the moat, and the two sluice gates. One person pulls it, and it moves very quickly. It is about five feet long and three feet wide, made of wood, with iron strips on the bottom. It can seat three or four people. On clear, sunny days after snow, it is like traveling in a jade pot." Wang and ministers who have received imperial orders are also allowed to ride sleds within the Xiyuan Gate. The sleds are very beautiful, with a canopy like a carriage roof to protect from wind and snow. According to the "Yiqing Ge Zacao," during the Ming Dynasty, people who liked to have fun would often link more than ten beds together on Jishuitan, bringing wine and food in baskets, and spreading rugs on top, drinking merrily in the ice and snow, which was truly a heroic and joyful affair.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Unfair Cry of the Women's World <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Bin</p>
<p>In "A Doll's House," there is a famous line spoken by Nora: "For this, countless women have been sacrificed." Ibsen, in his depiction, ruthlessly exposes the contradictions of human life. Especially these kinds of famous lines were worth the enthusiastic declarations of this kind of unfair cry filled with people from various ports in Scandinavia at that time. After they left the theater, they all competed to imitate the tone of the characters in the play, expressing enthusiastic disputes and sympathy.</p>
<p>Originally, both men and women inherited the same living functions from their parents and should receive equal treatment. However, because of the historical erroneous concept, there was an inhuman and unbalanced discrimination. As a result, many sad and indignant incidents of injustice were created in the dark society. Now, our country's new law has already liberated this bond of women's economy. "Women have the right to inherit the property of blood relatives and direct ascendants." This is a clear indication from the new law of granting women equal rights. The Shanghai Star Film Company recently filmed "Unfortunately Born as a Daughter," also based on this point, making a cry of injustice for our oppressed women. The play narrates how Fang Renzhai, in order to make his nephew covet his property, bribed an obstetrician to transform the daughter born by his concubine into male attire, falsely passing off her as a husband's son, in order to resist the people in the clan from seizing the property. Unexpectedly, sixteen years later, this secret plan was revealed to the clan members by the midwife, holding a grudge. The clan members then sued in court, thinking they had succeeded. What they did not expect was that at this time, the law liberated women's rights, giving them the right to inherit property. The cunning clan members who looked down on women were now looking at each other in dismay and suffered a great blow. This play depicts the contradictory points of women's treatment, purely revealing them from the side. It can be said to be a sigh of relief for women who have been gasping under deformed forces for thousands of years. I know that this film will be welcomed by the women's world and praised by the audience. Its stimulating depth should not be inferior to that of Scandinavia towards Ibsen.</p>

<p>Chapter 3: Escape from the Tiger's Mouth</p>
<p>Those two bandit soldiers also had this intention. They agreed, and so knocked on the temple door with the gun butts, quickly opening the temple door. One bandit soldier hurriedly dragged Zhongshu off the horse, carried her on his body, and walked into the temple. The two bandit soldiers followed with a flashlight, entering together. They soon arrived at the main hall. At this time, although Zhongshu's body could not move, her mind was very clear. She knew that these bandit soldiers were about to rape her. Then, how would she deal with it? The Mauser pistol in her hand had been taken away by them, as if a chick had met a weasel, powerless. Therefore, when the bandit soldier laid her down on the prayer cushion, she felt a burst of grief and indignation, and fainted. Suddenly, she heard a gunshot beside her, waking her three wandering souls. Opening her eyes, she saw two bandit soldiers stabbing back and forth with a black figure beside her. Soon after, she saw a flash of sword light, and one bandit soldier fell down. The other bandit soldier darted out, but just as he reached outside the hall, there was another gunshot, and that bandit soldier also fell to the ground. As her heart was still agitated, she saw the flashlight light up, and she could clearly see that the black figure standing beside her was Hua Naiqiang. She could not help but be half-surprised and half-delighted. It turned out that when Hua Naiqiang was relieving himself in the woods, he suddenly heard gunshots, frightening him out of his wits. He hurriedly pulled up his pants and came out of the woods. He saw three Japanese soldiers heading forward with the sound of hooves. He hid and looked around, only to see a dead horse. Zhongshu's beautiful figure was nowhere to be found. She had probably been captured by the Japanese soldiers. Then, he must rescue her from danger. He couldn't bear to live alone. So, he quietly followed them, wanting to find an opportunity to act and rescue her. Later, he saw the Japanese soldiers escorting Zhongshu into the temple, assuming that they would do something bestial. He gathered his courage, tightly grasped his pistol, and quietly slipped into the temple. Fortunately, in the darkness, the bandit soldiers did not notice. Just as they were about to lay hands on Zhongshu, in a critical situation, he suddenly leaped out, raised his gun, and shot down the first one. Then, he jumped into the hall. The weapons of the two bandit soldiers had been put aside. They were caught off guard, drew their bayonets, and lunged at him fiercely. Hua Naiqiang displayed his courage and skill, and killed the two bandit soldiers together. He returned his sword to its scabbard and picked up a flashlight to look at Zhongshu. They both said, "What a close call!" Zhongshu happily said, "If you hadn't come to save me, I can't imagine what would have happened. But how did you come to save me?" Hua Naiqiang took Zhongshu's Mauser pistol and handed it to her, saying, "The situation is urgent. Let's go quickly. We can talk later." So Zhongshu stood up and followed him out of the temple door. Fortunately, two horses were standing there, gnawing on their bits. The two leaped onto the saddles and, adding a few whips, splashed past the railroad and galloped forward.</p>

<p>▲Swap Longs Raise by Seventeen Taels Zero. Yesterday, the 16th, gold prices again fell into weariness. The changes were still violent, with no direction of advance or retreat. However, due to the start of swaps, it opened half an hour early, at 8:30 AM. The brokers had gathered at the door of the exchange before 8:00 AM. First, a short position offset a long position, initially at around seven taels, then increasing to eight or nine taels. When the price was posted in the exchange, it was ten taels. Later, more long positions moved in, hoping to raise the price, and short positions from outside retail investors were suppressed and forced to swap at higher prices. Soon, it reached over seventeen taels. It was rumored that some longs were swapping out shorts to increase the amount of January contracts. By noon, it returned to normal, around ten taels. As for the January contracts, they opened at 657 taels and closed at 661 taels and five qian. This was converted from the February contracts. According to the rules, there were no more transactions, and they were all converted to February. Almost as soon as the February contracts came on the market, they weakened, remaining within fifty taels. This was due to the rise in the silver market, as well as the impact of the unstable situation. Unfortunately, the swaps were large, and the buying intentions of various firms were excited. As foreign exchange eased and then leveled out, the posted prices remained the same. As a result, the gold market moved quickly, rising ten taels. Later, news suddenly emerged that France intended to use both gold and silver and to mint silver coins to alleviate the market. This caused sentiment to turn negative, and the market suddenly weakened. The future market was particularly weak. Rumors of France increasing troops in Yunnan were spreading, and sellers on the trading floor became more aggressive, almost reaching a point of no return, breaking through forty taels. The total fluctuation for the day was eighteen taels. Overall, the drop was about ten taels or more. However, there was no foreign exchange market, because it was Wednesday.</p>
<p>▲February Contracts Break into Fifty Taels. Since the February contracts opened early at 647 taels, the silver large bars rose slightly by one-sixteenth, and the forward contracts by one-eighth. However, the American silver increased by six-eighths, and the United States was also buying, which had a resulting impact. Because buyers were still active, Yuancheng Yong, Cuichang Yong, Wanfeng Yong, Yifeng, and others all made gains, rising over seven taels, to 654 taels and seven qian. The fluctuations were uneven, numbering three or four taels. Almost as soon as the bills of exchange initially cheapened and then leveled out, American dollars were initially trading at 34.125 yuan, then at 34 yuan. Furthermore, Hong Kong and Shanghai banks were absorbing 11.5 pence. Soon, Yongfeng and Chengfeng Yong came to sell, and the banks were mutually trading English gold at 5625, and American dollars could be settled at 4 yuan, retreating by four taels. When the English gold price was revealed, it remained unchanged, at 650 taels and 0.5 qian. In a short time, Dadecheng and Yuanheng rushed in, along with arbitrageurs, and the China-Belgium bank bought April American dollars at 33.9375 yuan and did the opposite at 34 yuan. At 10:00 AM, it was 657 taels and two qian. Following that, it dropped, declining by five taels. Then, Qianchangxiang, Hongkang Yong, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, Wanxing, and others came to sell, and at 10:20 AM, it was 652 taels and three qian. Before long, the buying momentum suddenly strengthened, and Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, Dakang, Yuancheng Yong, Tongtaichang, and general retail investors calmly competed to buy, and with the swaps raising by sixteen or seventeen taels, to American dollars at 3.875 to 3.8125 yuan, sentiment was boosted, and the market rose. However, from 10:30 to 11:00 AM, there were mutual fluctuations of one or two taels. At 11:15 AM, it was 657 taels and eight qian. Unexpectedly, buyers advanced upwards, and sellers seemed to reverse downwards, and with rumors that France was switching to silver coins and buying large bars, Yuanmaoyong, Bingxing, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Daxingyong, Dadecheng, and others frantically sold, causing the price to collapse, plunging over eight taels, and at 11:45 AM, it was 649 taels. Soon after, the selling subsided, rebounding by over four taels, to 653 taels and five. By the noon closing, it was 652 taels, and then it traded within 650 taels, as arbitrageurs were selling goods, with a posted price of 727 taels, pressing down 77 taels to 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲The After-Market Weakens Further and the Trend is Disorganized. The after-market opened at 651 taels and two qian. Because after the noon closing, Bombay reported a small increase of two annas, and later, Cuichang Yong, Dadecheng, and others sold, and the price went downstream. However, it was chaotic and unstable, hovering between 648 and 649 taels. After 2:45 PM, news suddenly came that France had sent troops to the Yunnan border, and the domestic situation was still not peaceful, causing more fear. Richang, Yuanxing Yong, Tongchun, Yifeng Yong, Dadecheng, commodity firms, and others all had sales, and with Bombay reporting a larger increase of four annas, the gold price suddenly broke through 640 taels. Only around 3:30 PM did it rise and fall by two or three taels. Nearing 4:00 PM, it finally fell to 639 taels and five qian. After that, Yifeng and Tongtaichang bought, and it rose again to 643 taels and five, only to fall back to 639 taels and five qian. In short, sentiment softened, and there were one or two tael fluctuations. By the time the market closed at 4:30 PM, it was 640 taels and eight qian. Suddenly, Tongtaichang and retail investors pulled in, raising it again to over 643 taels, roughly falling by eleven or twelve taels compared to the previous day (excluding the swap). According to the whole day, the highest was 657 taels and eight qian, the lowest was 639 taels and five qian, with a total rebound of 18 taels and three qian. In retrospect, commodity firms opened at 648 taels, noon closed at 639 taels, afternoon at 639 taels and five, and closed at 641 taels. The posted price was 80 to 85 taels. The accounting for the morning was 659 taels for November and December, 662 taels for January, and 652 taels for February. The accounting for the afternoon was 648 taels for November and December, 651 taels for January, and 641 taels for February. The make-up water was 659 taels, and the afternoon was 648 taels. Bare bars (including the swap) increased by fifteen taels.</p>
<p>▲Swaps Have Just Passed, and Trading is Not Large. Trading statistics on the trading floor showed that Tongtaichang, Qunchang Yong, Yuancheng Yong, Yifeng Yong, Dakang, and others all made gains, while Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, Zhifeng Yong, Hongkang Yong, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Daxing Yong, and others all sold. Yuantai, Futai Heng, Qianchangxiang, Yuandayong, and others sometimes sold and sometimes bought. In the afternoon, Yifeng, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Yuanmaoyong, and Zhifeng Yong all made gains, while Wanxing, Cuichang Yong, Xixing Yong, Richang, Dadecheng, and Yuanxing Yong all sold. The purchases and sales of arbitrage contracts were mixed, but there were no large transactions by any firms. And since the swaps had just passed, the Cantonese brokers took in over 1400 contracts, and the Dalian brokers took in 300 to 400 contracts, for a total of over 700 contracts.</p>

As a result, British gold increased by only eighteen and seventy-five hundredths compared to the previous night, and American gold increased by only twenty-five hundredths, due to the slight decline in the exchange rate between the British and American currencies. The standard gold price opened for forward trading in February, but the price was ten taels lower than January's. The trend was weak. It was also rumored that France would mint silver coins to alleviate the financial market situation, leading to a loosening of exchange rates. The gold firms' cashiers had differing opinions. However, as it was Wednesday, the market was only open for half a day in the morning as usual, so trading was not very active. Approximately 100,000 pounds of British gold and 4-5 million dollars of American gold were traded. British American Tobacco and Citibank made some settlements.</p>

<p>▲Market Overview: Yesterday, the silver and money market atmosphere was unusually quiet, due to the trend of the times and the urgency of the situation. Although it was the usual dull period, there was no action to speak of. However, this year's market fatigue was particularly severe due to the commercial resistance against Japan. As for the financial sector's funds being tied up, it was difficult to clear everything up during this chaotic period. It was only possible to cope with it to the best of one's ability. It was impossible to achieve a truly thorough solution in the current situation.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Sudden Rebound in Securities and Public Bonds <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th), the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's bond market saw improved sentiment, with trading activity increasing. Transactions in both the morning and afternoon sessions were lively. The spot market was also active, with many types of transactions. Due to major changes in the political situation and the hope for an early resolution to the issue of domestic peace and unification, market sentiment improved significantly. Although there were no large-scale purchases by major players, small investors took advantage of the low prices to invest, leading to strong demand. Because demand exceeded supply, prices immediately rose upon opening and continued to rise steadily until closing. In the afternoon session, the balance between supply and demand improved slightly, and the trend was more moderate. As a result, except for the Customs Consolidation 96 bonds, which rose by only 4-5 jiao, and the Salt Tax spot bonds, which fell by 1.1 yuan compared to last week, other bonds, such as the 20 Customs and Unified Tax forward bonds for next month, rose by over 3 yuan, and others also rebounded by 1-2 yuan. The sudden rise in bond prices was unprecedented recently. Observing the securities market, the change in the political situation has indeed changed market sentiment. However, the future is still uncertain, and it is not yet possible to be overly optimistic. It will depend on improvements in the political situation and diplomatic landscape. The total spot trading volume for the day was 35,500 yuan, with 399,000 yuan in the morning futures market and 3,055,000 yuan in the afternoon session, totaling 6,345,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market turned firm and relatively stable due to thin bottom stocks. Scattered purchases by the Sichuan merchants continued. However, most retail investors were bearish, due to the precarious state of the country and the exhaustion of finance. Therefore, the market was relatively flat and not very strong. However, the bottom was too dry, and manufacturers were in a bullish position. With a slight opportunity, prices would rise easily and fall with difficulty. However, the chaotic situation was bound to have a significant impact.</p>
<p>▲People's Cotton Marked Up, Excluding Two Exceptions: The People's Cotton market opened with American cotton stable. However, there was a shortage of sellers in the market, and prices rose 4, 5, and 6 qian in each month. In the afternoon, the situation became tighter, and prices rose another 5, 6, 7, and 9 qian to 1 liang in each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,700 bales. Shen Chang sold 600 bales, Yi Da sold 300 bales, Yu Kang sold 400 bales, and He Shen sold 550 bales. Tai Xing bought 600 bales, Sen Kang bought 550 bales, Xin Cheng bought 1,350 bales, and Chang Ji bought 500 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.

<p>The cotton market was strong again, due to the stable trend in American cotton. However, gold prices fell daily, but sentiment remained good. Inventories were not high, and the bottom was withered. There were fewer new sellers, and everyone was cautious. Therefore, market sentiment was firm. However, there were rumors in the market that a large amount of goods had arrived in Hankou. However, most of these goods were purchased by manufacturers. The cotton market, in fact, was extremely flat and lifeless. However, the bulls were tightening their grip and would not let go.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Cotton Slightly Up: The Hankou cotton market opened with a slight rise in American cotton. However, gold prices fell again. There were not many sellers in the market, and prices rose 5 fen to 1 qian in each month. In the afternoon, prices rose another 1-2 qian in each month.

<p>[P Grains: Downturn in the Hexia Rice Market</p>
<p>▲Nantou: Yesterday, sources from various groups were about 20. The port inventory was not weak. Although the account period for urban and rural stores had passed, sales remained sluggish. This was due to the tense situation and weak sentiment. Recently, retail sales have been bleak, and everyone is hesitant. Transactions were slightly lower, and selling intentions were not firm. High-priced Houxin粳 rice was slightly weak, Zhongguan trimmed down nearly a corner, and although the supply of thin稻 rice was not strong, the local demand was limited. Market prices trimmed down by more than one jiao. Sales of foreign杜尖 rice were limited and sporadic, and prices were fixed at a high level and trimmed in the middle.</p>
<p>▲Xinzha: Yesterday, sources were 45-6. The river accumulation was still thick. Store sales were not strong. Only Kunshan rice was traded in the Hexia rice foot price, and there were no transactions for Changzhou-Wuxi Xixin. The market price fell nearly a corner. There was still a lot of thin稻 rice, and transactions were not good, with prices down by one and a half jiao. Bianyin yuan rice was rare, and demand was weak, without honor or disgrace. 8,000 bags of foreign rice arrived yesterday, and sales were not good, with prices gradually loosening.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Foreign Rice Has Not Escaped Its Sluggish State <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions remained sluggish. There were many fixed transactions in the future market, and importers disliked the recently arrived goods and did not accept them. There have been several disputes. Therefore, foreign firms did not dare to sell unlimitedly. Yesterday, Zen Chan and other foreign firms sent telegrams offering sales, but only if the importer had a bank guarantee would they be willing to trade. Therefore, the overall market had no transactions. Round-trip rice included 100 tons of May Xiaojiao weighed goods at a price of 4 liang and 7 qian and a half. Spot goods included 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao handled by local businesses at a price of 9 yuan and a half, and 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon at a price of 11 yuan. Customer groups remained temporarily on the sidelines, and the overall market had no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Flour Market Trending Downward <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market prices for various months were generally stable because the price of foreign wheat rose by 5, 6, and 7 jiao. The distant months were slightly bullish due to the scarcity of sellers. However, due to the unreduced pain of inland customers, buying interest was very weak. When the market opened in the afternoon, the nearby months had to be settled due to delivery reasons. The distant months, however, continued to be sold off by manufacturers, and people's hearts were difficult to cheer up. Opening prices in each session continued to fall. Currently, actual sales are sluggish, and the inventory of spot goods from small and medium-sized factories is accumulating more and more. It is feared that flour prices will collapse in the near future. As a result, the current month fell by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, January fell by 1.5 fen, February fell by 1.25 fen, March fell by 0.5 li, and May fell by 1 fen.</p>

<p>▲The Standard Shows Signs of Initial Stability Followed by Fatigue</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market showed signs of initial stability followed by fatigue. The market was naturally stable in the morning because the price of foreign wheat rose by 4, 5, 6, and 7 jiao. However, it was difficult to rise due to very weak buying interest. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment was flat and tired. Although some manufacturers were preparing to receive goods, the quantity of goods was limited. In the distant months, foreign wheat continued to be active in China due to exchange rate relations. It was also heard that a certain Japanese merchant was impersonating an American merchant to peddle foreign wheat (cheaper by 5 fen than the real British and American merchants). Therefore, people's hearts were restless, and the market turned flat. As a result, the current month fell by a small 3 fen compared to the previous day, January remained unchanged, February fell by a small 2 fen, March fell by a small 1 fen, April remained unchanged, and May improved by 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Goods Fixed Due to Scarcity <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲Downfall of Coarse Sand White Sugar Has Not Ceased</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market communications from the production area indicated that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.09375, the New York sugar futures price for December was 1.05, and for March of next year it was 1.11, each falling back by three points compared to the previous communications. The price for May was 1.14, and for September it was 1.25, each also falling by four points. The current price of Java sugar also lacked rises and falls. Buying interest on the association market was still scarce. The price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar continued to fall, with transactions at 9 liang, 5 qian and a half to 2.5 fen. German Dutch white sugar was 11 liang and 1 qian. The price of No. 20 medium sand white sugar, which was scarce, was quoted at 9 liang and 5 qian, but few were interested. The market atmosphere was dull and lifeless. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 11 liang and 6 qian, and transactions were still strong. Huaxin also offered the same price. Subsequently, because a certain bank sold a small amount, the price was actually 11 liang and 5 qian and a half, and demand gradually became active. The price of CW mark was 11 liang and 5 qian and a half, HX mark was 11 liang and 4 qian and a half, and HM mark was 11 liang and 3 qian and a half. The market shape all appeared stable.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Dried and Sundry Goods: Honey Dates Getting Worse and Worse <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Honey dates are getting worse because most of those who were in this business last year made a profit, and this year's products have increased significantly, so the sources are continuous, and the market price is sometimes in a fatigued decline. Recently, due to money supply issues, there are quite a few people who are desperate to sell for cash. Therefore, the selling price is trending further downstream. Yesterday, the market price of the top-quality Huigong 秃秃 was only 23-4 liang, the price of Lanxi 秃秃 was around 20 liang for higher-quality goods, and the price of miscellaneous brand ordinary 秃秃 was only 16-7 liang. Upper and lower grades still follow the usual practice of adding to the price, and the market situation is flat and tired.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Metals: Galvanized Iron Arriving Frantically, Prices Fatigued <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The continuous cold wind is bone-chilling, and dripping water freezes into ice, causing a major blow to the metal market. The number of people attending tea gatherings is also less than before. The number of goods released is extremely small. Yesterday, there were a few decorations of tinplate and English steel plates, but the market was still sluggish. Lead and tin transactions were more widespread, and prices tended to be cheaper by 1-2 qian. In addition, there were many transactions for other goods, but the market had no ups and downs. The only exception was that during this period of difficult sales, arrivals continued to flow in. Yesterday, the new Taikoo warehouse arrived with more than 8,000 loads of English galvanized iron. Because the industry has thick profits to be made, the standard section downstream is the only way to go. However, once the decline begins, transactions become even smaller. Therefore, future trends are even more difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Sun Ke and Others Scheduled to Proceed to Beijing This Morning <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲ More Than Twenty Committee Members Including Wu, Chen, Zou, and Li to Travel Together</p>
<p>▲ More Than Thirty Guangdong Committee Members Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲ Declaration to Be Changed to Joint Proposals After Review</p>
<p>▲ Wang Jingwei Temporarily Unable to Enter Beijing Due to Illness</p>
<p>Following Jiang's resignation, the Central Government dispatched Mr. He Yaozu as a representative of Chen Mingshu to Shanghai to invite Sun Ke and others to proceed to Beijing. After arriving in Shanghai the night before last, Mr. He, together with Mr. He Yingqin, visited Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Li Wenfan, and Zou Lu around 10 a.m. yesterday to invite the representatives and Central Committee members staying in Shanghai to proceed to Beijing to preside over affairs. Currently, with the exception of Wang Jingwei, who is temporarily unable to enter Beijing due to illness, the remaining five representatives and more than twenty committee members, including Zhao Pilian and Chen Gongbo, are all scheduled to travel to Beijing together via a specially prepared train around 9 a.m. this morning. At the same time, nearly three-quarters of the new and old committee members remaining in Guangdong, totaling more than thirty people, will depart for Shanghai tomorrow, preparing to hold the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing on the 21st of this month. The news from yesterday is recorded below in separate sections.</p>
<p>▲ He and He Visit Guangdong Representatives: After arriving in Shanghai the night before last, He Yaozu, together with He Yingqin, visited Sun Ke and Chen Youren on Moliai Road around 10 a.m. yesterday. Since Mr. He had not met with Mr. Sun for a long time, they had a long talk for about an hour.</p>
<p>Visited Li Wenfan and Zou Lu on Mai'erxi'ai Road, but did not meet them as they were out. Consequently, a card was left to convey the message.</p>
<p>▲ Decision Made to Enter Beijing This Morning: Sun and others, during a banquet at Wu's residence the night before last, discussed with the committee members and decided to proceed to Beijing either last night or this morning. However, a formal decision had not yet been made at that time. Therefore, the committee members nominated six representatives, including Sun and Wu, to be responsible for deliberation. As a result of discussions between Sun, Wu Chaochu, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, Zou Lu, and others around 11 a.m. yesterday, it was decided that they would take the early Beijing-Shanghai train to Beijing at 9 a.m. this morning. Committee members in Shanghai who wished to travel together notified the office in advance yesterday to reserve seats. After the decision was made, Sun and others went to the Zhongxi Sanatorium on Xiafei Road at 10:30 a.m. to visit and bid farewell to Wang.</p>
<p>▲ Railway Bureau Prepares Train for Use: After the Guangdong committee members approved the decision to proceed to Beijing at 9 a.m. this morning, He Yaozu notified the Railway Bureau yesterday afternoon to keep the special train reserved the night before last at the station for use. He also notified the railway guards to have the armored train at the North Station depart ahead of schedule at 8:30 a.m. this morning as a pilot train. The Railway Bureau also dispatched a chief section head to accompany the special train to Beijing to manage the train's operations.</p>
<p>▲ Committee Members Traveling Together This Morning: The Railway Bureau specially prepared several first-class parlor cars and dining cars this morning for the committee members to ride in. It is reported that more than sixty people will travel together with the five representatives, Sun, Wu, Zou, Li, and Chen, including Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai, such as Zhao Pilian, Chen Rulin, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Zeng Zhongming, Gan Naiguang, Bai Yunti, Guo Chuntao, Zhu Jiqing, and Liang Hancao.</p>
<p>▲ Guangdong Committee Members May Arrive Tomorrow: There are still more than thirty new and old committee members from Guangzhou. According to Zou Lu and Li Wenfan, except for a few who will remain in Guangdong, nearly three-quarters of them will depart from Hong Kong for Shanghai tomorrow. However, a formal telegram has not yet been received.</p>
<p>▲ Wang Temporarily Not Entering Beijing Due to Illness: Mr. Wang is currently recuperating in the hospital due to illness. According to those around him, although Mr. Wang's illness is gradually improving, he will not be able to enter Beijing for the time being. It is estimated that the earliest he can go is in two or three days. However, Mr. Wang himself very much hopes to be able to enter Beijing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲ Sun Zhesheng's Talk: Sun Ke decided to go to Beijing this morning and made a statement to reporters yesterday, saying, "I have decided to enter Beijing tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) with Wu Tiyun, Li Wenfan, Zou Haibin, and Chen Youren. However, Mr. Wang will not be able to travel with us immediately due to illness." Mr. Sun further stated, "The term 'political openness' in our talks published in the newspapers today may not be fully understood by the world. I would like to add that the meaning of our so-called political openness is not only in the government, which must announce its policies to the people at all times, but also in opening up political power to the people of the whole country. Given the current national crisis, it is not enough to seek solutions without gathering the public opinion and strength of the people of the whole country. In view of the past evils of political power being concentrated in the hands of a few or one person, this is especially necessary to open up a new path for the future of Chinese politics." As for the methods, there are two: "First, there must be a representative body of the people in the government organization that should be established. Second, all those who bear political responsibility, whether they are political or administrative officials, need not be limited to party members, but should be based primarily on talent. Only in this way can the government become a truly national government capable of shouldering the great responsibility of solving the national crisis, completing political tutelage, and realizing constitutional government." Regarding his views on finance, Mr. Sun said that after the news of Mr. Jiang's resignation was spread, it did not have much impact on the market price of public bonds, which is actually an excellent phenomenon. After the establishment of the new government, it will certainly make every effort to stabilize the foundation of finance and strive to maintain credit. To achieve this goal, the government and the people must work together.</p>
<p>▲ Declaration Changed to Proposal: The joint declaration on the current situation, which was originally drafted by the Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, and others, totaling thirty-one people, was originally scheduled to be revised and published yesterday. Later, because the content of the declaration was not in line with the current situation, it was decided to fundamentally cancel the declaration. However, with regard to various important issues related to party politics and the military in the declaration, it has been decided to change them into joint proposals. According to Zeng Zhongming, the main points are roughly the same as yesterday's joint talks, namely: (1) convening a national salvation conference, (2) respecting public opinion, protecting human rights, and political openness, and (3) implementing peace conference resolutions and various plans.</p>
<p>▲ Zou Haibin's Statement: A reporter from New Voice News met with Mr. Zou Haibin at his residence yesterday and had the following conversation with him: (Q) When will the Guangdong Central Committee members be able to go north? Have you received a report? (A) According to telegrams from comrades in Guangdong, they can depart for Shanghai on the 18th. (Q) After you enter Beijing, how will you proceed with negotiations on the issue with Japan? (A) Based on the resolutions of the peace conference, on the one hand, we will adhere to the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and on the other hand, we will adopt the doctrine of legitimate self-defense and resistance to deal with it. (Q) There was news yesterday that Zhesheng recommended Liu Jiwen as the head of the Ministry of Finance. Is this true? (A) The issue of personnel cannot be discussed at all before the government is reorganized, and I know that this statement is completely a rumor and is not true at all.</p>
<p>▲ Student Groups Farewell: Yesterday, the Shanghai University Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, the Middle School Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, and others believed that the Guangdong representatives had promoted peace and unity this time, and that their entry into Beijing was a true expression of national unity. Therefore, they specially sent representatives to the Guangdong Representative Office to discuss and prepare to go to the station to bid farewell this morning when the entire body of Guangdong Central Committee members set off for Beijing.</p>
<p>▲ Labor Union Urges Entry into Beijing: The Seamen's Federation sent a telegram saying: "To all newspapers, please note: We have recently sent a telegram to the representatives of the Ning-Guang Peace Conference, which reads: 'To Mr. Zi Min, Pu Quan, Zhen Ru, Shi Ceng, Tie Cheng, Jingwei, Zhesheng, Tiyun, Junpei, Youren, Haibin, and Mr. Hu Zhantang, as well as all Central Committee members: In recent years, China's political phenomena have been chaotic and turbulent, without tranquility, causing all comrades in the party to wander down divergent paths, resulting in a fragmented situation. The people of the whole country are groaning in pain, trapped in deep water and scorching fire. Recently, the Eastern Province has been lost, and the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. Since the convening of the Peace Conference, all reform plans of the ruling authorities are fundamental plans for internal stability and external resistance, and essential plans for democratic politics. They are the earnest expectations of the people of the whole country, striving for realization. Recently, after reading Chairman Jiang's telegram for deletion, in order to seek party-state unity and early realization, he resigned according to his promise. Since then, domestic peace has reached a period of development, and party unity has entered a bright path. The various political reform plans of the previous Peace Conference have already been decided by you, and we hope that they will be specifically realized later, so that national construction can be laid, democratic politics can be completed, and our suffering people can be slightly comforted. Please summon all Central Committee members from Shanghai and Guangdong to go straight to Beijing immediately to hold the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, decide on the national construction plan for internal stability and external resistance, so that all past disputes can be eliminated, and the party-state's future can be revitalized. Our association is willing to lead all seamen to support the resolution, consistently and unswervingly. Later, we will do our best to promote its realization. This is the pivot of the party-state's survival, and it is also what the people of the whole country expect. Urgent words, please note. Prepared by the Organizing Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union.'"</p>

<p>The Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Comrades Association sent a telegram, saying: "To all party departments at all levels across the country, all generals, all schools, all organizations, and all newspapers: The Premier of our party personally founded the Whampoa Military Academy, painstakingly and painstakingly, with the purpose of creating revolutionary armed forces and vanguards of the people to eliminate the remnants of feudal warlords internally and to defeat imperialist aggression externally. Since the Northern Expedition, our Whampoa martyrs have fought bravely, killing enemies and achieving success, piercing their chests and breaking their arms to repay the party and the country, which can comfort the spirit of our Premier in heaven and not disappoint the earnest expectations of the people of the country. Unfortunately, the Northern Expedition was completed and the revolution was interrupted. Individual dictatorship, national crisis, and party division caused grief and indignation among the people of the whole country. We comrades were influenced by the revolution and stimulated by the times, and we still have a purpose and dare not be complacent. Therefore, under the guidance of Mr. Wang Jingwei and other revolutionary leaders in the eighteenth year, we have the organization of the Whampoa Military Academy Revolutionary Comrades Association, uniting revolutionary classmates, vowing to fight to overthrow the dictatorship and realize people's livelihood, running north and south, and shouting and persevering for several years. Although some people have been killed and some have been imprisoned, our hearts and aspirations have never been slackened. Now, the authorities, in view of the increasing foreign troubles and the danger of the national situation, strive for peace and selflessly retire, and from then on, all disputes of the past party-state will be easily resolved, and the democratic politics that we have been demanding day and night can be realized. When the news came, we were immensely pleased. We especially hope that all comrades and compatriots across the country will unite in spirit on the day of the national crisis, unite to resist foreign aggression, and maintain peace forever to solve the people's distress and establish the country in peace. Then the sacrifices we have suffered over the years and the dangers we have experienced can be slightly comforted. Sincere words, please note.

<p>▲ Three Telegrams Have Been Sent</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Association believed that the Executive Yuan's State Council's resolution to reorganize the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces was a warning shot, and that active-duty soldiers were not allowed to concurrently serve as provincial chairmen, which had already been resolved by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. However, the government appointed Lu Diping as the head of the provincial government. Yesterday, the association specially telegraphed Nanjing Chairman Lin and President Chen to express their determination not to recognize it, and also telegraphed Hangzhou Chairman Zhang Nanxian, asking him not to hand over power, and telegraphed the Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, and the Student Federation, asking them to strongly prevent Chairman Zhang from handing over power.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Japan's Foreign Trade <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram received from the Japanese Commercial Affairs Counselor's Office in this city, Japan's foreign trade in the first eleven months of this year was worth 2,188,000,000 yen, of which exports were worth 1,064,000,000 yen and imports were worth 1,124,000,000 yen, with a trade deficit of 60,000,000 yen.

In addition, Japan's exports to China were severely affected due to the Liaoning case. In the first eleven months, they were only worth 246,000,000 yen, a decrease of 34 percent compared with the same period last year. Imports of Chinese goods also decreased by 18 percent. However, compared with imports and exports, there was still a trade surplus of 30,000,000 yen (which means a trade deficit from our country's perspective), which has decreased by 7,000,000 yen compared with the same period last year. During the eleven months, Japanese gold exports to the United States and other places totaled 337,000,000 yen, an increase of 35,000,000 yen compared with the same period last year.</p>

<p>▲ A Telegram Sent to Wang Jingwei and Others</p>
<p>Deng Guowei and others sent a telegram yesterday, saying: "To National Government Member Wang, Guangdong representatives, Commander Zhang of the Fourth Army of the Fourth Group Army of the National Revolutionary Army, and the Shanghai Municipal Federation National Salvation Volunteer Army: Ever since the Japanese invaders entered the Northeast and occupied Liaoning and Jilin, the border defense generals have adopted a non-resistance policy, sitting idly by and watching the fall. The central officials have used a calm attitude to suppress public opinion, causing the Japanese bandits to gain an inch and want a mile, and to launch a large-scale attack on Heilongjiang Province. Fortunately, our General Ma Zhanshan resisted the majority with the minority and fought for the country, fighting bloody battles. The Central Government and the Northeast have not seen a single soldier to provide assistance. Fortunately, Commander Zhang Xianghua telegraphed twice to ask for permission to go straight to aid, which was greatly welcomed. He is worthy of the Iron Army's history and is truly a model of the revolution. After hearing this, we deeply admire him. Although we, Guowei and others, are unlearned and unskilled, we have a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country, and we dare not lag behind in sacrificing ourselves to save the country. Therefore, we have consulted with Li Yue, a military liaison officer of the Military Committee of the National Government, and have gathered 8,000 able-bodied men from Tongzhou, Kunshan Huangdu, Yixing, Liyang, Changzhou, and other places, and have temporarily organized them into a volunteer army. We still ask Comrade Li Yue to command them, under the command of Commander Zhang, to set off to conquer Japan in order to save the party-state from danger and promote the realization of democracy. Waiting for orders, we are deeply concerned. Deng Guowei, Xu Yitong, Liu Ziwei, Zhang Dan, Zhang Yi, Shao Shounan, Pan Gang, Li Ren, Xie Mo, and Cao Weiqia bow together."</p>

<p>Ye Huijun and Zheng Chengqing, executive committee members of the Anti-Japanese Association in this city, both sent letters to the association yesterday to resign. The original letters are as follows: (Ye Huijun's letter) "Dear Sirs: Since I have been serving as a committee member, I have been old and frail and unable to do anything.

Sincerely, Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association." (Zheng Chengqing's letter) "Dear Sirs: I was elected as a member of this association and concurrently served as an inspector. Since the change from anti-Japanese aid to overseas Chinese to anti-Japanese national salvation, I have been measuring my abilities and finding them weak and insufficient to assume heavy responsibilities. However, due to public justice, I勉竭　鈍,努力追隨. For several months, I have been painstakingly pondering, running around and planning. Although I have tried my best to endure hardship and resentment, I have not been able to contribute even a drop to the ocean. I deeply regret this and am unable to do anything. I have no choice but to resign from all my positions, and I respectfully hope that you will grant me approval.

<h3 id="e136">Japanese Naval Training Squadron Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲ Asami and Iwate Entered the Port Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>▲ Carrying 187 Officers, Soldiers, and Students</p>
<p>▲ Will Conduct Practical Exercises at Sea</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of the Navy dispatched the training ships Asami and Iwate, carrying 154 naval officers and students, to Shanghai to demonstrate their strength. They entered the port yesterday afternoon and berthed in the Huangpu River. Japanese officials and civilians in this city have been hosting banquets for the soldiers and students and visiting the city. The details are recorded below in separate sections:</p>
<p>▲ Two Ships Arrive in Shanghai: The Japanese naval training ships Asami and Iwate, each with a displacement of 9,800 tons, arrived from Japan carrying 154 naval officers and second lieutenant candidates, led by Vice Admiral Imai Shintaro and Staff Officer Nomura Tomekichi. The two ships have 32 naval officers. They arrived in Wusong yesterday morning, and Commander Imai telegraphed the Shanghai First Overseas Dispatch Team. Around 9 a.m., the Shanghai-based naval landing force dispatched Major Kuwahara and others to Wusong to greet them. At 4 p.m., the Asami and Iwate sailed from Wusong to the Huangpu River. The Iwate berthed in front of the Japanese Consulate, while the Asami berthed at the Osaka Shosen Wharf. When the two ships arrived at the port, Japanese officials and civilians in Shanghai went to the wharf to welcome them.</p>
<p>▲ Banquets for Officers and Soldiers: Yesterday afternoon, after the Asami and Iwate arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai President of Nissin Company, Yonezato Monji, first hosted the naval officers, soldiers, and students on the ships. Mr. Yonezato, representing all Japanese merchants in Shanghai, reported on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations. That night, the Japanese Navy First Overseas Dispatch Team stationed in Shanghai held a banquet at the Japanese Club in Hongkou to entertain the leading officers of the two ships. At noon today, the Japanese residents of Shanghai will host a public banquet for the naval students of the two ships. In the evening, Ambassador Shigemitsu and Consul Murai will host a public banquet. On the 18th, Iwate Captain Okada Tsubaki will represent Commander Imai in hosting Shanghai's Japanese officials and civilians. In the evening, the Shanghai Japanese community will hold a special welcome party to welcome the naval officers in the two ships.</p>
<p>▲ Officers and Soldiers Tour: The 154 students on the two ships will go ashore in two groups today and tomorrow to tour the entire city of Shanghai and can freely enter the market to purchase items. As for the naval sailors serving in the Asami and Iwate, due to their duties, they will tour Shanghai on the 17th, 18th, and 19th for three days. At 5 p.m. on the 19th, regardless of rank, all officers and students must return to the ship.</p>
<p>▲ Staying in Shanghai for Four Days: This time, the Japanese naval training ship is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for four days. It entered the port on the afternoon of the 16th and must set sail from Shanghai at 6 a.m. on the 20th to head directly to the Sasebo Naval Port in Japan.

<p>The 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 15th, 16th, 26th, and 30th district branches of the Shanghai Municipal Federation wholeheartedly support the ten major propositions of the Party Affairs Improvement Association, which are in line with the will of the people, so that an improved atmosphere can be manifested as soon as possible, and they specially solemnly issued a declaration, which reads: "The party-state is founded, political tutelage is carried out, reforms are renewed, and the party leads. The democratic political system is the will of the people, and the people's movement is prosperous, so the country will be strong. Mr. Wang Jingwei advocates the realization of democratic politics, which is the expectation of the whole country. At this time of the party-state's revival, Shanghai's party affairs are attracting attention at home and abroad, and are related to the whole country. Since the municipal party department has been used by a group of people who are operating for party interests and using the sacred name of the party as a cover for their corruption and deterioration, colluding with shameless people, suppressing public opinion, and coercing, binding, and insulting students, causing a tragedy, the whole country has been indignant since the incident. In the past, such as destroying commercial transportation and stopping group activities, they have used every means. The majority of Qingbai comrades in Shanghai know that party affairs are corrupt and must be unbearable to be with, how can they stand within the Shanghai party affairs line again? Hearing that the establishment of the Municipal Party Affairs Improvement Association sincerely sees the publication of the ten major propositions for improving party affairs in accordance with public opinion, the news came, and all of them gave their full support and agreed to implement them quickly, in order to develop the foundation for the party-ruling country and promote the national spirit. Our association, etc., is one of the mass organizations, and whoever can conform to public opinion, no matter who is in the party or government, will be vowed to support and assist, otherwise we will fight together and not care about any sacrifice. At a time when anti-Japanese national salvation is urgent, at this critical moment for the survival of the country, we hope that the whole country will unite as one, remove the filth and renovate, unite to resist regret, and look forward to the masses working hard and striving forward. This is our declaration."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Chen Youren's Further Account of His Trip to Japan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The New Voice Society reports: The Cantonese representative Chen Youren, due to the considerable discrepancies in the previous reports regarding his trip to Japan, and deeply concerned that colleagues might be misled, has specially written a detailed account of his trip to Japan to inform the nation. The original text is recorded below: When Youren took office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, his first task was to plan a diplomatic policy for the National Government, to meet the demands of the times and fulfill the mission of the Guangzhou National Government. Having considered the matter, Youren dares to assert that in the fifteen or sixteen years of the Wuhan era, the focus of diplomacy was on the issue of unequal treaties. Now, the struggle between revolutionary forces and imperialism has shifted from a general nature to specific issues. Therefore, today's diplomatic focus has shifted to the issue of Sino-Japanese relations, especially the issue of the so-called Three Eastern Provinces. Youren makes this judgment based on the following reasons: (1) The history of the past twenty years shows that Japan is a major cause of the instability of our country's successive regimes. The Japanese warlords differ greatly in their view of China from the modern Japan represented by Shidehara. They believe that if China is not friendly with Japan, then for Japan's sake, China should be kept in a state of turmoil. This misconception will plunge China into catastrophe. It must be understood that without a period of relative tranquility, no government can establish new systems as the foundation for a new Chinese nation and a new government. Only with a new nation and a new government (in other words, transforming the old-style Chinese nation into a modern nation) can China be saved from danger and continue to exist, so that it can become an independent party-ruled nation based on the Three Principles of the People. (2) The Nanjing government has never had a definite policy towards Japan, only knowing how to use the delaying tactics of the Beijing bureaucratic era. For a country with incomplete military strength to adopt such tactics to deal with a powerful neighbor with abundant military force, the result will inevitably be a miserable defeat. Under these circumstances, in order to turn danger into safety, one cannot but recall the legacy of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, who sought to create a situation of equality and amity between China and Japan in order to eliminate the habits of suspicion and encroachment. The late Premier, with his foresight, believed that the peace of East Asia, which is related to the world, depends on the two countries of China and Japan, just as the peace of Europe depends on the two countries of Germany and France. The National Government, in order to explore the possibility of realizing a new policy with this kind of meaning and this kind of trend, ordered Youren to personally visit Japan in the summer of this year. Before setting off for Japan, Youren submitted a summary to the National Government. The mission given to Youren by the National Government was the same as the summary submitted. The summary is excerpted below: "Youren's visit to Tokyo to meet Shidehara will imply a new impression, letting them know that the National Government is about to entrust someone who can represent modern Chinese thought to engage in fair discussions, and to test whether there is a possible opportunity to re-establish equal international relations between China and Japan. In this exploration, Youren should first warn the Japanese authorities that no matter how the Sino-Japanese issue is resolved, there is absolutely no room for consideration if it actually contains the meaning of annexing the Three Eastern Provinces. Even if it is done gradually under the pretext of economic interests or special interests, it is also opposed. Therefore, economic rights and special interests must not be arbitrarily misinterpreted by ambitious people. This fundamental prospect in future explorations should be solemnly declared. "Secondly, it should be declared that due to the difficulty in dealing with Sino-Japanese issues, any agreement will not take effect unless it is recognized by the people. Because matters of such great importance to the Chinese nation, if lacking the participation of public opinion, are unlikely to avoid reactions. The result of this is that the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people will incite boycotts and strikes. Furthermore, the government or individuals who conclude the treaty will inevitably become enemies of the whole country. For example, the Nishihara Loans of Duan Qirui's Anfu government are criticized and unforgivable. This fundamental premise in future explorations should be solemnly declared. "Regarding the true meaning of the latter point, in detail, it means that if the National Government is to revise international relations with Japan, it must be authorized by the people before starting negotiations. The proper procedure is to first conduct factual investigations and then use the research results to formulate strategies to form the part of the future government's major policy concerning foreign policy, declare it to the public, and wait for the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang on Double Ten Day to adopt it before it becomes final. "This kind of foreign policy must be approved by the Congress before it can be implemented. This is the inevitable path of democratic politics." When Youren was preparing to travel to the east, it happened that the Wanbaoshan Incident in Jilin and the anti-Chinese riots in Korea occurred. Some people thought that because public sentiment was high and anti-Japanese feelings were prevalent, it was better to wait temporarily to avoid suspicion. However, Youren believed that the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang on Double Ten Day was imminent, so it was necessary to decide on our country's policy towards Japan as soon as possible. The trip to Japan could not be delayed. At that time, in order to avoid misunderstandings, he tried to remain calm. He did not expect that rumors would arise on the day he arrived in Tokyo. After Youren arrived in Tokyo, he immediately visited Foreign Minister Shidehara to exchange opinions. The main points of his conversation regarding the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces have been roughly described in the protest telegram to Foreign Minister Shidehara published on September 25. An excerpt is quoted below: "Recently, I visited Tokyo in a private capacity and had the opportunity to meet with you. I have always said that Sino-Japanese relations have not been satisfactory for decades, and the late Premier's legacy is that Sino-Japanese culture has many similarities, so the relations between the two countries should be based on a new situation of equality and friendship, and the past habits of suspicion and misunderstanding should be eliminated. I think the time has come to arouse our people to study this new idea. I solemnly declared at the time that if any future Chinese government uses any method to solve the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces that would actually make Japan annex the Three Eastern Provinces, our people, or popular organizations, or our government will absolutely deny it. Furthermore, I also solemnly declared that the solution to this problem will not be effective or realized unless it is unanimously approved by the people of our country. And I expressed to you that in order to obtain this kind of approval, the solution conditions must be submitted to the National Assembly for a vote. You replied that the Japanese government has absolutely no intention of annexing the Three Eastern Provinces, and said that if necessary, your government is willing to reaffirm that the Three Eastern Provinces are the territory of the Republic of China, and Japan has no intention of infringing on China's sovereignty over the territory of the Three Eastern Provinces. Afterwards, I had conversations with people from other quarters in Tokyo, and the main points were the same. At that time, I speculated that regarding the crux of the Sino-Japanese issue, you seemed to have explained the psychology of the Japanese authorities. In short, Youren went to Japan to inquire with Foreign Minister Shidehara about the Japanese government's true intentions and policies towards China, especially regarding the Three Eastern Provinces. The reason why the National Government wanted to find out Japan's intentions was to determine whether the policy left by the late Premier could now be implemented. The late Premier had great foresight and once showed us the way to lead the country to peace and prosperity. Youren has never been ordered to negotiate with Shidehara or other Japanese, and in fact, he has not negotiated with any Japanese on the Three Eastern Provinces or other issues. Therefore, rumors circulating outside, saying that Youren's trip to Japan was secretive, or suspecting that he was buying foreign weapons, or suspecting that he was borrowing money from Japan, or even suspecting that he had reached an agreement on the issue of the Three Eastern Provinces, are far-fetched and absurd, and belong to groundless fabrications. It is believed that a certain aspect of propaganda is at play. The current situation is greatly worse than when Youren went to Japan. The Eastern Provinces are in a critical autumn, and the people are in deep water and hot fire. The anti-violent Japanese sentiment of the people across the country is rising day by day. At this time, if we still meticulously measure whether the late Premier's new policy has a chance to be implemented, it is very impractical. If we want to improve the situation, we can only wait for another day.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Resignation Telegram from All Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Municipal Party Headquarters <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The original telegram of resignation from all executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Party Headquarters reads: To the esteemed Central Executive Committee of Nanjing, since the fall of the Eastern Provinces, the whole country has been united in hatred, and the people's indignation has reached its peak. If we can guide them well, so that the goals are consistent and the direction is the same, then it is possible to wipe out the shame and resist foreign aggression. Adversity builds nations, and its practical effect can be seen. Therefore, the Association advocated the idea of resisting Japan and saving the country, showing the goals and clarifying the boundaries, and first telegraphed to the esteemed Association to lead the people in a final self-defense, so as to concentrate the strength of the whole country and develop the spirit of foreign resistance. In the past two months, it has been working hard to support and guide the people's patriotic movement, and has not dared to slacken day and night. Therefore, within less than ten days, this kind of organization has sprung up and spread across the country. Economic severance has gradually become effective, and diplomatic support has become stronger day by day. Unfortunately, reactionary elements have seized the opportunity to stir up trouble, and ambitious politicians have been thinking of using it. Some have raised slogans to shift its direction, and some have expanded the scope to change its nature. Therefore, they only care about demonstrations, and seem to be increasingly focused on resisting Japan and saving the country, as if delaying the plan. There are even various fallacies such as overthrowing the government and seizing power. Although the Association has tried to correct it in many ways and persuaded it in every possible way, it is difficult to achieve effective results once a few people make noise. This time, the university students were instigated by a few red bandits and suddenly destroyed the party headquarters, thinking it was the beginning of creating red terror. The military turned a blind eye, and the municipal government was even more at a loss. They allowed the wild nature of the people to open up the evil example of overstepping their authority. The arrest and investigation were carried out at will, the power was turned upside down, and the law and discipline were lost. In terms of party rule, the party headquarters can be destroyed by anyone. In terms of the rule of law, the government can be threatened by anyone. As a result, the Communists ran rampant in the city, and the mayor was openly kidnapped. In a prosperous city, it almost became a state of no government. Thinking about the past, I can't help but feel cold. Now that the party headquarters has no guarantee, the work will inevitably be more difficult. I have no choice but to resign collectively to open up the road. I respectfully ask for approval. I am extremely grateful. Sincerely, the entire executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Special Municipality. Yuan Yin.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government held a hygiene movement in Chenxing County, the fifth district of Pudong, the day before yesterday. Members of the County Party Headquarters, heads of various bureaus in the county, heads of various districts, heads of various public security sub-bureaus, as well as people from all walks of life and students from various schools, totaling hundreds of people, gathered in the open space of the district office at noon. County Magistrate Yan presided over the meeting and immediately reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, the heads of various bureaus gave speeches on the significance of the hygiene movement. Subsequently, County Magistrate Yan and the heads of various agencies, each holding brooms, lined up and paraded in Chenxing Town, holding a major cleaning, awakening the public to pay attention to hygiene, and posting hygiene slogans all over the town, which was quite a grand occasion for a while. County Magistrate Yan also took the opportunity to accompany Yao Fusheng, the chief of the Public Security Section, to the fifth sub-bureau of the County Public Security Bureau in the town and the fourth sub-bureau in Sanlin Town to inspect everything and give instructions on defense matters. Later, he also visited Sanlin Town to inspect the street construction project that was under construction in the town. By the time Yan and others crossed the Huangpu River and returned to the city, it was already evening.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The False Regiment Commander Under Taibao Ashu Was Arrested <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲ Captured on the Tram</p>
<p>▲ Approved to Be Taken Away by the Water Police</p>
<p>The bandit Jin Sida, also known as Shen Chunrong, is twenty-four years old. He used to serve as the false second regiment commander under the notorious lake bandit Taibao Ashu Xu Tianxiong, who was captured and executed. He escaped the dragnet and remained at large. In August of this year, he colluded with Wei Hongxiang, who has now been captured and executed, and others to kidnap the villager Shen Hanpei in Tangkou, a place in Songjiang County, demanding a ransom. After the incident was exposed, he fled to Shanghai and changed his name to Shen Chunrong. The authorities have been trying to arrest him without success. At 5:00 PM on the 15th of this month, Jin boarded the Route 18 trolleybus at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. He happened to be spotted and arrested by Pan Laifu and Xi Boqi, two police officers from the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team who were sent to Shanghai to investigate. They reported to the police station, and special agent Zhang Ziying was dispatched to arrest Jin and detain him in the police station. He also reported to Lou Ziyun, the captain of the Third Team of the First District of the Water Police in Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, in this city, to prepare a document for transfer. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Jin to the First Tribunal of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Ge Zhitan held a court session to interrogate him. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case, and then Lou Ziyun, the captain of the Jiangsu Water Police Team, and Luo Daokun, the superintendent, surrendered themselves, submitted official documents, and requested a transfer, stating the defendant's criminal circumstances. When asked, Jin Sida confessed that his real name was Shen Chunrong, and denied that he was a bandit who kidnapped and robbed, and the rest of his confession was evasive. After verifying the confession, Judge Ge announced that the defendant was approved to be taken away by the visitors to be tried in the case.</p>

<p>▲ Yao Jusheng's Whereabouts Are Still Unknown</p>
<p>Yao Jusheng, the eight-year-old son of the widow Yao Gu, was kidnapped by bandits in front of his grandmother's house at 96 Annan Road on July 7 of this year and a ransom was demanded by letter. The Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested Zhu Songlin from Pudong and suspects Yao Zhusheng and Lu Wu, etc., and sent them to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. However, it is still questionable whether the hostage Yao Jusheng was drowned at the bottom of the river or is still alive. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the verdict of this case arrived. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang and the defendant Yao Zhusheng's lawyer Tao Wuzhi also appeared in court. The presiding judge Wu Tingqi announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court. The main text reads: Zhu Songlin is sentenced to death for the crime of jointly kidnapping and demanding a ransom, and the rest of the charges are not guilty. The thirteen letters of Zhu Songlin are confiscated, Yao Zhusheng is not guilty, and Lu Wang's trial proceedings are suspended.</p>

<h3 id="e146">The Datong Steamer Returns to Shanghai After the Fire, Having Gone to Rescue <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>▲More Chuheng Steamer Dispatched to Handle the Aftermath</p>
<p>After the Datong Steamer of the Dadah Company of this port was destroyed by fire at Qiwangsha in Hupu, more rescued passengers arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Dayu Steamer, which the company sent to rescue them the day before, has returned to Shanghai to report. The company dispatched the Chuheng Steamer today to handle the aftermath. The various circumstances are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲The Dayu Arrives in Shanghai. The Dayu Steamer, which the company dispatched for rescue, arrived in Shanghai at 1 PM yesterday and docked at the Dadah Wharf at the 16th Pier. According to the report, the Dayu arrived at the scene of the accident at 10 AM on the 14th and saw that the flames of the Datong had not yet been extinguished, with only the hull remaining. There were no passengers or crew members on the beach, and it was impossible to approach. It changed course to Tongyang, leaving the Chuyuan Steamer to handle the aftermath and engage in salvaging corpses. Today, passing through the area, the fire had been extinguished, and the Chuyuan was still trying to retrieve the corpses.</p>
<p>▲Rescued Arrive in Shanghai. The company received a telegram from the port at 4 AM yesterday stating, "Benhe Xiangtan has disembarked sixty-seven people at the port." When the Dayu Steamer arrived in Shanghai, it carried eight rescued crew members. More than ten passengers arrived in Shanghai by train from Kunshan. According to reports, there are still more than two hundred rescued passengers in Hupu. In this fire of the Datong Steamer, most of the senior passengers in the dining hall were buried in the flames.</p>
<p>▲The Chuheng Sets Sail. The company's board of directors, in addition to sending Zhu Xiaozhu and others to establish a post-disaster office in Hupu to salvage corpses and care for the rescued passengers and crew members, decided to dispatch the Chuheng Steamer again to the scene of the accident this morning to assist the Chuyuan in retrieving corpses and trying to tow back the hull of the Datong.</p>
<p>▲Corpses Retrieved. Among the passengers rescued and brought to Shanghai by the Yu Yusheng sand barge the day before, the seven men and one woman who had frozen to death have been photographed by the Lifesaving Bureau for claiming. A woman named Huang Li, was claimed yesterday by her son, Huang Yulin, and the Tongru Chonghai Qi Township Association will transport her coffin to Yangzhou on the Dahe Steamer. The company received telegrams informing them that one corpse each was retrieved from the river at Niuhonggang and Hutonggang, and immediately telegraphed the Guangxiang Steamer to pick them up on its return to Shanghai for claiming.</p>
<p>▲Fellow Townsmen's Telegram Complaint. The Tongru natives in Shanghai telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, "Minister Wang Jun of the Ministry of Communications of the Nanjing National Government, the Datong Steamer of the Dadah Steamer Company of this port was burned on the Jiangmian River surface of Qiwangsha in Hupu at approximately 11 AM on the 13th of this month due to negligence in the cargo hold. Hundreds of passengers died. Such a catastrophe is unprecedented. Upon investigation, in March of this year, the Daji Steamer of the company was burned at the Longjusha River surface in Xingang due to the loading of explosive materials. The tragic case has not yet been resolved. The company still does not take precautions, loading cargo and passengers beyond the prescribed limits, and the firefighting equipment is largely dilapidated, resulting in another strange incident. Its neglect of business and disregard for human life is evident. Investigating the cause, all are due to the company's manager, Bao Xinzai, and others employing the wrong people, illegally profiting, and recklessly disregarding the consequences. We, Fubao, and others, being from Jiangbei, travel frequently and have family ties with the families of those who have suffered in the past. In addition to gathering efforts to rush to rescue, we urgently telegram you to request a review and decision, strictly ordering the company to bear all responsibility for this tragic disaster and ordering it to suspend operations pending legal action to value human life and quell grievances. In addition to submitting a detailed separate presentation, we first telegram the complaint. Please review and decide. Tong Rugaohai natives in Shanghai, Lu Fubao, Gao Daoyuan, Bao Junjian, Fan Jingwu, Yuan Zexian, Zhou Zhijun, and three hundred and twenty-four others kowtow together."</p>
<p>▲Inquiry About Submerged Corpses. The Guonan Society said, "Shen Zhuowu, the owner of the China Evening News, accompanied his mother-in-law and several relatives on the Datong Steamer back to Rugao. After the news of the fire on the Datong reached Shanghai, Shen's family searched for news everywhere and sent people from the China Evening News to search along the river in Changshu and Nantong. To date, four days have passed with no news. According to his relatives, if Mr. Shen was rescued, he would have found a way to telegram Shanghai to comfort his family, but now they are waiting in vain, fearing the worst. According to someone who came to Shanghai with news, they saw Mr. Shen holding a life preserver, jumping into the river during the fire. What happened after that is unknown. As for the female relatives traveling with Mr. Shen, it is said that they were indeed buried in the flames and could not escape." The Tongru Chonghai Qi Five Counties Natives Association in Shanghai, yesterday announced a reward for news of Mr. Shen Zhuowu, a standing committee member of the association, who took the Dadah Company's Datong Steamer back to his hometown on the 12th of this month for official business. Unexpectedly, the ship was destroyed in the Changshu River area on the 13th. It has been four days, and Mr. Shen's life and death are unknown.

<h3 id="e151">Crisis of Chinese Businesses Changing to Foreign Title Deeds <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>▲Foreign Affairs Department Should Be Requested to Amend the Yangjingbang Regulations</p>
<p>Li Bohan of the Shanghai Real Estate Association, recently expressed his opinion on Shanghai Chinese businesses changing to foreign title deeds, "Shanghai foreign title deeds originated in 1845 with the establishment of the Yangjingbang Real Estate Regulations. Merchants who want to lease land must negotiate with the Chinese owners who hold the Fangdan to reach an agreement, sign a permanent lease with the location and address, which is transferred by the consulate to the Shanghai Daotai for verification and approval, and returned to the holder, called Daodi. Later, Chinese who wanted to buy real estate also entrusted foreign merchants to obtain title deeds, and then the foreign merchant issued a letter of trust, stating that a certain Chinese entrusted him to register, called Quanbingdan. This kind of deformed title deed is rare in various countries and has been used for decades. Recently, it has become more serious, so that only about 50 mu of land in the concession have not been transferred to title deeds, and most of those who hold title deeds are Chinese. It is regrettable that Chinese pay a large amount of donations, but increase the tax amount of foreign merchants, having responsibility but no rights. As for its disadvantages, to put it mildly, unscrupulous foreign merchants often steal and sell the property entrusted to them by Chinese, and there is no way to pursue them. To put it more seriously, if any foreign merchant country has a severance of diplomatic relations or similar with China, the foreign merchant title deeds of that country will be confiscated or returned, then the Chinese who entrust registration will suffer a loss of land rights. In peacetime, Chinese owners regard title deeds as the most reliable, and there may be a day when they are at a loss. This kind of deformed title deed held by Chinese is caused by the unequal treaties signed under duress at that time, and there is no room for existence in principle. At present, the only way to improve the situation is to refer to suitable methods and ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate and amend Articles 3 and 5 of the Yangjingbang Regulations. This is the most important plan."</p>

<p>Li Songxi Accused of False Accusation</p>
<p>Li Songxi, a native of Zhuanqiao in this county, reported to the French police detective on the evening of the 30th of last month, saying that a fellow villager, Sheng Ayou, conspired to make money and kill someone in the countryside on the evening of the 24th of December of last year, pushing a cotton merchant into the river and drowning him, and robbing him of more than 4,000 yuan in cash and escaping. The official authorities searched for him without success. He is now hiding at No. 27 Aiduya Road, etc. The detective arrested Sheng, and after searching his body, found three gold rings and 60 yuan in banknotes, and brought him into the police station, ordering Li to issue a false accusation and interrogating him. Sheng was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is already noted that the police station has found that Li's accusation is false and requested that Li be detained. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhizhi came to the First Tribunal to continue the trial. The official said to Li, "Now, according to the Zhuanqiao Security Corps' reply, there was no case of conspiring to make money and kill someone. On what basis did you accuse him?" Li replied that he heard villagers in Shanghai say that Sheng Ayou had committed the crime, so he could accuse him. The official asked again, "Do you have two other names, Li Dadi and Li Jingchun?" He replied, "My real name is Li Songxi." The official also asked, "Today's newspaper says that Ye Shunxing and Ni Guifang are suing you in the local court for luring and abducting two women. Why didn't you appear in court for trial? Now the local court has issued a document to summon you." He replied, "The abduction case is unjust. My wife appeared in court and was sentenced to seven months." The official asked, "Has Sheng Ayou ever committed a theft?" He replied, "I dare not commit a crime here." Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, said that it is now found that the accuser has made a false accusation, and the police station will file another lawsuit. Judge Ge then instructed to postpone the investigation and interrogation. Li Songxi and Sheng Ayou were returned to custody.</p>

<p>▲Where is Shi Yun'e?</p>
<p>▲Ma Yinhui's Handwriting Can Be Checked</p>
<p>Shi Yun'e, a native of Shaoxing, is 36 years old and engaged in the coal business. He lives at No. 16 Xingju Lane, Shangchuan Guild Hall, Nanshi. Ma Yinhui, a fellow townsman whom he had known for a long time, is 32 years old and often came to Shi's house and chatted with Shi's wife. Shi thought they were just friends, so he did not suspect anything else. Unexpectedly, on April 15 of this year, Shi's wife suddenly disappeared, and Ma also stopped coming to Shi's house. Shi became suspicious and learned that his wife had indeed been abducted and hidden by Ma. However, the location where she was hidden was still difficult to find out. He hired people to inquire everywhere for several months, but to no avail. Until recently, he suddenly received a postal letter, knowing that it was sent by his wife from his hometown. He immediately opened it and read it. The main content said that because she was tired of life, she boarded a ship and committed suicide by throwing herself into the sea on a certain day to end her life. She hoped that her husband would not be sad, so that she would not be able to rest in peace in the afterlife, etc. Shi was heartbroken when he heard this bad news. After reading the handwriting of the letter carefully, he found that it was written by Ma Yinhui, which made him even more suspicious. Yesterday morning at about 12 o'clock, Shi happened to meet Ma Yinhui near Qiuxin Bridge in Nanshi while he was out. He immediately grabbed him and reported him to Tian Xiaoquan, the police officer on duty at Post 26. He was taken to Section 1 of Area 1. During the preliminary interrogation by the section chief, Shi confessed the previous situation and requested a thorough investigation. When questioned, Ma Yinhui confessed that on April 15 of this year, Shi had a minor incident with his wife, which caused a big conflict. Shi's wife told me that she wanted to commit suicide by throwing herself into the sea. I repeatedly persuaded her and sent her to Cixi to stay temporarily to avoid arguing with Shi again. In June, I sent her to her mother's house. I really saved her life with good intentions. Who knew that I would be bitten by a dog and falsely accused. It's really unjust, etc. Because it involved abducting a married woman, he was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

Zhang was sent to the hospital for treatment, but he died. The body was reported to the court for inspection and clarification. Because there were no family members, the hall collected the body. Fan was sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution and detention in accordance with Article 296 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, he was summoned again. The official questioned the defendant and ordered the debate to begin. After mutual arguments between the police lawyer Fei Xizhen and the lawyer Ai Zhenlin, who was appointed by the court to defend the defendant, Judge Ge announced the end of the debate and sentenced Fan Guifeng to three years and six months of imprisonment for injury causing death. The number of days of detention before the judgment is final shall be deducted from the imprisonment at the rate of two days for one day. The murder weapon was sent to the stolen goods warehouse.</p>

They removed Yuan's body to the Philander Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Huaipu of the First Special District Court went to the office to inspect the body and took a seat in the official position. According to Zhang Mingji, the owner of the construction factory, the new house I built is only separated from the weaving factory by a small alley, and the machines used in the factory are very large and have great power, causing the ground to shake, which caused the wall to collapse. According to Yan Zizhen, I am the deputy manager of the Shengde Factory. The factory has been located there for eight or nine years. This time, the new house was not built firmly, which caused my factory building to collapse, killing one person and injuring five people on the spot. The machines, etc. have been damaged, causing great losses. After obtaining the statement, Guo ordered that the deceased Yuan Qiaosheng was verified to have died from being crushed by the new house built by the Zhang Mingji Construction Factory before his death. The police should investigate whether the factory was at fault and handle it according to law. Yan Zizhen signed a guarantee to take the body back for coffin burial.</p>

<p>Mao Yiwen, chief detective of the Hongkou police, along with detectives Bao Shuji, Yang Zhaoqing, and others, received a tip-off on the 8th of this month around 7 p.m., stating that a large group of bandits planned to rob the Yeguang Company's leased property at No. 103 Yongxiang Lane, Donghanfengli Road. They secretly went to arrest Wang Changbao, a carpenter from Changzhou; Xu Wenbin; Cao De'en from Tongzhou; Yu Ande from Ningbo; and Lü Amao from Jiangyin, five people in total. Two pistols and thirteen bullets were found in Xu Wenbin's bag. Subsequently, another eleven men and women, including Shi Zhouwen from Ningbo, were apprehended inside No. 1039 Pingliang Road. They were taken to the First Special District Court. They denied the charges during interrogation and were detained for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the continued hearing in the first courtroom. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that apart from Wang Changbao, Xu Wenbin, Cao De'en, and Lü Amao, the rest were found to be innocent and requested their release.

After a while, police detectives arrived with the four defendants, stating that they were planning to rob over 3,000 yuan in foreign currency from his company. At the time, they also admitted to it. When questioned, Wang Changbao and the other three claimed that Zhao Anting, who was at large, had taken them there to fight. Before leaving, he asked them to burn incense and light candles at his house, forming a brotherhood. There were also four unknown people among them, and they did not know they were going to rob. They hired lawyers Fan Gang and Wei Wenhan to argue that the four defendants were deceived by the fugitive Zhao, who was responsible for both the witchcraft and secretly reporting to the police. They requested the court's judgment. Judge Xiao ordered Wang Changbao and the other three defendants to be remanded in custody, pending a scheduled pronouncement of the verdict.</p>

With the nation's attention focused on diplomacy due to the Japanese invasion of Liaoning, the millions of starving disaster victims have been neglected. Now that the weather is cold and the year is ending, compatriots in the disaster areas are suffering from cold and hunger, with no one to turn to. Ms. Huang is deeply concerned and is selling calligraphy and paintings to raise funds for winter relief, hoping to promote social awareness. Two hundred pieces of calligraphy will be available, limited to couplets, screens, fan surfaces, and album leaves, priced at four yuan each. Paper must be provided by the buyer, and postage for foreign locations will be an additional yuan. Paintings will be priced based on size and nature, up to three thousand yuan. All proceeds will be given to official charitable organizations for distribution. It is also reported that Ms. Huang has entrusted the Shanghai Evening News at No. 130, Jiaotong Road, Maijiaquan, to handle all procedures, and her recent works will be published daily in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. Yan Yuheng sent a message with a summary of the National Training Essentials for War Preparedness against Japan, written by Mr. Ding Jin.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding is a military expert. This article is concise and appropriate. If followed, it can correct the weaknesses of the people in peacetime and defeat the enemy in times of emergency. Now that the whole country is singing military training, it is important to introduce it to the general public. Mr. Yan's original message is omitted, the reporter noted.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Summary of National Training Essentials for War Preparedness Against Japan (Continued) <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>(C) Lifestyle: (1) Practice walking. Besides fighting, the easiest things to tire people in the military and increase disease are marching. The Chinese people are physically weak and live in a vast land with inconvenient transportation, so it is necessary to practice walking diligently. It is also necessary to practice running in various high, low, narrow, and dangerous terrains. It is necessary to be able to walk a hundred miles a day and continue for five or six days or more. It is also necessary to be able to run thirteen or fourteen miles an hour and continue for two or three hours or more. (2) Practice camping in the wild. Modern warfare always uses large armies to resist. In addition to striving to reduce their strength, their suffering must be increased in terms of supplies and accommodation. Therefore, the ancient method of strengthening walls and clearing the fields is still used repeatedly and effectively. Whether it is a city or a village, defend if possible, but when it is impossible to defend, be sure to burn all clothing and material that cannot be taken away to prevent them from aiding the enemy. As the war lasts longer, there will be fewer and fewer things that have not been burned. Therefore, practice camping in the wild, no matter the mountains, forests, or wetlands, and do not avoid wind, rain, frost, or dew. What they find very painful, we do not find painful, so that fighting power can be continuously maintained. (3) Practice enduring pain. In wartime, death is not painful, but injuries are very painful. Especially in our country, where there is not much medicine or adequate care, injuries are felt even more painfully. If there is no habit of enduring pain, the sound of their screams will reduce the courage of their comrades. Therefore, it is necessary to practice hard at ordinary times. (4) Practice drinking less water. In the military, enduring thirst is more difficult than enduring hunger. Drinking unclean water is also easy to cause disease. After a long period of labor, the joy of drinking water is greater than everything else. Conversely, those who have no water to drink will easily lose their spirits. Therefore, from now on, it is important to avoid drinking too much. (5) Practice wearing less clothing. Our country produces a lot of wool and cotton, and the Chinese people are accustomed to comfort and do not like exercise. Therefore, they usually wear more clothing than other countries. However, in wartime, each person has a fixed limit for clothing, weapons, and all supplies, which must not exceed one-half of their body weight. Carrying too much will slow down the army and delay military opportunities. Carrying too little will cause the body to be unaccustomed and easily susceptible to disease. Therefore, from now on, it is important to avoid wearing too much. (6) Exercise restraint in all hobbies. Drinking alcohol can lead to loss of control, gambling can lead to loss of ambition, and smoking and sexual intercourse can harm the body. All should be restrained in order to kill the enemy and avenge deep hatred. (D) Fundamental Plan for Foreign Warfare: Modern warfare is not the sole responsibility of both sides' armies, but a competition of the entire people's material strength. After the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, the Japanese told Western friends that Japan could not win against China in any way, but Japan could not but win against the family of Li Hongzhang. The 918 Incident was called a local issue by the Japanese, probably wanting to continue to follow the old methods. Such actions are called "piecemeal annihilation" in military terms. From this evolution, four hundred million people are equal to one person. The Chinese people inherently have this weakness, so Qin could destroy the six states, and a small number of Mongol-Manchu peoples could control the Han people and form the Yuan and Qing dynasties. Recently, the knowledge class has heard about the theory of nation, and when faced with foreign insults, they are slightly impulsive, but they are still only in an indirect position, dividing a little remaining strength and regarding it as a good deed of disaster relief and neighborly assistance. There is not one in ten million who seeks real technical assistance, destroys their homes to relieve the difficulties of the country, and regards national affairs as private affairs. The rest of the masses are ignorant and unknowing. When a knife is put to their necks, they may let out a cry of misery. They are as docile as sheep and as foolish as pigs. When they interact with the tigers, wolves, and foxes of the world, success or failure can be predicted. In the nearest future, if we do not want to perish as a nation and race, we must fight a desperate battle with the most inhuman Japanese. If we want to fight, all the able-bodied men of the country must carry out the above-mentioned training essentials. However, this is the militia. The state spends 400 million yuan a year to support an army of 2 million men. If there is no fundamental change, they still cannot fight. Why? In modern powerful land armies, there is no mercenary system. The intention of our 2 million soldiers is to make a living, not to fulfill an obligation. Therefore, they are of low character, lack knowledge, are greedy for life and afraid of death, are close to bandits and far from the people, are old and do not retire, so they are old and cost a lot. Conscription without pay, so the cost is low, difficult to recruit, and easy to escape. If this system is not changed, it can create bandits, produce warlords, and cause internal chaos, but it will never dare to resist foreign insults. An army that spends huge sums of money annually does not fight, and the militia cannot fight even if they want to. The sage rises again, not changing my words. Some doubt that changing to conscription will reduce productivity. They do not know that although conscription has the name of the whole country being soldiers, in reality, in the current situation in our country, one-quarter of the people have the obligation to draw lots in peacetime (the old, young, and women have no obligation). One in sixteen hundred has the obligation to be a soldier. If the quota for the standing army is one million people (four times that of the Japanese), and one-third of the new soldiers are changed annually, then more than 300,000 soldiers are needed. Counting the national population of 480 million, the new soldiers are one in sixteen hundred of the total population. Men are half of the population, and able-bodied men are half of the men, then the new soldiers are one in eight hundred of the men, and one in four hundred of the able-bodied men. If one in every four hundred able-bodied men serves as a soldier each year, the proportion will be smaller than it is now, but the efficiency will be a hundred times greater than that of mercenaries. With this opportunity, I hope our people will urge the government to promulgate the law and put it into effect in the shortest possible time, so that the training of the militia is as before, and the reform of the army is like this, winning against the Japanese and wiping out the humiliation, all in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>To the Editor: According to the attorney of record for Zhang Mingji Construction Factory, regarding an item in your newspaper's local news section titled "New House Collapses Before Completion," the facts are not accurate. The newly built wall had not been completed, and the roof had not been attached. Therefore, it is different in form from the finished walls of a house. On the 15th, the Shengde Weaving Factory's workshop next door suddenly began to use a large engine, causing continuous ground vibration, resulting in the collapse of the newly built wall, as the mortar had not yet dried and hardened, and then it was subjected to severe vibration. This is the true course of events. Fearing that misinformation will be spread, we hereby entrust our lawyer to request a correction. We therefore respectfully request that the Editor of the Shenbao newspaper make the correction. Sincerely, Attorney Tang Youwei, December 16</p>

<p>▲ Zhongxi Pharmacy on Fourth Avenue declares that it has been holding a large winter bargain sale since the first of this month, and is also giving away art glass cups and Commander brand soaps. In the past ten days, business has been exceptionally prosperous. It was recently noted that the weather in Shanghai suddenly turned cold. The pharmacy has installed water-heating pipes and large stoves, with a suitable indoor temperature, and there is also elegant music, so customers almost forget to leave with pleasure. Therefore, the retail department has become even more crowded, increasing six to seven times compared to usual.</p>
<p>▲ Snow Flower Honey and Feifei Cream, produced by Wanguo New Drug Company, uses pure honey as the basic raw material, and its moisturizing power is different from others. Those who use it say it is effective, so it has been selling unusually well in the market recently.</p>
<p>▲ Anlu Cotton Weaving Factory on Nanjing Road and Shilu Corner declares that, as the Winter Solstice is approaching, in order to promote domestic goods and increase industry, it is holding a very large discount sale. Starting from the 16th, except for special prices, all items will be 30% off for one week, opening a new era for the domestic goods industry. There are also advertising rice bowls, teacups, and teapots for sale, priced low and used for publicity.</p>
<p>▲ Jia Mo Company declares that the newly produced pure domestic art record sleeves are of beautiful paper quality and excellent printing. Each dozen sells for only sixty cents, with even cheaper wholesale prices. It has already been selling very well, which is good news for those who have records at home, and can also be a small contribution to entertainment. The general distributor is located in the Xinsheng Record Player Company on Fourth Avenue.</p>
<p>▲ Cui's Bianxianglu at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Pentang Lane declares that the dried Jiyu Hang silk floss sold on consignment is known for its thick and large sheets, strong toughness, clean white color, and soft fibers. Therefore, since its sale, it has been deeply welcomed by all circles. Recently, as the weather has gradually turned cold, sales have become more prosperous. It is said that the silk floss is still sold at two prices: five yuan and four yuan and eight cents per catty.</p>
<p>▲ Jiuhua Silk and Satin Store, diagonally opposite Wangping Street on Nanjing Road, declares that its store has always adhered to the principle of low-profit sales. Starting last month, in order to expand sales, all silk weaving items on the second floor were specially discounted, and one foot was given for every foot purchased. There are many patterns and all kinds of goods are available. Those who have heard about it and purchased are very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Field Exercises <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuo Lin</p>
<p>Amidst Instructor Xu's loud shouts of "One, two!" "One, two!", we set off for our field exercises. The rhythmic sound of our marching often startled passersby who turned to look at us. After receiving a salute from the guard at the gate of × University, we soon arrived at our destination.</p>
<p>There, one side bordered the railway tracks, and on the other side, a small river ran parallel to the tracks. On both sides, the land was like fields separated by a river. We walked in double file along the small path beside the railway tracks. Next to this piece of land stood a stone tablet telling us it was the "×× Cemetery for the Destitute." There were a few scattered trees, and three or four unburied small coffins.</p>
<p>"Today," Instructor Wang, standing on a high mound, said, "We will conduct field exercises here. This is a cemetery for the destitute, but don't be afraid, because on the battlefield, there are always dead people. Moreover, they often lie stark naked on the ground, without even a coffin. Although Red Cross medics often go to move them, they dare not go within the line of fire. So, if we are prepared to go to the battlefield, we must not be afraid of the dead. Besides, the dead are dead, and we are alive. Is it not a joke for the living to fear the dead?</p>
<p>"Think about it, why am I rambling on so much? Because when we came in, I saw some people sticking out their tongues at those nearby, or two people sticking their tongues out at each other. Some even frowned. We must understand that as soldiers, this kind of attitude is unacceptable. In a moment, we will be practicing advancing in skirmish lines and lying down. I don't want to see anyone looking timid."</p>
<p>We were divided into two groups. Our group was commanded by Instructor Xu.</p>
<p>"　囗……" A sharp, prolonged whistle sounded, and we all dropped to the ground. The place where I landed was at the foot of a relatively large, new grave. Fortunately, there were neither tall, hard reeds nor puddles. I looked to my left, and Xiao Wang had a very dense clump of reeds right in front of him. "What a good hiding place," I whispered to him. "……" He returned a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Looking further on, I saw the most unfortunate A'Niu. To his right was a sparkling puddle, and behind his feet was a brand-new small coffin. Just as I noticed him, he happened to turn his head to look at me. He made a face and did his favorite gesture - closing his eyes and sticking out his tongue.</p>
<p>When we returned to school covered in mud, we held our chests higher and stepped even more firmly. On the way from the school gate to the drill ground, the students who were not drilling today waved their hats at the mud on our bodies.</p>
