<p>日本經濟上之百孔千瘡。旣已如昨評所述。次之政治上亦正危機四伏。極可悲觀。日本之政治組織。本極淆混。有總攬萬幾之天皇。有輔弼天皇規劃庶政之内閣。而又另有一操縱天皇左右内閣之勢力此勢力即爲元老政黨組閣。必得元老奏荐。政府措施。必得元老同意。元老宣佈不信任。内閣即立致倒塌。大正時代之山縣松方以及現存之西園寺。都具有偉大之支配力。野心勃勃之田中義一。對元老亦必低首下心。每事參問。即如最近若槻之組閣。宇垣之受命朝鮮總督。都必得西園寺之奏荐。元老支配政治。政客都習尚於逢迎謟媚之術。影響所及。於是賄賂公行。眞倒法律。如若槻前任内閣時代之神田問題。田中内閣時代之三百萬元問題及機密費問題。濱口内問時代之三大賄案皆有例證之犖犖大者。此爲日本政治上危機之一。更有甚者。在日本政治組織之中。有極其明顯的兩個互相傾軋之中心勢力。一爲文治派之内閣政府。一爲武斷派之軍閥政府。蓋日本軍政組織。自山縣有朋以至桂太郎以來。即效法德國二元主義之軍政組織。軍統帥權之組織離普通軍政而獨立海軍統帥事務。另設有海軍軍令部。離參謀本部而獨立。此外又有元帥府。軍事參贊院爲軍事之諮詢機關。由上述四機關搆成所謂帷幄上奏機關。即無異於搆成一驕恣不法横蠻武斷之軍閥政府。所謂帷幄上奏。即不經國務大臣之議决。可以直接奏請天皇裁可。其權力範圍。實僅限於軍統帥權。即所謂軍令權。而無權涉及軍政權。然而在事實上。横蠻之軍閥。常任意伸展其權力。寖且干涉行政與外交。如西園寺内閣時代不贊成陸相上原勇作增設二師團。遂爲軍閥所倒。如大隈内閣時代對我國提出二十一條。多出於軍閥之主張。如兩次出兵我國山東。如皇姑屯事件。如最近之萬案鮮案。更如目前之暴力蹂躙我東北。皆爲日本軍閥無限制伸張其權力之結果。内閣爲一政府。帷幄上奏機關亦一政府。外務省有外交。參謀本部亦有外交。政出多門。而且内閣與外務省常遭軍閥之凌轢。濱口内閣之時被責難。幣原外相之横被攻擊。皆此輩武斷軍閥所引起者也。日人副島道正氏曾有言。「日本對華外交。一言以蔽之。日本之一部軍閥政治而已。」其言至當。此種兩重政府之組織。不僅足以使軍閥專政。治治聽命於暴力。抑且軍閥政治之抬頭。使軍閥得以逞其野心。窮兵黷武。無限制的發揮其軍國主義之特性。更足以速根基脆弱之蕞爾島國之覆敗。試看日南陸相近來之演說。跋扈飛揚。凌礫一切。對我東北出兵。不待内閣之决議。决然自由行動。軍閥政治。如火日熾。氣熖赫赫。炙手可熱。火熾不已。吾敢斷言其終當自焚。此爲日本政治上危機之又一。此外。日本政黨之議會政治。實在不過爲資本家。互鬥之武器。資本家各以其本身之利益爲前提。故對内則抑制勞働運動。業外則鼓吹侵略。鼓吹武力發展國威。適足以助長軍閥氣焰。此爲日本政治上危機之三。綜上三者。可見日本政治。近已失其常態。内政外交。皆遭暴力之刧持。無以入於常軌。說者謂日軍閥最近對我東北之暴行。即爲準備倒閣之先聲。語滋可信。然則日本軍閥之野心。正方興未艾。瘋人跨不覊之馬。狂躍疾馳。深淵在前。曾不稍顧。日本政治上之危殆。固不待有識者而後可以覘知也。</p>

<p>親愛的國人。今日何日。你們還在歡天喜地的度中秋。吃月餅麽。你們在取了一個圓圓的月餅到手中的時候。應當想到我們的中華民國本來也是圓圓的。像這月餅一樣。你在放到口中吃的時候。就應當想到暴日之對於我國。也像你吃這月餅一樣。東三省佔去了。就好似咬去了月餅的一大角。隨後再一口口咬下去。把月餅吃光。而我們的中華民國也就完了。唉。可憐的祖國啊。你怎麽與月餅一般的命運。</p>

<p>宋襄言仁取自亡。男兒何爲着戎裝。榻旁睡着鼾已久。一夕鳩佔何皇皇。昨夜朔風揭戶開。倭奴十萬捲地來。砲轟槍擊凌厲甚。霹靂天空擲迅雷。瀋吉春營相繼陷。皇姑新民迭被摧。東北三省餘有幾。坑殺焚毁勢未隤。王公被戮傅被殺。天之驕子何酷哉。東北回首殺氣騰。强嗜弱肉誰相矜。於今世間無公道。公道宜有武力憑。吁嗟乎公道宜有武力憑。</p>

<p>中日之戰。劉公島以黑子彈丸之地。與日兵相持。至藥彈餉糈皆罄。事機孔亟。而援師不進。乃欲於萬死之中求一出路。以冀勝則利在國家。敗則禍在一已。號曰不屈。允稱無愧。卒至進退靡所。無異九節度相州之敗。齎志以殁。而又蒙惡名。末由自白。莫如丁汝昌是已。當日兵旣據劉公島威海而有之。時丁汝昌之靈櫬由日人舁上康濟輪。猶升砲致敬。極形優禮。蓋忠魂毅魄之感人。雖敵對不異。迨丹旐南旋。非特見者姗笑。甚至指斥爲喪師辱國之罪人。亦可見當時國内之民氣矣。然丁以士不用命。仰藥自裁。殉節之後。兵弁始率衆投降。是則投欵之意。必不出諸海軍提督之主謀。其事甚明。噫，今無事之時。坐享厚祿。一旦事亟。如在夢中。而束手莫救。以至委軍而授於敵者。回視丁之一死。甘以身殉者。其相去豈可以道里計哉。</p>
<p>丁引决之際。尚駡某大憲不置。蓋勒請戰之電甫上。即一不許出兵。不得離威海一步。如違雖勝亦罪之手諭。坐是牽掣。遂爲敵人所困。以至於亡。蓋時上有北洋。大臣。又有海軍衙門。其權旣雜而不惠。書生告金兀术曰。「權臣在内。未有大將能立功於外者。」吾於丁亦云。中日一役。迄今已近四十年。而東隣之狡焉思啓。愈甚於昔。值此外侮憑陵。因回憶丁軍門事。亦以勉爲國執殳前驅者。</p>

<p>底子錢</p>
<p>通鑑。唐貞元十三年。宦者稱宫市買物。仍索進奉門戶及脚價錢。胡注。進奉門戶者。言進奉所經由門戶皆有費用。如漢靈帝時所謂導行費也。舊時京外官吏所用開人。（俗稱門上）動索進見者之苞苴。號曰門包。最爲惡習。上至宫廷。亦復不免。而又加甚。觀此則由來久矣。門上多北人。每京曹外簡。則交互夤緣。竿牘如織。共覬隨行。視爲利藪。雖有風節之士。欲禁之。則曰我輩恃此爲生。否則誰肯跋涉萬里以相從耶。其情如此。無如何也。自愛者亦不過嚴飭若輩不得勒索而已。外官無論矣。京官尤清苦。家丁所恃。亦惟門生故吏之入覲者。叩門贈以數金。然終不得如外官之可倚勢强索也門包以外。則底子錢爲大宗。底子錢者。主人購物。則付欵之際索留百分之二以潤家丁。此爲相沿公例。若例外需索。彌無止境。故自往店肆購物。其價必較僕役往購爲昻。由於店肆預爲之地耳。斯亦唐人所謂門戶者、京輩之下。叢此貪蠹。官方所以不澄。都邑旣墟。此輩遂失所憑依。然而底子錢之俗仍不能革也。特近數年來租住宅之打掃錢則竟不復見。打掃錢者。每租賃約成。則房主與房客之僕役各得一月租金。而瓜分之。并所謂茶錢號曰三份。茶錢者。租房之第一月須多付一月租金。以當押租。至解約時可以多住一月。不需付租也。此緣居民日少。房主不得不降格以從。否則更無問津者耳。以此覘之。將來故都之風氣。必可漸趨簡單醇撲。舊染汚俗。終將成爲陳迹歟。</p>
<p>有血氣之倫。孰不視爲不共戴天之仇。宜如何念我大好山河。將淪於日人鐵蹄蹂躪之下。宜如何念我民族當前危難。生命所繫。而刻骨椎心。迸發熱血。乃事有不然者。在此生死關頭。虎狼環視之下。國人若忘自身處境之危迫。尤耽於聲色歌舞之樂。視同胞如草芥等國土若敝屣。眞不知是何居心。且將不知其死所。「商女不知亡國恨。隔江尤唱後庭花。」誠可爲此輩詠矣。</p>
<p>逸爲生活之鞭所驅。除日間服務某公司。夜間尚在某跳無廳担任會計之職。自惡耗頒至。竊思跳舞廳將不閉門而自閉門。乃不意靡靡之音樂。甫自樂師手中曲曲傳出。蕩漾於富有陶醉性之方廳中。充满迷惑之眼光。適自妖媚舞女之雙眼中射出。閃爍於黯澹之光線下。彼爲此二物所引誘而紛至沓來者。除少數爲外人外。大多數仍爲國人也。其開香檳大擺闊之狂態。與舞女互相狎褻之狀。興致之高。殊不減於日人未在東三省大屠殺之前夕。尚未知日人大舉侵略之事乎。殆不可信也。乃彼輩擁抱日本舞女於手臂中時。輙以此事爲調笑之資料。似視爲無上之情話。而日本舞女則以其醉人之音答之云。「此國家大事也。不關我輩事。我輩得樂且樂。音樂又起奏矣。我輩人民本親善。毋以斯事而擾我輩清興。曷往跳舞。」彼輩聞之大笑。遂互相偎抱於光滑之板上。實行其中日親善。得樂且樂之主義。抑彼輩全無心肝歟。何喪心病狂若斯。是可異也。</p>

<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>「你這個見解是不對了，做妻子的，只能自已担負治家的責任才好；要是丈夫指派伊一定要管家，那便難了。譬如這一個妻子，並没有管家的經騐與能力，當然不能怪伊不管。我以爲不會管家的妻子，伊有自知之明，索性不管，倒比不會管家而偏要管，越管越糟，反好得多了。我自問是願意管家，並且也能彀管家，但是他反嫌我多管，管得不好，我也想索性不管了。如果有相當的職業，可以找一個，我很想出去做事，一個女人要自己不賺錢，只靠丈夫，我覺得是極危險的呢。你能不能給我留意，介紹一個職業？」</p>
<p>「你的能力我是知道的，要謀每月幾十元的事，一定可以找得到；但是你家裏只有兩個人，你再走了出去，家事眞没有人管了，李先生萬一知道是我把你介紹出去的，他一定要恨我呢。」</p>
<p>「他是你的朋友，我也是你的朋友，爲什麽你只顧着他，一些力也不肯帮助我？」</p>
<p>「李先生那方面，我可以犧牲友誼，但是被人家知道了，也許會生出許多是非來的。」</p>
<p>「咳！那是我不敢再託你了。但是你已聽到遇關於他和你夫人的行踪，外面也有許多話，這難道不是生出來的是非？」</p>
<p>「你聽到了什麽？你告訴我邑！」</p>
<p>「我先聲明一句，我决不是嫉妬；我只希望你們夫婦，不要因爲我丈夫的關係，而發生决外的隔膜，或者竟發生重大的惡感；同時我亦希望我丈不要和任何女人，有這樣親密的狀態。所以我在家裏，只有一個人，什麽悶氣，只藏在自己一個肚子裏，連講話的人也没有，再不出去找個職業，可以散散心，我是要悶出病來的了。」</p>
<p>「我也老實和你講我對於伊，一切都置之度外，什麽也不問了；再說得乾脆些，伊便是眞和你丈夫發生了什麽暧昧，我也由伊去幹，我一切都達觀，不算一回事，我只問我自已的良心，不對不起人，也就吧了。現在外面謀一個事很難，不要說女人，便是男子，各方面請託，還是不中用，何况女人。你如果眞要出去做事，而不怕别人講閑話，那麽我也預備什麽也不顧，替你去想法，我公司裏正想添一個文牘，你當然能彀担任的，月薪少則五十元，多則七八十元，你能去麽？」</p>
<p>「我一定去，那一天可以去接洽？」</p>
<p>「明天我就和經理去講，大概總可以成功。」</p>
<p>他們兩人的長談，已經過了三句鐘的時間，才告終止，因爲李夫人必須去預備晩餐。伊自已做了幾樣可口的菜，和陳先一一桌子吃，眞和一家人一般了。</p>

<p>南頭　昨日來源不多、早晨臨市人數極少、因天雨關係、客方勒價、但河下斛脚不满三百担、緣秋節將屆、店號雙方　結束賬欵、形勢反硬、新洋蘆到積零星、天雨出貨復不易、致價續硬二角、厚薄破粳亦硬角許、其餘均未開出云、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日來貨約念數艘、早晨大雨不止、完全停斛、午後轉晴、交易亦有限、東西新粳來貨不多、昻起一角新蘆洋尖到銷平、大盤續挻、早薄稻上棧囤戶約一千担左右價昻五分、北粳行情仍居原盤、形狀穩態、洋米到積略有、現貨無交、期貨頗活價增近角、</p>

<p>昨日洋米現貨進出兩少、期貨則有囤戶與本街問津、市形甚活、更因産地報漲、人心極佳新交易與回籠貨均跳漲一錢左右、如囤戶繼續購買、則後市當須轉好也、全市開出敏黨現米二百包、價十二元九角、回籠期貨九月份小絞三百噸、價五兩六錢三分至五兩六錢九分、又十月份、三百噸、價五兩七錢至五兩七錢三分、新交易則有十一月份小絞七百噸、價五兩七錢、係源興洋行售出、本街買進云、</p>

<p>英馬口鐵　昨日福建帮辦進七百餘箱、由萬象輪裝閩、價九十磅十三兩五錢、一百磅十五兩二錢半、比之前市已提加一錢、聞海外來電昨已回好至十五先令二便士、所以本埠人心良佳、後市極有看好希望云、</p>
<p>美馬口鐵　昨日烟廠家生意異常興奮、統計全市開出爲數達七八百箱之多、而蛋廠帮進胃昨亦良佳、因此底貨被搜有限、人心鞏固、所以行情極有升漲之可能、查一百磅開出價每箱爲十六兩七錢半、一百磅十五兩七錢半、據業中人云、美貨近日購辦者頗多、而到貨不多、所以來市趨况頗許樂觀、</p>

<p>颶風發生　昨日徐家匯天文台發出氣象報告、謂温州洋面、已發生颶風、現風勢向東北方向吹來、進行極速、下午吳淞外揚子江口已經有颶風吹到、此報告發布後、即在黄浦灌爱多亞路口之氣象報告台上高懸大黑球、以警告颶風之將到上海、使航運界早作準備、</p>
<p>海關鳴砲　江海關得到天文台報告後、在下午四時四十五分、即在浦東開放信砲一聲、蓋以警告滬上各輪公司及在浦江行駛之船隻、俾得預先防範、免遭颶風之危害、此信砲開放後、在黄浦江内之小舢舨划子及貨駁民船等、均提早停航、在五時許、已相率開到老港内及碼頭上避風矣、</p>

<p>我是一個失意的青年、要想個方法來解决本身的問題有人勸我不可灰心、努力事業、也有人邀我尋空寂之途、畢竟環境所逼、决意遁跡空門、但須預先准備、聞有一部大日如來經疏抄、却不知何處有賣、入手研究佛學、門徑也不大清楚、但我遊移不决的心靈究不知向什麽路上走纔好、貴報包羅萬有、指示迷津、應請以寶貴篇幅、指示我的路徑、並可使與我同樣失意的人、在歧途的人、也得到同樣的指敎、不但造福於我、且可造福人羣哩。</p>
<p>（覆）你因爲失意灰心、而遁跡空門、是根本錯誤的、古人云、「出家乃大丈夫之事、非王侯將相所能爲、」釋迦牟尼以王太子而出家、全是爲解决人生的生死大問題、所以捨掉王位、自身去實地修證、證到明心見性的成佛地位、然後到處去說法、普度衆生、救人的慧命、這等捨身救世的精神、那裡是王侯將相所能做得到呢、我國從唐朝到明朝、原有一種制度、凡是要出家的人、須經過官廳考騐、必須學問志願、都是合格、方給以牒文、准他出家、名呌度牒、到清朝初年、廢去這制、聽人隨便出家、弄得清凈佛門、幾幾乎變成逋逃的淵藪、造成無數坐食無事的僧侣、這全是社會的病態、如果政治上了軌道、社會分子健全、這等病態、要赶緊醫治的、你旣是有志青年、也肯跟著去做社會的寄考蟲嗎、試看日本也是佛敎的國度、他們就能利有佛敎大雄無畏的精神、養成健全的國民、他們的僧侣、都有學問能指導人民、和我國情形大不同了、所以研究佛學、要知道佛敎的眞精神、至於大日如來經疏鈔、現在湖州密敎重興會有出售、不過是密宗的高深徑典、决非初學所能了解的、你要知道佛學門經、應該先看幾種書、列在下面、看過後自然可得門而入了、</p>

<p>航空是最近數十年前才發生的新事業、自航空事業興、國家主權的範圍的觀念、也要因之而變更了、從前一般人對於國家主權的範圍的觀念、祗是認爲國家須有領土與領海的主權而已、現在我們則認爲國家的主權、除應有領土與領海外、更應有領空了、古時閉關時代、國家的軍事全靠陸軍、晩近海禁開放了後、國家的軍事、則側重在海軍、此去航空事業發達、國家的軍事、不重在陸軍、也不重在海軍、而重在空軍了、而且航空事業、不僅在軍事上占最重要的地位而已、即在政治上、外交上、經濟上、交通上、文化上、也占第一重要的地位、所以現在世界上的國家、競相發展航空的事業、以預備作政治的、軍事的、經濟的、文化的鬥爭、南洋一地、暹羅獨立政府與英荷·法·美等居留政府林立、對於航空事業、當然也在着着進行、不遺餘力的、著者現將英屬馬來亞航空事業的情形、披露於次、以見其進展的一斑、丨丨丨丨雖云爲馬來亞的航空事業、其實與英國、印度、澳洲、暹羅、荷屬等處、都不能無若干的關係、</p>

<p>— 高偉</p>
<p>董修甲著</p>
<p>董修甲君著「都市分區論」、是專討論都市分區制度問題的專書、作者是國内有數的市政學專家、這裏作者不但極力提倡都市分區之必要、而且懇切的指示都市分區的原則、本來市政學是二十世紀來纔有的一項科學、所以都市分區制度、尤爲各國都市最近發明的方法、其演化的歷史固甚暫、不過、這都市分區制度之已爲各國所後先採用、實證明這制度對於市政行政確有莫大裨益、而爲我們研究市政學者所不容忽視的、</p>
<p>我們知道、各國都市在剛建設的時候、爲求人口多量的吸收、向例是採用放任主義的、毫没有法令這一類東西約束他們、所以對於市内建築物、便漫無限制了、於是一切房屋建築、蒿低不一、建築面積、多少不等、而土地用度、更是凌亂無度了、以致市民商店和住宅的日光空氣、均感窒息、公共衞生、也就談不到了、但是「近年來、各國都市人口日增、工商發達、都市居民、羣集市内、毫無秩序、致生居住問題、衞生問題、各國都市因感放任主義之非、遂相率提倡都市分區制度、最先採用者、爲德國各都市、繼其後者、爲其他歐洲各都市、現在美洲各國及日本、亦均規定分區法律、切實執行、施行之後、市民分區居住、秩序井然、都市衞生、日臻完善、市民生活、亦日益進步矣、（序）可知都市分區制度的實際功用、其影響固極大、</p>
<p>是書共分四章、一、緒論、二、依土地用處分區法、三、依房屋容量分區法、四、總結、作者先述各國採用分區制度的經過、及其分區制度的要點、再論我國各大市的分區制度、最後更將各種制度、略加比較、以說明利弊的所在、藉供我國各市的參考、</p>
<p>在緒論中、作者說明現今各國都市分區的劃分是概以法律規定的、至其規定分區的職權、大凡單體的國家、都是由中央政府授諸都市、聨邦政府則由各邦政府授諸都市、關於這種法律上的根據、我們是不可不認識的、其次、作者介紹各國市政學家對於都市分區的理論、如維立母氏Williams卜色特氏Bassett羅倫氏Nolen等、而作者對於我國各市市民之不能明白分區的意義、尤多指摘、</p>
<p>「依土地用處分區法、」作者先行介紹各國都市依土地用處分區法的採用及其分區法的要點、按此項制度最行採用者爲德國的咈蘭克梯翁則市（Ｅrank丨onthe丨Main）其後德國各都市都採用、並傳至瑞士以至那威、司維登各國、英國亦曾於一九○九年採用、現正加拿大、美國、日本也大半採用此項分區原則、次而述我國各市依土地用處分區法的採用及其分區的要點、以下便是作者「依土地用處分區制度之原則」所提供的意見、</p>
<p>作者主張、如採用此項分區法的時候、是可以分作、「笨重工業區、輕便工業區、大小商業區、住宅區、及市行政區等六種、同時爲明瞭起見、並詳述各種區域劃分的原則數點、（一）凡近鐵路江河之處應定爲大商業或工業區以其交通方便、運輸容易、（二）凡與山川相近或與林木較多之處相近者、應定爲住宅區、（三）凡與住宅區相近之處應劃一小商業區、（四）（凡都市各處的園林湖池、以及小山土壟、均應特别保存、并加工修理培植以供市民的遊覽與休息、使都市空氣可以藉以調和、（五）凡市區之中心點、應定爲都市之中心區、再市行政區、可與大商業區相近、或即規定附與大商業區以内、（六）凡一市之住宅區、可以分佈於各處、但無論如何、不能與大商業區或工業區相近、（七）應將市區附近、多畫風景地點、使都市可得田園都市的風味、（八）於可能範圍内、暫時保留舊有的商業區、待新市區發達後、再視該發的趨勢、規定其適宜的區域、</p>
<p>「依房屋容量分區法、」也是創始於德國的都市、其目的可以改善都市衞生、免除火患、更可增加街道外觀的雄壯美麗、近年來歐美各國亦大都贊成之、作者在「依房屋面分區法」中也是先述各國都市採用的一般狀態、次而述我國各市的採用情形、在「依房屋高下分區法」中、作者亦如例述之、至作者對於此項分區法的原則、則認爲亦應有下列標準、</p>
<p>屬於依房屋面積分區者、（一）應以土地所在地的地位爲標準、不得隨便規定全市房屋所佔之面積爲一律、（二）應以基地之大小爲標準、其大小所佔的面積、亦不能爲一律的限制、（三）凡在一市中區的土地、其房屋所佔的基地、應較少、在外面的則可較多、（四）凡在某一基地的中間者、其房屋的土地、應較少、在外圈的、則可較多、（五）工商業區的基地、其房屋所佔的土地可較多、住宅區、則可較少、屬於依房屋高下分區者、（一）住宅區房屋的高度、應較最低、（二）商業區可較住宅工業各區爲高、（三）工業區可較住宅區稍高、（四）兩面街道的房屋應較一面街道房屋的高度爲稍低、（五）木料房屋的高度應較磚料房屋的高度爲低、（六）磚料房屋的高度、應較鐵筋洋灰的高度爲低、（七）外圈區域房屋的高度、可較中間區域者稍高、（八）某一基地轉角房屋的高度、可較中間者稍高、</p>
<p>以上所陳各點、辦理都市建設者、都應予以注意的、</p>
<p>方今我國創辦市政之市、固日見增　　「我國各市、現在採用分區制度自然極好、惟應注意兩點、一應於劃分房屋高下、與規定建築面積區域之先、須依土地用處、而分區域、依土地用處所劃分之區地、即作各區建築物之高下、與面積之標準、庶幾各區之限制、可以適當、各區之需要、可以相宜矣、二應注意將來、不追旣往、區域雖已劃定、房屋高下與建築面積雖經規定、但與分區制度有妨之舊建築、祇能暫時任其存在、俟將來改建時、另行飭令遵章改建、不能於分區制度定後、即令各市民照改、則與法律不追旣往之旨、旣有違背、實徒引起種種糾紛也、但新造之建築物、無論如何、總應遵照分區規定辦理、不能隨便徇私通融、此即所謂注意將來、不追旣往也、」</p>

<p>Japan Should Bear Major Responsibility for the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Goubangzi and Other Places</p>
<p>Northeast Border Defense Command and Liaoning Provincial Government Move to Jin County</p>
<p>The Japanese Foreign Ministry received a letter from US Secretary of State Stimson, expressing the US government's views on the Manchurian Incident, stating that Japan should bear major responsibility. The League of Nations Council will seek a thorough resolution to the Manchurian Incident. Representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain held a secret meeting the previous evening to discuss methods such as organizing a commission to conduct on-site investigations.</p>
<p>The Japanese government declared to the League of Nations that Japanese troops in Manchuria are withdrawing. Japanese troops are conducting a census in Shenyang and dispatching armored trains to patrol Shenyang day and night.</p>
<p>Japanese aircraft bombed Goubangzi, Tongliao, Xinglongdian, and other places, causing many casualties. The Northeast Border Defense Command and Liaoning Provincial Government have temporarily moved to Jin County to conduct their business.</p>

<p>Advises Japan Not to Use Force Again</p>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry received a letter from US Secretary of State Stimson, outlining the US government's views on the Manchurian Incident, stating that Japan should bear major responsibility. The letter, conveyed by the Japanese Ambassador to the US, Debuchi, first stated that the US does not wish to interfere in Japan's affairs and that the letter should not be regarded as a protest. It then expressed the US's opinions on the Manchurian Incident based on received information, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and the great concern of all nations from a moral and legal standpoint. Since the incident in Shenyang, the expansion of military actions suggests that Japan must bear a major responsibility. It is now imperative that neither side take advantage of the situation to increase special interests, but rather seek a quick resolution, and refrain from using force again. It is reported that the Foreign Ministry is currently drafting a reply, and a reply is also being drafted to the League of Nations Administrative Council. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting this afternoon as a result. Prior to the meeting, the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, and Army Minister gathered to discuss various matters. One of the decisions reached was that Japanese residents in Harbin must evacuate due to the dangerous situation. (Reuter's dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Striving to Reduce the Scope of the Incident</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Are Withdrawing to Original Defense Lines</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government today instructed Yoshizawa to reply to the League of Nations Council, stating that the notifications from the Council have been received. However, before the League of Nations Council took this kind of action, the Japanese government had been striving to reduce the scope of the Manchurian Incident. The Japanese government had notified the Council through Ambassador Yoshizawa that Japan does not object to the exchange of views on troop withdrawal with the Chinese representative in Geneva. Japanese troops in Manchuria are currently withdrawing to their original defense lines, so the Japanese government believes that there is no need for an exchange of views. The Japanese government's instruction was drafted last night, and the military is quite dissatisfied, believing that the League of Nations does not fully understand the situation in Manchuria. The military authorities believe that Japan has not invaded Manchuria, but is merely exercising its treaty right to station troops, and they do not understand why the League of Nations is paying so much attention to this matter. The League of Nations notification arrived at the Japanese Foreign Ministry at 2:00 PM yesterday. (National News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the case of Japanese troops' atrocities will be adjudicated by the League of Nations. As for the Japanese propaganda that Japanese troops intend to withdraw to the railway zone, the authorities have not yet received an official report and cannot confirm it.

<p>Expresses Satisfaction with the Executive Yuan's Resolution</p>
<p>Declares That His Country Has Not Taken Any Military Action</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting recently telegraphed a reply to the Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Yuan, the main points of which are: Firstly, he expressed his admiration for the prompt response of the Executive Yuan and his satisfaction with the measures resolved by the Yuan. Secondly, regarding the first point of the Executive Yuan's resolution, the National Government, since the case has been brought before the League of Nations, has strictly ordered the national army to avoid conflicts with the invading forces, and has uniformly instructed the people to maintain a serious and calm attitude. Regarding the intention of the second point, he stated that China has not taken any measures that violate the letter or spirit of the resolution, nor has there been any troop movement. He also stated that the Chinese government is very pleased with the League of Nations' proposal to take the most effective measures to seek the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops. Once the Chinese government restores the management rights of the areas from which the Japanese troops withdraw, it will naturally assume full responsibility for protecting life and property. Finally, he stated that the Chinese government also expresses satisfaction with the Executive Yuan's transfer of the meeting minutes to the US government. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Separately Notifies the Chinese and Japanese Governments</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson today notified the League of Nations that he will inform China and Japan to maintain peace in the Far East. Stimson's telegram to the League of Nations Council in Geneva read: The resolution of your Council on the Sino-Japanese incident has been forwarded by Mr. Wilson, our Minister to Switzerland. I have learned of the two clauses that have been included in your Council's communication to China and Japan. The US government expresses its full sympathy with your Council's attitude. I will, in accordance with your wishes, notify China and Japan to urge a ceasefire and troop withdrawal. The US government will continue to make earnest efforts to restore peace. It is widely believed that the US's expression of its attitude and support for the League of Nations' actions will be of great help in restoring peace in the East and is expected to be effective soon. Although the US cannot jointly intervene with the League of Nations, it will proceed separately in accordance with the League of Nations' steps to promote a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Incident. (National News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The US's strong advocacy of a ceasefire and troop withdrawal by China and Japan has been officially notified to the League of Nations by Wilson, the US Minister to Switzerland, this morning. However, US Secretary of State Stimson's communication did not express the US's opinion on sending personnel to participate in the Manchurian investigation team.

<p>The League of Nations Values the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>Representatives of Five Nations Hold Secret Meeting</p>
<p>Advocating Organizing a Commission for On-Site Investigation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Ministry recently received a telegram from the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, stating that after the adjournment of the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd, representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain held a secret meeting for an hour and a half. Afterwards, they asked our Chinese representative to point out on the map the areas occupied by the Japanese army and the locations where Japanese residents lived and invested. At the same time, they asked our representative whether he objected to the deployment of military attachés from various countries' embassies to Northeast China for inspection, and to what extent China could provide them with transportation facilities. Our representative replied that he welcomed the dispatch of attachés from embassies to North China for inspection, but that transportation facilities could only reach Shanhaiguan, because beyond that, the Chinese railways were all occupied by the Japanese army. Our representative will continue to discuss measures with the representatives of the five countries. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Ministry recently received a telegram from the Chinese delegation in Geneva stating that Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji recently spoke with British representative Cecil. Shi said that the Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council has already notified China to adopt a calm attitude and wait for a resolution, but the situation is becoming more and more dangerous. Japan is even acting freely within the Great Wall, leading to rumors that the Japanese navy is rushing towards the Chinese coast. The League of Nations Executive Council should immediately appoint a neutral investigation committee and immediately convene another executive meeting to discuss emergency measures. If the League of Nations does not immediately appoint an investigation committee, he will suggest to the Executive Council at tomorrow's meeting that it should ask which country to assume responsibility for the investigation. Cecil said that the Chinese government should provide the committee with all kinds of facilities and notify the League of Nations Secretariat of the situation. Shi replied that the notification had already been drafted and would be sent immediately. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council convened a secret meeting at 7:00 PM tonight to discuss solutions to the Manchurian Incident, but it adjourned at 9:15 PM without any results. Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji strongly advocated at the secret meeting that the great powers dispatch a diplomatic commission to Manchuria to conduct an investigation. The Council then formally told Japanese representative Yoshizawa that if Japan still does not express its attitude on this matter promptly, the Council will have no choice but to convene a public meeting immediately to discuss the matter. German representative Bernstorff advocated organizing a committee to discuss the Manchurian issue during the League of Nations Council's recess. It was heard at the Council's secret meeting tonight that Japanese representative Yoshizawa had received new instructions. After the League of Nations Council adjourned, it was generally believed in Geneva that the Sino-Japanese situation was becoming more dangerous, but practical sanctions depended on the attitude of the US. It was heard that the US will send representatives to cooperate with the League of Nations. Geneva still believes that the great powers will designate personnel from the diplomatic corps in Nanjing and Tokyo to form an investigation commission and rush to Shenyang and other places for on-site investigation. Representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain met for an hour and a half before holding the secret meeting to discuss the issue of sending an investigation team to Shenyang as soon as possible, and all expressed their agreement. Japan still opposes third parties intervening and hopes for direct negotiations between Nanjing and Tokyo. Ambassador Shi attended the preparatory meeting of the great powers for a few minutes and expressed his agreement with the opinions of the five countries. The five countries' representatives are trying to seek Japan's consent, and the future is very optimistic, because if the investigation commission is composed of diplomatic personnel rather than military attachés, Japan can be expected to comply. The task of the investigation team is temporarily to investigate the truth and report to the Council, whether China and Japan have violated the Council's resolution and are still expanding the situation, and to monitor the withdrawal of the Chinese and Japanese armies in Manchuria to their original defense lines. The representatives all believe that the situation in Manchuria is developing towards a serious direction at all times. When Ambassador Shi met with the representatives of the five countries, he read out the latest telegram sent by China. US Minister Wilson is now inspecting in Geneva and did not participate in the preparatory meeting of the five countries, but only met with League of Nations Secretary-General Sir Eric Drummond and reported the results of the talks to the representatives of the five countries. Minister Wilson met with Sir Drummond after receiving instructions from Washington. Japanese representative Yoshizawa today sent the latest official reports delivered from Tokyo to Secretary-General Drummond for distribution to the members of the Council and requested the Council to adjourn for two days. Tonight's secret meeting was unexpected. The only result of the secret meeting was that Yoshizawa agreed to request instructions from Tokyo, expressing Japan's attitude towards the organization of the investigation team. The issue of whether Japan agrees to send an observation team was also mentioned. (National telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, authorities declared that the League of Nations Assembly and Executive Council will continue to meet until a solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute has been found. The League of Nations Assembly was originally scheduled to close on Saturday, but this morning, the Chairman stated that the members must wait until both countries have resolved the dispute and reached a satisfactory agreement before they can separate again, which proves that they fully agree with the Chairman's position. The committee organized by the five members of the Executive Council is now discussing the steps to be taken to restore peace in Manchuria. The committee is composed of representatives from Spain and the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. The US did not participate because it did not join the League of Nations, but Wilson, the US diplomat currently stationed in Geneva, is informed of the proceedings of the meetings by the committee. Japanese representative Yoshizawa hopes to receive further instructions from Tokyo tomorrow. Le Loux made a brief speech in the Assembly, stating that the Executive Council deeply hopes that their discussions can lead to a satisfactory resolution of the dispute, and the Executive Council will report the issue to the Assembly as soon as possible. (Reuter's telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations has realized the seriousness of the Manchurian Incident. Although there are many European issues that need to be dealt with urgently, the Executive Council is now fully engaged in dealing with the Sino-Japanese conflict. At 6:45 PM tonight, a large crowd gathered at the Executive Council's meeting venue because an open Executive Council meeting had been temporarily convened, and the general public was eager to hear what progress had been made on the Manchurian issue. Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji arrived at the meeting earliest. As soon as he took his seat, a note was passed to him. Seeing it, Shi excused himself, taking his documents with him and entering another conference room. It turned out that the chief representatives of Spain, Britain, Germany, and Italy were holding a secret meeting and invited Shi to attend. Yoshizawa was also invited to attend. Soon, an announcement was made that the public meeting would be postponed, and the crowd dispersed in disappointment. The Executive Council held a secret meeting for two hours, and adjourned at 9:00 PM without any concrete decisions. It was heard that Yoshizawa had read a long document from Tokyo regarding the Manchurian Incident up to September 21. The Sino-Japanese conflict filled the air here. Tonight, it was rumored that the Japanese representative had received instructions from the government that he must not agree to the League of Nations investigating the Manchurian Incident under any circumstances. There was also a rumor that the Japanese military authorities in Manchuria had obtained a guarantee of assistance from Russia. Tomorrow, the League of Nations Assembly will hold a plenary meeting, with representatives from 52 countries attending. According to some sources, the Chinese chief representative will report on the Manchurian issue to the plenary meeting, but responsible parties denied this tonight. Today, the Chinese delegation received a telegram from the Nanjing government stating that Japanese troops had occupied Harbin. This telegram was immediately sent to the League of Nations Secretary-General and distributed to the members of the Executive Council. The firm attitude adopted by the League of Nations yesterday seems to have had a concrete impact on the situation in the Far East. Although the situation in Tokyo, especially the relationship between the Tokyo Cabinet and the military authorities, remains unclear, various phenomena seem to indicate that the attitude of the League of Nations Executive Council, aided by important news from Washington, has had a calming effect on Japanese public opinion. At the same time, the telegram sent to the Nanjing government yesterday should enable Nanjing to stabilize and enable China to understand that if China persists in its current attitude of tolerance, world opinion crystallized in the League of Nations will certainly lead to a fair and peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese incident. (Reuter's telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Council President Lerroux announced today that the League of Nations Assembly and Council will continue to meet to deal with the Sino-Japanese incident in Manchuria. The League of Nations Assembly and Council were originally scheduled to adjourn last Saturday, but the adjournment was cancelled due to the serious situation in Manchuria. Lerroux added that the Council is now making every effort to restore peace in the Far East and hopes to resolve the Manchurian issue as soon as possible. Initially, League of Nations Assembly President Titulescu had announced this intention to the Assembly, believing it was their inescapable duty. President Titulescu later said that the League of Nations agencies should convene permanently if necessary to safeguard justice. Before the League of Nations Assembly and Council convened today, representatives from Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain had first held a five-power meeting at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss the Manchurian incident. The Council has now received communications from the US and China regarding the Manchurian incident. The Chinese communication agrees with the proposal to avoid expanding the situation in Manchuria, and the Nanjing government has expressed its willingness to withdraw the Manchurian garrison and participate in peace talks with Japan. China expressed its gratitude to the Council for notifying the US of the developing situation. (National News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Russian Workers Express Sympathy for Us</p>
<p>(Moscow) This morning, the newspapers slightly revealed the details of yesterday's conversation between Foreign Commissar Litvinov and the Russian Ambassador, stating that Litvinov frankly told the Japanese ambassador that if the Japanese army continues to advance towards the Chinese Eastern Railway, Soviet Russia cannot sit idly by. The Soviet Russian government believes that the Japanese army's actions on the Chinese Eastern Railway are absolutely unjustified and not beneficial to Japan, and asks the Japanese ambassador to convey this intention to the Japanese government and inform him of the Japanese government's reply. (National News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Ministry received a telegram from Moscow, stating that according to Karakhan, the expansion of Japanese military actions in the three northeastern provinces was beyond the Soviet Union's expectations. The Soviet Union expressed great sympathy for China, believing that this matter is of great importance and is greatly concerned about the current situation in the Far East. However, the Soviet Union has decided not to take any measures or steps that would make the current situation even more difficult. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian TASS news agency officially denied today the rumor that Russian Army Commissar Voroshilov flew to the Far East yesterday, saying that Voroshilov inspected troops in Moscow today. Also, the statement that Russia cannot continue to stand by and remain indifferent to the Manchurian incident has given rise to the impression that Russia will intervene, but Russian authorities now want to dispel this impression, saying that it is not consistent with the truth. (Reuter's telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Reports say that the Soviet Russian labor community regards Japan's occupation of Manchuria as an act of imperialist aggression and military oppression. Workers around the world express sympathy for Chinese workers who are being trampled under the iron heels of imperialists. The Soviet Russian authorities are paying close attention to the US attitude. The US government's invocation of the Washington Treaty for sanctions has attracted the attention of high-ranking officials here. A Soviet Russian newspaper featured the headlines "Geneva is Numb" and "Despicable Farce," saying that the League of Nations' resolution has only allowed the Japanese army to destroy peace and expand its occupation.

<p>(Beijing) The Japanese Embassy stated today that the Southern Manchuria Railway area is different from the Chinese Eastern Railway area. Japan enjoys treaty rights to station troops in the Southern Manchuria Railway area, so the Japanese army will not depart from the Chinese Eastern Railway line except when the lives of Japanese people are in imminent danger. The Japanese army has not been sent to Harbin. Although bombs were thrown into Japanese banks and consulates in Harbin, the Chinese authorities have guaranteed the safety of Japanese residents, so the Japanese consul has not requested troops. Chinese newspapers reported that there was fighting in Jilin, but the Japanese Embassy denied this news and stated that it did not know about Zhang Zongchang's arrival in Beijing.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Japanese Should Examine Themselves (2) <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese economy is riddled with a thousand holes and a hundred wounds, as described in yesterday's commentary. Next, the political situation is also fraught with crises and extremely pessimistic. The political organization of Japan is inherently chaotic. There is the Emperor, who oversees all affairs of state, and the Cabinet, which assists the Emperor in planning various policies. However, there is also another force that manipulates the Emperor and the Cabinet from behind the scenes. This force is the Genro (elder statesmen). The formation of a cabinet must be recommended by the Genro. Government measures must be approved by the Genro. If the Genro declares a vote of no confidence, the Cabinet will immediately collapse. During the Taisho era, figures like Yamagata Aritomo and Matsukata Masayoshi, as well as the current Saionji Kinmochi, all possessed great power of control. Even the ambitious Tanaka Giichi had to lower his head and humble himself before the Genro, consulting them on every matter. For example, the recent formation of the Wakatsuki Cabinet and the appointment of Ugaki Kazushige as Governor-General of Korea both required Saionji's recommendation. The Genro's control over politics has led politicians to become accustomed to the art of flattery and ingratiation, which has resulted in rampant bribery and the subversion of the law. Examples include the Kanda scandal during the Wakatsuki Cabinet, the 3 million yen problem and the secret funds problem during the Tanaka Cabinet, and the three major bribery cases during the Hamaguchi Cabinet. This is one of the crises in Japanese politics. Even more serious is that within the Japanese political organization, there are two extremely obvious centers of power that are constantly vying for influence. One is the civilian cabinet government, and the other is the military clique government. Since Yamagata Aritomo and Katsura Taro, the Japanese military and political organization has followed the German dualistic military and political system. The organization of military command is independent of ordinary military administration. The naval command is separate from the Naval General Staff. In addition, there is the Marshal's Office and the Military Advisory Council, which serve as advisory bodies for military affairs. These four bodies constitute the so-called "Curtain-Drawn Memorial" mechanism, which is tantamount to forming an arrogant, lawless, unreasonable, and arbitrary military clique government. The so-called "Curtain-Drawn Memorial" means that it can directly petition the Emperor for approval without the resolution of the cabinet ministers. Its scope of power is actually limited to military command, that is, the so-called military order power, and has no power to involve military administration. However, in reality, the tyrannical military cliques often arbitrarily expand their power and even interfere in administration and diplomacy. For example, the Saionji Cabinet was overthrown by the military cliques for not approving the Minister of the Army Uehara Yusaku's proposal to add two divisions. For example, the Twenty-One Demands presented to China during the Okuma Cabinet were largely the result of the military cliques' advocacy. Examples include the two dispatches of troops to Shandong, the Huanggutun Incident, the recent Wanpaoshan Incident and the Korean Incident, and the current violent trampling on our Northeast, all of which are the result of the Japanese military cliques' unlimited expansion of their power. The Cabinet is one government, and the Curtain-Drawn Memorial mechanism is also a government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has diplomacy, and the General Staff Headquarters also has diplomacy. Policies come from multiple sources, and the Cabinet and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are often subjected to the oppression of the military cliques. The Hamaguchi Cabinet was blamed, and Foreign Minister Shidehara Kijuro was attacked, all of which were caused by these arbitrary military cliques. Mr. Soejima Michimasa once said, "Japan's diplomacy towards China can be summed up in one sentence: it is nothing more than the politics of a faction of the Japanese military." His words are very appropriate. This kind of dual government organization not only allows the military cliques to engage in dictatorship and govern by violence, but also allows the military cliques to achieve their ambitions, engage in endless wars, and promote their militaristic characteristics without limit. It is even enough to accelerate the downfall of this small island nation with its fragile foundation. Just look at the recent speeches of Minister of the Army Minami Jiro, which are arrogant and domineering, trampling on everything. He dispatched troops to our Northeast without waiting for the Cabinet's decision, acting freely. The politics of the military cliques is like a blazing fire, with its flames blazing brightly and being extremely hot. If the fire continues to burn, I dare say that it will eventually burn itself. This is another crisis in Japanese politics. In addition, the parliamentary politics of the Japanese political parties is really nothing more than a weapon for capitalists to fight each other. The capitalists each take their own interests as the premise, so they suppress the labor movement domestically and advocate aggression abroad, advocating the development of national power by force, which is enough to fuel the arrogance of the military cliques. This is the third crisis in Japanese politics. In summary, it can be seen that Japanese politics has recently lost its normal state. Both domestic and foreign affairs have been hijacked by violence and cannot enter the right track. Some say that the recent atrocities of the Japanese military clique in our Northeast are a prelude to preparing to overthrow the cabinet. These words are credible. However, the ambitions of the Japanese military cliques are just beginning to rise. A madman is riding an untamed horse, galloping wildly. There is a deep abyss in front of him, but he does not care at all. The danger of Japanese politics is obvious to all, even without the knowledge of the insightful.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The rumor that Jiang had sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang is not confirmed. A certain Central Committee member said that Jiang did not send such a telegram. Zhang's views on Japan have long been consistent with the central government and he will definitely not be coerced by Japan. There is no need for Jiang's telegram.

<h3 id="e30">Reports on the Progress of Negotiations <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting met with reporters this afternoon and reported (1) that the tense situation in the case of the Japanese army's atrocities in the Eastern Provinces in the past two days has been seen in various newspapers and will not be reported again. After this incident occurred, the Japanese side clearly violated the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty of the Washington Conference, believing that this move by the Japanese side violated world-recognized treaties or agreements. Therefore, the National Government has formally submitted a request to the League of Nations and all countries that have signed the Anti-War Pact, requesting that it be handled fairly in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant and the Anti-War Pact. After this case was submitted, the Administrative Council of the League of Nations formally resolved three points the day before yesterday, and the Chairman of the Council, Spanish Foreign Minister Lele, formally notified the Chinese government. The National Government has now telegraphed a reply to Lele, expressing acceptance of the resolutions of each case and stating that in this incident, the Chinese army did not occupy the other party's territory at all. All troop movements were also non-resistance actions under orders. It should be requested to continue to handle this matter. According to the League of Nations' handling of disputes between the two countries over the years, there are precedents to follow, one being Paraguay and Bolivia, two being Poland and Lithuania, and three being Greece and Bulgaria, all of which have been handled accordingly. The solution in each case is nothing more than (1) both sides stop military actions and return to their original defenses, (2) send personnel to investigate the situation, and (3) make a decision based on the investigation report. Now, our country's request to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations to continue to proceed is to ask it to implement the above two or three methods. (2) After Shenyang was forcibly occupied by the Japanese, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made two emergency protests. Recently, it received reports that Jilin, Changchun, Andong, and other places were also forcibly occupied by the Japanese army. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a third emergency protest yesterday. (3) Ambassador Jiang Zuobin has arrived in Japan to take office. After Wang finished reporting, reporters asked: 1. If the Japanese still ignore the three protests that have been lodged against Japan, does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have other more effective methods? Wang replied that protest is a legitimate diplomatic procedure. Now that this matter has been submitted to the League of Nations, it should be viewed in terms of how the League of Nations and the countries of the Anti-War Pact are proceeding. If the Japanese side does not accept the resolution of the League of Nations, the League of Nations will have a second and third step method, so this case can only be handled by the League of Nations at present and cannot be directly negotiated. The reporters also asked whether it was true that the Japanese army had a plan to automatically withdraw to the railway area. Wang replied that it has not been verified. 2. Was it a fact that Chongguang visited Finance Minister Song in Shanghai early on the 19th and Song said that the Dong Province incident could be negotiated directly between China and Japan? Wang replied that when Chongguang met Song, he did raise this idea. At that time, because the truth was not clear and it was thought to be a minor conflict, Song once said that it could be considered. A day or two later, he sent someone to inquire Song again. Song strictly refused, saying that this incident was not a minor conflict and of course could not be negotiated directly. 3. It is heard that the League of Nations will convene the Council again to discuss the China-Japan incident. Has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report? Wang replied that there was a report, but the date was still unknown. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the rumor that the Ministry's reply to the international telegram contained a statement that it was a conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops, which reduced Japan's responsibility, was not true. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>

<p>Disguised Incitement of Riots</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain agency received a confidential report stating that the Japanese consulate in Jinan received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that country on the afternoon of the 21st, instructing it to hire more personnel and go to various places to collect various anti-Japanese slogans, and to incite workers in Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places to create an actual riot against Japan in the future to use as an excuse. On the evening of the 20th, a large number of military uniforms, collars, and identification badges of the Northeast Army and the Lu Army were sent from the Kwantung side, instructing the consuls in Jinan to distribute them to the Japanese merchants residing in the area in order to pretend to be our country's soldiers and create false evidence of killing Japanese and Korean residents. Furthermore, it secretly hired communist bandits from Shanghai to come to Jinan and Qingdao to carry out arson against Japanese residents to create an excuse for dispatching troops. Now, the central government has ordered the relevant local authorities to pay attention to this matter. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>

<p>A Glimpse of American Public Opinion</p>
<p>New York The New York branch of the National News Agency compiled the opinions of major American newspapers today, all of which disapproved of the Japanese military's invasion in Manchuria. For example, the New York Morning Post said that although the Japanese wear modern European clothes, they have not changed their old habits. While Western countries are making every effort to help this once greatest country, Japan suddenly rose up to seize Shenyang by force. This kind of treacherous action that loses international trust has not completely washed away the chieftain's nature of the past. The New York World Telegram said that Japan's war against China violates the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Two years ago, the country had asked Soviet Russia to explain the reasons for invading Chinese land in northern Manchuria. Now Japan has committed the greatest crime of aggressive war in modern history. If the U.S. government is willing to protect its honor in the Kellogg Pact and the Washington Treaty, it should take action and immediately join the treaty countries to demand that Japan withdraw its troops and restore the original state. If necessary, it can come forward alone. The New York Lectures and Guidance Report said that there is now various evidence that can show that the Japanese atrocities in Manchuria were planned in advance by the leaders of the Japanese military.

<p>(Berlin) The semi-official Diplomatic Political Daily published an article. The attitude of the German authorities towards the Sino-Japanese dispute can be seen in it. The article stated that as far as the current situation in Manchuria is concerned, it cannot be called a war. At least one party must truly want to go to war before it can become a war. Now, both China and Japan clearly do not want to go to war. Although the Japanese army is flexing its muscles, it does not dare to offend the world and promote a war. The League of Nations should spare no effort to eliminate this unfortunate and dangerous conflict. The fate of the League of Nations itself is tied to Manchuria, because if it cannot fulfill its responsibility for this major event, its prestige will be swept away.

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian telegraphed from Yantai, reporting that since the Japanese army forcibly occupied the eastern provinces, the public here has been extremely indignant, and the defense of Jiaodong has become increasingly tense.

The Japanese consul has indicated his agreement. This command is making every effort to maintain local security and is also paying special attention to protecting foreigners, reducing the central government's concerns. At this time of serious diplomatic crisis and important national defense, it is deeply feared that distant rumors will cause confusion. This telegram is sent to inform you. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Plan to Organize Party Affairs Unification Committee</p>
<p>To Resolve All Party Disputes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before Cai Yuanpei and Zhang Ji departed, the key figures held detailed talks on the Guangdong negotiation issues.

Regarding the Third Plenary Session, the National Assembly, and the Standing Committee of the Provisional Constitution, there were listed terms to be examined and deliberated on. This side believes that since Guangdong has withdrawn its troops and abandoned the issue of individuals, there is a possibility of rapprochement. It has entrusted Cai Yuanpei and Zhang Ji to go and sincerely state that with the urgent foreign threat, conditions and formalities should be omitted. Come here to Nanjing. Significant concessions can be made, and members of previous Central Committees and comrades, regardless of any small organizations, whether left or right, are all invited to come to Nanjing to jointly discuss national affairs. Before the opening of the Representative Assembly, a preparatory meeting can be held in Shanghai first, and a Party Affairs Unification Committee can be organized to resolve all party disputes in that meeting, and then the Representative Assembly will be held to produce the next Central Committee. This is roughly the plan. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Labour Party Issues a Political Program</p>
<p>Actively Preparing for the Election</p>
<p>London, 23rd Reuters - Baldwin stated in the House of Commons today that the government had issued an instruction to Lord Cecil, permitting him to accept the proposal by French Foreign Minister Briand for an immediate cessation of the arms program pending the proposals of the Disarmament Conference, but this would only be effective after other countries had accepted it uniformly. Baldwin also stated that he could declare that, barring unforeseen circumstances, the British government would not increase the army and air force expenditures for the 1932-33 fiscal year. According to a Geneva Reuters report, British representative Cecil reported at a League of Nations meeting today that Britain had accepted the French Foreign Minister's proposal and asked all countries to declare their opinions on this peace effort by November 1st. The ambassadors to Belgium and America have accepted the proposal for an immediate cessation of arms on behalf of the United States. The only countries that have not yet agreed are Japan and Poland. The Japanese representative argued that the matter should be discussed by the Disarmament Conference. The Polish representative said that Poland must obtain full guarantees from its neighboring countries.</p>
<p>London, 24th Reuters - According to general opinion, a general election will be held soon. The Labour Party is now preparing for an election contest. The Labour Party newspaper disclosed the Labour Party's election platform today: (1) Consistent opposition to tax rates, (2) Rebuilding industry and agriculture, (3) Abolishing indemnities and war debts, (4) Rapid implementation of disarmament, (5) Management of banks and finance. A Conservative Party newspaper predicted today that if a general election were held immediately, the Labour Party would lose 100 seats. The Liberal Party is now preparing everything. It is heard that the Liberal Party is unanimously opposed to socialism, and most of the party's members of parliament are prepared to recognize tax rates when necessary. Prime Minister MacDonald is recuperating in the countryside due to overwork. There should be new developments on this matter after his return to London.</p>

<p>Telegram from the Chinese Students Club of Wooster College to the Shen Bao: Please forward to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. World opinion is that negotiations should not be conducted directly with Japan.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Chinese Students Club of Washington to the Shen Bao: Please forward to the National Government. If justice is not upheld, we will fight Japan to the death.</p>
<p>Telegram from Paris to the Shen Bao and to all comrades from all sectors and parties of the country: Xiang Ning left the country two years ago, and her weak body can hardly support her. Hearing of the floods and tens of millions of disaster victims wandering and losing their homes, her heart is saddened and her eyes are full of tragedy. Who can surpass this extreme? All who have blood and conscience, who can be without feelings, how can they explain themselves? Recently, I also heard that Japanese imperialists have occupied Shenyang and Changchun. The Premier has long recognized the conspiracy of imperialism, so the reorganization in 1924 united small and weak nations to resist. In recent years, our party has disintegrated, and there have been frequent wars, causing the people to wither and be scattered. At this time of internal and external troubles, how can we delay and burn the beanstalk to cook the beans? How should we strive to make up for past mistakes, rescue the disaster victims, and jointly resist foreign aggression to save the country and party from the disaster of destruction? 何香凝 [He Xiangning's name].</p>
<p>Telegram from Luzhou to all newspaper offices: Our association has raised over a thousand yuan from various sectors in the local area and will remit it to the National Relief Committee in a few days. Special mention. The Hefei Sixth Middle School Flood Relief Association kowtows.</p>
<p>Telegram from Yangzhou to all newspaper offices: Recently, we read Deputy Commander Zhang Hao's telegram, stating that Japanese soldiers have been acting freely in Shenyang, occupying cities, expelling officials, severing communications, killing soldiers and civilians, and destroying our troops and arsenals. Upon hearing this news, our hearts are filled with anger. All who have blood should seek self-preservation. If we do not plan in time, it will be impossible to recover. Therefore, we offer three points to inform the people of the country: First, we should be determined to fight to the death. The Japanese soldiers are tyrannical and practice aggression. The reason for this is that our country has always advocated peace and retreated in the face of events, causing imperialism to gain an inch and want a yard, and to apply the methods used against the Korean people to our country on a double scale. The people of our country are on the brink of national extinction, and there is no reason to endure and not resist. Even a trapped beast will fight, let alone humans. We should resolutely adopt the principle of拼命主義 [pin ming zhu yi; risking one's life] and fight to the end. In the American War of Independence, did they have a pre-determined chance of winning at the beginning? They only succeeded because of the unity of all and the shared hatred of the enemy. Moreover, at this time, our army has organization, our government orders are systematic, and all equipment is far superior to that of America in the past. If we can all hold the determination to have either us or the enemy, what enemy cannot be pushed back, what fortress cannot be conquered? Our people, let us rise up and plan for it. Second, internal strife should be stopped quickly, and we should unite to resist foreign aggression. With internal bandits spreading and poisoning the lives of the people, although we have suppressed them painfully, they have not been fundamentally eliminated. In addition, there are natural disasters and unprecedented catastrophes. Everywhere is full of mourning and people are waiting to be fed. Anyone with a conscience knows that the vitality of the country has been greatly damaged, and we cannot make more bean-cooking incidents to hasten our demise. Therefore, the first priority for saving the country today is to pray that all comrades and compatriots immediately abandon their prejudices, eliminate internal strife, and unite to overcome the national crisis. Time is not waiting for us. If we delay, we fear we will be too late. Third, saving the country and resisting the enemy must rely on self-improvement, not just hoping for foreign aid. This time, the Japanese soldiers advanced into Shenyang, Changchun, Andong, and other places, brazenly violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Their barbarism and tyranny are incomprehensible. Not only are they bullying our country, but they are also disregarding justice and public law. Although various countries in the world may speak out for justice and uphold public law when they see this atrocity, if we do not improve ourselves, but want to rely entirely on the help of others and侥倖圖存 [jiao xing tu cun; hope to survive by luck], how can this be reasonable? Heaven helps those who help themselves. We should learn from the ancient precepts. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone. We urge our compatriots to rise up and fight urgently to save us from today's crisis. Jiang and others have been in the army for decades and have received great favor from the country without repaying a single drop. Now that the great enemy is attacking horizontally and the country is pressed by disaster, we are willing to die in the front and fight to the death with the enemy to seek survival for the nation. We are armed and waiting for orders and will not hesitate to do our duty. We offer these pressing words and beg you to consider them. Zhang Zhijiang, Sun Lianzhong, Liang Guanying, Gao Shuxun, Guan Shuren, Dai Fanzhou, Zhang Zhankui, Zhang Huatang, Yang Tianbin, Wu Pengju, Zhao Ying, Li Songkun, Dong Zhentang, Ji Zhentong, Chi Fengcheng, Liu Guoming, Zheng Tingzhen, Wang Xiushen, Zhu Changde, Shi Dexue, together kowtow.</p>
<p>Telegram from Beiping to all newspaper offices: The Wokou [Japanese pirates, derogatory term for the Japanese] are rampant, forcibly occupying Liaoshen. Bad news is spreading, and the whole country is in grief and anger. At this critical time of survival, how should all Chinese people rise up and be雄 [xiong; powerful]? Those in the government and those who shoulder the heavy responsibility of governing the country only know to advise the people to endure insults and appeal for foreign aid as a long-term strategy for resisting the enemy. But they do not know that justice and humanity can defeat power, and that the League of Nations can guarantee peace. The Wokou would not dare to be so猖至此 [chang zhi ci; unbridled to this degree] . Even now, they do not know to awaken and rise up between the壇坫 [tan zhan; sacrificial altar; diplomatic place] to recover the country. Is this not the same as waiting for death? This is the extreme of foolishness. The only plan now is for people from all over the country to rise up together, supervise and urge the government to洗心革面 [xi xin ge mian; turn over a new leaf], actively improve, respect public opinion, and make big plans early so that the lifeline of the country can be extended, and there will still be a chance of success. We offer these pressing words and hope you will consider them. The faculty and staff of the Anti-Japanese Committee of the Faculty of Law of the National Beiping University salute.</p>
<p>Telegram from Bengbu to the Shen Bao to forward to students across the country: The Japanese army attacked our Northeast. All who have blood are rarely not髮指 [fa zhi; enraged]. In addition to establishing an anti-Japanese national salvation association to publicize the atrocities of the Japanese army, our school's students are also intensifying military training in preparation for declaring war on Japan. We will pour out our blood and brains and die ten thousand times without regret. We can't bear to send this telegram and are at a loss for words.

<p>Going to Liaoning for On-the-Spot Inspection</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent's Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Group of Nineteen People</p>
<p>News Heard Along the Way</p>
<p>It was reported that last night (the 18th), the Japanese army suddenly occupied Shenyang, cut off the BeiNing Railway, and guarded the transportation facilities. Only this morning at 6:00 AM did the Tianjin station of the BeiNing Railway Bureau receive a report. This shocking act, which violates international law, has spread throughout the city, causing widespread tension. Therefore, I decided to immediately go to Liaoning to investigate the truth. At 11:30 AM, I arrived at the East Station and saw seventeen reporters from various newspapers arriving, as if by agreement. There was also one reporter each from the English-language North China Star and the English-language Times, showing that Westerners are paying close attention to Japan's violent actions. On the platform, there were over a hundred Japanese people boarding a train to Tanggu, which was quite noticeable. After investigation, it was learned that they were returning to their country under orders from their government, preparing to organize a reserve army. As the train was about to depart, twenty or thirty Japanese women waved handkerchiefs and cheered, seemingly wishing them well on their return to the military. On the train, I met a certain official from the Railway Bureau, who said that at 10:00 PM last night, a company of the Japanese garrison stationed in Shenyang took a train from the South Manchuria Railway Station to HuangguTun (the site where Zhang Zuolin was assassinated in the 17th year of the Republic) and dismantled the tracks. Another unit of the Japanese army opened fire and attacked Beida Camp. Our Northeast Army endured in silence, not firing a single shot in return. The Japanese army occupied the commercial district, guarded transportation facilities to prevent the news from leaking, and attacked the Beida Camp arsenal and mortar factory. This was the situation before 5:00 AM this morning. However, this kind of action by the Japanese army had become an open secret five days ago. The Northeast authorities maintained a calm attitude. Until last night and this morning, the Japanese army bombarded Beida Camp with artillery. The extent of casualties and losses of our army is unknown, but it is known that the Second Division stationed in Liaoyang is rushing to Shenyang, arbitrarily harassing people along the way. It is also heard that the Japanese army occupied Yingkou last night and kidnapped Station Master Wang. At 4:00 PM, the train passed through Luanzhou. According to news from the station, the Japanese fleet anchored in Lushun received an emergency mobilization order last night and is expected to arrive in Tianjin tonight or tomorrow morning. According to general observation, the arrival of the Japanese fleet in Tianjin is merely a means of intimidation against us. Since Tianjin and Gugu are major ports in the north and the focus of international attention, they presumably dare not openly occupy them. However, as the Japanese army's arrogance is on the rise, there may be provocations against us in the future.</p>
<p>In the dining car, I also met Noguchi Norikiyo, a reporter from the Japanese Asahi Shimbun. He saw that we looked uneasy and asked whether our trip was voluntary or coerced, and whether the Municipal Party Department and the Deputy Commander's Headquarters were sending people. I told him that our trip was entirely voluntary and that there were no personnel from the Municipal Party Department or the Deputy Commander's Headquarters on this train. After the meal, I proposed organizing a group action. It was decided to form the News Reporter Shenyang Incident Investigation Group, and Panalulu, a reporter from the English-language Beijing-Tianjin Times, was elected as the group leader; Hu Shirong, a reporter from the North China Star, was elected as the English interpreter; Wang Jian, a reporter from the Yishi Daily, was elected as the Japanese interpreter.</p>

Finally, Asahi reporter Noguchi expressed his willingness to introduce us to the Japanese Consul General in Liaoning, Hayashi Kyujiro, and the Commander of the South Manchuria Garrison Army, Honjo Shigeru, which was approved by the group. The names of the reporters are listed below: Zhu Xiaofu, Tianjin correspondent for the Shanghai Shen Bao; Xu Zhushi, Tianjin correspondent for the Xinwen Bao; Plante, China correspondent for the German Berliner Tageblatt; Wang Songnian, Tianjin correspondent for the Dagong Bao; Wang Tingshen and Wang Jian, reporters for the Yishi Daily; Deng Xizhang and Ni Huanzhang, reporters for the Yong Bao; Hu Shirong, reporter for the English-language North China Star; Li Yizan, reporter for the Shang Bao; Wang Zhuoyuan, reporter for the Minguo Daily; Yao Baolian, reporter for the Guowen News Agency; Panalulu, reporter for the English-language Beijing-Tianjin Times; Kleinert, Wittich, and Ma Shifu, reporters for the German-Chinese Daily; Zhang Chuzhen, reporter for the Guomin News Agency; Jin Huaixia, reporter for the Duowen News Agency; Yang Huinong, reporter for the Fudan News Agency; and nineteen others.</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM, the train passed through Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan. Armed Japanese soldiers patrolled the platforms with loaded guns, acting arrogantly. Upon inquiry, the stationmaster said that the long-distance telephone on this line can only reach Goubangzi, while telegrams can still reach HuangguTun. The situation in Shenyang is unclear, but Yingkou has indeed been occupied by the Japanese army. The city's police and training camps have been disarmed. Twelve miles away from Yingkou, the tracks have been destroyed, and landmines have been planted near Dawa Station. Railway employees have been kidnapped. At the same time, Haicheng has also been occupied. Yang, the chief of the Yingkou section, heard the news in Goubangzi and took train No. 106 to Beijing at noon to report to Director Gao Jiyi. (The above is news obtained from stations along the BeiNing Railway on the 19th, written on the train.)</p>
<p>After the train passed Suizhong, I lay down to sleep, but I couldn't fall asleep because my mind was too stimulated. At 0:30 AM on the 20th, we arrived in Jinzhou. Sun Aiting, a counselor from the Jilin Provincial Government, boarded the train to Liaoning. Sun is an old friend of mine, so I asked him about the situation in Shenyang. He said that the Japanese army began military action at 10:00 PM on the 18th, first destroying the Liukong Bridge between HuangguTun and Shenyang on the BeiNing Railway, and then firing shots into the air. Rong Zhen, Director of the Military Affairs Department of the Northeast Commander's Office, and Zang Shiyi, Chairman of the Provincial Government, immediately went to meet Consul General Hayashi, telling him that if there were any problems, they could be discussed. They asked who would be responsible for the nighttime shelling, which could cause misunderstandings. Hayashi replied that the shelling would stop in five minutes. Unexpectedly, Rong and Zang were detained and not released until 3:00 AM on the 19th, while the sound of artillery never stopped throughout the night. Shells landed on the ammunition depot of Beida Camp, causing an explosion. The Third Brigade of the Liaoning garrison, under Wang Yizhe, adopted a policy of non-resistance and never fired a single shot in return. A certain regimental commander was shot and wounded by the Japanese army, and there are rumors that Wang Yizhe was also killed. After the Japanese army began military action, they occupied the commercial district and attacked the city of Shenyang. Fearing a repeat of the Jinan May 3rd Incident, the local authorities immediately opened the city gates, and the Japanese army poured in, occupying the Northeast Commander's Office, the Deputy Commander's Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Provincial Government, the Telephone Bureau, the Telegraph Bureau, the Radio Station, and other institutions. They disarmed the guards and replaced them with Japanese soldiers, prohibiting people from leaving. After the Japanese army occupied the city of Shenyang, they divided their forces and exited the East Gate. One route attacked the Northeast Arsenal, and the other attacked the Jiangwutang Military Academy. The arsenal was occupied without resistance. The mortar factory, not having received orders from their superiors, refused to open its doors. The Japanese army immediately launched an attack. The guards inside the factory, for self-defense, initially returned fire, but after receiving orders from their superiors not to resist, they opened the factory gates. The Japanese soldiers then entered and carried out a massacre to vent their anger. The Northeast Jiangwutang Military Academy was also occupied without resistance. At the same time, the residences of various generals and leaders of various institutions were guarded by Japanese soldiers, allowing entry but not exit. Therefore, Director Rong and Zang Zhangxi lost their freedom of movement. The area east of the railway along HuangguTun is within the Japanese military's restricted zone. Vegetable vendors and merchants west of the railway can enter the restricted zone after inspection, but those within the restricted zone are not allowed to cross the railway to the west. Since the Japanese soldiers have cut off communication facilities and prohibited Chinese from leaving the restricted area, their intention is to prevent the leakage of their brutal actions. After 8:00 AM on the 19th, news from Shenyang was completely cut off, and the situation is unknown. One battalion of the Third Brigade stationed in HuangguTun, due to its isolation and weakness, took a train west at 8:30 AM and arrived in Jinzhou at 10:00 PM. At 8:40 AM, six Japanese soldiers took an electric handcar to XinminTun, four of them entering the Japanese Consulate, and the other two returning to HuangguTun. It is said that those who went to XinminTun were conveying the order of Japanese Army Commander Honjo, ordering the local veterans to assemble and await orders. Telegrams from Jilin, Changchun, and other places have also been completely cut off since 8:00 AM. Zhang Zuoxiang, Chairman of Jilin Province, returned to his ancestral home in Jinzhou due to his father's death. He has received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang, ordering that no matter how the Japanese army oppresses us, our army is not allowed to resist. At the same time, he ordered the 12th Brigade stationed in Jinzhou, under Zhang Jianxu, to move to the Shanhaiguan-Qinhuangdao area, which has already been dispatched. Sun was ordered by Zhang Zuoxiang to go to Shenyang to meet Consul General Hayashi and investigate the situation after the incident. The train stopped before reaching Goubangzi and was met by another train from XinminTun. According to people at the station, the situation in Shenyang is chaotic, and many of our soldiers, police, and civilians have been massacred by the Japanese army.

<h3 id="e83">Letter from the Kunshan County Field Tax Collection Office <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>To the editor, I recently read a news item in the local correspondence column of your newspaper on the 20th of this month, entitled "A Shocking Case of Embezzlement of National Taxes." After reading it, I was shocked. Although our office gives receipts to the business owners first and exchanges them for grain certificates in the following year due to procedural reasons, there has never been a situation where taxes have been paid without grain certificates being given. Moreover, since the business owners are given grain certificates in the following year, how can there be grain certificates listed as civil debts after the exemption? Since there are no grain certificates listed as civil debts, how can such a large sum of money be embezzled? This is self-evident. Since the order was received in the 16th year of the Republic to handle all civil debts from the 4th year to the 15th year, our office immediately collected all the uncompleted grain certificates, compiled a list, and reported it to the Finance Bureau, which was clearly supervised and turned over to the Provincial Department for verification. It has been several years since then, and suddenly this news item was discovered. It is clearly a fabrication, intended to confuse the public, put people in an embarrassing position, and attempt to extort money. Because the matter is important, I have written to your newspaper in particular, hoping that it will be corrected. I am grateful for this. Respectfully, the Kunshan County Field Tax Collection Office, September 23rd.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Team's Lun Keung Not Coming Due to Illness</p>
<p>Shanghai Team's Lin Qiu May Not Be Able to Attend</p>
<p>| Balance of Power Between the Two Sides May Be Affected |</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport tennis match is scheduled to be held in early October. The Hong Kong team is scheduled to travel north on the Hoover President on the 29th of this month.</p>
<p>Damage to Hong Kong Team's Strength: The Hong Kong team's lineup initially included Lun Keung, the strongest player on the island. Now, however, due to heart enlargement pain, he has stopped coming to Shanghai. Doctors have instructed him to rest for at least three weeks. The Hong Kong team's strength has been greatly damaged as a result. The current lineup has been changed to Lo Man-wai (captain), Fenn, He Jialiu, and Ye Jun four people. The women's team will come along, and is quite strong, being Mrs. Tottenham, Ms. Lo and four others.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team's Organization: The Hong Kong team will be organized with Fenn as the first singles player. Fenn and Lo Man-wai will be paired in one doubles match. The other two singles matches will likely be Lo Man-wai and He Jialiu. The women's team is likely to be unbeatable by Shanghai.</p>
<p>Lin Qiu May Not Attend: Lun Keung's absence has affected the Hong Kong team, but it is also feared that Lin Lang and De Fu of the Shanghai team will also be unable to attend. It is said that the regulations stipulate that representatives must reside in their representative area for at least one year. Therefore, the Shanghai team may be represented by Hyakuseki Yu, Canavero, and Wheat. The strength of both sides may therefore be more balanced.</p>

<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, what day is today? Are you still joyfully celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival and eating mooncakes? When you take a round mooncake in your hand, you should think that our Republic of China was originally also round, like this mooncake. When you put it in your mouth to eat, you should think that the brutal sun (Japan) is treating our country like you eating this mooncake. The three northeastern provinces have been occupied, like a big corner bitten off the mooncake. Then, bite by bite, the mooncake will be eaten up, and our Republic of China will be finished. Alas, pitiful motherland, why are you fated like a mooncake?</p>

<h3 id="e102">Fake Good People <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>When Yan Xizhai was sixteen years old, his adoptive grandfather, Zhu Weng, wanted to bribe someone to get him a Xiucai degree. He cried so much that he refused to eat, saying, "I would rather be a true commoner than a fake scholar." We should all have this kind of spirit. One day, I was on the tram, carrying only two double coins (shuang jiaozi). I took them out to buy a ticket, but the ticket seller said, "Copper coins are no good." I had to get off and walk. Fake coins cause so much trouble, how much more fake people? Fake coins cannot be used, but fake people can get by. Why is that? True villains are easy to know, but hypocrites are hard to guard against. They look real but also somewhat fake; they sound fake but also somewhat real. Truth mixed with falsehood, and falsehood resembling truth. It confuses people, making it impossible to distinguish. How difficult it is to be in a fake society! Last summer, I wrote ten short poems about fake good people, with the intention of advising the world and encouraging myself. The wording may be excessive, but with sincere enthusiasm, I hope everyone will reform and create a bright and upright true world together. Forgive me or condemn me, let the people judge.</p>
<p>(1) Fake Good People</p>
<p>Why is the world so bad?</p>
<p>Bad because of fake good people.</p>
<p>Saying one thing but meaning another:</p>
<p>Though they are people, they are not!</p>
<p>(2) Fake Father and Son</p>
<p>Fake father and son!</p>
<p>Money is the father.</p>
<p>Calling "Papa" with their mouths,</p>
<p>Cursing him to die in their hearts.</p>
<p>(3) Fake Mother and Daughter</p>
<p>Fake mother and daughter,</p>
<p>Raising a daughter like raising a pig.</p>
<p>Whoever has more money,</p>
<p>Can buy the fat pig.</p>
<p>(4) Fake Husband and Wife</p>
<p>Fake husband and wife,</p>
<p>Appearing harmonious but their hearts are apart.</p>
<p>The wife sleeps with another man;</p>
<p>The husband visits prostitutes.</p>
<p>(5) Fake Lovers</p>
<p>Fake lovers,</p>
<p>Becoming strangers once they let go of hands.</p>
<p>Meeting a new stranger,</p>
<p>They become the one they desire again.</p>
<p>(6) Fake Friends</p>

<h3 id="e103">Lament for the Three Northeastern Provinces <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Duke Xiang of Song valued benevolence and brought about his own demise. Why do men wear military uniforms? Sleeping soundly by the bedside for so long, one night, the dove occupied the nest so arrogantly. Last night, the north wind opened the door, and 100,000 Japanese devils swept in. The artillery bombardment was fierce, and thunderbolts struck the sky. Shenyang, Jilin, and Changchun fell one after another, and Huanggu and Xinmin were repeatedly destroyed. How much is left of the three northeastern provinces? The killing and burning continue unabated. Princes were killed and officials were slaughtered, how cruel to these sons of Heaven. Turning back to the Northeast, murderous intent rises. The strong prey on the weak, who pities them? There is no justice in this world, justice depends on military strength. Alas, justice depends on military strength.</p>
<p>From September 19th of this year, Tianjian has withdrawn from the China-Japan Art Comrades Association. I do not wish to be informed of any future actions of the association, and I hope the association will no longer contact me by letter. Everyone has their own ambitions, let us not interfere with each other.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Anecdotes of Ding Ruchang <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War, Liu Gong Island, a small place with black bullets, was held against the Japanese army. When ammunition and supplies were exhausted, the situation became critical. He wanted to seek a way out of certain death, hoping that victory would benefit the country and defeat would only harm himself. He called himself unyielding, and was truly worthy of praise. He eventually reached a point where there was no advance or retreat, no different from the defeat of the Nine Jiedushi at Xiangzhou. He died with his ambition unfulfilled, and was also burdened with a bad name, with no way to defend himself. Such was Ding Ruchang. When the Japanese army occupied Liu Gong Island, the remains of Ding Ruchang were carried onto the Kangji Wheel by the Japanese, who even fired cannons in salute, showing great respect. The spirit of loyalty and courage touches people, even enemies are no different. But when the hearse returned south, not only were those who saw it sneering, but even pointing fingers and calling him a traitor who lost the army and disgraced the country. This shows the national sentiment at the time. However, Ding, because his soldiers did not obey orders, committed suicide by taking poison, sacrificing himself. After his death, the soldiers began to surrender. This means that the intention to surrender must not have come from the Commander of the Navy. This is very clear. Alas, in times of peace, they enjoy high salaries, but when things get urgent, they are like in a dream and cannot save the situation, even surrendering the army to the enemy. Compared to Ding's death, those who willingly sacrifice themselves, how can the difference be measured?</p>
<p>When Ding was committing suicide, he was still cursing a certain high official. Because his telegram requesting battle had just been sent, he received a hand-written order forbidding him to send troops and not to leave Weihai for even one step. If he violated it, he would be punished even if he won. This constraint led to his being trapped by the enemy and eventually defeated. At that time, there was the Beiyang Minister and the Naval Yamen. Their powers were mixed and did not benefit the situation. A scholar told Jin Wuzhu, "With powerful ministers inside, no general can achieve merit outside." I say the same about Ding. The Sino-Japanese War was nearly forty years ago, and the cunning of our eastern neighbor is even worse than before. In the face of foreign aggression, I recall the events of Lord Ding, also to encourage those who take up arms for the country.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Chain of Happiness in National Crisis <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>The Japanese took advantage of our natural disaster to launch a military campaign, forcibly occupying our territory, burning and killing our soldiers and civilians, trampling on our institutions, and detaining and humiliating our officials. The shocking news spread, making people's eyes split and their hair stand on end. Our five internal organs were destroyed and torn apart. The whole country was in shock and anger, extremely sad. Every descendant of the Yellow Emperor wants to wash away this shame. A certain gentleman from the Shanghai Municipal Government, heartbroken, created a new Chain of Happiness and sent it to friends, hoping to encourage them and show his determination to endure hardship and bide his time. I will record the words below, hoping that all readers of the newspaper will work together. The words say: "The brutal Japanese, taking advantage of our country's natural and man-made disasters, disregarding justice, brazenly sent troops and forcibly occupied our important ports such as Shenyang and Changchun. Wherever their iron hooves go, the rivers and mountains change color. Alas, the compatriots of the Northeast have become slaves of a lost country. At this critical moment, at this moment of national life and death, we should struggle together, holding the following resolutions: (1) Never buy Japanese goods.</p>
<p>(2) Adhere to the principle of non-cooperation.</p>
<p>(3) Strive to fulfill the duties of a citizen, be loyal and diligent, serve society, and dedicate ourselves to the country.</p>
<p>(4) Practice the Premier's teachings: "Loyalty, Filial Piety, Benevolence, Love, Faith, Righteousness, Harmony, and Peace."</p>
<p>(5) Sweep away selfish desires and make national welfare and people's interests the premise of everything.</p>
<p>Please, after receiving this letter, no matter how busy you are, copy ten copies within twenty-four hours and send them to your closest friends and relatives. Guarantee that you will have a life of abundance, happiness everywhere, and eternal peace. Many children and grandchildren. Otherwise, great disaster will befall you, your family will be destroyed, you will be left without descendants, and you will live in a human hell.</p>

<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>Our country is suffering from internal troubles, and natural disasters have suddenly arisen. Deaths and displacements are countless. Just when we are saving the dying and rescuing the wounded, Japan openly uses violence to occupy our three northeastern provinces, burning, looting, and killing, with no trace of humanity. This is an undeclared war, directly regarding our nation-state as nothing. Shame and humiliation are greater than this. All...</p>
<h3 id="e107">Records of Things Seen and Heard in the Former Capital <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>The Underlay Money</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government. In the Tang Zhenyuan thirteenth year, eunuchs used palace markets to buy things, still asking for tribute door and foot money. Hu notes. Tribute door refers to the fact that all doors passed by the tribute have expenses, like the guiding fee during the reign of Emperor Ling of Han. In the old days, officials inside and outside the capital used openers. (commonly known as door people) The Bunjia asked for bribery from those who wanted to see them. The most evil habit was called the door package. Even the palace was no exception, and it was even worse. Looking at this, it has been a long time. Most of the door people are northerners. Every time the capital is simplified, they interact and solicit. The poles are woven like looms. They all hope to follow, regarding it as a source of profit. Even if there are people of integrity who want to ban it, they will say that we rely on this for a living. Otherwise, who would be willing to travel thousands of miles to follow us? The situation is like this. There is nothing to be done. Those who love themselves only strictly order these people not to extort. Foreign officials are fine. Beijing officials are especially poor. What their family depends on is only the disciples and old officials who come to see them. Knocking on the door and gifting them with a few gold coins. However, they can never rely on their power to demand as foreign officials can. In addition to the door package, the underlay money is the big source. The underlay money is that when the owner buys something, they ask to keep 2% of the price when paying the money to lubricate the family. This is the common practice that has been followed. If there are exceptional demands, there will be no end. Therefore, buying things from the store must be more expensive than the servants buying them. This is because the store has prepared a place in advance. This is also what the Tang people called the door, under the Beijing officials. This is where the greedy maggots gather. The official so the officialdom is not clear, and the capital is ruined. These people have lost their reliance. However, the custom of underlay money cannot be changed. In recent years, however, the cleaning money for renting a house has no longer been seen. The cleaning money is that every time a lease is made, the landlord and the tenant's servants each get one month's rent and divide it. The tea money is called three shares. The tea money is that the first month of renting a house must pay an extra month's rent as a deposit. When the contract is terminated, you can live for one more month without paying rent. This is because there are fewer residents every day, and the landlord has to demote himself. Otherwise, no one will ask about it. Looking at this, the atmosphere of the old capital will gradually become simple and simple. The old customs will eventually become relics.</p>
<p>Those with blood and qi, who would not regard it as an irreconcilable enemy? How should we think of our great rivers and mountains, about to fall under the iron hooves of the Japanese? How should we think of the current national crisis of our nation, with life at stake, and cut ourselves to the bone, bursting out hot blood? But things are not like that. At this moment of life and death, under the watchful eyes of tigers and wolves, the people of the country seem to forget the danger of their own situation, and still indulge in the joys of singing and dancing, regarding compatriots as grass and the country as worn-out shoes. I really don't know what they are thinking. And I don't know where they will die. "The singing girl does not know the hatred of a lost country, and still sings the Backyard Flower across the river." This can be sung for such people.</p>
<p>Driven by the whip of life, Yi, in addition to serving in a company during the day, still works as an accountant in a certain dance hall at night. Since the bad news was announced, I thought the dance hall would close itself without closing its doors. But unexpectedly, the decadent music just came out of the hands of the musicians, rippling in the intoxicating square hall, filled with confusing gazes, and shot out from the eyes of the charming dancers, twinkling in the dim light. Those who were attracted by these two things and came one after another, except for a few foreigners, most of them were still countrymen. Their extravagance in opening champagne and the way they were intimate with the dancers, their high spirits, were no less than on the eve of the Japanese massacre in the three northeastern provinces. Didn't they know about the large-scale Japanese invasion? It's almost unbelievable. But when they hug Japanese dancers in their arms, they often use this matter as a source of teasing, as if it were the ultimate sweet talk. And the Japanese dancers answer with their intoxicating voices, saying, "This is a national event. It has nothing to do with us. Let's enjoy ourselves. The music is playing again. Our people are originally friendly. Don't disturb our peace with this matter. Why don't we dance?" They laugh loudly when they hear this, and then hug each other on the smooth board, implementing their principle of Sino-Japanese friendship and enjoying themselves. Are they completely without conscience? Why are they so insane? It is strange.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>"Your view is wrong. A wife should only be responsible for managing the household herself. It's difficult if the husband insists that she must manage the household. For example, if a wife doesn't have the experience and ability to manage the household, you can't blame her for not managing it. I think a wife who can't manage the household has the self-awareness to simply not manage it, which is better than not being able to manage the household but insisting on managing it, making things worse. I ask myself that I am willing to manage the household, and I am also able to manage the household, but he dislikes me for interfering too much and not managing it well. I also want to simply not manage it. If there is a suitable job, I can find one. I really want to go out to work. I think it is extremely dangerous for a woman to not earn money herself and only rely on her husband. Can you pay attention to me and introduce me to a job?"</p>
<p>"I know your ability. It must be possible to find something that pays a few dozen yuan a month. But there are only two people in your family. If you go out again, there will really be no one to manage the household. If Mr. Li finds out that I introduced you out, he will definitely hate me."</p>
<p>"He is your friend, and I am also your friend. Why do you only care about him and not help me at all?"</p>
<p>"I can sacrifice my friendship with Mr. Li, but if people find out, it may cause a lot of trouble."</p>
<p>"Hey! I dare not ask you anymore. But you have already heard about his and your wife's whereabouts, and there are also many rumors outside. Isn't this the trouble that has arisen?"</p>
<p>"What did you hear? Tell me!"</p>
<p>"I will declare one thing first. I am definitely not jealous. I only hope that your couple will not have an extra gap because of my husband's relationship, or even have a major resentment. At the same time, I also hope that my husband will not have such a close relationship with any woman. So, I am only alone at home. I hide all my depression in my own stomach. There is no one to talk to. If I don't go out to find a job to relax, I will get sick from being depressed."</p>
<p>"I will also be honest with you. I put everything about her out of my mind and don't ask anything. To put it more bluntly, even if she really has some ambiguity with your husband, I will let her do it. I am very optimistic about everything and don't think it's a big deal. I only ask my own conscience not to be sorry for people. It is very difficult to find a job outside now. Don't say women, even men, ask for help from all aspects, but it is still useless, let alone women. If you really want to go out to work and are not afraid of others gossiping, then I am also prepared to ignore anything and think of a way for you. My company is thinking of adding a clerk. You can definitely take on the job. The monthly salary is at least fifty yuan and at most seventy or eighty yuan. Can you go?"</p>
<p>"I will definitely go. What day can I go to contact?"</p>
<p>"I will talk to the manager tomorrow, and it will probably be successful."</p>
<p>Their long conversation lasted more than three hours before it ended, because Mrs. Li had to prepare dinner. She made several delicious dishes herself and ate with Chen Xian at a table, just like a family.</p>

<p>Rebounding Thirteen Taels and a Half</p>
<p>It is said that the Japanese army is retreating. Yesterday, the 24th, the gold rush was urgent, hovering above ten taels. The morning was tired and stable, and in the afternoon it turned into firmness. The whole day was nearly a review of ten taels. After rebounding, it rose fourteen taels. The silver market reported an increase. It opened sharply lower, and then the buyers were brave and showed a peak. It rose sharply by more than thirty taels. However, foreign exchange was surprisingly loose. The price has exceeded one shilling and six pence, so it is difficult to maintain the gold price and it has fallen by more than twenty taels. Later, the market suddenly rebounded. It was heard that the Japanese army had retreated, and all parties rushed to buy. From within fifty taels, it suddenly rose above ninety taels.</p>
<p>Morning Soft and Stable: The opening of November fell by 21.5 taels to 655 taels. Large bars and silver prices each rose by eight-sevenths of a point, followed by 50 taels and 5 cents. In a moment, it prospered. Because Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Mao Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, Qianchang, Xiang and others all entered, it rose sharply by 30 taels. Yingjin closed at 1.5875 to 75, so at 9:15, it was 80 taels. Then, the Guangdong Gang sold downstream. When HSBC listed at 9:30, it was 73 to 74 taels. However, the buyers on the table were tireless and the internal conditions were still stable. At 9:45, it rose to 80 taels again. Later, Yifeng, Yifeng, Yongwu Products and others sold out, and it fell by more than ten taels. At nearly ten o'clock, it was 66 taels. Before long, the buyers were strong again, and it suddenly rose by 10 taels. At 10:20, it was 77 taels. The Guangdong Gang and Yuan Mao Yong, Dadecheng Yifeng Yong and others tended to sell out, especially because the December Yingjin gradually hardened. Therefore, the gold price plummeted by 20 taels. At 11:30, it was 58 taels. Suddenly, it increased to 63 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had soared by one rupee and ten annas, so it was suppressed to 56 taels. It rebounded by 3 taels in one minute. By the close of the market, it was 57 taels. The price was changed to 736 taels and 2 cents. It was estimated that about 60 taels were deducted. The noon closed at 80 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Soaring: The afternoon market opened with only 44 taels, but the goods opened small. Soon after, it exceeded 50 taels. Then, because Yuan Mao Yong, Zhifeng Yongcheng, Feng Yong and others were vying to buy, and it was heard that a certain bank had dropped in spot goods, and the Japanese troops in the East Province had retreated, it soared by 30 taels. At 3 o'clock, it was 74 taels, and then fell by 6 taels. At 3:30, the market was particularly strong. After 3:10, it reached 85 taels. At 4:00, it was 79 taels, but the buyers were still enthusiastic. It rose by 10 taels in an instant. At the close of the market, it was 91 taels. It closed at 90 taels, an increase of 13 taels and 5 cents compared to the previous day. According to the day's maximum of 91 taels and minimum of 44 taels, there was a difference of 47 taels. The opening price of the goods was 55 taels and 5 cents, the noon closed at 4 taels and 5 cents, and the afternoon closed at 90 taels and 5 cents. The quotation was estimated to deduct 92 taels to 46 taels. The morning registration was 57 taels, the afternoon was 90 taels, and the current red bar has increased by 11 taels. Customer sales are average.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported gains. The exchange rate fell. The Japanese and American rates shrank slightly by .05, totaling .4925, and the Shanghai market trend was also strong. HSBC listed two files longer, totaling half a penny for British gold, and 125 longer for US dollars. The Japanese gold plummeted by 1 cent, 2 points, and 75, and the relationship with the exchange rate was that all other exchange rates also increased. However, the Indian exchange rate was still unavailable, and the Hong Kong rate fell by 5 cents. The banking group initially loosened, and then saw stability before weakening and folding again. The afternoon turned out to be better, the situation was chaotic and unorganized, but the gold price was floating and chaotic. The only return was the final increase. However, compared with the previous market, British gold was 625 longer, and US dollars were also 625 longer. Japanese gold was reduced by half a point. The Chinese merchants' transaction was very lively. Most of them traded British gold, totaling about 140,000 pounds. Each of the Chinese and foreign Japanese commercial banks had sales. In addition, there were about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of US dollar transactions, and the Dalian Gang still sold more than 2 million yuan of Japanese gold. The Masajin bank made an advance payment for the December Japanese-US exchange rate of 48.5 yuan in the morning, and also traded 48.75 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Separations and Demolitions Are Increasingly Tense <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: At present, the country is facing a national crisis, and the whole country is panicking. The financial community is the economic hub, and it is the first to bear the brunt. The situation has been tense in recent days, creating an unprecedented tight situation. Checking the night before yesterday, it was heard that large amounts of deposits had been made in banks on the Bund, and the head-up rate in the market was loose. The market could be expected to loosen and harmonize the next day, but the intention was to worsen the situation. The western separations were also rising steadily. Fortunately, the authorities were doing their best to maintain the status quo. In addition, the current money industry is adopting a cautious policy for lending business due to the poor situation, so there will be no unexpected changes.</p>
<p>Price of Separations and Demolitions (Western Separations): In the early market, people were uneasy, and the separations held steady and calmed down. Therefore, the closing price was 1 mill and 2 cents and a half less than the previous afternoon, at 7 cents, 2 cents, and 5 mill-and-a-half. In the afternoon market, the separation suddenly rose again, totaling 7 cents, 2 cents, and 6 mill-and-a-half. The early and afternoon markets differed by 1 cent. The head linings were extremely scarce and insufficient for circulation, so it was expected to continue to rise. (Silver demolitions) The early and afternoon markets were both 4 cents and 5 points, which was 5 points higher than the afternoon market price of the previous day. Although it was done in the middle of the way, the situation was quite tense and difficult to suppress. The bank listed 1 cent and 8 points, and the head-up rate added water, initially 1 cent and 89 points, and then flew to about 4 cents. The final closing price was 2 cents and 89 points.</p>
<p>Market Conditions of Auxiliary Coins: Jiangnan small ocean, the early market was 6 cents, 6 cents, and 3 mill, which was also 2 mills better than the previous afternoon. The afternoon market rose sharply by 7 mill, reaching 6 cents and 7 cents, making a deal. The early market was 12,000 angles, and the afternoon market was 20,000 angles. Guangdong small ocean, the early market was 6 cents, 5 cents, and 1 mill, and the afternoon market was 6 cents, 5 cents, and 1 cent and 7 mills and a half. As a result, it was also 2 mills better than the previous day, making a deal. The early market was 220,000 angles, and the afternoon market was 90,000 angles. Copper coins were changed to 500 texts longer, totaling 372,500 texts.</p>
<p>In and Out of Silver and Foreign Coins (Silver Coins): Yesterday, the bank collected and delivered a total of 2,560,000 Chinese merchants' collected and delivered tickets, more than 2,100,000 foreign merchants' collected and delivered tickets, and 18.9 million collected and delivered tickets for various cargo exchange taxes. The warehouse entered 700,000, and the warehouse exited 500,000. The Japanese commercial bank collected and delivered more than 5 million various items, the warehouse entered 1 million, the Qianzhuang bank public list collected and delivered more than 47.7 million, the head-up items collected and delivered more than 5.22 million, various exchange items 890,000, and delivered more than 1.1 million in cash. (Foreign Coins) Exchange and transfer tickets were made in the early market of 950,000, and in the afternoon market of 2.09 million. The early market for banknotes was 140,000, and the afternoon market was 70,000. The off-site banknotes were 250,000 in the early market and 195,000 in the afternoon. The bank's transactions, the total amount made inside and outside the market in the early and afternoon markets was more than 23 million. The bank's foreign accounts received and delivered more than 2.7 million, banknotes recovered more than 1.4 million, and only issued 340,000. The Qianzhuang foreign public list received and delivered more than 8.4 million, the foreign transfer items received and delivered more than 3.7 million, foreign loans were borrowed more than 1.9 million, and small Qianzhuang transactions were 560,000.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Current State of the Financial World Yesterday <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In the several days since the Japanese army occupied our Eastern Provinces, the financial world, influenced by the prevailing environment, has experienced an extraordinary credit crunch, a sudden change in public bonds, and an increasingly tense atmosphere in the market. In terms of foreign exchange, various banks have been frantically seeking foreign currency to serve as reserves for banknotes, causing the exchange rate to continue to rise. Fortunately, those in charge have been making every effort to maintain stability. As for the credit situation, it was initially caused by Japanese merchants withdrawing cash. Subsequently, it was reported that merchants from Changchun, Qingdao, Shenyang, Liaoning, and other regions, whose ancestral lands had been ravaged by the Japanese army and whose vitality had been severely damaged, would have difficulty repaying their debts to the financial world in Shanghai. This further alarmed the financial world, leading to a very dangerous situation in the preceding days. By yesterday, although the overnight lending rate still appeared to be above 4%, the actual situation had eased. It is said that merchants from various regions, upon seeing reports of tight credit in Shanghai, have been collectively remitting large sums of money to Shanghai, with telegraphic transfers, mail transfers, and cash arriving in an endless stream. Furthermore, banks along the Bund, in order to maintain the market, are also reportedly providing as much collateralized lending as possible. While the truth of this cannot be guaranteed, it is undoubtedly good news for financial panic. However, according to those in charge of the financial world, although the Shanghai financial market may experience temporary changes, these will not last long. From a broader perspective, a solution is expected within a few days that will restore the market to its normal state.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Stock Market <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Presenting an Unprecedented Spectacle</p>
<p>Four Bonds Continued to Fall to the Limit and Halt Trading in the Morning</p>
<p>Ten Bonds Soared to the Limit and Halt Trading in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Fluctuations of Seven or Eight Yuan Caused Extreme Confusion</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock exchange, due to the delay in collecting supplementary margins, did not begin trading until after 11:00 a.m., resulting in only one trading session. Futures trading was extremely active, and bond prices continued to fluctuate significantly. The market was filled with buying, and the tense situation showed no sign of easing. Futures for September delivery of the 1919 Customs Bonds, Consolidated Tax Bonds, and Salt Tax Bonds all reportedly continued to fall to the limit and halt trading. The strong-weak divergence between the current month and next month's futures was a particularly unique phenomenon in the current stock market. This is because most holders of goods are eager to sell their current month's futures in order to raise cash, while speculators on the long side are also aware that the end-of-month delivery is imminent, and if they do not quickly seek to sell, they will inevitably have to take delivery. This has led to a short squeeze. Those who are unable or unwilling to take delivery are unanimously selling, resulting in a supply-demand imbalance, with the September futures trading two, three, or even four yuan lower than the October futures, reversing the usual situation of bond prices being higher in the near term and lower in the long term. In the afternoon, the exchange urgently discussed ways to stabilize the market, delaying the opening of trading. Brokers temporarily engaged in off-market trading, with few transactions and prices slightly lower than in the morning session. Trading resumed at 6:00 p.m., and the market situation suddenly changed dramatically. News spread that the diplomatic situation had taken a turn for the better, with the United States accepting the League of Nations' notification and formally expressing its position to intervene in the Japanese army's atrocities in Northeast China and demand their withdrawal from our country. Furthermore, the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and other major banks, in order to stabilize the market, have responded to the exchange's request to continue buying and engaging in arbitrage transactions. They have also allowed bonds to be used as collateral in response to market needs, boosting investor confidence. This led to a new record in the unprecedented fluctuation of bond prices, as buying surged and various bonds rebounded and halted trading. The four bonds that had fallen to the limit and halted trading in the morning were allowed to resume trading by the exchange for the sake of market safety and after collecting additional margins from short sellers. Their prices also rose sharply. Therefore, the net result of the day's ups and downs was a significant fluctuation of seven or eight yuan. Those who profited smiled, while those who lost shook their heads. The suddenness of the change was truly rare. There were still no spot transactions. The total value of futures transactions was 35.5 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon, but the trend remains mixed. The turbulence of the world economy makes it difficult for people to feel secure. The atmosphere towards Japan is increasingly tense, and speculators are unusually excited. However, with national crisis looming and credit extraordinarily tight, a certain major merchant intends to sell when prices rise, so the situation appears somewhat calm.</p>
<p>The Cotton Exchange is Slightly Better The Cotton Exchange opened higher, with all months rising by 1.6 to 1.7 cents due to rising U.S. cotton prices and a tense atmosphere. In the afternoon, the market was flat, with all months falling by 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, or 0.8 cents. Total transactions were 59,000 bales. Of these, Yiyu sold 2,400 bales, Shunda 2,400 bales, Gongtai 1,800 bales, Yichang 1,600 bales, Yuantai 950 bales, and Hengde 800 bales. Buyers included Meiji 1,100 bales, Yuda 1,150 bales, Changfeng 2,900 bales, Yiyu 1,100 bales, Ruida 3,500 bales, and Hengde 2,250 bales. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Are Average The sales of spot yarn are slightly calmer. It is reported that various merchants bought a total of 250 bales throughout the day. Fellow merchants took in 300 bales. The market is firm and rising. Among the merchants, Guangdong took in 160 bales, inland provinces took in 400 bales, Jiangxi took in 180 bales, Changxing took in 190 bales, Sichuan took in 190 bales, and miscellaneous merchants took in 65 bales.</p>

<p>The Foreign Market Opens... Longs Add to Positions</p>
<p>The cotton market is very firm due to rising U.S. and Indian cotton prices, and the high price of silver, which is causing commodity prices to rise. Therefore, the longs are adding to their positions. In addition, there are many rumors in the market, and the market atmosphere is tense. However, the world economy is extremely turbulent, commerce is sluggish, and there is a surplus of U.S. cotton, which is chilling. Therefore, large speculators and manufacturers are selling unanimously, with no intention of covering. In addition, foreign cotton is still cheap. The future situation is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Rises by About Half a Taels The Hankou Standard Cotton Exchange opened higher due to rising U.S. and Indian cotton prices, prompting longs to buy, and it rose by 0.5, 0.6, or 0.7 cents. The market opened slightly weaker in the afternoon, and the closing was even weaker. This was due to large players selling, causing a retracement of 0.2 or 0.3 cents. Total transactions were 111,700 bales. Of these, Meiji sold 4,000 bales, Yicheng 5,100 bales, Shenji 3,600 bales, Yifeng 2,000 bales, Daji 1,000 bales, Xincheng 2,000 bales, Yichang 2,000 bales, and Yuanda 2,000 bales.

<p>Nantou - There was not much supply yesterday. There were very few people at the market in the morning due to the rain. Merchants were demanding higher prices, but less than 300 dan of riverbank porters were employed. Because the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, both shop owners are settling accounts, and the situation is firmer. New foreign-style rice is arriving sporadically. It is difficult to deliver goods due to the rain, causing prices to continue to rise by 20 cents. Thick and thin broken japonica rice is also up slightly. The rest are unchanged.</p>
<p>Xinzha - About ten ships arrived yesterday. There was no unloding in the morning due to heavy rain. The weather cleared up in the afternoon, but trading was limited. The supply of east and west new japonica rice is not high, rising by 10 cents. New foreign-style pointed rice arrived and sold smoothly. Wholesale prices continued to rise. Early thin rice on the upper wharves and in storage was about 1,000 dan, with prices rising by 5 cents. The situation for northern japonica rice remains unchanged. The shape is stable. There is a slight surplus of foreign rice, with no spot transactions. Futures are quite active, with prices increasing by almost 10 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Foreign Rice Futures Rise by 10 Cents <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were few spot transactions of foreign rice. However, warehouse owners and local merchants were inquiring about futures, making the market very active. Furthermore, due to reports of rising prices in the production areas, investor confidence was extremely high. Both new transactions and repurchased goods jumped by about 10 cents. If warehouse owners continue to buy, the market should improve. The entire market offered 200 bags of Mindang spot rice at a price of $12.90. 300 tons of September delivery Xiaojiao futures were repurchased at a price of 5 taels, 6 dimes, and 3 cents to 5 taels, 6 dimes, and 9 cents. Also, 300 tons of October delivery were traded at a price of 5 taels, 7 dimes to 5 taels, 7 dimes, and 3 cents. 700 tons of November delivery Xiaojiao futures were newly traded at a price of 5 taels, 7 dimes, sold by Yuanxing Foreign Firm and bought by local merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Flour Futures Fall by 2.5 Cents <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a wavering appearance again. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago was up 0.2 to 0.3 dollars, while in Canada it was down a little, showing mixed signals. However, since the sharp changes in the gold market, exchange rates have been rising daily, making foreign wheat prices increasingly cheaper. At a time when the market is already suffering from oversupply, encountering this adverse situation, investor confidence is inevitably shaken. As Russian wheat has already been continuously set for shipment, yesterday it was reported that two ships of Australian white wheat had also been traded at a total price of only 3 taels and 8 dimes. If the market intends to persist in the face of such violent phenomena, it will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, although manufacturers have not engaged in large-scale selling, the sense of uncertainty is gradually increasing. In the near term, due to sluggish sales, there has been a return of long positions in the long term. The market has therefore been declining continuously, with the current month falling to as low as 2 taels, 0 dimes, 4 cents, and 2.5 li, which broadly reflects the market's gloom. As a result, the current month fell by 2 cents and 7 li, October fell by 2 cents and 2.5 li, November fell by 2.5 cents, December and January fell by 2 cents and 2.5 li, and February fell by 2 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wheat Futures Market Plunges in the Afternoon <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Another Two Ships of Australian White Wheat Reportedly Set for Shipment</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was relatively calm in the morning after opening, with little change from the previous day's closing price. However, investor confidence suddenly changed when the market opened in the afternoon. Because the flour market had already seen a decline, and the continuous shipment of foreign wheat had become active again, the violent actions of Japan, although universally condemned, have had little impact on foreign orders. With the price of gold short, there are many people looking to sell foreign wheat. For example, another two ships of Australian white wheat were reportedly set for shipment at a price of only 3 taels and several dimes. With such low comparative prices, how could investor confidence not be shaken? Therefore, all months saw declines, with the current month falling to as low as 3 taels and 6 dimes and 8 cents, a record low in the severe decline. Looking ahead, before the door to foreign wheat is closed, long positions must remain cautious. As a result, the current month fell by 6 cents compared to the previous day, October fell by 3 cents, November fell by 4 cents, December fell by 3 cents, January fell by 4 cents, and February fell by 3 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Sugar Market is Quiet and Steady <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>400 Tons of Raw Sugar Sold Off</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from the producing regions indicated that the price of Cuban spot sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for all months rose by 1 to 3 points compared to the previous telegram. Java spot and futures sugar also remained unchanged. Trading in the association market remained sparse. The price of new Dutch No. 24 raw sugar was still 11 taels, 3 dimes, and 7.5 cents. Dutch No. 20 medium sugar was 10 taels, 0 dimes, 9 cents, and 2.5 cents to 9 cents. There were no inquiries about old goods. Dutch No. 9 red sugar was 9 taels and 4 cents. The trends were all steady. Taikoo Refineries' B Mark sugar was 11 taels and 9.5 cents, with sales remaining strong. DY Mark sugar was 11 taels and 8 cents, with a severe shortage of goods. HM Mark sugar was 11 taels, 4 dimes, and 7.5 cents, with the latter trading at 11 taels and 4 dimes and 5 cents. The market was generally very firm. Dachang Foreign Firm sold off 400 tons of old raw sugar to be shipped in October, priced at 5.5 Dutch guilders, new regulations plus tax. The market atmosphere was still lively.</p>

<p>Industry Associations Establish Anti-Japanese Organizations... Stop Trading in Eastern Goods</p>
<p>The textile market is unusually chaotic and on the verge of collapse. Textiles from Japan have occupied nine-tenths of the market in recent years. Although the advanced British and American goods also have difficulty competing with them, the Japanese force is exceptionally powerful. Since the Wanbaoshan Incident, although anti-Japanese associations have been established and inspections have been carried out, a considerable number of goods are still being secretly shipped through the post office. Now that the Japanese are becoming even more rampant, occupying our Eastern Provinces, anyone with a conscience is filled with grief and indignation. Therefore, anti-Japanese associations have been established within the industry, with mutual supervision. Therefore, since the previous day, trading has been impossible. Sales of cotton cloth have been relatively smooth, and prices have risen across the board. Nine-pound coarse cloth, Cat Eagle and Five Blessings, are both priced at 5 taels and 5 cents. Eleven-pound Three Rabbit and Three Deer are priced at 5 taels and 6 dimes and 5 cents. Sixteen-pound goods are selling briskly, and spot goods are quite scarce. Hua Chang's fine cloth and fine twill fabrics are produced in smaller quantities, resulting in a more speculative attitude. Western goods are now very expensive due to the large shortage of inventory. The high prices are unprecedented. Fengyu's 24 Railway cotton is priced at 15 taels and 7.5 cents, and 26 Railway is priced at 16 taels and 5 cents. The 1.6-foot Datian'e original velvet is 1 tael and 5.5 cents. Haoshi Flower Butterfly is 1 tael and 6.5 cents. Yiji original Ning silk is 4 dimes and 5 cents. However, Yuanfang's price calls were slightly lower yesterday due to the unstable situation.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Dried Goods and Lotus Seed Market Prices Loosen <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Lotus seeds previously had a high price of 32 taels due to tight supply. Now, although market inventory is still insufficient, sales in various regions have gradually decreased, so sales have also loosened. Yesterday, the market price was 30 taels, down 2 taels from the previous day. However, new goods will still take time to arrive, and the market may not improve much.</p>

<h3 id="e128">British and American Tinplate Thrive <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Metal trading has been very quiet recently, and the trend is rather bleak. However, the British and American tinplate market showed a thriving situation yesterday. The reasons for the rebound include strong sales to customers, favorable factory performance, and positive pricing news. The detailed market conditions are investigated below.</p>
<p>British Tinplate Yesterday, Fujian merchants took in more than 700 boxes, shipped from the Wanxiang Wheel to Fujian, priced at 13 taels and 5 cents for 90 pounds, and 15 taels and 2.5 cents for 100 pounds, an increase of 1 cent from the previous market. It is reported that overseas telegrams have already rebounded to 15 shillings and 2 pence yesterday, so local investor confidence is good, and there is hope for a good market in the future.</p>
<p>American Tinplate Yesterday, cigarette factories' business was unusually active, with a total of 700 to 800 boxes sold in the city. Egg factories' purchases were also good yesterday. Therefore, the inventory of bottom goods was limited, investor confidence was strong, and prices are likely to rise. The opening price for 100 pounds was 16 taels and 7.5 cents per box, and 15 taels and 7.5 cents. According to industry insiders, many people have been purchasing American goods recently, but few goods have arrived, so the market trend is optimistic.</p>

<p>Exchange Market Changes Dramatically... European Sales Are Stagnant</p>
<p>Since Britain announced the suspension of the gold standard, drastic changes have occurred in foreign exchange. Overseas consolidated markets have been suspended for three days, silk telegrams have not been transmitted, and European and American warehouse owners are thinking of hoarding and raising prices. Local Chinese merchants have difficulty selling at original prices. Yesterday, there were no transactions in silk futures or spot silk, and the future of the silk market is increasingly pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Gongxi Green Tea Sales to Russia Are Still Smooth <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Russia's cooperative association showed strong interest in Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, and Baitouzhuang, Fulin, Qianyi, and other firms also made slight purchases. However, the selling price was about 2 to 3 taels lower. Because of the high price of shillings, British and French merchants still dared not purchase items such as Zhenmei and Zhucha tea, and the market was rather deserted.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued a notice yesterday convening a mass meeting of citizens. It stated that the representatives of various organizations in the city have resolved to hold a mass meeting of citizens at the Western Gate Public Sports Field in the city at 10:00 a.m. on the 26th of this month (Saturday) to discuss important issues such as anti-Japanese national salvation.

<p>Petition Representatives Go to Beijing</p>
<p>Two Representatives Departed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Rest Are Scheduled to Depart Tonight</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of Students from Various Universities held its first meeting of executive committee members yesterday at the Third District Party Headquarters. All eleven executive committee members attended and elected Liu Xuantian (Jiaotong University) as chairman and Chu Anping as secretary. It was resolved on the spot to send representatives to Beijing to petition the government to immediately concentrate military forces and drive Japanese troops out of the country. Li Chunsen, a representative from the College of Political Science and Law, and Chu Anping, a representative from Guanghua University, were appointed and left for Beijing last night at 10:00 p.m. to make preliminary arrangements. The Association's urgent instructions to the anti-Japanese national salvation associations of various universities to send representatives to Beijing to petition are recorded below. In an emergency, each school is directed to gather its representatives going to Beijing at the North Station at 10:00 p.m. this Friday night to depart for Beijing to petition. The reasons are (1) Japan has already propagated internationally that this incident is a local issue that should be resolved locally. (2) The Northeast authorities have sent representatives to negotiate with the Japanese consul in Liaoning regarding this incident. (In) The incident has been going on for a week, but the government still has no concrete plan. Because of the above situations, if the government authorities have already had concrete negotiations with Japan and signed humiliating treaties, it will be too late to correct them. The previous Twenty-One Demands can serve as a shocking example.</p>

Over two hundred people attended. Additionally, seventy to eighty citizens requested to attend as individuals in a listening capacity. The atmosphere in the meeting hall was extremely tense. During the discussion of proposals, speeches were passionate and debates were heated. A record of the main events of the conference is as follows: Jiang Huaisu presided over the meeting, Zhou Hanmei served as the recorder. After the opening formalities, the meeting began with</p>
<p>the Chairman's report, which stated: "A week ago, none of us could have imagined that the three northeastern provinces would be ravaged, trampled, and occupied by Japanese imperialists. Who knew that while we were living in oblivious complacency a week ago, Japan was actively preparing? Once their plans were meticulously devised and deployments finalized, like a bolt from the blue, Shenyang was occupied, followed by the successive loss of Jilin and other areas. Japanese troops are also appearing and disappearing unpredictably in the vicinity of Beiping and Tianjin. As of this meeting, alarming reports continue to pour in. This is truly a time of dire crisis for the survival of our Republic of China. People across the country are paying close attention, with some advocating for an immediate declaration of war to recover the occupied territories, while others advocate for bearing the burden of humiliation and vowing to wage economic severance. Although the methods differ, the patriotic zeal is the same. Let us now make a comprehensive observation of this Japanese military dispatch to the Northeast. It must be understood that Japan's ambition towards our country did not begin today, nor did it begin with Tanaka Giichi. When Emperor Meiji advocated for the Restoration, he established it as a fundamental national policy. Therefore, the so-called continental policy of invading our country, the former so-called Twenty-One Demands, and the present so-called Manchurian-Mongolian special rights, all aim to encompass our three northeastern provinces and then proceed to seize Mongolia and contend for the Central Plains, fulfilling their continental dream. However, due to international constraints, Japan has not dared to act rashly. But its desire to boldly try has long existed, as can be seen in its aggressive invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, and the dispatch of troops to Jinan during the May 3rd Incident. And as our National Government was established, working hard on construction, and earnestly seeking to extricate itself, despite the rampant warlords and Red bandits, the determination to govern well has not diminished. The active construction of the Northeast, and the large number of immigrants every year, have aroused unease and jealousy in the Japanese. Thus, their government fabricated the so-called Nakamura Incident to incite the wolfish hearts of their people, feigning military exercises in the front, while actually deploying troops in the rear. The Northeast authorities had no preparation in advance and panicked afterward. Shenyang was occupied, factories and barracks were burned, and Jilin, Changchun, and other places were lost. The troops retreated without resistance, the institutions were seized without resistance, and the soldiers and civilians were killed without resistance. Today, the people of the Eastern Provinces have become slaves of a conquered nation. At this moment of national demise and ethnic extinction, if our compatriots do not have a final awakening, then our four hundred million descendants of the Yellow Emperor will all become the successors of India and Annam. But having only awakening, without unified steps and a united will, will still be of no help. Therefore, the most important mission of today's meeting is how to unify the propaganda work of this city, how to strictly rectify the anti-Japanese steps of this city, and how to unify the firm will of this city. I hope the comrades present will seriously discuss and decide on this." Then</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: (1) A proposal to telegraph all compatriots across the country to rise up in unison to resist foreign aggression was resolved and passed. (2) A proposal to telegraph the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi to unanimously eliminate past grievances and come to Nanjing to participate in the national salvation conference to defend against foreign aggression was resolved and passed. (3) A proposal to telegraph Mr. Hu Zhantang to promptly cancel his leave and take on difficult tasks to jointly save the nation from disaster was resolved and passed. (4) A proposal to telegraph the Central Government to promptly mobilize a large army to drive Japanese troops out of the country was resolved and passed. (5) A proposal to telegraph the Central Government to promptly order all party members of our party to undergo military training as pioneers of the people was resolved and passed. (6) A petition to the City Executive Committee to organize the city's Volunteer National Salvation Army and order all party members in the city to join, otherwise, they will be expelled from the party to serve as a warning was resolved and passed. (7) A proposal to telegraph the Central Government to urgently instruct our country's ambassadors abroad to vigorously publicize the truth about Japanese military aggression against China to arouse international sympathy was resolved and passed. (8) A proposal that the district sub-branches in this city should urgently organize anti-Japanese national salvation speech teams to go out and publicize was resolved and passed. (9) A proposal that the regular publications of the district party headquarters in this city should all be changed to anti-Japanese national salvation newspapers to expand propaganda was resolved and passed. (10) A proposal to telegraph the Central Government to strictly order the Northeast authorities not to negotiate on the spot was resolved and passed. (11) A proposal to advise compatriots across the country to sever all relations with Japan was resolved and passed. After the discussion, there were more than twenty temporary motions, which have not yet been fully sorted out.</p>

<p>The situation is pressing! The matter is urgent! The elders, brothers, sisters of the Northeast are already victims under the guns and artillery fire of the Japanese pirates. The border of Liaohai, the essence of Northeast, collapsed and were swept away. If we are not insane, we must resist and fight against this fierce imperialism, and struggle to the death. Japanese imperialism's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia has been going on for thirty years. Since the recent Wakatsuki cabinet, they have inherited the ambition of Ito Hirobumi from afar, and the legacy of Tanaka from nearby. Political aggression, economic oppression, military actions, cultural infiltration, not only followed the old rules but also intensified. Taking advantage of the world economic panic and the flying disasters in China, they repeatedly provoked, and their lackeys and barbarians slaughtered overseas Chinese in Seoul, forcibly excavated the fields of Wanbaoshan, killing people and seizing land, which is rare in Chinese and foreign history. Recently, they used the pretext of the Nakamura Captain case to cunningly try to achieve their goals, secretly bombing the intersection of the Sino-Japanese railway in Huanggutun, falsely claiming it was done by Chinese soldiers. They did not issue a declaration of war, nor even the most basic ultimatum, but deployed a large army, bombed Shenyang, demonstrating their ferocious face with violent riots, killing and setting fire, doing their utmost to be vicious, disregarding international law, destroying East Asian peace, and treating our Chinese people as dogs and chickens. Alas, we, Northeast people residing in Shanghai, if we do not rise up to resist and fight against them, what face and meaning do we have to exist in this world? The case of Nakamura alone was enough to bomb Shenyang, then the cases of tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Seoul and thousands of acres in Wanbaoshan should have overthrown their three islands with more than enough guilt. The defensive positions along the South Manchurian Railway are heavily guarded, and Chinese people have never dared to cross the line, so how could they have possibly bombed it? Furthermore, they accuse the League of Nations of having started the conflict themselves, treating this trick of trying to cover up the world's eyes with one hand as truly despicable, hateful, absurd, and lamentable. The right and wrong, the truth, is obvious to children. They even try to deceive the League of Nations, confusing the audience by claiming it is a local conflict, not an international problem, and only want to negotiate with the Northeast, not with the Central Government. If the Manchurian and Mongolian issues are not resolved in a day, the military occupation will not be withdrawn in a day. What do they mean by "issues"? What is their ultimate goal? By "issues," they mean the unresolved issue of Manchuria and Mongolia not being ceded to Japan. Their goal is to have the Northeast not belong to Japan. Like this, there is no justice in their aggressive behavior. Alas, heads can be cut off, legs can be broken, but justice cannot be destroyed. We would rather be ghosts on the battlefield than slaves of a conquered nation. The people of the Northeast are willing to lead their compatriots to face this national crisis and deal with Japanese imperialism. This great misfortune in China is, of course, a conflict between nationalism and imperialism, and at the same time, it is the persecution of the weak by the oppressor. It is not a local event in the Northeast, but a matter of the entire survival of China. It is not a tragic case for a few people, but a critical moment for the entire nation. For the sake of avenging the compatriots who have already died, and for the sake of the future survival of the nation, representatives from various universities in Shanghai initiated a meeting, which led to the preparation of the All-Circles Anti-Japanese Congress. It is scheduled to be held at the YMCA on North Sichuan Road on the afternoon of the twenty-sixth at two o'clock to awaken the national spirit, arouse the people's spirit, exterminate bandits and kill enemies, and overthrow Japanese imperialism. Nothing is sadder than the death of the heart. If the people's hearts are not dead, the nation is not lost. We are facing this difficult fate and should have a sound organization. Like birds with overturned nests, wagtails face urgent difficulties. It is deeply hoped that people from all walks of life in the Northeast who are in Shanghai will actively participate to carry out patriotic movements and save the nation. They have sophisticated guns and cannons, we have bronze heads and iron shoulders. They have barbarian soldiers and generals, we have sincerity and passion. The restoration of our rivers and mountains and the redress of grievances depend on our efforts and our struggles. Alas, if we return to Liaodong in the future, the cities may be the same, but the people will be different. When we think of this, how can we not be moved? After shedding tears, our slogans are: Drive out the Japanese pirates from Chinese territory, go to the front lines to exterminate bandits and kill enemies, overthrow Japanese imperialism, long live the Northeast, long live the Republic of China!</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's International Propaganda Committee and Volunteer Corps Committee conveners Ye Huijun and Wu Mai scheduled a meeting for today. Yesterday, a notice was issued stating, "Greetings, it is hereby scheduled for the 25th of this month, namely (Friday), at 2:00 PM, at the City Chamber of Commerce meeting. At that time, we hope you will spare your time to attend and discuss, which is what we expect."</p>
<p>Telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang: To His Excellency Zhang Hanqing, Deputy Commander of the Northern Land, Sea, and Air Forces, Our country is unfortunate, disasters are frequent, and the Japanese aggressors, taking advantage of our chaos, openly dispatched troops, occupied our Northeast, burning, looting, and killing, inhumanly. Recently, enemy cavalry has spread all over Pingjin, and enemy warships have sealed off all seaports. The pain of national subjugation is imminent. The Northeast has raised hundreds of thousands of soldiers, spending millions of dollars every year, but enemy cavalry arrives swiftly, and not a single arrow was fired, and the important place of Shenyang was handed over, and Changying fell after a short period of time, and Jilin and Harbin are alarming. Armories and military equipment were all looted, and the essence of the buildings was reduced to ashes. Hearing about it from afar, we cannot help but feel grief and anger. Your Excellency is in charge of the border, if you do not rectify the military and prepare for action, and quickly engage in a decisive battle with the Japanese aggressors, how will you thank the people of the country? Alas, the blue blood of Huanggutun is still fresh, the remains of Shenyang City have not yet dissipated, Your Excellency's ancestors have suffered at their hands, and Your Excellency's home has become ruins. This is not something that can be resolved by crying. It is urgent to rectify the army, and die on the battlefield. If you succeed, you will annihilate the Japanese invaders and restore our country. The spirit of the late Prime Minister is what you rely on. If you fail, you will be wrapped in horsehide and die, achieving benevolence and taking righteousness, and your name will be remembered for thousands of years. People across the country will surely follow one another and act as a support for the government, and engage in a life-and-death battle with the Japanese aggressors, willing to be the Turkey after the war, preferring to die than to be ruled like Korea and Taiwan. At this moment of crisis, the life and death of the Chinese nation depends on Your Excellency, which is of the utmost importance and greatness. We offer our humble suggestions, not choosing our words in haste, and hope Your Excellency will actually benefit from them. Respectfully, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association,</p>

<p>Notice to All Industries to Quickly Form Goods Inspection Teams</p>
<p>The Business Community's Goods Inspection Association issued a notice to all industries to quickly form inspection teams, stating, "Greetings, our association, at the beginning of the various sectors implementing economic severance against Japan due to the Japanese inciting the Wan-Korean tragedy, advocated that merchants automatically resist goods, and limited each industry to establish inspection teams to be responsible for clearing Japanese goods from each industry. However, the industry associations generally considered this inspection team to be unimportant, and delayed and waited, and have not yet organized. Occasionally, those who have established according to the deadline are mostly perfunctory and formal. Now, the Japanese have intensified their efforts, dispatching troops to attack and occupy all of Manchuria, and fleets are densely deployed along the river, connecting stern to stern, and it is inevitable that they will take our territory. The rise and fall of the world is everyone's responsibility, and our business community cannot fall behind. Therefore, we again request your association to quickly establish a Japanese goods inspection team, intensify work, clear out inferior goods in the shortest possible time, and permanently implement economic severance against Japan, to show our determination to passively resist and peacefully struggle."</p>

<h3 id="e139">Advocate for Complete Severance of Relations with Japan <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, in response to the Japanese aggressors' unprovoked initiation of hostilities and forceful occupation of various places in the Northeast, issued a special urgent declaration, stating, "Now Japan is taking advantage of people's difficulties, adding insult to injury, dispatching troops for no reason, and starting a war without declaration, daring to disregard the world's great disapproval, and disregarding the Non-Aggression Pact, and treating the whole world as if there were no one. Its barbaric and tyrannical, callous and unreasonable rogue face has been completely exposed, not only is it intolerable to international law, but it is also a shame to civilized countries. Under this serious situation of disrupting world peace, we sincerely hope that the friendly nations that uphold peace will make a fair judgment, jointly impose sanctions, and restrain its fierce flame, in order to achieve the goal of world peace. This is not only the luck of East Asia, but also the blessing of the world's future. Moreover, China and Japan are like lips and teeth, with the closest relationship, and the same culture and race. Not only are the cultural systems all derived from our country, but also its transformation from weak to strong, without fear of poverty, and becoming a global power, is all due to our country. In plain terms, our country has bestowed benefits on Japan, which is not stingy. Now, it repays kindness with resentment, becomes arrogant, and turns against its benefactor. This is no different from raising a tiger to hurt oneself, and repaying kindness with hatred. What is more unjust than this in the world? Our association, recognizing the imminent national disaster and the time of life and death, dares to shed blood and sincerely tell the people of the whole country, and at this time when power is in charge and justice is completely destroyed, we hope that our entire country will unite to resist, and jointly save the country from disaster, preferring to die as jade than to survive as tile, and each will fight to the death within their power, and unite as one to adhere to Japan, and never cooperate economically, even if it is the cheapest inferior goods, we will resolutely reject them. We seek national goods, and if we cannot help but have irreplaceable items, we would rather purchase other foreign goods, then we dare to believe that after a few months of implementation, Japan will not have a poor people and a weak country, and will perish itself."</p>

<p>Telegrams from the Four District Party Headquarters Urging Swift Reinforcement of National Defense</p>
<p>The Fourth District Party Headquarters convened an emergency executive committee meeting yesterday. Many opinions were expressed regarding Japan's dispatch of troops to Manchuria. The following is a transcription of their telegram:</p>
<p>To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force (excerpt omitted):</p>
<p>The reason why Japan is so disrespectful and contemptuous of our country today is that our country is embroiled in a fierce civil war, afflicted by natural disasters, our soldiers are weary, the people are struggling to survive, and, in particular, our military preparations are insufficient to defend against foreign aggression, and our national defense lacks consolidation. Therefore, they do as they please, as if they were in an uninhabited territory. This is partly due to Japan taking advantage of our weakness, but it is also due to our country's neglect of national defense. Today, the invasion of our Northeast by the military is only the first step in their plan. Their ambitions are great and will not stop there. Their northern aggression will inevitably lead to the swallowing of Manchuria and Mongolia, and, in due course, the invasion of China proper. If this were to happen, their southern aggression policy would easily advance simultaneously. At that time, neglecting our front and rear, with a fragile national defense, our country would not be secure. Alas, now that the matter has come to this point, with great disaster looming, all citizens are filled with righteous indignation and vow to save the country. Strengthening national defense is the most urgent task. Concentrating our strength and preparing quickly is even more necessary. We have heard that after occupying Anshan and Huangdao, the Japanese army will move south along the Beining Railway, eyeing our Yuguan. This is something that those who value national defense should pay attention to. Shanhaiguan is currently a strategically important area, the gateway to North China. We should concentrate our strength there immediately to create a defensive fallback position. This is another aspect of national defense that should be noted. The coastal areas, such as Xiamen and Shantou in Fujian, and the Yangtze River region, along with their key ports, should concentrate the military forces of their respective provinces to prepare for any eventuality. This is yet another area that needs solid defense. Nanjing is our country's capital, backed by mountains and facing the sea. The defense of the Yangtze River must not be overlooked, and the Jinpu Railway, which leads directly to the Central Plains, is a critical area. Heavy troops should be stationed there to prepare for resistance. This is another aspect of national defense that should be noted. The plan for now is to first consolidate national defense to prevent the Japanese army from making further advances in their plans. Then, we should gather the strength of the entire country to resist the Japanese army and use military force to compel them to withdraw. Although it is like digging a well when one is already thirsty, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep has been lost. If the entire country is of one mind and works together, the Japanese, however cunning, will inevitably bring about their own demise by their many unjust acts. This association, on behalf of the comrades in this district, vows to be a bulwark for the government. Regarding the consolidation of national defense and the concentration of military strength, we humbly offer our suggestions. We earnestly request your careful consideration. This urgent telegram cannot express the extent of our anxiety.</p>
<p>Respectfully, the Fourth District Party Headquarters of Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>

<p>Resolutions of the Sixth District Party Headquarters The Executive Committee of the Sixth District Party Headquarters convened a temporary executive committee meeting yesterday. Feng Xiancheng chaired the meeting, and Yang Youwang served as the recorder. The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the proposal on how to express the view that comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi have not sincerely cooperated with the central government in the face of national crisis: It was resolved to send a telegram to comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi, urging them to set aside their differences and come to Beijing to jointly bear the responsibility of saving the nation.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the proposal to telegram Mr. Hu Hanmin, urging him to take on difficult tasks as soon as possible to jointly save the nation: It was resolved and passed.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the proposal to schedule a general meeting of all party members in the district to intensify anti-Japanese work: It was resolved: 1. The time is set for 9:00 AM on September 27th. 2. The location is set at the Baixing Grand Theater. 3. Report to the Municipal Party Headquarters. 4. Zhu Ping'an, Feng Xiancheng, and Yang Youwang were nominated as the presidium. 5. Notify all branches to bring flags and banners and instruct all party members to participate.</p>
<p>(4) (5) Omitted.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the proposal to publish an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Newspaper: It was resolved that each committee member would be responsible for writing articles to be submitted to the propaganda committee for editing and immediate publication. The rest omitted.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Party Headquarters of the Two Railways to Guangdong. For the attention of all newspaper offices: The recent telegram to Guangdong reads, "Guangdong Gu Weiyuan Yingfen, please forward to all comrades in Guangdong: Unfortunately, the nation is plagued by frequent disasters, floods rage, and Red bandits are everywhere. At this moment of rescuing the dying and aiding the wounded, it is a critical juncture for survival and extinction. Unexpectedly, Japanese imperialists, in pursuit of their militaristic aggression dreams, launched a lightning strike, sending troops to the eastern province, burning, destroying, and slaughtering, displaying their bestial nature. They are recklessly engaging in military expansion. It is believed that people are insulted only after they have insulted themselves. The ambition of the violent Japan has been gradually developing. Internal turmoil has presented them with an opportunity. Fraternal strife hinders external defense. Considering the changing times, we lament to the extreme. Now the nation is in imminent danger, and the people are facing the threat of annihilation. All those with blood and breath are filled with righteous indignation and are rising up to catch up, jointly overcoming the national crisis. Gentlemen, as pillars of the party and the nation, protecting the country and saving the people, you will not lag behind others. We earnestly hope that you will abandon past grievances and unite as one. Unity can only be achieved through peace, and only through unity can we seek external resistance. At this critical moment, how can we bear to fight each other? We should share the same hatred against the enemy and rescue the nation from danger. This urgent telegram conveys our thoughts with great eagerness. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways."</p>
<p>Suggestions from Party Member Shao Xubai. Party member Shao Xubai made three suggestions to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday. The following are excerpts of the reasons: (excerpt omitted) (1) Our economic severance with Japan has been done repeatedly, but all have quickly fizzled out, only leaving Japanese people scoffing at us. It is truly painful to mention. Therefore, in this anti-Japanese campaign, in addition to being strict with the boycott movement, we should also actively promote domestic goods. Your association should unite with various organizations to form an association for promoting domestic goods, following the methods of the previous anti-Japanese association. Extract funds for saving the nation from Japanese goods to cover expenses or raise funds through other methods, depositing them in a designated bank. At the same time, appoint special personnel to investigate the types and quantities of Japanese goods sold in China. Most importantly, investigate our country's inventions that have not yet been made but are exclusive to Japan, or those that have already been invented but are inferior to Japanese goods (such as mimeograph machines). After the investigation is completed, solicit those with the knowledge or experience to manufacture these goods, enabling them to conduct dedicated research separately. After success, if the quality of the product can exceed that of Japanese goods and the price is equal to or lower than Japanese goods, then request the government to grant the most honorary certificate and a certain number of years of exclusive distribution rights. Our country has vast land and abundant resources. Almost all kinds of raw materials are available, and we are not short of specialized talents. It is only because of economic hardship that those who aspire to research cannot do so, resulting in the neglect of skills, which is truly lamentable. If we can actively carry out this method, the future of domestic goods will truly depend on it.</p>
<p>(2) There are many Japanese merchants and factories in Shanghai, and quite a few Japanese people need to employ Chinese people. Your association should urge them to voluntarily terminate their employment relationships and implement a policy of non-cooperation to halt the commercial and industrial activities of the Japanese in Shanghai. At the same time, request party and government organs to actively find ways to provide alternative employment and inform domestic goods factories to accommodate as many as possible. Other jobs, such as nannies and servants, should also be urged to quit. In this way, their commercial and industrial activities will be hit, and Japanese residents in Shanghai will be panicked.</p>
<p>(3) During each boycott, unscrupulous merchants often take the opportunity to raise the prices of domestic goods to seek profit, which is outrageous and despicable. Therefore, your association should request the authorities to strictly prohibit merchants from hoarding and raising prices. If any of the above-mentioned situations are discovered, they should be regarded as sabotaging the anti-Japanese work. The above three points are of great importance. It is hoped that your association will discuss them in detail, plan their implementation, and promote their realization. I cannot help but offer my sincere wishes.</p>
<p>Telegram from Chen Jiayou in Malaysia. The National Society reports: Chen Jiayou respectfully informs all compatriots in a telegram: (title omitted).</p>
<p>With respect, Japanese imperialists fabricated facts and suddenly used lightning-fast means to destroy and occupy our cities and slaughter our soldiers and civilians. They are still continuing to send land, sea, and air forces to attack in multiple directions without end. Their cruelty has reached the point of turning residences into ruins and flesh and blood into a tragic mess. The shocking news has spread, causing unbearable grief. I believe that their cunning intention to occupy Manchuria and Mongolia and then invade the entire country has been around for a long time. However, it was constrained by the balance of international power and has not been achieved until recently. With Russia and Germany having reached the end of their strength and the United Kingdom and the United States being out of reach, and coupled with our country's successive years of internal wars and common floods, reaching the point of extreme danger, they believe that the time is ripe. Therefore, they disregarded the Kellogg-Briand Pact and righteousness and humanity, and suddenly unleashed their poisonous and ruthless ambition to achieve their long-cherished wish of annexation. At this critical moment of survival or extinction, if our people are willing to be a continuation of India and Korea, so be it. Otherwise, the only option is for the entire nation to rise up as one, uphold the spirit of national self-determination, follow the Prime Minister's advocacy of abolishing unequal treaties, and vow to fight to the last ditch to save a fraction of hope from danger. If we continue to adhere to the policy of non-resistance or hope for international intervention, we are simply waiting for death. As the saying goes, "There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart." Even a trapped beast will fight back without any spare time to look back. The three households that destroyed Qin were truly based on the same hatred of the enemy. Moreover, our country has vast land and abundant resources, a large population, and many soldiers. If we can unite as one and vow to resist insults, how can we not hold up spears to strike at the strong armor and sharp weapons of Qin and Chu? In short, we must bend the chimney before a fire starts and move the firewood away. With the nest overturned, how can there be any unbroken eggs? Today, the only option is to prefer shattering like jade rather than surviving like tile. Only then can we have the possibility of surviving after being placed in a deadly situation. In the aftermath of Jiayou's righteous indignation, I believe that there are three things that should be urgently implemented by the entire nation in this great crisis. I will briefly describe them below:</p>
<p>A. General Mobilization of the National Army: (1) Immediately cease internal wars and organize a national defense conference. (2) All existing troops should be formed into national defense forces, deployed at key points along the river to prevent the enemy from invading, and advance to recover the destroyed and occupied areas (but still use a portion to eliminate the Communist bandits). (3) Expand and unify national ordnance factories. (4) The people should organize volunteer corps as a backing for the national defense forces. (5) The people should organize self-defense forces to maintain rear area security.</p>
<p>B. General Economic Mobilization of the Country: (1) Permanent economic severance with Japan. (2) Issue national defense bonds. (3) Organize national defense donations. (4) Establish national defense logistics stations.</p>
<p>C. General Political Mobilization of the Country: (1) Vow to stop all domestic entertainment and mourn for the national disaster. (2) Conduct thorough and expanded propaganda of righteousness and humanity internationally. (3) Immediately declare the abolition of all unequal treaties with Japan. (4) First form local conferences to elect representatives, then form a national conference. (5) Strictly supervise the government and be tough on foreign affairs. (6) Develop the spirit of national self-determination and thoroughly maintain national independence and sovereignty.</p>
<p>The above three points are truly the only path to survival and national salvation. There must be no hesitation or delay, and even more so, no private interests or prejudices mixed in. If the people of the whole country, without north or south, without factions or affiliations, without division of classes, without division of officials and civilians, can wash away the inertia of abandoning their national duties and act in unison, then perhaps there is hope. These urgent words are followed by tears. I earnestly hope that the elders, brothers, sisters, and siblings of the whole country will be alert and heed them. Jiayou bows, Malaysia.</p>
<p>Two Students Leave Letters to Join the Army. Yang Renwei and Yang Rentou, brothers from Guanghua University, excel in sports and are knowledgeable. Now that the Japanese soldiers have invaded our Liaoning and Jilin, killing our compatriots, a great shame and humiliation, they are so pained that they wish they were dead. Yesterday, they left a letter to their close friend Qian Yaobin and have gone to Beijing to join the army.</p>
<p>Practical Opinions from the Nanjing Women's Temperance Society. The Nanjing Women's Temperance Society's letter to women nationwide states: (Excerpt omitted) At this critical moment, there are two urgent matters for us women: First, we must practice frugality and save our suffering compatriots in the floods to give them the strength to serve the country. During such a dangerous period, we must not spend money on various hobbies. We should save money from banquets, alcohol, tobacco, new clothes, and building houses to help the disaster victims. Saving one more disaster victim is like preserving one more bit of vitality for the country. Also, we should be frugal with daily expenses at home, enduring some hardship for this special situation. Second, under no circumstances should we buy Japanese goods. Why do the Japanese not buy Chinese goods? Why do the Chinese buy Japanese goods? Some say that women in our country especially like to use Japanese goods because they are cheap and good-looking. Does this unfairly accuse women? We must know that being greedy for cheapness is a sign of inferiority, and wanting to look good is a symbol of vanity. Both inferiority and vanity should be eradicated. At the same time, now is not the time to be greedy for cheapness or to focus on looks. Is national subjugation cheap? Is national subjugation good-looking? Please think carefully. Finally, we women with knowledge should bear greater responsibility. We should not only do it ourselves, but also lead our sisters nationwide who have not attended school to do the same. The matter is urgent, do not delay. We must stand on the same front as men, sacrificing and serving the country.</p>
<p>The National Medical Association Boycotts Japanese Medicine. The National Medical Association sent a quick postal telegram to the local medical associations yesterday: (Excerpt omitted) It has been resolved by the 12th Executive Committee meeting of this association on September 24th to notify all branch members across the country to boycott Japanese medical supplies. In addition to separately nominating Wang Qizhang and Xia Shenchu to draft a declaration and investigate substitutes for Japanese medicine, it is specially recorded and conveyed for your reference. It is hoped that you will check and inform all members to strictly comply.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Coal Industry Association. The Coal Industry Association held a temporary emergency meeting of fellow members yesterday afternoon. More than 350 members attended. Wei Hongwen, Mao Chunpu, Chen Yushu, Wang Shunshan, and Lu Qisheng were publicly nominated as chairmen. After the ceremonies, the chairman reported, and the following measures were resolved: (1) Organize an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Corps. (2) Raise national salvation donations. (3) Organize a committee for the custody of national salvation donations and nominate the custody committee members. (4) Telegram Vice Commander Zhang to recover lost territory, telegram the government to declare war on Japan, and telegram the Central Committee members in Guangdong to return on a specific date and jointly resist Japan. (5) Boycott Japanese coal and organize a committee to boycott Japanese coal, nominating 15 people as committee members. (6) Limit coal prices. The chairman read out the predetermined coal prices item by item three times. When reading the Datong Er Coal raw lumps, member Sheng voluntarily reduced the price by two dimes and five cents to fifteen taels and seven dimes and five cents. The crowd applauded and welcomed his good method of promoting domestic coal. When reading the Matsuura raw lumps, Chen Renbao of Wencheng volunteered to reduce the price by one tael and sell 1,500 tons. The whole venue welcomed him. Finally, regarding the prevention of shipping companies from taking the opportunity to increase water transport fees, it was resolved that if the above situation is encountered, the Shipping Association should be notified to correct it. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Manufacturing of Glassware Industry Does Not Import Japanese Goods. The glassware industry colleagues held an emergency committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Cao Fengbiao reported that, generally speaking, a small number of necessary raw materials for this industry have been purchased from Japan. Today, because of Japanese barbarism, this association unanimously resolved to inform all colleagues to vow not to purchase raw materials from Japanese merchants again. We are also soliciting from all sectors that, if there are Chinese merchant firms that can manufacture and match glass raw materials, please inform the association's office at any time. We look forward to it.</p>

<p>Rotary Club Issues Document. The Shanghai Rotary Club issued a document stating: Regarding the unfortunate incidents that have occurred in Manchuria, all members of the Rotary Club worldwide should express sympathy and should pay attention to the future development of this case.

Secondly, all members of the Rotary Club have a responsibility to fulfill the sixth article of the organization's purpose, and now is a good opportunity to promote the realization of the purpose. Therefore, the members of the Shanghai Rotary Club and other national members should work together to promote its realization with all their strength. For the above reasons, the Shanghai Rotary Club should immediately pass the following resolution: One Shanghai Rotary Club should immediately contact the Rotary Club, the International League of Associations, and other relevant groups to jointly find ways to promote peace with all its strength. However, in the near term, resolve the Manchuria incident.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Zhang Ji's Telegram to Guangdong Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Hoping that all Comrades will come to Hong Kong for Advice</p>
<p>The Dutch Ship, Encountering Wind, Sets Sail This Morning</p>
<p>Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Central Supervisory Committee Members, Chen Mingshu, former Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Xu Xijun, Chen’s Secretary, and a party of four, came to Shanghai from Beijing the night before last. Under Central Order, they are heading to Hong Kong to mediate and negotiate peace. The original plan was for them to set sail on the China Navigation Company’s SS Tjisadane at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. However, the ship temporarily received a report from the Observatory, stating that a hurricane was passing through the area and that there was heavy fog. Consequently, the Captain formally announced that the departure would be changed to 5:30 AM this morning. Zhang and the others took a small launch from the Jianghai Customs Wharf to the SS Tjisadane, which was docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong, at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Upon hearing the news of the postponement, they returned to their lodgings. They boarded the ship at around 6:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>Chiang’s Handwritten Letter. According to Cai Yuanpei’s statement to reporters yesterday, they are carrying a handwritten letter from Chairman Chiang on this trip, which will be personally delivered to the Guangdong side by Chen Mingshu. The time of their return to Shanghai and whether the Guangdong Committee members will be able to accompany them to Shanghai has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Telegram to Guangdong. To Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Gu Xiangqin, Mr. Chen Bonan in Guangzhou, and forwarded to all gentlemen: The fall of Fengji (?), the expansion of the invaders’ flames, like a boar and a serpent, the country will not be a country. The way to save the nation is to unite the whole country and unanimously resist foreign aggression. Yuanpei, Jiming, and Shushuo will arrive in Guangdong tomorrow to discuss the great plan of national salvation with all of you. On the day of our arrival in Hong Kong, we deeply hope that you gentlemen will come to Hong Kong to give us advice. I hereby telegraph this. Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Chen Mingshu, respectfully bow.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Hurricane Warning in Shanghai <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Sea Vessels Suspend Operations</p>
<p>Hurricane Occurs. Yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather report, stating that a hurricane had occurred in the Wenzhou waters. The wind is currently blowing in a northeasterly direction and progressing extremely rapidly. A hurricane had already reached the mouth of the Yangtze River outside Wusong in the afternoon. After this report was released, a large black ball was hung on the weather report stand at the intersection of Huangpu Garden and Edward Road to warn of the impending hurricane in Shanghai, so that the shipping industry could prepare in advance.</p>
<p>Customs Fired Cannons. After receiving the Observatory’s report, the Jianghai Customs immediately fired a signal cannon on the Pudong side at 4:45 PM. This was to warn all shipping companies in Shanghai and ships sailing in the Huangpu River so that they could take precautions in advance to avoid the dangers of the hurricane. After this signal cannon was fired, small sampans, rowing boats, cargo barges, and civilian boats in the Huangpu River suspended operations early. Around 5:00 PM, they all sailed to the old port and the wharves to take shelter from the wind.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Vessels Stopped. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Ningbo vessels, the Zhaoshang’s Xin Jiangtian and the Sanbei’s Ningxing, had already loaded passengers and cargo and were preparing to depart at 4:00 PM. Upon receiving the Customs’ hurricane warning, they decided not to depart to avoid danger. The passengers who had already boarded were notified by the crew to go ashore and return home. The departures were rescheduled for Saturday. Those who did not wish to travel could have their tickets refunded. The Jinliyuan Wharf was quite lively for a time as passengers refunded their tickets and returned home. The Taikoo, Ningshao, Xin Beijing, and Xin Ningshao vessels in Ningbo also telegraphed to stay in Ningbo and not depart. Other vessels, such as the Shanghai-Taiwan and Chonghai vessels, did not depart and remained in Shanghai to take shelter from the wind.</p>
<p>Sea Vessels Delayed. Yesterday, the outbound sea vessels included the Taikoo’s Liangzhou and Linan, and the Jardine Matheson’s Fusheng. Except for the Fusheng, which had already departed at 1:00 PM in the afternoon and was later notified by Jardine Matheson via wireless to take shelter from the wind en route, the Linan, Liangzhou, and other vessels did not set sail and remained in Shanghai to take shelter from the wind. The Ninghai, Nanning, and Dalian Maru vessels, which were scheduled to depart for Shantou, Guangdong, and Yingkou (??), Dalian (???) and other ports this morning, had already decided to postpone their departures. Those that still had to travel after the hurricane occurred still had to sail. However, since the wind had already reached the mouth of the Yangtze River this time, the Yangtze River vessels that were scheduled to depart this morning also unanimously postponed their departures to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>Dutch Vessel Moves Slowly. The Java China Japan Lijn’s SS Tjisadane was originally scheduled to depart yesterday. Our Central Committee members Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, and others were traveling on this vessel to Hong Kong and then Guangdong to discuss the overall policy of peace and foreign relations. Unexpectedly, news suddenly arrived that a hurricane was about to strike the local area. The vessel temporarily postponed its departure and rescheduled it for today.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Japanese Tea Amidst the Anti-Japanese Voice. <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Tea Sales to Russia Severely Hit.</p>
<p>A Certain Foreign Firm Orders Large Quantities of Japanese Tea.</p>
<p>In recent years, the foreign sales of Chinese tea have been declining day by day. The important reasons for this are that the Chinese are sticking to old methods and do not know how to improve, but the occupation of the European and American markets by Indian and Ceylonese black tea and the encroachment of Japanese green tea on Russia are also reasons. According to an investigation by people in the tea industry, Japanese tea could not be sold to Russia before. However, since 1925 (i.e., the 14th year of the Republic of China), the record of the first export of Japanese tea to Russia was opened, but the amount was only more than 300,000 pounds. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, it jumped to more than one million pounds. In the 18th year, it exceeded three million pounds. Last year, that is, the 19th year of the Republic of China, the total amount of green tea shipped from Shanghai to Russia was 4,777,700 pounds, while Japanese green tea reached 6,154,785 pounds, exceeding Chinese tea. Chinese tea sales to Russia have been severely hit. However, recently, according to the Japanese-language newspaper Shanghai Daily News on the 20th, the Xiexie Foreign Firm in this port has ordered 12,000 boxes of green tea from Japan, about 5,000 dan, and the negotiations have been settled. It is said that the goods must be traded and that the tea leaves are mixed with Chinese green tea by the firm and shipped to the United Kingdom, etc. Japan's aggression against China can be described as meticulous, and it is unknown how the tea industry will deal with the aftermath.</p>

<p>Additional Second Floor National Goods Emporium Established</p>
<p>Grand Opening Scheduled for November 1st</p>
<p>Since its opening in June, the National Goods Emporium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Exhibition Hall has experienced thriving business. However, due to the limited space on the first floor, it has been unable to fully accommodate all kinds of national goods, leading to regret among many female patrons. Consequently, the Sixth Emporium Committee has resolved to convert the second floor exhibition area into an emporium to achieve completeness. The emporium's office has submitted a request to the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Once approved, preparations will commence immediately. The following is a list of the new additions and expansions: New additions include copper and iron beds, musical instruments, leather goods, small hardware, clocks and eyewear, shoes and hats, porcelain, cloisonné enamelware, small Southern goods, and woodenware. Expansions include stationery and toys, tobacco and alcohol, knitwear, leather goods, cotton textiles, and general merchandise. The grand opening is rumored to be on October 1st.</p>

<p>Two Breaches in the Riverbank of Wuwei County</p>
<p>Wuwei County in Anhui Province is bordered by rivers on three sides, encompassing over a million mu of polder land and over half a million mu of alluvial land, all protected by a single dike line stretching 260 li. On August 14th of this year, the riverbank breached at Huangsitang Port and Temple Port, resulting in a loss of over 40 million yuan for the entire county and affecting over 400,000 disaster victims. Representatives, including Lu Zhi'an, have been dispatched to Shanghai to appeal to the National Government and various charitable organizations. Recently, the representatives received a telegram from the county reporting that two more breaches had occurred at Baiyuchi and Huangnizui in the higher reaches of the riverbank. The inner river water suddenly rose over four chi, causing those disaster victims who had already sought refuge in higher ground to be swept away by the water, resulting in countless deaths. Moreover, the Wuwei riverbank is crucial to the safety of Helu, Shuchao, and Han, six counties. It is said that these six counties have also experienced a water level rise of over three chi in recent days.</p>
<p>Emergency Relief Association Refuses Japanese Relief Funds</p>
<p>Over 100,000 Yuan in Relief Funds Remitted Yesterday</p>
<p>During the ninth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces, someone proposed that disaster victims in various regions have unanimously expressed their refusal to accept relief funds and supplies from Japan. The question was raised whether the association should reconsider its policy. After deliberation, it was decided that all relief funds and supplies from Japan would be rejected and no longer accepted. The National Government Disaster Relief Committee was also requested to handle the matter consistently. The association reportedly requested Mr. Zhu Ziqiao to convey this decision to the National Government Disaster Relief Committee yesterday.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces remitted the following relief funds yesterday: (1) 20,000 yuan to Hubei, delivered to Mr. Li Zuoshen in Hankou; (2) 20,000 yuan to Hunan, delivered by Mr. Li Zuoshen to Zhao Youqin; (3) 7,000 yuan to Southern Anhui, delivered to Zhang Gongheng and Qu Zhancheng in Wuhu; (4) 7,000 yuan to Central Anhui, delivered to Xu Pingxuan in Anqing, with an additional remittance of 1,000 yuan; (5) 6,000 yuan to Northern Anhui, delivered to Liu Zhensheng in Bengbu; (6) 20,000 yuan to Jiangsu, delivered to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association; (7) 20,000 yuan to Henan, delivered to Wang Pinggeng in Kaifeng; (8) 7,500 yuan to Guangdong, to be delivered to the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce after receiving funds from the Chaozhou Association, totaling 100,850 yuan.</p>
<p>Allocation of Relief Funds in Hubei Province Determined</p>
<p>The National Government Disaster Relief Committee received a telegram from Li Jin, the Director of Relief Operations in Hankou, reporting on the allocation of the 110,000 yuan in relief funds previously remitted from Shanghai: (1) 25,000 yuan to each of the counties severely affected by the disaster: Hanchuan, Mianyang, Huanggang, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Tianmen, Huangmei, and Echeng; (2) 16,000 yuan to each of the moderately affected counties: Yingcheng, Guangji, Jiayu, Jiangling, Yangxin, and Xianning; (3) 12,000 yuan to each of the less severely affected counties: Yunmeng, Puqi, Macheng, Anlu, and Xiangyang.</p>
<p>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</p>
<p>Establishment of the Northern Jiangsu Relief Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>The National Government Disaster Relief Committee has appointed Mr. Cheng Jingsheng as the Northern Jiangsu Relief Commissioner. The commissioner's office has now been established. The association recently received an official letter from the office, which reads as follows: "Dear Sirs, I, Jingsheng, have been appointed by the National Government Disaster Relief Committee as the Northern Jiangsu Relief Commissioner. I immediately traveled to Yangzhou and established an office at No. 42 Zuo Wei Street on September 21st, where I have begun using my official seal and appointing directors of investigation and relief for various counties to handle emergency relief and temporary assistance matters. I am notifying you separately. Sincerely, to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association."</p>
<p>Overview of the Disaster Situation in Ganyu County. The association received the following report from Ganyu: (The upper part is omitted) "In early August, continuous torrential rains caused widespread flooding. Subsequently, on the night of September 1st, a violent storm raged for eight hours. The already harvested autumn crops were mostly washed away. The beans, which were budding and forming pods, were destroyed. The autumn harvest is completely hopeless. We earnestly hope that all great philanthropists will provide relief." (The lower part is omitted)</p>
<p>Summary of the Jisheng Society's Relief Efforts in Southern Anhui</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society received a report from Zhai Fengxiang, the Director of Relief Operations in Southern Anhui, stating that the disaster situation in Xuancheng, Wuhu, Dangtu, Nanling, and Fanchang counties in Southern Anhui is extremely severe. The Emergency Relief Association and the Jisheng Society are jointly conducting relief efforts. However, the funds are insufficient to address the scale of the disaster in the five counties. We earnestly request that you raise and allocate more funds to alleviate the suffering. It has been found that, apart from a small number of disaster victims who can find ways to make a living and have already taken refuge elsewhere, those who are sheltering from the wind and rain in makeshift sheds on higher ground and embankments are all destitute. They can only be categorized based on the size of their families: families with three or fewer members are classified as third-class, families with four to five members are classified as second-class, and families with six or more members are classified as first-class. Moreover, the commercial port of Wuhu and the mountainous northern part of Xuancheng have received disaster victims who have migrated from counties such as Hehan. It is impossible to exclude them, so they are being treated equally and investigated for relief. The disaster area in Southern Anhui encompasses ten counties. The relief funds for the five severely affected counties of Xuannan, Dangwu, and Fan are far from sufficient. The situation in other counties, which are beyond our reach, can be imagined. Although the relief funds allocated by the two associations are considerable, they are like a drop in the bucket compared to the vast need. We sincerely hope that you will raise more funds and provide a continuous stream of assistance, so that those who have already received relief can be saved thoroughly, and those who have not yet received relief can still have hope.</p>
<p>Report from Disaster Victims in Yancheng</p>
<p>To the Shen Bao: Calamity has befallen our Yancheng. In the sixteenth year, over 300,000 soldiers passed through, requiring over 500,000 yuan in supplies. In the seventeenth and eighteenth years, we suffered consecutive droughts. Bandits occupied the city, and the losses were countless. Last year, bandits were rampant in the countryside, looting, kidnapping, burning, and killing, turning homes into ruins. The losses were also countless. This year, the rice crop initially showed signs of a good harvest in early summer. However, since entering the fu period, the upper river has opened three dams in succession, releasing floodwaters that submerged the entire region. It was already felt that it would be difficult to protect the crops. Fortunately, the weather was mostly clear, allowing for an early harvest. But misfortune did not come singly. The You Shao Transport Embankment collapsed at the same time, causing rapid and turbulent waves in an instant. All dams collapsed, with no exceptions. The water depth in the city reached over one zhang in deep areas and seven to eight chi in shallow areas. Countless people climbed onto rooftops and treetops, waiting to die. Cries for help could be heard for a hundred li. Fortunately, the water gates and the south gate of the city were blocked in advance, preventing flooding. However, due to leakage from the water gates, areas such as the Northwest Dizang Temple, Yayi Bathhouse, and the public sports field became flooded. The thatched and earthen houses of the poor were completely washed away. If the city was like this, the situation in the countryside can be imagined. Currently, there are over twenty refugee shelters in the city, but only over 5,000 people have been rescued. There are still hundreds of thousands of people who have not been rescued. Can we expect a single city to be able to relieve the disaster of an entire county? Xinghua's terrain is extremely low. Considering this year, the flood disaster is more severe in Yancheng. However, judging from the disasters of the past few years, the situation is unprecedented in Xinghua. Now, after reading the disaster reports in various Shanghai newspapers, the disaster situation in Xia, Xinghua is listed as severe, grouped together with Gao and Bao counties, which is no different from our Dongtai county (Dong has Runlong Port, and Yan has Xinyang Port, the amount of water discharged is the same; Dong has the Dafeng Yuhua Company's sluice gate, and Yan has the Taihe Dayou sluice gate, the harm of blocking and releasing water is also the same, and Dong's terrain is even higher than that of Yan), while the severe disaster situation in Yancheng has not been described in detail. Old Master Dong Zhu Zi of Aviation surveyed the disaster, and Mr. Leng Yuqiu and others stopped at Yu Hua. The disaster situation in Yancheng is mostly based on hearsay from neighboring counties, not a factual record. Those who spread the rumors are not hostile to our Yan, but their intention is nothing more than to reduce one point of disaster in their county and increase one point of relief in their county. At a time when everyone is struggling to save their own lives, such fabricated facts are also a characteristic of disaster areas. It depends on how the listeners perceive them. The so-called great men and gentlemen of Yancheng usually sit on salaries, have many henchmen, are skilled in soliciting lawsuits, and collude with the government for support. They have never cared about the suffering of the people. Even in the face of a major disaster, they show no awareness, enjoy lavish feasts, and laugh as usual. They have not even considered matters such as relief propaganda, resulting in the strange disaster not being widely known and the great relief not being universally applied (Mrs. Hatong donated 50,000 yuan for relief, including Xing and Dong, but not Yancheng, which is clear proof). Is this because the relief providers are abandoning our Yancheng people? It is because our Yancheng people are abandoning themselves. We deeply appreciate the efforts of your newspaper in publicizing this flood disaster. Therefore, we have presented the actual situation of the flood disaster in our county in a disorganized manner, hoping that it will be published in your newspaper so that all sectors will know the magnitude of the disaster in our county and provide appropriate relief, so that hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in our county can survive.

<p>The Qingjiang Qingsheng Branch's Second Letter to Mrs. Gailing Appealing for Relief reads: "Dear Mrs. Gailing, In our previous urgent telegram, we reported that Huaian and Siyang counties in northern Jiangsu were the first to suffer from the flood disaster, and the severity of the disaster was the greatest among other counties. Subsequently, Gaoyou and Shaobo also breached at the same time, and the tragic situation of the disaster victims was widely reported in the newspapers. We also learned that you have already issued a large sum of money to save them from starvation and drowning. Jiang Yun is grateful and admiring beyond words. The Shanghai Jisheng Relief Association and the Relief Association have entrusted our branch to handle emergency relief and seed distribution in the three counties of Huai, Huai, and Si. Each county will receive 20,000 yuan, totaling 60,000 yuan. We are currently preparing the procedures and will begin the investigation and distribution soon. However, the disaster is widespread, and the funds are limited, making it difficult to provide universal relief. We can only do our best. But the most important thing at present is that we are gradually entering late autumn, and winter is approaching. All the elderly and weak disaster victims in Huai, Yi, Si, You, and Shao who have nowhere to go must be provided with shelter. There are also homeless children who must be adopted. As for winter porridge factories to alleviate hunger, it is even more urgent and truly meritorious, with the aim of saving people. Now, we are writing to you again, hoping that you will continue to show great compassion and generously donate a large sum of money so that the survivors of the disaster in northern Jiangsu can be bathed in the sweet dew from the bottle. If you are willing to provide assistance, please send the relief funds directly to the Shanghai Flood Relief Association's three committee members, Wang Huangcheng, to be transferred to our branch for handling. Or, please send a special commissioner to Pu to preside over everything. Yuan Kai and Xilin will certainly follow and assist in the matter. Is there anything inappropriate? Please give us your precious guidance first, so that we can have a guideline. In this great disaster, saving people thoroughly is truly a way to leave a name for eternity and be immortal. Respectfully requesting your good health, Zhou Yuankai and Li Xilin of the Qingjiang Branch of the Chinese Jisheng Society."</p>
<p>The Director of the Hongkou Catholic Church Appeals for Relief</p>
<p>The Director of the Hongkou Catholic Church, Bian Detong, announced: "This year, floods are rampant, and over ten provinces are affected by the disaster, with tens of millions of people waiting for rescue. People from China and abroad are deeply saddened. As members of our church, we dare not lag behind others in this time of disaster relief and emergency assistance. In view of this, Bishop Hui convened a meeting of representatives from the four districts of Xujiahui, Yangjingbang, Dongjiadu, and Hongkou at the Hongkou Catholic Church on the 18th of this month to discuss relief methods. All the churches worked together with one heart and carried out the efforts together. Please ask all church members to donate generously to the disaster victims. We hereby send this letter, hoping that philanthropists, regardless of the amount, will do their best. I believe that our church members, who have always held the belief of loving others as ourselves, will certainly be eager to be at the forefront and enthusiastically rescue those in urgent need. Enclosed is a donation certificate. Please fill in the amount of your donation in the yuan and corner columns and send it along with the donation to our director. The disaster victims are in urgent need of help at this time. Please open your wallets as soon as possible and complete the donation within a week so that it can be collected and transferred to Bishop Hui for distribution, so that the disaster victims can benefit from it as soon as possible, expressing the intention of our church members to relieve their hunger and drowning. I respectfully appeal on their behalf, hoping for your consideration. September 22nd."</p>

<p>Below the Brothel</p>
<h3 id="e152">Two Prostitutes Flee Together <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Beaten Due to Lack of Business</p>
<p>Wandering on the Road After Escaping</p>
<p>Hiding and Sobbing Together, They Were Rescued</p>
<p>Tian Jinbao, a woman from Hankou, is in her early twenties, and Shen Caibao, a woman from Changshu, is currently eighteen years old. Both women were abducted from their hometowns at the age of sixteen and sold by the abductors to a brothel at No. 4 Shengji Lane, Beichujiaqiao in the French Concession. For several years, they have been forced by the madam to go out every night with a maid escort to solicit customers. In addition to going to various amusement venues to attract customers at 5:00 PM every night, they often return to the brothel after 12:00 AM. The maid's surveillance is stricter than that of a prisoner. If they still do not have any customers to accompany them overnight, they must stand at the entrance of the alley, waiting until dawn. If no one inquires about them, the madam will whip them, even using rattan sticks to beat them severely, leaving the two women's bodies covered in bruises. They could not bear the abuse. On the 21st of this month, they were beaten severely again for failing to attract customers. The madam said, "The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and you two unlucky stars are not making any business to cover expenses. Tomorrow, I will sell you to another place to see if you can still have a comfortable life." The two women were terrified upon hearing this and agreed to take advantage of the brothel's inattentiveness on the 22nd to escape secretly. However, because they were unfamiliar with the roads, they wandered the streets. That night, they fled aimlessly, waiting for dawn. Until about 10:00 PM the next day (the day before), the two women arrived near the Youche Wharf in Nanshi. They had not had any food or lodging for two days and were extremely tired from running day and night. At this point, they realized that although they had escaped from the fire pit, the future was uncertain, and they did not know where to settle down. Thinking of this, they could not help but feel sad and began to hide and sob together. The scene was witnessed by Liu Bingrong, a guard from the 18th post in the area. He brought the two women to the first branch of the first district. After the director of the branch preliminarily questioned them, the two women recounted their ordeal. The director ordered that a report be prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for placement. Director Chen was extremely angry upon hearing this and immediately sent the matter to the rescue section of the second department for proper handling. He also dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the vicious madam of the brothel, arrest her, and deal with her severely. Furthermore, he investigated the source of the abductors and the families of the two women.</p>

Currently, the funds raised have reached 5,000 yuan, and the county government has allocated over 30 mu of wasteland as a base. In addition, there are building materials such as bricks and stones, worth about 2,000 yuan. Therefore, it is hoped that construction will be realized soon. He deeply hoped that the association would provide financial assistance to facilitate the start of construction as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Questioning the Monk Dian Chan (Seeking Refuge in Buddhism to Study Buddhist Doctrine) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>I am a frustrated young man looking for a way to solve my problems. Some people advise me not to be discouraged and to strive in my career, while others invite me to seek the path of emptiness. Ultimately, driven by my circumstances, I have decided to seek refuge in Buddhism, but I need to prepare in advance. I have heard of a "Commentary on the Mahavairocana Sutra," but I don't know where to buy it. Also, I am not very clear on how to start studying Buddhist doctrine. My wavering spirit does not know which path to take. Your newspaper is all-encompassing and points out the way for those who are lost. Please use your valuable space to guide me and also provide guidance to others who are equally frustrated or on the wrong path. This will not only benefit me but also the masses.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your decision to seek refuge in Buddhism because you are frustrated and discouraged is fundamentally wrong. As the ancients said, "Becoming a monk is a matter for great men, not something that princes and generals can do." Sakyamuni, as a crown prince, became a monk entirely to solve the great problem of life and death. Therefore, he gave up his throne and personally practiced and attained enlightenment, becoming a Buddha. Then he went everywhere to preach and save all beings. This spirit of self-sacrifice to save the world is not something that princes and generals can do. From the Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, there was a system in our country where anyone who wanted to become a monk had to pass an examination by the government. They had to be qualified in terms of learning and aspirations before being granted a certificate allowing them to become a monk, called a "Dudie." In the early Qing Dynasty, this system was abolished, and people were allowed to become monks at will, turning the pure Buddhist community almost into a haven for fugitives and creating countless idle monks. This is entirely a social ill. If politics is on the right track and the social components are healthy, this kind of illness needs to be treated quickly. Since you are an ambitious young man, would you be willing to become a parasite of society? Look at Japan, which is also a Buddhist country. They can use the great fearless spirit of Buddhism to cultivate healthy citizens. Their monks are learned and can guide the people, which is very different from the situation in our country. Therefore, to study Buddhist doctrine, you need to know the true spirit of Buddhism. As for the "Commentary on the Mahavairocana Sutra," the newly revived Esoteric Buddhism Association in Huzhou is selling it, but it is a profound esoteric text that is definitely not for beginners to understand. If you want to know how to get started with Buddhist doctrine, you should first read a few books, listed below. After reading them, you will naturally find a way in.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Chen Qiufeng Wants to Separate from Her Mother-in-Law <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Otherwise, She Refuses to Live with Her Husband</p>
<p>Zhang Xuanzhong, a native of Yin County, Ningbo, resides at No. 8, Yifang, Bao'an Road, Dixiwei Road. He works as a clerk at the Da Lai Yang Firm. He married Chen Qiufeng. Initially, they were harmonious, but after a short time, Chen Qiufeng ran away with her belongings. Zhang then entrusted lawyer Chen Bingxing to post a warning in the newspaper. After repeated investigations, it was discovered that Chen Qiufeng was hiding in a certain place. Zhang went to pick her up, but was unsuccessful. He then hired lawyer Chen to file a petition with the First Special District Court requesting cohabitation. Both parties were summoned and appeared in court. Chen Qiufeng did not object to cohabitation, but demanded that she must live separately from her mother-in-law. Therefore, the mediation failed. Zhang then formally filed a lawsuit. The Special Court transferred the case to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. The defendant also hired lawyer Liu Zuwang to file a defense and a counterclaim. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglu held a special session in the Third Court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Zhang Xuanzhong, appeared in court with his lawyer, Chen Bingxing. The defendant, Chen Qiufeng, did not appear, but was represented by lawyer Liu Zuwang. According to Zhang Xuanzhong's testimony, he is 25 years old and a native of Ningbo. The defendant, Chen Qiufeng, is indeed his wife. They were married in their hometown in 1926 and then came to Shanghai together. After living together for only a few months, she returned to Ningbo on some pretext. This time, she left without saying goodbye. Now that the lawsuit has been filed, she insists on living separately from my mother, but in fact, it is difficult to agree to this because my income is meager and I rely on it to support my elderly mother and younger siblings. If we live separately, my mother and younger siblings will not be taken care of. (Asked) Who was the matchmaker? (Answered) Zhang Guixiao, a public uncle in my clan. The judge ordered that he be invited to the next hearing. Next, the defendant's lawyer stated Chen Qiufeng's age and origin, saying that the defendant is 23 years old this year, a native of Ningbo, and lives at Chunhe Coal Shop in Dongtingshan Lane, Guanqiao, Nanshi, Shanghai. The plaintiff requested a divorce in the Special Court, but then changed it to cohabitation. However, the defendant does not want a divorce because she has a bad relationship with her mother-in-law, so she requests to live separately. Previously, when the defendant returned to Ningbo, the plaintiff posted a warning in the newspaper, accusing the defendant of running away with her belongings. However, the plaintiff had sent two letters, one to the defendant's brother and one to the plaintiff's uncle, which proves that the plaintiff knew the defendant's whereabouts. How can he say that she ran away? Moreover, the defendant had been ill and spent a lot of money. Now she is counterclaiming for living expenses and medical expenses before the lawsuit, totaling 450 yuan, and 35 yuan per month for future living expenses. The judge ordered that the hearing be continued.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Assassination Case of French Merchant to be Judged <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Zhong Ziqing Released</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 15th of last month, at the New French Concession West Xinqiao Street No. 113 Fa Shang New Hotel, a reporter claiming to be Wang Xi opened room number two. Around 6 p.m., a robbery and murder case occurred. Xia Yongsheng and a Mr. Xue were killed on the spot, and Jiang Yihan (Chen Yiming) and Zhong Ziqing were injured. After the murderer escaped, the injured were taken to Renji Hospital by the police. Chen Yiming died the next day due to his injuries. Zhong Ziqing's injuries were not fatal, and he was fortunate to survive. The bodies of the three deceased were examined and collected by the police after reporting to the court. After the incident, the next day, the French police special agency captured the murderer Yan Jinbiao from Jiangbei and suspects Dai Yunhong and Yan's mistress, Ms. Zhang, and sent them to the Second Special Court. According to Yan's confession, he was hired by Li Guocheng to commit the shooting murder and also admitted to committing three robbery cases in the French Concession. He was ordered to be detained for further questioning after Zhong Ziqing's injuries healed. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now that Zhong's wound has healed, the police sent him to the court yesterday. Judge Luo Renji sat in the criminal court for further questioning. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case, stating that the police found no criminal evidence against Zhong Ziqing, so no prosecution was filed and requesting a hearing. Zhong Ziqing testified that he is 41 years old, a native of Yangzhou, and used to run a shoe store. This year, he served as a conscription committee member of the Ninth Division and resigned on August 6. On the afternoon of the 15th, he was invited by the deceased Xia Yongsheng to the Fa Shang Hotel to discuss a job as an inspector on a small steamer. When he arrived at the hotel, he had a headache due to the cold and was lying in bed. Less than ten minutes later, someone came and started shooting. He was shot four times, and his left arm bone was broken. Although he has recovered, the wound under his left shoulder has not healed and is still festering. He does not know the defendant Yan Jinbiao, but only knows Xia Yongsheng. He has always been upright and requests an investigation. Yan Jinbiao testified that he does not know Zhong. The judge then ordered the debate to begin. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi argued that the defendant Yan Jinbiao had confessed to one murder and three robbery crimes, and the evidence was conclusive. He requested that the case be handled in accordance with Articles 246 and 383 of the Criminal Law. The defendants were represented by lawyer Wang Shizong, who was appointed by the court to provide legal aid. He argued that it could not be proven whether the murder was committed by Yan or by the fugitive murderer. However, the murder was due to an uneven distribution of loot. Since Yan's responsibility for the murder cannot be proven, he should be given leniency. The second and third defendants were completely unrelated. Dai only went to inquire about the news after the event, and Ms. Zhang was only Yan's mistress. They should be declared innocent. The judge also questioned Tang A’gen, a waiter at the Chunjiang Hotel at 309 Caishi Street, who testified that on August 14, someone opened room 21, but he did not remember the face. Yan testified that he did not open the room at the Chunjiang Hotel. Judge Luo announced the end of the debate and that the verdict would be announced on the morning of October 1. Zhong Ziqing was released and ordered to appear in court at any time if summoned, and to report any change of address. Zhong thanked the judge and left.</p>

<p>Taken to Changzhou to Cohabit</p>
<p>Person Involved Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>Wang Jingyu, a native of Shandong, lives at No. 114, Alcock Road. He works as a gatekeeper No. 1235 for the police. His daughter, Xiuying, is 20 years old and was engaged to Lu Caifu last year. However, Lu does not engage in proper work. Last year, he was sentenced to one year in prison by the court for robbery, so the marriage has been delayed. Yesterday morning at 6:30, Lu and several others hired car No. 18075 from the Jinxing Motor Company on Yangshupu Road and drove to Wang's house. When Xiuying went out, they dragged her into the car and sped away. At that time, a girl named Ruan Xiangyun happened to be going out to get water and, seeing this, ran to tell Wang Jingyu, who reported it to the Huishan Police Station. After investigation by detective Zhao Duansheng, it was learned that Dong Xiting, a native of Changzhou, was involved in the case. Dong was arrested and, after questioning, confessed that he was invited by Lu to help. Now Wang Xiuying has been taken to Changzhou by Lu and others to cohabit. The police also summoned Ruan Xiangyun and the driver, Zhu Zhaomeng. Ruan identified Dong as being at the scene at the time, and Zhu confirmed that the car was hired by Dong and the fare was paid by Dong. The detectives then detained Dong and sent him to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case and said that the police were prosecuting under the crime of hindering freedom under the Criminal Law. Since it is still necessary to arrest the accomplices, he requested permission to reschedule the hearing. Ruan Xiangyun and others then proved everything. The defendant testified that he was an aircraft mechanic in the Xiamen Aviation Team and was deceived by Lu Caifu. Judge Shen Bingrong reviewed the confession and ordered that the case be rescheduled for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Revised Detailed Rules for Raw Silk Inspection <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Quality Inspection Temporarily Free of Charge</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has been implementing raw silk inspection for more than a year. The Ministry of Industry has now revised the detailed rules for raw silk inspection of the bureau, changing them to thirteen articles of the Regulations for Raw Silk Inspection, which have been promulgated by the Ministry and implemented. The original detailed rules have been abolished. Furthermore, silk factories in various places do not pay much attention to the quality inspection of raw silk, so it is impossible to distinguish the quality of the products, which is a major obstacle to improving the silk industry. In order to promote the improvement of raw silk quality, the ministry has stipulated in the aforementioned regulations that quality inspection will be temporarily free of charge to encourage it. The regulations are as follows: Regulations for Raw Silk Inspection by the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, promulgated by decree of the Ministry of Industry on August 20, 1931. (Article 1) These regulations are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2, Item 3, and 21 of the Provisional Regulations for Commodity Inspection (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations). (Article 2) Raw silk inspection is divided into the following two categories: (1) Quantity inspection, including gross weight, net weight, and degumming; (2) Quality inspection, including uniformity, cleanliness, clarity, cohesion, tenacity, and elongation (single and double strand). (Article 3) All raw silk exported abroad shall comply with the provisions of these regulations, be inspected by the Inspection Bureau to obtain the gross weight, and be issued a certificate before being allowed to declare for export. (Net weight and degumming in quantity inspection and quality inspection shall be requested freely by merchants.) (Article 4) Raw silk trade shall comply with the gross weight inspected by the Inspection Bureau as the standard for calculating value. (Article 5) The following raw silk items are exempt from inspection: (1) Diplopia and waste silk; (2) Non-domestic products; (3) Sample silk within one dan; (4) Non-sale items for competitions or scientific research. The aforementioned diplopia and waste silk shall be marked on the outside of the package. (Article 6) When a merchant or trader requests inspection, they shall fill out an inspection request form, submit it to the Inspection Bureau along with the inspection fee for the raw silk, and obtain a receipt for the inspection separately. (Article 7) The sampling method for raw silk inspection is as follows: (1) Gross weight inspection: (1) The number of packages to be inspected shall be 40% of the total number of packages in each batch. If there is a remainder, it shall be proportionally increased. (2) Two samples of silk shall be taken from each piece, each sample weighing 450 cm. (3) No more than two strips shall be drawn from each roasted strip package. (4) The samples shall be placed in lead trays, one tied with a red label and one tied with a white label. (2) Degumming inspection: (1) The sample strip shall be one-tenth of the weight of each batch. If there is a remainder, it shall be proportionally increased. (2) Ten hanks shall be selected from each piece of raw silk, and 100 cm shall be taken from the ten hanks as samples, divided into two parts, one of which shall be tied with a cotton tape label. (3) Quality inspection: (1) For those that must be inspected on each piece, at least ten silk strips shall be sampled. When drawing, the inside of the piece shall be covered, but no more than one strip per package. (2) For each batch of raw silk, those that need to be inspected in detail in five or ten pieces shall be sampled four strips from each piece, but no more than one strip per package. (9) For each batch of raw silk, if there are more than ten pieces, ten pieces shall be regarded as one batch, and each batch shall be marked with consecutive numbers, and samples shall be taken separately in accordance with the previous method. If there are less than five pieces, samples shall be drawn equally according to the number of pieces. (The samples taken in items (1) and (2) of this section may be used for several types of inspections. (Article 8) The order of inspection shall be based on the order of reporting for inspection and shall be completed within 14 hours after receiving the inspection request form and raw silk. (Article 9) The unpacking and packing of raw silk during inspection shall be done by the Inspection Bureau, but the person reporting for inspection shall be informed to be present. (Article 10) After the raw silk inspection is completed, the gross weight inspection shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the regulations, and a mark shall be added to each package of raw silk, and an export certificate shall be issued. (Article 11) The raw silk sent to the bureau for inspection shall be returned to the bureau with the original receipt after the inspection is completed. If there is a delay, the Inspection Bureau may return the raw silk to the person reporting for inspection, and the shipping fee shall be borne by the person reporting for inspection. (Article 12) The amount of inspection fee is as follows: (1) Quantity inspection: (A) Gross weight factory silk, 2 yuan per piece, tribute silk 1 yuan per piece; (B) Net weight 1 yuan per piece; (C) Degumming each time (sampling silk ten skeins using one hundred centimeters) 2 yuan (2) Quality inspection is temporarily free of charge; (3) Warehouse rent is 5 jiao per piece per month. If it is less than one month, it shall be calculated as one month. (Article 13) These regulations shall come into force from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Publication of Cholera Prevention Report <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>No. 9</p>
<p>The National Harbor Quarantine Office published its ninth cholera prevention report, stating that: (1) The cholera situation in Shanghai this past week (September 12 to 19) has not improved or worsened much. There were 40 cases in the Chinese area, with no deaths. However, there were 30 cases in the International Settlement (2 foreigners), with one death. There were 6 cases in the French Concession, with no deaths. In total, there were 76 cases this past week, with only one death, proving that the effectiveness of scientific vaccination is not insignificant. (2) There have been reports of fatal cholera cases in the disaster areas of Wuchang and Hankou. (The Heishan refugee camp has already built accommodations for hundreds of people, and there are approximately 30 cases in Hankou City.) Typhoid fever and dysentery have long been prevalent diseases in the area. Since the discovery of cholera, the epidemic prevention police have been performing their duties in difficult situations. Sitting in grass sheds, the disaster victims are enduring hunger and waiting to die, and their resistance to the epidemic is very weak. Therefore, the authorities must do their best to prevent it. According to medical reports, the distribution of vaccinations for cholera and typhoid fever has been expanded to all disaster victims in the refugee camps. Due to the lack of water and the large number of flies, epidemic prevention and disaster relief work is extremely difficult. (3) The medical officer stationed in Songhu found several cholera patients on a Hankou steamer some days ago. For example, on September 18, there were 6 suspected cholera cases. The patients have been transferred to the Wusong Anti-Epidemic Hospital of this office. Three of them have been proven by bacterial examination to be true cholera, but all have been cured after treatment. These patients all seem to come from Xiantao Town in Mianyang County, about 360 miles west of Hankou. (4) Hankou has been declared a cholera epidemic area by this office. All ships from that area must anchor at designated locations for inspection when passing through Nanjing and Wusong. All passengers who have not been vaccinated should be vaccinated before disembarking. (5) On September 18, Japanese militarists invaded areas of our country in southern Manchuria, such as Liaoyang, Andong, Niuzhuang, Changchun, and Jilin. It is inhumane to take advantage of our country's disaster. Therefore, the Flood Relief Committee has refused to cooperate with Japanese medical officers and has returned all disaster relief items donated by Japan, such as money, food, medicine, and hospital ships, to show its displeasure with the militarists' atrocities and dispel the enthusiasm of Japanese philanthropists.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Tongzhou Buoy Moved <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Notice No. 1012 of the Marine Affairs Section of the Customs states: This patrol service has investigated the movement of the Tongzhou buoy within the jurisdiction of the Zhenjiang Customs, as well as the installation of warning lights, and has listed the situation as follows: The Tongzhou buoy has now been moved. From the new location, the Tongzhou Customs is at 58 degrees north and west (according to the compass direction), at a distance of 4.45 English nautical miles. In order to assist ships passing between the Liuhai Sandbank North Bank light buoy and the Tongzhou buoy at night, and to avoid the Qingtian Reef, two unlisted warning lights are hung directly on the Tongzhou buoy, about twelve feet apart, and will be opened on September 30 this year for implementation, without further notice. The line between the Liuhai Sandbank North Bank light buoy and the Tongzhou light buoy marks the middle of the navigation channel, about four-tenths of an English nautical mile from the north bank of the Qingtian Reef.

<p>Sentenced to Five Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Soldier Meng Zhaoru (alias Wang Yucai) from Anhui, carrying forty-six counterfeit five-yuan banknotes with the intention of using them in the city, was apprehended by Chinese Constable No. 2264 of the International Settlement Police Station on North Henan Road at 6:15 PM on May 4th of this year. He was handed over to the First Special District Court. During the interrogation, the judge stated that Meng was an active military member and thus the court would not handle the case. After a final decision, he and the counterfeit money would be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. The police station, disagreeing with this ruling, appealed. The Second Higher Branch Court, after deliberation, overturned the original ruling and sent the case back to the original court for review. Consequently, the police station sent Meng back to the Special Court for questioning. A verdict was reserved. Yesterday morning, the verdict was announced by Judge Feng Shide in the Second Criminal Court. The main text of the verdict stated that Meng Zhaoru, intending to use and possessing counterfeit general banknotes, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. The number of days spent in detention before the final judgment will be deducted at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The forty-six counterfeit banknotes are to be confiscated.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Aviation in Malaya by Qiu Bincun <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Aviation is a new industry that has emerged only in the last few decades. Since the rise of aviation, the concept of national sovereignty has also changed. Previously, the general understanding of national sovereignty was limited to territorial and maritime sovereignty. Now, we believe that national sovereignty should include airspace in addition to territory and sea. In ancient times, during the closed-door era, national military strength relied entirely on the army. In recent times, after the opening of maritime borders, national military strength focused on the navy. In the future, with the development of aviation, national military strength will not rely on the army or the navy, but on the air force. Moreover, aviation occupies not only the most important position in military affairs, but also the most important position in politics, diplomacy, economics, transportation, and culture. Therefore, countries around the world are competing to develop the aviation industry in preparation for political, military, economic, and cultural struggles. In Southeast Asia, with the independent government of Siam and the resident governments of Britain, the Netherlands, France, and the United States, aviation is of course being pursued vigorously and without reservation. The author now discloses the situation of the aviation industry in British Malaya to show a glimpse of its progress. While it is said to be about the aviation industry in Malaya, it is actually related to Britain, India, Australia, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and other places.</p>
<p>(I) Air Routes Between Malaya and Britain and Australia</p>
<p>Britain's colonies are all over the five continents. Fortunately, there are twelve important colonies in the world. To protect these colonies, Britain has adopted the so-called Three C Policy. The Three C Policy is Cape Town, Cairo, Calcutta. More specifically, it means that Britain, starting from Europe, must occupy Cape Town in Africa, then Cairo in Egypt, and then Calcutta in Asia in order to protect the colonies along the way, especially the two pieces of fat, India and Australia. Therefore, its air routes also follow the good Three C Policy and set up various networks. The matters of aviation and flights between Malaya and Britain and Australia are described as follows:</p>
<p>The first flight of the British-Australian air mail service has already begun. The aircraft City of Cairo, responsible for the flight from Karachi to Darwin, arrived in Singapore the day before yesterday afternoon and left yesterday morning. Governor Sir Cecil Clementi specially entrusted the aircraft to bring a letter, wishing success to British-Australian aviation. The British Colonial Secretary, Lord Passfield, also sent a letter with the Deputy Governor, Mr. Scott, which was delivered the day before yesterday. The letter is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Scott,</p>
<p>The British-Australian air mail service has now opened. The connection between Britain and Malaya will be closer, and transportation between the two places will be faster, which is a hopeful reality. I am very pleased to be able to express my satisfaction on the occasion of the first flight of the British-Australian airmail service through Singapore. I believe that the residents of the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States will also be very satisfied with this move. The Malayan government can vigorously support the British-Australian scheduled flights to achieve their goal of success. I am confident that they will do their best to support it in this difficult economic environment.</p>
<p>Lord Passfield, British Colonial Secretary, April 1, 1931. After receiving this letter, Deputy Governor Scott immediately replied to Passfield by telegram. The telegram said, "The letter delivered by the British-Australian airmail on April 1 has been received and is greatly appreciated. The Malayan government has taken note of and is prepared to vigorously support the Imperial airmail service to Australia to achieve its goal of success, in response to your sincere wishes."</p>
<p>It is noted that the aircraft City of Cairo, which arrived in Singapore the day before yesterday and left yesterday, is responsible for the journey from Karachi to Darwin. It left Seletar Airfield early yesterday morning, hoping to arrive in Surabaya by late afternoon or evening yesterday. If this is not possible, it will stop in Batavia.</p>
<p>There were four bags of letters loaded in Singapore destined for Australia, and one bag destined for Surabaya. There were hundreds of letters destined for Australia, including 489 sent from Singapore, 169 sent from the Federated Malay States, 114 sent from Kedah, and 84 sent from Johor.</p>
<p>The aircraft is scheduled to arrive in Darwin tomorrow (Sunday), which is the fifteenth day after leaving Britain. The journey of 11,194 miles only took 15 days, which is very fast. It will then leave Darwin on April 27 and return to Britain, arriving at Croydon Aerodrome around May 14. Therefore, the aircraft will come to Singapore again around May 29.</p>
<p>We have already described the trial use of British-Australian airmail in the previous paragraphs. Now we translate the various regulations and notices issued by the Secretariat of the Post Office of the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States regarding the flight of this aircraft as follows:</p>
<p>A. All mail related to this second British-Australian airmail trial flight will be collected in Singapore on April 17 (first time) and May 8 (second time) of this year and forwarded to Surabaya, Java, and various parts of Australia. B. The postage for all mail will be the standard postage plus airmail postage as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For mail sent via Surabaya to Java or other parts of the Dutch East Indies: 12 cents per half ounce.</p>
<p>(2) For mail sent to Darwin: 16 cents per half ounce.</p>
<p>(3) For mail sent to other parts of Australia and New Zealand: 40 cents per half ounce.</p>
<p>C. Mail returning from Australia to Britain will be collected in Singapore on April 30 (first time) and May 20 (second time) and forwarded to Delhi and London. The postage for all mail will be the standard postage plus airmail postage as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For mail sent via Delhi to various parts of India: 16 cents per half ounce.</p>
<p>(2) For mail sent via London to various parts of Britain and Europe and North America: 42 cents per half ounce.</p>
<p>D. Letters, postcards, printed matter, merchandise, and parcels can all be sent by this aircraft, but only by registered mail and not by insurance.</p>
<p>E. In addition to following the usual mailing procedures, mail sent by this aircraft must also be affixed with a blue airmail label (available at all post offices) in the upper left corner and must include the following words:</p>
<p>(1) For mail sent to Java, Australia, and New Zealand: "By Air Mail British Australian Flight"</p>
<p>(2) For mail sent via Delhi to various parts of India: "By Air Mail Singapore Delhi"</p>
<p>(3) For mail sent via London to various parts of Britain and Europe and North America: "By Air Mail Singapore London"</p>
<p>F. The above airmail postage is in addition to the standard postage. If the mail is registered, the registration fee should also be paid according to the usual regulations, and then the above airmail postage should be added. If the regulations are not followed, the mail will be shelved and not delivered.</p>
<p>G. All mail from outside Singapore must arrive in Singapore by night train the night before mailing to facilitate inspection and mailing to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>(II) Aviation Between Malaya and the Netherlands</p>
<p>We have briefly described the matters of flights between Malaya and Britain and Australia. Here, we will specifically discuss aviation between Malaya and the Netherlands. When aviation in Southeast Asia reaches its peak, Java in the Dutch East Indies will be at its center. The scheduled mail flights (twice a week) from the Dutch capital to Batavia have already dropped off mail for Malaya at the Alor Setar Airport. It has been decided that the route will be extended to Australia by the end of this month. This plan to extend the route has been strongly supported by many large businesses in the Dutch East Indies, who have decided to raise 40,000 Dutch guilders to support the development of this project. This plan was originally initiated by Dutch Air Force Officer Batiste. In the future, the aircraft transferring mail to Australia will be piloted by Batiste. The aircraft is a Fokker F7A six-seater aircraft named BbelTasman (the same model as the Cross aircraft piloted by Kingsford Smith and the mail aircraft between Singapore and Batavia). In addition to Batiste as the pilot, there is also a second-class engineer, Moro, as an assistant. Moro is an employee of the Dutch East Indies Aviation Department and also serves as the aircraft's radio equipment engineer and repairman. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e184">On Urban Zoning <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Wei</p>
<p>By Dong Xiujia</p>
<p>"On Urban Zoning" by Mr. Dong Xiujia is a specialized book discussing the issue of urban zoning systems. The author is one of the leading municipal scholars in the country. Here, the author not only strongly advocates the necessity of urban zoning but also earnestly indicates the principles of urban zoning. Originally, municipal science was a science that emerged in the 20th century, so the urban zoning system is a method recently invented by cities around the world. Its evolutionary history is very short, but the fact that this urban zoning system has been adopted by various countries proves that this system is of great benefit to municipal administration and cannot be ignored by us municipal scholars.</p>
<p>We know that when cities in various countries were first constructed, they adopted a laissez-faire approach in order to attract a large population. There were no laws or regulations to restrain them, so there were no restrictions on buildings in the city. As a result, all buildings were uneven in height, unequal in size, and land use was chaotic. As a result, the sunlight and air for citizens, shops, and residences were suffocated, and public health was out of the question. However, "In recent years, the population of cities in various countries has increased daily, and industry and commerce have developed. City residents are clustered in the city without order, resulting in housing problems and health problems. Cities in various countries, feeling the non-existence of the laissez-faire approach, have followed each other in advocating the urban zoning system. The first to adopt it were cities in Germany, followed by other cities in Europe. Now, countries in the Americas and Japan have also stipulated zoning laws and earnestly implemented them. After implementation, citizens live in separate zones in an orderly manner, urban health is gradually improved, and citizens' lives are also improving day by day." (Preface) It can be seen that the practical function of the urban zoning system and its influence are indeed extremely great.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four chapters: 1. Introduction; 2. Zoning Law According to Land Use; 3. Zoning Law According to Building Capacity; 4. Conclusion. The author first describes the process of various countries adopting the zoning system and the main points of their zoning system, then discusses the zoning system of our major cities, and finally compares the various systems to explain the advantages and disadvantages, so as to provide a reference for our cities.</p>
<p>In the introduction, the author explains that the current division of urban zoning in various countries is generally stipulated by law. As for the power to stipulate zoning, in general, unitary countries are authorized by the central government to cities, while federal governments are authorized by the governments of each state to cities. We must recognize this legal basis. Secondly, the author introduces the theories of urban zoning by municipal scholars from various countries, such as Williams, Bassett, and Nolen. The author also criticizes the fact that citizens of our cities cannot understand the meaning of zoning.</p>
<p>"Zoning Law According to Land Use," the author first introduces the adoption of zoning laws according to land use by various countries and the main points of their zoning laws. According to this system, the most widely adopted city is Frankfurt am Main in Germany. Later, cities in Germany adopted it, and it spread to Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden. Britain also adopted it in 1909. Now, Canada, the United States, and Japan have also mostly adopted this zoning principle. Then, the author describes the adoption of zoning laws according to land use by our cities and the main points of their zoning. The following are the author's opinions provided in "The Principles of Urban Zoning System According to Land Use":</p>
<p>The author advocates that when this zoning law is adopted, it can be divided into "heavy industrial zone, light industrial zone, large and small commercial zone, residential zone, and municipal administrative zone, etc." At the same time, for clarity, the author details several principles for dividing various zones: (1) Areas near railways and rivers should be designated as large commercial or industrial zones because of their convenient transportation; (2) Areas close to mountains and rivers or with more forests should be designated as residential zones; (3) A small commercial zone should be delineated near residential zones; (4) Parks, lakes, ponds, and small hills and mounds in various parts of the city should be specially preserved and repaired and cultivated for citizens to visit and rest, so that the city air can be harmonized; (5) The central point of the city should be designated as the city center zone, and the municipal administrative zone can be close to the large commercial zone, or it can be stipulated to be attached to the large commercial zone; (6) The residential zones of a city can be distributed in various places, but in any case, they cannot be close to the large commercial zone or industrial zone; (7) Scenic spots should be drawn near the city to give the city the flavor of a garden city; (8) Within the possible scope, the old commercial zone should be temporarily preserved, and after the new urban area is developed, the appropriate zone should be stipulated according to the trend of development.</p>
<p>"Zoning Law According to Building Capacity" was also initiated in German cities. Its purpose is to improve urban health, eliminate fire hazards, and increase the magnificence and beauty of street appearance. In recent years, most countries in Europe and the United States have also approved of it. In "Zoning Law According to Building Area," the author also first describes the general state of adoption by cities in various countries, and then describes the adoption situation of our cities. In "Zoning Law According to Building Height," the author also describes it as usual. As for the principles of this zoning law, the author believes that there should also be the following standards:</p>
<p>For those belonging to zoning according to building area: (1) The standard should be the location of the land, and the area occupied by the buildings in the city should not be stipulated as the same; (2) The standard should be the size of the base, and the area occupied by the size should not be limited to the same; (3) The land in the central area of a city should be occupied by less area by the buildings, and the land outside should be more; (4) The land in the middle of a base should be occupied by less area by the buildings, and the land in the outer circle should be more; (5) The land occupied by the buildings in the industrial and commercial zones can be more, and the land in the residential zones can be less; For those belonging to zoning according to building height: (1) The height of buildings in residential zones should be the lowest; (2) The commercial zone can be higher than the residential and industrial zones; (3) The industrial zone can be slightly higher than the residential zone; (4) The height of buildings on two sides of the street should be slightly lower than the height of buildings on one side of the street; (5) The height of wooden buildings should be lower than the height of brick buildings; (6) The height of brick buildings should be lower than the height of reinforced concrete buildings; (7) The height of buildings in the outer circle area can be slightly higher than that in the middle area; (8) The height of buildings at the corner of a base can be slightly higher than that in the middle.</p>
<p>The above points should be paid attention to by those who manage urban construction.</p>
<p>Now, the number of cities in our country that have established municipal administration is increasing day by day. "It is naturally very good for our cities to adopt the zoning system now, but two points should be noted: First, before dividing the height of buildings and stipulating the area of building zones, the area should be divided according to land use, and the area divided according to land use should be the standard for the height and area of buildings in each zone, so that the restrictions in each zone can be appropriate and the needs of each zone can be suitable. Second, attention should be paid to the future, not the past. Although the area has been divided and the height and area of buildings have been stipulated, old buildings that interfere with the zoning system can only be allowed to exist temporarily. When they are rebuilt in the future, they should be ordered to be rebuilt in accordance with the regulations. They cannot be ordered to be rebuilt in accordance with the zoning regulations after the zoning system has been established, which violates the purpose of the law not pursuing the past and only causes various disputes. However, new buildings should always be built in accordance with the zoning regulations, and should not be leniently accommodated. This is what is meant by paying attention to the future and not pursuing the past."</p>
