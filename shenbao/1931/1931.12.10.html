<p>至日軍撤盡即行停止</p>
<p>但勦匪權字樣已删除</p>
<p>日本要求修改第五段</p>
<p>定今日續開公開會議</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯理事會公開會議、今日下午五時零五分開會、主席白里安宣讀决議案草案、嗣即逐條加以說明即所謂主席宣言者是、白氏說明時、未曾提及剿匪權利、旋理事會决定星期四下午續開公開會議、（十日晨二時到國民電）</p>
<p>（馬黎）國聯理事會公開會議内所提决議案、包含六欵、第一欵、重行確定本月三十日决議案、第二欵、規定兩政府取一應必要手段、免使時局益增嚴重、第三欵、雙方各將發展情形隨時報告理事會、第四欵、規定各會員國中立視察員繼續將發展情形隨時報告理事會、第五欵、派調查委員五人前往滿洲、將足以影響國際關係危及中日和平之一切環境、報告理事會、該委員會不預問中日直接交涉與軍事行動、第六欵、下次理事會議定一月二十五日召集、在此期間請主席注意遼案、倘遇必要時、得臨時召集特别會議、至主席宣言、則對於决議案逐欵加以說明、關於第一欵則聲明理事會認九月三十日議案、有最大之重要、第二欵則說明日政府自認有保護日僑之權利、不僅在滿鐵沿線附近、且在日僑目下僑居地方之附近一帶、但一俟日兵撤回南滿附屬地、此項保護權利當然終止、第四欵則說明中立視察員將與雙方接觸、第五欵則說明調查團職權無地界限制、但不從事於軍事行動或中日直接交涉（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）本日並非行政院最末次開會之日、實反乎全體一致之希望、緣今晨東京來電、謂日本要求公開會議從緩舉行、有以此事詢之日本代表團云、最後訓令能否於午後開會之前奉到、尚不可定、但晨間四時東京發來一電、業已收到、據該電云、請訓之電正在翻譯、本代表團已將此種事實通知行政院、午後舉行公開會議與否、應由行政院决定云云、至國聯會秘書處則宣稱、關於延期開會一層尚未接到日本正式要求、或者將于午後提出、但無論如何公開會議必當舉行、屆時將朗讀議决案及宣言、日本若提出要求、則投票表决將延至明日舉行、午前十二委員會業將文字加以修正、已無何種重要困難、久經渴望之協定、如此可當衆宣告成立、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）十二理事國代表復於今晨十一時三十分開秘密會議、研究主席將在公開大會發表之宣言、至十二時三十分休會、在秘密會議以前、則有起草委員會於十一時十五分集會、斟酌决議案與主席宣言之字句、現公開會議雖定下午五時（一說四時）開會、但據日代表團消息、芳澤將在會塲要求休會至星期四、俾可剔淸關於决議案第五節之歧異意見、故當十二理事秘密會議時、理事會能否在星期四以前開公開會議、表决其所擬决議案、已覺難於確定、據可靠消息、中國施總代表將在公開大會宣言、要求日兵於最早的可能時全部撤回、並將保留提出國聯會章第十五欵之權利、或保留提出凱洛格非戰公約或華府九國公約之　利、倘主席宣言内含有日軍剿匪權利之保留、則施總代表將以中國政府名義、聲明日本在中國領土内執行警權、爲國際公法所不能認可、作爲保留、又國聯秘書廳今日向新聞記者表示、東京政府顯然發生誤會、原擬决議案第五欵之末句、即規定調查團抵遼而日本猶未撤兵時之行</p>
<p>動者、今已用較温和之形式、移入主席宣言之内、此種宣言、在法律上旣無拘束力、當然無日本接受之必要、而日代表亦儘可提出相對之聲明、故實未見日本有今日不能接受决議案之理由云、（九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）十二理事今午秘密會議時、暫定公開會議於下午四時召集、倘公開會議能按時舉行通過决議案、則理事會第三次之特别會議、即行休會、惟公開會議之能否舉行、全繫於中日政府之最後訓令、中日代表已於今晨接到本國政府訓令、此時仍在譯電之中、倘此項訓令未能使理事會認爲滿意、則公開會議勢將展至星期五、然國聯中人表示認理事會對於所爭各點、旣在實際上悉已勉從日本、而中國似宜急欲有一種協定、阻止日人之前進、逆料兩國當可接受該决議案也、至中立區域提議、今已確定放棄、理事會僅須雙方能保證維持原狀、俾保存目下已有之非正式中立區域、認爲於願已足、故目下唯一問題祇有調查團一層、至調查委員人數、頃聞將有五人、今晨西班牙代表曾提議六人或七人、當爲秘密會議所否决（九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（東京）路透社從可恃方面探悉、日本準備接受國聯議案、祗須議案第五段删去關於調查團職權範圍之文字耳、此節在日人視之、認爲限定日本撤兵之時期、故不爲東京所可接受、議長宣言中揷入日本剿匪權保留之議、亦可爲日本所容納、不過詞句須稍修改耳、聞日政府現訓令芳澤請稍展緩國聯行政會最後會議之舉行、（九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日國聯理事會决定星期三下午五時舉行公開大會、倘屆時所提决議案、不能獲得一至同意、將於星期四再召集公開大會、美大使道威斯已用無綫電話、將决議案内容報告美政府、徵詢意見、然後轉達白里安、旋理事會十二國理事舉行秘密會議、對於起草委員會所草决議案原文、分别電達本國政府請訓、十二理事之秘密會議於下午五時十分舉行聞其時美政府已訓令道威斯、將美政府贊成該决議案意旨轉達白里安、秘密會議、討論一時三十分後、即於六時三刻休會、惟當此國聯理事會距其所認爲調解遼案辦法已相去不遠時、忽又有日軍佔據營口之非正式報告、致國聯中人頓現黯淡之容、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯行政會舉行公開會議後、將舉行非公開會議、討論此次在巴黎開會經費事、今日聞法政府願担任巨欵、因該會原擬在日内瓦舉行、後就白里安之便、改在巴黎舉行故也、今日此間日代表團發表公報、内引一電、述十二月四日張學良軍隊在錦州區之兵力與佈防情形（九日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c21">如何領會馬將軍之敎訓 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>今日我全國人民之對於馬占山將軍無論老穉無分賢愚無不一致推崇欽敬左萬衆遥維此擐甲策馬於冰天雪地與暴軍作艱苦抗持之健者同視爲我民族精神之所寄托。即暴軍本莊司令亦不敢正眼相看卑辭推崇爲中華之惟一英雄。偉矣將軍。疾風勁草。操守嚴肅。廉頑立懦。振起頽風。其獲膺受全國輿論上之天爵。誠爲分所應然。</p>
<p>吾人對於馬將軍艱苦卓絶之行爲。應具有一正確之觀念。換言之。即應有一正確之認識。此正確之觀念爲何。即吾人不應以世俗之眼光。崇拜偶像之心理。認將軍爲英雄爲男兒爲民族之偉人。爲天縱之英傑。非常人所能望其項背。其所行者爲非常人所可追慕。蓋此一觀念。最足以淆混正確之輿論。蒙蔽國人正確之視聽也。</p>
<p>吾人兹就事實觀察。而予以平情之判斷。則馬將軍今日之守土抗暴。特亦負責之官吏。忠於職守之軍人所應有之行爲耳。擐甲執兵。身膺疆寄。守土衛民。負有專責。寇來而不禦。棄地而不守。置人民於暴軍蹂躙之下而不顧。是爲忝職。是爲不負責。是爲負國是爲負民。我國家固何貴乎有此怯弱之弱吏。我人民亦何貴乎有此木偶式之軍人。故將軍之守土抗暴實爲其分所應然。惟以舉國都持鎭靜與無抵抗。而將軍乃獨艱苦鏖戰。再破强敵。故如鶴立鷄羣。獨博得國人之推崇愛戴耳。吾人但當視爲一克盡職守之好官吏。視爲一負責之好軍人若視爲英雄。爲天縱之俊傑。爲非常人的可追慕。則偌大中國而僅有一馬占山英雄。應不僅爲將軍所不願聽。亦將軍所不忍聽。將軍六日通電有云。「婢織奴耕各專其責。」又云「衝鋒陷陣。責在軍人。」此即將軍之所以自言其志。亦即吾人衡量將軍之準繩也吾人但應接受將軍盡責之敎訓。人人忠於職守。忠其所事。以求不負國家。無忝國民一份子之義務。絶不應視將軍之所爲。爲崇高不可效法。此其一。</p>
<p>次之。自甲午一戰而後。國人對於日本即常存畏怯。九一八之望風退却。即畏怯心理之具體表現也。馬將軍以絶域孤軍。糧盡援絶。而與暴如虎狼之日軍相堅持。再接再厲。卒使敵人不敢正眼相看。十一月十八一役。在零度以下三十度之嚴寒中。與暴軍作。晝夜之苦戰。戰後日人宣稱「此次苦戰足以顯示「皇師之忠勇。」同時吾人蓋亦可覘知馬將軍威武不屈之精神。此種事實。無異敎訓吾人以師直爲壯曲爲老。但使人拚心。必足以敵虎狼之衆。暴日雖强。毫無足畏同時其更重要者。爲敎訓吾人以惟武力乃能答覆武力。惟奮鬥乃能求得生存齒還齒。目還目。乃能抗横暴。充其極。亦必能守而後有和之餘地。鎭靜即爲待死。退讓即爲苟安。此種敎訓。在目前吾人尤應切實體認。此其二。</p>
<p>復次。將軍不作虚言但以屹然不拔之事實艱苦卓絶之苦行與國人以眞誠之認識。言守士則堅據龍江。言抗暴則率孤軍作持久之鏖戰再克强敵目前日人利誘威脅。勾引其左右。煽惑其部下。極其陰毒奸險之手段。務使其移操易節。於此令人深致感喟於與惡勢力奮鬥之艱難據日前消息將軍且正積極作反攻之準備。彼之所行。即其所言。彼之所言。皆爲事實。而非不兌現之空頭支票。而此種信言。則正爲我國家我國人所共同要求吾人亟應接受將軍此種實踐奮鬥不尚虚聲之敎訓。以劍及履及之精神共赴國難此其三　　抑尤有進者。吾人但視國人今日一致對於馬將軍之熱烈崇拜即可以覘知國人今兹旣已覺醒。同時吾人更觀乎目前全國學生之請願示威尤可以覘知民情之慷激昂。此激昻之民氣。實爲我國家之生命亦即爲我民族精神之所寄託。吾人深盼我政府能善爲利用此種激昻之民氣。導之入於有效奮鬥之途。以求得我國家與民族之生路。萬勿潑以迎頭之冷水。或加以遏抑。吾人深盼政府對於目前學生請願運動之處置。謹愼三思。</p>

<h3 id="c72">對於小學生救國演說競爭的一點意見琴 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>本月五日上海市敎育界聯合抗日救國會所主持的小學學生演說競爭會、在南市務本女學開會、這一到天會的小學校計二十九校、學生演說時、旣個個精神飽滿說得痛快淋漓而得奬的前五名學生均屬女子、這也是很可注意的再就演說的意思而論、大概很好、歸納起來、不外乎左列幾種、</p>
<p>（一）抵制日貨、隨時隨地不與日本人合作、實行經淸絶交、</p>
<p>（二）鍛鍊身體、養成耐勞忍苦的精神、</p>
<p>（三）努力求學、欲求戰勝强敵先須知己知彼、在這科學昌明的時代、尤須研究科學、以振興國家、（四）救國儲金、節省糖果之資、聚成整數、以備救國之用、</p>
<p>上述的四種辦法、都很恰當、我們講到救國、是應當奉爲天經地義的、假使能夠本着這些意思、擴而充之、使全國到處依照實行、不但學校裏的師生一方從事研究救國方法、一方可以提起愛國精神努力救國工作、就是學生的家庭、無形中間、一定也可以受到小少的影響、</p>
<p>不過除了上述的幾種好處之外、我對於這次的演說、還有一點意見、就是演說詞的命意和擬稿、不妨由師生雙方合作、如對於演說的命意、敎師學生先事共同討論研究之後、須由學生自己擬稿、再由敎師修改、如此、則在工作方面、旣收通力合作之效、敎學方面、又可多予兒童以自動的機會、</p>
<p>但是這次兒童的演說詞、大部多屬成人口氣、就此一點看來、恐怕演說原稿多屬敎師代勞、果爾、則學生的演說、就免不了留聲機式的弊病了、我很希望學界愛國諸同志、對於這一層研究改良、更希望對於上述的四種辦法、努力實行、</p>

<p>上海靑年四百人，自動組織援馬抗日團，已於五日出發北上實行援助馬占山抵抗日軍。像這樣說得到做得到的靑年纔是眞正的中國人咧。我們躱在家裏過這温飽生活、不覺得慚愧嗎？」</p>
<p>「你我雖是這樣想，但他們要想達到目的，很是不容易啊！五號晚上京滬車站不給他們上車，他們便在鐵軌上睡了一夜，第二天步行出發。六日報載政府來電阻止他們前進。你可知道嗎？」</p>
<p>一眞有此事？政府爲什麽阻止他們前進？」</p>
<p>「據說是因爲他們没有受過嚴格的軍事訓練。政府不願以不敎民戰。」</p>
<p>「訓政是訓什麽？訓練總監幹的什麽事？有的是軍官，爲什麽不訓練他們？爲什麽不讓馬主席在戰塲上訓練他們？」</p>
<p>「黑龍江現在已是冰天雪地，穿皮袍好比是穿夏布褂。這次日本兵凍得耳朶，鼻子，手指掉下來的將近千人。我們南方人是不可輕去的。政府說他們没有禦寒的軍裝不便讓他們去作無謂的犧牲。」</p>
<p>「北方嚴寒，固如老兄所說。我也在冬天到過蒙古。你只要有厚羊皮做的帽子，手套，衣褲，靴也就可以對付。如果鼻子，耳朶，手指凍呆了，不要摸它，讓血脈慢慢的煖回來，就不妨事。口外有的是厚羊皮，怎麽這一點禦寒的軍裝也不能給他們？」</p>
<p>「據說，還有一件事困難。到黑龍江去若由水路，須經過俄國領土護照不易辦到，鐵路盡被日軍佔據，旱道要走一個多月纔能到。」</p>
<p>「如果我們的父母被强盗圍困，我們可以因路遠而見死不救嗎？莫說是要一個多月，就是一年半載也得趕去呀！」</p>
<p>「退一步說，萬一黑龍江不能去，錦州正在危急的時候，怎麽不可以讓憊他們到錦州去？一味消極的阻止，總非善策。」</p>
<p>「政府要以衆人的力量爲力量纔能禦大難做大事。國家在存亡關頭只怕人民醉生夢死。現在這四百靑年旣有决死之心，若能給他們以有效之訓練，必需之器械，自能發揮偉大之力量，將見他們與斯巴達之三百勇士，田横之五百義士先後媲美了。如果政府連這種寳貴之力量也不能容納發揮，那是太可歎息了。　　「這話很對！人民决死之力量是世界上最大之力量；能容納，善導，發揮，光大這種力量的政府，纔是高能的政府，萬能的政府。」</p>

<p>前中央國術館館長李景林將軍。於本月三日晚在稷門病殁。寒漠風凄。宿將不留。噩耗傳來。痛也何如。</p>
<p>李氏與張副司令及郭松齡輩。同處奉軍新系（亦稱大學系）之中堅份子。而丁超紀淸忠等屬之。當李氏以榆關一役有功。而任直隷督軍時。郭松齡因反對舊系中人專權。率部倒戈。斯時郭曾邀李參加。並謂報仇洩憤。時不宜失。但李卒能不受慫恿。其私德實非一般跋扈軍閥所可及。</p>
<p>李氏年來提倡國術。不遺餘力。而當每次舉行國術比賽時。如遇有因比賽而殞命或成殘廢之壯士。多加周卹。古道熱腸。不僅受惠者之感激涕零也。</p>
<p>李氏雖迭膺重任。但素懐廉潔。不事收刮。故身後亦殊蕭條。惟李氏有公子多人。皆賢敏好學。其長次公子。均留學海外習軍事專科。今長公子業已學成返國。次公子亦將畢業。箕裘克紹。蘭芽桂茁。當能繼其父業。以完成李氏未竟之志焉。</p>
<p>聞李氏今年僅四十有七。以其平日體質素壯。且又嫻於武術。方期壽域長駐。克享永年。乃竟因痢疾而遽謝人世。悲夫</p>

<h3 id="c152">看「滿蒙展覽會」後 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 孫壽</p>
<p>自十一月二十八日至來月十一日止。在白木屋（註一）五層樓舉行滿蒙大展覽會。後援者陸軍省。」丨最近報紙上的廣告。</p>
<p>接連下了三兩天雨。東京氣候已寒冷得多了。我老遠從鄉下跑進了城。在巍巍大厦的白木屋前下了車。</p>
<p>白木屋廣告窗前擠滿了人。我慢慢挨近去。伸長頸項望一望。第一個窗裏面有「幾個蠟人。一個穿着軍服。掛着交义皮帶。一個穿着紅色短衫褲。頭上拖着一條辮子」旁邊說明牌上寫着。「一·支那現行軍服。一·日淸戰爭時支那軍服」。第二個窗裏是「一片雪景。四週烽火彌漫。幾個日本捕在這寒氣下備戰」。這兩個廣告。不消說前者是暗示目前中國軍隊之無足畏。不然。何必定以淸朝軍服。而不以與日本無交涉的明朝軍服來陪襯現行軍服呢。後者呢。當然是象徵日本軍人的有爲了。我縮短視綫。定一定神。我趕忙俯着首。湧進了大門。那時候。我實在已再無勇氣。抬起頭來把兩個窗比評一下。</p>
<p>一進門有三件大殺人器。第一件是聽音機。形如磅秤。上面裝着四個大喇叭。據說可從喇叭中聽得十粁外的敵方飛機聲。同時明瞭該飛機之高度及地位。以便高射砲準備。第二件是一千珽的投下爆彈。長約八尺。徑約三尺。尾部有四翼。倘若這彈從飛機上投下時。可以入地十餘丈。而使被炸處瓦屑無存云云。第三件是四號型飛行機。機形甚小。只容一人。今日日本横行東北天空的即屬此類。</p>
<p>看完丁第一層。我一口氣就跑上第五層。</p>
<p>第五層是展覽會大會場。會場進口的地方。有許多諷剌畫。諷剌畫下面懸着許多照相。這裏面有北大營的混亂狀况。有中國兵的死骸照相。有瀋陽兵工廠的攝影等。可憐東北數十年菁華。只留得此殘影幾幀了。</p>
<p>展覽會第二部分是日本戰利品。這裏有東北兵工廠製的迫擊砲。有機關槍。有軍刀。還有六百十九團團旗。還有。最後還有青天白日旗。這些東西。我不忍細細的瞧。要看時。九段遊就館（註二）裏正還多着哩。</p>
<p>第三部分是日本戰死者的血帽。血衣等。看客們都個個在脫着帽表示敬意。</p>
<p>第四部分是中國反日宣傳品。觀衆們都在一張一張細瞧着。在這一瞬間。它們似乎已忘了東京滿巷滿街分着的「暴戾支那懲罰。兇賊蔣介石懲罰」。的滿蒙演講會傳單了。</p>
<p>第五部分是日本軍器說明。第六部分是東北鄉間的笨拙商店招牌及什用器具等。在這裏。也許是它們打算暴露「支那」的不文明罷。但日本自國鄉間又如何。</p>
<p>會場出口的地方。是「滿蒙書籍」發賣處。總計不下近百種。在這裏。我忽然回想起了中國的出版界。夫復何言。</p>
<p>我懊喪着踏出了白木屋。街頭勸募「滿洲將士慰問金」的呼聲。一陣陣從寒風中吹出。新聞號外的鈴音。在十字路口斷繼的震顫。「怎麽樣。我打算坐五號的船動身」。不意在電車停留塲的人叢中。有位朋友向我招呼。</p>
<p>「啊」。我怔了一怔。</p>
<p>「這光景。你還不走。」</p>
<p>「没有一定」。我苦笑着跨上電車。「那我先來送你的行罷」。</p>
<p>電車動了。「東京驛再見」。我在初冬的黄昏燈光下。向朋友摇摇手。</p>
<p>（註一）白木屋是東京四大百貨店之一。</p>
<p>（註二）遊就館在東京九段。内藏淸日戰爭時的中國敗殘軍器。</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第二章　志同道合</p>
<p>當這事變生以前。S城裏頭腦靈敏的人早已憂慮到那太陽國人急不暇擇。也許要有積極的軍事行動了。尤其是在這愛國大學裏的學生們。課餘之暇。三三兩兩的在那裏講。内中有一個學生姓華名乃强。身軀强健。頭腦淸醒。是一個有理智有勇武而充滿着愛國思想的靑年。本是南京人氏。年幼時隨着他的父母到關外來。因爲他的父親在中東路任事的。少好技擊。他父親特地請了一位武術家。敎他拳棒。舞得一手好劍。讀書也很聰頴。後來他的父母相繼逝世。他很慕愛國大學之名。遂考入該校肄業。師長和同學們見他英俊可喜。都很讚美。說他是個最有希望的學生。他讀到了國恥史。常常怒氣填膺。尤其是對於太陽國的侵略政策。極力反對的。他常對同學們說。將來我若握了我國的軍政。必不肯事事退讓。决意要和他們决一雌雄。文官不貪錢。武官不怕死。只要大家肯如此。何懼那些木屐兒呢。他還有一種絶技。便是槍法。可說百發百中。不但靶子打得準。有一天他隨着校長熊鳳。和幾個同學一齊到山中去射獵。控轡疾馳。凑巧有一羣飛雁過來。他位起手中槍。向天空砰砰砰。連放三槍。便有三雁應聲而墮。衆同學無不佩服。熊鳳也極口誇奬。校中有一次開個國技競賽會。華乃强得到第一名。熊鳳便把一柄犀利的寳劍贈送於他。說道。紅粉送與佳人。寳劍贈與烈士。我送你這劍。希望你將來也有揮我十萬横磨劍不殺倭奴誓不休的雄志便好了。華乃强接道答道。他日誓當以身許國。不負校長的期望。因此華乃强在校中可謂鐵中錚錚的一個好學生。而且他又會駕駛飛機。時常跟着熊鳳出去飛行。大家又代他起了一個别號。喚做飛將軍。至於女同學雖然不多。寥寥數十人。其中也有一個出類拔萃的女生。姓彭名忠淑。芳齡二九。婀娜剛健。兼而有之。和華乃强同級。也好馳馬擊劍。常常穿着軍裝。跨着駿馬出外。好似木蘭第二。伊的父親名梅國。在T城做鎭守使。擁兵自豪。頭腦頑固。不脫軍閥惡習。封建思想。所以彭梅國雖然十分寵愛他的女兒。但是忠淑讀書能明大義。最反對的是軍閥。對於伊的父親當然也不滿意。有時乘間諷諫數語。梅國不能醒悟。反說小女子焉知國家大事呢。</p>

<h3 id="c179">三民主義下的婦女 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 葉然綽先生在靑島婦女正誼會演講　　　　陳　韻　篁　女　士　筆　記</p>
<p>諸位、今天承貴會要我說幾句話、覺得非常愉快、非常榮幸、</p>
<p>不過事前没有準備、現在祇得拉雜約略說幾句、作爲頁獻、鄙人此次來靑島後、最感到快樂的、是貴會所做的社會事業、在靜穆的空氣中、能如此熱烈地努力、這是値得注意的、鄙人今天就以「三民主義下的婦女」做講題、和諸位研究研究　　我們爲什麽要講這個題目呢、大家都知道國民政府是由三民主義創立的、是受三民主義之統治的、</p>
<p>這兩句話、差不多在各種宣傳品上及壁上貼的標語等等、大家已聽爛看爛了、對於這些宣傳、這類標語、因爲太多見了、太平常了、不能引起剌激與注意、但仔細研究起來、很有價値、與國家前途、有深切的關係、那麽三民主義下之婦女、應該怎樣活動呢、這就値得我們研侒了　　據最近郵局調查、中國人口、將近五萬萬、則婦女居二萬五千萬、諸位要曉得近代國家之强盛、完全靠全體國民之是否能夠團結、並不是靠一二英雄豪傑之才能、從前靠幾個領袖統率軍隊可以戰勝敵人、現在民衆思想進步、國家責任、負在一般民衆的身上了、我們常常聽到「全國總動員」的口號、意思就是說每個國民應該負着責任、拿一件最小的事實來說、如歐戰時候、各參戰國人民、節省自己的麵包、運送到前方去充兵士的糧食、這就是全國動員的意義、</p>
<p>我國是工業落後的國家、各種實業、遠不及人、致全國人民、受種種壓迫、如要國家存在、非全國動員、無能爲力、從前我們講愛國、其實祇是口裏說說而已、從來没有眞眞感到切膚之痛的、近十年來、各種潮流、澎湃激盪、世界列强、亦多受經濟壓迫之影響、何况實業不振、政治不上軌道的中國、旣受國外種種之壓迫、而國内戰爭、又不斷的發生、處此境地、</p>
<p>加歷年天災、相繼不斷、諸位剛纔所說的水災、這不過是其中的一件耳、人們說、中國地大物博、其實中國地大而物不博、試舉我們日常的東西說、我國本是農業立國、人民的衣食、本來應該很充裕、但是現在所用絲棉、大由是舶來品、米也有從日本安南暹羅輸來的、麵粉有從坎拿大輸來的、就是在住的房子、走的馬路、其原料亦不能不仰給於外人、總而言之、可以說、衣是别人賞給我們穿的、飯是别人賞給我們吃的、房屋是别人賞給我們住的馬路是别人賞給我們走的、再換一句話說、我們要靠着别人而才有衣穿、才有飯吃、才有屋住、才有路走、衣食住行、爲人們日常生活之四大要素、如仰給於别人、不惟所受損失太大、而且危險非常、</p>
<p>最近據辦災的人報告、此次我國水災、至少死了二三十萬人、十餘年來、各處因天災人禍、總共約死一百萬人、而國人不悟、内戰無已、中國已至大難臨頭的時候了、所以我說要中國存在、必要大家共同去努力、男子應該努力、女子亦應該盡國民的責任、對於意外的事情、更應特别努力、就如上而所說的歐戰時候、各參戰國的人們、節省麵包、供給兵士、是民衆救國的方法、民衆的力量、大而且厚、其效率勝過英雄豪傑偶然成功之大事業、如民衆知識淺陋、又不能團結、雖有一二英雄豪傑、爲國家奮鬥、亦無爲能力、若全國民衆、各能盡其相當責任、則其國必强、故我輩不要存心「非大事不做」不要非位高、不負人們對於國家的責任、我中國人們、個個男子、個個女子、應快快</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>覺悟、自動團結、共同努力、</p>
<p>現在試約略談談三民主義、我們先從民族主義講起、中國民族、是否健全、其團結力、是否堅厚、我們攷其所以不健全不堅厚的原因、到底在那裏、自革命成功、五族共和、意思五族應該平等、但五族的知識、是否平等、五萬萬民衆的知識和能力、是否健全、現在要改良民族、很難下手、而最要緊的部分、最二萬萬五千萬女子知識與能力的提高、女子佔中國全民族之半數、這半數的女子、能對國家負相當的責任、其力量一定甚大、女子最大的困難、是生理上的吃虧、欲求全民族的健全、根本上須半數女子的體力健全、方能辦到、故晚近的優生學等、並不是一種空氣、是很値得研究的、</p>
<p>其次我們談談民權主義、總理分權與能爲二件事、但二者須連接在一起、有權者必須有「能」無能者、不應有權、現在一般人、祗知爭權、而不講能、能力没有培養好、拿了權、不但不見得能用、並且足以貽害國家、　希望女子明瞭目前中國的情形及自己的地位、應該努力求「能」、將來憲政時期、當然可以達到參政目的而掌政權、</p>
<p>最後我們談談民生主義、中國已到了民窮財盡的時候、在這時候、要想脫離各國經濟的壓迫、是做不到的、一般有錢的人們、大尚奢侈、專用貴族的西洋貨、貧窮者、亦愛好看、競購便宜的東洋貨國民生計、被外人剝奪殆盡、所以中國要想脫離次殖民地之地位、可以說是很難、這還是中國根本没有辦法呢、不是民衆不覺悟不去努力的緣故呢、我想我們中國並不是根本没有辦法的國家、凡是日常生活必需的東西、一方面盡量的採用國貨、一方面盡力的改良和增加生產能力、現在我國人們、競尚好看、不管實用、不僅都市上的有錢人如此、即鄉村鄙陋地方的農民、亦有這種心理、因此而唾棄國貨競用洋貨、致國家利益、都被外人奪去而不顧、如果我五萬萬同胞、打定主意、普通日常生活必需的東西。非國貨不用、到了供不應求的時候、國人一定會奮起設法增加生產分量、至於敎育方面、科學方面、實業方面、軍事方面、需用的儀器和機械等、暫時雖免購用外貨、這要靠政府培植專門的人才、十年之後、可以成功、我中華民國、有發展之材料、有發展之土地、就是因爲全國人們無發展之决心、致國家生計、日見窮促、可勝浩歎、我記得歐戰時候、日本糧食不足、希望美國每年借給他三十五萬噸的米、美國和日本的感情、素來不好、故不肯答應、後來日本再三要求、美國才許他以三十五萬噸的船交换、日本當局、爲顧全民食起見、祗得犧牲、但受了這個剌激以後、極力奮鬥、現在日本的米、有運輸到我國來的了、號稱以農立國的中華民族、吃的穿的、仰給於外人者甚多、不僅可恥、現在已到了可怕的時期了、關於穿的方面、你們女子、更應注意、</p>
<p>近幾年來、婦女服裝的材料、幾乎全身無一而非舶來品、我國本來有很好的綢緞綾羅絹紗、惟因花樣稍差、一般婦女、就不願意服用、以致什麽喬其紗印度綢、大迎合婦女之心理、雖質薄價貴、而亦不顧、此外如脚上之皮鞋絲襪、身上之襯衫襯褲、手上之手錶戒子、頭上之香水脂粉、亦無一而非舶來品、且無一而非價値昂貴之物、一手提皮篋、有價値幾十元者、自金價暴漲以來、我中國人們、不知吃了多少的虧、試看日本幾年來發展的情形、尤其是對於我國方面的侵略、甚是驚人、日本爲一島國、面積極小、自己國内、不夠發展、於是不得不向外侵略、但是向外侵略、是有困難的、若被侵略者、作强有力的抵抗、則日本的發展、一定大受阻礙、在這樣的困難底下、而日本的發展、已震動全世界了、俗語說、「事在人爲」我中國人們、應該是醒悟的時候了、上面已經說過、中國地大而物不博、但是有了這塊大地、就容易發展、發展之道、不必向外侵略、祇要在自己家裏努力奮鬥、就可以與世界最富的美國相競爭、不但國民生計、從此毫無問題、並且可以供給别國人民的需要、現在世界各國、都有特長的發展、而中國不但無一事之發展、且事事仰給於人、以致危機回伏、我以爲不是中國根本没有辦法、是中國少數做領袖的人不爭氣、使多數民衆、也跟着不爭氣、結果大家怨天尤人、互相指謫、到了這種地步、萬不該如此無聊、大家應振起精神、好好努力、而徒在互相怨尤、是没有用的、我半數之女同胞、不要放棄責任、譬如我們種了一顆樹、永遠不見長大、而料一日一日的枯萎下去、我們應該研究原因、究竟不是地上不好呢、還是有人去糟塌它呢、我可以說、中國的土地、在世界上、算是很饒渥、很適合種植的、所以並不是土地不好、這的確是人們自己在糟塌它、一人這樣糟塌、大家亦就没有保護的責任心、甚至於也隨便糟塌了、假如大家肯下决心去保護它、定可以長得很茂盛、我半數女同胞、應負共同保護、共同培養的責任、但我們要明白中國社會的現象、仔細研究各種培養的方法、不要狂呌瞎喊、亂闖莽撞、看淸對象、一步一步的進行、如現在籌欵賑災一事、大家覺得奔走得精疲力盡、其實祗就漢口鴉片稅一項、每年可抽一萬萬六千萬元、雪茄每年三萬萬元、這是單就本國出產而言、其餘舶來品、不知還有多少、假如吸烟同胞、大家少吸一口烟、豈不是足以救全國的災民嗎、再進一步說、這次水災發生以前明明曉得長江流域、堤防不固、但就没有人肯做防範的工作、故這次水災、並不是偶然的天災、今年不來、明年後年、也也來的、所以我說中國並不是根本没有辦法、是大家自暴自棄、因爲大家在每件事前、不加注意、以致國家受害、</p>
<p>中國人民、尚没有消除家族關係、家庭中之共同生活、還不能廢除、如女子受過相當敎育、從事職業、至少可以减少男子一部分的負担、婦女有了職業、家庭中就可以多生產少消費、如全國婦女、每人减少消耗一元、則全國就可以减少消耗二萬萬五千萬元、再進一步說、如全國婦女、每人生產一元、則國家之生產量、亦增加二萬萬五千萬元、所以婦女對國家生產、有如此重大的關係、故婦女敎育、亦該特别注意、我常常聽到打倒賢妻良母的敎育、這也是不對的、賢妻良母、並不是侮辱女子的敎育、女子的受敎育、當然不限於賢妻良母、換一方面說、男子亦不限於做賢夫良父、不過依着各人的天性、互相合作、以有益國家爲目標、比如工廠、分機器間與寫字間、不能說機器間是工廠、寫字間不是工廠、亦不能說寫字間重要、機器間不重要、要合作纔行、</p>
<p>現在中國國勢、危如纍卵、女子應該與男子合作、男子不應輕視女子、女子更不應自暴自棄、至於合作方法、當然不能在這裏詳講、但切不要先存野心、一出來、非大事不做、以顯本領、而沽虚譽、要知道雖是一件極小的事情、祗要有益、就得動手、事情雖小、合全國人們的數量、力量也就不小了、全國男女、個個明白此理、對内可以發展、對外可以抵抗了、</p>

<h3 id="c180">日本對華侵略之過去及將來森千 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>滕田主計原著</p>
<p>光華書局出版</p>
<p>東省事件、自發生以來、瞬將三月、即是對於國際政治毫無常識的人、亦明白這事件完全是日本有計劃、步驟和準備的動作、决不會再疑心單是「日本少數軍人的盲動」了、</p>
<p>日本此次公然做這樣大胆的事件、有的說是秉承着田中義一的主意、有的說是遵盤山田武吉的政策、其實、日本首先發起計劃和領導侵略中國的人、却是有名的前財政大臣滕田主計、至以後田中等的計劃、全係師其故智而已、</p>
<p>在此極高度的抗日聲中、我謹將滕田所著之「日本對華侵略之過去及將來」一書、介紹於國人之前、</p>
<p>本書的内容是如此</p>
<p>第一章緒言内評論侵略中國之必要、彼云「以如此隣邦今乃積弱不振、實大和民族發展之絶好機機、研究而對付之以期雄飛大陸、一新亞細亞人種面月、誠要圖也」祇從此數句内玩其意、日本併吞中國之野心、已昭然如見、内又謂「中國鐵礦石灰之豐富、石油之有望、棉花之栽培、羊之飼養、及其他物質、舉凡我國民經濟所必要者……皆能求之於中國、有如此關係、故掌握中國經濟之支配權、從帝國獨立上觀之、亦最爲緊急、予之視中國問題爲最重要者、即在此點也、更進而觀中國政治、從列國勢力關係唱瓜分論者有之、……然今日帝國朝野一致之議論、皆謂中國决不可瓜分、蓋非爲中國利益不可瓜分、實爲帝國利益不可使其瓜分也……不如使中國虚擁主權、帝國坐收實利之爲愈也」此數句話、在今日已實現其遺策、如國聯議在錦州設中區、而日本公然反對、因彼之視中國、完全係認爲「天賜給大和民族的」極不願有第三者來置喙也、故事件發生後、即絶對主張直接談判、并没有提出瓜分的口氣、這全是秉着滕田的遺旨而辦理的、所以溯這次的起事後、日本處處用恐嚇手段、務使我完全屈服於他、彼之惡毒政策、在使中國徒擁虚名、日本坐收實利、換言之即使日本操縱中國之經濟權、而不居滅亡中國之罪名、故滕田此書、不啻爲日本侵略中國的惡毒政策之供狀、</p>
<p>第二章中日親善及諸般施設、此章内即講日本須佯爲同中國親善、而暗地設法逐步吞食中國、其心大而計亦狡矣、内云「帝國希望在華發展、故希望與中國親善」眞是其内心的供狀、又云「然從來對華發展、圖利太急、譬當對華投資、所望彼者太烈、吾所得者甚多、往往反致糾紛、……徒招華人之疑惑而已、予特力避去此等弊竇而行「欲取先與」之格言、以期收大利於將來」觀此知彼之毒計、係先予我以少利、然後施其經濟侵略、吸我膏血、欲使中國成爲血虧孱弱之體、永遠供彼魚肉、</p>
<p>然設計侵略我國、當然先有準備及設施滕田亦深感此要、故曰「予等所擬之對於中國之設施甚多、尚未着手實行者亦居多數、」於此可見滕田實是主謀侵略中國的第一人、因爲許多施設亦都是他擬定的、當時彼擬定對華發展施設中之重要者、有「對華金融上之整備改良」「對華借欵」「駐華政務官之設置」「中國財政顧問問題」「中國關稅問題」……等、而對於滿蒙之計劃尤不遺餘力、</p>
<p>第三章對於中國金融上之整備改良、查滕田爲日本前財政要人、自日俄戰後、所有日本對華之經濟侵略、無不有彼參與其間、因彼對於經濟上較多經騐、尤其對於中國之財政狀况固一目瞭然也、本章内分數小節、如對於滿蒙金融及放資機關之整備改良、對於中國本土之金融機關之整備改良、并詳將日本侵略中國之金融機關如正金銀行、朝鮮銀行、台灣銀行、日本與業銀行、中華匯業銀行等之任務、分析得異常淸晰、某銀行應活動於世界、某銀行應專主活動於中國、某銀行應增加準備金、設支店於上海、某銀行應操縱滿洲之金融、無一不指示淸楚、故滕田之於日本、實是一個大計劃家、而於我國則是一個大勁敵也、至述及日本侵略中國之投資機關、彼之陰謀尤爲顯露、彼言「對華投資、極貴秘密敏速是也、若事未成以前、洩露於外、即於日本大有利益、亦有不能成立之虞、是則予所屢次經騐者也、故於此等特别銀行鞏固團體之下、敏速秘密而進行之、最爲必要、」是以東洋拓殖公司、東亞興業公司、中日實業公司等、咸相繼起立、羣起而對我國投資、以遂其侵略之野心、彼投資於中國、大半徧於鐵道、因彼非特得以從中取利、且可假交通之使利、而侵略中國之内部、自此以後、日貨遂如水銀抛地、充斥於市上、日人之殖民於中國、更如過江之鯽、洶湧而來、</p>
<p>第四章對華借欵之概要、内言「爲保將來日本之國民經濟上或國防上之獨立起見、不能不占據中國、……欲使泱泱大國、以存立於東亞、不能不獨努力於開發中國……對於中國經濟上之投資、固日本之天職、而此事對於中國對於世界皆極合正義、」言之荒謬、可謂極點、所謂對華借欵者、就是以八分的利息、借錢給中國人、創辦鐵道及電信等事、日本自以欵借給中國後、一方面握得了中國的經濟權、一方面對於各種交通及電信方面、均因借欵條件而得優先權、作侵略的重要骨子、他說「中國之改良電信、……對於我國及其他國之商業貿易、亦多便利、且中華匯業銀行、亦能發其效果之端緒、」所以觀此知他的陰謀、没有一件不是一舉數得的、眞是全世界亘古未有的大陰謀家、</p>
<p>最使滕田所忘不掉的、厥爲借欵給中國以建築鐵路、因爲鐵道造好、能給日本侵略的發展上以最大的利益的、看他說、「此鐵道告成、帝國聯絡朝鮮滿蒙及中國北數省、乃能十分如意……火速敷設此等鐵道、又爲日本大陸發展前途所最關切者矣、」我們該作何感想、</p>
<p>第五六七八九數章、則關於侵略的枝節方面的、有的已成過去、有的尚未實現、兹不贅、</p>
<p>在第十章結論中說、「日本經濟優勝權問題、予僅開其端、至所設施之事件使其有效實現、有或需數年者、有或需數十年者、所望朝野上下、同心一力、務須不毁此基礎、努力於此基礎之上、益加鞏固之建設」無怪乎遂有田中的「日本侵略滿蒙之積極政策」的出現、觀此、知九月十八之事件、亦意中事也、</p>
<p>聞本書在日本係秘密發行、分配於彼國政財兩界要人、經譯者辛苦搜求始得、願讀者括目一讀之、</p>

<p>Recognizing Japanese Military's Right to Protect Nationals</p>
<p>To Cease Upon Complete Withdrawal of Japanese Troops</p>
<p>But the Words "剿匪權" (Bandit Suppression Rights) Have Been Deleted</p>
<p>Japan Requests Amendment to Paragraph Five</p>
<p>Public Meeting Scheduled to Continue Today</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council held a public meeting at 5:05 PM today. Chairman Briand read the draft resolution, followed by a detailed explanation of each article, known as the Chairman's Declaration. During his explanation, Briand did not mention bandit suppression rights. Subsequently, the Council decided to continue the public meeting on Thursday afternoon. (Received National Telegram, 2:00 AM, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The resolution proposed within the League of Nations Council's public meeting contains six articles: First, reaffirming the resolution of September 30th of this month; Second, stipulating that both governments take all necessary measures to prevent the situation from further escalating; Third, both parties should report developments to the Council at any time; Fourth, neutral observers from each member state should continue to report developments to the Council at any time; Fifth, dispatching a five-member investigation committee to Manchuria to report to the Council on all circumstances that may affect international relations and endanger Sino-Japanese peace. The committee will not inquire into direct Sino-Japanese negotiations or military actions; Sixth, the next Council meeting is scheduled to convene on January 25th. In the interim, the Chairman is requested to pay attention to the Liaoning issue, and if necessary, convene a special meeting on short notice. As for the Chairman's Declaration, each article of the resolution was explained in detail. Regarding the first article, it stated that the Council recognizes the September 30th resolution as having the utmost importance. The second article stated that the Japanese government considers it has the right to protect Japanese nationals not only near the South Manchurian Railway, but also in the vicinity of where Japanese nationals currently reside. However, this protection right will naturally cease once Japanese troops withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway Zone. The fourth article explained that neutral observers will be in contact with both parties. The fifth article explained that the investigation team's authority has no geographical limitations, but it will not engage in military actions or direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today was not the last day of the Executive Yuan's meeting. In reality, it was contrary to everyone's unanimous hope. This morning, a telegram arrived from Tokyo stating that Japan requested a postponement of the public meeting. When the Japanese delegation was asked about this matter, it was said that it was still uncertain whether the final instructions could be received before the afternoon meeting. However, a telegram sent from Tokyo at 4:00 AM had already been received. According to the telegram, the request for instructions was being translated. The Japanese delegation had already notified the Executive Yuan of this fact, and the decision on whether to hold the public meeting in the afternoon would be made by the Executive Yuan. The League of Nations Secretariat declared that it had not yet received a formal request from Japan regarding the postponement of the meeting, or that it might be submitted in the afternoon. But, in any case, the public meeting would definitely be held, and the resolution and declaration would be read. If Japan makes a request, the vote will be postponed until tomorrow. By 12:00 PM, the committee had already revised the text, and there were no significant difficulties. The long-awaited agreement could thus be declared to the public. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The representatives of the twelve Council member states reconvened a secret meeting at 11:30 AM this morning to study the declaration that the Chairman will make at the public meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. Before the secret meeting, the drafting committee convened at 11:15 AM to deliberate on the wording of the resolution and the Chairman's declaration. Although the public meeting is scheduled to be held at 5:00 PM (some say 4:00 PM) this afternoon, according to news from the Japanese delegation, Yoshizawa will request a recess at the meeting until Thursday to clarify differing opinions regarding the fifth section of the resolution. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the Council can hold a public meeting before Thursday to vote on the proposed resolution. According to reliable sources, China's Chief Representative Shi will declare at the public meeting, requesting that Japanese troops withdraw completely as soon as possible, and will reserve the right to invoke Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, or reserve the right to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact or the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. If the Chairman's declaration contains a reservation of the Japanese military's right to bandit suppression, Chief Representative Shi will, in the name of the Chinese government, declare that Japan's exercise of police power within Chinese territory is not recognized by international law, as a reservation. Also, the League of Nations Secretariat today indicated to journalists that the Tokyo government has apparently misunderstood. The last sentence of the original draft resolution, namely the actions of the investigation team when it arrives in Liaoning and Japan has not yet withdrawn its troops, has now been moved to the Chairman's declaration in a more moderate form. This declaration has no legal binding force, so Japan has no need to accept it, and the Japanese representative can also make a corresponding statement. Therefore, there is no reason why Japan cannot accept the resolution today. (National News Agency Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At the secret meeting of the twelve Council members this afternoon, it was tentatively decided to convene a public meeting at 4:00 PM this afternoon. If the public meeting can be held on time and the resolution is passed, the third special meeting of the Council will be adjourned immediately. However, whether the public meeting can be held depends entirely on the final instructions from the Chinese and Japanese governments. The Chinese and Japanese representatives received instructions from their respective governments this morning and are still translating the telegrams. If these instructions do not satisfy the Council, the public meeting will be postponed until Friday. However, people within the League of Nations indicate that the Council has practically yielded to Japan on all the disputed points, and China seems eager to have an agreement to stop the Japanese advance. It is expected that both countries will accept the resolution. The proposal for a neutral zone has now been definitively abandoned. The Council only needs both parties to guarantee the maintenance of the status quo so as to preserve the existing informal neutral zone, considering it to be sufficient. Therefore, the only remaining issue is the investigation team. Regarding the number of investigation committee members, it is now heard that there will be five people. This morning, the Spanish representative proposed six or seven people, which was rejected by the secret meeting. (National News Agency Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Reuters has learned from reliable sources that Japan is prepared to accept the League of Nations resolution, as long as the fifth paragraph of the resolution is deleted, concerning the scope of authority of the investigation team. The Japanese consider this section to limit the timing of Japan's troop withdrawal, and therefore it is not acceptable to Tokyo. The inclusion of the reservation of Japan's bandit suppression rights in the Chairman's declaration can also be accepted by Japan, but the wording needs to be slightly modified. It is heard that the Japanese government has now instructed Yoshizawa to slightly delay the holding of the final meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the League of Nations Council decided to hold a public meeting on Wednesday afternoon at 5:00 PM. If the proposed resolution cannot be unanimously agreed upon by then, a public meeting will be convened again on Thursday. U.S. Ambassador Dawes has used a wireless telephone to report the content of the resolution to the U.S. government to seek its opinion, and then relayed it to Briand. Subsequently, the twelve Council member states held a secret meeting, and the original text of the resolution drafted by the drafting committee was telegraphed to their respective governments for instructions. The secret meeting of the twelve Council members was held at 5:10 PM. It is heard that the U.S. government had already instructed Dawes to convey the U.S. government's approval of the resolution to Briand. The secret meeting adjourned at 6:45 PM after one hour and thirty minutes of discussion. However, just as the League of Nations Council was not far from what it considered to be a solution to the Liaoning issue, there was a sudden unofficial report of Japanese troops occupying Yingkou, which immediately cast a shadow over the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the League of Nations Administrative Council holds a public meeting, it will hold a closed meeting to discuss the expenses of this meeting in Paris. Today, it is heard that the French government is willing to bear the large sum of money, because the meeting was originally planned to be held in Geneva, but it was changed to Paris for Briand's convenience. Today, the Japanese delegation here issued a communiqué, citing a telegram describing the troop strength and deployment of Zhang Xueliang's army in the Jinzhou area on December 4th.

<p>Wanton Trampling of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>World Peace is Just a Dream</p>
<p>Cleveland, USA - The atrocities of the Japanese in Manchuria continue unabated, and American people are very displeased. Mr. Baker, former Secretary of War during President Wilson's era, delivered a speech here today, vehemently condemning the militaristic policies adopted by Japan. Moreover, Mr. Baker is a candidate of the Democratic Party in the presidential election next June, and his speech was published in the Cleveland newspaper of the Scripps-Howard chain, so Mr. Baker's speech is indeed worthy of attention. Mr. Baker said, "All civilized nations should be angry at the atrocities committed by Japan in Manchuria, and the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty should especially rise up and protest. If the Nine-Power Treaty can be wantonly trampled on by any country, isn't world peace a dream, and will mankind not only degenerate into barbarism, but also hypocritical barbarism? The position that Japan stands in is extremely serious, because Japan has affixed its name to the Nine-Power Treaty and guaranteed the administrative and territorial integrity of China. Therefore, Japan's current actions should be stopped by itself in terms of dignified morality." Baker added that Japan often hides behind double diplomacy, saying that the civilian government in Tokyo cannot control its warlords. If this statement is true, Japan should ask its civilian and military governments to jointly sign international treaties in the future. But what if other countries follow suit? Wouldn't it mean that the treaties signed by the State Council have nothing to do with the military? Mr. Baker's remarks have now been disclosed by newspapers across the United States, and many foreign countries have also translated and published them. He has been confirmed as the Democratic Party's future presidential candidate, so the influence of his views on the public is also very great. (National News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e21">How to Understand General Ma's Teachings <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Today, the people of our entire country, regardless of age, wisdom, or foolishness, unanimously admire and respect General Ma Zhanshan. Across vast distances, we look to this strong man, clad in armor and riding his horse through the frozen wilderness, bravely resisting the tyrannical army, and see him as the embodiment of our national spirit. Even the tyrannical army's commander, Honjo, does not dare look him in the eye and praises him humbly as the only hero of China. Great is the General! Like strong grass in a gale, his integrity is unyielding, he inspires courage in the cowardly, and revives declining morale. It is only fitting that he should receive this heavenly honor from the national public opinion.</p>
<p>We should have a correct understanding of General Ma's arduous and extraordinary actions. In other words, we should have a correct perception. What is this correct perception? It is that we should not use the eyes of the secular world or the mentality of idol worship to regard the General as a hero, a true man, a great man of the nation, or a divinely gifted talent beyond the reach of ordinary people, whose actions are too lofty for ordinary people to emulate. This kind of perception is most likely to confuse correct public opinion and obscure the correct vision and hearing of the people.</p>
<p>Now, let us observe the facts and make a fair judgment. General Ma's defense of the territory and resistance to tyranny today are simply the actions that a responsible official and a soldier loyal to his duty should take. Clad in armor, wielding weapons, and entrusted with the defense of the frontier, he has a specific responsibility to defend the territory and protect the people. To fail to resist the invaders, to abandon the territory, and to leave the people under the trampling of the tyrannical army without concern is to be unworthy of one's position, to be irresponsible, to betray the country, and to betray the people. What value does our country have in such a cowardly and weak official? What value do our people have in such a wooden and puppet-like soldier? Therefore, General Ma's defense of the territory and resistance to tyranny is indeed what he should do. However, because the whole country is holding to calmness and non-resistance, General Ma alone is fighting arduously and repeatedly defeating the strong enemy. Therefore, like a crane standing among chickens, he alone has won the admiration and love of the people. We should only regard him as a good official who fulfills his duty and a responsible soldier. To regard him as a hero, a divinely gifted talent, or someone whose actions are too lofty for ordinary people to emulate, then China, with its vast territory, would have only one Ma Zhanshan as a hero. This is not only what the General would not want to hear, but also what the General would not bear to hear. In his six-day telegram, the General said, "Maids weave and servants plow, each specializing in their responsibilities," and "To charge into battle is the duty of soldiers." This is the General's self-expression of his ambition, and it is also the standard by which we measure the General. We should only accept the General's teaching of fulfilling one's duty, with everyone being loyal to their duties and loyal to what they do, so as to not let down the country and not be unworthy of the obligation of being a member of the nation. We should never regard the General's actions as lofty and inimitable. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Secondly, since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the people of our country have often harbored fear of Japan. The retreat at the sight of the enemy on September 18th is a concrete manifestation of this fear. General Ma, with his isolated army in a remote area, with exhausted supplies and no reinforcements, persisted in resisting the Japanese army, as fierce as tigers and wolves, again and again. He finally made the enemy not dare to look him in the eye. In the battle of November 18th, in the severe cold of thirty degrees below zero, he fought a bitter battle day and night with the tyrannical army. After the battle, the Japanese declared, "This bitter battle is enough to show the loyalty and bravery of the Imperial Army." At the same time, we can also see General Ma's spirit of unyielding might. This kind of fact is no different from teaching us that an army led by justice will be strong, while an army led by wickedness will be old. As long as people are determined, they will surely be able to resist the masses of tigers and wolves. Although the tyrannical Japan is strong, it is not to be feared at all. At the same time, what is more important is to teach us that only force can answer force and only struggle can obtain survival. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, is the only way to resist tyranny. To the extreme, it will surely be possible to have room for peace after defending. Remaining calm is waiting for death, and concession is seeking temporary ease. We should especially recognize this kind of teaching at present. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the General does not make empty words, but uses the unwavering fact of his arduous and extraordinary actions to give the people a sincere understanding. When he says he will defend the territory, he firmly defends Longjiang. When he says he will resist tyranny, he leads an isolated army in a protracted and fierce battle, repeatedly defeating the strong enemy. At present, the Japanese are using enticements and threats, colluding with his subordinates, and inciting his troops, using extremely insidious and treacherous means to make him change his integrity. This makes people deeply sigh at the difficulty of fighting against evil forces. According to recent news, the General is also actively preparing for a counterattack. What he does is what he says. What he says are all facts, not empty promises that cannot be fulfilled. This kind of trustworthy word is exactly what our country and our people jointly demand. We should urgently accept the General's teaching of practicing, fighting, and not advocating empty words, and go to the national crisis with the spirit of acting swiftly. This is the third point. Moreover, we can see from the national people's unanimous and enthusiastic admiration for General Ma today that the people of our country have now awakened. At the same time, we can see the generosity of the people's sentiment from the petitions and demonstrations of students across the country. This generous popular sentiment is the life of our country and the embodiment of our national spirit. We deeply hope that our government can make good use of this generous popular sentiment and guide it into the path of effective struggle in order to obtain a way out for our country and our nation. Do not pour cold water on it or suppress it. We deeply hope that the government will carefully consider the handling of the current student petition movement.</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e55">Hoover Reports on Domestic and Foreign Affairs to Congress <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Opposes Overall Revision of Import Tariff Rates</p>
<p>Advocates Organizing a Financial Rehabilitation Corporation</p>
<p>Seeks to Maintain the Spirit of International Conventions</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (National Telegram) – U.S. President Hoover today reported to Congress on the government affairs of the past year, describing the current state of the nation. He acknowledged the seriousness of the Sino-Japanese Liaoning Incident and mentioned the outline of an emergency rehabilitation corporation plan to cope with the economic recession. However, he made no mention of the prohibition issue. He also stated that the government would need to increase taxes for at least the next two years, but he opposed any attempt at a comprehensive revision of tariffs. He also proposed reorganizing the railways, implementing disarmament, and explained the reasons for suspending reparations and war debts for one year. In the report, when discussing diplomacy, he said that most of the difficulties of the past year were due to unrest abroad. If the United States wants to save the economic recession, it must cooperate with other countries and re-establish the world in a stable domain. He will report in detail at a later date. He also said that the U.S. government is deeply concerned about the dispute between China and Japan over the Liaoning Incident. It not only seeks to maintain the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but also to maintain the various treaties signed by our country guaranteeing China's territorial integrity. The purpose of the United States is to assist in finding a solution to the Liaoning Incident that can fully maintain the spirit of previous treaties. In the report, regarding the economic aspect, it was explained that the economic recession was due to the result of the world's instability, and then revolutions, dumping, reduced sales, and budget deficits followed. Within two years, revolutions or major social disturbances occurred in nineteen countries, affecting no less than half of the world's people. Currently, fourteen countries, including a quarter of the world's population, have temporarily abandoned their monetary standards. There are also several countries where serious financial turmoil has occurred, or banks have been forced to restrict payments. Every disturbance has a sharp impact on the United States, causing overseas markets and agricultural product prices to be greatly affected. Then, he summarized the outline of his emergency rehabilitation corporation plan, which is roughly similar to the financial and fiscal corporation during the European War. He said that the company will provide assistance to agricultural exports and commerce, railways, and financial institutions for a period of two years, and the government will allocate a considerable amount of money to be its capital. However, he did not mention the amount to be allocated, but said that we must add some steel pillars to the foundation of the credit building today, and the government's assumption of the company's capital is to assure the people that the government can meet public needs. He also said that although the company cannot be used on a large scale as a tool to help all industries, he firmly believes that it will be a cornerstone of confidence. He believes that if the United States can use its financial resources without being dampened, it can seek the revival of the railways and restore the prosperity of all industries. If the United States has a strong economy, it will be of great help to the stability of the world. President Hoover also announced the reason for opposing a comprehensive revision of tariffs, saying that it would disrupt industry, commerce, and agriculture and prolong the economic recession. As for the tax increase plan, it will be detailed in the budget plan. Hoover also opposed government subsidies for the unemployed and opposed the abolition of the federal anti-trust laws, but proposed reorganizing the railways to reduce transportation costs, using land banks and amending banking laws to expand agricultural assistance, and expanding bank</p>
<p>The regulations for rediscounting should not reduce their guarantees. He also explained that reparations and war debts had to be suspended for one year due to the overall bankruptcy in Central Europe, and will be explained in detail later. He also said that he believes that all public construction, except for the army and navy, should be concentrated under the administration of public works and managed by federal administrators.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (National Telegram) – After the U.S. President released the annual report on government affairs to Congress, Republican Senator Walcott immediately proposed that the capital of the Emergency Rehabilitation Corporation should be set at 500 million U.S. dollars, which should be allocated by the federal government.</p>

<p>Telegrams Ma Zhanshan to Solicit the Seal of Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>Remains Unrepentant After Being Severely Reprimanded by Xie Ke</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: Zhao Zhongren, the former member of Heilongjiang Provincial Committee who advocated surrendering to Japan the most vigorously, again made a long-distance telephone call from Harbin to Hailun last night (28th). Chairman Ma Zhanshan did not answer the call himself. Chief of Staff Xie Ke of the Military Department answered the call on behalf of him. According to Zhao Zhongren's conversation with Xie, "The overall situation in Jiang Province has been decided (?). Ying Jihua has now led a part of the Harbin Garrison to Jiang Province to maintain law and order. He has now arrived at Ang'angxi Station and is scheduled to enter the province tomorrow (29th) to take over the defense. Because Lieutenant General Domon, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, has led the Japanese army that attacked Jiang Province to Jinzhou a few days ago, there are only more than 100 Japanese soldiers in Jiang Province, and the police are urgently needed to maintain order. Therefore, the Harbin authorities have specially dispatched Ying to leave immediately. Regarding Chief Zhang Xuwu's maintenance of law and order in Jiang Province this time, he has discussed with Chairman Ma several times before, and he can probably express sympathy (?). Now that Chief Zhang has sent Ying Jihua to act as an agent, he will do his best to handle the government affairs of Jiang Province. Please forward to Chairman Ma to hand over the seal of Heilongjiang Province and financial powers, etc., in order to carry out everything. Chief Zhang has also said about the follow-up arrangements for Chairman Ma that he intends to immediately appoint him as the provincial garrison commander and still manage the military affairs of the entire province. The Japanese side can also understand. In the future, when Chief Zhang</p>
<p>If the official assumes the highest position in the Northeast, the chairman of Jiang Province, the brothers dare to guarantee, still belongs to Chairman Ma. Please do not send troops to use force again to devastate the people, (?)..." In addition, Zhao Shang had many tactful words of persuasion. At that time, Chief of Staff Xie replied, "What you said, from one aspect, can be said to be maintaining local security and having to compromise, but based on the national position, at the time of national destruction, who is the so-called local maintained for? And whether the people of Heilongjiang Province need or hope for the maintenance method you said is also a big problem. In short, the country has come to this point, and it is time for us to take responsibility. Life, death, honor and disgrace are not what we care about. In the past few days, Chairman Ma is also very grateful for the sections you have persuaded, but because of the issue of duty and under the urging of conscience and the people of the whole country, he has never dared to agree. As for the matter of handing over the Jiang Province seal and financial powers, etc., it should have been offered long ago based on personal friendship, but the so-called seal and political power are all given to the chairman by the central government, so how dare he abandon public affairs for personal gain and privately transfer them, and handle it this way, and at the private level, it is also sorry for the majority of brothers who gave their lives to resist the enemy, (soldiers). This point is really impossible to do, please don't worry. In addition, there is one more thing to tell you, please forward to the gentlemen in the future that our army has decided to launch a counterattack. All of them are willing to sacrifice a cavity of blood and vow to recover Jiang Province. Moreover, the Japanese commander Domon has led the Japanese army attacking Jiang Province to invade Jinzhou. There are only a few hundred Japanese troops left in Jiang Province at most. Our army retreated before, really because there were various unavoidable relations. Now the three armies are strong and vow to restore the homeland. The chairman can only follow the will of the majority of soldiers, lead the various departments, and go to the national crisis together. Therefore, today we have prepared to send out a large team of elite troops to take the opportunity to recover. However, without Chairman Ma's attack order, we will never attack. The reason why Chairman Ma did not order an attack is because Chief Zhang sent personnel to maintain Jiang Province's law and order, and there is no personal attempt, and he does not want to rush in with heavy troops, so that the external will become internal and lose the meaning of defending the country. Therefore, he only ordered the army to go to the vicinity of Jiangyuan and wait for further orders. As for the Japanese army's forgiveness and the appointment of Chairman Ma as the garrison commander, there is no need for this. At present, our army is united from top to bottom. Anyone who dares to compromise with the Japanese army under Chairman Ma, no matter who it is, has the right to kill him. If you don't believe it, you can ask Director Wang to come to Hailun for a trip, one is to handle Jiang Province's affairs, and the other is to see the spirit of our army, and then you will know that what I said is not wrong. Please convey the above to all parties. Our army has not surrendered under the pressure of Japanese artillery fire, let alone today when it has regained its strength. My words are the words of a soldier," and so on. It is heard that Zhao Zhongren listened to this lesson, but he is still unrepentant. He plans to go to Hulan today. After arriving there, he will ask someone to see Ma and try to persuade him (29th).</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese Disrupt Financial Plans <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Using News Agencies to Create an Unstable Atmosphere</p>
<p>Buying Cash in Wuhan Reaches 5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Wuhan Communication: After the Japanese forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces by force, they tried their best to destroy the internal security. At the same time, they also tried their best to disrupt the finances of various commercial ports. Military and economic aggression has really been carried out in two ways. All the chaotic situations such as the decline of public bonds and the exhaustion of finance are caused by the Japanese sabotage. Recently, Nanjing and Hankou have discovered this plan of the Japanese. The details obtained in Hankou are especially detailed. First, the Japanese in Hankou used good merchants and unscrupulous people to send telegrams to Beijing and Shanghai, creating various rumors to make the ports influence each other and create economic panic. The general agency for creating rumors is the Daily News and the United News Agency run by the Japanese. For example, the recent publication that only a dozen Qianzhuan businesses can operate in Hankou, and Shanghai banks are also in danger, and the Qianye Association requested the government to stop the anti-Japanese movement, etc., are all deliberately making alarming remarks and confusing the audience. After the Qianye Association, the Bank Association, and the General Chamber of Commerce petitioned the government to protest, they automatically made corrections, but the financial situation in Hankou has been slightly affected. On the 6th of this month, the newspaper published another news that "Qianzhuan businesses in Hankou went bankrupt again", saying that two Qianzhuan businesses in Hankou went bankrupt again. In fact, the two Qianzhuan businesses that suspended business recently, Huitong and Heng'an, were temporarily suspending business to clear accounts, not bankruptcy. The intention of creating this atmosphere again and again is beyond question. Unexpectedly, on the 7th, according to a certain source, the Japanese financial destruction plan is not limited to this. The most poisonous one is to buy a large amount of cash, which is carried out simultaneously in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Jinan. It is planned to buy 5 million yuan every day, and a total of 450 million yuan will be bought within three months. It is heard that the effect of buying in Beijing and Shanghai is less, while Hankou has achieved the first step of success. In the past ten days, the amount of the purchase has reached 5 million yuan. To this day, it is still buying about 500,000 yuan every day. The managers are the Hankou Banks of Zhengjin, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui. There are also some Chinese traitors who are used by them. This is indeed a serious problem that cannot be ignored (December 7).</p>
<h3 id="e62">Part of Japan's Illegal Pending Cases (II) <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Warship Destroying Chinese Ships and Killing Chinese People Near Magai, Miaojie Case: In June of the 9th year of the Republic of China, a Chai Feng ship dispatched by the Chinese fleet was near Magai, Russia. When it encountered the Japanese fleet, the ship immediately dropped anchor and moored and raised two national flags to avoid misunderstandings. However, the Japanese warship fired artillery, about eight or nine shots in total, sinking it, resulting in the injury and death of 34 boatmen and laborers. Afterwards, the ship was burned. Moreover, the Chinese captain and the Chinese consul stationed in Miaojie had repeatedly asked Japanese military officers to pay attention to the Chinese firewood transport ship near Magai. The military officers also agreed. On December 31 of the 9th year, our side sent a note to the Japanese ambassador based on the above facts, proposing four solutions: (1) The Japanese government should apologize to the Chinese government for the entire case. (2) The Japanese warship officers and soldiers who bombed the Chinese Feng ship should be investigated and severely punished, and the handling should be notified to China. (3) The 34 dead laborers and one seriously injured person should be given compensation. (4) The destroyed ship and all items in the ship should be compensated according to the number. The Japanese side said that the ship not only ignored the Japanese warship's request to moor, but also tried to escape, so it was shelled. Because it was feared that the ship would be used by the enemy, it was burned. The measures taken by the Japanese warship are in line with Article 63 of the London Declaration of 1909 and Article 49, and Articles 95, 96, 126, and 141 of the Japanese Naval Warfare Regulations. The Japanese government cannot bear the responsibility of compensation and other responsibilities, etc. On February 15 of the 11th year, the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs based on the naval ministry's review that the Feng ship had no resistance ability and no resistance behavior at that time. According to the London Declaration and Japanese Naval Warfare Regulations, the Japanese army did not confiscate the Feng ship. Moreover, it was hastily shelled. Also, the Japanese army's handling at that time was completely contrary to Article 49 of the London Declaration and Article 126 of the Japanese Naval Warfare Regulations, which said that destruction and proper inspection should not be done. The regulations cannot be applied at all, etc., rebutting the Japanese ambassador and requesting that the four articles of the premise be followed up and agreed as soon as possible. After that, they were repeatedly urged, but there were no results.</p>
<p>Jilin Hunchun Case: On October 2 of the 9th year of the Republic of China, bandits attacked Gong Hunchun and burned the Japanese consulate. 21 Japanese and Korean people died and 19 were injured. Japan immediately sent four squadrons and six detachments of troops to enter the country one after another. The Japanese ambassador put forward four requirements: (1) condolences, (2) compensation, (3) punishing those responsible, and (4) apology. In April of the 11th year, the Japanese ambassador submitted a list of losses, requesting that they be dealt with as soon as possible along with other items. Our side discussed with the Japanese ambassador that the Japanese army had entered the country without authorization and infringed on our sovereignty, and that the apology should be made by both sides. It was difficult to deal with the officials and according to the report of the Yanji Daoyin, in July of the 11th year, the losses suffered by the Chinese people and reclamation people in the five counties of Yanbian due to the entry of the Japanese army were proposed, and the Japanese side was asked to compensate. The pension and medical expenses of 24 Chinese people who died, 4 seriously injured, and 314 reclamation people were declared reserved. According to the Japanese ambassador's proposal, the two sides first sent personnel to exchange opinions. The Japanese side put forward the items of condolences for the Japanese and Korean people and property losses, totaling more than 464,000 Japanese yen. Our side based on the report of Yanji Daoyin, 242,000 yuan for property losses of Chinese people, more than 1 million yuan for reclamation people, and 459,000 yuan for pensions for Chinese people, and 1.986 million yuan for pensions for reclamation people. The commissioners of both parties negotiated repeatedly. The Japanese side said that Korean people cannot leave the country, and reclamation people are Japanese, and Japan cannot compensate them. As for the request for the Japanese government to apologize, the Japanese side said that the Japanese army dispatched troops based on the right of self-defense under international law and insisted on withdrawing the counterclaim. Our side rebutted and expressed that if the Japanese side could agree to apologize, the reclamation people's request could be discussed and concessions could be made. The Japanese side still insisted on not agreeing, and the contact was suspended. After that, they were repeatedly urged, and the Japanese ambassador has not yet given a specific answer.</p>
<p>Case of Japanese Man Xiaomiao Mitaku Assisting Bandits to Disrupt the Border: On September 24 of the 11th year, Jilin troops suppressed bandits and found that there was a Japanese man in the Idiot Team. They seized the Japanese man Xiaomiao near Yu Jiabao, and he carried official posts and silver ornaments. He confessed that he first worked as a coolie, and then joined the Idiot Team with the Japanese man Endo who had joined the Idiot Team earlier to fight bandits, intending to help the most Chinese bandits to disrupt the border in order to prepare for diplomatic excuses for his country to seize power. The bandits' weapons were not sold by them, but were supplied by their country. All the two machine guns were transported from their country to Toutaogou, Jiandao, nominally robbed by bandits, but actually delivered. The money, silver ornaments, etc., were stolen goods divided from successive robberies, etc. The Jilin Special Envoy transferred the person to the Japanese Consulate in Jilin for disposal and protested. On November 18, our side notified the Japanese ambassador, and told him that the world had long rumored that the Japanese military intelligence agencies secretly assisted bandits to disrupt our border in order to achieve their purpose of advancing troops to station police. Judging from the discovery of munitions in Harbin and the personal confession of the Japanese man Xiaotoku this time, it is indeed an undeniable fact that the Japanese have been helping Chinese bandits along the border. Please convey to your government to severely punish and strictly prohibit it. According to the reply, the Japanese man had no assistance to the bandits. The previous confession was forced by Battalion Commander Li. We immediately rebutted the Japanese ambassador based on the facts, and still asked him to handle it in accordance with our previous note. On December 14 of the 20th year, they were urged again, but there was no reply.</p>
<p>Transfer of Qingdao Observatory (formerly known as Qingdao Meteorological Observatory) Japanese Personnel Case: When Qingdao was taken over in the 11th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese refused to return the Qingdao Meteorological Observatory on the grounds that our country did not have meteorological professionals for a while. After the Shandong Case Rehabilitation Governor and the Japanese ambassador negotiated repeatedly, eight measures were formulated, including allowing our country to send personnel to the office to jointly handle the matter, and Japanese personnel would continue to serve temporarily. The former Beijing Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side. The Japanese ambassador had an expression of starting negotiations, but there was no result. In August of the 18th year, our side, according to Article 5 (3) of the Annex to the Shandong Pending Case Details Agreement, "When Chinese Meteorological Observatory staff are trained in the future, and the old staff is transferred, the method of reporting and contacting the Japanese Meteorological Observatory will be changed" and sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese side. Our side proposed seven measures to determine the method of reporting and contacting the Japanese Meteorological Observatory after the Japanese personnel of the Qingdao Observatory were transferred. The Japanese side also proposed seven measures and three items for understanding. The sections in which the observation and investigation of geomagnetism and gas at the Qingdao Observatory were to be presided over by Japanese technicians were in conflict with the above provisions. After repeated negotiations, it was not resolved. In January of the 19th year, our side continued to urge the Japanese side to consult as soon as possible. He replied that the Chinese staff had been replaced a lot, and the technology had not been degraded, and the instruments used were French style, which was inconvenient for the Japanese meteorological report and contact. He also said that both China and Japan had geomagnetism observations at the Qingdao Observatory, and the Japanese side asked to study and compare with each other, but the Chinese side did not agree and directly sent the observations to the Dutch Bilt Meteorological Publication. It is observed that the publication of the station is not accurate, which is particularly relevant to the navigation of Japanese ships in Qingdao. All of the above were rebutted one by one and requested that technicians be sent as soon as possible to consult with our side on the method of reporting and contacting after the transfer. After that, they repeatedly urged the Japanese ambassador but there was no reply.</p>
<p>Abolishing the South Manchurian Japanese Post Case: At the Washington Conference, our country proposed to abolish the foreign posts in China. At that time, the Japanese representative had presented his opinion on the Japanese posts in the South Manchurian Railway area at the conference table. After repeated discussions, it was recognized that Japan only had transit rights in the South Manchurian Railway area, and the Japanese representative had no different words. After the General Assembly decided, all post offices in China from England, the United States, France, Japan and other countries, except for leased areas and treaty permits, were abolished before January 1, 1923. In July of the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), the Japanese ambassador proposed to send personnel to discuss various agreements after the abolition of Japanese posts. In August, the committee of both parties met in Beijing. In addition to signing various new postal agreements, an attached document stated that the Japanese post issue in the South Manchurian Railway area would be further negotiated by the governments of the two countries in the future. After that, the Japanese ambassador was repeatedly notified and the abolition proposal was repeated, but there was no result. According to the Postal Administration's report in May of the 17th year, the number of Japanese post offices and post offices in the South Manchurian Railway area had reached more than 60.</p>
<p>Changsha June 1 Case: On June 1 of the 12th year of the Republic of China, when the Nisshin Company merchant ship Wuling Maru arrived in Changsha, it happened that the citizens were giving speeches on the river bank, and the crowd gathered to watch, obstructing the landing of passengers. The Japanese warship Fushimi suddenly dispatched unarmed sailors to land to show off its power. After the Hunan provincial government tried its best to suppress and requested the Japanese consul to protect and request a withdrawal, it was invalid. The warship then dispatched 20 armed soldiers to land when the crowd gradually dispersed. Under the command of an officer, they suddenly fired at the crowd, killing two unarmed citizens and seriously injuring 15 people. The deaths and injuries were all outside the Japanese merchant wharf, which showed that the pursuit at that time was not an act of self-defense. After the case occurred, the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to the Japanese ambassador on the 5th based on the Hunan provincial report on June 3. On the 6th, it notified the Japanese ambassador based on the articles proposed by Hunan Province. The original conditions were as follows: (1) The commander and soldiers who shot and killed the Chinese people this time must be severely punished in accordance with Japanese military law and the handling must be notified to the Chinese officials. (2) The Chinese people who were shot and injured must be given generous pensions. (3) The commander of the Japanese fleet must apologize to the Hunan provincial officials. (4) The Japanese government must also express its apology to the Chinese government in an official document. (5) The Japanese government guarantees that such incidents will not happen again in the future. At the same time, it telegraphed Ambassador Wang stationed in Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government, and the ministry sent a commissioner to Hunan to investigate. It repeatedly urged the Japanese ambassador and the Japanese government to agree to the five items proposed. The Japanese government insisted that the sailors' actions were legitimate defense. After official correspondence, the two parties met and negotiated, but the case has not been closed. On June 4 of the 20th year, our side requested the Japanese representative to telegraph the Japanese government in accordance with the above five articles, and they were quickly dealt with, but there was still no definite reply (to be continued).</p>
<h3 id="e63">Planned Works for the Sea Walls of Jiangsu Province <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Urgent Projects to be Undertaken First</p>
<p>Funding Has Been Secured</p>
<p>The sea walls along the southern Jiangsu province have suffered from neglect in recent years due to insufficient funding and the cessation of annual repairs. Damage to the walls is widespread, with most of the gentle slopes collapsing and the pilings resembling broken teeth. Even some of the new cement structures are showing signs of damage and shifting. In the event of a breach, the old Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang regions would be devastated. Shen Baozhang, the acting director of the former Jiangnan Sea Wall Office, under the instruction of the Construction Department, has conducted a thorough assessment of the post-disaster reconstruction efforts in each county. He has already drafted a plan with charts, estimating a total cost of 1,302,914 silver dollars for labor and materials. The most critical projects, which require immediate attention, include the Xuejiatan and Zhangjiazai areas in Baoshan, the military review platform in Taicang, the Xuliujingkou area in Changshu, and the third phase of supplementary works in Songjiang. However, the total cost is substantial. Given the aftermath of the disaster and the depleted state of the treasury, raising the necessary funds may prove difficult. The current Construction Department Director, Shen Baixian, believes that the sea wall project is crucial to the lives and livelihoods of the people, and that every effort must be made despite the financial difficulties. It is reported that he intends to prioritize projects based on their urgency and the current economic capacity, ensuring that the most critical areas are addressed without delay, while the less urgent projects can be completed in sequence. The cost of these urgent projects is estimated at 362,363 silver dollars, which will be offset by 300,000 silver dollars from the provincial capital construction fund within the construction bonds and 300,000 silver dollars from the Zhenjiang port improvement project. It is reported that the Provincial Government Committee has already resolved to proceed accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e72">A Little Advice on Elementary School Students' Patriotic Speech Competition <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Qin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Community United Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association hosted an elementary school student speech contest on the 5th of this month at Wuben Girls' School in Nanshi. Twenty-nine elementary schools attended the event. The students were full of spirit and spoke fluently and freely, and it is worth noting that the top five students were all girls. In terms of the meaning of the speeches, they were generally very good, and can be summarized into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Boycotting Japanese goods and refusing to cooperate with the Japanese at any time or place, implementing economic severance.</p>
<p>(2) Strengthening the body and cultivating the spirit of enduring hardship.</p>
<p>(3) Striving for learning; wanting to defeat a strong enemy requires first knowing yourself and knowing your enemy. In this era of scientific advancement, it is especially necessary to study science to revitalize the country. (4) Saving money for national salvation; saving the money spent on candy to accumulate a larger sum for national salvation.</p>
<p>The above four methods are all appropriate. When we talk about saving the country, it should be regarded as an inviolable principle. If we can expand upon these ideas and implement them throughout the country, not only will the teachers and students in schools be engaged in researching methods to save the country and cultivate a patriotic spirit to work hard to save the country, but also the families of the students will inevitably be slightly influenced.</p>
<p>However, in addition to the above-mentioned benefits, I have a little advice regarding this speech competition. The meaning and drafting of the speeches can be done in cooperation between teachers and students. For example, after teachers and students jointly discuss and research the meaning of the speeches, the students should draft the speeches themselves, and then the teachers should revise them. In this way, the effect of working together can be achieved in terms of work, and children can be given more opportunities to be automatic in terms of teaching.</p>
<p>However, most of the speeches of the children this time were in the tone of adults. From this point of view, I am afraid that the original speeches were mostly done by the teachers. If that is the case, then the students' speeches cannot avoid the drawback of being like a record player. I sincerely hope that patriotic comrades in the academic community will research and improve this aspect, and I hope to work hard to implement the above four methods.</p>

<h3 id="e73">National Government Responds to Students of Universities and Middle Schools <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Secretariat of the National Government telegraphed the Shanghai University and Middle School Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association on the 8th, stating: "To be immediately forwarded to the Shanghai Mayor Zhang, to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of University and Middle School Students: We have received the message from the Chairman. The government's established policy towards Japan remains unchanged. We are determined to defend ourselves and will never lose an inch of territory. At the same time, we appeal to the international community, gather the power of justice, and use sanctions against the violent. The so-called establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou, the so-called direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, are not only not advocated, but have been announced in detail and published in newspapers. The people of the country should all see this. Why the doubt? In the League of Nations case, the Japanese have been cunning and deceitful, creating new complications and making unreasonable demands. Representative Shi has been strictly protesting for days and will never make concessions that harm the country. This Chairman has long been determined to sacrifice himself for the country. As long as the people do not disrupt their steps, we will surely do our best to defend the country. All the worries of the students are being considered by the government. However, the appointment of personnel and administration are within the government's authority. In this time of national crisis, should there be discordant opinions, much suspicion and obstruction. Regarding diplomacy, the people should only observe the facts and plan for its success. This is what all true patriots should understand. As for the request to release the students of Peking University and Central University, no student in the Central Government has lost his freedom. The Peking University demonstration group, however, after arriving in Beijing, publicly announced demonstrations, refused reception of leaflets and slogans, and openly expressed agitation, disruption and overthrow of the government. The military police dissuaded them, but they acted violently. For the sake of order, it was necessary to transfer some of them to another place for isolation and supervision. They have now been sent back to Peiping. There is no so-called release. The government loves and protects the youth and will never allow the youth and reactionaries to achieve their sacrifices. The poisonous schemes of the youth have been tolerated in many ways, and the facts are there. The students need not lightly believe rumors and hastily apply. In summary, this telegram not only misunderstands the true meaning of democracy and the responsibilities of the people, but also sets a deadline for a reply, treating the government as a hostile country. Such unprecedented demands are truly appalling. Even if it is said that words are chosen in haste, should they not be self-examined to this point? Considering that the government treats the youth and students as teachers treat their children, we still uphold the duty of teaching and make a detailed announcement. The association is a collection of university students, who are committed to saving the country and know the country's crisis. They must take responsibility as patriotic youth, distinguish between safety and danger, trust the government, abide by discipline, and not be taken advantage of by reactionaries to aggravate the foreign troubles of the enemy. This is of utmost importance. This is a special decree from the Secretariat of the National Government."</p>

<h3 id="e78">Shanghai Universities Federation Telegraphed the Ministry of Education <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Clearly Announce Important Diplomatic News</p>
<p>The Shanghai Universities Federation telegraphed the Ministry of Education in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Education in Nanjing, in recent days, newspapers have published diplomatic news stating that the government has directly negotiated with Japan, recognized the designation of Jinzhou as a neutral zone, and proposed international co-management of Tianjin in the League of Nations. Various groups in Shanghai have been running around in shock, and letters and telegrams have been pouring in. Students from various schools have also been discussing making a third petition to Beijing. By the time various newspapers published various documents and talks from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Government Secretariat, the explanation was too late, and the explanations were not clear enough. Therefore, the people of society still have doubts. To make amends after the fact is already too much. Why not be open and honest before the event to show great faith to the country? Moreover, the government has repeatedly sought to be in unison with the people. If the government's attitude is first hesitant and uncertain, how can it be held accountable to the people? The schools believe that the government should designate a certain agency from now on to clearly announce important diplomatic news on a daily basis, so that the people can understand and those who spread rumors and slander will have no chance to take advantage of it. Then the instability of the people's hearts can also be stabilized, which will be of great benefit to the future of the country. We respectfully request that this be forwarded and adopted for implementation. The telegram cannot be written with enough earnestness. The Shanghai Universities Federation bows and scrapes.</p>

<p>All students of the Law School of Soochow University on Kunshan Road in Shanghai yesterday sent a letter of sincere advice to Principal Yang Yongqing, protesting his appointment as Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which read: "To Principal Yongqing, upon reading the news of your new position as Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we were extremely surprised. Gu Weijun was known to all, men and women, as a notorious lackey of the warlords. Now, taking advantage of the circumstances, he has once again stolen a high position. We hoped that he would sincerely correct his past mistakes and strive to redeem himself. However, he has become even more demented, flattering and selling out the country. This news has greatly contradicted public opinion, resulting in the loss of rights and humiliation of the nation, even worse than the Twenty-One Demands. His guilt to the nation is far greater than that of Cao, Lu, and Zhang. It should be known that the current national sentiment is more激昂 than the May Fourth Movement, and the future outcome is self-evident. Considering that you, sir, have been the principal for many years, and have always earnestly taught the students about integrity and character, we are now surprised to see you act contrary to your words, actually colluding with national traitors, becoming birds of a feather. Therefore, we, the students, have unanimously decided to appeal to you, sir, to resign from the position of Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as soon as possible and return to managing the school, in order to preserve your own integrity and maintain the past glory of our school. We offer this sincere and frank advice, daring to speak truthfully. Whether you are wise or foolish will be decided in this instant. We hope you, sir, will consider it carefully."</p>

<p>Tomorrow's Return to America Match Canceled</p>
<p>Defeated by Fincher in Hong Kong Performance</p>
<p>Tennis Queen Mrs. Moody will return here from Hong Kong with her husband on the President Coolidge this morning, and will leave Shanghai for America tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Good Fortune is Too Shallow, Performance Canceled</p>
<p>Mrs. Moody has decided to take the original ship and leave Shanghai for America tomorrow morning, only staying here for twenty-four hours. The Lawn Tennis Association sent a telegram to the ship yesterday, but did not receive a reply late at night. Therefore, they had no choice but to announce the cancellation of the performance match. Those who have reserved seats can go to the Shishi Yanghang tomorrow to retrieve the reservation fee. Mrs. Moody gave one performance in Hong Kong, with one win and one loss.</p>
<p>Lost One Singles Match to Fincher</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the eighth, in light rain and a gentle breeze, everyone took the stage to perform until the end, and the rain still did not stop. The opponent for Mrs. Moody's singles match was Fincher, a famous Hong Kong player who had represented the inter-port team. Although the weather was bad, the audience was large. Only one set was played, with the score at 5-5, 6-6, and then 7-7. The atmosphere suddenly became tense. Continuing, they tied at 9-9. At this point, Mrs. Moody showed impatience and then lost two consecutive games, losing 11-9. Fincher's victory required great effort.</p>
<p>Adding Flowers to the Brocade, a Great Victory in Doubles</p>
<p>She then paired with HD Lunqiang to perform doubles against Luo Wenhuan and SA Lunqiang. As a result, she was like a tiger with wings, invincible. Adding flowers to the brocade, she showed her beauty even more. Swinging left and hitting right, coordinating well, Mrs. Moody and Lunqiang won a great victory with a score of 6-2, 7-5. The audience was amazed.</p>
<p>Talks with American, British, and Japanese Tennis Players</p>
<p>Someone went to ask Mrs. Moody, and the conversation touched on tennis players from various countries. Mrs. Moody said that Japanese women's tennis is still in its infancy, but they are eager to learn and have great hopes. (What about our country?) This year's British tennis is a glorious era of revival. Defeating America in the Davis Cup, Austin, the number one player, is enough to compete with anyone in the world. The same is true for Bailey. Women players are emerging like a rising wind and surging clouds, with boundless hope and a bright future. As for America's Vines, he is a teenage genius who defeated all American players and the British Bailey this year to rank first, looking down on the world with ease.</p>

<h3 id="e91">University Students Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>When the Anti-Japanese Associations of Various Universities Met Yesterday</p>
<p>Xu Xiucen, Representative of Peking University, Was Suddenly Kidnapped</p>
<p>Jiang Xueqian, Representative of Central University, Was Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Promised to Investigate and Hold Responsible Personnel Accountable</p>
<p>Petitioning Students Had Not Dispersed as of 3:00 AM This Morning</p>
<p>Xu Xiucen, representative of the Peking University delegation to petition in Beijing, and Jiang Xueqian, representative of Central University, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to report to all sectors and request assistance. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Shanghai United Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Various Universities held its 21st Representative Conference at the Ximen Juvenile Propaganda Group. Representatives from various schools attended, and Xu and Jiang were also invited to attend. During the meeting, more than ten people in plain clothes were eavesdropping. After the meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM, there were also more than ten plainclothes people outside the door who kidnapped Xu Xiucen, the representative of Peking University, into a car and sped away. Jiang Xueqian, the representative of Central University, was severely beaten and injured. More than 5,000 students petitioned the Municipal Government at 4:00 PM, forming an encirclement. Mayor Zhang immediately agreed to suspend Chen Xizeng, Director of the Public Security Bureau, from his duties for investigation and to arrest and apprehend Tao Baichuan, a member of the Municipal Party Committee. The students demanded that they would not leave the Municipal Government until the arrested students were released. As of this newspaper's press time this morning, they had not yet dispersed. Yesterday afternoon at 5:50 PM, the Municipal Party Headquarters was also vandalized and its equipment destroyed. Martial law was declared in the French Concession in the evening. The detailed account of the incident is summarized below:</p>
<p>Attending the Meeting Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the 21st Representative Conference of the United Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Various Universities was held inside the Xiaoximen Juvenile Propaganda Group. Representatives from 29 universities attended, chaired by Wen Guangyi of Jinan University and recorded by Zhu Zushun of Fudan University. Various cases were discussed. During the meeting, Xu Xiucen, the representative of the Peking University delegation to Shanghai, gave a passionate speech, mentioning several points: (1) The Peking University delegation was detained in Xiaolingwei, suffering from hunger and cold. (2) The delegation was bound with ropes by police and soldiers and taken to a car in heavy rain at 3:00 AM in the middle of the night and transported to Pukou to cross the river. (3) He hoped that the students in Shanghai would follow the spirit of Peking University and fight together. After Xu's speech, Jiang Xueqian, the representative of Central University, rose and reported on the situation of the mass student movement in Beijing: (1) The mass movement has become more积极 in urging the government. (2) The general demonstration in the capital yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) involved 5,000 to 6,000 people and was very orderly. (3) The problems of food and lodging for Shanghai students going to Beijing can all be solved. (4) The arrested students of the Peking University delegation have been押至 to Peiping. After the two men spoke, the atmosphere in the entire venue became very tense. Then, other cases were discussed until the meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM. Ambush Situation When the meeting adjourned, representatives from various universities went out one after another. All the directors went upstairs to the office to handle affairs. The two representatives from Peking University and Central University, because they were new to Shanghai, were busy exchanging greetings with the directors and representatives. It was not until all the representatives had dispersed that they also went out together. As soon as they went down the stone steps, beside the car parked in front of the steps, suddenly twenty or thirty plainclothes armed men rushed forward and violently beat the two representatives. The two representatives frantically cried for help and tried their best to resist, but they were outnumbered and dragged into the prepared car. At this time, the two men were still trying to struggle. Jiang, the representative of Central University, struggled and jumped out of the car. At this time, Wen Guangyi, Lin Zuyu, and other directors in the venue also came out after hearing the news and tried to rescue him, successfully rescuing Jiang from danger. However, Xu from Peking University was kidnapped and his whereabouts are still unknown. One of the assailants was captured on the spot, named Wang Fusheng, and escorted to the nearby police station. The rest of the assailants had already escaped.</p>
<p>Students' Statement According to a student from a certain school who witnessed the incident, there were more than ten plainclothes people eavesdropping in the venue at that time, acting like they were monitoring. Whenever students spoke, they loudly disturbed them, but the students still endured it and continued the meeting. Tao Baichuan, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, initially attended, but suddenly withdrew halfway. It was reported that representatives from Cultural and Tongji Universities witnessed that two of the perpetrators were cadres from a certain agency, one surnamed Liu and the other surnamed Zhang.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Handling At that time, representatives from various schools rushed to report to the Second District, Second Branch of the nearby Public Security Bureau. By the time the police arrived, the plainclothes people had already dispersed. Meanwhile, several representatives from a certain school hired a car to send the injured Jiang Xueqian, the representative of Central University, to Baolong Hospital on Baike Road for treatment. Representatives from various schools were extremely indignant, some even shedding tears. They then moved to Minli Middle School to continue the meeting and immediately decided on the handling of the tragedy: (1) The Public Security Bureau must immediately find the representative from Peking University. (2) Please the authorities to severely punish the perpetrators. (3) Please the Public Security Bureau to guarantee that this kind of tragedy will not happen again. (4) Punish the derelict head of the Second District, Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau. (5) Please the Public Security Bureau to bear the cost of the injured student's losses and medical expenses. According to a representative from a certain school speaking to the Huadong News Agency reporter, when the tragedy occurred, the police巡警 of the Public Security Bureau were very close by. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau bears considerable responsibility for this tragedy.</p>
<p>Jiang's Injuries Jiang Xueqian, the representative of Central University, was severely beaten and injured, with several wounds on his head and nose, his face covered in blood, and also injuries to his lower body. At about 1:00 PM, he was taken to Baolong Hospital on Baike Road for treatment under the name of Xu, and entered Ward 106. He was discharged from the hospital at about 5:00 PM that afternoon and secretly moved to another place for recuperation, fearing that something unexpected might happen.</p>
<p>Going to the Public Security Bureau After the University Association sent Jiang to Baolong Hospital, it sent several representatives to the Public Security Bureau to see Director Chen Xizeng. Director Chen personally received them. The student representatives requested four points: (1) Find out the whereabouts of the representative from Peking University. (2) Severely punish the perpetrators. (3) Guarantee that this incident will not happen again in the future. (4) Severely punish the derelict officials of the Public Security Bureau (because the branch office is directly opposite the association, and they did not provide protection during the attack). Chen replied as follows: The first point is difficult to achieve in fact, but he will issue an order to all districts under his jurisdiction to strictly arrest the perpetrators. The second point is a judicial issue and the captured perpetrators will be sent to the court for trial. The third point is also difficult to achieve, because the police officers of the Public Security Bureau are in charge of security and can only suppress incidents after they occur, and there is no possibility of preventing them before they happen. The fourth point, if the personnel of the Public Security Bureau are indeed derelict in their duties, they will be punished according to the law.</p>
<p>The Perpetrator Confesses The captured perpetrator, Wang Fusheng, after being captured by the students, was handed over to the police station and transferred to the General Bureau. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, he was escorted to the District Court. Wang confessed that he was a worker at the Ordnance Factory. On this day, after eating, he went to the factory to work and was waiting there for a tram to Gaochang Temple to take the tram. Unexpectedly, before the tram arrived, a large number of university students suddenly came out from inside and passed by him. Suddenly, an incident of thugs beating people occurred, and he was arrested. He did not know anything else.</p>
<p>Today's Conference Since the tragedy occurred, the student community has been very indignant. It is reported that an emergency joint conference of university and middle school representatives from the city will be convened at 9:00 AM this morning to decide on measures to address this tragedy.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government After this incident occurred yesterday, more than 500 students from Jiao Tong University first went to the Municipal Government to petition at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. Soon, students from Guanghua, Daxia, Fazheng, Fudan, Liangjiang, Art Academy, Jiangnan College, Merchant Marine School, and the Chinese Students Association of Japan also arrived in droves. Students from Jinan University finally walked to the scene, totaling no less than 5,000 people. When students from Guanghua and Jiao Tong Universities first arrived at the Municipal Government, the gates of the Municipal Government were guarded by student volunteers. They first elected representatives to request an audience with Mayor Zhang and put forward four conditions: (1) No suppression of the anti-Japanese movement. (2) Release the arrested students. (3) Punish the Director of the Public Security Bureau. (4) Punish the Municipal Party personnel. When the students petitioned, Mayor Zhang happened to be meeting with Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, so he asked Secretary-General Yu to represent him in receiving them on the Municipal Government square. However, all the students insisted that Mayor Zhang personally reply. Zhang had no choice but to personally receive all the petitioning students in the Municipal Government square at 4:15 PM. When Mayor Zhang received them, he first asked the student representatives to state the incident. The representative of Jiao Tong University then stated to Mayor Zhang, roughly saying that when the universities held a joint conference this morning, there were many plainclothes armed personnel stationed in the venue. When the meeting adjourned, these plainclothes personnel suddenly took out guns and kidnapped Jiang Xueqian, the student representative of Central University, and Xu Xiucen, the student representative of Peking University. When intercepting the representative of Central University at that time, the students on the scene personally saw Zhang, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, holding his hand tightly. Fortunately, Jiang managed to break free with all his strength, but he was already seriously injured and is now sick in Baolong Hospital. As for Xu Xiucen, the student representative of Peking University, he was kidnapped and his life and death are still unknown. What is most suspicious is that the Second District, Second Branch office is very close by, but it has never asked about this matter, so it is believed that this incident is organized and the Public Security Bureau cannot shirk its responsibility. The students had petitioned the Public Security Bureau earlier, but Director Chen's reply was not satisfactory, so they are asking to see the Mayor and requesting a satisfactory reply, and please accept all the terms and immediately release the arrested students. After Mayor Zhang listened to the student representatives' statement of the situation, he immediately replied to each condition: (1) Since the Northeast Incident occurred, it has been eighty days, and the Municipal Government has never suppressed the national salvation movement. (2) Release the arrested students. At this moment, there is no confirmation whether the students have been arrested, but he will decide with his conscience and investigate tonight, and tomorrow (i.e., today) he will ask the schools to send representatives to give a detailed reply. (3) Punish the responsible personnel, and will definitely investigate and deal with them. (4) The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government are parallel agencies, and the Municipal Government has no authority to deal with them, but it can send a letter to inquire about everything. When Zhang replied, he asked all the students to return to school as soon as possible, and he would be responsible for everything and handle it properly. At that time, after all the students listened to Zhang's reply, some students expressed dissatisfaction and expressed their opinions on the spot, urging Zhang to immediately release Xu Xiucen, otherwise all the students vowed not to return to school. Zhang said that it was difficult to do so immediately in terms of procedures, and asked all the students to forgive him. At that time, some students shouted and asked Mayor Zhang to order the Public Security Bureau to release them by phone. Zhang had no choice but to agree to call the Public Security Bureau to inquire about everything. It was already 7:00 PM, and the large group of students waited quietly on the Municipal Government Square and the side of the Municipal Government Road, listening quietly for news. However, when Zhang called the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the sound of the phone calls back and forth was糢糊, and the whole situation was still not clear. He sent Secretary-General Yu to the Public Security Bureau to investigate. When Yu set off, he first explained the reason to all the students before getting into the car and leaving.</p>
<p>Representatives Meeting At this time, students from various schools arrived one after another, so they urgently convened an emergency meeting of representatives, and publicly elected Zheng Jie of Daxia University as chairman and Wang Yaodong of Fazheng as secretary, and decided that the common demands had three purposes: (1) Release the arrested students. (2) Execute the Director of the Public Security Bureau. (3) Execute the perpetrators and instigators.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's Reply Mayor Zhang met with the students repeatedly after 8:00 PM and earnestly replied to the students' requests. As of this newspaper's press time, a total of seven points had been answered: (1) I will not leave the Municipal Government until I meet with the students arrested at Peking University. (2) The perpetrators will be handed over to the public, but the government must be asked for instructions and be responsible for requesting the government to execute them. (3) Regarding the Director of the Public Security Bureau, an edict will be issued immediately to suspend him from his duties pending investigation. (4) Be responsible for negotiating with the court and immediately hand over the perpetrators. (5) No suppression of the mass movement. (6) The instigator will be handled together with the second item. (7) Immediately issue an order to arrest and apprehend Tao Baichuan. Students Did Not Disperse At about 10:00 PM, Secretary-General Yu returned to the government and reported that the perpetrators had been transferred to the District Court for punishment according to law. The students insisted that the perpetrators must be brought to the Municipal Government and tried in public, and demanded that they would not disperse until the arrested Peking University students were released and met. After Mayor Zhang's earnest persuasion was ineffective, Police Commander Xiong Shihui also sent two aides to the Municipal Government at about 11:00 PM to address the crowd on behalf of Xiong, urging them to go back and rest for the time being, and to wait for Commander Xiong and Mayor Zhang to discuss a solution at length, which would definitely satisfy everyone. However, they were also rejected by the students. As of 3:00 AM this morning, all the students were still standing erect in the square in front of the Municipal Government and did not disperse.</p>
<p>Chen's Suspension Order Mayor Zhang issued an order last night to suspend Chen Xizeng, Director of the Public Security Bureau, for investigation. The original order stated: "This afternoon, when students from various universities held a meeting, there were situations in which students were beaten and injured by thugs and kidnapped. The Director of the Bureau was negligent in prevention beforehand and even more unable to solve the case quickly afterward, which is a dereliction of duty. His crime is inexcusable. He is hereby suspended from his duties pending investigation." This order is addressed to Chen Xizeng, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, Zhang Qun, December 9. It is reported that Chen will not go to the bureau to work starting today, and his duties will be performed by Chief Inspector Wang on his behalf.</p>
<p>Arrest Tao Baichuan Mayor Zhang issued an order last night to investigate and arrest Tao Baichuan. According to reports from students from Jiao Tong, Guanghua, Fudan, and Daxia Universities, when students from various universities held a meeting this afternoon, there were situations in which students were beaten and injured and kidnapped, and it was claimed that Tao Baichuan was the instigator, and it was requested that he be arrested and punished according to law. Based on this, it is appropriate to order the Public Security Bureau to quickly investigate and arrest Tao Baichuan, bring him to justice for investigation and handling. This order, Zhang Qun, December 9.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Destroyed Yesterday afternoon at 5:50 PM, about 300 students organized a team to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, taking four Ningbo搬場 cars and two Chinese搬場 cars. When they arrived, because no one was responsible for receiving them, it aroused public anger and they vandalized the objects in the department's Civil Training Section reception room and office. At that time, Standing Committee Member Tao Baichuan was still in the office and left shortly thereafter. Afterwards, the Municipal Party Headquarters issued a notice saying: "To whom it may concern, at about 6:00 PM this afternoon, reactionary elements incited a group of students to suddenly come to the Municipal Party Headquarters to carry out harassment and destroy all equipment. The reasons and details of what happened will be notified in another article. Fearing that the rumors are untrue, we will first send a letter. Sincerely, Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, December 9." French Concession Martial Law The French Concession's 捕心 suddenly announced martial law at about 7:00 PM. All the iron gates at the border between the Chinese and French concessions were closed, and all the trams only drove to Xiaobeimen and no longer entered the Chinese concession. Armed police were added to patrol the streets, and the situation was serious.</p>

<p>Youth Support-Ma Expedition Arrived in Nanxiang Yesterday</p>
<p>萬人揮淚送征人</p>
<p>Ten Thousand People Tearfully Bid Farewell to the Expeditionaries</p>
<p>The Youth Volunteer Corps to Support General Ma and Resist Japan in Northeast China, originally scheduled to depart from Zhenru this morning, was moved by the news in the newspapers yesterday morning of General Ma Xiufang's telegram to the corps. They immediately mobilized and departed yesterday morning. The corps leader, Zhang Shaojie, came to Shanghai to send a telegram to Chairman Ma. The situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>團員出發</p>
<p>Expedition Members Depart</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after members of the corps discovered General Ma Zhanshan's telegram requesting assistance for the youth in Heilongjiang in the newspapers, they immediately convened an emergency meeting. After a unanimous decision, many said they would commit suicide if they could not go to Heilongjiang immediately. Therefore, they decided to depart immediately regardless of everything and sent Zhang Shaojie to Shanghai to send a telegram to General Ma Zhanshan. The personal belongings originally carried by each person were abandoned, and instead, two people shared one set of luggage for easy carrying.</p>
<p>各界送别</p>
<p>People from All Walks of Life Bid Farewell</p>
<p>Upon hearing that the corps was departing, no fewer than ten thousand people came to bid farewell. Everyone shed tears. When the faculty and students of Jinan University were about to part, they donated over 300 yuan. Many students even boycotted classes to send the corps to Nanxiang. The villagers who came to see them off also tearfully presented them with copper coins and food.</p>
<p>路局備車</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Prepares Cars</p>
<p>Zhenru Station had prepared a special first-class car for the corps to go to Beijing. The railway staff also contacted the corps, but the corps politely declined. When they were about to leave, the railway police saluted them.</p>
<p>加入團員</p>
<p>New Members Join the Expedition</p>
<p>Chen JiongHao, a nurse from the Wusong Sanatorium, Li Kezhai, an overseas Chinese from Siam, and others walked from Shanghai to Jinan University the night before to gather and depart. Yesterday morning, several members of the Indian Alliance Association rushed to Zhenru, expressing their willingness to cooperate with the corps and go north together. However, due to language barriers and nationality issues, it was difficult to travel together. The corps politely expressed their sincere acceptance of their kindness, but due to various practical issues, they could not easily agree. The Indians expressed their disappointment with understanding. The corps also received a letter from Mr. Xu Fuyuan of Suzhou yesterday, which roughly stated: The loyal and unparalleled General Ma has been defeated again. Fuyuan's heart is about to break. I regret that I cannot fly to the Northeast to fight those Japanese bandits. Fortunately, you comrades have formed a corps to support Ma in Heilongjiang. The bravery and grand style are what a real man should do in this world. I am willing to join you enthusiastically and share life and death with you comrades, sprinkling my blood on the black walls to fulfill my original intention. I sincerely hope you will not refuse. If you cannot agree, I will end my life. It is said that Mr. Xu is waiting at the Suzhou station to join the corps.</p>
<p>團長來滬</p>
<p>Corps Leader Comes to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the corps departed on foot, they sent the corps leader, Zhang Shaojie, to Shanghai to send a telegram. Chen Zhenru and He Jingzhi were trying to invite the corps leader to talk. Mr. Zhang then went to Mr. Chen's residence on Ga'en Road to meet him. It is said that the two gentlemen offered encouragement and Mr. Chen made some gifts.</p>
<p>粤方代表</p>
<p>Guangdong Representatives</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and Zou Haibin heard that Mr. Zhang had come to Shanghai and immediately invited him to talk. However, due to time constraints, Mr. Zhang was unable to meet with them.

<p>Hailun 转马主席占山钧鉴，齐电奉悉，吾公独抗倭奴，敬仰无涯，中华民族之一线生机，端赖吾公之最后奋斗，慨自倭奴逞暴以来，全国军人，袖手旁观，各党各派，争权夺利，民族之危亡，同胞之惨痛，不堪言状，我公既能独抗，我等何忍偷生，明知力微势薄，天寒路远，然覆巢之下，必无完卵，与其死于贼手，不若死于杀贼，即或不能到达东北，亦愿以我等热血与灵魂，唤醒中华民族，为我五千年历史争光荣，使世界知中华民族尚未死绝，使吾辈青年，知世间尚有继续牺牲之份子，倘继起有人，虽死何恨，年来党派纷歧，亡国之象已具，与其做内战之工具，曷若为民族生存而流血，我等现已下必死决心，誓与吾公同生死，与东北共存亡，请吾公保重，奋斗到底，勿以为念，我等均属强壮青年，热血沸腾，决心不惜一切，现已兼程离沪，沿途组合，苟吾全国同胞，一致自动前往，区区倭奴，何足道哉，临电感泣，不知所云，</p>
<p>To Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Hailun: We have received your telegram. We deeply admire your heroic resistance against the Japanese invaders. The last hope of the Chinese nation depends on your final struggle. Since the Japanese invaders began their violence, the national army has stood by idly, and various parties and factions have been fighting for power and profit. The peril of the nation and the suffering of our compatriots are indescribable. Since you are able to resist alone, how can we bear to live in ease? We know that our strength is weak, the weather is cold, and the journey is long, but when the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact. Rather than dying at the hands of the enemy, it is better to die killing the enemy. Even if we cannot reach the Northeast, we are willing to use our blood and souls to awaken the Chinese nation, to win glory for our 5,000-year history, to let the world know that the Chinese nation is not dead, and to let us young people know that there are still those who are willing to continue to sacrifice. If there are successors, we will have no regrets even if we die. In recent years, the party factions have been divided, and the signs of national subjugation are evident. Rather than being tools of internal strife, why not shed blood for the survival of the nation? We have now made a resolution to die, vowing to live and die with you and to coexist with the Northeast. Please take care of yourself and fight to the end. Do not worry about us. We are all strong young people, full of enthusiasm, and determined to spare no effort. We are now leaving Shanghai at an accelerated pace, organizing along the way. If our compatriots across the country would go forward together voluntarily, how could a small Japanese nation be worth mentioning? In the telegram, with tears in our eyes, we do not know what to say.</p>
<p>内部組織</p>
<p>Internal Organization</p>
<p>The internal organization of the corps is divided into three levels: ordinary members, selected outstanding members as basic members, and further selected outstanding members as cadres. Special attention is paid to the training of all members' thoughts and actions. A military library has been established, and more than 20 books on China-Japan and Northeast China events have been purchased, and donations are being solicited from various bookstores. The corps' only major goal is to offer no resistance internally, but to kill the enemy and achieve results externally.</p>

Then, they will go to Guangzhou to raise funds and then take a ship back to Shanghai with the members recruited along the way, and then go north to join the corps to resist Japan and support Ma.</p>

<p>He Yingqin's Speech</p>
<p>He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, has been in Shanghai for several days on official business. Yesterday, he gave a speech to the press, saying, "I have come here to discuss the unity of our party with Mr. Wang and others, and to report to all circles in Shanghai on the recent truth about the central government's diplomacy with Japan, in order to dispel the doubts of the recent rumors." He also said, "At this time of national crisis, we must unite as one from top to bottom, align our steps, and do our best in our respective duties to support the government. We must not be misled by rumors or schemes by others, and turn to internal disputes when foreign troubles are pressing, making the government's diplomacy more difficult." He also said: "The various groups and students in Shanghai are enthusiastic patriots, and most of them can abide by discipline and order. I have observed this and I am very impressed. Regarding the various strategies for saving the country, I have gathered ideas from all sides. If people from all walks of life and students have brilliant ideas, they should submit them to the government in writing. If they are beneficial to the country and the nation, the government will certainly adopt them as much as possible. It seems unnecessary to gather for petitions, sacrificing precious time and studies, and allowing our enemies to laugh at us. Moreover, transportation is inconvenient at present, and it takes time for the masses to petition back and forth, and it is difficult to travel, causing unnecessary disturbances. In case of temporary emotional excitement, it is not what patriots would want to see. Therefore, I believe that the student petitions to Beijing from various places should be especially cautious. It is best for everyone to cultivate their spirit, concentrate their strength, and do more practical work to save the country, and automatically stop this kind of petition method."</p>

<p>Feng Yixian and Others Deny Distributing Leaflets</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan Unwilling to Testify in Court</p>
<p>Zhu Yingpeng States Many Leaflets Were Distributed</p>
<p>Judge Rules Procedures Must First Be Clarified</p>
<p>Hou Dachun filed a lawsuit in the District Court against Feng Yixian, Feng Xiancheng, Wen Ren'an, and others for defamation. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, Judge Zhao Yongzhou presided over the first hearing in courtroom one. Hou Dachun was represented by lawyers Song Yunhui and Zhang Yuanmei. The judge began by questioning:</p>
<p>Hou Dachun testified: "I am 27 years old, from Tianchang County, Anhui Province, residing at 13 Tianji Lane, Baoshan Road. I am currently an executive member of the Municipal Party Headquarters." (Question:) "Why are you suing Feng Yixian and others?" (Answer:) "For distributing leaflets and damaging my reputation." (Question:) "What did the leaflets say?" (Answer:) "One type attacked my private morals, and another said I embezzled donations from the Anti-Japanese Association." (Question:) "How much was the donation?" (Answer:) "Five hundred yuan." (Question:) "Are you suing about that part?" (Answer:) "It is currently under investigation by the prosecutor. I will speak further when there is a result. The current lawsuit concerns private morals, saying I receive a large salary from the Commercial Press each month and do not work. However, I serve as a union committee member and have conditions with the capitalists, so I do not need to work at the company. Many committee members are the same. It also claims I obtained the position of labor committee member through improper connections, but this position is voluntary and I was invited to take it. It also says I am the principal of Peide Elementary School, which is located in the Yangshupu labor area. I was appointed by the Education Bureau because I was handling labor education. These points completely damage my reputation and private morals. Also, I was elected as a representative to the National Assembly. Shanghai produced five representatives, and I am a legitimately elected worker representative. They said it was mostly for my own personal benefit, which not only insults me but also insults all the Shanghai representatives. They also said that I requested to be a member of the Anti-Japanese Association from the Municipal Party Headquarters, which is also untrue. You can investigate the original members of the Anti-Japanese Association at the Party Headquarters. Eight people were elected from within the Party, and Tao Baichuan and I were both elected. However, the Party Headquarters feared that this would be used as an excuse, so they placed me in the worker's area and Tao Baichuan in the education area. This was a decision of the Municipal Party Headquarters and cannot be changed at will. They are not only attacking me but also the entire Municipal Party Headquarters." (Question:) "Do you have evidence?" (Answer:) "Yes, I have the leaflets, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan and Mr. Zhu Yingpeng said that Feng Yixian and the other three went to the Shen Bao newspaper office to distribute them. Mr. Zhu is an editor, and there was a conflict at the time." (Question:) "What does Feng Yixian do?" (Answer:) "He is the executive committee member of the Sixth District and the secretary of the Anti-Japanese Association. Feng Xiancheng and Wen Ren'an are both executive committee members of the Sixth District." (Question:) "You are mostly people from the Party Headquarters. Should this have been handled by the Party Headquarters first?" (Answer:) "He damaged my reputation, and for the sake of restoring it, I request the court to handle it." (Question:) "Regardless, you should have handled it through the Party Headquarters first. You should have come here only if that was not resolved." (Answer:) "The Central Committee has issued an order that if a Party member commits a crime, the court and the Party can handle it separately, so there is no conflict. Therefore, I request that the judge handle it first, and then the Party Headquarters can handle it with disciplinary action." (Question:) "Then there will be double punishment?" (Answer:) "Party members are subject to double punishment for committing crimes." (Question:) "What is the basis for this?" (Answer:) "The 106th Standing Committee meeting resolved this based on a motion from the Third National Congress." (Question:) "This court now requests the Party to handle it first to avoid contradictions." (Answer:) "There is a precedence for the sequence in which Party members who commit crimes are administratively punished by the judiciary and the Party Headquarters." (Question:) "Today, Pan Gongzhan sent a letter saying he is unwilling to testify in court." (Answer:) "Testifying is a legal obligation. Zhu Yingpeng said they took two or three hundred leaflets to the newspaper office's typesetting room and distributed them." (Question:) "The leaflets were about embezzling donations and also included a few other remarks?" (Answer:) "Yes." (Question:) "Was the embezzlement case referred by the Party Headquarters?" (Answer:) "Feng Yixian reported it. The Municipal Party Headquarters also handed it over to the court for investigation." (Question:) "These cases are related?" (Answer:) "The defamation is completely about private morals, while the embezzlement part is slanderous." (Question:) "These are related. We must decide that case first to avoid any potential complications." (Answer:) "They are completely separate. That case is only about whether or not there was embezzlement, while this is about damaging private morals." (Question:)</p>
<p>Feng Yixian testified: "I am 34 years old, from Wujiang, and an executive committee member of the Sixth District Party Headquarters, Baoshan Road." (Question:) "Do you know that Hou Dachun is suing you?" (Answer:) "I know. I have three kinds of proof. The defendant went to the Shen Bao at 9:00 PM on the 20th to submit the original document to the Central Committee. Previously, Feng Xiancheng and others advised me not to publish it in the newspaper for the sake of appearances. Later, Hou Dachun actually returned 500 yuan to Wang Yunwu and received a written reply from Wang Yunwu. Because he was trying to destroy the evidence, I sent it to be published. I have receipts from various newspaper offices as proof. I do not know about the leaflets. I also received the mailed leaflets. We asked for it to be published in the newspaper and approached the local editor. Pan Gongzhan is not a newspaper employee, and Zhu Yingpeng is the editor of the local supplement. How could we have met and had a conflict?" (Question:) "What about this photograph?" (Answer:) "Because we obtained evidence of his embezzlement, the various Party Headquarters needed evidence, so we printed two or three dozen copies to distribute. I do not know if any were photocopied." (Question:)</p>
<p>Feng Xiancheng testified: "I am 30 years old, from Gaoyou, and a standing committee member of the Sixth District Party Headquarters." (Question:) "Did you report Hou Dachun for embezzlement?" (Answer:) "Feng Yixian reported it. The District Party Headquarters forwarded it to the Central Committee based on the report." (Question:) "Did you distribute the leaflets?" (Question:) "I know even less about the leaflets. What was published in the newspaper was Feng Yixian's original document. I initially advised him not to publish it because it would not look good. Later, I went to the Commercial Press to investigate and received a written reply from Wang Yunwu, so we obtained evidence. We did not have time to mimeograph it, so we used Feng Yixian's document and stamped it with the District seal as a form of responsibility." He also said that the leaflet was issued by the Shanghai Citizens' Anti-Japanese Propaganda Department, and Feng Yixian also reported this and took the photos. Looking at the evidence, it is very clear."</p>
<p>Feng Xiancheng also said: "On the day it was published in the newspaper, we went to the Shibao first and then to the Shen Bao last. Because Zhu Yingpeng and Hou were colleagues, we assumed that all newspapers would publish it, so the Shen Bao would have no objection. We also did not see Zhu Yingpeng, and it was already 12:00 AM. There could not have been a conflict between publishing the newspaper and Zhu." Wen Ren'an testified: "I am 37 years old, from Jiangdu, and an executive committee member of the Sixth District. Because Hou Dachun is a Municipal Executive Committee member, Feng Yixian reported him to the Central Committee and then asked the District Party Headquarters to report him and publish it in the newspaper. We advised him to stop. Finally, Hou Dachun received the news and wanted to destroy the evidence. However, according to the first article of the Party members' oath-breaking regulations, failure to report a crime makes one an accomplice. Therefore, we properly reported it based on our duties and forwarded it to the Central Committee. Moreover, Wang Yunwu had already donated the money and legally relinquished his rights. How could he return it, and how could Hou personally come forward instead of the association? Of course, this was not appropriate, so we quickly published the document in the newspaper. He said the defendant distributed leaflets, which I know nothing about. He also said that Central Order No. 6750 concerned internal Party matters, and ordinary criminal matters cannot be linked to Central Order No. 6750."</p>
<p>Zhu Yingpeng testified: "I am 36 years old, from Zhejiang, and an editor at Shen Bao and a Municipal Executive Committee member. When the defendants came, they asked to publish the document, but they distributed many leaflets. Mr. Pan Gongzhan and I both saw it." The judge then said that the case was suspended so that the procedures could be clarified and precedents could be checked before the court reopened. He then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Zhu Qinglan's Report on Disaster Inspection <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qinglan, along with Chief Inspector Liang Zhao, Chief Inspector Xi Dejiong, Chief Engineer Li Xie, Deputy Chairman Sir Simpson, and others, went from Shanghai to Beijing and the upper reaches of the river to inspect the disaster situation and the progress of work relief. This has already been reported in various newspapers. It is now reported that Mr. Zhu departed from Nanjing on the Ban'an steamship on the evening of the 3rd and arrived in Wuhu on the morning of the 4th. He immediately went ashore to inspect the second refugee camp and the porridge factory that was being set up. He then went to Shanghai with Wuhu District Commissioner Zhang, County Magistrate Yu, and many Zhenyou personnel to inspect the breaches in the Lugang Mapu Dike, the Fanchang Hanjing Baoda Dike, and the Huangsi Satantai Dike in Wuwei County. He returned to Wuhu at 5:00 PM and rested briefly. That evening, he took the original ship directly to Anqing. Sir Simpson, feeling ill, took the Ningshao steamship from Beijing directly to Hankou. General Zhu's party arrived in Jiujiang on the morning of the 7th and inspected three refugee camps. It is said that there are still more than 20,000 women, children, and elderly people. On the evening of the 7th, they changed to the Longhe steamship to Hankou and arrived in Hankou at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, temporarily residing at the committee's office to work. It is also reported that General Zhu Ziqiao and others sent a telegram to the committee, stating that the most urgent problem in the Wuhu area is the repair of the dikes, which is related to agriculture and food in the coming year. Although the central government is repairing the main dikes along the river, the dikes in the interior require significant work and funds. It will not be successful without the full effort of the local government and additional subsidies from the central government. There are more than 20,000 refugees in Jiujiang's refugee camps. Because the homes in the disaster area have been destroyed, it is difficult to send them back for the time being. Work relief is planned for adult male refugees, including road construction and dike restoration.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Sheng Ayou's Testimony in the Case of Pushing a Flower Merchant into the Water is Suspicious <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Origin of Three Gold Rings is Unclear</p>
<p>Conflicting and Evasive Statements</p>
<p>Cai Songxi from Zhuanqiao, a town in this county, previously reported to the French Concession Police that a merchant, Mr. Jia, came to the town to buy cotton with more than 4,000 yuan but failed. He then hired a boat to return home with the money, but he was pushed into the river by a gang led by the bandit Sheng Ayou and drowned. The money was stolen, and the authorities have been unable to apprehend them. They have now been spotted in the jurisdiction, requesting arrest and investigation. The head constable approved the request and ordered Detective No. 308 to arrest Sheng, who was found with 60 yuan in banknotes and three gold rings. He was then sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Ge Zhiqin opened the first criminal court for further interrogation. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that there were no suspicious points regarding the banknotes, but the three gold rings required further investigation and requested interrogation. The judge stated that the case had been referred to Zhuanqiao for investigation but had not yet received a reply. The informant then stated that the merchant had a briefcase that was now stored at the home of Director Zhou Lao'er. Sheng was interrogated and denied the robbery. He said that he had been in the opium business in 1925 and that he bought the briefcase. He was working at Zhou Masheng's place and had it stored at Zhou's place, now Zhou Lao'er's. Two of the gold rings were pawned to him for opium, and he bought the small one himself. When asked about the price and brand, he replied that he bought it in 1926, and he did not know the brand because he asked someone to buy it for him. The banknotes were borrowed to find business to do as collateral. When asked who he borrowed them from, he could not answer. Detective No. 308 also reported that when the defendant was arrested, he was asked what he did, and he said he sold peanuts. He refused to say where he lived and offered to give the detective the banknotes and gold rings, asking him to let him go. The court then ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled the interrogation. It was determined that one of the gold rings was from the Lao Qingyun brand, and the two large and small floral rings were from the Rifeng brand. Detectives investigated, but there were no such jewelry stores in Shanghai. The origins were clearly improper, and his testimony was evasive and ambiguous.</p>

<p>Zhang Xianjun, Zhang Xianming, and Ji Haikun from Tongzhou were arrested by the Huishan Police for being involved in a case where they, along with Ma A'er from Tongzhou (who has already been arrested and sentenced to death), robbed the home of Zhu Yangshan from Qingpu at 196 East Xihua Road at 1:00 AM on September 19, killing two women. They were arrested along with suspects Yang Duchu, Qu Hanming, and Li A'long from Tongzhou and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The police investigation determined that Yang, Qu, and Li had nothing to do with the case. Yesterday morning, the three were sent to Court No. 1, where police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the situation and requested their release. Judge Xiao Xiefen approved the request and ordered the release of the three defendants, Yang Duchu, Qu Hanming, and Li A'long.</p>

<p>Arrested in the French Concession</p>
<p>The Chinese and foreign detectives of the Jing'an Temple Police Station have successively arrested a large number of male and female bandits since the 2nd of this month, totaling 22 people, including Gao Xinfu, a Chinese detective No. 1986 from the Huishi Police Station. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in this newspaper several times. On the previous day, Gu Chen, the ninth defendant, named two more accomplices, Xue Lianghou and Liu Xue, from Anhui, who were also involved in the robbery at 897 McAn Street. Therefore, at 2:00 PM, Chief Detective Fan Defu, Detective Wang Yongjun, and others, along with detectives from the French Concession Police, went to 420 Yuqing Lane, West Zilaihuo Street, and arrested Xue and his wife. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the criminal court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation and stated that Gao Xinfu, the Chinese detective who was interrogated yesterday, also lived there, so he requested that the two defendants be detained and tried together. The two defendants stated that they did not know Gu Chen. After Judge Wu Tingqi verified the statements, he ordered the defendants to be detained and tried with Shan Yaonan and others on the 17th.</p>

<p>For Failing to Comply with the Court Order to Hand Over Property Deeds</p>
<p>Zhang Yexiu, the daughter-in-law of the late salt merchant Zhang Shaotang, filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against her husband's brother, Zhang Shiying, for embezzlement and breach of trust. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Because the defendant Zhang Shiying did not comply with the court order to hand over the private property he managed, the account books of the Yihexiang Salt Company, and the deeds of the houses and fields, the plaintiff requested a search warrant yesterday. The court bailiffs, along with the police and the plaintiff's lawyers Xu Bingcheng and Xu Fuki, and the defendant's lawyer Zhang Shizhao, went to Zhang Shiying's residence at 37 Jing'an Temple Road to conduct the search. However, Zhang Shiying was not there, so all the safes and desk drawers could not be opened because there were no keys. The bailiffs then ordered Wu Ruihua, the clerk of the Zhang residence, to be responsible for the safekeeping and not to open them without authorization. They will be opened when Zhang Shiying returns home, and the lawyers of both the plaintiff and the defendant will sign and seal them for assurance.</p>

There are still 20,000 sets of disaster relief clothing remaining, which have now been completed. Due to the limited factory space, they cannot be stored. Please send someone to collect the vouchers from the committee so that they can be delivered. The total cost of clothing materials and labor that your committee should pay is 162,000 yuan. After deducting the 130,000 yuan already received, there is a balance of 32,000 yuan. Please remit the payment to complete the procedures." The committee's monthly executive committee meeting is scheduled for November 11. A circular was sent to each executive committee member stating: "We hereby inform you that the fifth executive committee meeting will be held at the committee's office in Renji Hall, Yunnan Road, at 4:00 PM on Friday, November 11.

<p>At 6:00 PM the night before last, the Xinshunfa steamboat, operated by Wu Yufu, was sailing from the south end of the 16th Pier towards Pudong. When it was approaching the Yuanyi Wharf in Pudong, a Jiuru steamboat suddenly came from the south. The Xinshunfa immediately sounded its horn, instructing the Jiuru to sail to the right. The Xinshunfa itself turned north to avoid it. However, in the darkness, the Linghua Maru, a small steamboat of the Japanese company Shōsen Mitsui, was speeding from the north and crashed into the Xinshunfa's left side amidships. A large hole was immediately created, and the bulkheads cracked. The entire steamboat sank to the bottom of the river in less than a minute. Fortunately, the captain and five other sailors on board were rescued by boat and escaped danger. Afterwards, the Xinshunfa's captain, Jiang Heshang, reported the incident to the water police station. He also informed the shipowner to negotiate compensation for the loss of the entire steamboat with the Japanese steamboat company that caused the accident.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Housheng Cotton Mill Employees Sue for 180,000 in Bonuses <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Bei Runsheng and Others Accused of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Since the Housheng Cotton Mill was reorganized in 1926 and the Ziji was added, its business has flourished and generated annual profits. By the winter of last year, the factory was shut down due to losses, and all the factory employees were dismissed at the same time. Now, more than 100 employees of the Housheng Ziji Cotton Mill, believing that the directors of the mill, Bei Runsheng, Xue Gansheng, Fu Hongshui, Zhao Shuxiang, Zhang Lanping, Cheng Houkun, and the manager Li Dixian, have engaged in illegal embezzlement, have entrusted Jiang Zhonghe, Zhou Qichang, Xu Dianhuang, and Sun Kewei as their representatives. They have hired lawyers Tao Wuzhi and Huang Xiubo to file a criminal lawsuit against Bei Runsheng and the other six defendants in the First Special District Court for embezzlement. Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled opening of the trial. Except for Xue Gansheng and Fu Hongshui, who did not arrive, Bei Runsheng and the other five defendants appeared in court on time. Jiang Zhonghe and the other four plaintiffs then took turns to present their case, stating that according to the accumulated profits of the Housheng Ziji Cotton Mill over the years, all of the more than 100 employees should have received 180,000 yuan in bonuses. Bei Runsheng testified that the capital of the Housheng Ziji Cotton Mill was 1 million taels, with more than 20 shareholders, each share being 100 taels. He was a shareholder and director, owning two-tenths of the shares. In 1926 and 1927, it earned more than 110,000 taels, and in 1928 and 1929, it earned more than 140,000 taels. After deducting the depreciation of 50,000 taels each year, there were only tens of thousands of taels left. In the second half of 1929, there was a loss of more than 40,000 taels, so only more than 10,000 taels were left. The board of directors decided not to distribute bonuses. The 300,000 taels set aside were used to compensate the new company's shareholders when the factory was taken over, as a reserve fund, not as bonuses. Later, because the factory's capital was nominally 1 million taels, but only 700,000 taels were paid up at that time, the shareholders' meeting decided to use the 300,000 taels as capital to make up the 1 million taels. Judge Feng Shide verified the statements and questioned Bei, saying, "According to your statement, from 1926 to 1929, you earned more than 200,000 taels in total. After deducting the depreciation of 200,000 taels, there was still more than 40,000 taels left. Why were the employees not paid their share? You cannot use the losses in the second half of 1929 to offset the previous bonuses. Even if there was only a limited amount left, it should have been distributed, no matter how small." Bei replied that there was little left, and the public reserve fund had not yet been deducted. If the public reserve fund was deducted, there would be nothing left to distribute. Zhao Shuxiang testified that he owned 50 shares, Zhang Lanping testified that she owned 2% of the capital, Cheng Houkun said that he owned 50 shares, and Li Dixian said that he was the manager of the Housheng Factory. He then reported in detail the history of the factory. Because it was already late in the day, the case was postponed. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that the defendants be ordered to post bail, while the defendants' lawyers objected, saying that the defendants were all respectable businessmen and would not flee. Judge Feng then ordered the case to be postponed until the afternoon of the 24th for further questioning.</p>

<p>Raising Funds for Winter Relief...Soliciting Winter Clothing</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao, a member of the Flood Relief Committee for Various Provinces, hosted a banquet at the Jue Lin restaurant on the morning of the day before yesterday, inviting representatives from all sectors of Shanghai, the Civil Society, and the Anti-Japanese Association. Those who arrived included Xu Shiying, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Shi Liangcai, Wang Boqi, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Boyuan, Wu Yunzhai, Lu Jingshi, Xiang Songmao, Li Zuyu, He Jingzhi, Shao Lizi, and others, totaling about 100 people. Wu Zhihao reported on the tragic situation of the disaster-stricken provinces, stating that there were more than 70 million victims in need of relief. Currently, it is cold and freezing, and they are suffering from hunger and cold. If they are not provided with urgent relief, the strong will resort to desperate measures, and the old and weak will be left in ditches. This has a great impact on people's livelihoods and public security. Moreover, with the imminent arrival of spring, if the planting season is missed, there will be no harvest. The national economy and food supply are particularly concerning. Recently, while our country is suffering from floods, the violent Japanese have taken the opportunity to invade the Northeast and commit brutal atrocities, truly making them the scourge of mankind. Our people should focus on domestic livelihood and resist foreign aggression. However, if the people's lives cannot be sustained, the demands made to the outside world will not be fulfilled. Disaster relief and national salvation are mutually dependent. It is hoped that all sectors will support this cause and work together to overcome this national crisis. After the report, Zhang Zhijiang was introduced to speak on the opinions of disaster relief and national salvation. Then, Qu Wenliu, a member of the Flood Relief Committee, reported on the income of the flood relief donations and the amount of relief funds disbursed. Currently, winter relief is being personally supervised and distributed in the disaster area by Zhu Ziqiao and other relief committee members. However, since the Northeast Incident, the committee's relief funds have plummeted. The disaster area is so large, and the distributed relief funds are like a grain of rice in a granary. This is a cause for great anxiety. He hoped that the great philanthropists present would do their best to raise funds. Wang Pingnan, Zhang Yichen, Wang Hanliang, Hu Fengxiang, and representatives from various branches of the Civil Society were responsible for soliciting winter clothing. The fundraising methods were discussed with the publicity team for a long time and will be decided separately. The meeting ended after 1:00 AM.</p>

<p>The Gong Yongtai sailing vessel, recently loaded with a large batch of salted fish from Lushun, set sail for Shanghai to sell its goods. The day before yesterday afternoon, it had arrived off the coast of Chongming near the mouth of Wusong. The sea suddenly became foggy, making it difficult for the ships to navigate. They wanted to sail to the coast to anchor, but the shipowner, Tao Genbao, believed that it was not far from Wusong and instructed the crew to sail along the coast without anchoring. He would hire a tugboat to tow them into port when they arrived at Wusong, so as not to delay the date. After the crew informed the shipowner, they sailed as usual. However, the fog became thicker, and the helmsman could no longer distinguish the direction of travel. They had to find a port to anchor, but the shipowner refused and took the helm himself. Unexpectedly, they went off course, and with a bang, the ship collided with a reef on the coast. The bottom of the ship was shattered and stuck on the reef, gradually sinking. The crew immediately raised distress flags and sounded the gong for rescue. Unfortunately, it was getting dark, and there were few passing ships. It was not until about 10:00 PM that a coal ship that was leaving the port passed by and launched a sampan to rescue them. The crew was rescued onto the sampan and taken ashore. The ship then sailed away. The crew spent the night on the beach. In the morning, the shipowner inspected the crew and found that there were only 14 people. The whereabouts of the rest of the crew were unknown. It is believed that they fell into the sea when the ship hit the reef, or they were pushed into the water when rushing to board the rescue sampan. Yesterday, the shipowner came to Shanghai to report the cargo and hired a boat to go and unload the cargo and tow the ship to safety. It is said that if the ship can be salvaged, the losses will be slightly less.</p>

<p>Argument stemmed from two-dollar liquor fee. Police arrive to detain and investigate.</p>
<p>Jin Longyun, a Yangzhou native residing at 31 Baohua Lane, Baoxing Road, Zhabei, returned to his hometown due to family matters. On the 3rd of this month, he and his family arrived in Shanghai from Zhenjiang aboard a Yangtze River steamer. After the ship docked at the Wayside Wharf, he hired a carriage driven by Zhu Asi and Guo Ada, both from Zhenjiang, to take them to their home in Zhabei. He paid the agreed-upon fare of over twenty yuan in full. However, Zhu and Guo forcibly demanded an additional two yuan for liquor, which Jin refused to pay, causing them to harbor resentment. Yesterday morning, when Jin was seeing his younger brother off at the Wayside Wharf to return home by steamer, Zhu and Guo spotted him and seized him, falsely claiming that the carriage fare had not been fully paid. They demanded an additional ten yuan, leading to an argument and preventing Jin from boarding the steamer. The police were called to the scene and took Zhu and Guo into custody, along with Jin, and brought them to the Wayside Police Station for detention and investigation.</p>

Police chief Mao Yiwen, detectives Bao Shuji, Liu Decheng, Yang Zhaoqing, and detective Zhang Desheng, equipped themselves with weapons and disguised as workers. They rushed to the vicinity of the lane entrance to ambush. After a while, Wang Changbao from Changzhou and Xu Wenbin from Ningbo, also disguised as carpenters, slowly entered the lane, carrying a leather bag of carpentry tools on their backs. The detectives stopped and questioned them, but their answers were evasive. Upon searching the leather bag carried by the thief Xu, they found two handguns and thirteen bullets. They were immediately arrested. Other detectives continued to capture three accomplices at the entrance of the alley, Cao De'en from Tongzhou, Yu Ande from Ningbo, and Lü Amao from Jiangyin. Afterwards, they went to a house at 1039 Pingliang Road and arrested six more people from Ningbo: Shi Zhouwen, Shi Afu, Zhu Alin, Chen Genfa, and two women, Chen Shi and Yu Fang. In total, eleven male and female bandits were captured and taken to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. According to the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the case was complex and required further investigation. Following a report by Chinese and foreign detectives about the circumstances, the handguns and leather bags were presented for inspection. Judge Xiao Xiephan questioned the defendants, but their answers were evasive. He ordered that they remain in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Jingqi Store Swindled <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Tao Qi, a local resident, runs the Jingqi Store on Jiaozhou Road, opposite Datong University in West Shanghai. His business is doing well. Previously, he was defrauded of over a hundred yuan's worth of goods by a neighboring hospital-owning couple. Unfortunately, misfortune never comes singly. Recently, Li Kesheng, the owner of the neighboring Yadong Shoe Store, told him that his store's shoes were stylish, durable, and popular, with nearby students rushing to buy them, leaving him unable to keep up with demand. He intended to open another branch but lacked a suitable location. He asked if Lao Yuan (Tao) would be willing to act as a sales agent, earning two yuan profit for each pair sold. Tao saw the potential for profit and agreed to act as a sales agent. Li then told Tao that he had a chance to buy cheap materials but was short of funds. He asked to borrow a few hundred yuan temporarily, promising to deliver the finished products to Tao's store for sale as soon as he bought the materials. Tao was reluctant to lend such a large sum, but Li claimed that two or three hundred yuan would suffice. Tao, trusting his neighbor, generously lent him the money. However, Li has not been seen for several days. When Tao went to the store to demand the money back, he was repeatedly turned away by the store's employees. After ten days, Li still has not appeared. Tao realized he had been swindled and went to the store yesterday to take some of the shoes as collateral, but the store had already emptied its inventory overnight and the owner had disappeared without a trace. Tao reported the incident to the local police station, requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Tax Reduction for Disaster Areas</p>
<p>Collection Begins December 16</p>
<p>This year, various rural areas of the city have suffered repeated floods, leading to reduced harvests for farmers. In order to alleviate the people's hardship, the Municipal Government has instructed the Land Bureau to work with the Finance and Social Affairs Bureaus to dispatch personnel for investigation and determine the appropriate tax reductions for this year's busy season. It has been reported that the tax reduction percentages for each district are as follows: Yin Hang, Zhenru, Pu Song, and Fahua districts will have a 30% reduction on the busy season tax and all related surcharges. The Lu Ke land of Zuohai Company and Yinsa in Yinhang District will have a 30% reduction on the Lu Ke tax and all related surcharges. Wusong, Gaoqiao, Jiangwan, Pengpu, Caojing, and Yinxiang districts will have a 20% reduction on the busy season tax and all related surcharges. Gaoxing, Lihang, Yangsi, Tangqiao, and Yangjing districts will have a 10% reduction on the busy season tax and all related surcharges. However, the busy season silver tax was collected before the reductions could be calculated. It has now been decided that the reductions will be applied to the shortfall in the 21st year. For this winter season's tax, the South Shanghai and Zhabei districts will be charged the full amount, while the remaining districts will have their grain certificates stamped. All taxes, surcharges, handling fees, and municipal expenses levied per mu stated on the certificate will be reduced according to the above percentages. It is reported that the Land Bureau has scheduled the tax collection to begin on December 16th. The deadline for payment is within two months of the collection start date. A surcharge of 20% will be added for payments made after the deadline. An additional 10% surcharge will be added for payments made after another two months, as a penalty for late payment. In addition, Lu Ke tax, garrison rent, Jinshan Bangjin shipping tax, and other land taxes, which are traditionally collected on the same day as the winter tax, must also be paid within two months. Late payments will be subject to surcharges as well. The Bureau has submitted all relevant information to the Municipal Government and issued a public notice to inform all residents.</p>

<p>Since receiving a renovation notice from Dehe Foreign Firm on September 30th of this year, the Chinese residents of Gong'an Lane, Hansbury Road, Wusong Road, immediately convened an emergency meeting of all eighty-plus households at the United Association on the road. Cao Chengde, Zhang Ruifu, Yang Yangqing, Yang Zhongshan, Zhang Yaoqing, Feng Fuqing, Tang Jinpu, Wang Rongchang, Xu Tao, Chen Yongfeng, He Bingcheng, Shao Baoshan, Chen Guorui, and thirteen others were elected as members of the residents' committee, with Cao Chengde as chairman and Zhang Ruifu as vice-chairman. The residents signed letters of authorization. The next day, the committee members went directly to Dehe Foreign Firm to negotiate a withdrawal of the demolition order, but they were repeatedly refused. Therefore, the public decided to entrust lawyers Wei Wenhan and Yuan Jirong to publish a notice opposing the renovation and to send a letter to the firm stating that the houses in the lane were less than four years old and did not need renovation. They opposed the forced relocation and demolition. After repeated negotiations, Dehe Foreign Firm agreed not to renovate for the time being and not to raise rents, but there was no formal written reply. The matter is still ongoing. On one hand, the residents have notified all households to deposit the rents that Dehe Foreign Firm has intentionally accumulated since the first of this month into a bank account under the name of "Gong'an Lane Chinese Residents Rent Safekeeping Committee." On the other hand, they have appealed to Dehe Foreign Firm to consider the hardships faced by businesses and residents due to the recent internal disasters and external troubles, hoping that the previously issued notices will be rescinded and that the accumulated rents will be collected.</p>

<h3 id="e143">News from Municipal Association District Branches <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>26th District The 26th District Branch of the Municipal Association sent a telegram yesterday stating that the national crisis is urgent and imminent. The issue of national salvation requires careful consideration. The brutality of the Japanese invaders is infuriating, and it is regrettable that we cannot immediately crush the three islands. It is believed that there are two aspects to saving the nation: calmness and bravery. Calmness involves seeking justice through diplomacy, while bravery involves fighting Japan to the death. Therefore, resolving the national crisis requires the combined efforts of all. Powerful groups should unite with other groups to organize a people's national salvation representative conference, based on democratic principles, to discuss two crucial issues. First, diplomacy should adopt a people's diplomacy approach, advising the government and sending representatives to attend government meetings. The issues to be addressed should be discussed openly, incorporating public opinion and ensuring cooperation between the government and the people. This will enhance diplomacy and prevent inconsistencies. The government and the people should understand military secrets in order to respond to national disasters and prevent chaos in the rear. In short, the national government is the people's government, and the people should have a say in all measures. It is hoped that the people will unite and work together to save the nation.</p>
<p>32nd District The 32nd District Branch of the Special District Citizens' Association convened a meeting of all committee members the day before yesterday. Over ten executive committee members attended, with Zhu Zhuxian as chairman. The agenda included reports (omitted) and discussions. (1) A letter from Xu Hanzhang resigning from the position of alternate executive committee member was discussed. It was decided to retain him and send committee member Cai Qiaojun to persuade him to stay. (2) In order to unite the people's strength and recruit new members to expand the organization, it was decided that the organization department and the secretariat should prepare a declaration and recruit members with the help of nearby committee members. (3) A report stated that Gu Weijun had just become Minister of Foreign Affairs and was considering direct negotiations with Japan, designating Jinzhou as a neutral zone, and jointly administering Tianjin. News of this spread, and people across the country rose up in protest, sending numerous telegrams and letters. It was decided to telegraph the League of Nations representative to argue strongly and telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to correct the situation. (4) Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province fought bravely against the Japanese, and although his ambitions were not yet realized and he was forced to retreat, he should be rewarded to boost morale. It was decided to send a telegram to Chairman Ma praising his fearless spirit and urging him to seize the opportunity to fight back. (5) Given the arrogance of the Japanese, it was decided to call for economic severance with Japan as a further diplomatic measure. The merchants of the district were notified to sever economic ties with Japan forever and not to buy enemy goods. The meeting adjourned after discussing other important issues.</p>

<p>6th District Cotton Weaving Industry Union Yesterday, two telegrams were sent, one urging Chairman Chiang to go north and the other consoling General Ma Zhanshan. Excerpts are as follows: (Telegram 1) The Japanese bandits are invading our borders more and more each day. They have already occupied Liaoning and Jilin, and now they have seized Heilongjiang. Recently, we heard that they are attacking Jinzhou, creating a tense situation. Furthermore, their bombing of Tianjin is a continuing aggression. Every patriotic son of China feels the pain. It is imperative that Your Excellency personally lead the campaign without delay. People from all walks of life are flocking to Beijing to petition, making it impossible to count them all. Please leave immediately and move to the border to recover lost territory. Although General Heima is fighting alone, without assistance, and is running out of supplies, he does not retreat. When Your Excellency's banner of justice is raised, the whole country will follow suit and annihilate the Japanese at dawn. Is this not the time to draw our bows in the snow and let the barbarian chieftains flee in the night? We hope that the military flag will soon be raised in the suburbs to fulfill the nation's hope. (Telegram 2) The Japanese bandits are brutal and are nibbling away at our borders. All their acts of aggression are infuriating. The General, unwilling to see our country fragmented, led a small force like Shao Kang to fight for the Northeast. Although the outcome is uncertain, the right and wrong will be judged in history. We hope that you will maintain your unwavering determination to continue your struggle and restore our country and our nation. In the future, your name will be celebrated in history, and you will surpass Qi Jiguang and Ma Fubo. We send this telegram to offer our condolences and wish you well.</p>

It was decided to send Li Chengzhang to collect the fees.

It was decided to appoint Gao Depei as the representative.</p>

<h3 id="e145">A Certain Gentleman in the Pawnshop Industry (Advocates Mutual Inspection of Goods by Various Industries to Prevent Collusion) <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese bandits are running rampant, and the entire country is filled with indignation. Various industries in Shanghai have spontaneously organized anti-Japanese economic severance associations, which is commendable. Economic severance is indeed the only way to resist Japan and save the nation, and it is a duty that our people must fulfill. However, those who organize the inspections are all leaders of the same industry, who may be swayed by personal feelings and deliberately let go of enemy goods. They appear to be inspecting enemy goods but are actually protecting unscrupulous merchants. It is truly lamentable that their moral depravity has reached such a point. Take the pawnshop industry as an example. Most of the directors of the association are managers (as in other industries). Since the organization was established almost two months ago, no inspectors have been seen inspecting the pawnshops. To deceive the public, they printed hundreds of inspection forms, distributed them to the pawnshops, and asked them to voluntarily declare whether they had ever pawned enemy goods. Then, the association issued a single clearance certificate, which was prominently displayed on the door or counter of the pawnshop. The inspectors considered that they had fulfilled their duty. Alas, at this time of national crisis, when every citizen has a responsibility, all of our people should rise up and save the nation. I hope that the officials in charge of the anti-Japanese associations will pay special attention, handle matters seriously, and not be lenient in the slightest. The best approach would be for all industries, regardless of which industry they belong to, to send members to join the inspections with supervisory powers. Alternatively, the anti-Japanese association should conduct monthly or bi-monthly investigations of various industries in different districts. If any concealment is discovered, the inspectors who fail to fulfill their duties should be severely punished. This will ensure that everyone adheres to their duties and that unscrupulous merchants are made aware of the consequences.</p>

<p>-- Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Couplets are found in Chinese literature, popularly known as "matching couplets." The best ones are marvelously natural and fascinating. For example, "Wula cloth" matched with "red embroidered shoes" is widely acclaimed. Even the mediocre Wula cloth person is remembered through this matching. There are those couplets that cannot be matched, popularly known as absolute couplets. For example, I once offered the four characters "Red Flower Red Flower". "Red Flower" is a medicinal herb, "Flower Red" is a fruit. In essence, it is the "flower of the red-colored Flower Red". In twenty years, no one has responded, thus it has become an absolute couplet. An absolute couplet is like a talented and beautiful maiden, seeking a mate in good time, but alas, a suitable match cannot be found. Surely this is regrettable. I recently offered the two characters "Black Horse". In essence, it is a black-colored horse. In reality, it is a shorthand reference to General Ma of Heilongjiang. In recent reports, "Black Horse Black Horse" has become a kind of noun. After thinking for ten days, I still cannot find a match. Is it an absolute couplet? I earnestly request my colleagues to ponder this and try to find a suitable mate. Send it quickly to this publication and spread it far and wide. It is like adding whiskers to the face of General Ma, giving him more luster. It is precisely to praise his loyalty and courage. I hope you will not slight it with the small wisdom of a scholar.</p>

<p>Four hundred young people from Shanghai have voluntarily organized a corps to aid Ma Zhanshan in resisting the Japanese. They departed northward on the 5th to put their support into action. Only young people who say what they mean and do what they say are truly Chinese! Shouldn't we, who hide at home living comfortably, feel ashamed?"</p>
<p>"While you and I may think this way, it's not going to be easy for them to achieve their goal! On the night of the 5th, the Jinghu Railway Station wouldn't let them board the train, so they slept on the tracks all night and set off on foot the next day. On the 6th, the newspaper reported that the government had sent a telegram to stop them from advancing. Did you know that?"</p>
<p>"Really? Why would the government stop them from advancing?"</p>
<p>"It's said that it's because they haven't received rigorous military training. The government doesn't want to send untrained civilians into battle."</p>
<p>"What is 'political tutelage' supposed to teach? What is the Training Directorate doing? There are plenty of military officers, so why not train them? Why not let Chairman Ma train them on the battlefield?"</p>
<p>"Heilongjiang is now covered in ice and snow; wearing a fur robe is like wearing a summer cloth gown. This time, nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers have had their ears, noses, and fingers frostbitten and fall off. It's not wise for us southerners to go lightly. The government says they don't have cold-weather military uniforms, so it's inconvenient to let them go to make a pointless sacrifice."</p>
<p>"The north is severely cold, as you say. I've also been to Mongolia in the winter. As long as you have a thick sheepskin hat, gloves, clothes, and boots, you can cope. If your nose, ears, or fingers get frostbitten, don't touch them; let the blood vessels slowly warm back up, and it won't be a problem. There's plenty of thick sheepskin outside the Great Wall; how can they not even give them this bit of cold-weather military uniform?"</p>
<p>"It's said that there's another difficulty. To get to Heilongjiang by water, you have to pass through Russian territory, and passports are not easy to obtain. The railways are all occupied by the Japanese army, and the land route takes more than a month to travel."</p>
<p>"If our parents were besieged by robbers, could we stand by and do nothing because the road is long? Not to mention more than a month, even if it took a year and a half, we'd have to rush to them!"</p>
<p>"Stepping back, if they can't go to Heilongjiang, Jinzhou is in a state of crisis. Why can't they be allowed to go to Jinzhou? Obstinately preventing them is never a good policy."</p>
<p>"The government must use the strength of the people as its own strength to overcome great difficulties and accomplish great things. At this critical moment of national survival, I fear the people are living in a dream. Now that these four hundred young people have the determination to die, if they can be given effective training and necessary equipment, they can unleash great power. They will be on par with the three hundred Spartans and the five hundred righteous followers of Tian Heng. If the government cannot accommodate and unleash this precious force, it's truly regrettable. "That's right! The people's power of resolve is the greatest power in the world; a government that can accommodate, guide, unleash, and magnify this power is a highly capable government, an omnipotent government."</p>
<h3 id="e150">Lament for General Li Jinglin <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Yan</p>
<p>General Li Jinglin, former director of the Central Martial Arts Academy, passed away from illness at Jimen on the evening of the 3rd of this month. The weather is cold and desolate. A veteran has departed. The sad news has arrived. How can one not grieve?</p>
<p>Li was a key member of the New Feng Army faction (also known as the University faction), along with Deputy Commander Zhang and Guo Songling. Ding Chao and Ji Qingzhong belonged to it. When Li was appointed Military Governor of Zhili due to his merits in the Battle of Yuguan, Guo Songling launched a rebellion against the old faction in power, inviting Li to join and saying that it was a good time to avenge grievances. However, Li was ultimately unmoved, demonstrating a private morality that was beyond that of typical overbearing warlords.</p>
<p>In recent years, Li spared no effort in promoting martial arts. Whenever martial arts competitions were held, he generously compensated the strong men who died or became disabled as a result of the competition. His ancient chivalrous heart moved not only the beneficiaries to tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>Although Li repeatedly held important positions, he was always honest and did not engage in extortion. Therefore, his passing left his family in dire straits. However, Li has many sons, all intelligent and studious. His eldest and second sons have both studied military science abroad. His eldest son has now completed his studies and returned to China, and his second son is also about to graduate. They will carry on his legacy and fulfill Li's unfinished ambitions.</p>
<p>It is said that Li was only forty-seven years old this year. Given his usually strong physique and his mastery of martial arts, it was hoped that he would live a long life. Yet, he suddenly passed away from dysentery. Alas!</p>

<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>The Tianyi Film Company's second sound film, "The Last Love," was screened at the New Light Theater the other day. Members of the press and film industry were invited to watch. The lighting was adequate, and the sound was clear. The plot tells the story of Li Gengxin</p>
<p>(played by Zhang Zhenduo), who is from a farming family. Young and handsome, he is skilled in soccer. He always wins championships in soccer matches and is hailed as a soccer star by the whole school. A classmate, Miss Liang Xiaofen (played by Xuan Jinglin), admires Gengxin's soccer skills and gives him flowers. Another female student, Wang Jingfang (played by Yang Naimei), who loves music, also admires Gengxin and becomes engaged to him. However, Jingfang is fickle and abandons Gengxin when she learns of his poverty, choosing to be with the wealthy Jin Zhongfu (played by Ge Furong). Gengxin is depressed. His friend Zhou Jiqun (played by Xiao Zhengzhong) tries to comfort him and takes him to the Chunjiang Grand Theater to see a play. Xiaofen and Su Renqiu (played by Chen Yumei) sing a duet, "Five Flower Cave." Gengxin is captivated by her beautiful voice and feels that she looks familiar. He finds out Xiaofen's address and visits her, using 800 yuan of public funds to redeem Xiaofen's freedom. A few days later, the court arrests Gengxin, who experiences the hardships of prison and is sentenced to three months in jail. After serving his sentence, Gengxin wanders the streets and suddenly sees Xiaofen holding a basket and buying vegetables. He follows her home, and they talk about the past. Xiaofen takes out 800 yuan in banknotes from under her pillow and returns them to Gengxin. They later marry. Zi Luolan, a famous Cantonese opera singer, also plays Mulan joining the army in the film, dancing with swords and singing, adding to the splendor of the film.</p>
<h3 id="e152">After Seeing the "Manchuria-Mongolia Exhibition" <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Shou</p>
<p>The Manchuria-Mongolia Exhibition is being held at the Shirokiya (Note 1) department store on the fifth floor from November 28th to the 11th of next month. Supported by the Ministry of the Army." This is the recent advertisement in the newspaper.</p>
<p>After three or two days of continuous rain, the Tokyo weather has become much colder. I traveled a long way from the countryside to the city. I got off the bus in front of the towering Shirokiya building.</p>
<p>The Shirokiya advertisement windows were crowded with people. I slowly squeezed closer, craning my neck to take a look. The first window contained "several wax figures. One was wearing a military uniform with crossed leather belts. One was wearing a red short shirt and pants, with a queue on his head." The explanatory sign next to it read, "1. Current Chinese military uniform. 1. Chinese military uniform during the Sino-Japanese War." The second window contained "a snowy scene. Flames of war were raging all around. Several Japanese soldiers were preparing for battle in the cold." Needless to say, the former implied the insignificance of the current Chinese army. Otherwise, why would they specifically use the Qing Dynasty military uniform, instead of the Ming Dynasty military uniform, which had no connection with Japan, to complement the current military uniform? As for the latter, it was of course symbolizing the achievements of the Japanese soldiers. I shortened my line of sight and steadied myself. I hurriedly lowered my head and rushed into the gate. At that time, I really had no courage to raise my head and compare the two windows.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered, there were three large instruments of death. The first was a sound detector, shaped like a scale. It was equipped with four large speakers. It was said that the enemy aircraft's sound could be heard from the speakers ten kilometers away. At the same time, the aircraft's altitude and position could be determined so that anti-aircraft guns could be prepared. The second was a thousand-kilogram dropped bomb, about eight feet long and three feet in diameter. The tail had four wings. If this bomb was dropped from an aircraft, it could penetrate the ground more than ten yards, leaving no tile or debris in the blast area. The third was the Type 4 aircraft. The aircraft was very small and could only accommodate one person. The aircraft of this type is currently running rampant in the skies over Northeast China.</p>
<p>After seeing the first floor, I ran up to the fifth floor in one breath.</p>
<p>The fifth floor was the main exhibition hall. At the entrance of the exhibition hall, there were many satirical paintings. Below the satirical paintings were many photos. These included photos of the chaotic situation at the Beida Camp, photos of the corpses of Chinese soldiers, and photos of the Shenyang arsenal. Sadly, the essence of the Northeast for decades was only left with these few remnants.</p>
<p>The second part of the exhibition was Japanese war trophies. This included mortars and machine guns made by the Northeast arsenal, military swords, and the regimental flag of the 619th Regiment. And then... finally, there was the Blue Sky White Sun flag. I couldn't bear to look at these things in detail. If I wanted to see them, there were many more in the Yushukan Museum (Note 2) in Kudan.</p>
<p>The third part was the bloodstained hats and clothes of Japanese soldiers who died in battle. The visitors were all taking off their hats to show their respect.</p>
<p>The fourth part was Chinese anti-Japanese propaganda. The viewers were all carefully looking at each piece. At that moment, they seemed to have forgotten the Manchuria-Mongolia lecture flyers distributed throughout the streets of Tokyo, which said "Punish the violent China, punish the evil Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<p>The fifth part was an explanation of Japanese military equipment. The sixth part was the clumsy shop signs and utensils from the countryside of Northeast China. Perhaps they were trying to expose the "uncivilized" nature of "China." But what about the countryside of Japan itself?</p>
<p>At the exit of the exhibition hall was a "Manchuria-Mongolia Books" sales area. There were no fewer than a hundred types in total. At this point, I suddenly recalled the Chinese publishing industry. What else can I say?</p>
<p>I stepped out of Shirokiya in dismay. The sound of calls to collect donations for the "Manchuria Soldiers Welfare Fund" blew from the cold wind in bursts. The ringing of newspaper extras vibrated intermittently at the crossroads. "How about it? I plan to board the ship on the 5th." Unexpectedly, in the crowd at the tram stop, a friend greeted me.</p>
<p>"Ah." I was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>"In this situation, you're still not leaving?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily." I smiled wryly and stepped onto the tram. "Then I'll come to see you off first."</p>
<p>The tram moved. "See you at Tokyo Station." I waved to my friend in the twilight of early winter.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Shirokiya is one of the four major department stores in Tokyo.</p>
<p>(Note 2) The Yushukan Museum is in Kudan, Tokyo. It houses the damaged Chinese military equipment from the Sino-Japanese War.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Like Minds</p>
<p>Before this incident occurred, people with keen minds in S City had long been concerned that the people of the Sun Country might have to resort to aggressive military action without hesitation. Especially the students at this Patriotic University. In their spare time, they discussed it in groups of two or three. Among them was a student named Hua Naiqiang, who was strong, clear-headed, rational, brave, and full of patriotic thoughts. Originally from Nanjing, he had come to Guanwai with his parents when he was young because his father worked on the Chinese Eastern Railway. He loved martial arts from a young age, and his father specially hired a martial arts master to teach him boxing and staff fighting. He was also good at swordsmanship. He was also very intelligent in his studies. Later, his parents passed away one after another. He greatly admired the name of the Patriotic University, so he took the entrance exam and enrolled. Teachers and classmates found him handsome and pleasant, and they all praised him, saying that he was a most promising student. When he read the history of national humiliation, he often filled with anger. He especially opposed the aggressive policies of the Sun Country. He often said to his classmates, "If I were to hold military and political power in our country in the future, I would never be willing to make concessions in everything. I am determined to fight them to the death. Civil officials should not be greedy for money, and military officials should not be afraid of death. As long as everyone is willing to do this, what is there to fear from those clogs?" He also had a special skill: marksmanship. It could be said that he never missed. Not only was he accurate with the target, but one day he went hunting in the mountains with the principal, Xiong Feng, and several classmates. As they galloped along, a flock of geese happened to fly by. He raised the gun in his hand and fired three shots into the sky, bang, bang, bang. Three geese fell to the ground in response. All the classmates admired him. Xiong Feng also praised him to the skies. Once, the school held a national martial arts competition, and Hua Naiqiang won first place. Xiong Feng gave him a sharp, precious sword, saying, "Rouge is given to beautiful women, and precious swords are given to heroes. I give you this sword, hoping that you will also have the ambition to wield my hundred thousand sharpened swords and swear never to rest until the dwarfs are killed." Hua Naiqiang took the sword and replied, "One day, I will dedicate myself to the country and live up to the principal's expectations." Therefore, Hua Naiqiang could be said to be a good student in the school. Moreover, he could also fly airplanes. He often went out flying with Xiong Feng. Everyone also gave him a nickname, calling him Flying General. As for the female students, although there were not many, only a few dozen, there was also an outstanding one among them. Her surname was Peng and her name was Zhongshu. She was twenty-nine years old. She was both graceful and robust, possessing both qualities. She was in the same grade as Hua Naiqiang. She also liked to ride horses and fence. She often wore military uniform and rode a steed, like Mulan the Second. Her father's name was Mei Guo. He was a garrison commander in T City, boasting of his troops. He was stubborn and did not abandon the bad habits of warlords. He had feudal ideas. Therefore, although Peng Mei Guo was very fond of his daughter, Zhongshu could understand the greater good through her studies. What she opposed most was warlords. Of course, she was also dissatisfied with her father. Sometimes she would take the opportunity to satirize him a few words. Mei Guo could not be awakened and instead said, "How can a young woman know about national affairs?"</p>

<h3 id="e154">Chaotic State of Financial Silver Bar Gold <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Morning Decline, Afternoon Rise, Continued Excellence in the End. Yesterday's silver bar gold situation was still extremely chaotic. It was not unusual for there to be rises and falls of several taels in the morning and afternoon. There were a total of sixteen or seventeen taels in the morning market. Large households, Guangbang, etc. came in and out again, and people's hearts were exceptionally flustered. From the beginning of the low opening, it was almost contrary to the silver market trend. The British rose and the Americans fell, especially because Lin Neiyan, a shareholder of the Hengxing Gold Company, was kidnapped by bandits the night before. His colleagues were still afraid that the company would close its long positions, so speculators sold off in advance. Afterwards, Yuan Maoyong and others did sell on their behalf, causing the price to fall within six hundred and ninety taels. Unexpectedly, stimulated by this incident, foreign exchange rebounded from loose to tight, and the listed price was even reduced by one level. Furthermore, Hengxing bought back, and various firms competed to enter, and the market suddenly showed a sharp rise, breaking through the seven hundred tael mark. The market wave was slightly calmer in the afternoon, with a slight fluctuation, hovering around seven hundred taels. Furthermore, it was Wednesday, and there was a lack of market for drafts, so the overall increase was more than four taels.</p>
<p>Early Low Opening, Fluctuations Afterwards. Since the early opening of six hundred and ninety-three taels and five qian, it fell by three taels and eight qian. This was because large silver bars repeatedly rose, accounting for an increase of sixteen and three-eighths. However, American silver fell by three-eighths, and private telegrams also fell by five-sixteenths. Furthermore, because the European market turned soft at the end, the United States sold again, and it was added to ninety-five and a half taels. Shortly afterwards, Yuan Maoyong sold a lot (it was a transfer account with Hengxingshengda), and Tong Chun, Yuan Chengyong, Fuchang, Yifeng, Yongda, Decheng, and someone Wu and others tended to sell. In addition, the recent inter-bank trading of American dollars was thirty-two yuan and six hundred and twenty-five, and the forward was thirty-two yuan and a half, causing the price of gold to immediately fall to eighty-eight and a half taels. At times, it returned to three taels, and immediately fell by two taels. When the British gold was listed, it did not change, and it was about ninety taels. However, the internal stability was still stable. HSBC absorbed the forward at eleven pence and eight hundred and seventy-five, and Mitsui absorbed the American dollar at thirty-two and a half yuan. However, major households such as Zhifeng Yongheng, Yu Yuan Maoyong, Cuichang Yongheng, Chang Yongfu, Tai Heng, Fuchang, Qian Changxiang, Heng Xingyifeng, Daxing Yong, etc. had a cloud of buying interest, and the price gradually rose, with a sharp increase of more than ten taels, with only one or two taels of return. Until about ten thirty, it had broken through seven hundred taels, reaching zero three and a half taels. At this time, the American dollar was only counted at thirty-two yuan and one hundred and twenty-five, and British gold rarely traded, and its price was even higher, because the exchange rate had suddenly returned to the high. Then it fell back by four taels, to six hundred and ninety-nine taels and three qian, because the goods came out, and in an instant, it was still sharp, and Yifeng Qian Changxiang Daxing Yong and others continued to make great progress. Furthermore, the American dollar was made by American and Japanese banks at thirty-two yuan, especially because the HSBC listed British gold and changed to reduce two and five, and the American dollar was also reduced by two and five, so at eleven o'clock, it reached zero five taels and five qian. Furthermore, the American dollar was made for March at thirty-two yuan and one hundred and twenty-five, and the wheat market issued zero six hundred and twenty-five, and the large Decheng Hong Kangyong and Dalian Gang and others sold out, and also many long positions that had already gained profits also came to spit out, so it fell sharply by more than five taels, and it became zero two taels and three taels. Bombay suddenly reported a large one and three annas, and at more than eleven fifty, it was only six hundred and ninety-nine taels and seven qian. Then, from seven hundred taels and zero zero five qian, the closing price was initially seven hundred and fifty-six taels, which was about sixty taels. At noon, it was changed to seven hundred and sixty-two taels, which was about fifty-seven eight to sixty taels and two three taels.</p>
<p>Wave Transition Stabilization, Slight Fluctuation. The market opened in the afternoon at seven hundred taels, followed by six hundred and ninety-nine taels and five qian. Then, it was bought by Yuan Maoyong Qian Changxiang and others, and the price went up. At more than two twenty, it was seven hundred zero three taels. Zhifeng Yong Dalian Gang came out, immediately retreating more than two taels, to seven hundred taels zero zero eight qian. Suddenly, it was heard that Bombay Electric Telegraph fell by ten annas, and various firms also dragged in, and at three o'clock, it was zero four taels. Afterwards, the situation gradually deteriorated, and Wanxing Shunli Dadecheng Taifeng Chengqianxiang and others all sold out, and the air was bad, and it plummeted more than six taels. However, from one quarter past three to four o'clock, there was a fluctuation of more than two taels. Then, it fell to ninety-seven taels and three qian. Afterwards, Bombay fell by two or three annas again. Hengxing and others bought in, and the price rose again to seven hundred taels. When the market closed at four thirty, it was seven hundred zero one taels and five qian. However, Zhifeng Yong and others sold out, and it was suppressed to seven hundred taels. Compared with the day before yesterday (according to the list price), it still rose by four taels and two qian. According to the daily maximum of seven hundred zero five taels and five qian, the minimum of six hundred and eighty-eight taels and five qian, there was a difference of seventeen taels. The early market price of goods was ninety-four taels, and the noon closing price was seven hundred taels zero zero five qian, and the afternoon price was ninety-nine taels qian, and the closing price was zero one taels and five qian. The listed price was about sixty-four taels, and the registration was ninety-seven taels to seven hundred zero one taels, and the replenishment water was ninety-seven taels, and in the afternoon it was ninety-eight taels, and the red bar was added by six taels.</p>
<p>The Transaction Is Huge and Difficult to Count. On the surface, the transaction is recalculated. Statistics show that Zhifeng Yong, Daxing Yong, Qian Changxiang, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengchang Yong, Yu Da, Futai Heng, Heng Yu, Yifeng, Yuan Xingyong, and Dakang all entered. Hengxing and Shengda bought more than one thousand three hundred and four hundred, but Yuan Maoyong issued three or four thousand. Dadecheng, Tong Taichang, Yuan Tai, Hong Kangyong, and Yuan Kangxiang, etc. suddenly came out and in. Yifeng Yong, Tong Chun, Wu Mou, and Yongfeng all came out. Yuan Chengyong and Fuchang came out first and then entered. Yuan Maoyong had ins and outs except for transfer accounts. The overall pull was still more than three hundred. In the afternoon, Qian Changxiang and Yuan Maoyong Zhifeng Yong had different ins and outs, and Heng Yu, Hengxing, and Tianfeng Yong entered, while Wanxing, Shunli, Hengchang Yong, and Futai Heng all exited. The Dalian Gang had a total of one thousand four hundred and five hundred, and the ins and outs were evened out. The Guangbang issued thousands of hundreds, and entered more than two thousand.</p>

<p>Market Overview: The exchange rate experienced fluctuations the day before yesterday, showing signs of weakness and fatigue. Public sentiment was relatively calm. However, yesterday, it suddenly rebounded. Although this was a fluctuating action, it ultimately indicated differing trends. Upon investigation, yesterday's money market did have the potential to rise, but ultimately, due to bank loans being made, the financial market seemed to ease. The foreign exchange rate also weakened due to decreased buying interest, resulting in uneven price drops.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Prices: (Foreign Exchange) The early morning exchange rate was 72.3875 cents, appearing better by 0.375 cents compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market continued to rise by 0.375 cents, reaching 72.425 cents. As a result, the two markets collectively rose by 0.75 cents. (Silver Exchange) The early morning rate was 19 cents, and the afternoon rate was 23 cents. The result was comparable to the previous day, but the trend was tighter. Bank quotes were around 10 cents, with an additional 8 cents for withdrawals with surcharges.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The early morning price for Jiangnan small silver coins was 64.725 cents, and the afternoon price was 64.7 cents, a further increase of 0.1 cents compared to the previous day's early morning market. The trading volume was 2,000 *jiao* in the morning and 5,000 *jiao* in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins remained the same in both morning and afternoon markets at 65.125 cents, a drop of 0.1 cents compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 85,000 *jiao* in the morning and 10,000 *jiao* in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at 378,500 *wen*.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver and Foreign Currency: (Silver) Yesterday's bank settlement news indicated that Chinese merchants settled over 2 million in drafts, foreign merchants settled 1.2 to 1.3 million in drafts, various goods, duties, and miscellaneous items settled 7.5 to 7.6 million, special items exceeded 1 million, warehouse withdrawals were 800,000, loan transactions exceeded 1 million, private money shops settled over 41 million, withdrawal surcharges settled over 3.6 million, remittances from various sources settled over 900,000, and cash receipts exceeded 1 million. (Foreign Currency) Drafts for remittances amounted to 1,215,000 in the morning market and 650,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 65,000 in the morning and 20,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange banknotes were 145,000 in the morning and 95,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions amounted to 500,000 for interbank transactions in the morning and 550,000 in the afternoon. Transactions between various bank accounts totaled over 1.4 million, banknote inflow and outflow totaled 1.56 million, private money shops settled over 4.7 million, withdrawal surcharges settled over 1.5 million, interbank foreign currency loans exceeded 1.1 million, small money shop transactions exceeded 400,000, and outside demand exceeded 300,000.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Stock and Bond Market Increasingly Desolate <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Prices Slightly Recover, Trend Remains Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw more activity in the spot market in the morning. However, in the afternoon, except for the 1996 Customs Bonds, all others opened lower. Inflow and outflow were quite active. The futures market was even more desolate than before. Investor sentiment was very subdued, with only sporadic trading in various bonds. The trend for each bond was as dull as before. There were no new developments in domestic and international situations. Most major investors were observing cautiously. Sellers were unwilling to sell large amounts at current low prices, while buyers were hesitant to make significant investments due to the lack of positive turning points in the diplomatic situation. Therefore, the market saw only sporadic transactions, with both supply and demand becoming more balanced. Bond prices became more balanced, fluctuating throughout the day without significant rises or falls, ultimately showing only slight changes compared to the previous day. Futures, except for the 1919 Good Bonds, which fell by more than 1.2 yuan, saw only small changes of about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Spot 1920 Bonds fell by 1.8 yuan, and 1926 and 1920 Customs Bonds fell by nearly 1 yuan. Spot Reorganization Bonds rose by 1 yuan, while others generally trended upward. The bond market's situation remained as chaotic as before, and its future trend will continue to depend on changes in the current situation. The total trading volume for spot transactions throughout the day was 46,000 yuan. Futures trading was approximately 1.4 million yuan in the morning and over 1.8 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 3,215,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Stagnation in Cotton Yarn and Cotton Market <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon, showing a flat and tired trend. This was likely due to the continuous military actions by the Japanese army and the increasing disturbances in Liaoning and Jilin, coupled with the tight money market, causing public anxiety and a sluggish market sentiment. The overall trend in the yarn market remained unchanged, in a state of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Slight Fluctuations in Human Label Yarn: The opening price for the exchange's human label yarn in the morning market showed American cotton being flat while Indian cotton was firm, with all months rising by 4, 5, and 8 *qian*. In the afternoon, all months fell by 5, 6, and 8 *qian*. The total trading volume for the day was 15,700 bales. Of these, 2,300 bales were sold by Gengfeng, 600 bales by Yukang, and 400 bales by Mingde. 950 bales were bought by Tianlong, 600 bales by Taixing, 600 bales by Houfeng, and 300 bales by Dachang. The closing prices for the human label yarn are listed below.</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Prices, Fluctuations, and Inventory</p>
<p>December 1524 Down 134,900 March 1538 | 69,650</p>
<p>January 1524 5 60,850 April 1538 Up 1 54,650</p>
<p>February 1528 471,400 May 1538 2 29,450</p>
<p>Low Yarn Sales, Less than 500 Bales: The sales of spot yarn were flat. The total purchase volume for all groups throughout the day was only 450 bales. 20 bales were acquired by local merchants, 160 bales by merchants from other parts of the country, 25 bales by merchants from the north, 160 bales by merchants from Guangdong, 50 bales by merchants from Changsha, 30 bales by merchants from Jiangxi, and 25 bales by miscellaneous merchants.</p>

<p>American Cotton Estimates Also Lower Than Expected</p>
<p>Cotton Market Strengthens: The price of Indian cotton continued to rise, and the silver-based calculated price rose by four to five *liang* compared to the low price, exceeding the price of American cotton. This attracted new buyers, resulting in an increase in market prices. Fortunately, factories absorbed a lot of cotton at low prices, so there was no need to purchase more at the moment, and the rise in prices was relatively moderate. However, based on the overall trend, it will be difficult to lower prices in the short term. The latest estimate for American cotton was lower than most private estimates, and gold prices are also unlikely to fall, so some may need to look beyond three *liang*.</p>
<p>Han Standard Cotton Continues to Rise by Four *Qian*: The opening price for the exchange's Han standard cotton in the morning market showed American cotton being stable while Indian cotton remained firm, with all months rising by 2-3 *qian*. In the afternoon, it rose again by 0.5 to 1 *qian*. The total trading volume for the day was 72,700 *dan*. Of these, 3,600 *dan* were sold by Yifeng, 2,100 *dan* by Dachang, 2,100 *dan* by Ruidai, and 1,900 *dan* by Xincheng. 2,300 *dan* were bought by Gongtai, 4,200 *dan* by Tongyu, 4,900 *dan* by Tianlong, 4,900 *dan* by Gengfeng, 4,700 *dan* by Changji, 2,000 *dan* by Yongda, and 1,000 *dan* by Xinheng. The closing prices for Han standard cotton are listed below.</p>

<p>No Activity in Spot Demand: The trading of spot cotton was flat, and factory demand remained sluggish. There were no reports of arrivals at the wharves. However, the market could hold due to the firm gold prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to the government report favoring buyers, but then weakened due to the decline on Wall Street and profit-taking. Futures fell by 2 to 6 points. Spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 7-8 points, and spot prices rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Fair Gorakh rising by 4 rupees, Oomra rising by 3.25 rupees, and Broach falling by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 8th).</p>

<h3 id="e163">Grain and Rice Market in Nan City Turns Stable <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Nantou: The source yesterday was about thirty boats, and the warehouse stock was not weak. Transactions between urban and rural shops were flat. The price of high-quality Houxin *japonica* rice was barely maintained, while the price of mid-grade rice occasionally fell. Although arrivals of early and late rice were sparse, the sales market in this area was limited, and the market price was stable. Although the demand for foreign rice was good, prices were high due to its scarcity. Sales at foreign companies were sluggish, and as foreign companies were gradually selling off, the market situation gradually weakened.</p>
<p>Xinzha: The source was only about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, mostly from the *xianzi* group. Transactions in this area remained sluggish, and the price per *hu* gradually fell. By the afternoon, the South City market became more active, and the market price in West Xinzha continued to be as before. Arrivals of thin rice were not large, and although the sales market was moving, it was not good. Merchants from other regions were quite active, and the situation was stable. Lower-quality *sanjiao* rice and *budu* rice were sold as soon as they arrived. Although there was some adulterated rice, transactions were extremely slow. Sales to breweries were still smooth, and prices did not rise or fall.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Foreign Rice Futures and Spot Markets Both Weak <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw buyers from other regions halt their purchases, and local merchants were also observing the situation. The market situation turned quiet again. Only one lot of 200 bags of Saigon rice was offered at 11.20 yuan, which was bought by a local merchant. The futures market declined as foreign companies continued to sell, and investor sentiment and market conditions trended downward. Buyers were observing the situation. No new transactions were made in the overall market. Several hundred tons of returned goods were offered, with five-month small-grain rice being priced at 4.92 *liang* and recent imports being bought at only 4.45 *liang*. The market presented a sluggish and weak situation.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Tapioca Flour Market Quiet After Factory Sell-Off <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's tapioca flour market showed a trend of initial weakness followed by stability after opening in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, the reported price of foreign wheat fell by around 3-4 *jiao*. Near-term investor sentiment showed continued weakness. March-May contracts were slightly stable. The lowest price for the current month was 1.87 *liang*, and the lowest price for January was 1.905 *liang*, a slight decrease of about 0.01 *liang* compared to the previous day. However, in the afternoon, as the factory's sell-off became quiet and it was reported that there was no response regarding the 3.6 *qian* foreign wheat, investor sentiment rose slightly, and buying sentiment stabilized. Most contracts improved by 0.01 *liang*. However, the subsequent outlook remained unfavorable. As a result, the current month was unchanged, January improved by 0.005 *liang*, February improved by 0.0075 *liang*, March improved by 0.0125 *liang*, April improved by 0.005 *liang*, and May improved by 0.0075 *liang*.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Wheat Shows Slight Stabilization <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Near-Term Continued Weakness, Not Optimistic</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market showed a trend of near-term weakness and long-term stability. Although the reported price of foreign wheat fell by about 3-4 *jiao*, the gold price fluctuated, making foreign wheat transactions difficult to conclude (no news of a response regarding the 3.6 *qian* Australian wheat). As a result, some investor sentiment stabilized slightly. However, the environment remained unfavorable, and the situation was difficult to clarify. It will be difficult to boost buying sentiment in the future. As a result, the current month was down by 0.02 *liang* compared to the previous day, January was down by 0.01 *liang*, February improved by 0.02 *liang*, April improved by 0.01 *liang*, and May improved by 0.03 *liang*.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Sugar Market, Quiet Trading, Stable Prices <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Red Market Uniquely Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market news from the production area indicated that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.1875, and the New York sugar futures price for December was 1.04, a sharp drop of 0.04 compared to the previous telegram. The prices for March, May, and September next year were 1.07, 1.12, and 1.24, respectively, each down by 0.03. Javanese sugar futures remained unchanged. There was little buying interest in the association market's offering of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white, and there was a shortage of sellers. The transaction price remained at 10 *liang*, with both inflow and outflow being sluggish and the trend being flat. No. 20 medium white sugar was priced at 9.85 *liang*, and No. 8 Dutch red sugar was priced at 8.6 *liang*, with high No. 9 being priced at 8.8 *liang*. Trading was quite brisk, and the market was uniquely active. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was priced at 11.775 *liang*, CW mark at 11.7 *liang*, DY mark at 11.7 *liang*, HX mark at 11.625 *liang*, and HM mark at 11.425 *liang*. There was not much trading, and the market was stable. Huaxin Company sold 500 bags of spot No. 9 Dutch red sugar at 8.8 *liang*. The trend was flat and unremarkable.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Silk and Tea, Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Quiet <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's local foreign silk market remained quiet. According to investigations, manufacturers holding silk in their hands were all considering painfully lowering prices to sell in order to maintain operations. However, news from overseas indicated that silk prices were still trending flat and weak. Stockpilers were relentlessly suppressing prices, resulting in huge losses that could not be sustained. Yesterday, only Boxin and others imported 5 bales of yellow reeled silk, Dachang and others imported 15 bales of white dry-reeled silk, and Xiangli imported 3 bales of yellow coarse silk. It was difficult for prices to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e169">New York Raw Silk Prices Reportedly Falling <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>In the New York market, raw silk imports from factories have recently been sluggish. The inventory of Japanese silk is relatively high, and spot prices have reportedly fallen. On Monday, Grade A was priced at only 2.35 USD per pound, Grade B at 2.12 USD, and Grade C at 1.85 USD, a decrease of 0.05 to 0.10 USD compared to the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Road-Packed Fine Tea Showing Slight Activity <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's local foreign tea market saw the launch of road-packed fine green tea from British firms such as Tianxiang, Fushi, Jinlong, and other firms. Needle tea, Gongxi, and other items also saw some sporadic transactions. The market situation has become more active. According to investigations, the current inventory of fine green tea is no more than 3,000 boxes, and it seems likely that it will be sold out within the year. Therefore, local Chinese merchants have adopted a slightly firmer attitude than before.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Metals, Tianjin Merchants Returning Metal Products <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's local metal market remained unchanged. Except for Qingdao merchants, who were buying, merchants from other regions were watching from the sidelines due to financial concerns. Tianjin merchants, because the goods they had previously purchased could not be shipped to Tianjin, were actively returning them in Shanghai. However, there were very few buyers, so the standard became even more chaotic. The continuous arrival of goods and the return of previous orders made the market more chaotic than before. Yesterday, 2.25-cent foreign silver heads were only selling for around 4 *liang*, 48-sheet human head galvanized iron was selling for 17.5 *liang*, 36-foot large Guangpi was selling for 9.25 *liang*, and copper was selling for 28 *liang*. Every standard was lower than before. However, as the situation between China and Japan has become increasingly dangerous recently, the future trend is not optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e172">New Lead Wire Discovered to Be Japanese Goods <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Since the Three Northeastern Provinces were forcibly occupied by the violent Japanese on September 18, all Chinese compatriots have been filled with hatred. As a result, the economic severance with Japan has been extremely enthusiastic. The work of the Anti-Japanese Association has also become increasingly urgent. Therefore, with the discovery of conscience, fellow merchants have automatically resisted setting prices, sealed existing goods, and the Japanese goods circulating in the market are no longer seen in the market. Now that the battle of Jinzhou is about to break out, the voice of resistance from our metal merchants has weakened. Therefore, the disguised Eastern goods that have appeared are not uncommon. New lead wire is the easiest to deceive. Therefore, there is a lot of it circulating in the market. We sincerely hope that anti-Japanese comrades will strictly verify and not let foreigners laugh at our five-minute heat again.</p>
<h3 id="e173">North-South Goods, Fungus Gradually Loosening <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Sales of fungus in various places have recently remained sluggish, and local prices have also been trending downward. The prices offered by Sichuan merchants here are quite favorable. Therefore, market prices have gradually declined. The current market price for high-quality top-grade fungus is only 140 *liang*, a decrease of 10 *liang* compared to before. Original-brand fungus is selling for 76 *liang*, a decrease of 7-8 *liang* compared to before. Mixed fungus is selling for 71 *liang*, a decrease of 5-6 *liang* compared to before. In recent days, merchants from Fujian and Guangdong have shown slightly more activity, and the trend shows signs of stabilizing.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Dried Longan Meat Drops by Two <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Shima dried round longan meat arrived from Xiamen on the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship, with a few boxes transported. The samples were seen yesterday. The goods were similar to before, and the pieces were also large. However, sales have been sluggish recently, and prices have been high. Therefore, the market opened yesterday with a decrease of about 2 *liang* compared to before. However, as the inventory is limited, the subsequent market will not be too loose.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Coal, 6,000 Tons of Kailuan Coal Arrives and Is Immediately Sold Out <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Kailuan Company recently shipped more than 6,000 tons of Kailuan lump coal, which was unloaded at the China Warehouse in Pudong and the Japanese Radiance Port Wharf. Upon receiving the news, local merchants rushed to load the coal with their boats. For a time, more than a hundred ant-like boats competed to be the first. However, there was not enough to meet the demand and the coal was not sufficient for distribution. As of yesterday, it was all unloaded and sold out. Those who arrived later were left empty-handed. The selling price remained at 10.05 *liang*.</p>

<p>— Mr. Ye Ranchuo's Speech at the Qingdao Women's Zhengyi Association, Notes by Ms. Chen Yunhuang</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased and honored that your esteemed association has asked me to say a few words today.</p>
<p>However, I did not prepare beforehand, so I can only offer a few rambling remarks as a contribution. Since arriving in Qingdao, the thing that has made me happiest is the social work that your esteemed association is doing. To be able to work so enthusiastically in such a quiet atmosphere is worthy of attention. Today, I will use "Women Under the Three Principles of the People" as my topic for discussion. Why do we want to discuss this topic? Everyone knows that the National Government was founded on the Three Principles of the People and is governed by them.</p>
<p>These two sentences have been heard and seen so many times on various propaganda materials and slogans posted on walls that everyone is tired of them. Because they are seen too often and are too common, these propaganda and slogans fail to arouse stimulation and attention. However, upon careful study, they are of great value and have a profound relationship with the future of the country. So, how should women under the Three Principles of the People act? This is worthy of our discussion. According to a recent postal survey, the Chinese population is nearly 500 million, of which women account for 250 million. Ladies and gentlemen, you must understand that the strength of a modern country depends entirely on whether all the citizens can unite, not on the talents of one or two heroes. In the past, relying on a few leaders to command the army could defeat the enemy. Now, with the progress of public opinion, national responsibility rests on the shoulders of the general public. We often hear the slogan "Total National Mobilization," which means that every citizen should bear responsibility. To take the smallest example, during the European War, the people of the belligerent countries saved their own bread and transported it to the front to feed the soldiers. This is the meaning of total national mobilization.</p>
<p>Our country is an industrially backward country. Our various industries are far behind others, causing the people of the whole country to suffer all kinds of oppression. If we want the country to survive, we will be powerless without total national mobilization. In the past, when we talked about patriotism, we were just talking about it. We never really felt the pain deeply. In the last ten years, various trends have surged and impacted. The world's major powers have also been greatly affected by economic oppression, let alone China, with its underdeveloped industry and unorganized politics. In this situation,</p>
<p>coupled with the continuous succession of natural disasters over the years, the floods you just mentioned are only one of them. People say that China has a vast territory and abundant resources, but in fact, China has a vast territory but not abundant resources. Let's take our daily necessities as an example. Our country is based on agriculture, and the people's food and clothing should have been very abundant, but now the silk and cotton we use are mostly imported. Rice is also imported from Japan, Annam, and Siam. Flour is imported from Canada. Even the materials for the houses we live in and the roads we walk on have to rely on foreigners. In short, it can be said that the clothes we wear are given to us by others, the food we eat is given to us by others, the houses we live in are given to us by others, and the roads we walk on are given to us by others. In other words, we have to rely on others to have clothes to wear, food to eat, houses to live in, and roads to walk on. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of people's daily life. If we rely on others, not only will the losses be too great, but the danger will be very great.</p>
<p>According to recent reports from disaster relief workers, at least 200,000 to 300,000 people have died in the floods in our country this time. In the past ten years or so, a total of about one million people have died in various places due to natural and man-made disasters, but the people of the country have not awakened, and the civil war continues unabated. China has reached a time of great calamity. Therefore, I say that if China is to survive, everyone must work together. Men should work hard, and women should also fulfill their national responsibilities. We should make special efforts regarding unexpected things. Just like the European War mentioned above, the people of the belligerent countries saved bread and supplied it to the soldiers. This is a method of saving the country by the people. The power of the people is great and deep, and its efficiency surpasses the great achievements of heroes who succeed by chance. If the people have shallow knowledge and cannot unite, even if one or two heroes fight for the country, they will be powerless. If the people of the whole country can fulfill their respective responsibilities, then their country will be strong. Therefore, we should not have the mindset of "not doing anything unless it is a big deal," and we should not fail to fulfill our responsibilities to the country unless we are in high positions. Every man and every woman in China should quickly</p>

<p>awaken, unite spontaneously, and work together.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk briefly about the Three Principles of the People. Let's start with nationalism. Is the Chinese nation healthy? Is its solidarity strong? Let us examine the reasons why it is not healthy and not strong. Where is the root cause? Since the success of the revolution, the five ethnic groups are in a republic, meaning that the five ethnic groups should be equal. But are the knowledge levels of the five ethnic groups equal? Are the knowledge and abilities of the 500 million people healthy? It is difficult to improve the nation now, but the most important part is to improve the knowledge and abilities of the 250 million women. Women account for half of the entire Chinese nation. If this half of the women can bear considerable responsibility for the country, their power will definitely be great. The greatest difficulty for women is the physical disadvantage. If we want the entire nation to be healthy, we must first ensure that the physical strength of half of the women is healthy. Therefore, eugenics in recent times is not just empty talk and is very worthy of study.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the principle of democracy. The Premier divided power into two things: authority and ability. However, the two must be connected. Those with authority must have "ability." Those without ability should not have authority. Nowadays, people only know how to fight for power, but they do not talk about ability. If abilities are not cultivated well and one obtains power, not only may it not be used well, but it may even harm the country. I hope women will understand the current situation of China and their own position and should strive to seek "ability." In the future constitutional period, they will certainly be able to achieve the goal of participating in politics and holding political power.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the principle of people's livelihood. China has reached a time of poverty and exhaustion. At this time, it is impossible to escape the economic oppression of other countries. Most wealthy people are extravagant and use aristocratic Western goods exclusively. The poor also love to look good and rush to buy cheap Eastern goods. The people's livelihood of the country is almost completely plundered by foreigners. Therefore, it can be said that it is difficult for China to escape its status as a semi-colony. Is this because China has no fundamental solution, or is it because the people are not awakened and do not work hard? I think our China is not a country that has no fundamental solution. For daily necessities, we should use domestic products as much as possible and strive to improve and increase production capacity. Nowadays, people in our country compete to look good and do not care about practicality. This is true not only for the rich in cities, but also for the peasants in remote rural areas. Therefore, they reject domestic products and rush to use foreign goods, causing the national interest to be taken away by foreigners without any regard. If our 500 million compatriots make up their minds that ordinary daily necessities must be domestic products, then when the supply falls short of demand, the people of the country will definitely rise up to find ways to increase production. As for the equipment and machinery needed in education, science, industry, and military affairs, we can temporarily purchase foreign goods. This requires the government to cultivate specialized talents. After ten years, it can be successful. Our Republic of China has the materials for development and the land for development, but it is because the people of the whole country do not have the determination to develop that the country's livelihood is becoming increasingly poor. It is a pity. I remember that during the European War, Japan lacked food and hoped that the United States would lend him 350,000 tons of rice every year. The relationship between the United States and Japan has always been bad, so they were unwilling to agree. Later, Japan repeatedly requested, and the United States only allowed him to exchange it for 350,000 tons of ships. The Japanese authorities had to sacrifice in order to take care of the people's food, but after being stimulated by this, they worked extremely hard. Now, Japanese rice is being transported to our country. The Chinese nation, which claims to be based on agriculture, relies on foreigners for much of its food and clothing, which is not only shameful, but has reached a terrible time. Regarding clothing, you women should pay more attention.</p>
<p>In recent years, almost all of the materials for women's clothing have been imported. Our country originally had very good silk, satin, damask, and gauze, but because the patterns were slightly inferior, most women were unwilling to wear them, so things like georgette and Indian silk greatly catered to the psychology of women. Although they are thin and expensive, they do not care. In addition, the leather shoes and silk stockings on the feet, the shirts and undershirts on the body, the watches and rings on the hands, and the perfume and cosmetics on the head are all imported and are all expensive things. A leather suitcase in hand can be worth dozens of yuan. Since the price of gold has soared, the Chinese people do not know how much they have suffered. Look at the development of Japan in recent years, especially its aggression against our country, which is very alarming. Japan is an island country with a very small area. Its own country is not enough for development, so it has no choice but to invade other countries. However, it is difficult to invade other countries. If the invaded people make strong and effective resistance, Japan's development will definitely be greatly hindered. Under such difficulties, Japan's development has shocked the world. As the saying goes, "It depends on people." The people of China should wake up. As mentioned above, China has a vast territory but not abundant resources, but with this vast land, it is easy to develop. The way to develop does not have to be to invade other countries. Just work hard in your own home, and you can compete with the richest country in the world, the United States. Not only will the people's livelihood be free of problems from then on, but also it can supply the needs of people in other countries. Now, all countries in the world have special developments, but China not only has no development in anything, but also relies on others for everything, resulting in a crisis. I think it is not that China has no fundamental solution, but that a small number of leaders in China are not up to par, which makes the majority of the people follow suit. As a result, everyone complains about heaven and blames others, pointing fingers at each other. Having reached this point, it is absolutely inappropriate to be so bored. Everyone should cheer up and work hard. It is useless to just complain about each other. Half of my fellow female compatriots should not give up their responsibilities. For example, if we plant a tree and never see it grow up and expect it to wither day by day, we should study the reasons. Is it because the land is not good, or is someone ruining it? I can say that the land in China is considered very fertile and very suitable for planting in the world, so it is not that the land is not good. It is indeed the people themselves who are ruining it. One person ruins it in this way, and everyone else does not have the responsibility to protect it, and even ruins it casually. If everyone is willing to make up their minds to protect it, it will definitely grow very luxuriantly. Half of my fellow female compatriots should bear the responsibility of joint protection and joint cultivation. But we must understand the phenomena of Chinese society, carefully study various cultivation methods, do not shout wildly, rush recklessly, see the objects clearly, and proceed step by step. For example, in the matter of raising money for disaster relief, everyone feels exhausted from running around. In fact, just the opium tax in Hankou alone can generate 160 million yuan a year, and cigars generate 30 million yuan a year. This is just for domestic products. I don't know how much more there is for imported goods. If our smoking compatriots all smoke one less cigarette, wouldn't that be enough to save the disaster victims of the whole country? To take it a step further, before this flood occurred, it was clear that the dikes in the Yangtze River basin were not strong, but no one was willing to do preventive work. Therefore, this flood was not an accidental natural disaster. If it does not come this year, it will come next year or the year after. Therefore, I say that China does not have a fundamental solution, but everyone has given up on themselves. Because everyone does not pay attention to everything, the country suffers.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have not yet eliminated family relationships. The common life in the family cannot be abolished. If women have received considerable education and are engaged in occupations, they can at least reduce part of the burden on men. When women have occupations, there can be more production and less consumption in the family. If every woman in the country reduces consumption by one yuan, then the whole country can reduce consumption by 250 million yuan. To take it a step further, if every woman in the country produces one yuan, then the country's production volume will also increase by 250 million yuan. Therefore, women have such a great relationship with national production, so women's education should also be given special attention. I often hear about overthrowing the education of virtuous wives and good mothers, which is also wrong. Virtuous wives and good mothers are not humiliating women's education. Women's education is certainly not limited to virtuous wives and good mothers. On the other hand, men are not limited to being virtuous husbands and good fathers. However, we should cooperate with each other according to our respective natures, with the goal of benefiting the country. For example, a factory is divided into a machine room and an office. You cannot say that the machine room is the factory and the office is not the factory, nor can you say that the office is important and the machine room is not important. Cooperation is necessary.</p>
<p>Now, China's national situation is as dangerous as a pile of eggs. Women should cooperate with men, men should not despise women, and women should not give up on themselves. As for the methods of cooperation, of course, I cannot explain them in detail here, but do not have ambition first. When you come out, you will not do anything unless it is a big deal, to show your ability and gain false reputation. You must know that even if it is a very small thing, as long as it is beneficial, you have to start. Although the matter is small, the strength of the people across the country is not small. When all men and women in the country understand this principle, they can develop internally and resist externally.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Japan's Past and Future Aggression Against China by Mori Chi <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Originally written by Tenta Shukei</p>
<p>Published by Guanghua Bookstore</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the Eastern Province Incident, nearly three months have passed in an instant. Even those who have no common sense of international politics understand that this incident is entirely a planned, step-by-step, and prepared action by Japan. No one will doubt that it is simply a "rash action by a small number of Japanese soldiers."</p>
<p>Some say that Japan's blatant actions this time were based on the ideas of Tanaka Giichi, while others say that they followed the policies of Yamada Takeji. In fact, the person who first initiated the plan and led the invasion of China was the famous former Minister of Finance, Tenta Shukei. The plans of Tanaka and others after that were all based on his old tricks.</p>
<p>Amidst the extremely high tide of anti-Japanese sentiment, I would like to introduce Tenta's book "Japan's Past and Future Aggression Against China" to the people of the country.</p>
<p>The contents of this book are as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Introduction. In the review of the necessity of invading China, he said, "The fact that such a neighboring country is now weak and declining is a great opportunity for the development of the Yamato nation. We should study and deal with it in order to soar in the continent and renew the face of the Asian race. This is truly what we should plan." Just from these few sentences, we can see that Japan's ambition to annex China is clearly evident. He also said, "China is rich in iron ore and lime, has promising oil resources, can cultivate cotton, can raise sheep, and has other materials. All the necessities for our national economy... can be obtained from China. Because of this relationship, it is most urgent to grasp the power to control China's economy from the perspective of imperial independence. I regard the China issue as the most important thing because of this. Furthermore, when we look at China's politics, there are those who advocate partition based on the power relations of various countries... However, today's consensus in the empire is that China must not be partitioned. This is not because it is in China's interest that it cannot be partitioned, but because it is in the empire's interest that it cannot be partitioned... It is better to let China nominally possess sovereignty, while the empire reaps the actual benefits." These few words have now realized his legacy. For example, the League of Nations proposed to establish a central zone in Jinzhou, but Japan openly opposed it, because it completely regards China as "a gift from heaven to the Yamato nation" and is extremely unwilling to have a third party interfere. Therefore, after the incident occurred, it absolutely advocated direct negotiations and did not propose the idea of partition. This is entirely in accordance with Tenta's will. Therefore, tracing back to the cause of this incident, Japan has used threatening means everywhere, in order to make us completely submit to him. His vicious policy is to make China nominally possess sovereignty, while Japan reaps the actual benefits, in other words, to let Japan manipulate China's economic power without incurring the crime of destroying China. Therefore, Tenta's book is nothing less than a confession of Japan's vicious policy of invading China.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Sino-Japanese Friendship and Various Facilities. This chapter talks about how Japan must pretend to be friendly with China, while secretly devising ways to gradually swallow China. His heart is big, and his plan is also cunning. He said, "The Empire hopes to develop in China, so it hopes to be friendly with China." This is truly a confession of his inner heart. He also said, "However, in the past, the development in China was too eager for profit. For example, when investing in China, we hoped for too much from them, and we gained too much, which often led to disputes... It only aroused the suspicion of the Chinese people. I especially try to avoid these malpractices and follow the motto of 'giving before taking' in order to reap great benefits in the future." From this, we can know that his poisonous plan is to first give us a small profit, and then implement his economic aggression, sucking our blood, wanting to make China a blood-deficient and weak body, and forever provide it with flesh.</p>
<p>However, designing to invade our country certainly requires preparation and facilities. Tenta also deeply felt this necessity, so he said, "We have proposed many facilities for China, and most of them have not yet been implemented." From this, we can see that Tenta is truly the first person to mastermind the invasion of China, because many facilities were also proposed by him. At that time, the important facilities he proposed for development in China included "the improvement and reform of financial institutions in China," "loans to China," "the establishment of political affairs officials stationed in China," "the problem of financial advisors in China," "the problem of Chinese tariffs," etc. In particular, he spared no effort for the plan of Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: The Improvement and Reform of China's Financial Institutions. Tenta was a former important figure in the Japanese Ministry of Finance. Since the Russo-Japanese War, all of Japan's economic aggression against China has involved his participation, because he has more experience in economics, especially with regard to the financial situation of China. This chapter is divided into several sections, such as the improvement and reform of financial institutions and lending institutions in Manchuria and Mongolia, the improvement and reform of financial institutions in mainland China, and details the tasks of Japanese financial institutions that invaded China, such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Korea, the Bank of Taiwan, the Japanese Industrial Bank, and the China and South Sea Bank. The analysis is exceptionally clear. It is clearly indicated which bank should be active in the world, which bank should be active exclusively in China, which bank should increase its reserves and set up branches in Shanghai, and which bank should manipulate the finances of Manchuria. Therefore, Tenta is a great planner for Japan and a great enemy to our country. As for mentioning the Japanese investment institutions that invaded China, his conspiracy is even more obvious. He said, "Investing in China is extremely valuable for secrecy and speed. If it is leaked before it is completed, it will not be possible to establish it even if it is of great benefit to Japan. This is what I have experienced many times. Therefore, it is most necessary to conduct it quickly and secretly under the consolidation group of these special banks." Therefore, the Oriental Development Company, the East Asia Industrial Company, and the China-Japan Industrial Company, etc., were successively established, and they invested in our country en masse to achieve their ambitions of aggression. Their investments in China are mostly biased towards railways, because they can not only profit from it, but also use the convenience of transportation to invade the interior of China. From then on, Japanese goods flooded the market like mercury poured on the ground, and Japanese colonists poured into China like carps crossing the river.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: An Outline of Loans to China. He said, "In order to protect the independence of Japan's national economy or national defense in the future, we cannot but occupy China... If we want to make a great country exist in East Asia, we cannot but work hard to develop China... Investing in China's economy is Japan's duty, and this matter is extremely just for China and for the world." His words are absurd and can be said to be extreme. The so-called loans to China are to lend money to the Chinese at an interest rate of 8% to establish railways and telecommunications, etc. After Japan lent money to China, on the one hand, it gained control of China's economy, and on the other hand, it gained priority in various transportation and telecommunications aspects due to the loan terms, making it an important part of aggression. He said, "The improvement of China's telecommunications... is also more convenient for our country and other countries' commercial trade, and the China and South Sea Bank can also play a role in this regard." Therefore, from this we can know that none of his conspiracies are not multi-faceted. He is truly a great conspirator that has never been seen in the world.</p>
<p>What Tenta could not forget the most was lending money to China to build railways, because the construction of railways could give the development of Japan's aggression the greatest benefit. Look at what he said, "When this railway is completed, the Empire will be able to connect Korea, Manchuria, and the northern provinces of China very satisfactorily... Expediting the construction of these railways is also the most important thing for the future development of Japan's mainland." What should we think?</p>
<p>Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are about the branch aspects of aggression. Some of them have become the past, and some have not yet been realized. I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>In the conclusion of Chapter 10, he said, "Regarding the issue of Japan's economic superiority, I have only opened the door. As for the facilities that have been put in place to make them effectively realized, some may take several years, and some may take several decades. I hope that the government and the public will work together with one heart and one mind to ensure that this foundation is not destroyed and to work hard on this foundation to build it even more solidly." No wonder there was Tanaka's "Proactive Policy of Japan's Aggression Against Manchuria and Mongolia." From this, we can know that the September 18th Incident was also an expected event.</p>
<p>It is said that this book is secretly issued in Japan and distributed to important political and financial figures in the country. It was obtained by the translator after hard searching. I hope readers will read it carefully.</p>
