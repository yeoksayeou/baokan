<p>（南京）　國民會議對於國民政府剿滅赤匪報告之决議案、全文如下、</p>
<p>大會聽國民政府剿滅赤匪報告後、深知國民政府於連年討平軍閥之中、迄未稍稍放棄其剿辦赤匪之責任、而赤匪之所以未能如期肅淸者、實因其外引赤色帝國主義以爲之發縱指示、内乘過去軍閥之相繼叛亂以陰圖坐大、而吾民生計之憔悴、智識之幼稚、與社會組織之脆弱、則又在在予以可乘之隙、國民政府於其過去所遇艱難困苦之中、猶能討逆剿匪、雙方並顧、使赤匪之勢、日益窮促、燎原之禍、莫由蔓延、其艱難困苦、實足起吾人之歎慰與同情者也、</p>

<p>第一、必須深明赤匪之毒害與罪惡赤匪之存在與蔓延、與中國民族之生存與發展不能相容、此義實已無可置疑、須知赤匪者、乃赤色帝國主義與土匪之混合體、證以國民政府之報告與吾人歷年觀察之事實、赤色帝國主義對我東北各省及蒙古新疆、自始即已處心積慮、進行其赤色的軍國主義及赤色的資本義之侵略、此兩種侵略計畫之實施、目的在呑併中國之領土、以加入於赤色聯邦之版圖、攫取中國之富源、以塡赤色的資本主義者之慾　、今此兩種侵略之形勢、已成長蛇之陣、蜿蜒伸入、其將爲中國前途最大之外患、蓋已舉世所燭知、爲欲保證其此種侵略計劃之得以施行無阻、赤色帝國主義於是同時卵翼中國共產當徒與贛湘等處之赤匪、使其擾亂吾國之社會、破壞吾國之經濟、煽動吾國之内亂、以冀吾全國上下無暇注意其對於我東北西北邊疆各省所蓄之陰謀、乃至無力足以抵抗其實際之侵略、是故赤匪者、其外形旣爲赤色帝國主義與土匪之混合體、其實質必爲中國將來内亂與外患之噴火口、今其爲禍於贛湘、已使地成棄土、野滿餓殍、村無完屋、市絶行人、斯其流毒與罪惡、蓋非過去白色帝國主義軍閥官僚土豪劣綽地痞流氓之積惡所能比擬、吾全國人民及今欲圖自救救國之方、必須以週知赤匪此種毒害與惡爲第一要義、</p>

<p>此次法國之選舉白安忽告失敗國内國外皆大驚訝以爲殊出意料之外據巴黎電謂賴伐爾聲言。白氏之失敗。足使全内閣受影響。又有人謂白里安自信其地位動搖。而欲脱離外部。故放棄競選者。又有人謂法國之外交政策。將有變更者。又有人謂白一旦脱離外部。法之泛歐會議政策。將更少成功機會者。此皆悲觀者之論也。然從另一方面觀察。則其説又異。以爲此次之總統。屬之杜美爾氏。正欲使白里安久於外交。故政府派中亦有助杜氏投票者。賴伐爾且已宣稱此次選舉之結果。不可視爲反對政府外交政策之表示。政府之外交政策。無時不爲國會所贊同。内閣照例辭職後。將仍請白氏留職。而白氏亦已表示不欲辭外長之職。似此次白氏之不當選。與政局毫無關係。此種樂觀之論亦甚多。惟據吾人觀之。法國正當外交多故之時。白里安之留。關係確甚重大。當局對於外交政策。决不輕於變更。而白氏爲國家前途計。亦必不肯輕離外交。是則較爲可信者矣。</p>

<p>告市民書　胡鴻基第七届衛生運動告</p>
<p>市民書云、市民們、本市舉行衛生運動、此次已是第七次了、每次的運動中、衛生局曾將許多關於衛生常識的要點、或者是編印傳單標語、分給市民、或者是出佈告登廣告用種種方法來宣傳、無非是想使得大家都能明白衛生的眞義、多得、一點保護康健的常識、人人能做一箇知道注重衛生的市民、人人都是一箇健全有爲的國民、再由大家合作的力量、來促進整箇的公共衛生事業、來造成整箇的健全民族、來洗刷東亞病夫的恥辱、這就是我們在每次的運動中、一再向市民勸告的目的、我們就種種方面觀察、見得現在本市市民對於衛生這件事的認識已經比較進步、對於衛生與人生關係的重要、亦已漸知注意、因爲我們在近兩年中、接到市民請求取締妨害衛生事項的文件、增加了不少、這就是市民的公共衛生知識進步的表現、也就是我們主管衛生行政機關很爲歡慰的一件事、更是我們覺得責任重大、尤不得不努力促進的一件事、因爲還有許多事實、告訴我們、倘有少數市民、對於公共衛生知織、仍很薄弱、對於公共衛生的重要、仍不注意我們舉一箇例、就拿預防霍亂這件事來説罷、霍亂這箇病、大家都知道是一種厲害的傳染病、每年一到夏天、最容易發生預防的方法、第一要打預防針、第二要留心飮食、接受打預防針的人愈普遍愈好、因爲少數人不打針仍多被霍亂傳染的機會、所以本局自成立以來、對於預防工作、特别注意、務求普遍、每年一到夏季我們必定派遣許多醫生到各處爲市民免費打針、凡是民衆團體學校機關、以及工廠工人衆多之處、我們都要派醫生前往打針、就我們歷年來的經騐觀察、市民中踴躍接受打針的固亦不少、然仍有若干團體及工廠商店等的領袖或夥友、不懂打霍亂預防針的益處、推諉不肯打針、有時甚至公然拒絶、推測他們拒絶打針的心理不外下邊幾箇原因、（一）以爲正在工作而去打針、要費去若干分鐘的工作時間、（二）根本程度上毫無公共衛生知識、以爲我箇人現在並未生病、何必要打針、除此兩種外、我們再也想不出他們拒絶打針的理由、因爲我們派醫生出外打針、無論到何處都是完全免費、被打針的人旣不受絲毫損失、又可使自己身體加添抵抗霍亂侵害的力量、何樂而不肯打針呢、再拿前面兩種理由來説第一種不肯打針的原因、我們敢斷定完全是少數無知識的廠主或職員等的私見、因爲他們的目的、祗在謀利、以爲工人正在工作、稍爲停止廠方要受損失、這種心理可以説是非常錯誤、不但顯出自私自利的心太重、博愛的道德心太薄、簡直可説不懂現在時代經營工商事業的原理、因爲霍亂是劇烈傳染病最易蔓延、工廠商店、又是人多事雜的地方、彼此交接甚繁、疫病傳染的機會更多、一旦發生了霍亂等傳染病、就有波及全體的大危險、所以防止劇烈傳染病的發生、就是保持夥友的工作能力、這層道理、鴻基趁這衛生運動的機會、亟欲說明一下、希望本市全體廠方店方的領袖及主管者、多多的思量、把應抱的方針、清清楚楚、透透闢闢的認明一下才好、再説到前面推測的第二種不肯打針的原因、完全是由於頑固的思想、毫無適合現代的衛生知識、仍把傳染病認爲天災神禍、不知霍亂完全由於傳染、因其傳染極易、所以夏秋之間、往往害死了很多的人、上海從前因爲没有注重預防、以致霍亂流爲大害、曾有棺材賣完可駭的事實、在上海住過多年的市民想必還會記得、這箇病旣然是傳染極易、所以目前雖是無病的人、説不定從飮食或接觸方面、馬上就可受其傳染、生病感受痛苦、尙係小事、性命危在頃刻之間、請醫已有不及挽救之險、所以祗有打預防針、使自已身體内加添些抵抗力量、就是偶被侵入而生霍亂、也可使病情減輕、容易醫好、所以打預防針、就是各人自已預防霍亂的害人、是夏秋之間自已保護生命的一箇重要方法、若説目前没有得到霍亂病就不必打預防針、這種心理、實在錯誤、至於留心飮食一事、也是很要緊、因爲霍亂這箇病完全由於霍亂細菌在腸胃内作梗、所以得病的人、都是上吐下瀉、所以我們對於吃的、喝的、都要特别當心、尤其不可吃生水、以及生水做的、生水洒過的、蒼蠅叮過的那些東西、因爲生水及蒼蠅叮過的東西、往往附著得有眼看不出的霍亂細菌、誤入口内而傳到腸胃裏、細菌就會繁殖而奪人的生命、關於這一層衛生局在生年夏季、曾一再佈告促起市民的注意、但是據我們觀察結果、市民方面還欠特别注意的表現、這是希望本市市民、在、</p>
<p>今年起、加以改進的一樁事體、本届衛生運動舉行之時、已在衛生局本年進行預防霍亂工作的時期之中了、希望今年全體市民、能大家注意預防、大家都打預防針、革除一切無理由的成見、互相勸勉、努力合作、使一切疫病之害、一年比一年少、市民衛生智識之程度、一年比一年高、使將來的衛生運動、竟可不必舉行、使將來的衛生機關、祇須爲市民做執行的任務、無庸再做什麽宣傳同勸告的工作、實現新中國大上海市民程度之高尙、這又是鴻基今天藉此機會、誠懇企望的一件事、就請共同策勉、互相期成罷、</p>

<p>褚民誼演講太極操</p>
<p>十一日訪友於東吳大學法律學院。是日適爲星期一。該校舉行紀念週。有中委褚民誼先生蒞校演講。遂爲友人所嬲。蒞塲一聆其演詞。褚以中委而提倡體育。早已蜚聲國内。近又發明所謂太極操者。四出宣傳不遺餘力。其名且揚溢於海外。褚君此次在東吳演講。講題亦爲太極操。人有以提倡拳術小先生者。殊不知體育之於民族健康。乃有莫大之關係。總理於民族主義演講中。亦孜孜乎冀求個人身體之康健。茲謹就褚君演講。擇其趣者。記之如下。</p>
<p>褚君謂太極操之特點。在手足之動作。取環形綫而不取直綫。其意以爲人身筋骨之動作。不常隅於前後。普通體操之僅講直綫而無内外環形之曲折。實爲缺點。而從機械學上一加考察。尤見環形綫之優於直綫也。試以風扇爲例。揮蒲扇以取凉。上下相揮。直綫也。進一步。人有以布縫成大扇。懸於室中。以繩牽之。成績較佳矣。而扇之行動仍爲直綫也。及機械發達。外國人利用電氣。製成電扇。電扇有四翼。其行動不復取直綫而作環形矣。此其一。水上交通。舊有帆船。以人工推櫓或搖槳。其行動亦取直線。及至蒸汽機出。以翼代櫓。四週扇動。取環形線矣。此其二。其他如飛機。其原理實源於禽鳥。禽鳥之飛。其翼上下動。亦直線也。然飛機之翼。則改取環形線之動轉。成績遠勝於鳥之飛也。此其三。故余之太極操。取環形線而不取直線。</p>
<p>褚君又言。俗云人中短者其人不壽。此言雖無學理之根據。然余能證明其頗有理由。空氣之中。含有多量之穢物及微生蟲。故衛生家常諄諄戒人勿以口呼吸。須以鼻代之。鼻中有毛。而距肺之途徑又曲折而遼遠。呼吸之際。空氣中之穢物及微生蟲即不易直入。凡人以口呼吸。常張大其口。口之張大成習。上唇即曲折而縮短。所謂人中短促即由於是。空氣中之穢物及微菌。隨時可以進襲肺部。如入無人之境。其不早病而死亦幾希。</p>
<p>褚君繼述太極操之要訣。隨述隨以身作則。在講台上現身説法。一若體操敎師然。其宣傳太極操。有三句標語。一曰不費時。全套計六段。十餘分鐘可畢事。二曰不費錢。因無需器械。不需一定塲地。隨時隨地可行之。三曰不費力。全套動作。輕描淡寫。無論老幼婦女。均可爲之。</p>
<p>褚君演詞旣畢。東吳法學院院長吳經熊先生繼起作謝詞。吳君固東方朔之流亞也。其開塲第一句即曰。褚先生之太極操。不取直線而取環形線之理由。余尙有一言可爲補充。即環形線具有曲線之美也。言已。且以兩手上下左右彎曲。作天女散花狀。一時閧堂大笑。盡歡而散。</p>

<p>— 青燈</p>
<p>美國紐約達芬倍奚博士。曾將Ｘ光照諸雞蛋之上。作極有趣味之試騐。此種試騐。影響於雞蛋之孵化與雛雞頗大。將多數之雞蛋。曝於Ｘ光下。有僅數分鐘者。有至數小時者。各有不同之效果。僅曝數分鐘者。所孵化之雛雞。百分之九十以上爲雌性。與普通雌雄性之比例。相差極遠。經曝數小時者。尤發現一種奇妙之現象。所孵化之雛雞。非爲現代所有。身體之結構上。有突異之進步。據般科學家推測。如此之進步。尙須經數百年之進化程序。而今經Ｘ光之一照。竟突飛改變至數百年後之現象。斯亦奇矣。</p>

<p>余自樂平卸篆後。供職南京。一日。兩得揚州電。電曰速來。蓋張子蔚運使召往診病也。次日。快車至揚州。駐運司署之桂花廳。聞署中老　云。運司署當年共屋九百九十九間。今則坍頽大半矣。自曾賓谷盧雅雨爲運使時。除清俸外。每年各鹽商。皆有報效。數甚巨。今則減去十之六七矣。至於鹽政之高下其手。報銷之内外朦蔽。視爲例行。不堪僂指。去年部令。忽將運司署遷至淮北。一般藉運使署噉飯者。頓形窘迫。幾有哭笑不得之概</p>
<p>昔余賃居揚州之五福巷。與个園爲鄰。个園主人。名至筠。字个園。甘泉人。十四歲孤。人没其遺產。年十九。策驢入都。以父友書見兩淮鹽政某公。與語。奇其才。以爲兩淮商總。由道府加鹽運使銜。入都祝嘏。賞圓明園聽戲。賜克什。當是時。上至鹽政。下至鹽商。一視君爲動靜。揚人相與語。指首屈必及君。君蓄名書畫數千。而不好伎樂。嘗至蘇黴歌召客。豪費日千金。人皆怪其所爲。適有西人艶之。屬轉輸銀百餘萬。而奏銷得報如期。其膽智固有不可及者。此見諸梅伯言黃个園傳。不數十年而家日落。滿園花木。台閣洞石如故也。宛其死矣。也人入室。可慨也夫。</p>
<p>入室者誰。爲鹽商李某。席豐厚。性驕縱。詼調舞歌。狂妄恣肆。行路者爲之側目。時有詩譏之曰。月白衫兒眞俊俏。水紅頂子費疑猜。後門棋杆高高樹。内室台基暗暗開。最是碧蘿春裏坐。走堂高呌大人來。此李某生時事也。李某卒。家日衰。而个園羣屋。僅留十之二三。餘皆他賃。然即此十之二三。猶有足觀。余與興化楊君遊之。斷石零碑。空亭花落。見門額有大篆二。曰个園。夫李某不足惜。吾竊爲黃个園悲矣。倘他日新鹽法實行。就塲徵税。不假手引商。又不知引商之子孫。其悲狀爲何如也。</p>
<h3 id="c182">蠟美人 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>本談時載藝術之作。如手搦肖像。神態逼眞。雅事流傳。歎爲絶技。斯固西方民族所視爲難能可貴者也。近據留法俞君談。巴黎技巧。亦富盛名。而蠟製美人。尤屬得心應手。爲他國所望塵莫及。所謂蠟美人者。恒陳列於各大商肆。間亦有閨閣名媛。或歌塲艶姬。出資造型。藉供欣賞。縱形態具大小之判。但人物生動。觀者輒留連不忍去也。因誌所聞。藉作豹窺。</p>
<p>欲製成一絶妙之蠟美人。必先訪求一面目嬌好體態輕靈之模物兒。通常模特兒供人描寫。率去其裳衣。顯露肉體之美。惟雇以造蠟人者此實非必需之條件也。模特兒所應注意者。厥惟美的姿勢。故常由專家指援。敎以種種形式。務使全身上下。莫不美感動人。於是目注手揮。傳神描形。範成各部之陰模。其技之精者。往往無須修改。一經配合。宛然一丰姿絶世之女郎也。</p>
<p>陰模製自黏士。俟乾。灌注蠟汁。空其中作一外廓。稍久潤水脱落。即成蠟製眞形。斯際尙有重要工作。如型有目眶。須配秋水之瞳。有口腔。須裝瓠犀之齒。而雙眉如黛。青絲如雲。更非處處加以細心之手術不可。如此肢體面目。整飾入時。乃復煊染彩色。使蘋果之頰。冰雪之肌。相得益彰。以成完璧。聞美人代價。至少非五十鎊不辦。而此中技巧。類多薪傳。亦非普通造像者所能勝任云。</p>
<p>出版界消息　李石芩氏所擬人生十題。由許晚成氏在上海民國日報徵求答案。頗有意味。現已另印成册。并附應答人姓名通信錄。函索附郵十五分。寄上海膠州路大夏中學許晚成收。即奉上一册云。</p>

<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>二十一日抵大連。吾舊遊地。郤有一件事。爲我從前所未見。不由不驚心動魄的。就是南滿洲鐵道會社所設的滿蒙資源館。</p>
<p>「南滿洲鐵道會社者。藉日支共存共榮之美名。而投資於其地之鐵道。海運。鑛山。森林。銅鐵。農業。畜產等。達四億四千餘萬。元名雖半官半民。其實權無不操諸政府。付以外交警察及一般政權。使之發揮帝國主義。形成特殊社會。無異朝鮮統資之第二」。這幾句。不是我的猜測。是日本故田中内閣奏章中語。見民國十八年十二月時事月報。是日本政府自畫供狀呀。</p>
<p>一進資源館門。便是一大塊煤。比人高一身有半。闊與厚相稱。是撫順露天發掘得來的。</p>
<p>鑛產部占全館四之一。農產林產占四之一。畜產占四之一。又其一爲地質調查所。</p>
<p>每一部。有大幅重要物產地圖。有大幅產量統計圖表。鑛產室更有滿蒙大地圖模型。用電光表明重要鑛產所在地與其產額。每種產物有詳細之説明。</p>
<p>日本不產鐵。所用鋼鐵。向由長江流域及南洋馬來半島輸入。他們對於南滿產鐵。推定埋藏量至少有十二萬萬噸。尤可寳貴者。推定同地如撫順本溪。新邱等處尙有煤二十五萬萬噸。足充精鍊十二萬萬噸鋼鐵之用。可供日本需用七十年。現鞍山製鐵所年可出鐵二十萬噸。本溪湖製鐵所年可出鐵十二萬噸。撫順年出煤七百四十萬噸以上。本溪湖年出煤五十萬噸。遼湯縣屬之烟台年出煤十萬噸。其他各地未列計。</p>

<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>（五）我的失望</p>
<p>我們離了第四分署。霍桑把汽車送我回家。在汽車中時。我們重新談以這個問題。我因向霍桑道。「這個人委實陰險可惡。我們若不能把他找着。給他一種相當報復。那委實是我們的奇恥大辱。試想他如果在朋友面前談起。我們二人將被看做怎様人物呢。」霍桑點頭道。「是啊。但事的勝負。在最後一着。你姑且放心。我想我們這一次的喫虧。不致於就此罷手的。我道。「這個人此番利用他的智詐。把我們愚弄。據我料想。他一定是我們的敵人。從前在什麽地主喫過我們的虧。現在設計報復。你以爲如何。」霍桑低垂着頭。緩緩應道。「這當然是一種很可能的理解。」我道。「如此。未始不是一條線索。我們但從信方面去找尋好了。」我説了這句。連忙住口。自己覺得我的説話未免太覺空泛。我們有幾個仇敵呢。我們自己可能知道麽。眼前這個敵人。究竟在那一案結的怨。我們怎様能想得到呢。幸虧霍桑似在那裏深思。我的話彷彿没有聽得。他沉吟了一會。才仰面説道。「我以爲除了報復以外。還有一種緣因—且慢。這個人你不是親眼見過的麽。」我答道。「正是。我如果再瞧見他。一定指認得出。」霍桑道。「那麽。當你在高家裏時。曾否見過這人。譬如他和什麽人同席。或和什麽人接近過的。你可還追想得出。」我連連搖頭道。「我完全没有注意到。連這個人我曾否在高家裏見過。我也不敢自信。」霍桑頓了一頓。又問我道。「那麽。你姑且説説。這個人穿什麽衣服。」我道。「他穿一件方格條紋的灰色春呢外褂。頭上戴一頂深棕色的銅盆帽。」霍桑縐了縐眉。又道。「裏面的衣裳你没有瞧見麽。」我道。「我瞧見的。他穿的一條栗殼色的褲子。」霍桑又停了目光。低頭尋思。我繼續道。「他的身材和我相彷。不過他的肩膞似乎没有和我這般闊大。」</p>

<h3 id="c196">中國之婚姻問題 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>「婚姻問題」在人生的三大問題中也是極其重要之一、無論在那一個國家、都成爲目前應該迫須解决的了、但是、人的事事物物又没有這様的單純、尤其是急擬解决的事到最後是永不能解决、這已成形一般的形態、即在任何國家裏、關於婚姻問題的專論書籍、都是佔着書肆中最主要的地位、而且、在偉大的著名的文藝作口上、藝術作品上、以及電影戲劇上、其内容的重要點、無處不足不表現婚姻的緊迫、這原因、當然也很簡單、如作者在導言裏説、「從縱的方面説、因禮俗或文化的變遷、婚姻制度有許多變革、自横的方面説、因爲各個人的心性和社會的環境關係複雜、關於結婚離婚不容易得到圓滿的結果、而且是常常的不能得到圓滿的結果、因此、婚姻問題不僅在各國社會問題中間居主要的地位、而且彷彿是永久不能解决的問題、」</p>
<p>這説的確很妥切、尤其在中國的社會裏、我們祇要留心日常出版的各大報紙及定期刋物、便能知道、關於婚姻不能圓滿解决的問題是隨處可以發現、其最形主要的原因、是爲了近幾十年來、我國因爲海通之後、歐洲的新文化正式輸入、固有的文化起了重大的變化、直至五四運動的暴發、新舊制度都陷於矛盾之中、在這個過渡的期間、社會中各項問題、自然會要緊迫起來要求解决、那麽、婚姻問題就是最緊迫而須解决的了、所以、「解决婚姻問題的呼聲、如怒潮掀起、布滿全國、近年來自國民革命高潮廣被全國之後、新的標準、漸漸地成立、可是舊標準還是努力爲存在的企圖、因此、婚姻問題之緊迫、與日俱進、而且是有加無已、」婚姻問題旣是這様的重要、但是中國的一般學者、却不加以注意、甚至對於此項有關男女的問題大有不敢言説之概、張慰慈敎授、將此表述得極爲透澈、他説、</p>
<p>「中國的學者一天到晚講的是什麽性和理、他們是很莊嚴的很尊敬的人物、扳起了面孔、著他們的書、傳他們的道、立他們的言、至於人生最切要的男女問題、他們是不講、外國的學者可是不這様的、他們對於什麽事物、什麽現象者肯講的、並且講出來的話、又是高人一等、往往能夠講人家所講不出的、或不敢説的話、關於男女婚姻愛情等類的問題、他們確有很多至理名言、雖則有時候他們的話也未多太過火一些、可是他們的話都是從心裏説出來的、立論的觀點、又是很特别的、他們確實能夠老老實實的心裏怎様想、筆下就怎様寫、不比我們中國的道學先生在人面前滿口仁義通德、在人背後無所不爲、筆下寫出的東西完全不是他們心裏所想的、」在本書作者、也有鑒於此點、即形成了這様的一本值得注意的討論中國婚姻問題的專著、全書計分十一章、現將其力爲分析於下、</p>
<p>第一章導言、是説明婚姻問題緊迫的各種原因、由國民黨治下的婦女地位的提高、要求和男子受同様的平等、不甘受禮敎的壓迫、更不甘受男子的壓迫、然而、中國人的結婚、内容者是没有愛、從前一般人、根本不知「愛情」是什麽、結婚是什麽、所以没有什麽問題的發生、近年來、大多數青年已覺無愛情的結合、已不行了、不能容忍了、於是、男女社交公開就驀然地開始了、因此、在現社會裏、又產生許多衝突的現象、有的强迫爲「無愛情的結婚、」有的「有愛情而不得結婚、」這様、就在無形之中釀成我國婚姻問題的緊迫、况且、我國社會是反對離婚的社會、一經結合、不論好壞、永久不許離異、近年來所產生的許多離婚的事件及自敎的問題、大半因此所造成的、最後、中國還有一種所謂大家庭的制度、祇顧家族的利益、不注意個人婚姻的美滿、亦阻碍個人與愛人的眞正的幸福、作者在這様詳述之下、足見婚姻問題在中國緊迫的一斑、至於婚姻問題的内容、據普通所謂、不外結婚前的問題及結婚後的問題、結婚前的是訂婚、而訂婚問題之中又包括訂婚的條件問題、主婚權的問題、訂婚的法律上之要件及撤消、訂婚的儀式種種問題、結婚後的問題、包括结婚的儀式、夫婦愛情的維繫及反目、子女的姓氏、夫婦的姓氏、以及離婚、别居、遺棄、再醮等等問題、關於此、研究社會問題的人都有注意的必要、不過應該留心於事實、而不應該專憑理想、在此、本書作者是集中搜羅關於婚姻記載的材料、極有系統、包括上述各種問題、也可以作歷史上的參資、</p>
<p>第二章婚姻的意義與訂婚的條件、是述中國婚姻歡念的一般的錯誤、大家不看重婚姻、所謂「婚姻大事、」也不過云爲「婚姻者、所以承業而繼後嗣者也、」這可以説是我們民族中一種歷史上的惡根</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>性、本來在任何國家、祇要是他的歷史上有「父權家庭」還存在、那麽兒女的幸福、就可以不必問了、在中國、從前做父母的對於子女的婚姻雖重視、但那種先以之命令、後繼之媒妁、實在根本的錯誤、作者在此、是想討論出一個婚姻的眞意義究竟是什麽來、對於戀愛之道旣有詳細的研求、怎様訂婚也加以解説、兩性的結合、完全應該以戀愛爲基礎、訂婚當然没有什麽條件、理論上雖然如此、而事實上却條件許多、作者以客觀的眼光、詳爲分析、頗值我們的研究、子女的環境應付、父母與子女的婚姻應該如何、均有論及、　　第三章結婚的儀式、從中國古代的所謂「六禮」説起以至文明結婚的儀式、在此之中、探求出一個較好的儀式、以作結婚者的參助、以作者的意見、是主張用「廣告或書面通知法」、其次是開一個「祝</p>
<p>賀的茶話會」、是最經濟最合宜於現社會的一種辦法、</p>
<p>第四章戀愛的維持與破壞、是將夫婦間很複雜的情形作一種解釋「維持愛情的秘訣」、是值得注意的一節、其次、怎様對付没有愛情的妻子、爲求終身的幸福、當然不能屈服於中國的舊環境之下、再如貞操、也是重要的問題之一、在婚姻問題裏、</p>
<p>第五章早婚與晚婚、是説明它底利弊、並將各國關於結婚的法定年齡、加以圖解、是極有意義的、中國民法還主完全頒布之前、當然没有結婚年齡之規定、但歷代以來法制上的結婚年齡、也有詳細的引列、這様地作一種比較的研究、那「適當的婚年、」便有以明瞭了、</p>
<p>第六章變例的婚姻、這是指我國的婚姻而言、是除了通常的婚姻之外、還有許多變例的婚姻、如贅壻、指腹婚與童養媳、望門寡、再醮、重婚、兩頭大及兼祧五種、娶妾本來也是變例的婚姻、不過現在法律上並不承認蓄妾爲婚姻之一種、故作者在另外列爲專篇、在此未有詳加討論、</p>
<p>第六章蓄妾問題、這是極形重要的、此次盛大的國民會議中、他有此項方案的提議、足見蓄妾制在目前却是急須解决的問題、作者在此所述、是從中國的歷史觀點上加以考察、蓄妾制度與後嗣問題及其救濟方法、均有評論、並有妾爲家長族服圖、以資參考、</p>
<p>第八章離婚問題、這在現社會中已成爲最普遍的一種現象、作者是從學理上作離婚的根據説起、「七出與三不出、」是以法律爲解釋的根據、「中國的離婚法、」是依據民法草案、對於離婚、取兩種態度、（一）夫婦恊議離婚、（二）法律上的限制離婚、這本章裏均有深切的説明了、</p>
<p>第九章婚姻與法律、第十章婚姻問題解决、第十一章餘論、都是婚姻問題的價值論、堪以我們作探求的南針、</p>
<p>這本書、據作者自己説、雖不敢言之爲婚姻問題上的至理名言、可是可以説心裏怎様想筆下就怎様寫、或者也有一二是人家所講不出、或者人家所不敢講的話、至少也有些是道學先生所講不出所不敢講的、此書所偉大的是此一點、所爲現代一般有科學頭腦的讀者所需要、也是爲此一點、</p>

<p>(1) Reading of the minutes of the fourth meeting.</p>
<p>(2) Report of the Review Committee. Dai Chuanxian reported on three points: 1. The Proposal Review Committee must proceed swiftly with the review of proposals.

If the Proposal Review Committee believes that a proposal submitted by a representative should be established, it shall be sent to the specialized committee for review, formulate measures, and report to the Congress for discussion. As long as the general direction is correct, it may be passed to save procedures. 3. The original copy of the Provisional Constitution should be sent to the National Government by this Congress for promulgation on a scheduled date.

<h3 id="e4">Discussion Items <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(1) Industrial Construction Procedure Proposal. When the fifth congress discussed the proposal, representatives debated at length on the timing of completion of various railways due to regional considerations. Many representatives spoke again at this congress. Chairman Jiang of the National Government added that construction of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway would begin after the completion of the Beijing-Guangdong Railway, and construction of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway would begin after the completion of the Longhai Railway, so that the transportation construction of the Southwest could be developed as much as possible. Representative Hu Jianzhong drafted the wording of the resolution. Presidium member Dai Chuanxian explained and read the resolution drafted by Hu Jianzhong. The chairman then put it to a vote, and it passed by a majority vote. The resolution is as follows: (Resolution) The Congress believes that the Industrial Construction Procedure Proposal put forward by the National Government is sufficient to fully express the National Government's determination and sincerity in developing the national economy. However, this kind of specialized plan cannot be decided hastily, and this Congress is the highest expression of the will of the national people. If it makes decisions on various specialized plans, it is difficult to avoid omissions in the enumeration of events, and the determination of time limits may be too restrictive. Now that this Congress has entrusted the responsibility of exercising governance to the National Government, this kind of practical plan should be completely entrusted to the National Government, with full attention and effort, to be determined and implemented. As for the financial resources required for construction, since the national people have decided to vigorously carry out construction, those who have the ability should cooperate with the government to support it. (Addendum) The additional opinions submitted in writing by the Chairman of the National Government after the conclusion of the discussion, and the records of the speeches of the representatives of the southwestern provinces on this proposal, are copied and sent to the National Government for consideration and adoption.</p>
<p>(2) Draft resolution on the report of the National Government on the suppression of bandits. (Review Report) He Yingqin explained that in accordance with the resolution of the Congress, the review of the case regarding the report of the National Government on the suppression of bandits was carried out at 3:00 PM on the 13th. Those present were Li Zhishan, He Siyuan, Niu Yongjian, Cai Yuanpei, Ding Weifen, Wu Jingheng, Wang Shijie, Liu Luyin, He Yingqin, He Jian, Jin Enqi, He Chengjun, and others, totaling twelve people. Also present were Liu Zhenqun and Cheng Boren, totaling two people. After being approved by the presidium, 1. Fu Xiangrong and others proposed "The case of earnestly suppressing bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and the national soldiers should unanimously express their assistance." 2. Fu Xiangrong and others proposed the case of "The troops suppressing bandits, it is appropriate to clear the source of the disease, in order</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>to achieve rapid results," and the opinions of representatives Liu Zhensheng, Cheng Boren, Liu Zuozhou, Wang Qi, Xiang Yujie, Ning Kun, and others on this proposal were reviewed together. It was unanimously agreed that the Congress should discuss and resolve the matter to draw the attention of the people of the whole country. After summarizing the report of the National Government and adopting the opinions of the representatives, a resolution of the Congress on the report of the National Government on the suppression of bandits was drafted. Is it appropriate? Please make a public decision. After the explanation, Chairman Yu Youren read the full text of the resolution, announced the vote, and it was unanimously passed. After a five-minute break, the meeting continued.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting overseas Chinese investment to develop domestic industry, effectively protecting overseas Chinese, and providing relief to the unemployed to alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese (proposed by the Proposal Review Committee). The proposer, Chen Zhaoqi, explained that he proposed this proposal not from the standpoint of overseas Chinese, but to realize the Prime Minister's industrial plan. The efforts of overseas Chinese in the revolutionary process can be proven by the revolutionary history of the past forty years. The Prime Minister once said that overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution. During the period of destruction, the common efforts of overseas comrades have been obtained. Now, in the period of construction, we especially need the assistance of overseas Chinese. The money earned by overseas Chinese over the years with blood and sweat has been supplied to the motherland in very large quantities. The national economy has always relied on it for support. If we further find ways to promote and make them happy to invest and engage in the development of domestic industry to increase the strength of the national economy, the Prime Minister's industrial plan can be realized soon. In the past, overseas Chinese did not dare to return to the country to invest. 1. Due to the endless domestic wars, 2. Due to the lack of adequate protection. Now the country is unified, and the purpose of the National Congress is to solve construction problems, so I made this proposal. At the same time, the problem of the high price of gold and the low price of silver can also be adequately solved. Zeng Jikuan, Chen Anren, Tian Kunshan, and others spoke successively. The resolution was passed in principle and handed over to the National Government to properly formulate measures and implement them earnestly. (4) Unemployment Relief Proposal (proposed by the Proposal Review Committee). Resolution: passed in principle and handed over to the National Government to properly formulate measures and implement them earnestly.</p>
<p>(5) Earnestly relieving the silk and tea industries (proposed by the Proposal Review Committee). Resolution: passed in principle and handed over to the National Government for consideration.</p>
<p>(6) Request to establish a translation bureau, and request to establish a national translation bureau to translate textbooks for primary and secondary schools and academic monographs to promote culture. Resolution: handed over to the National Government.</p>
<p>At this point, all the proposals listed on today's agenda have been discussed.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Provisional Motions <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Congress declares that the whole country supports peaceful unification (proposed by 150 representatives including Yan Baohang). Resolution: The proposal is established and handed over to the Secretariat to organize the text and report to the Congress on the 15th (unanimously stood up).</p>
<p>(2) Issuing a stern warning to Chen Jitang to urge him to repent in order to preserve peaceful unification (proposed by more than 310 people including Mao Yifeng).</p>
<p>Resolution: The general idea was passed. The text of the warning telegram was handed over to the Secretariat to draft and report to the Congress tomorrow.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 12:00 (Special dispatch on the 14th).</p>
<h3 id="e6">Contents of Provisional Motions <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The content of the case of the Fujian representative Mao Yifeng's provisional motion to issue a stern warning to Chen Jitang in the name of the Congress, according to what was heard at the meeting place, is roughly divided into three paragraphs: First, it states that the National Revolution struggled for seven or eight years before finally achieving the national unification status of today. The sacrifices of the people during this period have been significant. It dares to declare that from now on, internal wars that hinder peaceful unification and construction progress should absolutely not be allowed to happen. It then states that Chen Jitang is a Central Government appointed official. If he is dissatisfied with the Central Government's facilities, he may, as a party member or national citizen, submit a petition for resolution through legal procedures. Finally, it states that the bandits in Jiangxi are still not pacified, and the communists in various places are resurrecting everywhere. If a dispute is lightly started, it will only create an opportunity for the communists. Based on the above three points, it requests that Chen Jitang and others be warned to pay serious attention. The wording is still subject to revision (Special dispatch on the 14th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Liaoning representative Yan Baohang's provisional motion, in the name of the Congress, declares to the whole country that it supports peaceful unification and strives for construction, is the common opinion of the representatives of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Chahar, and Rehe.

<h3 id="e7">Telegram Warning Chen Jitang <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Congress's telegram warning Chen Jitang was drafted on the evening of the 14th. After discussion and revision by the presidium, it was completed. It is over a thousand words long and is scheduled to be submitted to the Congress on the 15th. The general idea is that Chen, as a party member and holding important positions in the military, should obey the party's resolutions and strictly abide by military discipline. He must not act freely and disrupt peace. Moreover, Guangdong, with its corner of the country, is resisting the central government. The outcome of victory or defeat does not require divination. Finally, it states that Chiang is the chairman of the National Government, and opposing Chiang is opposing the central government (Special dispatch on the 14th).</p>

<h3 id="e14">Resolution on the Suppression of Bandits <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the National Congress's resolution on the National Government's report on the suppression of bandits is as follows:</p>
<p>After listening to the National Government's report on the suppression of bandits, the Congress deeply understands that the National Government has never slightly abandoned its responsibility to suppress bandits in the midst of years of pacifying warlords. The reason why the bandits have not been completely eliminated as scheduled is that they externally attract red imperialism to issue instructions, internally take advantage of the successive rebellions of past warlords to conspire to grow stronger, and our people's livelihood is withered, knowledge is immature, and social organization is fragile, which gives them opportunities to take advantage of everywhere. In the midst of the difficulties and hardships encountered by the National Government in the past, it can still fight against the rebels and suppress bandits, taking care of both sides, so that the bandits' power is increasingly exhausted, and the disaster of prairie fire cannot spread. Its difficulties and hardships are enough to arouse our sigh of relief, comfort, and sympathy.</p>
<p>After comprehensively reviewing the report of the National Government and confirming the various facts of the bandits' scourge, the Congress believes that the responsibility and work of eradicating bandits rely on the joint efforts of the national people and the government. The harm of bandits is indeed as mentioned in the National Government's bandit suppression report. It is not only enough to subvert our country's political system, but also enough to destroy our country's society, cut off our people's livelihood, eliminate our country's population, and endanger the survival of our nation. This is a common disaster for the people of the whole country, and it must be broken through by the cooperation of the whole country from top to bottom. It must not be relied on solely on the National Army's suppression, or only on the local provincial government's local efforts, to be able to eradicate it with ease, as in the past. The National Government has always been determined to thoroughly eliminate bandits, and the military and administrative officials of various provinces are also not allowed to slack in their duties of preventing and suppressing bandits. The entire country must be aware of the poison and crimes of bandits, and everyone must take responsibility for eliminating the red disaster and eliminating bandits, thereby giving the central and local military and administrative authorities the greatest cooperation and assistance. Only then will it be possible to rescue the people who are currently being ravaged by bandits and eliminate the great disaster of the future of the Chinese nation. The Congress believes that the National Government's report on bandit suppression proposes the request to assist in eradicating bandits from the whole country. Its reasons are very detailed and solemn. Here, this Congress unanimously approves its proposal. Now, based on this purpose, the task of the national people assisting the government in eradicating bandits is determined, and its meaning is explained as a standard for the future joint efforts of the national people.</p>
<p>First, it must be deeply understood that the poison and crimes of bandits and the existence and spread of bandits are incompatible with the survival and development of the Chinese nation. This meaning is undoubtedly beyond doubt. It must be known that bandits are a mixture of red imperialism and bandits. As evidenced by the National Government's report and the facts of our observations over the years, red imperialism has been planning and conducting its red militarism and red capitalism aggression against our northeastern provinces and Mongolia and Xinjiang from the beginning. The purpose of the implementation of these two aggression plans is to annex Chinese territory to join the red federal territory and seize Chinese resources to fill the desires of red capitalists. Today, the situation of these two aggressions has grown into a snake formation, winding and extending. It will be the biggest foreign disaster for the future of China, which is already known to the world. In order to ensure that this aggression plan can be implemented without obstruction, red imperialism simultaneously protects the Chinese Communist Party and the red bandits in Jiangxi, Hunan, and other places, causing them to disrupt our country's society, destroy our country's economy, and incite our country's internal strife in the hope that the whole country from top to bottom will have no time to pay attention to its conspiracy against my northeastern and northwestern border provinces, and even have no strength to resist its actual aggression. Therefore, bandits, whose external form is a mixture of red imperialism and bandits, will actually be the eruption point of internal strife and foreign disasters in China's future. Today, its scourge in Jiangxi and Hunan has made the land abandoned, the fields full of hungry dead, the villages without intact houses, and the markets without pedestrians. Its poison and crimes cannot be compared to the accumulated evils of past white imperialist warlords, bureaucrats, local tyrants, evil gentry, rogues, and hooligans. If the people of the whole country want to find a way to save themselves and the country, they must take knowing the poison and evil of this kind of bandit as the first essential.</p>
<p>Second, the spread of bandits' ideas, words, and publications must be cut off. The plan of red imperialism to plot against China is to carry out military and economic aggression in the border areas on the one hand, and to protect the evil forces of bandits to harm our inland on the other hand, as mentioned above. However, the way to protect bandits relies on material enticement on the one hand, and on the propaganda of red banditry on the other hand. The two are used in conjunction with each other, which makes a part of unscrupulous people provide for its drive. Therefore, if we want to eliminate the scourge of bandits, we must cut off its material supply on the one hand, and cut off the spread of its ideas on the other hand. The former should be the result of the government's efforts, and the latter should be done by the people and the government together. The propaganda of red banditry will not be effective if it only relies on the government's prohibition. The people of the whole country must make a decision to cut off the spread of bandits' ideas, and automatically prohibit the dissemination of its propaganda products on the one hand, and strive to understand and publicize the Three People's Principles on the other hand, to establish the faith of our people in China's inherent spiritual civilization and modern scientific civilization. Only in this way can the poison of bandits' ideas and words be eliminated. People in the country do not understand and often misunderstand the true meaning of freedom, thinking that all ideas and words, regardless of whether they are harmful to the country, society, and individuals, should be allowed to spread freely without prohibition. However, the freedom of ideas and words in a country cannot exceed the spirit of establishing the country and the basic principles of social ethics. Although Britain and the United States are countries that firmly believe in freedom, their freedom of ideas and words will never allow it to invade the scope of endangering the state, overthrowing the government, destroying society, and disrupting order. Since China takes the Three People's Principles as the center of building the country, reforming society, and even developing the national economy, the basic principles of social ethics and the spirit of establishing the country must be based on this, which is beyond doubt. If, in addition to this, the doctrine and propaganda that bandits rely on to confuse people's minds, disrupt society, destroy the political system, and endanger the country are allowed to spread freely without prohibition, this is actually a way of self-destruction, and it cannot be justified by the meaning of freedom. The Congress deeply feels that this meaning has not been understood, which has led the people of the country to know that the ideas and words of bandits have an unfavorable impact on the country, society, and people, and they are still wandering in the mentality of misunderstanding freedom on weekdays, maintaining the old state of hesitation and complacency, and not engaging in universal prohibition, which has made the ideas and words of bandits able to invade the country, confuse the will of the people, and gradually make the people of the country lose sight of the avenue that the nation should follow for self-salvation and self-preservation. It is really sighing to talk about this. From now on, the people of the whole country must take the Three People's Principles as the central idea of self-salvation and saving the country. All bandits' ideas and words that are incompatible with the personal life, social life, and national survival of our people, and even the literature and theories that they spread, should be automatically prohibited by the group's efforts, so that the people's will can be unified and the social order can be stabilized, to engage in the construction of a new China of the Three People's Principles. Only the ideas of the Three People's Principles can eliminate the ideas of bandits. Only when the faith in this idea is established can the bandits hidden in our hearts be eliminated. This is another important meaning for the people of the whole country to fundamentally eliminate bandits by cutting off the spread of bandits' ideas and words and their propaganda products.</p>
<p>Third, parents or school authorities must be responsible for correcting and restraining young men and women who are confused by bandits and fall into wrong paths. Young men and women are the new life of a country, and those who are responsible for education must not hold a laissez-faire attitude and allow young men and women to be sacrificed by bandits without rescuing them. The poisonous plan of red imperialism to destroy our nation is to poison young men and women with ideological and material temptations, so that they destroy families and mutilate their bodies. In the areas ravaged by bandits, men and women from the age of eight to forty are threatened to engage in various cruel and violent work of burning, killing, raping, and looting. These facts have been clearly stated in the National Government's report on bandit suppression, and our people are also familiar with them. If the trend of poisoning young people and mutilating life is not corrected, then the life of our nation will inevitably be cut off. For the sake of continuing the life of the nation and protecting the lives of young men and women, parents and school authorities must take responsibility for restraining and correcting young men and women, so that those who have gone astray can repent, and those who have not been incited can be guided by responsible parents, teachers, and friends, and achieve their sound development. Once the education of the minds and bodies of young men and women is correct, then the evil trend of bandits that harm themselves and others will have no way to enter, and the poisonous flames of bandits will be extinguished without being extinguished. Therefore, the people of the whole country must take guiding young men and women on the right track as another important meaning if they want to fundamentally eliminate bandits (to be continued).</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Zhaoqi proposed the case of promoting overseas Chinese investment to develop domestic industry, effectively protecting overseas Chinese, and providing relief to the unemployed to alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese (reasons). Overseas Chinese compatriots are skilled in business and have a long history of development of domestic resources.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Paul Doumer Elected President of France <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>In this French presidential election, Aristide Briand's sudden failure shocked both domestic and foreign observers, considering it an unexpected outcome. According to reports from Paris, Laval declared that Briand's defeat would affect the entire cabinet. Some even suggested that Briand, sensing the instability of his position, aimed to disengage from external affairs, thus abandoning his campaign. Others speculated that France's foreign policy might undergo changes, while some worried that Briand's departure from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would diminish the chances of success for France's Pan-European conference policy. These viewpoints reflected a pessimistic outlook. However, an alternative perspective emerged, asserting that the election of Paul Doumer as president was precisely intended to allow Briand to remain in his diplomatic post for an extended period. Consequently, factions within the government reportedly assisted Doumer's candidacy. Laval further declared that the election outcome should not be interpreted as a rejection of the government's foreign policy, which consistently received parliamentary approval. Following the customary cabinet resignation, Briand would be requested to retain his position, a prospect he had already signaled his willingness to consider. This narrative suggested that Briand's failure to secure the presidency was unrelated to the political situation. While optimistic arguments were prevalent, it was the general consensus that Briand's continued presence was vital for France, especially at a time when its diplomatic affairs were in flux. The authorities would likely refrain from making hasty changes to their foreign policy, and Briand, prioritizing the nation's future, would likely be reluctant to relinquish his diplomatic role. This perspective appeared the more credible of the two.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The promotion of industry depends entirely on the energetic advancement of overseas Chinese returning to the country. This is something known to all Chinese people. However, in recent years, domestic turmoil has caused many overseas Chinese investors to hesitate, mainly due to the lack of adequate guarantees and preferential treatment. It is understandable that they would be discouraged. Moreover, since the European War, overseas Chinese have been subjected to oppression by Westerners and competition from the Japanese. The law of natural selection, survival of the fittest, has caused overseas compatriots to lose their inherent advantageous position, leading to bankruptcies and unemployment. They are struggling to make ends meet and have no time to take care of themselves. Furthermore, the domestic government lacks appropriate relief measures. This is another reason why overseas Chinese have been unable to invest in the country as much as possible. Now that the military has been pacified and everything needs to be rebuilt, the Premier's industrial plan should be implemented as soon as possible. Attracting wealthy overseas Chinese to invest in the country is a crucial task that cannot be delayed. I believe that past events and the current situation indicate that if we want to encourage overseas Chinese to invest enthusiastically, the government should send personnel to various places to sincerely promote and explain the benefits and drawbacks to overseas Chinese. This will surely enable them to return resolutely and work together for construction. At the same time, the government should provide practical protection for overseas compatriots and especially provide relief to overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs and returned to the country. The above two measures should be carried out in tandem to encourage overseas compatriots to make determined efforts and alleviate their personal suffering. With no concerns about advancing or retreating, they will naturally be happy to support national construction. This is the key to resolving the overseas Chinese issue today. (Methods) 1. The Ministry of Industry should send personnel to various overseas locations to investigate the current state of overseas Chinese businesses, paying particular attention to the causes of their rise and fall, as a basis for providing relief and guidance. 2. The Ministry of Industry should send personnel to various overseas locations to sincerely promote to overseas Chinese, explaining the credibility of the government and the interests of the nation, and urging them to return to invest in the country, in order to realize the Premier's industrial plan. 3. The Ministry of Navy should, within its capabilities, send warships to the locations of overseas Chinese communities every year to comfort and protect them. (Note) One of the reasons why overseas Chinese are oppressed in foreign countries is the lack of protection from their home country's strength. British overseas Chinese in Annam number less than fifty, and Japanese overseas Chinese are only around a hundred, but both Britain and Japan send warships to the ports every year to comfort overseas Chinese. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, our country has sent warships to Annam, but we have not seen the flags of our navy fluttering on the banks of the Mekong River since then. Now that I hear that the Ministry of Navy plans to send warships to comfort overseas Chinese, I hope that the National Government will quickly adopt this measure. 4. The National Government should quickly establish an agency to introduce unemployed overseas Chinese returning to the country, in order to settle unemployed overseas Chinese or overseas Chinese who have been oppressed and returned to the country.

<h3 id="e18">Proposal to Establish a Translation and Compilation Bureau <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(1) Proposal by Liu Zongxiang and Others</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zongxiang and Gao Jinzhang propose the rapid establishment of a National Translation and Compilation Bureau to translate and compile textbooks for primary and secondary schools, as well as academic monographs, in order to promote culture. (Reasons) It is found that in various countries, textbooks are invariably compiled and published nationwide by educators themselves, in accordance with educational purposes, with low prices and significant results. Therefore, education is developed and popularized. In our country, textbooks for schools at all levels are mostly edited by people hired by publishing companies and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and publication. Thus, textbooks have become the sole enterprise of publishing companies. Entrusting this important task to the hands of business merchants deprives the country of its cultivation efforts, while merchants open up avenues for profit-seeking, manipulating and controlling, causing many mistakes. Now that we are implementing Party ideology education and practicing the Three Principles of the People, in order to cultivate students as good citizens who can save the country, it is difficult to arbitrarily determine whether the textbooks for primary and secondary schools are generally in line with the current educational purposes. It is imperative that the state reclaim this task and have it compiled by the Translation and Compilation Bureau, so that the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People and the theory of knowing is easy but doing is difficult can be thoroughly implemented in accordance with the curriculum. Only then can the thoughts of young students gradually become pure, and the implementation of Party ideology education will be twice as effective with half the effort. This is the most important thing that cannot be ignored. In addition, academic monographs are of great importance to culture. Various countries have published numerous famous works, but our country has translated very few of them. The surviving works of former sages and modern works in the country are increasing without decreasing. It is also imperative to search and collect them. This is also a monumental undertaking of the Translation and Compilation Bureau, an immortal event. (Methods) The Ministry of Education should establish a Translation and Compilation Bureau, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Education and is responsible for management and operation. The Translation and Compilation Bureau is divided into two sections: one section translates and compiles textbooks, and the other section translates and compiles academic monographs. Educational and academic experts from various provinces are hired to serve as editors, ensuring that everyone can use their talents to the fullest. A printing house and a sales office are also established to specialize in publishing and sales matters. Then, the development of cultural undertakings in the future cannot be measured by distance. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(2) Proposal by Peng Daquan and Others</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Peng Daquan and others propose the establishment of a Translation and Compilation Bureau to promote science education. (Reasons) Our country's science is backward, and all undertakings cannot be revitalized. The progress of various construction projects in the future relies heavily on the promotion of science education. However, if we want to promote science education, we must emulate foreign countries, and reading foreign original books is a common fact in middle and high schools in China today. Even people in society who want to study science must first master foreign languages. The effort is doubled, and the loss of time, energy, and money is incalculable. Moreover, modern science is changing rapidly, and we must have the spirit of "catching up head-on." However, due to language barriers, the latest theories and recent inventions are not widely known by the people of our country. Therefore, translating and compiling books is the most urgent and important task to promote our country's culture. Only by gathering scholars and specialists to devote themselves to this task can we achieve success. In the past, our country's achievements in Buddhism and modern Japan's achievements in science were both due to the translation and compilation bureaus. Today, we urgently need to learn from the strengths of Europe and America. The only strength of Europe and America lies in science. Therefore, the establishment of a Translation and Compilation Bureau is an urgent situation. (Methods) It should be hosted by the Ministry of Education or the National Central Research Institute.

<h3 id="e19">Shi Zhiying's Proposal to Relieve Unemployed Workers <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Zhiying proposes a plan to relieve unemployed workers. (Reasons) The unemployment problem is an important issue of people's livelihood. On a small scale, it is related to personal happiness, and on a large scale, it affects social stability. From a passive perspective, once the unemployed lose their ability to produce, they will inevitably increase the social burden. From an active perspective, the desperation of bandits and thieves, as well as the commission of crimes and rebellions, are all caused by the loss of living resources and the desperation of hunger and cold. Therefore, the unemployment relief problem is not only a fundamental problem of our people's livelihood, but also a problem that needs to be solved urgently all over the world, especially for workers. Our country's industry and commerce are declining day by day, and unemployment is frequently heard. In the developed industrial and commercial countries of Europe and America, unemployment is increasing, but other countries have overproduction and sluggish sales, resulting in factories laying off employees and reducing wages, causing workers to become unemployed. In our country, however, due to insufficient production and the smooth sales of foreign goods, industry and commerce have been devastated, and the laboring class has also suffered as a result. As for the laboring workers, they usually have no reserves at home and no food for the night. Once they lose their jobs, not only is there no way to provide relief, but they are also left to die. This situation, which affects personal life, is small, but it is very important to the national economy and people's livelihood. It goes without saying that the country should find ways to provide relief. This is the reason for submitting this proposal. (Methods) (1) The National Government should instruct the provincial governments to allocate 20% of the construction funds to establish large-scale basic industries owned by the state in order to relieve unemployed workers (such as steel, wool, and silk factories). (2) The government should conduct worker unemployment registration and investigate worker unemployment status as soon as possible. (3) Each county should establish simple factories to relieve unemployed workers in various places. (4) Vigorously implement worker supplementary education, improve worker knowledge, and reduce the risk of unemployment. (5) The government should quickly carry out public works, such as building roads and improving water conservancy, in order to accommodate unemployed workers. (6) The government should first establish public job placement agencies in urban areas to adjust worker unemployment. (14th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Qian Sunqing and 68 other representatives of Jiangsu merchants submitted a proposal to the government requesting the government to clarify the nature of the consolidated tax and business tax and to establish principles. After the General Assembly handed it over for review, the fifth General Assembly yesterday submitted the report of the proposal review, listing this case as one that did not need to be submitted to the meeting. The original proposer then inquired in writing to Peng Jiqun, the convener of the proposal review committee, requesting the reasons. The original letter stated: Dear Sir, Today's General Assembly submitted the second report of the Proposal Review Committee, (1) Two items that do not need to be submitted to the meeting, (2) The proposal to request the government to clarify the nature of the consolidated tax and business tax and to establish principles, did not have any reasons. It is found that this case was compiled by our representatives based on the opinions of commercial groups in various places and based on the case of abolishing likin, the principles resolved at the likin abolition conference in 1928, and organized into a case. According to Article 42 of the Rules of Procedure, it was submitted by more than one-tenth of the total number of representatives. National tax rules are related to the burden of the people. In European and American countries, they are passed by the people's power organs. Although our country is in the period of political tutelage, at the time of the National Congress, it is also appropriate to have the General Assembly determine the principles and announce them to the people of the country, so that they know that taking from the people has a system and that superiors and subordinates abide by it together. Now that new taxes are being created, they are not perfect, and the methods in various places are not uniform, which need not be concealed. This case is of great importance to national unified construction and does not conflict with the scope of the Outline of National Construction, the Outline of National Construction, the Three Principles of the People, and the declaration of the First National Congress. The merchants and people in various places are suffering deeply and have high expectations for this case. Please copy and record the reasons why this case should not be submitted to the meeting and give a clear reply. Even if you have difficulties and cannot give a definite reply, our representatives have this letter, which can also be excused. Respectfully waiting for orders, (omitted below).

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3 id="e41">He Chengjun and Others Send a Circular Telegram Denouncing Gu and Chen <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun and others sent a circular telegram saying, "All newspapers have seen the telegram of Deng Zheru, Gu Yingfen, and 30 others, spreading rumors, venting extreme emotions, and confusing the public. At first, we thought it was emotional impulse and they had not thought deeply. We thought they would not be insane and plotting to endanger the Party and the country. But after the Jiang telegram from Cai, Zhang, and other comrades, and the Winter telegram from Comrade Wu repeatedly advised them with gentle words, they still did not know shame or repentance. On the contrary, they instigated Chen Jitang and others to join forces and send a telegram of intimidation. With such a hidden agenda, it is difficult to tolerate them any longer. Commander-in-Chief Jiang endured hardships and humiliation, pacified the country, promoted prosperity, and made great achievements. The whole country deeply relies on him. Who can bear to doubt and slander him? In the past, there were occasional differences of opinion with Zhan Gong, but he still paid close attention to friendship and did not bear any legal responsibility. Even if they were preoccupied with grievances and took the opportunity to criticize and impeach him, they should still strictly abide by the procedures and wait for the supervisors to hold a meeting to resolve the matter. But first they attacked each other in telegrams, and then they relied on force. They had no intention of protecting the Party or loving the country, and they were secretly plotting to raise troops and cause chaos. It has become clear. Chen Jitang has been protecting himself with troops for a long time and has been thinking of occupying Guangdong as his private property. Deng, Gu, and others covet undue ambitions and plan to rely on warlords, using public office for private gain. They do not think that the red bandits are poisoning the land, that the fire is hot and the water is deep, and that the long encirclement of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is about to close. If they have a little conscience, they should restrain their ambitions and avoid causing disputes, creating opportunities for bandits. However, they deliberately started the chaos, clearly using the familiar tactics of Shi Dian and Tang Feng to attract red bandits as friends. They do not care about the Party and the country, nor do they care about the people of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Even the tragedy of their hometown of Guangzhou and Hailufeng, they do not hesitate to repeat it. They are heartless, unreasonable, and acting against the tide. Not only are they difficult to tolerate by the whole country, but they should also be gnashed at by all the people of Guangdong. In the past, Long Jiguang, Lu Rongting, and others, as foreign warlords, used a few failures in Guangdong to oppose the Premier, and took the opportunity to invade, search, and trample. The previous coupons are vivid, and the giver is heartbroken. If the same mistakes are repeated and the door is opened to invite thieves, I know that the tragedy of Long and Lu will inevitably be a hundred times worse than before. The great desire of individuals has not been fulfilled, and the catastrophe of the homeland has arrived first. Even in terms of interests, it is also a great stupidity and unresponsiveness. As for the guarantee of good faith and peace, and the obedience to national laws and Party discipline, there is not enough to say deeply. Chengjun and others did not flatter Commander-in-Chief Jiang at first, nor did they have any old grudges with Deng, Gu, and others. They only love the Party and the country, driven by conscience, and cannot bear to use the poisonous ash of satire, with the heart of mending the sky and bathing the sun. I hope that the heroes in the sea and the virtuous people in the Party will hold the axe of Spring and Autumn, reveal the lungs and liver of the petty people, and jointly extend justice, so as to eliminate hidden worries. The future of political tutelage is deeply relied on. I cannot express my eagerness to wait for orders. He Chengjun, Li Mingzhong, Xu Yuanquan, Ji Hongchang, Fan Shisheng, Xia Douyin, Zhang Yinxiang, Xiao Zhichu, Qian Dajun, Chen Cheng, Luo Zhuoying, Zhang Zhenhan, Ge Yunlong, He Zhenfan, Xie Bin, Guo Runlian, Liu Peixu, Guo Xun, Zhao Guanying, Wang Zhaozong, Pan Shanzhai, Li Dingwu, Rong Jingfang, Xu Dezhao, and Sun Hongyi respectfully.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles are concerned with legal rights negotiations, not valuing Japan, and are still focusing on Britain and the United States. They are still continuing to work. The British Ambassador will soon re-enter Beijing to continue negotiations. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before arriving in Beijing with Ambassador Chongguang, Tanaka Toshiki, the former Ambassador to Russia, said to the reporters of the Electric News Agency after arriving at the consulate, regarding his travel impressions and the position of Ambassador to China, "I came to Nanjing 12 years ago. This time I came to China purely for inspection. Today, I plan to meet with Foreign Minister Wang and other important figures. I will stay here for a few days and then return to Shanghai, and then go to North China for inspection. I am scheduled to return to my country in the middle of next month. As for the rumors that I will be appointed as the Ambassador to China, I have no knowledge of them. The rumor that the Chinese side hopes that someone who has not served in China will be the ambassador may or may not be true. The negotiations between China and Japan on the road to revolution must foresee considerable difficulties in the future." (14th Electric News Agency Telegram)</p>

Gao Jiyi has not yet agreed. Gao has sent the deputy director to Tianjin to see Hu Ruoyu. Hu has not fully recovered from his illness. Once he arrived in Tianjin, he returned to Beiping. Gao has telegraphed the deputy director to go to Beiping for consultation. Because Shanghai lacks coal and the labor strike has not been resolved, it is hoped that Hu will resolve it as soon as possible. There will probably be a solution in a few days. The British also feel concerned about the mine strike and have agreed to mediate. (14th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>A Hero Doesn't Fear Humble Origins</p>
<p>Briand Withdraws from the Election</p>
<p>Will Still Serve as a Diplomatic Negotiator</p>
<p>Reuter's Versailles, 13th - Senate President Doumer has been elected as the French President. The initial vote count resulted in Doumer receiving 442 votes and Briand receiving 401 votes, a difference of only 41 votes. Doumer did not receive an absolute majority, so a second vote was necessary. Briand, unsure of his chances of winning, withdrew from the election and announced that he would go to Geneva tomorrow. Hannassy, who only received 10 votes, also withdrew his name before the second vote. Therefore, in the second vote, Doumer received 504 votes, and Senator Sarraut received 334 votes. The presidential seat was thus awarded to Doumer.</p>
<h3 id="e74">New French President Doumer <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Reuter's Paris, 14th - Briand stated that he did not want to resign from his position as Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Reuter's Paris, 14th - French Prime Minister Laval stated that the outcome of the parliamentary election of the President should not be seen as a sign of opposition to the government's recent foreign policy, as foreign policy is always approved by Parliament. The new President will take office on June 13th, at which time the current cabinet will naturally formally resign. Laval will ask Briand to remain in office until June 13th to participate in important negotiations in Geneva, such as the Austro-German customs union, as the French Foreign Minister is a long-standing representative of France at the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Reuter's Paris, 14th - The radical socialist Republican newspaper reported Briand's comments, which included the statement that if he continues to be able to obtain a majority in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, he will naturally continue to handle foreign affairs. It was also reported that Briand submitted his resignation this morning, but after being persuaded by his colleagues, he agreed to withdraw it.</p>
<p>Guomin She, Paris, 13th - It is widely believed that the reason for Briand's failure in this election is that leftists wanted to retain Briand's position as Foreign Minister and continue his consistent foreign policy, and therefore used the convenience of a secret ballot to make Briand fail.</p>
<p>Guomin She, Berlin, 13th - The German press was quite surprised by the failure of Briand to win the Presidential election. They could not help but regret it for Briand, saying that Briand was worthy of being a great statesman, so he was less skilled in the party competition and political maneuvering that politicians are good at, so there is even honor in this failure. Guomin She, Paris, 13th - After Doumer was elected French President, he was immediately escorted by the Republican Guard cavalry from the Palace of Versailles to the Presidential Palace in Paris, and the people along the way cheered and welcomed him.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Brief Biography of Mr. Doumer <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Doumer is 74 years old, with a robust spirit, not like a declining old man. He was born in Aurillac in the Cantal province, the son of a construction worker. At the age of just twelve, he was already making toys. He began his political career in 1888, affiliated with the Radical Party. He is a thoughtful, solemn, and quiet person. British Prime Minister George once said that he was like an immovable stone. He first entered the cabinet in 1895 as the Minister of Finance, proposing income tax, which is still known as a good tax. He served as Governor-General of Indochina the following year, serving for six years. After returning to the country, he re-entered parliament. In 1906, he ran for President as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, losing to Fallières. He was elected to the Senate in 1912 and subsequently held cabinet positions, most notably as Minister of Finance during the two Briand administrations from 1921 to 1922 and from 1925 to 1926. During the European War, all four of his sons sacrificed themselves for the country.</p>

<p>Archbishop Flees to France</p>
<p>Reuter's Madrid, 14th - The Spanish Archbishop escaped to France by car from here, and has now safely arrived in Irun, not far from the French border. The Spanish government has decided to confiscate all property of the deposed King Alfonso, because Alfonso used his throne to enrich himself.</p>
<p>Reuter's Madrid, 13th - Several churches in Valencia were attacked at night, so martial law has now been declared. The riots in Cordoba have resulted in five deaths. The royal summer palace in Santoña was reportedly broken into last night by unknown individuals, who stole a large number of valuables, including several gold and silver model yachts that belonged to the deposed King Alfonso. Communists in Guadalajara plan to attack the monastery there. After the authorities found out, they have made strict arrangements to protect it.</p>
<p>Reuter's Gibraltar, 13th - Outside the border, within Spanish territory, there is fierce unrest against the church. Communists from Malaga to Algeciras led rioters into the church, defiled the altar, and overturned the statues. They tied the statues with ropes and dragged them into the streets. All vehicles carrying refugees to Gibraltar were detained by the rioters, who destroyed the vehicles and insulted the people. The hotels here are full of refugees.</p>

<h3 id="e78">US Attitude Towards Silver Conference <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Deeply Afraid of Involving War Debt Issues</p>
<p>Expresses Unwillingness to Take Responsibility for Convening</p>
<p>Reuter's New York, 13th - Senate Finance Committee Chairman Smoot said in a speech in Salt Lake City today that the difficulties of war debts and other international events prevent the United States from convening an international conference to consider the stabilization of silver prices. Although the United States has an important relationship with the silver problem, all that the silver problem involves is India, China, and the British Empire, not the United States. He also said that countries owing debts to the United States will require an understanding that the issue of canceling debts must also be considered before accepting an invitation to attend a silver conference. He knows that the US government is currently trying to decide whether effective global action can be taken to consolidate silver prices. The person currently paying the most attention to this issue is none other than President Hoover. The current difficulty is that India was a major buyer of silver before the European War, but has recently been selling silver regardless of market prices, which is still the case. This is the key to the current situation, but the United States is not able to help. Senator King originally planned to meet with the Secretary of State today to discuss silver prices and gold parity, but has now changed the meeting to tomorrow. According to the outside world, this statement by Mr. Smith, one of the most powerful figures in the US Congress, is tantamount to expressing the attitude of the US government.</p>

Fortunately, the years of turmoil have come to an end, and the National Assembly has also opened, at a time to seek peaceful unification and constitutional construction. How can we allow the use of force again, resulting in division, creating opportunities for the Red bandits, and sacrificing the people? If Chen persists in his delusion and abandons the Party and the country, even if we love and protect him, we cannot. We can only request the Central Government to punish him according to law, as a warning to those who are used by others and who do not understand the overall situation. We, along with the people of Anhui, pledge to serve as your backing." We hope that you will uphold justice and curb evil schemes to protect peace and save the Party and the country.

<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Qufu Confucius Temple Restoration Preparatory Committee held its inaugural meeting at 10:00 AM today in the Pearl Spring Hall of the Provincial Government. Members present included: Li Shuchun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs; Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Department of Finance; Zhang Honglie, Director of the Department of Construction; Wang Fangting, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining; Wang Ye, Secretary representing He Siyuan, Director of the Department of Education; Wu Zhenzuan, President of the High Court; Zhang Shaotang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government; Ma Liang, Chairman of the Opium Suppression Committee; Zhao Lanyan, representing Li Jinglin, Director of the National Martial Arts Institute; and He Zonglian, a member of the Shandong Provincial Relief Committee.

Regarding the committee's budget, it was resolved that the Secretary-General should prepare it; 4. It was resolved that responsible personnel should be quickly designated to organize the office premises and purchase equipment to begin operations, to be handled by the Secretary-General; 5.

The donation appeal and circular have been drafted, and it was proposed to discuss whether they are usable. Zhang Shaotang reported that the donation appeal had already been telegraphed to President Dai (Jitao) for drafting, and a telegram had been sent to urge its speedy drafting. The reply stated that President Dai was extremely cautious about this donation appeal, and various parties were now sending telegrams to inquire. Considering the importance of the project, it was not appropriate to delay for too long, so the committee drafted another donation appeal. It was proposed to discuss whether to adopt it. It was resolved to telegraph Education Director He Siyuan to urge President Dai to quickly draft a donation appeal, or to have him revise the committee's draft appeal; the circular should be handled as planned; 7. Since donations from various places are designated to be collected by the Central Bank, it seems appropriate to notify the Central Bank to instruct its branches to comply. A draft telegram has been prepared. It was proposed to discuss whether it can be printed and distributed immediately. It was resolved to pass the motion; 8. A temporary proposal was made regarding what form the committee should use for official correspondence with the Provincial Government. It was resolved to use official letters. The meeting adjourned. The committee's proposed donation appeal, circular, and constitution are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e86">Solicitation for Repairing the Confucius Forest and Temple in Qufu (Whether to use this draft requires Dai Jitao's approval) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>I humbly believe that the governance of Great Harmony originates from the legacy of Confucius's writings. The flourishing of morality is recorded in the Three Principles of the People. Our late Premier, looking to the past and opening up the future, his respect for Confucius is self-evident. The Qufu Forest and Temple are the source of our country's moral culture. The documents of the Si River and the Zhu River serve as evidence and are tied to the observation of Chinese and foreign people. Therefore, since the late Zhou Dynasty, for more than two thousand years, although they have frequently been burned down, construction and restoration were carried out immediately, and further expansion was carried out. The temple looked solemn, and the scale was fully prepared. This is not only important for the inheritance of ancient sites, but also for the perception of people's hearts. During the Qufu battle in the 19th year of the Republic of China, the war and fire destroyed all the ancestral halls. The tombs were also bombed. It turned the scenic spots into a wasteland. All Chinese and foreigners who traveled to this place were filled with emotion when they visited the temple and felt sadness when they saw the ritual objects. If it is allowed to be abandoned, how can we glorify the prosperous era and create a grand transformation? However, the project is huge and requires the preparation of large funds in order to restore the original appearance. The accumulation of a mountain cannot be accomplished by a single basket of soil, and the setting of tripods is easy with the efforts of everyone. In addition to the initial donation and promotion, I hope that all comrades will do their best to donate and contribute to this grand event. All donations should be stored in the Central Bank nearby. Once a certain amount is collected, workers and materials will be hired immediately, and people will be sent to supervise the restoration, and expand civilization. By building new pavilions, the beauty of the palace walls will be fully restored, and it will be able to comfort the admiration of the high mountains. Furthermore, it is heard that there is the sound of string and bamboo music, which is in line with the purpose of preserving cultural relics. I respectfully write a brief solicitation, waiting for your good news.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Donation Circular (To all gentlemen in the field) <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully informing you that the Confucius Forest and Temple in Qufu are tied to the observation of Chinese and foreign people. They were unfortunately destroyed in last year's war. The forests and temples of Zhou, Yan, Si, and Meng are also incomplete and in need of repair. Telegrams have been sent to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang, who have approved assistance in their completion. However, the project is huge and difficult to support alone. A circular has been sent to all sectors to initiate fundraising. I have always admired your eminence and your emphasis on Confucianism. A single call from you will be echoed by all mountains.

<p>Repeated violations of contract provisions</p>
<p>Academic circles to file a protest</p>
<p>Beiping News: The crawling automobile of the Sino-French Academic Expedition Team has been staying in Zhangjiakou for a long time because it is waiting for our country's team members to set off. However, the team members have automatically filmed two reels of sound films in the temporary market in Qiaodong. Both are peddlers from the Tianyoucheng cloth stall calling out to sell goods. No Chinese team member was in Zhangjiakou. The French team members filmed the movie on their own without obtaining permission from the Chinese side, which violates the contract. The Beiping academic community had previously negotiated with the French side regarding the free movement of crawling automobiles. This time, the French also automatically filmed, which shows that the French have no sincerity. It is reported that the academic community will file a protest again. The crawling automobile left Zhangjiakou on the 10th and drove west to Bailing Temple to wait. Our country's team members will take the train to Baotou after Chu Minyi arrives in Peiping, and then change to a car to Bailing Temple to join them, and then depart west from there. (12th)</p>

<h3 id="e89">Kailuan Mines Declare a Go-Slow <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Management Refuses to Improve Workers' Treatment</p>
<p>And Resumes Two Days of Shutdown per Week</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Last month, the workers of Kailuan Mines requested the mining bureau to increase wages and improve treatment. The most important condition was a wage increase of two dimes per worker and improvements in treatment, such as preparing sufficient materials, increasing the number of white holes, and providing all types of workers with equal treatment and wage increases. Coal bars should be issued to workers in the winter, etc., with four attached conditions. They also requested a solution at the same time. The mining bureau did not respond to the workers' demands and posted a notice on the 4th of this month, stating that railway transportation was difficult and that there was too much coal stored in the mines, announcing a two-day shutdown per week. The workers were extremely indignant that the mining authorities had not come to their senses, and decided that the five mines would simultaneously start a go-slow on the 11th. From 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM that morning, workers did not work. More than 40,000 workers from Majiagou, Linxi, Kaiping, Guye, and Tangshan mines participated. In order to maintain order, the trade union organized maintenance teams in each mine to supervise the workers' actions. Executive committee members of the trade union traveled to various mines to direct everything to avoid accidents. Therefore, the go-slow was well-ordered and there were no riots. The Public Security Bureau did not interfere. The steps to be taken for the go-slow have not yet been fully determined. Special Commissioner Wang Chaowen from the Central Party Headquarters arrived in Tangshan and gave a speech to the trade union committee at the Kailuan Mining General Trade Union, advising them not to be extreme and to wait for a solution. At the same time, he telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters to report the situation of the go-slow. The Kailuan Mining General Trade Union's declaration of the go-slow is recorded below: "Our association accepts the resolutions of the general meetings of the miners of each mine, and is scheduled to implement the go-slow on May 11. We are afraid that all sectors will not understand the truth, so we will separately state the stubborn and unreasonable actions of the mining bureau and the steps taken during the go-slow as follows. The workers' request for a wage increase and improved treatment is not without reason, nor is it an excessive demand. The entire benefit of it has been assessed in advance, and the benefits that the workers should receive have been fully calculated. The amount issued to workers by the mining bureau is less than one percent. Before submitting the conditions, we told and encouraged each other with the true meaning of labor-management cooperation. For fear that it would not be enough to awaken them, we cited clear examples of labor-management cooperation abroad in detail. In today's society, labor-management cooperation means mutual benefit and coexistence, otherwise both sides will lose, or even perish together. Therefore, if the mining bureau slightly considers the lives of workers, it will definitely respond generously to these conditions. However, after the conditions were submitted, the bureau initially used translation delays to shirk responsibility, then suppressed representatives from speaking during negotiations, and finally refused to attend mediation. Their contempt for the Chinese party and government and their oppression of hard-working workers can only be understood but not spoken of. Based on the above facts, the Kailuan workers can no longer endure it. We originally planned to use the last resort to shock the top, but because the party and government organs are still actively mediating, it is inconvenient to take extreme measures and there is room for change. Unexpectedly, on May 4, the mining bureau posted a notice stating that railway transportation was difficult and that there was too much coal stored in the mines, announcing a two-day shutdown per week. It is stated that no other actions are allowed during the mediation period, and the government has issued three orders and five applications. The workers can still be imprisoned and dare not violate it. The mining bureau is inching forward and treating the law as a mere formality, and openly announced the shutdown, which is clearly a provocation to us. The difficulty of transportation was caused by the road-mining dispute. Frankly speaking, it is their own fault. Why take it out on the workers? As for the excessive coal storage, it is even more absurd. During the military operations in the 17th year of the Republic of China, traffic was cut off, even for several months, and the coal storage in each mine reached hundreds of thousands of tons, but it did not lead to a shutdown. Now the transportation is not completely cut off, and the coal storage in each mine is less than two-tenths of what it used to be, but they are openly shutting down. Their intention is nothing more than to use the shutdown to threaten everything because of the road-mining dispute and the workers' conditions. Workers are in the autumn of rice and pearls and cinnamon, and are seeking to improve their lives. The mining bureau does not think about this, but instead takes further countermeasures, placing workers in a dangerous situation, in a situation of increasing heat in fire and deeper water. What's more, the workers have long been dissatisfied with the road-mining problem. They have long had the idea of supporting the railway. Now that the mining bureau has forced the workers into a dead end, it is difficult to expect the mining bureau to come to its senses without using the last resort. Therefore, it is scheduled to implement a go-slow by the Kailuan miners on May 11. During the go-slow, we dare to say that there will be no accidents. Special personnel are assigned to protect important work. After the go-slow, regarding the workers' livelihood problems, mining experts have been hired to survey the land near each mine for abundant ore deposits, and they will be mined on their own. The Beining Railway will be asked to provide transportation assistance. The workers' livelihood subsidies have been settled, and the order of the go-slow can be solemn. No matter how stubborn they are, they will eventually be made aware of it. However, in the autumn of wind and rain, it is time for us to help each other in the same boat. Although it is nominally a labor-management dispute, it is actually the struggle of the Chinese nation. We hope that all our compatriots will support it, which is our sincere hope. In addition to submitting it to the competent authorities for the record, we hereby declare it. Kailuan Mining General Trade Union, Tangshan, Hebei Province." (12th)</p>

Those above 600 dan and below 800 dan will be charged 2 yuan for the license fee and 8 jiao for the license fee. Those above 800 dan and below 1,000 dan will be charged 2 yuan and 5 jiao for the license fee and 1 yuan for the license fee. Those above 1,000 dan and below 1,500 dan will be charged 3 yuan for the license fee and 1 yuan and 2 jiao for the license fee. Those above 1,500 dan and below 2,000 dan will be charged 3 yuan and 5 jiao for the license fee and 1 yuan and 4 jiao for the license fee. Those above 2,500 dan and below 3,000 dan will be charged 4 yuan for the license fee and 1 yuan and 6 jiao for the license fee. Those above 3,500 dan and below 4,000 dan will be charged 5 yuan for the license fee and 2 yuan for the license fee. The license fee is collected in four periods each year, and the registration fee is collected once a year. The license fee for small steamers is 12 yuan per month, and the license fee for tugboats is 4 yuan per month. Licenses are exchanged monthly. The registration fee for small steamers and tugboats is 2 yuan each per year. All foreign small steamers passing through the Yangtze River or inland rivers in Anhui Province should obtain a temporary transit permit from the office, and the fee is 2 yuan each time. The license fee for fishing boats is 1 yuan per quarter, and licenses are exchanged quarterly. The license fee is 1 yuan per year, and licenses are exchanged annually, and must not be resisted.

<h3 id="e91">Harbin Navigation Association Issue Under Mediation <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Navigation Association has agreed to concessions</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After the Songhua River Shipping Merchants' Grand Union, merchants along the Songhua, Heilongjiang, and Wusuli rivers pointed out that the bureau has a monopolistic nature. Brokers also opposed it because they could not get freight rebates. This matter has been going on for a month now, and has not been completely resolved. Merchants downstream have jointly telegraphed the Jilin Provincial Government and the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, requesting that the bureau be abolished to avoid hindering the development of commerce in various places, and telegraphed the Binjiang City Chamber of Commerce to transfer the request to the Special Region Commander's Office to fight for it nearby. At the same time, they boycotted by stopping the transportation of goods. However, the Navigation Association still followed the plan and sent ships to upstream and downstream areas every day. However, due to the merchants' boycott of transportation, the ships only transported a small number of passengers. Officials believed that this long-term stalemate was hindering Binjiang's livelihood and commerce, and Harbin merchants were also deeply affected because merchants from various places did not come to purchase goods, so they repeatedly appealed to the authorities. Therefore, the Political Affairs Committee specially summoned Wang Shuncun, director of the official-merchant Navigation Association, to Liaoning at the end of last month to inquire about the matter, and ordered Wang to return to Harbin to find a solution. On the one hand, he telegraphed the Dong Province Special Zone Administrative Commander's Office to thoroughly investigate the truth and submit it for verification. Wang Shuncun returned to Harbin on May 6, and convened an emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors of the bureau on the afternoon of the 7th. It was resolved on the spot that in addition to people coming forward to mediate, a freight committee would be formed to discuss reducing freight by 15% to ease the momentum of the merchants. Recently, Binjiang Public Security Bureau Chief Gao Qilian, Binjiang County Chief Li Keyuan, and Commander's Office Finance Department Chief Song Ruxian have contacted the merchants. If a compromise can be reached, the Navigation Association is willing to suffer losses and make concessions. Representatives from the Fuyuan Yilan chambers of commerce and farmers' associations downstream have only exchanged letters and telegrams to negotiate opinions, and have not discussed concrete solutions for compromise. Therefore, after the Binjiang Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the mediator's opinion, they immediately telegraphed a reply, saying that before the 10th of this month, they would send representatives to Harbin to hold a meeting to discuss and decide. Therefore, whether this issue will expand depends on the arrival of representatives from various chambers of commerce and the outcome of their consultation. As for the Harbin ships, they currently only go to Fuyuan, Hurao, Heihe, and other places. The roads along the river are not safe and the ice floes have not been cleared. They must wait until May 15 to be able to navigate. (9th)</p>

(Article 10) After the sand field is upgraded, the Department of Finance will issue printed documents as a certificate for practicing tax payment. The printed document fee is 2 jiao per mu. (Article 11) All sand fields of public nature shall be handled in accordance with private property.

<p>Case of Brother-in-Law Strangling Sister-in-Law: Disinterment and Examination of Bones: Xia Meizhu, a farmer from Xiajiaji in the tenth district of the county, and his father-in-law, Liu Hengyu, reported to the county government that Xia Meilian and others had strangled his wife, Xia Liu Shi. The examination began yesterday at the Qigong Temple. The coroner Guo took out the remains one by one and washed them clean. Due to the overcast sky, the examination could not be completed, so the remains were first placed in a small wooden box, sealed with a county government seal, and ordered the police to guard them together with the plaintiff and the defendant. This morning (the 12th) at 10:00 AM, County Magistrate Wang, Trial Officer Ji, and Coroner Guo arrived to examine the remains. First, the remains were steamed in a cage and then examined. The results showed that there were ten fewer upper teeth, and all the lower teeth were present, with five of them red. The cervical vertebrae were red. Both the upper and lower sections of the left arm bone were red. There was a bruise on the right radius, with a clear red blood mark. There was a scratch on the left radius, with a red blood mark. Five sections of the left fingers were red, and four sections of the right fingers were red. It was determined that the injuries were sustained before the death by hanging.</p>

<p>Restoration of Traffic on Shanping Bridge: Shanping Bridge, the border between this county and Jiashan County, was blocked with wooden stakes in the waterway by order of the military authorities at the Shuangxi Village Council due to rampant banditry. Although the area was temporarily at peace, transportation was greatly inconvenienced. Now that the bandits have been suppressed, the village council has received approval from higher authorities to restore water traffic in the area. The removal of the wooden stakes began on the 13th.</p>
<p>Silk Cocoon Tax Changed to Business Tax: The Pinghu County Business Tax Bureau received a telegram from the Department of Finance stating that the tax rate for the silk cocoon industry in the province's business tax rate table is set at two per thousand. The silk cocoons of this season are about to be on the market, and all county bureaus are ordered to verify and collect the tax according to the fixed rate. The silk cocoon tax of previous years has been completely abolished from this year onwards, in accordance with the national government's circular.</p>

<p>Yucheng Pawnshop in West Gate Burns Down: Yucheng Pawnshop in Gangqiao Lane, West Gate of Ningbo, has been in business for many years and has been quite prosperous. At 7:30 PM on the 12th, the storage building on the left side of the pawnshop, which stored wooden furniture and cotton quilts, suddenly caught fire for unknown reasons. The fire was very fierce, and firefighters from the city and suburbs rushed to the scene. Because the walls of the building were high, it was difficult to put out the fire. After more than an hour, the fire was extinguished. It is estimated that five buildings, more than a hundred cotton quilts, and wooden furniture were burned, totaling losses of over ten thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Bandits Rob Boats in Succession: Jingyou River in the southern countryside of Xiaoshan, is the main route from Linpu to Zhuji Paitou. Recently, bandits have been rampant in the area, and robberies of boats and goods have been frequently reported. On the night of the 9th of this month, two night boats and three cargo ships sailing from Zhuji to Linpu were forced to the shore by more than ten bandits and looted. The belongings of the nine passengers, including clothing and quilts, worth over a hundred yuan, were taken away. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 12th, a boat sailing from Paitou to Linpu was also robbed, with losses estimated at over two hundred yuan. The boat owners have reported to the water police and requested a search. In addition, night voyages have been suspended to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Passenger Ship Sinks Sailing Boat, Request for Negotiation: Xu Dayu, a boat owner from Wutu Village in Xiaoshan, owned a "Xu Huiyuan" sailboat loaded with passengers and goods to be sold in the Min and Yue areas after sailing from Nantong Port. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of last month, the ship was sunk by the Japanese ship "Yijin Maru," causing a loss of 20,000 yuan. The boat owner has submitted a petition to the county executive committee, requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Executive Committee, which should then forward it to the foreign affairs authorities for serious negotiation.</p>
<p>Tragic News Amidst Poor Silkworm Farming: Due to continuous rain and a sudden drop in temperature, the silkworm farming in the four townships has been severely affected. The poor silkworm farming in Shantou Peng, Xiaosipu, and other places is unprecedented in recent years. Eight or nine out of ten families have given up. On the 12th, two sisters-in-law named Xu, farmers in Shadi, jointly raised more than two liang of silkworm eggs and ordered mulberry leaves worth 48 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the third sleep, they completely vomited yellow water and died. The two women were devastated by this blow and had no source of income for silkworm farming, resulting in debts of dozens of yuan. Overcome with remorse, the two women suddenly had a suicidal thought. In the middle of the night, each of them took brine to end their lives. The next morning, they were discovered by their neighbors, who tried to save them in every way. One woman died due to the deep poisoning, while the other woman was fortunate to have taken less poison and is not in danger of death.</p>

<p>Capture of Red Bandit Zhang Pengchao and Others: Xuyi is located on the border of northern Anhui, surrounded by mountains and beaches. Bandits have been rampant. In recent years, troops have come and gone, and bandits have come and gone, causing disasters that have been reported in various newspapers. Recently, red bandits have infiltrated the territory again and colluded with local bandits. Fortunately, heavy troops were sent to suppress them, and peace has finally been restored. Zhang Pengchao (also known as Bo Fei or Bai Fei), Wu Jingxiu, Hua Kaihao, and other leaders of the red bandits who were active in Xuyi have been secretly ordered to be arrested by the Anhui Provincial Government, but they have not been captured. Now, the two key criminals, Wu Jingxiu and Hua Kaihao, were arrested last month. County Magistrate Jiang Shuxun welcomed them back to the county a few days ago. The provincial government has telegraphed to have them escorted to the province for legal action. Recently, the people of the county have organized a communist eradication group and issued a declaration, detailing the disasters caused by the red bandits Wu Jingxiu and others in Xuyi, hoping that all the people of the county will rise up together to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3 id="e107">Letter from the Secretariat of the Ministry of Railways <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>In the Capital News column of your newspaper on the 13th, there is a statement that "Vice Minister Huang Hanliang of the Ministry of Railways telegraphed to Beijing to move his family, and Vice Minister Lian Sheng Hai is currently on sick leave and replaced by Counselor Guan Genglin." After investigation, the statement is inconsistent with the facts. Vice Minister Huang of this ministry did not telegraph to Beijing to move his family. Vice Minister Lian did occasionally suffer from illness, but he still worked diligently and did not take leave. The statement "replaced by Counselor Guan Genglin" is even more fictitious. I am writing to request that your newspaper promptly correct the statement.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Secretariat of the Ministry of Railways</p>

<p>Fifth Jiangnan University Sports Meet Opens Today</p>
<p>——Seven Schools Participating, Including Female Athletes This Year——</p>
<p>——Venue at Guanghua, East China Athletes Compete——</p>
<p>The fifth track and field meet of the Jiangnan University Sports Association, as decided by the executive committee, is scheduled to be held today and tomorrow at Guanghua University on Daxi Road. Guanghua, as the host, is responsible for the preparations, and everything is generally ready. The opening ceremony will be held formally at 1:30 PM today. Seven schools are participating: Central University, Jinan University, Daxia University, Guanghua University, Fudan University, Jiaotong University, and China Public School. Chi Zhi University is also a member, but it is regrettable that they are not participating in the most important track and field events. This year's competition will have two championships, one for field events and one for track events. The 3,000-meter race has been canceled and replaced with a 10,000-meter race. The 200-meter low hurdles have been changed to 400-meter intermediate hurdles, and the 12-pound shot put has been changed to 16 pounds. In short, the competition will be conducted entirely according to Far Eastern rules. A women's division has also been added, which is unprecedented. In addition, anticipating that preparatory students will not be able to participate in the championship competition, an open division has been specially set up for preparatory students to compete. The intention is excellent. Generally speaking, most of the athletes from the seven schools are outstanding talents from East China, and the Jiangnan University Sports Association is also the largest sports organization in East China. It is expected that this competition will produce good results. However, due to the heavy rain last night, the track is soft, which may affect the track event results. If there is heavy rain today, the competition will be postponed. If there is light rain, the competition will proceed as scheduled. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e108">Venue Arrangement <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The sports field was recently built, and the track is slightly soft. The perimeter is 400 meters. The starting points for the 100-meter, 50-meter, and hurdles are in the southwest corner of the field. Next to it is the rostrum, with a press box on top. The finish line for middle and long-distance races is near the starting point for the 100-meter race. The starting point for the 200-meter race is in the northeast corner of the field. In front of the university classroom, an additional 60-foot grandstand from the China Baseball Field has been borrowed and installed next to the 100-meter starting point, which is also the finish line for middle and long-distance races, so that spectators can sit and watch. The long jump is in the west of the field, the high jump and javelin throw are in the south of the field, the pole vault pit is in the east of the field, the shot put is in the northeast corner, and the discus is in the northwest corner. The overall arrangement of the field is quite organized.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Directions to the Venue <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Guanghua University is located in western Shanghai, far from the bustling center. Those coming from outside the area can follow the directions below: (1) Take a trolley or bus to Jing'an Temple, get off at Jing'an Temple, and then take a rickshaw to the school. The rickshaw fare is about 30 to 35 cents. (2) Take a rickshaw directly from Zhaofeng Garden. The fare is about 20 cents. (3) Take the Xujiahui tram to Fucaixin Road, and then take a rickshaw for about 20 cents to reach the venue. In addition, there is a Guanghua University bus at the intersection of Sanma Road and Yunnan Road (in front of Moore Memorial Church), waiting at any time. The fare is also 20 cents.</p>

<p>Central University: Central University was the champion of the previous meet. This year, they have abundant talent, with the largest team of the seven schools, totaling 30 people. Among them, the previous winners, such as Chen Ling, Zhao Rugong, and Zhang Yuansheng, are still on the roster this year. Chen Ling's hurdles performance this year has improved to 16.9 seconds, which is the most stable. His high jump of 1.718 meters will compete with Fudan's Li Lin for the top spot. Zhao Rugong's highest long jump score is 6.71 meters, and he has the most hope. He can score in the triple jump. Zhang Yuansheng's 1500-meter race has improved to 4 minutes 42.9 seconds, and he will also compete with Ma Fengrui. He may also score in the 800-meter race.</p>
<p>China Public School: Ma Fengrui is highly anticipated. Everyone knows about his long-distance running. His 34 minutes 12.5 seconds in the 10,000-meter race, 4 minutes 38.2 seconds in the 1500-meter race, and 2 minutes 10 seconds in the 800-meter race are outstanding. The top spot almost certainly belongs to him. Everyone hopes to see a new record.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University: Dai Ming is the king of the triathlon, but he has recently injured his foot, and it is still unknown whether his performance will be affected. If he does not work hard, Jiaotong University may have little hope.</p>
<p>Guanghua University: Wang Jizhun is the king of the field events. He will definitely win first place in the javelin throw. He had a special score of 46.94 meters at this school. He will compete with Central University's Zhao Rugong in the long jump, competing against Bai Hong with a score of 6.28 meters. His triple jump of 12.78 meters is also outstanding. He has a lot of hope in the 31.93-meter discus throw. Shu Zhaoxian can also score in the meet.</p>
<p>Fudan University: Abundant talent. Gu Zaiping's 11.2 seconds in the 100-meter race and 24 seconds in the 200-meter race are rare. Li Lin's 1.69-meter high jump and 3-meter pole vault will compete with Cao Yu and Chen Ling. His 1.69-meter high jump can only be challenged by Chen Ling.</p>
<p>Jinan University: The team is no less than Central University's. Zhong Lianji has just recovered from an illness, and it is doubtful whether he can recover his pre-illness performance. Hao Chunde and Huang Feilong may take a place in the sprints. Wen Dingxin's 42.75-meter javelin throw, although not as good as Wang Jihai, is a sure score. Xie Quanhe may get a position in the triathlon.</p>
<p>Daxia University: Daxia has a lot of talent, but He Debao, Long Zexian, and Chen Baoqiu are limited by the rules due to their freshmen status. However, Wu Jinqi's 6.23-meter long jump is sure to score.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Other Matters <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Collect Number Cloths: Number cloths for male and female athletes will be issued this morning. It is hoped that each member will send someone to Guanghua to collect them.</p>
<p>Scoring Method: The top four finishers in each event will be awarded points, calculated as 5, 3, 2, 1. The women's relay race points are doubled, calculated as 16, 4, 2. The open division will not be scored and will not have a championship.</p>
<p>All-Around Competition: The men's five-event, ten-event, and relay races are collectively referred to as the all-around competition. It used to be mixed with the track and field meet, but it has been separated from this year onwards. It is heard that the all-around competition will be held around September or October.</p>
<p>Welcome to Central University: The Central University team arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is staying at the Guanghua Middle School. Last night at 7:00 PM, Guanghua held a special welcome reception to promote the friendship between the two schools.</p>

<p>A Chronicle of the Two Heroes' Battle for Supremacy</p>
<p>As the fifth bell rang and referee Chen Fuzhang's whistle sounded, the peaceful atmosphere was broken, and the athletes from both teams began their contest. Merchant Marine scored first, eliciting cheers from their supporters. White Emperor quickly caught up and regained the lead. From then on, the two teams were evenly matched, making it difficult to distinguish their strengths. Merchant Marine took the lead with a free throw, ending the first half with a score of eleven to ten. As the second half began, Merchant Marine launched a swift attack, scoring a long shot, greatly increasing their momentum. However, the White Emperor team remained calm and gradually recovered. Seizing an opportunity, they surged ahead, scoring ten consecutive points in five minutes, turning defeat into victory. Afterwards, Merchant Marine tried hard to catch up, but ultimately failed. As the game ended, White Emperor won with a score of thirty-seven to thirty.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Liaoning Track and Field Preliminary for the North China Games <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Dongda's Zhao Lingzhi Sets National Javelin Record</p>
<p>Ma Zijun Breaks National Women's Shot Put Record</p>
<p>(Shenyang Correspondent) The Liaoning Province preliminary track and field meet for the North China Games was held at the Xueliang Sports Field on the 9th and 10th. The first day was originally scheduled to begin at 9 AM, but the javelins for the field events did not arrive in time, delaying the start until after 10 AM. President Feng Yong personally flew his Bili aircraft over the sports field several times to celebrate before the opening ceremony. After the competition began, it suddenly rained before several events were completed. However, the officials and athletes continued as planned. The second day was clear and bright, and the enthusiasm of the spectators was several times greater than on the first day. In terms of the competition results, there were no significant advantages or disadvantages among the men's teams. However, Zhao Lingzhi of Northeastern University set a new national javelin record with a throw of 46 meters (previous record 45.90 meters). The athletes from Antung County Girls' Middle School performed best in the women's division, especially Ma Zijun, whose 8-pound shot put set a new national record with a distance of 9.46 meters. The school won championships in every event they participated in. Their performance was even better than at last year's Northeast Four Provinces Joint Games. The Provincial Women's Normal School also showed considerable improvement. The gradual development of women's sports in Liaoning Province is evident from this. Liu Changchun did not participate in the men's senior division 100-meter and 200-meter races due to a leg injury sustained several days ago and is currently recovering. Xiao Dinghua also did not compete in the high hurdles due to a leg injury. In the 10,000-meter long-distance race on the second day, Liu Guxue of Northeastern University was expected to win and achieve the best record. However, after completing the seventh lap, he tripped and fell. After getting up and running several more laps, he was unable to finish the race due to the setback. The detailed results for both days are listed below:</p>

<p>The Taxpayers' Association Cables the National Assembly Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association cabled the National Assembly in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed National Assembly in Nanjing, our country has long suffered from the constraints of unequal treaties, which have undermined our sovereignty, ravaged our territory, fragmented our laws, invaded our economy, incited internal strife, and depressed the spirit of our nation, people's rights, and livelihood. Since the founding of the Republic of China by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who called for the awakening of the people and led the National Revolution for forty years, the political situation in our country has undergone a transformation, and the world has taken on a new look. Dr. Sun's last will specifically called for the abolition of unequal treaties and the realization of this goal in the shortest possible time. Now that the country has been unified, the National Government, in accordance with Dr. Sun's will, is convening the National Assembly in the capital. All of you are representatives of the people of the whole country, upholding the legacy of the Premier, in addition to formulating the Provisional Constitution for the period of political tutelage, you should also realize the abolition of unequal treaties, issue a solemn declaration, and announce it to the world. Our association, as a group of Chinese people in the Shanghai International Settlement, has suffered the most severely from the pain of unequal treaties. We are willing to unanimously support the declaration to abolish the treaties, and we will not hesitate to overcome any difficulties and sacrifices in order to implement it. This telegram is respectfully submitted for your consideration. Respectfully, Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association."</p>

<p>Begins Today</p>
<p>The seventh Shanghai Hygiene Week campaign begins today. News about the posting of cholera prevention slogans and the implementation of work is detailed below:</p>
<p>Post Slogans The various slogans for this Hygiene Week were posted yesterday by the Municipal Health Bureau, which dispatched staff to major roads in the north and south of the city to post various slogans and charts, informing citizens about the dangers of cholera, methods of prevention, attention to hygiene, and vaccination. The bureau also sent staff to the cabins of buses, trams, and long-distance buses to post the slogans. Due to the vast territory of the city, it is planned to complete the posting of over 40,000 large and small slogans within the three days of the 14th, 15th, and 16th. The bureau instructed the Shanghai Rickshaw Association to supervise each rickshaw company to complete the posting of 40,000 small hygiene campaign slogans on rickshaws within the three days of yesterday (14th), today (15th), and tomorrow (16th). As for the publicity work in various rural areas of Shanghai, the bureau has informed the municipal commissioners of each rural area to post slogans and charts on behalf of the bureau and send staff to administer vaccinations.</p>
<p>Send Doctors for Vaccinations From today until the 21st,</p>
<p>the Municipal Health Bureau will send many doctors to various factories in the city to persuade factory workers to get vaccinated, with particular emphasis on encouraging the poor people in the city to get cholera vaccinations in order to prevent the spread of cholera. Organizations, institutions, and individuals with more than 30 people can directly notify the bureau, which will arrange for doctors to visit and administer vaccinations on a specific date.

<p>Letter to Citizens Hu Hongji's Seventh Hygiene Campaign Letter to Citizens says,</p>
<p>Citizens, this is the seventh time that the city has held a hygiene campaign. In each campaign, the Health Bureau has distributed many important points of hygiene knowledge to citizens in the form of leaflets and slogans, or through announcements and advertisements, all in order to make everyone understand the true meaning of hygiene, gain more knowledge to protect their health, and become a citizen who knows how to pay attention to hygiene, and a healthy and promising national. Then, with the cooperative efforts of everyone, we can promote the overall public health cause, create a healthy nation, and wash away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia." This is the purpose of our repeated appeals to citizens in each campaign. From various perspectives, we have observed that citizens of this city are now more aware of hygiene and have gradually paid attention to the importance of the relationship between hygiene and life. In the past two years, we have received more documents from citizens requesting the elimination of matters that harm hygiene, which shows the progress of citizens' public health knowledge. This is also something that the administrative organs in charge of hygiene are very pleased about, and it also makes us feel that our responsibility is great, and we must work hard to promote it. Because there are still many facts that tell us that a small number of citizens still have a weak understanding of public health knowledge and do not pay attention to the importance of public health. Let us take the prevention of cholera as an example. Everyone knows that cholera is a serious infectious disease that is most likely to occur every summer. The first method of prevention is to get vaccinated, and the second is to pay attention to diet. The more people who get vaccinated, the better, because a small number of people who do not get vaccinated still have a greater chance of being infected with cholera. Therefore, since its establishment, this bureau has paid special attention to prevention work, striving to make it universal. Every summer, we send many doctors to various places to give citizens free vaccinations. We send doctors to all public groups, schools, institutions, and factories with a large number of workers to give vaccinations. According to our experience over the years, there are indeed many citizens who actively accept vaccinations, but there are still some leaders or partners of organizations, factories, and shops who do not understand the benefits of cholera vaccination and refuse to get vaccinated. Sometimes, they even openly refuse. We speculate that their reasons for refusing to get vaccinated are nothing more than the following: (1) They think that going to get vaccinated while working will take up some working time; (2) They fundamentally lack public health knowledge and think that there is no need to get vaccinated if they are not sick. Aside from these two reasons, we cannot think of any other reasons for their refusal to get vaccinated. Because we send doctors out to give vaccinations completely free of charge, no matter where we go. The people who get vaccinated not only do not suffer any loss, but can also add to their body's ability to resist cholera. Why would they refuse to get vaccinated? Speaking of the first reason for refusing to get vaccinated, we dare to assert that it is entirely the private opinion of a few ignorant factory owners or employees, because their purpose is only to make a profit, and they think that if workers stop working for a while, the factory will suffer losses. This kind of mentality can be said to be very wrong. It not only shows that their selfishness is too heavy and their moral heart is too thin, but it can simply be said that they do not understand the principles of operating industrial and commercial enterprises in the current era. Because cholera is a highly infectious disease that is most likely to spread, and factories and shops are places with many people and complicated affairs, and there are many interactions between them, there is a greater chance of epidemic diseases spreading. Once cholera and other infectious diseases occur, there is a great danger of affecting the entire population. Therefore, preventing the occurrence of serious infectious diseases is to maintain the working ability of the partners. Hongji takes this opportunity to explain this principle, hoping that all the leaders and managers of factories and shops in the city will think about it more, and clearly and thoroughly recognize the direction they should take. Speaking of the second reason for refusing to get vaccinated, which we speculated earlier, it is entirely due to stubborn thinking and a lack of modern hygiene knowledge. They still regard infectious diseases as natural disasters and divine misfortunes, and do not know that cholera is entirely due to infection. Because it is extremely easy to transmit, it often kills many people in summer and autumn. Shanghai used to not pay attention to prevention, which led to cholera becoming a great scourge. There was a shocking fact that coffins were sold out. Citizens who have lived in Shanghai for many years must still remember it. Since this disease is so easy to transmit, even if people are currently healthy, they may immediately be infected through food, drink, or contact. Getting sick and suffering is a small matter, but their lives are in danger in an instant, and it may be too late to save them by seeing a doctor. Therefore, only by getting vaccinated can they add some resistance to their body, even if they are invaded and develop cholera, they can also reduce the severity of the disease and make it easier to cure. Therefore, getting vaccinated is an important method for everyone to prevent the harm of cholera and to protect their lives in summer and autumn. It is really wrong to say that there is no need to get vaccinated if they do not have cholera. As for paying attention to diet, it is also very important. Because cholera is entirely due to cholera bacteria causing problems in the intestines and stomach, people who get the disease vomit and have diarrhea. Therefore, we must be especially careful about what we eat and drink, especially not to eat raw water and things made with raw water, sprinkled with raw water, or things that flies have touched, because raw water and things that flies have touched often have cholera bacteria attached to them that cannot be seen by the naked eye. If they are mistakenly eaten and transmitted to the intestines and stomach, the bacteria will multiply and take people's lives. The Health Bureau has repeatedly announced this matter in the summer of the year, urging citizens to pay attention to it. However, according to our observations, citizens still lack special attention. This is something that we hope citizens in this city will improve starting this year. At the time when this Hygiene Campaign is being held, the Health Bureau is already carrying out the prevention of cholera this year. I hope that this year, all citizens will pay attention to prevention, get vaccinated, get rid of all unreasonable prejudices, encourage each other, and work hard together to reduce the harm of all epidemic diseases year by year, and to increase the level of citizens' hygiene knowledge year by year, so that future Hygiene Campaigns may not have to be held, and future hygiene agencies will only have to perform executive tasks for citizens, without having to do any more publicity and advocacy work. To realize the high level of Shanghai citizens in the new China, this is also something that Hongji sincerely hopes for on this occasion. Let us encourage each other and look forward to success together.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sponsors Vocational Education <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Advising All Industries to Establish Vocational Schools</p>
<p>To Cultivate Talents Suitable for Business Needs</p>
<p>To Resolve the Current Social Panic Regarding Employment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various industry associations and guilds yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a letter received from the China Vocational Education Society on the 11th of this month. The letter states that the backwardness of social production and the increasing impoverishment of the national livelihood are the greatest dangers facing China today. The Ministry of Education, recognizing this, issued a clear order in March of this year to promote vocational education. For more than a decade, our society has been working hard to research this matter, and only now has it gained the sympathy of society and the promotion of the government, which fulfills our private wishes. However, running vocational education is extremely difficult, with a myriad of details. In short, if we try to make education vocationalized, the results will be less effective. This is why vocational schools in various places, after being established for more than a decade, have not shown significant results. If we can make vocational education educationalized, the results will be more effective. This is why vocational education in various countries has been effective. Making education vocationalized inevitably creates some separation, while making vocational education educationalized allows for the benefit of matching supply and demand. Today, we hear of the suffering of unemployment while lamenting the lack of talent. This contradiction is clear evidence of the lack of communication between education and occupation. Although some vocational school graduates may not fully meet the needs, we believe that the best method is for each industry to establish its own specialized vocational school according to its needs. For example, major factories and shops in Europe, America, and Japan either run their own training centers or entrust educational institutions to handle appropriate materials. This is the intention behind this. Recently, various industries in Liaoning and Shenyang have also established vocational courses. Their meticulous planning and long-term vision are truly admirable. Shanghai is China's only major trading port, and each industry has a considerable organization. The leaders are all outstanding talents, admired by the national business community. If you can take the lead in advocating, it will surely move the attention of the world. Your dedication to public welfare and promotion of education has always been admired. If you can establish a vocational school based on your own industry or make an existing school vocationalized, it will directly benefit the supply of talent and the development of your industry. At the same time, it will have a very good impact on society. For the sake of the development of your industry, for the sake of alleviating unemployment, and for the sake of the national economy, it seems that such an organization is necessary. We believe that you gentlemen, with your foresight and leadership, will agree with this proposal. If you promote it, we will see a great response. If you consult us on this issue, our society will do our best to contribute what we know." Upon receiving this letter, we find that the common problem of our country's industries is that when undertaking a business, there are no employees who have received sufficient training and knowledge to apply it, while the common problem of the education sector is that the talents cultivated are unable to meet the current needs. Therefore, students often feel difficulties in finding employment after graduation or even go astray. Although the China Vocational Education Society was established to reverse this decline, the people in charge of the society are mostly from the education sector, so they are inevitably separated from the industry, failing to fully exert their effectiveness. The society's proposal to establish specialized vocational schools according to their needs is to make up for this shortcoming. Therefore, we have sent a special letter to inform you, hoping that your association will convene the industry to discuss this matter at length and make appropriate arrangements. If you sincerely promote it and achieve success, the livelihood problem that causes social panic can at least be partially solved. Please do not regard it as ordinary."</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Question of Year-End Accounting on the Gregorian Calendar's Fifth Month <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables for Instructions</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the three accounting periods for businesses, chambers of commerce in various places have requested a change to the year-end accounting period. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau submitted a proposal to postpone the Gregorian calendar accounting period. Recently, it was heard that the Executive Yuan has approved that accounting should continue at the end of the fifth and ninth months. The Gregorian calendar year-end accounting period will be extended to January 31st of the third year. According to personnel from the Social Affairs Bureau, the bureau has not yet received a clear order. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that there are not many days left until the end of the fifth month, and this matter urgently needs to be resolved. It is said that they telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday to expedite approval, so as to avoid confusion during the accounting period for businesses.</p>

<h3 id="e127">The Official and Business Sectors on the Slaughter Tax Issue <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Differing Opinions</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau's Advice: Reports indicate that the fresh meat industry at the</p>
<p>meeting of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, opposed the levy of slaughter tax, and resolved five items, which are inconsistent with the principles of law and facts. Therefore, we specifically advise adding the following: The slaughter tax is a local tax that is common throughout the country, and has been levied for a long time. When the Jiangsu Provincial Government collected the slaughter tax payable by meat merchants in this city, the meat shops complied and paid it without any objection. Why is it that the municipal government is now collecting it at the original tax rate, but the meat industry is demanding its abolition? The biggest hidden motive in this is that the municipal government has broken the bad system of contractors, and the few meat merchants who jointly contract cannot enjoy the benefits of monopolizing as before. Therefore, they incite colleagues who are unaware of the inside story to rise up in opposition. The Bureau has a few words of advice for the fresh meat shops in the city who do not know the inside story of the contract: (1) The slaughter tax is a local tax that is common throughout the country. By what special status should meat merchants in this city not recognize and pay the legally levied slaughter tax, and they have been paying it for more than ten years? Why have they never raised any objections before? Do they mean that the previous payments were legal, and the current levies are illegal? From the perspective of legal principles and facts, there is no reason for this. (2) Since the slaughter tax is a common local tax, now the Jiangsu Provincial Government has transferred the power to collect this local tax</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>to the local government within its jurisdiction, which is precisely to comply with the central government's resolution to exercise the rules of governance and to prevent the bad habits of division and fragmentation among various agencies. However, the meat merchants took the opportunity of the transfer of collection power by the provincial government to obstruct it. Does this mean that the governance power of the municipal government of this city should always be divided and fragmented, and should always be confused? Moreover, the amount of tax collected is still the same as before, and has not increased by a penny. The meat merchants only need to change from paying the Jiangsu Provincial Government to paying the municipal government according to law. What reason is there to oppose this legitimate measure? From the perspective of legal principles and facts, there is no reason for this. (3) Recruiting merchants to contract tax revenue is one of the evils of the old system. When there is an opportunity to reform it, it should be abolished immediately to prevent the evils of corruption. The city seeks the truth and abolished the slaughter tax contractor system, which is a very legitimate measure. Those with ulterior motives who intend to obstruct this have their own unspeakable secrets. However, they do not distinguish the truth and blindly follow suit, and are used by those with private agendas. This is inevitably foolish and self-indulgent. From the perspective of legal principles and facts, there is no reason for this. As for the five items discussed, their illegality to law and the truth of the facts are as follows: (1) The proposed requirement to abolish the slaughter tax and change it to a business tax, and to pay the original amount before the change, is not feasible. The current slaughter tax levied in this city is still collected at the original tax rate, without any increase. Collecting it by the head is a fair and practical measure. The meat merchants have not increased their burden, so why should they use the contractor's amount as an excuse? The contractor's amount was a contract behavior that the contractor individually signed with the competent authority. The meat merchants have never had a precedent for paying the amount to the competent authority. The so-called original recognized amount is actually unfounded. This is something that all meat merchants should reflect on. (2) The proposed requirement to abolish the technician inspection fee. The meat merchants in each district, in order to set up livestock inspection and slaughtering and sales near their location, voluntarily paid for office expenses. The documents for the voluntary request are all there, and it has been approved by the municipal government. It is not allowed to reverse right and wrong. If the meat merchants in each district can send livestock to the designated places for inspection, this fee can be abolished, which is very much in line with the original intention of the Bureau's regulations. This is something that all meat merchants should reflect on. (3) The request to abolish the pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspection fees. This inspection fee is not a tax. It is one kind of handling fee. In order to maintain the progress of inspection affairs, and to slightly compensate the needs of municipal public use, it is impossible not to charge this handling fee under the current financial situation of this city. Moreover, this kind of inspection handling fee is stipulated in the municipal regulations of this city, and handling fees are common in all cities. This city still does not have the ability to waive it. This is something that all meat merchants should reflect on. (4) The request to no longer force the purchase of tickets to pay taxes. As mentioned earlier, the slaughter tax should not be avoided, then purchasing tickets to offset the tax payment is a measure that is convenient for investigation and should naturally be in place. Its effect is the same as cash. It is only used to confuse colleagues because of procedural issues, and to make sacrifices for the boycotts of those with ulterior motives. This is too cruel. All meat merchants should quickly reflect on and realize this. (5) The proposed opposition to the municipal government's construction of slaughterhouses. May I ask, what is the direct relationship between the municipal government taking over the slaughter tax and planning to build new slaughterhouses? It is far-fetched and discussed together, which shows that those who instigate trouble are doing everything possible. The reasons why the city should build a municipal slaughterhouse have been detailed in the plan. Due to space limitations, and recognizing that this kind of talk is getting farther and farther away, it is temporarily unnecessary to correct it. Let me give a few examples to ask questions: Should the sheds in Zhabei be allowed to exist forever? Or should they be gradually rebuilt into public housing as the current municipal government is doing? Should the narrow alleys be narrow forever? Or should they be gradually rebuilt as they are now? If it is said that these sheds and narrow places should be rebuilt, then the dark, narrow, and foul-smelling slaughtering should be eliminated, and a clean and well-proportioned slaughterhouse should be built. There is no reason to object to this. Advocating opposition only reveals the weakness of one's understanding. This is something that all meat merchants should reflect on. This is a special advice. I hope you will know this and not be deceived again.</p>
<p>The Claims of the Various Industries Tax Rules Association: The various industries of this city</p>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of the Industry Guilds yesterday presented a document to the Municipal Government regarding the collection of slaughter tax by the Municipal Government, requesting that it be changed to a business tax. The document states, "Submitting a request to change the slaughter tax to a business tax, hoping that you will examine and order compliance. According to the letter from the Fresh Meat Industry Guild, it is reported by a majority of colleagues that since the fourth year of the Republic, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance collected slaughter tax in various districts, each fresh pig had to pay a tax of four jiao, plus an educational surtax of four fen. After the collection was managed by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education in the 17th year of the Republic, a health inspection fee of one jiao was added. However, this tax was only collected in the urban areas of the north and south of the city, and not in the concessions. Therefore, the colleagues in the inland areas feel very painful compared to the colleagues in the concessions. Now that the central government has issued an order for the provinces to abolish transit duties, and all local miscellaneous taxes must be exempted, this slaughter tax is one of the miscellaneous taxes, and according to central regulations, it should naturally be abolished. We originally hoped that the central government would issue an order to exempt it to reduce the burden. Unexpectedly, we saw in the newspapers yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Government still wants to collect it. If it is implemented, it will be difficult to maintain our business and livelihood. Therefore, we request you to forward the matter to the higher authorities to withdraw the order and maintain our livelihood, and we will be extremely grateful." Based on this, in order to protect the interests of our colleagues, we should forward the situation to the central government and show concern for the difficulties of businesses, and issue an order to abolish the slaughter tax in Shanghai, so as to show compassion. Reading the reports in the newspaper in recent days, the slaughter tax of the industry is voluntarily paid by colleagues, but recently the government has ordered it to be collected according to the head, which has caused panic and endless appeals. Reading Article 6 of the General Outline of Business Tax Collection in Various Provinces issued by the Ministry, it stipulates that after the implementation of the business tax, the original slaughter tax in various provinces should be abolished. Now that the implementation of the business tax in this city is imminent, it seems unnecessary to change it again at this extremely urgent time, so as to avoid panic and appeals from businessmen in the industry. The tax rate of the slaughter tax cannot be evenly distributed in the Chinese concession area, and it is especially necessary to change it to a business tax. With the letter in front of us, we should prepare a document and forward it to you, hoping that you will examine it and order the Finance Bureau to change the slaughter tax to a business tax. Before the business tax is implemented, it should be paid according to the original amount, so as to avoid changes and be in accordance with the law, which is fair and convenient."</p>

<p>The Yarn Mill Federation Sent a Letter to the Consolidated Tax Office Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn Mill Federation sent a letter to the Consolidated Tax Office yesterday regarding the issue of re-levying business tax on cotton yarn, stating: "According to a letter from our member Yongyu Yarn Mill, it is reported by the Xia Shi branch of our company that the local business tax bureau will implement the collection of 0.2% business tax on cotton yarn on the 10th of this month, which is an additional tax in addition to the consolidated tax. How can manufacturers bear this burden? We request that your federation send a letter to the Consolidated Tax Office to negotiate with the business tax bureau to comply with laws and regulations and maintain the industry. Cotton yarn has already been taxed, and business tax should be collected according to regulations. Recently, we have received reports from various factories that local business tax bureaus have repeatedly taken such actions to re-levy business tax. We urge you to transfer this matter to the higher authorities and order all provinces and cities not to re-levy business tax on the sales of cotton yarn and its byproducts that have already been subject to the consolidated tax, so as to comply with laws and regulations and reduce the burden."</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Coal Industry Cables Requesting Allocation of Cars to Transport Coal <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Guild telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, stating: "Minister of the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, Shanghai has numerous factories and busy vehicles, and the demand for coal is very large. Recently, due to the lack of domestic coal sources, foreign coal has taken the opportunity to monopolize the market, and its prices are rising day by day. Not only factories and vehicles are suffering from the coal shortage, but also the country's economic leakage has reached millions of dollars in just two or three months. If we do not provide relief quickly, the harm will be unimaginable. For the sake of the industry and the national environment, our association has resolved through a meeting to telegraph the Ministry of Railways, ordering various railway bureaus to allocate more vehicles and transport as much coal as possible from various mines along the route to the south to meet the demand, so as to stabilize coal prices and relieve the coal shortage. This matter is urgent, and we hope that you will implement it as requested."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Various Industries Tax Rules Association Cables Requesting the Abolition of Sand and Gravel Management Fees <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Various Industries Tax Rules Committee of this city specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to abolish the sand and gravel management fee, stating: "Ministry of Finance of the National Government of Nanjing, according to the letter from the Sand and Gravel Industry Guild, the sand and mud operated by the members of the association are taken from the sea sand of the deserted islands of Ningbo and the silt sand of Huzhou in the mainland, and transported to Shanghai for building purposes, which is actually using waste to help people's livelihood and can also dredge rivers and clear waterways. As for the boatmen who take sand and mud from the place of origin, they pay land price to the local government office according to regulations, two fen per ton, and pay education donations and police fees, etc. After hiring small workers to dig, transport, and load the boats to Shanghai, they hire barges to transship, rely on the shore to hire small workers to unload, load trucks and transport to the destination. Statistics show that the selling price is only two yuan per ton, which is not to take value from the substance, but to seek compensation for the wages of laborers and the boatmen's water feet, the barge's barge fees, and the numbers are run by merchants, pay for the accounts of upper and lower merchants, and the commission for each ton is only one jiao, which is a transfer agent for customers. Over time, for decades, the government has given care to workers and does not levy taxes. Unexpectedly, just now we are in the time of abolishing transit duties and eliminating excessive taxes, there is the establishment of a sand and mud production and sales tax authority by the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The amount of tax is as high as more than fifty percent, and the name is cleverly established as management fee and production tax. Two companies, Dachang and Yitai, contract to set up collection offices in Shanghai, which are commissioned by the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and issue sand transportation permits at the office. It is found that branch posts have been set up in Wusong and other places to secretly release patrol boats, which patrol day and night. The penalties are extremely harsh. I have checked the transit duties system, which has hurt merchants and harmed the country for a long time. The National Government is determined to abolish it in order to show compassion for the difficulties of businesses, and the Ministry of Finance telegraphed on March 22 to announce to the whole country to clear away the accumulated malpractices in order to completely eradicate the accumulated ills and benefit the people. All industries congratulated each other. Only our sand and gravel industry suffered heavy taxes during this transit duty abolition period, which runs counter to the National Government's intention to show compassion for the difficulties of businesses. Complying with the clear order, the compensation after the abolition of transit duties is to change to business tax. According to the regulations of Article 4 of the General Outline of Business Tax, the business tax rate should be calculated by the thousandth method according to the taxable standard, and should not exceed two per thousand at most, which can already prove that the tax levied after the abolition of transit duties is the business tax that should not exceed two per thousand, and all other similar transit taxes in disguise cannot continue to exist. To prove it again, according to the old tariff outline, sand and gravel are one of the four essential needs for building houses, roads, and embankments for the people's livelihood, and their tax is specially allowed to be exempted. Now, for the sand and mud that we sell for two yuan per ton, which is the cost of labor, we suddenly add a tax of one yuan per ton, which is as high as fifty percent. Even if transit duties are abolished and taxes are added, it cannot be so much. This is obviously a case of cunning merchants deceiving higher authorities in order to seek profit. Managing sand and mud by setting up a bureau will lead to others following suit and affecting other industries. After celebrating the abolition of transit duties, we suffer heavy taxes. If the members of the industry suffer this heavy burden, the livelihood of 40,000 to 50,000 people in the city who rely on this life will be plunged into despair. Therefore, we urgently present this matter, hoping that you will forward it to the Jiang Zhe Provincial Government according to reason, and request that it be clearly ordered to abolish the excessive tax in order to relieve the people's difficulties and show compassion for businesses. It is said that the abolition of excessive taxes is one of the Party's internal affairs policies, and the Central Government has a great determination to abolish transit duties. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has a sand and gravel management fee production tax in disguise in the form of transit duties when the Central Government abolished transit duties. The tax rate reaches more than fifty percent, which not only violates the political program, but also goes against the intention of abolishing transit duties. Moreover, the contractor system has long been abolished, and the tax is still contracted by Dachang and Yitai companies, which is even more disrespectful to government orders. It is even more shocking to establish a tax collection agency of the Zhejiang Provincial Government within the Shanghai area. Moreover, according to item 2 of the draft business tax rate in Shanghai, the sand and gravel industry is taxed at two per thousand, and it seems that there cannot be an illegal overcharge in addition to the burden of business tax. What reasons does the Zhejiang Provincial Government use to set up the sand and gravel management fee production tax? It is difficult to understand. I read in the newspaper that the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance collected a five percent stone donation in Yinxian, authorized to the contractor. Zhang Caizheng, the Deputy Minister of Finance, immediately sent a letter requesting the abolition and punished the Yinxian County Governor. Reading today's newspaper, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance has replied by telegram ordering the abolition by the Department. Then the nature of the sand and gravel management fee production tax of the bureau is the same, and the heavy tax is even more serious. According to reason, we should send a telegram to request and order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to abolish it immediately, so as to relieve the difficulties of businesses and maintain government orders. In fact, it is public convenience. The Tax Rules Research Committee of the Shanghai Industry Guilds, Han, (Note: Some of the oil prints are unclear and cannot be corrected)</p>

<h3 id="e132">Woman Brutally Murdered in Eastern Hotel in the City <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The man she arrived with left in the middle of the night</p>
<p>The horrifying scene was discovered at noon</p>
<p>A bloody channel with a hatchet on the bed</p>
<p>The fatal wounds were on the jaw and neck</p>
<p>On the 13th, at 4 PM, a man and a woman arrived at the Eastern Hotel on Minguo Road, Xiaodongmen, in the Nanshi district. They booked room number 38 on the third floor. The porter asked them to write their names, ages, and hometowns in the registration book. The man wrote his name as Wei Jinhuo, age 30, local. The woman was referred to as his family member. The man appeared to be older than 30, wearing a blue-lined cotton padded jacket and pants, and a duckbill cap. He was thin and tall, with a physique resembling that of a smoker. The woman was nearly 30, with a long face and a slender figure. Her hair was cut short, not reaching her shoulders. She wore a black coat, black stockings, and black satin round-mouth shoes. After the room was booked, they paid the room fee of one dollar and twenty cents as usual. Half an hour later, the man and woman went out together and did not return until 12 midnight. The woman was no longer wearing her coat. They went to bed soon after. At that time, Zhang Gensheng, the night shift porter of the hotel, was on duty and had not slept. The porter's desk was located in front of room number 38. At 3:30 AM (yesterday morning), the man opened the door and went out. The porter did not suspect anything because people from the fish market in Xiaodongmen often booked rooms and had to get up in the middle of the night. Furthermore, the outside of the room was a brick wall, and no sound was heard from inside. Until noon yesterday, at 12 PM, the porter knocked on the door, thinking that if it was past noon, the room fee would be calculated for two days. He shouted for the people inside to get up, but there was no response. He knocked on the door for a long time, but there was no sound. He became suspicious and opened the door with a key. He couldn't help but cry out because the woman had been hacked to death on the bed. He immediately reported to the manager, Chu Lianke, who went to investigate. The woman's body was lying face down on the bed, facing outward. There was a channel of blood on the bed, and a hatchet (the kind used in red wood workshops) was next to her head. There were also bloody handprints on the account. The body was still covered with a quilt, and the curtains were drawn. Chu Lianke immediately reported to the 2nd Precinct of the 1st District, which sent patrol officers to investigate. The Public Security Bureau sent an inspector to the scene to inquire. Chu Lianke then submitted a report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Wu Shixin, along with recorder Qian Yinpei, coroner Xuan Zhiming, and bailiff Xu Guoguang, arrived at the scene. The autopsy revealed that the woman's corpse was about twenty years old. She was wearing a white cloth undershirt and pants. Her shoes and socks were on the floor. Her wool shirt and pants had been taken away by the murderer. Her right front tooth was a gold tooth. Her eyes were sunken, her tongue was extended, her hands were bent, and her feet were straight. There were two fatal wounds, one on her jaw and one on her neck, slightly to the right. There were also two non-fatal wounds, one on the back of her right hand and one on her left shoulder. It was suspected that the deceased was sleeping at the time and was killed by someone straddling her. They immediately filled out the autopsy report, took photographs, and ordered the Sixteen Shops Landlord to collect the body. Chu Lianke was instructed to take the porter Zhang Gensen to the court this afternoon for questioning to assist in the arrest of the murderer. The murder weapon, shoes, and socks were taken as evidence and stored in the warehouse. According to this case, the murderer was definitely the man. It is speculated that the cause must be impulse.</p>

<p>Selling to Russians who resold to Chinese</p>
<p>The investigation was discovered through donation and inspection licenses</p>
<p>A number of soldiers from the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai are billeted at the barracks at 116 Xinzha Road. One of the soldiers, named Eiworthsen, took advantage of the company commander's absence from the camp on the 25th of last month. He secretly entered his room, opened the drawer with a key, and stole a handgun from the iron box. Two days later, he took advantage of another opportunity to steal another gun. The performance of these handguns is far beyond what ordinary firearms can compare with, so the value of the two guns is worth 300 taels of gold. However, the marine regarded it as a piece of junk. Later, through the introduction of Simmermand of the same company, he sold it to Leibkovich, a Russian at 26 Carter Road, for 195 yuan. Later, the company commander discovered that guns were missing, but he didn't know who stole them. So he reported it to the police station, asking for an investigation. A few days ago, a person surnamed Li asked a friend surnamed Wu to bring a gun to the police station to donate and get a self-defense gun license. The Western officer inspected the Western text and serial number engraved on the handle of the gun, all of which had been destroyed, leaving only traces. After investigating the origin of the gun, it was learned that it was purchased from Leibkovich, who obtained it from the two American soldiers. So the competent company commander was notified, and the two soldiers were arrested. After questioning, they confessed. The police station immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest the Russian and found the remaining gun. Wu was dismissed. Yesterday morning, the Russian was escorted to the Special District Local Court and charged with violating Article 2 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms and Receiving Stolen Goods. The U.S. military camp also escorted the two soldiers to the court as evidence. They confessed that when they sold the guns, they had told the Russian that they were firearms used by the U.S. Navy. Judge Wu Tingqi questioned the defendant, who insisted that the two soldiers were not wearing uniforms when they were peddling the guns and did not say that they were military firearms, so he bought them. The judge ordered the defendant to be detained pending further investigation. The two American soldiers were escorted back to the military camp by the company commander to await trial.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Songhu Branch Line to Reduce Ticket Prices <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Between Tiantong'an and Jiangwan</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway's Songhu branch line increased the ticket price between Tiantong'an and Jiangwan stations from five cents to one dime, the number of passengers has decreased significantly. This is because there are public buses operating on this section, and the bus fare is only 23 copper coins, and it can go directly to Jiangwan Town, which is more convenient than taking the train. Therefore, in the past, most passengers abandoned the train and took the bus instead. It is now heard that the railway bureau intends to reduce the ticket price between Tiantong'an and Jiangwan to facilitate passengers, and it will be implemented soon.</p>

<p>Reporting on the progress of association affairs in various regions</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association held its second national delegates' discussion meeting at the Yipinxiang Hotel yesterday. Representatives from the capital, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Shandong, and other provinces and cities were present. Mrs. Zheng Yangxiu, the chairman, first reported on the situation of membership in various regions and sent a congratulatory telegram to the National Assembly. Then, they commemorated the martyrs Ding Yihua, Liu Luodaiqing, Ma Zugan, Ou Bai, Yang Jingshi, and Li Peisheng, ladies, in a moment of silence. Then, they declared, "The purpose of this association is to make people restrain from all wasteful activities such as smoking, drinking, and gambling. It bears a great mission. Today, representatives from various branches are here to discuss good ways of temperance to achieve our goals." Then, the representative from Nanjing reported on the association's affairs, saying that they had recently carried out four tasks: (1) contacting young women in Nanjing to arouse their interest in the association's work and ideals; (2) starting to select materials and edit textbooks; (3) doing medical and hygiene work for poor women in nearby thatched huts; (4) recruiting members and organizing committees. The association has four goals: (1) not to hope to do great things or talk empty words, but to do some small things practically; (2) to be willing to move people with work, not with ideals; (3) to start from the near and do things from the small to the large, step by step; (4) to do the most with the most economical methods. Then, the representative from Ningbo Mirror reported on the association's affairs, saying that it is important to engage in written publicity to praise the importance of abstinence, and to use general students to work in the association's affairs. Then, representatives from Hudong, Huzhou, and Jiujiang reported on the association's affairs in succession, saying that they are working hard to promote it to the villagers and the public to let them know the benefits of abstinence, and to let students persuade relatives and friends not to smoke or drink alcohol, and to run people's schools and workers' night schools to instill knowledge. The representatives from Guangdong and Beiping did not have time to report due to time constraints. After the reports were finished, it was already past 4 o'clock. The directors and affairs department opened a welcome meeting for representatives from various branches, followed by a banquet. After dinner, Ms. Liu Wang Liming gave a speech on the local contribution of the association in ten years, which was quite poignant.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Murder on the Xinjiangtian Ship <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The murderer has been sent to the Ningbo Court</p>
<p>The union is in negotiations</p>
<p>The Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ningbo liner Xinjiangtian returned to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday. There was a tragic case of murder on board caused by a fight between a waiter and a carpenter. The reporter received a report from a passenger on the ship and went to investigate the details of the incident from all parties. The details are recorded as follows: Gambling Fight: The Xinjiangtian ship specializes in the Shanghai-Ningbo route. At 5 PM on the 12th, it departed from Shanghai. At about 7 PM, while sailing in the Sanjia Water area, waiters, carpenters, coppersmiths, sailors, and others gathered in the coppersmith's room to play Pai Gow. The carpenter Jiang Amao bet one yuan, and a waiter bet two yuan. At that time, everyone wanted to compete to see the cards and sit at the door. The two refused to give in to each other, which led to a quarrel. First, they argued, then they wrestled, but unexpectedly, it led to a tragic disaster of murder. Carpenter Injured: During the fight, the carpenter Jiang Amao from Fenghua was held by a waiter, who then punched him hard. The order was chaotic for a while. Later, sailors and others stepped forward to separate the two. The waiter was still unwilling and wanted to fight the carpenter again, but was stopped by the sailors. After being twisted and beaten by a waiter, Jiang Amao returned to his cabin to rest. Because of injuries to his chest and waist, he was in unbearable pain. He called his foster son, (14 years old, working as a waiter on the ship), to the room to massage him. Sudden Death: Not long after Jiang Amao returned to his room, purple marks appeared on his chest, and his breathing was not smooth. His foster son stroked his body, but it was ineffective. He felt more severe pain and discomfort in his waist and abdomen. Colleagues suspected it was acute cholera and called someone in the ship who could relieve Sha to treat him. Unexpectedly, around 11 PM at night, when the person who pricked Sha came to the room, Jiang had already died. It was less than four hours from the fight. Murderer Sent to the Bureau: After Jiang died, his foster son reported it to the chief mate and the captain, who placed the murderer, a waiter, under custody, and waited until dawn (the 13th) when the ship arrived in Ningbo to report to the customs. The customs sent a doctor to inspect the ship, and the deceased's body showed purple and black swelling, which was obviously caused by beating. The murderer was sent to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the court for judicial trial. The deceased's body was also moved ashore. Court Inspection: After accepting the case, the court first sent someone to inspect the deceased Jiang Amao. The chest, abdomen, waist, and other parts were covered with black swelling, which was obviously caused by external injuries. After re-examining the internal organs, there were no injuries, and the sudden death was also very suspicious. The murderer, the waiter, was first detained, and then the body was prepared for coffin collection, and his family was notified. After they came to Ningbo from Fenghua, the case will be opened for trial. Union Negotiation: Yesterday, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, the shipowner reported to the General Administration that the carpenter and waiter were both in the union, and this matter had nothing to do with the administration, and had nothing to do with the bureau, so it was operating as usual. However, the carpenter had reported this matter to the Junan Association and asked for an appeal, while the waiter had also reported to the union and asked for assistance, saying that this case was very bizarre, and the external injuries alone were not necessarily fatal. Please help to clarify the injustice. The two trade unions are in negotiations on this matter.</p>

<p>Dr. Wade, a world expert on leprosy, gave a lecture yesterday afternoon at 4 PM at the invitation of the Shanghai Women's Support Association of the China Leprosy Relief Association. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by the China Leprosy Relief Association. There were more than a dozen people, including Zhuang Xiyan and Chen Bingding, of the Overseas Chinese Commercial Inspection Group from the Dutch East Indies, Mr.乔邓氏, Director of the Public Concession Health Department, Mr. 巴德森, Director of Renji Hospital, Lai Zuguang, school doctor of Shanghai University, Yan Fuqing, Dean of the Medical School of Central University,邝富灼, 刁信德, 张嘉甫, 李观森, and 朱少屏, etc., dozens of people. As the wine was being enjoyed, Chairman Li Yuanxin delivered a welcome speech, followed by a speech by Mr. Wade, who said, "In the past, leprosy relief work relied entirely on the efforts of the missionaries, but now enthusiastic people from the society are rising up to participate. The success of the Philippines in eradicating leprosy is due to this. Leprosy was considered incurable a few years ago, but in fact, it was because treatment was too late, so the treatment period had passed. According to my experience and the research of leprosy experts from various countries, there is no doubt that leprosy can be cured." Then, Chen Zhanchen, a member of the Overseas Chinese Commercial Inspection Group from the Dutch East Indies, gave a speech. Finally, Wu Zhijian, the general secretary of the association, reported on the association's five-year movement, such as convening a national leprosy conference to investigate the leprosy population in China and formulating leprosy laws, and constructing leprosy hospitals in various provinces, etc. The great plans moved the listeners. It was already past 10 o'clock when the meeting was dismissed. It was also heard that Mr. Wade attended the Rotary Club lecture yesterday. This Sunday afternoon at 5 PM, he will give a lecture at the Chinese YMCA and show a film on leprosy work. At that time, people from all walks of life can go to listen to the lecture.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Housing Dispute in Bao'an Fang, French Concession <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Landlord Pretends to Repair, Orders Tenants to Evacuate</p>
<p>Tenants Meet to Plan Unified Response</p>
<p>The Bao'an Fang houses on Bauer Road in the French Concession, totaling more than 40 buildings, are owned by the Bao'an Real Estate Company. The houses are only eight years old and look brand new. In April of this year, the landlord suddenly notified the tenants that they would be "undergoing major repairs" starting on May 5th and demanded that all tenants vacate by the end of April. Upon hearing this news, all the tenants were panicked, believing that the houses were brand new and did not need major repairs. Even if minor repairs were needed, there was no need to demand that all tenants evacuate. Therefore, they unanimously expressed their opposition and negotiated with the landlord, requesting that they withdraw the order to force them to evacuate. However, the landlord ignored them and sent people to notify the tenants to vacate within the deadline, otherwise the construction would begin. The entire tenant community, due to ineffective requests, convened a general meeting yesterday afternoon at 1 PM to discuss countermeasures. All the tenants arrived and elected Xu Zhiming as chairman. After reporting, the tenants expressed their opinions one after another and decided as follows: (1) The landlord is using repairs as an excuse to force tenants to evacuate. This kind of action may have other intentions and we vow to oppose it to the death. (2) Officially establish a tenants' union. (3) Elect Xu Zhiming, Yuan Zhuoren, and Peng Buqing as representatives to be responsible for handling negotiations. (4) The Tenants' Union will first submit a written reply to the landlord, asking them to withdraw the order immediately. (5) Submit a petition to the municipal government, the municipal party department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the French Concession Taxpayers Association to uphold justice and provide assistance. (6) Issue a declaration seeking unified assistance from all walks of life. (7) All tenants unite and resolutely use all their strength to deal with the situation, no matter what. (8) If necessary, hire a lawyer to protect their rights according to the law. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions.</p>

<h3 id="e145">The Main Culprit of the Massive Robbery of the Four Banks, Yuan Awei, Was Arrested <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Last summer, 46,000 yuan of the Four Banks' reserve fund was stolen. Later, the police successively arrested ten robbers, who were separately sentenced by the court. However, the main culprit of the case, Yuan Awei (ie Yuan Amao), escaped the net. Almost a year has passed. At 9:30 the night before last, Wang Changgen, the detective chief of the Old Gate Police Station, together with the French Police Station, captured Yuan Awei on Zilaihuo Street. Under investigation, in addition to this case, he was also involved in the kidnapping of Lou Kenchai and the robbery of a family surnamed in Xinzha Road. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court, but Yuan only admitted to having been divided 200 yuan of the stolen money from the Four Banks case, and denied everything else. Judge Zhou ordered him to be detained for further investigation of evidence, and ordered him to be interrogated again at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Squid Boat Registration Craze Has Become a Lawsuit <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The eighteen salt-producing squid boats that arrived in Wusong the day before yesterday caused a conflict with the Ships Office of the Public Utilities Bureau. Details of the situation have been published in this newspaper. It is now known that the businessmen of Song Town were outraged by the deliberate obstruction of the Ships Office, and they jointly signed a public presentation to the Song Chamber of Commerce, requesting assistance. Zheng Shuban, the chairman of the chamber, because the attitudes of both sides were firm and mediation was ineffective, reported the situation to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Finance, Public Utilities, and Public Security Bureaus, requesting that Director Yang be removed from his post and investigated in order to follow public opinion and maintain commerce. Yesterday morning, he handed over the injured sailors of the four ships that had been guaranteed to the Fourth Patrol Team. The captain of the team, Ding Xiaoping, personally led the police to escort the sailors of the four ships onto the team's small steamboat, which sailed to Shanghai and transferred them to the local court for trial. The fish market sent representatives Dong Luqing (manager of Baofeng), Sun Shaoce (owner of Cuisheng Firm), Jiang Futai, and Hu to the local court to file a lawsuit.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Another Suspect Interrogated in the Woman's Strangle Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Xu Lu, who lived across from the Minli Middle School on Zhonghua Road, was strangled to death by someone who broke into her home on the night of March 12th of this year. After investigating the case, Prosecutor Wu of the Local Court reported that a nephew of Qiao Zhishan, the former Sixteen Shops landord, had a secret affair with Ms. Xu Lu, and that the nephew's daughter-in-law had come to the deceased's home to quarrel and scold her a few days before the murder. There were no leads to be found, so Shao Meisheng, the landlord of the corpse site, was summoned to inquire about Qiao's nephew's name and address. The landlord reported that his name was Qiao Fusheng and he lived on Mietuo Street. So Qiao was summoned for questioning, but he denied any affair. The judge detained Qiao Fusheng. At the same time, a nephew who lived on the upper floor of the deceased was also suspected, and the judge also ordered an investigation. However, the judge believed that the two were only suspects, so he personally went to the corpse house with the police chief yesterday to investigate and drew a picture for research. He also asked those who were detained again, hoping to make a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Seizure of Large Amount of Tax-Evasion Cigarettes <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that tax evasion by cigarette merchants in the concession is unavoidable. In the past, due to the protection of unequal treaties, tax officials were unable to investigate. If this continues for a long time, it will not only reduce tax revenue, but also lose sovereignty. It specially negotiated with the Shanghai leader to establish a general tax inspection office for cigarettes on Hong Kong Road, and appointed officials Yang Wenchun and Lin Wenji as inspectors. The Public Works Bureau also sent Liang Baosen, who was previously a political detective, to assist in the inspection to avoid misunderstandings by merchants and the public. The inspection office has officially started work and has been announced to merchants and the public by the Ministry of Finance. However, cigarettes that do not comply with the regulations to purchase and affix stamps are still found. The day before yesterday at noon, Liang and the other three inspectors discovered a large number of tax-evading cigarettes in the house at 721 Qipu Road, and some of them were counterfeit. The cigarettes were seized and stored in the police station, and the cigarette seller, Hu Hongyuan, was arrested. Yesterday morning, the police station lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Xunjiu filed lawsuits in the Fifth and Sixth Summary Courts, accusing him of tax evasion and counterfeiting. Hu also hired lawyer E Sen to defend him. The judges of the two courts conducted a preliminary trial. Because both cases still need to be investigated, the counterfeiting case was rescheduled for this Saturday, and the tax evasion case was postponed to the next session. It is heard that if tax evasion is discovered, according to the regulations, a fine of 30 times the amount of tax evaded will be imposed, which can be said to be severe.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Fire at a Car Shop Again <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Two Fires in One Month are Suspicious</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, a sudden fire broke out at the Pacific Bicycle Shop at 609 Gongguan Road in the French Concession. Fortunately, the Fire Department made efforts to put out the fire, which was extinguished. Only one rear shack and a few utensils were burned. However, misfortune never comes singly. At 7:45 yesterday morning, another fire broke out in the bedroom upstairs of the shop. The flames soared into the sky. The Fire Department drove to the scene and extinguished the fire after a while. It is heard that the losses were still small. However, the police station believes that there have been two fires in the shop in one month, which is suspicious. The police officer arrested the fire starter and sent him to the police station for referral to the court for punishment.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church's Yao Bishop of the entire Jiangsu Province, aged eighty-seven, resided within the Catholic Church on Yong'an Street in the French Concession for convenient communication regarding church affairs. Recently, he fell ill, and despite medical treatment, he passed away at 7:05 AM the day before yesterday. The bishop's duties have been ascended to by Bishop Wei. The church and its officials have arranged for Bishop Hu to hold a memorial High Mass ceremony today (the 15th) at 8:00 AM, followed by the encoffining. The body is currently in the church, and Chinese and foreign believers are continuously arriving to pay their respects. The Xujiahui Catholic Church is scheduled to hold a Yao Bishop memorial High Mass on the 18th in the morning. On the same day, after encoffining the Yao Bishop's body, it will be transported to the Holy Land (said to be buried outside the Great South Gate).</p>

<p>A Jiading woman, Zhou Shi, residing at No. 1553 Runde Lane, Gongping Road, aged twenty-three, secretly smoked opium at home at 9:30 PM last night. She was rushed to the hospital for treatment, and her life is feared to be in danger. According to acquaintances, her husband, Zhou Shuping, works at the Hua'an Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road and earns a considerable monthly income. His first wife, Shen, has already passed away, and Shi is his concubine. Recently, she has been indulging in gambling and exhibiting improper behavior, which displeased her husband, leading to last night's tragic event.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Donating Land and Money for Disaster Relief is Commendable <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jishui Association previously received a report from Mr. Li Junyu, the director handling disaster relief in Siyang and Suqian counties of Jiangsu Province, stating that a certain great philanthropist in Huai'an, deeply concerned about the severe disaster situation in Siyang and Suqian, generously decided to sell 280 mu of his land in Liwei, Suqian, originally valued at 9,000 yuan, to provide disaster relief. However, due to the difficulty in selling it for that price at the time, he was willing to reduce it to 7,500 yuan, to be divided between Siyang and Suqian counties, the areas most severely affected by water bandits. Previously, Director Li had telegraphed that a certain land had already been prepared with a price of 1,500 yuan to be used for disaster relief in Siyang and Suqian. Now, a written telegram has been received from Director Li stating that, in addition to donating the land price to Siyang and Suqian for disaster relief, the great philanthropist has also donated 1,500 silver dollars to assist Siyang's disaster relief efforts. At this time of food scarcity before the new harvest, with prompt investigation and distribution, many disaster victims have been saved. This great philanthropist, selfless and righteous, and deeply concerned for the people, has donated his own land and substantial funds. Such enthusiasm for disaster relief is truly commendable and can serve as an inspiration. It is hoped that fellow benevolent individuals at home and abroad will be inspired to rise up and jointly rescue the victims of this great calamity.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Tang Yi's Telegram to Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou inquiry: Deng Zeru, Lin Zichao, Xiao Focheng, Gu Xiangqin, esteemed sirs, I have recently read in the newspapers your telegram of the 30th, pointing out the shortcomings of current affairs, ostensibly impeaching officials, and listing my humble name, making baseless attacks. I have considered it repeatedly, but I cannot understand the reason. Since the rise of the Northern Expeditionary Army, the reason why I, Yi, have never uttered a word or offered a suggestion is not for any other reason. I believe that the foundation for the success of the revolution lies in unity and the avoidance of division. If those who discuss politics are so eager to express their own opinions that they do not take the time to choose carefully, they will inevitably end up supporting the warlords and losing their original purpose. Therefore, I have been constantly anxious and uneasy, and have taken inaction as the guiding principle, and have not wavered from this course for several years. However, during my time in Tianjin, some people accused me of being a reactionary and regarded me as having obvious bad records. In recent years, residing in Shanghai, you gentlemen have compared me to those who are engaged in behind-the-scenes activities and regarded me as holding an important position. If there are no such actions, how can there be bad records? I have never held office, so how can there be any important position? The previous discussion is self-evident and needs no further debate. Let me concede a point and speak of recent events. It may be that the telegram with your signatures was written by a secretary or based on hearsay from afar. Even if there are inaccuracies, it would not be a burden. However, the accusations of wrongdoing against me are extremely insulting and cannot be accepted by Yi. I am now briefly recounting past events to inform you gentlemen and await your judgment. Although Yi's conduct and abilities may be lacking, he has his own standing in the history of the Republic of China's revolution. Since the founding of the Republic of China, with the establishment of the Kuomintang, Yi's dedication to the Party's political department and its organs, and his ideals, have been clearly revealed. From the meeting of representatives of various provinces in the Xinhai Revolution to the Nanjing Senate and then the National Assembly, I have served in succession, and what I have expressed is generally known to those who are slightly familiar with national affairs. Mr. Lin Zichao was even someone I spent time with day and night. What exactly did I do to oppose the Party, and when did I do it? Please tell me. This is the first point. When the National Assembly was restored in the sixth year of the Republic of China, comrades within the Party were divided into small groups to engage in the distribution of cabinet positions or the hunting of other official posts. Yi was unwilling to do so. I took it upon myself to complete the constitutional work, and because the procedures for discussing the constitution were strict and required a two-thirds majority to pass, I had to remain neutral and mediate. Therefore, I did not join any small organization, and this was not accidental. I still remember that during the period of the Constitutional Protection Movement, the Political Study Clique's autocracy reached its extreme in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Because Yi had previously advocated reconciliation and caused misunderstandings, I had no choice but to admit defeat and resolutely withdraw. Later, when the military government was reorganized for the second time, comrades in Guangdong resolved to adopt several articles of debarment measures. Therefore, all suspected elements were placed on the list of those to be excluded, but there was no accusation against Yi. I ask you gentlemen today, if you insist on adding my humble name to the end of the Political Study Clique and then be happy, what have you seen that makes you say so? This is the second point. After the ninth year of the Republic of China, Yi resided in Shanghai until May of the eleventh year, when the National Assembly reconvened and I went north. In May of the twelfth year, I declared my intention to go south again due to opposition to bribery in elections. After the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, when the National Assembly became ineffective, although I resided in Pingjin for a long time, I did not associate with any warlords. If I had any contact with them, it was only in the course of my official duties. Aside from attending meetings, I have not been an official for a single day in the past twenty years. The so-called dependence on warlords may be true of other comrades who have missions and have other secret intentions, or there may be some suspicious signs. I did not expect you gentlemen to rashly make such a comparison to Yi. This is the third point. As for the writings I have published over the years, apart from those denouncing the usurpation of power by warlords, opposing bribery in elections, and advocating for various issues related to the Southwestern Constitutional Protection Movement, there are also articles discussing the constitution and the provincial constitution related to the national constitution. Looking back now, I may regret some of my early works, but at the time, they were generally approved by a majority of comrades. Moreover, the disclosure of my advocacy for provincial constitutions occurred long before the announcement of the Prime Minister's Outline of National Reconstruction. How could it be considered a defamation? This is the fourth point. In summary, I have briefly presented here my past words and deeds and my recent attitude, which should be judged by the public. I have previously seen some small newspapers in Shanghai occasionally publish inaccurate reports, and I have often dismissed them with a smile, thinking that the younger generation is unfamiliar with my life and does not understand the past, and often writes hastily, falsely accusing their predecessors. It seemed that there was no need to correct them one by one. I did not expect that such fallacies would spread without end. Your gentlemen's telegram even included them in your accusations. Future generations will view the present as the present views the past. Therefore, I dare not spare words to correct them, to seek your wise judgment and to show it to those who come after. I have presented my thoughts frankly, hoping for your kind understanding. Tang Yi respectfully submits.</p>

<p>Former Finance Minister Zhang Hu arrived in Shanghai last night. When someone inquired about the debt lawsuit in Beijing, Zhang said that he had entrusted Zhang Jinji Lumber Mill to build a house in Tianjin, but because the project did not conform to the contract, about two or three thousand yuan of the final payment had not been paid. While I was in Tianjin, Zhang Jinji filed a lawsuit in Beiping. Now I hear that I am traveling south, they have followed me here and sued me in the Jiangning Local Court. I, respecting the court, personally went to court, only answered a few questions and then withdrew, and there was no detention overnight. The capital is nearby, and it is self-evident. I am sincerely afraid that friends from afar will misunderstand, so I am stating the truth here.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Settlement of Wage Arrears for Employees of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ships <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The wage strike of the four wharf workers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been resolved through the mediation of Section Chief Shen Zhongyi and others. The wage strike of the sailors on various ships has also been calmed down. The sailors on the company's ships were owed a total of two or three months' wages. The former administration issued checks for two or three months' wages, but upon maturity, they could not be cashed, resulting in a check bouncing dispute. At this time, the bureau members received a bonus of one and a half months' salary. The sailors on the various ships were greatly dissatisfied, believing that those who risked their lives in the wind and waves were still owed wages, while the land-based staff were comfortably receiving bonuses. They decided to go on strike unanimously. Che Defang, the director of the All-Safety Association, earnestly persuaded the members and, at the same time, represented them to the bureau, requesting the new commissioner to expedite the payment of the arrears. After two days and nights of tireless persuasion, he pleaded with the sailors to consider the overall situation and not to go on strike for the arrears owed by the former administration at the beginning of the new commissioner's term. Che Defang shuttled between labor and management, tirelessly enduring complaints. On the 12th, the bureau cashed the wage arrears checks. Che ordered the water and medical officers of each ship to instruct the workers to resume work and set sail as usual. After the wages were issued, people were sent by car to deliver them to the ships en route. The matter was resolved satisfactorily, and the strike wave on the various ships subsided invisibly. As for the wage arrears for April, they will be issued when the ships return to Shanghai. Mr. Che also prevented the workers from issuing a declaration requesting social judgment on the wage arrears case, and did not allow it to be published.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Bookbinding Industry Scheduled to Resume Work Today <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Awaiting mediation by the Social Bureau</p>
<p>More than 2,000 workers from 140 local Chinese and Western bookbinding companies, including Ma Hongji, went on strike. The Municipal Social Bureau yesterday instructed the workers to resume work first, and the wage issue will be mediated after the union submits a report before the 24th. The various situations are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Notice of Resumption of Work: Yesterday, the board of directors of the bookbinding industry workers' union issued a notice stating, "Regarding the notice, we have received instructions from the Municipal Social Bureau to resume work uniformly on the 15th. Because there are many May Revolution anniversaries now, there may be reactionary elements lurking, so we must be cautious. We hope that all workers will obey the instructions of the superiors and the orders of the union, and comply with the resumption of work, while waiting for a solution. Please take note." At the same time, it dispatched more than 30 people, including Yu A'gen and Zheng Shoulin from the East Team, Pan Guo and Zhang Liuyi from the South Team, Jiang Yuanming and Feng Shengru from the West Team, and Shen Changjiang and Director Shouxiang from the North Team, to persuade the workers to resume work first.</p>
<p>Workers Arrested: At around 11:00 PM on the 13th, two workers, Pan Fa and Yu Huaian, from Qiu Peiji Bookbinding, went to Chen Jinji, No. 9 North Gongyi Lane, because the workers there had violated the strike discipline and were working privately. They went to persuade them, but a conflict arose from the words, and then they fought each other. They were arrested by the First Precinct of the Fourth District and, after questioning, were sent to the Zhabei Judicial Section yesterday for review. The union sent people to request bail. Workers from Mao Haoji on Xiangshan Road and Xie Feng on Zhiyuan Road violated the discipline and were destroyed by the crowd. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched police to protect them.</p>
<p>Book Industry Meeting: The Bookbinding Industry Trade Association previously dispatched Ding Handong and Xu Hanqing with letters to the Book Industry Trade Association, requesting a 40% increase in book prices. Yesterday, the association replied, "Regarding the letter from your association requesting a 40% increase in bookbinding prices for bookbinding workers, we have learned that our industry has been facing increased costs and sluggish business in recent years, and we are unable to increase prices. In addition to inviting the industry to meet again at 4:00 PM on the 16th to discuss, we will reply first. Please note."</p>
<h3 id="e159">Statistics on Workers' Wages and Working Hours in This City <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Disclosed by the Municipal Social Bureau</p>
<p>This city has never had comprehensive wage statistics. If there are any, they started with the "Shanghai Wages and Working Hours in 1929" compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau. The bureau investigated more than 20 important industries in this city, with 2,326 factories and a total of 285,700 workers. It took a year to complete the compilation. The content is divided into three parts: Part 1, Compilation Method of Wage and Working Hour Statistics, discusses in detail the types of wage statistics, the sources of wage statistics, business classification, job classification, wage index, and compilation method of working hour statistics, etc. Part 2, Wage Rate and Working Hour Statistics in 1929, contains an analysis of the number of factories and workers in this city, and the average wage rate and working hour materials for each industry are very rich and accurate. Part 3, Statistics on Actual Income of Workers in 1929, examines in detail the reasons for the monthly changes in the average number. Mr. Kong Xiangxi of the Ministry of Industry wrote in the preface, "The enumeration is comprehensive and profound, and the insights are thorough. The publication of this book will greatly benefit the people of the country." Mr. Raymond Moley of the New York Social Research Science Institute in the United States wrote in the preface, "This report can be said to be a practical attempt to study the problems caused by modern industry, striving to seek facts and describe them." Professor Lampard of Shanghai University wrote in the preface, "This kind of factual truth is the result of research conducted with a fair attitude and scientific methods." In addition, Mr. Chen Changheng and Mr. Chen Huayin of the Legislative Yuan, and Mr. Cai Zhengya, who was in charge of this project, also have prefaces to introduce the book. The book is published by the Commercial Press.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Bureau yesterday ordered the General Manager of the Shenxin Company not to refuse factory inspections. The original order stated, "Regarding the matter of complying with the order, this bureau has been conducting factory inspections since January of this year in preparation for the implementation of the Factory Law. Factories that have been inspected have been notified in advance by letter. However, when staff were sent to the Shenxin No. 1 Cotton Mill for inspection recently, the factory manager, Zheng, refused, claiming that he had received instructions from the General Manager and could not disobey. This is clearly inappropriate and you are hereby ordered to promptly instruct all factories under your jurisdiction that in the future, whenever this bureau sends staff for inspection, they should be properly guided and must not be refused. This is the order."</p>

<h3 id="e163">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges All Industries to Switch to Chinese Insurance <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to all industry associations yesterday, urging them to refuse foreign insurance in the future and switch to insurance companies established by Chinese nationals. The letter reads, "We received a letter from the All-Circles Aid to Xinhaishan Committee on the 12th of this month, stating that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinxin ship encountered a reef and was wrecked en route in 1928, and all the goods on board were lost. Among them, the goods of 55 merchants, including the Minbang Hengyu, had been insured with foreign insurance companies, but after the incident, the companies made excuses to refuse compensation. After the judicial authorities made a judgment, they repeatedly stalled, intending to evade responsibility. Such behavior is not only due to the lack of integrity and morality of foreign merchants, but also an excellent technique of economic aggression by imperialists. If we do not allow ourselves to be fooled, we should refuse to insure with foreign insurance companies in the future. Those who have already insured should withdraw the insurance upon expiration and switch to insurance companies founded by Chinese nationals. Then, similar incidents will not happen again, and the outflow of rights and interests can be recovered in case of emergency. Therefore, at the All-Circles Meeting on the Xinhaishan Case held in this city on April 28, a temporary motion was made by the Sanshan Guild Hall, requesting that all chambers of commerce across the country and all industry associations in this city be notified to refuse insurance with foreign companies in order to prevent future troubles, and it was unanimously passed. We are sending this letter to you to do as requested. In order to ensure that compensation disputes are easily protected in the future, the members of each guild should be ordered to switch to domestic insurance companies for fire and water insurance. If there are any restrictions that have not yet expired, they should be switched to domestic insurance as soon as they expire. If it is limited by facts and domestic insurance companies cannot accommodate all of them, they should also switch to companies that comply with our country's legal jurisdiction. This is related to the commercial interests of each industry, so you must pay attention to it in advance to avoid regrets."</p>
<h3 id="e164">Another Discussion on the Qianzhuang Law <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Yangwen's Reply to Mr. Gu Youdao</p>
<p>Zhou Yangwen's reply to Mr. Gu Youdao on the necessity of the Qianzhuang Law states, "I recently read the submission to the Wuchen Society in Shen Bao, which reprinted Mr. Gu Youdao, a reporter from the Qianye Monthly, on my article "Is the Qianzhuang Law Necessary?" published on May 1. His many arguments show that the interest of the people of the country in the concept of the rule of law is growing stronger, which is a cause for celebration. In summary, the main points of Mr. Gu's paper are: (1) The buying and selling of silver and the import and export of taxes are a type of handling fee for the qianzhuang industry. (2) Credit lending was able to meet the needs of the entire society in the past. (3) Credit lending is a kind of morality. (4) Under the party rule of curbing capital, one should not focus solely on those with capital. (5) Take the silk cocoon and rice lending as an example. Regarding the first point, Mr. Gu has already admitted that it should not exist. He has also admitted the principle of the second point, but questioned that mortgage lending today cannot meet the needs of the entire society. According to the original text of my book, there are many methods of lending, and by using them flexibly, they can not only meet the needs of the entire society, but also help with the people's livelihood. Moreover, they are all beneficial to the industry and commerce that have been established and newly established by the current financial industry, such as the expansion of bill discounting, the verification of goods procurement, etc., which are also included. Unfortunately, Mr. Gu did not have time to examine them in detail. As for the third point, recognizing credit lending as a kind of morality is to directly recognize the financial industry as a charitable organization. The understanding seems to be wrong. Moreover, credit lending has the principle of credit lending. According to the principle of credit lending, there are three major elements: (1) financial resources, (2) ability, and (3) credit. The three are indispensable. If there is financial resources but no credit, then the clearing of creditor's rights and debts will never be straightforward. If there is credit and ability but no financial resources, then it will inevitably lead to being willing but unable to do so. If there is financial resources and credit but no ability, then the career will inevitably fail. However, the number of people in the world who can fully possess these three conditions is actually small, so they have no choice but to seek the next best thing. However, they ultimately recognize financial resources and credit as a whole, so credit lending is not a moral act of benefiting industry and commerce, but a kind of business of using money wisely. Try asking an experienced qianzhuang expert, and he will not deny it. Because the conditions are not complete, the danger is great. This is why the Legislative Yuan under the Party's rule has taken measures to promulgate laws to restrict it. As for the interpretation of the fourth point, it is thought that Mr. Gu is busy with his pen and has not had time to delve into it, so he has not been able to have a true understanding. According to the Prime Minister's curbing of capital, it is to restrict large capitalists from relying on their financial resources to engage in behaviors that are harmful to society and seek improper profits. The restriction is to restrict its occurrence (originally, the current situation in China is great poverty and small poverty), so the equalization of land rights also stipulates large-scale enterprises, preparing for state-owned operations, and it is not for the financial industry that subsidizes the development of industrial and commercial enterprises in accordance with the principle of people's livelihood to make charitable investments. This is why the Banking Law has measures to restrict credit lending, because it does not violate the doctrine. Moreover, in fact, since it is called industry and commerce, there must be capital. Even if it is as small as a stall or a small shop, it must have capital to operate. It has not been heard that the law allows industrial and commercial organizations without funds to operate in society. As for the suppression of the lives of small and medium-sized merchants, I do not know what your opinion is or what evidence you have. Can credit lending really benefit small workers and small businesses? If there are any, they must belong to the small qianzhuang shops that seek high profits, which is truly contrary to the principle of people's livelihood. Moreover, Article 34 of the Banking Law and the original text of my book all support restriction, not complete abolition. It is hoped that Mr. Gu will pay attention to this point. As for the silkworm cocoon lending in the fifth point, it is purely mortgaged and is a customary practice in the qianzhuang industry. There are also the methods of inner thirty-seven and outer thirty-seven, sending people to supervise and transport the cocoons to the warehouse, and using the bill of lading as a mortgage certificate. The goods never leave the hands of the supervisor for a moment. Who would say that it is not a mortgage? This method has been practiced in the qianzhuang industry for a long time. I think Mr. Gu does not deeply understand the operating methods of the qianzhuang industry. Moreover, there are many types of mortgage lending, and there are also many operating methods that are constantly changing. Unfortunately, I am limited by space and cannot describe them to Mr. Gu.</p>

<p>The World Photography Grand Competition launched by Kodak Company, No. 24 Yuanmingyuan Road, has passed swiftly for more than three and a half months. Photography enthusiasts from near and far have submitted photos in a continuous stream. Although there are many good works, the majority are childish.

Therefore, winning an award is as easy as picking something from a bag, as easy as turning your hand over. Now, there are only fifteen days left before the deadline. Time is urgent and will pass quickly. Those who love photography and have not yet joined should make a decisive decision and join quickly to win the championship. Those who have already joined should take more photos and submit them to the competition. Because taking more photos means getting more chances to win an award. Those who are interested in joining, please go to the competition office of the company to read the detailed rules and consult everything.</p>

<p>Zhang Luzhen, a businessman from Jiangyin residing in Shanghai, established the Chinese Natural Marble Factory on Jumen Road in the southern city with the aim of promoting domestic products. Two years ago, he sent people to various provinces in the north and south to collect various colors of marble. Currently, more than 20 production areas have been explored, with dozens of types of stones in red, green, yellow, white, and black. After expert examination, the quality is firm and fine, and the gloss is bright, surpassing imported products. Currently, mining has been carried out separately, and the stones are being shipped to Shanghai successively. Various application machines have also been installed and are ready for use, including sawing, grinding, and cutting departments. Mr. Takagi Kyusaburo, a Japanese who has been engaged in this industry for a long time and is rich in experience, has been hired as an engineer and has already started work. A sales department has been set up at No. 433 Jing'an Temple Road, displaying various samples for people to visit. The factory will be officially opened in the coming days. The factory also has a kind of sesame stone, which is also a good domestic product. The black spots have different shades and sizes. It is especially cheap and beautiful for building exterior walls and tombstones. Because the factory aims to promote domestic products, the pricing of all stone materials is particularly low.</p>

<p>Huang Boqiao, the director of the Public Works Bureau of this city, noted that all streetlights in the city are foreign goods, resulting in significant annual losses. Due to previous contracts with foreign merchants, it was not possible to change to domestic goods abruptly. After investigating, the electric bulbs produced by the China Ya'pu'er Factory in the city are of good quality. Director Huang and the section chiefs visited the factory and praised them highly. Therefore, after the expiration of the foreign merchants' contracts this year, all bulbs except for the previously stored imported goods will be replaced with domestic Ya'pu'er electric bulbs to promote domestic products. It is reported that the contract was signed a few days ago by Mr. Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of the factory, at the Public Works Bureau.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news in your newspaper on May 14 about the riot of boatmen in Wusong, there is a section stating that Yang Shaozhen, a staff member of the Wusong Shipping Office of this bureau, injured boatman Wang Jinyu with a punt pole. After investigation, Yang Shaozhen was first working on a sand barge when he saw the boatmen rushing over, trapping the small boat of the sand barge, intending to report to the police. Wang Jinyu and others ordered the sand barge to detain Yang Shaozhen. When the people on the boat refused, they fought each other and were injured. At that time, Yang Shaozhen had already swum away. How could he have injured anyone again? The record is inaccurate and confuses the public. Please correct it immediately.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Yesterday (May 14th), I read about the incident of Mr. Pan Ruijie encountering bandits in your newspaper's local news, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. On the morning of May 13th, at around 2:00 AM, the director of the First District, Second Precinct of this bureau reported that police officer Sun Yuwang, who was stationed at the New Open River Flour Exchange, reported to the precinct that a car suddenly came to the entrance of the exchange. Three men in suits got out of the car and went straight upstairs. I (the police officer claiming) saw the suspicious appearance and questioned the tea room attendant at the exchange, asking who these three people were. The tea room attendant replied that he did not know. I immediately went forward to question them, but the three men, seeing that someone was questioning them, turned around and got into the car, driving towards the French Concession. After receiving the report, the director immediately sent a patrol officer to investigate. Mr. Pan Ruijie also heard the police and suspected that they were bandits scouting the area. The director praised the police officer Sun Yuwang for his careful service, but it was a pity that he did not record the car's license plate number in a hurry, making it difficult to track. The truth of the matter is only as such. Please correct it in your newspaper to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Public Security Bureau, May 14th.</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper on May 13th, in the local news column, a section on the lawsuit between the China Accumulator Battery Factory and the Huiming Factory, which included the phrase "unexpectedly, Ding Xiongzhao, He Cai, etc. under his jurisdiction." I, the humble person, am an engineer hired by the Huiming Factory and have no relationship with the China Accumulator Battery Factory or Hu Guoguang personally. How could I be referred to as being under his jurisdiction? Please correct this.</p>

<p>— Da Mei</p>
<p>Chu Minyi's Lecture on Tai Chi Exercises</p>
<p>On the 11th, I visited a friend at the Soochow University Law School. That day happened to be Monday, and the school held a memorial week. Mr. Chu Minyi, a Central Committee member, came to the school to give a lecture, so I was pestered by my friend to attend and listen to his speech. Mr. Chu, as a Central Committee member, has long been renowned at home for advocating physical education. Recently, he invented the so-called Tai Chi exercises, promoting them tirelessly. His name has also spread overseas. Mr. Chu's lecture at Soochow this time was also on Tai Chi exercises. Some people regard promoting boxing as a minor matter, but they do not know that physical education has a great relationship with national health. In his lectures on nationalism, Dr. Sun Yat-sen also diligently hoped for the health of individuals. Now, I will select the interesting points from Mr. Chu's lecture and record them as follows.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu said that the characteristic of Tai Chi exercises is that the movements of the hands and feet take a circular line instead of a straight line. He believes that the movement of the muscles and bones of the human body is not always confined to front and back. Ordinary gymnastics only focus on straight lines and lack the inner and outer circular twists, which is a defect. After further examination from a mechanical point of view, the superiority of the circular line over the straight line is even more evident. Take a fan as an example. Waving a fan to cool off is a straight line. A step further, people sew a large fan from cloth and hang it in the room, pulling it with a rope. The result is better, but the movement of the fan is still a straight line. When machinery developed, foreigners used electricity to make electric fans. Electric fans have four blades, and their movement no longer takes a straight line but a circular shape. This is one example. In water transportation, there were old sailing ships that used manual oars or paddles. Their movement also took a straight line. When the steam engine came out, wings replaced oars, and they moved around in a circular line. This is the second example. Other examples include airplanes. The principle is actually derived from birds. When birds fly, their wings move up and down, which is also a straight line. However, the wings of airplanes have been changed to take a circular line of rotation, and the results are far better than the flight of birds. This is the third example. Therefore, my Tai Chi exercises take a circular line instead of a straight line.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu also said that people commonly say that those with a short philtrum will not live long. Although there is no scientific basis for this statement, I can prove that there is a good reason for it. The air contains a large amount of dirt and microorganisms, so hygienists often urge people not to breathe through their mouths but to use their noses instead. There is hair in the nose, and the path to the lungs is tortuous and long. During breathing, the dirt and microorganisms in the air are not easy to enter directly. Anyone who breathes through their mouth often opens their mouth wide. The habit of opening the mouth wide causes the upper lip to bend and shorten. The so-called short philtrum is due to this. The dirt and microorganisms in the air can attack the lungs at any time, as if entering a deserted place. It is unlikely that they will not get sick and die early.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu continued to describe the key points of Tai Chi exercises, demonstrating them himself as he spoke. He personally demonstrated them on the podium, as if he were a gymnastics teacher. He had three slogans for promoting Tai Chi exercises: first, it does not take time. The whole set has six sections, which can be completed in more than ten minutes. Second, it does not cost money because no equipment is needed, and no fixed place is required. It can be done anytime, anywhere. Third, it does not take effort. The whole set of movements is light and easy, and both the elderly, children, and women can do it.</p>
<p>After Mr. Chu finished speaking, Mr. Wu Jingxiong, the dean of the Soochow Law School, came forward to give a thank-you speech. Mr. Wu is a follower of Dongfang Shuo. His first sentence at the opening was: I have another word to add to Mr. Chu's reasons for Tai Chi exercises not taking a straight line but a circular line, that is, the circular line has the beauty of a curve. After speaking, he bent his hands up and down, left and right, in the shape of a celestial maiden scattering flowers. There was a burst of laughter in the hall, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>

<p>— Qing Deng</p>
<p>Dr. Da Fenbeixi of New York, USA, has taken X-rays of chicken eggs, conducting extremely interesting experiments. This kind of experiment has a great impact on the incubation of chicken eggs and chicks. Most of the chicken eggs are exposed to X-rays, some for only a few minutes, and some for several hours. There are different effects. Those exposed for only a few minutes hatched chicks that were more than 90% female, which is far different from the normal male and female ratio. Those exposed for several hours found a wonderful phenomenon. The chicks hatched were not the same as those of modern times. In the structure of the body, there is a sudden and distinct improvement. According to general scientists, this improvement would require hundreds of years of evolutionary process. But now, after one X-ray, the phenomenon after hundreds of years has suddenly changed. This is amazing.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Old and New Tales of Yangzhou Salt Merchants (Part 2) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Weng</p>
<p>After I left Leping, I worked in Nanjing. One day, I received two telegrams from Yangzhou, saying, "Come quickly." It turned out that Zhang Ziwei, the salt transport commissioner, had summoned me to diagnose his illness. The next day, I took a fast train to Yangzhou and stayed in the Osmanthus Hall of the salt transport commissioner's office. I heard an old man in the office say that the salt transport commissioner's office used to have 999 rooms, but now most of them have collapsed. When Zeng Bingu and Lu Yayu were transport commissioners, all the salt merchants paid tribute every year in addition to their regular salaries, which was a very large amount. Now, it has been reduced by sixty or seventy percent. As for the level of salt administration, the high-handedness, and the internal and external obscurity of the reports, they are regarded as routine and cannot be enumerated. Last year, the Ministry ordered the transport commissioner's office to be moved to Huaibei, and those who relied on the transport commissioner's office to eat suddenly became embarrassed and almost cried and laughed.</p>
<p>In the past, I rented a residence in Wufu Lane in Yangzhou, next to the Geyuan Garden. The owner of Geyuan Garden was named Zhiyun, styled Geyuan, from Ganquan. He was orphaned at the age of fourteen. People seized his inheritance. At the age of nineteen, he rode a donkey to the capital and met a salt administrator of Lianghuai with a letter from his father's friend. He spoke with him and was amazed by his talent. He was regarded as the chief salt merchant of Lianghuai, with the title of salt transport commissioner added to his rank of Dao and Fu. He entered the capital to celebrate the emperor's birthday and was rewarded with listening to a play in the Yuanmingyuan Garden and bestowed with cash. At that time, from the salt administrator to the salt merchants, they all regarded him as a barometer. When people in Yangzhou talked to each other, they would inevitably mention him as the leading figure. He collected thousands of famous paintings and calligraphy, but he did not like music and pleasure. He once went to Su Mei's singing house to invite guests, spending thousands of gold coins a day. People were surprised by his actions. It happened that a Westerner admired him and belonged to transporting more than one million silver, and the report of the sale was obtained as scheduled. His courage and wisdom were indeed unmatched. This can be seen in the biographies of Mei Boyan and Huang Geyuan. In less than a few decades, the family declined day by day. The flowers, trees, pavilions, and rockeries in the garden remain the same. When he died, people entered the room, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Who is the one who entered the room? It was a salt merchant named Li. He had a rich feast and was arrogant and indulgent. He was frivolous and danced and sang wildly. Passersby looked at him with sideways glances. At that time, there was a poem mocking him: "The moon-white shirt is truly handsome, the water-red hat is suspected to be expensive. The chess pole is erected high behind the door, and the base of the inner room is secretly opened. Most of the time, he sits in the green spring, and the waiter shouts loudly, 'Master is here.'" This is what Mr. Li did when he was alive. After Mr. Li died, the family declined day by day, and only twenty or thirty percent of the Geyuan Garden's buildings remained. The rest were rented out. However, even these twenty or thirty percent are still worth seeing. I and Mr. Yang from Xinghua visited it. Broken stones and scattered monuments, empty pavilions and fallen flowers. I saw two large seal characters on the door plaque: Geyuan Garden. Mr. Li is not worthy of regret, but I am secretly sad for Huang Geyuan. If the new salt law is implemented in the future and taxes are collected on the spot without relying on the lead merchants, I do not know what the tragic situation will be for the sons and grandsons of the lead merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Wax Beauty <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Bing</p>
<p>This column often publishes works of art, such as hand-捏 portraits, which are lifelike and become elegant legends. It is admired as an absolute skill. This is what Westerners regard as precious and rare. Recently, according to Mr. Yu, who is studying in France, Paris has rich and famous techniques, and wax beauties are particularly handy and unmatched by other countries. The so-called wax beauties are always displayed in major commercial stores, and occasionally famous ladies in boudoirs or beautiful singers invest in styling for appreciation. Although the forms are of different sizes, the characters are vivid, and viewers often linger and are reluctant to leave. Therefore, I record what I have heard to give a glimpse.</p>
<p>To make a perfect wax beauty, you must first find a model with a beautiful face and a lithe figure. Usually, models are hired for people to describe, and they take off their clothes to reveal the beauty of the body. However, this is not a necessary condition for those hired to make wax figures. What the model should pay attention to is only the beautiful posture. Therefore, experts often provide guidance, teaching various forms to make the whole body beautiful and touching. Then, they focus their eyes and wave their hands, conveying the spirit and describing the shape, forming the negative molds of each part. Those with exquisite skills often do not need to modify them. Once they are matched, it is like a peerless beauty.</p>
<p>The negative mold is made of clay. After it is dry, wax juice is poured into it, leaving a hollow outer contour. After a while, it is moistened with water and removed, and the wax real shape is formed. At this point, there is still important work to be done, such as fitting autumn water pupils into the eye sockets, installing gourd teeth into the oral cavity, and adding delicate operations everywhere to make the eyebrows like black ink and the blue silk like clouds. In this way, the limbs and face are decorated in a fashionable way, and then they are decorated with colors to make the apple cheeks and ice and snow skin complement each other to make a perfect beauty. It is said that the cost of a beauty is at least 50 pounds, and many of the skills are passed down from generation to generation, and ordinary sculptors cannot胜任云.</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Arrived in Dalian on the 21st. It's a place I visited before, but there is one thing that I have never seen before, and I can't help but be shocked. That is the Manchurian-Mongolian Resources Hall established by the South Manchuria Railway Company.</p>
<p>"The South Manchuria Railway Company, under the beautiful name of Japan-China coexistence and co-prosperity, invests more than 440 million in railways, shipping, mines, forests, copper, iron, agriculture, and animal husbandry in its territory. Although the name is semi-official and semi-private, the actual power is controlled by the government, giving it diplomatic police and general political power, allowing it to exert imperialism and form a special society, no different from the second Korean unification." These few sentences are not my speculation but are from the memorial of the late Tanaka Cabinet of Japan, as seen in the Current Affairs Monthly in December of the 18th year of the Republic. It is the Japanese government's own供状.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the Resources Hall, there is a large piece of coal, taller than a person by half a body, with commensurate width and thickness. It was obtained from the open-pit excavation of Fushun.</p>
<p>The mineral products department occupies one-fourth of the entire hall, agricultural and forestry products occupy one-fourth, animal husbandry occupies one-fourth, and another fourth is the geological survey institute.</p>
<p>Each department has a large map of important product producing areas and a large statistical chart of production. The mineral products room has a large map model of Manchuria and Mongolia, with electric lights indicating the location and production of important mineral products. Each product has a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>Japan does not produce iron. The steel used is imported from the Yangtze River basin and the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia. They estimate that the proven reserves of iron in South Manchuria are at least 1.2 billion tons. What is even more valuable is that the estimated reserves of coal in the same place, such as Fushun, Benxi, and Xinqiu, are 250 million tons, which is enough to refine 1.2 billion tons of steel for Japan's needs for 70 years. The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant currently produces 200,000 tons of iron per year. The Benxihu Iron and Steel Plant produces 120,000 tons of iron per year. Fushun produces more than 7.4 million tons of coal per year. Benxihu produces 500,000 tons of coal per year. Yantai in Liaoyang County produces 100,000 tons of coal per year. Other places are not listed.</p>

<p>(5) My Disappointment</p>
<p>We left the fourth precinct. Hawthorne drove me home. In the car, we re-discussed this issue. I said to Hawthorne, "This person is really insidious and hateful. If we can't find him and give him a proper retribution, it would be a great shame for us. Imagine what kind of people we will be seen as if he talks about it in front of friends." Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, but the outcome of things lies in the last move. Don't worry for now. I think this time we suffered a loss, it won't just end here." I said, "This time, this person used his intelligence and deception to fool us. I guess he must be our enemy. He must have suffered a loss from us somewhere before, and now he is planning revenge. What do you think?" Hawthorne lowered his head and slowly replied, "Of course, this is a very possible understanding." I said, "In this way, it may not be a clue. We can just look for it from the letter." I said this and immediately stopped. I felt that my words were too vague. How many enemies do we have? Can we know ourselves? In which case did the enemy in front of us结怨? How can we think of it? Fortunately, Hawthorne seemed to be thinking deeply there. He seemed not to have heard my words. He pondered for a while before looking up and saying, "I think there is another reason besides revenge—wait a minute. Isn't this person you have seen with your own eyes?" I replied, "Exactly. If I see him again, I will definitely be able to identify him." Hawthorne said, "Then, when you were at Gao's house, did you ever see this person, for example, did he sit at the same table with someone, or did he approach someone? Can you still recall it?" I shook my head repeatedly and said, "I didn't pay attention at all. I'm not even sure if I saw this person at Gao's house." Hawthorne paused and asked me again, "Then, tell me what kind of clothes this person was wearing." I said, "He was wearing a gray spring tweed coat with a plaid pattern and a dark brown bowler hat on his head." Hawthorne frowned and said, "Didn't you see the clothes inside?" I said, "I saw them. He was wearing a chestnut-colored pair of pants." Hawthorne stopped his gaze again and lowered his head to think. I continued, "His figure is similar to mine, but his shoulders don't seem to be as broad as mine."</p>

<h3 id="e187">Financial and Gold Market Slightly Down Three Taels <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>No Significant Change. Yesterday, the 14th, the gold price continued its downward trend, but there was no special change. The overall market fluctuated by no more than four taels, hovering around 40 taels. Ultimately, it fell by more than three taels. Different firms had varying activity, but the amounts were not large. Overseas silver markets all rose, resulting in a lower opening. Afterward, there was a slight fluctuation of one or two taels. The foreign exchange market was slightly strained, with a premium of half a grade. Around noon, rumors spread that American banks would conduct forward transactions, and with the sellers at the exchange appearing strong, the 740 tael mark was quickly breached. Later in the market, news that the silver price meeting was unlikely to succeed caused the buyers to regain strength, and the price crossed the mark again. However, the overall situation remained soft.</p>
<p>The Morning Market Hovered Stably. The market opened in early June, dropping by four taels and five qian, to 741 taels, as the big bars suddenly rose by 1/16th and American banks, both public and private, had premiums of 1/8th. Soon after, the Dalian gang and Yuan Mao Yong, and others bought in, pushing the price up to 43 taels. Subsequently, hedging trades sold, causing the price to fall to 41 taels and five qian. As for the exchange rate, it was flat. Japanese banks bought June/July sterling at 1/3 and 3/125 to 3/75. Zifeng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Tian Yu Yong, and others bought in again, bringing the price back to 43 taels. As the advance was revealed, sterling was up 1/125, US dollar up 25, and Japanese yen down 1.5 fen. The price was suppressed from 42 taels three or four qian to two taels, then to two taels and a half. The domestic sterling market seemed loose, with Cheng Jin and Hua Bi, and others buying at 3/75. Especially Qian Chang Xiang, Fu Xing Yong Yu Da, Tian Yu Yong, and speculators were heavily selling, causing the price to gradually decline. After 10:45 AM, the 40-tael mark was broken. After 11:00 AM, the price settled at 39 taels and two qian. Not long after, Yuan Heng Heng Xing came in, pushing the price up to 40 taels and six qian. Suddenly, news broke that American banks would begin forward trading, and Tian Yu Yong and others were unloading. After 11:30 AM, the price was 39 taels and five qian. Japanese banks traded spot sterling at 3/75, and the Bank of China traded Citibank this month at $31.125. Subsequently, there were slight buyers, and at 11:45 AM, the price was 40 taels and three qian. By the noon closing, the price returned to 39 taels and seven qian. People were uncertain, and the quoted price was changed to 777 taels, with the call at 35 to over 37 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Showed Hidden Softness. The afternoon market opened at 39 taels and five qian, then nine taels and two qian, as goods had already opened slightly. Afterward, there was a slight fluctuation of one tael. The Indian exchange rate had risen by one or two annas. By 2:30 PM, buyers were more numerous, with Fu Chang, Ju Chang, Long Sheng, Zhi Feng Yong, and others all buying in, causing the price to escape the 40-tael mark. Then rumors spread that American banks were finding it difficult to provide relief and had no solutions. Therefore, sentiment turned from weak to strong. After 2:45 PM, the price soared to 42 taels and seven or eight qian. Yuan Mao Yong and others then sold, and the price retreated by one tael and some change. At 3:30 PM, the price was 41 taels and a half, and then rose by six or seven qian. Around 3:50 PM, the price was suppressed again to 40 taels and four qian. Transactions on the trading floor were quite small, but the state was very flat. It rose slightly by a few qian after 4:00 PM. By the 4:30 PM closing, the price was 41 taels and eight qian, down three taels and seven qian compared to the previous day. It continued to trade slightly lower by five or six qian due to Tian Yu Yong selling. The highest price for the day was 43 taels, and the lowest was 39 taels and two qian, a difference of three taels and eight qian. Goods closed in the morning at one tael and a half, at noon at 39 taels and a half, and in the afternoon at nine taels and two qian. The closing price for calls was 37 taels to 35 taels and zero qian, ledgered at 40 taels, water supplement at 38 taels, afternoon 40 taels.</p>
<p>Transaction Volume Was Thin. Regarding transactions by the firms, Zhi Feng Yong, Tian Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Fu Chang, Yuan Heng, Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yuan Mao Yong, and Heng Xing all bought. Tian Yu Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong bought first and then sold, as did Tong Tai Chang and Heng Yu. Da De Cheng had mixed activity. Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Kang Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Tai, and Yu Da all sold. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Xu Chang, Yuan Heng, and Da Xing Yong all bought. Yuan Kang Xiang, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Da, Tian Yu Yong, and Cui Chang Yong all sold. Goods bars were sometimes bought and sometimes sold. The Dalian gang bought in 1,300 to 1,400 bars, then sold 600 to 700 bars. The Guangdong gang bought a small amount.</p>

<p>Chinese Merchants Dumped and Hedged Bars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian silver markets all reported gains. The British and American exchange rates fell, while the European market strengthened. The Shanghai market also showed a latent weakening trend. HSBC's listed rate had a premium of half a grade, with sterling at 1/125, at one shilling three pence 125, US dollar at 25, at $30.0625, Indian exchange at 75, at 84.5 rupees, French franc at 6 yuan, at 783 yuan, German exchange at 1 yuan, at 128.5 marks, and Japanese half-yen at 50 sen, at 76.25 taels. Singapore currency was down slightly by 1.5 qian, at 183.75 taels. Hong Kong remained unchanged at 78.875 taels. Japanese yen was down 1.5 fen, at 1 tael 6 qian 1 fen 25. As for the domestic market, it also loosened, but the changes were minimal, and the gold market weakened, hovering around 40 taels, ultimately falling by more than three taels.

<p>In the past few days, due to bank releases, the money market rebounded, recalling the rising trend in the middle of last week, with extreme ups and downs, causing quite a bit of attention in the market. After the decline, the situation showed a slight weakness, but the competition between the various long and short positions made it impossible to predict whether there would be huge ups and downs, and yesterday's morning and noon market conditions, the sudden rise and fall, exceeded expectations. The main reason was purely the control of the long and short positions, with no other important key factors revealed. The money market's sudden rise in the morning and fall in the noon (foreign money). The market sentiment in the morning was suddenly high, and the money price greatly increased, and the closing was 7 qian 3 fen, which was 1 li 6 hao 2 hu 5 better than the morning market the day before. The bank selling wind suddenly prevailed in the noon market, and the buyers turned lax, so the money price fell by 1.5 li, to 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 5. In a single transfer, the rise and fall were particularly large, causing great suspicion from the outside world, but in fact, it was purely speculative in nature. (Silver discount) 3 fen in the morning, 2 fen in the noon, and the exchange has always been a zero exchange.</p>
<p>Among the subsidiary currencies, copper coins suddenly shrunk greatly again.

Only the copper coins, after the release in the past few days, rebounded again in the days before yesterday and yesterday, and shrank sharply by 3,000 wen yesterday, to 376,000 wen.</p>

The spot market was very sluggish, and bond prices had rebounded slightly, but the changes were uncertain and the trend was chaotic. On the one hand, there were rumors in the market, and small households tended to sell, while large households remained calm, held optimistic views, and actively bought in. The supply and demand situation had no definite trend. As a result, except for the 20-roll and 96 continued to fall, the others all saw a slight increase, but the amount was small. The total futures trading for the day was over 17.8 million yuan, and spot was only 8,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton. Spun Yarn Knocked Down by Overseas Market.</p>
<p>The yarn market trended weak, impacted by falling overseas cotton markets, and selling pressure remained high. Although a major merchant bought a large quantity of goods, the sellers said that there were also large deliveries. The May term delivery market may be very competitive on both sides, but based on the raw materials and the general trend, it is unlikely to fall significantly. However, most are currently short selling, and the bottom of the coarse yarn is thicker, so the pressure is heavy. Spot yarn sales in the market have improved, and various guilds have an excited appearance. The South China area has been inactive for a long time and is eager to purchase, but it is hindered by the political situation. Therefore, if there are no changes in the current situation, a large number of coarse yarn sales will be discovered. The three-product yarn is expensive and must be combined with a silver price of more than 200 taels, and with the exchange rate firm, there is still great hope for export prospects.</p>
<p>People's Bidding Soft and Falling. The People's Bidding market opened in the morning, and the price fell due to the fall in American cotton, which caused market sentiment to soften. The second bidding rose again, and in the third bidding, a large household dumped, and the market turned soft, falling by three or four qian. In the afternoon, the three-product yarn fell by two yuan, the situation became weak again, and each month fell by seven or eight qian to 1 tael and 4 qian. The big households in this month are still transacting.</p>

<p>The cotton market is tired again. Because the American cotton market has softened, and people's hearts are weak. However, the spot goods in this port are dry. The yarn factories in Hankou are purchasing Indian cotton from Shanghai. Therefore, the Japanese merchants still have a strong pull. However, some people are short selling because the sales are not rising. As for the American cotton, of course, it is seen as low based on the facts. However, it is difficult to fall sharply at the price of the 10-cent mark. The exchange rate is also firm, so the cotton market cannot fall too much. The Han standard fell by three or four qian. The Han standard market opened in the morning. Because the American cotton market fell again, the market sentiment softened. The prices fell by 1.5 fen to 3.5 qian. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was still soft, and the prices fell by 1 qian again. The transaction volume was 48,400 dan.

<p>Grain. Local Street Sales Brisk for Ke Xian Rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market was active, because the local street was very active in handling inventories. Foreign rice was dumped again, and foreign firms sold it. The overall trading volume was high, and the market situation has greatly improved. The Ke Xian rice is unified by the local street. The reason why the local street's inventory is strong is because the supply of rice from the lower reaches of the river is lacking, and the sales are brisk. Therefore, we are paying attention to the Ke Xian rice. The Ke Xian rice has a small stock and lacks supply. Once the local street sells smoothly, the market price should rise. The foreign firms have repeatedly dumped foreign rice in the past few days, and the merchants have no transactions, so although the situation is good, the price has not risen. It is estimated that 1,500 packages of late Jiangxi machine rice were opened, priced at $11.32 to $10.82. 145 packages of Hunan machine rice, priced at $11, 200 packages of Nanjing machine rice, priced at $9.65, and 350 packages of brown rice, priced at $8.25 to $8.22.</p>

<p>The bulls took advantage of the situation to raise prices</p>
<p>Yesterday's noodle market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month, because the price of foreign wheat was small, about 12 cents, and the weather was still clear, so the market for each month was not stable. However, because the mainland gangs were still aggressively entering, the market sentiment turned firm again. When the afternoon market opened, the weather suddenly changed, and there was light rain. The latent market sentiment was unusually excited. The buyers from the mainland gangs did not limit the price and entered smoothly in each market. After the third market, because the rain was heavier, the speculative bulls also took the opportunity to raise the price, causing the buying price to become more and more excited, and the market showed a skyrocketing trend. This month's market is still flat because of the sluggish actual sales and the merchants returning. Otherwise, the increase should be more serious. As a result, this month was up 2 fen 2 li 5 compared to the previous day, June was up 4 fen 2 li 5, July was up 4.5 fen, August was up 4 fen 2 li 5, September was up 4 fen, and October was up 3 fen 7 li 5.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month, because the price of foreign wheat turned small, and the weather was also good as usual, so the market situation for each month was generally stable, with very little fluctuation. When the afternoon market opened, the market atmosphere for each month suddenly changed greatly. Because it suddenly rained when the market opened, the buyers from the mainland gangs suddenly made aggressive entries. The general empty positions were also scrambling to make up for it. Later, it was reported that the flour market was greatly raised, and the buying atmosphere inside and outside the industry became more and more intense, causing each month to show a surge. After observing the subsequent steps, if the sky does not clear up, the increase is afraid that it will not be finished. As a result, this month was up 5 fen compared to the previous day, June was up 6 fen, July was up 9 fen, August was up 1 qian 1 fen, and September and October were up 1 qian.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea. European and American Silk Sales More Clear.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no turnaround in the Shanghai foreign silk market. It was found that the foreign exchange rate was still declining.

Yesterday, Dachan entered 10 packages of Shanghai Bai factory, Boxing and others entered 15 packages of Huang Yaojing, Sanxing and others entered 20 packages of Huang coarse silk, and the price was difficult to increase.</p>

<p>Bad Weather, Most Abandoned ... Only 30% of Those That Mounted</p>
<p>Yiwu County has the earliest silkworm season in various cities and villages. The early silkworms raised by farmers this year were completely abandoned. The late silkworms are still developing unfavorably due to the cold and rainy weather. In addition, in the middle of the big sleep, the big rain lasted for ten days, and the weather was extremely cold. Silkworm diseases broke out, such as diarrhea, yellow, black, red stiff, white stiff, etc., and 70% of them were abandoned. There are not many remaining silkworms, and they are now going to mount and make cocoons. Each cocoon line will be priced on the 18th. Because the current situation is like this, the cocoon production is bound to be limited. Therefore, there will be no more than one or two cocoon lines that will collect the cocoons.</p>

After several rounds of negotiations, the opening price was set at 52 taels, which is 10 taels higher than last year and an unprecedentedly high price.

Although some tea merchants displayed new samples of "Zhen Mei" tea from Huzhou and Sui'an, the prices offered by foreign firms were 10 to 20 taels lower than before. At this crucial time when new tea is entering the market, Chinese tea merchants, considering their costs, are unwilling to excessively lower prices to sell. The green tea market is showing a stalemate.</p>

<h3 id="e198">The Marriage Problem in China <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>"The Marriage Problem" is an extremely important one among the three major problems of life. It has become one that urgently needs to be resolved in every country. However, human affairs are never simple, and the things that are most urgent to resolve often end up being the things that can never be resolved. This has become a common pattern. In any country, specialized books on the marriage problem occupy a major position in bookstores. Moreover, in great and famous literary and artistic works, as well as in films and dramas, the urgency of marriage is always expressed in the important aspects of their content. The reason for this is, of course, very simple. As the author states in the introduction, "From a vertical perspective, due to changes in customs or culture, the marriage system has undergone many transformations. From a horizontal perspective, due to the complex relationships between individual personalities and social environments, it is not easy to achieve satisfactory results in marriage and divorce, and it is often impossible. Therefore, the marriage problem not only occupies a major position among social problems in various countries but also seems to be a problem that can never be solved."</p>
<p>This statement is indeed very appropriate. Especially in Chinese society, we only need to pay attention to the major newspapers and periodicals published daily to know that the problem of unsatisfactory marriage resolutions can be found everywhere. The main reason for this is that in recent decades, after China opened up to the world, new European culture was formally introduced, causing significant changes to the inherent culture. Until the outbreak of the May Fourth Movement, both the old and new systems were caught in contradictions. During this transitional period, various social problems naturally became urgent and demanded resolution. Therefore, the marriage problem became the most urgent problem that needed to be resolved. Thus, "The cry to resolve the marriage problem has risen like an angry tide, spreading across the country. In recent years, after the high tide of the National Revolution swept across the country, new standards have gradually been established. However, the old standards are still striving to exist. Therefore, the urgency of the marriage problem is increasing daily and without end." Since the marriage problem is so important, Chinese scholars, in general, do not pay attention to it. They are even afraid to speak about this issue concerning men and women. Professor Zhang Weici expresses this very clearly, saying,</p>
<p>"Chinese scholars talk about 'nature' and 'reason' all day long. They are very solemn and respectful figures, putting on serious faces, writing their books, spreading their doctrines, and establishing their words. As for the most essential problem of life, the problem of men and women, they do not talk about it. Foreign scholars are not like this. They are willing to talk about anything and any phenomenon, and the words they speak are superior, often able to say what others cannot or dare not say. Regarding problems such as men and women, marriage, and love, they indeed have many profound sayings. Although sometimes their words may be a bit too excessive, they are all spoken from the heart. Their point of view is very special. They can indeed honestly think in their hearts and write in their pens what they think, unlike our Chinese moralists who are full of benevolence and morality in front of people but do anything behind their backs. What they write is completely different from what they think in their hearts." The author of this book, aware of this point, has formed a noteworthy monograph discussing the marriage problem in China. The entire book is divided into eleven chapters, which are analyzed below:</p>
<p>Chapter 1, the Introduction, explains the various reasons for the urgency of the marriage problem, from the improved status of women under the Kuomintang rule, demanding the same equality as men, unwilling to be oppressed by traditional ethics, and even more unwilling to be oppressed by men. However, there is no love in Chinese marriages. In the past, most people simply did not know what "love" was or what marriage was, so there were no problems. In recent years, most young people have realized that loveless marriages are no longer acceptable and cannot be tolerated. As a result, open social interactions between men and women have suddenly begun. Therefore, many conflicting phenomena have arisen in society, with some being forced into "loveless marriages" and others "in love but unable to marry." In this way, the urgency of the marriage problem in China has been brewing. Moreover, Chinese society opposes divorce. Once a couple is married, they are not allowed to separate, regardless of whether the marriage is good or bad. Many of the divorce cases and self-immolation problems that have arisen in recent years have been largely caused by this. Finally, China also has a so-called extended family system, which only cares about the interests of the family and does not pay attention to the happiness of individual marriages, thus hindering the true happiness of individuals and their loved ones. Through this detailed description, the author demonstrates the urgency of the marriage problem in China. As for the content of the marriage problem, it generally includes problems before and after marriage. The problem before marriage is engagement, which includes the conditions of engagement, the issue of parental authority, the legal requirements for engagement and its cancellation, and various engagement ceremonies. The problems after marriage include the wedding ceremony, the maintenance of love and discord between husband and wife, the surname of children, the surname of the husband and wife, as well as divorce, separation, abandonment, remarriage, and so on. Regarding these, those who study social problems need to pay attention, but they should focus on facts rather than relying solely on ideals. Here, the author has systematically collected materials on marriage records, covering the various issues mentioned above, which can also be used as historical reference.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, The Meaning of Marriage and the Conditions of Engagement, describes the general misunderstanding of marriage in China. People do not value marriage. The so-called "major event of marriage" is nothing more than "Marriage is for inheriting the family business and continuing the lineage." This can be said to be a historical flaw in our nation.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Originally, in any country, as long as a "patriarchal family" still exists in its history, the happiness of the children does not need to be questioned. In China, although parents in the past valued the marriages of their children, the practice of first issuing commands and then arranging matches through matchmakers was fundamentally wrong. Here, the author wants to discuss what the true meaning of marriage is. He has conducted detailed research on the way of love and also explains how to get engaged. The union of two sexes should be entirely based on love, and there should be no conditions for engagement. Although this is the theory, there are many conditions in reality. The author analyzes them objectively, which is worthy of our study. How children should cope with their environment and how parents should deal with their children's marriages are also discussed. Chapter 3, The Wedding Ceremony, starts from the so-called "Six Rites" of ancient China to the modern wedding ceremony. It explores a better ceremony to assist those getting married. In the author's opinion, it is advocated to use the "advertisement or written notice method," followed by a "celebratory tea party," which is the most economical and suitable method for modern society.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Maintaining and Destroying Love, provides an explanation for the complex situation between couples. "The secret to maintaining love" is a section worth noting. Secondly, how to deal with a wife without love is discussed. In order to seek lifelong happiness, one should not succumb to the old environment of China. Furthermore, chastity is also one of the important issues in the marriage problem.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Early Marriage and Late Marriage, explains their advantages and disadvantages and provides illustrations of the legal marriage ages in various countries, which is of great significance. Before the complete promulgation of the Chinese Civil Code, there were naturally no regulations on the marriage age. However, the legal marriage ages in previous dynasties are also listed in detail. This kind of comparative study clarifies the "appropriate marriage age."</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Variant Marriages, refers to Chinese marriages, which, in addition to ordinary marriages, also have many variant marriages, such as sons-in-law who move into the bride's family, marriages arranged before birth, child brides, women who become widows before marriage, remarriage, bigamy, dual-household and concurrent inheritance. Concubinage was originally also a variant marriage, but now the law does not recognize concubinage as a form of marriage, so the author has listed it as a separate chapter and does not discuss it in detail here.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, The Issue of Concubinage, is extremely important. At the recent National Conference, there was a proposal on this issue, indicating that the concubinage system is currently an urgent problem that needs to be resolved. The author describes it from a historical perspective in China, commenting on the concubinage system, the issue of descendants, and its remedies. A diagram of the concubine's mourning attire for the head of the family and clan is also provided for reference.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, The Issue of Divorce, has become one of the most common phenomena in modern society. The author starts from the theoretical basis of divorce, using the "Seven Grounds for Divorce and Three Exceptions" as the legal basis for interpretation, and the "Chinese Divorce Law" is based on the draft of the Civil Code. Two attitudes are taken towards divorce: (1) divorce by agreement between husband and wife, and (2) legal restrictions on divorce. These are explained in detail in this chapter.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, Marriage and Law, Chapter 10, Solving the Marriage Problem, and Chapter 11, Afterthoughts, are all value theories of the marriage problem, which can serve as our compass for exploration.</p>
<p>According to the author, this book, although he dares not say that it contains profound insights on the marriage problem, can be said to be written with what he thinks in his heart and what he writes in his pen. Perhaps there are one or two things that others cannot say or dare not say. At least, there are some things that moralists cannot say or dare not say. What is great about this book is this point, and what modern readers with scientific minds need is also this point.</p>
