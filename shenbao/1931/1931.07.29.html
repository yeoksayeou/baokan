<h3>積極造産（二）</h3>
<p>今請進而一述積極造産之意義。</p>
<p>目前我國社會。正在由卸脫農業社會之僵壳。轉入初期工業社會之途程。較之歐美各工業先進國及山本。其相差殆在一世紀以上。我舊社會基礎旣已崩潰。新社會基礎則未建立。手工業製造品旣已將絶跡於我市塲。矣但代之者非本國之機器工業製造品。小農農作旣已日瀕破産矣。但大規模之農業經營。國内亦尚罕見。舊社會之崩潰如摧朽。新社會之建設則如移山。以我地之大。民之衆。而又門戸洞開。關稅輕便。其爲世界商品之尾閭。自爲勢所必然。據海關報告。自十八年至十九年三月。由外國輸入我國之食料。共値二六九·八三八·五○五關平銀。其中以米穀粉糖爲大宗。衣料共値三七一·八七三·九四一關平銀。其中以棉織物棉花毛織物絲織物爲大宗。建築房··</p>
<p>屋材料共値五八·五二二·七六一關平銀。以金屬與木料爲大宗。交通物料·</p>
<p>共値四四·三八二·四四三關平銀。以煤爲大宗。就上述衣食住行四者而言。·</p>
<p>我國對外漏巵。已達七四四。三八二。四四三三關平銀。其他工業物品化學物品裝飾品軍用品等。尚未列入。假使我國人今後居不能土階茅茨。行不能羊腸山徑。食不能簞食瓢飲。衣不能布衫敝裳。則我之衣食住行四者。皆已握在人手矣。平時之利權外溢姑且不說。一旦國際發生事端。人以兵艦封我海口。絶其來源。我國人寗不束手待斃。再觀日本對我之貿易。自一八六八年（同治三年）以至今年。中除一八七零一八九一年以後三年共五年外。無歲不爲出超。其在世界對我輸出之總額中。常爲百分之三十之比例。不過彼對我之轉出。多爲日用必需之消耗品。其他基本工業必需品及工業原料。極爲有限。此種日用必需之消耗品。假如我國人努力。自起製造。則自給自足。尚非難事。如上所述。故我國今日之所急須努力者。亦卽確定我國今後國運者。厥爲集全國之力量。積極造産。假如國内基本工業振興。工業原料開發。歐美封我且將無所措手足。更何有於日本。如其不能。則我國民之生存權。且都操在人手。國家前途之危殆。當更不堪預測。</p>
<p>夫以我國地大物博。農産豐腴。礦物埋藏。隨處皆是。各種工業原料。取之不竭。用之不盡。利此天富。加以人力。以富我國家。以興我民族。蓋我國人今日應負之天職也。有産不造。貨委於地。而日呼貧困。寗非大痴。</p>
<p>造産之道爲何。記者謹提四點曰。集全國人力量。努力於（一）發展國内交通。（二）開闢國内荒地。（三）開發各種工業原料。（四）舉辦各種基本工業。</p>

<p>至於韓民分佈區域之廣。則更爲可驚。吉林全省四十二縣中。無韓人者僅幾縣。而延邊四縣。韓民數目。反較我國人民爲多。近年我國内省。長江黄河兩岸。民苦擁擠。覓食無方。而白山黑水間之廣博原野。則任人侵入。自己不知移殖。此種現象。殆亦爲世界各國所僅有。茲錄左表。以示其在吉林一省分佈地域之普遍。</p>

<h3>中國教育的一箇新方面</h3>
<p>—中央政治學校（三）野星</p>
<p>以及洗衣剃頭等費、都是由學校供給的、除非有特别事情、經過了隊長核准以後、不能請假外出、而該校求知的空氣、也異常濃厚、課堂中旣無缺課、更没有不守紀律的現象發生、而且在圖</p>
<p>書館及自修室裏面、埋頭用功的座爲之滿、學生對於師長、無論在校内或校外、遇見的時候、總是恭而敬之的把右手向帽沿一貼、舉行敬禮、如教員入教室的時候、都有學生呌立正的口令、全體肅然起立、因此新來的教育、特别是在旁的大學教過的往往在跨入教室的當兒、大吃一驚、而參觀者均謂該校有尊重師道之風、對於學生所考試是極其嚴格的　如果在試塲中發見了作弊或夾帶等事體、立刻要被開除不稍姑貸、且大考結果、學生有幾項以下的功課不及格、也立刻開除、所以現在的三年級學生、入學的時候、有四百十三人之多三年以後、只剩了二百七十餘人了、由這些地方、也可看出他嚴格的程度了該校校址、在開辦的時候、借東南大學舊址一部份、以後遷入紅紙廊前江蘇法政大學的舊址於每年經常費用下節省下來一些錢、添蓋了四五座新式的建築、但是還是不夠用的、該校另有規劃、擬另覓校址、以現有的校址、另辦附設高級中學或專門班、但是現在還是在籌備的期内、該校經常費用、是極省的以將近五百人數的學生八十多位教授及講師、再加上軍事訓練部、編譯部圖書館等處的職員、每月的開支、不過二萬七千餘元、所以南開大學校長張伯苓先生說這個學校、比私立的大學還要節省、但是對於購買圖書儀器一項、却是毫不吝惜的、如今年實行分組的時、特别提出兩萬元購買圖書儀器、至於每年圖書儀器的購買費用、佔常年經費百分之十五、也要費到三萬元以上、所以圖書館的書籍雖然和各科俱備之圖書館比較起來、不能算多、但就專科圖書館而論、乃是一個較有規模的、美國哈佛大學教授Ｈolcomb先生游華以後、著了一本書、呌Ｔhe　Chinese　Ｒevolution說該圖書館爲優等政治科學圖書館爲（Ｅxcellent　Lbrary　lf　Political　Science）其批評是很適當的、</p>
<p>因爲該校要造就有實際專門知識和技能的人材、所以玾論與實施並重、因其地處首都、實習之機會較多、卽就統一科而論、如中央黨部、南京市政府、和其他各部會要辦统計的時候、皆招該校學生去帮忙、他們因此可以得到不少的練習機會、又如農村行政組的實習、則該校除另設農場外、並於暑假期丙、分派學生、到各農場去實翌、該校四年之中、還特别規定一學期、就是四年級的第一學期、爲實習期間、由國民政府分派各學生到各縣市去實習、以俾畢業以後派遣工作時、有相當的實騐經騐之準備、不至於臨時張皇、手忙脚亂、實習一學期以後、還要調回到學校來、再肄業一學期、並將實習時所感受的困難問題、提出討論、並寫成論文、經審核以後、方准畢業、這也是該校教育實施的特殊一點、該校因爲經費不多、而且用費極爲節省、所以對於將來發展極持沈着持重的態度、先後充實内部的課程和設備等着手、再謀相等大規模擴充、一俟校址有辦法以後、如統計會計等專門班、卽不難實現、下半年招生名額略有增加、定爲三百名、並增設教育系、同時添辦教育行政及鄉村教育兩組、參考書方面、正在積極增加、教授亦繼續添聘、長此下去、五年以後、必定有相當的規模、這個學校、不但爲造就實際政治人材的重要教育機關、而且是貧苦有志靑年的最好出路、無怪惹起全國的注意了、（完）</p>

<h3>各輪局昨接長江水災警報</h3>
<p>▲各埠棧房淹没</p>
<p>▲輪局日夜搶堵</p>
<p>▲皖中貨運阻滯</p>
<p>▲貨棧浸入水中　昨日本埠長江各輪公司均接到漢口加急電告謂漢口連日大雨不止、江内水尺突漲、今日已漫浸到岸、距最高之貨棧、亦不到兩尺、而較低之貨棧、已經浸水、棧内客貨、均淹没水内、損失之巨、爲向所少見、現在水勢猶在繼續暗漲、各棧房已經雇用大批工人、開始實行移貨、與槍防工作、</p>
<p>▲催促客家提貨　該電到滬、又續得急電、謂長江水尺已達四十九尺、五寸、爲揚子江水高之空前的新紀錄、自第一碼頭起、全部浸入水中、各輪公司日夜督工、移駁貨件、惟存貨山積、一時無此存儲之棧、設再遷延、則水漬益多、移取益艱、損失益巨、請卽日會同上海長江各輪公司、聯合通告存貨客家、限期將漢棧存貨、從連提取、遲則輪局不負責任、</p>
<p>▲水漬客家自任　昨日各輪局得此警告後、一面通知客帮、一面又發電知照鎭江·南京·蕪湖·大通·安慶·武穴·九江·以及長江上游各埠之分局及各貨棧主任、着令轉知存棧貨　之客家、現在長江各埠、已發生大水災、各地貨棧、多半没入水中、此係天災、非人力所可抵抗、如貨物有水漬損壞等項、則各公司均不負責、關於搬運等項、其駁運費、則由貨主自理、</p>
<p>▲長江貨運受阻　　今次水災、皖南皖北亦甚巨大、各圩田畝悉皆淹没、近日蕪湖·大通·安慶·等埠之進出口貨、·</p>
<p>已經受大水之阻礙、各客家以貨物分裝往皖省、内地之交通已阻礙、故相率停止辦運、近日六公司各江輪之上下水貨、在蕪湖安慶上下者、已大爲減少矣、</p>
<h3>全滬小輪均停</h3>
<p>▲蘇境大水浙東亢旱</p>
<p>蘇省大水爲災、内河交通全斷、農田大多淹没、乃相距數百里之寗波、則亢旱異常、已經一月餘、未曾下雨、將成旱荒、茲將昨日所得消息、分記如下、</p>
<p>▲蘇杭小輪亦停　七日六日至今、大雨連綿不止、蘇省内河小輪三十餘路、已完全停開、上海方面僅留申蘇申杭兩班、尚得勉强行走、乃自二十五日起、續降大雨以後、内地水勢更大、滬上招商源通等申蘇班輪、向行外河、尚可通航、乃邇日在蘇州方面、河水已没入岸上、有一尺餘水、航路變成一片汪洋、各輪局昨日起、已將蘇班停開、又杭州班輪、始則重偁尚可通行、今水勢已與橋洞漫平、雖小民船亦不能走、故亦止航矣、</p>
<p>▲申角班輪半休　全滬内河小輪、至今只留一申角班船、勉强行駛、詎昨日招商局得報、朱家角水勢猶不十分十、而、</p>
<p>靑浦則河道已與田畝漫浸、一片汪洋、亦不能分水線與陸地矣、依局中主張、將申角輪停航、第因該地商民之請求、勿使交通阻斷、昨日局中已訓令申角班輪船主、在船到靑浦時、不許司機開車、祇可順水氽進、免得激毁岸堤、故此路雖行、亦等半休航狀態　、</p>
<p>▲浙東勢成亢旱　昨有友得寗波家報謂、甬地自入夏以來、滴雨不下、已將匝月、地方上將成旱燎之災、鎭海奉化等處亦月餘無雨、河道乾涸、人民汲水飲料、幾致無從覓取、鎭海方面早稻已屆成熟、行將收刈、受此亢旱、枯死者已屬不少、而晚稻更當下種播植之際、受此旱燎、則多半萎斃、苟再一星期不雨、則晚稻將無希望、地方殊慮成爲旱災云、</p>

<h3>葉增壽案綁匪審訊紀</h3>
<p>▲葉本人不願到庭</p>
<p>▲徐陳二人候再訊</p>
<p>中孚進出口洋行主葉增壽、於本月四日上午、偕其第三妾范氏、乘自備四五二九號汽車、由楊樹浦榆林路往北四川路醫治目疾、中途葉突遭綁票匪擄去、旬日之後、方得脫險生返、茲經公共租界匯司捕房緝獲該案綁匪兩名、及嫌疑犯一人、爰將葉被架後以至破獲綁匪法院審問各情、記述如次、</p>
<p>▲被綁情形　葉於七月四日晨十時、偕第三妾乘四五二九號汽車、自寓處出發、囑車夫駛往北四川路某眼科醫生診所治療、詎車循榆林路前進之一轉角處時、車之速度、忽然變緩、當有綁匪三名、自道旁一躍登車、一匪執手槍、卽與葉並坐、兩匪則與車夫並坐、葉等均不敢聲張、而車隨亦停頓、旋經坐於車頭之匪、撥動機括、車乃疾馳而去、不知所終、</p>
<p>▲巡捕目擊　當時榆林路十八號廣德當舖一千五百六十三號司　捕李英寳、目擊綁匪之動作、祇以被綁者與其車夫均無求援表示、及抵抗行爲、故不疑係綁票、事後據該司　言、彼於其時設知爲綁匪、不難舉槍擊之、葉必不致被架云云、</p>
<p>▲藏票所在　是日匪旣得手、將車駛至江灣翔毁路、乃棄葉妾等挾葉而入該處第二十六號門牌之平房内禁閉、派三匪輪流監視、跬步不離、一面致函葉家、索一萬元取贖、直至十三日、匪得　欵、始將葉釋放、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>英國監獄中的讀物與娛樂</p>
<p>在一般人的意想中。總以爲監獄中的罪犯。要是不喜讀書則已。倘若喜歡讀書時。那一定愛讀偵探一類的小說。因爲偵探小說中叙述好宄宵小。多少能給他們一些犯罪的訣門。於他們將來出獄後很有用處的。然而據英倫全國的獄官們的報告。罪犯們所最歡迎的讀物。知是沙士比亞與蕭伯納Ｂerdard　Shaw的劇本。不知是茂麽意思。他們的愛讀劇本。尤過於小說。并且這兩位大家的作品。又是古奥艱深。而不很容易了解的。除此以外。還有那演述美國大總統林肯氏生平故實的著名劇本「阿」白拉罕林肯」。“Ａbraham　Lincoln”也時時發見於獄室中。足見罪犯們良知未泯。也很崇拜世界偉大的人物。關於娛樂一門。那麽梅特斯冬Ｍaidstone監獄中裝有無線電。可聽音樂歌唱。并有關於倫理與科學等等的種種演說。培特福Ｂediord監獄中。設有跳舞班。每星期教授一次。而白明罕Ｂirrningbam的監獄中。更有體育塲的設備。一切體育器械。應有盡有。這是罪犯們所最最滿意的。</p>
<h3>頑童惡作劇</h3>
<p>— 翼</p>
<p>近數月來。迭聞有銀杏自焚之異。好事者故神其說。播爲種種怪誕不經之談。迷信者從而和之。往往轟傳遠近。以余所聞。崑山蓬　鎭大通橋一古廟前之銀杏自焚。尤爲一般人所重視。雖隔數月。傳說未衰。本刋亦嘗有此類事之記載。惟已不憶是否記崑山所發生者矣。當該樹自焚之時。附近人家均往施救。但無效。並聞有人呼廟神登仙。銀杏出烟。不知出自何人之口。羣益疑悚。驚以爲神。遂自焚三日三夜。成一焦木。復不知有何人散佈蜚言。謂銀杏樹果已成神。不論何種絶症。禱之可立愈。迷信之徒信之。咸往拜禱。又有人謂。樹根及其地草木。均是仙丹。可取歸庋藏。治病奇效。於是不數日間。被人取之一空。本爲臭腐。化作神奇。未幾竟喧傳至百里外。鄰縣人亦趕至其地。車塵轂迹。絡繹於途。官廳並不取締。一任其妖言惑衆。且收取香資。重新廟貌。至今四方人士。仍紛紛至其地。朔望尤衆。初不限於無知村氓。知識階級亦受其惑。香資願金最旺時。每月可收四五百金。此空無人跡之古廟。迨不久卽可改爲壯嚴巨刹也。實則該樹自焚之原因。乃爲某頑童惡作劇。緣該樹年代已久。樹幹中空。根處且有一穴。自焚以前。頑童戲於樹下。以稻草塞穴中。引火燃之。遂有此結果。「廟神登仙·銀杏出烟」二語。亦頑童所呼也。矧銀杏樹本易觸電自焚。故往往有遭雷殛之事。卽非頑童惡作劇。亦不足怪。今該處迷信之談。深入人心。雖原因已白。竟反不信。堅謂有神如故。斯可慨已。</p>
<h3>滬濱艷囮</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>斧頭黨者。三合會靑紅帮之别支也。海上虹口等處。常發生暗殺械鬥等事。以斧頭爲凶器。吾人時有所聞。恬不爲怪。近來海上發現艷囮之案。其性質酷類昔日之「仙人跳」「活絡門閂」之類、然其手段爲尤辣。往往利用法律。以爲勒詐之護符。墮其術中者。莫不俯首就範。縱有百喙。莫能自辯。唯有踴躍輸將。滿其慾壑。自嗟落於陷穽而已。人因名之曰「女斧頭黨」。老友Ｗ君。素有聲於商界。持籌握算之餘。偶作問花尋柳之事。初非登徒子之流也。一日。觀電影於某大影戲院。華燈旣滅。有麗姝姗姗來。並Ｗ君之座息焉。鶯聲嚦嚦。時逗Ｗ君而言笑。人孰無情。誰能遣此。言談旣頻。互通身世。眉目傳情。色授魂與。劇終。相偕飲於酒家。女自言吳人。芳齡十八。兄在某銀行司出納之責。現隨母僑寓滬西某里。綠蔭深處。互樓一角。便是妾家。高軒過時。幸蒞止也。Ｗ君樂甚。自謂藍橋驛上。得遇雲英。桃源匪遙。漁郎可問津矣。自是往來頻繁。遂論嫁娶。Ｗ君僞謂使君無婦。願訂白首之約。定情之夕。女兄與母。亦參與其間。初無違言也。未二月。女忽延律師控Ｗ君重婚罪於法院。兄又以强姦未滿二十歲女子罪相恫嚇。女則判若兩人。不但蕭郎陌路。且視若深讐巨恨也者。Ｗ君初猶夢然。以爲恨海難塡。愛河浪惡。墮歡容可拾也。後恫嚇日甚一日。顯然無情感之可言。而又礙於自己之名譽與地位。不得已。卒由魯連者出而調停。以五千金爲壽。其事始寢。後有知其事者嘆曰。此「女斧頭黨」之伎倆也。其組織頗完美。海上黨員已達千人以上。蓋較諸開韓莊伎院。獲利倍蓰也。其目的全注於海上聞人。達官富商。以其顔面關係。易於敲詐耳。</p>
<h3>日本在華之火柴事業</h3>
<p>— 晚成</p>
<p>日本經濟侵略。卽以火柴一項而讑。已足驚人。浦東日本燧生火柴廠。全部都用機器製造、工人祇四百餘。大中華火柴公司榮昌廠有工人千三四百人。據火柴業中人云。兩火柴廠出品。不相上下。又市上有「民光公司」出品之火柴。盒　印有瑞典製造。實日商燧生廠出品。亦中日經濟絶交中。我人應有之認識也。希同胞注意及之。</p>
<h3>集錦扇話</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>海上畫展會。可算得最盛時代。當茲炎暑蒸人。扇面畫展會。又可乘時而起。湖州沈君有壬擅書簪花小楷。粒粟能書七唐一首。見者嘆爲絶技。沈與藝苑中人極有交誼。近發起集錦畫扇會於新世界三樓。一時名畫家如汪仲山熊松泉張恢盦姚鴻釗孔小瑜葉渭莘高尚之王韻笙徐曉村殷梓湘等咸在羅致之列。扇面均係自出心裁。向扇作定製。絶似磁器中之開礦式。金底寫字。白底畫極精細之山水人物花卉走獸。靡不工緻絶倫。嘆爲罕見。入其室頓覺四壁琳琅。目不暇給。余最愛其最精之扇面。如李芳園所繪之墨梅。中間闢書卷式白底。由張恢盦徐曉村等畫工細之山水。尺幅千里。筆有餘妍。孔小瑜之花卉博古。古色古香。更見精妙。王韵笙之走獸。神彩奕奕。躍然如生。梅花枝幹間。更由沈君自書小楷梅花詩百絶。筆姿嫵媚。宛如十七八女郎。令人愛不釋手。允推雙絶焉。</p>
<h3>詁林精舍記</h3>
<p>— 裘可桴</p>
<p>古國必讀古書。古書皆古言。與今言異。故必深於舌人之學。乃能以今言譯古言。顧或誤譯已久。歷二千年不之省。淸儒起。一文一字一音一義之疑。必博考羣譯。求古言眞相。旣得。不遽信。又必旁求他證。必衆證皆同。不一異。而後信其眞。故一義旣明。萬喙皆息。起舌人於九原。亦必自嘆不如也。蓋淸儒精研文字如此。吾友人君仲祜。夙嗜此學。多所發明。近又析取說文解字大小徐本。及淸儒治文字學成專書。或散見他書者。按字排比。爲詁林一書。冀以减稽古之日力。惠來學於無窮。書旣成。名其所居曰詁林精舍。屬余爲之記。精舍藏書十五萬卷。爲仲祜著書處。遇星一。輒舉行茶會於其中。迄今十年。精舍已屢易其地。而茶會如故。及期。日將夕。客皆至。風雨寒署無間。然惟吳君稚暉。時爲主人商定體例。頗有助於詁林云。</p>
<p>更正　本欄二十三日載「記江隂花園飯店所見」一文。内第十五行龍字下。脫一「屠」字。又二十六日所載「日人在滬求知商情之可驚」一文。内第一個「我」字係「日字之誤」。</p>
<h3>美國婦女生活雜談（三）</h3>
<p>— 寄</p>
<p>▲婚姻　美國女子。對於求婚的條件。並不過分。譬如中學畢業的。伊也願意嫁中學生。大學畢業的。也願意嫁大學生。並没有越級的要求。這一點比我國女子遷就了。伊們所認爲重要的條件。是强壯的體格。純潔的品性。服務的精神。對方的財産。也並不希罕。伊們以爲有財産的人。常有怠惰·傲慢·奢浮·的習氣。只享樂而不能耐苦的。况且伊們自己也有職業。經濟可以獨立。無須依賴丈夫的供給。這種超然的見解。很值得欽敬。擇婚完全自由。先由友誼而經過長時期的互相審愼考慮。旣經深切的瞭解。得家長的許可才訂婚。也有一般情侣。事先並不露佈。到訂婚的那天。邀集親友。在茶會或宴會席上。纔推出一個人來宣佈雙方訂婚的經過。美國以前的結婚年齡。男子在二十五至三十五。女子二十三至二十八之間。現在都提早了。但早婚的絶少。因爲大學没有畢業。經濟不能獨立。不到法定二十以上的年齡。是絶對不能結婚的。他們結婚的禮節。大都很簡單。教徒行教會儀式。請牧師證婚。非教徒請社會上有聲望的人或是地方長官證婚。在結婚之前。最要緊的卽是向政府請領結婚證書。如是當局不准而不給證書。在法律上就不能成立。也不得法律上的保護。近幾年來美國離婚的案件。其數實在可驚。全國四十八州之中。法律各有不同。某一州因宗教關係。法律上絶對不准離婚。而拿佛大州Ｎavada的雷諾市。Ｒeno則絶對可以離婚。有人說雷諾市政府每年捐稅收入很微。不足開支。藉此可以增加不少的收入。這彷彿是吸收經濟的一種策略。因此美國人離婚。發現兩種很可怪的現象。譬如夫婦某一方面不願履行法院判决的條件。而生阻碍時。就有兩條路可走。有錢的人。借游歷的名義。到法國去實行離婚。（因爲法國手續簡便）各遂其願。經濟不充裕的人。爲節省用費。就到雷諾去離婚。據說很冷落的雷諾市。爲了各州離婚的人到得很多。市場商業變熱閙了。市政府的收入。也出乎意外的增加了。至於獨身的人也不算少。男子有的因失業受經濟壓迫而獨身。而有幾位擁資千萬的女子也獨身。不過女子經濟能獨立生計不感困難的究竟少數。所謂獨身。還只是極少數而已。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>女人女人（三）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>這陸先生的登門造謁，似乎早在丁小姐的意料之中了。因爲當秋子給他們送茶的時候，就聽得丁小姐這們的說：「怎麽到今天纔求？」</p>
<p>秋子自從到了丁家來，還是第一次瞧見丁小姐會見伊自己的朋友。在好奇的情緒中，已經忘了自己是不應該再停留在這會客室裏的。直到丁小姐不得已地吩咐伊說：「你出去！也許有旁的人來，或者是電話，都給我回絶了吧！」</p>
<p>秋子笑着答應，就緩緩地退了出去，在順手關上門的時候，却偷偷地瞧見丁小姐已經坐了下來，和那個陸先生並坐在一隻雙人沙發裏。</p>
<p>在會客室中的　，祇是靜穆的空氣。丁小姐好像無話可說的樣子，陸先生也祇有隨便地談談，從連朝的大雨談到了游興的闌珊，丁小姐便說：「等天晴了，我很想到外埠去暢游一番。」</p>
<p>「你放了假，没有出去玩過麽？」陸先生問。</p>
<p>「從没有出去玩過，雖然李文耀寫了幾次的信來，我總没有理會過，昨天他還打了個電話來約我去打小哥爾夫球，我也托辭生病回絶了他。」丁小姐似乎很誠懇地說。</p>
<p>「李文耀這個人眞可憐，他總不知道自己的無聊：他失戀的歷史，在學校裏大家都知道了，他自忹也隱隱約約地在校刋上發表過一篇小說，不過，人家都笑他别有作用，還說他的小說是變相的徵婚廣告哩！」</p>
<p>「我倒不管他這些事！不過，跟一個意趣不同的人在一起玩，總覺得没有興趣的。所以，我很歡迎你的光臨啊。」丁小姐說話的時候，伊的眼睛直視在陸先生的臉上。</p>
<p>陸先生忽然起立，緩緩地走了過去，却又急急地走了回來。用極輕柔的語音向丁小姐說：「你對於我的恩意，我眞不知道把什麽東西來報答你。」</p>
<p>丁小姐微微地笑了。但是没有一句話說。這在陸先生的跳躍的心弦上，顯然是急奏着進行曲的時機了。</p>
<p>「我已經預備下一樣可紀念的東西，也許你能夠接受我的。祇是……也許你能夠拒絶我的！我想，到明天，我有一個最好的幸運·」陸先生很宛轉地說。</p>
<p>但是丁小姐還祇有微微地笑。在陸先生自然已經覺得是很有成功的希望了。這時，夜色已經深深地籠着大地，陸先生便告辭而去。丁小姐這時纔開口說了一句話：「明天，我等着你來啊！」</p>

<h3>大條回縮二五二十八日倫敦電訊、大條銀收盤縮去四分之一、計十二便士九三七五、</h3>
<h3>外匯華商大虧耗</h3>
<p>▲責價扒進……賤價抛出</p>
<p>昨英美印銀市、均已報升、惟市平、殆匯豐各匯均已掛長半擋、計英金一二五、爲一先令二辦士八七五、美金二五、計三十元○一二五、日金减一分二五、計一兩六錢四分二五、其餘均亦放長、至内盤趨勢亦鬆、金市復跌、打破五十兩矣、然各匯並無過於變化、迨收盤比前天、計英金長一二五、美金升二五、日金减一分半、而金業中有所抛出、乃套頭也、銀行方面買胃尚濃、其情形與隔外適得其反、但華商頗爲吃虧、乃貴價結進、廉價而出、計英金約成交廿萬磅、間有外商寫蒙略爲賣出、又美金少數脫售、而日金亦僅數十萬元、係大連帮售與日商焉、</p>
<p>▲英匯　内盤僅計零六二五上落、早市出價一先令三便士一二五、買價一八七五、上海出八月一二五、浙江三井進八九月一二五至一八七五、住友華比對做一二五、華比進八九月一二五至一八七五、麥行進價同、（寫蒙出）上海安達大英進十一月一八七五、正金三井同價進九月、正金又進一八七五、午收與早市同、下午上海進八九月、匯豐進九十月、同爲一二五至一八七五、麥行出九月一二五、華義與華比互做八月一二五、收市際聞某行吸一二五、結果仍與早午同、　　▲美匯　内盤計一二五千縮、上午出價三十元六八七五、買價三十元一二五、美豐買九月三十元六二五、午收出價三十元六二五、買價三十元七五、午午平定、</p>

<h3>銀根逐見緊張</h3>
<p>▲市場概况　金融業氣象自春末夏初以迄於今、銀根及洋釐疏滯無聊、爲時頗久、尤以銀根之無聲無息爲特甚、此次因受日貨影響、及外國貨之解欵關係、頭襯日見短促、形勢逐步加緊、據一般人之推測、過此月底、恐有緊急之市面發生耳、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢二分五厘三毫七忽半、午市爲七錢二分五釐半、結果較前日午市儘小二毫半、形勢大都安謐、（銀拆）早市八分、午市一錢、局面明鬆暗緊、故劃頭加水依然有一錢三四分市面、而各方頭襯殊感拮据、幸拆票則爲獨天、大致無大變化也、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情　江南小洋、早午兩市同爲六錢五分、較前日午市略好二毫半、做出交易、早市六千角、午市三千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢四分三釐、午市爲六錢四分三釐一毫二忽半、做出交易、早市十二萬五千角、午市七萬角、銅元又改長二千文、爲三百八十千文、交易二萬九千餘串、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出　（銀欵）昨日銀行收解、無甚繁簡可言、祇略有押欵交易、計華商收解票欵二百四五十萬、外商一百七八十萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解一千○數十萬、押欵交易一面四五十萬、特欵收解一百餘萬、進倉一百十萬、日商銀行收解各欵四百三十餘萬、出倉三十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千七百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百三十餘萬、各路匯欵收解九十餘萬、解現數十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵、早市做出一百二十七萬八千、鈔票祗場外做出十五萬、午市洪劃票欵九十一萬五千、鈔票二萬、場外做出十萬○五千、銀行交易、早市互市六十五萬、午市五十五萬、各銀行洋戸往來收解一百五十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出一百八九十萬、錢莊洋公單收解五百六十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百九十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百六十餘萬、小錢莊交易七八十萬、客路來去胃依然無聞</p>
<h3>證劵　今日證交停市</h3>
<p>▲辦理七月期貨交割結算</p>
<p>▲昨僅開八月期價續趨疲</p>
<p>昨日本埠證劵市塲各價劵市况、除現貨交易稀少外、期市以七月期已停拍準備交割、而九月期猶未開市、八月期一種交易、因迫近交割、大戸觀望、市况淸閒、債市環象、亦非常沉悶、市塲人心虛弱、買氣頗淸、價亦無大漲落、結果以較前日、則仍一致下跌、如二○關捲八月各跌一元餘、裁兵二九關亦小八九角、統稅則有某方售出、續跌二元二角、又今日證交因辦理七月期貨交割結算、明日辦理交割、市塲均停止交易、計昨日期貨成交僅六百七十萬、内廿年統稅佔八十七萬、爲開拍來所僅有、又現貨交易共二萬八千元、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市壓力重重</h3>
<p>紗市略疲、趨勢益覺軟弱、蓋以海外花紗狀况一味傾向下游、銀價放長、金市趨落、致人心愈疲、且大戸壓力尤重、市面愈難提起、但現紗銷路尚稱不惡、北方辦意尚健、粤帮進量亦暢、惟大衆散戸、視拒貨運動依然緊張、做多心思未絶、榮興號亦購進、前途情形、仍難預卜也、</p>

<h3>棉市大虛</h3>
<p>▲天氣放晴……抛戸紛起</p>
<p>▲金價轉跌……市面動搖</p>
<p>美棉杳無起色、本埠天氣放晴、致人心鬆懈、買戸較少、市面大爲搖動、跌勢頗熾、且本帮多傾向抛出、故一遇不良狀况、反動愈烈、但漢帮稍有購進、不過據各方報告、棉田損害不少、然海外棉市不良、銀價放長、金價虛弱、空方膽氣更壯矣、</p>
<p>▲漢標跌落六錢　交易所漢標前市開盤、以天氣轉晴、而外棉平平、各月均跌三四錢、午後又跌二錢半、成交計七萬五千一百擔、查賣出泰興二千八百擔、吉豐三千一百擔、恒德三千五百擔、新亨四千六百擔、買進大孚二千八百擔、廣豐四千三百擔、愼昌四千五百擔榮興二千八百擔、長豐二千一百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市漲風已定</h3>
<p>▲新閘　昨日天時放晴、西路各帮來源三十號左右、形勢一蹶不振、常錫厚粳早晨喊緊、及至午前轉淡、價回落五角之鉅、但交易極呆、薄稻因連日猛漲、後路來貨必湧、大盤未見向上、蘆洋尖到則不夥、胃亦懈淡、糯米銷塲極殷、情况穩定、壩埠尖無貨應市、</p>
<p>▲南市　各路來船不多、城鄉店銷愈覺淸淡蘇帮白粳高緊次定、平望黎里北㘮等貨胃口寥寥、價無上落、薄稻祗有市頂二筒、大市乏貨、餘如松江航船貨而已、本街去路不斷、致價喊緊、蘆洋尖貨稀胃俏、故與原盤相彷、變隂元胃納尚可、趨勢步硬、洋米客帮採辦、惟長江一帶稍取、餘埠及本街見天宫晴正、交易轉滯、市價盤旋之態、</p>
<h3>粉市續見挫折</h3>
<p>▲遠期尤甚</p>
<p>昨日粉市已呈不振之象、因天已晴正、各處可望水退、外行之惶恐狀態　、已稍和緩、廠家方面、近期仍然堅持、遠期則續有套出、一般人鑒於洋麥之能續定、未免爲前途極大之障碍、因之市氣見挫、實銷遠期不動、近期略有收進、結果本月份較前日跌一分、八月份跌二分、九·十月份跌一分七釐半、十一月份跌一分半、十二月份跌一分云、</p>
<h3>麥價復昂</h3>
<p>▲長江客戸爭講不已</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面呈初平繼漲之態、初以洋麥報價互有一二角上落、天時亦復暢晴、人心自然見寂、惟以後長江一帶之客戸、因水患甚重、糧價日俏、所以依然爭購不已、致近遠各期復又奇昂、結果八月份較前日漲五分、九月份漲六分、十月至十二月份各漲五分、現麥因標準及米價關係、高貨又喊好一二分、開丹陽·東台·蓬萊·大倉·雙鳳·寳山·無錫·鎭江麥計三千餘包、由福新華　信大辦去云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　綠茶交易異常旺盛</h3>
<p>▲抽芯珍眉頂盤開二百七八十兩</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、路莊土莊平水等路之綠茶、交易異常旺盛、其中針眉秀眉等項、市盤激漲四五兩、抽芯珍眉頂盤已有開出二百七十兩、同孚錦隆等行、對於屯溪歙縣遂安等路普通珍眉、進意亦較前活動、惟售價均低、玉山温州等路低莊貨、均已銷售無幾、華茶商鑒於本年各路收成减折、態度轉趨堅硬云、</p>
<h3>里昂日絲競銷仍力</h3>
<p>里昂市塲、入夏以來、絲銷步趨閒散、各絲織廠雖在暑假停工期中、而日絲競銷仍力、開價益疲、華絲備受影響、Ａ級日絲每基羅祗開一百六十三法朗、Ｂ級一百零二十五法郎·Ｃ級九十二法郎、又各跌四五法郎云、</p>
<h3>歐美絲銷寂寞無神</h3>
<p>海外各綢廠因暑假停工、黄白廠經無人問訊、絲電不轉、昨祇中和等進白乾經二十包、克昌進黄粗絲十五包、價均堅挺云、</p>
<h3>糖市　抛貨荷赤成交三百噸</h3>
<p>▲冰花靑開盤俏秀</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價俱無起伏、紐約期糖三月份不動、五月份跌二分、餘月亦各跌一分、爪哇現期糖仍乏升降、公會劃盤買氣仍靜、荷糖二十四號粗砂白價仍十一兩五錢、香港貨十一兩四錢、二十號中砂白十兩○九錢半、交易寥落、市形均平、太古車糖現貨Ｂ嘜劃十二兩、陳貨ＣＷ嘜十一兩八錢、趨勢亦萎、抛貨有華新號售開九月份裝船八號荷赤二百噸、價荷幣四元九角七分半、行方進意活躍、本廠氷花靑去化尚暢、故續有開出、價爲十兩○二錢半、原來貨索價十兩○四錢、市形俏秀云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蜜棗已告斷擋</h3>
<p>蜜棗因前年業此者大受虧耗、故去年出品滅少、致今庚供不應求、市價步升、當存底軋缺時、秃秃曾售至三十七八兩、至最後竟達四十二兩、實爲希有之高價、又如興化來之小蜜棗、先前不過十一二兩、今庚亦售三十兩　現在已告斷檔、專待新貸登塲矣</p>
<h3>五金　全市大勢轉穩</h3>
<p>五金交易、因連日苦雨、異常冷落、昨日天氣轉晴、市塲買賣頓形熱閙、而市况亦見隱固、英美貨馬口鐵均有交易、開出一千一百餘箱、行情九十磅英貨提高五分、售十四兩五錢半、英鋼板七厘半花色天津靑島二帮均有爭辦、價六兩六錢、二六尺十八張黑鐵皮兵工廠昨辦去七八百担、價十一兩五錢、十六號至二十號新鉛絲昨銷去四五百担、係四川帮進胃最强、價十三兩五錢、竹節鋼條昨市已不者先前之冷落、價估九十一兩五錢、比前雖跌去一兩半、然成交却比前爲多、購戸統爲建築帮、而出口生意、因各地均患水災、無甚希望、白鉛皮近來五號稍見活潑、價估二十五兩、三角鐵·新洋元近市仍見平和、點錫·靑鉛昨祗有少許買賣、但來源不多、市仍平定、純銻因湘省仍無來貨、市况見佳、但行情一節、因漢口帮紛紛抛出遠期貨所以尚無提加之望云、</p>
<h3>雜訊　洋紙二千件歐洲裝來、</h3>

<p>靑年園地</p>
<h3>火山之旁</h3>
<p>— 霎卿</p>
<p>大約在一月以前、我還被窮愁和病魔圍困在異國的一座火山之旁、那火山經過了幾次劇烈的活動、我也幾乎葬在火山之下了、據地質學家與火山博士的測量、那火山正是在爆發期間、因爲那是一座睡眠的火山、如人們晚上睡了覺、早上一定要醒來的一樣、牠已睡得很久了、</p>
<p>睡了四十五年、當四十五年以前、牠醒着的時候、聽說幾萬生命、完全被牠吞噬了、現在還留下了一些殘痕在海濱的山麓、那海水冲毁的巨大的海船、機輪汽鍋·汽匱·烟筒……都零亂的散在山麓、並且生滿了紅銹綠微黴、無論什麽人、見了那種傷心慘目的造跡、恐后也不敢回想當時的情景吧、</p>
<p>在火山之旁的一個學校、好像是一個不幸的死境、因爲我到那裏不久的時候、就被病魔纒着了、身體漸漸地消瘦得像隂魂一樣、可是爲了生活的壓迫、爲了醫藥的費用、又不得不支着微弱的病軀、跑到課堂裏去拚命的掙扎、等整天的功課完結之後、案上堆積如山的課卷、把自己的精神與腦汁都吸收完了、從那時起、我已病倒不能起床了、</p>
<p>一間小小的宿舍、被深綠的椰影緊緊的遮蓋着、内面寂靜得十分的可怕、那時也似乎不感覺怎樣悲哀、只沉沉迷迷地睡在床上、靜靜地聽自己的心弦跳動、又呆呆地望着懸在窗邊的電燈、每次電燈擺動得很利害的時候、我就知道是地震了、在平時我總覺得地震是非常可怕的事、可是在病中的時候、這種思想是完全相反了、</p>
<p>有一天夜午一點多鐘的時候、山麓全村全鎭的人那沉醉在夢中了、忽然外面發出驚心動魄的警笛、我睜開睡眼、見電燈左右擺動不停、已變成慈母的搖籃了、那時、我也軟弱得像赤子一樣臥在床上、不能爬起來、</p>
<p>第二天早上有一個相知朋友走到　裏來慰問、並且她把在三月以前火山將要爆裂的現象告訴我、那是一天中午的時分、地壳劇烈的搖動、地下隱隱的發出一種聲鄉、山中惡烟瀰漫、天空黑暗無光、有許多人們都燃着手電筒、向鄰近的山頂奔逃、好像是在電影中演過的一幕慘劇、</p>
<p>在那裏被病魔苦苦地糾纒了兩月有餘、好容易才拚命的解脫、現在總算離開了那危險的火山之旁、安然的回到故國了、</p>
<h3>我畢竟是呆住了</h3>
<p>— 君姗</p>
<p>這是一個非常的結束啊、四年來的大學生活、在這裏、是宣告了它最後的结束了、</p>
<p>教務處的佈告已經貼出來了、說是我們這一級、就在明天起停課了、停課這兩個字、在往日、是多麽的會搖蕩人們的心絃、雖然說在我們的學校裏、上課與不上課、完全是要看我們自己的高興與否以爲斷的、假若不樂意的話、那麽就無故曠幾天課、也决不會發生什麽問題的、但是今天的這個停課消息、却反乎尋常地帶給了我們以一種莫可名狀的悽然、宿舍裏平日是充滿歡愉的笑語、然而這時却平添了一層慘霧、一個個都似噤住了口的默不作聲、幸福的笑靨、這時也都從每個人的臉上悄悄地溜走了、呵、我們都感覺到了、過去的四個年頭的光隂、是决不會再展露在我們未來的人生旅途上的了、雖然這過去的四個年頭的生活、是怎樣的平凡無奇、單調無聊、但在這個我們將要和它握最後一次手的時分、我們終覺得這也是個很値得我們來低個咀嚼的有意義的有價値的一個歷程喲、是的、在這過去的四個年頭裏、它是曾經很仁慈地賜給了我們很多的珍貴的禮品、但是、這些禮品喲、我們都很不經意的給抛開了、眞的、在我們的一羣裏、能有幾人是没曾辜負了它的好意的呢、</p>
<p>現在、這是我們最後的一課了、和我們感情最好的謝先生、挾着了一個皮包、愁容滿面地拖着了她那雙似乎很倦怠了的腿兒、走上了講台、但是她却破例的名也不點、書也不翻、地儘　視着我們、自然我們也一樣地點不作聲、</p>
<p>「哦、這是你們最後的一課了呢、」謝先生終於開口了、但是在那怕平日以俏皮著名的我們的一級中、也終於没有一個人敢出來說一聲「是的、」的答話、反給那本來已是沉默得很可以的空氣、更加重了一度的壓迫、越發變得死寂寂的了、</p>
<p>「你們在這個時候、内心有没有起了些任何的感動、」</p>
<p>「好、我們别再講這些呢、我們快要别了、我們該各自多說些快慰的話來祝福、」謝先生的鼻管、似乎也有些酸了吧、但是所謂快慰的話喲、只是在我們各人的腦海裏現了一現、又復如泡沬般的很快地消逝了、我們就這樣的度過了很神聖的四十分鐘、而我們最後的一課、也畢究在殘酷的時間之神毫不顧惜的迅捷底火輪下趕走了、永久不會再來的趕走了、我們又怎能不依戀、我們深悔着、早知時間是如此地容易逝去、又爲什麽一向是如此地隨便、</p>
<p>「好、再會了、諸位、好在我們還都是些靑年、就是别了、將來在社會上、總不會缺少着再聚的機緣的、努力吧、奮鬬吧、珍重吧、諸位、」謝先生急急地說完了這幾句話、一溜烟地如驚鴻般的消逝在我們的眼底下了、同時我也想起了江淹恨賦上的一句話來、「黯然銷魂者、惟别而已矣、」在一星期之後的我們底一羣、不是都要勞燕分飛、各奔東西去了嗎、如往日的團聚、又怎能期諸於將來、而且不是嗎、除了一二個運幸兒之外、我們不都是要盲目地向着那個漆黑一團的社會裏去、找求各人的歸宿了嗎、呵、這誰又能擔保着誰不有危險、能重復地度着那過去的雖說是平凡和無聊的但是很平和的生活呢、</p>
<p>呵、我畢究是呆住了、</p>

<h3>Stone Army Changes from Attack to Defense</h3>
<p>Two Attacks Repelled</p>
<p>Central Army Advances Towards Shunde</p>
<p>Wang Shuchang to Directly Seize Shizhuang</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Pinghan Railway issued a general attack order the night before last, after one battle, the Stone forces, seeing the unfavorable situation, changed from attack to defense. Soldiers avoided going out to fight. The Jinpu and Northeast armies have reached considerable locations. Liu Zhi's forces are scheduled to take Shunde today. Liaison between the armies is complete. Shi originally hoped for a response, but various parties have successively expressed support for the Central Government. Shi's army, with all its might, headed north, first abandoning Zhangde, then losing Cangzhou, eventually becoming isolated and helpless, surrounded on all sides. The Jinpu Wang Shuchang Second Army will take Shizhuang directly from Cangzhou. The Zhanghe Bridge has been repaired. A large part of the Central Army is heading north in succession. There will be fierce fighting on the Pinghan Railway tonight. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that Shi is attacked from both sides and can be resolved within days. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Northeast airplane flew to the Jinpu line at 2:00 AM this morning to inspect the deployment of various teams, returning to Beiping at 5:00 AM. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, the Shi forces launched two attacks in the Zhengding Hutuo River area, both of which were repelled by the Northeast Army, which also used airplanes to drop bombs, causing heavy casualties to the Shi army. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Deputy Commander's Headquarters received a telegram from the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau reporting that Shi Yousan, realizing his isolation, secretly ordered his representative in Tianjin to purchase three thousand taels of gold for convenient carrying when fleeing. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kaifeng 28th telegram: Liu Zhi left Bian for Zheng on the 27th noon to cross the river and handle the military affairs of suppressing Shi. Political affairs were handled by Liu Yaoyang in his place. Liu is scheduled to go to Zhangde on the 29th to oversee the situation. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Zhutong telegraphed Ma Fuxiang from Zhangde on the 27th, saying that the vanguard of our army has occupied Shahe. Most of Shi's rebels are in Wangdu and Lixian, in contact with the Northern Route Army. There are only three or four hundred people in Shunde. Our main force has advanced to Handan, and Shunde will be occupied soon. Gu went to Cangzhou on the 28th. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Staff Headquarters news: Liu Zhi and Zhang Xueliang telegraphed that they are confident in suppressing Shi and will completely resolve it within a month. However, they hope that friendly troops near Dezhou in Shandong will effectively attack from both sides, so that Shi will not be difficult to capture. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Henan telegram: Hu Zongnan's division is attacking Shunde, with incessant gunfire day and night. Scouts report that a part of the rebel army has withdrawn from Guanzhuang this morning. Yu Xuezhong is scheduled to arrive in Boye on the 28th, and Wang Shuchang will arrive in Jingxian from Cangzhou. The Shi forces moved south on the Cangshi Road on the 23rd. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jiang Bocheng said that it is a natural trend for the Central Government to hand Shi Yousan's forces over to Han to clean up. If Liu Zhi's forces arrive in Zhangde, Gu Zhutong's forces arrive in Xinxiang, and Xia Douyin's forces also go north, Shi's forces will be destroyed soon. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Zhi's representative, Xu Yaping, went to Yanzhou to discuss military affairs with Ma Hongkui. He arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 28th and is scheduled to go to Beiping on the 29th. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Han and Ma Reply to Jiang Geng's Telegram</h3>
<p>Obeying Instructions, Encouraging Soldiers</p>
<p>Life and Death are Determined by Fate, Nothing Else</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han, et al., replied to Jiang Geng's telegram, stating: "Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Nanchang, read Geng's telegram, in which red bandits, warlords, traitors, and imperialists collude with each other, remotely supporting each other, instructing all compatriots to rise up quickly and fight to save the nation from danger. The hidden pain of worrying about the country and cherishing the people, and the suffering of pacifying internal and external affairs, emerge at the same time. Anyone with blood and spirit would not be grateful and moved to tears, raising their arms to fight. Upon investigation, there have been wars and chaos in the Republic of China for twenty years. The reason is that internally, warlords think of prolonging their fate, and externally, imperialists want to greatly expand their aggression. Therefore, they use each other, and troublemakers also take the opportunity to move, helping the wicked to do evil, causing one wave to rise after another. Pain subsides, thinking is still chilling. In recent years, the red bandits have invaded, and their disaster is even more ferocious than floods and wild beasts.</p>
<p>Your Excellency is far-sighted and deeply planned, believing that if the red disaster is not eliminated, the country will be destroyed one day. Therefore, you personally lead a large army, braving the summer heat to enter Jiangxi, repeatedly conquering famous cities, and directly attacking lairs, vowing not to stop until these ugly creatures are annihilated. This is the supreme intention of worrying about the country and relieving the people, which is not only admired by fellow soldiers, but also entrusted by heaven and man. As for internal changes due to political disputes, initially it was thought that they were all revolutionary comrades. Even if there were occasional misunderstandings, once explained, they should still mourn the danger of the country and the suffering of the people, turn around and repent, and jointly achieve the success of peace and unification. How can reports from various parties say that they are colluding with the red bandits and even willing to work for the imperialists? Fuju is humbly ranked in the military. Since following Your Excellency, I have been engaged in revolution. Although I am ashamed of not being able to help the current difficulties, I have always adhered to the ambition of maintaining peace and unification, and I have never dared to change it.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Active Production (II)</h3>
<p>Now, let me further elaborate on the meaning of active production.</p>
<p>Currently, Chinese society is in the process of shedding the rigid shell of an agricultural society and transitioning into the early stages of an industrial society. Compared to industrialized nations in Europe, America, and Japan, it lags behind by almost a century. The foundation of our old society has already collapsed, while the foundation of the new society has not yet been established. Handicraft manufactured goods are about to disappear from our markets. But what replaces them are not machine-industrial products from our own country. Small-scale farming is on the verge of bankruptcy. But large-scale agricultural operations are still rare domestically. The collapse of the old society is like crushing dry wood, while the construction of the new society is like moving mountains. Given the size of our land and the multitude of our people, coupled with open doors and low tariffs, it is inevitable that we become the drainage ditch for world commodities. According to customs reports, from 1929 to March 1930, food imported into China from foreign countries was worth a total of 269,838,505 Haikwan taels, with rice, grains, flour, and sugar being the major items. Clothing was worth a total of 371,873,941 Haikwan taels, with cotton fabrics, cotton, wool fabrics, and silk fabrics being the major items. Building materials were worth a total of 58,522,761 Haikwan taels, with metals and wood being the major items. Transportation materials were worth a total of 44,382,443 Haikwan taels, with coal being the major item. Looking at the four items of clothing, food, housing, and transportation alone,</p>
<p>China's outflow of wealth has reached 744,382,443 Haikwan taels. Other industrial goods, chemical goods, decorative items, military supplies, etc., have not been included. If the Chinese people in the future cannot live in humble homes, travel on narrow mountain paths, eat simple meals, or wear simple clothes, then our clothing, food, housing, and transportation will all be in the hands of others. Not to mention the usual outflow of interests, once an international incident occurs and a country seals our ports with warships, cutting off the source of supply, wouldn't the Chinese people be left helpless to die? Looking again at Japan's trade with us, from 1868 (Tongzhi 3rd year) to this year, except for five years in total (1870 and three years after 1891), there has not been a year without a trade surplus. Its proportion in the total amount of its exports to us in the world is often 30%. However, what it exports to us are mostly essential consumer goods. Basic industrial necessities and industrial raw materials are extremely limited. If the Chinese people work hard and start manufacturing these essential consumer goods themselves, self-sufficiency would not be difficult. As mentioned above, what China urgently needs to work on today, and what determines China's future national destiny, is to gather the strength of the whole country and actively produce. If domestic basic industries are revitalized and industrial raw materials are developed, Europe and America will be at a loss, let alone Japan. If we cannot do this, then the right to survival of our people will be in the hands of others. The danger to the country's future will be even more unpredictable.</p>
<p>With China's vast land and abundant resources, fertile agricultural products, and mineral deposits everywhere, various industrial raw materials are inexhaustible. Taking advantage of this natural wealth and adding human effort to enrich our country and revitalize our nation is the sacred duty that the Chinese people should shoulder today. Having resources but not producing, leaving goods to waste, and constantly lamenting poverty is truly foolish.</p>
<p>What is the way to produce? The reporter humbly offers four points: Gather the strength of the whole country and strive to (1) develop domestic transportation, (2) reclaim domestic wasteland, (3) develop various industrial raw materials, and (4) establish various basic industries.</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Arrives in Berlin</h3>
<p>First Time in Fifty Years</p>
<p>Warmly Welcomed by Germans</p>
<p>German Chancellor Hosts Dinner</p>
<p>Met with Hindenburg Yesterday</p>
<p>London Stops Outflow to Paris</p>
<p>New Bank Formally Established</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 27th - British Prime Minister MacDonald arrived here today and was warmly welcomed. Crowds gathered at the station, and as the Prime Minister alighted from the train, cries of "Welcome MacDonald, Friend of Peace" rang out. Today, all newspapers published portraits of the Prime Minister. This is the first time a British Prime Minister has visited the German capital since the Berlin Congress of 1878.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 27th - Tonight, German Chancellor Brüning hosted a dinner in honor of British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Henderson. Important talks were held between the two sides during the dinner. The reception was held at the Chancellor's Office on Wilhelmstrasse, where former German Chancellor Bismarck received British Prime Minister Beaconsfield and Gladstone, making the banquet historically significant. During the dinner, Brüning rose first to toast the health of the British Emperor and the German President. He expressed his gratitude for the warm reception he and Curtius had received during their two visits to England and said that he was finally able to reciprocate the hospitality. As for Germany's current crisis, he believed that the British Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were already fully aware of it. Germany was willing to do its utmost to deal with this crisis, but the crisis was far-reaching and largely due to the demands of foreign banks to withdraw their deposits in Germany. He hoped that the international banking community could sincerely cooperate with Germany. Brüning then praised Prime Minister MacDonald's contribution to the Hoover Plan. MacDonald rose after Brüning to deliver a reply, saying that he and Henderson had come to Germany not only to reciprocate the two visits of the German leaders, but also to express Britain's sympathy to Germany on behalf of the British people. He was confident that Germany could overcome this danger with its great moral and economic strength. A free and self-respecting Germany was an indispensable part of the community of modern civilized nations. Given Germany's past contributions to world civilization, art, and other fields, other countries could not stand idly by in this time of crisis. Fortunately, the motivation to help Germany was already underway, and all countries were willing to cooperate to overcome this economic crisis that affected all countries. He hoped that Gurtz's trip last month and the British leaders' visit to Germany would prove the necessity of international cooperation. MacDonald praised France's magnanimous attitude and willingness to cooperate at the London Conference. MacDonald concluded by urging young people of all countries to rise up and support international understanding and cooperation among the world's major powers.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 28th - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Henderson, accompanied by British Ambassador to Germany Rumbold, visited German President Hindenburg this morning and had a lengthy discussion. Later, Chancellor Brüning hosted a banquet for the British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 28th - The majority of the German media welcomed MacDonald's visit warmly, while conservative and nationalist newspapers adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The Lokal-Anzeiger stated that Henderson, as chairman of next year's Disarmament Conference, was eager to establish an understanding between Germany and France in advance. The basis for this was that Germany must cease building pocket battleships, while France would abandon the construction of its 23,000-ton battleships. The Berliner Tageblatt stated that Franco-German relations would depend on the outcome of the Anglo-German talks. Furthermore, US Secretary of State Stimson, in his recent talks with Brüning and Curtius, strongly advocated that Germany should find ways to promote the harmony of Franco-German relations. According to political circles, the Anglo-German talks would focus on political matters, while economic issues would be temporarily put aside pending a resolution between the German government and domestic and foreign banks.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 27th - London cash stopped flowing to Paris yesterday, reportedly as a result of cooperation between major British and French bankers. Reuters, New York, reported that the American banking community was concerned about the large accumulation of cash in Paris and New York and was pleased to see that British gold was no longer being exported. According to some financiers, excessive cash accumulation would undermine the gold standard as an instrument of international trade and give rise to disturbing calls for bimetallism.</p>

<h3>Telegram from Shenyang</h3>
<p>To All Newspapers: Shi Yousan is by nature fond of disorder and constantly changes sides. At a time when the campaign against the Red Army is in full swing and foreign relations are strained, he suddenly attempts to act cunningly, raises troops for no reason, disturbs our peace, and troubles our troops, giving support to bandits and causing suspicion among neighboring countries. Tracing his actions and reviewing his crimes, he is not only in collusion with the Red bandits, but can also be equated with treason. Now is the period of political tutelage, and everything is waiting to be managed. How can we allow rebels to obstinately obstruct progress? This committee, with its eyes on the difficulties of the times, cannot remain silent. In addition to telegraphed to President Zhang and requesting the Central Government to forward a letter to the National Government,</p>
<p>explicitly ordering a punitive expedition to uphold national law, we hereby specifically declare his crimes and respectfully inform the people.

Shi Yousan's rebellion, selling the country and harming the people, you are consolidating unity, denounce the crimes, the words are severe and righteous, the whole country admire. Shi Yousan inherited the old tricks of Feng Yuxiang's fickleness, using the people to satisfy his animal desires of whipping and straw dogs. The smoke destroyed by his actions, and the scars left behind in Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong and Anhui are still there. Our central government, considering the suffering of the people, maintained peace, and did not immediately punish him explicitly, but gave him complete consideration. If the reverse is slightly conscience, How should you wash your heart and work hard to extricate yourself, but take advantage of the urgency of foreign troubles and the ambition of the Red bandits, rebelliously rebellious, and willingly become the vultures of the Red and White imperialists, this is tolerable, which is intolerable. The entire masses of the entire province of Henan, and Shi Yousan are inexhaustible, this government must follow public opinion and do its utmost to support the anti-red army. It will be seen that the flag should be referred to, the inverse fire will be burned, and the heroes will be strong, and the Yuan evil will be handed over. 1 The Provisional Government of Henan Province and others, with the shameless gang of demons of Shi Niyi, will not be difficult to exterminate by counting the days.

<h3>A Study of Korean Immigration to the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Continued from part six) Bin</p>
<p>As for the wide distribution area of the Korean people, it is even more astonishing. Among the forty-two counties in Jilin Province, only a few counties have no Koreans. In the four counties of Yanbian, the number of Koreans is actually more than that of our own people. In recent years, in our inland provinces, along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the people suffer from overcrowding and have no way to find food. However, the vast wilderness between Changbai Mountain and Heilongjiang is open to anyone who invades, while we ourselves do not know how to immigrate. This phenomenon is probably unique among the countries of the world. The following table is recorded to show the universality of its distribution in the Jilin province.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Telegraphically Denounces Shi Yousan</h3>
<p>▲Betraying the Party and the Country is Disloyal▲Indulging Soldiers to Harm the People is Unbenevolent</p>
<p>▲Rebelling Against Superiors is Unrighteous▲Breaking Oaths and Going Back on Words is Untrustworthy</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The circumstances of Shi Yousan's rebellion have been detailed in previous reports. On the 15th of this month, Shi's army began to advance north from Shunde. The Northeast Army was ordered to retreat, as Zhang Xueliang, considering the internal and external troubles at a critical juncture, did not want to start another civil war and invite contempt. Therefore, he tried to avoid conflict, hoping to prompt Shi's people to awaken. However, Shi insisted on his own way and never looked back. On the 16th, he advanced to Neiqiu, on the 17th to Lincheng, on the 18th to Gaoyi, and on the 19th to Yuanshi. On the 20th, he reached Shijiazhuang, marching straight down as if entering an uninhibited territory. In Shi's mind, he believed that the Northeast Army was not worth fighting, so in five days, he managed to march over 300 miles. In the future, taking Tianjin would be as easy as taking something from a bag. On the evening of occupying Shijiazhuang, he immediately sent a general telegram with his number from Shunde using a wireless spring. The text was 3,000 words long and listed the names of 28 generals. Zhang Xueliang, at this point, could no longer tolerate it and urgently ordered Yu Xuezhong to rush to Baoding to arrange defenses and meet the enemy head-on. The first line of defense was in Zhengding, and the second line of defense was in Wangdu. Zhang's painstaking efforts to maintain peace in North China were now completely hopeless. On the same day (the 23rd), he issued a telegram, which was solemn and righteous. The telegram was already published in the previous report, but there was also a telegram on the (22nd), indicating to the Northeast generals, listing Shi's four major crimes, which was particularly gratifying. The original text is recorded below. Urgent: Commander Yu (Xuezhong) of Baoding, to be transferred to all subordinate brigade commanders; Army Commander Wang (Shuchang) of Tianjin, to be transferred to all subordinate brigade commanders; Garrison Commander Zhang (Xueming) of the Municipal Government; Beiping Garrison Headquarters; Deputy Commander of the Military Police; Commander Fu (ZhanKui) of the Second Cavalry Division; Brigade Commander Miao (Zhuoliu) of the Sixteenth Brigade; Nanyuan Aviation Second Team; Brigade Commander Liu (Yifei) of Zhangjiakou; Brigade Commander Huang (Shiyue) of Renqiu; Brigade Commander Yu (Zhaolin) of Langfang; Shenyang Chief Executive's Office; Northeast Training Committee; Northeast Military Academy; Northeast Aviation Command; Acting Commander Zhang (Zuoxiang); Northeast Military Police Command Commander Chen (Xingya); Guard Commander Liu (Duoquan); Brigade Commander Wang (Yizhe) of the Seventh Brigade; Brigade Commander Zhang (Zuozhou) of Jinzhou; Brigade Commander He (Zhuguo) of Shanhaiguan; Regiment Commander Du of Dalinghe; Zhenshoushi Yu of Hailong; Zhang Zhenshoushi of Taonan; Taonan Reclamation Office; Jilin Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office, to be transferred to all subordinate divisions and brigade commanders; Zhenshoushi Ding (Chao) of Harbin; Zhenshoushi Shi of Yanji; Zhenshoushi Zhao of Ningguta; Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office of Qiqihar, to be transferred to all subordinate brigade commanders; Commander Su (Bingwen) of Hailar; Commander Ma of Hailanpao; Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office of Chengde Prefecture, to be transferred to all subordinate brigade commanders; Deputy Commander Shen (Honglie) of the Qingdao Naval Command, to be transferred to Captain Ling (Xiao), Captain Yuan (Fangqiao), and all captains: Xueliang was previously hospitalized for illness, but fortunately, he has recovered, which is deeply gratifying to all my beloved generals and soldiers, and deeply hated by those who see us as enemies. Now, Shi Yousan, taking advantage of my illness and weakness, led troops to invade northward. His wolfish ambitions and fondness for disorder are well known. First, he betrayed Feng Huanzhang, then Chairman Jiang, and then Yan Baichuan. He disregards faith and righteousness and only seeks profit. Now, he is using his old tricks again on my Northeast. What has my Northeast done to offend Shi Yousan? To sum up his life, he has several evils. The brutality of the Red Bandits is known to everyone. In Xiang, Jiangxi and other provinces, the lessons are clear, but Shi Yousan shared their money, recognized thieves as fathers, and his rebellious actions are obvious and undeniable. Betraying the Party and the country is disloyal. The borders of Hebei and Henan are restless, but Shi's troops stationed there did not quell them but instead colluded with them, mixing soldiers and bandits, tyrannizing the good people, and causing cries of despair in the wilderness and sighs of shared death. Indulging bandits to harm the people is unbenevolent. Shi Yousan came from humble origins and was favored by Feng, who raised him up. As the chief staff officer, his wings grew strong, and he betrayed him. Commander-in-Chief Jiang treated him with sincerity and Yan Baichuan relied on him heavily, but he suddenly abandoned them. My Northeast provided funds and equipment, and his requests were always met. What suspicion or doubt led to his rebellion? His repeated betrayals are shameless and arouse the anger of both gods and men. Rebelling against superiors is unrighteous. Shi Yousan went to Shenyang before, humble and obsequious, crying bitterly to show his sincerity, supporting the central government, swearing to Heaven and Earth. How long has it been? The blood on his mouth has not yet dried, and he has rebelled again. Breaking oaths and going back on words is untrustworthy. Having one of these is unforgivable, let alone all four. He is hastening his own destruction. Now, fortunately, the central government's troops are chasing closely behind, and the Northeast soldiers are attacking head-on. He is like a fish in a cauldron or a beast in a trap. Seizing the flag and breaking through the bamboo will be a matter of time. It is hoped that the generals at the front will encourage their soldiers to bravely fight to be the first, kill the enemy and achieve results, and annihilate these ugly creatures. Wherever they go, they must strictly restrain their troops and not commit the slightest offense. If anyone dares to retreat, disobey military orders, or disturb the people, military law is in place and will not be lenient. The rear troops should intensify training, await orders, and eliminate evil for the country without hesitation. Distinguished service will be rewarded according to the established principles of the country. This is hereby announced in the district, and I cannot help but look forward. In addition, all officers should explain the contents of the telegram to the soldiers in detail to encourage them. Zhang Xueliang, (July 24).</p>

<h3>Wang Rongbao's Talk Upon Arriving at Shingishu</h3>
<p>▲The most severe losses were suffered by our compatriots in Pyongyang</p>
<p>▲The Japanese authorities should bear the responsibility</p>
<p>Minister Wang Rongbao, residing in Japan, arrived at Shingishu at 11:37 AM on July 22nd from Pyongyang. He was greeted by Consul Zhu Fu at the Shingishu Consulate, rested for a few minutes, and then went to meet the Governor of Shingishu. He returned to the consulate at noon, when a reporter arrived at Shingishu from Andong via the river. The reporter immediately visited Wang, who made a statement to the reporter, saying, "I received an order from the Ministry on July 9th to investigate the Korean incident. I departed from Tokyo on the 13th, passing through Busan, Gyeongseong, Incheon, Pyongyang, Zhennampo, and other places. The investigation has lasted more than ten days. Based on what I have learned, Pyongyang has suffered the most severely. The businesses of overseas Chinese can be said to have been completely destroyed. Over 300 large businesses were completely looted, and no goods or furniture were spared. There were originally over 7,000 overseas Chinese in the area. The day of the incident was a Sunday. The local Japanese authorities were all out on holiday, and the more than 200 police officers were also dispersed in various places. By the time the officials learned of the incident, they were unable to stop it. It was not until 3 AM on the sixth day that the police began to wear weapons and go out to guard the area, but it was too late. The damage and looting had already been done. According to the Japanese side, a total of 95 compatriots died tragically in Pyongyang. The place of their burial was inspected by the Minister of Internal Affairs and others from the Provincial Office. There were 95 tombs, each with an altar in front and offerings of incense and flowers. I lingered for a long time before leaving. The Japanese officials said that there was one person in each grave, but they were only temporarily buried. In the future, the Chinese authorities will be able to open the graves and transport the coffins. I think that in the future, when negotiating this case, we must first investigate the exact number of tragic deaths of our compatriots. Opening the graves for verification is probably unavoidable, and the Japanese will probably not refuse. The situation in other places, such as Incheon and Gyeongseong, was lighter, with fewer deaths and injuries.</p>
<h3>Photography of the Korean Riot Case (1): The state of Koreans hanging cloths and ribbons on electric poles after a Chinese store in Seoul was destroyed</h3>
<p>According to my investigation, there is no way to prove whether Japan had any political role in this Korean riot. However, the Japanese authorities in Pyongyang were negligent in their prevention before the incident and ineffective in their protection during the incident, but they tried their best to provide relief afterwards. It is difficult to absolve them of the responsibility for their negligence. The reason why the Chinese people point fingers at the Japanese for secretly instigating the riot is not without cause. Whenever Koreans cause trouble, they always try to shift the responsibility to the Japanese, saying that they were instigated by the Japanese. Moreover, the Chinese people have always resented Japan, so it is natural for them to be angry with Japan when this incident occurred. However, the Koreans are under Japanese jurisdiction, and no matter how much the Japanese try to quibble, the facts are there, and it is difficult to evade responsibility. As for the damage claimed by the Japanese side, from my point of view, we must first ask whether the overseas Chinese have suffered any losses. If there are indeed losses, Japan must be responsible for compensation. Therefore, I reported to the Ministry based on this idea. It is difficult to obtain an accurate number of losses suffered by the overseas Chinese in Pyongyang without a detailed investigation. Currently, it is estimated that the losses are approximately 2.4 million Japanese yen. Approximately 2,000 overseas Chinese are returning home one after another, but with their families broken and their homes empty, they have no ability to resume business. Returning home is only to handle the aftermath. I visited the injured overseas Chinese in the shelter. There were still 70 injured people in the shelter. When they saw me, they were as if they were seeing their own parents, and they complained one after another. One of them cried and lost his voice because his wife and children had died and his family property had been lost. I comforted him one by one. The shelter is in the Japanese Medical Lecture Hall and has a grass shed that can accommodate about 2,000 to 3,000 people. The living and medical care are acceptable. Various parties have remitted money to provide relief to the overseas Chinese. Approximately 7,000 Japanese yen has been received. On the day the riot occurred, Zhennampo was also in a state of emergency. The local consul was unable to take care of it, which inevitably led to the incident. This must be attributed to the fact that our country did not set up a consulate in Pyongyang. When I came to investigate, I met with Foreign Minister Shidehara, who expressed his extreme apology for the incident in Korea and stated that the government has taken responsibility for suppressing it. The newly appointed Governor-General of Korea, Ura, took office on the 14th, and the Minister of Internal Affairs took office on the 7th. Both have issued orders for strict prevention. I will investigate here (Shingishu) for a day or two and then go to Liaoning to contact the Northeast Political Committee to inquire about the truth of the Wanpaoshan case. Then I will go to Beijing to see Deputy Commander Zhang, and I will go to Beijing via the Jinpu Road in early August." Those who accompanied Mr. Wang included Ren Jiafeng, Consul General in Kobe. When they arrived in Shingishu, overseas Chinese merchants hung up flags to welcome them, and the chief of the Japanese police station also personally led police officers to protect them. (Sent from Andong on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>The situation of Overseas Chinese Passing Through Andong</h3>
<p>▲Over 7,000 people fled back to the country</p>
<p>▲Over 6,000 people have returned home one after another</p>
<p>The reporter arrived in Andong on the evening of July 20th, accompanied by Jin Guanwu and Tian Songsheng, representatives from various groups in Harbin to comfort the overseas Chinese who suffered in the disaster. After arriving in Andong, I wrote a letter to the Yalu River Spring Hotel and visited County Chief Wang Jie Gong and President of the County Chamber of Commerce Sun Langxuan that night, but they were not there because it was late. I visited them again at 8:00 AM on the 21st and found out about the situation of the overseas Chinese in Andong and the relief efforts. The Chamber of Commerce sent personnel to guide me to the overseas Chinese shelter and hospital for investigation. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Number of Overseas Chinese Passing Through Andong: After the Korean riots occurred in Pyongyang and other places, Shingishu, which is separated from Andong by the Yalu River, was initially calm. It was not until the 7th that Koreans suddenly gathered to beat the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese were unable to resist and fled to Andong. Fortunately, the river bridge was passable, so it was easy to escape. In the early morning, more than 200 people arrived first, all fleeing alone. With no relatives to turn to, they appointed a representative to lead them to the County Government to appeal to the County Chief. The County Chief then transferred the matter to Zhang Hanwei, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Sun Langxuan, President of the Chamber of Commerce. It was decided to open the Dan Gui stage as a temporary shelter for the returning overseas Chinese. In the afternoon of the same day, more than 1,000 people arrived again. Since the Dan Gui Garden could not accommodate them, the Xin Ming Theater and the Dongming, Dongping, and Northeast Three Movie Theaters were successively occupied and numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. As the days went by, more and more refugees returned. In addition to Shingishu, many also came from Pyongyang. All five shelters were suddenly full. The number of men and women reached more than 3,000. Recently, except for those who were injured or had other reasons and did not leave Andong immediately, and 290 people remained in the shelters, the rest were sent back home by local authorities with funds, or transferred to other places to make a living.</p>
<p>▲Detailed Numbers of Those Sheltering in Andong: Some of the overseas Chinese were acquainted with merchants in the streets of Andong and stayed in their homes or hotels, while others were unaware of the official shelters. The Public Security Bureau of the Andong Commercial Port conducted a detailed investigation, and the numbers are as follows: Within the jurisdiction of the First Branch Bureau, the number of men and women staying in hotels was 11, women 146, totaling 857 people; within the jurisdiction of the Second Branch Bureau, the number of men staying in hotels was 95, women 1, totaling 96 people; within the jurisdiction of the Third Branch Bureau, the number of men staying in hotels was 59, women 13, totaling 73 people; within the jurisdiction of the First Branch Bureau, the number of men lodging with merchants was 447, women 137, totaling 584 people; within the jurisdiction of the Second Branch Bureau, the number of men lodging with merchants was 215, women 145, totaling 360 people; within the jurisdiction of the Third Branch Bureau, the number of men lodging with merchants was 197, women 93, totaling 290 people; the number lodging with merchants was 864 men and 370 women, totaling 1,234 people. The number of overseas Chinese who fled from various places was 3,180 men and 1,295 women who fled from Shingishu; 124 men and 50 women who fled from Huancheon; 73 men and 19 women who fled from Pyongyang; 34 men and 7 women who fled from Jeongju; 99 men and 22 women who fled from Shinanju; 6 men and 3 women who fled from Namcheon; 31 men and 6 women who fled from Pihyeon; 10 men and 5 women who fled from Hancheon; 8 men and 2 women who fled from Hwanghae-do; 36 men and 6 women who fled from Bukhadong; 1 man and 3 women who fled from Baengma River; 20 men and 2 women who fled from Incheon; 72 men and 8 women who fled from Bocheon; 10 men who fled from Tasanpo; 3 men who fled from Yeongmae; 2 men who fled from Jogwan; 2 men who fled from Suan; 1 man who fled from Manggyeong; in total, the number of overseas Chinese who arrived in Andong was over 7,000.</p>

<p>▲Number of Deaths After Arriving in Andong: 24 overseas Chinese who arrived in Andong were seriously injured, and the number of slightly injured was countless. A girl named Shi, aged 12, died on July 8th due to her injuries. Dong Xiaowang Ding Liangshi died on July 9th. Those who were seriously injured were sent to the Andong Charity Hospital for medical treatment. As of July 21st, only Sun Yongnian, his daughter, and four companions were hospitalized. The rest had either been discharged from the hospital and were staying in the shelters or were in a hurry to leave and had painfully set off. The Christian Charity Hospital also sent doctors to the shelters every day to provide care to the injured, so the number of those discharged from the hospital was greatly reduced, which relieved much suffering. According to the Public Security Bureau's investigation, a list of those seriously injured is as follows:</p>
<p>Name　Age　Origin　Occupation　From where in Korea　Condition of injury　Gender</p>
<p>Dong Xiaoyu　3　Yizhou　Vegetable grower　Shingishu　Fell and injured　Female</p>

<p>▲ Andong Circles Provide Relief: The Overseas Chinese Refugee Camp, initially established in five locations, was consolidated as many overseas Chinese left. Currently, only 290 people remain in Andong. The other four locations have been merged, and all are now housed in the First Refugee Camp within Dan Gui Yuan. The County Government Public Security Bureau and Chamber of Commerce have each dispatched specialists to establish a refugee camp office within the Yuan, dedicated to handling overseas Chinese affairs. Overseas Chinese receive two meals daily, one at 8 a.m. and another at 4 p.m., consisting of millet porridge and cornbread cakes, accompanied by pickled vegetables. Those wishing to travel elsewhere or return to their hometowns are provided with travel expenses based on their circumstances, and an additional two yuan is given as pocket money per person. Various circles and shops in Andong have voluntarily donated funds, accumulating over ten thousand yuan. Combined with the three thousand yuan raised by various circles in Liaoning, the total amounts to 16,299.20 Andong small silver dollars, 5,278.60 silver dollars, 755 Feng banknotes, and 5 gold banknotes. Over eight thousand yuan has already been spent, but it is feared that this will not be sufficient, and fundraising efforts are still underway.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu Ruoyu's Talk After Returning to Qingdao</h3>
<p>▲ Han Fuju Decides to Send Troops to Punish Shi</p>
<p>▲ No Security Problems on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line</p>
<p>▲ Military Action Against Shi Will Not Escalate</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu went to Beiping to serve concurrently as Acting Mayor of Beiping Municipality for nearly four months. Recently, Mr. Hu handed over the concurrent post in Beiping, and the merchants and residents of this city eagerly anticipated his return to office to undertake reorganization. He only arrived back in Qingdao on the Jiaoji Railway car at 10:35 last night (the 23rd). Those who welcomed him at the station included members of the Municipal Steering Committee, Jiaoji Railway Chairman Ge Guangting, the Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and various committee members, totaling about two hundred people. The Public Security Bureau also dispatched security teams to temporarily stand guard near the station. After Mr. Hu got off the train, he briefly interacted with those who welcomed him and then took a car to the official residence to rest. According to Mr. Hu's conversation with a certain dignitary, he originally wanted to return to Qingdao earlier, but his departure was repeatedly delayed due to his slow recovery from illness. Commander Zhang then instructed him to go to Jinan to consult with Chairman Han on all issues in North China, which inevitably led to further delays. The results of his consultation with Chairman Han in Jinan were satisfactory. Han expressed extreme obedience to the Central Government and Commander Zhang. Han said that with the Communist bandits not yet suppressed and diplomatic storms looming, he did not want to see another war break out in North China. Therefore, he had repeatedly offered advice to the Shi army, hoping they would reflect. If Shi remained stubborn, all military actions would follow Commander Zhang's lead. Currently, Shandong's defenses are extremely solid. In the northern part of Shandong, joint defenses have been established with the Northeast Army. There should be no security problems along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. Mr. Hu also said that Commander Zhang had indeed recovered from his illness and could be discharged from the hospital after a short period of recuperation. Commander Zhang had already made plans for the steps to be taken in the campaign against the Shi army. The Jin army also expressed great dissatisfaction with Shi's vacillation and inconsistency and decided to unite with the Northeast Army. Commander Yu (Xuezhong) has already departed for the front line, and military affairs at the front are being commanded by him. Henan Commander-in-Chief Liu (Zhi) is also supervising the troops northward. Even if the two armies come into contact, the war will certainly not escalate and can be resolved in the shortest possible time, etc. (July 24th)</p>
<h3>Flood Relief News from Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>▲ Thirty-One Counties Report Major Flooding</p>
<p>▲ Relief Meeting to be Held on Thursday</p>
<p>Continuous heavy rain has been pouring down, and reports of major flooding have been pouring in from both sides of the Yangtze River, affecting up to thirty-one counties. The rising water level in the canal north of the Yangtze River, where the dams are in imminent danger, is particularly concerning. After receiving reports from various counties, Civil Affairs Director Hu Pu'an originally intended to personally inspect the disaster areas immediately. However, as the province's relief policy had not yet been fully discussed, he submitted a request to the provincial government for a large special appropriation for disaster relief to assist the severely affected counties in implementing price stabilization measures. He also requested that the provincial Farmers Bank handle the pledge of rice for loans when the new grain comes to market this year. Meanwhile, he dispatched county magistrates to grain-producing counties to urge the reorganization of accumulated grain and to recover misappropriated and embezzled special funds for accumulated grain from previous handlers. Furthermore, he personally drafted this year's relief methods and scheduled a provincial relief meeting for this Thursday (July 30th) to be proposed for discussion. After a decision is made, emergency relief and work relief efforts will immediately be launched. It is also heard that Director Hu, accompanied by the head of the Fifth Section of the department, Lin Wenqin, went to the outskirts of the provincial capital yesterday afternoon for a week-long inspection. According to the department's news, after the disaster relief meeting on Thursday, Mr. Hu will personally go to the disaster areas north of the Yangtze River together with committee member Wang Yiting, etc., for inspection.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Guangji Embankment in Anhui Province Collapses, Causing Disaster</h3>
<p>▲ Breach of Over Thirty Zhang, Hundreds of Li Become a Watery Land</p>
<p>▲ Rice Prices in the Provincial Capital Soar, Martial Law Imposed to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Guangji Embankment in Anhui Province, due to continuous rising water levels, had been undergoing emergency repairs. However, at 1:00 p.m. on the 26th, the Shangshi Village area at the Qianjiangkou 40 li downstream of Anqing experienced undercurrents and deep erosion of the embankment foot due to excessive flushing by the river tide. Despite rescue efforts, a breach of over thirty zhang occurred. The houses and fields of seventeen bao, spanning over a hundred li within the embankment, instantly turned into a watery land. Countless people and animals were swept away, resulting in a disaster of the magnitude not seen in thirty years. (The embankment had previously collapsed in the 27th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu during the Qing Dynasty.) After this news spread to the province, the price of rice in Anhui suddenly soared, from ten yuan to twelve yuan per shi. Flour increased from over three yuan to more than five yuan per bag, and there was fierce competition to buy it. Subsequently, officials dispatched military police to stand guard in front of the rice shops to suppress the situation, and order was restored. To provide relief to the disaster victims and maintain public order, Acting Chairman Zhu Xi convened a temporary emergency meeting at the provincial government on the evening of the 26th, attended by party and government committee members, as well as military and police officials. Five measures were decided upon: (1) Designate higher ground outside the city to erect temporary shelters to serve as refugee camps; (2) Assign the Director of the Anqing Public Security Bureau, Li Yue, and the Magistrate of Huaining County, Wang Cuimin, to be responsible for building shelters and providing relief, with the participation of provincial and county party headquarters, various departments of the provincial government, and the Chamber of Commerce; (3) Consult with the General Headquarters and order the Public Security Bureau to temporarily declare martial law; (4) Prohibit disaster victims from entering the city in groups to prevent troublemakers from taking the opportunity to mix in and disrupt public order; (5) Convene the Chamber of Commerce to organize emergency relief and discuss post-disaster arrangements. After the meeting, Fan Xiji, Acting Commander of the Reserve Army Corps, issued an order declaring martial law and appointed Liang Hongen, Acting Division Commander of the 57th Division, as the Martial Law Commander, with Li Yue, Director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, and Hao Jiajun, Commander of the Provincial Government Guard Regiment, as Deputy Commanders. The 57th Division headquarters was immediately established as the Martial Law Headquarters, and nine articles of martial law were promulgated, stipulating that no pedestrians were allowed to pass through the streets after 10:00 p.m. unless they held a pass issued by the headquarters. All entertainment venues were required to close one hour before the curfew.</p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. on the 27th, a joint meeting was held at the provincial government, resolving to establish a temporary Guangji Embankment flood relief committee that day. Before the official establishment of the committee, the Huaining County Government and the Provincial Public Security Bureau were requested to continue to be responsible for matters related to the relief of Guangji Embankment. In addition, after the embankment collapsed, the provincial government immediately ordered the Finance Department to quickly allocate 3,000 yuan for emergency relief, which was used by the county government and the Public Security Bureau to set up refugee camps outside the East Gate in Dazhi Lake. Various charitable organizations purchased food and transported it for distribution. The Panbo Management Office dispatched ships to rescue disaster victims. Regarding the rice problem, the provincial government convened representatives of the rice industry to discuss the matter. It ordered the rice purchased in Wu to be quickly transported to the province and one thousand dan of grain from the Wanyi Granary to be milled to maintain the food supply for the people. The County Government Public Security Bureau also issued a proclamation prohibiting rice merchants from raising rice prices and residents from causing trouble due to the disaster. As a result, public order in the provincial capital was extremely peaceful. (July 28th)</p>
<h3>Madame Song's Coffin Returns South</h3>
<p>▲ Important Figures All Visit the Song Residence to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>▲ Transported to Shanghai by the Hai Chen Warship</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Madame Song Ziwen passed away in Qingdao on the 23rd. It is learned that after Song Ziwen and Song Zian transported the coffin from Shanghai on the 25th, the encoffining ceremony was held at 12:00 noon on the 26th. Important figures from various institutions and organizations in the city all visited the Song residence to offer condolences.

<p>Defendant Detained in Li Case for Trial: The compensation portion of the case of Li Ashou's tragic death was resolved for 4,400 yuan the day before yesterday. Wu Xilin and Zhu Meisen, who had repeatedly failed to appear in court, arrived in court yesterday. Chief Prosecutor Zhou summoned Sun Wuqing, the accountant of Yongyu Silk Factory, and the plaintiffs, Li Bao's wife and Wang Zhao's younger brother, as well as Wang Ciqing, the representative of the support association, and issued warrants for the arrest of the imprisoned criminals Wang Yucheng and Song Ada. The court hearing began, first with Chief Zhou transmitting the warrants to Wang Ciqing, the representative of the support association, and the plaintiffs, Li Bao's wife and Wang Zhao's younger brother. Then, the three defendants, Wu, Zhu, and Sun, were questioned in detail about the 4,400 yuan compensation fee.

<p>Appeal for Confiscated National Goods: On the 25th, Lixin Dyeing and Weaving Company entrusted Tongyi Transfer Company to transport fifteen boxes of cloth produced by the factory, a total of 636 bolts, to the Shanghai branch for sale. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, they were detained by the Youri Association Inspection Office in Zhabei as Japanese goods. The company argued that the factory's products had previously been granted national goods certificates by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which were published in the gazette for all provinces and cities to purchase. Furthermore, Japanese goods are only smuggled from Shanghai to the interior, and there is no case of goods being shipped from the interior to Shanghai. The target of the anti-Japanese movement should be to actively promote national goods, so how can it be possible to obstruct the sale of national goods? Yesterday, the company sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce requesting that it telegraph the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association to investigate the goods and expedite their return to avoid hindering the sale of national goods and delighting those who hate us.</p>
<p>Li Gong's Corpse Exhumed for Examination Yesterday: The case of the unclear death of Gong, the wife of Li Zhilin, a villager from Li Lane, 142nd Tu, near Yangshu Village in the 16th District (Wan'an City), was initially investigated by county court officials who found no injuries and determined that she had drowned.

After receiving the petition, the High Court reviewed the case files and scheduled the exhumation for the 28th. It is learned that at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Zhou Erkai of the court, accompanied by Prosecutor Du Jiasheng, Secretary Ni, Wu County Coroner Xuan Fang, County Coroner Shen Zuchan, judicial police chief, and more than ten police officers, traveled to Huishan by rickshaw. The coffin was opened by earthworkers, and Coroner Xuan saw that the corpse's flesh had rotted away, making re-examination impossible. He immediately reported to Chief Zhou that only bone steaming and examination could be performed. Chief Zhou opened the court and questioned Gong Gentang about whether he wanted to have the bones steamed and examined. Gong said that his daughter had injuries on both hands, a hole in her right shoulder, two holes in her buttocks, and an injury on her right foot. He hesitated about steaming the bones for examination. Finally, he signed a pledge to steam the bones for examination. Chief Zhou immediately ordered Jiang Zixian, the Tu Chief of Huishan, to purchase all necessary items. After lunch, Chief Zhou returned to the court, leaving Prosecutor Du at the scene for Coroner Xuan to scrape off the rotten flesh from the corpse bones, wash them in water, and number each bone in preparation for bone steaming today (the 29th) to determine whether there were any injuries.</p>

This time, the Heng brand sauce garden suffered a loss of over a hundred yuan, and the Xiankang Farm lost four hundred yuan and one thousand dimes. The other two hundred yuan belonged to the Yuanshun Oil Company and the Xiejiabao Dayou Heng Native Products Store.

When the bandits threatened and questioned the boat owner Hong Toumao and the hired worker Shui Jin, Shui Jin, in a panic, mistakenly handed over a burlap sack containing one hundred yuan each from the Dayou Heng and Yuanshun companies, as well as scattered silver dollars from various merchants, thus escaping danger.

<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Record of the Sensational Bone-Robbing Case in the County: The bone-robbing case that has attracted attention throughout the county was publicly tried by Section Chief Yu at the county government on the 20th. The audience from all walks of life was extremely crowded. The first to be interrogated was the sorcerer Hu Youzhi, who claimed to be 107 years old, born in the fifth year of the Daoguang reign. He served as a mid-level military officer in the former Qing Dynasty. Later, he crossed the East Sea and was taught the art of immortality and healing by a celestial being. He returned to China and treated many people in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Wuhu, and Chaohu. He repeatedly denied any involvement in the bone-robbing case. Then, the son-in-law of Dan Guo, Zu Muheng, testified that the sorcerer's magic was profound and he had many disciples in major ports such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan. He claimed to be unaware of the details of the bone-robbing, kidney-cutting, and breast-cutting. The sorcerer was temporarily detained, and Zu and Dan Guo were placed under guard. At the same time, Section Chief Jin of the Public Security Bureau interrogated Dan Shuzhang, the second daughter of Dan Guo, at the Hong residence. She testified that her mother had invited the old Daoist to treat her when she was young, so she knew him. She was allowed to reside there for this reason. As for the letter from Cai, a woman from Chaoxian County, saying that she was suffering in front of her master's bed, she had been classmates with her at the Chaoxian Christian Girls' School, and her words referred to being disciplined by the principal. There was no concrete evidence. However, the 46th Division, considering the seriousness of the case, took the sorcerer to the military court that night for a secret interrogation to clarify the truth. At 2 PM, various public organizations held a joint meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. Someone reported that they had inquired with a maid of the Dan family, who said that the old Daoist had many female disciples who had been accepted, called the Eight Trigram Furnace. Those who attained enlightenment would be able to escape disaster in the years of the Rooster and Monkey, when the heavens and earth would be turned upside down. However, he had recently hired craftsmen to make many axes and saws, and it was not known what they were for. Those present at the meeting believed that the case had many suspicious points and must be related to the bone-robbing case. They decided to elect representatives such as Li Taoran and Yang Licuo to petition the division headquarters and county government to reinvestigate the case to reassure the public.</p>

<h3>Ai Qun Normal School Guidance Committee</h3>
<p>▲ Discusses Training Guidelines</p>
<p>In order to improve the facilities and ensure the effectiveness of the training in the high school department of Ai Qun Girls' Middle School, the Ai Qun Normal School Guidance Committee was established. Nine people, including Liao Maoru, Wang Diancun, Huang Renzhi, Shen Youqian, Yang Weiyu, Jia Jiying, Jiang Wenyu, Lu Buqing, and Pan Yangyao, were invited to serve as guidance committee members. They held a meeting at the school's junior high school department on Penglai Road the other day, and Jia Jiying was elected as the standing committee member. Detailed plans were made for the training guidelines, curriculum development, and internship arrangements. The allocation of the high school building on Xieqiao was also discussed.

<h3>Modern Middle School Board of Directors Established</h3>
<p>Modern Middle School's request to establish a board of directors had already been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau, as previously reported in this newspaper. It has now been learned that the founders of the school invited the directors to attend the inaugural meeting at the Pacific Western Restaurant yesterday (the 25th). More than twenty people attended, including Ye Fawu, Yu Gai, Zhang Yi, Chen Qimin, and Yi Peiji (represented by Yu Qianshan). The meeting was chaired by Wu Zhongbo, one of the founders, who delivered an opening speech. Then, the meeting officially began. The charter was adopted, and Chen Qimin was elected as chairman of the board and Ye Fawu as principal. Finally, the founders and directors delivered speeches, discussing the improvement of modern education at length. The meeting lasted for more than two hours and ended on a joyful note.</p>
<h3>Translation of Famous Works</h3>
<p>Recently, Shi Youzhong, Wang Shixian, and several other alumni of Yenching University and Shanghai University, in view of the recent upsurge in domestic academic activities and the new spirit of the Chinese people in praising Western masterpieces, invited comrades to organize a translation group in Shanghai, specializing in introducing the works of authoritative authors in Europe and the United States to meet the needs of the Chinese people. The group has mostly completed the translation of two books: one is Montague's Ways of Knowing, which is the only systematic famous work on philosophical methodology in the last ten years, aiming to separate methodology from the confusion of cosmology and give it a clear outline. The content is divided into two parts and a dialogue, with a total of more than 200,000 words. The other is Dickinson's International Anarchy. People of the Dickinson family all know that he is the authoritative person in modern international studies. The content of this book describes the historical materials that caused the European War in 1914 and reveals the inside story of the secret diplomacy of various countries before the war. Dickinson's views are fair, and it is a must-read for those who study modern world diplomatic history. This book also has more than 200,000 words.</p>

<p>The Yangshupu Hujiang Affiliated High School basketball team is a strong force that has risen to prominence in the city.

Taking advantage of the summer vacation, the team decided to tour Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places to connect with others and improve their skills. They have renamed themselves the Yangshupu Basketball Team and are heading south on the President Jefferson this morning.

<h3>Charity Match Before Trip to Java: Sino-Portuguese Team Decisively Defeats Navy</h3>
<p>—Result: Seven to One—</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch, July 20th. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company is raising funds to provide relief for the flooding in the Three Rivers region. They invited the South China Athletic Association's touring football team to play a charity football match against the Hong Kong Navy football team. The proceeds from the ticket sales will be used for disaster relief. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the two teams competed at the Sister Islands Stadium. A large crowd attended. The South China team won decisively with a score of seven to one. The starting lineups for both teams were as follows:</p>
<p>▲South China Team Lineup</p>
<p>Zhou Xiyan, Li Ning, Feng Yunyou, Chen Zhenhe, Lin Yuying, Li Guozhao</p>
<p>Chen Guanghui, Sun Jinshun, Da Gao Shannu, Chen Jiaqiu, Xiao Gao Shannu</p>
<p>▲British Navy Team Lineup</p>
<p>Luo Weizhi, Nu Bili, Jia Da, Ge Da Li, Bao Liedun, Wei Luson</p>
<p>Ba Lanchi, Luo Chen, Wei Yi, Shan Te, Yun Chen</p>
<p>The Navy's lineup today was not significantly different from their lineup in the previous week's game against the Guangdong Navy. The Sino-Portuguese South China touring team fielded their best players. The Navy conceded four goals in the first half and one goal to three in the second half. The result was a decisive defeat of seven to one. Da Gao Shannu was the standout player of the day. Less than five minutes into the game, he capitalized on a clever cross from Sun Jinshun to score the first goal. Five minutes later, Chen Jiaqiu scored again. After twenty minutes of intense play, Chen scored another goal. After a kickoff from midfield, Chen Guangyao seized an opportunity to pass into the center, and Gao scored his fourth goal within a minute. After the break, Sun Jinshun received the ball in midfield and dribbled to a good position before passing it to Da Gao Shannu. Gao advanced on a one-on-one, and Luo Weizhi rushed out of the goal, but Gao easily dribbled past him and gently kicked the ball into the net. Soon after, Chen Guangyao received the ball and passed it to Sun Jinshun. Sun crossed, and Gao Shannu scored the sixth goal. The seventh goal was scored by Sun Jinshun, making it seven to zero. Unexpectedly, the Navy's left-back Luo Chen managed to break the shutout in the final ten minutes. As a result, the South China team won by a score of seven to one. After the match, Luo Xushi presented the awards: a silver cup to each team and a fountain pen to each player. He praised all the players for their enthusiasm for charity and gave three cheers before the crowd dispersed.</p>
<h3>Approval for Registration of the Chinese Athletic Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Athletic Association, located at Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession of this city, has been established for many years. It has spared no effort in promoting national martial arts and various sports. It had previously submitted an application for registration to the education bureaus of both cities. Recently, Instruction No. 799 from the Education Bureau was received, which stated: "We acknowledge receipt of Instruction No. 8919 from the Municipal Government, which included the Ministry of Education's Opinion No. 889 stating that, in accordance with Opinion No. 1018 from your Municipal Government approved last November, the Shanghai Chinese Athletic Association's registration has been approved based on the Education Bureau's report. The original documents are attached for your record." It was approved that the Shanghai Chinese Athletic Association is an academic organization and should be registered. This instruction is issued to the association for their information. It is heard that the association, after receiving the instruction, will prepare for a celebration and solicit commemorative members.</p>
<h3>National Games Rules Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The rules for all events of the National Games, such as the pentathlon, track and field, races, men's and women's volleyball, football, tennis, men's and women's basketball, swimming, and national martial arts, have been printed. In addition to being distributed to various organizations, they have also been entrusted to the Lao Ximen Standard Sports Equipment Company for sale.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>A New Aspect of Chinese Education</h3>
<p>—Central Political School (3) Ye Xing</p>
<p>Expenses such as laundry and haircuts are also provided by the school. Unless there are special circumstances and with the approval of the team leader, students are not allowed to ask for leave to go out. The atmosphere of seeking knowledge at the school is unusually strong. There are no absences from classes, and there are no disciplinary problems. Moreover, the seats in the library and self-study rooms are always full. Students are always respectful to their teachers, whether on or off campus, raising their right hand to their hat brim in a salute. When a teacher enters the classroom, a student will call out the command "Attention!" and the entire class will stand up straight. Therefore, new instructors, especially those who have taught at universities nearby, are often surprised when they step into the classroom. Visitors all say that the school has a culture of respecting teachers. The examinations for students are extremely strict. If cheating or any other misconduct is discovered during an exam, the student is immediately expelled without leniency. Moreover, if a student fails several subjects in the final exams, they are also immediately expelled. Therefore, of the current third-year students, who numbered more than 413 when they first enrolled, only over 270 remain after three years. From this, one can see the strictness of the school. When the school was first established, it borrowed a portion of the old Southeast University site. Later, it moved to the old Jiangsu College of Law and Politics site in Hongzhilang. Some money was saved from the annual operating expenses and used to build four or five new-style buildings, but it is still not enough. The school has other plans, intending to find another site and use the current site to establish an affiliated senior high school or vocational school. However, this is still in the planning stages. The school's operating expenses are extremely low. With nearly 500 students, over 80 professors and lecturers, plus staff from the military training department, translation department, and library, the monthly expenditure is only over 27,000 yuan. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, said that this school is even more economical than private universities. However, the school is not at all stingy when it comes to purchasing books and equipment. For example, when the school implemented group studies this year, it specifically allocated 20,000 yuan for purchasing books and equipment. The annual expenditure on books and equipment accounts for 15% of the annual operating expenses, amounting to over 30,000 yuan. Therefore, although the library's collection cannot be considered large compared to libraries with collections in all disciplines, it is a relatively well-equipped specialized library. After visiting China, Harvard University Professor Holcomb wrote a book called "The Chinese Revolution," in which he described the library as an "Excellent Library of Political Science," which is a very accurate assessment.</p>
<p>Because the school aims to cultivate talents with practical specialized knowledge and skills, it emphasizes both theory and practice. Since it is located in the capital, there are many opportunities for internships. For example, the Central Party Headquarters, the Nanjing Municipal Government, and other ministries and commissions often recruit students from the school to help when they need to conduct statistics. In this way, the students can gain a lot of practical experience. For the rural administration group's internship, the school not only established a farm but also assigned students to various farms during the summer vacation for practical experience. The school also specifically designated one semester, the first semester of the fourth year, as the internship period. The National Government assigns each student to various counties and cities for internships, so that they have adequate practical experience in preparation for their future work assignments, so that they will not be at a loss and overwhelmed when the time comes. After a semester of internship, the students are recalled to the school for another semester of study. They are required to discuss the difficulties and problems they encountered during their internships and write a thesis. Only after the thesis has been reviewed and approved are they allowed to graduate. This is also a special feature of the school's educational implementation. Because the school has limited funds and is extremely economical in its spending, it adopts a cautious and steady approach to future development. It first focuses on enriching the internal curriculum and facilities and then seeks to expand on a comparable scale. Once the school site issue is resolved, it will not be difficult to establish specialized classes such as statistics and accounting. The enrollment quota will be slightly increased to 300 students in the second half of the year, and an education department will be added. At the same time, two groups will be established: educational administration and rural education. The school is actively increasing its reference materials and continuing to hire professors. If this continues, the school will definitely reach a considerable scale in five years. This school is not only an important educational institution for cultivating practical political talents but also the best way out for poor and ambitious young people. No wonder it has attracted the attention of the entire country. (End)</p>

<h3>Good News for National Flood Relief</h3>
<p>▲Organization of the Shanghai Relief Committee for Provincial Flood Relief</p>
<p>Continuous heavy rains have persisted for almost two weeks, and the flood situation in various provinces is critical. Last night, Chairman Xu Shiying and committee members Wang Yiting and Li Jin of the Relief Committee convened a meeting at Jue Lin, inviting philanthropists from all walks of life in Shanghai to discuss emergency flood relief measures. More than thirty people attended, including Lin Kanghou, Xie Hengchuang, Yu Qiaqing, Xiang Maosong, Wen Lanting, and Hong Yanbin. It was decided on the spot to organize the Shanghai Relief Committee for Provincial Flood Relief. All attendees became members of the preparatory committee, and a general assembly will be established within days. Chairman Xu went to Nanjing that evening to prepare for the Relief Committee's emergency relief work and will return to Shanghai to preside over the general assembly.</p>
<h3>Various Shipping Companies Received Yangtze River Flood Alerts Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Warehouse Piers in Various Ports Flooded</p>
<p>▲Shipping Companies Rushing to Reinforce Day and Night</p>
<p>▲Cargo Transport Disrupted in Central Anhui</p>
<p>▲Warehouses Submerged in Water Yesterday, shipping companies along the Yangtze River in this city received urgent telegrams from Hankou stating that continuous heavy rains in Hankou have caused a sudden rise in the river level. Today, the water has overflowed onto the banks, reaching within two feet of the highest warehouses. The lower warehouses are already flooded, and the damage to cargo is unprecedented. The water level is still rising. Warehouses have hired large numbers of workers to move cargo and reinforce defenses.</p>
<p>▲Urging Customers to Pick Up Goods The telegram to Shanghai was followed by another urgent telegram, stating that the Yangtze River level had reached 49 feet 5 inches, an unprecedented record high for the Yangtze River. The entire area from the First Pier is submerged. Shipping companies are working day and night to move cargo, but there is a backlog of stored goods and insufficient warehouse space. If the situation continues, the damage from the water will increase, making it more difficult to move cargo, and the losses will be even greater. It is requested that Shanghai Yangtze River shipping companies jointly notify customers with goods stored in Hankou to pick up their goods within a limited time, otherwise the shipping companies will not be responsible.</p>
<p>▲Customers Responsible for Water Damage After receiving this warning yesterday, shipping companies notified customers and telegraphed their branches and warehouse managers in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Anqing, Wuxue, Jiujiang, and other ports along the Yangtze River to inform their customers that severe flooding has occurred in various ports along the Yangtze River. Most warehouses are submerged in water. This is a natural disaster that cannot be resisted by human effort. The companies are not responsible for any damage to goods caused by water. The cost of moving and transferring goods will be borne by the cargo owners.</p>
<p>▲Yangtze River Cargo Transport Disrupted The flooding is also very severe in southern and northern Anhui. All embanked fields are submerged. Recently, the import and export of goods to and from ports such as Wuhu, Datong, and Anqing have been disrupted by the flooding. Customers transporting goods to the interior of Anhui have stopped transporting due to disrupted transportation. The amount of cargo transported up and down the river by the Six Companies' Yangtze River steamers at Wuhu and Anqing has been greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>All Small Steamers in Shanghai Suspended</h3>
<p>▲Severe Flooding in Jiangsu; Severe Drought in Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>Severe flooding has struck Jiangsu Province, completely disrupting inland waterway traffic and inundating vast swathes of farmland. Meanwhile, in Ningbo, just hundreds of miles away, an unusually severe drought has persisted for over a month, threatening to cause a famine. The latest news received yesterday is detailed below.</p>
<p>▲Small Steamers to Suzhou and Hangzhou Also Suspended From the 6th and 7th days of this month until now, continuous heavy rain has been falling. Over thirty routes of small steamers on the inland waterways of Jiangsu Province have been completely suspended. From the Shanghai side, only two lines, the Shanghai-Suzhou and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, were barely able to operate. However, since the continued heavy rains began on the 25th, the water level in the interior has risen even further. In Suzhou, the river water has submerged the banks, reaching over a foot deep, turning the waterways into a vast expanse of water. Yesterday, shipping companies in Shanghai suspended the Suzhou line. Initially, the Hangzhou line was still considered passable, but now the water level is so high that it has reached the level of the bridge arches. Even small civilian boats cannot pass, so it has also been suspended.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai-Jiaozhou Line Partially Suspended Of all the small steamers on the inland waterways of Shanghai, only the Shanghai-Jiaozhou line is still barely operating. However, yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau received reports that while the water level in Zhujiajiao was not too high, in Qingpu, the rivers have flooded the farmland, making it impossible to distinguish the waterways from the land. According to the Bureau's proposal, the Shanghai-Jiaozhou line should be suspended. However, due to the requests of local merchants and residents to prevent the disruption of transportation, the Bureau has instructed the captain of the Shanghai-Jiaozhou steamer that, upon arriving at Qingpu, the driver should not drive the boat but only allow it to float with the current to avoid damaging the embankments. Therefore, while this route is still operating, it is effectively in a state of partial suspension.</p>
<p>▲Severe Drought in Eastern Zhejiang Yesterday, a friend from Ningbo reported that Ningbo has not received a single drop of rain since the beginning of summer, which has been almost a month. The region is facing a severe drought. Zhenhai, Fenghua, and other places have also been without rain for over a month. Rivers are drying up, and people are finding it difficult to find drinking water. In Zhenhai, the early rice crop is almost ripe and ready for harvest, but many plants have already withered and died due to the drought. The late rice crop is also about to be planted, but it will likely wither and die due to the drought. If it does not rain for another week, there will be no hope for the late rice crop, and the region is very concerned about becoming a drought-stricken area.</p>
<h3>Preparations for a Citizens' Assembly</h3>
<p>▲Suppress Bandits, Punish Traitors, Oppose Japan, Aid Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Various trade associations, labor unions, and other civil groups in this city, recognizing the dual threat of internal strife and foreign aggression, have jointly launched a citizens' assembly to suppress bandits, punish traitors, oppose Japan, and aid overseas Chinese in order to galvanize the nation towards a common goal. This initiative has been approved by the city party headquarters, and a preparatory committee appointed by the initiating groups is actively preparing for the assembly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Preparatory Meeting The preparatory committee held a preparatory meeting yesterday morning at the City Chamber of Commerce. More than twenty preparatory committee members attended, including Wang Wenhua, Zhou Xuexiang, Chen Peide, Li Yongxiang, Gong Yuting, Tang Junsheng, Zhu Xuefan, Wang Zhuping, Weng Ruifu, Feng Yixian, Chen Yafu, Lin Kecong, Xie Zhongle, Luo Qinghua, Ma Shaoquan, Shao Baoxing, Hu Hongxiang, and Ye Jiaxing. Wang Wenhua chaired the meeting. After the formalities, the chairman reported on the progress of the citizens' assembly. The following motions were discussed and approved: (1) A motion to submit a report to the city party headquarters for record was approved. (2) A motion to request the city party headquarters and the city social bureau to jointly issue a notice ordering a half-day work stoppage with full pay for the entire city on the afternoon of the 30th was approved. (3) A motion to request the public security bureau and the garrison command to send police to maintain order was approved. (4) A motion to publish a notice in the newspaper to inform all citizens to participate was approved. (5) A motion to request the health bureau to send a medical team to provide first aid on site was approved.</p>
<p>▲Appointment of Officers The officers of the assembly were also appointed by the preparatory committee and are listed below: (1) Wang Wenhua, Li Yongxiang, Zhu Xuefan, Gong Yuting, Wang Xiaolai, Zheng Chengqing, Hu Shuhua, Lin Kecong, and Chen Yafu were appointed as the presidium of the assembly. (2) Yan Esheng and Zhao Shusheng were appointed as secretaries of the assembly. (3) Chen Peide was appointed as the general commander for the entire city, Zhou Xuexiang as the general inspector for the entire city, Ye Jiaxing as the general commander for the business community, Xie Zhongle as the deputy commander, Ma Shaoquan as the general inspector for the chamber of commerce, Shao Baoxing as the deputy inspector, Wang Changyuan as the general commander for Zhabei, Wang Yongliang as the deputy commander, Liu Xinquan as the general inspector for Zhabei, Tu Heyun as the deputy inspector, Tang Junsheng as the general commander for the Nanshi district, Long Peiyun as the deputy commander, Zhang Yaoming as the general commander for the Nanshi District, Zhang Linhua as the deputy commander, Ge Yunting as the general inspector for Pudong, Wang Ajin as the deputy inspector, Hu Fengxiang as the master of ceremonies for the assembly, and Qian Hongcai as the commander of the maintenance team.</p>
<p>▲Time and Location The time and location of the assembly were determined by the preparatory committee. The meeting will be held at 3:00 PM on the 30th at the Public Sports Field. In case of rain, it will be moved to the New Stage.</p>
<p>▲Request for Filing The association submitted a report to the citizens' training committee yesterday, stating that it was requesting approval to hold the Shanghai Citizens' Assembly to Suppress Bandits, Punish Traitors, Oppose Japan, and Aid Overseas Chinese. Recognizing that the nation is facing both internal strife and foreign aggression, and that the people of the entire country urgently need to suppress the Red bandits, punish Shi Yousan, aid overseas Chinese, and resolutely carry out an economic boycott against Japan, the association plans to convene a city-wide citizens' assembly to serve as a backing for the government. The association has decided to hold the assembly at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of July 30th at the Public Sports Field in Nanshi. It earnestly requests that the committee approve the filing and send representatives to attend and guide the assembly. It also requests that the committee and the social bureau jointly issue a notice ordering all institutions, organizations, factories, etc. (except for public transportation) to take a half-day holiday with full pay on that afternoon in order to participate. This would be a convenience for the public. This report is respectfully submitted to the Citizens' Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>▲Chamber of Commerce Notice The City Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to all businesses stating that it had received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Assembly to Suppress Bandits, Punish Traitors, Oppose Japan, and Aid Overseas Chinese, stating that it had scheduled a citizens' assembly for 3:00 PM on the afternoon of July 30th at the Public Sports Field in Nanshi and requesting that all trade associations notify their affiliated businesses to enthusiastically participate. At this time of internal strife and foreign aggression, the holding of this assembly is to awaken the people to strive for a common goal. It is hoped that the business community of this city will enthusiastically participate at that time.</p>
<h3>This City Begins Fundraising for a Grain Storage Fund</h3>
<p>▲Target Amount: One Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Committee, recognizing that the food supply for the citizens of this city is often in a precarious and unstable state, has noted that while famine should be reported immediately, even continuous rain can cause rice prices in this city to rise. After careful investigation, the committee found that this is because the city has a population of over three million, the majority of whom are of modest means and rely on other ports for their rice supply. Even slight shortages or difficulties in transporting goods can cause rice prices to rise sharply, making it impossible for the poor to have a stable livelihood. Even in the event of a famine, attempts to regulate the market and prevent food shortages are hampered by a lack of funds, making it impossible to take effective action, increasing losses during temporary interventions. Therefore, the committee proposed raising a grain storage fund in advance, so that funds would be available and all disaster preparedness measures could be implemented in due course. The committee submitted a request to the Social Bureau, which in turn submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. The committee then appointed members and established the Shanghai Grain Storage Fund Raising Committee in October of last year, deciding to raise one million yuan by forming teams to raise money together. It has been heard that the recent heavy rains have caused disasters, making the need to store grain even more urgent. Therefore, the committee has now begun forming teams to raise funds.</p>
<p>▲Selection of Team Leaders The team leaders are Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Hu Jiameng, Wu Zhenxiu, Xu Jiqing, Gu Xinyi, Yuan Ludeng, Yao Zirang, Liu Hongsheng, Shen Lianfang, Yao Mulian, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Zixiang, Lu Wenshao, Lao Jingxiu, Zhu Wenqi, Sun Baorong, Pan Gongzhan, Tang Naikang, Zhu Hao, Gu Shiguang, Chen Yafu, Chen Tianxi, Pan Hongding, Tang Chengzong, Zhu Zonglu, Yan Enzuo, and Hong Lanxiang. The team leaders will introduce local enthusiasts to serve as team members in order to achieve the fundraising goal as soon as possible. It has been heard that Xu Shengchan, Zhu Yinjiang, Lu Bohong, Xu Xinliu, Li Fusheng, Chen Guangfu, Feng Bingnan, Rong Zongjing, Cai Zengji, Pei Yunqing, Tang Shoumin, and Cheng Zhusun have also been newly appointed as team leaders.</p>
<p>▲Honors for Donations The Municipal Social Bureau believes that the government should encourage and reward people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about donating. It has drafted fundraising measures, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. Article 4 states that donors, whether individuals or organizations, will be rewarded according to the "Regulations on Commending Donations for Relief Efforts" promulgated by the National Government, depending on the amount of their donations. (1) Donors of 5,000 yuan or more will have their names submitted by the committee to the mayor, who will then submit them to the National Government for an award plaque. (2) Donors of 1,000 yuan or more but less than 5,000 yuan will have their names submitted by the committee to the mayor for an award plaque. (3) Donors of 500 yuan or more but less than 1,000 yuan will have their names submitted by the committee to the Municipal Social Bureau for an award plaque. Those who donate more than five times the amount listed in Article 4 will also be eligible for a comparable award.</p>
<p>▲Fundraising Notice The committee issued a fundraising notice yesterday, which stated that "It has been taught in the classics that three years of farming must have one year of food storage, and nine years of farming must have three years of food storage. Therefore, even in the event of famine or flood, the people will not starve. Zhou officials also established 'residual grain officers' to provide relief to the people with the grain reserves of villages and neighborhoods, and to prepare for famine with the grain reserves of counties and capitals. That is how careful they were about storing grain. Our late Premier Sun Yat-sen also stated that only with the construction of charitable granaries and the storage of three years of surplus grain can the food problem of the people be truly resolved. Abundance and scarcity are not determined by human power, and the food problem of the people is the core of the people's livelihood. Therefore, grain storage is highly valued in both ancient and modern times. This city has a population of over three million and is located at a strategic point on land and sea routes, so there is no fear of lacking food. However, because the city does not produce rice, the population is large, and most people are of modest means, the effects of rice shortages and high prices are quickly felt. In the event of famine, regulating the food supply temporarily can only provide limited relief. As the saying goes, 'Only with preparation can there be no fear.' After the food shortages of 1929 and 1930, people in society have become aware that disaster preparedness efforts cannot be delayed. Therefore, the government has established this committee, bringing together local gentry and merchants, to plan for the construction of grain storage facilities and to raise a fund of one million yuan. Moreover, the recent continuous rains have caused disasters, and the fields in the rice-producing areas throughout the country have been flooded, dashing hopes for the autumn harvest. The panic to come is not yet over. The regulation and distribution of the food supply should be planned in advance so that we are not digging a well only when we are thirsty. The committee has decided to begin forming teams to solicit donations immediately. There are many enthusiastic philanthropists in Shanghai who are happy to do good. As this matter concerns the livelihood of all citizens, we urge you to donate generously and support the creation of a grain storage foundation to prevent food shortages. We respectfully pray for the blessing of the poor. Sincerely, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Hu Mengjia, Wu Zhenxiu, Xu Jiqing, Gu Xinyi, Yuan Ludeng, Yao Zirang, Liu Hongsheng, Shen Lianfang, Yao Muyun, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Zixiang, Lu Wenshao, Lao Jingxiu, Zhu Wenqi, Sun Baorong, Pan Gongzhan, Tang Naikang, Zhu Hao, Gu Shiguang, Chen Yafu, Chen Tianxi, Pan Hongding, Tang Chengzong, Zhu Zonglu, Yan Enzuo, and Hong Lanxiang, team leaders of the Shanghai Grain Storage Fund Raising Committee. Association address: Social Bureau, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi."</p>

After that, a time limit will be set, and each industry guild should raise funds to establish factories and manufacture them themselves in order to gradually reduce them year by year.

<p>▲ Customs Brokerage Inspection Team. The Customs Brokerage Union convened a general meeting of members at 3 p.m. yesterday, with more than 200 members present. Chairman Su Houxin reported on the progress of the anti-Japanese movement and resolved: (1) Join the Overseas Chinese Aid Support Association and proceed in unison.

(D) If any members undermine the patriotic movement, request the higher authorities to expel them from membership and permanently exclude them from serving in the customs brokerage industry.

<p>▲ Ban Japanese Merchants from Customs Declaration. The Customs Brokerage Union sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association yesterday, stating: Respectfully informing you, before the previous case is completed, the overseas Chinese of the Three Han continue to suffer the tragic massacre of thousands of compatriots and the loss of nearly tens of millions of properties. This great catastrophe is unprecedented. The Japanese conspiracy is as poisonous as a viper. We deeply admire their loyalty and righteousness. The union has already resolved at the general meeting on the 26th to follow the association and unanimously engage in anti-Japanese work. Recently, it has joined forces with the Transportation and Customs Brokerage Guild to proceed together. Starting from today, we will implement a refusal to load Japanese goods and automatically organize an inspection team to carry out fundamental actions effectively, determined not to let good merchants escape the law. Therefore, we specially send this letter to the association for filing in order to unify efforts. Furthermore, we request that the higher authorities submit on our behalf and forward to the central government, please the National Government to order the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to send a telegram to the customs of all provinces and cities, strictly prohibiting Japanese merchants from directly declaring and exporting to customs in order to avoid leaks and save national rights.</p>
<p>▲ Changshu Sends a Telegram in Response. The association received a telegram from Changshu yesterday, stating: To the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association: In the Han Wan Incident, the imperialists disregarded our national rights and cruelly murdered our compatriots. Their insidious brutality has reached its extreme. People are the knives and boards, and we are the fish and meat. The survival of the nation is in imminent danger. Our Shanghai compatriots have risen up courageously and pioneered the anti-Japanese movement, deeply committed to the spirit of perseverance and bravery, engaging in a permanent economic severance with Japan. Upon hearing this, who would not be moved? Japan has always regarded our country as the target of its economic invasion. If we can rigorously implement severance, it will be enough to control its fate. Shanghai is the largest commercial center in the country. Once it is effectively implemented, it will definitely be effective. National revival in the face of adversity is the responsibility of everyone. We should always persevere and struggle to the end. In addition to sending telegrams to various counties for unanimous implementation, we specially send this telegram to express our encouragement. Changshu County Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Congress, Chairman Shen Zuguang, and others signed.</p>
<p>▲ County Anti-Japanese Association Established Yesterday</p>
<p>All sectors of Shanghai County held an Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Congress at Beiqiao at 10 a.m. yesterday. Various county agencies, organizations, and people from all walks of life enthusiastically participated, numbering more than a thousand people. The presidium consisted of Peng Liren, Jiang Yanqiu, Shi She, Yang Fulin, and Wu Jingqing. Peng Liren chaired the meeting, Yang Zhuoyun served as the master of ceremonies, and Chen Guoan recorded the minutes. The meeting was held as scheduled. First, the chairman reported on the details of the Wanbaoshan incident, followed by speeches by Shi She, Yang Fulin, Ge Xiusheng, and others. Zhang Yi, Chen Guoan, and others gave costumed speeches. Finally, proposals were passed, slogans were shouted, and photos were taken before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ Proposals Passed by the Congress (1) Proposal to organize a county-wide anti-Japanese committee. Resolved: First organize a preparatory committee and immediately appoint Peng Liren, Jiang Yanqiu, Shi She, Wu Jingqing, Zhang Yi, Zhang Jingling, Yang Fulin, and seven others as preparatory committee members, with Peng Liren as the convener of the preparatory committee. (2) Decide on matters to be prepared during the preparatory period. Resolved: Complete the preparation within one week. (3) Submit a petition to the central government to sever diplomatic relations with Japan. Resolved: Passed. (4) Submit a petition to the central government to punish Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting. Resolved: Passed.</p>
<p>▲ Advocates for Severing Diplomatic Relations with Japan. The association submitted a petition to the central government yesterday, stating: A petition for declaring the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan. The Wanbaoshan incident originated from a very minor cause, but the Japanese used it to expand the dispute, incite anti-Chinese sentiment, alienate the feelings between the Chinese and Korean nations, and destroy the foundation of the Chinese people's commerce in Korea, so as to take advantage of the fire, engulf the property of overseas Chinese merchants, and actively invade with the Manchuria-Mongolia policy. Failing to immediately destroy our Eastern Provinces, they devised a way to massacre and expel the overseas Chinese, and transplant Korean residents into our territory, so that the entire Korean Peninsula would be owned by them, in order to accommodate their surplus population and resolve their domestic panic. Their intentions are sinister, and their plans are vicious. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, they first invaded Ryukyu, then occupied Korea, finally ceded Taiwan, and then seized Jiaozhou, strongly occupying the Korean Peninsula. The shame of the Twenty-One Demands has not been erased, and the brutality of the May 30th Massacre has reappeared. The establishment of the South Manchuria Railway Company is treating us with the strategy of England destroying India. The mainland of China is gradually being eaten away. If we do not take a decisive attitude and sever relations with them, the Japanese will take an inch and want a mile. What future can we expect? The entire population of the county's Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Congress unanimously resolved to submit a petition to the central government to promptly maintain diplomacy, elaborate on measures, and declare the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan. All Chinese and Japanese overseas residents should return to their respective countries, and all assets in their locations should be confiscated. If the Japanese use this as an excuse to provoke trouble, the people of the country will swear to rise up armed and be the country's backing. Even if we resort to the final solution, we will not hesitate.</p>
<p>▲ First Preparatory Meeting. The first preparatory meeting was held at 1 p.m. Seven committee members attended, chaired by Peng Heren. After the ceremony, the report was given first, followed by discussion of the following matters: A. Designate the following organizations as committee members of the Shanghai County Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Congress: (1) County Farmers' Association (2) County Education Association (3) Minhang Chamber of Commerce (4) Third District Chamber of Commerce (5) Tangwan Chamber of Commerce (6) Sanlin Chamber of Commerce (7) Maqiao Chamber of Commerce (8) Shuimu Industry Union (9)</p>
<p>County Propaganda Committee. Each of the above organizations should nominate two representatives. B. Set a regular date to convene a general meeting of representatives of various organizations. Resolved: Set August 1st at 10 a.m. to be held at the Third District Office in Beiqiao Town. C. Recommend a preparatory director. Resolved: Recommend Comrade Yang Fulin to take the position. D. Draft the organizational outline of the Shanghai County Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee. Resolved: Recommend Comrade Zhang Yi to draft it.</p>
<p>▲ Song Business Community Scheduled Discussion</p>
<p>The Wusong Branch Office of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified shops in various industries in the Wusong District to send representatives to discuss the business tax and the issue of economic severance with Japan, stating: Respectfully informing you, according to a letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the city's business tax regulations and tax rate table have been reviewed and approved by the municipal government and filed with the Ministry of Finance. The date of implementation is imminent. Now, we specifically include the revised version of the Ministry of Finance, the city's business tax regulations, and its implementation rules and tax rate table, totaling one volume, and send it with this letter. Please inspect and collect it, and first convene the business community in the area to prepare in advance. As for the issue of economic severance with Japan, the association has long ago sent a letter to the chambers of commerce in various places, requesting them to lead the chambers of commerce and automatically form a tight organization. Since the area is within the city, it should consistently and quickly plan and proceed to avoid falling behind. We hope that you will immediately formulate automatic economic severance methods with Japan based on the situation in the area, convene the business community in the area, and discuss them together, so that you can strictly handle them according to the resolutions. On this basis, we have learned that both the business tax and economic severance with Japan are the most pressing and important tasks at present, and they are even more closely related to the interests of merchants. According to the letter from the previous year, in addition to the regulations being stored in the office, it is now scheduled to hold a meeting on the 31st of this month, i.e., Friday, at 2 p.m. in the auditorium of the Eighth District Party Headquarters, to gather and discuss the progress steps. In addition to separate letters, we correspondingly send a letter to your company requesting that you send a representative to attend on time.</p>
<h3>Two-Way Defense Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Held at Longhua Command Today</p>
<p>Since the assassination of Song occurred at the North Station, the Executive Yuan criticized the negligence of road police defenses. Furthermore, due to the frequent travel of important government officials on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, it is urgent that the military and police authorities negotiate proper defense measures to avoid the recurrence of unfortunate events. Therefore, it ordered the Capital Garrison Command, the Capital Police Department, the Songhu Garrison Command, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the road police on both lines to handle the matter jointly. The Songhu Garrison Command has now decided to convene the relevant authorities at 1 p.m. today at the Longhua Command to hold a two-way defense meeting. The Shanghai Municipal Government also received similar instructions from the Executive Yuan and had intended to convene a meeting at 2 p.m. on the 31st of this month. However, since the Longhua Command had already convened the meeting first, the meeting initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Government has reportedly been cancelled. The two pistols left behind by the assassins in the Song assassination case have now been submitted by the road police to the Garrison Command for research. However, there are still no clues in the search for the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Director Chen Rectifies Police Personnel</h3>
<p>▲ Ninety Patrol Leaders Graduated from Training Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Recruitment Class Scheduled to Begin on August 1st</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, believes that there are many incompetent people among the police personnel. In order to actively rectify this situation, he specifically established a patrol leader training class. Ninety patrol leaders have completed three months of training and graduated yesterday. They have been assigned to various districts to serve. It has also been decided to start a recruitment class on August 1st, recruiting 100 people each month, who will graduate after three months of training. Starting from January, there will be 100 new police officers, and the original patrol leaders and police officers will be gradually eliminated through assessment and training, or replaced with new police officers, in order to transform the entire city into a well-trained police force. The central area of the city will be the first to be served entirely by new police officers.</p>
<h3>Jinpu Railway Resumes Service, Joint Tickets Sold</h3>
<p>The Jinpu Railway, between the Dongge and Huqiying stations, was flooded by mountain torrents and the tracks were damaged. The water has now receded, and the Engineering Department has sent people to repair it. It was completely repaired at 28 p.m. yesterday. Through express train joint tickets, etc., are scheduled to resume today (29th) and operate as usual without obstruction. However, express trains and commuter trains are scheduled to resume on the 30th, and all routes have been notified to issue Lu joint transport passenger tickets as usual.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Sends a Telegram to Encourage Wang Zhengting</h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Wang yesterday, stating: To His Excellency Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government: Shanghai newspapers reported on the 27th that His Excellency sent a telegram to President Jiang, requesting to resign due to negotiations with Japan. President Jiang replied with a telegram of consolation. If this is true, I believe that His Excellency's actions are wrong. Those who have responsibility should not refuse to shoulder it, should act courageously, and should reverse the chaos and restore order. This is what makes a hero. Consider Germany after the European War, facing internal and external troubles. How hard did Stresemann work? Recently, due to economic panic, Curtis went to England twice and to France once. Although some people in the country advocated distrust, he never abandoned his responsibility to the country and the people under any pretext. What was his spirit of advancement like? Also, consider President Jiang's command in the hot summer of Liuzhou last year and his suppression of the communists in the scorching heat of Jiangxi this year. The degree of severity of those who slander and blame, and who engage in military disturbances, is comparable to that of those who criticize His Excellency. If President Jiang did not consider the survival of the nation and the people, how comfortable would it be to leave far away? However, because of his heavy sense of responsibility, he could not bear to see Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles abandoned in one day. He relied on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great fearless spirit and confidence to finally quell the Yan-Feng rebellion and gradually eliminate the communists. Since His Excellency has devoted himself to the party and the country, he should share the difficulties of the times, use his conscience to serve the country, and not worry about slander. It is absolutely impossible to leave office at this time. The responsible people will definitely be your backing. Furthermore, I have never feared opposition when handling official affairs, and I even welcome it, because I can use it to increase courage, clarify right and wrong, and prove who is responsible and who is not. As the saying goes, "It is better to have one frank scholar than a thousand yes-men." I hope you will understand this and respectfully present this telegram. I pray for your consideration. Yu Qiaqing respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Soong Ziwen Escorts Mother's Coffin to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Expected to Arrive at Port at 6:30 This Morning</p>
<p>Soong's mother, Madam Ni, passed away at her villa in Qingdao.

<h3>Foreign Minister Returns Birthday Gift Money</h3>
<p>▲ Cancels Fundraising for School Initiative</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting went to Mogan Mountain to avoid birthday celebrations. However, Wang's personal friends still planned to raise funds to start a school as a lasting memorial.

He personally requested his friends to cancel this initiative and returned all the collected funds.</p>
<h3>Feiss Interferes with the Anti-Japanese Movement</h3>
<p>▲ Said to Have Ordered the Arrest of Inspectors in the Concession</p>
<p>Recently, the anti-Japanese movement has been sparked by the Korean Incident. Since the work began, the import of Japanese goods into the port has almost been completely cut off. Japanese merchants are very panicked and are trying various ways to undermine it. According to a report in the Shanghai Evening Post yesterday, Mr. Feiss, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement, has instructed the public concession police to arrest anyone in the public concession who inspects Japanese goods and detains them. Therefore, this anti-Japanese movement may suffer a major blow as a result.</p>
<h3>Commander Xiong Notifies Mayor Zhang of Victory by Telegram</h3>

<h3>Some Tea Merchants Talked with the Commodity Inspection Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Zou Bingwen and Others Explained in Detail</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau received the order from Minister Qin and began inspecting tea leaves, foreign merchants and tea warehouses in Shanghai initially had many difficulties. However, after the bureau explained in detail, they all unanimously obeyed and inspected according to the legal procedures. Tea merchants from Qimen and Wuyuan, recently because of their own interests, inevitably have many doubts. A few days ago, they invited some tea merchants to discuss at the foreign tea merchant guild. Yesterday, they also appointed Hu Fuchao, He Chongjie, Wang Jinyi, Hu Songpu, eight or nine people, accompanied by Chen Zhaoshou, to go to the Commodity Inspection Bureau to talk. Zheng Erzang stated first that he could fully understand the government's inspection policy. However, they had questions about the foreign merchants' return of tea, the tea sampling, and the prohibition of exporting colored tea in the inspection rules.

Afterwards, Chief Ye and Technical Officer Wu accompanied them to visit various facilities of the tea inspection room of the bureau before they dispersed.</p>
<h3>The National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Hires Pan Xulun as an Advisor</h3>
<p>Pan Xulun, a certified public accountant and director of the Lixin Accounting Firm in the port, originally served as an accountant in the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. As his business in Shanghai became increasingly busy, he had no time to take care of both, so he resigned. It has been reported in the previous newspapers. It is now known that the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has hired Pan as an advisor because of his rich knowledge and experience in accounting and that the government's accounting improvement matters still need Pan's assistance. Therefore, Pan can still contribute his opinions to the national accounting policy at any time.</p>
<h3>Fresh Suzhou Fragrant Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hong Sheng Rice Shop at Hongmiao Alley, considering the muggy and hot weather this summer, finds it difficult to find suitable food for the palate. Only fragrant pearl rice porridge is nutritious, appetizing, and good for the lungs. Therefore, they have specially sent staff to Suzhou to purchase rice and bring it to Shanghai to meet market demand. The top-grade white rice sold in their shop is also very reasonably priced. As a result, customers flock to purchase it, creating a scene reminiscent of a bustling road in Shanyin.</p>

<h3>Record of Interrogation of Kidnappers in the Ye Zengshou Case</h3>
<p>▲Ye himself unwilling to appear in court</p>
<p>▲Xu and Chen detained for further interrogation</p>
<p>Ye Zengshou, the owner of Zhongfu Import and Export Company, was kidnapped on the morning of the 4th of this month while traveling by his private car No. 4529 with his third concubine, Ms. Fan, from Yulin Road, Yangshupu, to North Sichuan Road for eye treatment. After ten days, he was finally rescued and returned safely. The Public Concession Police have now arrested two kidnappers and one suspect in connection with the case. The following is a description of the events from Ye's kidnapping to the capture of the kidnappers and the court interrogation:</p>
<p>▲The Kidnapping Circumstances: On the morning of July 4th at 10:00 AM, Ye, accompanied by his third concubine, departed from their residence in car No. 4529 and instructed the driver to proceed to a certain ophthalmologist's clinic on North Sichuan Road for treatment. However, as the car proceeded along Yulin Road, its speed suddenly slowed down at a corner. At that moment, three kidnappers jumped onto the car from the roadside. One kidnapper, holding a handgun, sat next to Ye, while the other two sat next to the driver. Ye and the others did not dare to make a sound, and the car came to a halt. Subsequently, the kidnapper sitting at the front of the car manipulated the engine, and the car sped away, disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>▲Police Witness: At that time, Li Yingbao, the police officer No. 1563 of the Guangde Pawnshop at No. 18 Yulin Road, witnessed the kidnappers' actions. However, as neither the kidnapped person nor his driver showed any signs of seeking help or resistance, he did not suspect a kidnapping. According to the officer's statement, if he had known it was a kidnapping at the time, he could have easily shot them, and Ye would not have been kidnapped.</p>
<p>▲Location of Captivity: On the same day, after succeeding in their plan, the kidnappers drove the car to Xiangyin Road in Jiangwan, abandoned Ye's concubine and took Ye into a bungalow at No. 26, where they confined him. Three kidnappers were assigned to guard him in shifts, never leaving his side. They then sent a letter to Ye's family, demanding 10,000 yuan for ransom. It was not until the 13th, when the kidnappers obtained the money, that they released Ye.</p>
<p>▲Arrest of Three Individuals: Recently, Wang Xichang, a detective of the Public Concession Police, learned that Xu A'gen and Xu Rongfu, both from Ningbo, were hiding at No. 160 North Shanxi Road and were kidnappers. He secretly arrested them all together. Upon investigation, it was discovered that A'gen was indeed one of the kidnappers of Ye, while Rongfu appeared to be unrelated. A'gen also confessed that the bungalow where Ye was held captive was rented by Chen Xingjiang, a local resident living at No. 32 Xiangyin Road. Therefore, Chen was subsequently arrested the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>▲Principal Absent: Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Ge Zhitan held a trial. However, Ye Zengshou did not appear in court. According to Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, the police had sent for Ye, but his family claimed that Ye was still in Hangzhou and had not returned. The police, needing to understand everything, specifically sent a letter to the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, requesting Ye to return to the bureau promptly. However, the bureau replied that Ye had already come to Shanghai and they did not know why he was unwilling to appear in court. However, according to the confessions of the defendants obtained by the police, there were many inconsistencies with the reports from the victim's family. Therefore, it was necessary for Ye to appear in court to clarify the case. Currently, aside from Xu Rongfu, who was found to be unrelated and should be released immediately, the remaining two individuals should be prosecuted under the law for punishing kidnappers, and the hearing should be postponed to allow Ye to appear in court for further questioning.</p>
<p>▲Negotiations by Uncle: Subsequently, Chinese and Western detectives reported the arrest of the defendants and the investigation process. When questioned, Xu A'gen confessed, "I was not present during the kidnapping. Later, an uncle (娘舅) called me to see the hostage. I took a public bus from the North Station to Chen Xingjiang's house first, then went to the bungalow at No. 26. Besides me, there were also A'mao, Zhang Da, Gui Bao, etc. We stayed for about eight or nine days. On the morning of the 13th at 9:00 AM, I went home, so I was not present when Ye was ransomed. I heard the ransom was 10,000 yuan, negotiated by the uncle with the other party. On the 14th, I went to the Zhongnan Restaurant in Dapuqiao, and the uncle gave me banknotes, saying it was 100 yuan, but when I counted it at home, it was only 75 yuan. Our leader's name is San Rongfu." He was arrested for asking for debt at my house, he had nothing to do with this case.</p>
<p>▲Renting Process: Chen Xingjiang confessed, "I met the uncle when I worked at Gaochang Temple, but I don't really know his real name. On July 2nd, he suddenly came to my house to rent the spare room, saying he would only live for three or four days, so I rented him the bungalow. On the 4th, I saw three people entering the house, but I didn't see the hostage. The door was closed all day. They lived for about eight or nine days before terminating the lease. He originally promised to pay 160 yuan for rent, but when I asked for it, he refused to pay. Therefore, I had an argument with the people in the house. Finally, the uncle mediated and gave me 20 yuan." Judge Ge, having obtained the confessions, stated that since Xu Rongfu had been verified to be innocent, he should be released immediately, and the other two defendants should be remanded in custody for a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Tan Yigong Liquidates Huang Chujiu's Assets</h3>
<p>Legal Opinion</p>
<p>Submitting a draft legal opinion on the liquidation of Huang Chujiu's estate and debts, requesting prompt approval and implementation. The late Huang Chujiu, during his lifetime, engaged in business and accumulated significant debts. He worked hard throughout his life and died in sorrow and indignation. His family members, upholding his will, willingly compiled a catalog of all his estate and submitted it to your office for declaration of liquidation. Fortunately, it has been approved, so Huang's wish has been fulfilled. Although creditors of the Gongfa Company may have suspected the Huang family of concealing assets, nothing has been found to date. This should clear Huang of any wrongs and shows the extent of his financial ruin. However, considering that many of the Gongfa Company creditors are poor families who have been running around and appealing for half a year, eagerly awaiting payment, and have only received 10% of what they are owed, their situation is also pitiable. Huang Chujiu was the largest debtor of Gongfa Company. If Huang's estate can be sold off early to repay debts, then the creditors of Gongfa Company will indirectly benefit from it. This lawyer, entrusted by Huang's family to take on the task of liquidating the estate, dares not forget to protect Huang's legitimate rights. However, whenever I think of the plight of the Gongfa Company creditors, I would rather advise Huang's family to make as much sacrifice as possible. Therefore, since your office approved the declaration of liquidation, I have allowed the liquidators Wu and Pan, two accountants representing the interests of Gongfa Company, to preside over the affairs, hoping to be impartial and quickly resolve the situation, so as to reduce the losses of both creditors and debtors. Unexpectedly, the accountants believe they have gained the trust of your office and have lawyers representing some of the Gongfa Company creditors as their backing, and can act arbitrarily without any scruples. They do not allow Huang's liquidators to be informed beforehand and force them to agree afterwards. They disregard Huang's due rights and other debts owed by Huang personally, not caring for them at all. The lawyers representing some of the Gongfa Company creditors are attacking and seizing Huang's legitimate interests on various pretexts, relying on their ability to use the cries of the majority of ignorant creditors as a means to intimidate Huang's family. The accountants are also using Huang Xianzong's unfounded criminal case as a tool to control Huang's family. As a result, there is a lot of shady dealing and fairness is not being upheld. This lawyer, entrusted with the liquidation, has personally witnessed and cannot remain silent. After investigating the causes, it is due to the fact that the following legal relationships have not been clarified. I will now explain them separately:</p>
<p>(1) Legal points regarding the submission of Huang Chujiu's entire estate for safekeeping by the court: Submitting a catalog of all the assets left by Huang Chujiu to your office in preparation for selling them off and distributing them to repay all debts is fulfilling the debtor's responsibility. Your office appointing the accountants Wu and Pan to take over the movable property first and jointly discuss methods for the immovable property is a protective measure taken to maintain the interests of Huang's creditors, and serves to supervise the liquidation. It should not be the case that once the catalog of assets is submitted to the court, it is deemed that the Gongfa Company creditors have obtained ownership of the assets and can freely claim and dispose of them, leaving Huang in a position of no rights. If this submission is agreed to by all of Huang's creditors, who petition the court to treat all the submitted assets as full settlement of all debts and are willing to exempt Huang's debtors from future responsibilities, and is approved by the court, and all lawsuits regarding Huang's debts in various courts are withdrawn, then Huang's family can declare the liquidation completed and not interfere with the disposal of the submitted assets and the debt distribution methods. Otherwise, how can Huang's reasonable claims be rejected?</p>
<p>(2) Legal points regarding the approval of the declaration of liquidation: As China's bankruptcy law has not yet been implemented, according to the practice of your office, a request to declare the liquidation of all debts with all the debtor's assets is a quasi-bankruptcy procedure, which is legally valid. The judgment of your office approving Huang's declaration of liquidation states that Huang Xianyao and Xianzhong petitioned for the declaration of liquidation and approval to use all the assets left by their late father to pay off all his private and business debts (omitted). This is a legal recognition of quasi-bankruptcy. The subsequent instructions on which items should be sold and which should be retained, tasking the accountants to discuss methods with Huang's agents and report them for approval, clearly state that Huang's family is not allowed to be exempted from the debtor's responsibility for liquidation. Since Huang's family is not exempted from the responsibility of liquidation, all asset sales and debt repayments fall within the authority of Huang's liquidators and cannot be bypassed. The accountants, appointed by your office to discuss the methods together, are in a position of supervision and assistance and are clearly not granted the power to liquidate independently. If Huang's liquidation behavior is found to be inappropriate or to harm the interests of Huang's creditors, the supervisors have the right to express objections and can instruct on methods. If Huang's liquidators do not comply with the instructions, they can petition the court for a ruling. If Huang, the debtor, is not exempted from the responsibility of liquidation but is not granted the power of liquidation, how can Huang act?</p>
<p>(3) Legal points regarding the Gongfa Company liquidator's sole disposal of Huang Chujiu's estate: Since no one is responsible for the liquidation of Gongfa Company, your office has appointed someone to act on behalf of the liquidation of Huang Chujiu's estate and debts. Since his family has entrusted a lawyer to handle the liquidation, the court does not need to appoint another liquidator. This is similar to the case where a criminal defendant has selected a lawyer for defense, and the court does not appoint a separate defense counsel, or a civil defendant has entrusted a lawyer as an agent, and the court does not appoint a special agent. Gongfa Company, in relation to Huang's family, is in the position of a partial creditor. It is perfectly reasonable for the Gongfa Company's liquidator to claim debts from Huang's family, but it is even more baseless for them to directly carry out the liquidation affairs and solely dispose of Huang's entire estate.

<h3>Tragic Accident of a Child Jumping off a Train and Having His Arm Crushed</h3>
<p>▲Life may be spared</p>
<p>▲Disability may be unavoidable</p>
<p>Zhu Changfu, a blacksmith from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Main Machinery Factory in Songnan, is from Wuxi and currently resides at No. 62 Hefeng Road, Wusong. Changfu returned to his hometown on his day off the day before yesterday. His son, Zhenggen, aged eleven, went to the train station to meet his father around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday because his father had not returned. When the train arrived at Wusong, he still did not see his father, so he boarded the train, planning to go to Fort Taiwan to play. As the train entered the station, it had not yet come to a complete stop, and he jumped off. Unexpectedly, he lost his footing and fell onto the tracks. His left arm was crushed by the train wheels, and four fingers on his right hand were also severed. He was rescued and passed out due to the extreme pain, falling to the ground, covered in blood and flesh, unconscious. The stationmaster, unable to find his family, ordered someone to carry him onto the original train and send him to the Shanghai Railway Hospital for treatment. It was not until yesterday morning that his father returned to Wusong and was informed of the situation. Changfu went to investigate and rushed to the hospital. At that time, the doctor had just given him anesthesia to perform surgery. Changfu confirmed that it was his son, but the tragic sight was unbearable to witness. According to the doctor, the child was seriously injured, and there was no certainty at the moment. Life may be spared, but disability is unavoidable. It is noted that in the Wusong train station area recently, there have often been groups of children around the age of ten jumping on and off trains around 5:00 PM, playing around. Parents must prohibit this, otherwise, someone like Zhu Zhenggen can serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Gunshots in Xiyuan</h3>
<p>Xiyuan Teahouse at No. 410 Xinzha Road, around 4:00 PM yesterday, many people gathered upstairs for tea and gossip. Suddenly, gunshots were heard, two or three shots coming from the crowd. Order was immediately disrupted, and the noise was deafening. The Xinzha Police Station, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched many detectives to investigate. By the time they arrived, the perpetrators had already fled. According to onlookers, the people chatting were two groups of sworn brothers, and it was said that no one was injured.</p>
<h3>News from Putuo Tour</h3>
<p>The Putuo Tour Group returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Recalling the departure last Saturday, there were continuous drizzling rains in this city, but according to those who returned, although they encountered light rain at sea, the sky cleared up as soon as the boat arrived at Putuo. More than forty Chinese and Western tourists, men and women, were all beaming with joy, vying to go ashore, sightseeing and playing in the water, with endless interest. On the ship at night, there were also movies, songs, dances, and other entertainment to add to the fun, and every meal was unusually exquisite, far surpassing other Yangtze River steamers. It is said that the second tour will be held this week (August 1st), which happens to be a bank holiday, and more tourists will surely be eager to go. However, ship berths are limited, so those who wish to go must book early with the Puyuan Tourist Agency at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road to avoid disappointment.</p>
<h3>Mingyuan International Beauty Pageant</h3>
<p>▲Social Bureau instructs clear response</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau recently received a petition from the Shanghai Women's Relief Association, requesting to stop Chinese women from joining the Mingyuan International Beauty Pageant to maintain morality and protect women's personalities. The bureau stated that the association has never stated what kind of organization the International Beauty Pageant is, what its content is, and what its judging methods and judges are. It is deeply feared that there may be disguised obscenity and insults to women's personalities. Therefore, the preparatory committee was instructed yesterday to provide a clear response for verification.</p>
<h3>Guo Anci Resigns as Judge for Bathing Beauty Contest</h3>
<p>Mingyuan is opening and plans to hold a bathing beauty contest to attract attention. The Women's Relief Association believes that Mingyuan's move is tantamount to using women's looks as a tool for profiteering, which insults women's personalities, and has expressed its opposition. Ms. Guo Anci was originally hired as one of the judges of the bathing beauty contest. According to Ms. Guo, she had already resigned before the Women's Relief Association sent its letter. This happened a week ago and is no longer an issue.</p>
<h3>Development of the Chinese Harmonica Association</h3>
<p>▲Holding a Harmonica Tea Dance Party</p>
<p>▲Continuing to recruit new male and female members</p>

The membership fee is only three or four yuan per person, including lecture notes and music scores. Members receive half-price or free preferential treatment for concerts, tea parties, etc. Therefore, the number of members has reached 560. Even people from remote places such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Nanyang have flocked here. There are former Qing scholars, boudoir celebrities, and people from industrial, commercial, and academic circles, which shows the enthusiasm and interest of the general public in harmonica music. The association holds a social gathering every quarter as usual to connect members' feelings and promote high-end entertainment. It is heard that the association has scheduled for August 2nd (Sunday) at 4:00 PM at the Astor House Hotel outside the Waibaidu Bridge to hold the first "Harmonica Tea Dance Party" for all members. In addition to inviting the association's sponsors Lin Kanghou, Cai Yuanpei, Chen Tingrui, and other celebrities to give speeches or perform, there will also be music and games to add to the fun. The August "Elementary Harmonica Class" and "Special Class" continue to recruit. Those who are interested in studying the harmonica can go to the association's office on the third floor of No. 168 Sichuan Road at the intersection of Beijing Road to obtain detailed information.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhongshi Dies of Acute Plague</h3>
<p>Wang Zhongshi, a man from Yangzhou, aged twenty-nine, who ran a small book stall at the entrance of Meiyuan Road, Haichang Road, Zhabei, suddenly suffered from an acute plague yesterday and died next to the book stall without anyone to rescue him. He only had a father at home, who was smoking opium and was in the Caohejing Prison for official business. Besides this, there were no other relatives, so no one collected the body. Therefore, the eleventh district head Shen Xiaohe reported to the local court for inspection. Prosecutor Wu and others went to the scene and confirmed that he had died of the plague. They instructed the charity to collect the body and wait for the family to claim it.</p>

<p>▲Decides to hold a memorial for Song's mother</p>
<p>The Chinese Ciyou Association received a letter from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration yesterday stating, "We are writing to inform you that the notice from the funeral committee of the late Madam Song states that if people would like to give condolence gifts, they should donate directly to various charitable and public welfare organizations and submit the receipts to this office for entry into the registry. This bureau now intends to donate twenty yuan for the late Madam Song's condolences to your association for assistance with expenses. We enclose twenty yuan in cash and a letter for your reference. Please issue a receipt for delivery to the Song residence. Sincerely, the Chinese Ciyou Association on the fifth floor of No. 20 Bowuyuan Road in this city." In addition to issuing a receipt by the association and thanking the Railway Administration, it is heard that the executive committee of the association proposed that the late Madam Song was enthusiastic about the Ciyou cause during her lifetime. The association has repeatedly received assistance and guidance from her. After her death, she left this will, which is deeply related to the association. The association decided to hold a memorial for the late Madam Song with the money received from the condolence gifts to commemorate her forever, so as not to betray the late Madam Song's enthusiasm for charity.</p>
<h3>The Case of Zhong Hangsu's Wife Requesting Cohabitation is Being Attempted to be Reconciled</h3>
<p>Zhong Wang Lifu, a woman from Jiangxi, recently hired lawyers Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun to file a lawsuit in the local court against her husband, Zhong Hangsu (also known as Zhong Wuchang, a professor at Fudan University in Jiangwan), for malicious abandonment and violation of the duty of mutual assistance between husband and wife, requesting a judgment ordering cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglv specially opened the eighth courtroom to hear the case. According to the plaintiff Zhong Wang Lifu, she is thirty-six years old, from Jiangxi, and lives in Mingde Lane, Malang Road. Her husband, Zhong Hangsu, is a teacher at Fudan University. I came to Shanghai in the early October of last year. We got married in the fifth year of the Republic (1916). I came to Shanghai in the seventh year (1918) and returned to my hometown in the seventeenth year (1928) to visit my parents. In the eighteenth year (1929), due to the rampant Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province, I took refuge in Nanchang. In the nineteenth year (1930) in April, I took refuge in Sha with my mother and brother. I wrote to the defendant many times, but there was still no news. In September, I went to the defendant's sixth brother's place in Suzhou. According to the brother-in-law, the defendant had decided to divorce the plaintiff and had proposed five conditions: (1) Forever terminate the common life, (2) Give me two hundred yuan and let me return to my hometown in Jiangxi, (3) Give me four hundred yuan for living expenses every year, (4) Either return to Sichuan or return to Jiangxi, as I wish (Zhong claims to be from Sichuan), (5) (The man marries the woman's family, and each does not interfere with the other. These conditions are actually a disguised divorce. However, my eldest son, who is already thirteen years old this year, my second daughter, who is eight years old, and my youngest son, who is six years old, demand to complete cohabitation." Secondly, according to the defendant Zhong Hangsu, he is thirty-six years old and from Fucheng County, Sichuan. All the evidence is with lawyer Shan Yuhua, and he requests an extension. The plaintiff is indeed my wife, and there is no question about the marriage. I also do not oppose cohabitation. The judge asked, "The defendant is also willing to cohabit, so let's try reconciliation." He also told the defendant, "Husbands and wives should not hurt feelings, especially since you have received higher education. Moreover, the plaintiff has already given birth to three children." The defendant said, "I insist on ordering the plaintiff to return to my home in Sichuan." The judge said, "The road to Sichuan is difficult. Husbands and wives should follow each other closely. Since you work in Shanghai, your wife should also cohabit with you in Shanghai." The defendant replied, "I won't work at Fudan University anymore." The judge said, "This court cannot interfere with so much." He also told both parties to schedule a continued hearing on the 31st of this month and instructed both parties to try reconciliation outside the court. The court was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Exemption of Business Tax for Egg Merchants in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>▲Has Been Approved by Ministerial Order</p>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Trade Association, regarding the case of exempting various egg merchants from business tax, earlier presented it to the Shanghai Municipal Association Tax Regulations Research Committee, which was approved by the Ministry of Finance. All egg merchants in the interior are only buying and not selling, without any business income, and should be uniformly exempted in accordance with the ministerial order to ensure fairness. Fearing that the local areas have not received the notification and may cause disturbances, the association again presented it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the issuance of a notification to the collection agencies of various provinces and cities to follow the ministerial order. Subsequently, a reply was received stating that the Anhui Finance Department had been instructed to comply with the established plan. Because the association found that Anhui Province still had the situation of collecting business tax from egg merchants, which was obviously in conflict with the ministerial order, it sent another telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting a change to stop it. Yesterday, it received No. 6702 of the Finance Ministry's tax letter, with a telegram stating: "To the Shanghai Egg Trade Association: The Ministry previously received the association's telegram stating that the Anhui Provincial Business Tax Collection Office still collects business tax from egg merchants who set up businesses to collect eggs at the business tax rate. Please change the order to stop it. The Ministry has already ordered the Anhui Finance Department to comply with the established plan and notified the association of the telegram. Now, according to the department's reply, it has already complied with the plan and notified all subordinate collection agencies to comply with it. Please be informed, Finance Ministry, with seal, etc." The association has already notified all members.</p>
<h3>Dissent on the Shandong Wharf Surcharge</h3>
<p>▲Advocating Not to Establish Separate Items</p>
<p>▲Please the Authorities to Withdraw the Order</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute between Shandong merchants and the local cotton cloth industry over the wharf surcharge, the Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to investigate the business responsibilities and properly mediate, and formulated two points for handling: (1) The procedures for paying the wharf surcharge may be handled by the Shandong merchants entrusting the cotton cloth industry to handle it on their behalf; (2) The Shandong merchants must be responsible for repaying the cotton cloth industry for the surcharge paid, without any shortage. The Shandong Guild Hall was then ordered to inform the Shandong merchants to comply. Afterwards, when buying cloth from various firms, in addition to paying the unified tax and adding transportation costs, an additional wharf surcharge of one mace and three candareens of silver per single package and two mace and six candareens of silver per double package must be paid to the firms to pay on their behalf. After the Guild Hall notified the Shandong merchants, the representatives of the Shandong merchants stated in a letter that the Shandong merchants and the cotton cloth industry have been trading for decades, and all surcharges and other fees have been included in the price of the goods. One party has no trouble entrusting, and the other party has no labor of collecting on their behalf, killing two birds with one stone, which has become a custom. Even if this surcharge should be the responsibility of the buyer, it has always been included in the price of the goods by the seller. Although there is no distinction between the price of the goods and the surcharge on the surface, there is actually no burden of paying on behalf of the buyer. The decades of peaceful and trouble-free habits between the two parties have been overturned at once, and it must be revealed that each single package is added with a wharf surcharge of one mace and three candareens of silver, and each double package is added with two mace and six candareens of silver. Since it is said to be added separately, it means that there has never been such an item. Since there has never been such an item, how can the habits of decades of trading violate the current laws and regulations, or hinder the good customs of society? Moreover, after the dispute between the two parties occurred, more than 270 of the more than 300 cotton cloth industries in the city admitted that they traded as before. If based on the usual trading habits and referring to the current seller's public opinion, this dispute has been resolved without the need for trouble. However, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce did not investigate the situation in detail and listened only to the unilateral demands of a small number of people in the cotton cloth industry and hastily proposed a solution. It is requested to transfer the situation to the Bureau of Social Affairs and withdraw the order, etc. The Guild Hall has already transferred it on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Resolution of the Disturbance Against the Harsh Treatment of Foreign Merchants by the Coal Oil Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</h3>
<p>▲Mobil Oil and Others Have Agreed to Restore Allowances</p>
<p>▲The Coal Oil Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Takes the Opportunity to Organize a Guild</p>
<p>The coal oil managers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, because the three companies of Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco reduced allowances, treated them harshly, and affected their business, convened a conference of colleagues in the two provinces in Shanghai to deal with foreign merchants. After further negotiations, a resolution has been reached. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Opposition to Allowance Reduction: More than 50 Mobil oil colleagues directly managed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces include Shanghai Yuxin, Ningbo Fuliyuan, Nanjing Zhang Xintai, Hangzhou Desheng, etc., more than 40 Asiatic Petroleum colleagues directly managed include Shanghai Baochang, Ningbo Jinhua, Zhakou Xiehe, Suzhou Dacheng, etc., and more than 30 Texaco oil colleagues directly managed include Hangzhou Yifengcheng, Shanghai Xiehexing, Zhenjiang Dehe, etc. Branch management offices are not included. According to past practices, Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco provided allowances to direct managers in three colors, that is, 3%, and to branch managers 4%. Now the three banks decided in a meeting that from August 1st, all allowances for direct managers and branch managers would be changed to one color 8, that is, 1.8%, which is half of the previous amount. The entire industry expressed opposition and demanded the restoration of the original allowances. A general meeting was convened in Shanghai and resolved that if the foreign merchants did not make concessions, they would all stop business to show resistance.</p>
<p>▲Resolution Method: On the 16th of this month, the entire industry elected 23 people, including Wang Suizhi, Zhou Shanqing, Fan Ruifu, Wen Gongxuan, and Ma Yuliang, to negotiate with the three banks of Mobil, etc. The heads of major classes and compradors were appointed to negotiate, expressing acceptance of the requests of various managers, but only after the three banks had consulted and replied. The day before yesterday, Mobil hosted a banquet for all colleagues from Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Shanghai at Xinghualou, expressing that part of the interests of managers in various places could be restored. As for Asiatic Petroleum and Texaco, they both sent letters stating that they would follow Mobil as the standard. As a result, the industry disturbance was resolved. For the sake of jointly dealing with the oppression of foreign merchants and contacting feelings, colleagues from various places specially organized the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Coal Oil Industry Guild, which is now actively preparing, and it is heard that it can be formally established soon.</p>
<h3>Petition of All Workers of Jinxin Silk Factory</h3>
<p>Since the factory owner closed the factory and dismissed workers Zhu Zijin, Chen Peitang, and Zhu Laida, etc. of the Jinxin Silk Factory on Avenue Saussier in the French Concession, the Bureau of Social Affairs has approved the order for the capitalists to open the factory, and ordered the union to submit an application for arbitration on the dispute. The union has submitted two applications to the municipal government, but no arbitration has been received so far. All workers are worried. All workers of the factory went to the municipal government yesterday to petition. The municipal government sent Mr. Jiang to receive them, saying that they would order the Bureau of Social Affairs to report immediately so that arbitration could be convened quickly.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Price Increase Disturbance in the Book Industry</h3>
<p>▲Implemented uniformly from July 1st</p>
<p>▲Increase in Binding Machinery and Labor Wages at the Same Time</p>
<p>The local Chinese and foreign bookbinding colleagues, because the workers demanded improved treatment, the mediation committee resolved to increase wages by 10% from July 1st. They also proposed to the Book Industry Association to increase prices by 10%. It has been several months since then, and it has not been resolved. The Bureau of Social Affairs approved the method yesterday and ordered both parties to comply. It is heard that both parties have agreed in order to resolve disputes, and the details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Mediation Process: The 22nd was the last mediation date convened by the Bureau of Social Affairs. Xu Hanqing and Lou Weiqing, representatives of the bookbinding industry, Wu Qiuheng, representative of the book industry, Wang Bing and Sheng Yudu, clerks of the Bureau of Social Affairs, attended the meeting. The book industry representatives initially insisted that those above 80 cents for Western binding would not be increased. The bookbinding industry representatives requested that those above 80 cents be increased by 10% and calculated at 80%. After the chairman repeatedly guided them, the book industry representatives agreed to increase the price appropriately, and the bookbinding industry representatives also agreed to reduce the price appropriately. However, because the tasting industry representatives could not fully take responsibility and had to return to the association for instructions, the meeting was adjourned and waited for approval.</p>
<p>▲Approval by the Bureau of Social Affairs: The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs approved the Shanghai Book Industry Association and the Bookbinding Industry Association yesterday, stating, "Received, the case has been persuaded by the bureau to remove the staff members. Except for the uniform increase of one cent for Chinese binding and one cent for those with six and a half corners for Western binding and five points for those with seven and a half corners, which has been agreed by both representatives, it is now approved to uniformly increase five points for those above eight corners. Please comply with and handle this approval."</p>
<p>▲Agreement by Both Parties: The Bookbinding Industry Association, for the instructions of the Bureau of Social Affairs, has heard that the increase of five points for those above eight corners for Western binding has been expressed to be in compliance. All wages for bookbinding workers will be fulfilled from the date of fulfillment of the increase in the book industry (that is, July 1st). The Book Association, in order to resolve the matter quickly, has also expressed that it can reluctantly agree to the instructions of the Bureau of Social Affairs. After Executive Director Lu Feibohong returns to Shanghai within the next few days, all colleagues will be notified.</p>
<h3>A Dead Child in a Mat Package Comes Back to Life</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, Zhuang Shi, a worker from Zhapu Road in Zhabei, collected four corpses of children from various places. Two were placed in wooden boxes, and two were wrapped in broken mats. He carried them to the intersection of Gonghe New Road and Zhongxing Road to rest. The area was right across from the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. The guard Li Qingyin suddenly heard crying from the mat package and knew that the dead child had come back to life. He asked the worker, and he learned that the mat package was collected from the lawn in front of Shed C of the Xijin Guild Hall. Officer Li immediately reported to the police chiefs Luo Mingqi, Cheng Jun, and Chen Ruichun, and sent people to investigate the place. It was learned that the family of Sun Bingren, a Siyang native with the house number 17 in Zixingfang, abandoned the child. According to Sun, it was a boy named A Bao, who was two years old. He died at about 2:00 AM yesterday due to ineffective treatment. He had no money to buy a coffin, so he abandoned him there wrapped in a broken mat. The investigators then went with him to open the mat package, and indeed saw that the dead child had come back to life. They couldn't help but be happy from sadness, so they took him home. Onlookers were amazed.</p>
<h3>Injury While Playing with a Handgun</h3>
<p>The Cai Renmao Glass Shop at No. 139 Tiantong Road, Hongkou, was opened by the owner Cai Renchu. It has been in business for many years and has made a lot of profits. It was coveted by kidnappers. Last year, Cai Renchu was once kidnapped by kidnappers, but fortunately Cai was extremely alert and was not kidnapped. Later, he hired Wang Zuxian, a Tianjin native, as a bodyguard to accompany him in and out, and he was safe and sound. However, Wang shared a room with the old clerk in the shop at night, and they got along well. After 7:00 PM last night, Wang went downstairs to wash his face and casually placed his handgun on the table in the upper room. It was unexpected that the old clerk Li Awu (37 years old, from Changzhou) and Shen Zhongfu (27 years old, from Haimen) happened to see the handgun in the room. Their curiosity arose, and Shen took the gun and played with it at will. He accidentally pulled the trigger, and there was a loud bang. The bullet flew out and hit Li's left back, piercing his right back, and blood flowed like a fountain. Later, someone heard the noise and went upstairs, and sent the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported to the Hongkou Police Station and ordered detectives to come. They took the people involved to the police station for preliminary interrogation and handling.</p>
<h3>A Boy Crushed to Death by a Car</h3>
<p>The boy, named A Bing, was 12 years old. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, while walking along Ouja Road in Hongkou, he was suddenly hit by a No. 2 public bus that was speeding along. He was unable to avoid it in time and was crushed and fell to the ground by the wheels. He was injured in the head and bleeding from the large intestine, and died immediately. After the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade heard the news, they drove a fire truck to Tongren Hospital. The hospital reported to the Harbin Police Station and ordered Hua Bu No. 3178 to come and transport the corpse to the Ferren Road Morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>An Indigo Boat Suddenly Goes Missing</h3>
<p>▲Found at the Datong Wharf</p>
<p>▲The Captain and the Crew Were Detained</p>
<p>At about 9:00 PM the night before yesterday, Xue Silin, a Chinese staff member in the office of the Customs Water Patrol Police Station, reported that the captain of the wharf, Zhang Gui, reported that this morning, 120 boxes and 30 barrels of indigo were transported for the Qianyigong Customs Brokerage on Sima Road and parked at the Sima Road wharf. In the afternoon, he left the boat for some business, leaving the crew Tao Qiusheng and Fan Aguan to guard the boat. When he returned to the boat at 8:00 PM, it was unexpected that the boat, cargo, and crew were completely missing. When he asked the neighboring boat, they said that a small wheel dragged your boat away at 7:30, and I don't know where it went. When I heard the words, I immediately returned to the customs brokerage to report the situation, and then reported to your police station, etc. The Chinese staff member informed the police chief and immediately sent Bao Tans Wu Rongsheng, Ge Changsheng, Sun Agui, Wang Haiquan, and Deng Jiagen, along with armed Chinese police, to take a steam boat to patrol and drive to the Datong Wharf in Nanshi. In the darkness, they saw a small wheel parked there, and the red and green lights on both sides were extinguished. There were shadows on the wheel, about twenty or thirty people. Next to the wheel was a stone wharf boat. The detectives went forward to interrogate and saw seven people holding handguns among the twenty or thirty people. The detectives also took out guns and steel badges for self-defense. Unexpectedly, all those people went ashore and fled without a trace. It was found that the original stolen goods were all on the wharf boat. After checking, only two boxes of indigo were missing. They then took the boat and cargo (the crew had escaped) and the small wheel (named Jiafeng, a wild chicken small wheel of Qiaji Company) and the captain of the small wheel, Ni Heshang, to the police station together. According to the small wheel captain Ni, someone gave him five yuan to hire him to tow the boat, but he didn't know anything else. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Tao Qiusheng and Fan Aguan, two members of the indigo boat, voluntarily surrendered to the police station, claiming that they had left the boat for a long time and had not colluded to steal the original stolen goods, etc. The police chief ordered the two men, along with the small wheel captain, to be detained together, and the small wheel was also temporarily detained. The original stolen goods were taken away by the owner Huang Defeng at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and the fugitives were strictly arrested and brought to justice for investigation.</p>
<h3>Radios in Cars</h3>
<p>The Eagle King car radio invented by the Greesbeck Radio Factory in Chicago, USA, is used by many people, but it has not been seen in Shanghai yet. Wheeler Company is a giant in the local radio industry, and it covers everything from overseas novel products to the first purchase, so it has long ordered a large number of such radios from the United States. They have now been shipped one after another. It is heard that the machine is not affected by the vibration of the car engine and can avoid the obstruction of the car machine electrical system. The main switch is installed under the steering wheel, directly connected to the radio. There are seven vacuum tubes in the machine, and the power is used from the car's storage battery. There is also a loudspeaker, which is also electromagnetic. The machine can be installed under the front seat floor or in other hidden places, light and compact, economical and durable, loud and unparalleled. It does not cost much to have one in the car, and the fun is endless.</p>

<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Reading Materials and Entertainment in British Prisons</p>
<p>In most people's minds, criminals in prison, if they don't like to read, so be it. But if they do like to read, they must love detective novels because detective novels describe bandits and petty thieves, which can give them some criminal tricks that will be very useful after they are released from prison. However, according to reports from prison officials across England, the most popular reading material among criminals is Shakespeare and Bernard Shaw's plays. It's hard to know what that means. They love reading plays even more than novels, and the works of these two masters are profound and difficult to understand. In addition, there is the famous play "Abraham Lincoln," which tells the story of the life of American President Lincoln, and it is often found in prison cells. This shows that the conscience of criminals has not been extinguished, and they also admire great figures in the world. Regarding entertainment, Maidstone Prison is equipped with radio, where inmates can listen to music and songs, as well as various speeches on ethics and science. Bediford Prison has a dance class that is taught once a week, and Birmingham Prison even has sports field facilities, with all kinds of sports equipment available. This is what criminals are most satisfied with.</p>
<h3>Naughty Boy's Prank</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In recent months, there have been reports of ginkgo trees spontaneously combusting. People who love gossip have deliberately mystified the situation, spreading all kinds of bizarre and absurd stories. Superstitious people follow suit, often causing a sensation far and wide. According to what I have heard, the spontaneous combustion of a ginkgo tree in front of an ancient temple on Datong Bridge in Pengzhen, Kunshan, is particularly valued by the general public. Although several months have passed, the rumors have not subsided. This journal has also recorded similar events, but I don't remember whether it was the one that occurred in Kunshan. When the tree spontaneously combusted, nearby residents went to rescue it, but to no avail. It was also heard that someone shouted that the temple god had ascended to heaven and the ginkgo tree was emitting smoke. It is unknown who said this. The crowd became suspicious and fearful, believing it to be a divine phenomenon. As a result, it spontaneously combusted for three days and three nights, turning into a charred tree. Again, it is unknown who spread rumors, claiming that the ginkgo tree fruit had become a god, and that praying to it could cure any incurable disease. Superstitious believers believed it and went to pray. Some people also said that the tree roots and the vegetation around them were all elixirs, which could be taken home and stored for miraculous effects in treating diseases. As a result, within a few days, people took everything away. What was originally rotten and foul was transformed into something miraculous. Before long, the story spread to hundreds of miles away. People from neighboring counties also rushed to the scene, with vehicles and footprints lining the road. The authorities did not stop it, allowing the rumors to mislead the public and collecting incense money to rebuild the temple. To this day, people from all directions are still flocking to the site, especially on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month. Initially, it was not limited to ignorant villagers; even the educated class was deceived by it. At its peak, the incense and donation money could reach four to five hundred gold pieces per month. This ancient temple, which was once deserted, will soon be transformed into a magnificent and solemn monastery. In fact, the reason for the tree's spontaneous combustion was a prank by a naughty boy. Because the tree was old, the trunk was hollow, and there was a hole at the root. Before the spontaneous combustion, the naughty boy was playing under the tree and stuffed straw into the hole and set it on fire, resulting in this outcome. The words "the temple god ascended to heaven and the ginkgo tree emitted smoke" were also shouted by the naughty boy. Moreover, ginkgo trees are prone to being struck by lightning and spontaneously combusting. Therefore, it is not surprising that they are often struck by lightning, even if it is not a prank by a naughty boy. Now, the superstitious talk in that area has deeply penetrated people's hearts. Even though the cause has been revealed, people refuse to believe it and firmly believe that the tree is still divine. This is regrettable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Enticing Trap</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>The "Axe Gang" is a branch of the Triads and the Green Gang. In areas such as Hongkou in Shanghai, assassinations and armed fights often occur, using axes as weapons. We often hear about it and are not surprised. Recently, cases of enticing traps have been discovered in Shanghai. Their nature is very similar to the old "fairy jump" and "sliding door" schemes, but their methods are even more ruthless. They often use the law as a shield for extortion. Those who fall into their trap have no choice but to submit. Even with a hundred mouths, they cannot defend themselves. They can only eagerly pay up and fill their insatiable desires, lamenting that they have fallen into a trap. People therefore call them the "Female Axe Gang." My old friend Mr. W, who is well-known in the business world, occasionally indulges in seeking pleasure among flowers and willows after managing his business affairs. He is not a libertine. One day, while watching a movie in a large cinema, when the lights dimmed, a beautiful woman gracefully came and sat next to Mr. W. Her oriole-like voice occasionally teased Mr. W with jokes. Who is without feelings? Who can resist this? After frequent conversations, they exchanged backgrounds. Their eyes conveyed affection, and their souls were given to each other. After the play, they went to a restaurant together. The woman said that she was from Wu, eighteen years old, and her brother was responsible for the cashier's duties at a certain bank. She was currently living with her mother in a certain neighborhood in western Shanghai. In the depths of the green shade, a corner of a building was her home. She hoped that Mr. W would visit when he had time. Mr. W was very happy, thinking that he had met Yunying on the Blue Bridge, and that Peach Blossom Spring was not far away and the fisherman could inquire about it. From then on, they visited each other frequently and discussed marriage. Mr. W falsely claimed that he was unmarried and willing to make a lifelong commitment. On the night of their engagement, the woman's brother and mother also participated, and there were no objections at first. Before two months had passed, the woman suddenly hired a lawyer to sue Mr. W for bigamy in court. Her brother also threatened him with the crime of raping a girl under the age of twenty. The woman was like a different person. Not only was Mr. W a stranger, but she also regarded him as a deep-seated enemy. At first, Mr. W was still in a daze, thinking that the sea of hatred was hard to fill, the waves of love were rough, and the joyous face could be picked up again. Later, the threats became more and more intense, and there was clearly no emotion to speak of. However, due to his own reputation and status, he had no choice but to have a mediator like Lu Lian come forward to mediate, and the matter was settled with 5,000 gold pieces. Later, someone who knew about the matter sighed and said that this was the trick of the "Female Axe Gang." Their organization is quite perfect, with more than a thousand members in Shanghai. It is said that the profits are many times greater than opening a Korean geisha house. Their goal is to focus on prominent figures, wealthy merchants, and high-ranking officials in Shanghai, as their concerns about face make them easy to blackmail.</p>
<h3>Japan's Match Business in China</h3>
<p>— Wan Cheng</p>
<p>Japan's economic aggression, even with the match industry alone, is alarming enough. The Pootung Japanese Zuisan Match Factory is entirely manufactured by machines, with only four hundred workers. The Dachunghua Match Company Rongchang Factory has one thousand three or four hundred workers. According to people in the match industry, the products of the two match factories are on par. Also, the matches produced by the "Mingguang Company" on the market are printed with "Made in Sweden," but are actually produced by the Japanese Zuisan Factory. In the midst of the Sino-Japanese economic severance, this is something we should be aware of. I hope my compatriots will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Jumbled Fan Talk</h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>Shanghai's painting exhibitions can be considered to be at their peak. During this sweltering summer heat, fan painting exhibitions can also rise in popularity. Shen Junyouren of Huzhou excels at writing hairpin-style small regular script. He can write a seven-character Tang poem on a grain of millet. Those who see it marvel at his superb skills. Shen has close friendships with people in the art world. He recently launched a fan painting exhibition at the New World's third floor. For a time, famous painters such as Wang Zhongshan, Xiong Songquan, Zhang Huian, Yao Hongzhao, Kong Xiaoyu, Ye Weishen, Gao Shangzhi, Wang Yunsheng, Xu Xiaocun, and Yin Zixiang were all recruited. The fan surfaces are all original designs, custom-made to order, much like the open-pit mining method in porcelain. Gold backgrounds are used for writing, and white backgrounds are used for painting extremely detailed landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals, all of which are exquisitely crafted. It is a rare sight to behold. Entering the room, one immediately feels that the four walls are full of treasures, and one's eyes cannot take it all in. I love the most exquisite fan surfaces, such as the ink plum blossoms painted by Li Fangyuan. In the middle, there is a white background in the style of a book scroll, painted with detailed landscapes by Zhang Huian, Xu Xiaocun, and others. With every inch a thousand miles, the brushstrokes are full of remaining charm. Kong Xiaoyu's antique flower arrangements are antique and elegant, even more exquisite. Wang Yunsheng's animals are full of life and seem to leap to life. In the branches and trunks of the plum blossoms, Shen Jun writes hundreds of plum blossom poems in small regular script, with a charming style, like a seventeen or eighteen year old girl, making people love them endlessly. They can be regarded as doubly exquisite.</p>
<h3>Record of the Gu Lin Jing She</h3>
<p>— Qiu Kefu</p>
<p>Ancient countries must read ancient books. Ancient books are all in ancient language, which is different from modern language. Therefore, one must be proficient in the art of translation in order to translate ancient language into modern language. However, some errors in translation have persisted for a long time, uncorrected for two thousand years. The Qing scholars arose, questioning every word, character, sound, and meaning. They extensively examined various translations to find the true meaning of the ancient language. Once found, they did not immediately believe it. They also sought other evidence to support it. Only when all the evidence was the same, without any discrepancies, did they believe it to be true. Therefore, once a meaning is clarified, all doubts cease. Even if the translator were to rise from the underworld, he would have to sigh in admiration. The Qing scholars' meticulous research on language was like this. My friend Jun Zhonghu has long been fond of this learning and has made many discoveries. Recently, he has also analyzed and extracted the Shuowen Jiezi, the Great and Small Xu versions, and the Qing scholars' special books on philology, or those scattered in other books, arranging them by character to create a book called Gu Lin, hoping to reduce the daily effort of studying ancient texts and benefit learning for the ages. After the book was completed, he named his residence Gu Lin Jing She and asked me to write a record for it. The Jing She has a collection of 150,000 volumes, which is Zhonghu's place for writing books. He holds tea parties there whenever there is a constellation. This has been going on for ten years. The Jing She has changed its location several times, but the tea parties remain the same. On the appointed day, as the sun sets, the guests all arrive. The wind, rain, cold, and heat do not deter them. However, only Mr. Wu Zhihui has often helped the host to determine the format, which has been of great help to Gu Lin.</p>
<p>Correction: In the article "Record of What I Saw at the Jiangyin Garden Hotel" published in this column on the 23rd, a character "屠" (屠) was missing after the character "龍" (龍) in the fifteenth line. Also, in the article "The Alarming Search for Commercial Information by the Japanese in Shanghai" published on the 26th, the first character "我" (I) was a mistake for "日" (日).</p>
<h3>Random Talk About the Lives of American Women (III)</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>▲ Marriage: American women are not too demanding in their conditions for marriage. For example, a high school graduate is willing to marry a high school student, and a college graduate is willing to marry a college student. There are no demands to marry someone of a higher level. This is more accommodating than women in our country. The conditions they consider important are a strong physique, pure character, a spirit of service, and they don't care about the other person's wealth. They believe that people with wealth often have habits of laziness, arrogance, and extravagance. They only enjoy pleasure and cannot endure hardship. Moreover, they have their own jobs and can be economically independent, so they don't need to rely on their husbands for support. This detached view is very admirable. The choice of marriage is completely free. It starts with friendship and goes through a long period of careful consideration of each other. Only after a deep understanding and with the permission of their parents do they get engaged. There are also some couples who don't reveal their relationship beforehand. On the day of the engagement, they invite relatives and friends and announce the process of their engagement at a tea party or banquet. In the past, the marriage age in America was between twenty-five and thirty-five for men and between twenty-three and twenty-eight for women. Now it has been brought forward. However, early marriages are very rare. Because they haven't graduated from college and can't be economically independent, they absolutely cannot get married before the legal age of twenty. Their marriage ceremonies are mostly very simple. Religious people follow church rituals and ask a pastor to officiate the wedding. Non-religious people ask a respected person in the community or a local official to officiate the wedding. Before the wedding, the most important thing is to apply to the government for a marriage certificate. If the authorities do not approve and do not give the certificate, it cannot be legally established and will not be protected by law. In recent years, the number of divorce cases in America has been alarming. Among the forty-eight states in the country, the laws are different. In some states, due to religious reasons, divorce is absolutely not allowed by law. But in Reno, Nevada, divorce is absolutely possible. Some people say that the Reno city government's annual tax revenue is very small and insufficient to cover expenses, so this is a way to increase revenue. This seems to be a strategy to absorb the economy. Therefore, Americans divorcing have discovered two very strange phenomena. For example, if one party of a couple is unwilling to fulfill the conditions of the court's judgment and creates obstacles, there are two ways to go. Wealthy people go to France in the name of traveling to carry out the divorce (because the procedures in France are simple) and fulfill their wishes. People who are not economically well-off go to Reno to divorce to save money. It is said that the once deserted city of Reno has become lively due to the large number of people from various states divorcing. The income of the city government has also increased unexpectedly. As for single people, there are also quite a few. Some men are single due to unemployment and economic pressure, while a few women with millions of dollars are also single. However, the number of women who are economically independent and not feeling difficult in making a living is ultimately small. The so-called single is just a very small number.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Novel</p>
<h3>Woman Woman (III)</h3>
<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's visit seemed to be within Miss Ding's expectations. Because when Qiu Zi was serving them tea, she heard Miss Ding say, "Why did you only come today?"</p>
<p>Since arriving at the Ding's house, it was the first time that Qiu Zi saw Miss Ding meet her own friends. In a curious mood, she had already forgotten that she should no longer stay in this reception room. Until Miss Ding had no choice but to order her, "You go out! Maybe someone else will come, or there will be a phone call, refuse them all for me!"</p>
<p>Qiu Zi smiled in agreement and slowly retreated, but when she closed the door, she secretly saw Miss Ding already sitting down, sitting side by side with that Mr. Lu on a double sofa.</p>
<p>In the reception room, there was only a quiet atmosphere. Miss Ding seemed to have nothing to say, and Mr. Lu could only talk casually, from the continuous heavy rain to the dwindling of their interest in traveling. Miss Ding then said, "When the weather clears up, I really want to go to another city for a good trip."</p>
<p>"Have you not gone out to play since you had your holiday?" Mr. Lu asked.</p>
<p>"I've never gone out to play. Although Li Wenyao has written several letters, I've never paid attention to him. Yesterday he even called to ask me to play mini golf, but I declined on the pretext of being sick," Miss Ding said seemingly sincerely.</p>
<p>"Li Wenyao is really pitiful. He doesn't know his own boredom. His history of being dumped is known to everyone at school. He also vaguely published a novel in the school journal, but people laughed at him for having other intentions, and said that his novel was a disguised marriage advertisement!"</p>
<p>"I don't care about these things! However, playing with someone who has different interests always feels uninteresting. So, I welcome your visit," Miss Ding said, her eyes looking directly at Mr. Lu's face.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu suddenly stood up and walked slowly over, but then quickly walked back. He said to Miss Ding in an extremely gentle voice, "I really don't know what to use to repay you for your kindness to me."</p>
<p>Miss Ding smiled slightly. But she didn't say a word. This was clearly a time when a march was being played rapidly on Mr. Lu's leaping heartstrings.</p>
<p>"I have prepared a memorable thing, maybe you can accept me. It's just... maybe you can reject me! I think I will have the best of luck tomorrow," Mr. Lu said very gently.</p>
<p>But Miss Ding still only smiled slightly. Mr. Lu naturally already felt that there was a very successful hope. At this time, the night had already deeply enveloped the earth, and Mr. Lu then bid farewell and left. Miss Ding then opened her mouth and said a word, "Tomorrow, I'll be waiting for you!"</p>

<h3>Sharp Turn Downturn in Gold Market</h3>
<p>▲ Impact of Silver Price Spike</p>
<p>▲ Although the Trend is Weak, Fluctuations are Small: Yesterday, the 28th, the gold market suddenly showed signs of weakness, with no major changes in the situation. There were only two or three taels in head deals. From morning to night, the difference was no more than four and a half taels. As a result, it fell by more than seven taels again. The silver market's sharp rise almost immediately caused a low opening, with a sharp drop of more than ten taels, breaking within 750 taels. Trading among colleagues was vastly different, with small numbers. Foreign exchange slightly turned firm, but the bank's appetite was not bad, which was the opposite of the previous day. The gold market may have underlying potential in the future, and the trend seems to be turning upward. The market later stabilized, fluctuating around 44 or 45 taels, and the exchange rate stabilized, which calmed people's minds. The last black market was calculated at 46 or 47 taels. The price may fall lower this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Early Trading Plunged by 10.07 Taels: The opening price for September in the morning fell by 10.07 taels to 742 taels, because the price of large silver bars and silver both increased by one-half.

However, there were fluctuations of one or two taels in between. The foreign exchange was flat, settling at 13125, and then slightly fell by one tael.

Zhejiang absorbed 8-9 months at 125 to 1875. Mitsui took Japanese gold at 1.6125 taels, and the gold price was not very good, calculated at 5.45 taels. Later, because Yu Da, Fuxingyong, Tianfengyong, Qiantai, etc. sold, the price fell by three taels. At 10:00 am, it was 42.5 taels. At this time, the British gold bank did 125 between August, and then absorbed 125 to 1875, so hedging firms such as Yuanheng, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, and Juchang bought in, so the price increased by three taels to 45.6 taels at 10:30 am. Soon after, Yuan Maoyong, Dakang, and Yuyu came to sell. At 10:45 am, it was 43.3 taels. Later, the transactions of various companies were divergent, the quantity was still small, and the price fluctuated by two taels. Until 11:30 am, the Indian exchange rate was slightly smaller for the near term and larger for the far term, but only one Anna was involved. The Dalian gang bought in, so the price rose to 45.34 taels. Afterwards, there was only one tael of rotation. From 11:45 am (four and a half taels) to 5.5 taels, the market closed at 4.2 taels at noon, which was disposed of by goods and retail customers. The announced price was changed to 791.4 taels, which was calculated to be between 46 taels and 49 taels. At noon, it was 47 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Evening Closing Only Fell by 7.7 Taels: The market opened in the afternoon at 45.3 taels. Continuing because the selling party was active, such as Fuxingyong and Richang sold out. The Indian exchange rate did not change. At around 2:30 pm, it fell to 42.8 taels. After 8:00, HSBC took in 9-10 months of British gold at 125 to 1875, and the price jumped by more than three taels to 46 taels after being bought in by the Dalian gang, Tong Taichang, Yuan Maoyong, and Dadecheng. Afterwards, it was flat. However, Qian Changxiang and the Dalian gang sold out. 8-9 months of British gold can be settled at 125. Until 4:00 pm, it fell to 44.2 taels. By the time the market closed at 4:30 pm, it was calculated to be 45 taels, and then it was raised by two taels to 47 taels, which was truly retail customers making up for the losses. Compared to the day before, the price fell by 7.7 taels according to the listed price. According to the day's maximum of 46.5 taels and minimum of 42 taels, the difference was 4.5 taels.</p>

<h3>Securities: Stock Exchange Closed Today</h3>
<p>▲Handling July Futures Delivery and Settlement</p>
<p>▲Only August Futures Opened Yesterday, Prices Continued to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds and securities in the local stock market showed scarce spot transactions. In the futures market, the July contract was halted in preparation for delivery, while the September contract had not yet opened. The August contract saw some trading, but due to the proximity of delivery, major players were cautious and the market was quiet. The bond market was also very dull. Market sentiment was weak, buying interest was quite low, and prices did not fluctuate significantly. Overall, the results were consistently lower than the previous day. For example, the 20 Customs bonds for August each fell by over 1 yuan, the Disbandment 29 Customs bonds also fell slightly by 0.8 or 0.9 jiao, and the Consolidated Tax bonds continued to fall by 2.2 yuan due to some selling. The stock exchange is closed today to handle the July futures delivery and settlement, and tomorrow for delivery, so the market is closed for trading.

Spot transactions totaled 28,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Under Heavy Pressure</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly weak, and the trend is becoming increasingly softer. The overseas cotton yarn situation is consistently trending downward, silver prices are rising, and the gold market is falling, leading to increased market fatigue. Moreover, heavy pressure from major players is making it difficult to boost the market. However, current yarn sales are still doing well. Northern merchants are still actively looking for deals, and Cantonese merchants' imports are also smooth. However, the general public and retail investors are still nervous about the boycott movement, and their bullish sentiment is still present. Rongxinghao is also purchasing, making future prospects still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲Nearby Futures Remain Strong: The exchange's opening for cotton futures saw declines of 2, 3, 4, and 5 qian due to weak US cotton and a weak market. In the afternoon, there were further declines of 3, 4, and 5 qian. However, the current month remained strong. The trading volume was 34,750 bales. Sales included 600 bales from Jifeng, 650 bales from Gongtai, 850 bales from Rongxing, 1,550 bales from Xincheng, 900 bales from Tongyu, and 1,250 bales from Hengde. Purchases included 1,450 bales from Dafu, 2,450 bales from Rongxing, 750 bales from Gengfeng, and 850 bales from Ruida. The closing prices for cotton futures are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Extremely Weak</h3>
<p>▲Weather Clears Up...Sellers Begin to Emerge</p>
<p>▲Gold Prices Fall...Market Shakes</p>
<p>US cotton shows no signs of improvement. The weather in the local area has cleared up, leading to market sentiment loosening. There are fewer buyers, and the market is shaking greatly. The downward trend is quite strong. Furthermore, many local merchants are inclined to sell, so any adverse conditions lead to more violent reactions. However, merchants from Hubei are purchasing slightly. According to various reports, cotton fields have suffered considerable damage. However, the overseas cotton market is weak, silver prices are rising, and gold prices are weak, further emboldening the short sellers.</p>
<p>▲Hubei Cotton Drops 6 Qian: The exchange's opening for Hubei cotton futures saw declines of 3 and 4 qian for all months due to the weather clearing up and flat external cotton prices. In the afternoon, there was another decline of 2.5 qian. The trading volume was 75,100 dan. Sales included 2,800 dan from Taixing, 3,100 dan from Jifeng, 3,500 dan from Hengde, and 4,600 dan from Xinheng. Purchases included 2,800 dan from Dafu, 4,300 dan from Guangfeng, 4,500 dan from Shenchang, 2,800 dan from Rongxing, and 2,100 dan from Changfeng.

<p>▲Current Cotton Stagnant: Current cotton mills have no demand, and there is no source.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Show No Signs of Improvement</h3>
<p>▲US Cotton Re-enters 9-Cent Territory: Yesterday, US cotton was weak due to good harvests and selling pressure from Southern merchants. Futures fell by 6 to 11 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 5 to 6 points, and spot prices rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. Indian cotton was strong due to short covering and buying by brokers in the South, with Bengal and Oomra rising by 2.25 rupees and Broach rising by 3 rupees.

<h3>Grains: Rice Market Set for Price Increase</h3>
<p>▲Xinzha: Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and the sources from the West Road were around the 30th. The situation was completely unrecoverable. Changxi thick glutinous rice was bid up tightly in the morning, but it weakened by noon, and prices fell back by as much as 5 jiao. However, the transaction volume was extremely stagnant. Due to the continuous sharp rise in thin rice, there will inevitably be a surge in arrivals from the rear, and the overall market has not seen any upward movement. Arrivals of Luyang pointed rice are not abundant, and the appetite is also sluggish. Glutinous rice sales are extremely strong, and the situation is stable. There is no Baopu pointed rice available on the market.</p>
<p>▲South Market: There are not many ships arriving from various routes, and retail sales in urban and rural shops are becoming increasingly sluggish. Suzhou white glutinous rice is tightly priced, and the appetite for Pingwang, Lili, and Beitan goods is limited, with no price fluctuations. There are only two loads of thin rice on the market, and the overall market lacks goods. The rest is Songjiang boat goods. Outbound traffic from this street is constant, leading to tight pricing. Luyang pointed rice is scarce and in demand, so it is similar to the original market. The appetite for Bianyin Yuan is still acceptable, and the trend is hardening. Foreign rice merchants are procuring, but only taking a small amount from the Yangtze River area. The rest of the ports and this street see clear skies, and transactions have become sluggish. Market prices are hovering.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>▲Especially Distant Months</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market already showed signs of weakness. Because the weather has cleared up, it is expected that the water will recede everywhere, and the panicked state of outsiders has eased slightly. Manufacturers are still insisting on near-term contracts, but distant contracts continue to be sold off. Generally, people are aware that foreign wheat can continue to be priced, which is an extremely large obstacle to the future. As a result, the market sentiment has weakened. Actual sales of distant contracts are stagnant, and near-term contracts have slightly increased. As a result, the current month fell by 1 fen compared to the previous day, August fell by 2 fen, September and October fell by 1 fen and 7 li and 5 hao, November fell by 1 fen and 5 hao, and December fell by 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>▲Yangtze River Customers Fight to Speak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was initially flat and then showed a rising trend. Initially, foreign wheat quotations fluctuated by 1 or 2 jiao, and the weather also cleared up, so market sentiment naturally became quiet. However, customers from the Yangtze River area are suffering from severe floods, and grain prices are rising daily, so they are still competing to purchase, causing near and distant months to rise again. As a result, August rose by 5 fen compared to the previous day, September rose by 6 fen, and October to December each rose by 5 fen. Due to standards and rice prices, high-quality current wheat is also being bid up by 1 or 2 fen. Approximately 3,000 bags of wheat from Danyang, Dongtai, Penglai, Dacang, Shuangfeng, Baoshan, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang were purchased by Fuxin Hua and Xinda.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Green Tea Transactions Are Unusually Strong</h3>
<p>▲Chouxin Zhenmei Top Plate Opens at 270-280 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign merchant tea market, including green tea from various routes such as Luzhuang, Tuzhuang, and Pingshui, saw unusually strong transactions. Among them, items such as Zhenmei and Xiumei saw market prices rise sharply by 4 or 5 taels. Chouxin Zhenmei top plates have already opened at 270 taels. Tongfu, Jinlong, and other firms are also more actively interested in ordinary Zhenmei from Tunxi, Shexian, Suian, and other routes. However, the selling prices are all low. Low-grade goods from Yushan and Wenzhou have almost sold out. Chinese tea merchants are adopting a firm stance in light of the reduced harvests from various routes this year.</p>
<h3>Lyon Japanese Silk Sales Still Strong</h3>
<p>The Lyon market has seen sluggish silk sales since the beginning of summer. Although the silk weaving factories are in the summer holiday shutdown period, Japanese silk sales are still strong, and prices are weakening further. Chinese silk is greatly affected. Grade A Japanese silk is only opening at 163 francs per kilogram, Grade B at 125 francs, and Grade C at 92 francs, each falling by 4 or 5 francs.</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Sales Are Quiet and Lifeless</h3>
<p>Overseas silk factories are shut down for summer vacation, and yellow and white factories are unasked for. Silk telegrams are not being forwarded. Yesterday, only Zhonghe et al. imported 20 bales of white Qianjing silk, and Kechang imported 15 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices are all firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: 300 Tons of Abandoned Dutch Brown Sugar Traded</h3>
<p>▲Ice Flower Green Opens with a Smart Appearance</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to telegrams from the sugar-producing regions, Cuban spot sugar prices were unchanged. New York sugar futures for March were unchanged, May fell by 2 points, and other months each fell by 1 point. Java spot and futures sugar still lacked increases and decreases. Public association clearing buying interest was still quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white sugar was still at 11 taels and 5 qian, Hong Kong goods were at 11 taels and 4 qian, and No. 20 medium white sugar was at 10 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen. Transactions were sparse, and market conditions were flat. Taikoo granulated sugar spot B mark was clearing at 12 taels, and old goods CW mark were at 11 taels and 8 qian. The trend was also weak. In terms of abandoned goods, Huaxinhao sold 200 tons of Dutch No. 8 raw sugar for shipment in September at a price of 4 yuan, 9 jiao, and 7.5 fen in Dutch currency. The firm's purchasing interest was active. The company's Ice Flower Green is still selling well, so it continues to be offered at a price of 10 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen. Original goods are asking for 10 taels and 4 qian, and market conditions are smart.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Honey Dates Are Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Because those who traded in honey dates suffered huge losses in the previous year, the output was reduced last year, resulting in supply not meeting demand. Market prices are gradually rising. When the inventory was lacking, "秃秃" were sold for as much as 37 or 38 taels, and finally reached 42 taels, which was a rare high price. For example, small honey dates from Xinghua were previously only 11 or 12 taels, but this year they are also selling for 30 taels. They are now out of stock and are waiting for new loans to come to the market.</p>
<h3>Metals: Overall Market Trend Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Metal transactions have been extremely sluggish due to the continuous heavy rain. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and the market became lively, and the market situation also became stable. There were transactions in British and American goods, tinplate, and over 1,100 boxes were offered. The price of 90-pound British goods increased by 5 fen, selling for 14 taels and 5 qian and 5 fen. Tianjin and Qingdao merchants were competing for 7.5 li patterned British steel plates, with a price of 6 taels and 6 qian. The ordnance factory purchased 700-800 dan of 26-foot and 18-sheet black iron sheets yesterday, with a price of 11 taels and 5 qian. 400-500 dan of No. 16 to No. 20 new lead wire were sold yesterday, with the Sichuan merchants having the strongest purchasing appetite, with a price of 13 taels and 5 qian. The steel bar market was no longer as sluggish as before yesterday, with a price estimated at 91 taels and 5 qian. Although it fell by 1 tael and 5 qian compared to before, the transaction volume was higher than before. The purchasers were all construction merchants. Export business has little hope because all areas are suffering from floods. No. 5 white lead sheets have been slightly more active recently, with a price estimated at 25 taels. Angle iron and new foreign yuan are still stable in the near market. There were only a few transactions in tin and blue lead yesterday, but the supply is not large, and the market is still stable. Because there are still no goods from Hunan Province, the market for pure antimony is good, but in terms of prices, there is no hope of price increases because merchants from Hankou are selling off distant futures.</p>

<h3>Beside the Volcano</h3>
<p>— Sha Qing</p>
<p>About a month ago, I was still besieged by poverty and illness beside a volcano in a foreign country. That volcano had undergone several violent activities, and I almost got buried under the volcano. According to the measurements of geologists and volcano experts, that volcano was in the midst of an eruption because it was a sleeping volcano, just like people who fall asleep at night must wake up in the morning. It had been sleeping for a long time.</p>
<p>It had been sleeping for forty-five years. When it was awake forty-five years ago, it was said that tens of thousands of lives were completely swallowed by it. Now, there are still some remnants left on the foothills by the sea. The huge seaships, machine wheels, steam boilers, steam cabinets, and smokestacks that were destroyed by the sea are scattered haphazardly on the foothills and covered with red rust and green mold. No matter who sees that kind of heartbreaking and tragic wreckage, they would probably not dare to recall the scene at that time.</p>
<p>A school beside the volcano seemed like an unfortunate death trap because not long after I arrived there, I was entangled by illness. My body gradually became as thin as a ghost. However, due to the pressure of life and the cost of medical treatment, I had to support my weak and sickly body and run to the classroom to struggle desperately. After the whole day's work was finished, the mountain of test papers piled up on the desk completely absorbed my spirit and brainpower. From that time on, I was sick and unable to get out of bed.</p>
<p>A small dormitory was tightly covered by the deep green shadows of coconut trees. The inside was eerily quiet. At that time, I didn't seem to feel any sadness, just drowsily sleeping on the bed, quietly listening to my own heartstrings beating, and staring blankly at the electric light hanging by the window. Every time the electric light swayed very violently, I knew there was an earthquake. In normal times, I always felt that earthquakes were very scary, but when I was sick, this thought was completely reversed.</p>
<p>One day, a little after 1 am, the people in the entire village and town at the foot of the mountain were all immersed in their dreams. Suddenly, a heart-wrenching siren sounded outside. I opened my sleepy eyes and saw the electric light swaying back and forth non-stop, turning into a cradle for a loving mother. At that time, I was also as weak as a baby lying on the bed, unable to get up.</p>
<p>The next morning, a friend came to visit and told me about the signs of the volcano erupting three months ago. It was at noon one day when the earth's crust shook violently, and a sound echoed faintly from underground. Evil smoke filled the mountains, and the sky was dark and lightless. Many people were carrying flashlights and running towards the neighboring mountain peaks, like a tragic scene that had been shown in a movie.</p>
<p>I was bitterly entangled by illness there for more than two months, and it was only with great effort that I managed to break free. Now, I have finally left that dangerous volcano and safely returned to my homeland.</p>
<h3>I was after all, stunned</h3>
<p>— Jun Shan</p>
<p>This is a very special ending ah.  My four years of university life, here, is declared its final ending.</p>
<p>The registrar's announcement has already been posted, saying that our class will stop classes from tomorrow. The two words "stop classes", in the past, how much would they stir people's heartstrings. Although it is said that in our school, attending or not attending classes is entirely up to our own happiness to decide. If you are not willing, then absenting yourself from a few days of class without any reason will not cause any problems. But today's news of the cessation of classes has brought us an indescribable sense of sadness, contrary to expectations. The dormitory, which was usually full of joyful laughter, now has an added layer of dismal fog. Everyone seemed to be silent, as if they had been struck dumb. Happy smiles had also quietly slipped away from everyone's face. Oh, we all felt that the time of the past four years will never again be revealed on our future journey through life. Although the life of these past four years has been so ordinary, monotonous and boring, at this moment when we are about to shake hands with it for the last time, we finally feel that this is also a meaningful and valuable process that is worth our consideration. Yes, in these past four years, it has been very kindly giving us a lot of precious gifts, but, these gifts oh, we have all inadvertently put aside. Really, in our group, how many people have not failed its kindness.</p>
<p>Now, this is our last lesson. Mr. Xie, who has the best relationship with us, walked onto the podium with a briefcase, his face full of sorrow, dragging his legs that seemed very tired, but she didn't, as an exception, call out the names, nor did she open the book, but just stared at us. Naturally, we were the same, not making a sound.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is your last lesson," Mr. Xie finally spoke, but even in our class, which was usually known for its mischievousness, finally no one dared to come out and say "Yes" in response, but rather made the air, which was already very silent, even more oppressive. It became even more deathly silent.</p>
<p>"At this time, are you feeling any emotion inside?"</p>
<p>"Okay, let's not talk about these anymore. We're about to say goodbye. We should each say more comforting words to bless each other," Mr. Xie's nose seemed to be a little sore too, but the so-called comforting words only appeared in each of our minds, and then quickly disappeared like bubbles. We spent a very sacred forty minutes like this, and our last lesson was, after all, driven away by the relentless fire wheel of the god of time, never to return. How can we not be attached? We deeply regret it. Knowing that time is so easy to pass, why have we always been so casual?</p>
<p>"Okay, goodbye, everyone. Fortunately, we are all still young. Even if we say goodbye, we will never lack the opportunity to reunite in society in the future. Work hard, strive, cherish, everyone," Mr. Xie quickly finished these words and disappeared like a startled goose in our eyes. At the same time, I also thought of a sentence from Jiang Yan's Hate Fu, "Those who are sadly despondent are those who are leaving." In a week's time, wouldn't our group be flying apart like swallows, each going their own way? How can the reunions of the past be expected in the future, and isn't it the case that, except for one or two lucky ones, we are all blindly heading towards that dark and united society, searching for each person's destination? Oh, who can guarantee that no one is in danger, and that we can repeat that past life that, although was ordinary and boring, was still very peaceful?</p>
<p>Oh, I was, after all, stunned.</p>
