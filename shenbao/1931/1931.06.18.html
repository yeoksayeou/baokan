<p>近數日來。歐洲各國内部。時有政局動搖之象。而卒能轉危爲安者。以各黨中之要人。皆知在此經濟不安之情况下。引動政潮。於國家必多不利。故每至緊張時。恒覺悟急轉直下之不可。而自謀轉圜焉。此亦今政黨之所以異於昔也。英工黨内閣。爲地税修正案之相持。形勢已甚岌岌。昨於下院辯論之後。説者頗爲英國政局悲。然據今日麥唐納之報告。自由黨已變更其修正文字。政府允接受之。是英國突起之政潮。已有消滅無形之望矣。法國國家主義派議員波意倫氏。對白里安忽提彈劾案。意亦欲乘機引動政潮。使白氏一蹶不振。然</p>
<p>多數議員。以白爲政治舞台之宿將。皆主有以維持之。故今日投票結果波氏提案。已告敗。法政潮亦可不起矣。至德政黨反對政府命令之風潮前數日情勢。更緊急。今社會民主黨。忽然自動打消召集國會之主張。其故因覺悟白魯寗内閣辭職或國會解散。徒予左右極端派以進展之機會。而於國家則有莫大之危機。故不得不抛棄其向來之主張。於是德政潮亦有平息之望德輿論稱許其識見宏遠。職是故也。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>盧錫卿上將逝世迄今。瞬將半載。滬上同志追念舊誼。於本月十四日在赫德路佛敎凈業社舉行追悼大會。以表哀忱。茲將見聞所及。錄送自由談。以告是日未往之各同志。</p>
<p>是日籌成於下午一時前往。下車後。門口高矗雲霄之素牌坊已入眼簾。上懸横額。文曰「陸軍上將盧先生錫卿追悼會。」旁置蔣總司令所題之紅緞銘旌。約高丈餘。配以彩亭。入門簽到後。各贈黑紗一塊。白紙花一朶。兩旁所懸祭幛輓聯。有數百副之多。茲將記憶者摘錄如下。張市長送軸。上書五古一首。文曰「七歲蔚聲華。丁年奮明績。洸洸報國心。實堪吾黨式。誰言病在床。一朝遽偃息。嗚呼君壯齡。摧頽去何亟風雲既慘愴。白日亦西匿。健鵠舉層霄。折此摩天翼。溟鯤徙海運。中失圖南力。悲聲海上來。樞府爲失色。晋授悼前芳。榮典示終飾。親朋同一哀。里巷苦凄咽。與君交特深。傷懷信無極。勝會共招魂。抽毫淚横肊。」熊司令之輓聯曰「五夜嗁鵑。愁見大星摧上將。」「半生戒馬。應敎史筆紀豐功。」禮堂門口遍紮白彩。上懸「黨人模範」四字横額。係四川黨員王旭九呂丹崖等七十二人所贈。室内高懸白緞綉花幕帷。内供盧上將遺像。笑容可掬。無武人氣象。祭台上置高脚盆十六。滿裝茶點水果。并素菜一席。鮮花兩瓶。四壁遍懸蔣介石胡漢民于右任謝持等輓聯。均哀其懷抱奇才。富於革命思想。未竟其志而早没。實爲黨國之不幸。地下滿堆花圈數十。遠望之。宛似花阜。台左跪一年僅四五齡之孝子。盧公之胞姊漢淑兩女士。及胞弟師譔。均穿白衣而頸掛佛珠。面現戚容。蔣主席本擬躬祭。因赴贛勦匪。不日出發。正在籌備。未克抽身。乃派國府參軍楊虎代表。祭時先獻花。繼獻果。終獻饌。乃讀祭文。文甚哀痛。有嗚呼玉折蘭摧。邦國殄瘁。卓然不朽。一棺潛晦等語。蓋盧公性行忠貞。器識深遠。清季即獻身革命。追隨總理十餘年。國事馳驅。備嘗艱苦。陳炯明背叛總理時。盧公糾合師旅。規復廣州。厥功尤偉。綜其生平。悉事黨國。盡忠主義。終始不渝。病中不忘國事。輒手書數千言以呈蔣主席。默贊戎機。隠和黨見。病重時無醫藥費。由同志設法資助。則其生平廉潔。可以概見。公名師禘字錫卿。係四川成都人。曾充前中央直轄第三軍軍長。軍事參議院參議。四川省政府委員。没時年僅四十五。故是日報告略歷時。到會同志。莫不有哲人其萎之歎。歸而爲記。以誌哀悼。</p>

<p>兩情相戀。爲環境束縛而不克明媒正娶。則以私奔爲最後之長策。然此只兩方當事人在愛情熱度高沸時。未曾顧及將來終有水落石出之一日也。私奔貴乎速。亦勢所必然。方今科學昌明。昔日之帆風馬力。日漸落伍。而以蒸汽馬逹代。自能翺翔於天空之飛機發明以來。蒸汽機速度相形見拙。故運郵旅人。圖速達計。亦借重於飛機矣。物各摩登。則私奔何獨不可時髦。然吾國自有航運以來。曾未有人籍飛機以私奔。今茲所述。實開私奔之新紀錄。紅拂地下有知。當亦自愧弗如也。</p>

<p>滬上一埠。每年夏間因疫致死者。不下數千人。推其原因。皆由不知預防之故。故有識者亟宜注意夏季衛生。急早購備防疫藥水。以消滅空中穢惡之氣。剷除傳染之毒菌。自可安枕無憂。蓋防疫臭水中。含有多量之加波力酸。若以之澆洒室内。廚房。溝頭。牆角。坑厠。便桶。痰盂。及汚濕之處。則蚊蠅毒菌不難絶跡。而流毒無從矣。故知臭水一物。對於夏令防疫工作。實有莫大之帮助。惟每年需量甚巨。購取外貨。喪失利權。聞五洲藥房本廠出品之亞林防疫臭水。其製造器械甚完備。且係收買德産。故出品精良。信用卓著。茲特向讀者介紹之。因於防疫聲中。兼含提倡國貨之意也。</p>

<h3 id="c110">首都今後應做的文化運動　（下） <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>此次首都美術展覽會的舉行。實使人們得一個狠好的印象。以後希望首都敎育行政機關及留心文化事業的諸君。注意比展覽會更必要的美術館。促其實現。展覽會是暫時的。是提倡現代的藝術　固不可少。美術館是屬於永久的。是發揚及保存過去吾國藝術的精神。更不可少。再論美術館的主旨。還有下述兩種。</p>
<p>（一）提高時代藝術的地位　吾國藝術。不諭繪畫雕刻。音樂。工藝等等。在歷史上光輝燦爛。在本身已有相當的地位。即各國對於中國過去的藝術。莫不同聲贊揚。若論近代。已見衰頽。究其衰頽原困。由於近來各作家缺乏切身的研鑽。尤其在研究時期。更缺深知古人技術的傳統。以前國内收藏家。即有佳作。不肯輕示於人。故研究者欲得參考。至爲困難。參考既缺。見解便不高明。見解不高明。便會粗製而濫造。因此中國藝術。日漸降下。各國的藝術研究者。在探追技術時期。莫不徘徊於美術館。從古代的研究。而産生時代的新興藝術。乃必要的過程。温故而知新。即創造亦繫於此。有了歷史上先人的引誘。纔有後人的猛進。一個人决不會生來做創造家的。必定從良好的引誘而知就學之途。由就學之途而入藝術之宮。美術館之設。不惟保存固有藝術的權威。而且能提高時代藝術的地位。</p>
<p>（二）擴張國際藝術的地位　藝術是文化的　旗。是時代的寵兒。藝術不振。文化便衰。一國藝術的進展與否。全視時代藝術進行的趨向如何。外人踏我土地。見有美術館的設備。便得在其中揣摩。最能使旅者得良好的印象。國際開藝術宣傳。確根據在此。爭國際的地位。雖含有種種的設施。然而藝術的整理與向外宣傳。實有力焉。近年來日本人向歐洲宣傳東方文化的工作。不惜鉅資。不遺餘力。各國人對日人都已有相當同情。回顧我國。落於人後。且爲日人所籠罩。按日人藝術。追源於吾國。故今日不得不有國際上相當的宣傳。國際間宣傳藝術。第一步工作。須整理自國的藝術品。整理固有的精華而設美術館。那是急不容緩的事。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>（四）健兒的報復主義</p>
<p>從那天起。張小三兒就當了兵。當了兵之後。才知道不是預想着那麽舒服的一件事。單説學開步走。就挨了二三十回揍。當年拉車。巡警揍起來。可以跑。可以回嘴。現在敎操的班長排長。大耳括子打來。身子都不許動一動。世界上兒子對老子。决不能有那様恭順。這爲着什麽。爲着六塊大洋一個月的餉。這六塊大洋。本來是十塊錢打折頭算下來的。可是到了現在。連折頭也發不下。張小三兒當了兵四個月。才得着兩塊大洋。一個月的收入。從前拉一天的車。也就得着了。不過白坐電車。白聽戲。白逛窰子。這倒是事實。都嘗過幾遍了。這一天。是秋高氣爽的一個好日子。軍營裏得着半天假。由排長带去出城。白逛三貝子花園。興盡歸來。大家白坐電車。由西直門直奔前門。但是電車到了農商部街口上。發生了故障。突然停止了。花錢坐電車的。只得認着晦氣。這些八太爺可有點不耐煩。早有兩個人。打開窗户。探頭向外看了來。只見街心圍着一大羣人。據看熱閙的人説。四五個洋車夫一塊兒打架。要打出人命了。軍爺們一聽。這不能怪電車司機生不開車。大家都跑下車來上前看去。只見三個巡警。擠在一羣打架人堆裏。喝道。「不許打。不許打。全上區裏去。」一面説着。一面將警棍對糾纒不清的打架人。敲上了幾棍。一個大兵駡道。「他媽的黑狗不講理。幹嗎他也動手。」張小三兒想起從前在農商部街挨警棍的事。立刻心裏火星直冒。眼睛一瞪。駡道。「他媽的。總跟拉車的過不去。好小子。你現在動一動大爺。大爺揍得你吃屎。」那幾個維持秩序的警士。和這捍稦國家的兵士。各幹各的公事。誰也不會想到有什麽仇恨。而且警士和軍士又同是有槍階級。</p>

<p>▲新閘　昨日米市愈覺平淡、買氣難振、早晨開盤上落有限、常錫頂貨略鬆、薄稻上棧、異常寂寞、大盤又跌分、早稻存貨雖缺、形勢反低、</p>
<p>糯米需要稍好、市盤不穏、　杜尖銷路尙佳、價格獨挺、洋埠尖早間臨市人數寥寥無幾、洋米鄉匨帮交易仍好、但本街買進有限、價無漲跌、西路來船計常熟·無錫·溧陽·江陰·崑山·角里·重固等十七八艘、</p>

<p>糖市　粗砂白續開千餘袋</p>
<p>▲日糖劃市略</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訉、古巴現糖價未變動、紐約期糖九月份價比前電回升二分、餘月各升一分、</p>
<p>爪哇現期糖仍乏升沉、公會市塲劃盤人心見平、</p>
<p>買氣岑寂、荷糖二十四號粗砂白十一兩七錢、殊鮮受手、二○號中砂白十一兩零五分、交易亦寥、十二號荷赤市升至十兩零一錢、尙覺俏平、日糖進出亦懈、需要更寂、市且微落、Ｍ嘜十一兩三錢二分半、、ＳＨ嘜十一兩一錢二分半、ＹＰ嘜十一兩七錢、ＹＴ嘜十一兩三錢、ＹＲＯ嘜十兩零九錢七分半、ＡＥ嘜十一兩七錢二分半至七錢、太古ＤＹ嘜十一兩二錢、趨勢尙挺、號盤成交岑寂、</p>

<p>南北貨　毫紅棗開出午餘包</p>
<p>▲價爲六兩半至七錢</p>
<p>毫州紅棗近日到貨頗多、號家前昨兩日均有開出、統共成　千餘包、價爲六兩七錢至五錢、</p>

<p>▲英人來發幾乎被騙</p>
<p>▲張發奎之弟亦在内</p>
<p>▲因刻圖章敗露一切</p>
<p>▲内幕如何尙未能詳</p>
<p>前年夏間、本埠曾發生一冒充美國副領事、向華人嚴九齡騙取捐領總會執照運動費巨萬之奇案、當時中外報紙、競相記載、該案人犯、一爲世界著名之軍事偵探由勤畢克、一即冒充美領之高頓、此外尙有一嫌疑犯名勒味司、蓋經前臨時法院研訊結果、判决畢、克處徒刑九月、高頓處徒刑三月、勒味司蓋宣告無罪、距今已隔兩年、畢克·等兩人、久經徒刑受滿、恢復自由、茲除高頓外、該兩人昨晨又被捕房以妨害秩序及僞造圖章兩罪、向特區地方法院提起控訴、按畢克爲腦威籍、勒味司蓋則隸俄籍、此次被控之</p>
<p>情節至爲重大　據來發洋行主英人來發氏日前向總巡捕房之報告、且牽及目下廣東之事變、來發氏報告大致係以本年五月中旬、由傑勿生公司西人某介紹畢克與勒味司蓋兩人至渠行定購軍火、該西人當時言畢克等俱有正當職業、不致發生意外、渠即予延見、畢克等自稱彼輩嘗充德國軍官、刻下任職於中政府、畢克經國府委充上校軍事顧問、勒味司蓋任少將軍事顧問、今奉國府　　特派採辦軍火　旋經接洽妥貼、售與步槍六千五百支、手槍一千二百五十支、以及子彈等另件、計價洋一百七十七萬三千三百二十五元、先付百分之二五、餘欵俟貨交清給付、上項價欵解交大通銀行、軍火則運至廣東汕頭兩處交卸、是日隨訂就草約、渠爲鄭重起見、知照買方、於契約簽字時、須各邀公證人一、以資證明、案件既就、畢克等遂去、越日復偕華人三名來行、經畢克等一一介紹、始知三華人中之名張發英者、</p>
<p>乃張發奎之弟　餘二人皆爲購置委員、因續將此事商榷一過、訂定六月十二日正式簽字、若輩去後、渠覺此事大有可疑、蓋畢克等既受國民政府委派、何故又軍火運往粤汕起卸、故渠特請求駐滬英國領事代向南京方面調查、嗣經英領諭知軍火固不妨售賣、但須審愼辦理、渠乃將草約送請海禮司律師審查、經海律師將該草約第七條修改、爲此項軍火、如改運往他處起卸、須先通知出賣人、而一切合法手續、概須受買人自行辦理、並請大通銀行如買方交付貨欵時、注意</p>
<p>付欵人委任狀　及其所佩符號、迨届六月十二日正式簽字之期、渠請英人卡羅氏爲公證人、買方之公證人爲朱才學、契約一式三份、買賣兩方、各執一份、餘一份存公證人處、買方代表簽字者爲張發英、而是日張君未至、僅由渠將契約簽字後、交由畢克等携去、以便着張簽字、不意畢克等將契約取去、遂不復返、因不悉其住所、無從探訪、頃據平素相識之乍浦路四百六十七號半六十八號半美泰印務局主何子祥來行向渠言、有一外人赴彼處囑刻一圖章、該外人且言且出一章、着照様刊刻、限十六日刻就彼俟該外人去後、諦視様章、則爲來發名義之章　故來相詢、渠聞何子祥語、深覺詫異、轉詰何該外人之形狀、據何所述、斷定此人爲勒味司蓋、既屬限期刻就、則必有急需、請如時派探前往查究云云、捕頭爰於前日）十六（派探長俄人貝貝寗、探員哈威、華探馬文達、馳往美泰印務局附近守候、至午後四時三十五分、見勒味司蓋果步入該印務局索所刻印章、試印一過、覺尙無誤、隨探囊出打就西文之紙一張、以新刻之章、印於下端、另向該印務局假一他章、	印於上端、狀似滿意、仍將此紙納諸衣袋、付請刊費、取得印務局收據、而將新刻之章棄置該局、匆匆辭出、方及門口、納</p>
<p>遂被探員拿獲　搜出印章之西文紙暨收據、带回捕房、嚴究畢克之住所、經其供明現住禮查路四號、而彼則住法租界霞飛路泰禮山房子二十四號、捕頭除飭將該俄人收押外、即往禮查路將畢克逮捕、昨晨傳同來發及卡羅兩證人解畢克等往特區地方法院、由許家栻庭長升座第一刑庭提審、檢察處派錢鴻業、檢察官蒞庭執行職務、首由捕房律師汝葆彝將起訴案由及本案經過陳述之下、並請求掣發搜查狀兩紙、以便即往兩被告寓所搜查種種證據、繼由西探報告在美泰印務局門外目擊勒味司蓋鈐用圖章情形　而來發亦將購買軍火始末盡情罄述、惟卡羅則稱因與來發相識、由來發邀請簽字作證、詳情實非所知、許庭長乃向勒味司蓋訊問、據供來發洋行係專爲軍火營業、彼經傑勿生介紹、爲該洋行雇員、專司管理裝運事宜、如由大連起運而往各口岸者、概由彼經管、茲彼因偵知行主來發代廣東購買大批軍火、特將其合同兩紙竊取、出首向國民政府財政部長宋子文告發、宋氏據報、次日即離申赴都、派監督來申、勒供至此、畢克繼而供稱、來發原定本月將代購之軍火、運往廣東、交與張發奎、經勒味司蓋得悉、竊得其合同、交由我携往南京告發　故該項合同現尙留存南京、來發見所爲敗露、乃僞造圖章、以圖陷害、勒續供稱前往美泰印務局係定印卡片、約期昨日印就、故昨日往取、並未向刻圖章、搜出之西文紙、亦非合同副本、實係來發於五月間裝由腦威·日本·兩國商輪運往廣東軍火、囑爲結算之賬單、訊至此、已午後一時、捕房律師乃請求改期兩禮拜俾調查證據、兩被告則覊押厦門路西牢、許庭長即准所請、宣告退庭、畢克等遂由捕解交西牢收押、</p>

<p>江蘇綏靖督辦張之江、昨晨來滬、新聲社記者訪之於其私邸、據談、江蘇綏靖事宜、係分爲兩步辦理、第一步工作爲剿匪、第二步工作爲清鄉、茲誌其所談各節於后、</p>
<p>▲剿匪已畢　張氏謂、江北各縣匪徒頗衆、必須賴有軍隊進剿、方可剷除、然匪衆多屬當地鄉人、見軍隊到、則收置其槍械、充爲良民、軍隊去、則復出爲匪、是以欲求澈底肅清匪患、必須注重第二步工作、現剿匪工作、早已畢事、刻即在繼續清鄉中、</p>
<p>▲清鄉工作　清鄉爲綏靖事宜中最重要之工作、本來此項清鄉工作、已亦届結束時期、然爲澈底辦理計、仍須在實際上繼續工作、以求一勞永逸、上次余曾到各縣視察、並告各縣縣長及當地長官等、勿僅恃文書上之報告、即爲畢事、須在實質上做去、對於鄉民之良莠、亦須有確切之了解、現在蘇省各縣、工作已結束者、約有三分之二、未結束者、約在三分之一左右、</p>
<p>▲巨匪解揚　上次張氏親來上海、與法領交涉移提之江北巨匪支小桃、張氏謂已於本人昨日到滬後、由法租界移交、派人於當日解赴揚州歸案、該匪於一月前逃來上海、在江北犯案、約七十餘處、殺人放火、無所不爲、逃滬後、本伏於公共租界、聞綏靖督辦署派人來滬逮捕、遂即逃入法租界、在法租界被獲後、該犯猶延聘律師聲辯、並設法運動、擬圖脱網、畢</p>
<p>後經外部及淞滬警備司令部再向法方交涉、始於昨日移解歸案云、</p>

<p>Organizing the Autonomous League</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Telegrams from Northeast China groups report that the diplomatic situation in the Eastern Provinces is increasingly urgent. Japanese residents have convened representatives from Changchun, Sipingjie, Andong, Taonan, Qitao, Gaiping Fuzhou, and other places to form the Autonomous League. Their wording states that Japanese and Korean residents are being oppressed by the Chinese, and the Tokyo government's diplomacy is weak and has not been tough on China, allowing China to gradually reclaim special rights in Manchuria and Mongolia. The residents, for their own sake, have no choice but to take self-defense measures. The Japan Diplomatic Association also holds the same view. Furthermore, the Seiyukai party of Yoshino in Japan also criticizes their government for being weak on China. These united, organized, and methodical proposals are aimed at urging the implementation of the Twenty-One Demands. It is hoped that the central government and local officials in the Northeast will pay serious attention. The recent clashes between Korean residents and the assistance provided by Japanese police are related to this plan. The Chinese side has only issued a protest, which has had little effect. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will pay attention and jointly plan a response, and not delay the overall plan due to local issues. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Only 200 Li from Tachienlu</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, Tibetan troops occupied Litang (i.e., Lihua) on the 10th of this month, only 200 li from Tachienlu. There are fewer than 1,000 Chinese troops, while there are about 3,000 Tibetan troops. The Sichuan army is intent on seizing opium-growing areas and advancing eastward, and is unwilling to assist Kang, which is why Kang is in its current state. The Dalai Lama has issued orders to commend the various units entering Kang, while China is still claiming that the Dalai Lama has accepted mediation, which is simply deceiving oneself. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Kang-Tibet conflict is indeed due to the Dalai Lama colluding with Tibetan troops,</p>
<p>intending to occupy all of Kang. They have successively captured Ganzi and Zhanhua, and recently invaded Lihua, a key location in southern Kang, putting the situation in dire straits. The people of southern Sichuan have organized a support association and telegraphed Tang Kesan, the special envoy who has arrived in Yaan, requesting that he beseech the central government to order the Tibetan troops to withdraw from Kang and await a resolution. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Kesan, the special commissioner investigating the Kang-Tibet conflict, telegraphed the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, stating that after leaving Chengdu, he arrived in Kang on the 11th and received a letter from the Tibetan representative, Qiong Rang, inviting him to Ganzi to discuss mediation methods. However, that place is still occupied by Tibetan troops, and it is planned to negotiate their withdrawal from Ganzi and Zhanhua first to show peaceful sincerity. Further details will be reported later. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission ordered the office in Tibet to quickly urge Jiangba Quwang, the director and deputy director of the office in Kang, and others to go to Tibet to jointly mediate the long-standing dispute between the Da and Bai temples.

<h3 id="e7">Russia Deliberately Delays Sino-Russian Conference <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the ninth Sino-Russian conference was originally scheduled to be held on the 16th. However, Karakhan used the excuse of a tea party hosted by the Russian Foreign Ministry for the diplomatic corps and decided to postpone it to the 21st. The date of the meeting had been predetermined long ago, and the hosting of the diplomatic corps should also have a scheduled date. A conflict should have been avoided beforehand. Karakhan's excuse of hosting the diplomatic corps is actually just a form of wording. In the past, when Yan and Feng rebelled, the Russian side used excuses to postpone the meeting. Now that the Guangdong Incident has been launched and the Red bandits in various places are stirring again, the Third International may be secretly manipulating things. Russian diplomatic authorities are again taking a wait-and-see attitude in order to reap the benefits. Our countrymen must be vigilant. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to a telegram from Moscow, Karakhan notified our delegation on the 15th that the ninth Sino-Soviet conference, which was originally scheduled to be postponed until the 16th, would be postponed to the afternoon of the 21st due to the hosting of foreign envoys. Foreign sources suspect that the Russian side is deliberately delaying the conference. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Wu Tiecheng arrived in Tianjin at 7:00 AM on the 17th and met with reporters. The 19th is the 60th birthday of Zhang Jinghui, the speaker of the Senate. I am representing Chairman Chiang to Harbin to offer congratulations and then to Beiping to visit Deputy Commander Zhang. The Guangdong Incident was due to a misunderstanding. The central government sent Zhang Ji to explain, and the result was very good. The misunderstandings of the Guangdong side towards the central government have been adequately resolved. The biggest problem in China is the Red bandits. The central government is determined to annihilate them with all its strength. The Guangdong side also understands this. Guangdong will not send troops, and the central government will not send troops. The central government is preparing concrete solutions. In other words, it is to solve it from within. The central government hopes to resolve it before the opening of the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang, or it may be delayed until after the closing of the Fourth National Congress. Hu Hanmin has not yet recovered his health after his illness. If Hu wishes to go abroad for recuperation, the central government is willing to help him succeed. After Li Jishen restores his party membership, whether he will take office as a member of the National Government, I did not meet Li when I left Nanjing, so I cannot judge. Chairman Chiang will go to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists within a week, and I believe that it will not be difficult to annihilate them within the scheduled period. It is heard that Madam Wu came with him to escape the summer heat in Beidaihe. Wu may stay at the beach for a short time. Wu left Tianjin for Harbin at noon on the 17th.

<h3 id="e22">Recent Political Turmoil in Britain, France, and Germany <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, there have been signs of political instability in various European countries. However, they have been able to turn danger into safety because the key figures in the various parties all know that in this economically unstable situation, inciting political turmoil will inevitably be detrimental to the country. Therefore, whenever the situation becomes tense, they always realize the impossibility of a sudden downturn and seek their own solutions. This is also why today's political parties are different from those of the past. The British Labour Party cabinet was in a very precarious situation due to the dispute over the land tax amendment. Yesterday, after the debate in the House of Commons, speakers were quite pessimistic about the British political situation. However, according to MacDonald's report today, the Liberal Party has changed the wording of its amendment, and the government has agreed to accept it. Therefore, the sudden political turmoil in Britain has the hope of disappearing without a trace. French nationalist parliamentarian Boillon suddenly proposed an impeachment case against Briand, intending to take the opportunity to incite political turmoil and make Briand suffer a setback. However,</p>
<p>most parliamentarians, considering Bai as a veteran of the political stage, all supported maintaining him. Therefore, the result of today's vote was that Bo's proposal was defeated. French political turmoil may also not arise. The situation in Germany a few days ago, when the German political parties opposed the government's orders, was even more urgent. Now, the Social Democratic Party has suddenly taken the initiative to abandon its proposal to convene the parliament. The reason for this is that they realized that the resignation of the Bruning cabinet or the dissolution of the parliament would only give the extreme left and right wings an opportunity to advance, and there would be a major crisis for the country. Therefore, they had no choice but to abandon their long-standing demands. Therefore, the German political turmoil also has the hope of subsiding. German public opinion praised its far-sightedness. That is the reason.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th dispatch: Governor-General of Korea, Saito, has resigned. The government has decided to have General Ugaki succeed him. The imperial appointment ceremony was held in the palace this afternoon. Furthermore, the successor to the Chief of Political Affairs of the Governor-General of Korea's office has been decided as the current Vice-Minister of Communications, Imaida Kiyotoku.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th dispatch: The fundamental policy of the new Governor-General Ugaki towards Korea will be to avoid arbitrary suppression and instead strive for active industrial development. In the future, conscription will be implemented, and other administrative measures will also be made identical to those in Japan.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th dispatch: The Diet hopes for a new approach to governing Korea and has great expectations for General Ugaki's character and vision. Furthermore, Ugaki has served as acting governor-general and has rich experience, which has garnered much praise.

<p>Land Tax Amendment Proposed Out of Order</p>
<p>Liberal Party Helps the Government</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 16th dispatch: During today's House of Commons discussion of the 20th clause of the Finance Bill, a Liberal MP proposed a land tax amendment. However, the Speaker ruled that it was out of order because the amendment should have been proposed during the previous discussion of a certain clause, which has already been passed. Therefore, the political crisis that was expected to arise from this amendment was suddenly eliminated. In the afternoon, Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the Liberal Party has changed the wording of its land tax amendment, which the government has accepted, but the details still need to be considered.</p>

<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Vienna, 16th dispatch: The Austrian cabinet resigned en masse today. Previously, Interior Minister Winkler resigned to the prime minister in opposition to the government's policy of guaranteeing debts for a certain private company. Hours later, the cabinet decided to resign as a whole. The Austrian president has now ordered Entel to act as interim prime minister while awaiting the formation of a new cabinet. After the cabinet's resignation, the ambassadors of Britain, France, and Italy visited acting Foreign Minister Skobeck for discussions. However, it is feared that the conditions for foreign countries may not be uniformly recognized after the formation of the new cabinet.</p>

All people consider maintaining peace as an essential duty, which is in line with France's consistent responsibility to ensure the safety of its people's lives and the independence of the country. He also stated that today's economic crisis originates from the difficulties of France's neighboring countries, not from the disorder of France's domestic economy.

<p>Social Democratic Party Considers Overall Situation</p>
<p>Opposition Motion Ultimately Defeated</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 16th dispatch: Germany's political situation suddenly brightened today. The Social Democratic Party canceled its call for a parliamentary session in the last five minutes because they deeply feared that after the failure of the Brüning cabinet, a new cabinet would inevitably be dominated by the National Socialist Party, and they were even more concerned that the two extreme factions would also gain victory in a new election. Therefore, when the Standing Committee of the Parliament put the Communist Party's motion to convene Parliament to a vote today, the Social Democratic Party unanimously assisted the government in defeating the motion. However, although the Social Democratic Party has ceased to proceed with the convening of Parliament, it still adheres to its original purpose, stating that emergency orders must at least be submitted to the budget committee of the Parliament for review. The Social Democratic Party has declared the reasons for its surrender to the government, stating that Brüning has allowed for appropriate modifications to the emergency orders in the future, but in reality, it is due to the fact that there would be a great crisis after the resignation of the Brüning cabinet or the dissolution of Parliament, and for the sake of overall safety, a major sacrifice had to be made, which is understood by all.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Soviet Russia's Railway Business Advances Rapidly <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Moscow, 16th dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party has been discussing the effectiveness of spring planting and harvest issues for several days. It has also discussed in detail issues such as railway transportation, economic issues, and municipal issues in the capital and various regions. After Railway Commissioner Roshixueviz made an important report on the revitalization of the railway business, the Executive Committee passed a resolution stating that since the industrialization of Soviet Russia, the railway business has expanded rapidly. In 1913, the railway's load was 13.2 million tons, which increased to 33 million tons in 1930. Railway passengers increased from 18.5 million people in the year before the European War to 55.7 million people last year. Railway work has greatly increased compared to before the war. The current situation is only 7% away from the end of the Five-Year Plan. However, although the cargo volume has increased, the construction of new roads has not been fully developed. In 1930, the railways built in Soviet Russia totaled 12,800 kilometers. A plan has now been approved to assign each locomotive to a specific driver for management, increase their wages by 13%, and focus on the electrical application of various roads in the future. Furthermore, this year's procurement should include 1,038 new locomotives, 47,000 freight cars, 197,000 tons of rails, and 22.2 million sleepers.</p>

<p>Establishment of Organizations to Train the Public for Combat</p>
<p>The Military Focuses on Studying the Geography of the Far East</p>
<p>The Northeast Crisis is Imminent - The People of the Country Should Awaken Quickly - Japanese Army Plans to Propose Two Proposals to the Disarmament Conference ▲ World News Agency translated a British newspaper report from Moscow stating that, in addition to industry, the Soviet Union has another major development, the purpose of which is to make the Soviet Union a vast military power. Throughout the Soviet Union, there is now an association called "Aviohim" (meaning "aviation chemistry"), with millions of members. The association publishes multiple monthly reports, the content of which teaches readers various combat methods and military education. Specifically, there is the management of aircraft, the use and prevention of poison gas, the use of firearms, and shooting practice. In short, everything a soldier should know is included. The association has multiple aircraft for flight training throughout the country and a large number of firearms distributed in many places. Every so often, these firearms are used to teach members how to shoot. As for target shooting competitions, they are held from time to time. This organization can be transformed into a large combat machine at any time, and the factories currently under construction can also be converted into places for manufacturing military equipment and ammunition at any time. If the Soviet authorities believe that the time has come, they can immediately turn the current economic war into a military war. At that time, the Soviet Union's military power will exceed that of the German army during the Great War. Countries are now competing to provide machinery to Soviet Russia, creating a foundation for self-destruction. The danger is extremely great. "Aviohim" is a new method of training the national reserve for war and instilling them with a military spirit. At the same time, great emphasis is placed on the training of the military itself. The main purpose is to study geography, especially the geography of the Far East. Approximately, their second step will be to send a large number of personnel to Manchuria for inspection, just as Japan has done. ▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th dispatch: Taking advantage of the international disarmament conference to be held in February next spring, the Japanese Ministry of the Army plans to propose two proposals for the sake of establishing international peace, namely (1) Germany's military equipment is subject to unilateral military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, and there is often a risk of being threatened by other countries, which is contrary to international justice. According to Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant, "the restriction of armaments should be to the extent necessary to ensure the safety of the country," the Treaty of Versailles should release Germany's military equipment and return it to its original position.</p>
<p>(2) Although Russia superficially advocates the abolition of armaments, its standing army has reached 1.09 million, and its equipment is said to be the best in the world, often threatening China, Japan, and other neighboring countries, and even threatening world peace. Russia's military equipment should be greatly reduced. The Japanese Army wants to expand Germany's military equipment to contain Russia, but it is doubtful whether the diplomatic authorities will approve this proposal.</p>

<p>English Newspaper Editorial Worth Noting ▲ Reuters, London, 17th dispatch: The Morning Post editorial today stated that China's customs is one of the efficient administrative organs, and the great powers should take strong and unified action to restore the unification of customs. Even if the Guangdong authorities do not listen to their words and hand over the designated amount to pay off foreign debts, the great powers should still take joint action, as they did in 1923.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, London, 17th dispatch: The Times commented on Feetham's report on the future of Shanghai this morning, stating that future administrators will find many suggested materials in this fair report. The Feetham Report has set Shanghai on the path of far-reaching reform. However, Ambassador Lampson's negotiations with Foreign Minister Wang have shaken the foundation of the Shanghai International Settlement's extraterritorial rights. Even if Shanghai's extraterritorial rights continue to exist for another five or ten years, even if the implementation of the new treaty is extended due to negotiations between other countries and China, Feetham's so-called method of counting not in years but in decades will not be realized. During the possible ten-year period, Chinese and foreign public opinion in Shanghai may create a new international basis for the International Settlement agreement, as Feetham deems necessary. However, it seems doubtful whether the central government can recognize it at that time. Therefore, the recovery of the settlement in one form or another is closer to a plan that is closer to safeguarding against future dangers than Feetham planned. Closer cooperation between the settlement authorities and important Chinese residents of Shanghai and Nanjing is essential because the interests of the Chinese people across the country are tied to the maintenance of the stability of this important centralized place. The current British government has made unnecessary silence on the recent negotiations on extraterritorial rights. It would be good if the British government acted after carefully considering the Feetham Report. (See local news)</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, London, 16th dispatch: Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden stated in the House of Commons today that the government has not received a request regarding the International Silver Conference.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Simla, 16th dispatch: A previous dispatch from Salt Lake City, USA, stated that according to responsible American sources, China and Japan support the International Silver Conference, but Britain opposes it because of India. After this dispatch was sent, it led to rumors of Britain's opposition to the International Silver Conference. The Indian government has now issued a statement stating that India's ability to cooperate internationally to restore the silver market has been detailed in the budget statements of 1930 and 1931, and there has been no change to date. ▲ Reuters, London, 16th dispatch: Anderson, director of the Far East Department of the London Chamber of Commerce, stated at a meeting today to discuss the statements of the Far East Economic Group that the impact of India's use of the gold standard is the decline in the value of silver in the East. The rapid decline in silver prices has stimulated the expansion of industry in China entirely through artificial excitement, but the artificial expansion of Chinese industry will be suspended due to domestic unrest. The meeting passed a resolution requesting the International Chamber of Commerce to compile a plan for a fixed silver price to serve as a basis for discussions among related countries.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Wang Chonghui Departs from Harbin for Europe <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>▲ To Assume Post as Judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague ▲ Conversation Between Wang and Secretary Xiao Jinfang ▲ Harbin Correspondence: Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, en route to attend the International Court of Justice in The Hague, arrived in Harbin at 8:00 AM on June 11th, coming directly from Dalian. He happened to meet Li Shaogeng and others traveling to Ping from the Chinese Eastern Railway in Changchun. They shared a special train No. 231, making the journey less lonely. Upon arrival in Harbin, key figures from various agencies welcomed him at the station. Wang stayed at the Grand Hotel No. 6 in Qinjiagang. From morning until noon, greeters arrived in droves. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by key figures from the Special District. His passport had been telegraphed in advance and processed by negotiator Zhong Yu. Wang expressed a desire to see the sights of the northern regions, so he stayed for three days. At 3:30 PM on the 14th, he took the Eurasian train through Russia to the Netherlands. He was accompanied by only one secretary, Xiao Jinfang.</p>
<p>He told reporters that President Wang had already submitted his resignation from the position of President of the Judicial Yuan in order to take up his post as a judge at the International Court of Justice, but it was not approved by the government. He was only granted a six-month leave of absence. With the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, the Judicial Yuan was fundamentally reorganized, so there was no dedicated person responsible for the affairs of the Yuan. The International Court of Justice is organized by the League of Nations and is specifically designed to resolve international political disputes. Its nature is the same as the former Hague Peace Conference, but its scope has been expanded. Judges are chosen by election, with 15 full members and 4 alternate members. There are 51 member states. If a full judge is unable to attend or should not attend, an alternate takes their place. The term of office is nine years, and the court convenes once a year. The statutory date is June 15th, but this year it has been postponed to August due to various reasons. The date is not yet confirmed. This year's important case is the lawsuit filed by Britain and France against the implementation of the new tariffs by Germany and Austria. President Wang served as an alternate judge in the previous term and was elected as a full member last year. He will stay in The Hague for about four months, with a total round trip of six months. Upon returning to China, he will likely take the Siberian route. President Wang is quite passive towards political life. It is uncertain whether he will return to the political stage after returning to China. Furthermore, when he passes through Moscow, he may meet with the representative of the Sino-Russian conference, but this will be a private social event. It is not true that he is carrying a central government mission to convey instructions to the representative. A Guanghua News Agency reporter visited Wang at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 12th) and recorded the following Q&amp;A: (Q) How did the Commissioner get elected as a full judge of the International Court of Justice in The Hague last year? (A) On September 25th last year, the General Assembly of the League of Nations and the Council of the League of Nations held a joint conference in Geneva to elect new judges. There were 52 countries voting and 58 candidates. Fifteen full judges and four alternates were to be</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>elected. I was elected as a full judge with 39 votes. (Q) Can you tell us the names and nationalities of the 15 full judges in this session? (A) In addition to myself, there are: Former Japanese Ambassador to France, Adachi Mineichiro; Sir Hurst of the United Kingdom; Former US Secretary of State, Kellogg; Dr. Xu Jin, former member of the German Parliament; Former legal advisor to the French Foreign Ministry, Fromageot; Former President of the International Court of Justice from Italy, Anzilotti; and Former Senator from Spain, Altamira, totaling seven people. The remaining seven are legal experts from Cuba, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Romania, Colombia, and El Salvador. (Q) What is the date of the International Court of Justice's session and the situation of the cases being heard? (A) The session is scheduled to open on July 15th, starting with written submissions. The "German-Austrian Customs Union Case" sent by the Council of the League of Nations will be heard. Then, representatives from Germany and Austria will come to the court to defend their case. (Q) The National Government has previously declared that it will abolish consular jurisdiction from the first day of next year. Will it be possible to do so by then, and what will be the situation with Japan in the future? (A) Regarding the matter of consular jurisdiction, the National Government is currently continuing negotiations with the United Kingdom and the United States. There is indeed progress in the negotiations. As for Japan, there are still six months left. During this period, China and Japan should be able to find a satisfactory solution. Furthermore, the National Government has issued a declaration to abolish consular jurisdiction on the first day of next year and promulgated the "Regulations for the Implementation of Jurisdiction over Foreign Nationals." This shows that the National Government has the greatest determination. No matter what, it will recover legal rights next year. (Q) Is the opposition of various countries to our country's recovery of legal rights based on various issues such as the legal code, prisons, and judicial system? (A) Our country is actively improving the legal code, prisons, and judicial system, and has made great progress. Various countries are also aware of this. Therefore, various excuses are just for show. In essence, it is because various countries in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou, due to commercial relations, do not want to easily give up their acquired privileges in China. However, since our government has the greatest determination, and the people unite to support it, the abolition of consular jurisdiction will definitely be achieved. (Q) The Provisional Constitution of Political Tutelage was drafted by the Commissioner. There was also a provisional constitution in the early years of the Republic, but it was not implemented. Can this Provisional Constitution of Political Tutelage be fully implemented? (A) If the overall situation in the country is settled, the central government is consolidated, and the people of the whole country sincerely support the constitution, then its full implementation will be gradually achieved without difficulty. (Q) What are the Commissioner's opinions on the Guangdong issue? Can a peaceful solution be reached? (A) I have been away from Shanghai for several days and am not very clear about the latest situation. The people of the whole country are now suffering greatly and eagerly desire peace. Mr. Zhang Puquan is still mediating in Guangdong, and the central government has the grand aspiration of a peaceful solution. Therefore, the Guangdong issue can be resolved peacefully through political means. I personally also eagerly hope for this. (Q) What is the Commissioner's observation on China's future? (A) Regarding China, I have always held an optimistic attitude. This is because our country has a vast territory, abundant resources, a large population, and the national character is resilient, hardworking, frugal, and diligent. If the situation of unity and peace can be maintained permanently, and the Three People's Principles are faithfully followed to remove all constraints and strive for construction, then China's freedom and equality will definitely be achieved. The future development will be immeasurable. We can be optimistic about it. (Q) What are the Commissioner's thoughts on the journey north? (A) In the South Manchuria area, the Japanese are keen to operate and spare no effort. Their aggressive vigor is truly startling and alarming. Commissioner Wu Tiecheng said, "</p>
<p>If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how big China is. If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how dangerous China is." These words are truly profound. The people of the country should endure hardship and work hard to rise up together to build a new Republic of China." At this point, guests from all walks of life came to visit, and the reporter excused himself and left.</p>

<p>▲ Includes more than 70 pieces of porcelain, ancient coins, and ancient Buddha statues ▲ The Wang family in Linzi also plans to secretly sell antiquities ▲ Qingdao Correspondence: A few days ago, the German merchant Melchers &amp; Co., acting as agent for the local Catholic Church, declared ten boxes of antiques for shipment, intending to transport them to Shanghai on a foreign ship for onward transport to Hamburg. The Business Section of the Port Authority seized and detained them at Stack No. 7 of the Great Port Wharf. In total there were ten boxes. Except for eight boxes of non-antiques which were released, two boxes of antiques were reported to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government specially ordered the Bureaus of Social Affairs and Education to conduct an inspection and report back. Yesterday, the 15th, Section Staff 　Ji from the Bureau of Social Affairs and Section Staff Wen Shao from the Bureau of Education, together with Li Pushan and Guo Fenggang from the Port Authority, arrived at the Great Port Wharf at 9:00 AM to open the boxes and inspect them according to the manifest. There were 56 ancient coins, one ancient sword, one Wucai (five color) vase from the Ming Dynasty Wanli reign, a pair of small green Hundred Flowers vases, one bone-inlaid flower basket, two white jade round flower pieces, one five-inch Wucai porcelain dish from the Tongzhi reign, one large and one small white cabbage-shaped Sancai (three color) porcelain bowl from the Tongzhi reign, one Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>stone vase, a pair of Yixing Wucai porcelain flowerpots, and several ancient bronze Buddha statues. In addition, there were also two pairs of red embroidered shoes for bound feet worn by Chinese women, which was quite strange. After the inspection, the Port Authority temporarily took custody of them, and the inspection situation was reported to the Municipal Government for review. Furthermore, Linzi was the site where the ancient Qi and Lu states established their capitals. There are the most tombs of kings and nobles. A person named Wang in the city, several years ago, excavated many antiquities. The family is a wealthy official, with a large number of calligraphy and paintings. It is now heard that the Wang family has packed all the treasures and antiquities in their home into twenty-three boxes, intending to transport them to Qingdao for sale, and there is even a rumor that a contract has been signed with a foreign merchant to sell them. The authorities have been informed and have sent people to secretly monitor the train stations and docks. It is unknown whether these antiquities will flow to foreign countries (June 15).</p>

<p>Telephone Company's Loan from Japanese Case</p>
<p>▲ Closing arguments have been announced ▲ Sentencing set for the 22nd</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The lawsuit between Jinan Telephone Company and Japanese East Asia Development Co., Ltd. regarding debt has been repeatedly heard by the High Court. However, because the case is of great importance, the details are complex, and it is related to extraterritorial rights, the court has been unable to render a verdict after hearing the case for several months. This (16th) afternoon at 2:00 PM, the High Court convened a collegial panel again in Civil Court No. 2 to hear the case. Those present were: Presiding Judge Gan Jianshu, Judges Yi Xinding and Yi Gui, Translator Jiang Jianshi, Clerk Yan Huaqiu, Appellants present, represented by Yan Chenghan and Mai Rongqing (both lawyers), Respondents present, Japanese lawyer Yoshida Shin, Translator Gaji Takao, and Long Qingyun, a Chinese employee of East Asia Development Co., who willingly testified for the Japanese. After the opening of the court, Presiding Judge Gan Jianshu first summoned the respondent's witness, Long Qingyun, to state his name, address, and occupation. He then asked the witness what opinions he had. Long replied that he was 35 years old, from Yexian, and an employee of East Asia Development Co. in Qingdao. He knew some things about the loan from Jinan Telephone Company to East Asia Development Co., but not others. I will now present in court what I</p>
<p>know. There are two parts to the loan from the Telephone Company to the East Asia Development Co. The first time was the loan contract signed on October 16, 1920, and the money was allocated on November 29 of that year. This time it was 40,000 yuan. The second time was the contract signed on March 26, 1921, and the money was allocated on August 26 of that year. This time it was 400,000</p>
<p>Japanese yen. The Director of General Affairs of the Telephone Company came to Qingdao to pick up the money. Between April 28th and 29th this year, a person named Miao Jingwen sent a letter from East Asia Development Co., saying that the Telephone Company had printed false accounts in Qingdao and Tianjin in 1925 and replaced them with new bookkeeping, regarding the loan from East Asia Development Co.</p>
<p>The entry was completely deleted. In his letter, he said that if East Asia Development Co. gave him 50,000</p>
<p>yuan, he could find the old accounts and said that he had a good way to prove that the Telephone Company borrowed money from East Asia Development Co. The person who wrote the letter was a colleague of Ma Huikai when he worked at the Local Industry Bank, so he understood very well. However, East Asia Development Co. believed that the Telephone Company's loan from East Asia Development Co.</p>
<p>The money was based on evidence and was a real matter, so it did not contact him. Then, the appellant's lawyer, Yan Chenghan, stood up to refute, saying that the respondent's witness, Long, was an employee of East Asia Development Co. As for the loan date he mentioned, it was completely inconsistent with the date on the contract and he did not understand the case at all. As for the section in his letter where Miao said that the Telephone Company made false accounts, it was even more unfounded. According to Long, he is an employee of East Asia Development Co. and has no qualifications as a witness. Moreover, there are many gangsters in Qingdao. It is still unknown whether he is an employee of East Asia Development Co. or a Japanese person hired with money to serve as a witness. Then, the appellant's lawyer, Jia Rongqing, stood up and briefly said that the case has been heard several times. The situation of the case has been described in detail during previous hearings. Please announce the end of the debate and set a date for sentencing. Then, the respondent's Japanese lawyer, Yoshida Shin, stood up and stated all kinds of reasons he had held during previous court hearings, summarizing and repeating them. Finally, Presiding Judge Gan Jianshu announced in court that the case has been heard repeatedly. Today, the end of the debate is announced, and the sentencing will be held in Civil Court No. 2 at 2:00 PM on the 22nd of this month. The court then adjourned. At this point, the Jinan Telephone Company and Japanese East Asia Development Co. loan dispute, which has been unresolved for a long time, came to an end. (16th)</p>

<p>Plans to Reduce Funds for Beining Railway</p>
<p>▲ Regarding the allocation of funds to various institutions in the Northeast ▲</p>
<p>Before the country was unified, the Beining Railway had a separate Jingfeng Railway Bureau in the Northeast, with directors and deputy directors appointed by the Northeast to manage all railway affairs from Shanhaiguan to Shenyang. The railway revenue was also controlled by the Northeast</p>
<p>for use. Since the unification of the entire railway, the railway has been completely under the direct management of the Ministry of Railways. However, since the Director Gao Jiyi is a staff from the Northeast and also serves as the Chairman of the Northeast Communications Committee, the Northeast still has the right to use the railway funds preferentially. Recently, the Ministry of Railways believes that the Beining Railway is financially exhausted and still needs to raise funds for its own development. The monthly allocation of funds to various institutions in the Northeast is still as high as more than 200,000 yuan. If it is not reduced, it will inevitably cause difficulties for both sides. Therefore, it has formally written to the Northeast Communications Committee, listing various expenditures, requesting that it be substantially reduced to maintain the situation. It is heard that the committee's review also recognizes that the Beining Railway's financial exhaustion is indeed a fact.</p>
<p>It should be reduced as appropriate to maintain both sides. It will stop allocating assistance funds to the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry School and the radio station. As for the Ministry of Railways' proposal to abolish the Northeast Joint Transportation Accounting Office, the domestic joint transportation in the Northeast is the most complicated and is developing rapidly. The calculation and allocation of all accounts for the Eastern Four Routes and Western Four Routes cannot be done properly without nearby guidance. Moreover, most of the staff of the office are transferred from the Beining Railway staff, so it is proposed to continue to operate as before. As for the expenses of the Rotary Schools in the Shen-Luo section and the construction expenses of the Tao-Suo Road, one is that nearby allocation is more convenient, and the other is that the project has not yet been completed and it is difficult to stop suddenly, so it is temporarily allocated as before. The committee has detailed the reasons for the above and replied to the Ministry of Railways for review. The letter from the Ministry of Railways to the Northeast Communications Committee is appended below: "According to the report sent by the Beining Railway Bureau to the Ministry of Railways, a list of monthly allocations of funds to your committee and its affiliated institutions has been received, including: Your committee's expenses, from July 1928, 15,000 yuan per month; The joint transportation office expenses, from October 1929, 1,000 yuan per month; The expenses of the Rotary Schools in the Shen-Luo section, from May 1928, the monthly amount is uncertain, recently increased to 5,700 yuan; The subsidy for the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry School, from June 1929, 600 yuan per month; No</p>
<p>The subsidy for the line radio station, from May 1928, the monthly amount is uncertain, recently increased to 1,600 yuan; The construction cost of Tao-Suo Road, from October 1929, 100,000 yuan per month, all without a deadline, please review. The Ministry of Railways has found that the Beining Railway is financially exhausted, and its own development is still dependent on assistance. This kind of extra burden should be appropriately reduced according to the situation. According to the previous situation, it is proposed that consultation be carried out as follows: (1) Regarding the expenses of your committee, it is found that this expense is a regular expense within the committee. Before the committee's affairs are completed, it is proposed to continue to allocate the money; (2) The expenses of the joint transportation office, in May 1929, Zhang Changguan Jingdian was approved to change the Northeast Joint Transportation Office into a liquidation branch of the Ministry of Railways. All joint transportation funds from various roads in the Northeast were managed by the branch. The Ministry believes that joint transportation accounting is related to international accounts. The organization of joint transportation accounting and the compilation of statistics are particularly important to concentrate authority to be effective. In November, Commissioner Li Ding was sent to your committee for investigation and four ways to tentatively maintain the situation were agreed upon. Subsequently, Zhang Changguan's reply telegram was approved to proceed accordingly. However, the above method was originally for the convenience of your committee's command and supervision, and to take all considerations into account, because the situations of the roads in the Eastern Provinces are different. It was a special compromise in a helpless situation and was only a temporary expedient, not a long-term plan. Now that the country has been unified, the joint transportation accounts are related to international affairs and should not be used as an excuse for foreigners. Therefore, it is requested that the office be abolished as soon as possible to unify authority and save railway funds; (3) Expenses of Rotary Schools. The Rotary Schools of various roads were originally institutions for cultivating railway talents. The monthly allocation of funds by the road is necessary in fact. However, if the expenses of each school are lost and too strict, the school's facilities will be greatly abandoned. If there is no limit, then the use will be too wide, and it does not seem appropriate to be prudent with public funds. In order to unify authority and plan as a whole, it is proposed that the schools in the Shen-Luo section be managed by the Ministry of Railways, so that the procedures for allocating funds to the Rotary Schools under the jurisdiction of the Ministry can be followed. The school opens and sends a request to the Ministry, and the Ministry orders the road to allocate the funds as a reference for consistency and to avoid differences; (4) Subsidy for the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry School (5) Subsidy for the radio station. Since these expenses are subsidies, their fixed amount and period should be stipulated. It is currently found that the expenses of the radio station, starting from May 1928, were initially only 156 yuan, but have gradually increased. In October of last year, the most recent month, it actually allocated 1,600 yuan, a difference of ten times in two years. If there is no restriction, then the proportion will be sought, and in the future, it will not be known where it will end. How much is the actual monthly expense of the radio station? Please investigate nearby and list the minimum number of assistance funds and their time limit separately, seeking an appropriate number so that both parties can be considered in the assistance; (6) Expenses for Tao-Suo Road. It is found that there is no fixed date for this expense, and as much as 100,000 yuan is allocated per month. This long-term subsidy is really beyond the financial capacity of Beining. What is the progress of the road now? Please send the original case to the Ministry for review. The Ministry will reply accordingly. (June 11)</p>

<p>Changchun Korean Residents Forcibly Occupy Farmland Case</p>
<p>▲Result of Joint Sino-Japanese Investigation ▲Reason Considered Unjustifiable Jilin Communication: The case of Korean residents from Wanbao in the Third District of Changchun Township gathering a crowd to forcibly occupy rice paddies has been reported repeatedly in this newspaper after several rounds of negotiations without a result. It is now understood that the two sides have consulted and jointly sent personnel to investigate the truth before further negotiations. On the 11th of this month, the Japanese side sent Secretary Tsuchiya Namihei and Police Inspector Nakagawa Yoshiharu from the Changchun Japanese Consulate, as well as Kago tani Tamotsu, Chief of External Affairs at the Changchun Local Office of the South Manchuria Railway Company.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>○ On the Chinese side, Guo Chenghou, Head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Municipal Preparatory Office, and Wu Changchun, Director of the Changchun County Agricultural Association, jointly went to conduct an on-site investigation. The investigation has now been completed, and a report has been prepared on the facts of the dispute between the Korean residents cultivating rice paddies and the local farmers in Wanbao Mountain. (1) Contract for renting rice paddies: Hao Yongde, Manager of the Changchun Rice Paddy Company, rented approximately 500 "xiang" of barren and cultivated land from Xiao Hanlin, Zhang Hongbao, Meng Zhaowen, Ding Hui, Lu Zhaoshan, Jiang Yuanheng, Ren Fu, Wang Zhongfu, Meng Hui, Si Meng Huiwen, Jiang Shengyi, and Liu Zhenguo in the Third District of Changchun County on April 16th of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], for a term of ten years. The contract stipulated, "This contract shall take effect on the date of approval by the County Government. If the County Government does not approve, it shall remain invalid." This contract was never formally approved by the Changchun County Government. At the same time, Hao Yongde subleased the aforementioned approximately 500 "xiang" of barren and cultivated land to nine Korean residents: Li Shenghun, Li Zhaohe, Park Noseong, Li Xichang, Xu Longhao, Kim Dongseon, Shen Hengze, and Zheng Yuanze for cultivation, also for a term of ten years. This contract was also not submitted to the Changchun County Government for record. (2) Reasons for the landlords' and farmers' opposition: A. The excavation of the irrigation channel, which draws water from the Yitong River, occupies farmland along the way without a consensual contract with the landlords. Hao Yongde only rented 500 "xiang" of barren and cultivated land from Xiao Hanlin and others, while the channel excavated occupies farmland along the line, stretching over 20 "li." The landlords whose land is occupied are Ma Baoshan, Ma Wanshan, Sun Langxuan, Sun Yaquan, Ma Fushan, Ma Deshan, Sun Jiatong, Liu Changhai, Gong Shide, Li Jingsheng, Sun Yongbin, Wang Zuobin, Liu Changyou, Liu Changjiang, Zou Tailun, Han Desheng, Zou Yaoshan, Jiang Hongshan, Sun Wanyi, Sun Wanying, Sun Yongqing, Sun Wanzhong, Chang Zi'an, Tian Jun, Gong De, Cui Longzhou, Zhou He, Ma Youqing, Ma Zhenqing, Zhang Dianming, Huang Junxiang, Li Dafa, Zou Dajin, Cai Xibin, and Hou Delu – a total of 41 people. Initially, there was no contract between these landlords and Hao Yongde or the Korean residents Li Shenghun, etc. B. The damage caused by the aforementioned channel drawing water from the Yitong River to the landlords and farmers can be divided into approximately seven categories: 1. The soil excavated from the channel is piled on both sides to form dikes, approximately seven or eight "zhang" wide and over 20 "li" long, destroying over 40 "xiang" of fertile land. 2. The channel passes through areas of cultivated land, dividing the farmers' land into two sections. Farmers must detour with their tools and workers, resulting in unlimited losses of agricultural time and labor costs. 3. To draw water from the Yitong River to irrigate rice paddies, dams must be built across the existing river, forcing water into the channel. As a result of the dams obstructing the river, approximately 2,000 "xiang" of low-lying land on both sides of the upstream river will be flooded. 4. The area that Hao Yongde intends to rent for rice paddies is relatively high, with no place to discharge water, causing hundreds of "xiang" of downstream low-lying land to be flooded. 5. Low-lying areas on both sides of the channel will be flooded when the river rises, affecting approximately 4,000 to 5,000 "xiang." 6. The Majiashaokou of the river is the main passage for traffic to and from the west of the river. Due to the dams blocking the water in the river, the water level has risen, cutting off the old transportation between the east and west sides of the river. 7. The Yitong River is the necessary route for navigation and transportation in Changchun and Nong'an during the summer. The dams in the middle of the river, which are over ten "zhang" high, obstruct the public transportation routes of the two counties, and hundreds of households living along the river whose livelihoods depend on shipping are suffering losses. (3) Opinions of the investigation: The channel was excavated without the consent of the landlords or an agreed rental contract, which is an illegal act. The main reasons for the strong opposition of the landlords and farmers are: first, the ownership of the land occupied by the channel is being illegally infringed; second, the farmers' land is being divided into two sections by the channel, which greatly hinders cultivation; third, building dams in the middle of the Yitong River to block the water is causing water damage to thousands of "xiang" of farmland upstream and downstream; fourth, the Yitong River is a shipping river for Changchun and Nong'an during the summer, and it is absolutely impossible to build dams in the middle of the river to obstruct shipping. Based on the above facts, the actions infringe on the legal and inherent rights of the majority of landlords and farmers, and obstruct public shipping and transportation. No country would allow such behavior by people of any nationality. It is said that the Municipal Office has lodged a protest with the Japanese consulate based on the above report, requesting a swift withdrawal. (June 12)</p>

<p>▲Red Bandits Flee Toward Mabou and Liubo</p>
<p>Bengbu Communication: Jinjiazhai in the southwest of Lu'an County in Anhui Province has been occupied by Red bandits since last winter, for more than half a year. The stronghold has high mountains and dense forests and is strategically important, located approximately 240 "li" from Lu'an County and bordering the three provinces of Anhui, Henan, and Hubei. The Red bandits have built solid fortifications outside the stronghold for defense. Inside the stronghold, they have established a puppet organization, the Eastern Affairs Office of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Special Zone, with puppet commissioners Wang Yizhong, Du Xukai, and Zeng Zemin in charge of everything. Since Li Mingzhong, the Pacification Commissioner of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Region, moved to Huangchuan, he has been actively suppressing the Red bandits. Ji Hongchang's troops and Yue Shengxuan's division have repeatedly won victories in joint suppression operations. According to the staff office of the Fourth Sub-district Anti-Bandit Command of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Region in Lu'an, Song Runtian's brigade of Yue's division began attacking the Xiao Fang bandit gang on the 4th of this month. The Xiao gang was defeated by Song's brigade near Zhongjieling and fled back to Mabou. Ji Hongchang led his troops to attack Jinjiazhai starting on the 6th. The bandits initially resisted stubbornly, relying on the terrain, but after Ji's troops exerted strong pressure, the bandits were unable to withstand it and fled towards Mabou and Liubo. Ji's troops quickly occupied Jinjiazhai. In this battle, over a thousand bandits were killed, greatly demoralizing the bandit forces. According to reports, the bandit side transported grain and ammunition, and conscripted labor from every household, regardless of gender or age. Residents were unable to bear the trampling and were determined to automatically eradicate communism. The bandit area lacks food and ammunition and is showing signs of panic. Currently, the government troops have prepared sufficient forces and will launch an attack to sweep away the bandits' lair in the near future. (June 16)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Unprecedented Great Fire in Hefei, Anhui Province <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲Area Burned Covered Approximately Three "Li" ▲Thousands of Houses Destroyed ▲Over a Thousand Large and Small Shops ▲Losses Estimated at Several Millions Hefei Communication: A fire broke out at Liu Yufeng's general store on the upper section of West Gate Street's Sanxiaokou at approximately 11:00 AM on the 12th. Carelessly kindling tea on a "kang" ignited kerosene, paper, and other items, and the store's building was instantly engulfed. At the time, a strong westerly wind was blowing, and the flames jumped over Qingchang's artificial flower shop on the north side of the street and spread to Sanxiaokou, which is shaped like a cross. This area had many general stores and flammable materials, so the fire spread rapidly. It spread north to County Heng Street, south to Deshengmen Street, and east to Qian Street, burning in three directions. The sky and sun were red. Although water dragons arrived from all directions, the area was too large to effectively manage, and the Wanfu and Sipaifang water dragons were obstructed, making the fire even more intense. Li Mei, Deputy Commander of the 46th Division, Bai Xiaosong, Commander of the 271st Regiment, Hu Bichen, Deputy Commander of the Regiment, Zhang Shusen, County Magistrate, Xu Chun, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Liu Zepu, Head of the Merchants' Association, all personally led large contingents of military police to the scene to maintain order and direct firefighting. It wasn't until after 2:00 PM that the fires on County Heng Street and Desheng Street were extinguished. Unexpectedly, the wind fanned the flames, and the fire continued to spread eastward. By 3:00 PM, the houses in Renhe Lane, Liao Lane, Fuxue Street on the north side of the street, Tanhua Mansion, Jiangjunmiao Lane, and Liu Ancestral Hall were all affected. The fire was still raging, and military, government, and police officials, seeing that it was impossible to contain, ordered all city gates to be closed and ordered soldiers of the 46th Division to demolish the thatched houses in the Laoyoufang Lane and Sigu Lane area to cut off the fire line. The fire was finally extinguished at 5:00 PM. Subsequent investigations revealed that the burned area started from the upper section of Sanxiaokou, extending east to Hua Zushi, south to Laoyoufang Lane, east on County Qian Street to the Wang surname paper shop, west to the Zhou surname location, east on Deshengmen Street to the Ge surname rice shop in Dongfangma Lane, and west to the Chen surname location north of the Catholic Church. In total, thousands of houses and over a thousand merchants' households were burned, covering an area of approximately three "li," with losses of several million. In the disaster, an old woman surnamed Xi and two children surnamed Bai were burned to death, and one person was injured in a fall. Over a thousand poor disaster victims were exposed to the sun and dew, homeless and with nowhere to go. The cries shook the wilderness, a heartbreaking sight. Military, government, police agencies, and public organizations held a meeting on the 13th to discuss emergency relief to provide assistance. It was truly an unprecedented catastrophe in Hefei.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang Communication: Since the provincial capital moved to Zhenjiang, the population has gradually increased, commerce has become more prosperous, and municipal construction has also progressed. To commemorate the relocation of the provincial capital to Zhenjiang, the government decided to construct a memorial stele and held a groundbreaking ceremony yesterday (the 16th) at 4:30 PM. The Construction Department invited people from all walks of life to participate and widely solicited souvenirs. The Jiangsu Provincial Capital Construction Engineering Office hired workers to build two high platforms at the Dashikou intersection of Zhongshan and Zhongzheng Roads. After the participants gathered, Sun Hongzhe presided over the ceremony, performing the rituals. The chairman reported that since the relocation of the Jiangsu provincial capital to Zhenjiang, the plan to build a new provincial capital has not been fully completed due to economic and time constraints. However, progress has been made step by step and the city has taken some shape. In order to awaken the public's support to complete the great plan to build a new provincial capital, it was decided to build the Jiangsu Provincial Capital Construction Memorial Tower at the intersection of Zhongshan and Zhongzheng Roads at Dashikou, to make it eternal. The cost of the project is estimated to be over 3,000 yuan. Next, Ye Chucang gave a speech, stating that roads are built for the people, and this stele is also built to commemorate the people. He hoped that the people of Zhenjiang would work together to build more roads and more memorial towers. Li Songqiao then gave a speech. After the speeches, the ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned. (June 17)</p>

<p>Seducing a Woman Intercepted by Police: Zou Hanchang, the young owner of the Jixiangyun Perfume Shop in Zhongda Street, is habitually frivolous and has been seducing weak-willed women to go to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places for illicit relations. On the 16th, Zou seduced Ju Zhen (age 19), the daughter of a Gao surname from Banshan Bridge, to go to Shanghai. The girl's mother noticed and reported it to the Malu Public Security Substation, which dispatched police to intercept the two near the train station. They were taken to the County Public Security Bureau, where Director Qin briefly interrogated them. Because the case involved the seduction of a woman under the age of twenty, a formal document was prepared and sent to the County Government for investigation. Later, the girl's mother, concerned about her reputation, did not want to pursue the matter, and Zou was bailed out.</p>

<p>Large Quantity of Smuggled Salt Seized: Wu Mengxu and Chen Yao, deputy leaders of the Pujiang Patrol Team, recently learned that a large quantity of smuggled salt was passing through the territory. They led seven patrol boats to strengthen patrols. At approximately 1:00 AM on the 11th, they spotted eleven smuggled salt boats near Ganxiang Town. They went forward to seize them, but the salt smugglers on the boats opened fire and resisted arrest. The two sides engaged for several hours. The smugglers could not withstand it and jumped into the water to escape. The eleven smuggled salt boats were captured and taken to the Yexie Song Salt Main Warehouse to await legal proceedings. County Representatives Petition for Removal of Guard Post: The Fourth Congress of County Party Representatives in the county had 26 proposals. The congress convened this morning to discuss and pass them separately. The congress continued in the afternoon to discuss a proposal to remove the guard post built by the county government at the center of Qian Street. Representatives believed that there was no need to set up a guard post there, and it occupied the street, forcing vehicles and pedestrians to detour, which was extremely inconvenient. The business community in the area had repeatedly petitioned for its removal without success. With the unanimous support of all representatives, they went to the County Government at 4:00 PM to meet with County Magistrate Jin to petition for the immediate removal of the guard post in the middle of Qian Street to maintain traffic. The County Magistrate indicated that the building plan had been approved by the County Government Council at the time. Tomorrow is the date of the County Government Council meeting, and the representatives can submit written opinions. The matter will be submitted to the County Government Council for further decision. The representatives finally stated that it must be removed before they withdrew.</p>
<p>Prisoners from Cahejing Imprisoned in Songjiang: The Second Prison of Cahejing in Shanghai, due to extreme overcrowding, requested the High Court to allocate prisoners to various county prisons.

<p>Provincial Order to Borrow 500,000 in Emergency Funds: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance recently ordered Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other counties to borrow funds, using business tax revenue as collateral, because the entire province's security forces were owed pay and were urgently in need of funds. The treasury was empty and under great pressure. Wuxi's borrowing quota is 150,000 yuan. Upon receiving the order, County Magistrate Shen immediately consulted with the Chamber of Commerce and hosted a banquet for the banking industry to discuss borrowing methods. However, the business tax is being negotiated and promoted by both government and business, and the amount has not been determined. In addition, the silkworm cocoon harvest this year was very poor, and the market is extremely sluggish. Therefore, no decision has been reached after days of consultation. Yesterday, the county government received another telegram from the Provincial Department, requiring that the borrowing be negotiated and remitted to the provincial treasury within three days to meet emergency needs.</p>
<p>Bandits Tear Ticket on Gu Geng: Gu Wangqi, the former Tudong of Xicang near Gu Geng in the 10th District (North Xiasiang) of the county, was kidnapped by bandits some days ago and his whereabouts were unknown. A servant from Jiangyin in his family was suspected. The report was made to the police team stationed in the township, who arrested him and sent him to the city for interrogation. He confessed nothing. Rewards were posted everywhere in the township to find him. Yesterday, Gu's body was suddenly found at the foot of Songshan Mountain. He was indeed torn by the bandits. His family reported to the city for inspection.</p>
<p>Jiang Abing, a Notorious Bandit from Jiangyin, Arrested: Xu Zengxian's home in Nanli Lane, Changjing Town, on the border between Wuxi and Cheng, was suddenly visited by over ten bandits some nights ago, who searched and robbed them of over 500 yuan in silver dollars, as well as clothes and jewelry, with losses of approximately 1,000 yuan. After the incident, the Changjing Security Corps was reported and requested to pursue the bandits. The head of the corps, He Chongchao, sent personnel to investigate and learned that it was done by the notorious bandit Jiang Guangrong, nicknamed Ma Muzi Abing. They immediately divided up and pursued him. Yesterday, the bandit took the Licheng steamer to Wuxi, where he was met by corps members Wang Linsheng and Liu Bingzhi. After arriving at the dock, they reported it to the police and arrested him. They found four yuan in paper money, two letters with the words "Big Knife Society" written on them, a pawn ticket, and a wool single shirt (stolen goods from Xu's house) on him, which were all sent to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read a news item in your newspaper's foreign news section titled "Railway Police Department Investigates Case," which is completely contrary to the facts. On June 5th, when the No. 3 express train from Shanghai arrived at Xizhan Station, I was at the station supervising the work. I saw a man in a long gown loitering around, not resembling a passenger. To protect the travelers and prevent any harm, I instructed policeman Zhang Baoyu to pay attention and inquire. Officer Zhang replied that his name was Yang Chunxiang. Officer Zhang believed that I was suspicious because I didn't recognize Yang Chunxiang, so he said the name to avoid further inquiry. However, Yang Chunxiang, with a guilty conscience and feeling apprehensive, thought Zhang's words were unfavorable, so he started to verbally abuse Officer Zhang. Officer Zhang, unwilling to endure the insults, took Yang Chunxiang to the precinct. Even then, Yang Chunxiang pounded the table and chairs, creating a commotion. I moved him to the Public Security Bureau for handling as he was obstructing official duties. This is the factual account of what happened. As for the so-called "Zhang Baoyu fabricating accusations to Police Chief Feng, and Police Chief Feng arresting Yang without careful inquiry," I am not so foolish as to do such a thing. I am writing this letter specifically to request that it be published in the correspondence section, granting a correction to reveal the true facts. Fortunately, the other party has already filed a lawsuit in court, which should resolve the matter according to the law, and the truth will not be difficult to reveal. Respectfully, I wish the editor good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e87">Opening of Zhejiang Local Education Administration Conference <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>▲ Opening ceremony held in the morning, chaired by Zhang Nanxian.</p>
<p>▲ Academic lectures and visits to two exhibitions in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department convened a local education administration conference at 9 a.m. on the 16th in the hall of the department, gathering education directors from various counties and section chiefs from city education bureaus. Attendees included Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Nanxian, Construction Department Director Shi Ying, Zhejiang Provincial Party Department Representative Ye Suzhong, Zhejiang University Representative Yu Ziyi, Education Department Secretary Qian Jiazhi, Hangzhou City Education Section Chief Chen Chengren, and more than fifty education directors from various counties, including Hong Yun. After the ritual led by Chairman Zhang Nanxian, Chairman Zhang delivered an opening speech, stating that holding the local education administration conference today is very important. As Director Zhang is attending the Fifth Plenary Session and has not yet returned to Hangzhou, I have taken the seat on behalf of him. I believe that education and administration are closely related. Those who handle these affairs must identify their goals and go all out. The current social situation is extremely complex. If education fails to get on track or is not handled properly, it could affect the entire situation. Therefore, administrators should take more responsibility and not be negligent. Educational administrators are in a position to guide and supervise. They should have a thorough understanding of the actual situation of various educational aspects and not only consider raising funds as their only capability. When opinions or disagreements arise, they should proactively seek ways to resolve them and eliminate them before they become visible. The quality of education in a province depends on whether the education directors are competent. The current state of education in our country tends toward abnormal development. Rural primary schools are often few in number. I hope that the education directors will pay attention to this point and use propaganda methods to make local people aware of the importance of educating their children, turning negative influences into positive forces to jointly promote educational progress. The implementation of policies should be based on the actual conditions of the local area for more effective results. For example, in rural communities, attention should be paid to agricultural education so that children, after receiving education, have a close relationship with the local area (integrating education with society to achieve the purpose of education as life). How to design and advance local education is what I hope everyone will study together. General meetings often have many proposals. During the meetings, there is much fanfare, but there is no in-depth study. Proposals are rashly passed and the discussion results are printed into booklets and distributed, which is considered done. This kind of self-deception defeats the purpose of the meeting. I hope that everyone attending this meeting will treat the local situation with the attitude of parents, do their best for the local children, and jointly study and discuss it. Then, Qian Jiazhi delivered a speech on behalf of the Education Department Director, followed by speeches by Ye Suzhong, Feng Keshu, Chen Chengren, Shen Baotang, Wang Tianze, Tong Pengchao, Yu Chenghu, Chen Weihan, Sun Ruihuan, and others. The speeches were too long to be recorded in full. The morning session adjourned after 12 o'clock. In the afternoon, at 1:30, an academic lecture was held. The speaker was Zheng Yaocang, and the topic was a general view of primary school education in various schools seen in Shanghai. The lecture lasted about an hour, and the audience was satisfied. After the lecture, everyone identified themselves as members of the group meeting, which was divided into five groups: education administration, education funding, school education, social education, and others. After the identification, the whole group set off to Yunsihe Xiaxue Palace to visit the Hangzhou City Education Equipment Exhibition and the Hang County Common Sense Science Teaching Exhibition.</p>

The ministry forwarded the request to the League of Nations for consideration. Later, a letter was received from League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating that the League's Committee on Intellectual Cooperation would carefully consider the methods for promoting academic communication between the League of Nations and China.

Regarding the proposals from China, the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation will review the three points mentioned in the special letter during or around the annual meeting. Preliminary discussions have been made: (1) Regarding the selection of famous professors to give lectures, such as in medicine, natural sciences, and political law, etc., the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation has been asked to consult with famous universities in Europe. After receiving a report, joint discussions can be held with the Chinese government and the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. (2) Regarding the proposal from National Central University to send one professor each for British literature, geography, and geology to the school to hold lectures, the committee is currently consulting with schools and will follow the school's limited nationality of professors and the fixed amount of remuneration indicated in the special letter. (3) Regarding the scope of the League of Nations' cultural movement cooperation projects, such as the work reports of the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation and the Educational Activities Photography Institute, especially those that can be used as a reference for joint cooperation between China and the League of Nations, the committee has already sent the general outline of the regulations of the Institute to the relevant department. It is hoped that it will be sent to China in the near future. The cultural cooperation organs of the League of Nations expressed their welcome to the proposals from China and showed their support in promoting the cultural progress of China and the League of Nations and in promoting communication between Chinese and Western academics.</p>

<p>▲ For not submitting exhibits to the Arithmetic Teaching Aids Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau yesterday issued an order reprimanding He Po Elementary School and 22 other schools, stating that the Bureau organized the Arithmetic Teaching Aids Exhibition to improve arithmetic teaching in various schools and increase children's interest in learning. It was included in the Bureau's 19th year policy plan, and the methods had already been notified. The number of exhibits was not strictly limited, and subsidies were provided for the production of the products. All were recorded and checked in advance. At this gathering, most schools actively participated, but this school did not submit any exhibits, which is considered a disregard for official orders. It is conceivable that they are usually negligent in research. It is appropriate to reprimand them in order to encourage them in the future. This is the order.</p>

<p>Since the China Merchants Bureau was reorganized by the National Government, Zhao Tieqiao, the former director-general, established a nautical science college at the original China Merchants Public School in Tilanqiao to cultivate nautical talents and develop China's shipping industry. The first graduating class was employed on ships, and the second graduating class will soon be on board for practical training this term. Last year, during the tenure of Commissioner Li Zhonggong, the bureau was nationalized and should have been further developed for domestic shipping affairs and the cultivation of specialized nautical talents. Last winter, the educational departments of various provinces were separately sent letters to continue recruiting 180 preparatory students, divided into three departments: navigation, marine engineering, and business. The specialized school was renamed the State-Operated China Merchants Bureau Maritime College. This year, the preparatory students will graduate and enter the undergraduate program during the summer vacation. Guo Waifeng, the newly appointed commissioner, intends to announce the closure of the school due to the bureau's financial constraints. Upon hearing this news, the students of the school panicked and elected representatives to visit Commissioner Guo to request that he withdraw the decision and continue operating the school. However, no satisfactory results were obtained. It is reported that they will organize a school protection movement, submit a petition to the National Government, issue a declaration, and request assistance from all parties.</p>

<p>▲ Opening During Summer Vacation to Benefit the Public</p>
<p>The East Asia Physical Education School is striving to expand and improve, and recently constructed a swimming pool for student practice. As previously reported, the school authorities have completed the pool and equipped it with bathrooms, changing rooms, and offices. On weekdays, there are many students, with separate classes for men and women, which is very suitable. They cannot provide training to outsiders, but during the summer vacation, they will only recruit a short-term scout instructor training class. The number of people is relatively small. In addition to supplying the students of that class, they also plan to open it for two months starting July 1st, so that the general public can have the opportunity to practice. They also plan to gather swimming athletes from Shanghai to hold a championship competition, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e106">A Record of the Memorial Service for General Lu Shidi <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>It has been almost half a year since the death of General Lu Xiqing. Comrades in Shanghai, remembering their old friendship, held a memorial service at the Buddhist Jingye Society on Hedder Road on the 14th of this month to express their condolences. Here is what I saw and heard, recorded and sent to Free Talk, to inform all comrades who did not attend that day.</p>
<p>I went at 1 p.m. that day. After getting out of the car, the tall, cloud-piercing white archway at the entrance came into view. A horizontal plaque hung on it, reading "Memorial Service for General Lu Xiqing of the Army." Next to it was a red satin inscription presented by Commander-in-Chief Chiang, about ten feet high, adorned with a colorful pavilion. After entering and signing in, each person was given a piece of black gauze and a white paper flower. There were hundreds of memorial banners and elegiac couplets hanging on both sides. Here are some that I remember: Mayor Zhang sent a scroll with a five-character ancient poem, which read: "At seven years old, his reputation grew. In his prime, he showed outstanding achievements. His heart was filled with the idea of serving the country. He was a model for our Party. Who would have thought that he was ill in bed, and suddenly he passed away. Alas, you died young. How hasty your departure was! The wind and clouds are tragic, and the sun is setting in the west. A strong hawk soared into the sky, but broke its heaven-reaching wings. A huge fish migrated from the sea, but lost its strength in the middle of the journey. Sad cries come from the sea, and the hub of power turns pale. Posthumous awards honor past glory, and posthumous honors show final adornments. Relatives and friends share the same grief, and the streets and alleys are filled with sorrow. My friendship with you was especially deep, and my sadness is truly endless. We gather together to summon your soul, and my tears flow freely as I write." Commander Xiong's elegy read: "The cuckoo cries for five nights, sadly seeing the great star destroy the general." "Half a lifetime in the saddle, the history books should record his great achievements." The entrance to the auditorium was decorated with white ribbons, and a horizontal plaque with the four characters "Model Party Member" hung above it, presented by 72 Party members from Sichuan, including Wang Xujiu and Lv Dan'ai. Inside the room, a white satin embroidered curtain hung high, with a portrait of General Lu in the center, smiling kindly, without any military air. On the sacrificial table were sixteen tall basins filled with tea, snacks, and fruits, as well as a vegetarian feast and two vases of fresh flowers. The walls were covered with elegiac couplets from Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Yu Youren, and Xie Chi, all lamenting his extraordinary talent and revolutionary ideas, and regretting his early death, which was a misfortune for the Party and the country. Dozens of wreaths were piled up on the ground, looking like a flower mound from a distance. Kneeling to the left of the stage were the filial sons, only four or five years old. General Lu's sisters, Ms. Han Shu and his younger brother, Shi Zhuan, all wore white clothes and Buddhist beads around their necks, with sorrowful expressions on their faces. Chairman Chiang originally planned to attend the memorial service in person, but he was going to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits and was preparing to leave soon, so he could not spare the time. Therefore, he sent Yang Hu, a military attaché of the National Government, as his representative. During the ceremony, he first offered flowers, then fruit, and finally food, and then read the eulogy. The text was very sad, with phrases such as "Alas, the jade is broken and the orchid is withered, the country is devastated, and the excellence remains immortal, the coffin is hidden in the ground." General Lu was loyal and upright, with profound knowledge and foresight. He dedicated himself to the revolution in the late Qing Dynasty and followed the Premier for more than ten years, rushing about for national affairs and enduring hardships. When Chen Jiongming betrayed the Premier, General Lu united his troops and recovered Guangzhou, a great achievement. To sum up his life, he devoted himself to the Party and the country, and remained loyal to his principles from beginning to end. Even in his illness, he did not forget national affairs and often wrote thousands of words to Chairman Chiang, silently supporting military strategies and harmonizing Party views. When he was seriously ill and lacked medical expenses, his comrades raised funds to help him, which shows his integrity throughout his life. His name was Lu Shidi, and his courtesy name was Xiqing. He was from Chengdu, Sichuan. He served as the commander of the Third Army directly under the Central Government, a senator in the Military Advisory Council, and a member of the Sichuan Provincial Government. He died at the age of only forty-five. Therefore, when his life was briefly reported that day, all the comrades present sighed that a wise man had withered. I returned and wrote this to express my condolences.</p>

<p>— Mou Keque</p>
<p>When two people are in love but are constrained by their circumstances and cannot marry openly, elopement is the last resort. However, this is only when both parties are passionately in love and do not consider that one day the truth will come out. Elopement values speed, which is inevitable. Today, science is flourishing, and the sailboats and horse-drawn carriages of the past are gradually becoming outdated and are being replaced by steam engines. Since the invention of airplanes that can soar in the sky, the speed of steam engines pales in comparison. Therefore, postal workers and travelers are relying on airplanes for speed. Everything is modernizing, so why can't elopement be fashionable? However, since the beginning of aviation in our country, no one has ever eloped by airplane. The following story is truly a new record for elopement. If Hong Fu knew about it in the afterlife, she would be ashamed of herself.</p>
<p>To the east of Songjiang is Sijing Town. The town is densely populated and is the leading town in Songjiang Prefecture. Gu Yushang was born there. He graduated from a law school and is now a trainee judge at the Shanghai District Court. His wife, Fei Guoying, is from Xinqiao Town, twelve miles from Sijing. She is beautiful and wealthy. Since their marriage,</p>
<p>their relationship has been quite close. However, three years ago, Gu met a woman named Zhong and took her as a concubine. Since then, conflicts arose between the wife and the concubine, and Zhong soon passed away. Gu had previously been a trial judge in Qidong County. This spring, he was transferred to Changshu. At that time, a clerk named Gui Jianhong was also a clerk in Changshu. Gu and his wife stayed in the county government office, and Gui entered their rooms freely. Fei and Gu's love affair began. At first, Gu did not know, so the secret affair continued. Before long, Gu was transferred to the Shanghai District Court and took his family with him. The pair of lovebirds were separated. However, the more love is suppressed, the more it grows. To suddenly stop it would cause a backlash. Fei asked her husband to go to Yu to study, but she actually stayed with Gui in the Daxin Hotel on Qianjie Street in Changshu. Her husband found out and they fled to Shanghai together. One day, Gu met them at the Jiangsu Hotel and questioned them severely, revealing the secret. The next day, he took her back to Sijing and beat her severely, causing her serious injuries. He then locked her in a room, cutting her off from the world. Her paternal aunt, who was over sixty years old, found out and secretly released her. Fei took her jewelry and went to the Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai, where she boarded a plane and flew away. She went from Beijing to Wuxi, and from Wuxi to Yu, hoping to be with her lover for the rest of her life. Her husband tracked her down, but she had already disappeared. It is now said that Fei has been arrested in Songjiang, and Gu has filed a lawsuit in the local court and is about to go to court. The storm in the sea of love is just beginning.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Discussing the Efficacy of Stinky Water in Preventing Epidemics <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Wulu</p>
<p>The air is dry in the summer, and germs spread very quickly. If preventive measures are not taken early, epidemics will arise and cause future troubles.</p>
<p>The harm is truly not insignificant.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, no fewer than several thousand people die each year due to epidemics in the summer. The reason for this is that people do not know how to prevent them. Therefore, knowledgeable people should pay attention to summer hygiene and purchase antiseptic solution as soon as possible to eliminate the foul air and eradicate infectious germs in the air. This will allow them to rest easy. Antiseptic stinky water contains a large amount of carbolic acid. If it is used to sprinkle indoors, in kitchens, on ditches, in wall corners, in latrines, in chamber pots, and in dirty places, mosquitoes, flies, and germs will be eradicated, and toxins will have no way to spread. Therefore, stinky water is of great help to summer epidemic prevention work. However, the annual demand is very large, and purchasing foreign goods results in the loss of rights. I have heard that the Yalin antiseptic stinky water produced by the Wuzhou Pharmacy's own factory has very complete manufacturing equipment and is made with German equipment, so the products are excellent and reliable. I would like to introduce it to readers, because in the name of epidemic prevention, I am also promoting domestic goods.</p>
<p>▲ News from the Art World: The Fudan University Photography Society has been established for several years. The exquisite results of the three exhibitions will be compiled into an annual publication. The volume is prefaced by prefaces from famous figures Hu Boxiang and Zhu Shourentian, and inscriptions from Zhu Yingpeng, Zhang Zhenhou, Lang Jingshan, Li Denghui, Hu Bozhou, and Chen Qiucao, which makes it even more valuable. The content is rich, with as many as sixty-six fine art works. The editors are Zhao Yun, Zhang Mingguang, Cao Zuguang, and Xu , from the Society. Xu Huijun, a graduate of the University, and Chen Bingde, the director of physical education, strongly supported it, so its results can be regarded as representative photographic works of the student era.

<h3 id="e110">Cultural Movements the Capital Should Undertake in the Future (Part 2) <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>The holding of this Capital Art Exhibition has given people a very good impression. In the future, I hope that the educational and administrative organs of the capital and all those who are concerned about cultural undertakings will pay attention to art museums, which are even more necessary than exhibitions, and promote their realization. Exhibitions are temporary and are essential to promoting modern art. Art museums are permanent and are essential to promoting and preserving the spirit of our country's past art. Furthermore, the main purpose of art museums has the following two points.</p>
<p>(1) Enhance the Status of Contemporary Art: Our country's art, whether it is painting, sculpture, music, craftsmanship, etc., has been brilliant in history and has a considerable status in itself. Even other countries praise China's past art in unison. However, in modern times, it has declined. The reason for this decline is that recent writers lack in-depth research, especially during the research period, there is a lack of deep knowledge of the techniques of the ancients. In the past, domestic collectors were unwilling to show their masterpieces to others easily. Therefore, it was very difficult for researchers to obtain references. Because of the lack of references, their understanding was not profound. If their understanding is not profound, they will produce crude and shoddy works. Therefore, Chinese art is gradually declining. Art researchers in various countries, when exploring techniques, all linger in art museums, learning from ancient research to produce emerging art of the times. This is a necessary process. By reviewing the old, we know the new, and creation is also based on this. With the lure of the ancients in history, there will be progress for future generations. No one will be born a creator. They must know the path of learning from good temptations and enter the palace of art through the path of learning. The establishment of art museums not only preserves the authority of inherent art, but also enhances the status of contemporary art.</p>
<p>(2) Expand the Status of International Art: Art is the flag of culture and the darling of the times. If art is not vibrant, culture will decline. Whether or not a country's art progresses depends entirely on the direction of the art of the times. When foreigners set foot on our land and see the facilities of art museums, they can ponder in them. This is most likely to give travelers a good impression. International art promotion is indeed based on this. To compete for international status, although it contains various facilities, the organization of art and its promotion to the outside world is truly powerful. In recent years, the Japanese have been promoting Eastern culture to Europe at the cost of huge sums of money, sparing no effort. People of all countries have considerable sympathy for the Japanese. Looking back at our country, we are lagging behind and are overshadowed by the Japanese. According to Japanese art, it originated in our country. Therefore, today we must have considerable publicity internationally. The first step in promoting art internationally is to organize our own works of art. Organizing the inherent essence and establishing an art museum is an urgent matter.</p>

<p>(4) The Athlete's Revenge</p>
<p>From that day on, Zhang Xiaosan became a soldier. After becoming a soldier, he realized that it was not as comfortable as he had imagined. Just learning how to march, he was beaten twenty or thirty times. When he was a rickshaw puller, he could run or argue back when the police beat him. Now, the platoon leaders and squad leaders who taught him drills slapped him so hard that he wasn't even allowed to move. The filial piety of sons to their fathers in the world can never be that reverent. What was it for? For six big dollars a month in salary. This six dollars was originally calculated by discounting ten dollars. But now, even the discounted amount cannot be paid. Zhang Xiaosan had been a soldier for four months and had only received two dollars. He used to earn that much pulling a rickshaw in a single day. However, riding the streetcar for free, listening to operas for free, and going to brothels for free were all facts. He had tried them all several times. This day was a beautiful day with clear autumn skies. The military camp had a half-day holiday. The platoon leader took them out of the city to visit the Sanbeizi Garden for free. When they returned, everyone rode the streetcar for free, heading straight from Xizhimen to Qianmen. But when the streetcar reached the Nongshangbu Street intersection, it broke down. It suddenly stopped. Those who had paid to ride the streetcar had to accept their bad luck. These young gentlemen were a little impatient. Two of them had already opened the window and leaned out to look. They saw a large crowd gathered in the middle of the street. According to the onlookers, four or five rickshaw pullers were fighting each other. It was going to be a matter of life and death. When the soldiers heard this, they thought, "It's no wonder the streetcar driver didn't want to drive." Everyone got off the streetcar and went forward to watch. They saw three policemen squeezing into the crowd of fighting people, shouting, "Stop fighting! Stop fighting! Everyone go to the police station!" As they spoke, they struck the entangled fighters with their batons. A soldier cursed, "Damn, the black dogs are unreasonable. Why are they hitting people too?" Zhang Xiaosan remembered being beaten with a police baton on Nongshangbu Street in the past. Immediately, sparks flew in his heart. His eyes widened, and he cursed, "Damn it! They always make trouble for rickshaw pullers. Good boy! You try moving me now! I'll beat you until you eat shit!" The policemen maintaining order and the soldiers defending the country were each doing their own duty. No one would have thought that there would be any hatred. Moreover, the policemen and soldiers both belonged to the armed class.</p>

<p>Marked Gold Shows Slight Health</p>
<p>▲ Prohibition of Pre-Sale Swap: Yesterday, the 17th, the marked gold price was stable, with a slight upward trend. Only about five taels were reviewed throughout the day. The total increase was more than two taels. The silver market rebounded, but the opening price was high. It is said that Citibank was selling silver, and the market sentiment seemed firm. However, there was not much trading in the market, and the price fluctuated from time to time. The exchange rate was stable domestically, but the gold price rose slightly in the later market, and was later at 804 taels. It is predicted that the silver market may turn lower this morning. There are still more than 30,000 swaps that have not been completed, but only about 20,000 spot contracts. Therefore, multiple parties are putting pressure on short sellers, which raised the price to more than four taels yesterday. It is known that the joint funds of Guangbang Hengxing have not yet been swapped for about 20,000 contracts, and Daxing, Yongyuanmao, Yongdeng, etc. have not yet been swapped for about 12,000 or 13,000 contracts. There are also 1,000 or 2,000 contracts from other companies, and the short sellers are mostly retail investors. Recently, swaps have not been opened privately in advance according to the date set by the exchange. Therefore, the authorities of the exchange believe that this hinders the rules, especially disrupting the market. Therefore, they have notified all brokers yesterday that they must not open in advance in the future, otherwise the exchange will not accept the accounts.</p>
<p>▲ High Opening Price at the Beginning: The opening price in early August increased by 1.8 qian, to 802.7 taels. The large contracts increased by 1/16, the silver price increased by 1/8, and the private telegrams increased by 3/16. However, market sentiment was still good, and Dadecheng, Zhifeng, Yongjuchang, etc. continued to buy in, with an increase of more than one tael. The price rose from 0.18 taels to 0.3 taels, but Yongfeng, Cuichang, Yongwupin, etc. sold out, and the price fell back to 800 taels. Fuxing, Yongwanxing, Chunyuan, Yongshunli, etc. followed up, and the price immediately rose by four taels, to 0.4 taels. Hengyu, Qianchang, Xiangyuanmao, Yongdeng, etc. sold out, and the price was suppressed by more than two taels. When the market</p>
<p>was first ordered to be announced, the price was 2.4 qian, and the quoted price remained the same. When it was almost ten o'clock, it was only 1.6 qian, but there were few exchange transactions. Soon, Hengxing, Shengda, Wanxing, and Wupin came in, and the price rose to 0.323 qian. Chengfeng, Yongtong, Taichang, Shunli, Wanxing sold out, and the price fell by more than three taels. The British gold price was 3125, which was not easy to sell. Therefore, at 10:30, it fell to 800 taels for the second time. After that, Zhengjin, Taiwan, etc. absorbed 3125 to 375, and Hengxing, Yuanxing, Yongdeng, etc. bought in, at 11:0267 qian. Zhifeng, Yong, Qianchang, Xiangfeng, Fuyu, etc. sold out again, and the price fell back to 800 taels. After 11:20, Yuanmaoyong, Yuancheng, Yong and Wupin entered the hedge, and the price tended to rise. At noon, it was 0.36 taels, but the closing price was 0.3 taels, and it was done to 2.45 qian. The zero households sold out, but the Dalian gang bought in. The revealed price was still 838.2 taels, with a pressure of 36 or 37 taels to 34 or 45 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Stable Changes in the Later Market: The opening price in the later market was 0.31 qian. The Indian exchange rate went down a little, and then increased to 0.45 taels. Suddenly, it rose back by one anna, and then fell to 0.289 qian. After 2:30, Longsheng, Fuyu, Tianyu, Yongdeng, etc. bought in, and the price increased by more than two taels. At around 3:30, it was 0.5 taels. Afterwards, it seemed that the downstream was more than one tael, but the transaction was small and the market sentiment was unstable. In a moment, there was more than one tael up and down. At around 4:00, it was 0.35 taels and then 0.467 qian, complex and changeable. At 4:30, the market closed at 0.33 qian, which was suppressed by the retail short sellers. Compared with the previous day, it rose back by 2.4 qian, and was raised to 0.4 taels again. The maximum price throughout the day was 805 taels, and the minimum price was 800 taels.</p>
<p>There was a difference of 5 taels. The Wupin price was 0.3 taels, the noon closing price was 2.5 taels, the afternoon price was 3.2 qian, and the closing price was 4.3 qian. The announced price was pressed down by 34 or 45 taels, and the account was 0.6 taels in July and 0.3 taels in August. The supplementary water for the whole day was 6 taels. ▲ Transactions Were Sparse: Transactions of various companies were not prosperous. Juchang, Yuhe, Yuantai, Hengxing, Yuanheng, Xinheng, Chunyuan, Yuanxingyong all bought in. Shunli, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Chengfengyong, Hengyu all had more supply than demand. Yuanmaoyong, Yuankangxiang, Futaiheng, Dadecheng, Daxingyong, Fuyu, Yuanchengyong made gains and losses, but the amount was not much. In the afternoon, Chengfengyong, Longsheng, Yuantai, Fuyu all bought in. Wanxing, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu had occasional inflows and outflows. Tianyuyong bought in slightly, Yuanxingyong, Chunyuanyong, and Tongtaichang sold out slightly. The Guangdong gang bought 300 or 400 contracts, the Dalian gang sold more than 1,000 contracts, and then bought hundreds of contracts.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Dull Foreign Exchange Transactions <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US Indian silver market reported rises, but the Shanghai market remained stable and unmoved. HSBC's quoted prices for various exchange rates remained unchanged. The actual transaction prices of banks were initially firm and then stable. The gold market rose slightly, so the noon closing price was slightly lower than the previous day, with the British gold rate shrinking by 0.0625, the US exchange rate shrinking by 0.125, and the Japanese gold rate rising by 0.25. In the afternoon, due to Wednesday, there was no market as usual. The gold industry transactions were normal, with about 100,000 pounds of British gold being sold, and some Chinese and Japanese banks absorbing it. However, British merchants had fewer inflows and outflows, and Chinese merchants were mostly long. However, because the swap became a long position, the short gold rate was pushed higher, which was not cost-effective and was a big loss. There were very few US dollar transactions, and the Dalian gang resold tens of thousands of yuan of Japanese gold. Currently, Dalian tickets are all being absorbed by Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange: The domestic market rate was 0.0625. The bid price in the morning was one shilling, two pence and twenty-five, and the buying price was 3125. The forward rates were all 0.0625 higher or lower. Transactions were quiet in the early morning. After 10 o'clock, Zhejiang, Taiwan,</p>
<p>bought July 3125, and Pangen bought August 3125. Subsequently, Taiwan, Shanghai, Zhengjin, and Zhejiang bought July and August 3125 to 375. The noon closing bid price was similar to that of the morning market. There was a lack of market in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ US Exchange: The domestic market rate was 0.125 up and down. The early market near-term price was 28.9375 yuan, the buying price was 29.0625 yuan, and the forward rate was 0.0625 to 0.125 higher. The noon closing price was 28.875 yuan for near-term, the buying price was 29 yuan, the forward bid price was 29 yuan, and the buying price was 29.125 yuan.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's telegram from London, the spot silver price has rebounded again, with both near and far-term prices increasing by 0.0625, both to 12 pence and 375/1000.

<p>▲Market Overview: Recently, due to the gradual decline in the use of spot funds, apart from interbank trading, transactions with other parties have been suspended for a long time. Therefore, there is no possibility of a turnaround in the price of foreign interest rates. Although it has fluctuated somewhat in recent days, it has ultimately declined. In terms of money supply, after the banking sector slightly absorbed funds a few days ago, it has gradually risen.</p>
<p>▲Interest and Call Loan Rates: "Foreign interest rates" opened lower due to slack market sentiment,</p>
<p>with strong selling pressure. The closing price was 7 qian 2 fen 5.5 li, down 7 hao from the previous day's opening price. (Yesterday afternoon's interest rate was actually 7 qian 2 fen 6 li 2 hao and 5 hu, and the reported 6 li 3 hao and 75/1000 was incorrect, and we urgently correct it.) The afternoon market improved by 1 hao and 2 hu and 5/10, to 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 6 hao 2 hu and 5/10. The trend is downward. "Silver call loan rates" were 7 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, up 1 fen from the previous day. The premium for head loans also improved by 1 or 2 fen, calculated at 7.8 fen. It even reached 8.9 fen at the end. ▲Subsidiary Coin Market: The early market price for Jiangnan minor silver coins was 6 qian 4 fen 7 li. The afternoon market remained the same price due to no transactions, down 0.5 li from the previous day. The number of transactions was 2,000 jiao in the morning market. The early market price for Guangdong minor silver coins was 6 qian 4 fen 3 li and 2.5 hao. The afternoon market price was 6 qian 4 fen 3 li and 7.5 hao. The number of transactions was 80,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by another 1,500 wen, to 379,000 wen. ▲Silver and Foreign Silver Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds": Yesterday's news about bank collections totaled 2.23 million for Chinese merchant drafts, 1.56 million for foreign merchant drafts, over 2 million for special drafts, and 9.89 million for various goods, exchange taxes, and other collections.

<p>Yesterday, spot trading of public bonds remained scarce, while the futures market remained active.</p>
<p>Although buying was not quiet in the morning, the trend was still weak due to continued selling by a certain party, continuing to fall from the previous day. The price suddenly rebounded sharply in the afternoon with large purchases, and the momentum did not weaken until the close. Only the "20 Customs" slightly relaxed at the closing. As a result, the "Disbandment of Troops July" rebounded by 1.8 yuan, and the "June" and "19 Customs June" also rose by approximately 1 yuan. Other bonds fluctuated up and down,</p>
<p>numbering only about half a yuan, totaling over 2,200 yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Standard Yarn Rises, Stimulated by Strong Spot Sales</p>
<p>Real cotton sales remain robust, with enthusiastic participation from all parties. Factories are struggling to keep up with demand, and the intake of goods by the Tianjin, Sichuan, and Guangdong groups is particularly strong. As a result, market sentiment has been greatly shaken, and the long-brewing standard yarn market, with coarse yarn remaining stagnant, has been suppressed by sellers, hovering around 60 taels. Now, with continuous spot demand and rising American cotton prices, sellers have become indecisive and have actively sought to cover their short positions. The market has soared by over 2 taels. This situation was previously reported in this newspaper. Given the current situation, the price in August may exceed 170 taels.</p>
<p>▲Standard Yarn Rises by 2 Taels and 6.7 Qian: In the early market, the standard yarn opened higher due to rising American cotton prices and strong spot yarn business, with prices rising by 1.2, 3, and 4 qian for various months.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, hearing that spot demand was strong and large traders were covering short positions, prices rose by 1.3, 4, 5, and 7 qian for various months. The total number of transactions was 64,700 bales. Tai Xing sold 2,300 bales, Rui Da 750 bales, and Shen Chang 1,150 bales.</p>

Japanese merchants are purchasing, and at the same time, yarn prices are rising sharply, making the situation even tighter. Prices are up 6 or 7 qian for various months.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Standard: Large Traders Cover Short Positions In the early market, the Hankou standard cotton price rose by 3 or 4 qian, excluding outside cotton.

<p>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factory Silk Quotes Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market gradually showed a firm rise, due to rising silk prices in overseas markets. Shanghai white factory silk gradually saw a turnaround in Shanghai, and European firms actively covered their short positions. As factory costs were heavy, they insisted on selling only at higher prices. Yesterday, it was estimated that Lien and others imported 50 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, with prices rising sharply by 5 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Current State of Summer Silkworms in Chang'an is Still Good <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Due to the poor spring cocoon harvest this year, silkworm farmers in the Chang'an area of Zhejiang province have suffered losses. Many have started to raise summer silkworms to compensate. The silkworm eggs are strong. After hatching, the weather has been sunny and warm, and the conditions have been good. The early batch has already completed its third molt and started eating leaves. The earlier rainstorm had some ill effects on the silkworms. The later batches of silkworms are still young, with little impact. Instructors are currently trying to remedy the situation. Fortunately, the weather cleared up yesterday, and the current state is still good.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Lu Zhuang's Fine Eyebrow Tea Sees Slight Movement in European Sales <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, the fine eyebrow green tea from Wudong and Tunxi in the Lu Zhuang area began to be searched for again due to telegram inquiries received last week. However, merchants' price requests remained harsh, and sales were not widespread. The situation is still difficult to consider good. Although the needle eyebrow and bud eyebrow teas have seen slight activity, the market has also failed to improve. Gao Zhuang's Gongxi and Baitou Zhuang's Fulin</p>
<p>and Qianyi firms have all made purchases. However, the Russian Aid Association, which has a large sales network,</p>
<p>has not yet completed the procedures for last year's purchases of Gongxi tea.</p>
<p>Discussions about opening new goods are currently difficult to make. This point is a very important key to the future of green tea.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Fine Twill Suddenly Surges: Local Cotton Cloth: Sanpin surges, market sentiment is firm and rising, with fine twill being the strongest, showing a tendency to soar. The reason is that the Guangdong groups are actively purchasing, and it is also cheaper than fine cloth. Speculators are all seeking to hoard it, and the price has risen uniformly by a significant amount. Yanghe is selling for 7 taels 6 qian 2 fen and 5 li, and Blue Double Fish is 7 taels 5 qian 2 fen and 5 li.</p>
<p>Squirrel is 7 taels and 5 fen. Fine cloth is increasingly scarce. Trumpet Boy and Colored Ball have already been cleared at 7 taels and 7 qian. Blue Chicken is 7 taels and 5 qian 5 fen, and Blue Flying Fish is 8 taels and 5 fen. However, coarse twill is not only not rising, but Three Fish, Three Rabbit, and Cat and Eagle are all lackluster, due to the quiet sales channels.</p>
<p>▲East and West Piece Goods: Market conditions are increasingly trending upward. The Yuan Yu silk,</p>
<p>Bamboo Forest Qingguan Mirror of eastern goods have all reached 12 taels 2 qian and 5 fen. Fine serge is also gradually rising. Huxinting is 3 qian 4 fen and 7 li and 5 hao, Sanyou Tu is 3 qian 3 fen and 7 li and 5 hao. Gongsun Tu of lower garment goods has also been cleared at 3 qian and 1 fen. Sales to Sichuan groups remain smooth. Changsha groups replenished a large batch yesterday, but the attitude of the Tianjin group is slightly calmer, as they have already been hoarding in Osaka. This is why the Sanpin price suddenly rose yesterday. The demand for Yuehua velvet by the Sichuan group is very strong, with over 500 pieces traded yesterday. Medium stem is 2 qian 4 fen and 7 li and 5 hao, and large stem is 2 qian and 5 fen and 5 hao. Black flower is out of stock. Yuan Yu silk, Tai Xi satin, and Ruler Six Yuan velvet of western goods are all scarce, and there is a risk of future stockouts.</p>
<p>Grain: He Xia Rice Market is Gradually Firm</p>
<p>▲Xin Zha: Yesterday, the rice market felt increasingly flat, and buying sentiment was difficult to boost. The opening price in the morning had limited fluctuations. Changxi premium goods were slightly loose, and Bo Dao Shang Zhan was unusually quiet. The overall market fell again. Although the inventory of early rice was scarce, the situation was reversed and prices were low.</p>
<p>The demand for glutinous rice was slightly better, but the market was unstable. Du Jian sales were still good, and prices remained firm. Very few people were at the Yangbu Jian market in the morning. Yangmi xiangcang groups still traded well, but local street buying was limited, and prices did not rise or fall. Ships arriving from the west included seventeen or eighteen vessels from Changshu, Wuxi, Liyang, Jiangyin, Kunshan, Jiaoli, and Chonggu.</p>
<p>▲Hu Nan: Yesterday, 14 or 15 ships arrived at the rice market from various groups inland.</p>
<p>The transportation of thick Japonica rice from Changxi was heavy, and it was slightly more active at the end. Qingpu and Fengjing's thin rice stores continued to rise. Su Chang and Beigeng were unattended, and prices fell by 5 fen. The sales of Dao Du and Yang Jian were normal, and there was no original or unadulterated product on the market. The flow of Yin Hua goods was high, and prices were low.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Sugar Continues to Open for Over a Thousand Bags</p>
<p>▲Daily Sugar Allocation Market Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegram reported that the price of spot Cuban sugar had not changed. The price of New York sugar futures for September was up two points compared to the previous telegram, and the price of each other month rose by one point.</p>
<p>The price of spot and future Javan sugar remains stable. Market allocation for public associations remained flat,</p>
<p>and buying sentiment was sluggish. Dutch No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was priced at 11 taels and 7 qian, but there were very few takers. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at 11 taels and 5 fen, but transactions were also scarce. Dutch red sugar No. 12 rose to 10 taels and 1 qian, still at a fair price. Japanese sugar import and export was also slack, demand was even quieter, and the market also fell slightly. M Mark was 11 taels 3 qian and 2.5 fen, SH Mark was 11 taels 1 qian and 2.5 fen, YP Mark was 11 taels and 7 qian, YT Mark was 11 taels 3 qian, YRO Mark was 10 taels and 9 qian 7.5 fen, AE Mark was 11 taels and 7 qian 2.5 fen to 7 qian, Taikoo DY Mark was 11 taels and 2 qian, and the trend was still rising. Transaction volume was slow.</p>
<p>Hwa Sing sold more than one thousand bags of spot coarse granulated white sugar at 11 taels and 7 qian, and the market was stable and unremarkable.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Hao Red Dates Open for Over a Thousand Packages</p>
<p>▲The Price is 6 Taels and 5 Qian to 7 Qian</p>
<p>Recently, a large amount of Haozhou red dates has arrived, and the shops have opened sales for the past two days. A total of over a thousand packages have been traded, with prices ranging from 6 taels and 7 qian to 5 qian.</p>
<p>Each shop has distributed the orders. The previous market had slightly increased in color.</p>
<p>As for sales, groups such as Guangdong and Wenzhou are purchasing, and the shop's market price has been sold at over 6 taels and 8 qian.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Two Important Telegrams from All Circles in This City <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲Supporting the Central Government's Warning to Gu and Chen</p>
<p>▲Issued at the Commemorative Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department held a meeting of all circles in Shanghai to commemorate the 9th anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister in Guangzhou at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. The details have been briefly described in yesterday's newspaper. The two important telegrams passed by the meeting are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Telegram of Condolences to Chairman Chiang: To Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing: Having read the telegrams of May 28th, we respectfully understand your deep concern for saving the nation. Upon hearing this, we are filled with admiration. We believe that the Red bandits have been rampant for three years, and the provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi have suffered devastation. You could not bear the Red bandits' atrocities and the people's suffering, so you resolutely led troops into Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, braving dangers and rescuing the people from fire and water. All who have blood and spirit admire you. Our association sincerely represents the three million citizens of Shanghai, wholeheartedly supports you, and expresses our condolences. We hope you will appreciate our humble sentiments. Printed by the Shanghai All Circles Commemorative Meeting for the 9th Anniversary of the Death of the Prime Minister in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>▲Telegram Warning Gu and Chen: To Comrades Gu Yingfen and Chen Jitang in Guangzhou: Since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been constant wars and disturbances. Fortunately, all the generals and soldiers have worked together with one heart and fought in unison, which has enabled us to quell rebellions and achieve unification. We were looking forward to reorganizing the army and pacifying the Red rebels, to comfort the spirit of the Prime Minister in heaven and to satisfy the people's expectations. Unexpectedly, like a bolt from the blue, we heard that you comrades suddenly issued a telegram opposing Chiang. Now that unification and peace have barely begun, and the Red rebels are still rampant and need to be eliminated, your sudden actions are a destructive act against peace, and you comrades should bear the responsibility. The advance and retreat of party members should be in accordance with the party's orders. There is no such thing as individual free will, nor is it permissible for a few people to act out of personal likes and dislikes. Dedication to the party and the country is purely a sacrifice. There are no rights to speak of, nor is there any possibility of contention. Since Chiang's participation in the Northern Expedition, he has shouldered important responsibilities for the party and the country, and he has gone through countless dangers and near-death experiences. The world will have its judgment on his merits and demerits, so our association does not need to dwell on it. Even if you comrades have criticisms, you should formally submit impeachment procedures to the central government for a public decision. Instead, you are using troops to coerce, making alarming statements, imitating the old tricks of warlords, and following the path of rebellion. It is not surprising that Yan and Feng have done this, as they are opportunists who joined midway. You comrades are either advanced members of the party or revolutionary veterans, yet you are acting absurdly and resorting to such unwise tactics. This is what our association is greatly puzzled and saddened by. The central government is still showing leniency towards you comrades, repeatedly teaching you, fearing that you will start a war early and re-enact the tragedy of trampling on the people of southern China. Alas, Tibetan bandits are spying on Xikang, and Red bandits are rampant in Hunan and Jiangxi. Internal and external troubles are pressing in on us. If you comrades are determined to be the leaders of the rebellion, forgetting to attack, you are truly trying to place our nation and people in an irrecoverable situation. For you comrades, your infamous names will be forever recorded in history. For our suffering people, they will suffer another great calamity. Even if you comrades do not value your personal political lives, can you not think of the lives of the people in the homeland who are suffering? All the representatives of our association are both grieved and angry, and in great pain. Therefore, we issue a stern warning, hoping that you will pull back from the brink, salvage your late years, and fulfill your duty of sharing weal and woe. The future of the party and the country truly depends on it.</p>
<p>We hope that you comrades will carefully consider it in this time of survival and extinction. The Shanghai All Circles Commemorative Meeting for the 9th Anniversary of the Death of the Prime Minister in Guangzhou bows.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Two Foreigners Impersonate National Government Advisors to Purchase Large Quantities of Military Supplies <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲Briton Laif almost deceived</p>
<p>▲Zhang Fakui's younger brother is also involved</p>
<p>▲Everything exposed due to seal engraving</p>
<p>▲Details of the inside story still unknown</p>
<p>In the summer of the year before last, a bizarre case occurred in this city in which someone impersonated the American Vice Consul and defrauded the Chinese Yan Jiuling of a huge sum of money for the General Association's license movement fee. At that time, Chinese and foreign newspapers competed to report on it. One of the criminals in the case was the world-renowned military detective Youqin Beek, and the other was Gordon, who impersonated the American Consul. In addition, there was another suspect named Lewis. After investigation by the former Provisional Court, Beek was sentenced to nine months of imprisonment, Gordon was sentenced to three months of imprisonment, and Lewis was declared innocent. It has been two years since then. Beek and the other two have long served their sentences and regained their freedom. Now, except for Gordon, the other two were arrested by the police yesterday morning on charges of disturbing the peace and forging seals, and prosecuted in the Special District Local Court. Beek is Norwegian, and Lewis is Russian. The details of this accusation are very serious. According to a report made by a Briton, Mr. Laif, the owner of Laif Foreign Firm, to the General Police Station, it also involves the current incident in Guangdong. Mr. Laif's report mainly states that in mid-May of this year, Beek and Lewis were introduced to his firm by a Westerner from Jie Wu Sheng Company to order military supplies. The Westerner said at the time that Beek and others all had legitimate occupations and that no accidents would occur. He then agreed to meet them. Beek and others claimed that they had served as German military officers and are now employed by the Chinese government. Beek was appointed as a Colonel Military Advisor by the National Government, and Lewis was appointed as a Major General Military Advisor. Now, they were specially dispatched by the National Government to purchase military supplies. After negotiation, they agreed to sell them 6,500 rifles, 1,250 pistols, and other parts such as bullets, for a total price of 1,773,325 yuan, with 25% paid in advance, and the balance paid upon delivery of the goods. The above price was delivered to the Chase Bank, and the military supplies were transported to Shantou, Guangdong, for unloading. On that day, a draft agreement was signed. To be cautious, he notified the buyer that when signing the contract, each party must invite a notary to prove it. After the case was settled, Beek and others left. The next day, they returned to the firm with three Chinese men. After Beek and others introduced them one by one, it was learned that one of the three Chinese men, Zhang Faying, was Zhang Fakui's younger brother. The other two were purchasing committee members. They continued to discuss the matter and set June 12 as the official signing date. After they left, he felt that this matter was very suspicious. Since Beek and others were dispatched by the National Government, why were the military supplies transported to Guangdong for unloading? Therefore, he specially requested the British Consul in Shanghai to investigate with Nanjing. The British Consul advised that the military supplies could be sold, but it must be handled with caution. He then sent the draft agreement to Hallis Lawyer for review. Hallis Lawyer revised Article 7 of the draft agreement, stating that if the military supplies were to be transported to another place for unloading, the seller must be notified first, and all legal procedures must be handled by the buyer. He also requested the Chase Bank to pay attention to the buyer's power of attorney and the symbols they wore when the buyer paid the money. On June 12, the official signing date, he invited the Briton Carlo as the notary, and the buyer's notary was Zhu Caixue. The contract was made in triplicate, with the buyer and seller each holding one copy, and the remaining copy stored with the notary. The buyer's representative who signed was Zhang Faying, but Mr. Zhang did not arrive on that day. He only signed the contract and handed it over to Beek and others to take with them so that Zhang could sign. Unexpectedly, Beek and others took the contract and never returned. Because he did not know their address, there was no way to visit them. Recently, He Zixiang, the owner of Meitai Printing Bureau at 467 and 468 Zha Pu Road, whom he knew well, came to his firm and told him that a foreigner had gone to his place and asked him to engrave a seal. The foreigner also took out a seal and asked him to engrave it in the same style, and asked him to finish it by the 16th. After the foreigner left, he examined the sample seal and found that it was a seal with the name of Laif. Therefore, he came to inquire. When he heard He Zixiang's words, he was very surprised and asked He about the foreigner's appearance. According to He's description, he determined that this person was Lewis. Since he had limited time to engrave the seal, he must have needed it urgently. He requested that detectives be dispatched to investigate as soon as possible. Therefore, the head of the police dispatched Detective Chief, Russian Bebe Ning, Detective Harvey, and Chinese Detective Ma Wenda to wait near Meitai Printing Bureau on the 16th. At 4:35 PM, they saw Lewis enter the printing bureau to collect the engraved seal. After trying it once, he found that it was correct. Then, he took out a piece of paper with Western characters from his pocket and stamped it at the bottom with the newly engraved seal. He also borrowed another seal from the printing bureau and stamped it at the top. He seemed satisfied and put the paper in his pocket, paid the printing fee, obtained the receipt from the printing bureau, and abandoned the newly engraved seal in the bureau. As soon as he reached the door, he was captured by the detectives. The Western paper and receipt with the seal were found and taken back to the police station for strict interrogation. He confessed Beek's address, stating that he currently lived at No. 4 Lichar Road, while he lived at No. 24 Taili Shanfang, Xiafei Road, French Concession. The head of the police, in addition to ordering the Russian to be detained, went to Lichar Road to arrest Beek. Yesterday morning, he summoned the two witnesses, Laif and Carlo, and escorted Beek and others to the Special District Local Court. Chief Judge Xu Jashi took the chair in the First Criminal Court for trial. Qian Hongye, the prosecutor from the Procuratorate, attended the court to perform his duties. First, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the reasons for the prosecution and the course of the case, and requested the issuance of two search warrants so that he could go to the residences of the two defendants to search for various evidence. Then, the Western detective reported that he witnessed Lewis using the seal outside the Meitai Printing Bureau. Laif also fully described the beginning and end of the purchase of military supplies. However, Carlo claimed that he was acquainted with Laif and was invited by Laif to sign as a witness, and he did not know the details. Chief Judge Xu then questioned Lewis. According to his confession, Laif Foreign Firm specializes in military supplies. He was introduced by Jie Wu Sheng and was an employee of the firm, specializing in managing loading and unloading matters. If the goods were shipped from Dalian to various ports, they were all managed by him. Now, he learned that Laif, the owner of the firm, was purchasing a large quantity of military supplies for Guangdong. He stole two copies of the contract and reported them to Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance of the National Government. After receiving the report, Song left Shanghai for the capital the next day and sent a supervisor to Shanghai. Lewis confessed that Laif had originally planned to transport the military supplies purchased on behalf of others to Guangdong this month and hand them over to Zhang Fakui. After Lewis learned of this, he stole the contract and handed it over to me to take to Nanjing to report. Therefore, the contract is still kept in Nanjing. Laif, seeing that his actions were exposed, forged a seal to try to frame him. Lewis continued to confess that he went to Meitai Printing Bureau to order business cards, and he was scheduled to pick them up yesterday. Therefore, he went to pick them up yesterday and did not ask to engrave a seal. The Western paper found was not a copy of the contract, but a bill for military supplies shipped by Laif from Norway and Japan to Guangdong in May, requesting a settlement. The interrogation continued until 1:00 PM. The police lawyer then requested a postponement of two weeks to investigate the evidence. The two defendants were detained in the West Prison on Xiamen Road. Chief Judge Xu approved the request and adjourned the court. Beek and others were then escorted to the West Prison by the police for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Zhang Zhijiang Discusses Pacification Work <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲Divided into two steps: bandit suppression and village cleansing</p>
<p>▲The notorious bandit Zhi Xiaotao was escorted to Yangzhou yesterday</p>
<p>Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner Zhang Zhijiang came to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed him at his private residence. According to him, the Jiangsu pacification work is divided into two steps. The first step is bandit suppression, and the second step is village cleansing. The details of his discussion are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Bandit Suppression Completed: Mr. Zhang said that there are many bandits in the counties north of the Yangtze River, and they must be eliminated by military suppression. However, most of the bandits are local villagers. When they see the army arrive, they hide their weapons and pretend to be good citizens. When the army leaves, they become bandits again. Therefore, to thoroughly eliminate the bandit scourge, we must focus on the second step of work. The bandit suppression work has long been completed, and we are now continuing with village cleansing.</p>
<p>▲Village Cleansing Work: Village cleansing is the most important part of the pacification work. Originally, this village cleansing work was also nearing completion. However, for the sake of thorough handling, we must continue to work in practice to achieve lasting peace. Last time, I went to the counties to inspect and told the county magistrates and local officials not to rely solely on written reports to complete the work, but to do it in substance. We must also have a clear understanding of the good and bad people in the villages. Currently, about two-thirds of the counties in Jiangsu Province have completed the work, and about one-third have not yet completed it.</p>
<p>▲Notorious Bandit Escorted to Yangzhou: Mr. Zhang came to Shanghai in person last time to negotiate with the French Consul to transfer Zhi Xiaotao, the notorious bandit north of the Yangtze River. Mr. Zhang said that he had been transferred from the French Concession after his arrival in Shanghai yesterday and had been escorted to Yangzhou for trial that day. The bandit fled to Shanghai a month ago. He committed crimes in more than 70 places north of the Yangtze River, killing, arson, and doing everything. After fleeing to Shanghai, he was hiding in the International Settlement. Hearing that the Pacification Commissioner's Office had sent someone to Shanghai to arrest him, he fled to the French Concession. After being captured in the French Concession, the criminal still hired a lawyer to defend him and tried to escape justice. Finally, after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Songhu Garrison Command negotiated with the French side again, he was transferred to Yangzhou for trial yesterday, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Chinese Director's Inspection of National Products Market Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>▲Zhang Zilian States Reasons for Not Opening</p>
<p>The China National Products United Market, after being ordered to close by the Municipal Council, has been closed for nine days. The market is unwilling to open voluntarily. Yesterday, Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, among others, went to inspect the site. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Chinese Directors Inspect　Yesterday, at approximately 10:00 AM, Municipal Council Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, and Municipal Council Chinese Affairs Office official He Dekui, together arrived at the market for inspection. They were accompanied by Zhang Zilian and Hong Yanbin of the market, who assisted in observing the various construction projects recently completed in response to the Municipal Council's notification, to demonstrate the inaccuracy of the Municipal Council's claim that the market had not complied with the notification. During the inspection, Zhang and Hong</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>both stated to the Chinese directors that today's purpose was solely to provide factual proof of the completed projects in response to the Municipal Council's allegations, leaving judgment of right and wrong to public opinion. A total of nine construction projects were inspected, which are recorded as follows: (1) Between the back stage and the kitchen of the east third floor, the former New World used wooden boards. Now, as per the Municipal Council's notification, the market has built a new brick wall. (2) Between the office and the amusement area of the east second floor, the former New World had no separation. Now, as per the Municipal Council's notification, the market has built a new brick wall to separate them. (3) On the east and west sides of the base of the escalator leading from the third to the fourth floor, the former New World originally used steel-reinforced concrete walls. Now, as per the Fire Department's instructions, the market has demolished these walls and created two new exits. (4) From the rooftop to the left and right escalators on the lower floors, the former New World had no handrails or wooden banisters. Now, as per the Municipal Council's notification, the market has installed wooden handrails on both the east and west escalators. (5)</p>
<p>At the base of the west escalator on the ground floor, the former New World had one existing exit. Now, as per the Municipal Council's notification, the market has built a new brick wall to block the exit. (6) At the base of the east escalator on the ground floor, the former New World had one existing exit with a door. Now, as per the Municipal Council's notification, the market has built new brick walls to block both the exit and the door, and created a new exit on the north side. (7) At the back stage of the Grand Peking Opera, the former New World had doors that were seven feet high and five feet wide, with single-leaf openings, two on the east and west sides. Now, as per the Municipal Council's notification, the market has enlarged the original doors and converted them into double-leaf doors that are fourteen feet high and seven feet wide. (8) Outside the back stage of the Grand Peking Opera, the former New World originally had a lead-sheet awning that was the same height as the doors. Now, because the doors have been enlarged and raised, the market has raised the original lead-sheet awning to eighteen feet. (9) In the small park, the former New World had a corridor with bamboo pillars and thin boards for the roof, covered with oil felt, with a section that was broken and dilapidated. Now, the market has replaced it with a corridor with wooden pillars and a lead-sheet roof, connected to the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Zilian Speaks　Yesterday, Mr. Zhang Zilian, the founder of the National Products Market, issued a statement expressing his view that the market should not be easily opened. He stated, in brief, that on June 16, the Municipal Council sent representatives to request that the market first open and resume operations, which is a factual demonstration that the Municipal Council itself recognizes its actions were unreasonable. It also allows the public to understand the serious responsibility of the Municipal Council's illegal actions on June 9. The Municipal Council's illegal actions on June 9 were not simply a matter of infringing upon Zhang Zilian personally or infringing upon the rights of the market; rather, they involve violating agreements, infringing upon legal rights, and infringing upon the rights and business security of Chinese taxpayers in the settlement. If the facts surrounding this case are analyzed, the background of this illegal action contains elements of international competition, aiming for the complete destruction of the market's planned projects and preventing the market's plans for developing industry and the national economy from being realized, in order to fulfill their ambitions of aggression. Therefore, in order to defend the nation's legal rights, the people's dignity, and the rights of all Chinese taxpayers, I cannot easily open the market until this case is properly and legally resolved, so that China's legal and civil rights will no longer be despised and trampled upon.</p>
<p>▲Yu Qiaqing Speaks　Municipal Council Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday that the Municipal Council had arbitrarily closed the National Products Market due to the amusement department's facility issues, causing innocent businesses to suffer. He had raised the issue with Municipal Council Director-General Fessenden, who agreed that the market's commercial area could reopen immediately, but the amusement area would only be allowed to resume operations after the facilities were fully improved. He then invited Zhang Zilian of the market to discuss the matter, but no satisfactory solution was reached. He said that a response would be provided after the Municipal Council's regular meeting at 4:00 PM today.</p>
<p>▲Wu Jingxiong Speaks　Municipal Council Municipal Advisor Wu Jingxiong told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday that Municipal Council Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing is currently negotiating with the Municipal Council regarding the case of the National Products Market being ordered to close by the Municipal Council. He said that he will continue to uphold his previous principles, do his best to uphold justice, and try to assist the Chinese directors in finding a good solution.</p>
<p>▲Taxpayer Meeting　The Chinese Taxpayers' Association held its fourth executive committee meeting yesterday and discussed this case. As a result, regarding the legal rights portion, the association will wait for the Municipal Council to respond to the previous letter before further review. As for the actual situation inside the market, since Chinese Director Yu and others have personally inspected it, they should uphold justice and report the facts to the Municipal Council board in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲Ministry of Industry Approves　The Shanghai China National Products Preservation Association received approval from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Your telegram has been received. We have investigated this case based on previous telegrams from the China National Products United Market and the Shanghai National Products Factories United Association, requesting that we forward a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a protest and engage in serious negotiations. We forwarded a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 13th of this month for their consideration and handling. Please be informed." This is the approval.</p>
<p>▲Group Support　Yesterday, the market received a telegram from the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce and a letter from the Shanghai Antique Dealers Association. Declarations were also received from the New-Style Laundry Association and the Letterpress Printing Workers' Union, all expressing outrage at the case and offering their support.</p>
<p>▲Municipal Council Meeting　The Public Concession Municipal Council held a board meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday to discuss and dispose of the aftermath of the National Products Market. The meeting lasted for three hours. Those in attendance included Director-General MacNaghten, directors Peel, Brown, Kearney, Sheppard, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Hu Mengjia, Fukushima, Okamoto, Municipal Council Superintendent Fessenden, and Municipal Advisor Wu Jingxiong. First, representatives from the Municipal Council Fire Brigade and the police department attended and gave a detailed report on the poor internal layout of the National Products Market, stating that the market's Peking Opera and other amusement areas were overcrowded, the interior was filled with flammable objects, and the emergency exits were blocked. In the event of a fire, the danger would be extremely high. In order to protect the safety of citizens, they requested the Municipal Council to ban the market. Subsequently, the Director-General submitted the issue of the aftermath for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM. This reporter then visited Municipal Council Superintendent Fessenden to inquire about the results of the meeting. He replied that the Municipal Council had decided to form a special committee to discuss the aftermath with representatives from the National Products Market. The special committee would consist of Municipal Council Western Director Brown, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, Chief Superintendent E.W. Catling, Fire Chief Tysoe, and Public Works Director Needham. External parties have expressed many dissenting opinions on this issue, which are of no help to the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e138">County Bureau Announces Reclamation of Wasteland <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲Deadline of One Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government and the County Finance Bureau jointly issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Notice regarding the matter of wasteland reclamation. We have received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, which stated: 'We have investigated the case of wasteland reclamation. The department previously drafted measures, which were presented to and approved by the Provincial Government Committee. We then ordered all relevant county bureaus to conduct thorough investigations and complete the process within the prescribed time limit. However, although the aforementioned measures stipulate that all cases must be completed within six months, there is still concern that prompt results may not be achieved without active implementation. Therefore, we are strictly setting measures and ordering all relevant county bureaus to promptly require the original operators to report to the bureau within one month for all uncultivated wasteland in the county, regardless of whether it has been cultivated or not. If they fail to report within the deadline, the operators will be deemed to have voluntarily abandoned their property rights. Farmers who cultivate the land will be allowed to report for reclamation, with certification from the Li Ce Shu (local record book), pay the price according to regulations, and be issued a stamped deed to manage the property, in accordance with Sun Yat-sen's principle of 'land to the tiller.' Farmers who have independently cultivated the land and have no owners must also report for reclamation within one month. If they fail to report within the deadline, neighbors will be allowed to report them and freely pay the price for reclamation, as a warning to those who are hesitant. Orders must be carried out; do not delay and miss the opportunity.' We have received these instructions and are issuing them to the county bureau chief for compliance, joint issuance, and widespread notification." We have investigated this case based on previous instructions from the Department of Finance, which promulgated the "Regulations for Reclaiming Uncultivated Wasteland in Jiangsu Province and Supplementing Grain and Promotion." We are issuing this notice to inform all residents of the county that all uncultivated wasteland, regardless of whether it has been cultivated or not, must be reported for reclamation within one month. Failure to reclaim within the deadline will result in the abandonment of property rights, and farmers who cultivate the land, or neighboring residents, will be allowed to report and reclaim the land. The deadline is imminent, and orders must be carried out. This matter concerns the protection of property rights, so do not delay and miss the opportunity. Be sure to comply."</p>

<p>▲Celebration by Expatriates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday (16th) was the 73rd birthday of the King of Sweden. The Swedish Consulate in this city was closed for one day.

<h3 id="e141">Yu Dalun Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>▲Captain is Japanese Jinjiie Ishi</p>
<p>▲Reports Truth About Ship Collision</p>
<p>Yu Dalun, manager of the Haichang Company, colliding and sinking the British submarine Poseidon, has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Yu Dalun arrived in Shanghai from Yingkou. This reporter made a special visit to the company. According to reports, Yu Dalun left Shanghai on the 7th and collided with the British submarine Poseidon at 12:09 PM on the 9th. The cause of the collision was that the submarine mistakenly navigated the channel, instead of avoiding outward, it turned and crossed in front of Yu Dalun. Yu Dalun was proceeding, according to course, unaware of the sudden change in direction. He immediately attempted to reverse, but within a split second, the collision occurred. Yu Dalun struck the bow, and the British warship struck the waist. The ship's hull was immediately breached, and seawater flooded the interior, causing it to sink extremely quickly. Our ship stopped to assist in the rescue, saving more than twenty soldiers from the ship. The captain of our ship, Japanese Jinjiie Ishi, immediately discussed the matter with the captain of the British warship, stating that the responsibility for the collision lay with the British warship, not Yu Dalun. The British captain also admitted his mistake, so he signed a document certifying his responsibility. Yesterday, after the captain arrived at the Yu Dalun Company on Yong'an Street to report the incident, he, along with the Shanghai manager and the ship surveyor, went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf in Yangjiadu, Pudong, to inspect the area of the ship's bow that had been struck. There was only minor damage, which will be repaired today. Regarding the shipowner's report of the matter, the Yu Dalun Company plans to slightly revise the text before publishing it, so that the public can understand the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Customs Plans to Blow Up Sunken Dachang Steamer <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲Work Began the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that after the Dachang steamer collided with the Dahua steamer outside Wusongkou in April and sank, the Customs dispatched five patrol boats to search for several days. Finally, the sunken location was measured to be about three li (Chinese mile) outside Songkou, in a key area for passing ships, obstructing navigation. It was necessary to blow it up. The Customs then contracted with the Tokyo Salvage Company to blow up the ship, agreeing on a daily wage of 77,000 yen and setting a broad timeframe of one year due to the difficulty of construction at that location. However, according to the company's estimate, the work could be completed in four months. The company began work yesterday (16th), first sending swimmers into the water to remove the masts and deck, and then blasting away the hull, to the degree that it is level with the bottom of the river.</p>
<h3 id="e143">American Ship Stranded on the Upper Yangtze Encounters Bandits <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>▲Stranded on Upper Yangtze The number one ship of the Upper Yangtze shipping company R-1 left Hankou on the thirteenth loaded with cargo for Chongqing. When traveling near the scenic sacred island of Yichang the water level retreated and the ship mistakenly ran aground. This area is known to be rampant with bandits, seeing the American ship have an accident, they gathered to attempt to rob the ship. Bandits drove small boats, fighting to get aboard the ship, creating a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>▲Crew Resistance The crew and captain below were exceedingly worried, seeing the bandits armed with weapons, the crew also took up defensive weaponry. The bandits opened fire first, and the crew fired back, bullets flying from all sides.</p>
<p>▲Warship Rescue China's Second Yangtze Fleet was dispatched and sped to the rescue. When they arrived, the American ship was in the most dire circumstance. China's naval warship launched an attack on the bandits. Seeing the incoming warship, the bandits scattered and fled.</p>
<p>▲Crew and Passengers Rescued R-1 was run aground and lost the ability to maneuver. After the naval ship scared away the bandits, realizing the American ship could not be pulled from the sandbank immediately, they brought the ship closer, released sampans, and brought all the passengers, crew, and other personnel aboard. They prepared to send them to Yichang, not long after the American ship arrived in Yichang and the Yangtze rescue ship arrived to take the passengers and crew to Yichang.</p>
<p>▲Rescue of Ship The stranded ship will be rescued by the Yangtze rescue ship in about twenty four hours. While being towed, to protect against bandit attacks, China's naval warship will stay to protect.</p>
<p>Though the workers and passengers were scared, luckily nobody was hurt.</p>

<p>▲Ministry of Railways Pays in Full　　▲Railway Bureau Faces Difficulties in Fundraising　　Workers from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, citing business prosperity and increased revenue, requested to be paid a year-end bonus of one and a half months according to bonus regulations. At that time, they received an order from the Ministry of Railways, which stated that due to the railway bureau's lack of cash, only one month's bonus would be paid. The railway bureau complied with the order and made the payment. Recently, workers from the two railways have repeatedly requested the Ministry and the bureau to pay the remaining half-month bonus. It is now reported that the railway bureau has received a reply from the Ministry of Railways, stating: "Regarding the railway's year-end bonus for the 19th year, which was previously reduced to one month due to the railway's financial difficulties and lack of cash, the bureau, the railway's special party department, and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Vehicle Workers' Union have repeatedly telegraphed that internal and external workers have worked hard, live in hardship, and request to be paid the remaining half-month bonus for that year. We should approve paying all workers the remaining half-month bonus once the railway's bond interest for this year has been paid off and there are indeed surplus funds, in order to show the Ministry's special consideration. Please comply." The railway bureau director, Luo, has ordered the railway's accounting department to comply. However, the two railways temporarily suspended payment of various miscellaneous expenses and material purchases last month in order to raise funds for the interest on the loan from the Sino-British Corporation. The debt principal has also not been allocated. The bureau is currently experiencing a severe shortage of cash and is facing difficulties in raising funds for the bonus.</p>

<p>The China National Products Preservation Association was founded in the autumn of the Xinhai Revolution. It was originally jointly organized by ten groups, including the Shanghai Qianjiang Guild Hall, Yunjin Association, Xulun Association, Dianye Association, Yiye Association, Shengjing Association, Zhouye Association, Fuchouye Association, and Xiuye Association. It was initially attached to the Qianjiang Guild Hall, and its scale was very simple. Subsequently, various national products groups and members Wang Jie'an, Wang Xingyi, etc., generously donated funds, and in the 9th year of the Republic, they purchased land on Gaodun Road in Jiumu and built a association hall. It has been twenty years since then. It has spared no effort in promoting national products. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the association's establishment, and the association plans to hold a large-scale ceremony to commemorate it. It has already nominated Wang Xingyi, Wang Muzhou, Huang Moto, Sun Zhengzhu, etc., as preparation committee members, and they are planning and proceeding in a very busy manner. The commemorative measures have been determined as: (1) Hold a three-day entertainment event; (2) Hold a product exhibition for members; (3) Publish a 20th anniversary special issue; (4) Invite comrades from national products manufacturers at home and abroad to a social gathering and dinner; (5) Invite the news media and distribute commemorative gifts. The venue is planned to be the Bansong Garden or Xu Garden, which is still under consideration. At that time, there will be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>The Consolidated Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance replied to a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill United Association yesterday, stating: "In direct reply, we have received your letter of June 9, stating that cotton yarn seconds should not be classified as 'other types of cotton yarn' as referred to in the Consolidated Tax Regulations, and requesting that they be exempted from the consolidated tax in the same way as cotton waste. We have investigated that cotton yarn seconds are made from cotton, the same as cotton yarn. Although their selling price is lower than that of cotton yarn, they still have considerable value when transported and sold from the factory. They should be subject to the consolidated tax. Because their selling price is lower, this administration has specifically stipulated that the tax be levied on an ad valorem basis, to show that they are different from ordinary cotton yarn, which is taxed according to quantity. This has been in effect for a long time and has become a precedent. It is not appropriate to abolish it. We hereby reply for your information." After receiving the letter, the Yarn Mill United Association has separately notified all manufacturers for their information.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association received a letter from Xiong Tianyi, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and an urgent telegram from Jiangxi Province, reporting that the disaster area has expanded and the people are in deep water and fire. If relief is not provided early, the disaster victims will all become starving corpses, and the corpses of those who have starved to death are everywhere, with no one to bury them. The weather is hot, and those who do not die from the disaster will suffer from epidemics. A special board meeting was convened, chaired by Chairman Song Hanzhang. Chinese and foreign directors were deeply moved when they heard this. It is regrettable that various provinces have suffered heavily from disasters in recent years, and all relief funds have been allocated without any remainder. It was decided to actively raise funds, but it is feared that the situation is too urgent. Measures were taken to advance 10,000 yuan to slightly alleviate the immediate crisis. However, this is a drop in the bucket, and what can it accomplish? It is hoped that all sectors will provide assistance to fulfill the charitable cause.</p>

<p>▲Abstract Translation of the Fourth and Fifth Sections▲Chapter Five: General Discussion of "The Unique Characteristics of the International Settlement, Its Advantages and Disadvantages," and Discussion of Some of the Criticisms Included in the Statement Quoted in Chapter One. The existing administration of the International Settlement represents a vigorous and self-governing system within Chinese territory. What would be the actual result if the existing system were terminated and the International Settlement were completely handed over to Chinese administration at this time? This is one of the main issues for the future. Therefore, before listing the points of criticism one by one, it is necessary to first consider a broad issue as a starting point, which is not only relevant but also extremely important. What is this broad issue? What are the main characteristics of the International Settlement's administration that make it distinctly different from any administrative system in fully Chinese-controlled areas? The report indicates that the International Settlement's administration, based on the Land Regulations, differs from any system established in fully Chinese-managed areas due to the principles upon which it is based and the nature of the actual results it achieves. The unique characteristics of the International Settlement are summarized under two headings: 1. Principles; 2. Actual Results. The "principles" upon which the International Settlement's administration is based are the "autonomy" and "rule of law" described in Part Two. The openness involved in autonomy is noted in the report and it is mentioned that the publication of inspected accounts along with reports for submission to the ratepayers' annual meeting is an obligation of the Municipal Council. Although the importance of these principles is generally recognized, the direct causal relationship between the adoption of these principles in handling government affairs and the actual results achieved in administration is sometimes not fully understood. The actual results achieved are divided into (1) primary and (2) secondary. 1. Primary Results. The primary results can be summarized as two: (A) Safety; (B) Improvements in general living conditions. The security situation in the International Settlement, and the elements upon which this security relies, have been discussed in detail in the previous section. Improvements in general living conditions are the result of the provision and management of public services. The most notable are the construction and maintenance of public works, the protection of public health, the provision of education and sports facilities, and the provision of affordable water, electricity, power, and transportation. Regarding the issues of safety and improved living conditions, the work of the International Settlement Municipal Council, which has achieved such a degree of success under the special and limited conditions created by the general situation, is largely due to the adherence to the principles upon which the International Settlement's organizational law is based, in order to conduct honest and effective</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>administration. Following these principles requires the acceptance of two main considerations as the work standard for the Municipal Council directors and their staff: (A) Respect for the public interest; (B) Compliance with the law. If the latter is interpreted in the practical work of administration, it means that all matters are handled in accordance with general laws and regulations, without any discrimination. I believe that the ability of the International Settlement Municipal Council to achieve such a degree of success is due to the adherence to certain principles in conducting honest and effective administration, but this does not mean that these principles are always fully implemented or that their achievements are beyond criticism. The Municipal Council is still far from this. Detailed criticisms are provided below. However, regarding the implementation of principles, the issue of respecting the public interest has been mentioned in previous chapters. The understanding of the public interest tends to be too narrow, and the idea that the so-called public interest should be interpreted as the interest of the entire society has not been fully recognized. I must also mention the honest and effective administration of the Municipal Council, but this does not mean that the Municipal Council's administration is completely flawless. It only means that, in general, it has maintained a high standard. In the management of such a large administrative organization as the Municipal Council, incidents of fraud, error, and omission are inevitable. It is difficult to expect that all bribery and corruption can be completely eliminated in the management of municipal affairs, which involves the employment of a large number of subordinates in an environment such as Shanghai. Some of this bribery and corruption has been long-standing and is considered excusable even if it is not permitted by law. If you want to limit this kind of evil to not exceed a considerable small range, only strict defense and persevering efforts can be successful. I want to emphasize that the achievements of the International Settlement's administration, which are greater than the achievements of Chinese municipal systems, should not be regarded merely as clear evidence of a comparison of the achievements of Chinese and foreign personnel, as some people sometimes assume. Rather, it is a matter of principle, that is, accepting certain principles as the principles to be implemented, and consistently applying these principles to the handling of ordinary government affairs. To establish an honest and efficient administration, there are two elements as follows: (1) Regarding financial matters, publication and auditing are the best guarantees of integrity. The Land Regulations stipulate that the Municipal Council's annual accounts must be audited (that is, audited by independent auditors) and published, and submitted to the annual public meeting for approval. (2) Public agencies, if they want to serve well, must provide generous treatment to their personnel. There must be reasonable and generous conditions in terms of both salaries and continued employment in order to attract talented people to serve them, and it must be guaranteed that the salaries or wages of the personnel employed are paid on time and according to the fixed amount. The terms of employment of the Municipal Council's staff, in any case, as far as senior staff are concerned, have obviously always followed a reasonable and generous policy. Its recent reforms have also raised the salary standards of junior staff, and the salaries or wages of all staff, from the highest to the lowest, have always been paid on time and according to the fixed amount, without any arbitrary deductions. If the Municipal Council and its personnel have any disagreement regarding the salaries due, the relevant staff or employees can sue the Municipal Council in the Consular Court. In fact, such cases of suing the Municipal Council have occurred several times. In this regard, the Municipal Council's position is different from that of the Chinese government authorities. The two elements mentioned above are very important for maintaining the financial integrity and high standard of administrative efficiency of the Municipal Council. These elements are closely related to the two fundamental principles of autonomy and rule of law upon which the International Settlement's administration is based. This is what should be noted. 2. Secondary Results. The secondary results of the Municipal Council's administration are not only important but also an indispensable element. This result is the development and prosperity of the International Settlement, as represented by its great industrial and commercial interests, large resident population, magnificent architectural facilities, and extraordinarily high land prices within the Settlement. It should be noted that if it were not for the strict respect for private property rights under the administration of the International Settlement, such high land prices could never have been created even in the most prosperous circumstances. Moreover, although the Municipal Council pays high prices to acquire land for the widening of roads and other public utilities, the high land prices, which result from the policy of insisting on respect for private landowners' rights, have a significant impact on increasing the economic resources of the International Settlement's administration. If there is any change in the status of the International Settlement, or any doubt arises about the continuation of the existing policy, the decline in land prices will be inevitable, and the economic resources of any governing body of the International Settlement in the future will also be reduced accordingly. I have already said that the various characteristics mentioned above give the International Settlement's administration a characteristic that is different from any system established in fully Chinese-controlled areas. This statement applies particularly to the two principles upon which the system is based: (1) Autonomy, including the methods of publication necessary for a true autonomous system; (2) Rule of law, in terms of the exercise of political power affecting private rights. As for the results, there is also the question of the degree of difference when comparing the International Settlement with the more advanced Chinese-controlled areas. In recent years, certain cities in China have indeed begun to make material progress and adopt more orderly and efficient municipal management methods. Most Chinese people also know the importance of this reform and are working to make it a reality. However, no matter how hopeful the success of this effort may be, when comparing the current Shanghai International Settlement with the Chinese-controlled areas, the overall standard of honesty and efficiency achieved by the Settlement's administration still stands out among the cities. Moreover, the improvements achieved in Chinese cities are not carried out under a system of representative government, but are mostly promoted by individuals who generally hold public office and have an enterprising spirit. These individuals, on the one hand, rely to some extent on the assistance and support of local people, and on the other hand, exercise some dictatorial powers. Therefore, the foundation of this reform is less stable. If the administrative personnel are changed due to external influences, civilized and progressive policies, if not based on the support of an organized autonomous society, can be endangered at any time. Only an organized autonomous society can recognize the value of the results of such policies and decide to obtain and maintain such results for itself. Civil government is not a guarantee against error, but in a society with autonomous bodies, voters are inspired by public spirit and understand their own interests, then their civil government, together with its necessary methods of publication, is indeed the best possible safeguard against administrative abuses. Such a society, after all, can know where the error lies and has the power to correct it. How is the value of the principles upon which the International Settlement's administration is based, as expressed by analytical methods, recognized by China's political leaders? The inclusion of the policy of adopting local autonomy within the accepted political procedures, and the public recognition of some of the main principles upon which the autonomous system must be based, can be regarded as extremely important factors for the future. However, hope is not the same as success. In terms of time and facts, the two may be far apart. Even when reform is still in the realm of empty talk, the difference and distance between the two are often overlooked by enthusiastic reformers. Criticisms of the International Settlement's administration are considered under four headings as follows: (1) The foreignization of the nature of administration. The main argument of all criticisms under this heading is that the senior staff of the Municipal Council are all foreigners, and that the Municipal Council's official documents are published in English. The report comments on these arguments as follows: It is very important to have educated Chinese participate in the responsible municipal administrative work and to interact with educated people in Chinese society, but partly because the Municipal Council's board of directors initially had no Chinese representatives, the board and the foreign community were slow to recognize this importance. As a result, the work of the Municipal Council was actually harmed, and a hostile atmosphere, mostly based on misunderstandings, developed among some Chinese people. Another part of the reason is that Chinese people feel that the Municipal Council's views on Chinese people are not given sufficient consideration, and that the International Settlement's administration tends to clearly ignore the interests of Chinese people and lacks understanding in interacting with Chinese people. It then mentions the recommendations of the Salary Committee and the methods of implementing these recommendations, and states as follows: A resolute and well-considered plan is currently underway to enable Chinese people to serve as senior staff members of the Municipal Council and to achieve both credibility and outstanding results. In the previous parts of this chapter, I have solemnly stated an argument, that is, the success of the Municipal Council's administration is due to the adoption of certain principles. The employment of Chinese people to hold senior positions does not necessarily conflict with the maintenance of the existing standards of the International Settlement's administration, as some foreigners commented. However, if good results are to be obtained, the pace of change must not be too rapid. Because this matter, like other matters affecting the administration of the International Settlement, should be gradually changed at a slow pace. Relatively speaking, the principles upon which the Municipal Council system is based are familiar to foreigners and less familiar to Chinese people. If the Chinese people who hold senior positions in the Municipal Council can use these principles successfully in the future, then these relevant Chinese people must first have sufficient time to gradually assimilate with these principles in the process of their personal practical experience. Moreover, there is another thing that must be remembered, that is, the difficulties encountered by Chinese people in senior positions are often more avoidable for foreign staff. Therefore, when there are special vacancies to be filled, the issue of whether to employ Chinese or foreign personnel is not only a comparison of talents. The world has people who are good at swimming, but are unable to use their skills when they encounter stormy waves. Old habits of administration, as well as the deeply ingrained customs and ideas of the people, all represent powerful currents. It is very difficult for Chinese individuals to proceed against these, and it may also be largely impossible for Chinese Council members. Regarding salary issues, or ordinary administrative matters, such as the application of general regulations without discrimination, this is also contrary to the old-fashioned ideas of the Chinese. I have already stated that I do not want to say that these difficulties cannot be overcome, but the fact that difficulties exist must be recognized. (2) The so-called common practice of corruption. There is a noteworthy fact, that is, although the issues raised by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association included a request for complaints, asking complainants to describe in detail the situation of Municipal Council staff accepting bribes or other improper conduct, this request only elicited a very weak response. Only the answer from the United Federation of Chambers of Commerce contained a comprehensive but uncertain accusation. I have already mentioned that there is a generally accepted fact, that is, as far as the board of directors and the senior staff of the Municipal Council are concerned, the achievements of the International Settlement are very clean, and maintaining a high level of financial integrity</p>
<p>is one of the characteristics of its administration. In addition to adopting preventive measures, the Municipal Council has always conducted thorough investigations of reported bribery cases,</p>
<p>and strictly punished offenders once the crime is established. (3) Policing. Due to the prevalence of armed crime in the International Settlement, especially kidnapping cases, criticisms of the International Settlement's policing have arisen. This criticism is mentioned in the report, and the special nature and difficulties of the crime problem in the International Settlement are discussed. In addition, excerpts from the report of the Chief of Police are also included and commented on as follows. It is noteworthy that the excerpts focus on two points: (1) The police force's efforts to prevent kidnappings and rescue hostages are greatly hampered by the lack of cooperation from the public, especially the families and friends of the kidnapped. (2) "The planning of kidnappings mostly does not take place within the International Settlement," and the main motive of this crime is also beyond the "authority" of the International Settlement's police force. Those who criticize the policing of the International Settlement often easily overlook these points when they discuss the issue of crime in the International Settlement, as if suppressing crime completely depends on the police efficiency of the International Settlement. It is then mentioned that gambling and private trafficking in opium soil are factors affecting the crime situation. The recent ban on dog racing in the International Settlement and the current situation of private trafficking in opium soil are also mentioned. Other criticisms regarding policing are also mentioned, including the inability of the police force to adopt any measures to suppress prostitution. The recommendations of the special committee organized in 1919 to investigate the crime situation in the International Settlement, and the implementation of the report of the committee in accordance with the "resolution passed by the ratepayers' annual meeting on April 7, 1920," are also described. The system of licensing prostitutes was adopted for a period of five years,</p>
<p>with the number of licenses decreasing year by year until the end of 1925, when the issuance of licenses was stopped. However, this plan has not proven to be effective in either abolishing prostitution or limiting prostitution. Therefore, how to devise a method to effectively control the evil that cannot be completely eliminated is still an unresolved issue. Moreover, according to the current law, the decision to stop the licensing system is an extremely difficult task for the police force. The current efforts of the police force are only to adopt a method</p>
<p>to limit the prostitution industry to certain areas and to prohibit soliciting along the way. However, recently, due to the general crime situation,</p>
<p>a large number of patrol officers are needed, and it is difficult for the Chief of Police to dispatch sufficient personnel</p>
<p>to carry out this work. According to the current situation, the entire issue seems to need to be re-examined. Those who criticize the International Settlement's administration are prone to assume that the prevalence of prostitutes in the International Settlement is due to the Settlement authorities' indifference to the welfare of the Chinese people. However, those who are harmed by the current situation are not limited to the Chinese people. In fact, under the current law, there is no licensing system, and the International Settlement authorities have no effective way to resist this evil. If a law is established that all those who open brothels or live by prostitution are guilty of crimes and should be severely punished, then the police force would have an opportunity to adopt measures that are much stricter than what they can do now. (4) The lack of sufficient facilities in Chinese schools and hospitals. The comments on the hospital issue described in Chapter Four, and the report submitted to the board of directors by the Education Committee in December 1930, are all mentioned. It is generally recognized that the criticism that there is no adequate provision for Chinese education in the International Settlement is well-founded, and that a more generous and progressive policy should be adopted for Chinese education in the future.</p>
