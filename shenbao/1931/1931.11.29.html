<h3>國際憤激空氣下</h3>
<p>本莊下令退兵</p>
<p>瀋日軍司令部聲稱</p>
<p>今日軍退鐵路區域</p>
<p>（瀋陽）　滿洲軍局、信宿之後忽有奇異之變動、其變動來之甚驟、殊令人不解、瀋陽確爲驚異不置、據本莊司令部聲稱、現已下令命日軍一律退、入南滿鐵路區域、本莊司令部對於昨日軍隊之行動、不肯告人、且未釋明理由、當時衆意日兵一旅之沿北寗鐵路而進、乃圖攻擊錦州與山海關、天津局勢或將益復轉危、　爾、則此日軍一旅之行動、眞相益明、天津自傳來戰事仍在進行中之消息後、昨夜未有續電、乃今晨本莊司令部某員宣稱、天津未有消息繼續傳來、但又稱、現因津埠局勢和緩、沿北寗鐵路而下之日軍、已在撤至遼河東面中、茲已開始撤退、繼又宣佈日軍總退至南滿鐵路區域、謂鐵路區域外之各支隊、現已減至絕對至低數、其餘之兵、行將退入鐵路區域云云、昨日載運日兵一旅沿　北寗鐵路而下、之火車六列、今日可望折回北間、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（南京）　東京二十八日電、據確息、日政府因美國態度硬化、决定停止攻擊錦州、二十八日晨已急電本莊、令速以飛機傳達前綫、將北寗線前進部隊全部撤退、</p>
<p>（東京）　此間官塲消息、昨夜八時、滿洲日軍總司令本莊已下命令向錦州進展之軍隊儘速退回瀋陽、但現因鐵路有數地點損　、而退回須稍遲延、但料日内可回至此間、　般人士之意、退兵命令、幸在美國務卿史汀生關於日本之言論公布以前發出、昨日軍隊之出發、據謂乃華兵攻擊天津日租界激動公憤之結果、衆信若早聞史汀生之言論、則軍心將更憤滿、而撤兵命令或不免於緩下也、據官塲宣稱、陸軍之目的、不在續佔土地　但在打破華軍危及和平秩序者之集中、至於地方民政事宜、準備交華人自行辦理也、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今日接瀋陽新聞電、據謂昨沿北寗路綫出發之日軍現已撤回新民、聞係軍事當道接奉日政府緊急訓令所致、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（瀋陽）　北寗路日軍今晨開始撤回、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　北寗路日軍被如回新民之說、可見滿洲日軍司令曾有不遵奉政府訓令之意、但現已服從命令、不攻錦州　午後瀋陽來電且有本莊决計在下星期内將瀋陽以西日軍一律撤回鐵路區域之說、日人以爲如張學良實行其將錦州軍隊撤入關内、並設立中立區域之議、則時局即可樂觀、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（二十八日中央社電）</p>
<p>（瀋陽）　滿洲日軍計畫突然變更、軍隊移動完畢後、日軍究將如何分配、今晚本莊司令部之代表有較明白之表示、謂鐵路區域以外之駐兵地點、大約爲吉林·巨流河·齊齊哈爾·及鄭家屯·或洮南等處、在昻齊戰事以前、　駐吉林·巨流河·鄭家屯或洮南之少數兵額、以後並不增多、而留駐齊哈爾之兵、將减爲一聯隊、雖各處駐軍須俟直接談判開始後、方可撤回南滿鐵路區域、但齊齊哈爾駐兵之撤退、並不繫於談判、不久或可撤回、發難之初、由朝鮮調入滿洲之日兵一旅、現不復須駐滿洲、故不久可開回原防、昨日沿北寗路線出發之混成旅、現陸續開回瀋陽、刻正佈置安揷軍官之處、擬令其分居於此間各日人家内（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日軍繼續逞凶</h3>
<p>國聯大感不安</p>
<p>解决方案絕少進步</p>

<h3>日本惡浪與國聯</h3>
<p>４</p>
<p>自九月十八東北禍變突發全民界立即爲自東京方面湃而來之恐怖惡浪所激盪。而陷於極端之警惶與不安。蓋此種惡浪之襲來。雖當前直接蒙受迫害者爲中國。然而由於惡浪之激盪與顚播。使世界和平之美夢。頓爲驚破。人類前途顯呈來日大難。未來慘劫。終於無可避免之恐怖與悲哀。</p>
<p>當禍變發生。正値國聯集會。此一惡浪之襲來。國聯以責任與威信之關係。無可迴避。不得不力爲防遏。故就國聯之地位。乃處於日本與中國之間。同時即處於戰爭與和平之問。國聯固爲中國所信託。同時亦爲維護和平之一重屏障。如何障遏此迫害全人類之惡浪。不僅中國。世界人民當都翹首企盼於國聯。</p>
<p>中國自承受此一惡浪之襲擊以來。舉民族國家之生存權。毫無保留的信託國聯。舉凡可以忍受與退讓者。中國無不遵從國聯之告。維護國聯之威信。今且最後退至犧牲神聖之領土行政主權。劃錦州爲中立區域。請列國派兵駐守。今日電訊。又謂中國對日本撤兵日期等已有重大讓步此皆爲萬不能讓步者而亦讓步之。我國人雖能忍辱負重。然亦豈肯無出息至此。承認此無限度之讓步。而日人則得寸進尺。武力侵略之進行。迄猶未已。在此種情勢下。國聯尙能委曲以求兩方之妥協。謀和平之不破裂耶。</p>
<p>然而國聯則祗知勸告我代表。壓迫我代表。迄不能發揮其權威。爲公理與正義作有力之保障。凡日本之所要求者。無不曲意屈從。即可證明國聯已爲日本惡浪所衝倒。東京方面之惡勢力。正透過國聯而襲擊中國。換言之即國聯無暴於代日太執行其一貫的侵略政策。使此種侵略。在形式更爲巧妙。而取得國際上之確立根據。</p>
<p>我國自九一八禍變以來。即舉中華民族之全個生命。託庇於國聯之足下。而國聯處處屈就日本。換言之。即無異於使中國俯首承受日本透過國聯之　擊。然而忍受與退讓之終極。遼東　鼓。　動地而來。天津禍亂復再次掀起。再退將退至何處。如劃出中立地爲唯一防遏惡浪之法則。勢非在天津上海以及各省各地。凡日可以襲擊。可以引起騷動之區域。都劃一中立區域不可。事實顯呈。利害畢見。而我方當局。亦不感覺及此。且提出極其滑稽之日軍設誓不侵犯中國軍隊撤退區域之要求。吁。長夜漫漫。酣夢沉沉。夢何時醒。夜何時旦。</p>
<p>設使國聯竟如前日白里安所表示而眞撤手。我國其將復託庇於何種勢力。天助自助者。國人其三思之。</p>
<h3>接國内要電</h3>
<p>待美國道威斯與中日兩政府之同意、惟中政府在錦州正有日軍進犯危險時拒絕接受决議案、故料非至下星期二不能舉行公開會議、國聯中人預料日本若佔據錦州、將發生最嚴重結果、今日下午理事會接日軍已佔據盤山、另派鐵甲車在英人投資之北寗路向錦州進發之報、頗爲驚異、白里安以議長資格立召芳澤相晤、聲稱、日軍倘不能停止向錦州前進、渠將請日軍說明軍事行動之理由、今日中國代表團發言人稱、吾人必須一想及中國人民當此日軍正向錦州前進之時、中國自難接受理事會决議案、故必須先將此種危機除去、中國始能接受理事會任何行動云云、現理事會已接天津紛擾之報、據稱、日軍所放砲彈、有一枚在省公署附近炸裂、一枚在市政府附近炸裂、據中國方面報告、雙方係星期四夜八時半開火、日軍於便衣隊由日租界擁出、即開大砲與機關槍相助、攻擊中國警察、日軍共放三十七砲、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今晚國聯行政會開開、到會員十三人、中日代表皆未出席、討論四十五分鐘、旋休會、調查團議案起草委員　（英法西三國代表）繼開會議、明晨起草委員會將再開　度會議、作最後之斟酌、衆料此後行政會即可通過修正議案、中國總代表明晨將與起草委員晤談、聞中代表仍欲規定日軍撤盡之一定時期、但各會員皆覺有此規定、議案將不爲日本所接受、津事之倐然復作、又表示時局之甚嚴重性質、但天津不似錦州之爲神經系集中點、衆望五中立國視察員在錦州之努力、輔以日政府之好意、當可阻免錦州之被攻擊、否則行政會在此力謀最後解决之努力、將盡成泡影矣、日外相幣原聲稱、如錦州被攻、則渫將辭職之消息、使輿情愈有樂觀、日代表今日以昨晚天津日租界被攻之報告送交國聯秘書長、據稱、天津日兵不得已而還擊、又稱、駐津日兵力薄、而華軍較强、日代表又送出一報告、謂日兵在安山前山炭坑子與南台擊敗中國匪衆後、現已返瀋陽云、中代表亦接到昨晚津變之報告、謂天津戰事、釁由日開、而日人則謂槍彈飛入日租界、故日軍開火云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　官塲稱、據巴黎最近消息、國聯以爲日本所擬修正草議案諸點、大都僅爲字句問題、實則日本認其所提出之修正案與調查團範團有關者、乃日本可接受此案之主要條件、國聯似側重保全中國之顏面、而不顧日本之請求、日本亟欲使議案字句不稍留可作曲解、致不利於日本之法律上罅隙、國聯對於日本保留案與停戰等有關者、似可依允、此乃稍可滿意者、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　中國施總代表今日告白里安、倘能有滿意保證、担保日本政府願於控制其陸軍、且力能加以控制、則中國準備開談理事會决議案、現白里安對於芳澤報告之日軍行動、正待中立國方面之徵實、白氏曾語施博士、一得確訊、即行通知、現理事會十二理事仍將於今日下午四時開秘密會議、（二十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　提案起草委員與施博士會商兩小時後、行政會某會員稱、此會結果令人興奮、可抱樂觀、施博士告路透社訪員、日兵撤回遼河左岸之消息、已否證實、渠甚願聞之、渠向起草委員會所表示之意見、大都爲撤兵與軍事行動問題云、今日午後行政會會員除中日外、將開會考慮起草委員會關於今晨進行之報告、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　白里安切實否認曾告施博士、如日本攻擊錦州、彼將以美國之助、援用會章第十六條以制日本之說、施博士曾語白里安、言及錦州局勢、白里安告以渠已接有日本决不　攻擊錦州極美滿保證、據最近瀋陽傳來日兵　撤回遼河之消息、顯已證實日本之保證矣、關於派員赴滿調查事之談判、現已届甚困難之階級、行政會現不俗於今日　午後舉行公開會議、施博士向調查團議案起草委員聲明日軍在滿之活動、繼續不已、故渠之地位甚覺爲難、如無日本履行撤兵諾言之担保、則國聯提議、無可討論云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　白里安曾請日本勿攻錦州、日本茲答稱、除自衛及警務計畫外、日兵不作任何敵對行爲、如華軍退出錦州、苟非日僑生命處於危境、日兵决不入中立區域、末謂日政府現準備訓令當地日員與中國地方官商訂中立區域之辦法（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>英美法武官</h3>
<p>視察錦州印象</p>
<p>（北平）　英美法武官連日視察錦州·溝帮子·打虎山一帶軍情、印象極佳、已判明日方近所藉口種種、决非事實、英參贊司徒博及英法領事均可佐證我軍無進攻準備、（二十八日專電）</p>
<h3>美政府</h3>
<p>制止日軍攻錦</p>
<p>認幣原違背諾言</p>
<p>擬向日提出抗議</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　昨夜此間接到日軍向錦州前進之報告、衆料美政府將提出嚴厲而迅速之抗議、指陳日軍此舉破壞幣原不攻錦州之諾言、此項抗議如果提出、將以九國公約爲根據、因此約担保中國土地之完整也、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　日飛機以炸彈轟擊錦州之報告、今日已引起國務院之大注意、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　路透社今日探悉、美政府向日政府交涉、不得進攻錦州、現已接到東京復電、聲明未有攻擊錦州之計畫、今日國務卿史汀生告新聞記者、日外相幣原前曾在此保證、渠不解何以仍有日兵進攻錦州之報告、十一月二十三日渠曾訓令駐日大使向幣原聲明、美政府甚重視日軍謀攻錦州之消息、當時幣原答稱、渠與陸相及參謀總長已議定不得對於錦州有敵對行爲、並以此項訓令電告滿洲日軍司令云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　美國務卿史汀生在華盛頓與新聞記者晤談時、公然詆毁日本在滿政策、此種消息已引起日人憤懣、大約日政府將以此事詢諸華盛頓證實、然後公佈一文、駁斥史汀生所指責各點、今日午後外部發言人謂負責之政治家如史汀生者、竟在目前危局中失其冷靜頭腦、後果將極重大、聞史汀生斥日本有完全佔據滿洲之意、果爾則日本將要求其說明發表此言之根據、史汀生此種言論、在中日兩方皆有不利影響、日本反動黨將認其言</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>含有威　侮辱之性質、而愈　昻、中國反日態度亦將因此言而轉堅、駐日美大使與日外相幣原互換公文、係秘密性質、今史汀生竟公佈之、日外務省視爲可驚可憾之事、史汀生不待事實證明、遽斥日本破壞諾言、尤可憤懣、史汀生此言不獨在形式上且在事實上、亦屬不幸、史汀生且謂日本於每次進攻後、輒表示歉忱、並允不再有此舉動、其實日本並無此種道歉等事、史汀生斥日軍發狂、此語直侮辱日皇、因日皇乃日本陸軍之大元帥也、外務省發方人末稱、史汀生之舉動、實違背九國公約第一條第四節、蓋依此約、簽約國不得作不利於友邦之行爲也、日本認張學良之行爲、不利於日本、但史汀生似承認此種行爲、而爲張學良張目、以堅其關於錦州撤兵事之態度云、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>光芒萬丈之曁南足球隊、昨曹臘克斯之打擊於逸園中、致以二對　失敗　羣雄逐鹿之史高托盃經此洶汰、永無前進之日矣、另覓出新徑、别圖出路、是所望於今日之曁南　裁判卡密克爾、</p>

<h3>柔兼剛臘克斯稱强</h3>
<p>臘克斯全隊輕捷善戰、柔而兼剛　如昔日强盛時代之葡萄牙相彷彿　論功行賞、守門大衛當居第　功、時在鐵蹄下奪球出險、中堅麥特嚴視陳鎭和　寸步不離、同侣亦能與相當之接濟、中衛綫乃呈堅硬狀態、惟下半時相形减色、兩内衛行動稍緩、尙無大過、前鋒頗有作爲、能盤能跑、左翼與右内、較衆尤佳　所獲三球、以末一球有可觀、前之二球、如遇善守者或不致成功也、</p>
<h3>不健全曁南遭失敗</h3>
<p>回顧曁南、引爲不幸者　厥爲守者之失職、雖其技况藝有進步、或　日有登峯造極之希望、然此全軍生死所擊之關隘、稍一失措、即誤大事、何已　誤而再誤乎、曁南之敗、半由於此、惟與其同負責任者、爲中衛線之不健全、梁樹棠抵抗甚力　莊陳較彰不如、從此曁南腹地、遂成多事之秋、馮江雖智勇雙全、亦難顧此失彼、前錄缺少正備軍、羅海光符和萱二人、戰鬥力頓見薄弱、臨門失機累累、後備楊保森身材活潑、患在處位失當、龍歷文挑送合度、惜乎舉動緩慢、陳鎭和梅洪寶成績驚人、丘東炎平平而已、</p>
<h3>戰雲下彼此堅相持</h3>
<p>入戰令下、互相逐鹿　龍歷文初顯身手、一脚驚人、敵人從中撓住　反兵來侵、久久始已、丘東炎得人之助、盤球深入、出脚稍緩、業被人衛抱球出險、繼陳鎭和如飛燕直撲敵門、接濟之人、千里徒勞、臘克斯五路並進、中衛線告陷、侵入腹地、攻打龍門、温守門二次接而復落、幾成大錯、斯時不失、如有天助、陳鎭和、再度進攻、又不得同伴相濟、功敗垂成、</p>
<h3>越半時陳鎭和建功</h3>
<p>臘克斯入將湯發尼會師反攻、兵臨城下湯氏得球撲進　幸間陳福忠救駕及時、否則殆矣、曁南内部稍安、前鋒急　、陳鎭和龍歷文先後在敵陣中、浩成危機、乃丘氏運用失當、毫無所得、亟至半小時後、龍左翼挑落門前、彼此互撲之際、陳鎭和自左射右、觸柱　網、爆竹之聲乃隨呼聲而起曁南率兵反陣、冀圖再接再厲</p>
<h3>指顧間臘克斯獲球</h3>
<p>指顧之間、臘克斯乘踢任意球之機、全軍反侵湯中鋒對門猛射、温守門躍起擊之、未中、再擊之、球出未遠、斯時敵兵包圍在五步之内、左内傑生還脚射去打人門中、曁南得來不易　失去太速、立下急令、謀再反攻、連擊不上、臘克斯又自左陲直入、舉脚攻門、温守門阨守要隘　化險爲夷、龍左翼暗渡陳倉　挑傳門前、陳鎭和迎之以頂、高出　尺以外、休戰令下、各得一球、</p>
<h3>盛勢下曁南遭不幸</h3>
<p>惡戰復起　梅洪寳一脚、球破空而下、空氣立轉緊張、中部陳丘楊三將逐影而至、球被守門所獲、三人合力推擁守門與球同時人網　裁判指爲有危險行動、入球失效、不料奇變突起、臘克斯左翼愛爾琪自遠遙打、江善敬側身讓與守門、温丘擬躍起擊之、湯　尼從旁揷入　帶球進門　曁南乃以一對二落後、一、隊互相對抗者十餘分鐘陳鎭和又單騎疾進、内衛自後阻之　碼被罰十二、丘東炎一脚成功、成　對二曁南氣燄又盛、叩關不已、最後八分鐘左翼愛爾琪自左挑右、右翼勞克哈對門一脚、又告命中梅洪寶當此危急之秋、連有三次良好之貢獻、均能反平大届、乃同伴處置失當、終以二對三失敗、</p>

<h3>救國銘·仿陋室銘調</h3>
<p>— 金至昕</p>
<p>兵不在多。有練則精。國不在弱。有志則興。恨彼倭賊。創吾不輕。今旣占東省。復又擾天津。重賞有勇夫。自强無懦丁。可以壯民心。退日軍。無敗北之可慮。無器械之不靈。土耳其往事。德意志盛名。同胞云。何懼之有。（移酬援馬）</p>

<h3>戰神前之對話（一）</h3>
<p>「日本旣已强奪東三省，現又進取錦州，一面砲轟天津、志在佔領北平，以遂他併呑中國之陰謀。我們應該怎樣應付？」</p>
<p>「戰！戰！戰！」</p>
<p>「您提倡非殺，何以主戰？」</p>
<p>「非殺的定議是；（一）不許我殺人；（二）不許我殺我：（三）不許人殺我；（四）不許人殺人。主戰剣便是在公道的和平絕望的時候，不得已用武力來制止日本人的屠殺，便是不許人殺我！」</p>
<p>「没有錢、没有子彈，如何能戰？」</p>
<p>「二十年來之内戰，錢是從那兒來的？子彈又是從那兒來的？」</p>
<p>「有錢，有子彈而没有勇敢之兵，也不能戰」</p>
<p>「學打仗是要在戰塲上學。中國的兵是在戰塲上磨練出來的。日本兵很少上過戰塲。與日俄戰場上磨練出來的日本兵已經死得差不多了，没有死的也是老得不能打了。中國有不怕死的兵、所痛心的，是怕死的武官太多！」</p>
<p>「中國的武官爲什麽怕死。」</p>
<p>「您在活動影片上看過印度拉查王之大象嗎？它滿笛是金銀財寳，所以行動不大方便。中國許多武官不但是「金滿身，」而且是三妻四妾，日夜沈醉在溫柔</p>
<p>鄕裏不能自拔，不肯自拔，如何捨得死？」</p>
<p>「這種敗類不除、如何能戰？」</p>
<p>「和日本打起仗來、這些人當中有的會放下屠刀立地成佛，有的自然會把金錢移存在外國銀行裏，帶了妻妾到租界上養老去了。那勇敢的，廉潔的，忠誠的武將也必定是如同活龍活虎一樣向上衝出來取而代之。黑軍一抵抗，萬國賓便捲逃，馬占山便如太陽一般從東方升了起來，這不是一個鐵打的證據嗎？」</p>
<h3>南湖軼事</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>南湖築别業於滬之靜安寺西。曰「小萬柳堂。」其額爲匋齋端方所書。結構絕勝。雖無山石花木之趣。而其命名取之元廉希憲。厥志可知已。</p>
<p>其夫人出自桐城望族。嫺書法。蓋今之文姬也。用筆實學靈飛。而瘦硬有神。其自署「桐城女子吳芝瑛」。早年時所作也。南湖壯歲攻舉子業。甲午捷秋闈。以第十名中式。時中日之戰甫息。而主考者以「大將龍旗掣海雲」之句爲詩題。鼓征東之士氣。南湖原卷末二聯有「氣呑看日島。名署伏波軍。」一若寫今日龍江之役者。昨老友秦君誦此以相質。不謂三十餘年後。成此討讖也。</p>
<p>南湖好名。故山陰女俠秋瑾及吳祿貞被剌。其墓表傳文。皆倩吳夫人書之。冀埀不朽。并彝之於西湖。嗣御史常徽。抗疏奏之。朝聞。平其墓。碑於是毁焉。夫人賴美國女敎士麥美德之力始得倖免。而南湖亦恐甚。復以夫人手書之楞嚴經。獻之江督。然後得解。女俠之遺骸。遂自浙遷湘。固爭之。卒不敵。迨淸亡。又復還瘞西冷。南湖與有力焉。</p>
<p>南湖遨游日東。雖潦倒殊甚。暱一下女春野者。心頗懽之。而與夫人日疏。恒數月無一音以達滬上存問。回國時。適國民革命軍到達之後。政地一淸。其鄕人吳敬恒以敎育經費乏人管理。促當軸以是職畀之。南湖聞。曰「是困我也。吾不諳稽核。其將何以處之。」後勉爲之。不三月即卸事而赴故都。今聞於月之中旬。歿於蕭寺。其夫人亦因病未往一奠。噫。吾江南又少一名士已。</p>
<h3>遼鶴歸來血淚多</h3>
<p>— 柳圃</p>
<p>舊友何君孟喬。江南人也。昔年營商赴瀋。邇以日寇騷擾。遂舉家回南。一昨邂逅瀛隅。因以北來事就詢之。何君晞嘘慨歎。悲憤塡膺。遽曰。君何問耶。總之東北已淪爲非人類之世界矣。</p>
<p>少頃。復續曰。自九一八事變而後。日人見我當局持無抵抗主義。知懦弱易爲。遂恃其武裝。焚燒搶掠。暴戾瓷睢。彌所不用其極。屠戮華民。勝如宰鷄。槍殺無辜。迺同割羊。即以余所親知灼見者數事爲子言之。當亦驚心動魄。懾魂雙神也。倭冦自進佔瀋陽。日以搜查爲事。美其名曰搜我軍政要人。實則恣意搶劫。以償彼所欲。有中人之家。麗姝新孀。遺嬰才逾七月。姝愛之。且以其爲孑裔也。不忍棄。兵來則撫之匿柴積中。不謂彌天之禍。即肇於此。蓋倭兵入門。搜之再四。無得。頽然欲返。乃牙牙之聲忽發自幽闐處。倭賊知計。遂循其徑窮索之。姝爲所獲。倭賊咕嚕大怒。意似責其不應迴避藏匿者。姝斜倚雲鬢。雙涙承睫。面白如紙。戰慄不已。倭兵四五人。載笑載言。陸續施以侮辱。終則將嬰孩抛空墮階碎首而去。噫。此何世耶。</p>
<p>友人張某。業絲綢。有子毛毛。甚聰慧。雖年僅六齡　而伶俐活潑。爲世罕覯。自春間就附近小學讀。識字甚多。張伉儷愛之綦甚。自時局猝變。各業人等。咸有戒心。張亦深居不出者數日矣。迺毛毛忽潛出門外。見日兵蹄騎。則又驚悸欲回。適爲一日警瞥見。强曳之去。張某固未知也。迨發覺。則門前鮮血殷然。孩屍橫陳矣。嗚呼。孩提何辜。遭此慘戮。野蠻獸性。曾曠古所未有而遞演於今日之文明世界。誠可爲人類恥痛矣。何君言未畢。涙淫淫下。</p>
<p>同胞乎。聆此其亦有動於中乎。黑暗時代與夫黑暗世界。惟血花始能射透曙光。發其霞彩。願我國人勉旃。</p>
<h3>讀糞翁書展記</h3>
<p>— 聽冰生</p>
<p>鄧子糞翁。亦今世之奇人。好縱酒。必醉始歇。似有胸中勃鬰之氣。非發於黃壚不可者然。於是捋袖作劈窠字。奮精歛神。如將軍拔劍。壯夫舉鼎。而凝息味之。則見娟秀嫵媚之意。俱寓於一鈎一畫間也。書刻展覽之第一日。余亦擠人叢中悉讀其作。覺集蘇大隸書「吾曹二三子。江南千萬峰。」放逸豪邁。撼人心魄。可與四尺鐘鼎摹齊侯鐘全文者。得並兩難。蓋近人作古。貎肖而已。未索其神體之所何繫也。翁所書第十號小立軸。寫佛頂山觀日出歌。爲翁今歲游普陀時作。歸示初稿。嘉其奇古可喜。今略竄數字。出之小楷。便覺寫作互佳。遂首先購定。將以縣之寒齋。供賞朝夕。豈非緣哉。翁執贄於虞山趙古泥先生之門。故金石深得其法。足以浩瀚之氣。蓋可並缶翁而黜浙皖矣。故其集史聯「石虎海漚鳥」「山濤閣道牛」。綴有自跋。云以刻印法作篆。以作篆法刻印。夫非深於藝事者。能道此隻字否耶。翁雖被摒於時。而亦惶憂時事。草書聯「尙有一椽留宿燕。豈無半黍到池魚。」</p>
<p>似憫水災而作。然則翁亦有心人也。我所謂奇者。何亦襄揚東野之流。不遇於世。而其動定遂逈異乎時者非歟。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>最近據西報記載</p>
<p>德京柏林某大報</p>
<p>建議。此次日本侵入中國東北區哉。海陸空軍副司令張學良氏　堅持不抵抗主義。苦心的保守和平。因此擬將下届的努培爾和平奬金。贈與張氏。這是恭維我國呢。還是侮辱我國。請國人捫心想想。又不知他們倘眞的將這和平奬金贈與張氏時。張氏受也不受。</p>
<p>前英國駐德大使達培廷貴族。Lord　D'Aberdeen有一個奇趣的習慣。遇了要緊的事情。爲免却忘懷起見。往往用鉛筆在袖口上記錄下來。但他仍要忘懷。有時總閙着遺失了他的備忘錄。他的隨員們弄慣了。總得賛他趕往洗衣作去將未洗的袖口追回來。</p>
<p>英國利物浦Liverpool　城中。有一家最新的影戲院。開映有聲影片。爲優待一般耳聾的觀衆起見。備有一種特製的聽筒。聾子走進戲院時。只須向招待員招呼一聲。立刻將聽筒送上。不另取費。不用時可以繫在椅上。十分便利。</p>
<h3>雄壯的文學（四）</h3>
<p>— 天疣</p>
<p>呵。經文學家一渲染。覺得這種「虎頭蛇尾。」「五分鐘熱度。」「能說不能行」的「臺灣相。」是非常可愧恥的了。但我們在五九·五三幾次反日。不都是前忠勇而後卑怯嗎。今日各地義勇軍紛紛成立了。是否不發現這種「臺灣箱。」我實在揑着一把汗的提心弔膽。</p>
<p>公度做的軍歌。共有二十四首。八首是出軍歌。說中國怎樣的可愛。而近日受列强壓迫。大抵是以庚子年八國聯軍入北京爲背景的。說。「病夫睡漢不成國。却要供奴役。雪恥報仇在今日。必。必。必。」八首是旋軍歌。說戰勝以後。怎樣廢除不平等條約的。現在不必舉牠。但有一首云。　　黑山綠林赤眉赤。亂民不算賊。鐫羗破胡復滅狄。雖勇亦小敵。當敵要當諸大國。國。國。國。　　用這種道理來評論今日的領兵大員。對内不妥洽。對外不抵抗。「勇於私鬥。怯於公戰。反秦人愛國的精神。「見小敵勇。見大敵怯。」無光武臨陣的態度。兩相比較。能不愧死嗎。最雄壯的。是那八首軍中歌。試全錄於此。來「奇文共欣賞。」（以「死戰向前。縱橫莫抗」爲韻。又句中「盤辮」和旗盤「黃龍。」稍與現在情形不同。）</p>
<p>堂堂堂堂好男子。最好沙塲死。艾炙眉頭瓜噴鼻。誰實能逃死。死只一回無浪死。死。死。死。　　阿娘牽裾密疑縫綫。語我無懋戀。我妻擁髻代盤辮。瀕行手指面。「敗歸何顏再相見。」戰。戰。戰。</p>
<p>戟門乍開雷鼓響。殺賊神先王。前敵鳴笳呼斬將。擒王手更癢。千人萬人吾直往。向。向。向</p>
<p>探穴直探虎穴先。何物是險艱。攻城直攻金城堅。誰能漫俄延。馬磨馬耳人磨肩。前。前。前</p>
<p>彈丸激雨刄旋風。血濺征衣紅。敵軍昨屯千罷熊。今日空營空。萬旗一色盤黃龍。縱。縱。縱</p>
<p>層毫高築受降城。諸將咸膝行。降奴脫劍鞠躬迎。單于頸繫纓。四圍鼓吹鐃歌聲。橫。橫。橫</p>
<p>秃髮萬頭纒黑索。多少戎奴縛。緋紅十字張油幕。處處夷傷藥。軍令如山禁殘虐。莫。莫。莫</p>
<p>不喜封侯虎頭相。鑄作功臣像。不喜燕然碑百丈。表示某家將。所喜軍威莫敢抗。抗。抗。抗</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（三十一）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>「嗄！他們是來募捐的呀！」鄕下人有些覺悟。但是他爲什麽要提了那個梆來？這也學了那敲梆化緣的和尙嗎？</p>
<p>「募捐便募捐便了，提了這個東西，又有什麽用呢？」鄕下人忍不住的要問了。</p>
<p>「這是一個竹筒呀。」那個穿藍長衫，頭髮剪得一截齊的女學生，輕倩他這樣的說了。</p>
<p>「我也知道是一個竹筒，你們帶出那個竹筒來，做什麽用的呢？」鄕下人所奇怪的，就是那個東西，</p>
<p>「這是捐錢用的。捐下來的錢。不論鈔票，洋錢，解子，銅元，都塞在裏面，只能放進去，不能拿出來。而且最好是捐錢的人自己放進去，要拿出來，除非要劈破那個竹筒，然後可以拿出來，這也是表示不能把捐下來的錢，藏在各人袋裏的意思。」另一個學生，把所以用竹筒的緣由說明了。</p>
<p>「道就不差。」鄕下人表示贊成的意思。「從前我看見許多辦賑濟的人，人家都稱爲大善士，大善士。他本來也是一個窮光蛋，辦賑辦了好幾年，忽然有錢起來了。也不曾調查他的賑濟機關，到底有實惠？没有實惠？他自己却成了一個富人。人家送了他一個匾額，寫着「善人是富」四個大字，我還疑心人家捐下來錢，上了他自己腰包咧？現在你們要敲破了竹筒，然後可以拿出來，這好比我們鄕下所用的積貯罐了。」</p>
<p>鄕下人這時很爲高興，用手來提提他們的竹筒，說道：</p>
<p>「分量很輕咧，只怕你們没有募捐到多少錢吧。」</p>
<p>「捐到錢的多少，和竹筒的輕重，没有關係咧。」一個女學生，又看着鄕下人笑了。</p>
<p>「這又是什麽緣故？」</p>
<p>「你瞧！我們這裏有兩個竹筒。一個比較的輕，一個比較的重，但是劈開竹筒來看，那輕的錢反捐得多，重的錢反捐得少。因爲輕的裏面。有好幾張鈔票；重的裏面，却祇有一大把銀錢和銅幣。所以我們說輕重是分不出捐欵多少的。」</p>
<p>鄕下人恍然大悟，他從身邊一個褡褳内，掏了半天，掏出一塊袁頭大銀元來，鄭重其事的說道：</p>
<p>「好！好！我也捐一塊錢。」</p>

<h3>厘拆週末之今昔觀</h3>
<p>市場槪况　往常每逢星期六、銀行下午休業、市氣固然閑散、惟今届値銀洋現底恐慌殆甚之候、雖銀行收解疏淡、而營業上之夙仰週轉者、究屬困難逾常、故此届週末釐拆氣象、較往昔迥乎不同、而市氣之淸淡、則反較愈甚焉、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢二分六厘一毫二忽半、午市爲七錢二分六厘二毫半、結果較前日午市回昂一厘光景、（銀拆）早午兩市仍與前日同價、爲三錢五分、銀行掛牌一錢四分、劃頭加水一錢五六分、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋早市爲六錢四分七厘半、午市同價、較前日午市似昂半厘、交易早市四千角、午市二千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢五分、午市爲六錢五分一厘、交易早市十四萬五千角、午市一萬五千角、銅元與前日亦同、爲三百七十六千文、交易二萬七千餘串、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　（銀欵）昨日銀行收解消息、計華商收解票欵一百八九十萬、外商收解票欵九十餘萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解七百餘萬、押欵四十餘萬、進倉五十萬、出倉六十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千一百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百六十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七十餘萬、收現三四十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出一百三十六萬五千、午市一百○四萬五千、鈔票早市六萬、午市五萬、場外鈔票早市十三萬五千、午市十萬○五千、銀行交易早市互市六十萬、午市互市五十五萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百二十餘萬、鈔票進出一百七十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百七十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百三十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百三十餘萬、小錢莊交易四十餘萬、</p>
<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>最近之維持債價觀</p>
<p>停止期貨新買賣</p>
<p>現貨仍照常開做</p>
<p>近數月來、以受日人侵略之影響、外交形勢、</p>
<p>異常嚴重、證劵市價、以人心虚弱、供過於求、一落千丈、雖有金融業及各方之努力維持、迄難挽回頽勢、而最近兩週、跌落尤烈、一般金融市塲及一般投資者、均受重大壓迫、處茲形勢、使不急圖阻抑市價、經濟前途、實極危險、財部有鑒於此、早擬有緊急處置、特由監理員轉令華商證劵交易所、略謂目下各項債劵、均照修例付息還本、且今稅收暢旺、似此價跌不已、實無理由、規定三項辦法、以示限制、令交易所遵照辦理、（一）規定標準價格、以十一月念四日下午收盤價爲最低價格、（二）債劵價跌至標準價格時、即依標準價計算、不能再低、（三）塲外交易　係屬違法、絕對禁止、證交鑒茲形勢、議定暫停全部賣買新交易、專做了結、以待市價之回堅、並於該所市塲發佈通告、茲錄如下、</p>
<p>茲經本所理事會議决、自即日起停止全部份期貨新買賣、其現貨交易、照常開做、惟價格須遵照部令、以念四日收盤價爲最低限制、如原有十二月期交易欲轉入一月期者、作雙方掉期論、其價格亦以不背部令本月份同樣根價以上爲限、再九月份本所經手抵押之各種債劵、得照部令限價出售、買方可任轉户、特此通告、</p>

<h3>昨日證劵市塲情形</h3>
<p>場外交易轉帳爲額頗鉅</p>
<p>當日交易稀少價稍上漲</p>
<p>議定明年一月份交割期</p>
<p>昨（念八日）華商證劵交易所以期貨新買賣、旣已全部停止、特允各經紀人之請求、將前塲外交易、轉人所帳、藉便從容了結、惟以昨後市爲限、以後不能再有此項轉帳、轉帳係雙方新做入</p>
<p>收、是項轉帳交易、爲額甚鉅、除上午未開市、亦未進行各項帳務外、後市三時半、始行辦理完畢、統計各債劵轉帳總額九百四十八萬五千元、内計統稅一百七十六萬五千元、鹽稅一百三十九萬五千、二○關一百念八萬、一九善一百六十萬零五千、二○捲九十八萬、裁兵一百零三萬五千元、編遣六十九萬、一九關五十七萬五千元、整理六厘十三萬五千元、九六公債二萬五千元、三時半以後方開市、期現貨成交均稀少、計現貨開出一萬六千元、期貨共祗一百四十二萬元、至言各債劵市價之趨勢、以賣出交易受絕對限制、祗准做了結交易、而買方則可自由買進、以是市上需要轉旺、價得抬高一元左右、惟近無交易之數種現貨、均下降甚距、觀債市前途、如外交形勢不再惡化、則以新賣出受限制之故、似可望漸漸抬漲云、茲將昨下午一盤各債劵價高低漲落統計列後、</p>

<h3>紗花　交割日之現紗花</h3>
<p>期紗停市現銷亦淸　紗布極甚閑散、以海外狀况甚疲、暴日在天津騷擾、險惡愈烈、致人心尤虚、實需交易更缺、標紗以本月底辦理交割手續、停市一日、客帮由廣東内地同行買去二百包、行情平疲云、</p>
<p>現棉有到無銷　棉市甚疲、現貨交易全無、但外棉愈疲、來源計姚花八百五十包、下沙花二百五十包、</p>
<h3>本月紗交割量不大</h3>
<p>實行交割者祇一百五十包</p>
<p>十一月份人標紗市勢　在月初尙堅、因暴日搶佔瀋陽、人民激憤、愛國運動熱烈、拒絕劣貨、本紗銷路大暢、底貨單薄、故價格在六十兩之間盤旋、後以暴日在東北騷擾愈烈、致金融日趨緊張、客銷停滯、商業難以發展、各帮一無生氣、現紗需要日减、於是賣　氣驟織、市盤遂發現破綻、跌進六十兩關、中途以銀根難鬆、又破五十兩關門、嗣至月末、以經濟關係、收貨者較爲缺乏、跌勢尤烈、最後一盤、爲一百四十五兩二錢、在一月間差價計十六兩之巨、變動可爲巨矣、結果殘餘六千四百包、實行祇十支人鐘一百五十包、其餘均爲自行交割、交割價爲一百四十八兩、交割榮興一千五百包、申新五百包爲最多、收貨愼記一千零五十包、公泰七百包爲最多云、茲錄十一月期棉紗交割配合表於左、</p>

<h3>本月棉交割經過</h3>
<p>交割價三十一兩一</p>
<p>十一月份漢標花在月初、市氣極其堅挺、以各路來貨凋敝、漢路不暢、致一部份棉商及漢帮拉緊　始終不放、極力看高、四圍環境雖不良、美印兩棉、一致趨跌　種種惡劣之情態、一槪抺殺不論、然各廠以東棉價高、外棉五六兩盡量採辦、外棉包額愈積愈巨、於是本棉之生意完全被外棉侵奪矣、然多頭依然挺拔、且有軋空之說、價格在三十三兩　四錢之間盤旋、嗣至月末最後幾日、有决意收貨之棉商、以銀根奇緊、金融難以支持、將多額悉數斬結、反行交貨三四千擔、於是市盤大跌特跌、最後一盤、爲三十兩零六錢五　在此一月間、差價有三兩一錢、可爲巨矣、結果殘餘爲二萬一千二百擔、實行交割計約六七千擔、交割平均價爲三十一兩二錢、查交出和傎四千三百擔、瑞源一千九百擔、新亨一千四百擔、收貨天隆一千四百擔、逹記一千八百擔匞同興二千四百擔云、茲錄交割配合表於左、</p>

<h3>美棉跌入六分關内</h3>

<h3>上週美棉續形疲落</h3>
<p>紐約廿七日來電報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉市續形反動、近來所據爲樂觀之情形、又以證劵小麥及銀價之不振、而重形失望、棉市雖形疲落、但以空頭抵補、及同業買進、故向下之勢、較形和緩、南方現貨之高、足令買者受限制、但合作社及日本則均在西南方面購進也、有苦干業中人以爲末次（十二月八日）之政府報告、更可望增加、姑無論十月十二日紐鄂倫司聯邦農政局所簽定之辦法、及傑克孫地方會議所採决减種棉田之法制、一一見諸實行、而預料於市面恐仍有影響也、同業中對於最近所訂定之法制、及棉田之縮减、仍都懷欵、但有人以爲苟有幾許之實行、則於目前南方之囤積運動、必可增其力量也云、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>火價天晴回鬆</p>
<p>南頭　昨日來源三十號左右、走銷初呆後爽、蘇同白粳早間極淡、價續軟化、店方銀根奇緊、進意頗淡、中關續跌三角、宿次反覺微挺、薄稻到多銷淡、行情又低四角、變陰元本城問訊尙好、到頭不甚湧旺、降低半尺、洋杜尖無榮辱、呈下游之象、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日寰路來船尙多、本街交易不佳、常錫江陰等貨、到頭不斷、買氣沉寂、行情因之萎疲、大盤見短五分至一角不等、靑石飛來鳳薄稻、本街沙船帮交易不多、故趨勢頂定次軟、杜埠尖頂貨尙穩、中關呆滯、價形略軟、陰化高貨缺仍定、中關賤而欠化暢、崑山白燴粳及早稻各低三角、</p>
<h3>漢口帮試辦小絞米</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、略見轉機、因有漢口帮在市辦裝、人心轉好、本街亦有問津、市面乃見活動矣、統市成交小絞米二千包、價二元○一角半、一號西貢五百包、價十一元二角、期貨開小絞四月份二千噸、價四兩九錢、由禪臣開出、亦係本街與長江帮分去、</p>
<h3>近期粉暴縮五分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市雖見巨大之變動、本月份以特殊關係跌勢之猛、竟出意外、查大跌之原因、初以洋麥報價、又跌六七角至一元左右、人心已經一虚、旋以北帮觀望、雜牌粉之銷場、必受打擊、復以銀根奇緊、套頭生意、全不顧及、聞華豐泰隆等廠、有相當之棧單交出、市面旣不佳、套頭又少、故聞開盤迄收盤、步步暴跌、收盤之最低儥、竟跌至一兩八錢五分七厘半、較前日收價計落五分二厘半、至遠期各月份、跌勢較差、三四月份尤覺平穩、因業外多頭、仍有收進也、結果本月份較前日跌五分、十二月份跌一分、一月份跌二分、二月份跌一分二厘半、三月份小七厘半、四月份小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥步小</h3>
<p>人心虚軟異常</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面又呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價又小六七角至一元不等、大部份人心、自然虚軟異常、因此各月份開價均見步小、不過國外報價雖小、定貨者未見活動、良以國事如是危迫、所謂有此心而無此力、兼以業外略有收進、市氣遂覺略定也、結果十二月份較前日跌四分、一二月份跌四分、三月份跌三分、四月份跌二分云、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>泉泡圓地價轉穩</p>
<p>泉州大泡桂圓、自申市回跌以來、趨勢仍難穩定、良以時局惡劣、銷路不振所致、故後輪所到之貨、號方又擯持未開、看勢有再降之象、惟昨據泉州函訊、地頭近有南洋帮採辦、價不能續鬆、轉趨挺勢、查存底亦屬不多、奈申市走銷不暢、終難隨地價而回好也、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>灰經運美二百件</p>
<p>美郵林肯總統號昨日出口、体埠乾利等共有八繭灰經二百件、裝往舊金山、其中一百零八件、係轉往紐約、由舊金山交裝火車運往云、</p>
<h3>屯溪珍眉銷暢價堅</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、屯溪來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英莊協和錦隆同孚福時等行、進意仍趨濃厚、針眉珠茶等項　交易亦頗爲壯盛、全市成交一千二百餘箱、珍眉售開頂盤一百十五兩、珠茶售盤九十二兩、針眉售盤五十五兩、市價均頗爲堅硬、惟婺源北路有色珍眉、行家雖有電報發出、但局勢仍無重大進展云、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>福建帮來電停辦五金品</p>
<p>昨日五金市情異常淡薄、良以時局嚴重、銀根緊急之關係耳、惟昨日福建帮、突接該埠來電、對於五金及其他各貨、均停止採辦、其原因爲連日日艦增加、人心惶惶、况銀根奇緊、生意寂寞、故均有减少交易之舉、是以市場開出、昨日益覺寥落、所幸人心安定、故各市行情、賴以無大上落云、</p>
<h3>煤炭</h3>
<p>白煤屑走銷頗暢</p>
<p>各種白煤屑、日來走銷頗暢、蓋本埠各煤球廠家及煤結作等、均有大批買進、裡路如嘉興帮、亦有不少辦去、售價因亦見好、昨市成交紅崎屑二百十噸、價十一兩、山西屑二百噸、價九兩、馬克屑二百六十噸、價八兩五錢、印度屑八十噸、價八兩二錢半、復州屑一百卅噸、價九兩八錢半、柳江屑五十噸、價七兩云、</p>

<h3>法將福煦</h3>
<p>歐戰日記　·顧·昻·若·譯</p>
<p>進兵萊茵河</p>
<p>幾天後、聯軍根據休戰條約進兵萊茵河、佔領萊茵河左岸德國領土和右岸橋頭堡三處、聯軍實踐十一月十一日的休戰條約是否已向協約各國盡了責任、聯軍總司令所簽訂的休戰條約並不足爲和平條約、甚且不能算爲和平初步、休戰條約不過使衝突暫行停頓和流血暫時停止、以便交戰國有商訂和約的機會、休戰條約雖則載有政治的和財政的條文須即履行、但對於戰爭結束後交戰國的地位仍没有决定、恊約政府業已保留了提出和約决定交戰國地位的重要任務、聯軍將士因須獲得保障以便協約政府可以完成這任務、</p>
<p>萊茵河是天然的屏藩、德國足以藉其掩護、動搖聯軍的地位以利和議、現在聯軍進佔萊茵、和議時德政府不得不就範、和議不成亦可進而再戰、一九一九年六月二十八日、德代表在凡爾賽完全接受協約國的條件簽訂和平條約即其明證、况且萊茵的佔領更足爲償付賠欵的擔保品、所以萊茵佔領了、協約政府便可提出任何和平條件而使敵人履行、</p>
<p>休戰條約的簽訂在我軍方面認爲時機尙未成熟、延遲數日或幾星期則德軍完全潰敗、我軍便更有利、我軍原預定十一月十四日在莫斯爾河之東進攻、後以十一月十一日的停戰令而作罷、這方面攻勢戰如其進行順利、那末聯軍二百哩的戰綫又可進展二十哩、</p>
<p>七月中旬以來、聯軍一再進攻、德軍逐步敗退、擒獲敵軍官七千九百九十人、兵士三十五萬五千人、大砲六千二百十五門、機關槍三萬八千六百二十二架、實有史以來所未有、</p>
<p>德軍崩潰不下二百師、成千成萬的敗兵、在混亂裏且戰且退、及至我軍增加了大砲和機關槍始將敵軍就範、我軍可以乘勝直趨萊茵、退却中的敵軍爲我猛烈砲火轟擊、遂至潰不成軍、卒至不堪苦戰而叛變、全國響應、革命於是發生了、</p>
<p>德軍劇戰、四年至此全部瓦解、聯軍長驅直入亦無力抗拒、遂不能求和以圖自存、（未完）</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>近代論壇（續）·徐·睡·麟</h3>
<p>英國狄更生著　梁遇春譯</p>
<p>第　個發言的是馬卡替、他是愛爾蘭的無政府主議者、非常的不滿意亞力遜的意見、聽得很不耐煩、在亞氏剛欲停止的時候他就急速起立、開口第一句話、「若使社會主義是這樣子一個東西、願上帝宥我、因爲我自己曾經說過是個社會主義者、但是社會主義實在不是這麽一回事、我要救一救這個名詞、免得被濫用、」</p>
<p>他的無政府主義的思想、是否認政治社會一切所發生的强迫的力量、要絕對的自由、和平、博愛、主張要暴力打倒舊社會、與亞力遜的主張、完全站在反對的地位、</p>
<p>第六個發言的是享利·馬丁·他是懷疑主義的大學敎授、用理智眼光、以能經騐的事實、來批評這兩個極端的主張、他說、</p>
<p>「一切政治信仰總跳不出兩個極端的範圍、雖也是個個不同、這兩個極端我呌做集產主義和無政府主義、這兩個主義都是不惜犧牲一切、去逹到一個目的、丨丨集產主義所企望的是秩序、無政府主義所企望的是自由、」</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade the Chinese Concession in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Consuls of Various Nations Stationed in Tianjin Urge Japan to Cease Firing</p>
<p>U.S. Government Intervenes with Japan, Forbidding an Attack on Jinzhou</p>
<p>Japanese Sources Report Japanese Troops on the Beining Railway Ordered to Withdraw</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Resumed Shelling the Chinese Concession Yesterday</p>
<p>Machine Guns and Field Guns Set Up on Rooftops</p>
<p>Plainclothes Troops Attack Our Defense Lines in Three Routes</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Discovered in the Vicinity of Ningjia Bridge</p>
<p>Chinese Police Vanish Within 300 Meters</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From 7:30 PM to 8:20 PM on the evening of the 27th, the Japanese army fired more than ten shells from Haiguang Temple and released more than ten bursts of machine-gun fire. From 11:00 PM to 12:00 AM, they fired two more shells and several bursts of machine-gun fire. At 1:00 AM on the morning of the 28th, two to three hundred plainclothes troops rushed out of the Japanese Concession, attacking our defense lines in three routes. One route attacked Rongye Street, another attacked Nantou, and the third attacked Ningjia Bridge. Several Japanese soldiers climbed onto the rooftops of civilian houses on each route, using machine guns to strafe our defense positions. Our security forces were ordered not to return fire and instead used hand grenades to resist. The Japanese planned to shell our defense positions from Haiguang Temple again. The sound of artillery was constant and uncountable. After a half-hour of intense fighting, the plainclothes troops collapsed, and the Japanese soldiers also retreated. The Public Security Bureau and the Provincial Government were originally the main targets of the Japanese artillery fire, but the telephone bureau's tall building at the Zhakou blocked the artillery fire. On the night of the 26th, a shell struck the upper floor of the bureau. The bureau chief, Duan Maolan, immediately protested to the Japanese consul. The Japanese consul promised to instruct the Japanese soldiers to be careful. The Japanese soldiers then set up two 12cm field guns on the top floor of Mitsui &amp; Co.'s building. Unexpectedly, a shell landed in the Italian Concession, and the Italian soldiers immediately fired two bursts of machine-gun fire and two warning blank shots. The Italian consul protested to the Japanese consul. Therefore, since the evening of the 27th, Zhakou and Mitsui &amp; Co. have not fired any more shells. From the night of the 26th to the morning of the 28th, our police force, because they were not allowed to return fire, suffered more than thirty casualties. The plainclothes troop leaders were not injured. From 4:30 AM to 5:00 AM and from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM on the morning of the 28th, the Japanese soldiers fired several shells each time. The Chinese streets were under curfew from noon to 4:00 PM on the 28th, allowing people to buy food and fuel. Merchants and residents within the firing line were allowed to relocate. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The First Section of the First District and the Sixth Section of the First District were disturbed by Japanese soldiers and plainclothes troops every night because they were within 300 meters. They have all moved to safe areas to work. Now there are no police within 300 meters, making it an area where plainclothes troops and Japanese soldiers are rampant. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 5:00 PM, plainclothes troops and Japanese soldiers were discovered in Xiguangkai, Nankai, and Xiatou. Our police force calmly resisted. On the morning of the 28th, a Japanese private named Nakao attacked our defense line and was wounded in the left wrist by a hand grenade. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military purchased 400 head of cattle and 300 boxes of kerosene. Strips of cloth were wrapped around the bodies of the cattle. According to intelligence, the Japanese army has decided to occupy Tianjin on the night of the 28th. The first batch will pour kerosene on the cattle, set them on fire, and drive them into the Chinese streets to cause a major fire. The second batch of plainclothes troops will attack, and the third batch of Japanese soldiers will launch an assault. Our side has made full preparations. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

Two Japanese fighter planes arrived in Tianjin on the afternoon of the 28th and were assembled for deployment at the Haiguang Temple Jibei Racecourse. Japanese troops set up machine guns and steel cannons on the rooftops of all buildings with three or more stories in the Japanese Concession. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army issued another notice on the 28th, stating that anyone who hinders military operations or enters the surrounded area will be killed without exception. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The French Municipal Council has dispatched special teams to the sixth floor rooftop of the Tianxiang Market every night since the 28th to observe the Japanese army's shelling. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Duan Maolan, the director of the telephone bureau, transported a large quantity of food to the bureau in a car at noon on the 28th to comfort the employees and supervised the repair of the doors and windows damaged by Japanese gunfire. Suddenly, several bullets flew over. Duan questioned the Japanese military, who claimed to know nothing. He questioned the Italian Consul, who also said that no shots were fired. The handguns of Chinese police officers in the Japanese Concession have been confiscated by the Japanese military. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Rumors were rampant in the afternoon, claiming that the Japanese army had decided to occupy Tianjin on the night of the 28th, but our defensive fortifications have been reinforced with iron plates, making it difficult for Japanese soldiers to attack. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese soldiers were discovered in the vicinity of Ningjia Bridge on the afternoon of the 28th. The New Tianjin Evening News Extra reported that it had been occupied by Japanese soldiers. Officials denied this. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Westerners from the Methodist Church in Nantou were rescued from danger by American soldiers driving armored cars on the 28th. Shops in the French Concession were ordered to close at 5:00 PM on the evening of the 28th. British, American, and French soldiers jointly deployed for defense, and the situation is serious. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning at around 2:00 AM, the sound of gunfire erupted again. Chinese territory and the Japanese Concession bombarded each other. It is reported that several of the shells fired from the Japanese Concession landed in the open space of the Methodist Church, but there was no apparent material damage. However, the people of the church moved elsewhere today. This afternoon, fifty Japanese sailors arrived here from Tanggu. They landed on the riverbank in the British Concession and entered the Japanese Concession by car. China has responded to the Japanese demand that Chinese troops withdraw six miles from the city, etc. The Japanese authorities consider it vague and unsatisfactory, but there has been no action yet. The Chinese here believe that a large number of Japanese sailors are now coming here by boat from Tanggu. The first batch has now arrived, and the rest will continue to arrive. After they all arrive, the Japanese will take action. The telephone bureau was hit by shells on Friday night, and the damage was not light. Telephone communication is only occasionally possible.

In order to seek peace, our authorities have accepted the advice of the consuls. If the Japanese army does not shell on the night of the 28th, the security forces will withdraw from Hebei on the 29th.

According to the most reliable sources, those who set out along the Beining Railway yesterday were a mixed brigade, traveling on six trains. The first batch departed at 5:00 AM yesterday morning, and the last batch departed at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

<h3>Under International Indignation</h3>
<p>Honjo Orders Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Shenyang Japanese Army Headquarters Declares</p>
<p>Japanese Troops to Withdraw to Railway Zone Today</p>
<p>(Shenyang) After several days of calm, there was a sudden and strange change in the Manchurian Military Bureau. The change came very quickly and was quite puzzling. Shenyang was indeed astonished. According to the Honjo Headquarters, it has now been ordered that all Japanese troops withdraw into the South Manchurian Railway zone. The Honjo Headquarters was unwilling to tell people about the actions of the troops yesterday and did not explain the reasons. At that time, it was generally believed that the advance of a brigade of Japanese soldiers along the Beining Railway was intended to attack Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan, and the Tianjin situation might become even more dangerous. However, the truth about the actions of this brigade of Japanese soldiers has become clearer. After news of ongoing fighting in Tianjin was transmitted, there was no follow-up telegram last night. However, this morning, an official at the Honjo Headquarters declared that no news had continued to come from Tianjin but also stated that, because the situation in Tianjin had eased, the Japanese troops that had gone down the Beining Railway were withdrawing to the east of the Liao River and that the withdrawal had already begun. It was then announced that the Japanese army would withdraw entirely to the South Manchurian Railway zone, stating that each detachment outside the railway zone had now been reduced to the absolute minimum number and that the remaining troops would retreat into the railway zone. The six trains carrying a brigade of Japanese soldiers along the Beining Railway yesterday are expected to return north today. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tokyo telegram on the 28th: According to reliable sources, because the U.S. attitude has hardened, the Japanese government has decided to stop the attack on Jinzhou. This morning on the 28th, it urgently telegraphed Honjo, ordering the frontline to quickly convey the complete withdrawal of the advancing troops on the Beining Line by air.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official sources here, at 8:00 PM last night, Honjo, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Manchuria, had already issued an order for the troops advancing towards Jinzhou to withdraw to Shenyang as quickly as possible. However, because there are several points on the railway that have been damaged, the return will be slightly delayed, but it is expected that they will return within the day. In the general opinion of people here, the order to withdraw the troops was fortunately issued before Secretary of State Stimson's remarks regarding Japan were published. It is said that yesterday's departure of the troops was the result of public outrage triggered by the Chinese troops' attack on the Japanese Concession in Tianjin. It is believed that if Stimson's remarks had been heard earlier, the morale of the troops would have been even more outraged, and the order to withdraw the troops would inevitably have been delayed. According to official sources, the army's purpose is not to continue occupying land, but to break up the concentrations of Chinese troops that are endangering peaceful order. As for local civil affairs, they are prepared to hand them over to the Chinese to handle themselves. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a telegram was received from the Shenyang News, stating that the Japanese troops who set out along the Beining Line yesterday have now withdrawn to Xinmin. It is reported that this is because the military authorities received an urgent instruction from the Japanese government. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese army on the Beining Line began to withdraw this morning. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The rumor that the Japanese army on the Beining Line has been withdrawn to Xinmin shows that the commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria had the intention of disobeying the government's instructions, but has now obeyed the order and will not attack Jinzhou. A telegram from Shenyang this afternoon also stated that Honjo has decided to withdraw all Japanese troops west of Shenyang to the railway zone within the next week. The Japanese believe that if Zhang Xueliang implements his proposal to withdraw the Jinzhou troops into the customs and establish a neutral zone, then the situation can be optimistic. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The plan of the Japanese army in Manchuria has suddenly changed. After the troop movements are completed, how will the Japanese army be allocated? Tonight, the representative of the Honjo Headquarters made a clearer statement, saying that the troop locations outside the railway zone are approximately Jilin, Juliuhe, Qiqihar, and Zhengjiatun or Taonan. Before the Angangxi battles, the small number of troops stationed in Jilin, Juliuhe, Zhengjiatun, or Taonan will not be increased in the future. The troops stationed in Qiqihar will be reduced to a regiment. Although the withdrawal of troops from various locations must wait until direct negotiations begin before they can be withdrawn to the South Manchurian Railway zone, the withdrawal of troops stationed in Qiqihar is not tied to negotiations and may be withdrawn soon. The brigade of Japanese soldiers transferred from Korea to Manchuria at the beginning of the incident no longer needs to be stationed in Manchuria, so it can be returned to its original defense soon. The mixed brigade that set out along the Beining Line yesterday is now returning to Shenyang in succession. Arrangements are currently being made to house the officers, who are to be billeted in the homes of Japanese people here. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Act Ferociously</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Feels Greatly Uneasy</p>
<p>Little Progress in Finding a Solution</p>
<p>Public Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>(Paris) Because major battles have occurred in Manchuria and Japan's military attitude is so fierce, and a political crisis is brewing, the prospects for a peaceful resolution are extremely bleak, except that the League of Nations group is still unable to clearly release. Tonight, the secret meeting of the Council convened for two hours, but in reality, it can be said that there was no progress in finding a solution. After the meeting adjourned, a League of Nations figure told people, "We do not need to be disappointed yet. Although it is difficult to expect an agreement to be reached this week, we can continue to discuss it within the next week." The League of Nations agenda is now clearly being obstructed because of the declaration by the Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji, who said, "I am exhausted to the utmost and cannot continue to follow you gentlemen." Tonight, both Chinese representative Shi and Japanese representative Yoshizawa sent memoranda to Japan, reporting on the critical situation in Jinzhou. As for the Council's draft proposal, it is said that the Japanese side has not yet agreed to the proposal to establish a neutral zone in Jinzhou, and has also made reservations on the conditions for a ceasefire and troop withdrawal. It is heard that the Chinese side has already made major concessions on the date of troop withdrawal. (Guomin News on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A staff member of the League of Nations Secretariat stated today that because China refuses to accept any resolution of the Council until the crisis in Jinzhou has subsided, it is predicted that a public meeting is unlikely to be held before next Tuesday. The twelve Council members held a secret meeting at 4:00 PM this afternoon to consider the new resolution drafted by the drafting committee in the morning and adjourned at 4:30 PM. All twelve Council members approved the new resolution, and now only</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Malicious Wave and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>4</p>
<p>Since the Northeast Incident of September 18th, the entire national community has been immediately agitated by the terrifying wave surging from Tokyo. It is trapped in extreme alarm and unease. Although China is the one directly suffering from the persecution of this malicious wave, due to its agitation and subversion, the beautiful dream of world peace has been shattered. Humanity's future is showing signs of a great disaster to come. The inevitable terror and sorrow of future calamities.</p>
<p>When the incident occurred, it coincided with a gathering of the League of Nations. With the arrival of this malicious wave, the League of Nations, due to its responsibilities and prestige, could not avoid taking action. Therefore, the League of Nations is positioned between Japan and China. At the same time, it is also positioned between war and peace. The League of Nations is entrusted by China and is also a protective barrier for maintaining peace. How to block this malicious wave that is persecuting all of humanity is something that not only China, but also the people of the world, are eagerly awaiting from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Since China has been attacked by this malicious wave, it has entrusted the right to exist of the nation-state to the League of Nations without reservation. China has followed the League of Nations' advice on everything that can be endured and conceded, maintaining the League of Nations' prestige. Now, it has finally retreated to the point of sacrificing the sacred territorial administrative sovereignty, designating Jinzhou as a neutral zone, and requesting that the nations send troops to guard it. Today's telegrams also state that China has made major concessions on the date of Japan's troop withdrawal, etc. These are all things that should not be conceded, but they have been conceded. Although our people can endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, how can they be so unpromising as to acknowledge this unlimited concession? Yet the Japanese are taking an inch and wanting a mile, and the military aggression continues unabated. Under these circumstances, can the League of Nations still seek compromise between the two parties and prevent the rupture of peace by bending over backwards?</p>
<p>However, the League of Nations only knows how to advise our representatives and pressure our representatives, but it cannot exercise its authority to provide a strong guarantee for justice and righteousness. Everything that Japan demands is complied with in every possible way, which proves that the League of Nations has been overwhelmed by Japan's malicious wave. The evil forces in Tokyo are attacking China through the League of Nations. In other words, it is as if the League of Nations is brazenly acting as an agent for Japan to implement its consistent policy of aggression. This makes this aggression more skillful in form and obtains a solid foundation in the international arena.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, China has entrusted the entire life of the Chinese nation to the feet of the League of Nations. However, the League of Nations is accommodating Japan in every way. In other words, it is no different from making China bow its head and accept Japan's attacks through the League of Nations. However, at the end of endurance and concession, the cannons of Liaodong shake the earth, and the chaos in Tianjin is once again stirred up. Where will we retreat if we retreat again? If demarcating neutral zones is the only way to prevent malicious waves, then it must be done in Tianjin, Shanghai, and all other provinces and regions where Japan can attack and cause disturbances. The facts are clear and the benefits and harms are fully visible. Yet our authorities do not realize this and make the extremely ridiculous request that the Japanese army swear not to invade the areas from which the Chinese troops withdraw. Alas, the long night is endless, and the sound sleep is deep. When will the dream end? When will the night end?</p>
<p>If the League of Nations were to truly withdraw, as Briand indicated the other day, to what kind of power would our country entrust itself? Heaven helps those who help themselves. Let the people of the country think about this carefully.</p>
<h3>Domestic Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>Awaiting the Agreement of the United States' Dawes with the Chinese and Japanese Governments; However, because the Chinese Government was facing the danger of Japanese troops invading Jinzhou, it refused to accept the resolution. Therefore, it is expected that a public meeting cannot be held until next Tuesday. People in the League of Nations predict that if Japan occupies Jinzhou, the most serious consequences will occur. This afternoon, the Council received reports that Japanese troops had occupied Panshan and dispatched armored vehicles to advance towards Jinzhou on the British-invested Beining Railway, which was quite astonishing. Briand, in his capacity as Chairman, immediately summoned Yoshizawa for a meeting, stating that if the Japanese troops could not stop advancing towards Jinzhou, he would ask the Japanese troops to explain the reasons for their military actions. Today, the spokesman for the Chinese delegation stated that we must consider that while Japanese troops are advancing towards Jinzhou, it is difficult for China to accept the Council's resolution. Therefore, this crisis must be removed first before China can accept any action by the Council. The Council has now received reports of disturbances in Tianjin. It is claimed that one of the shells fired by the Japanese troops exploded near the Provincial Public Office, and another exploded near the Municipal Government. According to reports from the Chinese side, the two sides opened fire at 8:30 PM on Thursday. As soon as the Japanese plainclothes team emerged from the Japanese concession, they opened fire with artillery and machine guns to assist in attacking the Chinese police. The Japanese troops fired a total of thirty-seven shells (National Telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting opened this evening with thirteen members present. The Chinese and Japanese representatives were both absent. After a 45-minute discussion, the meeting adjourned. The drafting committee for the Investigation Committee's proposal (representatives of England, France, and Spain) continued the meeting. The drafting committee will reconvene tomorrow morning for final deliberation. It is expected that the Administrative Council will then pass the revised proposal. The Chinese chief representative will meet with the drafting committee tomorrow morning. It is heard that the Chinese representative still wants to stipulate a definite time for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, but all members feel that if there is such a stipulation, the proposal will not be accepted by Japan. The sudden recurrence of the Tianjin incident further indicates the serious nature of the situation. However, Tianjin is not like Jinzhou, which is a central nerve center. It is hoped that the efforts of the five neutral country inspectors in Jinzhou, supplemented by the goodwill of the Japanese government, can prevent the attack on Jinzhou. Otherwise, the efforts of the Administrative Council to seek a final solution here will be in vain. The news that Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara claimed that he would resign if Jinzhou was attacked has made public opinion more optimistic. The Japanese representative today submitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations a report on the attack on the Japanese concession in Tianjin last night, claiming that the Japanese soldiers in Tianjin had no choice but to retaliate. It also claimed that the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin were weak, while the Chinese army was stronger. The Japanese representative also submitted a report stating that Japanese troops had defeated Chinese bandits at the Anshan Qian Shan coal mine and Nantai and have now returned to Shenyang. The Chinese representative also received a report on the Tianjin incident last night, stating that the Tianjin war was initiated by the Japanese, while the Japanese claimed that bullets flew into the Japanese concession, so the Japanese troops opened fire (Reuters Telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Officials claim that according to the latest news from Paris, the League of Nations believes that most of the points in the revised draft proposal proposed by Japan are only issues of wording. In fact, Japan believes that its proposed amendments related to the scope of the investigation team are the main conditions for Japan to accept the proposal. The League of Nations seems to emphasize preserving China's face and disregards Japan's requests. Japan is eager to ensure that the wording of the proposal does not leave any legal loopholes that can be misinterpreted to Japan's disadvantage. The League of Nations seems willing to agree to Japan's reservations and those related to the ceasefire. This is somewhat satisfactory (Reuters Telegram, 28th).</p>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Chief Representative Shih Chao-chi told Briand today that if there can be a satisfactory guarantee that the Japanese government is willing to control its army and is capable of controlling it, then China is prepared to discuss the Council's resolution. Briand is now awaiting verification from neutral countries regarding Yoshizawa's report on Japanese military actions. Briand told Dr. Shih that he would notify him as soon as he received confirmation. The twelve members of the Council will still hold a closed-door meeting at 4:00 PM today (National News Agency Telegram, 28th).</p>
<p>(Paris) After two hours of consultation between the proposal drafting committee and Dr. Shih, a member of the Administrative Council stated that the outcome of the meeting was exciting and optimistic. Dr. Shih told a Reuters reporter that he was very eager to hear whether the news of the Japanese troops withdrawing to the left bank of the Liao River had been confirmed. The opinions he expressed to the drafting committee were mostly about the withdrawal of troops and military actions. This afternoon, members of the Administrative Council, excluding China and Japan, will meet to consider the drafting committee's report on this morning's proceedings (Reuters Telegram, 28th).</p>
<p>(Paris) Briand firmly denied that he had told Dr. Shih that if Japan attacked Jinzhou, he would use Article 16 of the Covenant with the help of the United States to restrain Japan. Dr. Shih spoke to Briand, mentioning the situation in Jinzhou. Briand told him that he had received a very satisfactory guarantee from Japan that it would not attack Jinzhou. The recent news from Shenyang that Japanese troops have withdrawn to the Liao River has clearly confirmed Japan's guarantee. Negotiations on sending personnel to Manchuria for investigation have now reached a very difficult stage. The Administrative Council is now unlikely to hold a public meeting this afternoon. Dr. Shih told the proposal drafting committee for the investigation team that the activities of the Japanese troops in Manchuria continue unabated, so his position is very difficult. Without a guarantee that Japan will fulfill its promise to withdraw troops, the League of Nations' proposals are not up for discussion (Reuters Telegram, 26th).</p>
<p>(Paris) Briand asked Japan not to attack Jinzhou. Japan replied that Japanese troops will not take any hostile actions except for self-defense and security plans. If the Chinese army withdraws from Jinzhou, Japanese troops will never enter the neutral zone unless the lives of Japanese residents are in danger. Finally, it was stated that the Japanese government is now preparing to instruct local Japanese officials to negotiate with Chinese local officials on measures for a neutral zone (Reuters News Agency Telegram, 28th).</p>
<h3>Impressions of British, American, and French Military Attaches Inspecting Jinzhou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The military attaches of England, the United States, and France have been inspecting the military situation in the Jinzhou, Goubangzi, and Dahushan areas for several days. Their impressions are excellent. They have determined that the various excuses recently used by the Japanese side are not true. The British Counselor Sir Tudor-Pole and the British and French Consuls can all attest that our army has no preparations for an offensive (Special Telegram, 28th).</p>
<h3>U.S. Government</h3>
<p>Preventing Japanese Troops from Attacking Jinzhou</p>
<p>Believing that Shidehara Violated His Promise</p>
<p>Intending to Lodge a Protest with Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) Last night, reports of Japanese troops advancing towards Jinzhou were received here. It is expected that the U.S. government will lodge a strong and swift protest, pointing out that the Japanese military action violates Shidehara's promise not to attack Jinzhou. If this protest is lodged, it will be based on the Nine-Power Treaty, as this treaty guarantees the integrity of Chinese territory (Reuters Telegram, 28th).</p>
<p>(Washington) Reports of Japanese aircraft bombing Jinzhou have attracted great attention from the State Department today (Reuters Telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>(Washington) Reuters learned today that the U.S. government has approached the Japanese government regarding the issue of not attacking Jinzhou. A reply has now been received from Tokyo stating that there are no plans to attack Jinzhou. Today, Secretary of State Stimson told reporters that Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara had previously guaranteed this. He did not understand why there were still reports of Japanese troops advancing towards Jinzhou. On November 23, he instructed the ambassador to Japan to state to Shidehara that the U.S. government attaches great importance to the news of Japanese troops planning to attack Jinzhou. At that time, Shidehara replied that he, the Minister of the Army, and the Chief of Staff had agreed not to take any hostile actions against Jinzhou and had telegraphed this instruction to the commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria (Reuters Telegram, 27th).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The news that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson publicly disparaged Japan's policy in Manchuria while meeting with reporters in Washington has aroused resentment among the Japanese people. It is expected that the Japanese government will inquire with Washington to confirm this matter and then publish an article refuting the points Stimson accused. This afternoon, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the consequences would be extremely serious if responsible politicians like Stimson lost their composure in the current critical situation. It is heard that Stimson accused Japan of intending to completely occupy Manchuria. If so, Japan will ask him to explain the basis for making this statement. Stimson's remarks have adverse effects on both China and Japan. The Japanese reactionary party will believe that his words</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Contain threats and humiliation, and will become even more arrogant. China's anti-Japanese attitude will also become firmer because of these words. The exchange of official documents between the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara was of a confidential nature. Now that Stimson has publicly announced it, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regards this as shocking and regrettable. It is especially infuriating that Stimson hastily accused Japan of breaking its promise without waiting for the facts to prove it. Stimson's remarks are unfortunate not only in form but also in substance. Stimson also said that Japan apologizes after each attack and promises not to do it again. In fact, Japan has not made any such apologies, etc. Stimson's accusation that the Japanese army is crazy is a direct insult to the Japanese Emperor, because the Japanese Emperor is the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concluded by stating that Stimson's actions violate Article 1, Section 4 of the Nine-Power Treaty, because according to this treaty, the signatory countries must not take actions that are detrimental to friendly countries. Japan believes that Zhang Xueliang's actions are detrimental to Japan, but Stimson seems to acknowledge these actions and is advocating for Zhang Xueliang to strengthen his attitude regarding the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou (Reuters Telegram, 28th).</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Telegram to Briand</h3>
<p>Requesting the Prevention of Japanese Troops from Attacking Jinzhou</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to the critical situation in Jinzhou, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Briand on the 28th, seeking ways to prevent it. The original telegram is as follows: The Chinese government has received your telegram, requesting the Chinese and Japanese governments to pay special attention to the current situation in the Jinzhou area and advising both parties not to take any actions that would lead to further conflicts and bloodshed. The Chinese government has always faithfully fulfilled the recommendations of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, it has done its best to avoid the expansion of the situation. However, the continuous military aggression by Japan cannot be stopped except by the most effective methods of the League of Nations. After the Japanese army occupied Qiqihar, they concentrated on the Beining Railway line and used force to seize Xinmin, the first major station north of Jinzhou. Now, they are implementing a siege of Jinzhou. An attack on Jinzhou is imminent. Therefore, China requests you and your colleagues in the Executive Council to take immediate steps to stop Japanese aggression to avoid further bloodshed (Special Telegram, 28th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Government</h3>
<p>Opinions on Neutral Zones</p>
<p>Require Direct Negotiations between China and Japan</p>
<p>No Third Country is Allowed to Participate</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou, the Japanese government, after yesterday's cabinet meeting, conditionally agreed, namely: (1) The details of the regulations for the establishment of a neutral zone shall be directly negotiated between China and Japan and shall be based on the actual situation in the area. (2) China and Japan shall each bear full responsibility for the establishment of the neutral zone, and no third country shall be allowed to participate. The above two articles were presented by Foreign Minister Shidehara to the Emperor for approval. At the same time, a response was given to French Ambassador Mald, the gist of which was that after the Chinese army withdraws within Shanhaiguan, the Japanese army will not invade the withdrawal area as long as it can maintain the administrative and police power of the area. However, if the lives and property of Japanese people and the safety of the Japanese army are harmed in North China, there will be exceptions (Dentsu Telegram, 28th).</p>

After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army dispatched a soldier to the bridge on that river every day to take turns guarding it. All Chinese people passing by the bridge must bow deeply to the Japanese soldier guarding the bridge, otherwise the Japanese soldier will force them to kneel on the bridge. At first, the Chinese people did not know about this trick to humiliate the Chinese people, resulting in hundreds of people being punished every day (Special Telegram, 28th).</p>

<p>Unification and peace; the crux of national salvation lies in abiding by the law and struggling. Without unification, one cannot resist foreign aggression; without abiding by the law, one cannot save the country. Support the central government to achieve unification and fulfill one's duties without violating the law. The way to resist foreign aggression and save the country lies entirely in this. The responsibility of students lies in studying; the duty of soldiers lies in serving in the military. I hope that my students will struggle together to build the way to save the country. Very fortunate. Chiang Kai-shek, November 27" (Another letter answering students is printed on the right) (Special Telegram, 28th).</p>

<h3>Petitioning Students Leave Nanjing</h3>

<h3>Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai</h3>
<p>Request Cancellation of Honorary Titles</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief and Army Commander</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Guangnai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, and Cai Tingkai, Commander of the 19th Army, telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Military Affairs, stating: "The great disaster of the country lies in too many soldiers. The income of the entire country is not enough to support the soldiers. The soldiers of the entire country cannot defend against the disaster. This is a matter of great sorrow. The titles of Commander-in-Chief and Army Commander are all wartime organizations. Once a war ends, the titles should be cancelled immediately to prevent the private ownership of the army from developing into a military clique and to eliminate the ills of stacking beds, building houses on top of each other, and growing extra fingers and toes. Now that the country has declared unification and civil war cannot be seen again, the honorary titles of Commander-in-Chief and Army Commander have no reason to exist. Guangnai and others are willing to take the lead and request the National Government to immediately cancel the various titles and have the various divisions under their command directly subordinate to the government's responsible agencies. Once there is a national defense emergency, the government can allocate troops at any time to facilitate command. Then, Guangnai and others would not dare to claim credit. Moreover, temporary command and deployment, its institutions can be quickly assembled, and the allocation of military strength must be adapted to the circumstances. There is no need for the disadvantages of not returning after a heavy battle. This humble sincerity, we believe, can be proven by heaven and earth. We should receive the approval of the government and the support of our comrades. In addition to requesting immediate approval and implementation, we respectfully submit this telegram" (Special Telegram, 28th).</p>

<p>Unification and peace; the crux of national salvation lies in abiding by the law and struggling. Without unification, one cannot resist foreign aggression; without abiding by the law, one cannot save the country. Support the central government to achieve unification and fulfill one's duties without violating the law. The way to resist foreign aggression and save the country lies entirely in this. The responsibility of students lies in studying; the duty of soldiers lies in serving in the military. I hope that my students will struggle together to build the way to save the country.

<h3>International Disarmament Discussion</h3>
<p>Opponents Disrupt the Meeting</p>
<p>Sirens Blare, Laughter and Curses Intermingle</p>
<p>Diplomats Slip Out the Back Door to Avoid Fists</p>
<p>Chaos Unseen in Paris Since the European War</p>
<p>Resolution Passed the Day Before</p>
<p>Urging the League of Nations to Sanction Japan</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 28th - Last night, when the International Disarmament Discussion Conference held a general meeting, opponents of disarmament disrupted the meeting, causing chaos unseen in Paris since the European War. This anti-disarmament movement was funded by French perfume magnate Coty. The French authorities, anticipating disturbances, had deployed dozens of police officers to guard the inside and outside of the meeting venue. After the meeting began, Chairman Herriot uttered a few words, followed by wild shouts, then the chaotic sounds of sirens and the competitive blowing of horns. Finally, the supporters and opponents in the audience freely threw punches. Order was only restored when 200 armed gendarmes arrived and swung their batons. Herriot barely managed to finish his speech, and when German representative Jouhaux rose to speak, the uproar erupted again. First, laughter and curses were mixed with the sounds of sirens, and then marches were sung loudly to block him. Subsequently, the British and American representatives also encountered the same treatment in their speeches. Afterwards, when the chairman of the Veterans Association gave his speech, someone even tried to drag him off the stage. It was already midnight, so the meeting was adjourned. The gendarmes used their rifle butts to drive the crowd out, while dignitaries and diplomats quietly left through the back door before the meeting was adjourned to prevent people from ambushing them in the street in front. This morning, there were many comments on the matter, and it is expected to have a major impact.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 27th - The International Disarmament Discussion Conference is being held here, with representatives from all over the world, totaling more than 600 people. The conference is of an informal nature. During the third meeting held today, a fight broke out over the debate over whether security or disarmament was more important. Chairs and tables were overturned, and ink bottles were scattered all over the floor. Several representatives who advocated disarmament punched those who opposed their views. Later, the police entered the venue, but it was difficult to restore order. Eventually, the proponents of disarmament saw an opportunity and retreated, ending the chaos. However, those with black eyes and bloody noses were numerous.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 27th - Today, the International Armaments Discussion Conference passed a resolution asking the Council of the League of Nations to promptly implement the sanctions stipulated in the Charter, especially applying Article 16 of the Charter to the Manchurian Incident. The conference was chaired by French Senator Vice-President Flandin.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 28th - The International Disarmament Discussion Conference, which recently convened in Paris, passed the following resolution: This committee, in view of the current consultations, has a spirit of prudence and appropriateness, hereby expresses its respect. Even if the actions of the Executive Yuan are delayed due to this spirit, it is not acceptable. This committee expresses its unwavering faith in the League of Nations and is deeply grateful to President Briand for using his incomparable authority to continue his respectable work. The Japanese military occupation and combat operations in Manchuria have been going on for two months, but the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations have not yet been implemented, which is extremely regrettable. It is known that all international disputes can only be resolved through peaceful legal procedures, and no one should act on their own. Among the member states of the League of Nations, there are those who violate this principle, which is no different from opposing the entire society. Articles 10, 11, 12, 15, and 16 of the Covenant are all effective. Even if the League of Nations is unwilling to adopt the various sanctions measures contained in Article 16, the other provisions of the Covenant should be implemented. If the League of Nations abandons it because of its difficulties, it will inevitably be a self-inflicted abandonment. This committee believes that the outcome of the Sino-Japanese dispute must adopt two interrelated principles: one is that if order is to replace chaos in international relations or within a country, all member states should reduce their armaments; the second is that in order to achieve the above objectives, the League of Nations must have the military power to carry out its tasks under its command to maintain peace and consolidate the rule of law. This committee's belief is here, and it is willing to share it with people all over the world.</p>
<h3>Tax Increase Becomes a Problem</h3>
<p>Conflict of Opinion Between Government and Party</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 28th - To make up for the insufficient revenue in the drafting of next year's budget, the government has decided to increase taxes, but Interior Minister Adachi strongly opposes it in this critical situation. The party side believes that a tax increase is unavoidable, especially for the increase in tax rates on luxury goods, cosmetics, and consumer goods, as long as the burden on the public is not increased. On the other hand, former Minister of Commerce Hyoei Takarabe, as the chairman of the Tariff Commission, advocates increasing tariffs. However, Finance Minister Inoue Junnosuke first sought the party's approval for the tax increase plan decided by the cabinet as a government plan due to opposition within the party, which led to a conflict of opinion between the two sides. Therefore, it is feared that unconditional agreement cannot be obtained.</p>
<h3>French Finance Minister Goes to England to Negotiate Tax Increase Issue 1</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 28th - French Finance Minister Flandin suddenly left for London this morning to negotiate with the British government on changing the tax increase, because the tariffs increased by the British anti-dumping law now reach 83%, which is actually tantamount to preventing the export of French goods to England.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th - The German government has instructed its ambassador to the UK to propose to the British government that friendly negotiations be opened on the situation created by the increase in tariffs, because the protectionist measures adopted by the UK have severely hit German exports to the UK. According to statistics, German exports to the UK account for 12% of total exports.</p>
<h3>British-Burma Round Table Conference Opens</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 27th - The Burma Round Table Conference opened in the House of Lords this morning. The Prince of Wales chaired the meeting. During the opening ceremony, the Prince of Wales delivered a welcome speech to the representatives, saying that the British Emperor cares very much about the Burmese people. He personally visited Burma last time and was warmly welcomed by the local people, which he cannot forget to this day. He then described the reasons for convening the Round Table Conference and the British Emperor's hope for the success of the conference. The Prime Minister also delivered a welcome speech. After the speech, Sir Peel, Chairman of the Conference, spoke, saying that there are several constitutional issues that will be discussed, which are very important. After the speech, several Burmese representatives stood up and spoke, saying that they hope that the outcome of the discussion will grant Burma the independence enjoyed by British self-governing colonies, so that it can usher in a new era of peace and prosperity.</p>
<h3>Germany's Claim for Debt Repayment</h3>
<p>First Reparations, Then Private Debt</p>
<p>Provokes British Reaction</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 27th - After French Prime Minister Laval returned to France from the United States, he recently advocated in a parliamentary foreign policy debate that Germany should first repay reparations and then private debts. This view has clearly provoked a reaction in the United Kingdom. Today, The Times of London has a very long article stating that if the French Prime Minister insists on the saying of first reparations and then private debt, then Germany's credit will go bankrupt, and future disasters will spread throughout Europe, and France will be difficult to avoid. The Times of London said that Germany's current poverty has reached its peak, and the payment of foreign debt has been difficult to cope with. The one-year suspension of debt payments in the Hoover Plan has apparently been difficult to allow Germany to have a chance to breathe, so there is no hope that Germany can continue to pay reparations at this time.</p>
<h3>One-Year Suspension of Arms Production Proposal</h3>
<p>Fifty Countries Have Notified Acceptance</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 28th - Of the sixty-three countries invited to participate in the disarmament conference in February next year, fifty countries have now notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations that they are willing to accept the proposal to suspend arms production for one year.</p>

<p>Paris Telegram: Shén Bào forwards to the government: Shocked to learn that the government ordered Shi [Zhaoji] to propose to the League of Nations that the Chinese army be willing to automatically enter the customs and designate Jinzhou as a neutral zone, entrusting foreign troops to defend it. This is tantamount to handing over the three northeastern provinces to Japan with both hands, and opening up an evil precedent for joint management by the great powers, losing national sovereignty. This is absolutely unacceptable. We urge Shi to withdraw the previous case and propose a sanctions case. Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>

Please adhere to our original proposal regarding the three points of troop withdrawal. If the League of Nations does not accept it, please propose Article 16 of the Covenant to sanction Japan. If it is ineffective, withdraw from the League of Nations and wage war against Japan. If the government ignores public opinion and accepts the draft that will lead to national subjugation, the people will swear to oppose it.

<p>Hailun Telegram: To all newspaper offices, and forward to overseas Chinese Kuomintang branches, overseas Chinese compatriots, Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, provincial and municipal party headquarters, military division and brigade generals, and legal entities: Since the Liaoning-Jilin Incident, the Japanese army has used the repair of our Nenjiang River bridge as a pretext to attack our province day and night, and we have been compelled to defend ourselves, resulting in repeated conflicts. The Japanese army then used heavy troops and sharp weapons to vigorously suppress us. In order to comply with the League of Nations' peaceful resolution, we have withdrawn our troops this morning at the request of the local government and temporarily moved the provincial government to Hailun to continue working as usual. We have received telegrams of condolences and donations from compatriots, military and political comrades at home and abroad. The three armies are inspired and deeply grateful. In addition to replying at any time, we are deeply afraid that we will not be able to fully express our gratitude due to the hasty military situation. Please publish it on our behalf. We and all armed comrades express our sincere gratitude. Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, respectfully apologizes.</p>

<h3>US, British, and French Military Attachés</h3>
<p>Impressions of Inspecting Jinzhou</p>
<p>Chinese Army Has Absolutely No Intention of Provoking Japan</p>
<p>And Has No Possibility of Attacking</p>
<p>"Greater America Evening News," Jinzhou, 27th - After arriving in Jinzhou on the 24th, the U.S., British, and French military attachés visited Mi Chunlin and Rong Zhen, and after actually inspecting the military situation near Jinzhou, they unanimously believed that the troops of the Liaoning Provincial Government in Jinzhou had absolutely no intention of provoking or attacking Japanese troops in Shenyang or other places, nor did they have the possibility of attacking. This morning, the three military attachés departed on a special train prepared by the Chinese authorities to inspect the situation between Jinzhou and Dagushan, and may turn to Datong branch road for a trip. Its purpose is to inspect whether the cavalry division stationed along the railway is enough to threaten the Japanese army, as pointed out by Honjo Shigeru. According to the military attachés, Rong Zhen's troops here do not exceed 20,000 people, most of them stationed in Goubangzi. In addition, a large team is stationed along the Daling River a few miles east of Jinzhou as the main defense line. There are very few troops stationed in Jinzhou City, and the student corps formed by young people is used to maintain law and order. The Chinese army along the railway is mostly mixed troops, which are formed by the Chinese army expelled from various places after the Japanese occupation. At this time of severe cold, the soldiers have no barracks to live in, they just dig cellars or weave wheat straw and sorghum stalks to shelter from the cold wind. The reporter of "Greater America Evening News" once inspected a cellar, where more than a dozen soldiers were shivering from the cold, and they were only feeding on sorghum paste, without meat. However, although their situation is so difficult, their morale is extremely high, and they all vowed to defend to the death to resist the Japanese. Mi Chunlin and Rong Zhen also said that they will try their best to defend this city, and if the Japanese army invades, they will swear to fight to the end. However, both of them also know that the terrain is extremely unfavorable. The Japanese army seems to be planning to send another team to land near Qinhuangdao to cut off the Chinese army's retreat, while at the same time advancing along the main line of the Beining Road and the Yingkou branch line with a large army to attack Goubangzi. It is also heard that the Japanese army has sent another team to the west of Liaoyang Station by land to encircle the Chinese army. The reporter asked Rong Zhen, if he is forced to withdraw his troops, what will he do? Rong said that he will follow the example of General Ma Zhanshan and retreat to Rehe to continue resisting the Japanese invaders. The city of Jinzhou is scattered and dilapidated, and its city is only a mud wall, relying on low ridges outside, about 20 miles from the sea. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was called an important town and was a barrier to Shanhaiguan. Recently, it has been a center for sheepskin exports, mostly shipped to the United States and Germany. Since Japanese planes came to Jinzhou to drop bombs, the officials have now moved to the folk houses in the suburbs to work. When the reporter visited Rong Zhi, he saw that the walls of his office were only wallpapered with foreign newspapers from two years ago, and he could still read the record of Byrd's exploration of Antarctica.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forcefully Rob the Yingkou Official Bank</h3>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Yesterday, a returning guest from Yingkou talked about it, saying that the Yingkou Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces was searched by the Japanese army on the day of the Shenyang Incident, and all the funds were handed over to the Yokohama Specie Bank. Later, due to the local financial relationship, it was forced to resume business, but the cash that had been robbed was never returned. Since the resumption of business, the bank has been under the surveillance of the Japanese army every day. The newly received inventory of funds is checked every other day, and incoming and outgoing letters are arbitrarily checked and detained. Public and private actions have lost their freedom. The sovereignty has been lost, and people are like prisoners. The suffering in it is beyond description. It is said that during the incident, the Japanese army took out more than 400,000 yuan in cash, and after the resumption of business, merchants deposited money one after another. The Japanese who supervised the bank could not cope with it, so they negotiated with the Japanese military and political administration to hand over 200,000 yuan as the Yingkou Official Bank's loan to the Japanese side and asked for a receipt to be established, which was guaranteed by the Chamber of Commerce. The rest of the money has not yet been returned. In addition, the bank has more than 80,000 yuan in banknotes deposited in the Bank of Korea, but the bank actually detained them and refused to allow withdrawals. Later, after the bank stated that this money was for the exchange of goods to Shanghai, Dalian, Osaka, etc., it repeatedly wrote to the Yingkou Post-Disaster Committee to facilitate the matter. After repeated discussions, the bank agreed to pay. In addition, the gold tickets deposited in the Bank of Korea by the bank are even more numerous. The Japanese believe that this is the currency of the country, and the confiscation of one yuan reduces one yuan of debt, and they also refuse to pay. Their robbery behavior is worse than bandits. In addition, the Japanese army forcibly confiscated a dozen or so large and small guns and more than a thousand bullets from the bank. In addition to this, the most important thing is the issue of forcefully robbing salt tax. On the 28th of last month, Yamada Shigeji, a Japanese consultant of the puppet Liaoning Finance Department, colluded with the Japanese military police and coerced Zou, a member of the Yingkou Dongsan Province Official Bank in Liaoning, and Wang Baoxun, to the Yingkou Dongsan Province Official Bank, threatening the manager of the Yingkou Official Bank, Lu Bojiang, with guns and bayonets to force him to stamp the seal to withdraw the salt funds. Because the manager refused to stamp the seal, the Japanese soldiers directly went to the manager's desk, looked for the seal, and stamped it themselves, and beat and scolded Lu. More than one million yuan of salt funds were taken away on the same day. Although our authorities have protested this matter, the Japanese side has blamed it on the local maintenance association. In fact, although Yuan Jinkai and others are running dogs of the Japanese side and obey orders, this matter is purely a direct action of the Japanese side. (26th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese and Japanese Conspiracies Increasingly Apparent</h3>
<p>Actively Disrupting the Anti-Japanese Boycott Movement</p>
<p>Aiding Their Country by Increasing Troops in China</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Japanese are actively seeking ways to undermine the economic boycott by Chinese citizens, which is seen as a fatal blow. Overseas Chinese and Japanese have devised two simultaneous strategies. The overt strategy is divided into six parts: (1) Colluding with treacherous merchants to advocate for Sino-Japanese business circles jointly maintaining world peace, urging both governments to negotiate directly on the Manchurian Incident and rejecting third-party intervention. (2) Connecting with Chinese chambers of commerce to form a Sino-Japanese Commercial Federation to effectively maintain commerce in South China and the Yangtze River basin. (3) Liaising with the Chinese press to promote the formation of an International Press Journalists Federation, to foster closeness and goodwill between the peoples of both countries. (4) Influencing anti-Japanese boycott associations, chambers of commerce, and the press to express sympathy, to achieve their goals. (5) Utilizing Sino-Japanese civic groups to advise both governments, urging the Japanese government to withdraw troops and the Chinese government to cease the anti-Japanese movement. (6) Employing Sino-Japanese civic groups to prevent both countries’ governments from resorting to military action, promoting direct negotiations. The covert strategy is also divided into six parts: (1) Hiring hoodlums and ruffians to assault personnel of anti-Japanese associations and prevent the inspection of Japanese goods. (2) Influencing ignorant lower-ranking military officers and soldiers to escort Japanese goods. (3) Using incentives to encourage treacherous merchants to sell Japanese goods and wholesale Japanese goods at significantly reduced prices. (4) Using force to reclaim detained Japanese goods, obstruct anti-Japanese propaganda, and tear down slogans. (5) Hiring hoodlums, ruffians, dockworkers, etc., to disrupt market security and hinder the sale of Chinese goods. (6) Using treacherous merchants to oppose the inspection of Japanese goods and spread rumors to slander anti-Japanese workers. Furthermore, according to Japanese public pronouncements, the Japanese government has decided to permanently occupy the three northeastern provinces with naval, land, and air forces, and preparations are complete. Residents in Hankou should solemnly express their views; therefore, a meeting was convened, deciding on the following three proposals: (1) Raising funds to provide the Japanese government with military expenses for increasing troops in China. (2) Disrupting the anti-Japanese movement. (3) Supporting the independence of the three northeastern provinces. These three proposals were entrusted to the head of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Hankou to bring to Shanghai, in preparation for submission at the general meeting of Japanese expatriates in Shanghai.

<h3>Situation of the Guangdong 4th National Congress in Recent Days</h3>
<p>Preparatory Meeting and First and Second Formal Meetings</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since its opening, the Guangdong 4th National Congress held a preparatory meeting at 2 PM on the 19th, resolving to appoint Sun Ke, Deng Zhiru, Xu Focheng, Li Zongren, and Jing Hengyi, recommended by the Extraordinary Conference, and Li Yangjing, Huang Xuchu, Guan Suren, and Yao Tichang, recommended by the attending delegates, totaling nine people, as the presidium of the congress, Li Wenfan as the secretary-general of the congress, and Xiang Lunping as the director of the security office of the congress. The first meeting was held at 9 AM on the 20th, chaired by Li Zongren. After the ceremony, Li Wenfan read out the resolutions of the first preparatory meeting, and then the discussion of proposals began, resolving: (1) to hold a formal meeting today; (2) to telegraph Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin to return to Guangdong immediately to preside; (3) to commend Ma Zhanshan for his dutiful service; (4) to deny the Nanjing government's continued issuance of public bonds before the establishment of a unified government; (5) to urge the Nanjing government to instruct Zhang Xueliang to restore the territory of the three northeastern provinces by a specific date; (6) to decide on the personnel of each group of the proposal review committee; (7) to donate 50,000 yuan to reward Ma Zhanshan and his troops (from the one-day attendance fee of the congress delegates and central committee members, with those holding concurrent positions donating two days, and the remaining amount to be the responsibility of the delegates and central committee members to raise). The second congress was held at 2 PM on the 23rd, with 477 delegates present, and Jing Hengyi, Li Zongren, Deng Zhiru, Li Yangjing, Yao Tichang, and Guan Suren in the presidium. After the ceremony, the discussion of the "Proposal on Adopting or Amending the Resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference to Promote Genuine and Lasting Peace" proposed by the Extraordinary Conference began. The original proposal stated: "In order to seek genuine and lasting peace, the Extraordinary Conference appointed Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, etc., as representatives to hold peace talks with representatives from Nanjing in Shanghai. According to the report, the political system reform plan agreed upon at the conference can discern the crux of the matter and meet the requirements of the current political trend, and can be generally accommodated. However, regarding the agreement between both parties to convene the Fourth National Congress, stipulating that the members of the 2nd and 3rd Central Executive and Supervisory Committees shall be de facto natural members of the 4th Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, it is difficult to call it perfect. If it is not amended, it will not only greatly violate the party constitution, but also run counter to the election principles and the responsibilities of party members. According to the party constitution, the National Congress has the power to elect members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees and alternate Executive and Supervisory Committee members. Now, a large part of the members of the 4th Central Executive and Supervisory Committees must be elected from the members of the 2nd and 3rd Central Committees, which deprives the Fourth National Congress of its freedom of election, and the powers conferred on the National Congress by the party constitution are invisibly greatly restricted. When the members of the National Congress join the party, it is the highest organ of the party, and the powers conferred by the party constitution can be illegally restricted. Once this precedent is set, how can we rectify the discipline of the party, and how can we maintain the party's long-standing credibility? As far as elections are concerned, since the members of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Central Executive and Supervisory Committees can be natural members of the 4th Committee, the members of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Committees in the future can also be natural members of the 5th Committee, and the members of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Committees in the future can also be natural members of the 6th Committee. From this deduction, all members of each committee who have been elected once, regardless of whether they are loyal, whether their work is diligent, or whether they have the faith of the majority of party members, can be natural members of the Central Party Headquarters for life. The election system is reduced to a formality, and the purpose of the election cannot be achieved, and the number of members of the Central Party Headquarters in the future will inevitably increase indefinitely. How can we properly manage the aftermath? (Omission) Based on the above reasons, the colleagues dare not agree with the peace plan proposed by the conference, regarding the agreement that the members of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Central Executive and Supervisory Committees shall be natural members of the 4th Central Committee, and should be amended (omission)." This proposal was discussed for two hours, and as a result, the chairman summarized the opinions of the delegates into the following three points: (1) The various cases of the central political system reform decided by the Shanghai Peace Conference are generally accepted, but they still need to be submitted to the various committees for detailed review. (2) The Shanghai Peace Conference decided that the members of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Central Executive and Supervisory Committees shall be natural members of the 4th Central Executive and Supervisory Committee, which violates Article 30 of the Party's Constitution and should be fundamentally rejected. The election of members of the 4th Central Executive and Supervisory Committee shall be based on the highest organizational principles of the party and freely elected by the congress in a democratic manner. (3) (Omission) The above three points were put to a vote by the chairman one by one, and the majority temporarily passed them. In addition, there were two temporary motions: (1) A delegate proposed to immediately issue a declaration and telegraph the whole country based on the "Proposal on Adopting or Amending the Resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference to Promote Genuine and Lasting Peace," to show our sincerity in accepting the resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference. (2) Pan Yi and others proposed (omission), which were all resolved and passed. (November 23rd evening)</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Summary of County Administrative Meeting: At the second meeting of the fourth county administrative meeting of this county on the 27th, the following cases were discussed: (1) Member Li Xiuze proposed that the farmland along the Beiwei, Song, and Si roads in this county, which has been built upon, should be priced as soon as possible and exempted from national taxes to maintain credibility and facilitate rent reduction. It was resolved that the county government should order the Finance and Construction Bureaus to complete the task within this year. (2) The third district chief proposed that it is not as effective to collect food for the county and district granaries from tenant farmers, so would it be feasible to collect it through stamped receipts? It was resolved that the method of rice distribution should remain the same as the original plan. If there are difficulties in each district, each district should find its own way to remedy them.</p>
<p>Injured Male Corpse Found in River: A male corpse, about fifty years old, was found floating in the Tao Xing Bridge River outside the West Gate today (28th). After the police reported to the County Court, Prosecutor Zhu Zixi personally arrived to inspect it.

It was ordered to put the body in a coffin and wait for relatives to claim it.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Joint Conference of Fengxian and Nanhui Counties to Discuss Boundary Demarcation: Considering that the need for boundary demarcation between Fengxian and Nanhui counties is more pressing for Nanhui than Songjiang, the various circles in this county specially convened a joint conference of Fengxian and Nanhui counties at Shen's Lian Garden in Nanqiao yesterday to exchange opinions. More than 20 people from Nanhui attended. In addition to the welcome speech by Shen Menglian, the representative of this county, He Shiyi and other representatives from the two townships reported that after the issue of boundary demarcation arose, the two parties discussed it and agreed that although consolidating county boundaries is a holistic administrative scope, counties, as units of autonomy, should not be separated from public opinion and should be resolved solely through administration. Therefore, the two parties' representatives drafted reasons on the spot and submitted them to the provincial and county governments to show their firm determination. At the same time, it was resolved to change the location of the merger from the confusing boundary of Zhangang to start from the Quanhuai Bridge Port, along the Huangpu River to the Ye Xie Tangkou of Songjiang Qianbu Jingxi, to make it clear and complete. As for the consolidation method, an independent district will be established according to its original area, and specific plans will be formulated separately for all facilities for reference. In the shortest possible time, this county will complete the Nanmin Road and long-distance telephone to promote development.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>The Entire County is Divided into Three Garrison Districts: The winter defense meeting of this county resolved that because this county borders the lake and neighbors Zhejiang, and there are many bandits, the entire county is now divided into three garrison districts. The Xinlu Kucai Zhou area is one district, which is guarded by the provincial public security teams 14 and 15 and the guerrillas. The four pavilions of the Yan Sheng area and the Shigubiao Bridge area are one district, which is guarded by the provincial security team and the provincial team 15. The Nanheng Fanwu Du and Wulou area is the business district, which is guarded by the provincial security team, the provincial team 14, the guerrillas, and the county water police team. Regular rendezvous and joint encirclement and suppression will be carried out at any time.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Qianye Strike Subsides: It is said that when Yang An, the prosecutor of the County Court of this county, went to the Defeng Qianzhuang in Beiting to search for Fan Chunchen the day before yesterday, he did not explain the reason for the case, but went straight into the money house to search. The zhuang mistakenly thought it was a robbery and blew the whistle wildly. In the chaos, Prosecutor Yang and others were suddenly beaten and humiliated. The Qianye also stopped business uniformly. It is now known that after this incident occurred, Lin, the president of the Suzhou High Court, and Wang Sismo, the chief prosecutor, immediately sent Inspector Sun Xiyan and Secretary Xu to Wuxi to investigate based on the telegram from the Chamber of Commerce and the Qianye in this county. After arriving in Wuxi, he first went to the Defeng Qianzhuang to investigate, and then went to the County Chamber of Commerce to meet Qian Sunqing, Chen Zhanru, and Jiang Huanqing. At the same time, County Mayor Chen and Dean Yang also rushed to the scene after hearing the news to exchange opinions and strongly urged the Qianye to resume business immediately. County Mayor Chen promised to be responsible for ensuring the safety of the business market and not to let the incident escalate. After deliberation, everyone agreed that they were satisfied. Yesterday (28th), the Qianye resumed business uniformly.</p>
<p>The Main Culprit in the Stone Pond Bay Assault on Police Case is Arrested: The County Public Security Bureau's Supervisory Office sent police to Stone Pond Bay to investigate gambling, and a case of resisting arrest and assaulting the police occurred. Fortunately, the road guard military police arrived at the scene to suppress it, and there was no major disaster. The gamblers Shen Fulin and others were arrested and sent to the case. The main culprit in the case of resisting arrest, namely Sun Hongting, the head of the beach bureau, followed the gamblers to the city to inquire about the news after the gamblers were sent to the case. Yesterday, he was arrested by the detective police near the Qitai Inn on the road and sent to the Public Security Bureau, and then transferred to the County Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Seizes a Large Batch of Japanese Beads: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Wuyi County received a tip-off yesterday (27th) that a large batch of Japanese beads was hidden upstairs in the Xiangzhai Flower Shop at the Fuzi Archway on the main street, and more than 20 boxes of Japanese beads were hidden in a certain surname's house in Yingchun Bridge. The association immediately sent an inspection team to search the upstairs of the shop and found 10 boxes of Japanese beads. However, the shop owner had already escaped in the meantime. The Japanese beads were escorted to the Anti-Japanese Association. Then they went to search a certain surname's house in Yingchun Bridge, but the goods had already been shipped out.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Oppose Increasing Business Tax Amount: The business tax of this county is recognized by the committee organized by the county chamber of commerce, and Chamber of Commerce member Zhang Shouyi goes to the province to recognize it, which is 50,000 yuan per year and is paid in four seasons. Then the Business Tax Collection Bureau was established and began to investigate the business amount of various industries, but the tax collected was less than 40,000 yuan, which was a huge deficit. Then, they sincerely requested the province to reduce the amount, and it was only reduced by 5,000 foreign yuan, but the shortfall was still huge, and the number should be increased to various industries. After a meeting, it was resolved to increase the collection of various industries by 40% to 50%. Now, the Rice Merchants Association is against the committee member for not announcing the exact amount and types of business, and for increasing the tax amount without authorization. They have also sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, raising reasons and asking for the announcement of various items. Therefore, the committee Zhang Shouyi is very discouraged and heard that he will not continue after his term expires.</p>
<p>Japanese People Sneak into Changshu: On the evening of the 25th of this month, the Shanghai-Changshu night ship of the Laogongmao Shipping Bureau arrived at the port. There were many Japanese people on board. When the passengers disembarked, the Japanese people still stayed on the ship. It was not until dark that they got ashore and dined at the Zhuangyuan Building Restaurant on South Xin Road. When the people saw their actions, they did not look like Chinese products, so they spread the news one after another and rushed to the restaurant to watch. There were two Chinese women sitting in the middle, who seemed to be maids. After a secret investigation, it was found that the women were indeed Japanese. One was Murata, who had lived in Shanghai for many years. One was a Westerner (some said Cantonese) named Yan Folly, an employee of the China-Belgium Bank, and the woman was Yan's concubine and a local. They came to visit Yushan. At that time, there were more and more people gathered at the restaurant. Murata knew that he could not stay for long, so he left and stayed on the Shanghai Ban Xingshou Company ship parked at Zhucaobang. The next morning, the Japanese people were afraid of accidents, so they left Changshu immediately.</p>
<p>The Former Director of the Construction Bureau Expresses Himself After Being Detained: Chen Qiwei, the former Director of the Construction Bureau, was taken into custody by the County Government because the handover procedures were not clear. Now, he has asked the province and department to send staff to Changshu to supervise the handover. However, Chen told people that he had been wronged this time and that his accounts were all based on evidence and there was no misappropriation. After the provincial committee investigates in the future, the truth will definitely come out.</p>

<p>Request to Allocate Dredging Funds for the Baimao River: The Baimao River in Changshu is the main channel for draining water from the lower reaches of Taihu Lake.

He specifically telegraphed Chief Commander Liang to send a team to assist in the suppression. According to Chief Commander Liang's telegram reply, according to the report of the cadres, the place is peaceful.

<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Eight Bandits Captured in Yaozhou Township: A bandit alarm occurred in the southern part of Shuangdian District in this county on the 21st night. After receiving the report, the county government immediately dispatched the 10th police team of the county to suppress the bandits. The police captured a bandit suspect named Chen Changgeng, who confessed that there were a group of 10 to 20 people robbing and that the guns were provided by Cao Renhe, a member of the Yaozhou Township Self-Defense Force in Baibu District. After the team leader confessed, he immediately led the team to disarm the entire Yaozhou Township Self-Defense Force. However, Cao Renhe, who provided the bandit weapons, was not in the group headquarters. He telegraphed the Baibu Self-Defense Force to arrest Cao Renhe, the squad leader of the Baibu Self-Defense Force. The district commander and the team leader interrogated him together and confessed to communicating with the bandits. The Gu team leader will hand over the rifles of the Yaozhou Township Self-Defense Force to the district team for distribution, and will take the bandit squad leader Cao Renhe and the bandit Chen Changgeng and other seven bandits and a female bandit back to the brigade headquarters yesterday for handling.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Four Members of the Xiajiadou Family Kidnapped: At about 7:00 pm on the 23rd, three bandit ships suddenly came to Xiajiadou, a place about seven miles outside the West Gate of Lianshi in Huzhou. Forty to fifty bandits, armed with fast guns and wooden shell guns, rushed ashore and robbed Wan Yingbao's house in the village, taking all the clothes, jewelry, and cash, and kidnapping Wan Yinghe and his daughter-in-law, grandson, and adopted daughter. Afterwards, the water police stationed in Lianshui and the public security branch sent police officers to pursue the bandits, but there was no trace of them in the evening.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Money Supply in Xiaoshan is Extremely Tight and the Market is Depressed: The money industry in Xiaoyi has been listening to the Hangzhou market. Recently, due to the loss of the Northeast, the financial industry in Hangzhou has been in a state of turmoil. The general lenders have tightened up, so those who need money are very exhausted. The money supply is secretly tight and the market situation is affected. In Xiaodi for the past two days, the current water has risen to 3 yuan and 5 jiao, and there is also a dark market every day. The interest rate for this month will exceed 2.5% above the mountain. Now, various businesses are in a depressed state.</p>
<p>Severe Collection of Self-Government Household Donations: Since the Xiaoshan County Government announced the start of collecting self-government household donations, all township offices have been rushing to start. Local people who resist donations will be arrested and detained. Such harsh levies and disturbances have made the villages restless. The district township offices have become collection agencies. Seeing this situation, the situation is more tense than urging the payment of field taxes.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Tan Yigui, Magistrate of Changshu County</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read the news about the dismissal and custody of the district chief of the 10th district in the local correspondence column of Changshu in your newspaper on November 26th, which stated that Magistrate Tan was unable to prevent the disaster beforehand and was harboring after the incident. This is inconsistent with the facts. In this case, Yigui has submitted a request to the provincial department to send someone to investigate and punish. There is no question of harboring, and there is no word of harboring in the provincial order. I think it is a factual error in the reporter's record. I hereby send a letter to request correction to avoid misunderstandings. Tan Yigui, Magistrate of Changshu County, November 27th.</p>

<p>Important News on Education</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explanation</h3>
<p>Qualifications for Graduates of Normal School Special and Regular Programs</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Shandong Provincial Department of Education stating that the principal of the Shandong Provincial First Rural Normal School, Xue Chengying, reported that most of the special program students of the school, who graduated in June of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], were assigned to various counties as primary school teachers. This spring, during the province's first continuing examination for primary school teachers, these students repeatedly sent letters requesting certification of their qualifications. Because there were no definite regulations regarding the qualifications of these graduates, it was inconvenient to reply. Later, it was found that when these students applied to the school's special program, their original qualifications included graduates of the old-system normal schools, graduates of the old-system middle schools, graduates of agricultural and forestry vocational schools, and graduates of the new-system normal middle schools. Considering the differences in qualifications and the lack of differences in proficiency, a temporary standard was formulated with reference to the curriculum of the second division of the old-system normal schools and submitted for approval. After the students completed the course and graduated, their work in the local community was equivalent to that of graduates of the old-system normal schools, but their qualifications have not yet been certified by the government, so regulations are urgently needed to ensure compliance. Furthermore, there are no written regulations regarding the qualifications of graduates of the school's regular program. As the graduation of the regular program is approaching, this should also be regulated and made known for compliance. Therefore, the school's special and regular program graduates' qualifications are the same as which qualifications? We hereby request the Ministry of Education to issue an official decree for compliance. (The rest omitted). The Ministry of Education instructed: "The report is noted. After reviewing the first National Education Conference of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], the proposal for the normal school system was approved and promulgated by the former Da Xue Yuan [National Academia] under Order No. 539. Article 5 of the proposal states, 'Rural normal schools may admit junior high school graduates or students with equivalent education who have teaching experience and are determined to reform rural education. The length of study for these students may be temporarily set at one year or more.' The special program established by the provincial First Rural Normal School is consistent with this article. The qualifications of its graduates should be the same as those of normal school graduates who have completed junior high school and received one year of training. As for the school's regular program, the admission standard is primary school graduation and the length of study is ____." The above is to be conveyed for information.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University's School Affairs Still in Abeyance</h3>
<p>Departmental Affairs Handled Independently by Each Department</p>
<p>More than twenty days have passed since the President of Zhejiang University, Shao Peizi, resigned. He has submitted five resignation letters, and the Ministry of Education has attempted to retain him four times, in addition to offering face-to-face consolation. The final resignation letter has not yet been approved. Although Shao himself has returned to Hangzhou, he has not yet returned to the school, causing school affairs to be in abeyance. The school usually holds a school affairs meeting once a month, but this month it was not held due to the president's resignation. Currently, departmental affairs are handled independently by each department. When funding from the central or provincial government arrives, the secretariat will allocate it as usual. Furthermore, the agricultural department of the university originally had Japanese professors. Since the Northeast Incident, the department dismissed the Japanese professors, and the relevant academic programs were suspended. After the new president, Xu Xuan, took over, he sent students to study at the Central University in Nanjing. They departed a few days ago.</p>

<h3>Middle School Students Petitioning in Beijing Returned to Shanghai Completely Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>University Students to Return to Shanghai in Entirety This Morning</p>
<p>More than ten thousand students from major middle and high schools in this city went to Beijing on the 24th of this month to petition. After Chairman Chiang gave a personal address, the result was satisfactory. All the middle school students returned to Shanghai yesterday morning (the 28th), and the university students are also scheduled to return to Shanghai in their entirety at 9:00 AM this morning. The reporter from the New Sound Society learned about the process of this petition from the middle school students yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Process: The four thousand middle school students who went to Beijing this time were divided into three groups. The first two groups departed from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 24th, one after the other. The final third group of delegates and students departed from the North Shanghai Railway Station only after 1:00 AM the next day. Upon arrival in Beijing, they gathered all the middle school students. The chairman contacted various parties to arrange accommodation for everyone. After 10:00 PM that evening, they went to the Central Party Headquarters, where Zhang Daofan, Tong Fuhai, and Cheng Dafang met with them. The next morning, the 26th, at 9:00 AM, they met with Chairman Chiang at the Central Military Academy. Initially, they were received by Zhang Daofan and Zhang Zhizhong, and then Chairman Chiang personally gave an address. In the afternoon, they went to the Central Party Headquarters again, where Zhang Daofan met with them. After leaving the Central Party Headquarters, more than five hundred students returned to Shanghai from Beijing, arriving in Shanghai at 10:00 PM. The remaining students decided to return to Shanghai in three groups, leaving Beijing by train after 10:00 PM the following day (the 27th), and arriving in Shanghai at 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM, and 2:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Three Points of Petition: Initially, there were five points of petition, but for the sake of urgency, they were changed to three points: (1) Request the government to use military force to recover lost territory and to provide substantial assistance to Ma Zhanshan; (2) Request the government to immediately issue firearms to the middle school volunteer army units; (3) Request the government to immediately issue a clear order to protect the people's patriotic movement. Chairman Chiang gave a satisfactory reply. Regarding the issue of firearms, due to the lack of domestic military supplies, it was not possible to provide them, but model guns would be issued within a month for practice. The university students who petitioned were scheduled to leave Beijing by train at 9:00 PM last night and return to Shanghai. If there were no obstacles along the way, they would arrive in Shanghai completely by 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>The Riri News Agency reported that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of University Students sent a telegram to the students petitioning in Beijing, urging them to return to Shanghai immediately. The telegram read: "Shanghai students of the Central University in Nanjing petitioning delegation: The 16th Congress of Representatives has resolved to request that you return to Shanghai immediately. Please set your travel dates and reply by telegram to facilitate a warm welcome. Do not delay." The Shanghai University Federation was touched. According to the long-distance telephone bureau, the students petitioning in Beijing would not be able to depart until 9:00 PM due to transportation issues and would not arrive in Shanghai until after 5:00 AM this morning. Upon hearing this news, the students remaining in Shanghai were all preparing to go to the station to welcome them.</p>

<h3>Second Week of Stott Cup</h3>
<p>Jinan Eliminated After Defeat</p>
<p>Goalkeeping Error Causes Two to Three Loss</p>
<p>Lux All Players Performed Well</p>
<p>The brilliant Jinan soccer team was defeated by Lux in Recreation Ground today, losing by two to three. After this game in the Stott Cup, Jinan will never advance further. It is hoped that Jinan will seek a new path and find another way out. The referee was Carmichael.</p>
<h3>Lux Lineup</h3>
<p>A. O'Gorman 愛琪</p>
<p>Dunton 納 傑</p>
<p>David 麥特 湯潑尼</p>
<p>D. O'Gorman 傑蘇</p>

<h3>Jinan Team Lineup</h3>
<p>Liang Shutang Long Liwen</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Qiu Dongyan</p>
<p>Wen Ding Zhuang Shihong Zhen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing Yang Baosen</p>
<p>Chen Fuzhong Mei Hongbin</p>
<h3>Lux Strong with Both Flexibility and Strength</h3>
<p>The entire Lux team is nimble and skilled, flexible and strong, similar to the once-strong Portugal team. In terms of performance, goalkeeper David should be given first credit. He snatched the ball from danger under iron hooves. Central defender Matt kept a close eye on Chen Zhenhe, never leaving his side. His teammates were also able to provide adequate support. The center defense line was strong. However, it paled in comparison in the second half. The movements of the two inside forwards were slightly slow, but they did not make any big mistakes. The forwards were quite effective, able to dribble and run. The left wing and right inside were better than the others. Of the three goals scored, the last one was the most impressive. The first two goals might not have been successful if they had encountered good defenders.</p>
<h3>Unsound Jinan Suffers Defeat</h3>
<p>Looking back at Jinan, the unfortunate thing was the dereliction of duty by the goalkeeper. Although his skills and artistry have improved, and there is hope that he will reach the peak one day, this is the crucial pass that determines the life and death of the entire army. A slight mistake can lead to a major error. Why did the mistake happen again and again? Jinan's defeat was partly due to this. However, those who share the responsibility are the unsound center defense line. Liang Shutang resisted strongly. Zhuang Chen was not as good as him. From then on, Jinan's hinterland became a troubled area. Although Feng Jiang were both intelligent and brave, they could not attend to both ends. The front line lacked regular troops. The combat power of Luo Haiguang and Fu Hexuan suddenly became weak. They missed many opportunities in front of the goal. Reserve Yang Baosen was lively, but he suffered from incorrect positioning. Long Liwen passed the ball well, but he was slow to move. Chen Zhenhe and Mei Hongbao achieved remarkable results. Qiu Dongyan was average.</p>
<h3>Fierce Stalemate</h3>
<p>At the start of the war, the two sides fought fiercely. Long Liwen showed his skills, with a surprising shot. The enemy tried to stop him, but they were fended off. Qiu Dongyan got help and dribbled deep, but he was too slow and the ball was snatched away by a defender. Then Chen Zhenhe pounced straight towards the enemy's goal like a swift swallow. Without support, his efforts were in vain. Lux advanced on five fronts, and the center defense line collapsed. They invaded the hinterland and attacked the dragon gate. Goalkeeper Wen caught the ball twice but dropped it again. He almost made a big mistake. If he hadn't lost it at that time, it would have been as if he had been helped by heaven. Chen Zhenhe attacked again, but he couldn't get support from his teammates, and his efforts failed.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhenhe Scores in the Second Half</h3>
<p>Lux sent in Tang Fani to counterattack. Tang got the ball and lunged forward. Fortunately, Chen Fuzhong saved the day in time, otherwise it would have been a disaster. Jinan's interior stabilized slightly, and the forwards rushed forward. Chen Zhenhe and Long Liwen created a crisis in the enemy's camp, but Qiu's tactics were inappropriate and he gained nothing. Finally, after half an hour, Long passed from the left wing to the front of the goal. As the two sides scrambled, Chen Zhenhe shot from left to right, hitting the post and going into the net. The sound of firecrackers rose with the cheers. Jinan led the counterattack, hoping to continue their efforts.</p>
<h3>Lux Scores in a Blink of an Eye</h3>
<p>In a blink of an eye, Lux took advantage of a free kick to counterattack. Middle forward Tang shot hard at the goal. Goalkeeper Wen jumped up to hit it, but missed. He hit it again, but the ball didn't go far. At this time, enemy troops were surrounded within five steps. Left inside forward Jie Sheng kicked the ball into the goal. Jinan's hard-won lead was lost too quickly. Immediately, an urgent order was issued to plan another counterattack. After repeated attacks, Lux went straight in from the left flank and shot for goal. Goalkeeper Wen defended the key point and turned danger into safety. Long passed from the left wing to the front of the goal. Chen Zhenhe greeted it with a header, but it went a foot above the crossbar. A truce was called, and each side scored one goal.</p>
<h3>Jinan Suffers Misfortune in Full Swing</h3>
<p>The fierce battle resumed. Mei Hongbao kicked the ball, and the ball broke through the air. The atmosphere became tense. The three central players Chen, Qiu, and Yang chased after it. The goalkeeper got the ball. The three men pushed and shoved the goalkeeper and the ball into the net at the same time. The referee ruled that it was dangerous action and the goal was invalid. Unexpectedly, a strange change occurred. Lux's left winger, Ai Erqi, shot from afar. Jiang Shanjing stepped aside to let the goalkeeper catch it, but Tang 尼 broke in from the side and dribbled the ball into the goal. Jinan was now one to two behind. The two teams faced each other for more than ten minutes. Chen Zhenhe then made a solo charge, but the inside defender stopped him from behind. He was penalized twelve yards. Qiu Dongyan succeeded with one shot, making it 2-2. Jinan's momentum was strong again, and they kept attacking the gate. In the last eight minutes, left winger Ai Erqi passed from left to right, and right winger Locke Hard shot at the goal, scoring again. At this critical moment, Mei Hongbao made three good contributions, all of which could have turned the tide, but his teammates handled it improperly, and they ultimately lost by two to three.</p>

<p>Six Teams in Group A, Eight Teams in Group B</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Basketball League held a representative meeting at the Chinese Basketball Room at 4:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from each team attended. First, the secretary reported the results of the committee meeting and stated that the committee was a good phenomenon, due to the sudden increase in the number of members to fourteen teams. However, because there are many new members and the skill level of each team is not bad, it is not possible to divide them into grades, so they can only be divided into one unit. Regarding this case, because each team regrets that it hinders the interest in competition, they voluntarily registered for two groups, A and B. Group A includes Chongde, Liangjiang, Yaguang, Southeast, Jinan, and China, a total of six teams. Group B includes Huaxia, Daxia, Shangzhong, Nanyang, Qiangnan, Qiangdong, Jiangjiang, and Liangliang, a total of eight teams. The competition is scheduled to start on December 1st, and the schedule was determined by lot on the spot (to be announced later). Three games are scheduled each day, and it is expected to end in two weeks.</p>

<h3>Chinese Group Soccer</h3>
<p>Jinan Lost to Lingnan 1-3</p>
<p>The Jinan soccer team was disappointed in the Stott Cup, and at the same time, they suffered a major blow in the Chinese group of the Chinese Football Association, losing 3-1 to the Lingnan team at the Chinese Baseball Field. The referee was He Chunhui.</p>
<h3>Lingnan Team</h3>
<p>Chen Pu Zhao Jie Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Lin Guoyong</p>
<p>Yang Jie Liang Heng Chen Jiaqiu Li Yichen</p>
<p>Feng Nianhan</p>
<p>Huang Zhaoming Ouyang Shuiyuan Liang Minfa</p>
<h3>Jinan Team</h3>
<p>Huang Huanchang Yun Fengdi (down) He Xueyao Luo Yuming (up) Jiang Zongmian</p>
<p>Cai Rongrui Cao Yuwan (down) Zhang Rongwen</p>
<p>Liu Hexiang Chen Jinzhi (up) Du Chaoyuan Chen Yongcong Liu Zukan</p>
<h3>Three to One</h3>
<p>Less than twenty minutes into the game, Chen Hongguang opened the scoring. Then Jinan's Du Chaoyuan dribbled the ball into the opponent's half. In the first half, the score was tied at one to one. Li Yichen only played for twenty minutes before being injured and replaced by Ouyang. From the start of the second half, Lingnan continued to dominate. Ouyang received the ball from Chen Hongguang and scored. Finally, Chen Hongguang scored again, ending the game at three to one.</p>
<h3>About the Championship</h3>
<p>Among the teams in the Chinese group, Jinan and Lingnan are the strongest and have the highest hopes of winning the championship. Although the Chinese group is still in its early stages, the meeting of the two teams is tantamount to determining the championship, so yesterday's game was very important and contained a decisive nature. With Lingnan winning this game, the future is very optimistic.</p>

<p>Petition to the National Government: "Submitting a petition to send representatives to present the following situation, humbly requesting your review and adoption for the sake of the nation's destiny. Since the violent Japanese occupied our territory, the sanctions of the League of Nations' principles have been disappointing. Moreover, the illegal attacks of the Japanese enemy are becoming more and more intense. The people are suffering under the cruel oppression of the violent Japanese, crying and wailing, and are willing to die to resist the violent Japanese. However, your government has been claiming military plans, delaying action. Months have passed, and what is the result of months of preparation? Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, and Heilongjiang has retreated. Our hearts and souls are for the country, how can we bear such madness? The affiliated associations and over 800,000 workers, humbly belonging to the citizens of the Republic of China, would not hesitate to die for the country. We would rather fight and die in resistance than survive without resisting. We deeply understand the seriousness of the unprecedented national crisis, and with heartfelt tears, we respectfully submit the following requests: (1) Request that Commander-in-Chief Chiang lead the army north to recover lost territories by force as soon as possible. (2) Request the distribution of firearms to the national volunteer army. (3) Request automatic withdrawal from the League of Nations. (4) Request severe punishment for Zhang Xueliang and other officials who lost territory. All the workers of the affiliated associations are stamping their feet and beating their chests, seeking the realization of these requests, and have specially and urgently sent hundreds of representatives to Nanjing to urgently present the matter. We implore you to consider the national crisis, accept our requests, and implement them as soon as possible. The affiliated associations are ready to sacrifice ourselves and await orders, and will be the government's backing. One day, we will die together on the battlefield and smile in the afterlife. Respectfully submitted to the National Government."</p>
<p>Telegram to Guangdong: "Most Urgent. Guangzhou. To the Extraordinary Meeting: We hear that the Fourth National Congress has broken down in its resolutions, and Sun and Chen have withdrawn from the meeting. One wave subsides, another rises. Regardless of who started the conflict, they are all traitors to the Republic of China. You all advocate 'peace to save the country,' proclaiming slogans. Now that the national crisis is deepening day by day, we, the people who are about to die, will forever vow to protect the country with our lives, and fight on the battlefield. How can we focus on current trivial interests and put the life of the nation behind us? The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. You are wise men, can you not regret and fear? We plead with tears, not expressing all we want to say. Sincerely submitted by the Shanghai City Labor Unions and over 800,000 workers."</p>
<h3>The Banking and Finance Industries Express a Unified Stance</h3>
<p>The Prohibition of Cash Exports Is Difficult</p>
<p>If There Are No Major Changes in the Situation</p>
<p>Then There Are No Major Problems with Finance</p>
<p>A large amount of cash has been exported from this city in recent days, resulting in a remarkably tight money market, which has attracted much attention from all sectors. Yesterday, the Bankers Association held a meeting to discuss this issue, and also consulted with the money industry. Both sides agreed that an absolute ban on cash exports is impossible. The details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<p>Consultation Between the Two Industries: Qin Runqing and other members of the Money Industry Association, and Hu Mengjia and other members of the Bankers Association, held an informal consultation yesterday afternoon regarding the issue of cash exports. This was in response to the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting preventive measures. They believed that the tight money market was related to the current situation and that there were no good ways to prevent it. They decided that both sides would reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in writing. As for the allegation that banking and finance professionals were seeking petty profits and being exploited by the enemy, they believed that this was not the case. Moreover, the industry associations had already notified all members to sever economic ties with the Japanese.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Discussion: A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Guo Rui, a consultant to the municipal government, yesterday and inquired about the municipal government's opinion on the issue of cash exports. According to him, the issue of cash exports is closely related to finance, and the mayor is paying close attention to it. Since seeing the reports, he had an informal discussion with Secretary-General Yu this morning. Later, because the competent authority is the Social Affairs Bureau, it was decided to wait for the bureau to submit a report before discussing preventive measures.</p>
<p>Bank Meeting: The Bankers Association held a regular meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at No. 4 Hong Kong Road, the association's headquarters. More than ten executive committee members attended, including Hu Mengjia, Li Fuson, Xu Jilu, Wang Zhixin, Sun Jingxi, and Tang Shoumin. The issue of cash exports was discussed in detail. After the meeting, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency asked Lin Kanghou about the results of the meeting. According to him, banks were transporting cash to Tianjin purely for the purpose of regulating finance. The tight money market was related to the current situation. After the Tianjin Incident, people everywhere were panicked. Foreign banks were absorbing cash, and Chinese banks were increasing their reserves for preparation. They were also being more cautious about loans. Many people were storing cash as a precaution. For example, in this city with a population of three million, if each person stored ten dollars in cash, then thirty million dollars in cash would no longer be circulating. Therefore, a complete ban on cash exports is not feasible. As long as the situation is calm, the tight money market can return to normal. Observing the current market, if there are no major changes in the situation, then there are no major problems with finance.</p>
<p>Money Industry Reply: The Money Industry Association replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Regarding your letter concerning the recent reports of cash being transported to Dalian and other places, requesting detailed deliberation and a reply to the association for consideration, we have received it. We immediately convened a temporary executive committee meeting and submitted it for discussion. We all admire your association's efforts to maintain the city's finances and prevent problems before they arise. However, cash exports are a very common and legitimate business for the banking and finance industries. Chinese firms in various ports that have dealings with Shanghai banks and money houses have funds deposited and entrust us with the task of shipping silver dollars via letters and telegrams, which we cannot refuse to handle on their behalf. Moreover, the shipment of silver dollars is all for the purpose of regulating finance and has no other purpose. It is currently the harvest season, and there is a greater need for funds. The shipment of silver dollars is originally a common occurrence every year. Moreover, Tianjin has been troubled, and people are panicked, inevitably storing more cash as a precaution. Therefore, the number of exports seems to be higher than usual. If exports are completely banned, it will inevitably cause panic in the finances of various ports, business will be suspended, and this city will also be affected. A ban on exports is practically impossible. If there are good methods and ideas that will not impede the national finances and can prevent the enemy from absorbing them, it would be welcome news for the people of the country. All the gentlemen of your association are working to overcome the current difficulties and have a clear understanding of the business situation. Please discuss this further so that we can consider both aspects. That would be greatly appreciated."</p>
<h3>Guangdong Supports Zhang Fakui in Resisting Japan</h3>
<p>Requesting Immediate Return to Guangdong to Discuss Concrete Measures</p>
<p>Since Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, was inspired by righteous indignation and volunteered to aid Heilongjiang, Nanjing has already expressed its approval. Regarding this matter, Wang Jingwei, the Guangdong representative staying in Shanghai, telegraphed Chen Bonan and Li Delin, the two commanders-in-chief in Guangzhou, on the 26th to request approval on their behalf. Wang received a reply telegram from Chen and Li yesterday, expressing their support. The telegram stated briefly, "Xianghua has a patriotic zeal and has volunteered to fight the Japanese. We greatly support this. At a time when the national crisis is at its head and foreign enemies are pressing, not only should Xianghua's army take this action, but all the soldiers of our First and Fourth Army Groups should also go to the national crisis and resist the invaders together. We urgently hope that Xianghua will return to Guangdong immediately to discuss concrete measures."</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Receives Telegram from Hu and Sun Informing That</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Dispute Is Expected to Be Resolved</p>
<p>Hu Indicates He Will Not Go to Guangzhou Unless the Proposal Is Rescinded</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Visited Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>At the Fourth National Congress of Guangdong, a dispute arose because some representatives did not support the members of the first, second, and third sessions as the basic elected members of the fourth session, and overturned the resolution of the seventh preparatory meeting for peace. It is now known that Hu Hanmin, Wu Chaochu, and others have met with Sun Ke, Chen Youren, and others after arriving in Hong Kong. Yesterday, Wang Jingwei and Zou Lu received telegrams from Hu, Sun, and others in Hong Kong, reporting on the mediation of the situation at the Fourth National Congress. According to Wang, Hu and the others have met with Sun, Chen, Li, and others and have decided on a solution. The general idea is to require the Fourth National Congress of Guangdong to do its best to remedy the situation, ensuring that it is based on the resolutions of the preparatory meeting for peace and that the peace proposal is not overturned. Hu indicated that he would not go to Guangzhou otherwise, so the resolution should not be a problem. According to Zou Lu, regarding the matter of the members of the first, second, and third sessions being elected as basic members of the fourth session, it has now been decided to submit it as an extraordinary meeting, rather than proposing the list resolved by the peace conference for election. All other matters are not a major problem, so the resolution should not be difficult.</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu Arrives in Shanghai: Chen Mingshu, a representative sent by Nanjing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at about 8:00 AM on the Shanghai-Nanjing express train. After getting off the train, he visited Wang at Pu Shi Road in the French Concession at 9:30 AM, talking for about two hours, and leaving at 11:40 AM. According to Wang, Chen came as a representative of Nanjing to inquire about how the dispute at the Fourth National Congress of Guangdong would be resolved. Wang told Chen the general idea of the telegram he had received from Hong Kong so that he could report to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Visitors to Wang Yesterday: Wang Maogong, a representative of the Fourth National Congress of Guangdong, arrived in Shanghai with Ms. He Xiangning at 4:00 PM yesterday and went to visit Wang Jingwei at Xin Pu Shi Road to report on the events of the Fourth National Congress of Guangdong.

<h3>He Xiangning Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Ms. He Xiangning, a member of the Second Central Committee, returned to China at the end of last month from France, where she had gone last year, due to the many national difficulties.

She arrived at the pier at the China Merchants Bureau's Central Warehouse on Dongbo Broadway Road in Hongkou at about 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhou Qigang, Ding Chaowu, Liu Yazi, Gan Naikang, and many other members of the Central Committee, as well as Chen Xihui, a representative of the Mayor of Shanghai, went to the pier to welcome her. After getting off the ship, Ms. He took a car to the residence of Sun Yat-sen's wife, Soong Ching Ling, on Moliere Road in the French Concession to talk for a long time. It is said that Ms. He is currently planning to stay temporarily at Sun's residence or at Gan Naikang's residence.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Replies to the Shanghai Public Organizations' Telegram</h3>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Zhu Ziqiao, Chu Huiseng, and the various public organizations of the Minzhi Primary and Secondary Schools in this city from Hailun yesterday, saying, "Your telegram has been received. I am honored by your praise and deeply grateful for your generous donations. All the soldiers of the three armies express their gratitude. Our government has now moved to Hailun. We have sent personnel to Harbin to contact you for the transfer of the funds you remitted. Sincerely, Ma Zhanshan."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bobbin Lace and Embroidery Industry Association previously donated 1,400 yuan, led by Lin Zuonian, Wang Xiangfu, Cheng Wenming, Li Jiansan, Lin Yinmao, and other members of the Standing Committee, to aid Chairman Ma Zhanshan's military expenses in Heilongjiang Province.

They have now received a reply telegram from Chairman Ma, saying, "To the Shanghai Bobbin Lace and Embroidery Industry Association: Your telegram has been received.

<h3>Representatives of Over Seventy Labor Unions in This City</h3>
<p>Will Petition in Nanjing Tonight</p>
<p>Presenting Four Points to the National Government</p>
<p>Telegraphing Guangdong to Resolve Disputes and Unite</p>
<p>Over seventy labor unions in this city, including postal workers, decided in an emergency meeting the night before last to organize a labor petition group to go to Nanjing tonight. They will request Chairman Chiang to move north to recover lost territories and telegraph Guangdong to promptly resolve disputes and unite. The details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: Postal Workers Union, Postal Employees Union, various district water and electricity industries, tobacco industry, cotton weaving industry, cotton spinning industry, shipbuilding industry, cleaning industry, pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical trade, and over seventy other labor unions held an emergency meeting the night before last (27th) and expressed serious concerns about the current situation. (1) They will urgently telegraph Guangdong in the name of all labor unions in the city, requesting them to promptly resolve disputes and unite. (2) Each labor union will send two to five representatives to form a labor petition group, scheduled to take the night express train to Nanjing on the 29th. (3) The group is expected to have over three hundred people, with Chuan Dewei of the Postal Employees Union as the commander-in-chief and the Water and Electricity Industry Union of the First District as the deputy commander. The publishing industry, the tobacco industry of the Fourth District, the tobacco industry of the Fifth District, the cotton weaving industry of the Seventh District, the pharmaceutical industry, and five other labor unions will serve as disciplinary officers. (4) They will telegraph the Ministry of Railways to request free train tickets.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Ministry of Railways: The labor petition group of this city telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday, saying, "To the Nanjing Ministry of Railways: The labor representatives' petition group has hundreds of people. They will take the train tonight to petition in Nanjing. Please order the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau to add cars and waive fares. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Labor Petition Group."</p>
<p>Petition to the National Government: "Submitting a petition to send representatives to present the following situation, humbly requesting your review and adoption for the sake of the nation's destiny. Since the violent Japanese occupied our territory, the sanctions of the League of Nations' principles have been disappointing. Moreover, the illegal attacks of the Japanese enemy are becoming more and more intense. The people are suffering under the cruel oppression of the violent Japanese, crying and wailing, and are willing to die to resist the violent Japanese. However, your government has been claiming military plans, delaying action. Months have passed, and what is the result of months of preparation? Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, and Heilongjiang has retreated. Our hearts and souls are for the country, how can we bear such madness? The affiliated associations and over 800,000 workers, humbly belonging to the citizens of the Republic of China, would not hesitate to die for the country. We would rather fight and die in resistance than survive without resisting. We deeply understand the seriousness of the unprecedented national crisis, and with heartfelt tears, we respectfully submit the following requests: (1) Request that Commander-in-Chief Chiang lead the army north to recover lost territories by force as soon as possible. (2) Request the distribution of firearms to the national volunteer army. (3) Request automatic withdrawal from the League of Nations. (4) Request severe punishment for Zhang Xueliang and other officials who lost territory. All the workers of the affiliated associations are stamping their feet and beating their chests, seeking the realization of these requests, and have specially and urgently sent hundreds of representatives to Nanjing to urgently present the matter. We implore you to consider the national crisis, accept our requests, and implement them as soon as possible. The affiliated associations are ready to sacrifice ourselves and await orders and will be the government's backing. One day, we will die together on the battlefield and smile in the afterlife. Respectfully submitted to the National Government."</p>
<p>Telegram to Guangdong: "Most Urgent. Guangzhou. To the Extraordinary Meeting: We hear that the Fourth National Congress has broken down in its resolutions, and Sun and Chen have withdrawn from the meeting. One wave subsides, another rises. Regardless of who started the conflict, they are all traitors to the Republic of China. You all advocate 'peace to save the country,' proclaiming slogans. Now that the national crisis is deepening day by day, we, the people who are about to die, will forever vow to protect the country with our lives and fight on the battlefield. How can we focus on current trivial interests and put the life of the nation behind us? The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. You are wise men; can you not regret and fear? We plead with tears, not expressing all we want to say. Sincerely submitted by the Shanghai City Labor Unions and over 800,000 workers."</p>
<h3>The Banking and Finance Industries Express a Unified Stance</h3>
<p>The Prohibition of Cash Exports Is Difficult</p>
<p>If There Are No Major Changes in the Situation</p>
<p>Then There Are No Major Problems with Finance</p>
<p>A large amount of cash has been exported from this city in recent days, resulting in a remarkably tight money market, which has attracted much attention from all sectors. Yesterday, the Bankers Association held a meeting to discuss this issue and also consulted with the money industry. Both sides agreed that an absolute ban on cash exports is impossible. The details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<p>Consultation Between the Two Industries: Qin Runqing and other members of the Money Industry Association, and Hu Mengjia and other members of the Bankers Association, held an informal consultation yesterday afternoon regarding the issue of cash exports. This was in response to the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting preventive measures. They believed that the tight money market was related to the current situation and that there were no good ways to prevent it. They decided that both sides would reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in writing. As for the allegation that banking and finance professionals were seeking petty profits and being exploited by the enemy, they believed that this was not the case. Moreover, the industry associations had already notified all members to sever economic ties with the Japanese.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Discussion: A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Guo Rui, a consultant to the municipal government, yesterday and inquired about the municipal government's opinion on the issue of cash exports. According to him, the issue of cash exports is closely related to finance, and the mayor is paying close attention to it. Since seeing the reports, he had an informal discussion with Secretary-General Yu this morning. Later, because the competent authority is the Social Affairs Bureau, it was decided to wait for the bureau to submit a report before discussing preventive measures.</p>
<p>Bank Meeting: The Bankers Association held a regular meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at No. 4 Hong Kong Road, the association's headquarters. More than ten executive committee members attended, including Hu Mengjia, Li Fuson, Xu Jilu, Wang Zhixin, Sun Jingxi, and Tang Shoumin. The issue of cash exports was discussed in detail. After the meeting, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency asked Lin Kanghou about the results of the meeting. According to him, banks were transporting cash to Tianjin purely for the purpose of regulating finance. The tight money market was related to the current situation. After the Tianjin Incident, people everywhere were panicked. Foreign banks were absorbing cash, and Chinese banks were increasing their reserves for preparation. They were also being more cautious about loans. Many people were storing cash as a precaution. For example, in this city with a population of three million, if each person stored ten dollars in cash, then thirty million dollars in cash would no longer be circulating. Therefore, a complete ban on cash exports is not feasible. As long as the situation is calm, the tight money market can return to normal. Observing the current market, if there are no major changes in the situation, then there are no major problems with finance.</p>
<p>Money Industry Reply: The Money Industry Association replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Regarding your letter concerning the recent reports of cash being transported to Dalian and other places, requesting detailed deliberation and a reply to the association for consideration, we have received it. We immediately convened a temporary executive committee meeting and submitted it for discussion. We all admire your association's efforts to maintain the city's finances and prevent problems before they arise. However, cash exports are a very common and legitimate business for the banking and finance industries. Chinese firms in various ports that have dealings with Shanghai banks and money houses have funds deposited and entrust us with the task of shipping silver dollars via letters and telegrams, which we cannot refuse to handle on their behalf. Moreover, the shipment of silver dollars is all for the purpose of regulating finance and has no other purpose. It is currently the harvest season, and there is a greater need for funds. The shipment of silver dollars is originally a common occurrence every year. Moreover, Tianjin has been troubled, and people are panicked, inevitably storing more cash as a precaution. Therefore, the number of exports seems to be higher than usual. If exports are completely banned, it will inevitably cause panic in the finances of various ports, business will be suspended, and this city will also be affected. A ban on exports is practically impossible. If there are good methods and ideas that will not impede the national finances and can prevent the enemy from absorbing them, it would be welcome news for the people of the country. All the gentlemen of your association are working to overcome the current difficulties and have a clear understanding of the business situation. Please discuss this further so that we can consider both aspects. That would be greatly appreciated."</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Printing and Distributing Books on Japanese Aggression Against Our Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters recently compiled and printed a "Table of Painful History of Japanese Aggression Against Our Country," which details the various cases of Japanese aggression against our country since the opening of trade. The explanations are very concise and suitable for hanging in various agencies, organizations, and schools, or for reference. Those who wish to consult it can directly write to the Propaganda Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters. In addition, the books "Tanaka's Aggressive Policy," "A Diagrammatic Explanation of Japanese Aggression in the Northeast," and "Collection of Anti-Japanese Patriotic Songs" previously printed by the Party Headquarters have received over a hundred requests for copies daily from all walks of life. As they have already been distributed, and considering the large number of requests, another 10,000 copies have been reprinted to meet the demand.</p>
<h3>Awards Ceremony for the Belgian Exposition</h3>
<p>Held Yesterday at the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The year 1930 (last year) marked the centenary of Belgian independence. Belgium held two expositions during the enthusiastic celebrations: one in Antwerp and one in Liège. China did not participate in the Antwerp exposition, only in the Liège one. As a result of the competition, China ranked third in terms of achievements. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the awards ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Belgian Consul Van Hante, five members of the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee, and the Belgian Vice-Consul were present. On the Chinese side were Zhang Qun (represented by Pan Gongzhan) representing the Executive Yuan, Zhao Jinqing representing the Ministry of Industry, Yang Xiaotang representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xu Peihuang representing the Ministry of Education, Xie Shoukang representing Belgium, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Exposition Collection Committee, Chu Minyi, the representative of the committee attending in Belgium, and dozens of members of the collection committee, exhibitors, and guests, totaling about 300 people. Xie Shoukang presided over the ceremony, with Tian Shoucheng, assistant member of the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee, serving as the recorder. After the ceremony was conducted according to etiquette, Chairman Xie Shoukang delivered the opening remarks. Then, Chu Minyi, the Chinese representative to the meeting, reported on the process. Next, Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Executive Yuan, announced the list of award-winning exhibitors. Subsequently, Belgian Consul Van Hante (translation) and Zhao Jinqing, among others, delivered speeches successively. Then, the award certificates were issued and photographs were taken before the event concluded. It is reported that the various medals have not yet arrived. Once they arrive, they will be issued at a later date. The report of Mr. Chu Minyi and the list of award winners are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chu Minyi's Report: Ladies and gentlemen, today we are holding the awards ceremony for the Belgian Exposition. I am extremely honored to have Chinese and Western guests, members of the collection committee, and exhibitors from all walks of life participating. I would like to express my deep gratitude. The year 1930 marked the centenary of Belgian independence, and a grand international exposition was held to celebrate it. Belgium had been preparing for this event for a long time, and our country was invited to participate during the time of the former Beijing government. At that time, the Beijing government, considering the amicable relations between China and Belgium, agreed to the request. After the establishment of the Nanjing government, Belgium reiterated its previous request. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, considering that the Beijing government had already agreed to participate, continued to recognize the agreement. The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce drafted a proposal, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, allocating 50,000 yuan and appointing me to represent China at the event. At the same time, the Ministry of Education also planned to establish a Chinese Education Hall at the Belgian exposition, and appointed me as the director of the preparatory committee, with a subsidy of 20,000 US dollars from the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee. After receiving the order, I realized that the opening date of the Belgian exposition was approaching, and without active preparations, the matter could not be accomplished. Therefore, I first established a representative office and requested the Ministries of Education and Industry and Commerce to jointly appoint Liu Xichang as the deputy representative, and Nong Ruhui, Chu Shoucheng, and Zhou Shida as secretaries, each responsible for carrying out various tasks. At the same time, to gather wisdom and facilitate the collection of exhibits, leaders from all walks of life in the country were invited to form an exhibit collection committee. Mr. Xie Shoukang was elected as the chairman, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai as the vice-chairman. Letters were sent to manufacturers across the country, soliciting exquisite exhibits. As a result, more than 180 boxes of industrial, commercial, educational, agricultural, and art products were collected and shipped to Belgium for the competition. I and the staff of the representative office then set off one after another to Belgium to attend the event. The Chinese venue was previously rented by the Chargé d'Affaires in Belgium, Mr. Luo. Due to limited funds, the rented space was small, about 360 square feet in the Belgian International Exhibition Department. With hundreds of boxes of exhibits collected, the layout and display were quite difficult. We had to build an exhibition hall within this limited space. Considering that the location was small, special attention had to be paid to the layout in order to attract the attention of foreigners. Therefore, I carefully planned and divided the hall into three sections: education, agriculture, and industry and commerce. I personally handled all the display matters, and all the staff worked diligently day and night. Deputy Representative Liu Xichang especially worked tirelessly in contacting and negotiating with various parties. Fortunately, the national exhibition hall opened on June 16, and everything was ready. Many foreign guests attended, and the Belgian public opinion praised it highly. After the opening of the national exhibition hall, thousands of people from various countries came to visit every day. Some praised the Chinese hall as the most beautiful hall. Although I was flattered by such undeserved praise, I felt ashamed. The exhibits from our country were mostly handicrafts, such as embroidery and carvings, with few mechanical products. These handicrafts were mostly extremely exquisite, and foreigners praised them upon seeing them. However, in today's world, a country cannot survive without the development of science. The exhibits displayed by China today were few in the field of science. Although tea, silk, porcelain, Jingtai blue, carvings, embroidery, etc., have long been famous overseas, they have not made much progress. This is what my colleagues and I felt ashamed and regretful about, and we could not be satisfied and complacent. As for the results of this competition, although we won many awards, and China ranked third in terms of the total number of awards won by various countries, which was an international honor, we could not be complacent. In reality, although China had many exhibits, they were not comparable to the emerging industries of European countries. As for China's achievement of so many awards this time, it was largely due to the efforts of Deputy Representative Liu. Mr. Liu worked extremely hard in handling the award evaluation affairs in order to protect the interests of the country's exhibitors, and he fought tirelessly back and forth with the exposition for the award levels and numbers of each exhibitor, which led to this achievement. The Belgian Exposition closed on November 3, and lasted for six months. During this period, I went to France, Belgium, Switzerland, and other countries to give lectures on sports, medicine, hygiene, and other issues, as well as on the party's past history and current policies. I also attended various conferences attached to the exposition. A fine arts exhibition was also held in the national exhibition hall to expand the promotion of Chinese art. Regarding the promotion of party principles, the Central Party Headquarters printed thousands of copies of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People in French and distributed them to tourists. Regarding commodities, tea from the China Tea Association and the directory of exhibits from our hall were given away, and the compilation of fine arts exhibits was well-received by people from various countries. The above is a brief report on some of the work. A special publication with detailed records will be published separately and is currently being printed. After publication, it will be sent to all attendees as a token of appreciation and remembrance. I have many feelings about participating in this competition in Belgium. I feel that the purpose of an international exposition is twofold: first, to display the industrial and commercial products of various countries and promote domestic goods for international trade competition, which is of the greatest importance in this event; second, to compare the products of various countries after they are displayed in order to seek progress, which is of great benefit. Therefore, the governments of European and American countries are willing to participate in the competition, and merchants are also happy to participate, with many voluntarily exhibiting their products. Looking back at our country, it is the opposite. When collecting exhibits, manufacturers were not enthusiastic. Only after persuasion did they reluctantly submit their exhibits. This is because they failed to recognize the purpose and benefits of the competition. In 1933, Chicago in the United States will convene a World's Fair, and in 1935, there will be an international exposition in Brussels. China must participate in both, and the scope of these two events will be even larger than the Liège exposition. How should our country actively prepare in advance to obtain even greater honor? I sincerely hope that the country will pay attention to this. As for the Belgian government and the authorities of the exposition, they provided various conveniences for our country to participate in the competition, which is deeply appreciated. The Belgian representative also graced the awards ceremony with their presence today, which is especially worthy of thanks. The relations between China and Belgium have always been cordial, and they should be further consolidated from now on.</p>
<p>Speech by the Belgian Consul: I am very grateful for what the Chinese representative said. The relationship between China and Belgium has always been harmonious. On behalf of Belgium, I warmly welcome and express my gratitude to the Chinese side for participating in the Belgian competition. Although I was unable to attend and witness the grand event at that time, based on the report of the Chinese representative, I am confident that the results of China's participation this time were satisfactory. I also wish China continued economic development at a rapid pace, national peace, and the happiness of the people. Zhao Jinqing, Yang Xiaotang, Xu Peihuang, Wang Xiaolai, Liao Shigong, and others then delivered speeches successively. The length of their speeches has been omitted.</p>

<h3>Finance Committee Meeting in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Date: ... December 2nd</p>
<p>Location: ... Central Bank</p>
<p>The Finance Committee specially established by the National Government, after holding its first meeting in Nanjing, was originally scheduled to hold its second meeting in Nanjing today (29th). It is now reported that the date has been changed to December 2nd at 9:00 AM, to be held at the Central Bank of Shanghai. The committee has already telegraphed all members to inform them.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Sea and Land Transportation After Boycott</h3>
<p>British Goods Congested: Since the boycott of Japanese goods, Chinese people have been purchasing foreign goods from Britain. The British goods ordered since late September have recently arrived one after another. In this month, the British Company's postal ships and Blue Funnel Line, Jardine Matheson, and Jardine Engineering Corporation cargo ships have arrived in Shanghai, totaling 14 ships, carrying no less than four or five thousand pieces of foreign cloth, tweed, wool, cotton yarn, etc., which is more than double the amount before the boycott. It is estimated that another 17 ships will arrive in Shanghai next month, all carrying large quantities of British goods.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Without Cargo: There are no more goods or passengers on Japanese ships in China's inland seas. Japanese ships on the Pacific route, such as Osaka's six express ships, Nippon Yusen's seven giant ships, and Kawasaki's large ships, are all operating on the Sino-American route. According to reports, when these companies' postal ships to the United States, such as the Chichibu Maru, Tatsuno Maru, and Hokuriku Maru, departed from Shanghai recently, the maximum amount of goods they carried to the United States was 11 tons of waste cloth, and the minimum was only one ton of miscellaneous goods, with virtually no business. This is because passengers to the United States have switched to British and American ships.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Trade: In the past month, although Japanese ships have continued to travel between China and Japan, there are no goods. Only crude potash is imported from Japan, with a small amount of inflow. Other goods are transshipped Indian cotton and American cotton. Japanese foreign cloth is no longer available. Among the exported goods, only wheat bran has been shipped in large quantities recently, with more than 200,000 dan. There are no other goods. The reason why ships have not stopped is because there are many overseas Chinese in the country, and passenger traffic is still good.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Society Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi, Wang Binyan, Chen Yaofu, Yang Fuyuan, Chen Zixin, Zhu Yiqian, Ling Zhibin, Zhou Bulian, Pan Hongding, Tang Zuanzhi, Yang Bingxing, and others initiated the organization of the Shanghai Society to promote the implementation of local autonomy in this district. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday, and Wang Binyan and nine others were elected as directors, and Zhu Yiqian, Zhou Bulian, and Chen Yaofu were elected as standing directors. Gu Xinyi and five others were elected as supervisors. They will take office immediately and begin work. In response to the difficult situation and fierce fighting of General Ma Zhanshan's isolated army in Heilongjiang Province, it was decided to provide financial assistance. All members will separately pledge donations. Before the pledged amount is fully collected, Wang Binyan, Chen Yaofu, and others will advance the funds immediately and remit them to the front lines to replenish military supplies.</p>
<h3>County-Level National Medicine Association Established</h3>
<p>There are quite a few Chinese medicine practitioners practicing medicine in various districts under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County. They have long lacked unity, resulting in a lack of investigation and communication. Therefore, the doctors, recognizing this situation, prepared to organize a National Medicine Association. With the permission of the County Party Headquarters, preparations have been completed. Yesterday, a meeting was held at the Minhang Chamber of Commerce to establish the association and elect executive committee members, and the association's constitution was approved. The county government sent Wu Jingqing, the district chief of Shanghai County's first district, to attend the meeting and supervise the proceedings.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, Three More Dead Bodies Were Unearthed</h3>
<p>Sixteen People Killed in Total</p>
<p>The Case Comes to a Temporary Close</p>
<p>The National Government Offers a Large Reward for the Murderer</p>
<p>Gu Shunzhang's Young Daughter Has Been Found</p>
<p>The Court Continued the Examination Yesterday</p>
<p>The sensational Communist Party massacre and body burial case, which caused a stir, came to a temporary conclusion yesterday. Since last Saturday, when a large number of corpses were discovered in Aitang Village, Yaozhu Jiao Road, in the French Concession, excavations have continued for a week in places such as Xiude Lane, Wuding Road, and No. 91 Chenjia Lane, Xinzha, in the Public Concession. Up to yesterday, a total of sixteen male and female corpses have been found, making it the most tragic incident ever in Shanghai. It is said that the authorities of the British and French Concessions were quite surprised after the case occurred. In terms of public security, they will learn from the past to avoid future mistakes and pay extra attention. The excavation situation yesterday and the National Government's offering a reward for the murderer are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Three Corpses Unearthed Yesterday: Inside No. 91, Aizi, Chenjia Lane, Xinzha Road, three more corpses were unearthed yesterday at the original excavation site. Among them, two were male corpses and one was a female corpse. The excavation time was the same as the previous day, starting work at 8:00 in the morning. About two hours after the excavation, a male corpse was unearthed near the southern corner at the time of the first discovery of the body. At about 11:00 a.m., two more corpses, one male and one female, were unearthed in the northeast corner, buried face to face. According to those present, it was undoubtedly Zhu Wanbai and his wife. The corpse near the south was either Wang Pan or Huang Dihong, but it could not be confirmed for a while. The binding situation of the above three male and female corpses was similar to those unearthed on the 26th and 27th. There were signs of strangulation around the neck. The two corpses of Zhu Wanbai and his wife were buried horizontally east and west, very close to each other. The female corpse looked very young, with a slim waist and plump hips, and a prominent chest. It is conceivable that she must have been very graceful when she was alive. It is said that Zhu's wife was a romantic woman, which is also credible.</p>
<p>The County Offers a Reward to Arrest the Murderer: It has been a week since the case occurred. Sixteen corpses have been unearthed in several places, including Aitang Village, Yaozhu Jiao Road, in the French Concession, Xiude Lane, Wuding Road, in the Public Concession, and No. 91, Aizi, Xinzha Road, namely No. 1095, Aizi, new address. As of yesterday, this matter has come to a temporary conclusion. Gu Shunzhang specially published an announcement in various newspapers today, stating that he joined the Communist Party in 1924 and participated in confidential work. He voluntarily withdrew in April this year and served the Party and the country. He never harmed the Communist Party. Unexpectedly, Zhou Enlai, Zhao Rong, etc. brutally killed more than ten members of his family and distant relatives. His mother-in-law's private savings of 7,000 yuan and Tian Dan's 3,000 yuan were also robbed. It was a rare tragedy. He also said that the National Government offered a reward of 20,000 yuan to arrest the murderers Zhou and Zhao. He also added a reward of 3,000 yuan. If anyone provides information leading to their arrest, they will be rewarded with 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Gu Shunzhang's Daughter Found: Gu Shunzhang's four-year-old daughter, Mao Mao, disappeared at the same time after Gu's wife, Zhang Xinghua, went missing. Recently, the headquarters sent detectives to buy water and purchase leads and tried their best to find her. Finally, she was found in a rural household ten miles east of Zhangyan Town, Songjiang, yesterday afternoon. She will be transferred to Nanjing within a few days so that Gu can reunite with his flesh and blood. It is said that this girl is exceptionally lively. After her mother, Xinghua, was killed, fearing that she would reveal secrets, she was sent to the countryside to be raised under a pretext. Li Longzhang, a communist party member arrested in Wuhan, was escorted to Shanghai by plane from Wuhan on the 26th and temporarily held at the headquarters. The fact that various places could be excavated without error this time is largely due to Li's confession. It is said that Li will still be escorted back to the Wuhan camp within a few days. Gu Jianzhong, the staff member of the Organization Department of the Central Executive Committee who handled the case, and Huang Kai, the special commissioner stationed in Shanghai of the Wuhan camp's detective office, etc., will also leave Shanghai in order to finalize the case.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Court Examination of the Corpses: The headquarters at No. 91, Aizi, Chenjia Lane, Xinzha Road, together with the Jing'an Temple police station, went to the house on the 26th of this month to excavate to a depth of six feet and found a female corpse with her hands and feet and neck tied with ropes. At 3:30 p.m. the next day, they continued to excavate in the house and found a male corpse with his hands and feet and neck also tied with ropes. Subsequently, the police station carried the two male and female corpses to the Feilun Road examination office. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, together with doctors Wei Ligong and Liu Chun, a clerk, came to the office to examine the corpses and start the case. According to the report of the head of the police station, no family members came to claim the corpses, so the names could not be investigated, and there was still one corpse to be unearthed. After Guo examined the report, he declared that one male and one female nameless corpses had been found to have been strangled to death before being buried underground and then unearthed. The corpses were handed over to Pushan Shishizhuang for collection. The police station will strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice. The one corpse that is about to be unearthed has been agreed to by the police station and will be collected there after being examined by the judge of the Special Court.</p>
<h3>The Wei Tingrong Case</h3>
<p>The Kidnappers Were Sentenced Yesterday</p>
<p>Lü Ruowang was Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Cai Weicai was Sentenced to Twenty Years in Prison</p>
<p>Zhao Weixian's Public Prosecution was Not Accepted</p>
<p>Wei Tingrong, the current Chinese director of the French Concession and former commander of the Chinese Volunteer Corps, was kidnapped in July 1929. The French police arrested three criminals, Zhu Jingcheng, Chen Zhongheng, and Tang Shiliang, who were interrogated by the former French Public Concession and sentenced to various crimes. In August this year, the special agency of the French police arrested Lü Ruowang (also known as Qian Fangxiang) from Shaoxing, Cai Weicai (also known as Jin Fuming) from Nanhui, and Zhao Weixian (the current director of the Sixth Independent Battalion of the Tax Police of the Ministry of Finance, Wei's brother-in-law, and the ninth son-in-law of the late Zhu Baosan) from Henan, who were involved in the case. The third person was sent to the Second Special District Local Court. The police station prosecuted them according to Article 371 of the Criminal Law. After the judge Xiong Huiping repeatedly questioned them, the defendants hired lawyers such as Gao Wenqi, Zhu Dianqing, Shan Yuhua, and Ge Zhaoji to defend them. The court declared the debate closed and waited for the sentencing on the 28th of this month. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday was the date of the judgment. The police station lawyer Fei Xizhen and the lawyers hired by the defendants arrived at the court one after another at 9:00 a.m. to wait for instructions. At 10:00 a.m., Judge Xiong came to the first criminal court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the court. After asking about their age, origin, and occupation one by one, he announced the judgment. The main text stated that Lü Ruowang, namely Qian Fangxiang, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of kidnapping for ransom. Cai Weicai, namely Jin Fuming, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for the crime of kidnapping for ransom. The number of days of detention before the final judgment will be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day. Zhao Weixian's public prosecution was not accepted. Lü Ruowang, Cai Weicai, and Zhao Weixian were all transferred to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Fifty or Sixty Bags of Rice</h3>
<p>Each Bag Contains Cotton Seeds</p>
<p>The Inside Story of Dafeng Rice Store</p>
<p>Ding Zitang Carefully Uncovers the Deception</p>
<p>Qian Ahua and Sun Guozhang, locals, falsely set up a Dafeng Rice Store at No. 3267 Zhoujiazui Road. From last month to this month, they defrauded Kongming Electrical Appliance Store at No. 550 Guangdong Road, Yongda Electrical Appliance Store at No. 74 Hubei Road, Ruixiang Electrical Appliance Store at No. 903 Donghan Bili Road, Yin Shanglian Native Products Store at No. 284 on the same road, and Samsung Auto Store at No. 607 Aiduya Road, etc., of electrical materials, hams, and tires worth more than 2,000 yuan. They all used the name of Dafeng Rice Store, stamped with seals or issued receipts, and agreed to pay the money on schedule. The above five households sent people to check the rice store and saw that it was a small store with a lot of rice stored, so they did not doubt it. Unexpectedly, they recently cheated Wufeng Flour Store at No. 362 Hailer Road to send 30 bags of flour. The car went to the store, and the manager, Ding Zitang, ordered the store to hand over the flour according to the number. The apprentice said that the boss was not there and gave two cents as the car fare and returned. However, Ding was very careful and went to Dafeng to check. He saw that there was very little rice stored in the rice boxes in the store. He wanted to take back the cash, but Qian Ahua suddenly looked terrified. He only saw a pile of rice bags, as many as fifty or sixty bags. He broke the rice bags to check and found that they were all cotton seeds. Qian saw that the empty city plan was exposed by Ding, and took the opportunity to go upstairs to hide. At this time, a special patrolman No. 707 happened to pass by. After inquiring about the situation, he opened the rice bags and found that each bag was filled with cotton seeds. He helped to arrest Qian and called Detective Peng Yushan to take him to the Harley Police Station for detention. Later, two more accomplices, Yan Guangdi and Sun Xinrong, were arrested. They also went to Qian Ahua's house at No. 356 Wuzhou Road and seized some electrical materials, a stolen tire, and a stack of his cards. They also went to Dafeng Rice Store and found five hams, which were also stolen. Yesterday, the police station sent the three criminals Qian, Yan, and Sun to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to the lawyer of the police station, Zhang Tianyin, Sun Guozhang, the shareholder of Dafeng Rice Store, has already fled and cannot be arrested. He also described the process in detail. Yan and Sun, the two defendants, are related to the case of defrauding Kongming Electrical Appliance Store at No. 550 Guangdong Road of materials worth 200 yuan. However, the receipt for the goods is guaranteed by Tengfeng Materials Store at No. 218 Bazi Road. The store was opened by Qian Ahua and a certain Jia. Jia is also on the run. He requested the court to severely punish the defendants with appropriate crimes. Then, Detective Peng Yushan reported the situation and presented the seized items for inspection. According to the victims' statements about the situation when they were cheated, Qian and the other three defendants stammered and argued. After Judge Xiao Xiefen examined the confession, he sentenced Qian Ahua to two years of imprisonment, Yan Guangdi to six months, and Sun Xinrong to two months. The number of days of detention before the final judgment was allowed to be offset. The seized items were claimed by the victims.</p>
<h3>Ningzhen Pacification District</h3>
<p>Welcoming and Extraditing the Notorious Bandit from Jurong</p>
<p>Zhu Shitong Knows He Has Little Education</p>
<p>Asks the Judge to Execute Him Quickly</p>
<p>Zhu Shitong (also known as Tieshan), a notorious bandit from Jurong, 27 years old, used to be a bathhouse attendant. He was a bandit in his hometown and committed serious crimes of robbery, kidnapping, arson, and murder. He fled to Shanghai and was investigated and arrested by the government. Now, Li Changlin, the commander of the Ningzhen Pacification District of Jiangsu, sent Li Chenglin to Shanghai with two unarmed soldiers to investigate and arrest Zhu. At 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Zhu was seen by Li at the corner of Xinxin Bridge Street on the French Da Malu and arrested. He called two patrolmen No. 554 and No. 553 to the scene and detained him in the police station. At the same time, Li telegraphed the headquarters and prepared a document to send personnel to Shanghai overnight to welcome and extradite him. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the police station sent Zhu to the Second Criminal Court of the Second Special District Local Court. The presiding judge Ge Zhitan questioned him. The lawyer of the police station said that the police station prosecuted the case according to Article 346 of the Criminal Law. The Chinese government submitted evidence for extradition, and the police station did not object. According to Li Chenglin, the official from the government, he submitted an official document stating the case and requesting permission to extradite the defendant. Zhu Shitong confessed that he had been doing business in Shanghai because bandits were causing trouble in his hometown. His child was killed. On September 27 last year, he returned to his hometown to risk his life to mediate and provide food so that they would not cause trouble. Later, he became the head of the security regiment and changed his name to Zhu Tieshan. On March 13 this year, he brought 80 yuan to Shanghai. Now he knows that he has little education since childhood and has been fooled. He asked the judge to execute him quickly. Judge Ge examined the confession and ordered Zhu Shitong to be handed over to Li Chenglin, the official from the Ningzhen Pacification District of Jiangsu, and brought back to be investigated and handled.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Federation Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Municipal Government Maintains the Habit of the Ash Industry</h3>
<p>Orders the Public Security and Social Bureaus to Investigate and Stop It</p>
<p>Shanghai News: The mineral ash factory industry and the brick ash industry in this city have always had the custom of not entering and leaving to collect goods, and the factory does not shake and sell as a yard. This summer, the brick ash industry has set up purchasing offices to collect on its own, which has caused a storm. Later, it was resolved by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce that it should not be collected on its own unless the supply is insufficient. However, Zhang Xiehe Brick Ash Bank still continued to destroy it. Although the Social Bureau has repeatedly advised him, it has been to no avail. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau was consulted to arrest him and fine him ten yuan. Zhang Xiehe Brick Ash Bank filed an appeal to the Municipal Government after being sentenced to a fine. The Municipal Government believed that the Public Security Bureau cited the Quick Police Law when imposing the fine and considered it inappropriate. It ordered the Public Security Bureau to return it. Zhang Xiehe resumed his destructive behavior after receiving the approval order from the Municipal Government, which led to another storm. The Mineral Ash Factory Industry Guild petitioned the Municipal Government to stop it. Yesterday, the Municipal Government had instructed the Social Bureau to investigate and stop it. The order said: In order to order things, according to the chairman of the Mineral Ash Industry Guild of this city, Ma Shaoquan, Zhang Xiehe Brick Ash Bank is destroying the mediation, destroying the industry, and begging the bureau to continue to stop the private unloading of guest ash to maintain business, etc. According to this, Zhang Xiehe Brick Ash Bank and the mineral ash manufacturer had a dispute over the guest ash. He filed an appeal against the Public Security Bureau's fine and the Municipal Government decided to revoke the original punishment and return the fine. This was because the Public Security Bureau cited the error of Article 33, Paragraph 1 of the Violation Police Punishment Law, so it was revoked. Of course, the resolution of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Article 17 of the regulations of the Mineral Ash Factory Industry Guild did not raise other issues and are still valid without any doubt. Moreover, the reason for the decision stated that "the dispute over the guest ash is another case and is not within the scope of this hearing and should be ignored." As for the dispute between the brick ash industry and the mineral ash factory industry, the bureau had previously reported to the government on the case filed by Zhang Xing, etc. and requested instructions. It was instructed to separately instruct the original petitioners. Now it is said that Zhang Xiehe Brick Ash Bank is destroying the mediation and destroying the industry. If it is true, it should be stopped immediately. In addition to the instructions, it is appropriate to inspect the attached copy and the copy of the appeal decision, so that the bureau can quickly and together with the Public Security Bureau investigate and stop it to avoid disputes, and report the handling situation for future reference. This order.</p>

<h3>Disaster Relief Shelter</h3>

<p>Layman Wang Yiting Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>Charitable People Presented Items</p>
<p>The Liuying Road No. 1 Disaster Relief Shelter Kindergarten in this port held an art fair from 2:00 p.m. yesterday (28th) to showcase the achievements of the disaster children in the past three months.

<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The opening of the art fair program is as detailed in yesterday's newspaper. The great philanthropist Layman Wang Yiting rushed back from Zhenjiang because he cared about the disaster relief for children. He delivered a speech to the disaster children, saying, "Dear brothers and sisters, you are today receiving the kindness of others and are able to show such excellent achievements. It is truly commendable. When you drink water, remember its source and also bestow kindness on others. Do not forget where you came from. You have a good foundation, and I hope that you will continue to improve in the future and become healthy citizens of the Republic of China, avenge the country, and avenge the nation. The parents of these children should also pay attention to cultivation and help them succeed. Do not be sporadic and abandon their studies." During the meeting, the students of Mailun College specially donated 19 yuan and 16 cents and entrusted representatives to send it to reward the disaster children. Their kindness is truly commendable. Other well-wishers such as Shenbao News Agency, Wanshixing Rice Crisp Factory, Mrs. Yu Zhizhai, Mrs. Mao Kelun, Mrs. Xie Hou, Mrs. Cai, Wu Linda, Wang, Wu, Lin, etc., also brought a large number of clothes, candies, and rice crisps, etc., to be distributed at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Cooperativization of the Civilian Bank</h3>
<p>The Civilian Bank, initiated by Liu Zhi, Min Tianpei, Mao Beihou, Hu Siyi, Xiong Yuxi, Huang Jiemin, Mao Xianghou, etc., is organized based on the principles of credit cooperatives. It opens up a precedent for the cooperativization of banks in our country, providing a foundation for the socio-economy of the civilians and removing the obstacles of capitalism's invasion of civilians. The preparatory office was set up earlier at No. 165 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession of this port. Mr. Min and Mr. Mao returned to Gan Province and met with Mr. Huang Jiemin, who had arrived in the province earlier, to host a banquet at the Jiangxi Hotel to invite leaders from all walks of life in Jiangxi and giants from the industrial and financial circles to discuss the establishment of the Jiangxi branch of the Civilian Bank. The amount of shares was determined on the spot to be about 300,000 yuan. Now Mr. Mao has returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. He is rushing to set up the head office in Shanghai and has been busy looking for a location for the office. Mr. Zhu immediately plans to start a cooperative weekly magazine, which will be organized by Mao Zhuanghou, a former reporter of Shishi Xinbao, to awaken the people's sympathy for the cooperative cause.</p>
<h3>The Bestial Behavior of the Guanlong Man</h3>
<p>A Poor Young Girl Suffers</p>
<p>Chen Di, a woman from Suzhou, lives at No. 1107, Tongle Lane, Dagu Road. She has a daughter named Alin, who is 12 years old. At 7:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, Chen went out for something, and Alin was playing alone in the lane. Chen Aihai (34 years old), a doorman from Taicang, saw that Alin was honest and thought he could be deceived, so he suddenly had lewd thoughts. He lured Alin to the gatehouse, pulled off her underwear, and raped her. At that time, Alin's nanny happened to call Alin for dinner. Later, she saw Alin walking down from the gatehouse, tidying up her underwear, and with tears on her face, so she went upstairs to check and saw that Chen was also putting on his pants, so she became suspicious and asked Alin about the rape. She reported to Chen Di and then reported to the Xinzha Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Chen Aihai and sent Chen Alin to the hospital for examination. It was confirmed that she had been raped. He has been sent to the hospital. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court. According to the lawyer of the police station, Wang Yaotang, he is now prosecuting the defendant for rape under Article 240 of the Criminal Law and requesting severe punishment. According to Chen Di and Chen Alin's report, they informed the court of the situation. The defendant's confession was ambiguous. After Judge Wu Tingqi examined the confession, he sentenced Chen Aihai to seven years of imprisonment for the crime of raping a girl under the age of sixteen. The number of days of detention before the final judgment was offset at a rate of two days for one day.</p>
<h3>Suicide Under the Pressure of Life</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Hu Wanzhang</p>
<p>Hu Wanzhang, a 43-year-old man from Jiangbei, worked as a rickshaw puller. He lived at No. 22, Zhengquan Lane, Anna Jin Road, French Concession. Hu was always worried that the income from pulling a rickshaw every day was not enough to support his wife and children. In addition, there were frequent floods in Jiangbei this year, and the victims were everywhere. The agricultural harvest was zero. In anger, he suddenly had the idea of death and hanged himself in the room when people were unprepared. At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, he was found dead. People reported to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Examination Office. Today, he reported to the Second Special District Court for examination.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Apprentices to Death</h3>
<p>Jiang Qiaogui's Methods Were Cruel</p>
<p>Gao Zhongyuan Died Tragically</p>
<p>Gao Baotong's son, Gao Zhongyuan, 16 years old, from Jingjiang, was introduced to Jiang Qiaogui's coppersmith shop at No. 157, Yanhai Road, Shanghai City, in March this year as an apprentice. However, Jiang treated the apprentices very abusively. On the 20th of last month, because Gao Zhongyuan's work was slow and his nature was clumsy, Jiang Qiaogui was furious and beat him with a cane, causing his fingers to break and his body to be injured. After the apprentice was injured, he had chills and fever, but Jiang still treated him like cattle and horses and did not provide medical treatment, forcing him to continue to work as usual, which led to his death three days later. Jiang bought a coffin and hastily collected the body. Gao Baotong, the father of the deceased, learned that his son had died and rushed to Shanghai. According to the apprentices in the same shop, he filed a complaint with the local court, requesting redress. Prosecutor Wu was ordered to summon Jiang Qiaogui to court, order him to be detained, and order the family of the deceased to transport the coffin to the court for examination. Yesterday morning, the father of the deceased transported the coffin to the court. At the medical examination office, the two examiners Shen and Xuan and the forensic doctor opened the coffin for examination. As a result, his fingers were indeed broken and there were injuries on his buttocks. However, the cause of death was still due to illness. It was determined that he died from illness after the injury. The family was instructed to collect the body and wait for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Grand Alliance Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>

(2) For national goods factories that have imported Japanese goods raw materials after September 20, if there are indeed奸商 behaviors, their factories should be punished and the staff should not be detained. (3) The wrongly detained national goods products should be returned within a week to avoid accidental losses. (4) When there are doubts about national goods products, the Anti-Japanese Association and this association will jointly organize a National Goods Review Committee to review them.</p>
<h3>District Party Headquarters Appeals</h3>
<p>Citizens, Pay Attention to the Development of the Current Situation</p>
<p>The First and Second District Party Headquarters of this city yesterday issued a declaration regarding the current situation. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>First District Party Headquarters: National crisis is imminent. Only by seeking peaceful unification can we save ourselves from peril. This is the general sentiment of the people, who hope for its speedy realization. Therefore, the Central Government, disregarding grievances, sought comprehensive reconciliation. Representatives from Guangdong Province discussed specific plans for internal stability and external resistance in Shanghai to achieve peaceful unification. They scheduled a meeting in Nanjing to convene the Fourth National Congress, resolving to adopt as much as possible the various proposals discussed in Shanghai, aiming for sincere unity to resist foreign aggression. Unexpectedly, Guangdong Province initially did not follow the original agreement to convene a simultaneous meeting. Then, after convening two meetings, they announced an adjournment, ultimately overturning the resolutions of the Shanghai meeting, destroying the prospects for peace. Like foxes burying and digging up their own tracks, they went back on their words, creating unnecessary complications. It is evident they have ulterior motives. They do not realize the foreign threat is deepening daily, and national demise is imminent. Even wielding weapons to defend against aggression is insufficient. What is the purpose of turning one's head and acting emotionally? Now, Longjiang has fallen, and Jinzhou is in danger. Foreign aggression is intensifying. Anyone with a conscience should weigh the priorities, quickly seek remedies, and transform internal conflict into external defense, lest everything be destroyed in an instant. If they continue to act emotionally, engaging in petty disputes and undermining the great cause of unification, betraying the expectations of the nation, they will mislead the country and the Party, and they alone will bear the responsibility. May our people take note of this. Declaration by the First District Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party in Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<p>Second District Party Headquarters: Since the successful conclusion of the Shanghai Peace Conference, the people of the entire nation have had a new perspective. We believed that this could concentrate the forces for resisting Japan and saving the nation, rescuing the country and its people from imminent danger. Subsequently, the Central Government, in accordance with the resolutions of the peace conference, convened the Fourth National Congress. All resolutions fully implemented what had been agreed upon at the Shanghai Peace Conference. We deeply believed that the Central Government's comprehensive approach could gain the sympathy of both sides, realizing the grand aspiration of sincere unity to face the national crisis together. Unexpectedly, the Fourth National Congress of Guangdong Province was repeatedly postponed. When it finally convened, it overturned the resolutions of the Peace Preparatory Committee. Due to complex factions and divergent opinions, more than a hundred representatives left Guangzhou for Hong Kong. The Fourth National Congress of Guangdong Province was effectively dissolved. Our Central Government, with utmost tolerance and countless compromises, sought to complete the great task of unification. If they had even a little conscience, they should have abandoned past grievances, striving to resist foreign aggression, so as not to betray the expectations of the people. Yet, they insisted that the number of Central Committee members was insufficient for their personal control, recklessly engaging in perverse actions, going back on their words, directly undermining peace, and willingly becoming mouthpieces for foreign invaders. We have been shouting ourselves hoarse, appealing for peace, only to find a glimmer of hope being cut off by Guangdong Province. Let alone their betrayal of the Central Government's painstaking efforts, this has fueled the enemy's arrogance, dispersed the forces for resisting Japan and saving the nation, allowing the beautiful land to be trampled upon by the enemy, and causing disruptions in foreign affairs. The authorities in Guangdong Province cannot escape their responsibility for betraying the country and its people. Recently, Mr. Hu Hanmin has gone to Guangdong to mediate. We only hope that they will implement the pre-conference decisions faithfully. If, unfortunately, they still choose a dead end, we can only hope that the loyal comrades in Guangdong will resolutely go to the capital to participate in the National Crisis Conference and resist foreign aggression together. This is a way to save the country and save themselves. Declaration by the Second District Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party in Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<h3>Lawyers' Association</h3>
<p>Reply to Letters from the Postal Workers' Unions</p>
<p>Regarding Three Lawyers Defending the Yu Case</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association replied yesterday to letters from the Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union, saying: "In direct response, on November 14th, we received your union's letter requesting that we warn and punish lawyers Zhang Yaozeng, Sha Xunyi, and Zhu Shaowen for defending the Yu case. On the 17th, we received a joint letter from more than twenty unions affiliated with your Postal Workers' Union, with similar requests. We have carefully read and understood both letters.</p>
<p>The Baoshan Road tragedy should, of course, be dealt with severely according to the law. Your union's patriotic enthusiasm is deeply admirable. However, your letter's severe criticism of the three lawyers, Zhang, Sha, and Zhu, for acting as defense counsel, is perhaps based on a misunderstanding. It is the duty of this association to safeguard the judiciary, and we must explain this to your union in detail. Punishing without trial and denying the right to defense in trials were ills of the Dark Ages. The peoples of various nations, for the sake of humanity and freedom, struggled and revolted repeatedly before establishing the two major principles: punishment must be preceded by trial, and trials must allow for defense. These are the most precious achievements in revolutionary history. Our country's Code of Criminal Procedure adopts these principles. All defendants have the right to choose defense counsel. Defendants facing serious charges (those carrying a minimum sentence of five years or more and cases under the jurisdiction of the High Court for first instance) cannot be tried without defense counsel. If a defendant does not choose defense counsel, the court must appoint one on its behalf. The legal provisions are clear and well-known (Articles 165, 170, and 171 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). Therefore, under the law, the more serious the crime, such as treason (commonly known as rebellion), crimes against foreign states (commonly known as selling out the country), and uxoricide, not only can the defendant not be deprived of the benefit of defense, but, for the sake of special caution, defense is mandatory (Article 171). This is where the important spirit of lawyers lies, and it is an indispensable procedure in legal proceedings. If there were such cases without anyone to defend them, a formal court would be unable to conduct a lawful trial. Your union seems to think that Yu Bolu's offense is so serious that no one should defend him. This is because you have not fully understood the aforementioned legal provisions and their underlying spirit. The law recognizes the importance of the defense system and specifically assigns lawyers to this task (Article 166). Defense is a power granted to lawyers by law and a responsibility that lawyers owe to the law. Under the law, any defendant is entitled to defense, and lawyers have a duty to defend any crime. The law mandates defense for serious crimes, so lawyers cannot arbitrarily avoid defending serious crimes. Lawyers acting as defense counsel are simply fulfilling their duty, striving to discover the truth through lawful trials, not protecting criminals in the way that the worldly call 'covering up for lawsuits.' If defending a certain crime means that the lawyer sympathizes with the criminal and assists evildoers, then the establishment of lawyers by law would be solely for the purpose of promoting crime, which is certainly not the case. Lawyers Zhang, Sha, and Zhu are acting as Yu's defense counsel in accordance with the law, and there is nothing improper about their actions. It is purely a matter of professional duty. Yu is suspected of murder and is being prosecuted by the prosecutor's office, which is separate from the actions of traitorous merchants sanctioned by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and does not conflict with the resolutions of this conference. Your union is motivated by patriotic sincerity and attaches special importance to the Baoshan Road tragedy. This association expresses its utmost sympathy. However, judicial independence is the foundation of a nation. Since the case is being handled by the court according to law, the public can only wait for the trial and hope for a fair outcome. This association, in its capacity, respectfully offers these humble words for your understanding."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Proposes Amending the Yangjingbang Regulations</p>
<p>Intends to Seek Opinions at the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council announced that at the board meeting on the 25th, they considered a proposal to add two Chinese real estate committee members. The Chairman said that amending the Yangjingbang Regulations requires a special meeting of ratepayers, but it is feared that it would be difficult to reach the legally required quorum. A director suggested that if that is the case, it might be possible to seek opinions at the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting without formally proposing a motion to amend the Yangjingbang Regulations. If there are no objections, it seems appropriate to seek the necessary consent from the Consular Body. After discussion by the directors, it was decided to adopt this method because there were no other proposals that required calling a special meeting. In addition, it was resolved to agree to the Jianghai Customs and Shanghai Municipal Government's consultation on exempting disaster relief goods from wharfage dues.</p>
<h3>City Federation District Branches</h3>
<p>Telegraph to Chen Mingshu to Assume Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation's district branches telegraphed General Chen Zhenru, urging him to promptly assume the post of Garrison Commander of Songhu to safeguard Songhu and reassure the people, defending the national territory. (Original text abbreviated)</p>
<h3>Chinese Tobacco Factories</h3>
<p>Letter Requesting Resolution of Printing Dispute</p>
<p>Letter to the Tobacco Factories Association</p>
<p>To the Chinese Tobacco Factories Association: We recently received letters from more than ten tobacco factories, including Zhongnan, Minzhong, Sanxing, and Zhonghe, stating: "In direct response, we have received your association's letter regarding the printing case of the San Yi Company, awaiting resolution, etc. Our company has some printing done by San Yi. Now that your association has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the company, we hope you will clarify the true situation so that we can follow it." After investigation, our association sent Shen Weiting, Wu Peiyin, and Zhang Xihua to the company for on-site investigation. Afterwards, they reported: "Respectfully informing, Di Ting, etc., went to the San Yi Company for investigation on the morning of the 5th of this month. We respectfully report the situation recorded in the company's books as follows: (1) Capital: The company's total capital is 200,000 yuan, divided into 10,000 shares, each share at 20 yuan. There are 78 shareholders, all of whom are Chinese. The registration has been approved and all employees are Chinese. (2) Raw materials: The company stopped purchasing raw materials from Japanese sources after August 17 and switched to purchasing from foreign firms such as Tenney, Moffett &amp; Co., and Yi Ji Datongyuan, etc. (3) Printed items: The company's previously contracted printed items with Japanese printing companies were completely finished by October 20. We hereby submit this report for your review." Secret agents Hong Huiqian and Shi Xingsheng were also secretly sent to investigate whether Jin Youcheng and the China Rubber Printing Company had resigned and how they had closed down. Afterwards, they reported: "Respectfully informing, Huiqian, etc., were dispatched on the 8th of this month to secretly investigate Jin Youcheng's formal resignation from the China Rubber Printing Company and the circumstances of the closure. We respectfully report the situation as follows: Jin Youcheng formally resigned from the China Rubber Printing Company in writing on October 3. All handled matters were completely finished and handed over clearly within three weeks. We hereby submit this confidential report." According to this investigation, all the capital of the San Yi Printing Company is Chinese and there is no foreign capital involved. The raw materials used have stopped purchasing Japanese goods since August 17, and the printing items that were contracted were completely finished by October 20. Therefore, the San Yi Printing Company has no relationship with the China Rubber Company. As for Jin Youcheng himself, he has resigned and severed ties with the China Rubber Company and completed the handover clearly. We have compiled a detailed letter reporting the true situation before and after the investigation, and we hope you will review it. It seems that the dispute over the San Yi Printing Company can be resolved after your association's clear and thorough investigation, learning of the true situation. However, we have heard that among fellow businesses, such as Hua Cheng and Hua Da, the cigarette companies' cigarette boxes are printed by San Yi and are being transported to Guangdong for sale. They are mistakenly identified as Japanese goods and are being detained. The occurrence of this case is due to the correspondence between the Shanghai Color Printing Industry and the San Yi Company, which is inconsistent with the facts, causing misunderstandings and disputes. Now, for the sake of avoiding obstacles in the business operations of fellow businesses, we should ask your association to mediate so that the opinions of both parties can eliminate misunderstandings, and fellow businesses will not be hindered as a result. Correspondingly, this letter is sent to you, and we hope that your association will investigate and handle it."</p>

<h3>News About Mr. Huang Bowen</h3>
<p>Broadly Solicit Patriotic Funds Exclusively for Military Expenses Against Japan</p>
<p>Ever since the Japanese occupied our three eastern provinces, patriotic people have been surging with fervor. Some committed suicide, some ran about appealing, some donated money, some requested military intervention. The commotion has lasted two months now, and the Japanese are still advancing daily. However, we have not heard of the government taking any military action to resist the enemy. The reasons for the delay in deploying troops are two things we must pay attention to: first, military pay; second, armaments. Whether armaments can be sufficiently supplied is unknown to us, but military pay must be far from adequate. Therefore, I propose that our 400 million compatriots cooperate to donate patriotic funds. Every person should donate one month's salary, that is, one-twelfth of their annual income, as the standard. Capitalists should use their monthly income as the standard, farmers should use one-twelfth of their annual agricultural income as the standard, and women and students should use their disposable allowance as the standard. Each should deposit in a designated bank in their own name. Regardless of wealth, everyone must donate and deposit in twelve monthly installments. With this method, tens of millions of military expenses can be obtained readily. The people will not become poor as a result, and the country will become rich. These military expenses should be managed by a separate committee to supervise their use, solely for military expenses against Japan and not for any other purpose. If this war can be avoided through fortune, then the funds should be used to purchase warships and build fortresses, entirely for national defense. If all sectors deem this feasible, please ask each chamber of commerce and each labor union to promptly organize and substantially assist the government in deploying troops; otherwise, running about appealing will be of no avail.</p>
<p>(Reply) China belongs to 400 million people. To save it from peril, those with wealth should contribute wealth, those with strength should contribute strength, those with wisdom should contribute wisdom, and those with skills should contribute skills. Your idea is excellent. It is hoped that you will gather comrades and start by putting it into practice yourself. When you have gathered a number of comrades, then jointly initiate it, and the response will surely be widespread.</p>

<h3>An Inscription for National Salvation, in the Style of "The Humble Abode Inscription"</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhixin</p>
<p>Troops need not be many, but disciplined and elite. A country need not be weak, but determined and prosperous. We hate those Japanese bandits, who inflict endless pain on us. Now they have occupied the eastern provinces and are disturbing Tianjin. A generous reward awaits the brave, and self-strengthening eliminates the cowardly. This can boost the morale of the people and repel the Japanese army. There is no need to fear defeat or lack of weapons. The past of Turkey and the fame of Germany serve as examples. Compatriots say, what is there to fear? (Move to reward and support the horse.)</p>
<p>We do not eliminate the weeds in the courtyard, only discuss matters of state.</p>
<h3>Dialogue Before the God of War (1)</h3>
<p>"Japan has already forcibly seized the three eastern provinces and is now advancing on Jinzhou, while also bombarding Tianjin, aiming to occupy Beiping, to achieve its conspiracy to annex China. How should we respond?"</p>
<p>"Fight! Fight! Fight!"</p>
<p>"You advocate non-killing, so why do you advocate war?"</p>
<p>"The definition of non-killing is: (1) I must not kill people; (2) I must not kill myself; (3) People must not kill me; (4) People must not kill people. Advocating war is to use force to stop the Japanese from slaughtering when fair and peaceful means are hopeless, which means not allowing people to kill me!"</p>
<p>"Without money or bullets, how can we fight?"</p>
<p>"Where did the money come from for the civil wars of the past twenty years? Where did the bullets come from?"</p>
<p>"Having money and bullets without brave soldiers is also not enough to fight."</p>
<p>"Learning to fight is to learn on the battlefield. Chinese soldiers are tempered on the battlefield. Few Japanese soldiers have been on the battlefield. The Japanese soldiers who were tempered on the battlefield of the Russo-Japanese War are almost all dead, and those who are not dead are too old to fight. China has soldiers who are not afraid of death; what is painful is that there are too many military officers who are afraid of death!"</p>
<p>"Why are Chinese military officers afraid of death?"</p>
<p>"Have you seen the elephants of the Indian Rajahs in newsreels? They are covered with gold and silver treasures, so their movements are not very convenient. Many Chinese military officers are not only 'covered in gold,' but also have three wives and four concubines, indulging in pleasure day and night, unable to extricate themselves, unwilling to extricate themselves, so how can they be willing to die?"</p>
<p>"If these degenerates are not eliminated, how can we fight?"</p>
<p>"When war breaks out with Japan, some of these people will lay down their butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot, while others will naturally transfer their money to foreign banks and take their wives and concubines to the concessions to live out their lives. The brave, upright, and loyal military generals will surely rush forward like lively dragons and tigers to replace them. When the Black Army resisted, Wan Guobin fled, and Ma Zhanshan rose like the sun from the east. Isn't this irrefutable evidence?"</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Nanhu</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Nanhu built a villa west of the Jing'an Temple in Shanghai, called "Little Wanliu Hall." The plaque was written by Taozhai Duanfang. The structure is exceptionally beautiful. Although it lacks the charm of mountains, rocks, flowers, and trees, its naming is taken from Yuan Lian Xixian, and its ambition can be known.</p>
<p>His wife came from a prominent Tongcheng family and was skilled in calligraphy. She was a Wenji of today. Her brushwork was based on the style of Lingfei, but lean and firm with spirit. Her signature was "Wu Zhiying, a woman from Tongcheng," which was from her early years. Nanhu studied for the imperial examinations in his prime. In the Jiawu year, he passed the autumn examinations and ranked tenth. At that time, the Sino-Japanese War had just ended, and the examiner used the line "The general's dragon flag sweeps the sea clouds" as the poem topic to encourage the morale of the eastern expedition. The last two lines of Nanhu's original paper were "His spirit swallows the Japanese islands, and his name is inscribed in the Fubo army," as if describing today's battle of Longjiang. Yesterday, my old friend Mr. Qin recited this to confirm my belief. I did not expect that more than thirty years later, this prophecy would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Nanhu loved fame. Therefore, after the female knight Qiu Jin from Shanyin and Wu Luzhen were assassinated, their epitaphs and biographies were all written by Mrs. Wu, hoping to leave a lasting legacy, and were inscribed at West Lake. Later, Censor Chang Hui submitted a memorial to the throne to protest this. The court heard of it and leveled their graves. The stone tablets were thus destroyed. Mrs. Wu was spared only through the efforts of the American female missionary Maidmed, and Nanhu was also very afraid. He then presented the Shurangama Sutra handwritten by his wife to the Jiang Governor, and only then was he relieved. The remains of the female knight were then moved from Zhejiang to Hunan. She firmly protested, but ultimately could not resist. When the Qing dynasty fell, they were reburied at Xiling, and Nanhu played a significant role in this.</p>
<p>Nanhu traveled to Japan, although he was very down and out, he became very fond of a young maid named Haruno. However, his relationship with his wife became estranged, and he did not send a single message to Shanghai for several months to inquire about her well-being. When he returned to China, it was after the National Revolutionary Army had arrived, and the political situation had been cleansed. His fellow villager Wu Jingheng, seeing that educational funding lacked management, urged the authorities to give him this position. Nanhu heard this and said, "This is trapping me. I am not familiar with auditing, so what will I do?" Later, he reluctantly took the position, but resigned after less than three months and went to the old capital. It is now heard that he died in a temple in the middle of the month. His wife was also unable to attend the funeral due to illness. Alas, our Jiangnan has lost another famous scholar.</p>
<h3>The Liaoning Crane Returns with Many Bloody Tears</h3>
<p>— Liupu</p>
<p>My old friend Mr. He Mengqiao is from Jiangnan. In the past, he went to Shenyang to do business. Recently, due to the Japanese invasion, he returned to the south with his entire family. Yesterday, I met him in Yingyu, so I inquired about the situation in the north. Mr. He sighed with sorrow and indignation. He immediately said, "Why do you ask? In short, the Northeast has become a world for non-humans."</p>
<p>After a while, he continued, "Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have seen that our authorities adhere to a policy of non-resistance, and they know that weakness is easy to exploit. Therefore, they rely on their armed forces to burn, loot, and act violently and recklessly, leaving no extreme unused. Slaughtering Chinese people is easier than slaughtering chickens. Shooting the innocent is the same as butchering sheep. Let me tell you about several incidents that I personally know and saw with my own eyes, and you will be shocked and terrified. Since the Japanese occupied Shenyang, they have been searching every day, ostensibly to search for our military and political figures, but in reality, they are looting at will to satisfy their desires. There was a middle-class family with a beautiful young widow whose infant was just over seven months old. The widow loved the child and could not bear to abandon him because he was her only descendant. When soldiers came, she would comfort him and hide him in a pile of firewood. Unexpectedly, this led to a great disaster. When the Japanese soldiers entered the house and searched repeatedly without finding anything, they were about to leave in disappointment when a babbling sound suddenly came from a secluded place. The Japanese bandits knew their plan and followed the sound to search exhaustively. The widow was captured. The Japanese bandits grumbled angrily, seemingly blaming her for not avoiding and hiding. The widow leaned against her cloud-like hair, tears welling up in her eyes, her face as white as paper, trembling incessantly. Four or five Japanese soldiers laughed and talked, successively subjecting her to humiliation. Finally, they threw the infant into the air, causing him to fall on the steps and have his head shattered. Alas, what kind of world is this!"</p>
<p>"My friend Mr. Zhang worked in silk. He had a son named Maomao, who was very clever. Although he was only six years old, he was so witty and lively that he was rarely seen in the world. He had been studying at a nearby primary school since spring and knew many words. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang loved him very much. Since the sudden change in the situation, people from all walks of life have been wary. Mr. Zhang had also stayed indoors for several days. Then, Maomao suddenly sneaked out and saw Japanese soldiers on horseback. He was frightened and wanted to return, but was spotted by a Japanese policeman who forcibly dragged him away. Mr. Zhang did not know this. When he found out, the blood in front of the door was still fresh, and the child's body was lying there. Alas, what crime did the child commit to suffer such a brutal murder? Savage bestiality has never been seen in ancient times, but it is being re-enacted in today's civilized world. It is truly a pain and shame for humanity." Mr. He had not finished speaking when tears streamed down his face.</p>
<p>"Compatriots, does this not stir something within you? In a dark age and a dark world, only blood can pierce through the dawn and emit its glow. I hope that our people will strive for it."</p>
<h3>Reading Mr. Fenweng's Calligraphy and Seal Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Tingbingsheng</p>
<p>Deng Zi Fenweng is also an eccentric of the present age. He is fond of drinking wine and never stops until he is drunk, as if there is a surging energy in his chest that must be released through the wine jug. Therefore, he rolls up his sleeves and creates bold, decorative characters, concentrating his energy and spirit, like a general drawing his sword or a strongman lifting a tripod. But if you carefully observe and savor it, you will see delicate and charming intentions hidden in every hook and stroke. On the first day of the calligraphy and seal exhibition, I also squeezed into the crowd to read his works carefully. I felt that his collection of Su Shi's large seal characters, "We two or three people, Jiangnan has thousands of peaks," was uninhibited and heroic, shaking people's hearts. It can be compared with those who meticulously copy the full text of Marquis Qi's bell inscription in four-foot bronze vessels, both of which are difficult to achieve. For modern people to imitate the ancients is only to resemble them in appearance, without grasping the essence of their spirit. Mr. Weng's small hanging scroll No. 10, which depicts the Song of Watching the Sunrise on Buddha's Peak, was written by Mr. Weng during his visit to Putuo this year. When he showed me the first draft upon his return, I praised it for its oddity and charm. Now, after slightly altering a few characters and presenting it in small regular script, it feels like the writing complements each other even better. Therefore, I purchased it first and will hang it in my humble studio for appreciation morning and night. Isn't this fate? Mr. Weng studied under Mr. Zhao Guni of Yushan, so he deeply understood the methods of seal carving and possessed a vast and unrestrained spirit, which can be compared to that of Wu Changshuo and surpass the Zhejiang and Anhui schools. Therefore, his collection of historical couplets, "Stone tiger sea foam bird" and "Mountain Tao Pavilion Dao Niu," has a postscript in which he says that he uses the method of seal carving to write seal characters, and the method of writing seal characters to carve seals. Can someone who is not deeply versed in the arts utter such a phrase? Although Mr. Weng is rejected by the times, he is also concerned about current events. His cursive script couplet, "Still there is an eave to lodge swallows, how can there be no half grain to reach pond fish?"</p>
<p>seems to be written out of sympathy for the flood disaster. So Mr. Weng is also a person with heart. What I call eccentric is like those in Xiangyang and Dongye who are not encountered by the world, and their movements and actions are therefore strikingly different from those of the times, isn't it?</p>
<p>World Small Events</p>
<p>According to recent Western newspapers:</p>
<p>A major newspaper in Berlin, the German capital,</p>
<p>suggested: During this Japanese invasion of the northeastern region of China, Commander Zhang Xueliang of the Army, Navy, and Air Force maintained a policy of non-resistance and painstakingly preserved peace. Therefore, it is proposed to award the Nobel Peace Prize for the next term to Mr. Zhang. Is this flattering our country or insulting our country? Please, countrymen, examine your hearts and think about it. Also, I don't know whether Mr. Zhang will accept the Peace Prize if they really award it to him.</p>
<p>Lord D'Aberdeen, a former British ambassador to Germany, has a strange habit. Whenever he encounters important matters, he often uses a pencil to write them down on his cuff to avoid forgetting. But he still forgets. He is always fussing about losing his memo. His staff is used to it and always has to rush him to the laundry to get the unwashed cuff back.</p>
<p>In Liverpool, England, there is a new cinema that shows sound films. To accommodate deaf audiences, it is equipped with special hearing aids. When deaf people enter the cinema, they only need to tell the usher, and the hearing aid will be delivered immediately, free of charge. It can be attached to the chair when not in use, which is very convenient.</p>
<h3>Magnificent Literature (4)</h3>
<p>— Tianyou</p>
<p>Alas, after the literary figures' embellishment, it is felt that this kind of "tiger's head and snake's tail," "five-minute heat," and "can talk but cannot act" "Taiwan appearance" is very shameful. But weren't our anti-Japanese incidents in the years of 59 and 53 all brave at the beginning and cowardly at the end? Today, volunteer armies are being established everywhere. Will this kind of "Taiwan appearance" not appear? I am really pinching a handful of sweat with fear and trepidation.</p>
<p>Gong Du made twenty-four military songs in total. Eight of them are departure songs, saying how lovely China is and how it has been oppressed by the powers in recent days. They are mostly set against the background of the Eight-Nation Alliance entering Beijing in the Gengzi year. They say, "A sick man and a sleeping man cannot make a country, but must be enslaved. Revenge and retribution are today. Must. Must. Must." Eight of them are return songs, saying how unequal treaties will be abolished after the victory. There is no need to cite them now. But there is one that says, "Black Mountain Green Forest Red Eyebrows, rebels are not counted as bandits. Engraving Qiang breaking Hu and destroying Di, although brave, are small enemies. To fight an enemy, fight a great power. Country. Country. Country." Using this kind of reasoning to comment on today's military leaders, they are improper internally and non-resistant externally. "Brave in private fights, cowardly in public battles," contrary to the patriotic spirit of the Qin people. "Seeing small enemies brave, seeing great enemies cowardly," lacking the attitude of Guangwu facing the enemy. Comparing the two, how can they not be ashamed to death? The most magnificent are those eight songs in the army. Let's record them all here for "sharing wonderful articles together." (Using "fight to the death and move forward, resist horizontally and vertically" as rhyme, and the "braids" and "yellow dragon" flag in the sentences are slightly different from the current situation.)</p>
<p>Noble Noble Noble good man. It is best to die on the battlefield. Moxibustion on the eyebrows and gourds bursting on the nose, who can really escape death? Death is only once, do not waste it. Die. Die. Die.</p>
<p>Mother pulling at my clothes, secretly sewing the thread, telling me not to covet merit. My wife hugging my head, replacing the braids, on the verge of leaving, pointing at my face, "What face will you have to see me again if you return in defeat?" Fight. Fight. Fight.</p>
<p>The halberd gate suddenly opens and the thunderous drums sound, killing the bandits, the gods lead the way. The enemy front calls for beheading the general, capturing the king makes the hands itch even more. I go straight to a thousand or ten thousand people. Move forward. Move forward. Move forward.</p>
<p>Exploring the cave, first explore the tiger's den, what is dangerous and difficult? Attacking the city, first attack the firm gold city, who can procrastinate? Horses grind horse ears, people grind shoulders. Forward. Forward. Forward.</p>
<p>Bullets stir up rain, blades whirl like wind, blood splashes on the red expedition clothes. The enemy army was stationed yesterday, a thousand retired bears, today the camp is empty. Ten thousand flags are the same color, yellow dragon. Move vertically. Move vertically. Move vertically.</p>
<p>High-rise construction of a surrender city, the generals all kneel. The surrendered slaves take off their swords and bow, the chanyu neck is tied with a rope. Drums and musical instruments sound everywhere. Move horizontally. Move horizontally. Move horizontally.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of bald heads entangled in black ropes, how many Rong slaves are bound? Scarlet cross hanging on oil cloth, Yi are wounded everywhere. Military orders are like mountains, forbidding brutality. Do not. Do not. Do not.</p>
<p>Do not like the tiger-headed appearance of being ennobled, cast as statues of meritorious officials. Do not like the Yanzhan stele of a hundred feet, showing someone's general. What is liked is that the military's power dares to resist. Resist. Resist. Resist.</p>

<h3>A Country Bumpkin Visits Shanghai Again (31)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>"Ah! They are here to solicit donations!" The country bumpkin had some enlightenment. But why did he bring that clapper? Is this learning from the monks who knock on the clapper to beg for alms?</p>
<p>"Soliciting donations is soliciting donations, but what's the use of bringing this thing?" The country bumpkin couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"This is a bamboo tube," the female student in a blue long shirt with her hair cut straight said lightly to him.</p>
<p>"I also know that it is a bamboo tube, but what are you using that bamboo tube for?" What the country bumpkin was curious about was that thing.</p>
<p>"This is for donating money. The donated money, whether banknotes, foreign money, jiaozi, or copper coins, is all stuffed inside. It can only be put in and cannot be taken out. And it is best for the person donating the money to put it in themselves. To take it out, you have to split the bamboo tube open, and then you can take it out. This is also to show that you can't hide the donated money in your own pockets." Another student explained the reason for using the bamboo tube.</p>
<p>"That's right." The country bumpkin expressed his approval. "In the past, I saw many people who辦relief were called great benefactors, great benefactors. He was originally a poor wretch, but after办relief for several years, he suddenly became rich. I also did not investigate his relief agency, whether it was actually beneficial? Did it have no benefit? He himself became a rich man. People sent him a plaque with the four large characters "Good people are rich." I also suspected that the money people donated went into his own pockets? Now you have to break open the bamboo tube before you can take it out, which is just like the savings jar we use in the countryside."</p>
<p>The country bumpkin was very happy at this time, and he used his hand to lift their bamboo tube and said:</p>
<p>"It's very light, I'm afraid you didn't solicit much money, did you?"</p>
<p>"The amount of money donated has nothing to do with the weight of the bamboo tube." A female student looked at the country bumpkin and smiled again.</p>
<p>"What's the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"Look! We have two bamboo tubes here. One is relatively light and one is relatively heavy, but when we split open the bamboo tubes to look, the light one had more money donated, while the heavy one had less money donated. This is because there are several banknotes in the light one; in the heavy one, there is only a large handful of silver coins and copper coins. So we say that you can't tell how much money has been donated by the weight."</p>
<p>The country bumpkin suddenly realized, and he rummaged for a long time in a bag next to his side and took out a Yuan head silver dollar and said solemnly:</p>
<p>"Good! Good! I will also donate a dollar."</p>

<p>The Gold Market is Thriving</p>
<p>Breaking Through 70 Taels Externally Yesterday, the bidding for gold saw another superior performance, with a complex situation. From morning to noon, it hovered around 670 taels, making the trend difficult to grasp. There was a difference of 14 taels in total. The trend among traders seemed firm, and the final unified calculation showed a rise of more than 6 taels. The opening was a slight rise, probably due to the divergent trend in the silver market, with London rising and New York falling. Subsequently, there was a slight setback. Afterwards, major firms such as Hengxing made efforts to resist the shorts, and although foreign exchange rose, the domestic market was stable, with a secret bullish trend. Traders slightly sold, so the gold market soared, once breaking through 670 taels. However, the sellers did not relent and turned to soft declines again. However, the ups and downs were erratic. Later, the market was closed on Saturday, and it was found that the state was chaotic this week. At the beginning of the week, it fell to 654 taels, and later found a new high price of 685 taels. As a result, at 70 taels, there was a review of more than 30 taels, an increase of about 11 taels compared with last Saturday. Here is a record of yesterday's market situation,</p>
<p>Gradual Increase of Six and a Half Taels The early opening was a slight increase of 7 qian, to 663 taels and 5 qian. The large bar had risen by 16 fen. The silver price fell by 1/8, and private telegrams increased by 1/16. However, the cheap sales in the United States had no impact. Subsequently, due to sales by Wanxing, Shunli, Hengyu, etc., it immediately retreated to 60 taels and 02 qian. In a short time, Hengxing, Yuankangxiang, Hengchangyong, Tongtaichang, etc. came to buy, and because the US dollar was gradually tight, the bank initially absorbed 33 yuan and 0625, and then only calculated 32 yuan and 8125, resulting in a thriving trend, a sharp rise of more than 10 taels, had exceeded 70 taels, calculated as 71 taels and a half. London gold announced a rise of .75, and US gold also increased by .75, at 70 taels. However, Hengxing continued to advance, and the US dollar was more attractive. Mitsui entered at .6875, and after 9:30 it was 74 taels. At this time, Chengfengyong, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, Yuankangxiang, etc. took the opportunity to sell, and because Mitsui suddenly released February US gold .75, it was 69 taels and 8 qian close to 10 o'clock. Subsequently, there were more than 3 taels of ups and downs in half an hour, because the buying and selling were different. Hengxing continued to advance, and Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, etc. exited.

<h3>Exchange Rate Trends Between British and American Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British silver rose while the American silver fell. However, market conditions turned weak. The exchange rate between British and American currencies continued to decrease slightly. HSBC exchange rates were nearly three notches higher across the board. British gold added 0.75, reaching one shilling and nine and three-quarter pence. American gold also added 0.75, reaching 32 yuan. The Hong Kong rate decreased slightly by 0.125, to 76 taels 5 mace 6 li 2 hao 5 si. All other rates increased. However, the domestic market showed significant differences between British and American currencies. British gold started flat, then strengthened, softening slightly at midday. American gold seemed strong, fluctuating slightly. Ultimately, compared to the night before, British gold increased slightly by 0.125, while American gold decreased by 0.3125. This was due to the continuous decrease in exchange rates, a clear indication of a tightening trend, leading to a greater discrepancy in hedging. Because of this, people were adopting a wait-and-see approach, causing gold prices to rise slightly. Chinese merchants, including Fuchang and Hongli, sold tens of thousands of pounds of British gold, and various firms sold three to four hundred thousand yuan of American gold. Occasionally, a few purchases were made. Furthermore, dealers settled payments for imported goods that were due. The market closed in the afternoon due to it being Saturday, as per usual practice.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>A Recent View on Maintaining Bond Prices</p>
<p>Suspension of New Futures Trading</p>
<p>Spot Trading Still Conducted as Usual</p>
<p>In recent months, influenced by the Japanese invasion, the diplomatic situation has been</p>
<p>exceptionally severe. Securities prices have plummeted due to weakened public confidence and oversupply. Despite the efforts of the financial industry and various parties to maintain them, it has been difficult to reverse the downward trend. The decline has been particularly sharp in the past two weeks. The general financial market and general investors have been under significant pressure. Given this situation, if measures are not urgently taken to curb market prices, the economic future will be in extreme danger. The Ministry of Finance, aware of this, had already drafted emergency measures. The supervisors were instructed to relay to the Chinese Securities Exchange that all bonds are currently paying interest and repaying principal according to regulations, and that tax revenues are buoyant, so there is no reason for such a continuous price decline. Three measures were stipulated to show restrictions and instructed the Exchange to comply with them: (1) A standard price is set, using the closing price on the afternoon of November 24 as the minimum price. (2) When the bond price falls to the standard price, it will be calculated according to the standard price and cannot go lower. (3) Off-exchange transactions are illegal and absolutely prohibited. In light of the situation, the Exchange decided to temporarily suspend all new transactions in futures, focusing solely on settlements in order to await a rebound in market prices. A notice was issued in the Exchange market, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of this Exchange has decided to suspend all new futures trading from this date forward. Spot trading will continue as usual, but prices must comply with the Ministry's order, with the closing price on the 24th as the minimum limit. If existing December contracts are to be rolled over into January contracts, they will be treated as a swap between both parties, and the price will also be limited to not being below the same base price for this month as per the Ministry's order. Furthermore, various bonds mortgaged through this Exchange in September may be sold at the price limited by the Ministry, and the buyer may transfer the account at will. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>The closing prices and book prices for the December futures on November 24 are recorded again below for reference:</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Securities Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Significant Amount of Off-Exchange Transfer Transactions</p>
<p>Sparse Trading That Day, Prices Rise Slightly</p>
<p>January Delivery Date Set for Next Year</p>
<p>Yesterday (28th), the Chinese Securities Exchange, having completely suspended new trading in futures, granted the request of various brokers to transfer previous off-exchange transactions to the Exchange accounts, in order to facilitate orderly settlement. However, this was limited to the afternoon session yesterday, and no further transfers will be allowed. The transfer is a new transaction made by both parties to enter</p>
<p>collection. This transfer transaction was for a very large amount. Apart from the morning when the market was not open and various account matters were not processed, the afternoon session was not completed until 3:30. Statistics show that the total transfer amount for various bonds was 9,485,000 yuan, including 1,765,000 yuan for the Unified Tax, 1,395,000 yuan for the Salt Tax, 1,080,000 yuan for the 20th Customs, 1,600,500 yuan for the 1929 Philanthropic, 980,000 yuan for the 20th Consolidated, 1,035,000 yuan for Troop Reduction, 690,000 yuan for Disbandment, 575,000 yuan for the 1929 Customs, 135,000 yuan for Consolidated 6s, and 25,000 yuan for the 96 Public Bond. The market opened after 3:30. Both spot and futures trading were sparse. Spot trading amounted to 16,000 yuan, and futures trading totaled only 1,420,000 yuan. As for the trend of various bond prices, with the absolute restriction on selling transactions, allowing only settlement transactions, and the buying side free to buy, the market demand turned strong, and prices were raised by about one yuan. However, the few spot goods that had no recent transactions fell significantly. Looking at the future of the bond market, if the diplomatic situation does not deteriorate further, it seems that prices can be expected to gradually rise due to the restriction on new selling. The statistics on the high and low price fluctuations of various bonds in the afternoon session yesterday are listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Spot Yarn and Cotton on Delivery Day</h3>
<p>Futures yarn market closed, spot sales also quiet. Yarn and cloth extremely quiet, as overseas conditions are very weak. The violent Japanese disturbances in Tianjin are becoming increasingly treacherous, causing even greater public anxiety, making actual transactions even scarcer. Marked yarn will handle delivery procedures at the end of the month, market closed for one day. Merchant groups from Guangdong and inland merchants bought 200 bales, market conditions flat and weak.</p>
<p>Spot cotton exists but not sold. Cotton market very weak, no spot transactions. However, foreign cotton is increasingly weak. Sources estimate 850 bales of Yaohua cotton, 250 bales of Lower Sand cotton.</p>
<h3>Small Delivery Volume of Yarn This Month</h3>
<p>Only 150 Bales Actually Delivered</p>
<p>Market Situation for November Marked Yarn: Market conditions were still firm at the beginning of the month. Due to the violent Japanese occupation of Shenyang, the people were indignant, and the patriotic movement was enthusiastic, rejecting inferior goods. Sales of domestic yarn were very brisk, and inventories were low, so prices fluctuated around 60 taels. Later, as the violent Japanese disturbances in the Northeast intensified, financial conditions became increasingly tight, customer sales stagnated, and business became difficult to develop. All merchant groups lacked vitality, and the demand for spot yarn decreased daily. As a result, selling pressure suddenly increased, and cracks appeared in the market, breaking through the 60 tael level. Midway, due to the difficulty in easing credit, it broke through the 50 tael level. Towards the end of the month, due to economic factors, there were fewer buyers, and the downward trend was even more severe. The final price was 145 taels 2 qian, a difference of 16 taels in one month, a huge fluctuation. As a result, 6,400 bales remained, and only 150 bales of "Ten Bells" were actually delivered. The rest were self-delivered. The delivery price was 148 taels. Rongxing delivered 1,500 bales, and Shenxin delivered 500 bales, the most. Shenji received 1,050 bales, and Gongtai received 700 bales, the most. The matching table for the delivery of November futures cotton yarn is recorded on the left:</p>

<h3>Progress of Cotton Delivery This Month</h3>
<p>Delivery Price 31 Taels 1 Qian</p>
<p>The market for Han Standard Cotton in November was extremely firm at the beginning of the month. Due to the decline in goods from all routes and the blockage of the Han route, a portion of cotton merchants and Han groups tightened their grip and refused to release, extremely bullish. Although the surrounding environment was unfavorable, and American and Indian cotton both trended downward, these unfavorable conditions were ignored. However, because Dong cotton prices were high, various factories purchased as much foreign cotton as possible, accumulating increasingly large amounts of foreign cotton. As a result, the business of domestic cotton was completely encroached upon by foreign cotton. However, the bulls remained firm, and there was even talk of squeezing the shorts. Prices fluctuated between 33 taels and 4 qian. Towards the last few days of the month, some cotton merchants who were determined to take delivery, due to extremely tight credit and financial difficulties, settled all their large amounts, reversing to deliver 3,000 to 4,000 dan. As a result, the market fell sharply. The final price was 30 taels and 6 qian 5, a difference of 3 taels and 1 qian in this month, which can be considered huge. As a result, 21,200 dan remained, and actual deliveries amounted to about 6,000 to 7,000 dan. The average delivery price was 31 taels 2 qian. It was found that He Shun delivered 4,300 dan, Ruiyuan delivered 1,900 dan, and Xinheng delivered 1,400 dan. Tianlong received 1,400 dan, Da Ji received 1,800 dan, and Tongxing received 2,400 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Falls Below 6 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton fell because of the weakness of Wall Street, unfavorable news from Liverpool, and a decrease in buyers. Market conditions were weak, with futures falling 8 to 9 points and spot falling 5 points. British cotton futures rose 1 point, and spot fell 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell 15 points. Indian cotton was weak due to speculative selling, with Pingguoer falling 2.5 rupees, Aomula falling 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi falling 1 rupee.

<h3>American Cotton Continued to Weaken Last Week</h3>
<p>A report on the cotton market for the week from New York on the 27th states that the cotton market continued to react last week. The previously optimistic situation, coupled with the weakness of securities, wheat, and silver prices, led to renewed disappointment. Although the cotton market was weak, the downward trend was more gradual due to short covering and buying by traders. The high price of spot goods in the South restricted buyers, but cooperatives and Japan were buying in the southwest region. Some in the industry believe that the next government report (December 8) is likely to show an increase. Regardless of whether the measures signed by the New Orleans Federal Farm Board on October 12 and the legislation to reduce cotton acreage adopted at the Jackson local meeting are implemented, they are expected to still have an impact on the market. There is still doubt among traders regarding the recently enacted legislation and the reduction of cotton acreage. However, some believe that if there is any implementation, it will strengthen the current hoarding movement in the South.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Recover and Ease After Sunny Weather</p>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday's arrivals were around the 30th. Sales were initially stagnant, then brisk. Suzhou Tongbai japonica rice was extremely quiet in the morning, and prices continued to soften. Shops had extremely tight credit, and interest in purchases was weak. Middle-grade rice continued to fall by 3 jiao. Stale rice, on the other hand, felt slightly firmer. Thin rice arrived in large quantities with weak sales, and prices fell by another 4 jiao. Bianyin Yuanshan City inquiries were still good, but arrivals were not very abundant, and prices fell by half a chi. Foreign Dujiang showed no gains or losses, trending downwards.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, there were still many boats arriving from the Huan route. Business on this street was not good. Goods from Changzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, etc., continued to arrive. Buying sentiment was quiet, and prices weakened accordingly. Large parcels were short by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Qing Shi Feilai Feng thin rice, Shachuan gangs in this street had little trading, so the trend was fixed at the top and soft at the bottom. Dujiang top-grade goods were still stable, middle-grade sluggish, price trend slightly soft. YinHua high-grade goods were still fixed due to scarcity, middle-grade cheap but selling well. Kunshan Baihui japonica rice and early rice each fell by 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Hankou Gang Trials Small Filtered Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign rice showed a slight turnaround. Because the Hankou Gang was setting up business in the market, sentiment improved, and there were inquiries in this street, so the market was active. A total of 2,000 bags of small filtered rice were traded at a price of 2 yuan 0 jiao 1 fen and a half. 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon were traded at a price of 11 yuan 2 jiao. The future market opened with 2,000 tons of small filtered rice for April, priced at 4 taels and 9 qian, opened by Chanson, which was also divided between this street and the Yangtze Gang.</p>
<h3>Recent Flour Drop Plunges 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Although the flour market saw a huge change yesterday, the sharp drop in this month due to special circumstances was unexpected. The reason for the big drop was initially due to the foreign wheat quote, which fell another 6 or 7 jiao to about 1 yuan, making people already nervous. Then, the Northern gangs were observing, and sales of miscellaneous brands of flour were bound to be hit. In addition, credit was extremely tight, and hedging businesses paid no attention at all. It was heard that factories such as Huafeng and Tailong had delivered considerable warehouse receipts. The market was not good, and there was little hedging, so it was heard that from the opening to the closing of the market, prices plummeted step by step. The lowest closing price actually fell to 1 tael 8 qian 5 fen 7 li and a half, a drop of 5 fen 2 li and a half compared to the previous day's closing price. The decline in the far-term months was worse, and March and April were particularly stable. This was because off-market bulls were still taking deliveries. As a result, this month fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day, December fell by 1 fen, January fell by 2 fen, February fell by 1 fen 2 li and a half, March fell by a small 7 li and a half, and April fell by a small 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>Public Sentiment Abnormally Soft</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market presented a flat and weak appearance again. Because the foreign wheat quote fell by another 6 or 7 jiao to about 1 yuan, most people's hearts were naturally abnormally soft. Therefore, the opening prices for each month saw a slight decline. However, although foreign quotes were small, those who were placing orders were not active, as national affairs were so precarious, so-called having the heart but not the strength. In addition, off-market slightly bought in, so the market seemed slightly more stable. As a result, December fell by 4 fen compared to the previous day, January and February fell by 4 fen, March fell by 3 fen, and April fell by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Quanzhou Dried Longan Prices Stabilize</p>
<p>Since the price of Quanzhou large dried longan fell back in Shanghai, the trend has been difficult to stabilize. This is because the situation is bad and sales are sluggish. Therefore, the goods that arrived on the next ship were not opened by the firms, who were holding back, and there was a sign of a further decline. However, according to a letter from Quanzhou yesterday, the local area has recently had Nanyang gangs buying, so prices cannot continue to ease and are turning firm. The inventory is also not very large. However, since Shanghai sales are not smooth, it is ultimately difficult to follow the local price and recover.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Grey Silk Transported to America, 200 Pieces</p>
<p>The American mail ship President Lincoln exported yesterday, and the body-building firm Ganli and others had a total of 200 pieces of eight-cocoon grey silk, loaded to San Francisco. Of these, 108 pieces were transferred to New York, transported by train from San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Sells Well, Prices Are Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market in this port, British firms such as Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and Fushi were still showing strong interest in Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi. Needle tea, bead tea, and other items also had quite strong transactions. More than 1,200 boxes were traded in the entire city. Zhenmei sold for a top price of 115 taels, bead tea sold for 92 taels, and needle tea sold for 55 taels. Market prices were quite firm. However, although there were telegrams sent out by traders for colored Zhenmei from the Wuyuan North Route, there was still no major progress in the situation.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Fujian Gang Telegrams to Suspend Procurement of Metal Products</p>
<p>Yesterday, the metal market was unusually weak, due to the serious situation and the urgent credit situation. However, the Fujian Gang suddenly received a telegram from that port yesterday, stating that the procurement of metal and other goods had been suspended. The reason was that the number of Japanese warships had increased in recent days, and people were panicked. Moreover, credit was extremely tight, and business was quiet, so there were measures to reduce transactions. Therefore, when the market opened, it felt even more desolate yesterday. Fortunately, public sentiment was stable, so market prices were able to avoid major fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Coal</h3>
<p>Fine White Coal Sales Quite Brisk</p>
<p>Various types of fine white coal have been selling quite briskly recently. It is said that various coal briquette factories and coal merchants in this port are purchasing large quantities. Dealers from inland areas such as Jiaxing are also procuring a considerable amount. The selling price has therefore also seen improvement. Yesterday, the market成交 for 210 tons of Hongqi coal dust was at 11 taels, 200 tons of Shanxi coal dust at 9 taels, 260 tons of Maik coal dust at 8 taels and 5 qian, 80 tons of Indian coal dust at 8 taels and 2.5 qian, 130 tons of Fuzhou coal dust at 9 taels and 8.5 qian, and 50 tons of Liujiang coal dust at 7 taels.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Seven hundred pieces of dyes, shipped from Germany.</p>
<p>One hundred and sixty pieces of French silk fabrics, imported yesterday.</p>
<p>Seven thousand bags of refined sugar, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>French General Foch</h3>
<p>European War Diary · Translated by Gu Ang Ruo</p>
<p>Advance into the Rhineland</p>
<p>A few days later, according to the armistice treaty, the Allied forces advanced into the Rhineland, occupying the German territory on the left bank of the Rhine and three bridgeheads on the right bank. Have the Allied forces fulfilled their responsibilities to the Allied nations according to the armistice treaty of November 11? The armistice treaty signed by the Allied Commander-in-Chief is not enough to be a peace treaty, and cannot even be considered a preliminary peace. The armistice treaty merely temporarily halts the conflict and stops the bloodshed, so that the belligerent countries have the opportunity to negotiate a peace treaty. Although the armistice treaty contains political and financial provisions that must be implemented immediately, it still does not determine the status of the belligerent countries after the end of the war. The Allied governments have reserved the important task of proposing a peace treaty to determine the status of the belligerent countries. The Allied soldiers must be guaranteed so that the Allied governments can complete this task.</p>
<p>The Rhine is a natural barrier, and Germany can use it as cover to shake the position of the Allied forces to the benefit of peace talks. Now that the Allied forces have occupied the Rhine, the German government will have to submit during peace talks. If peace talks fail, it can also advance and fight again. The fact that German representatives fully accepted the conditions of the Allied nations and signed the peace treaty in Versailles on June 28, 1919, is clear evidence of this. Moreover, the occupation of the Rhine is even more a guarantee for the payment of reparations. Therefore, with the Rhine occupied, the Allied governments can propose any peace conditions and make the enemy fulfill them.</p>
<p>The signing of the armistice treaty was considered premature on our side. Delaying it for a few days or weeks would have led to the complete defeat of the German army, which would have been more advantageous to our army. Our army originally planned to attack east of the Moselle River on November 14, but this was cancelled due to the armistice order on November 11. If this offensive had proceeded smoothly, the Allied forces' 200-mile front could have advanced another 20 miles.</p>
<p>Since mid-July, the Allied forces have attacked repeatedly, and the German army has gradually retreated, capturing 7,990 enemy officers, 355,000 soldiers, 6,215 cannons, and 38,622 machine guns, which is unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>The German army collapsed by no less than 200 divisions. Tens of thousands of defeated soldiers retreated in chaos, fighting as they retreated. It was not until our army increased its artillery and machine guns that the enemy army submitted. Our army could have taken advantage of the victory and marched straight to the Rhine. The retreating enemy army was bombarded by our fierce artillery fire, resulting in a complete rout. Finally, they could no longer endure the bitter fighting and mutinied. The whole country responded, and a revolution broke out.</p>
<p>The German army's fierce fighting, which had lasted for four years, completely disintegrated at this point. The Allied forces advanced without resistance, and could not seek peace in order to survive. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Modern Forum (Continued) · Xu Shui Lin</h3>
<p>Written by British Dickinson, Translated by Liang Yuchun</p>
<p>The first to speak was MacCarty, an Irish anarchist, who was very dissatisfied with Allison's opinion and listened with great impatience. Just as Mr. Allison was about to stop, he stood up quickly and said, "If socialism is such a thing, may God forgive me, because I myself once said I was a socialist, but socialism is really not like this. I want to save this term from being abused."</p>
<p>His anarchist ideology denies all coercive forces arising from political society, seeking absolute freedom, peace, and universal love. He advocates using violence to overthrow the old society, standing in complete opposition to Allison's proposition.</p>
<p>The sixth to speak was Henry Martin, a skeptical university professor, who used a rational perspective and verifiable facts to criticize these two extreme positions. He said,</p>
<p>"All political beliefs cannot escape the scope of two extremes. Although they are all different, I call these two extremes collectivism and anarchism. Both of these ideologies are willing to sacrifice everything to achieve one goal. Collectivism hopes for order, while anarchism hopes for freedom."</p>
<p>He then presented several facts that neither ideology could pass, refuting both ideologies completely. He urged people to trust less in fantasies and focus more on facts, to use less emotion and more reason.</p>
<p>Originally, the first two people were talking happily, but Martin's criticism was like pouring a bucket of cold water on their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The seventh to speak was Wilson, a famous biology expert, who advocated focusing on the education of children and families based on a scientific view of life. He further used his scientific opinions to reassess the value of government, private property, the representative system, and socialism.</p>
<p>The eighth to speak was Ellis, a humorous journalist, who playfully ridiculed Wilson's opinions and frankly exposed all the material civilization and modern ugliness. His words were witty and his arguments were truly rare. The ninth was Oshifeng, a businessman who was an extreme pessimist. He fundamentally did not believe that the world and society could be improved. The tenth to speak was an aesthetic poet, who stood in absolute opposition to the pessimist. The eleventh was a leisurely gentleman who had long retired from politics. The twelfth was a follower of the "Quaker" sect. The thirteenth was a writer with philosophical thoughts. Each one was better than the last, like peeling silk from a cocoon, and each was wonderful.</p>
<p>A common problem among people who read is that they become slaves to the books they read, and when they see opposing arguments, they also think they are correct, lacking a critical spirit and failing to find the flaws in the books. They often fall into the distress of being lost and at a crossroads. After reading this book, one will definitely gain more knowledge and insight.</p>
<p>The entire book contains about 100,000 words. I now want to introduce a general outline in more than 3,000 words, which is truly a gross omission. I can only end here. (The End)</p>
