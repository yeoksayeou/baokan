<h3>關於金銀問題之世界消息</h3>
<p>以金貴銀賤之故。歐美之行商於中國者。致因貨價高貴而受挫折。於是乃有欲以餘銀貸欵於中國。以求銀價之平者。又有欲定金與銀之價格一定之比例。以謀銀價之不下落者。又有欲使用金幣。兼用銀爲副幣。使銀不致成爲貨物而漲落無常者。然種種計畫。雖有所聞。而結果無一可以實現。故金貴銀賤之趨勢亦依然如故。茲有關於金銀問題之消息二則亦足以見金貴銀賤之所由來焉。</p>
<p>其一·英國財長史諾登在議會聲稱。渠未知有人提出恢復銀價之任何實踐方法。渠以爲向法美兩國政府提議關於銀價之聯合行動。未必能有益於事云。</p>
<p>其二·法蘭西銀行存金。上星期又增六萬四千一百萬佛郎。目下共值五百五十萬法郎以上。爲該銀行向來所未有云。</p>

<p>敵方幾全軍皆墨</p>
<p>作戰後連殺四門</p>
<p>藉罰球破蛋紀錄</p>
<p>一月二十二日下午四時半丶爲稱霸申國南北大學曁大足球錦標隊丶與稱雄匪島大學仙道頓馬Ｓａｎｔｏ　Ｔｏｍａｓ　Ｕｎｉｖｅｓｉｔｙ足球錦標隊比賽在未比賽前丶僑界皆以敵方勢力雄厚岌岌爲我方危且逆料必各奮起精神爲國際爭榮賽丶故雖非休業時間丶觀衆倍覺踴躍丶結果竟能以四比一丶戰敗敵方丶爲羣衆所不及料無怪其歡欣若狂也丶</p>
<p>仙道頓馬之歷史</p>
<p>該大學爲西領時代所創設丶成立於三百餘年前丶不特爲東方最古學府丶即美洲之耶路大學猶其後輩丶近世菲島各界聞人丶多出其門丶現參議院議長即其一也丶近二十餘年來益加擴充丶并曾築莊嚴華麗校舍丶其名譽與菲大并駕齊驅而醫科尤爲彼校特色丶</p>
<p>足球勢力之雄厚</p>
<p>該校體育素極注重對外另設體育協會丶以收羅出校校友及在校學生丶一九三○年丶曾奪全菲大學足球隊錦標即過去在體育史中丶亦有相當榮譽丶故談起仙道頓馬各項球隊丶其雄風大足震人此番對曁大彼亦知爲勁敵丶且欲以全菲大學錦標隊丶壓倒我國大學錦標隊丶以增高國際地位丶故在一月前丶即召集新舊校友丶凡在足球界馳名者丶爲一度選擇丶且曾作相當訓練丶如前鋒五虎丶曾有三人出席遠東運動會丶其勢力雄厚丶實在令人以深刻紀憶丶</p>
<p>總領事大加鼓勵</p>
<p>是日下午三時丶鄺總領事親到靑年會宿舍丶集諸健兒慰問丶且加以勉勵丶大槪以曁大足球丶此行乃以大學資格名義且曾屢奪得國內大學錦標而仙道頓馬亦屬菲島大學錦標隊丶此回勝負丶有關兩國各大學體育榮譽丶深望諸君注意及努力云云丶經此一帖興奮劑丶故以受傷之莊世鴻丶梁樹棠丶猶帶病從軍丶至四時許丶總領事同諸健兒臨場丶長立參觀席以督戰焉丶</p>
<p>大戰起各顯神通</p>
<p>時間旣到丶互選球門丶循例獻花握手後丶銀笛一聲丶兩隊即實行接觸丶敵方中鋒弔球至我腹地丶右衛江善敬頭頂失漏丶敵方右翼飛奔上前丶意欲迎球力射當此間不容髪之際丶左衛馮運佑奮不顧身丶上前將球踼交中衛陳家球丶始得脫險丶陳復傳與右翼梅洪寳丶梅急行盤射丶以爲反攻丶惜去勢稍歪丶失一良機丶乃敵前鋒又向我方進逼丶江善敬以頂球解圍丶梅洪寳乘勢由右路包抄丶與陳鎭和并進距敵門十餘碼爲敵左中衛衝上奪球丶梅急傳交陳丶陳乘勢攻打丶乃敵守門身手靈活接球後立時踼出丶我方左翼陳秉祥丶忽得戴中鋒之來球丶從邊陲前進過中衛綫後丶急遞與左內鋒羅海光丶羅飛步前冲丶爲敵右中衛所抵抗丶羅盤過數步丶伸足遙射因球勢過高未能命中丶未幾馮運佑得球丶遠傳與陳秉祥丶陳急射過高此爲開場後五分鐘中一來一往情形丶</p>
<p>黑將軍二立奇功</p>
<p>戴中鋒忽得梁樹棠傳來之球丶黑將軍急馳主敵疆丶戴中鋒挑過兩衛丶傳與黑將軍丶黑將軍從左攻門丶乃提脚過猛球疾如矢丶中球門左柱丶球後反彈入綱丶令守門者無所措手足丶一球佔先丶觀衆無限喜慰丶此正如當日長扳坡丶一聲霹靂丶萬衆披靡也丶此時我方進攻益急丶屢屢長驅直入丶彼守門亦屬鐵打將軍丶手足并用丶屢將球擊出丶然我方前敵五虎丶乘敵方空虛丶再接再厲又得角球丶由陳秉祥挑落敵門之前丶羅海光用硬頭工夫雖未中的丶大足駭敵丶敵方由是拚命抵禦雖欲向前馳進丶我方陣勢嚴整丶終不使敵越雷池一步丶未進戴中鋒丶沿邊陲盤球直進丶被對方左衛冲倒黑將軍奮不顧身丶飛奔前進於五步內丶又攻進一球丶爲第二次記錄</p>
<p>獲兩球犯規無效</p>
<p>敵方見此情形丶屢次欲反守爲攻丶無如心既忙而足即亂丶有時球在足前丶竟傳送我方丶混戰十分鐘中丶裁判員銀笛一鳴丶以敵方門員犯抱球在手走過三步規則丶罰以間接踼丶此球須撞過任何球員身上丶然後踼入丶方爲有效丶乃戴中鋒急欲成功丶球勢過直丶未着球員身體丶故判爲無效丶敵方乘開球機會丶其右翼盤球沿右邊直進丶挑過我前衛後丶被馮運佑趕上丶賜出重圍丶未幾復來丶且爲盤曲勢之進襲丶亦被馬二將軍踼出界外丶但我方雖負角球丶因對方傳踼不準丶故未逞險狀丶乃陳家球籍罰如意球之機會丶從二十餘碼遙射丶因球勢過猛丶在守門手中丶又復落地丶黑將軍趕至丶向前衝射丶球復入網丶評判員判爲越位無效丶在觀衆中覩此兩球丶不生効力丶以評有左右袓丶怒氣塡胸丶有大呼將評判員Ｇｅｔ　ｏｕｔ者丶昨夜過問領隊陳掌諤君丶始知判兩球爲無效之原委丶誠非公道人之不公也丶</p>
<p>歪脚將遠射破網</p>
<p>綽號歪脚將之陳家球丶亦於再戰之中丶在二十五碼外截得一球丶再行遠射丶爲勢急而錳丶守門員接得又復落地丶反彈入網丶休息時間既到丶上半塲我方先以三比○丶戰勝敵方丶</p>
<p>黑將軍三次告捷</p>
<p>下半塲因莊世鴻傷未全愈丶祗以急於見功丶故帶病出塲丶上半場完時丶見勝算必操丶故以後備員林松發替代丶斯時我方乘戰勝餘威丶䇿應更有精采丶前鋒與俊衛一氣呼成丶前鋒苟有機會丶莫不一踴上前丶連珠式打球丶大有令敵方應接不暇丶黑將軍得後方之接濟丶盤近球門丶一踼中的丶遂開下半塲新紀錄丶統計爲四與○之比丶</p>
<p>得罰球免吃鴨蛋</p>
<p>敵方至此丶既不敢有得勝希望丶但期其成績不等於零丶斯不失數年來錦標榮譽丶故羣起努力反攻丶至此我方稍取守勢丶祇顯其送迎長技丶以眩觀衆視綫丶故敵方雖有數次衝鋒丶因帶病作戰之梁樹榮丶賣弄其頭頂工夫丶屢次將敵球打出丶至後衛左有馮運佑丶右有江善敬之維護丶更隱如泰山丶而馮監視之嚴密丶踼球之準確丶皆爲敵方大阻碍物丶故以彼方勇敢善戰丶曾出席遠東運動會右鋒樊羅君Ｆｒａｎｌｏ反攻丶皆爲馬二將軍破壞陣綫丶無功而還丶敵方反攻旣猛丶我方亦忙於抵禦丶梁樹棠因與對方右鋒搶球丶彼方被伴倒丶遂罰十二碼球丶由樊羅君主踼丶一試中的丶雖新任守門將軍丶仆地抵禦丶亦無法救出丶敵方左鋒丶再乘勝欲搗我城壘丶逼近踼進一球丶被守門將軍奮拳擊出丶此球亦甚險也丶其所餘數秒鐘前丶敵方之戰鬥力丶猶不稍疲乏丶亦大可驚人丶時問已到丶宣告完場丶遂爲四與一之比丶我軍大勝而特勝丶　　莊梁之勇氣堪欽</p>
<p>梁官濂因足病加劇丶無法應敵丶不得已由後衛謝全和替代丶至中衛莊世鴻與右衛梁樹棠丶因第二塲與仙迷撈隊比賽受傷丶外聞遙傳傷勢頗重丶且無良醫爲調治丶敝校同事莊烜笙君丶曾度莊姓家族自治會委託丶到青年會宿舍慰問莊世鴻君丶並問彼如有需要丶願代爲策應丶莊烜笙君回來告予丶謂莊梁二健將傷足頗重丶現起立爲難丶祇急延良醫丶爲謀第四塲作戰丶（下星期日）予亦心急丶再偕烜笙君到靑年會晤足球幹事梁國材君丶謂華僑中有名西醫丶頗不乏人丶願任介紹丶在胡君則謂經有校友桂華岳醫士丶今天爲之敷藥丶傷勢稍瘥丶星期四仙道頓馬之比賽丶恐難出戰云云丶予夜來甚爲担憂丶以少此二猛將可惜丶不圖昨至塲中丶見莊梁二君丶猶如生龍活虎丶再馳騁於疆塲間丶若其無事然丶蓋爲愛國心所驅使丶忘却一切苦痛丶正如薛仁貴之帶病殺敵丶其勇敢大堪嘉頌也丶</p>
<p>音樂隊無聲而過</p>
<p>在敞方挾其歴來奪得錦標榮譽丶亦有必勝决心丶故其校中敎職員丶大半出席參觀丶（因爲敎會中人丶皆有特別衣服可認丶）且據本埠新中國報所載丶並備有音樂隊丶以便戰勝後大吹大擂慶祝丶　孰知竟啞然無聲而還丶亦一塲大掃興事也丶曁南陣線如下丶</p>

<h3>㈡籃球敗於商隊</h3>
<p>丨第三次比賽丨</p>
<p>三十六與三十八之比</p>
<p>黃漢升高奪定軍山</p>
<p>魏文長追隨入功績</p>
<p>可惜最後二球不中</p>
<p>正月二十一夜七點半丶爲眞茹籃球隊第三次出馬比賽丶挾其過去連勝二陳雄威丶使此陣再勝丶則以後無論如何丶皆佔優着丶自然益振起精神丶即僑衆亦同此心理丶故是夜觀者二千餘人丶仍以僑衆佔多數丶預備呐喊助威也丶</p>
<p>對方內容</p>
<p>對方爲全匪商業隊丶此隊由褚發售運動器具緒公司組織而成丶其球員範圍甚廣丶不限定一學校丶或一社團丶差不多盡人皆可拉攏加入丶當夜據觀衆云丶此中有三人丶曾出席遠東運動會以記者所知丶丶其右鋒沙描　Ｓａｌａｄｅｒ确爲出席東健将丶其人爲西班雅半種丶運動而外丶兼以導演戲劇爲生活丶身體高大丶比我方黃兆霖高過五英寸丶重量必過三十磅以外丶有如黃帝涿鹿戰中之蚩尤氏丶氣力甚大丶長於遠射技藝丶故該隊誠我方一大勁敵也丶</p>
<p>一擊即中</p>
<p>銀笛一鳴丶球戰開始丶我方中鋒魏海靑急傳與立敵球籃下之黃兆霖丶神手一揮丶應聲入網丶誠一善射之健將丶可謂首擊定軍山丶使曹軍胆寒丶觀衆高聲喝采丶以助其威丶我方右衛張其英誤犯規則被評判員判罰候方左衛兩試皆中丶敵方右衛丶又傳球與候在藍下之左衛丶由其手輕輕託進丶遂成二對四之紀錄丶驍將蚩尤氏乂從遠方送</p>
<p>進一球至是我方鋒氣稍挫丶遂要求停戰丶</p>
<p>陣勢轉佳</p>
<p>我方經敎練與隊長密授機宜丶形勢大爲活動丶黃兆霖得蔡榮瑞之傳交·描射一球丶在此掌聲未絕之際丶蔡榮瑞雖遠攻未中丶而黃兆霖乂以伏軍制勝丶遂爲六對六之比丶敵方正猛力竸進丶而張其英又從旁邊射入一球丶敵方右衛得球後丶傳與蚩尤丶在籃卜射入丶敵方犯規黃兆霖施射不中丶而孔廣　從敵方奪得球後丶因遠射力猛丶彈出圈外幸得黃兆霖在藍下又入一球孔社益心懷不甘益發努力竟從左邊投入一球丶由是兩方爭逐丶幾同於短兵相接丶步步爲營至十八超十五時敵方遂要求暫停戰丶</p>
<p>扶搖直上</p>
<p>我方右衛張其英丶亦暫告休息丶由夏澤人代之蔡榮瑞得球丶傳與魏海靑丶魏避過敵防丶從前攻進又入一球丶未幾彼中鋒犯規丶由黃兆霖罰丶球亦一擲成功丶上半場結果丶佈告牌上丶大書眞茹隊得二十一分丶全商隊得十五丶</p>
<p>狂力奮鬬</p>
<p>兩軍易地開戰後丶黃兆霖再罰中一球丶敵方隊長蚩尤氏丶指授機宜丶拚命進攻丶頗見得手丶趕至一十二對二十四之比丶仍屈服我方之下丶不謂我方謂換張其英丶忘向評判員聲明被罰一球丶敵方蚩尤氏乘虛試投進一球遂勝我方一分丶幸菲右衛因手推魏海青被罰一球丶遂成平分五十再爲幾次惡戰丶而保均平之勢丶爲二十八對二十八之比丶</p>
<p>奮起直追</p>
<p>在此酣戰中丶菲右衛因四次犯規被逼出場丶黃兆霖得蔡魏之遠傳丶射進一球丶勝彼二分矣丶乃雖尤氏得球丶傳交中鋒丶亦還敬一球丶又成平分之局丶我方黃兆霖在邊徼忽得來球丶展其當日大刀直擘夏侯淵之手段丶成三十二對三十之勝着丶而雖尤氏不甘示弱丶亦從右方飛進一球丶雖成爲亦步亦趨之勢丶然我方時佔上着丶</p>
<p>分庭相抗</p>
<p>戰雲緊張丶時間乂逼丶正如紅日將西墜丶西軍爭欲一决雌雄也丶此時菲中鋒得左鋒右衛之緊快傳遞連入兩球丶而老將黃漢升丶見敵方得寸進寸丶自然亦倚老賣老丶單刀匹馬丶直搗敵疆措丶從左方打進一球丶敵方雖尤氏犯規被評判員判罰丶不服與抗丶又被判罰丶兩球皆爲黃兆霖射中丶成爲三六對三六之和丶</p>
<p>最後失敗</p>
<p>敵方雖尤被罰丶益肆咆哮丶旣連遠射兩球丶皆不中矣丶乃因中鋒之傳交丶更在籃打進一球丶時黃兆霖得來一球丶心急手忙丶竟遠射未中丶孔廣益馳到籃下丶再施猛擊丶被敵方所阻丶判以犯規丶惜我方猶未能命中丶完場之號既鳴丶我方遂以一球之差丶成爲三十六對三十八而終局丶</p>
<p>觀衆批評</p>
<p>觀衆評論丶可歸結數點如下丶一·我方利於近襲丶處處以逸待勞丶而當日之遠射丶皆未能命中二敵方對傳送手段敏捷丶呼應活動丶其高躍遠接丶皆機靈妙丶三·敞方不利近射丶惟遠擊技術丶其中一二人丶確有獨到工夫丶四·如雖　氏身體雄邁丶使人望而生畏丶球在彼手中丶我方不敢逼近丶因爲我軍此番征非丶爲觀摩計丶非專爲戰勝計丶故特表而出之丶</p>

<p>蘇曼殊之與山芋鄭逸梅</p>
<p>自由談曾刋予所著馮蒿叟之與凍豆腐一文。友人胡靈雲讀而善之。因謂尙有蘇曼殊之與山芋一段佚事。可供。操觚資料。予請之述說。其亦爲景仰燕子龕和尙者所樂聞歟。曼殊曩居東京。貧困殊甚。一日橐中祇賸小銀幣五枚。東京生活程度綦高。戔戔五小銀幣。不足以供一餐之費用。山芋於彼邦。價絕低廉。乃購如千斤。初頗啖而樂之或生或熟。或乾煨。或湯煑以之果腹。然不三日而生厭。舌本淡而無味。但阮囊羞澀。無可以快朶頤。朱門酒肉。徒垂　涎。如是者半月。其苦萬狀。爲之羸餒欲病。嗣後曼殊見山芋。輒疾首蹙頞。不再啖嘗。有强之者。乃以前事見告。不稍隱諱。蓋曼殊素性甚率直也。靈雲又謂曼殊嗜糖。尤愛摩爾登糖。糖貯以瓶。罄則委瓶於榻下。纍纍皆是。不加收拾。某次糖告絕。而無錢續購。等簿再三。遂及榻下之糖瓶。悉以貨諸於瓶肆。既獲資。欣然又挾得摩爾登歸。咀糖著書。永夜不息。既而又有長鋏歸來乎食無糖之歌。然瓶少不足以抵值。無已乃敲去其金齒一以易之。其癖糖有如此。故有糖僧之號。聞其客死海上寳隆醫院。圓寂之傾。醫生猶於枕畔檢得糖果一包。此糖僧之所以。爲糖僧歟。</p>
<p>大舞台三夕記少卿</p>
<p>楊小樓馬連良新艶秋同時演藝於大舞台。如此好戲。機不可失。乃連觀三夕。退爲此記。新艶秋本坤令四大名旦之一。扮相唱工表情。頗似程艶秋。聰其御碑亭玉堂春法門寺三劇。以玉堂春學得最佳。妙肖自然。幾可亂眞。流水板尤佳。獨得玉霜（艶秋字）要板用音抑揚頓挫之秘。玉堂春一劇爲程艶秋傑作。新頴淒清。變化不窮。學之者多於高亭唱片中求之。能全齣神似者。當推此豸矣。</p>
<p>馬連良正走鴻運。南北觀迎。能丈能武。會唱會做。年來嗓音大佳。如虎添翼。王佐斷臂之搶背。乾凈老練。衣褶甩髮髯口。皆自然不亂。此式出色驚人。唱法雖不純宗譚腔。亦能圓到自如。字眼稱加安排。便可直追叔岩矣。惟御碑亭封休書時之戰抖。似嫌過火。又考籃代以網籃。頗失書生體統。舉此二點。責賢求備之意。望連良改之。</p>
<p>觀小樓連環套八大鎚安天會三劇。三稱性質三種表情。三種打法。三種步法。而小樓演之。並皆入妙。眞全材也。連環套之黃天覇。已做將官。須顧身分。喜怒憂懼。表情極多。須脫火氣。白口繁難。又須有分寸層次。小樓演來皆恰到好處。（少山之竅爾墩傅小山之朱光祖。陳嘉璘之彭朋皆好）八大鎚之陛文龍。自徐小香王楞仙張長保牛松山等一脈相傳。爲　尾生之絕活。第一要義。須狀十六歲之童子姿態。武中帶文雅。穩中含稚氣。與岳飛會陣對鎗。打宋將後之要翎舞鎗盤腿跥足。各種姿勢。屈指難數。解數無窮。小樓以武生兼得小生眞傳。工夫神化。是日精神煥發。特別精彩五花八門。美妙絕倫。較之北平所演。尤爲賣力。演者與觀者皆覺筋骨舒暢。與玩藝自有眞價值也。美哉美哉。安天會孫大聖之身段打法。如拳法之猴拳以小巧柔捷見長。與陸文龍之需大方者逈異。而小樓演來。能脫胎換骨。唱北曲醉花陰一套。一字不減。亦結實沉穩。八武戲用北曲唱者。皆爲佳作。小樓尤爲拿手。如挑華車狀元印三擋夜奔等文武凈戲如鐵籠山拿高登等。亦小樓絕唱。吾將乘此良機。一一觀之。</p>
<p>紫羅蘭重觀色相芮鴻初</p>
<p>廻憶紫羅蘭女士。往歲曾在奧迪安大戲院表演各種歌舞及京粵劇。雖祇十二齡。而表情細膩。頗得觀衆贊許。當女士十歲時。在廣州第一公園表演歌舞。譚延闓先生題曰「冰雪聰明」。伍朝樞吳鐵城先生題曰「陽春白雪。」可見爾時已自不凡矣。今女士年十五。重來海上二十五日在奧迪安大戲院初度表演。爲况甚盛。二十六日。大雪紛飛。寒風凛冽。余未往觀。二十七晚九時。偕黎顯芳君前往參觀。台上陳列榮譽獎章。花籃銀盾。不下四十餘種。花光與銀光爭艶。彌復可觀。電影明星蝴蝶女士黎明暉女士。亦來觀光。未幾開幕。女士清唱京曲王春娥。妙音宛轉。不同凡響。彭國琦·黃錦禪·楊衍華·阮少屏·李卓。鄧宜等奏廣東音樂餓馬搖鈴。弦管伊嘔。檀板和拍。儼若馬鈴之聲。李卓君之粵曲蝶冷花殘。唱句清晰。惜嗓子太低。不易動聽。紫羅蘭女士之粵劇禪房夜怨。此劇最重頭難唱。「想到此情。眞正合儂心痛」二句。如泣如訴。諸音樂家奏「娛樂昇平」。樂聲鏗鏘。心曠神怡。女士演八股佬敎女一劇。頭戴瓜皮帽。裝假鬚。身御馬褂長衫厥狀甚爲滑稽。一時掌聲雷動。殿以趾舞。爲女士傑作。觀起脚趾作舞。飄飄若仙。洵非易事也。深夜歸來。捉筆記之。</p>
<p>夜闌寒雨聽吳平烟絲</p>
<p>月之二十五日。吳平音樂團公演京劇於中央大戲院。蘇州京劇票房彩排之盛。以此次爲最。夜間寒雨迷濛。羣知天氣將轉變。而紅男綠女。依然鼓勇以往。未及七時。已告座滿。余至適爲彭笑秋君六月雪。火候已到。惜賦體龐大臃腫。不稱旦角耳。次爲項壽增君之奇寃報。平穩無疵。次虞一城之三堂會審。歷四十分鐘。到底不懈。次松柏軒主與錢心秋君之四郎探母。各有精釆時已夜深。乃賦歸與。至陳吾崗君與戎伯銘君珠聯璧合之虹霓關。未得寓目。甚悵悵耳。吳中京劇票房。屢興屢仆。觀於是日之盛。必能鼓起興會。吳平或能孟晋而勿衰歟。</p>
<p>淴浴考葉華女士</p>
<p>味之偏愛。輒因水土氣候而異。吾國川湘兩省愛辣。每飯不離。晉人愛酸。粥內置醋。俗有南甜北鹹東辣西酸之諺。蒜葱韮菜。國人嗜之者。亦不乏人。此類食料。一經汗腺排洩。汗乾而排洩所遺物質仍黏貼於膚。每致臭氣四溢。令人掩鼻。於是淴浴尙矣。淴浴之功。不特潔身。且能活血止痛安神治病强身延年。浴後血壓脈跳。僉入適中狀態。身心均感舒適。無怪歐西諸邦。咸重視之如飲食。縱奇冷酷寒。亦不願一日間。費昆年醫博士。昨談西國淴浴濫觴。爰撮其要者於次。考希臘初葉。距今二千三百年。已有柑帕克拉次Ｈｉｐｐｏｋｒａｅｓ講解淴浴之利害及其溫度關係。洎乎羅馬。洗澡之風益盛。羅馬宮中廣設浴池浴盆。爲民間倡。此時不懂以熱水浴身。冷水亦多施用。希臘醫師普魯薩男爵ｖｏｎ　Ｐｒｕｓａ發明冷水浴治病說。至此曾介紹於羅馬。冷水浴極盛時。名醫莫薩Ｍｕｓａ使用冷水浴治愈羅馬皇奧古斯大及詩人荷拉士Ｈｏｒａｚ久病之心氣症。皇乃獎勵該醫。並信冷浴。逢人宣傳。冷浴之推重。非偶然也。發明寒暑表之攝氏。Ｃｅｋｓｕｓ認冷浴爲醫飲食病之良法。尤以出汗後入冷水爲佳。以其剌戟胃腸。加力消化。羅馬衰亡。淴浴之風隨之而一蹶不振。中世紀末。歐洲各地設有浴室。裝置蒸氣。並實行藥草洗身。迨後發現溫泉。浴者更衆。旋梅毒鼠疫瀨病等傳染病猖獗。溫泉浴一律停止。淴浴中興期在十七世紀末。英醫生弗魯耶Ｆｌｏｙｅｒ以冷浴名。著書立說。普遍民間。書名Pｓｙｈｒｏｌｏｕｓｉａ。。三十年內再版六次。弗氏謂英多佝僂病。其最大原因。在嚴憚冷水。以此缺少抵抗力。當時國內羣起非難之。相率抵制冷浴。惟意大利聆其言。信之行之。相沿成習。水學專家伯那杜Ｂｅｒｎａｒｄｏ與土達拿Ｔｏｄａｎｏ云冷水可治一切疾病。若飮多量冷水。則獲益無窮。產婦分娩時。以雪置腰部。婦可安然免疼痛。盛可士Ｓａｎｇｅｚ言有寒熱者裸體圍以雪高及嘴部。搖擺其身。令其出汗。同時再飮冷水可愈。吾人陡然聞及。莫不爲之驚訝也。</p>
<p>巴黎物語（十九）六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>十二聖母院</p>
<p>凡是早幾年在上海看過名電影片「鐘樓怪人」的。他腦中應當還記得一個雄壯美麗的大敎堂的映畫罷。那敎堂便是世界知名的巴黎聖母院Ｎｏｔｒｅ丨Ｄａｍｅ　ｄｅ　Ｐａｒｉｓｏ（電影「築樓怪人」的本事係取村於法國十九世紀大詩人黨俄俄所作小說Ｎｏｔｒｅ丨Ｄａｍｅ　ｄｅ　Ｐａｒｉｓ直譯應作「巴黎聖母院」。）</p>
<p>我上面介紹塞萊河的風景時。不足是說過那河中有兩個小島嗎。聖母院便建在那河中較大的西特ｌａ　Ｃｉｔｅ島上。這是巴黎最重要的名勝之一。凡在塞萊河岸走過的。無論對於美術和歷史方面的興趣怎樣淡薄。當他瞧見聖母院那兩座高聳入雲的方塔。和那盤踞在河邊的鉅大莊嚴的廟宇。他一定會停留幾分鐘來瞻仰一下。從他的心底流出一聲讚歎。</p>
<p>聖母院是巴黎最古最美的建築之一。現在的廟宇建於一一六三年。差不多有八百年的歷史了。但在一一六三年以前聖母院的所在地已有別的敎堂存在過。它的歷史可以一直追到第三世紀末。所以我們不看聖母院的本身。單看它的歷史都是很有趣味的。</p>
<p>有人說聖母院的正面形式太方正了。現得有點呆笨的樣子。這話也許對的。但我想也許正因爲它的形式方正所以才現得嚴肅罷。並且看聖母院的外貌最好站在塞萊河左岸側面去看。有了塞萊河的清流才把這古廟現得更加幽麗。記得有一天下午。我從巴黎大學下了課出來。沿着聖哲克街Ｒｕｅ　Ｓｔ·Ｊａｖｑｕｅｓ向北閒步。當我剛走到塞萊河岸時。偶然抬頭向斜對面一看。突然瞧見聖母院靜靜地聳立在落霞燦爛的晚空中。它的正面和側面都被夕陽輝映着。那時天是紅的。塞萊河水也是紅的。介在水天之間又浴着斜暉的聖母院當然也現得是紅的了。那樣美麗。眞使我喜得心跳。</p>

<p>寒假中光楣</p>
<p>㈠假前</p>
<p>每逢到假期的將臨丶無形中好似陡然地增加了一重須待考慮的心思丶返里呢抑留滬上丶前者似乎是理所當然丶暑假旣未回去丶一別經載的故鄕丶父母是怎樣地懷想着丶姊姊弟妹們又是如何地謁念着丶親友們見了我父母更得殷殷關心地垂詢着丶「你家小姐今年寒假回來不丶」若果眞地留滬時丶他們便又須加重語氣了丶「你家小姐今年爲什麽不回來丶夏天不回來丶過年也不回來嗎丶在上海做什麼事丶」他們口頭上雖僅如此簡單丶可是內心的疑竇丶狐疑的思想丶已不知達到某種程度了丶「究竟在上幹海什麼丶是不是眞的在上海呢丶爲什麼連家都不要了丶奠非已經嫁了丶過年才不得回來呵······」這些口邊的問題丶並非我自己神精過敏丶杜撰出來的丶確是有這一回事呀丶凡此種種丶每逢寒假必得逼我回家一趟丶固然是藉此去看一看父母丶而最大的意義丶還是在謹防謠言於未萌丶呵丶環境之惡劣丶風氣之閉塞丶人言之可畏丶三人言而成虎丶我却深知而深信丶照這樣說起來丶此次的還鄉丶却出於被動的了丶天呵丶問我良心丶决不敢欺騙着我的父母丶委實我對於家的觀念丶旱就淡漠了許多丶住麼一年不回去丶眞頗不算件事丶只要每次接到家書丶聽說家人均安適丶便什麼也不掛念了丶那裏還願意拿金錢買罪受呢丶丨運行的不便丶夏則不堪其熱丶冬則不堪其冷丶往往要凍河冰水丶加之士匪出沒無常丶可是呵丶爲了上游的原因丶兼之丶近來三弟事先來信說二弟的病丶「······至今仍未起床丶同時母親也非常想你丶統希望你回來一行丶」旣然現實是這樣地昭示給我丶除了遵照着行事外丶別無它議丶這時丶甜蜜的故鄉丶溫誠的母愛丶親愛的手足丶一個圓滿的家庭丶便在我腦海中開始演映着丶返里的念頭丶即刻成立了丶於是不管什麼丶不顧一切丶整個的心靈箭也似地向着那自以爲甜蜜的家鄕馳去丶</p>
<p>說也可怪丶自從决定了回家後丶心緒益發不寗了丶一方面歸心似箭丶它方面却又似捨小得遽爾就離開這生活慣了的上海丶與但是這一遭呵丶當耍告別上海的時候丶總是有一種莫名的依依丶尤其是汽笛一聲丶車身移動了丶眼看着上海輪廓與我握別丶酸楚的淚丶快將奪眶而出丶可是丶仔細一想丶上海又何足我留戀呢丶不過丶我是反對人們對她的咀咒丶咀咒她是萬惡之魔丶更其是那班未曾到過上海的人丶只是道聽途聞地一味的「上海萬惡丶决不是讀書的所在地丶」固然丶也是不容否認或反對丶不過丶抹煞了她的一切丶專門論其缺點丶似乎也决不是可以如此輕易武斷的丶我以爲一種環境的善良與否丶不是絕對的丶上海並不如一般人所咀咒的那樣可怕丶我愛她的文明丶一切發達丶最痛快的丶就是每晨七時即可看到當天的報紙丶一旦走到內地丶起碼可感覺到文化的隔絕丶新聞的遲滯丶在這種文化樞紐的環境中丶百業會萃的都市裏丶正是求學一個良機丶是以我只是贊成而不反對丶也便是我對於上海依依留戀的原因呵丶</p>

<p>各國地方自治大綱湯彬</p>
<p>王檢譯</p>
<p>在我國政府積極地主持建設的時期丶這「丶自治問題」在目前富然也是極形重要的丶如敎部在不久之前曾頒布丶「學生自治會組織大綱」的條例丶這雖然是指狹義的而言丶但我國政府已注意於「自治問題丶」這却是顯然的事實丶</p>
<p>「地方自治」這個名辭丶它原來是指包括一個權國領土內各小區域的各種公共行政丶無論這樣行政是由地方選舉的團體或由國家官吏施行丶如施用於德意志丶北美合衆國·瑞士·加拿大和澳大利亞洲的時候丶「地方自治」這個名辭不過用來施用於附屬於省政府的團體的管轄權罷了丶至於南阿非利加洲的各省則根據更不相同的基礎丶如果這個問題詳細的加以採求丶當然非有巨大的篇幅不可丶但是作者海烈斯在此祇記述各國現行制度的大綱丶和對於在各個制度下流行的地方自治的實際程度加以批評丶祗是這樣丶這冊「各國地方自治大綱」一書已足有可觀的了丶</p>
<p>原來丶世界各民族在性質上丶在歷史上丶在習慣和風俗上丶根本大有不同丶任何一種政府制度不能夠同樣適用於它們全體丶甚至於在同一個國家之內丶行政事件種類和彈性成丶爲非常重要的素因丶所謂「一人之肉他人之毒」的一句熟聞的隱語丶却含有相當的眞義丶但在蒲伯Pope的著名的詩句裏丶是有這樣的說丶「讓愚人們爭辯政府的形式丶凡經最優良治理的是最好的丶」這詩句的全部含意或許不能夠深信丨不爲那些從敎育的和從行政的觀點信仰地方自治的所深信丨但是蒲伯以爲實體比擬形式更爲重要丶這却是眞確的話丶然而丶雖有這種觀念丶那政府形式的研究不是空談丶形式解說實體丶同時又施以影嚮丶並且丶雖一個國家不分皂白採取別一個所有民族和國家歷史完全不同的國家的政府制度是不智的丶然而很少國家不在搜尋改良他們政治制度的一部或他部的某種方法丶這種方法有時可以由採擇在別處業已實行的方法而找到丶關於這一點丶作者在「緒論」裏是述得很詳細丶由此丶我們也可以明瞭此書的重要丶而足以供給實施或準備實施「地方自治」的政府與研究者的參考丶</p>
<p>首先討論的是「法國」丶並且比較其它的各國耍詳細丶因爲法國的方法有許多國家曾經愼重的採用丶同時對於其它各國也有重大的影響丶法蘭西起初是規定多量的地力自治權丶牠的各種形式留傳牠們的痕跡迄於今日丶後來發展而爲一種分部政治的中央集權丶（ＢｕｒｅａｕｃｒａｔｃＣｅｎｔｒａｌｉｚａｔｉｏｎ）這個高爾（Ｇａｕｌ）的行政制度丶雖在羅馬帝國滅亡之後而消滅丶但法蘭克的（Ｆｒａｎｋｉｓｈ）君主政體保留牠的幾種方法丶從十四世紀以降丶頒訂特許狀的城市和土地貴族二者的自治權逐漸消滅丶這個使法蘭西統一的政策丶在最近晚期之內也沒有背離這個傾向丶各種政府丶無論是君主的丶帝國的丶以及北和的丶曾經同樣急急於要保存法蘭西的統一并且以丶爲做這件事的唯一方法丶是把整個行政嚴格地隸屬於巴黎的統治權之下丶全國國民對於這點顯然同政府一致丶所以在我們中國政府也力求統一以謀整個的建設丶法國地方自治的單位是市丶（Ｃｏｍｍｅｎｅ）市是從古代留傳下來的丶但是牠們現在的形式起始於大革命丶經憲法議會（ＣｏｎｓｔｉｔｎｅｎｔＡｓｓｅｍｂｌｙ）命令每個城·鎭·敎區·或鄕村社會應有一個市丶所以它是佔有重要的位置丶其次是區（Ｃａｂｔｏｎ））和縣（Ａｒｒｏｎｄｉｓｓｅｍｅｎｔ）丶它係省間的行政分部丶但是不很重要丶省（Ｄｅｐａｒｔｎｅｎｔ）也是憲法議會所劃分全國爲各省丶它底「丶市長」與「省常務委員會」的產生法丶這書裏都有分別的論述丶極有系統的丶其它如地方財政的主要來源丶巴黎和賽因省的行政和法國的其他部份所不同之點丶行政裁判權的原則丶幾種公務的行政如公共衛生丶敎育丶道路丶公共救濟丶警警等丶都有精密的討論丶所以法國地方自治制度丶是很值得它國政府和民衆的注意丶　　比利時丶荷蘭丶和意大利的地秀自治制度丶它們都很類似於法國的丶如代議的地方議會的選舉團丶行政方面都根據同樣的制度組織而成丶即一個「市」裏丶設有市長丶市議會丶市長參事會丶以及市秘書等丶其他省縣的劃分丶財政的來源都相差不遠丶這顯然是採取法國的制度丶西班牙則位於其次丶因爲丶雖然牠的地方自治制包含牠特有的幾種狀態丶如它現行的一部新的省自治法丶是把增加的行政和財政權授與各省丶同時市區亦不是立法部的產物丶這都是西班牙所具的特徵丶然而它所採取的地方自治制丶却比較任何其它要類似法國丶還有斯干達納維亞頰（Ｓｃｎｎｄｉｎａｖｉａｎ）各國的制度也大半以法國的原則爲根據丶</p>
<p>德意志的組織根據則是不同的方法丶它底地方自治制度的基本原則丶計有兩種丶㈠由直接對於中政府負責的官吏和團體在地方上執行中央政府職掌丶㈡各區和其他選舉的地方機關的自治丶每個制度有牠本身的領土的分區丶有時候兩相符合丶有時則否丶牠底分制法丶爲「地方自治機開丶」「地方上的國家行政丶」「地方自治團體的節制丶」「各區財政的歲收丶」「市組織的種類丶」以及其它都與法國所施行的有所不同丶不過新的地方自治憲法丶在現今還是處於很不固定的地位丶</p>
<p>瑞士的地方自治按照各邦的起原具有法國的或德國的特性丶在這一章裏丶作者是簡單的論到東歐的若干小國丶但是所謂蘇維埃治下實際理行的制度丶因爲不足以作它國自治的參考丶所以著者完全把它刪掉丶這當然是含有充分的原由的丶</p>
<p>大不列顚對於地方自治的觀念和所舉的各國完全不同丶著者在叙英格蘭丶蘇格蘭和包括愛爾蘭自由邦的愛爾蘭的制度之後丶設置叙述英國海外領土的一章丶在這種領土內英國的原則經精密地遵守丶雖有有趣的發展和背離丶這是很可以使我們注意的一點丶而且這等國家的各省或各邦所採的形式是非常的駁雜丶所以原者不得不與以普遍的論述丶而這種情形丶在合衆國亦然丶這都是著者所研究的獨到之處丶</p>
<p>南美洲各國的地方自治的制度未有論及丶至於非洲和亞洲的大陸（除掉英屬南非洲和英屬印度）丶對於著者本來的計劃似乎沒有關係丶所以來有詳論丶但是丶叙述日本的制度一章却把它包括於內丶最後一章「要略和批抨」丶是對於表顯各國所有地方自治制度的大半顯著着的事實述其要略丶這是很值得一讀的丶</p>
<p>這書的全部丶是包括法藺西丶比利時丶荷蘭丶意大利丶西班牙丶丹麥丶瑞典丶挪威丶德意志丶瑞士丶東歐羅巴洲丶大不列顚和愛爾蘭丶英國海外領士丶北美合衆國丶以及日本等國的地方自治制度的實况都述得異常明白而有有條理丶並且各國排列的次序丶都是經過愼重的考慮丶同時丶對於各民族生活的實際情形和充分的閱歷丶都極形有顯地告訴我們丶足以作準確的比較的研究丶如果一個國家之內丶對於地方自治制度的實際組織不能夠及格丶人民最好向各方觀察丶或者在世界別個地方已經找到了他們所遇的特殊困難的補救方法丶那麼這冊「各國地方自治大綱」丶就把這些問題的答案一切解决了丶至少是足以指示更詳細的材料的來源丶</p>
<p>王君的譯筆極形流暢丶更足以表現本書的佳點丶在我國政府正積極地整理建設事業的時期丶這書是值得愼重推薦的丶</p>

<h3>Recovery of Lian County Seat</h3>

<h3>Shanxi-Suiyuan Generals Continue to Hold Talks</h3>
<p>Studying the Opinions Proposed by Various Army Commanders</p>
<p>Ji Hu and Others Send Secret Telegrams to Liaoning and Zhang Requesting Instructions</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) At 10:00 AM on the 29th, Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, and Yang Aiyuan went to the Shanxi Grand Hotel to hold talks with Ji Hongchang, Chen Guozhen, Hu Mao, and others. The opinions raised by the various army commanders were studied separately. Ji and others stated that regarding Shang's offer to relinquish the position of army commander and the proposal of a ten-division system and a one-third reduction in the total number of troops advocated by the army commanders, a decision must await Zhang Xueliang's reply. It is said that in recent days, Ji and others have secretly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang for informal instructions. Currently, Ji, Hu, Chen, Shang, Xu, and Yang plan to jointly telegraph Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang, requesting acceptance. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Xu Yongchang and the army commanders discussed the matter at Sun Chu's residence in the evening. It is said that Xu intends to change the downsizing plan to five armies, each with a seven-regiment system. Furthermore, someone proposed abolishing the army commander system and establishing a military committee, with each committee member responsible for handling affairs, but no decision has been made. The final result is to adhere to the principle of reorganization and streamlining, with the premise of benefiting the country and the people, but still study specific measures based on the ten divisions, each with a six-regiment system. It was also decided that Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, and the army commanders would jointly telegraph Zhang Xueliang, requesting that he adopt the opinions of the Shanxi generals and start from practical considerations to facilitate progress. The telegram has already been drafted and will be sent after being circulated among all parties. Ji and others stated that they came here under orders to handle the reorganization and streamlining, and in terms of their mission, they must of course uphold the decree of Shanxi. Before receiving a formal order from Liaoning, they do not wish to express any opinion against any party. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Liaoning Commissioner of the Arsenal has completed his inspection. Li Yichun returned to Shenyang yesterday to report. The Post-War Coordination Association and other organizations are strongly advocating for the transformation into civil livelihood agencies. They sent representatives Gao Xi and Kong Sui Li to Shenyang to meet with Zhang Xueliang and Chen. Cadres and staff of the factory gathered to discuss the plan to divide the factory into three plants: steelmaking, mining machinery manufacturing, and agricultural implement manufacturing. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Xu Yongchang and the army commanders held talks at Li Shengda's residence on the afternoon of the 28th to further discuss resolving the Shanxi situation. Xu urged them to sacrifice their prejudices and not go to extremes. The army commanders stated that they could only implement the proposals in the clever telegram, which would benefit the people, and everything could be negotiated. Subsequently, the steps of reorganization and downsizing and the post-war arrangements were discussed in detail. Ji Yiqiao and others planned to telegraph Zhang Xueliang regarding the true meaning of the army commanders' clever telegram and the results of the headquarters' meeting on the 27th, or send personnel back to Shenyang for a personal presentation. It has not yet been decided whether the army commanders will send personnel to Shenyang. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Chen Xingya plans to go to Suiyuan to inspect the situation in the next few days. The Shanxi military police will be reorganized and streamlined after the entire army is resolved. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Bao reported that the twists and turns in the Shanxi army's reorganization and streamlining can now be resolved, namely that Sun Chu will serve as the army commander or the road protection commander, and Zhang Huizhao and Li Fuying will serve as division commanders. However, a telegram from Shenyang stated that Zhang Xueliang has not yet allowed Shang Zhen to resign as army commander, and it is said that the army commander is a temporary position during the post-war period, which Shang Zhen does not expect. The Central Government appointed Shang as one of the army commanders for the convenience of reorganization and streamlining. As for the army commanders and division commanders of Yan Xishan's old subordinates, there is no need to completely appoint them as army commanders and division commanders. Even if a few people are left out, those officials should be able to forgive out of their patriotism and love for their hometown. Moreover, there are many people in various places who have served as army commanders and division commanders who have condescended to other positions or retired from public life. It is still hoped that the original plan of Tianjin will be maintained, and after the inspection in the future, if there is an opportunity, further adjustments will be made.

<h3>Post-War Issues in Guangxi</h3>
<p>The Precondition Is That Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Zhang Fakui Go Abroad</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the post-war issues in Guangxi, according to a certain important person from Guangxi Province, the method of settling matters is that Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Zhang Fakui simultaneously go abroad as a precondition. Zhang Fakui's troops will be taken over by Miao Peinan. The entire Guangxi army will be converted into provincial defense forces, responsible for border defense and bandit suppression. A Guangxi Military Post-War Supervision Office will be established as a military transition, directly under the command of the entire province's army, and no other military agencies will be established. The Eighth Route Army, which entered Guangxi, will be transferred back to its original defense. The Central Government intends to grant the position of supervisor to Huang Shaoxiong, but Huang is still modestly declining. It is also possible that Ma Xiaojun will eventually take over the position. However, it has been decided that military and civilian affairs will be separated in the future, and Wu Tingyang, Chen Shi, and others will go to Guangxi to take responsibility for post-war affairs.

<h3>Emergency Law on Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The principles of the Emergency Law on Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China, after being sent by the 105th Central Standing Committee to the Political Council for discussion, were transferred to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan believes that this case is of great importance and that all procedural regulations should be particularly cautious. Therefore, the entire proposed text was submitted to the 247th meeting of the Political Council for revision, and it was also stipulated that its effective time and implementation date should be determined by order. There are two main points: 1. Increased penalties. The law stipulates that anyone who engages in acts such as disturbing public order, secretly communicating with foreign countries, colluding with traitors, plotting to disturb public order, inciting soldiers, disobeying discipline, abandoning duties, or colluding with traitors with the aim of endangering the Republic of China will be sentenced to death. Anyone who incites others to disturb public order, or colludes with traitors, or uses words, pictures, or speeches to promote treason, will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Anyone who is incited by the above-mentioned criminals and disobeys discipline, abandons duties, or colludes with traitors, or disturbs public order, or relays propaganda for them, or purchases or transports military supplies for traitors, or leaks or transmits political or military secrets to traitors, or damages transportation, will be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for more than ten years. Others, such as those who organize groups, or hold meetings or propaganda that is incompatible with the Three Principles of the People with the aim of endangering the Republic of China, or who knowingly harbor traitors and fail to report them, will also be sentenced to imprisonment. This law is a special law of the Criminal Law, and its purpose is to focus on protecting national interests and suppressing counter-revolution. Therefore, the crimes and penalties it stipulates are heavier than those of the Criminal Law usually applied. 2. Simplified procedures. Anyone who commits the crimes stipulated in this law will be tried by the highest military authority in the martial law area, and in the bandit suppression area, they will be tried by a temporary court organized by the county magistrate and two judicial officers. When the trial is by a military authority, the reasons for the case should be attached and reported to the superior military authority for approval before execution. When the trial is by a temporary court, the reasons for the case should be attached and reported to the High Court for approval before execution, and reported to the provincial government for record. If the superior military authority or the High Court considers the trial to be doubtful, they may order a joint trial or send personnel to attend the joint trial. The procedures adopted are quite similar to the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, all with the main purpose of being simple and expeditious. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Parliamentary Questioning in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Japan Associated Press, 30th: The war of words in the current parliamentary session unfolds intensely every day. Today, the House of Peers convened at 11:00 AM. After resolving the agenda, questions were directed to the ministers of state. The House of Representatives convened a general budget meeting at 10:00 AM. Both houses will be in recess for today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>House of Peers Plenary Session</p>
<h3>Yūji Criticizes the Government's Ineffective Rural Relief Efforts</h3>
<h3>Japanese Women Can Learn From the Chastity of Aboriginal Women</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 30th: The House of Peers formal session convened at 10:30 AM this morning. The agenda was changed to include ① the Postal Law Amendment Bill and ① the Railway, Shipping, Postal, and Telegraph Trust Amendment Bill, which were approved in their original form. Then, questioning began. Yūji (Research Group) took the podium and stated, "In Showa 5 (1930), rural income decreased by 50% to 65% compared to Showa 4, while debt increased from 4 billion to 5 billion yuan. The countryside is extremely exhausted, and the government's relief measures are extremely slow. Regarding this tragic reality, it is akin to closing one's eyes and ears. What is your opinion on the plight of the farmers, the foundation of the Empire?" He criticized the incompleteness of rural relief and, turning his attack, spoke about the Musha Incident, questioning the government's misguided policy toward aborigines. He said, "Although the government says this incident was a sudden event, it can be definitively said that it was premeditated. Regarding the cause of the Musha uprising, the government denies the relationship between police officers and aboriginal women, but in reality, this was also a major cause of the incident. The concept of chastity among aboriginal women is worthy of emulation by Japanese women." Upon hearing this, the women in the audience could not help but smile wryly. Yūji continued undeterred, "Regarding the aftermath, Governor-General Ishizuka and others have already resigned, but Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda, who is naturally responsible, remains calmly in office. What is the reason for this? Minister Matsuda and I have always been friends, and in terms of personal relations, I cannot bear to attack him. However, to resolve the public's confusion, I dare to ask the Minister to clarify his responsibility." He vehemently attacked the government's mismanagement for over an hour. Prime Minister Hiranuma's proxy then took the podium and said, "Although Mr. Yūji accuses the government of not taking any measures for rural relief, in reality, the government has been constantly striving to help by adjusting rice prices and providing low-interest loans. Regarding policy toward aborigines, it is a fundamental policy of equality, a traditional policy of successive cabinets, and there has been no change. Regarding the Musha Incident, Governor-General Ishizuka and others submitted their resignations, and the government understood their intentions, so they were presented to the Emperor. However, it is not thought that the Minister of Colonial Affairs should also resign." Yūji still wanted to ask questions, but it was already 11:56 AM, so the session was adjourned.</p>
<p>House of Representatives General Budget Meeting</p>
<h3>Opposition Party Relentlessly Questions the Minister of Finance on Financial Issues</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 30th: Today's House of Representatives general budget meeting convened at 10:30 AM. Sunada of the Seiyukai party took the podium and said, "Minister of Finance Inoue attributes the revenue shortfall of Showa 5 to the global recession that suddenly struck since January of last year. Does the Minister believe that the foreign recession was an attacker?" Minister of Finance Inoue replied, "Although signs of the foreign recession had been ongoing for a long time, it suddenly struck Japan from March onwards." Mr. Sunada asked, "The Showa 4 financial statement already revealed the impact of the global recession. Why was the revenue estimate still made as such at the end of Showa 5? It is truly incomprehensible." Minister of Finance Inoue opened his mouth and spoke of the global recession, and wished to add, "Another separate reason, for the particularly profound impact on the Japanese financial and industrial sectors, was the drop in silver prices." Mr. Sunada further inquired, "The decline in silver prices has been a trend since Showa 4. To say that it struck all at once last year is truly deceiving people too much. Comparing the price of goods in the United Kingdom and the United States with the Japanese index, only Japanese prices have fallen sharply. What is the reason for this? The global recession could certainly have been foreseen. Also, the exchange rate recovered due to the lifting of the gold embargo, and raw silk piled up in the American market, causing the silk price to fall to around 1,100 yuan. These are all natural results. Why did the government uniquely implement the silk price subsidy law? Please, Minister of Finance, reply." Minister of Finance Inoue replied, "The silk price compensation law is a matter for the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and cannot be answered on his behalf." However, Mr. Sunada did not listen, and the meeting was adjourned at noon.</p>
<h3>Speech by Dr. Wu Gaisesheng of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Geneva News: The Chinese delegation congratulates the Preparatory Committee and its rapporteurs for their hard work and thanks the President and Vice-Presidents for their perseverance and skillful negotiations, which enabled the draft convention to be completed. The Chinese delegation views this draft convention as a newborn child: its body is healthy, but its birth was difficult. It has been the subject of repeated discussions over the past five years, six sessions, and continuous efforts. Furthermore, representatives from 32 countries, each basing their opinions on their own national aspirations, participated in this meeting and worked together with one heart. It is not difficult to expect that our people will see a bright future. The preliminary stage has been reached, and the articles have been finalized. The remaining difficulty for us lies in the subsequent votes of the various governments. We must continue to strive to achieve final victory. The emergence of a convention on the limitation and reduction of armaments is a groundbreaking initiative, an unprecedented event in world history. Although the Chinese delegation may have had reservations about the vote during this session, it was not intended to be passive. Rather, it was to allow for careful and thorough consideration of this serious issue, with a view to expressing its views at the future disarmament conference. China is a truly democratic nation that loves peace. A glimpse of this can be seen in the discussion of civil rights in China's Three Principles of the People. China has always upheld the path of justice, aiming to defend against the violent, aid the distressed, and support the weak. After years of internal strife, our country is now unified, and its politics are consolidated. The Chinese delegation's intentions for peace and disarmament are extremely clear and can be conveyed to the Committee and to the Conference. It can be asserted that what I have said today reflects the Chinese delegation's thoughts on peace. The work we have done on disarmament has unique and special value and will undoubtedly be recognized by all governments. Moreover, our moral values are rich. We have this moral capacity, and we can investigate the root causes of war. This is commendable. The reduction and limitation of naval, land, and air armaments are a material means of preventing war. This is the cause, not the effect. If we want to address the root cause, we must seek the moral root, promote mutual understanding between nations, and eliminate barriers between people. With deeper understanding, war can be avoided.</p>

<h3>Chen Jitang Travels to Nanjing to Meet Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, there are many issues in Guangdong politics that need to be resolved. Fan Qiwu, Director of the Department of Finance, has already traveled to Nanjing to discuss with Minister of Finance Song the remedial measures for Guangdong's finances after the abolition of likin. Secondly, a certain important figure also went north to Nanjing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to discuss everything in person due to political issues. Recently, Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, also needs to consult with the Central Government on the issue of military pay. He left the province for Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 26th, transferred to a ship to Shanghai, and then traveled to Nanjing. Those traveling with him included Chen Yinglin, Director of the Business Department of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters; He Shaoyuan, Chief of the Finance Section of the Business Department; and Gao Wen'an, Special Agent. It is known that Chen's trip to Nanjing has three purposes: 1. To visit Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing and report on the Eighth Route Army's operations in Guangxi over the past year. 2. To indicate the methods for resolving the Guangxi situation in the future. 3. The issue of the payment of Guangdong's military pay after the abolition of likin. Regarding the second item, Chen stated to others the day before yesterday that when Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Hong Kong, he sent He Luo, Director of the Ordnance Factory, to Hong Kong to meet Huang and solicit his opinions on the aftermath of Guangxi province. Huang had no important conditions on this issue, but he requested that Guangdong provide travel expenses for Li Zongren, Zhang Fakui, Bai Chongxi, and others to go abroad and that the Eighth Route Army restore traffic on the Fu and Da rivers in Guangxi province as soon as possible. It is found that Li, Bai, and others still have 20,000 troops concentrated in the Liuzhou and Nanning area. These troops all belong to Huang Luoxiong's old troops. As for the method of resolving Guangxi, both he and Chairman Chen have no preconditions and will obey the Central Government's instructions. Regarding the second item, the issue of reducing Guangdong's military spending, Chen stated at the Fourth Provincial Representatives Conference the day before yesterday, roughly saying that after Guangdong implemented the abolition of likin, monthly revenue has been greatly reduced, which naturally affects military spending. The Eighth Route Army's military pay currently costs approximately 4.2 million yuan per month, which is already as low as it can be. The Central Government previously issued an order to pay military pay in silver dollars, but the headquarters has not yet formally acknowledged it,</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>still pending. Once published, the monthly military pay would require an additional tens of thousands of silver dollars in surcharges. At a time of such financial difficulty, the headquarters certainly does not want to increase expenditures again, so the order has not yet been forwarded. After Guangdong abolished likin, the finances are extremely tight. When faced with no other choice, only by reducing the temporary military expenditures first can the current difficulties be alleviated somewhat. From this observation, Chen's trip to Nanjing this time bears a significant responsibility for the military pay issue. It is also heard that Chen plans to speak with Gu Yingfen, who has just returned from Shanghai, while passing through Hong Kong, before traveling to Nanjing, because Gu, accompanied by National Government Counselor Lu Kuangwen, took the Tahu Presidential steamer south from Shanghai on the morning of the 24th and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong today.

<h3>He Yingqin Arrives in Jiangxi to Supervise the Suppression of Communists</h3>
<h3>Lu Dipin Returns from Ji'an to the Province to Report on the Communist Situation</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The news that Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin is coming to Jiangxi on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek to supervise the suppression has been circulating for a long time. Recently, the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Federation of Commerce, and other institutions and organizations have repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government and sent representatives to Nanjing to request that elite troops be transferred to Jiangxi and that Chiang enter Jiangxi to supervise the suppression, as Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Peng Dehuai are becoming increasingly rampant in Ningdu and Xingguo. The Provincial Government has now received a telegram from Lu Lushan, Director of the Beijing Office, stating that Chairman Chiang has dispatched Minister He to Jiangxi to supervise the troops on his behalf. According to military sources, He departed from Nanjing by ship on the 28th with the First Regiment of the National Government Guard escorting him. He will arrive in Xunyang on the 29th, transfer to a special train on the Nanshan Railway to the province, and temporarily reside in Jiangxi, acting as Director of the Nanchang Headquarters, commanding all units, and eliminating the Communist bandits. After receiving the above report, the Provincial Government, in addition to telegraphing Commander-in-Chief Lu in Ji'an, also dispatched personnel to arrange the headquarters at the Provincial Library in Zhongshan Park, Baihuazhou, and to notify all institutions and organizations to prepare to welcome him. It is heard that Lu has already telegraphed the province and is scheduled to take a plane from Ji'an to the province yesterday to welcome Minister He, report on the military situation at the front, and plan for the suppression of the bandits.</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation of bandit suppression in the province, there has been little progress in various areas. The lines from Ganzhou, Xingguo, Taihe, Yongfeng, Le'an, Nanfeng, and Yihuang are all taking a defensive posture of encirclement towards Ningdu and Guangchang to cut off the Communist bandits' supplies and then gradually shrink the circle of encirclement to annihilate them in one fell swoop. The bandit areas are extremely difficult to navigate. Even a slight mistake can be exploited by the Communist bandits. (January 28)</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong's Troops to Depart for Jiangxi at the Beginning of the Month</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuju and Jiang Bocheng, accompanied by Zhang Yue of the Provincial Committee, traveled to Jining on the 26th by armored train on the Taishan to celebrate the birthday of Sun Lianzhong's mother and to discuss the departure of Sun's troops for Jiangxi (and the issue of defense handover between Caozhou and Jining). At 9:20 AM today, Han and others returned to Jinan by the same train. Military and political figures all arrived at the station to welcome them. According to Jiang Bocheng, Sun's troops are currently disbursing pay and preparing to depart and will be able to depart next week. The defense of the Caozhou and Jining area will be taken over by troops dispatched by Chairman Han, who must go there in advance. It is heard that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has now mobilized vehicles to prepare for the military transport of Sun's troops to Jiangxi. (January 28)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Run on the Jinan Municipal Official Exchange</h3>
<h3>Run Occurs in the Morning, Fully Restored in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: At 9:00 AM this morning, a run suddenly occurred at the Jinan Municipal Official Exchange established by the Department of Finance on West Avenue in the city. At the same time, runs also occurred at the Exchange's agencies, Hengfeng inside the South Gate, Fuyu on West Avenue, Hengxiang outside the Pulimen, and Jufeng on Weisi Road. Director Song Fuqi investigated the cause of the run while preparing a large amount of cash for redemption. The Yuanfeng, Chengyang, Julong, and other banks in the commercial port also redeemed on behalf of the Exchange. By 12:00 noon, the number of people seeking redemption had gradually decreased, and by the afternoon, there was no one redeeming, and the crisis had completely subsided. According to the Exchange's Business Director You Futian, the cause of the run was that a soldier ate at a restaurant in the New Market of the commercial port. When paying the bill, the restaurant gave him an exchange scrip as change. Because he was drunk, he said that the scrip could not be used. Ignorant merchants believed it to be true. One person told ten, and ten people told a hundred. Schemers further spread rumors, leading to a run. However, the Exchange's fund is 200,000 yuan, with a planned issuance of 100,000 yuan each for scrip and copper coin notes. Currently, the copper coin notes have not yet been issued, and only 30,000 yuan of scrip has been issued. No matter how large the run, there will definitely be no problems. As a result of today's run, only over 10,000 yuan was redeemed before there were no more redeemers. The Exchange originally started work at 9:00 AM and closed at 4:00 PM, but it has now been decided to move the start time forward by one hour and extend the closing time by two hours to facilitate public redemption.

<h3>Appeal of Cotton Merchants in Jinan After the Abolition of Likin in Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Shandong implemented the abolition of likin, merchants felt a great burden lifted. However, there is still the establishment of the Jinan Branch of the Qingdao Commodity Export Inspection Bureau in Jinan, which specializes in inspecting cotton. The procedures are extremely harsh, and the delays are lengthy, causing all cotton merchants to complain bitterly. The Cotton Merchants Association yesterday specially petitioned the Department of Agriculture and Mines to request the Ministry of Industry to quickly abolish the branch to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The text of the petition is recorded below: "The association reports that its members claim that since the establishment of the Commodity Export Inspection Branch in Jinan, it has only inspected cotton, and regardless of whether it is exported, imported, or sold within the city, all are ordered to pay fees for inspection. Those who do not comply are subject to heavy fines, which clearly violates laws and regulations. Furthermore, the inaccuracy of the moisture testing, the trouble of repeated inspections, the loss of excess samples, and the delays that cause misjudgment of market conditions, stockpiling costs, and payment of interest are all more painful than likin. If there is still no remedy, it will be necessary to stop transporting cotton to Jinan." Therefore, we publicly implore you to forward this petition to request the abolition to maintain the cotton industry. The association convened a meeting of all members and discussed each point in detail, believing that all the claims are factual and the reasons for requesting the abolition are sufficient. We humbly list the errors in the inspection and the facts that warrant abolition to the Director of our Department, not avoiding presumption. ① Article 1 of the Provisional Rules for Commodity Export Inspection states that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce established the Commodity Export Inspection Bureau to improve international credit and increase the value of exports and implemented inspection at the time of commodity export. This refers specifically to commodity exports and does not involve domestic transportation. Since Jinan is not a direct export trading port, there is no need to establish a branch, and it should be abolished. This is the first reason. ② A directive from the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Inspection Bureau stated that, according to new regulations, only commodities directly exported abroad should be inspected from the date of receipt of the directive. Those transported from port A to port B and those sold in distribution markets are exempt from inspection. However, the branch, because Jinan does not directly export cotton abroad, regards cotton transported from other counties to Jinan for sale as export commodities and orders them to be inspected, otherwise they will be fined, which violates the Ministry's regulations and should be abolished. This is the second reason. ③ Article 6 of the Commodity Export Inspection Rules states that merchants who privately move items or change quantities after inspection will be subject to a corresponding fine. This means that once inspected, the original condition cannot be changed to prevent fraud. However, the branch does not wait for the cotton to be repackaged before inspecting it but inspects it as soon as the cotton arrives in Jinan and then repackages it. This upside-down implementation violates the provisions of the previous article, indicating that the branch only aims to collect fees and does not contribute to inspection administration, and it should be abolished. This is the third reason. ④ The equipment for moisture testing of cotton is crude, the technology is poor, and there is no standard for the amount of moisture. Therefore, certificates are invalid, equivalent to waste paper. Merchants often have self-rolled dry cotton that is also stamped with the words 'wet cotton', and no certificate is issued, prohibiting sales. Even if the buyer confirms that it is dry cotton, it is not allowed to be shipped unless it is unpacked and sampled again for reinspection. The resulting losses are countless. It is difficult enough to have inspection where it is not needed, and the delay caused by inspection further increases the burden and hinders the future of the cotton industry. There is nothing worse than this, and it should be abolished. This is the fourth reason. ⑤ Cotton transported eastward to Qingdao is not inspected and is directly transshipped upon arrival in Qingdao, and the Qingdao Inspection Bureau does not order it to be inspected. Why is Jinan alone subjected to this harassment? Moreover, cotton is a major product of Shandong province, and Jinan is a gathering place for local products, which has a profound and significant impact on the development and prosperity of agriculture and commerce in the entire province. However, illegal inspection is used to disrupt it, causing the cotton industry of Shandong province to decline sharply, which is a pity, and it should be abolished. This is the fifth reason. ⑥ At a time when the national treasury is empty, reducing administration is being implemented. Even agencies that benefit people's livelihoods are being considered for consolidation to conserve resources. It is inappropriate to allow the Jinan Inspection Branch, which contributes nothing to inspection administration but harms merchants, to continue to exist and waste national funds, and it should be abolished. This is the sixth reason. The above six points all prove that the Jinan Commodity Export Inspection Branch is unnecessary. After discussion, the association members believe that the survival or abolition of the branch is related to the prosperity or decline of the cotton industry of Shandong province. We have always admired your sympathy for the merchants' difficulties and your meticulous care. Therefore, we truthfully implore you to review and grant our request, and forward this petition to the Ministry of Industry, ordering the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau to quickly abolish the Jinan Inspection Branch to reassure commerce and comply with the law. This would be a great kindness."</p>
<h3>Jin Army Reorganization Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<h3>Changes Possible to the Tianjin Resolution</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The atmosphere in Bingyuan these days is unusually chaotic. The intentions of the various military commanders are still aggressive, while Shang Zhen's attitude is quite calm. After Shang returned, he originally intended to convene a meeting of the military commanders to discuss the matter and then proceed with the downsizing. However, they are scattered to the east and west and cannot meet, so Yang Aiyuan has taken on the task of mediation, working hard for two days, but with little effect. Shang is also listening to it. When the various inspection committee members arrived in Bing, the military commanders took the opportunity to host a dinner for the committee members at the Shanxi Grand Hotel the night before last, expressing their difficulties in complying with the Tianjin resolution. Negotiations continued yesterday morning. Although the contents of the talks could not be fully detailed, it is certain that there was still no good effect. The committee members have telegraphed the situation here to Deputy Commander Zhang, and negotiations can only be resumed after receiving a reply. Yang Aiyuan also hosted a dinner for the committee members at the Shanxi Grand Hotel last night, inviting Shang Zhen and others to accompany him. After the banquet, they talked at length about the inspection issue. According to Shang's recent statement, the military commanders have difficulties in complying with the Tianjin resolution and are not opposing any individual. Judging by the circumstances, there is some possibility of change. Based on this, the current stalemate may have some room for adjustment. The speeches of Mr. Ji and Mr. Shang are recorded below for the reference of those concerned about the Shanxi situation.</p>
<p>Ji Yiqiao's Conversation: Yesterday, a reporter visited Ji Yiqiao at the Shanxi Grand Hotel and had the following conversation: (Q) In addition to inspecting the troops, does Mr. Ji have other missions in Bing? (A) Mr. Ji and Jie Mei (Hu Yilin) were sent to Bing by Deputy Commander Zhang and are not responsible for inspection. The rumors that we are here to inspect the troops are wrong. We are here specifically to inspect the implementation of the Shanxi army reorganization and the actual situation in Shanxi. Inspection cannot be discussed until the troops have been reorganized. (Q) The Shanxi-Suiyuan military commanders believe that the Tianjin resolution is not suitable for the actual situation of the Shanxi-Suiyuan army, and the military system is not suitable for a unified China. How was the Tianjin resolution decided? (A) The Tianjin resolution was actually made through back-and-forth telegrams between Chiang and Zhang. The Shanxi-Suiyuan troops will be reorganized into four armies, with two divisions per army and two brigades per division. The artillery will remain in its old system, and the cavalry will be reorganized into two brigades. This reorganization was determined after carefully considering the existing strength of each unit and the financial situation. As for the army commander system, it was not arbitrarily decided. The intention is to facilitate command. There are army commanders in the southern provinces and the northeast. The reason for assigning Shanxi troops to the army is that the military conflict has not ended for long, and the units should not be too numerous. (Q) Reports say that our military commanders plan to ask Mr. Ji to convey the many difficulties of Shanxi and Suiyuan to Deputy Commander Zhang. What will you do? (A) I met with the military commanders of Shanxi and Suiyuan last night and discussed this point. At that time, because it was my first meeting with the military commanders, I could not have a more in-depth conversation. I could only use my personal capacity to briefly explain the original intention of the Tianjin resolution. As for conveying the difficulties, it is within the scope of my responsibility, and I will certainly convey them. In other words, regarding all the difficulties in the troop reorganization and the temporary situation that is contrary to the actual situation of the Shanxi-Suiyuan army, I will report them immediately. Other issues are not our responsibility. (Q) When will the Northwest Army be reorganized? (A) The Northwest Army is commanded by Song Zheyuan as army commander, and Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhi'an as division commanders. Zhang and Feng arrived in Bing yesterday. It will probably take some time to formulate and begin the reorganization after a meeting. (Q) How will Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun's troops be reorganized? When will the reorganization begin? (A) It has been decided that Yu Dianying and Pang Bingxun's troops will be reorganized into two independent divisions, each with two brigades. Sun and Pang have returned to their defenses yesterday. The reorganization date should not be far off.</p>
<p>Shang Zhen's Conversation: Provincial Chairman Shang Zhen made the following statement to reporters yesterday: ① The reorganization issue: Although there have been various rumors in recent days about the reorganization of the Shanxi-Suiyuan army, I believe that it will proceed smoothly. The military commanders of Shanxi have their own inevitable difficulties in issuing the ingenious telegram. Furthermore, the officers and soldiers have served with their commanders for many years and have made considerable achievements in the past. It is difficult to dismiss them at once in terms of both human sentiment and reality. This is a natural trend. As for Deputy Commander Zhang, in my ideal, all the requests of the military, within the realm of human sentiment, should be accommodated and handled reasonably. ① Financial issues: The Jin banknotes are related to the livelihood of the people of the entire province. I have decided to implement a monthly draw of 500,000 yuan for redemption in the near future. Director Qiu and I have made a detailed study of this method tonight and plan to telegraph Minister of Finance Song of the Ministry of Finance and request the Central Government to find ways to rescue the Jin banknotes. Moreover, Shanxi province has been at war for years and bears a huge burden. How can the people bear it if the Jin banknotes cannot be reorganized? Therefore, I believe that the most important issue for Shanxi province at present is the financial issue. ① Educational issues: Shanxi is located in a remote area with inconvenient transportation. The introduction of new culture is often later than other provinces, and the people's thinking suffers as a result. In the future, in education, we plan to have teachers focus on world culture in terms of teaching materials and also pay attention to material civilization and put it on the path of party-oriented education.

<h3>World News Concerning the Gold and Silver Problem</h3>
<p>Due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver, Western merchants in China have suffered setbacks due to the high cost of goods. Therefore, some want to lend surplus silver to China to stabilize the price of silver. Others want to set a fixed ratio between gold and silver prices to prevent the price of silver from falling. Still others want to use gold coins and use silver as subsidiary currency so that silver does not become a commodity with erratic fluctuations. However, although various plans have been heard, none have been realized. Therefore, the trend of high gold and low silver remains the same. The following two news items regarding the gold and silver problem are also sufficient to show the origin of the high price of gold and the low price of silver.</p>
<p>First, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden stated in Parliament that he did not know of any practical methods proposed to restore the price of silver. He believed that proposing joint action on the price of silver to the governments of France and the United States might not be beneficial.</p>
<p>Second, the gold reserves of the Bank of France increased by 64.1 million francs last week, currently worth more than 5.5 billion francs, the highest ever for the bank.</p>

Soon after, snowflakes fell. Due to the accumulation of snow on the wings, he landed at about 8,000 feet. As the snow accumulated more and more, he had to land. Because he landed on the beach, the propeller was damaged. He then walked 20 miles to Changle and took a small ferry here. On Wednesday, he and the American Consul returned to the landing site on a naval tugboat. They removed the propeller and handed it over to the naval shipyard for repairs. If the repairs are successful, he plans to fly to Guangzhou in a few days. Otherwise, he will take a ship to Hong Kong and transfer to another plane stored there to fly to Manila. The Chinese Navy is now doing its best to assist. The weather has been very bad these days and for the next few days. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>United States Apologizes to Italy</p>
<p>American General's Careless Remarks Affect Italian Prime Minister</p>
<p>Court-martial to be Opened for Trial</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th - General Butler of the United States, a famous officer in the American Navy, is known for his sharp tongue and unpleasant remarks. He has sometimes been unofficially reprimanded by the authorities for making arbitrary remarks, but the general has not changed his old ways. Recently, at a banquet at the Philadelphia Club, he spoke at length about a story he heard from a friend about an Italian Prime Minister. According to the story, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and a friend were driving a car together when they hit a child. However, the Italian Prime Minister did not stop the car, but said, "What is one life in state affairs?" This statement did not attract the attention of the audience at the time, but when the Italian Ambassador heard of it, he denied that it had happened and demanded an apology. General Butler's few words have now caused an extremely bizarre diplomatic incident. Today, Secretary of State Stimson, on behalf of the US government, asked the Italian Ambassador to convey a written apology to the Italian Prime Minister, which briefly stated: (Following Associated Press) General Butler's careless remarks, the US government expresses its utmost regret to Your Excellency and the people of Italy. A court-martial will now be opened to try Butler to add punishment, etc. It is found that the United States government's apology to foreign countries like this time is still the first time in its history.</p>
<p>Churchill Withdraws from Government Scope</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of Differences in Views on Indian Policy</p>
<p>Leaves Party Affairs Meeting</p>
<p>Britain Has No Intention of Joining the United States and France to Save the Silver Market</p>
<p>House of Lords Intensely Discusses Disarmament Issues</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - Former Chancellor of the Exchequer of the Conservative Party Churchill sent a letter to Conservative Party leader Baldwin on January 27th, stating that since the differences between them in their views on Indian policy have already been widely known, he feels that he should no longer participate in the meetings of the Conservative Party Affairs Committee. However, he will still do his best to assist Baldwin in defeating this Socialist Party government, etc. Baldwin replied in a letter yesterday, briefly stating that he deeply regretted Churchill's decision not to participate in the meetings of old comrades. However, he felt that this decision was also appropriate in the environment. Differences of opinion may exist between them on a policy, but the cooperation to overthrow the current government will not be diminished at all because of this. He and Churchill agree on this opinion, etc. In political circles, there has long been speculation that when Baldwin organizes a cabinet in the future, Churchill may not be selected. Now that Churchill has left the Conservative Party Affairs Committee, the previous statement has been confirmed. It is said that Churchill knew that he could not join the future cabinet, so he took advantage of the opportunity of his and Baldwin's differing political views on the Indian issue to withdraw from the government camp, etc. It is rumored that Churchill will soon accept a commercial position.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden said in the House of Commons today that he did not know of any practical methods proposed to restore the price of silver. He believed that proposing joint action on the price of silver to the governments of France and the United States might not be beneficial.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - Liberal Lord Dickinson opened a debate on international disarmament in the House of Lords today and mentioned the Disarmament Conference to be held next February. Conservative Cecil said that as long as international arms competition does not stop, peace cannot be considered stable for a day. The question now is whether disarmament is possible. He believes that it is possible and that there is a truly good opportunity to achieve the goal. Conservative Bridgeman said that the United Kingdom is the only country in Europe that has greatly reduced its navy. He hopes for the success of next year's conference, but the expenditure figures of other countries seem to indicate an increase in armaments rather than a decrease. The spokesman for the Baltimore government said that he agreed with Cecil's statement that the World War was caused by the arms race between countries, and that we must do our best to avoid the danger of repeating the same mistake. He is not alarmist, but feels that hesitation and procrastination harbor crises or may lead to major difficulties.</p>
<p>French Troops Conduct Winter Exercises in the Snow</p>

They had to be fully armed in a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius to practice attacking the Lautaret Mountain path.</p>
<h3>The Existence of Foreign Concessions is a Barrier to Opium Prohibition</h3>
<p>Chinese Representative Bitterly Complains to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 29th - At today's meeting of the League of Nations Opium Committee, British representative Danovan said that the Chinese Anti-Drug Association had said that there was a house in the British Concession in Tianjin that was equipped with machines specializing in extracting heroin from the polished oil of cypress boards transported from France. This statement seemed to imply that the British Concession was not doing enough to prohibit opium, but it must be known that the organization that seized the machine was the British Municipal Council Police, and the one responsible for permitting the import of various items into China was the Chinese Customs. Chinese representative Wu Kaisheng praised the British police for their quick and effective work, but said that the existence of foreign concessions caused delays and difficulties. The director of the Opium Bureau bitterly complained about the imperfect state of Chinese law regarding the handling and punishment of illegal trade.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Zhang Chuansheng Arrested and Beheaded Wu County Military and Police Corps Joint Defense Office Chief Jin Deyang Recently, according to a confidential report, Zhang Chuansheng, a bandit in Xizhuangtang Village, Qinghe Township, Fourth District, north of the city, colluded with Gao Xiaosheng, a bandit leader in Jiangyin, and led his gang to kidnap people for ransom, rampantly and unbridled.

After interrogation, Zhang Chuansheng confessed that he had committed four kidnapping cases, including the Zhang Tu Da case, and had extorted foreign currency for his own use. The two squad leaders immediately ordered them to be tied up and escorted to the city. However, on the way, the Zhang bandit claimed to have to defecate and escaped in the meantime. He was shot and killed by the憲兵. Afterwards, the victimized villagers cut off his head and handed it over to the憲兵 to be brought to the city and displayed at the North Gate on the 29th.

<p>Suspicious Points Suddenly Arise in a Road Robbery Case in the City Zhou A'er, a boatman from the Langchuan Gang at the Wujia Bridge outside the South Gate, returned home from outside the North Gate at about 11:00 PM the night before. When he arrived near the Xiaota Lane on Nanjie Street in the city, he was stopped by three bandits who threatened him with刺刀and robbed him of 181 yuan in cash that he had on him. Patrol Chief Ma Cheng of the South City Police Station learned of this and went to the Zhou's house to verify the facts. He reported this to the Director of the Public Security Bureau, who ordered him to investigate further. There are four suspicious points: (1) Why didn't he report it immediately after the incident? (2) The blacksmith Yang Jinyuan did not admit that he borrowed the money. (3) The刺刀mark on his chest seemed to be self-inflicted. (4) Since the肚帶was said to be robbed, why was it at the well? The Intelligence Bureau has传Zhou A'er to訊究to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Executed by Firing Squad According to the report from Chen Erchang, District Chief of the Second District, and Ma Huaizhong, Captain of the Fourth Police Detachment, of the County Government, two bandits, Chen Latong (name Lin Bao, San Guan Township, age 25) and Fan Jinquan (Shoushan, San Guan Township, age 26) were released.

Immediately afterwards, he took leave and went to the province, while County Magistrate Xu reported to the Education Department that the Director had taken leave without waiting for approval and had taken the seal and left. Chen Hexian, Director of the Education Department, presented the case to the Provincial Government for thorough investigation because both parties held their own positions.

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders High Schools and Above to Intensify Military Training</h3>
<p>School Principals Should Handle Matters Conscientiously</p>
<p>Students Must Not Request Leave Under False Pretenses</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the National Universities, Specialized Schools, and the Education Bureaus of various provinces and cities, instructing them to forward the order to public and private high schools and above to intensify military training. The order stated: "The revised military education program for high schools and above stipulates a two-year study period, with three hours of instruction per week each year. This has already been communicated by the Ministry for compliance. Currently, many public and private secondary schools and above in various provinces and cities are following the order, but there are also those who disregard it or do it perfunctorily. Some allocate only one hour per week to military subjects, while others reduce practical instruction time and extend the study period. Furthermore, uniforms are often incomplete, and morale is low. This situation hinders the progress of military training. It is essential to recognize the importance of military education. The principals of each school bear the responsibility of guidance and should regularly supervise the equipment for military education and the scheduling of instruction time, ensuring that they comply with the regulations and handle matters conscientiously. There must be no more habits of delay or disagreement. Furthermore, student uniform regulations have already been promulgated, and students should uniformly wear uniforms when receiving military training to demonstrate orderliness and should not request leave under false pretenses, which would hinder the progress of instruction. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is imperative to order you to forward this information for your awareness and compliance. This order."</p>

<h3>Dong Renjian Assumes Office as the New Dean of Studies at China Public School</h3>
<p>Ling Shumo, the former Dean of Studies at China Public School, has resigned and left the school. The entire student representative body of the school has issued a declaration. It is also reported that the new Dean of Studies is Dr. Dong Renjian, who has already arrived at the school to work. Dong is a literature and education expert who achieved remarkable results when he served as the Dean of Studies at Guanghua University. It is expected that he will make significant contributions to China Public School in the future.</p>
<p>A Letter from Students to Yu Youren: The students of China Public School recently sent a resolute letter to school board member Yu Youren. The original letter is as follows: "Respected School Board Member Yu Youren, After the school board suddenly decided to accept President Ma's resignation on October 30th of last year, the school was thrown into turmoil. Out of concern for the school, you once came to the school to inspect the situation. The students have always respected your character and scholarship, and your presence at China Public School is indeed for the benefit of the school. However, you are serving the Party and the country and do not have the time to attend to school administrative affairs, which we are well aware of and which you have repeatedly stated to the public. The students believe that since you cannot come and President Ma has left for no reason, the school is without a responsible person, and the future is unimaginable. Therefore, on the day you came to the school, we expressed our warm welcome to you while also pleading with you to retain President Ma. This situation should be understood by you. However, on the day you came to the school for inspection, President Ma returned from his trip to Japan, and Dean Ling avoided coming to the school. The public was in a state of panic, and there was chaos. Our hospitality towards you may have been inadequate. In retrospect, we feel extremely ashamed and apologetic. We beg your forgiveness for our negligence. As for those who spread rumors and deliberately slander us, saying that the students have shown malicious intent towards you, these are just petty tricks to sow discord, which a wise man like you can see through. We need not defend ourselves today. President Ma is a senior member of the Party and an old friend of yours. You know his morality and scholarship best, and we need not praise him further. However, we cannot but speak about President Ma's achievements after coming to China Public School. Since President Ma took office, he has cleared up accumulated debts to reorganize finances, built dormitories to expand enrollment, revised the school's operating procedures to improve school administration, and hired excellent professors to enhance the school's reputation. These are all facts that can be clearly verified. The president's salary is only 200 yuan per month, which is less than that of the faculty and staff. He personally attends to all school affairs, large and small, and works harder than the school's servants. Looking at university presidents across the country, how many are willing to be loyal, faithful, hardworking, and dedicated like President Ma? Therefore, our struggle today is not for the personal gain or loss of Ma Junwu, but for the future of education at China Public School. If the leader of any organization in society is truly responsible and handles matters properly, he will inevitably offend one or two subordinates. Moreover, China Public School today is at a critical juncture of reforming the old and innovating the new, and it is difficult to avoid the pain of 'throwing stones at rats and breaking the dishes.' If this is the reason for President Ma's dismissal, then nothing can be done at China Public School in the future. The Board of Directors carefully considered and highly respected Ma Junwu's appointment, and they should not change it lightly now. Therefore, our struggle is for the sake of retaining the president, but also to call for justice in the education community. You are a senior member of the Party and a great master in the country. You have always upheld justice and been trusted by society. We humbly ask you to understand our situation, uphold justice, and enable the school to develop steadily and the students to study in peace, so that we can plan for the long-term future of the country. Those who benefit will not be just one school. We respectfully wish you good health. From all the students of China Public School."</p>

<p>Small Talk by Bi Yun</p>
<p>Serve delicacies in rough bowls. Underneath brocade robes are tattered clothes.</p>
<p>Hope a single lamp lasts till dawn. It is best to use a small stove to save fat. Ride a horse on a long journey. Fear overwork and exhaustion.</p>
<p>I cannot bear to abandon the worn-out brush. It was once used for practicing calligraphy. I also carefully collect the tattered books. Why not open them on a leisure day?</p>
<p>Leave one or two patches of wild grass. As long as it doesn't obstruct the path. Cultivate three or five kinds of beautiful flowers. This is enough to nourish the mind.</p>
<p>Cats and dogs are fond of sleeping. It is hateful to neglect one's duty. Horses and cattle are fed with fodder. They eat by their own labor, without shame.</p>
<p>Inlaying gold teeth and chiseling teeth. Those who are unrefined are loved, while those who are new are hated. Wearing a flag-themed robe and cutting one's hair. One wants it long and short at the same time.</p>
<p>Inspire heroism. After opium, there are many people with lofty ideals. Dazed sleepy eyes. Beautiful women often appear with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>The higher one climbs, the smaller the view. The longer one is away from home, the more distant the hometown becomes.</p>
<p>Keeping the mountains and forests, one will not lack firewood. If one dries up the lakes and rivers, one cannot avoid sighing about the absence of fish.</p>
<p>Mountains turn white after snow. Envy how easy it is to return to youth. A belt of red trees in the suitcase. Sigh at how difficult it is to flaunt wealth for long.</p>
<p>Su Manshu and the Taro by Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The "Free Talk" section once published my article "Feng Haosou and Frozen Tofu." My friend Hu Lingyun read it and praised it, saying that there was also an anecdote about Su Manshu and taro that could be used as material for writing. I asked him to tell me about it. Perhaps those who admire Monk Yanzikan will also be glad to hear it. Manshu lived in Tokyo and was extremely poor. One day, he had only five small silver coins left in his pocket. The cost of living in Tokyo was very high. These five small silver coins were not enough for a meal. Taro was very cheap in that country. So he bought about a thousand catties of it. At first, he enjoyed eating it, whether raw or cooked, dried and roasted, or boiled in soup, to fill his stomach. But in less than three days, he grew tired of it. His tongue became bland and tasteless. But his purse was empty, and he had no way to satisfy his appetite. The rich lived on wine and meat, making him drool in vain. This went on for half a month, and he suffered greatly. He became so thin and weak that he was on the verge of illness. Later, whenever Manshu saw taro, he would shake his head and wrinkle his nose, and would never eat it again. If someone insisted, he would tell them about his past experience without hiding anything. Manshu was very frank by nature. Lingyun also said that Manshu was fond of sugar, especially Molton sugar. The sugar was stored in bottles. When a bottle was empty, he would leave it under the couch. There were many of them, and he never bothered to clean them up. Once, he ran out of sugar and had no money to buy more. After hesitating again and again, he reached under the couch and took out the sugar bottles. He sold them all to a bottle shop. After getting the money, he happily went back with Molton sugar. He would write books and chew sugar all night long. Later, he wrote a song about returning with a long sword and having no sugar to eat. However, the bottles were not enough to cover the cost. He had no choice but to knock out one of his gold teeth to exchange it for sugar. His addiction to sugar was such that he was known as the "Sugar Monk." It is said that when he died in Baolong Hospital at sea, the doctor found a packet of sugar in his pillow. This is why he was called the Sugar Monk.</p>
<p>Three Nights at the Grand Theater by Shaoqing</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou, Ma Lianliang, and Xin Yanqiu performed at the Grand Theater at the same time. Such a good show was not to be missed. So I watched it for three nights in a row and wrote this record. Xin Yanqiu is one of the four famous female Dan actors. Her appearance, singing, and expressions are very similar to Cheng Yanqiu. Among the three plays she performed, "Yubei Ting," "Yu Tang Chun," and "Fa Men Si," she learned "Yu Tang Chun" the best. It is so lifelike and natural that it is almost indistinguishable from the original. Her "Liu Shui Ban" is especially good. She has uniquely grasped the secrets of Yushuang (Yanqiu's courtesy name) in using intonation and cadence in the essential passages. The play "Yu Tang Chun" is Cheng Yanqiu's masterpiece. It is novel, poignant, and endlessly varied. Many who learn it seek it out from the Gao Ting records. The one who can completely and vividly resemble it should be this person.</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang is having good luck. He is welcomed both north and south. He can play both civil and military roles. He can sing and act. His voice has been great in recent years, like a tiger adding wings. His "Wang Zuo Breaking His Arm" is clean and skilled. His clothes, pleats, hair tossing, and beard movements are all natural and not messy. This is an amazing performance. Although his singing style is not purely in the Tan style, he can still perform it smoothly and freely. If the words are arranged carefully, he can directly chase after Shuyan. However, his trembling when Feng Xiusu writes the letter of divorce in "Yubei Ting" seems to be overdone. Also, using a mesh basket instead of a bamboo basket loses the style of a scholar. I mention these two points with the intention of seeking perfection. I hope Lianliang can correct them.</p>
<p>I watched Xiaolou's three plays, "Lianhuan Tao," "Ba Da Chui," and "An Tian Hui." There are three different characters, three different expressions, three different fighting styles, and three different footwork. Xiaolou's performances are all wonderful. He is truly a versatile talent. Huang Tianba in "Lianhuan Tao" is already a general, so he must consider his status. He has many expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and fear. He must eliminate any fiery temperament. The lines are numerous and difficult, and he must have a sense of proportion and hierarchy. Xiaolou's performance is just right. (Shaoshan's Qiao Erdun, Fu Xiaoshan's Zhu Guangzu, and Chen Jialin's Peng Peng are all good.) Bi Wenlong in "Ba Da Chui" is passed down from Xu Xiaoxiang, Wang Lengxian, Zhang Changbao, and Niu Songshan. It is a unique skill of the opera. The first important thing is to portray the appearance of a sixteen-year-old boy. He must have both martial and elegant qualities, and his stability must contain childishness. There are countless postures when he meets Yue Fei in battle and fights with spears against the Song generals, such as shaking the spear, twisting the legs, and stomping the feet. Xiaolou has inherited the true essence of Xiaosheng in addition to Wusheng. His skill is divine. On this day, he was in high spirits and gave a particularly wonderful and dazzling performance. It was more energetic than his performance in Beiping. Both the performer and the audience felt refreshed. Playing with art has its own true value. How wonderful! The body movements and fighting style of Sun Dasheng in "An Tian Hui" are like the Monkey Fist in boxing, which is known for its small, skillful, soft, and agile movements. This is very different from Lu Wenlong, who needs to be generous. Xiaolou's performance is transformative. He sings a complete set of Northern tunes in "Zui Hua Yin" without omitting a single word. It is solid and steady. All the eight martial plays that use Northern tunes are excellent. Xiaolou is especially good at this. He also performs Wusheng and Jing plays such as "Tiao Hua Che," "Zhuang Yuan Yin," "San Dang Ye Ben," and "Tie Long Shan Na Gao Deng." I will take this opportunity to watch them all.</p>
<p>Violet Watching the Appearance Again by Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Recalling Ms. Violet, she once performed various songs, dances, and Peking and Cantonese operas at the Odeon Theatre in the past. Although she was only twelve years old, her delicate expressions were widely praised by the audience. When Ms. Violet was ten years old, she performed songs and dances in Guangzhou First Park. Mr. Tan Yankai inscribed "Ice and Snow Cleverness." Mr. Wu Chaoshu and Wu Tiecheng inscribed "Yangchun Baixue." It can be seen that she was extraordinary at that time. Now Ms. Violet is fifteen years old, and she came to Shanghai again for her first performance at the Odeon Theatre on the 25th. The scene was very grand. On the 26th, there was heavy snow and a biting wind. I did not go to watch. On the evening of the 27th, at nine o'clock, I went to visit with Mr. Li Xianfang. On the stage were displayed more than forty kinds of honorary medals, flower baskets, and silver shields. The flower light competed with the silver light for beauty, making it even more spectacular. Movie stars Ms. Hu Die and Ms. Li Minghui also came to watch. Not long after, the curtain opened. Ms. Violet sang the Peking opera "Wang Chun'e." Her beautiful voice was melodious and extraordinary. Peng Guoqi, Huang Jinchan, Yang Yanhua, Ruan Shaoping, Li Zhu, Deng Yi, and others played Cantonese music "Hungry Horse Shakes the Bell." The strings and pipes were harmonious. The clappers kept time, resembling the sound of horse bells. Mr. Li Zhu's Cantonese song "Butterfly Cold and Flowers Wither" was sung clearly. It is a pity that his voice was too low to be easily pleasing. Ms. Violet's Cantonese opera "Zen Room Night Complaint" is the most important and difficult to sing. The two sentences "Thinking of this situation, it really suits my heartache" were like weeping and complaining. The musicians played "Entertainment and Peace," and the music was sonorous, making people feel relaxed and happy. Ms. Violet played the play "An Eight-legged Scholar Teaches His Daughter." She wore a melon-skin hat, fake mustache, and a mandarin jacket, which was very funny. There was thunderous applause at the time. The toe dance was Ms. Violet's masterpiece. It is not easy to watch someone dance on their toes, fluttering like a fairy. I came back late at night and wrote this down.</p>
<p>Listening to the Cold Rain in the Night, Wu Ping's Cigarette Smoke</p>
<p>On the 25th of the month, the Wu Ping Music Troupe performed Peking opera at the Central Grand Theater. The grand rehearsal of Peking opera in Suzhou was the most grand this time. The night was misty and rainy, and everyone knew that the weather would change. But the red men and green women still went bravely. Before seven o'clock, the seats were full. When I arrived, it was just in time for Mr. Peng Xiaoqiu's "June Snow." The fire was just right. It is a pity that the prose style is too large and bloated, and it does not suit the role of Dan. Next was Mr. Xiang Shouzeng's "Strange Wrongful Revenge," which was stable and flawless. Next was Yu Yicheng's "Three Halls Joint Trial," which lasted for forty minutes without stopping. Next was the performance of "Four Lang Visits His Mother" by the Master of Songbai Xuan and Mr. Qian Xinqiu, each with their own merits. It was already late at night, so I went home. I was unable to see the performance of "Rainbow Pass" by Mr. Chen Wugang and Mr. Rong Boming, which was a pity. Peking opera in Wuzhong has risen and fallen many times. Seeing the grandeur of this day, it will surely inspire excitement. Will Wu Ping be able to prosper and not decline?</p>
<p>Research on Bathing by Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Preferences vary depending on the water, soil, and climate. People in Sichuan and Hunan provinces love spicy food and cannot do without it at every meal. People in Jin love sour food and put vinegar in their porridge. There is a saying that the south is sweet, the north is salty, the east is spicy, and the west is sour. Garlic, scallions, and chives are also loved by many Chinese people. These kinds of foods, once excreted through the sweat glands, leave a sticky residue on the skin after the sweat dries, often causing a foul odor that makes people hold their noses. Thus, bathing is important. The benefits of bathing are not only cleansing the body but also promoting blood circulation, relieving pain, calming the nerves, treating diseases, strengthening the body, and prolonging life. After bathing, blood pressure and pulse return to a moderate state, and both body and mind feel comfortable. No wonder European and Western countries value it as much as eating and drinking. Even in the cold and harsh weather, they are unwilling to skip a day. Dr. Fei Kunnian talked about the origins of bathing in Western countries yesterday. I will summarize the key points below. In early Greece, 2,300 years ago, Hippocrates already explained the benefits and harms of bathing and its temperature. In Rome, the practice of bathing became even more popular. Bathing pools and tubs were widely set up in Roman palaces to promote the practice among the people. At this time, people did not only bathe in hot water; cold water was also often used. Greek physician Baron von Prusa invented the theory of treating diseases with cold water baths. It was then introduced to Rome. During the peak of cold water bathing, the famous doctor Musa used cold water baths to cure the long-term heart disease of the Roman Emperor Augustus and the poet Horace. The emperor then rewarded the doctor and believed in cold water baths, promoting them to everyone. The promotion of cold water bathing was not accidental. Celsius, the inventor of the thermometer, believed that cold water bathing was a good way to treat diseases and maintain health, especially after sweating. It was best to enter cold water because it stimulated the stomach and intestines and increased digestion. With the decline of Rome, the practice of bathing also declined. In the late Middle Ages, bathrooms were set up in various parts of Europe, equipped with steam and herbal baths. Later, when hot springs were discovered, even more people bathed. Soon after, infectious diseases such as syphilis, plague, and scabies became rampant, and hot spring bathing was completely stopped. The revival of bathing was in the late 17th century. The English doctor Floryer became famous for cold water baths. He wrote books and promoted them among the people. The book was called "Pѕyhroloυsia." It was reprinted six times in thirty years. Floryer said that rickets were common in England. The biggest reason was that people were afraid of cold water, which led to a lack of resistance. At that time, the country rose up to criticize and resist cold water bathing. Only Italy listened to his words, believed in them, and practiced them, which became a habit. Water experts Bernardo and Todano said that cold water could cure all diseases. If you drink a lot of cold water, you will benefit endlessly. When a woman gives birth, placing snow on her waist can relieve her pain. Sangez said that those with fever should be naked and surrounded by snow up to their mouths, shaking their bodies to make them sweat. At the same time, drinking cold water can cure them. When we suddenly hear this, we are all amazed.</p>
<p>Paris Stories (19) Sixth Uncle in Paris</p>
<p>Notre Dame Cathedral</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen the famous film "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" a few years ago in Shanghai should still remember the magnificent and beautiful cathedral in their minds. That cathedral is the world-famous Notre Dame de Paris (the story of the film "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is taken from the novel "Notre Dame de Paris" by the great French poet Victor Hugo of the nineteenth century. The direct translation should be "Notre Dame de Paris").</p>
<p>When I introduced the scenery of the Seine River above, I said that there were two small islands in the river. Notre Dame Cathedral was built on the larger Cite Island in the river. This is one of the most important attractions in Paris. Anyone who has walked along the banks of the Seine River, no matter how indifferent they are to art and history, will stop for a few minutes to admire Notre Dame's two soaring square towers and the huge and solemn temple nestled on the riverbank when they see it. A sigh of admiration will flow from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>Notre Dame Cathedral is one of the oldest and most beautiful buildings in Paris. The current temple was built in 1163, almost 800 years ago. But before 1163, there had been other churches on the site of Notre Dame Cathedral. Its history can be traced back to the end of the third century. So, even if we don't look at Notre Dame Cathedral itself, its history alone is very interesting.</p>
<p>Some people say that the front of Notre Dame Cathedral is too square and looks a bit clumsy. This may be true. But I think that perhaps it is precisely because its form is square that it appears solemn. And it is best to stand on the left bank of the Seine River to see the appearance of Notre Dame Cathedral from the side. The clear Seine River makes this ancient temple even more beautiful. I remember one afternoon, I came out of class from the University of Paris and strolled north along Rue St-Jacques. As soon as I reached the banks of the Seine, I happened to look up at the opposite side and suddenly saw Notre Dame Cathedral standing quietly in the evening sky, which was shining brightly with the setting sun. Its front and side were illuminated by the sunset. At that time, the sky was red, and the water of the Seine was also red. Notre Dame Cathedral, which was located between the sky and the water and bathed in the slanting rays of the sun, of course, also looked red. It was so beautiful that my heart beat with joy.</p>
<p>Heartfelt Warmth (360) by Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: The Art of Staying Young, With Black Eyebrows and Eyelashes; Seeking Immortality, With Gold and Fine Horses</p>
<p>The next day, Ren Peizhen hired a carriage, changed into a new dress, put on a badge she had obtained before, and found a business card with a title. Because she was too shabby yesterday, she felt much more dignified today. When she arrived at the gate of the Vice President's residence, the guards actually saluted her with their guns. She was extremely pleased, thinking that the carriage fare was not wasted. She wanted to put on a bit of airs, so she ordered a little groom to deliver a card to the reception. However, the reception did not pay much attention to her. The little groom also muttered that it was not clear. Ren Peizhen said, "I'd better go myself." When she arrived at the reception, the people there recognized her as someone who had come yesterday. When they saw her, they said, "This is very unlucky. The Vice President left early in the morning." Ren Peizhen said, "Didn't you tell me to come today yesterday?" The reception said, "That's right. Who knew he would leave so early today? There are several other people who had an appointment to see him today, and they all came to nothing." Ren Peizhen asked, "When will he be back?" The reception replied, "That's hard to say. Maybe he'll be back late at night. How would we know?" Ren Peizhen had no choice but to return dejectedly. Later, she called and went there herself, but she never met him. So she gave up seeing him in a huff. Now that she heard Old Lin Daiyu say this, she thought that Old Hua had been very welcoming to an old prostitute, telegraphing her to come and sending her a thousand dollars plus a large piece of land. But it was so difficult to meet an old comrade. Could it be that my business card was not brought in by the reception? Has Hua Zhangfu not seen it? These officials are all driven by selfish desires. This day, Old Lin Daiyu knew that Ren Peizhen was a very famous female revolutionary and did not dare to neglect her. She treated her very well. When she got up to leave, she even invited her to have tea. She was sorry that she had missed a performance today because she had social engagements tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and would still come to sing. After Old Lin Daiyu left, many performers also bid farewell and left. Ren Peizhen also got up to thank the host and left first. This scene had reached the time when the wine was finished and the guests were leaving. As the saying goes, "There is no feast that does not end." In the past, the bureaucrats in Beijing went to the hutongs, played with private prostitutes, and entertained guests with wine. There were two folk rhymes: "When successful, take out paper; when heartbroken, light a lantern." Although the customs in the north and south were different, the situation was the same. The "paper" was what they called a "slip." In the south, there were official tickets that were already printed, and some were printed very carefully. In the north, there were only a few red paper slips. Taking out paper to write a slip was a sign of success. When the wine was finished and the guests were leaving, and the host ordered the coachman to light a lamp to send the guests away without keeping them, that was the time of heartbreak.</p>

<p>Financial Gold Market Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Major Reaction After a Slight Dip: Yesterday, January 30th, the state of the gold market turned from weak to strong, a sharp rise after a slight dip. There was no special change in the morning, hovering around 705 taels. When the overseas silver market reported low prices, people were excited, and the opening price was high. Dealers bought and sold, but not in large quantities. Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongzhi, Fengyongchang, Sheng Yong, and others all made purchases. Dalian gangs and small households sold a little. The exchange rate seemed to be improving, but the listed price did not change. The market was initially stable. Later, due to the low price of the telegraphic transfer exchange rate, especially the Shanghai exchange rate, the buying interest in the market suddenly became strong, and the price rose sharply, exceeding 710 taels and advancing rapidly, which was unexpected. The spot red bullion increased by about 5 taels, and buyers were not rare. Some said that the large bars might fall slightly this morning.</p>
<p>Opening Jumps 7.5 Taels: The opening price of the March gold market was 707 taels, an increase of 7 taels and 5 qian. This was because the price of large bars fell by 1/16, the price of silver fell by 0.86, and there was strong selling interest from the United States. Private telegrams from Beijing also lowered the price by a small 0.25, which greatly boosted confidence. The price then reached 707.5 taels. Because Yu Dayuan, Yong Dalian Gang, and others sold, the price immediately fell by 3 taels, reaching 704.5 taels. Yuanmao Yong and others then bought in, adding slightly to 2 taels, reaching 706.5 taels. The exchange rate stabilized. Mitsui first absorbed 1.565 taels from Dalian, and Datong sold February US dollars at 31.5 yuan and February British gold at a bank buying price of 135,625. Since the shilling announcement was not moved, the price fell to 705.23 qian. Shortly after, Hengxing Yuanmao Yong entered the market, and the price immediately rose by more than 1 tael. Changsheng Yong and others then pursued purchases, and the price jumped more than 2 taels, reaching 708.8 qian at 9:50. After 10:00, sellers became active, and Fuyu Dacheng Yuanxing Yong Shunli and others sold off. Banks mutually traded February British gold at 135,625, and Shanghai sold April gold at the same price. As the multi-price gradually softened, it was reduced by 4 to 5 taels, and at 11:15, it was only 703.8 qian. As Hengxing continued to enter, the price was 705.67 qian at 11:30. Afterwards, there was a slight fluctuation of 1 tael. At the noon closing, the price was 705.2 qian. After noon, there were only a few qian of rise and fall. The announced price was still 766.2 qian, a squeeze of 61 taels to 57-8 taels. The noon closing was 61 taels.</p>
<p>Surging Up 14.5 Taels: The afternoon opening price was 705.4 qian. Afterwards, small households sold off, and the price fell by more than 1 tael, reaching 704 taels at 2:30. It then suddenly increased to 705 taels. Then the flat trading was especially idle. After 3:00, the price dropped to 704 taels. Shanghai and Zhejiang mutually traded February British gold at 136,25. Until after 3:30, the market situation suddenly became auspicious. Yuanmao Yong Dacheng and others bought in. The exchange rate in India was reported as small 0.24 anna, and all firms rushed to settle. Shillings were offered by Sumitomo and Hua Bi in May at 136,25, and it was not easy to obtain them after March 5625. The psychology of the banks was firm. Around 4:00, Hengxing also entered, and the price had risen by more than 4 taels, reaching 708.78 qian. At times, it was suppressed by a small tael. Then, Hongxing, Yuanxing Yong, Fuchang, and Wanxing competed fiercely to purchase. In an instant, the price soared into the sky, rising sharply by 5 or 6 taels, and quickly exceeding 710 taels. The March and April British gold was only settled at 13 halves to 5625, and the spot price was 134,375. People were very happy. By 4:30, the highest closing price was 714 taels, a huge increase of 14.5 taels compared to the day before. It was unimaginable that it had risen by 10 taels in just an hour. After the closing, there was a further change of more than 1 tael, a total of 13 taels to 15 taels. However, the goods were squeezed by 1 tael. The maximum price during the day was 14 taels, and the minimum price was 703.8 qian, a difference of 10.02 qian. The goods were at 707 taels in the early market, 705.1 qian at the noon closing, 705.7 qian in the afternoon, and 713 taels at the closing. The announced price was reduced by 61-2 taels to 51-3 taels. The registered price was 700 taels to 705 taels. The replenishment water was 700 taels in the morning and 709 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Not Much Trading Among Dealers: Yuanmao Yong, Hengxing, Changsheng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and Yongfeng all entered the market. Dacheng, Yu Da, Yuantai, and Wanxing occasionally bought and sold. Shunli, Fuyu, and Yuanxing Yong all sold. The goods were hedged in and out frequently. In the afternoon, Taikangrun, Wanxing, Yuanmao Yong, Furi, Yuanheng, Senchang Yong, Yuancheng, Yuanxing Yong, Dacheng, and Hongxing all entered the market. Shunli, Yongfeng, Yongheng, and Zhifeng Yong all sold. Other firms had different demands, but the numbers were not large. The Dalian Gang was evenly balanced, with a total of more than 2,000 bars. The Cantonese Gang was in a long position and continued to enter 1,000 bars.</p>
<p>The Exchange Market Returns to Excellence</p>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported declines, and trading was quiet. The United States still had sales, and British and American exchange rates have declined. Yokohama and Kobe cities had no changes. The Shanghai market seemed to be tight, but early-morning trading was sparse. Although the gold market has risen, the conditions were peaceful, without much change. The prices revolved within the neighborhood of 705 taels. By 2:30 in the afternoon, Indian Exchange reported a market contraction and the gold market soared beyond 710 taels, so the exchange market was especially favorable. Banks' thought remained firm, and Chinese merchants in the gold business rushed to enter the market. British gold traded in about 200,000 pounds. A small amount was sold by the Dalian gang in the morning. Banks such as Chosen entered the market a bit. Shanghai, Sumitomo, Hua Bi, and others had some sales. There were also mutual trades between the various banks. Approximately 200,000 American dollars were sold by Datong. Zhengjin and Chosen entered the market. Japanese gold was sold and purchased for a few million yen. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold contracted by 1.25, American gold contracted by 0.25, and Japanese gold rose by 0.01. However, the buying and selling prices of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation did not rise or contract. Only buying prices such as British gold contracted by 1.25, from one shilling and four pence 125 to 175. American gold contracted by 0.125, from thirty-two and a half yuan to thirty-two and seventy-five yuan. The market atmosphere has recovered and is showing good signs.</p>

The Reuters telegram and the Electrical Communication Press telegram arrived on the morning of that day were without substantial difference.</p>
<p>Prosperity in the Foreign Exchange Market Under Settlement</p>
<p>General Market Situation: Yesterday morning, trading in foreign exchange was unusually prosperous in the market. This was because the securities exchange required settlement of futures for the current month, the quantities of which were very large. The amount of acceptance by banks was especially high. Therefore, the supply and demand for foreign exchange was particularly prosperous. According to surveys, the total amount in both markets reached more than 6 million yuan, and the amount of settlement exceeded this multiple times. Because of this, acceptance and redemption of foreign exchange were also higher than usual. The silver market situation was still soft and loose. Yesterday's silver market opened at only a few points.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices (Foreign Interest): The buying and selling market for foreign exchange was prosperous in the early market, leading to intense competition in prices. As a result, the difference between the supply and demand was not far off, so it was the same as the previous day, at 7 qian 2 fen 2 li 1 hao 2 hao and a half. The afternoon market returned a little, to 7 qian 2 fen 2 li (Silver Interest). The early market turnover was 0.09. The afternoon market turnover remained at 0.07, a slight improvement of 0.02 or 0.03 compared to the previous day. The banks' listed prices had no market, and the discount was initially 0.02 or 0.0</p>
<p>Last night around 7 PM, multiple Chinese and Western detectives from the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station went directly to the French Concession Police Department's special agency to report that, according to a secret tip from an informant, the suspect Mr. Peng, who assassinated Liu Lianghong, the "King of Flower Associations," was hiding at the Ningbo Hotel on East New Bridge Street within the concession. They requested that detectives be dispatched to assist in the arrest. The police chief immediately ordered several detectives to proceed together, and they successfully apprehended Mr. Peng on the spot. He was taken to the police station for preliminary interrogation and then handed over to the detectives who had arrived to take him back for further questioning and handling of the case.</p>
<h3>Cracking of the Robbery Case in Kaiming Lane</h3>
<p>On the 24th of this month, around 10 AM, a large quantity of diamonds was stolen from the home of Qian Meiting, a Ningbo native residing at No. 25, Lane 2, Kaiming Lane, Luxiangyuan Road, Nine Acres, Nanshi. Detailed reports have already been published in this newspaper. It was previously reported that after the case occurred, Yuan Liang, the chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, paid special attention and secretly ordered his subordinates to conduct a thorough and strict investigation to solve the crime. Recently, Zhang Guangsen and other detectives from the Public Security Bureau suddenly received a tip stating that the robbers involved in the case were currently hiding in the French Concession on Huanghe Road and at the Nanjing Hotel. They requested immediate arrest. Subsequently, the detectives, led by Mr. Zhang, reported the situation to the French Concession Police Department and requested detectives to assist in the investigation. A total of four people were arrested on Huanghe Road and two at the Nanjing Hotel. After strict interrogation, three of them confessed. However, the large quantity of diamonds has not yet been recovered.</p>
<p>Kun-Chang Ferry Resumes Regular Service</p>
<p>Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>For years, merchants traveling between Changshu and Shanghai have been facing insecurity during their journeys. To seek convenience, they have been switching to trains to Kunshan, then transferring to the Hui Tong Lun Bureau's Kun-Chang ferry to Changshu. Those traveling from Changshu to Shanghai would also take the ferry, arriving in Kunshan at noon, and then transfer to the midday express train to Shanghai, allowing them to arrive during the day. However, the Kun-Chang ferry suddenly suspended operations two months ago due to a dispute, causing great inconvenience to the merchants traveling back and forth. It is now reported that the Hui Tong Lun Bureau has reached a satisfactory settlement, and regular service will resume on February 1st (i.e., tomorrow).</p>
<p>Hua Shang Public Bus Route 3 to Yu Yuan Road Opens Downbound Service</p>
<p>The Route 3 bus operated by the local Hua Shang Public Bus Company has only had upbound service until now, as the section on Mingguo Road is partly within the Chinese territory, allowing passage, but the other half is within the French Concession, and negotiations had not been completed. This has caused inconvenience to passengers. It is now reported that the company has been in discussions with the French Electricity and Tram Company and has reached an agreement. The company has begun preparations and is now largely complete. Downbound service will begin on February 1st (i.e., tomorrow).</p>
<p>Transfer of Prosecutors at the Local Court</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office originally had seven prosecutors in addition to the chief prosecutor. Two of them were still candidates. Therefore, only five prosecutors were handling important cases. This court is located in a city with a population of over three million, as well as four counties under its jurisdiction. With a larger population, there is more crime. Therefore, each day, the various public security bureaus transfer cases requesting prosecution by the prosecutors, averaging thirty to forty cases per day. There are also more than twenty cases of direct complaints from the public. Therefore, the workload distributed to each prosecutor is very heavy. Therefore, the prosecutors of the court must be staffed by talented and capable individuals. Recently, there have been many transfers of court officials, and prosecutor Lei Renlong has now been promoted by the High Court to the president of the Wujin County Court. He handed over his duties yesterday and went to Changzhou to take up his new post. Therefore, Chief Prosecutor Liu Maochu felt a shortage of talent and insufficient capacity to handle the paperwork. Therefore, he immediately submitted a request to the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office to select capable personnel to supplement the staff in order to handle the paperwork and benefit the people.</p>
<p>Continued Inquiry into the Bonus Issue on the Two Railways</p>
<p>The issue of bonuses for employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways has been reported in this newspaper three times. It is now known that the employees are still requesting the remaining half-month's bonus, and the railway unions have forwarded the request to the Railway Bureau to be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and issuance in the shortest possible time to fulfill their wishes. However, according to sources from the Railway Bureau, the formal request is still being drafted, and it is difficult to predict whether it will be approved.</p>

<p>Actions of the Tenants in Qingyun Lane</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the tenants in Qingyun Lane, Zhabei, negotiating with the Sassoon Company over the demolition of their houses, the tenants filed a criminal lawsuit. The Special District Court has already ruled that Xing Dingcheng, the comprador of the Sassoon Company, was not guilty.

<p>Golden Performance of Amazing Western Magic</p>
<p>Since the addition of Western magic performances at the Golden Grand Theater in Ba Xian Qiao, the audience has been extremely crowded, with almost no space. Especially the water escape performance has caused a sensation near and far. The method of this performance involves a large can made of lead, filled with water. A person enters the can, and a lid is placed on top. There are holes on the side of the lid, originally with copper rods inserted horizontally. Both ends of the rods also have holes, which are locked with locks. However, yesterday, during the performance, a guest suddenly stood up and presented an iron chain, instructing the performer to remove the copper rods and replace them with the iron chain. The performer agreed to the request. In a short while, the curtain was opened, and the magician was already standing outside the can.</p>

<p>Chu Minyi's Report on Returning from Belgium (Continued)</p>
<p>The Belgian government representative was Minister of Transportation Mr. Ribens. On the afternoon of the opening, he had an important state meeting, so he was unable to stay until the opening speech and returned to Brussels by plane. He entrusted former Belgian Foreign Minister Van De Vyvere to perform his duties on his behalf. During the opening ceremony, Minyi and the Chargé d'Affaires Luo made speeches. Mr. Van De Vyvere delivered a thank you speech on behalf of the Belgian government. After the ceremony, Minyi led foreign guests to visit various exhibits. The guests praised them greatly, and some even wanted to purchase them immediately. For a time, the small exhibition hall was extremely crowded, and the foreign guests lingered, barely able to move. Therefore, Minyi engaged in the promotion of party principles and commodities, distributing French-translated books on the Three Principles of the People and tea from the Shanghai Tea House to guests from various countries. The guests were extremely happy. That evening, a grand banquet was held, inviting foreign guests from various countries to participate, totaling over a hundred people. Mayor Rieles, Minyi, and Chargé d'Affaires Luo each gave speeches. After the banquet, Chinese performances were held to add to the fun. Students from various places in Belgium took on the responsibility, with performances of Peking Opera, Kunqu Opera, dance, and martial arts. Over a thousand foreign guests came to visit, all praising them without end. Therefore, the next day, various Belgian newspapers wrote extensively about the opening of the Belgian exhibition hall, with lengthy and unanimous praise, saying that our country's products this time have greatly improved compared to 1905 and 1910.</p>
<p>(3) The process of handling awards and the awards obtained. After the opening of the national exhibition hall, in addition to assigning staff to take care of the venue every day, the second step was to handle the awards. In order to protect and reward the interests and honor of domestic product manufacturers, Minyi hired over ten experts in Europe and foreigners who understood the Chinese national situation as our country's award committee members, and organized an international award committee with award committee members from various countries to engage in joint judging. The quality of the products was used to determine the grades of the awards. However, some experts failed to attend for various reasons, and some delegated people to act on their behalf, causing the results of the preliminary judging for domestic products to be very poor. Fortunately, in the intermediate and advanced judging sessions, Minyi, accompanied by Deputy Representative Liu Xichang, personally attended, argued on the basis of reason, and guided award committee members from various countries to carefully visit the national venue and explain the value of the various products one by one, which won the praise of the award committee members from various countries, turning failure into success. After the advanced judging was completed, the Belgian Exposition held an award ceremony on October 10, which the Belgian President personally presided over to show its importance. According to the report of the Belgian government's on-site supervisor, the results of the awards obtained by the products of various countries showed that there were only 7,600 awards in the entire Brussels venue. France was first, Belgium was second, and our country was ranked third, with 30 highest awards, 45 excellent awards, 149 gold medal awards, 106 silver medal awards, and 7 bronze medal awards, totaling 337 awards, nearly one-fifth of all the awards in the entire exposition. The recipients of the highest awards in the industrial and commercial fields were porcelain from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, tea from the Shanghai Tea House and Weng Longsheng Wang Yutai, silk brocade from Meiya, Xiang embroidery from Guomei, and Zhongxing Coal Mining Company, Shanghai Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, Hangzhou Shulianji, China Ham Company, Taixing Canned Food Company, and Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. In the agricultural field, they were various silkworm mulberry plant specimens from the Zhejiang Sericulture Improvement Farm and the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University. In the field of art, they were the paintings of Wang Yiting, Di Chuqing, Xu Beihong, Xu Shichang, and Chen Shuren. Various sports equipment and Taijiquan pushing hands equipment invented by Minyi also won the highest awards. Other educational products included those from the Central University, the Liaoning Department of Education, the Lyon Sino-French University, and Zhejiang University, each of which received excellent awards and honorary awards.

<p>To the Editor, Yesterday I read in your newspaper's column a notice from the Tongren Fuyuan Tang regarding rent reduction for the newly built Dexingli houses, which stated that "(The rent for Dexing, Lixian, and Zhizhong Lane houses will be reduced by 20% from the original amount starting from December of the 19th year)." There is a lot of confusion in this. Our Dexing Lane and the Lixian and Zhizhong Lanes each have their own organizations. Our office has not fully recognized this rent reduction notice. We hope to continue negotiations with the Lixian and Zhizhong Lanes. Moreover, our houses were completed several months earlier, and the Lixian and Zhizhong Lane organizations were established later. They are currently making several legitimate demands (such as reducing the rent to 70% and returning the small rent, etc.). At this critical moment, reading this newspaper report may cause misunderstandings. Our office hopes that the Lixian and Zhizhong Lanes will negotiate with Tongren Fuyuan Tang and treat our office equally. This statement is made in advance. We are writing to request that it be published in the letters column. With respect, Shanghai Newspaper Main Editorial Department, Dexing Lane Tenants Association, January 30th.</p>
<p>Dear Reporter, On the afternoon of the 28th of this month, I returned to Shanghai from Beijing. After the train passed Changzhou Station, a Jiangbei lady picked up a small paper package. Upon inspection, it contained a promissory note and a land deed. According to the document, the issuer was Yang Zhifu, and the guarantors were Zhang Baoming and Monk Cai. The signature was not yet signed. According to my observation, the person who lost the document was definitely not the creditor for the item amount, but a poor household in urgent need of money who was about to borrow. Now that the purpose of the loan has not been achieved, and the document has been lost, their predicament must be unbearable. Therefore, I asked the Jiangbei lady to hand over the document to Zuo Guoliang, a waiter on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, to be stored at the stationmaster's office. Please publish it in the letters column as a public service advertisement so that the loser may be able to recover the lost item, which would be a great merit. Yan Hanwen, January 29th.</p>
<p>Lost and Found: If there are any lost men or women, please pay attention to the following location. Announced by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>Youth Corner</p>
<p>Guangmei During the Winter Vacation</p>
<p>(1) Before the Vacation</p>
<p>Whenever the vacation is approaching, it seems that an extra layer of consideration is added to one's mind. Should I return home or stay in Shanghai? The former seems to be a matter of course. I didn't go back during the summer vacation, and my hometown has been separated for a long time. How much are my parents thinking about me? How are my sisters and brothers yearning for me? When relatives and friends see my parents, they will also inquire with concern, "Is your daughter coming back for winter vacation this year?" If I really stay in Shanghai, they will have to emphasize their tone, "Why isn't your daughter coming back this year? She didn't come back in the summer, and she's not coming back for the New Year? What is she doing in Shanghai?" Although they only say this simply, the doubts and suspicions in their hearts have reached a certain level, "What is she really doing in Shanghai? Is she really in Shanghai? Why doesn't she even want her home? Could it be that she's already married, so she can't come back for the New Year?" These questions are not something that I am neurotically fabricating. They are definitely real. All of this forces me to go home every winter vacation. Of course, it's to see my parents, but the greatest significance is to prevent rumors from spreading, ah. The harshness of the environment, the closed-mindedness of the atmosphere, the fear of gossip, three people's words can make a tiger, I know and believe deeply. So, this return home is out of passivity, heaven. Ask my conscience, I would never dare to deceive my parents. In fact, my concept of home has long been weakened a lot. It really doesn't matter if I don't go back for a year. As long as I receive letters from home each time and hear that my family is doing well, I don't worry about anything else. I don't want to buy suffering with money. The inconvenience of transportation, unbearable heat in the summer, unbearable cold in the winter, often freezing rivers and ice water, plus bandits appearing unpredictably. However, because of upstream reasons, and recently, my third brother wrote in advance about my second brother's illness, "... still hasn't gotten out of bed. At the same time, my mother also misses you very much and hopes you will come back." Since reality is showing me this way, I have no choice but to follow it. At this time, the sweet hometown, the warm maternal love, the dear siblings, a complete family, began to play in my mind. The idea of returning home was immediately established. So, regardless of anything, ignoring everything, my whole mind rushed like an arrow towards what I thought was my sweet hometown.</p>
<p>It's strange to say, since I decided to go home, my mind has become even more uneasy. On the one hand, my heart is like an arrow, but on the other hand, I seem reluctant to leave Shanghai, where I am accustomed to living, so quickly. But this time, when I have to say goodbye to Shanghai, there is always an inexplicable reluctance, especially when the whistle blows and the car moves, watching Shanghai's outline waving goodbye to me, the bitter tears are about to burst out. However, on closer inspection, what is there in Shanghai for me to miss? However, I am against people cursing her, cursing her as the devil of all evils, especially those who have never been to Shanghai, just hearing rumors and blindly saying, "Shanghai is all evil, definitely not a place to study." Of course, it is also impossible to deny or oppose, but to erase everything about her, focusing only on her shortcomings, it seems that it is definitely not possible to make such an easy judgment. I believe that whether an environment is good or not is not absolute. Shanghai is not as terrible as most people curse. I love her civilization, everything is developed, the most enjoyable thing is to be able to see the day's newspaper every morning at 7 o'clock. Once you go to the inland, you can feel the cultural isolation and the slowness of the news. In this environment of cultural hub, in the city where all industries gather, it is a good opportunity to study. That's why I only approve and do not oppose, and that's why I am reluctant to leave Shanghai.</p>

<p>Outline of Local Autonomy in Various Countries</p>
<p>Tang Bin</p>
<p>Translated by Wang Jian</p>
<p>In the period when our country's government is actively presiding over construction, this "autonomy issue" is naturally extremely important at present. For example, the Ministry of Education recently promulgated the "Student Self-Government Association Organization Outline" regulations. Although this refers to the narrow sense, the fact that our country's government has paid attention to the "autonomy issue" is obvious.</p>
<p>The term "local autonomy" originally referred to various public administrations within a small area of a country's territory, whether such administration is carried out by locally elected groups or by state officials. When applied to Germany, the United States of North America, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia, the term "local autonomy" is only used to apply to the jurisdiction of groups subordinate to the provincial government. As for the provinces of South Africa, they are based on a more different foundation. If this issue is explored in detail, it would certainly require a huge amount of space. However, the author, Hai Liels, only records the outline of the current systems of various countries and criticizes the actual degree of local autonomy prevailing under each system. Even so, this book, "Outline of Local Autonomy in Various Countries," is already quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Originally, the nationalities of the world are fundamentally different in nature, history, habits, and customs. Any one type of government system cannot be equally applicable to all of them. Even within the same country, the types and flexibility of administrative matters become very important factors. The familiar saying "one man's meat is another man's poison" contains considerable truth. However, in Pope's famous poem, it says, "Let fools contend for forms of government; whate'er is best administered is best." Perhaps the entire meaning of this poem cannot be fully believed by those who believe in local autonomy from an educational and administrative point of view, but Pope believed that substance is more important than form, which is true. However, even with this concept, the study of government form is not empty talk. Form explains substance, and at the same time exerts influence. Furthermore, although it is unwise for a country to indiscriminately adopt the government system of another country with a completely different national and national history, few countries are not searching for some way to improve a part or parts of their political system, which can sometimes be found by adopting methods that have already been implemented elsewhere. Regarding this point, the author describes it in detail in the "Introduction." From this, we can also understand the importance of this book and that it is sufficient to provide a reference for governments and researchers who are implementing or preparing to implement "local autonomy."</p>
<p>The first to be discussed is "France," and in more detail than other countries, because the French method has been carefully adopted by many countries and has had a significant impact on other countries. France initially stipulated a large amount of local autonomy, and its various forms have left their traces to this day. Later, it developed into a form of departmental political centralization (Bureaucratic Centralization). Although this administrative system of Gaul disappeared after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Frankish monarchy retained several of its methods. From the fourteenth century onwards, the autonomy of cities and landed aristocracy that issued charters gradually disappeared. This policy of unifying France has not deviated from this trend even in recent times. Various governments, whether monarchical, imperial, or northern and harmonious, have been equally eager to preserve the unity of France and believe that the only way to do this is to strictly subordinate the entire administration to the rule of Paris. The entire nation is clearly in agreement with the government on this point. Therefore, our Chinese government is also striving for unity in order to seek overall construction. The unit of local autonomy in France is the municipality (Commune). Municipalities have been passed down from ancient times, but their current form began with the Great Revolution. The Constituent Assembly ordered that every city, town, parish, or village community should have a municipality. Therefore, it occupies an important position. The next are the districts (Canton) and counties (Arrondissement), which are administrative divisions between provinces, but are not very important. The Constitution Assembly also divided the country into provinces (Département). The method of electing its "mayor" and "provincial standing committee" are described separately in this book and are very systematic. Other aspects such as the main source of local finance, the differences between the administration of Paris and the Seine province and other parts of France, and the principles of administrative jurisdiction, as well as the administration of several public services such as public health, education, roads, public relief, and police, are all discussed in detail. Therefore, the French local autonomy system is very worthy of attention by the governments and people of other countries. The local autonomy systems of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy are very similar to those of France. The electorate of representative local councils and the administrative aspects are organized according to the same system, namely a "municipality" with a mayor, municipal council, mayor's council, and municipal secretary, etc. The division of other provinces and counties and the sources of finance are not far apart. This is clearly taking the French system. Spain is next, because although its local autonomy system contains several states unique to it, such as its current new provincial autonomy law, which grants increased administrative and financial powers to the provinces, and that municipalities are not the product of the legislature, which are all features of Spain, the local autonomy system it has adopted is more similar to France than any other. The systems of the Scandinavian countries are also largely based on French principles.</p>
<p>The organization of Germany is based on different methods. The basic principles of its local autonomy system are two: (1) Officials and groups directly responsible to the central government perform the duties of the central government locally. (2) Autonomy of districts and other elected local bodies. Each system has its own territorial divisions, which sometimes coincide and sometimes do not. Its system of division, "Local Autonomy Agencies," "Local State Administration," "Control of Local Autonomous Bodies," "District Financial Revenue," "Types of Municipal Organizations," and others are all different from those implemented in France. However, the new local autonomy constitution is still in a very unstable position today.</p>
<p>The local autonomy of Switzerland has French or German characteristics according to the origin of each state. In this chapter, the author briefly discusses some small countries in Eastern Europe, but the actual system implemented under the Soviet Union is not sufficient as a reference for the autonomy of other countries, so the author has completely deleted it. This of course contains sufficient reasons.</p>
<p>Great Britain's concept of local autonomy is completely different from the countries mentioned. After describing the systems of England, Scotland, and Ireland, including the Irish Free State, the author sets up a chapter describing the British overseas territories. Within these territories, British principles are strictly observed, although there are interesting developments and deviations, which is something that we should pay attention to, and the forms adopted by the provinces or states of these countries are very mixed, so the author has to give a general description, and this situation is also the case in the United States. These are the unique points of research by the author.</p>
<p>The local autonomy systems of the countries of South America have not been discussed. As for the continents of Africa and Asia (excluding British South Africa and British India), they do not seem to be related to the author's original plan, so they are not discussed in detail. However, the chapter describing the Japanese system</p>

<p>At half-past four in the afternoon on January 22nd, the football championship team of Jinan University, which dominates universities in the North and South of China, competed against the football championship team of Santo Tomas University, which dominates the Philippine Islands. Before the match, the overseas Chinese community believed that the enemy was powerful and that our side was in danger. It was expected that everyone would rise up and fight for international glory. Therefore, although it was not a holiday, the audience was especially enthusiastic. In the end, the enemy was defeated with a score of four to one, which was beyond the expectations of the crowd, and it is no wonder that they were overjoyed.</p>
<p>The History of Santo Tomas University</p>
<p>This university was founded during the Spanish colonial era and was established more than 300 years ago. It is not only the oldest institution of higher learning in the East, but even Yale University in the Americas is its junior. In modern times, many celebrities from all walks of life in the Philippines have graduated from it, including the current Senate President. In the past two decades, it has been further expanded and has built magnificent and ornate school buildings. Its reputation is on par with that of the University of the Philippines, and its medical school is particularly distinctive.</p>
<p>The Formidable Football Power</p>
<p>The school attaches great importance to sports and has established a sports association to recruit alumni and current students. In 1930, it won the championship of the entire Philippine University football team. In the past, it also had considerable honor in the history of sports. Therefore, when it comes to various sports teams of Santo Tomas, its strength is impressive. This time, it also knows that Jinan University is a formidable opponent and wants to use the entire Philippine University championship team to overwhelm our country's university championship team to enhance its international standing. Therefore, a month ago, it gathered new and old alumni, all of whom were famous in the football world, for a selection and conducted considerable training. For example, three of the five tigers of the forward line attended the Far Eastern Games. Its formidable power is indeed deeply memorable.</p>
<p>The Consul General Encourages Greatly</p>
<p>At three o'clock that afternoon, Consul General Kuang personally went to the Youth Association dormitory to gather and comfort the athletes and encourage them. Roughly, he said that Jinan University football was participating in this trip in the name of a university and had repeatedly won the domestic university championship, while Santo Tomas University also belonged to the Philippine Islands university championship team. This victory or defeat is related to the sports honor of universities in both countries, and he hoped that everyone would pay attention and work hard. After this stimulant, Zhuang Shihong and Liang Shutang, who were injured, still fought despite their illness. At around four o'clock, the Consul General accompanied the athletes to the field and stood in the viewing area to supervise the battle.</p>
<p>The Great Battle Begins, Each Showing Their Abilities</p>
<p>When the time arrived, they mutually selected the goals, and after the ritual of presenting flowers and shaking hands, at the sound of the silver whistle, the two teams immediately made contact. The enemy's center forward lofted the ball into our territory, and right back Jiang Shanqing missed the header. The enemy's right wing rushed forward, intending to meet the ball and shoot forcefully. At this critical moment, left back Feng Yunyou bravely stepped forward and kicked the ball to center back Chen Jiaqiu, thus escaping the danger. Chen then passed to right wing Mei Hongbao, who rushed to dribble and shoot, thinking to counterattack, but unfortunately, the momentum was slightly off, missing a good opportunity. Then the enemy's forward pressed towards our side again, and Jiang Shanqing cleared the ball with a header. Mei Hongbao took advantage of the situation to outflank from the right, advancing with Chen Zhenhe. Ten yards from the enemy's goal, the enemy's left center back rushed up to seize the ball. Mei hurriedly passed to Chen, who took the opportunity to attack, but the enemy's goalkeeper was agile and caught the ball, immediately kicking it out. Our left wing Chen Bingxiang suddenly got a pass from center forward Dai, advanced from the periphery past the center back line, and quickly passed to left inside forward Luo Haiguang. Luo rushed forward, but was resisted by the enemy's right center back. Luo dribbled several steps, stretched his foot to shoot remotely, but because the ball's momentum was too high, he failed to hit the target. Before long, Feng Yunyou got the ball and passed it far to Chen Bingxiang. Chen shot quickly, but it was too high. This was the situation back and forth in the first five minutes of the opening.</p>
<p>General Hei Achieves Two Miraculous Feats</p>
<p>Center forward Dai suddenly received a pass from Liang Shutang, and General Hei rushed to the enemy's territory. Center forward Dai chipped the ball over two backs and passed to General Hei, who attacked the goal from the left. He lifted his foot too hard, and the ball was as fast as an arrow, hitting the left post of the goal. The ball rebounded into the net, leaving the goalkeeper helpless. A goal ahead, the audience was infinitely delighted. This was just like the Battle of Changban Slope that day, a thunderbolt, and the masses were overwhelmed. At this time, our side's attack became more urgent, repeatedly driving straight in. The opposing goalkeeper was also a tough general, using both hands and feet, repeatedly punching the ball out. However, our five tigers of the front enemy took advantage of the enemy's emptiness, and again and again got a corner kick, which Chen Bingxiang lofted in front of the enemy's goal. Luo Haiguang used his hard head skills, although he did not hit the target, it greatly frightened the enemy. The enemy then desperately resisted, and although they wanted to rush forward, our formation was well-organized, and in the end, they did not let the enemy cross the line. Before entering, center forward Dai dribbled the ball straight in along the periphery and was knocked down by the opponent's left back. General Hei fearlessly rushed forward and scored another goal within five steps, for the second record.</p>
<p>Two Fouls Are Deemed Invalid</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, the enemy repeatedly wanted to change from defense to offense, but their hearts were busy and their feet were chaotic. Sometimes, the ball was in front of their feet, but they actually passed it to our side. In the midst of a chaotic battle for ten minutes, the referee blew his silver whistle, ruling that the enemy's goalkeeper had violated the rule of holding the ball and walking more than three steps, and penalized them with an indirect kick. This ball had to hit any player's body before being kicked in to be valid. However, center forward Dai was eager to succeed, and the ball's momentum was too straight, not touching a player's body, so it was ruled invalid. Taking advantage of the kickoff opportunity, the enemy's right wing dribbled the ball straight in along the right side, lofted it over our front back, and was overtaken by Feng Yunyou, who cleared the encirclement. Before long, they came again, and also made an assault with a dribbling momentum, but were also kicked out of bounds by General Ma Er. Although our side conceded a corner kick, because the opponent's pass kick was inaccurate, no dangerous situation occurred. Then Chen Jiaqiu took advantage of the opportunity of a penalty kick to shoot remotely from more than twenty yards away. Because the ball's momentum was too strong, it landed again in the goalkeeper's hands. General Hei arrived and rushed forward to shoot, and the ball went into the net again. The referee ruled it offside and invalid. In the audience, seeing these two goals being invalidated, they were angry and shouted to get the referee out. Last night, after questioning team leader Chen Zhang'e, I learned the reasons for the invalidation of the two goals, which were truly unfair.</p>
<p>The "Crooked Foot General" Scores with a Long Shot</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu, nicknamed the "Crooked Foot General," also intercepted a ball from 25 yards away in the re-battle and made another long shot. Because of the speed and force, the goalkeeper caught it and dropped it again, rebounding into the net. When the halftime break arrived, our side took the lead with a score of three to zero, defeating the enemy.</p>
<p>General Hei Scores Three Times</p>
<p>In the second half, because Zhuang Shihong's injury had not fully recovered, he only wanted to see success quickly, so he took the field despite his illness. When the first half was over, he saw that victory was certain, so he was replaced by substitute Lin Songfa. At this time, our side took advantage of the remaining power of victory, and the strategy was even more brilliant. The forwards and talented backs breathed together, and if the forwards had a chance, they all jumped forward, playing the ball in a continuous style, making the enemy overwhelmed. General Hei got the support from the rear and dribbled close to the goal, kicking it in, thus opening a new record for the second half, totaling a score of four to zero.</p>
<p>A Penalty Kick Avoids a Duck Egg</p>
<p>At this point, the enemy dared not hope for victory, but only hoped that its score would not be equal to zero, so as not to lose its championship honor of the past few years. Therefore, they rose up and tried to counterattack. At this point, our side slightly took a defensive position, only showing off their skills of sending and receiving the ball to dazzle the audience's vision. Therefore, although the enemy had several charges, because Liang Shurong, who was fighting despite his illness, showed off his heading skills, repeatedly hitting the enemy's ball out, with the defense of Feng Yunyou on the left and Jiang Shanqing on the right, it was even more as solid as Mount Tai. And Feng's strict supervision and accurate kicking were all major obstacles to the enemy. Therefore, despite the bravery and skill of the other side, and the right wing Fan Luo Jun Franlo, who had attended the Far Eastern Games, his counterattacks were all destroyed by General Ma Er, failing without success. As the enemy's counterattacks were fierce, our side was also busy defending. Liang Shutang was brought down while fighting for the ball with the opposing right wing, so a twelve-yard penalty kick was awarded, which was kicked by Fan Luo Jun. He tried and succeeded. Although the newly appointed goalkeeper dived to defend, he was unable to save it. The enemy's left wing took advantage of the victory and wanted to attack our castle, approaching and kicking in a ball, which was punched out by the goalkeeper with a fist. This ball was also very dangerous. In the remaining few seconds, the enemy's fighting power was still not slightly fatigued, which was also amazing. When the question arrived and the end was announced, it was a score of four to one. Our army won a great victory. Zhuang and Liang's courage is commendable.</p>
<p>Liang Guanlian was unable to respond to the enemy because his foot disease had worsened, and Xie Quanhe had to replace him as the back. Zhuang Shihong as center back and Liang Shutang as right back, were injured in the second match against the Xianmi Lao team. There were rumors that the injury was quite serious, and there were no good doctors to treat them. Zhuang Xuanheng, a colleague of our school, had been entrusted by the Zhuang family's autonomous association to visit Zhuang Shihong at the Youth Association's dormitory and asked him if he needed anything, and he was willing to help. Zhuang Xuanheng came back and told me that the two athletes, Zhuang and Liang, had quite serious foot injuries and were now having difficulty standing. They were only urgently looking for a good doctor to prepare for the fourth battle (next Sunday). I was also anxious, and accompanied Xuanheng to the Youth Association to meet the football secretary Liang Guocai, saying that there were many well-known Western doctors among the overseas Chinese who were willing to introduce them. In the case of Mr. Hu, he said that he had already been given medicine by alumnus Gui Huayue, a doctor, and that the injury was slightly better, but that he was afraid that he would be difficult to come out for the Santo Tomas match on Thursday. I was very worried last night, regretting the absence of these two fierce generals. Unexpectedly, when I arrived at the field yesterday, I saw Zhuang and Liang as lively as dragons and tigers, galloping between the borders, as if nothing had happened. They were driven by patriotism and forgot all the pain, just like Xue Rengui killing the enemy despite his illness. Their courage is greatly commendable.</p>
<p>The Music Team Passes by Silently</p>
<p>Our side also has a determination to win, as they have won championships in the past. Therefore, most of the faculty and staff of their school attended the visit (because people in the church all have special clothes to recognize). And according to the local New China newspaper, a music team was prepared to celebrate the victory with great fanfare after the victory. Who knows, they left silently. The Jinan lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Bingxiang</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Liang Shutang Luo Haiguang</p>
<p>Xie Quanhe Lin Shufa (Down) Dai Linjing</p>
<p>Jiang Shanqing Zhuang Shihong (Up) Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu Mei Hongbao</p>
<h3>(2) Basketball Defeat to the Commercial Team</h3>
<p>| The Third Match |</p>
<p>A Score of Thirty-Six to Thirty-Eight</p>
<p>Huang Hansheng Seizes Dingjun Mountain</p>
<p>Wei Wenchang Follows the Achievement</p>
<p>It's a pity that the last two balls didn't go in.</p>
<p>At half-past seven on the night of the first month, the Zhenru basketball team played their third match, carrying their previous two consecutive victories, which made this battle even more victorious, and no matter what happened later, they had the upper hand. Naturally, their spirit was even more uplifted, and the overseas Chinese community felt the same way, so that night there were more than 2,000 spectators, most of whom were still overseas Chinese, preparing to cheer and support them.</p>
<p>Opponent Content</p>
<p>The opponent is the All-Philippine Commercial Team, which is organized by the Chu Fa Sales Sports Equipment Corporation. The scope of its players is very broad, not limited to one school or one organization, and almost anyone can be brought in to join. According to the audience that night, three of them had attended the Far Eastern Games. As far as the reporter knows, its right wing, Salvador, is indeed a general who attended the Eastern Games. He is of Spanish-Philippine descent and makes a living by directing plays in addition to sports. He is tall, more than five inches taller than our Huang Zhaolin, and his weight must be more than 30 pounds. Like Chi You in the Battle of Zhuolu in the Yellow Emperor, he has great strength and is good at long-range shooting. Therefore, the team is a formidable enemy for us.</p>
<p>A Hit is a Hit</p>
<p>As the silver whistle sounded, the ball battle began. Our center Wei Haiqing quickly passed to Huang Zhaolin, who was standing under the enemy's basket. With a wave of his divine hand, it went into the net in response, a truly good-shooting general. It can be said that he first struck Dingjun Mountain, making Cao's army fearful. The audience cheered loudly to boost his prestige. Our right back Zhang Qiying mistakenly violated the rules and was penalized by the referee. The opposing left back tried twice and both succeeded. The enemy's right back passed the ball to the left back waiting under the basket, who gently pushed it in, resulting in a score of two to four. The brave general Chi You sent in a ball from afar, and our vigor was slightly frustrated, so we requested a ceasefire.</p>
<p>The Situation Turns Better</p>
<p>After our coaches and captains secretly imparted the opportunities, the situation became more active. Huang Zhaolin received the pass from Cai Rongrui and shot a ball. Before the applause had died down, Cai Rongrui, although his long-range attack was unsuccessful, Huang Zhaolin conquered with an ambush army, resulting in a score of six to six. The enemy was advancing fiercely, and Zhang Qiying shot in another ball from the side. After the enemy's right back got the ball, he passed it to Chi You and shot it into the basket. The enemy fouled and Huang Zhaolin shot unsuccessfully, but after Kong Guangyi seized the ball from the enemy, because of the strong force of the long-range shot, it bounced out of the circle. Fortunately, Huang Zhaolin entered another ball under the basket. Kong Sheyi felt uneasy and worked even harder, and threw in a ball from the left. From then on, the two sides fought, almost like short-range contact, advancing step by step until eighteen. When we exceeded fifteen, the enemy requested a timeout.</p>
<p>Rising Straight Up</p>
<p>Our right back Zhang Qiying also temporarily took a break and was replaced by Xia Zeren. Cai Rongrui got the ball and passed it to Wei Haiqing. Wei avoided the enemy's defense and attacked from the front, scoring another ball. Before long, their center fouled and Huang Zhaolin was penalized, and the ball was also successfully thrown in. The result of the first half, on the scoreboard, the Zhenru team scored 21 points and the All-Commercial team scored 15.</p>
<p>Furious Fight</p>
<p>After the two armies changed positions and started the battle, Huang Zhaolin scored another penalty. The enemy captain Chi You gave instructions and attacked desperately, which was quite successful, reaching a score of twelve to twenty-four, still succumbing to our side. It was said that our side changed Zhang Qiying, forgetting to state to the referee that a ball was penalized. The enemy Chi You took advantage of the opportunity to try and shoot in a ball, thus beating our side by one point. Fortunately, the Filipino right back was penalized for pushing Wei Haiqing, resulting in a tie of fifty, and then a few more fierce battles, maintaining an equal momentum, with a score of 28 to 28.</p>
<p>Rallying to Catch Up</p>
<p>In this fierce battle, the Filipino right back was forced off the field due to four fouls. Huang Zhaolin received the long pass from Cai and Wei and shot in a ball, winning by two points. But Chi You got the ball and passed it to the center, also returning a ball, resulting in a tie again. Our Huang Zhaolin suddenly got a ball in the border area, displaying his means of cutting Xiahou Yuan straight with a big knife that day, achieving a victory of thirty-two to thirty. And Chi You refused to show weakness, and also flew in a ball from the right, although it became a situation of keeping pace with each other, our side still had the upper hand.</p>
<p>Standing on Equal Footing</p>
<p>The war clouds are tense, and time is pressing, just as the red sun is about to set in the west, and the Western army is fighting to determine the outcome. At this time, the Filipino center received a quick pass from the left wing and right back, scoring two consecutive goals. And the veteran Huang Hansheng, seeing the enemy gaining an inch, also relied on his old age and sold his old wares, went straight to the enemy's territory with a single sword, and scored a ball from the left. The enemy Chi You fouled and was penalized by the referee, and was also penalized for protesting, and both balls were shot in by Huang Zhaolin, becoming a tie of 36 to 36.</p>
<p>Final Failure</p>
<p>Although Chi You was penalized, he became even more roaring. He made two consecutive long-range shots, both of which missed the target. Then, because of the pass from the center, he scored another ball in the basket. At this time, Huang Zhaolin got a ball, his heart was anxious and his hands were chaotic, and he actually missed the long-range shot. Kong Guangyi rushed to the basket and launched another fierce attack, but was blocked by the enemy and ruled as a foul. Unfortunately, our side still failed to hit the target. As the final horn sounded, our side ended the game with a difference of one ball, with a score of 36 to 38.</p>
<p>Audience Criticism</p>
<p>The audience's comments can be summarized as follows: 1. Our side is good at close attacks, always waiting for work, but the long-range shots of the day all failed to hit the target. 2. The enemy's passing skills are quick and their response is active. Their high jumps and long catches are all ingenious. 3. Our side is not good at close shots, but has unique skills in long-range shooting, among one or two people. 4. If Mr. Chi's body is majestic, making people afraid to approach him. Because our army's expedition to the Philippines is for the sake of observation, not specifically for the sake of victory, it is specially expressed.</p>
