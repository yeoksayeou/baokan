<p>對政治總報告之說明</p>
<p>（南京）　蔣主席政治總報告演說詞、主席各位代表同志、關於國民政府的政治總報告、今日已有三册印刷品、分發給大家、其第一册是屬於軍事事件、因國民政府自成立以來、所有重大事件、幾乎十分之八、是軍政事項、所以把軍事的報告、</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>列在第一、其次是關於行政事項、如内政·外交·財政·主計·實業·敎育·交通·鐵道·蒙藏·禁烟等、以及立法院·司法院·考試院·監察院、各方面、都有詳細的說明、關於行政院部份、就是剛才所提出、外交方面的案子、也都包括在内、要是詳細說來、原文很長、今天時間不夠、所以祇得從簡、但如果各位整閱之後、認有責問處、無論外交或内政方面的事項、外交部長内政部長或院長、都可出席說明的、本席現在所要說的、並不在總報告之内、祇就我們政治的要點、諸如設施的如何、以及將來進行的辦法、來簡單報告一下、我們現在要講政治總報告、要先明白我們政府的基礎、以及現在政治工作集中的基點、要講政治的基礎、就要先明白我們政治產生的地方、和我們政治政策的出發點、現在我們國民政府一切政策的出發點、就是根據總理建國大綱所規定的、在座諸位、對建國大綱一書、想必看得很詳細、無容本席多說、但是本席今天所要講明白的一點、就是在建國大綱之外的一篇序文、凡是我們要讀建國大綱的、必須先看這一篇序文、才可以明白他的價值、了解他的精神、關於建國大綱的序文、現在由本席分段讀一下、「國民政府建國大綱自序、自辛亥革命以至於今日、所獲得者、僅中華民國之名…、以期同志曁國民之相與了解」、這一段、說明革命之目的、要實行三民主義、而要實行三民主義、必須有方法有步驟、方可循序漸進、以底於成、「辛亥之役、數月以内、即推倒四千餘年……以爲可以奠民國之基礎、而不知乃適得其反」、這幾句話、就是說、在辛亥革命之後、未嘗依照總理的計劃去做、以致三民主義的實施、茫無頭緒、這是我們過去在革命程序上、最大的毛病、「論者見臨時約法施行之後、不能有益於民國、甚至並臨時約法之……則綱紀蕩然、禍亂相尋、又何足怪」、這一段講約法的效力、講後很明白、於此也可見總理對約法意見如何了、「本政府有鑒於此、以爲今後之革命、當賡續辛亥未完之緒而力矯……所謂本末先後、秩然不紊者也、」這一段說明建國大綱以掃除障礙爲革命之開始工作、以完成革命爲建設、總理對於革命、主張分本末先後、總理平常訓導我們、對政治哲學及政治建設、有兩重要點、世界上無論那一國有這樣大這樣深這樣遠的、這是一個什麽政治哲學呢、第一、就是「大道之行也、天下爲公」的一段、及還有一條、也是總理最注重的、歎息我們中國人、不知道自己有很好的東西、不注意到從前中國固有很好的政治哲學、就是大學裏云的、凡是治政治的人、所最要注重的、大學上所載的話是半科學的、以首篇說「物有本末、事有終始、分所先後、則近道矣」、又說、「古之欲明明德於天下者、先治其國、欲治其國者、先齊其家、欲齊其家者、先修其身、欲修其身者、先正其心、欲正其心者、先誠其意、欲誠其意者、先致其知、致知在格物、物格而後致知、……」以至於治國平天下、這完全是用科學方法講政治的、總理就是拿這一件寳貝、做一生最偉大高尙的政治理論、這是各國皆無、中國獨有的、在座諸同志、對總理主義及著作、一定都有過詳細的研究、要知道總理爲什麽必以「本末先後」特别提出來敎導我們呢、就是因爲我們政治智識太差、太不知本末先後的次序、往往有些事本末倒置、應該先做的、却擱置不做、應該後做的、却拿來先做、毫無科學方法與步驟、因此政治落後、經濟落後、不能和各國並肩了、總理指導我們要特别重視此數點、就是要我們辦政治、要分本末先後、要合於科學方法、政治方有進步的希望與可能、「夫革命爲非常之破壞、…所歷者皆爲坦途無顚蹶之虞」、這一段内有幾句話、要請各位格外注意、所謂人民權利與人民幸福、當務其實、不要徒鶩虛名、但求好看、我們這幾年來、政治的缺點、就是在徒鶩虛名、不求實際、究竟做得怎樣、恒置之不問、所以我們這次約法草案、也就是注重在實際方面的、現在已到訓政時代、决不能再與軍政時代一樣、軍政時期、往往就是預定了種種政策、每因軍事障礙、不依照計畫進行、然此時期、不能進行、人民或當能諒解、以爲政府不先掃除叛變軍隊、是不能給國民謀幸福和權利的、但是現在旣已到了訓政時期、我們所定的行政計劃、就不能和軍政時代一樣、無論在約法上或平時政令上、甚至講一句話、都要切實去做、有一個字做到一個字、就是我國一句成語、所謂實事求是的便是、所以這一次約法問題、我們也是注重總理兩句話、「凡事當務其實、不當徒襲其名」、這樣必照步驟逐漸進行、才可以使人民遵守、及政府遵守、「爲民國計、爲國民計…兹將建國大綱第十五條開列於左」、這是總理親自爲建國大綱寫的序文、我們應當格外注意閱讀、才是本席在致開會詞的時候、對於政治報告的缺點、和政治現狀、已經講明詳細的情形、在今天所發的印刷品内、也已具備、現在祗可以略、不再贅述、請各位原諒、此外還有一點、在政治報告時、要附帶說明的、就是政治和黨的關係、我們如明瞭此一點、昨天各代表對約法所提出的問題、也許可以解决一部分、我們知道無論那一國的政府、不是單純的、不是在表面上看、就可了事、要處理一國的政治、在内部一定有很複雜和微妙的組織與系統、我們中國的國民政府、也是如此、這種道理、爲時間所限、不能詳細解釋、現在祗可用比喩來說明、稚暉先生對我們政治系統的關係、常拿共和民主國家的成例來比擬、說明很簡單明瞭、他說中國國民黨、在訓政時間</p>
<p>中國國民黨在訓政時期、是一個最高的機關、中國國民黨裏面、有一個中央政治會議、就好像共和民主國家的議會、是一個最高的立法機關、現在一般人往往對國府五院中的立法院、以爲是國家的最高立法機關、無論什麽法律案、都經由立法院通過後、才能有效、才能由政府去發布施行、不知立法院所通過的重要法律案、更須由中政會議决定原則、一定、根據中政會議的原則、立法院才可通過法律案、所以中央執行委員會政治會議、才是最高的立法和政治指導機關、而國府只是在黨的指導下一個最高的行政執行機關、我們如不明瞭這一點、就以爲國府總攬中華民國之治權、一切宣戰媾和締結條約、以及預算决算、都由國府掌理、其實這些問題、一定先由中國國民黨中執委會交給中央政治會議决定原則、待中政會議把原則决定後、才能由國府各院部會去公布施行、所以中國國民黨和國府的關係、並不是隔斷的、一切權力、全操於中國國民黨、由中國國民黨决定以後、才交國府去施行、没有一件事、可以經國府自由去行動、不過這一點意思爲什麽在約法裏面、没有很顯著的規定、爲什麽除了訓政綱領一章外、没有中國國民黨的字樣、這在起草時、實在經過很詳密的考慮、各位對於各國的憲法、一定很有研究、我們看無論那一個國家、凡是運用政治的力量、一定不在根本大法内、詳細的規定、所以我們在約法内、除了訓政綱領外、就都省略了、我們如果了解這一層意思、可知中國國民黨和國府間、關係非常密切、非常融洽、無待有條文的規定、本席還須拿政治總報告總結中的一段話、作爲現在口頭報告的結論、「至於各項事業之將來計劃、已各從其類、分述於前、固可無庸再陳、免涉煩凟、雖然政府於此、猶以爲物有本末、事有終始、建國之道、造端必宏、關於根本大計、誠有不能不明白揭櫫、以與國内賢豪共爲商榷者、今試鄭重申述如下、國家政治、本以與時俱進爲原則、充其所至、原無止境、而我總理貽謀建國、劃分三期、由軍政而訓政而憲政、憲政時期之規模、全在訓政時期有以裕其始而植其基、政府承中國國民黨付託之重、全國人民屬望之殷、治權所寄、責任匪輕、一切措施、何能狃於目前、漫無歸宿、是必圖其遠者大者於戢暴勝殘之後、立久安長治之規、計日呈功、勿忘勿助、庶足以明訓政之綱領、而樹憲政之先聲、當第一次全國代表大會宣言時、規定對内政策十五項、對外政策六項、認爲黨綱之最小限度、現值軍事告終、訓政實施之際、政府總攬治權、矢必循此途徑、淬厲奮發、次第求其實現、如再歸納言之、則曰、對内以促進地方自治爲中心、其他各項、皆當附麗於此、以次相及而未敢稍弛焉、對外以取消不平等條約爲中心、其他各項、亦皆當附麗於此、以次相及、而未敢稍弛焉、總理有言、政府要有能、人民要有權、在此訓政期限以内、所有上述對内對外各項政策、政府自當奉爲圭臬、督率所屬各機關、盡其能以赴之、而於人民尤當本天下爲公之訓、實地予以指導及訓練、統一其意志、擴張其力量、增進其地位、固結其團體、日漸月　、使得達於行使四權運用自如之境、蓋就目前之責任言、因以完成訓政爲要、而就將來之正鵠言、則以建立憲政爲歸、政府之自勵者在此、即與全國民衆共見者亦在此、掬誠報告、幸埀察焉、」最後又想到今天五月九日、是中華民國最大的國恥紀念日、剛才全體代表、對於臨時提議的廢除不平等條約提案、已經全塲一致通過、以大會名義發表宣言、這是國民會議最大的精神、也是召集這次國民會議最重要的意義、不過我們不怕不平等條約不取消、祇怕我們國内自己不爭氣、現在中國受帝國主義不平等條約的束縛、好像有許多練條、團團圍住、我們要去解除、當然不是一件容易事、一定要費很大力量、才能夠達到目的、但我們要表示這種力量、就非我們自己能自立自强不可、如果不能自强自立、就是天天高呼取消不平等條約、還是假的、國民政府現在規定六年的計劃、實在不算一回事、但我們相信、如果在六年之内、眞能實實在在做到這個計劃、不平等條約、一定可以取消、中國古語所謂、十年生聚、十年敎訓、現在我們要全國國民、一致擁護國民政府、照六年計劃三年生聚三年敎訓、就可以取消一切不平等條約、就可以達到我們的目的了、（九日專電）</p>

<p>共食制與肺癆</p>
<p>中國當代大醫學家余雲岫先生述</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>共食之制。中國到處有之。南方尤甚。方丈一案。圍坐七八人。餚饌雜陳。盃箸交錯。家人父子。和氣圍聚。賓朋主客。醉飽俱至。非不煦煦然親暱而周至也。然而疾病傳染之鴆媒。即在乎此。其冒犯危險。與踏白刃赴湯火。無以異也。聞者疑吾言乎。請舉肺癆以爲說。肺癆之爲病也。雖醫學發達如今日。苟病勢稍進者。幾不能保其必愈。一經診定則生死莫卜。此固人人所聞之而色變。避之惟恐不速者也。然而蔓延日廣。罹者日衆。畏之而不能免。避之而無所逃。豈眞有死生之命。懸於大哉。亦其知識不足。習尙未善。而防之不得其道也</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>天肺癆之爲病。爲由細菌傳染而成。德國考克博士發明肺癆菌以來四十餘年矣。世界學者。舉無異議。千古神奸。豁然呈露。方之禹鼎。功不在下。至於今日。婦孺皆知。憒憒者獨我舊俗耳。其爲菌也。長不及萬分珊知米突之十五。闊不及萬分珊知米突之五。以千倍顯微鏡窺之。僅如短髭。無足。不能以行也。無尾不能以游也。無羽翼不能以飛翔也。俗謂癆瘵由虛損而成。又謂肺蟲靈物。病人將死。飛遁而出。傳附他人者妄也。而紫庭追癆方。且圖其六代之形。王肯堂證治準繩採之。要皆彷彿相像之辭。四庫提要所以語怪之譏也。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>肺癆菌之入於肺中也。發育生長。繁殖醜類。故肺癆病人。咳唾之痰。多有此菌。雜居其中。甚者一微塵痰沬。包涵癆菌之數。多至數千百頭。此以顯微鏡檢之。歷歷可數。非空言恫脅也。準此而推。一口之痰。其中癆菌之微。何止幾億萬頭。以包藏幾億萬頭癆菌之痰。由肺中而唾諸外界。必經喉舌沾唇齒而後出。然則包藏癆菌之痰沬。其污染於病人喉舌唇齒間者。不知有幾微塵。而痰中癆菌之蟻附於病人喉舌唇齒間者。爲數之多。何堪設想。盃箸之屬。一經肺癆病人之口之接觸。被其包涵癆菌之痰所污染者。不知有幾微塵。而痰中癆菌之僕緣於盃箸間者。爲數之多。何堪設想。席上餚饌。一般病人下箸。其包涵癆菌之痰沬。足以污染餚饌者。不知有幾微塵。而痰中癆菌。緣附浮游於餚饌中者。爲數之多。又何堪設想。同席之人。貿然不察。而用其盃箸。而食其唾餘。是吞癆菌也。</p>

<p>嗟呼。患肺癆者。而爲賓客寄食之人。則一二次之共食。或可幸免於傳染。若爲家人父子同居共業之人。朝夕與處。每飯必共。是日二三餐。取癆菌而吞之也。欲求其不傳染。豈可得乎。故吾曰其冒犯危險。與踏白刃赴湯火。無以異也。其偶有不被傳染者。或有特别之體質關係。直幸而免耳。曷足恃乎。雖肺癆之傳染。多在於呼吸之氣。而入口之飲食。亦取禍之道也。然則共食之制。乃日取肺癆細菌。以饜無病者之制也。豈非陋習。豈非知命者所宜悚然知戒。豈非仁人君子。所當大聲疾呼而痛革之哉。中國肺癆病人之多。實堪驚愕。蕩蕩洪水。不知汛濫之所極。亦亡國弱種之源也。有心世道者。亦於習俗改良之點。知所措意乎。（此文由余氏醫述轉載）</p>

<p>肺癆病最新醫療法</p>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌，而此菌一入人體内，則於該處，便成結節，以斷血行之路，又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質，包圍其體，以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入，故雖用種種殺菌藥，内服或注射，終不能達其病菌之實體内，歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法，對症療法，理學的療法，血淸療法，藥劑療法，及其他一切治療法等，尙未完全成功，而肺病無藥之說，遍滿於一世者，因未知此深奥學理故耳，由此現代結核學者，根據上述之學理，繼續研究，不遺餘力，結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑，名曰三那星Ｓanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者，據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告，此藥有滲透肺病竈之結節及溶解蠟質之作用，兼具有殺菌力，能根治一二三期之肺癆，確有萬試萬靈之特效，在中國，業經國民政府中　衛生試驗所化驗，藥性和平無毒，絕無任何副作用，兹略舉醫治作用於下，</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中，實驗「三那星」之藥力作用，則一分鐘後，結核菌皆消失其抗酸性，至三分鐘後，則此肺結核菌，完全殺盡，無一倖免，</p>
<p>（二）依動物試驗，則發見「三那星」能滲入結核病竈内，設檢查其病竈内潛伏之結核菌，則盡失其抗酸性，此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣，</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服「三那星」一星期左右，則立見咯痰稀釋，體熱下降等良好狀態，</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三那星」達三十天至六十天以上，則顯見體重增加，食慾激進，一切症狀，逐漸緩和，終達其回天再造之偉功，</p>

<p>家庭情况　李宗侃、字叔陶、河北人、年三十一歲、爲國府中央監察委員李煜瀛氏之胞侄、留學巴黎、我國著名郵票大王皖人周今覺之東床也、李自幼得工科學位、兩歲前返國、旋被四川路一一二號大方建築公司聘爲工程師、闢寓於法租界勞神父路沿馬路五八四號、闔家除李之夫婦並一兩週男孩外、餘僅傭僕三人、及於一月前新雇之汽車夫通州人梁小弟、</p>
<p>日常生活　李因職務冗繁、曾於兩年前、購置一轎式汽車以代步、租界號碼爲二七一零號、李每日早晨八時起身、稍事進食後、約九時許、即赴行辦公、正午十二時返寓進餐、二時復至公司、夜晚六時方歸、風雨無間習以爲常、每逢星期休假、方獲暇至福開森路三九三號乃叔處、或往西摩路一四一號乃岳家、</p>
<p>綁匪突來　昨晨李八時起身、盥洗進點後、時已九時十分、汽車夫梁小弟、早已備車專候、稍頃、李從容出門、步入車廂、詎汽車夫正擬踏動引擎之際、忽由道旁竄出綁匪六人、三匪在前、三匪殿後、前三匪中有一身着元色綢袍者、將手槍抵於汽車夫之腰際、禁勿聲張、並迫令下車、當時李目覩情形、明知遇匪、乃故示鎭靜、一手緊握車門銅環、猛力向外推去、一躍而出、</p>
<p>危險萬狀　李躍出車後、拔步向隔壁弄内飛奔、逃入弄底五百九十六號一法人住宅内、詎殿後之匪、竟膽敢持槍緊追而入、直追抵院落中、適當時該屋主人外出、大門嚴扃、祇有僕從數人守戶、其時李無路可避、竟被匪所執、雙方掙扎良久、李乃大聲呼援、待鄰人聞警畢集、兩匪方始釋手、逃遁無踪、結果、李之頸部及衣領、被匪攫破、所幸匪未及開槍、故未受重創、然晴天霹靂、驚魂亦足消受矣、</p>
<p>兩嫌疑犯　同時李之家屬、亟用電話飛報法捕房、俄頃、探捕齊至、四出追捕、直追至盧家灣電車公司附近、截獲與匪服式相同之嫌疑兩人、帶入捕房候訊、一面由包探數人、將李護送至福開森路中委李石曾住宅、探等並陪同李在李宅午餐、至三時許、復伴送至北站、李隨乘三時十五分快車赴京休養、</p>

<p>春魚續到　春魚船昨日因天和風順、已有傅利增顧發順金同茂永興順金源泰金合順王福順金和源等數十艘、先後進口、停泊藴藻浜、頓現帆牆林立之氣象、售價仍照前日内地客家魚販等、購者頗爲擁擠、均由寳豐·萃盛愼泰·三魚行經銷、</p>
<p>當局保護　吳淞漁汛、乃一年之大宗營業、市面頓形熱鬧、不免有宵小混入、故水陸各當局、在此漁汛期内加意保護、如吳淞口由水警四區巡弋黄浦江藴藻浜一帶、由緝私大隊長李虎臣·水巡隊長丁小屏·負責保護、外馬路由公安第七區加派崗位維持、</p>
<p>海盜勒捐　各漁船放洋時、仍有海盜勒捐旗照、價格每船捐五十元或百元不等、繳捐後、即由匪方給旗、一面可以在海面行駛、否則必遭擄架或焚船之禍、近經水警四區大舉痛剿後、始稍歛跡</p>

<p>敎育消息討論</p>
<h3 id="c142">再論兒童讀物 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>（附答吳研因先生）尙仲衣（一）</p>
<p>此次中華兒童敎育社在滬舉行年會時、仲衣提出兒童讀物的討論、時短意長、未能盡所欲言、兹特專就「童話」一項、（包括神仙物語以及其他幻想的故事）傾懷一述、以就正於諸同志、</p>
<p>當兒童正在發育、正要認識實在的環境、體察自然的現象的時候、負責引導他的成人們、除非另有充分的理由、不應給他一種與自然現象有所衝突的觀念、世上本無神怪、鳥獸本不能作人言、所以除另有充分的理由之外、兒童讀物中、也就不應含有這種與自然事理相違背的材料、「另外有無充分的理由」即是全局的關鍵、也就是童話取捨的標準、今且就童話的價值、試給以審愼的估定、試看有無理由以維持它在兒童讀物的位置、若有理由、再試看其是否充足、</p>
<p>「童話價值之估定」</p>
<p>（一）啟發想像　因爲童話流傳已久、多數人因循陳軌、從不談起它的價值問題、即使偶爾談判、又被「啟發想像」四字堵住了、所以直至今日、童話還能維持它在兒童讀物中的重要地位、占兒童閱覽時間之大部、「啟發想像」我們固難證明其必不能、然恐亦難確定其果能、在或能或不能之間、我們尙有三點疑問、</p>
<p>（一）科學藝術中有組織的、創造式的想像、ＣreativeImagination是與離奇的想入非非的幻想Ｒeverie相同嗎、（二）若不相同、神仙幻想故事所能引起的是近乎那一種、（三）若果相同、若幻想就是生產創造的想像、兩千年前傳說的長桑絕技、何以不實現於道地的中國、而實現於德國的Ｘ光線、</p>
<p>在這種境况之下、雖不能說童話絕不能啟發想像、但我們確信科學故事及自然讀物的激發想像的能力决不在童話之下、科學故事中的戡天縮地奇法、縱使哪吒現世、安徒生的傀儡們誕生、也必得甘拜下風、自然讀物中之生物界的種種驚人的適應環境方法、對僅僅能七十二變的孫悟空、也恐要莞然一笑、</p>

<p>跳舞熱的丈夫和跳舞熱的妻子。應當像一隻馬戲塲中跳舞的熊一樣。要用鐵練把他繫住。</p>
<p>舊式的女子。像舊式的木器。假使你用得仔細。可以終身不壞。而摩登的女性則像市上流行着的汽車。冒牌的很多。而又不經用。</p>
<p>一個女人可以愛他的丈夫頭上任何一根頭髮。可是在他衣襟上發見的頭髮。則多少要發生一點疑問。</p>
<p>凡是他所能彀做的。他自已去做。凡是他所不能彀的。他就去敎人家</p>
<p>靑年人可以寬恕人家而不寬恕自己。年老人則可以寬恕自己隨便什麽。而决不會寬恕人家。</p>
<p>事業之成功。决不能附有條件。有條件的是妥協而不是成功。</p>
<p>長時期的快活。可使其人感到莫大的痛苦。</p>
<p>不自信者不能信人。</p>
<p>有理性的人。依隨着環境走没理性的人。要使環境來依隨他自己。所以文化之進步。多半是没理性的人的功勞。</p>
<p>男人比女人聰明。並不因爲他的經騐比女人多。實因爲他的可以求得經騐的本領比女人爲好。</p>

<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>蜀中山水雄偉鍾毓而爲人。則文章之士。往往冠世。而技擊尤擅天下。吾友竺秋舫。成都人也。言其鄉有蔣大福者。名拳師也。嘗見其奏技。纍磚百塊於地。以手拍之。人令其碎若干塊。則碎若干塊。或指碎第幾塊。則碎第幾塊。無或爽。倘欲其全碎則一按之下自巓至末。皆如粉屑矣。又立地上。左右足各繫一繩。數十人異向拉之。迄不能動分毫。又令人持棒擊之。如撲敗絮。易以刃斫之。則遍體如石。刀口盡捲矣。大福旣負盛名。一日。有客來訪。請較藝。相見一揖。客揖下。有風颼然。蓋客陰以五百斤力傷之。大福知其意。亦以五百斤之力答之。客始知其未可侮。旣就座。運功碎其椅。大福見椅敗即起而道歉。謂椅不中坐。慢客之罪滋甚。即提堦前石鼓以代。客顧石鼓手搯處如鑿。還顧蔣椅。已半没入地。而完好無損乃相將出。至塲上。塲旁有古塔。凡七層。枯藤緣其上。風鐸時一作響。客脫衣四顧曰。當先安置此物。乃懸衣於第五層塔上。上下之間。翩翻如燕。大福曰。懸此固佳。特恐大風吹落沾污耳。請爲君更之。乃移衣於塔頂。往返才如電閃。更無聲息。客自審不敵。連稱佩服。竟不較而去。大福往來川中。數窘盜。盜仇之甚。日俟之。一夕。大福出行。盜躡之。大福初未覺。盜旣相及。即舉鐵棍猛擊之。以爲大福必受傷而仆矣。然棍方下時。大福即起二指接之。挾棍不得動。大福遂奔。盜之下棍也。力固猛矣。棍旣不能下。身遂懸空去地三尺。大福奔。盜駭甚。極口哀之。大福曰。鼠輩敢算計乃公耶。吾若向前一摜若無命矣。今且借若口傳語。無再撥乃公怒也。竟釋之去秋舫又言。大福之遇師事尤奇。大福幼而家貧。天性不慧。爲人牧牛。牽牛。牛不肯行。則跽而拜之。或問此何意。則曰。主母怒發時。主人輒如此也。因此同伴輒侮之。一日驅牛出。行稍遠。入隣村。村有小寺。頽敗不堪矣。將歸。牛忽倔强不受策。大福固拜。牛固不行。寺門開。有僧人出問其故。大福曰。牛盛怒。今方哀之耳。僧曰。此牛也。何須爾。一手牽之。如牽犬然。牛竭蹶不敢後。將抵家。僧乃别去。次日大福又至其處。牛又不行。正無奈間。僧又出。大福懇之。僧曰。我不爲牧。何能日日爲爾驅牛。且在此則遇我。他處將如何。大福沈思良久。乃曰。然則請和尙授我術耳。僧曰。爾性淳樸。良可。然必持之有恒。方有成耳。於是大福乃日從僧習藝。十年學成。兩川無敵手。僧蓋名佛心云。</p>

<p>北方歸客。言天津之第三監獄。中有政治犯多人。以困居鐵窗。百無聊賴。最近得獄吏之許可。相約作籃球之戲。一球之值須數金力不能致。乃乞得牛卵泡一。鼓氣使飽。外裹膠皮紙層層。以圖堅牢。雖彈力不若皮製。然往來投擲。亦頗如意也。籃架之設。需費尤巨。自更不能備。即異想天開。令兩人左右相向立椅上。以手相接作環形。而亦儼然籃矣。彼輩自此籃球成立後。無日不於獄中隙地。抛擲爲樂。謂一方固求苦中作樂。一方亦所以練習運動。見者咸爲之失笑。客又言今歲元旦。彼輩且在獄中開慶祝會。於尋常演說之外。復殿以遊藝。國術雙簧新劇京戲。應有盡有。一切化裝品物。悉以紙製。或以便服改用。空城計一齣。武鄉侯以大衫黏紙作八卦袍。芭葉作羽扇。紙爲綸巾。閒倚被單改製之城樓。引吭高歌。唱做俱佳。爲全部遊藝最出色之一幕。博得掌聲頻起。其他表演。亦多可觀。是日之台。初非架起。乃以白粉劃地爲之。觀者紛立線外。或爲各囚之親友。或爲獄吏之相識。凡無淵源者。均不獲入内也。除遊藝外。尙有壁報一種。多載文字圖畫。作品亦頗不弱。</p>

<p>特别快車敵不過汽車　汽車早到了半個鐘頭</p>
<p>火車賽跑。在數年前的英國。已有發現。發起者是往來於蘇格蘭及英格蘭的火車公司。他們常以自己所有的火車。分組比賽。以求火車速率之增進。然近數年來。則此風漸衰。已不多見。而在歐洲大陸却有火車與汽車之比賽。其趣味自較火車與火車賽跑爲濃厚而新奇。惟此種比賽常致發生危險。路上行人。尤多感不便。料想此風不久亦將大殺。</p>
<p>數月前。新西蘭曾有一次汽車與火車之大比賽。比賽之地點從惠林吞起亞克蘭止。未賽及賽畢之後。路局以無綫電報告於全國人民。一時遠近前來參觀者甚多。雖比賽之時間在晚間。經過之地又多崎嶇不平。而結果汽車竟於半小時前比火車先到目的地。</p>

<p>本刋前月杪羽君曾記大吉輪失事。某乙懷鈔洋二千四百元。扳登王姓漁船。議均分其鈔。王貪攫全部。仍擠某乙落水死。乙子是夕夢乙告以前情。亟赴港值王姓漁船進口。報官登舟搜索贓鈔具在。寘王於法云云。此科學家聞而目笑者也。顧愚平生躬歷耳聞。夢之奇異不可思議者。確鑿有之。且徵諸數千年來傳記所說。豈盡痴人。大别歸納。可得二因。一精誠所感。一怨忿所積。精誠所感。如聊齋所云。同心倩女。至離枕上之魂。千里良朋。猶識夢中之路是也。寃忿所積。則某乙之事是。有與乙事極相類似者。北魏城陽王徵。值爾朱兆之亂。徽投洛陽令寇祖仁。以有舊恩故。祖仁謂子弟曰。聞募王甚重。擒獲者千戶侯。今日富貴至矣。遂斬送之。徽初投祖仁。齎金一百斤。馬五十疋。祖仁利其財貨。故行此事。兆忽夢徽云。我有黄金二百斤。馬一百疋。在祖仁家。卿可取之。至曉。兆掩祖仁。徽其金馬。祖仁謂人密告。望風欵服。云實得金一百斤。馬五十疋。兆疑其藏隱。依夢徽之。祖仁諸房。素有金三十斤。馬三十疋。盡送致兆。猶不充數。兆怒。捉祖仁。懸首高樹。大石墜足。鞭捶之以及於死。時人以爲交報。詳載洛陽伽藍記。騐之乙事。能謂東坡說鬼皆妄言耶。</p>

<p>九日·同大學敎授文克他侖Ｋ.　Ｇ.　Venkateswaran往印度大學總部。夕由其總敎長召集各敎授。約三四十人。爲講辯會。由文克他侖君讀余講稿。各人問難甚多。余答之。咸大喜。主席者爲Abdhruva即總敎長簽名贊成。現印度各地。均有馬克司研究小團體。及其書甚多印人無抵抗。故亦無禁也。馬克司學家質問余頗多。余乃講人性社會學者。並不反對馬氏。不過說明惟物主義尙未充足耳。</p>
<p>十日。師範校及印度學校兩校敎職員及兩校敎長。合班開辯論會。約四十人。余一一答之。均大喜。兩敎長甚熱心文化之改造。納侖米沙約余照相。并約共組織亞洲敎育會。俟再回波羅奈。將開大會商議。是日晤包光大Shri　Bhagavan　Das博士。包爲波羅奈政派首領。邀余主其家。家有花園。并介紹余往訪印首領甘地。由包光大之商議世界和平須興母權以廢戰爭。興母道以敎狂童。庶雄性可改造也。</p>
<p>十一晨四時起。包光大年六十餘亦起。遣其子同余上火車。赴亞拉巴Allahabad訪甘地。黎明以前。包送行甚摯。六時上車。十一時到。車中讀詩。見麥苗秀矣。不覺深感微子麥秀之歌。云麥秀尖尖兮禾黍油油。念印度難地。未易得自由也。是日雨。余初聞印度有乾季濕季之說。以爲乾季從無雨。乃今知不然。乾季仍然下雨。不過數禮拜一次耳。中國北方冬季常數月一次雨也。印度北部冬季略與中國同。余尙未到其極北。已覺頗冷。着棉袍矣。不過無霜。草木常靑耳。然北近雪山。則其冷可知。</p>

<p>（三）警署中</p>
<p>於是我就把經過的情形。向張寳全說了一遍。末後我又說道。「這件事原很明瞭。這個匪徒當時混在高家的賓客裏面。用了什麽方法。竊得了這條項圈。便悄悄出來。他走了幾步。發覺貴探夥正尾隨在他後面。他自己心虛起來。便想把贓物移渡。以便脫身。不幸貴探夥中了他的計。便厮纏着我。眼睜睜地讓他逃走。」張寳全作驚訝聲道。「唉。原來如此。」他又旋過頭去。瞧着邱奎申斥道。「你這没用的笨伯。竟會幹出這種事來。你總算是當了一名探夥。雖然不認識這包先生。總也應得聽得過他的名聲。怎麽包先生說明了他的姓名。你竟還執迷不悟。你眞混賬。」那邱奎低倒了頭。連眼光都不敢抬起。那種卑順惶恐的狀態。見了又覺可笑。他期期然答道。「我眞該死。我聽錯了。請包先生寛恕我這一遭罷。」他忽旋轉身來。連連的向着我作揖打拱。我倒反有些不好意思。這班没智識的人。前倨後恭。原不算稀罕。我如果也堅持着當場報復。反覺得我的器量有些不廣。我因作調解聲道。「張先生。他當初對於我的蠻橫凌辱。雖也有失偵探的態度。但事旣出於誤會。我還可以原諒。不過這一件案子分明也很嚴重。當時他因着無可理喩。才使那奸徒脫身遠去。所以别的都不成問題。那匪徒的踪迹。應怎樣查明。這位邱先生應當負責。」張寳全又頓足向邱奎道。「可惡。可惡。這案子明明被你弄壞。你要保存你的飯碗。當然不能不負責把那人追尋回來。」那邱奎又把腰背彎得像弓兒模樣。連連應道。「我認得出這個壞蛋。一定照辦。一定照辦。」他說了這幾句話。再也不敢有别的話。便又深深鞠了一個躬。低著頭走出辦公室去。我默念得志時趾高氣揚不可一世。一失意便諂媚屈服。無所不爲。原是小人們的慣技。想來也眞可笑可憐。</p>

<p>Education Facility Trend Proposal</p>
<p>Transferred to the Education Review Committee for Review</p>
<p>Proposal to Abolish Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>Unanimously Passed; Declaration to be Drafted Immediately</p>
<p>General Political Report Proposal</p>
<p>Organized a Review Committee for Review</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly convened its second meeting at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Four hundred and fifty-nine members attended, and sixty-one observers were present. The presidium consisted of Zhang Xueliang, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Lin Zhifu, Zhou Zuomin, and Liu Chunyi. Zhang Xueliang served as chairman, Ye Chucang as secretary-general, Cheng Tianfang as director of recording secretaries, and Xu Jingzhi, Qian Changzhao, Qu Guoliang, Xie Jian, Cheng Zhongxing, Hong Lanyou, Li Pan, and Ye Suozhong as secretaries. After the chairman respectfully read Sun Yat-sen's will, he announced that today was a day of national humiliation commemoration. All stood in silence for three minutes.</p>
<p>Reported Matters</p>
<p>(1) Reading of the minutes from the first meeting.</p>
<p>(2) The Secretary-General reported on the representatives who had requested leave and those whose credentials had been approved by the presidium.</p>
<p>(3) Thirty-seven congratulatory messages were received.</p>
<p>Items for Discussion</p>
<p>(1) The National Government submitted a proposal to determine the trend of educational facilities. First, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, took the stage and invited Cai Yuanpei to explain the purpose of the proposal. Cai explained each of the key items listed in the proposal in detail. At this time, more than ten representatives submitted written statements expressing their desire to speak and took the stage in turn. Wang Zhuoran proposed adding an item to the proposal: "All education should be based on the principle of using the national language." He said, "I fear neither heaven nor earth, only that the Chinese people will not speak Chinese." Zhuang Songfu then said that China's poverty and chaos were mainly due to poor education and a lack of productive capacity. Social mores were declining, and fashion was prevailing. There was widespread disregard for loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and all inherent morality, leading to increasing chaos and poverty. The danger would be unimaginable. This time, the trend of educational facilities must focus on vocational aspects to enhance the ability and knowledge of productive enterprises, cultivate the minds of young people to straighten their trends, and preserve their morals. Textbooks should include more moral maxims and stories, and a large number of good teachers should be trained. After the speech, Chairman Zhang Xueliang said that Representative Zhuang was excellent in character and learning and was Chairman Chiang's former teacher. His words were sufficient to criticize the worldly customs and save the country and should be noted by everyone. Zhang Naiyan spoke, saying that education should pay attention to military affairs, health, and hygiene. Chen Bulei spoke, advocating that the original proposal's third item, "Social education should focus on increasing production as the central goal," be revised to "Social education and mass education should focus on general knowledge and increasing productive capacity as the central goal." Gong Zengwei (a female observer representative) spoke, saying: (1) Primary and secondary schools should be vocationalized across the board; (2) Vocational subjects should be added to normal schools; (3) Vocational education talents should be fully trained. After the speech, the chairman announced that the matter would be submitted to the Education Review Committee for review. Representatives with opinions could send them to the Review Committee for reference.</p>
<p>After a five-minute break, the meeting continued. Representative Xiang Dingrong and others presented a temporary motion to urge the government to abolish unequal treaties within a time limit. They said that the important purpose of the National Assembly was unification and construction. The reason why China could not be unified and constructed in the past was due to the aggression and destruction of imperialists and the constraints of various unequal treaties. Today, what day is it? It is the May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Day, which is filled with infinite emotion. The Twenty-One Demands are the most unequal of the unequal treaties. Looking back on the past is truly heartbreaking. Knowing that we commemorate national humiliation, we must strive to redress it. If this humiliation is not redressed for a day, the country will not be free from danger for a day. Therefore, to prevent future problems and punish past mistakes, this emergency motion is proposed: (1) urge the government to negotiate with various countries within a time limit to abolish all unequal treaties; (2) issue a declaration of automatic treaty abolition in the name of the National Assembly. The main points of the declaration are: (1) stating the pain China has suffered from unequal treaties over the years; (2) abolishing unequal treaties on one hand and signing equal treaties on the other; (3) the people should not hesitate to sacrifice everything and be determined to fight to the end. Next, Representative Yang Xingqin spoke, asking the diplomatic authorities to explain the process of negotiating with various countries to abolish unequal treaties. The chairman replied that a written report had already been prepared. Then, Representatives Zhuang Songfu, Xie Zuomin, Wang Xianfang, He Zicheng, and others took the stage in turn to vehemently state the urgency of abolishing unequal treaties. For a time, the atmosphere in the entire venue was unusually tense. The chairman put the proposal to a vote by standing up. Everyone stood up unanimously, with thunderous applause, and shouted slogans to abolish unequal treaties and overthrow imperialism. The presidium then designated Xiang Dingrong and eleven others to draft a declaration of treaty abolition.</p>
<p>(2) The National Government submitted a proposal for a general government report. After the Chairman of the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek, explained it, the Chairman announced that a special review committee would be formed for this proposal. Nine members were recommended, to be convened by Cai Yuanpei. There were no objections, and it was passed.</p>
<p>The Chairman reported that there would be no meeting tomorrow, Sunday. The general meeting would be held at 9:00 AM on the 11th and adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The presidium designated the eleven members of the committee to draft the declaration abolishing unequal treaties as follows: Shao Lizi, Chen Cheng, Xie Zuomin, Wang Zhuoran, Feng Tianru, Dai Qinglian, Liu Luyin, Chen Bulei, Xiang Dingrong, Zhuang Songfu, and Luo Sang Jianzan, to be convened by Shao Lizi. The nine members of the committee to review the general political report were designated as follows: Niu Yongjian, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Lian Shenghai, Peng Jiqun, Jin Enqi, Wang Shijie, Ding Weifen, and Zhu Peide, to be convened by Cai Yuanpei. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During today's general assembly discussion of the treaty abolition proposal, He Siyuan spoke, saying that the May 3rd Massacre had not yet been investigated, and the suffering of the people of Shandong had not been alleviated. He requested that the general assembly resolve to request the National Government to order the diplomatic authorities to actively negotiate. Representative Yan Youfu also spoke, saying that in addition to treaty abolition, one thing that deserves the most attention is that Dalian, which was leased to Japan, has not yet been returned. He made a temporary motion to request that the general assembly resolve that the National Government should recover it immediately. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly is scheduled to hold its third general assembly at 9:00 AM on the 11th. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Explanation of the General Political Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang's Speech on the General Political Report: Chairman, fellow representatives, the General Political Report of the National Government has already been printed in three volumes and distributed to everyone. The first volume pertains to military affairs. Since the establishment of the National Government, about eight out of ten major events have been military and political matters, so the military report is</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>listed first. The second is about administrative matters, such as internal affairs, foreign affairs, finance, accounting, industry, education, transportation, railways, Mongolian and Tibetan affairs, opium prohibition, etc., as well as the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the Control Yuan, and other aspects, all have detailed explanations. The part about the Executive Yuan includes the case just submitted regarding foreign affairs. If I were to explain it in detail, the original text would be very long, and there is not enough time today, so I have to be brief. But if after you all read it carefully, you think there are questions to be asked, whether it is foreign or domestic affairs, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Internal Affairs, or the President of the Yuan can attend to explain. What I want to say now is not in the general report, but I will simply report on the key points of our politics, such as how the facilities are, and how to proceed in the future. If we want to talk about the general political report, we must first understand the foundation of our government and the central point of current political work. To talk about the foundation of politics, we must first understand where our politics come from and the starting point of our political policies. Now the starting point of all policies of our National Government is based on the National Reconstruction Program stipulated by Sun Yat-sen. I believe everyone present has read the National Reconstruction Program in detail, so I won't say more. But the point I want to make clear today is the preface outside the National Reconstruction Program. Whenever we want to read the National Reconstruction Program, we must first read this preface to understand its value and understand its spirit. Regarding the preface to the National Reconstruction Program, I will now read it in segments: "Preface to the National Government's National Reconstruction Program: From the Xinhai Revolution to today, what has been obtained is only the name of the Republic of China... to ensure that comrades and citizens understand each other." This paragraph explains the purpose of the revolution, which is to implement the Three Principles of the People, and to implement the Three Principles of the People, there must be methods and steps to proceed gradually to success. "Within a few months of the Xinhai Revolution, more than four thousand years were overthrown... thinking that the foundation of the Republic of China could be laid, but not knowing that it had the opposite effect." These few sentences mean that after the Xinhai Revolution, we did not follow Sun Yat-sen's plan, so the implementation of the Three Principles of the People was clueless. This is our biggest problem in the past in the revolutionary process. "Those who see that the implementation of the Provisional Constitution cannot benefit the Republic of China, and even... then the discipline is gone, and disasters follow one after another, so it is no wonder." This paragraph talks about the effectiveness of the Provisional Constitution, and it is very clear after the lecture. From this, we can also see Sun Yat-sen's opinion on the Provisional Constitution. "The government, in view of this, believes that the revolution from now on should continue the unfinished business of the Xinhai and vigorously correct... the so-called priorities, in order." This paragraph explains that the National Reconstruction Program takes clearing obstacles as the beginning of the revolution and completing the revolution as construction. Sun Yat-sen advocates dividing the revolution into priorities. Sun Yat-sen usually taught us that there are two important points in political philosophy and political construction. No matter which country in the world has such a big, so deep, so far, what is this political philosophy? First, it is the section of "When the Great Way is practiced, the world is for the public," and there is also one that Sun Yat-sen most valued, sighing that we Chinese people do not know that we have good things, and do not pay attention to the very good political philosophy inherent in China, which is what the Great Learning says, that the most important thing for all those who govern politics is the words in the Great Learning that are semi-scientific, saying in the first article, "Things have roots and branches, and affairs have ends and beginnings. If we know what is first and what is last, we are near the Way." It also says, "Those who in ancient times wished to manifest their clear virtue to the world, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things... " until the governance of the country and the pacification of the world. This is entirely a scientific method of talking about politics. Sun Yat-sen used this treasure as the most great and noble political theory of his life. This is unique to China, and no other country has it. All of you comrades must have conducted detailed research on Sun Yat-sen's doctrines and writings. You must know why Sun Yat-sen must especially propose and teach us "roots and branches first." It is because our political knowledge is too poor, and we don't know the order of roots and branches. Often some things are upside down. Things that should be done first are put aside and not done, and things that should be done later are done first, with no scientific method or steps. Therefore, politics is backward, the economy is backward, and we cannot stand shoulder to shoulder with other countries. Sun Yat-sen guided us to pay special attention to these points, which is to say that we must divide politics into roots and branches first and conform to scientific methods, so that politics has the hope and possibility of progress. "The revolution is a very serious destruction... all that has been experienced are smooth roads without any danger of tripping and falling." There are a few sentences in this paragraph that I would like you to pay special attention to. The so-called rights of the people and happiness of the people must be practical, not just for fame. We have not asked how well we have done, so this time our draft Provisional Constitution also focuses on practical aspects. Now that we have reached the era of political tutelage, we must not be the same as the era of military government. During the period of military government, we often pre-determined various policies, but due to military obstacles, we did not proceed according to plan. However, during this period, we cannot proceed, and the people may be able to understand that the government cannot seek happiness and rights for the people without first clearing the rebellious army. But now that we have reached the period of political tutelage, our established administrative plans cannot be the same as the military government era. Whether it is in the Provisional Constitution or in peacetime political orders, even saying a word must be done practically. One word is done for one word, which is a Chinese idiom, the so-called seeking truth from facts. Therefore, this time the problem of the Provisional Constitution, we also focus on two sentences of Sun Yat-sen: "Everything should be practical, not just for fame." In this way, we must gradually proceed step by step so that the people can abide by it and the government can abide by it. "For the sake of the Republic of China, for the sake of the people... now I will list Article 15 of the National Reconstruction Program on the left." This is the preface that Sun Yat-sen personally wrote for the National Reconstruction Program. We should pay special attention to reading it. This is the detailed situation that I have made clear in the opening remarks, regarding the shortcomings of the political report and the current political situation. It is also included in the printed materials issued today and can now be omitted and no longer repeated. Please forgive me. In addition, there is one more point to be explained in the political report, which is the relationship between politics and the party. If we understand this point, the questions raised by the representatives yesterday about the Provisional Constitution may be able to solve some of them. We know that the government of any country is not simple, and it cannot be seen on the surface. To deal with the politics of a country, there must be very complex and subtle organizations and systems inside. Our National Government of China is also like this. This principle is limited by time and cannot be explained in detail. Now I can only use metaphors to explain it. Mr. Li Shizeng often uses the examples of republican democracies to compare the relationship of our political system, which is very simple and clear. He said that the Kuomintang of China, during the period of political tutelage,</p>
<p>During the period of political tutelage, the Kuomintang of China is the highest organ. Within the Kuomintang of China, there is a Central Political Council, which is like the parliament of a republican democracy, and is the highest legislative organ. Now, people often think that the Legislative Yuan among the five Yuans of the National Government is the highest legislative organ of the country. No matter what bill, it can only be effective and implemented by the government after it is passed by the Legislative Yuan. I don't know that important bills passed by the Legislative Yuan must be decided on the principle by the Central Political Council. According to the principle of the Central Political Council, the Legislative Yuan can pass bills. Therefore, the Central Executive Committee Political Council is the highest legislative and political guiding organ, and the National Government is only the highest administrative executive organ under the guidance of the party. If we do not understand this point, we will think that the National Government has all the governing power of the Republic of China, and all declarations of war, conciliation, treaties, budgets, and final accounts are managed by the National Government. In fact, these issues must first be submitted by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China to the Central Political Council to decide on the principles. After the Central Political Council decides on the principles, the various departments of the National Government can announce and implement them. Therefore, the relationship between the Kuomintang of China and the National Government is not cut off. All power is in the hands of the Kuomintang of China. After the Kuomintang of China decides, it will be handed over to the National Government for implementation. Nothing can be acted on freely by the National Government. However, why is this meaning not very clearly stipulated in the Provisional Constitution? Why, except for the chapter on the Political Tutelage Program, are there no words of the Kuomintang of China? This was actually considered very carefully when drafting. Everyone must have done a lot of research on the constitutions of various countries. We see that in any country, all the power used in politics is not detailed in the fundamental law. Therefore, we have omitted them all in the Provisional Constitution except for the Political Tutelage Program. If we understand this meaning, we know that the relationship between the Kuomintang of China and the National Government is very close and very harmonious, and there is no need for the provisions of the articles. I still need to take a paragraph from the conclusion of the general political report as the conclusion of my oral report, "As for the future plans of various undertakings, they have been described in detail according to their categories and presented in the previous paragraph, and there is no need to repeat them, so as not to be tedious. Although the government is still here, it still believes that things have roots and branches, and affairs have ends and beginnings. The way to build a country must be grand at the beginning. Regarding the fundamental plan, it is really necessary to clearly reveal it so that the sages and heroes in the country can discuss it together. Now, I will try to solemnly state the following: National politics are based on the principle of keeping pace with the times. To the fullest extent, there is originally no limit, and our Sun Yat-sen bequeathed to build the country and divided it into three stages, from military government to political tutelage to constitutional government. The scale of the constitutional government period depends entirely on the beginning and foundation of the political tutelage period. The government bears the heavy trust of the Kuomintang of China and the ardent hope of the people of the whole country. The governing power is entrusted, and the responsibility is not light. How can all measures be limited to the present and have no return? It is necessary to plan for the distant and great after suppressing the violence and winning the remnant, and establish a long-term peace and governance. Calculate the days and present the achievements, and do not forget or help. It is enough to clarify the outline of political tutelage and establish the precedent of constitutional government. When the first National Congress declared, it stipulated fifteen domestic policies and six foreign policies, which are considered the minimum limit of the party program. Now it is the time for the military to end and the political tutelage to be implemented. The government has the governing power and must follow this path, strive and strive, and seek its realization in order. If we further summarize it, it can be said that the domestic policy is centered on promoting local autonomy. All other items should be attached to this, and we dare not relax a little. The foreign policy is centered on abolishing unequal treaties. All other items should also be attached to this, and we dare not relax a little. Sun Yat-sen said that the government must be capable and the people must have rights. Within this political tutelage period, all the above-mentioned domestic and foreign policies should be regarded as the law, supervising the subordinate agencies, and doing their best to achieve them. And for the people, we should also base ourselves on the teachings that the world is for the public, and practically guide and train them, unify their will, expand their strength, increase their status, consolidate their groups, and gradually allow them to reach the point where they can exercise the four powers freely. In terms of the current responsibility, it is necessary to complete the political tutelage, and in terms of the future goal, it is to establish constitutional government. The government's self-encouragement is here, and the same is true for the people of the whole country. I sincerely report, and I hope to see it." Finally, I also thought that today, May 9th, is the biggest national humiliation memorial day of the Republic of China. Just now, all the representatives unanimously passed the temporary proposal to abolish unequal treaties and issue a declaration in the name of the conference. This is the greatest spirit of the National Assembly and the most important significance of convening this National Assembly. However, we are not afraid of not abolishing unequal treaties, but we are afraid that our country will not live up to its expectations. Now China is bound by the unequal treaties of imperialism, as if there are many training chains surrounding it. To remove them is certainly not an easy task and will require great effort to achieve the goal. But if we want to show this power, we must be self-reliant and self-reliant. If we cannot be self-reliant and self-reliant, it is still fake to shout every day to abolish unequal treaties. The National Government now stipulates a six-year plan, which is really not a big deal. But we believe that if we can truly and practically achieve this plan within six years, unequal treaties can definitely be abolished. As the ancient Chinese saying goes, ten years of recuperation and ten years of education. Now we want the people of the whole country to unanimously support the National Government and follow the six-year plan for three years of recuperation and three years of education, so that we can abolish all unequal treaties and achieve our goals.

<h3 id="e5">International Silver Conference <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Since the trend of falling silver prices began, economic and financial experts from various countries around the world have gathered to study, and all believe that it is necessary to unite various countries to convene an international conference. Two months ago, a Paris telegram stated that Europe is now preparing to join hands with other countries in the world to conclude a gentleman's agreement to stabilize silver prices. Although the European continent does not produce silver, it pays great attention to the efforts to relieve the silver market, because European issuing banks hold large amounts of silver and plan to allocate them for casting, so they are willing to convene a world silver price conference. The address is best in Mexico, because that country is one of the most related to silver production and obtaining silver price stability. It is also said that German economists here all believe that major silver producing countries must voluntarily reduce production and conclude a production agreement to restore health. From the above, we can know that the movement to convene a silver conference has been going on for a long time, and we can also know that convening a silver conference requires the joint efforts of silver producing countries, silver using countries, and other gold standard countries, and especially focuses on silver producing countries. However, silver producing countries and other countries must have different positions and different claims due to their different positions. If they cannot sacrifice the private opinions of one country to accommodate the general trend of the world, then even if the conference is held, there will be no good results. Therefore, even if the silver council proposal submitted by the Chinese representatives at the International Commercial Conference today is passed, it is difficult to predict whether there will be any results in the future.</p>

<p>Detailed Explanation of Conciliatory Policy</p>
<p>German-Austrian Tariff Treaty Considered of No Political Importance</p>
<p>Eloquent Oratory Enthralls Listeners Like a Narcotic</p>
<p>Public Sentiment Leans Towards Presidential Candidate</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 8th: Today, the French Parliament, following yesterday's grand gathering, saw Foreign Minister Briand provide a detailed explanation of France's foreign policy in recent years, dispelling an atmosphere of suspicion. Briand's hour-long speech showcased his talent for oratory, shifting from vehement to nonchalant, employing his usual skills of manipulation. Although there were occasional jeers from the left and right wings, by the end of Briand's speech, the applause from the entire chamber was thunderous, silencing even his opponents. Following this speech, Briand may soon ascend to the position of head of state. This speech may be Briand's swan song in his active political life. Briand's speech first described the conciliatory policy since the European War. He stated that he knew this policy would encounter many obstacles and opponents, but statesmen such as Tardieu, Laval, and Poincaré deeply believed in it. As for the German-Austrian tariff treaty, Briand has now admitted that the issue is no longer of major importance. The German-Austrian tariff treaty is merely an economic agreement, and although there are regrets to be found, it has no actual political importance. The Germans' mistake was a psychological one, so the French should not be suspicious and cause themselves trouble. Furthermore, he has accepted the suggestion of British Foreign Secretary Henderson to submit the matter to the League of Nations Council for review, so the German-Austrian tariff treaty is like the naval agreement, not yet an established fact. Moreover, France has decided to submit a counterproposal to various countries at the opening of the Pan-European Conference. At that time, the German-Austrian tariff treaty may be completely eliminated by France's counterproposal. Briand concluded by saying that if humanity is determined to maintain peace, where would war come from? He said that he has always striven for peace and will never split with the Germans or harm the relationship between Germany and France.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 8th: Tonight, after a long discussion, the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in Briand's foreign policy by 450 votes to 52. Briand stated that Germany made a big mistake in proceeding with the German-Austrian Customs Union. He believes that the solution to economic difficulties lies in the plan for European economic unity, which will be discussed in Geneva. He hopes that the German foreign authorities understand that the era of coercion is now over. Herriot spoke in support of Briand, saying that without an agreement with Britain and the United States, there would be no maritime peace, and without an agreement with Germany, there would be no land peace.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 8th: After Briand's foreign policy achieved a great victory in Parliament, the radical factions of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies decided in a joint meeting with a large majority to send representatives to persuade Briand to run for president. Although Senate President Doumer has rejoined the Radical Party, hoping to share Briand's influence, it is expected that this will still be insufficient to affect the number of votes for the Radical Party. Moreover, Socialist leader Blum also stated in the newspapers that his party supports Briand's candidacy. In addition, several of Briand's political enemies also want him to be elected president so that he can relinquish the position of foreign minister. Therefore, if Briand agrees to run, the presidential seat is almost guaranteed.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce Passes China's Proposal <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Convocation of a World Silver Conference</p>
<p>US Representatives Strongly Oppose Cancellation of War Debts</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 8th: The International Chamber of Commerce's Proposal Committee has passed the proposal of the Chinese representatives to convene a world conference to handle the silver issue. This proposal can be submitted to the plenary session tomorrow. The proposal states that the International Chamber of Commerce, in view of the serious impact of the current silver market on the world's economic situation, believes that it is necessary to convene a conference this year to hear the opinions of all parties concerned and seek a solution to this difficult problem. It is hoped that the national committees will bring this matter to the attention of their respective governments.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 8th: Today, there were already a sufficient number of representatives within the International Chamber of Commerce Conference supporting the international silver conference proposal, ensuring its passage. Therefore, attention turned to the war debt issue. European representatives tried to have a resolution for its establishment recorded in the meeting minutes, while US representatives strongly opposed it. Furthermore, Congressman Snell issued a declaration to the International Chamber of Commerce Conference, strongly refuting the cancellation or reduction of war debts, claiming that whenever there is an international gathering, the decision is always to make Americans the sacrificial lamb for their own selfish plans.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th: The New York Times carried a dispatch from Mexico City, saying that the Mexican financial and industrial circles are greatly delighted by the prospect of the early holding of the World Silver Conference and welcome Washington's advocacy, considering this as a possible method of saving silver prices. Among the general economic decline, one of Mexico's serious burdens is the low price of silver. Recently, Mexico's exchange situation has been very critical, and many silver coins have been withdrawn from the market because there is no possibility of offsetting them with gold.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Great Danger of a Tuberculosis Family <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Shared Meals and Tuberculosis</p>
<p>By Yu Yunxiu, a great contemporary Chinese medical scholar</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The practice of shared meals is prevalent throughout China, especially in the south. A square table, surrounded by seven or eight people, with various dishes arranged, chopsticks and cups crossing paths. Family members, fathers and sons, gather together in harmony. Hosts and guests, friends and acquaintances, are all satisfied and full. It's certainly warm, intimate, and thoughtful, but it is also a breeding ground for the transmission of disease. To offend this danger is no different from stepping on a sword's edge or walking through fire. Does the reader doubt my words? Please allow me to use tuberculosis as an example. Tuberculosis, even with the advancements of modern medicine, is nearly impossible to cure once the condition has progressed slightly. Once diagnosed, life and death are uncertain. This is something that everyone has heard of and shies away from, avoiding it as quickly as possible. However, it is spreading wider and wider, with more and more people afflicted. We fear it but cannot avoid it, shun it but cannot escape it. Is it truly a matter of fate, hanging by a thread? Or is it a lack of knowledge, poor customs, and the inability to defend against it properly?</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is caused by the transmission of bacteria. It has been over forty years since German doctor Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacillus. Scholars around the world have no objection. This long-standing evil has been exposed, its discovery is no less significant than the Great Yu's cauldron. Today, even women and children know about it, only our old customs remain ignorant. The bacteria is less than fifteen ten-thousandths of a centimeter long and less than five ten-thousandths of a centimeter wide. When viewed under a thousand-fold microscope, it looks like a short mustache. It has no feet, so it cannot walk. It has no tail, so it cannot swim. It has no wings, so it cannot fly. The common belief that tuberculosis is caused by deficiency and exhaustion, and that the "lung worm" is a spiritual creature that escapes from the dying patient and attaches itself to others, is false. Moreover, the "Ziting Extermination of Tuberculosis Formula" even depicts the shape of its six generations. Wang Kentang's "Diagnosis and Treatment Standards" adopted it, but they are all just words of imagined likeness, which is why the Siku Quanshu criticizes it as strange talk.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>When the tuberculosis bacteria enter the lungs, they develop, grow, and reproduce. Therefore, the sputum of tuberculosis patients contains many of these bacteria. In severe cases, even a tiny speck of sputum contains thousands of bacteria. This can be seen clearly under a microscope, it is not empty talk. Based on this, the number of bacteria in a single mouthful of sputum is countless, perhaps billions. This sputum, containing billions of bacteria, is spat out from the lungs into the outside world, inevitably passing through the throat, tongue, and lips. Therefore, the amount of sputum containing bacteria that contaminates the patient's throat, tongue, and lips is countless. The number of bacteria clinging to the patient's throat, tongue, and lips is unimaginable. Once cups and chopsticks come into contact with the mouth of a tuberculosis patient, they are contaminated by countless specks of sputum containing bacteria. The number of bacteria clinging to the cups and chopsticks is unimaginable. When a patient uses chopsticks to eat the dishes on the table, the amount of sputum containing bacteria that contaminates the dishes is countless. The number of bacteria clinging to and floating in the dishes is also unimaginable. Those at the same table, carelessly unaware, use the same cups and chopsticks and eat the leftovers, they are swallowing tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Alas, if someone suffering from tuberculosis is a guest, they may be able to avoid infection during one or two shared meals. But for family members, fathers and sons, living and working together, seeing each other every day, sharing every meal, eating together two or three times a day, they are taking tuberculosis bacteria into their bodies. How can they avoid infection? Therefore, I say that to offend this danger is no different from stepping on a sword's edge or walking through fire. Those who are not infected may have special physical conditions that allow them to escape. But how can we rely on this? Although tuberculosis is mostly transmitted through the air, the food we eat is also a path to disaster. Then, the practice of shared meals is a system of taking tuberculosis bacteria daily to satiate the healthy. Isn't this a bad habit? Shouldn't those who know their fate be afraid and wary? Shouldn't virtuous people loudly condemn and eliminate it? The number of tuberculosis patients in China is truly staggering. Like a vast flood, we do not know where the inundation will end. This is also the source of national weakness and racial decline. Those who care about the world should pay attention to this point of custom reform.

<p>A Lung Specimen Prepared by Dr. Dender of Germany</p>
<p>The Latest Treatment for Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms a nodule at that location, cutting off the blood supply. Furthermore, the tubercle bacillus secretes an acid-resistant waxy substance that surrounds its body to protect itself from the intrusion of all external medicinal forces. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they cannot reach the substance of the germ itself. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, drug therapy, and all other therapies that doctors have traditionally used have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for lung disease has spread throughout the world because this profound theory is unknown. Based on the above theory, modern tuberculosis scholars continue to research tirelessly, and as a result, they have achieved this chemical saint agent that kills all tuberculosis bacteria, named Sanosin. This drug was successfully invented based on the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch of Germany, the inventor of the tubercle bacillus, and Dr. Berger of Germany, the inventor of the tubercle bacillus dewaxing technique. According to the current experimental reports of various lung disease sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of lung lesions and dissolving the waxy substance. It also has bactericidal power and can fundamentally cure stage 1, 2, and 3 tuberculosis, with a guaranteed effect in every case. In China, the Pharmaceutical Testing Institute of the National Government has tested it and found that the medicine is mild, non-toxic, and has absolutely no side effects. Now, a brief description of its medicinal effect is given below:</p>
<p>(1) When the medicinal effect of "Sanosin" is experimentally tested in a test tube, the acid resistance of all tubercle bacilli disappears after one minute, and after three minutes, the tubercle bacilli are completely killed, with none spared.</p>
<p>(2) According to animal experiments, it was found that "Sanosin" can penetrate into tuberculous lesions. When examining the tubercle bacilli latent within the lesions, they were found to have completely lost their acid resistance. This proves that the waxy substance has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If a patient takes "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they will immediately see good conditions such as sputum thinning and body heat decreasing.</p>
<p>(4) If "Sanosin" is continued internally for more than 30 to 60 days, a visible increase in body weight, increased appetite, and gradual relief of all symptoms will be apparent, ultimately achieving the great effect of bringing back the dead.</p>

<p>Summary of Important News</p>
<p>Chairman Ding Weifen presided over the meeting, and after the ceremony, He Yingqin gave a speech. He stated that today is the anniversary of May Ninth, which is the national humiliation day when Japanese imperialists presented the Twenty-One Demands in the fourth year of the Republic of China, coercing Yuan Shikai to sign. Yuan Shikai, in his plot to establish an empire, sacrificed national territory and sovereignty and succumbed to Japanese imperialists. However, the people fought hard and refused to recognize it, and the Japanese imperialists ultimately failed to obtain these rights. But Japanese imperialists never forget aggression, such as the Shanghai Massacre in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shaqi Massacre in Guangdong, and the Jinan Massacre in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, all stemmed from aggressive intentions. Our people are deeply pained and will never forget this national humiliation. The most severe point of the Twenty-One Demands proposed by Japanese imperialists was to hand over our country's land and sovereignty to them. The significance of our meeting today is to remind all compatriots to remember clearly the various aggressive acts of Japanese imperialists against us, and to strive at all times to protect the interests and dignity of our people and the survival and prosperity of our nation. We must absolutely seek national independence and strength. When Japanese imperialists proposed these Twenty-One Demands, there were many traitors who acted as pawns for Japanese imperialists and Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai wanted to use the Twenty-One Demands as a condition for Japanese imperialists to first recognize his imperial system, so he did not hesitate to betray the country. Many unequal treaties were formed by traitorous officials and warlords who only sought personal gain and disregarded the great harm to the country. Sixteen years have passed since the national humiliation of May Ninth. Has the national humiliation been redressed? I am afraid that comrades will not be able to give a good answer. Various national humiliations are increasing day by day. On one hand, white imperialists are heavily oppressing us, and on the other hand, red imperialists are doing their best to attack us. Even in this campaign to suppress the Red bandits in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, many documents and slogans seized from the Red bandits show that red imperialists are behind them. Remote counties in the three provinces are plagued by Red bandits, and almost all houses are empty. The Red bandits' acts of betraying the country are so painful to the people, and this national humiliation must also be urgently redressed. Since the successful completion of the Northern Expedition and unification, some achievements have been made in diplomacy, such as the recovery of customs tariffs, the recovery of concessions, and the recovery of legal rights. It can be seen that resisting foreign aggression requires self-strengthening. Today, commemorating the national humiliation requires the people to sacrifice personal emotions and selfishness, and it requires the people to arouse national spirit and patriotic public-mindedness to serve the country together. Only then can the national humiliation be redressed, and the commemoration will have meaning. Our party's ideology and the instructions of the Premier are that we must realize the National Assembly and abolish unequal treaties in the shortest possible time. Now the National Assembly has been realized, and the abolition of unequal treaties must also be fully accomplished this year. I hope that comrades will strive for these last five minutes and work together to promote its realization. After the report, the ceremony was completed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Classroom Collapse Kills Two, Injures Dozens</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: At 10:00 AM on the 8th, a classroom in the second branch of the Hankou Municipal No. 42 Elementary School suddenly collapsed, killing two students, seriously injuring one, and leaving five missing. Dozens were slightly injured. This is an unprecedented tragedy in Hankou's educational circles. The school is located in the Model District. The first branch is in Yuyin Lane, and the second branch is in Yixiang Lane. It was originally the First Workers' School and was expanded in the 18th year of the Republic of China. The school building of the first branch is still solid, but the second branch had been occupied by troops for a long time, and frequent test firing of guns and bullets caused much damage to the walls. Due to limited funding, repairs could not be made. At 9:30 AM on the 8th, students from the second-year upper and second-year lower grades were combined in the upstairs classroom, and female teacher Xu Duanfang was teaching a music lesson when the entire building suddenly collapsed. Except for three or five students who managed to escape by grabbing onto doors and windows, the remaining 97 students and female teacher Xu Duanfang all fell together. Neighbors and the 48th Division Military Police Battalion rushed to rescue them, and many students were rescued from the rubble. Two students died immediately: Zhou Guangshi, 11 years old, and Wei Tianzhang, 10 years old. One student was seriously injured: Hu Huanyan, 10 years old. More than a dozen students were slightly injured, including Tian Jinye, Wang Youjin, Cao Hancheng, Qiu Liwen, Zhang Dezhong, Ye Wangbao, Weng Youyue, Li Youjun, Ding Xudong, Ren Ziru, Liu Ruoting, and Liang Bingjun. Female teacher Xu Duanfang was also slightly injured. Five others are missing, and it is not yet known whether they escaped and returned home or were buried in the rubble. After receiving the news, the Municipal Education Bureau immediately dispatched Han Lianhe, Chen Cairu, Liao Hong, and Zhao Liancheng to the scene to direct the rescue. The Municipal Government also sent Liu Jizhi to inspect and ordered the Municipal Hospital to send doctors Chen Binghua and Liu Shanqing to provide emergency treatment. The Security Team was ordered to rush to the scene to maintain order. The injured students and teachers were sent to the Municipal Hospital and the Catholic Church Hospital for treatment. Rao Chonggong, the school's director of moral education, went to the students' homes to offer condolences. Acting Mayor He Fuzhou of the Municipal Government telegraphed Mayor Liu Wendao about the incident, stating: "This afternoon, at the Yixiang Lane No. 42 Elementary School, while a music lesson was being taught upstairs, the building collapsed due to decay, killing two students, Wei Tianzhang and Zhou Guangshi, seriously injuring Hu Huanyan, and slightly injuring more than a dozen others. Upon receiving the report, workers and the Security Team and doctors were dispatched with medicine to provide assistance. The injured students have been sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. Arrangements are being made for the deceased students. The bureau has sent personnel to join school staff and doctors to provide condolences. Further reports will follow." The Municipal Education Bureau also convened an emergency meeting and resolved: (1) The school is ordered to promptly investigate and report the details of the casualties. (2) Request the Municipal Government to provide compensation for the deceased students. (3) Request the Municipal Hospital to provide free medical treatment for the injured students. (4) School Principal Zhou Fo is suspended from his duties, and Inspector Xiong Hongzhao is appointed to investigate and report. (5) Section staff Liao Hong will temporarily take charge of maintaining school affairs. (May 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Bandits in Southern Shandong Being Suppressed <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Ma Brigade Captures Dozens of Bandits Alive</p>
<p>Gu Division Orders Strict Suppression by All Units</p>
<p>Important Bandit Leaders Are Being Apprehended One After Another</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: After being routed by various army units, the remaining bandits in southern Shandong will be eliminated soon. The Jiang telegram from the Third Route Staff Office of the Teng County Anti-Bandit Command is recorded below: (1) According to the report from Brigade Commander Ma Dongwei, (A) The bandits in Huluo'ao are being suppressed by Dong Chenzhi's three regiments and the 13th Cavalry Company along the Jiquan-Liuquan line. The bandits stubbornly resisted, but after our fierce attack, they fled to Juliang Mountain and continued to resist from the stronghold. The 13th Company was ordered to launch several fierce attacks, but due to the dangerous terrain, they could not be eliminated. All three infantry regiments were then ordered to encircle Juliang Mountain, coordinating with Guo Regiment of Chen Division stationed in Gaozhuang, demarcating the northeast, south, and southwest sides of Juliang Mountain as our defensive lines. The western and southwestern mountain gullies would be Guo Regiment's defensive lines. The bandits, seeing the situation was critical, suddenly fled towards Huluo'ao from the southwestern mountain gully. The 13th Cavalry Company was ordered to pursue them. Due to the late hour, it was not convenient to pursue them relentlessly. It is estimated that about two to three hundred bandits fled this time, and many were killed by our machine guns or fell to their deaths in the mountain streams. (B) The remaining bandits here are scattered in small groups. The Third Infantry Regiment, attached with the Third Company of the Cavalry Battalion, has been ordered to search and attack along the Liuquan-Ji line towards Huluo'ao. According to Brigade Commander Ma Dongwei's telegram, (A) At 9:00 PM, the bandits on Juliang Mountain were severely attacked by Guo Regiment of Chen Division. A portion fled northwest and dozens were captured alive. One platoon leader and four soldiers from our unit were injured, and one platoon leader was killed. (B) The Third Infantry Regiment, attached with the Second Cavalry Company, has been ordered to strictly suppress the fleeing bandits and search for hidden bandits near Juliang Mountain. The Third Infantry Regiment, attached with the Second Cavalry Company, is pursuing them. (C) According to the captured bandits, the bandit leaders are mostly hiding, and scattered bandits are wearing military uniforms, secretly hiding weapons, and acting as scouts for the army. (2) According to the telegram from Division Commander Chen Dongwei, (A) The bandits occupying Juliang Mountain, Laotou Mountain, and Laoma Mountain were encircled by Dong Yixie and Ma Brigade on all sides. At 6:00 PM, they charged twice towards the defensive line of Xu Regiment to the west, but were repulsed by our army. They then broke out to the northwest and were ambushed by Chen Battalion at Laoshan Waist, suffering heavy casualties, with more than 30 bandits killed, two bandit family members captured, seven horses, more than ten mules, and six guns seized. The bandits then fled towards Jiaoshan area. (B) There are no more bandits at Juliang Mountain, Laotou Mountain, etc. A portion of Xu Regiment has been transferred to Juliang Mountain, while Guo Regiment is still searching for hidden bandits in Xiangshan, etc. (3) According to the telegram from Division Commander Gu Jiangwu, (A) The bandits attacking Huiquan Gu Mountain were surrounded by Li Battalion of Kong Regiment, and many bandits were killed by artillery fire. The remaining bandits fled southwest. (B) Tang Brigade and Kang Regiment are strictly searching along the mountain streams, while Xue Regiment is strictly searching the streams in the east and west Yangjiaquan areas. (C) About three hundred bandits occupying Da Xiaocang Mountain were ordered to be suppressed by the Engineer Battalion. According to reports, before reaching Cang Mountain, the bandits seized the opportunity to flee far north. (4) All units have been ordered to search and suppress the bandits in order to eliminate them as soon as possible. Seal of Jiangyou, Staff Office of the Third Route of Teng County.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a letter from Teng County reported on the bandit suppression situation, stating that many bandits have fled after being suppressed. Some are in groups of six or seven, others in groups of a dozen or more. The village militias have been exerting extraordinary efforts, searching everywhere, and blocking roads even at night. Each township captures and sends more than a dozen or twenty bandits to the city every day. A few days ago, it was discovered in Fanchuan District that bandit leader Wang Shiyuan (a major bandit leader for more than ten years) was hiding in a certain village. When attacking, the Qingxiang Brigade from the city also assisted. After fighting for a day, his house was burned down, and Wang Shiyuan and four of his accomplices were burned to death. His wife and four accomplices were captured alive. His wife identified them correctly, and their heads were cut off and photographed for reporting. In Menglitian District, giant bandit Cheng Liu, a native of Yi County, was captured yesterday, along with 1,200 silver dollars and considerable gold items. The merchant militia captured bandit leader Yu Hongxiang and five accomplices in Zhaogou Village. In addition to these three bandit leaders, many other less known bandits have been captured. Many captured Mauser pistols and rifles have been turned over to the respective districts for their own use. Therefore, the people all have the intention of getting rich and obtaining guns. Whenever they encounter bandits, they bravely capture them. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Xun Chamber of Commerce Petitions for the Abolition of the Jiujiang Regular Customs <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiujiang General Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting yesterday in Nanchang, resolving to petition the Ministry of Finance to, in accordance with the Central Government's resolution, promptly abolish the Jiujiang Regular Customs to comply with government orders and alleviate merchants' hardships. The original petition stated: "On April 2nd of this year, we received the Ministry's Guan Zi No. 1227 instruction, stating that the petitioner, Wang Rufang, Chairman of the Jiujiang General Chamber of Commerce, et al., submitted a document, approving the Hubei Inland Qiyang Timber Merchants Association's letter stating that small rafts transported from Han were sealed after passing through Jiujiang. They requested a detailed explanation of the true situation of the customs. The reply indicated that the case had already been instructed to the Timber Merchants Association for compliance, etc. We humbly note that within the resolution on abolishing likin in five provinces, the seventh item of the second step for abolishing regular customs stipulated that regular customs duties and surtaxes within fifty li of commercial ports should be completely abolished by the end of that year (the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930]). This grand resolution has spread far and wide, and all Chinese people who heard it were delighted. However, Hubei had already abolished them, while Jiujiang still retains them. What one has, the other lacks. Taxation is unequal, which is of no benefit to the country but only harms the people. The government's prestige and the people's sentiments are greatly affected, so we must report this to the Ministry. The Jiujiang Regular Customs has been established for a long time. Now, the new customs tariff, new business tax regulations, and five consolidated taxes have all been implemented in order. If all revenues can be collected for public use, the national treasury's income will be ample. If the regular customs duties are not resolutely abolished, it will not affect other tax revenues in the end. The Ministry spares no effort in reorganizing finances and eliminates evil completely. How can it retain this corrupt practice and discriminate against the Jiangxi people, causing the world to criticize it? This is the first reason why respecting the government's prestige requires the abolition of the Jiujiang Regular Customs. Our party's revolution was originally to relieve the suffering of the people and eliminate excessive levies. Since the Ministry convened a five-province conference on abolishing likin and resolved to abolish all regular customs within fifty li of commercial ports in phases, except for the three regular customs on the land borders, the Jiujiang Regular Customs still exists. Everyone else benefits, but we alone are left out. Moreover, the disparity in taxation concerns the rise and fall of commerce. Merchants, due to the heavy taxes in Jiujiang, have changed their routes to other places, causing Jiujiang's commerce to decline and Hubei's commerce to develop. Is Hubei moving towards the Three Principles of the People, while Jiangxi is independent in a different realm? What is the meaning of national equality and a world for all? Our government treats the people like wounded, and should treat everyone equally, and should not do this. Moreover, in recent years, banditry has been rampant, wealth has been exhausted, and the people are impoverished, with almost no survivors. As the ancient saying goes, wealth gathers when the people scatter, and wealth scatters when the people gather. Extending a lifeline to the people of Jiangxi is to cultivate a portion of vitality for the country. This is the second reason why considering the people's sentiments requires the abolition of the Jiujiang Regular Customs. The affiliated association leads the merchants and dares to express their feelings and plead. We implore the Ministry to carefully examine and consider the merchants' hardships and swiftly resolve this matter to comfort the people's expectations. We are extremely anxious and await your orders." (May 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Strike at Lieshan Coal Mine in Sixian County <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Due to Complications Arising from the Arrest of Bandits by Garrison Troops</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Lieshan Coal Mine in Sixian County is the most famous mineral production in Anhui Province. The annual output of coal exceeds ten million tons, and the fuel for the three provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan mostly relies on it. Since the autumn of last year, the Lieshan Coal Mine Bureau was reorganized into the state-private joint Lieshan Coal Mine Company. The board of directors actively repaired the damaged coal mines in the mining area. Currently, there are three intact coal mines that can produce 300 tons of coal per day. In October last year, the Anhui Garrison Second Brigade, under Chen Xiaosi, was transferred from western Shandong to Anhui. The mining authorities then requested and obtained Chairman Chen's approval to have the Song Battalion of the Qu Zheng Regiment of the Chen Brigade stationed at Lieshan to protect the coal mine. Before long, the Chen Brigade was transferred to western Anhui to suppress the communists, and the company's original mine police were responsible for protection. In March of this year, Wang Jun, the commander of the Jinpu Railway Garrison, deployed troops to garrison the Sixian County area along the Jinpu Line, taking charge of protecting the railway. All areas within fifty li on both sides of the railway belonged to the garrison area. The Lieshan Coal Mine Company, because the area around the mine was entirely bandit territory and the bandits were exceptionally rampant, and because the mining area was located within fifty li west of the railway (Lieshan is only forty-five li from Fuliji), petitioned Wang Jun to send troops to be stationed at Lieshan for protection. Wang, because his troops needed to concentrate on training, initially did not immediately approve. Last month, Wang ordered the Gong Chaomei Regiment of the Twentieth Brigade stationed in Sixian to send the third battalion commander, Li Peng, to lead troops to search and suppress the bandits in the Caili area. On the second of this month, Li, based on a report, believed that there were bandits hiding near the Lieshan mining area. He then led eight soldiers from the Suixi battalion headquarters to Lieshan for inspection. As soon as they arrived at the street entrance, they saw a person standing by the side of the street eating zongzi, appearing suspicious. Just as they were about to go forward to inquire, the person hurriedly fled into a restaurant beside the street and opened fire. Li Peng's horse was immediately wounded. Li then ordered the soldiers to fire back. The Lieshan mine protection team, upon hearing the news, also came out to assist in the attack. For a time, the sound of gunfire was incessant. The soldiers and police also set fire to the restaurant's thatched house. The bandit then committed suicide inside. Li's unit captured a Mauser pistol. Afterwards, Li, believing that there were bandits in the mining area, thought that the mine workers were colluding with them. That night, he deployed two companies to Lieshan, thoroughly searching the coal factory and nearby houses, arresting several mine workers and taking them to the battalion headquarters for interrogation. In the following days, he arrested more than thirty workers. Yesterday (the 6th), he also arrested Xu Ziqin, the well work manager of the engineering department. As a result, the workers in each coal mine went on strike and fled one after another, causing the mining work to be suspended. Lu Zidong, the general manager of the Lieshan General Company, upon receiving the report, immediately went from Bengbu to Xuzhou to meet Wang Jun, requesting that he promptly stop Li's unit from arresting workers. Assistant Manager Wu Zijiu will also go to Beijing from Bengbu to report to the board of directors and submit a document to the Ministry of Industry to report the incident, so they can investigate and handle it.

<h3 id="e74">The Loss and Aftermath of the Haiyuan Pavilion Collection (Continued) <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>At the time when the Yang family was transporting the books, the local government here had already received a report from Liaocheng, deeply fearing that they would flow into foreign lands. There was a time when considerable measures were taken. At the same time, newspapers everywhere reported it one after another. The provincial government and the Department of Education had successively received letters from both the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, inquiring about this case. The Department of Education and the Department of Civil Affairs then dispatched personnel to jointly investigate and properly devise a plan for the aftermath and safekeeping. I was one of the personnel dispatched by the Department of Education. The result of the joint investigation with the Department of Civil Affairs was roughly the same as the aforementioned. We also contacted the Yang residence and received their reply, stating that the remaining books stored in Liaocheng had indeed been transported here in their entirety and were currently nailed up in boxes. Because the grand lady was ill, they had no time to examine them. Once she recovered from her illness and the arrangement was complete, they would invite people from all walks of life to visit again. Since I had received a clear order to devise a proper safekeeping plan and had also received questions from people everywhere who were concerned about this matter, stating that the Yang family's collection of books was very important to culture and that the provincial library had a responsibility to devise a secure plan for it, the one who criticized the most strongly was Mr. Zheng Yuanju of Qingdao. Under this clear order and criticism, I first indirectly asked the Yang family for their opinion. As a result, the Yang family also very much wanted a proper safekeeping plan. They instructed me to first state the library's opinions and outline them for their consideration. After consulting with the supervising officer and obtaining his agreement, I put forward three plans as a draft. In the late part of this month, I entrusted someone to deliver it to the Yang family. Up to now, I have not received a formal reply. I only received a letter from Mr. Yang Jingfu, saying, "I have just received your letter. I have learned everything with respect. I am always grateful for your concern. As for the draft agreement, I will reply in detail in another letter. I am writing to inform you first." Apart from this, there was also an indirect verbal expression that after the grand lady recovered from her illness, she would invite important relatives and family members to discuss it in detail before replying. This matter concerns the Yang family themselves and all aspects, so it cannot be handled carelessly. Before receiving a reply, the news I received from the Yang family was that the grand lady and trusted family members, in view of the changes in the world in recent years, had a tendency to comply with the library's proposals. They had no preconceived notions about these three plans and were planning to make an unprecedented righteous act in the cultural aspect of the entire province in order to honor their ancestors. However, they must wait until Mr. Yang Jingfu comes to Jinan before they can make a final decision. The quarterly journal is about to be published. What I should report to the country about this case is also up to the present situation. How to reply in the future and all the aftermath will not be allowed by the time at this moment. However, I will attach the proposal made by our library to the Yang family (the terms, namely the draft outline of the agreement, have been recorded in the previous report) for the reference of those who are concerned about this matter. At the same time, regarding the Yang family's collection of books, I dare to make the following conclusion based on my personal observations: The Yang family's first transfer of rare books to Tianjin was in view of the local chaos during the Zhang Zongchang era, when his subordinates often thought of seizing them for themselves. For the sake of preservation and safety, they had no choice but to handle it in this way. It was not to sell them in Tianjin. The second transfer to Jinan was also really forced by the bandit turmoil in recent years. There was no other intention. Judging from the facts and speaking fairly, both transfers of books were very proper actions. With millions of heavy items, who would deliberately move them unless it was absolutely necessary? The one to blame for being forced to do this should be the environment, not the Yang family. If there had been no first transfer of books, then in this turmoil, the seeds of Tao Nan's rare books would have been cut off from then on. As far as I know, Yang Jingfu is indeed very upright and honest. As for his grand lady, she is painstakingly guarding the books, betting her life on them. We especially admire her decisive spirit. However, today's situation is not what it used to be. What we hope for from the Yang family is to repeatedly change their previous rigid viewpoint and make arrangements that are beneficial to themselves and others for permanent preservation. At the same time, social people, if they really love books and love culture, should also put themselves in the Yang family's shoes and devise a way out for them, and should not make irresponsible criticisms and empty talk, or force the parties to dispel their original intention of sharing their goodness with others in the heat of passion. Everyone can know the preciousness of the Yang family's books. Everyone can say that they are related to culture and should be preserved and not lost. However, the degree of their knowledge may stop there. If you ask them how to find a way and how to preserve them, they will stare blankly and be unable to answer. Furthermore, if you ask them to find a way and handle it, they will be even more hesitant and avoid it, not daring to admit it themselves and not wanting to be involved in the slightest, while the laughter and scolding behind their backs remain the same. Alas, is this what those who love people with virtue should do? (The End)</p>

<p>Yesterday, a Memorial Meeting Was Held at the City Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Advocating Resisting Japanese Goods to Avenge This Singular Disgrace</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the 16th anniversary of the "May 9th" National Humiliation. The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters Propaganda Department specially convened people from all walks of life to hold a memorial meeting in the auditorium on the third floor of the City Party Headquarters. More than 800 representatives from various circles attended. The meeting was presided over by Yang Qingyuan, Minister of the City Propaganda Department, who reported the facts of the "May 9th" National Humiliation and gave detailed instructions on how to avenge the humiliation. Afterwards, the representatives successively gave speeches and shouted slogans before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>City Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Meeting Order (1) Stand at attention in unison; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Pay the highest respects to the Party and National flags and the portrait of the late Premier; (4) Chairman respectfully reads the late Premier's will; (5) Observe silence; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Speeches; (8) Shout slogans; (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives Representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Discussion Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Municipal Government, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the First District Party Headquarters, the Second District Party Headquarters, the Third District Party Headquarters, the Fourth District Party Headquarters, the Fifth District Party Headquarters, the Li Jiao Federation, the Citizens' Association, the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, the Shipbuilding Workers' Union, the Hat-Making Workers' Union, the Toothbrush Industry Workers' Union, the Boy Scout Council, the Cigarette Workers' Union, the Silk Reeling Workers' Union, the Publishing Workers' Union, the Cosmetics Trade Association, and other labor groups, as well as representatives from various schools and Party headquarters at all levels, totaling more than 800 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Comrades, representatives, today is the anniversary of the "May 9th" National Humiliation. Our people are intellectually immature, politically corrupt, culturally backward, and industrially declining. Moreover, our country is vast in territory and rich in resources, but production is not yet wealthy, so it is suitable to be the target of imperialist aggression, the fish and meat on the chopping board. Before the Meiji Restoration in Japan, the weakness of its national power and the shackles of unequal treaties were no less difficult than in our country. However, after the Restoration, the whole country, from top to bottom, united to work hard and govern diligently. In a few years, unequal treaties were lifted, international status was restored, and industry developed and thrived, and the national power was rising day by day. However, the territory is small and the raw materials are lacking, especially the two important raw materials for industrial development, coal and iron. The domestic population is also increasing day by day. Therefore, in order to complete the solid foundation of imperialism, it turned from an oppressed nation into an oppressing nation. However, all the weak nations in the world are slaughtered by the world powers, and the development in the east, west, south, and north is hindered. Therefore, they went west to attack our vast Republic of China, which is vast in territory and rich in resources. At first, in the Sino-Japanese War, our navy was defeated, and we ceded land and paid reparations, and the losses were great. Later, Japan believed that Russia was also invading our country in the same way, and the interests conflicted, so it decided to fight. After the Russo-Japanese War, Russia was defeated miserably, so Japan was complacent, looked down on the world, and was booming and hot. Then, the European War broke out, and the European and American powers were busy fighting each other and had no time to look east. Japan thought that this opportunity was hard to come by. At that time, it was precisely the time to invade our great Republic of China with great fanfare, an opportunity that would not come for thousands of years. Therefore, under the pretext of declaring war on Germany, it seized our Qingdao and occupied the Jiaoji Railway, and put forward twenty-one articles. The insane and mad pseudo-government of Beijing, under the guise of loan relations, actually recognized it. However, our people unanimously opposed it, and without legal signature recognition, the treaty was invalid. However, after a careful examination of the twenty-one articles, we can see a glimpse of the Japanese people's intentions. Now, it may be useful to briefly analyze it. The content of the first item is to seize the rights to port bays, railways, and mines leased by Germany in Shandong Province. The second item is to actively annex our Manchuria and Mongolia. The third item is to seize the right to dispose of the assets of the Hanyeping Company and the right to exploit nearby mines. The fourth item is to encompass all the ports and islands along our coast. The fifth item is to monopolize our domestic affairs, such as military police, finance, transportation, and culture. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese want to destroy our country and exterminate our species. Since the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese policy of invading our country has been consistent from beginning to end. The May 30th Massacre in Shanghai and the May 3rd Jinan Massacre after the Northern Expeditionary Army rose up have emerged one after another, and they all want to destroy our country before they are happy. Recently, our country has been working hard to govern and is seeking construction. The status of the National Government is becoming more and more consolidated. In addition to jealousy, the Japanese people have taken advantage of some misunderstandings in the two Guangdong provinces to fabricate rumors and sow discord, lest our country be in chaos. All our people should be alarmed by the sinister intentions and poisonous methods. Today, we solemnly commemorate the "May 9th" National Humiliation. If we want to avenge the humiliation and wash away the shame, we can only do so if the whole country, from top to bottom, is of one heart and one mind. The only shortcut is to resist Japanese goods. Our country's resistance to Japanese goods did not start today, but unfortunately, we have repeatedly spoken of resistance, but we have repeatedly lacked perseverance, which has led to the failure to achieve the effect of resistance, but has instead left foreigners with the ridicule of a five-minute fever. After shame and anger, we should strengthen our will and unify our steps, and take the resistance to foreign goods as an important task of our people. Then, Japan, which sells 54% of its products to our country every year, will inevitably face economic panic and collapse. Since the increase in customs tariffs, in the recent two or three months, Japanese people have established more than 500 factories in various parts of Shanghai. Their sinister intentions are like this. Can our people not be careful? This is the first point that we should strive for in commemorating the "May 9th" National Humiliation. Second, eliminate the Red bandits. The Red bandits are a disaster to our country's interior and are a serious problem. If this is not eliminated, not only will the internal strife continue, but also the industry will never have the hope of revival. The livelihood problem and the revolutionary construction will all become empty talk. In the future, the government will continue to work hard to eliminate them step by step. The people should also devote themselves to the Baojia movement to defend themselves. Third, the National Assembly, which the whole country is looking forward to, held its first official meeting on the 8th, gathering elites from all over the country. Gathering together, discussing the major affairs of the Party and the country, we will be able to get to the point of the current situation, and the abolition of unequal treaties is the top priority of our country today. I think the National Assembly will pay attention to this and have practical measures, so that the success of diplomacy depends on whether the people have a strong backing. I hope that the compatriots in this city will devote themselves to national diplomacy in order to achieve the victory of the government's diplomacy. Today, on the occasion of the extremely painful commemoration of the "May 9th" National Humiliation, I put forward these three points as encouragement to the attending representatives and all the citizens. Afterwards, representatives such as Jin Xihan successively gave speeches, and the words were omitted due to length.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans (1) Do not forget the May 9th National Humiliation; (2) Abolish consular jurisdiction; (3) Recover all concessions in the country; (4) Abolish all unequal treaties; (5) Overthrow Japanese imperialism; (6) Continue to resist foreign goods; (7) Support the National Assembly; (8) Strive for revolutionary construction; (9) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (10) Long live the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Regulations on the Scope of Smuggling Suppression by Customs</p>
<p>Japanese fishing boats have repeatedly been heard to have invaded our country's territorial waters. In order to prevent such incidents from happening again, the central ministries have held meetings to clearly define and publicize the territorial sea boundary line. Since the territorial sea boundary line is stipulated, no fishing boats of any country are allowed to invade it in order to maintain sovereignty. The Ministry of Finance has also clearly stipulated the scope of smuggling suppression. It has now been decided to publicize it. Yesterday, the local shipping companies received an order from the Ministry forwarded by the Shipping Association, which said: The case is based on Instruction No. 1613 of the Ministry of Communications, and the case is based on an outline of the Instruction of the Executive Yuan: In the past, the Ministry of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Navy, and Industry jointly requested the planning of the territorial sea boundary line and the scope of smuggling suppression by customs in order to protect sovereignty. It has now been submitted to the 21st State Council meeting of this court for resolution. The scope of the territorial sea is set at three nautical miles, and the scope of smuggling suppression by customs is set at twelve nautical miles. The Ministry of Finance is to formulate the implementation and announcement measures for the scope of smuggling suppression and submit them for review. In addition to submitting them to the National Government for record and ordering the Ministry of Finance to comply with them, they are also ordered to be known and to inform their subordinates to be known in the same way (omitted below).</p>

<p>Rescheduled to May 31st</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Manzhouli air route planned by Eurasia Aviation Corporation was originally scheduled to officially open on the 15th of this month. The company officially notified this newspaper yesterday that it would change the date to May 31st to start postal transportation. The Shanghai-Manzhouli flight route is 10,000 kilometers long and can be reached in one and a half days, which is five or six days faster than ordinary postal delivery. In the future, beacons will be installed at each station to prepare for night flights, so that this route can be connected with the air routes of Soviet Russia and Germany, and the postal route from Shanghai to Europe can be reached in three days.</p>
<p>Reasons for Postponement Eurasia Aviation Corporation sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, saying: In reply, the Shanghai-Manzhouli air route of our company was originally scheduled to officially open on May 15th to carry mail.

However, Chief Ke of the Postal Liaison Office of the Directorate General of Posts informed Li Jingzong, director of the company's operations department, on the 8th of this month that the issue of charging for air mail sent from abroad to China has not yet been sent to the International Postal Union. If the flight opens on the 15th, I am afraid that there will be no mail to transport from the plane returning from Manzhouli. In order to maintain the company's business interests, it is decided to officially open the flight on May 31st (Sunday). In addition to sending letters separately, this letter is sent for your reference.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Representatives of the National Coal Production and Sales Association Petition in Beijing <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Audience with Commanders-in-Chief Jiang and Deputy Commander Zhang</p>
<p>Requesting the Recovery of Kailuan and Other Three Items</p>
<p>And Submitting a Request to the Ministry of Railways to Reduce Freight Rates</p>
<p>According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, the National Coal Production and Sales Association has appointed Yu Shunqing, Zhang Zilian, and Huang Jicheng as representatives to go to Beijing today to petition Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Northeast Deputy Commander Zhang. At the same time, they will submit a request to the Ministry of Railways to reduce the freight rates for domestic coal. The text of the petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition to Jiang and Zhang The case is to state three points, recommend representatives, and visit to petition. The Kailuan Company's joint venture agreement was signed in June of the first year of the Republic of China. Article 17 stipulates that ten years after the signing of this contract, the Luanzhou Company shall have the right to buy back all the assets of the Kaiping Company at a fair value agreed upon by both parties. To this day, the deadline has long passed. The Luanzhou Company has failed to prepare the price for the buyback, losing its sovereignty. The Kaiping Company relies on unequal treaties as a talisman to manipulate China's coal market, so that China's coal is squeezed out and cannot develop. It should be ordered that the Luanzhou Company prepare the price for the buyback. If the Luanzhou Company is unable to handle it or delays it, the government should raise funds to redeem it. This is the first thing to petition for. The stockpiles of coal in various mines are mountainous, but the roads do not allocate vehicles for transportation, resulting in coal shortages in various places. Various factories are in danger of suspending work. At this time, when domestic goods are sprouting, they are fighting fiercely with foreign goods. If they suspend work, they will give foreign goods an opportunity to take advantage of. It should be ordered that the Beining Railway Bureau allocate as many vehicles as possible to transport Datong, Jingxing,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Liugegou, Tongbao, Zhengfeng, and the stockpiles of coal in various mines under Hebei Province to save the coal shortage. This is the second thing to petition for. There are various reasons why domestic coal cannot develop, and the fact that foreign coal relies on unequal treaties to enjoy the right to specially reduced freight rates is the main reason for restricting the development of our country's coal. Therefore, the association has proposed a proposal to reduce the freight rates for domestic coal in the National Business and Transportation Conference to provide relief. Today, domestic coal is becoming more and more declining, and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau suddenly increased the coal freight rates by 20% from May 1st. This is not only failing to reduce the rates, but also intensifying the situation. It should be ordered that the Jiaoji Railway Bureau cancel the new regulations and continue to charge according to the old regulations. In addition, all roads should follow the old regulations regarding coal freight rates. This is the third thing to petition for. In summary, the above three points are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. It is appropriate to appoint Zhang Zilian, Huang Jicheng, and Yu Shunqing as representatives to hold a petition to visit your seat. I implore you to examine and approve it and issue orders separately to directly relieve domestic coal and indirectly promote domestic goods. It is a public convenience. Respectfully presented to Commander-in-Chief Jiang of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and Deputy Commander Zhang, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Coal Production and Sales Association of the Republic of China, Standing Committee Members Fang Jiaobo, Hong Yanbin, Sheng Pihua, and Liu Yumen, respectfully presented.</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Railways The case is for petitioning. The decline of domestic coal urgently needs to be relieved. The association has been running around and appealing, originally hoping to promote and develop it. It has submitted a proposal to the Business and Transportation Conference convened and convened by your ministry, requesting discussion of relief measures. At that time, it was resolved that the freight rates should be considered based on the coal production cost and selling price of each mine, etc. In addition, the Jiaoji Railway Administration sent a letter No. 963 Jiazi to the association on November 30 of last year, stating: After our road implemented the Ministry-issued tiered freight rates on November 1st, outsiders did not understand and thought that the freight rates had increased. There were many misunderstandings regarding coal. According to the new freight rates, coal is included in the sixth class. According to the old freight rates, the average reduction is 30%. The export coal price is still charged at 2.52 yuan per ton, and there has been no change so far. I am deeply afraid that the rumors will spread and the misunderstandings will become deeper. I hereby send this letter for your reference and to inform your colleagues so as to avoid misunderstandings, etc. Each is on file. Now I hear that the Jiaoji Railway Administration has decided to increase the coal freight rates by 20% from May 1st of this year. Coal merchants and merchants are terrified after listening. The domestic coal is being squeezed out by foreign coal and is struggling on the verge of death. Helping it and supporting it may have the hope of development. Now, suddenly, when domestic coal is beyond redemption, the freight rates are increased again. This is a plan to add insult to injury. The matter is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. The association's heart is in danger and dares not remain silent. It is reasonable to present it to your ministry for examination and approval. I implore you to order the Jiaoji Railway Administration to cancel the previous proposal and continue to handle it according to the old regulations in order to maintain it and relieve the business difficulties. It is a public convenience. In addition to sending letters separately, respectfully presented to the Ministry of Railways, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Coal Production and Sales Association of the Republic of China, Standing Committee Members Fang Jiaobo, Hong Yanbin, Sheng Pihua, and Liu Yumen, respectfully presented.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Letter Requesting the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce to Mediate the Kailuan Coal Dispute <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Two Legal Groups Sent Letters to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Asking for Substantial Assistance</p>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce Federation of the Republic of China and the National Federation of Industrial Associations sent a letter to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: Domestic factories use Kailuan coal as the main fuel. In recent months, Kailuan coal has not arrived in port, and various factories have not purchased and stockpiled coal in advance due to economic reasons. Coal prices have soared for a while, with an average daily loss of about hundreds of thousands of yuan. Industrial stagnation and labor unemployment have been greatly affected, not only by Japanese coal taking the opportunity to seize the market. In addition to telegraphing the government for relief, we have also publicly appointed Dr. Qian Chengxu, director of the National Federation of Industrial Associations, to make a special trip to Tianjin to dredge coal transportation. I hope that your chamber of commerce will take into account the difficulties faced by the national industry, commerce, and labor and provide substantial assistance as soon as possible. Benefiting the national economy and people's livelihood will be immeasurable. Correspondingly send a letter, and please check and contact. Sincerely, Lin Kanghou, National Chamber of Commerce Federation of the Republic of China, Wang Xiaolai, National Federation of Industrial Associations, to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks for Exemption from Increased Freight Rates for Shanxi Coal on the Ping-Sui Railway <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>To Relieve the Coal Shortage Between Tianjin and Shanghai</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday, saying: Nanjing Ministry of Railways, may your Majesty be informed that on the 8th of this month, we received a letter from the Coal Industry Federation of Kou Dong Station on the Ping-Sui Railway, stating that the coal reserves of the Datong Coalfield in Shanxi are the richest in the world, and the coal quality is excellent. It is especially famous at home and abroad for its use in industrial boats. However, because it is located in the hinterland, it is restricted by the expensive freight rates on the Ping-Sui Railway and it is difficult to export. The northern part of Shanxi has always been a poor area that has suffered from wars and droughts and is unable to make a living. The only way to provide relief is to open up coal mines on a large scale so that they can be sold smoothly at home and abroad, so that the people can be relieved. Therefore, the Taiyuan General Chamber of Commerce proposed to reduce the freight rates on the Ping-Sui Railway at the National Business and Transportation Conference in March in order to remedy the situation. Indeed, if Shanxi coal cannot be exported for one day, the livelihoods of the Shanxi people will not be stable for one day. At that time, the masses were leading the way and said that the National Government was working hard to deal with the aftermath and would surely care about the difficulties of the merchants and approve the request. The Ping-Sui Railway Bureau recently announced that it had received an order from the Ministry of Railways that, from May 1st, the freight for each ton of coal from Kouquan to Fengtai, which originally cost about six yuan, would be increased by 15%, which is almost seven yuan per ton. Not only did it not show concern, but it also intensified the situation, causing large and small coal mines in northern Shanxi to intend to suspend work, and tens of thousands of workers would lose their jobs. The livelihoods of the Shanxi people are becoming more and more deteriorated. As far as Shanxi Province is concerned, the harm to merchants and the impact on the local area are already unimaginable. At present, it is also the time when Kailuan is experiencing problems. The various ports of Tianjin and Hebei are experiencing coal shortages. People from all walks of life are calling out and running around to maintain the situation and are sparing no effort. The excellent anthracite coal in northern Shanxi is suitable for transporting more at this time to relieve the fuel shortage in various ports and to serve as a backing for recovering foreign capital and operating the Kailuan coal mine. It is possible to meet the expectations of the late Premier's industry to save the country and to comfort the dying merchants and people. Moreover, state-owned railways were originally intended to develop transportation, open up industry, encourage domestic products, and support trade as prerequisites. Anything related to people's livelihood and maintaining foreign trade should be assisted and encouraged to cultivate its foundation in order to be in line with the main purpose of state-owned enterprises. Today, it is acting arbitrarily, only seeking the meager profits of the railway's current income, and causing endless harm to all parties. As a result, both sides will inevitably suffer losses and all goods will be suspended. The railway bureau's income will inevitably be greatly reduced as a result. Fellow merchants, as merchants, could not fathom the purpose of this price increase. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Railways and the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau and Shanxi Provincial Government Chairman Shang separately, please implore you to take back the order to increase prices again, and respectfully send a detailed letter, respectfully requesting your strong assistance and to appeal on our behalf, etc. The same day, we also received a telegram from the Datong County Chamber of Commerce in Shanxi with the same information. Although the various roads have increased freight rates across the board due to high metal prices, Shanxi coal is the only source of profit in the province. At this time, when the war has just ended, the province is in a state of disrepair. If the coal mines are suspended due to high prices and slow sales, tens of thousands more miners will lose their jobs, which will cause even more damage to the local area. Moreover, at a time when the source of Kailuan coal is scarce, from Tianjin in the north to Shanghai in the south, they are all suffering from coal shortages and are planning to dredge the domestic coal transportation to provide relief. If freight rates are increased again and the source of coal supply is blocked, not only will it cause great hidden worries for Shanxi Province, but it will also lead to industrial panic in Tianjin and Shanghai. Therefore, even if freight rates are increased across the board, domestic mine coal should be excluded. I dare to express my feelings and earnestly request that the Ministry of Railways examine and approve it and order the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau to handle the freight for Shanxi coal according to the old regulations in order to maintain it and relieve the business difficulties. It is a public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Slaughter Tax Questioned Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>News from Both Government and Business Sides</p>
<p>Meat Industry Association Meeting. The Shanghai City Pig, Beef, and Mutton Industry Association held a general meeting at Zhizhong Li in the French Concession on the afternoon of the 8th of this month. Representatives from urban and rural areas, Shanghai South, Zhabei, as well as Wusong, Jiangwan, Gaoqiao, Hongqiao, Longhua, Sanlintang, Caojing, Yangjing, Lan Nidu, Tangqiao, Yangjiadu, Lao B渡, Gaojiahang, Yangsiqiao, Pusongshi, Beixinjing, Xujiahui, Caojiadu, Zhenru, Lujiahang, Zhangjialou, Shiba Jian, Dai Nítang, Donggou, Zhangjiaqiao, Qichangzhan, Wang Mansiqiao, Hua Shao Gao Temple, Hongzhen, Qiujiangqiao, Fahua and other places, totaling more than 600 people, held a meeting as usual. Chairman Rong Qianchu reported that representatives were sent to Beijing to sincerely petition the Management Office and the Executive Yuan of the Central Government to abolish the slaughter tax and all miscellaneous taxes based on the principle of "one item, one tax" advocated by the late Premier, and to recognize the business tax. The circumstances of the discussions were reported. It was also discussed that the Municipal Finance Bureau took over the collection of the slaughter tax in the Chinese area of the city, using whole books of tickets, with the tax amount remaining the same, but all businesses were unwilling to buy. (1) It was resolved that armed police should be added to the slaughterhouses in Shanghai South and Zhabei today to supervise veterinarians exceeding their authority, and it was stated that if pigs were slaughtered without buying tickets, all white pigs would be detained and not allowed to be released. (2) It was resolved to adopt two methods: on the one hand, to submit a request to the Municipal Government to abolish the slaughter tax and all miscellaneous taxes and recognize the business tax; on the other hand, to petition the Executive Yuan of the Central Government again to implement the principle of "one item, one tax." Then, the pig, beef, and mutton industries jointly held a meeting and firmly agreed to the city-wide business tax and were willing to abolish the slaughter tax, as well as the inspection fees before and after slaughter, and the rural doctors' fees, and proceed in unison. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Finance Bureau's Statement. The person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau stated as follows yesterday: (1) The slaughter tax in the urban area has been approved by the central government and designated as a special fund for Jiangsu Province's education expenses. It has been levied for a long time. In April of this year, the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office and the Shanghai Municipal Government agreed to hand it over to the Municipal Government for collection and disbursement. The Bureau was ordered to handle it, which was originally a collection on behalf of the Bureau and not a newly added tax. (2) This slaughter tax was contracted by merchants in 1919. At the end of April, the Bureau was ordered to directly collect it from May 1. At that time, representatives of the Su, Hu, and Ning gangs and other business people submitted petitions to contract the tax. The Bureau believed that direct collection was the principle of streamlining taxes and that merchants contracting the tax would inevitably lead to private gain and monopoly, which would be detrimental to both the government and the people. Therefore, after being ordered to take over, the Bureau immediately planned to proceed and rejected all requests for contracting. (3) After the Bureau took over, it continued to collect taxes according to the original tax rate when it was run by merchants, which was 3.9 cents per pig and 2 cents per sheep. The various meat businesses did not increase their burden. However, since the announcement of the collection, the various meat businesses have been waiting and seeing and have not come to purchase tax tickets. The Bureau initially believed that it was the beginning of the takeover and the time was very tight, and the meat business people may not have fully understood. It ordered the various collection offices to send personnel to persuade them separately, and temporarily registered the number of pigs slaughtered daily. Unexpectedly, until yesterday, the various meat businesses still used the excuse of waiting for the Association to resolve the issue and refused to purchase tax tickets. Now, in order to implement the laws and regulations, it is not convenient to delay any further, and it will be strictly enforced this morning. (4) When the slaughter tax in the urban area was previously handled by contractors, the various meat businesses had no objections. Even this time, when it was transferred to the Municipal Government for collection on behalf of the Municipal Government, representatives were recommended and submitted petitions to contract the tax. This shows that the various meat businesses have a proper understanding of the slaughter tax. Moreover, this tax revenue is allocated to Jiangsu Province's education expenses. It is hoped that meat business people will continue to pay it so that education expenses will not be affected.</p>
<p>Health Bureau's Advice. The Shanghai City Slaughter Tax was previously contracted by the county government to merchants on behalf of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Now, because the Shanghai Municipal Government legally exercises its governance rights, it has been changed to be collected on behalf of the Municipal Finance Bureau, abolishing the contractor system, verifying the fees according to the number of animals, and eliminating private gain, so as to ensure that public funds are used for public purposes. The amount of tax collected is still the same as before, with a slaughter tax of 3.9 cents per head, with no increase. When the business tax is implemented in the future, the name of the slaughter tax will be changed. Unexpectedly, a small number of contractors, because they cannot contract the tax and cannot profit from it, have created various rumors and misled the meat merchants, leading them to stop importing goods. The Municipal Health Bureau, because it has been handling the inspection of livestock for many years and knows the inside information of the meat merchants very well, specially sent personnel to persuade the meat merchants not to be misled by the contractors and become sacrifices for the contractors' private gain. Most of the meat merchants have understood the background and are operating as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Representatives from All Walks of Life Comfort Xin Haishan Yesterday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Representatives also Petitioned the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Xin Haishan, a clerk at the Mayor's Office, was shot and injured by the French police for no reason on April 7. The police then sent Xin to Renji Hospital for treatment. His injuries were serious. The police then transferred Xin to Guangci Hospital. At 9 a.m. yesterday, representatives from the Shanghai All Circles Assistance Xin Haishan Case Committee, including Zheng Dengqing, Ye Jiaxing, Shao Baoxing, Dong Xinqin, Mao Chunpu, Sun Choucheng, and other six people, went to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road to visit him. Xin was lying in a third-class ward, with dim light and poor air. His face was pale, and the wound on his neck was very severe. He could not speak. The joints of his right arm were broken into debris and he was disabled. When asked, it was said that he had not been treated for four days because the police had not handed over the prescription from Renji Hospital, so it was not convenient to give him medicine. The representatives felt that the police were so negligent in life, which was really inappropriate. After comforting him, they went to the Municipal Government to petition. Secretary Geng received them. The representatives put forward three points, requesting the Municipal Government to handle them: (1) Telephone the French Police Station to inform Guangci Hospital to give serious treatment. (2) Telephone the French Police Station to transfer Xin to a higher-class hospital for treatment. (3) Make serious representations to the French Consul to achieve the goals of punishing the murderers, compensation, apology, and protection. Secretary Geng accepted them one by one and promised to handle them immediately. The representatives felt that the result was satisfactory and left.</p>

<p>Telegram to Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>Zhang Shouyong telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government, "Chairman Zhang and all members of the Hangzhou Provincial Government, Director Wang of the Finance Department, and Director Shi of the Construction Department: The government has promulgated an order to abolish Likin, and you have earnestly implemented it, which is gratifying to the people. However, recently, I have received letters from fellow villagers, stating that the Yinxian County Government has actually set up bureaus in Shanghe and Xiajiang to collect stone tax, and posted signs to strictly investigate smuggling and prevent detours, and it is of a contracted nature. This kind of tax on goods was not seen in the Likin era, but it happened at this time, which is shocking to the public. Shouyong, as a native of Yinxian County and a member of the Ministry of Finance, has to report the situation truthfully. I request that you immediately order the cancellation and punish the Yinxian County Magistrate to comply with the laws and regulations and avoid harassment. I look forward to your reply.

<h3 id="e99">Li Zongkan Escapes from Kidnappers' Den <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Li Escapes from the Car</p>
<p>A Long Stand Off With Kidnappers</p>
<p>Even the Collar Was Torn</p>
<p>The Danger Was Imminent</p>
<p>Li Zongkan, the third nephew of Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, was about to be kidnapped by bandits at the entrance of his residence at 584 Lao Shenfu Road in the French Concession around 9 a.m. yesterday. Fortunately, Li was alert and escaped. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Family Situation. Li Zongkan, courtesy name Shuta, is from Hebei Province, 31 years old, and is the nephew of Li Yuying, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the National Government. He studied in Paris and is the son-in-law of Zhou Jinjue, a famous postage stamp king from Anhui. Li obtained an engineering degree at a young age and returned to China two years ago. He was hired by the Dafang Construction Company at 112 Sichuan Road as an engineer and resided at 584 Lao Shenfu Road along the road in the French Concession. In addition to Li and his wife and a two-week-old boy, there were only three servants and a new chauffeur from Tongzhou, Liang Xiaodi, hired a month ago.</p>
<p>Daily Life. Because of his busy work, Li purchased a sedan car two years ago for transportation, with the concession number 2710. Li gets up at 8 a.m. every day, eats a little, and then goes to work around 9 a.m. He returns to his residence for lunch at noon, returns to the company at 2 p.m., and returns at 6 p.m. This is his usual routine. Only on holidays does he have time to go to his uncle's residence at 393 Fukaissen Road or his father-in-law's house at 141 Seymour Road.</p>
<p>Kidnappers Suddenly Arrive. Yesterday morning, Li got up at 8 a.m., washed and ate, and it was already 9:10 a.m. The chauffeur Liang Xiaodi had already prepared the car to wait. After a while, Li calmly went out and stepped into the car. Just as the chauffeur was about to start the engine, six kidnappers suddenly rushed out from the side of the road. Three bandits were in front and three bandits were in the back. One of the three bandits in front, wearing a dark silk robe, put a pistol against the chauffeur's waist, forbidding him to speak, and forced him to get out of the car. At that time, Li saw the situation and knew that he had encountered bandits, so he pretended to be calm, held the car door copper ring tightly with one hand, pushed it outward forcefully, and jumped out.</p>
<p>Extreme Danger. After Li jumped out of the car, he ran to the alley next door and fled into a French residence at 596 at the end of the alley. Unexpectedly, the bandits in the back dared to chase in with guns, chasing all the way to the courtyard. At that time, the owner of the house was out, the gate was tightly closed, and only a few servants were guarding the house. At that time, Li had nowhere to hide and was caught by the bandits. The two sides struggled for a long time. Li shouted for help. When the neighbors heard the alarm and gathered together, the two bandits released him and fled without a trace. As a result, Li's neck and collar were torn by the bandits. Fortunately, the bandits did not have time to shoot, so he was not seriously injured, but the shock was enough to scare him.</p>
<p>Two Suspects. At the same time, Li's family urgently called the French Police Station. After a while, the detectives arrived and chased in all directions. They chased to the vicinity of the Lujiawan Tram Company and intercepted two suspects with the same clothing as the bandits. They were taken to the police station for questioning. One side was escorted by several detectives and took Li to the residence of Central Committee Member Li Shizeng on Fukaissen Road. The detectives accompanied Li for lunch at Li's residence. At about 3 p.m., they accompanied him to the North Station, and Li took the 3:15 p.m. express train to Beijing for recuperation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Huang Xianzhong Admits to Receiving Over One Million <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Checks Were All Signed on Behalf of His Father</p>
<p>Chen Zhiquan and His Son Released on Bail</p>
<p>Chen Zhiquan, the president of the Shanghai Riyue Bank, and Chen Yuqing, the accounting clerk, were involved in embezzlement. The French court previously interrogated Chen and others, who claimed that Huang Chu Jiu's son, Huang Xianzhong, came to the bank on the day of Huang Chu Jiu's death and transferred over 1.1 million yuan. The checks and documents were also signed by Xianzhong on behalf of his father. They were ordered to summon Huang Xianzhong to court for questioning and verification. Yesterday, they were questioned again. On the creditor side, lawyers Yan Luqing and Xu Yannian attended the court for observation. First, the witness Huang Xianzhong was summoned to the court. After Judge Zhu compared the handwriting on the Riyue Bank's payment documents, they matched. Questioning Huang Xianzhong, he confessed that the Riyue Bank's checks and documents were actually signed by a civilian on behalf of his father. He signed them because after his father's death, someone came and ordered him to complete the unfinished procedures of his father's lifetime. The official said to Huang Xianzhong, "We did not summon you to court for questioning in the beginning. Before, we only relied on the one-sided words of the president Chen Zhiquan, which was not credible. Now that we have summoned you to court for questioning, you should bear criminal responsibility and pay a bail of 1.1 million yuan." At this time, Huang's representative, lawyer Tan Yigong, said that Huang Xianzhong had completely handed over his father's property to the accountant and was about to put it up for auction. He is now in a state of being unable to produce property. How can he find such a huge bail? He requested that the court allow him to be released on ordinary bail and summoned at any time. Accountant Pan Zhaobang claimed that he had found that the Riyue Bank had another expenditure of 805,000 yuan, which was handled by Chen Zaifeng and Wang Ziyuan of the Wanchun Silver Group. He requested that they be summoned to court for questioning. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi, the representative of President Chen Zhiquan and his son, said that his clients, Chen Zhiquan and his son, had been detained for a long time. It has been proven that the checks and documents were signed by Huang Xianzhong, and someone is responsible. He requested that Chen and his son be released. Judge Zhu said that Chen Zhiquan, Chen Yuqing, and Huang Xianzhong should each pay bail for release and must be summoned at any time. If they avoid being summoned, the bail will be confiscated. An arrest warrant was issued, and the case was adjourned for seven days, allowing witnesses to be summoned for questioning.</p>

<p>Spring Fish Boats Also Arrive One After Another</p>
<p>Dried Fish Imports. The first batch of Beiyang dried fish arrived in Wusong yesterday morning. The ship was named Zhou Fushun and carried more than 3,000 fish. After berthing for inspection, it was unloaded and sold by the Cui Sheng Fish Shop. Each dan (100 catties) was sold for 24 yuan. However, the goods that arrived yesterday were not many, so they could only be sold in this town. Wholesale customers from other places had to wait for a large batch to arrive.</p>
<p>Spring Fish Continues to Arrive. Because of the good weather yesterday, dozens of spring fish boats, including Fu Lizeng, Gu Fashun, Jin Tongmao, Yong Xing Shun, Jin Yuan Tai, Jin He Shun, Wang Fu Shun, Jin He Yuan, and others, arrived one after another and berthed in Yunzaobang, creating a spectacular sight of sails standing tall. The selling price was still the same as the previous day, and fishmongers from inland areas were very crowded to buy. They were all sold by Bao Feng, Cui Sheng, and Shen Tai Fish Shops.</p>
<p>Authorities Protect. The Wusong fishing season is a major business of the year, and the market is very lively. It is inevitable that petty thieves will mix in, so the land and water authorities are paying special attention to protection during this fishing season. For example, the Wusongkou is patrolled by the Water Police Fourth District, and the area around Yunzaobang on the Huangpu River is protected by Li Huchen, the captain of the anti-smuggling brigade, and Ding Xiaoping, the captain of the water patrol team. The outer road is maintained by the additional posts of the Public Security Seventh District.</p>
<p>Pirates Extort Donations. When the fishing boats go to sea, there are still pirates extorting donations for flags, with prices ranging from 50 yuan to 100 yuan per boat. After paying the donation, the bandits give a flag, which allows them to travel on the sea. Otherwise, they will be captured or their boats burned. After the Water Police Fourth District launched a large-scale crackdown, they have slightly restrained themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Thieves Steal from the Aquatic Products School <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Wusong Aquatic Products School Has Been Stolen from Three Times in a Row</p>
<p>They Tried to Steal Again Last Morning and Were Arrested by the Police</p>
<p>The Wusong Paotaiwan Aquatic Products School has had thefts on the 3rd of last month and the 1st of this month. The cases were reported to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau for investigation, but they have not been solved. Yesterday (the 9th) at about 1 a.m., the students of the school were all sound asleep. Suddenly, a thief broke a hole in the bamboo fence outside the school, entered, and broke the glass on the windows of the student dormitories, hoping to steal. Fortunately, he was discovered by a watchman, who immediately shouted "Catch the thief!" All the students in the school were awakened by the sound and sounded the alarm. At that time, Chang Jiaxin, the patrol captain of the Seventh District Public Security Bureau, was patrolling nearby with three policemen. Hearing the news, they rushed to the school to arrest the thief. When they arrived, the thief was gone. After the police surveyed the area, they knew that the thief was still hiding in the dark. However, the school grounds were vast, with many ditches and reeds, and it was late at night, making it difficult to find him. Patrol Captain Chang ordered two policemen to secretly monitor outside the school, while he took another policeman to patrol around. He also instructed the students in the school to be extra careful. At about 3 a.m., the thief thought that no one was guarding him, so he crawled out of the broken fence, hoping to escape. He was unexpectedly stopped and captured by the police. They found a wallet, three pawn tickets, three seals, a diary, three photos, two bunches of keys, and 64 yuan in cash on him. He was immediately escorted to the Seventh District. After Zhao Zezhou, the district chief, interrogated him, he confessed that his name was Wang Zhanqian, 26 years old, from Yuncheng, Shandong. He had previously been sentenced to seven months in prison by the court for theft and had just been released from prison at the beginning of last month. Because he had no food or shelter, he went to the school to steal. Including this time, it was his third time. The first time, he stole a large number of clothes, which he pawned at the Garbage Bridge. Other sundries were sold. The second time, he stole a typewriter, which he pawned for 33 yuan on Changbang Road in the French Concession, and a clock, which he sold for 80 cents. The remaining seals and other items were kept on his person. When asked how many people were involved in the theft, he confessed that he was the only one. The stolen goods were taken out of the school and placed in an empty thatched house on Paotaiwan, and transported to Shanghai in two batches. Today was the third time, but he was caught before he could start. All the black wool coat, yellow pants, and gray jacket he was wearing were stolen the first time. After verifying the confession, District Chief Zhao immediately prepared a document at 9 a.m. yesterday and sent the police to escort him to the Public Security Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Wang Menglan Sues for Divorce, Sobbing in Court <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Judge Sincerely Tries to Reconcile Them</p>
<p>Menglan Remains Unwilling</p>
<p>Feng Yeru was, in the past, married to Wang Menglan by her parents' arrangement. Wang, because she was illiterate, specifically provided funds for her education. The couple lived together for over ten years, enjoying harmonious marital life. Recently, disagreements arose, and their relationship deteriorated. Feng believed it was difficult to stay married until old age, so she left the Wang family, resided at the Young Women's Christian Association, and hired a lawyer to sue Wang in the Special District Local Court for abuse, claiming it was unbearable to live together, and requested permission to divorce Wang Menglan. However, since being sued, Wang also defended himself to the court, opposing the divorce and demanding that Feng Yeru return to live with him. Each held their own views, and the court had held several hearings. The judge hoped that both parties would set aside minor grievances and reconcile. Therefore, he did not rush to a judgment and instructed them to try to reconcile outside of court. However, Feng's unwillingness to rekindle their former affection was exceptionally firm, making reconciliation impossible. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong continued the hearing. He first questioned Wang Menglan about the reconciliation situation. Wang stated that his only goal was for the plaintiff to continue living with him, with no other intention, but he was disappointed that he could not gain her understanding. Judge Xu then questioned Feng, who said that she really could not bear the abuse and vowed never to live with him again, not only unwilling to be a member of the Wang family in life but also unwilling to be a Wang family ghost in death. As she spoke, she seemed extremely heartbroken, tears streaming down her face, and then began to sob quietly, unable to speak. The judge immediately spoke to her gently, saying that Wang Menglan had not treated her poorly, making her study because she was illiterate, and she should not forget their past love over minor grievances. She should especially not lightly mention divorce due to unfavorable circumstances, especially since she still lacked the ability to support herself and would have difficulty maintaining her life living alone outside. The judge offered this advice in good faith, saying that marital harmony, where the defendant treated her well in the future, would be better than separation and living apart. However, she did not understand this reasoning, shaking her head repeatedly. Her younger brother, Feng Mengqi, was also in the courtroom listening. The judge then ordered him to persuade her gently. The siblings spoke for a long time, but to no avail. Therefore, after arguments between the two parties' lawyers, the judge ordered them to leave and await a scheduled judgment. The outcome depends on these final five minutes.</p>

<p>Personnel Will Be Sent to Work on Wednesdays and Saturdays</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities manages advertisements within the city. It has already established advertising management offices in Shanghai South, Shanghai North, and Pudong.

It is now known that the bureau has decided to temporarily establish the Shanghai West Advertising Management Office within the Sixth District General Office of the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau starting on May 16th. Afterwards, personnel will be sent by the bureau to work every Wednesday and Saturday. Those who post advertisements in this area can register and pay taxes at the management office nearby.

<p>The housing dispute in Qingyun Lane, Hongkou, involving the landlord and tenants in court, has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the landlord, Sassoon &amp; Co., hired many workers to bring bamboo and wood materials, preparing to build fences. After hearing the news, the residents were immediately alarmed and inquired about the truth. The organizers of the Qingyun Lane Tenants' Association went around advising the tenants, who then dispersed. Meanwhile, representatives Tang Huilian and Jiang Xianhe went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the concession for assistance. The Hongkou police also dispatched detectives to the scene at the time to maintain order.</p>

<p>Violators Will Be Heavily Fined and Their Pharmacies Closed</p>
<p>The sleeping pills sold in various pharmacies in the city mostly contain highly narcotic ingredients that can cause death. As a result, many frustrated young people use these drugs to commit suicide. If they are not strictly prohibited, the harm to society will be significant. The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday received a notice from the Ministry of the Interior, stating that it approved the Ministry of Health's request to ban pharmacies from selling sleeping pills, which is in full compliance with Articles 6, 7, 14, and 15 of the Regulations on the Management of Pharmacists. A strict ban should be enforced to protect the people's peace and tranquility. Violators will be heavily fined, and the pharmacy may be closed as a punishment. After receiving the notice, the Municipal Government immediately forwarded it to the Social Affairs Bureau for strict compliance.</p>

<p>Guilds Request a Delay in Enforcement</p>
<p>Various tobacco retailers and sauce, wine, and grocery stores in the Chinese area of the city have failed to affix revenue stamps on their tobacco and alcohol licenses and have been investigated and fined by the bureau. The merchants have sent letters to the two industry guilds for assistance, requesting the tax bureau to handle the matter leniently. The Tobacco Retailers' Guild, led by Chairman Chen Liangyu and the directors of the North and South offices, Qian Wenda and Wang Chengdong, went to the Revenue Stamp Bureau yesterday to personally explain the circumstances of the inadvertent omission and requested preferential treatment. They were granted permission for further review. The guild has already sent a special letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and various district offices, stating: "Regarding the recent inspection of revenue stamps by the Revenue Stamp Bureau, the majority of our members mistakenly believed that the tobacco and alcohol licenses were issued by the tax authorities and had official stamps, so they failed to affix revenue stamps. This is a common occurrence. According to the tax regulations, penalties should be imposed. However, these are small businesses with meager profits, and the heavy fines will cause unbearable hardship. Our guild has sent a letter to the Revenue Stamp Bureau requesting preferential treatment and lenient handling, which has been acknowledged and is under further review. We respectfully request that your bureau consider the merchants' difficulties and instruct the various district offices under your jurisdiction to temporarily suspend enforcement. We hereby send this letter for your attention."</p>

<p>Shanghai Trust Company, located at 801 North Sichuan Road, has received enthusiastic public support since it pioneered the method of selling public land in sections. The previous sale of twenty-seven mu of public land next to Hongkou Park, divided into sections, was sold out within days of the announcement. However, inquiries from various sectors continued to pour in. Recognizing the need to meet public demand and to repay the public's appreciation, the company spared no expense in purchasing over eight mu of vacant land adjacent to the previous public land next to Hongkou Park, dividing it into small sections of one fen or several li each for low-priced sale. Each section is worth just over one thousand taels. Except for two sections adjacent to Hongkou Park, which are most suitable for building Western-style houses, the rest are most suitable for Chinese and Western-style residences, which is truly good news for people from all walks of life who want to buy a house.</p>

<p>Zhang Baohong Was Truly Pitiable</p>
<p>At approximately 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, streetcar number 334, driven by Hu Yuqing, was traveling from east to west on Broadway Road. At that time, Zhang Baohong, a 16-year-old from Jiangbei, was in a hurry to cross the road from north to south. However, behind the streetcar, car number 10476, driven by Yuan Wensi, came speeding along and violently knocked Zhang to the ground, causing serious injuries. A Japanese man in the car helped Zhang into the car and sent him to Tongren Hospital. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after. The hospital reported to the Huishan Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Fielun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court was notified and appointed prosecutor Guo Wei to come to the morgue for an examination. Guo took his seat in the public position. Zhang Baochang, the deceased's brother, complained that his younger brother had only been in Shanghai for two weeks from his original home in Jiangbei. He was playing on Broadway Road that day and was hit and killed by a car. He requested compensation. Guo verified the complaint and ruled that the deceased Zhang Baohong had been hit and killed by car number 10476. The body was handed over to his brother Zhang Baochang to arrange for the coffin and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Floral Technician Commits Suicide by Poisoning <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Xingkang, a 32-year-old from Cixi, Ningbo, worked as a floral technician in the Western-style underwear workshop at 9 Hehe Lane, Xiafei Road, French Concession. He was paid by piece, earning an average of sixty to seventy yuan per month. However, Cheng had a large debt. Recently, he was urgently pressed by creditors, which led him to a short-sighted act. He ingested poison before going to bed the night before last. It was not until 7:00 AM yesterday that a fellow worker discovered him already dead. The workshop owner, Xu Chengqing, reported to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. They immediately took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue. Xu sent a telegram to Ningbo to notify the deceased's wife to come to Shanghai to take care of matters. Yesterday morning, the criminal section of the French Police Station reported to Judge Zhu Cheng of the French Court, who confirmed that the deceased had indeed committed suicide by poisoning before his death. He took his seat in the public position, questioned Xu about the deceased's life, and then authorized the deceased's family to collect the body themselves. As the deceased's family could not come to Shanghai in time, Tongren Fuyuan Hall was instructed to collect the body on their behalf to ensure hygiene.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Woman Carries a Gun to Assist Robbers <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Detected and Captured by Detectives</p>
<p>Recently, robbers have found it inconvenient to carry guns due to the strict inspections by police officers along the way. However, they are unwilling to abandon weapons and commit robberies empty-handed. As a result, they are recruiting female accomplices to carry guns, as women are less likely to be searched by detectives due to politeness. However, this trick cannot last long. Similar cases have been cracked one after another recently. The men, however, remain ignorant and persist in treating it as a golden rule. At dusk the day before yesterday, two robbers, Tian Changfa and Chen A'er, intended to rob near the Great World. They followed the example of those before them by handing two handguns and eight bullets to their accomplice, Dong Shenshi. As they were about to set off from a certain place, Chief Detective Bai Zhongqi of the Huishi Police Station learned of the plan. He, along with Western Detective Zhaxu, led detectives to wait in ambush in front of the Great World on Edward Road. After some time, Tian and the others arrived leisurely. Upon a tip-off from an informant, they were intercepted together. The guns and ammunition were found in the woman's pockets. They were taken back to the police station, and each was detained. They were sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday. Because the details of their crimes had not yet been determined, Judge Wu only asked a few questions and ordered them to be remanded in custody pending further investigation.</p>

<p>At 7:00 AM yesterday morning, Chinese Constable No. 85 of the Water Patrol recovered the body of an infant, two or three months old, from the Huangpu River near the mouth of the Suzhou Creek. It was a male, with only the body, and no head. Some say that ignorant people have a superstitious belief that repeated births of children who die young are caused by reincarnated debtors. If the child's head is cut off after death and the body is thrown into a field or water, the child will not dare to reincarnate again. The child's body is probably one of such cases. It was taken away by the Life Saving Bureau for burial.</p>

<p>Committed by the Same Gang</p>
<p>Two People Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>At about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, a passerby near Huanlong Road in the French Concession was robbed by four robbers, losing over seventy silver dollars and a long gown. Not long after, another passerby was robbed on Beile Road, losing about thirty or forty dollars. Unexpectedly, the two cases were committed by the same gang. After the robbers had enough, they went east along Edward Road. Patrolman Liu Jinrong No. 92 of the French Police Station happened to see them and thought they were suspicious. He immediately followed them secretly and reported to two Chinese constables of the Public Concession Police to intercept and arrest two people. After strict interrogation at the police station, the two confessed to robbing people on Huanlong Road and Beile Road. The police chief ordered them to be detained and sent to the court for prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Old Baidu Fire <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Runtai Rag Shop, No. 40, Old Baidu Street, Nanshi, was a double-wide shop. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of the shop. The fire was very fierce and quickly broke through the roof. Fire brigades from various districts drove to the scene and extinguished the fire. The fire was extinguished after about an hour. In this fire, in addition to the two-story building of Runtai being burned, it also spread to the one-story building of the neighboring Dai Baoxing Incense Shop, the two-story building of Qingyuan Wool Shop, the two-story building of Hexingchang Western Iron Shop, and the one-story building of Hetaixing Gunny Sack Shop on the right. When the fire was raging, Patrolman Wang Can of the First District Police Station arrived after hearing the news and took Runtai's owner Wang Xiaocai and shop assistant Kong Linzhang from Taian to the district for preliminary interrogation. Wang Xiaocai confessed that he was 52 years old and from Ningbo, and that the fire was caused by the shop assistant carelessly throwing a lit cigarette butt into a pile of rags, causing the disaster. As the case involved a fire and the cause of the fire was highly suspicious, he was instructed to prepare a document and submit it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is said that Qingyuan Wool Shop had fire insurance, and Runtai also had fire insurance of 5,000 taels with a certain company. The rags stored on the first floor were not completely destroyed, only soaked in water. The loss of items burned on the second floor was not large.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Various Labor Unions' Expectations for Yang Youren <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The various labor unions in Shanghai have expressed their opinions on this year's International Labour Conference's labor representative, which are recorded below: Yang Youren, the labor representative to the 15th International Labour Conference, has already left for Europe. Our associations have worked hard for many years to promote the labor movement and have high hopes for the International Labour Conference, which aims to improve the conditions of workers in various countries. Since the opening of the conference more than a decade ago, the government has appointed ministers or special envoys stationed in the country to represent it at each session. They have merely gone through the motions without fulfilling the expectations of the labor community and diminishing China's international standing. It is truly disheartening. In addition to the employer representative, the central government has appointed Yang as the labor representative for this year's conference. This is the first time that China's labor representative has attended the conference. This fulfills the requirements of the League of Nations charter, and the appointment is more prudent than making an unauthorized one. Furthermore, the mission of this year's conference is particularly important, including reporting on the implementation and ratification of conventions and electing the council, in addition to focusing on improving labor conditions. Moreover, as China is currently making efforts to negotiate legal rights, the Chinese representative has a major responsibility to stop foreign factories in China from failing to comply with Chinese labor laws. Therefore, the significance of this year's conference for improving China's international standing, advancing the Chinese revolution, and improving the welfare of Chinese workers is profound and unprecedented. With such a heavy responsibility, a labor representative must have experience in the labor movement, excellent knowledge, a sensitive mind, be fluent in foreign languages, have a history with the party and the nation, and be trusted by workers throughout the country. Otherwise, they will not be qualified to serve as a labor representative and will not be able to fulfill the mission of a labor representative. Moreover, the labor representative's first attendance at the conference makes them a model Chinese worker in the eyes of foreigners. Therefore, the importance of the appointment cannot be overstated by our associations. This time, the newspapers suddenly announced that Yang had been appointed by the central government as a representative. Whether his qualifications are suitable is still a question. However, Yang did not refuse the hardship and ignored everything. He resolutely went abroad to Europe under the central government's appointment to participate in the World Labour Conference of 55 countries. His motives are unknown, but his courage is commendable. We believe that he will follow the instructions of the central government, live up to the central government's appointment, and not repeat the mistakes of previous representatives and shame China internationally. Our associations' expectations of Yang are no different from those of the central government, so we will not repeat them. We offer our humble opinions as encouragement to Yang and hope that our fellow compatriots will take note.

<p>Hoping for Two Things</p>
<p>Shanghai Labor Circles sent a telegram of congratulations to Liu Chunyi, Chairman of the National Assembly and representative of the labor circles in Shaanxi: "To Comrade Liu Chunyi, Chairman of the Nanjing National Assembly, upon reading the news of your election as chairman, all of our fellow workers are overjoyed. With deep love, we also express our earnest expectations. We venture to offer our humble suggestions for your consideration. Although we know that our shallow views may not assist your profound knowledge, we hope that small contributions may benefit the mountains and seas. We trust that you will take note of our sincere intentions. (1) Our country's industry is backward, and society is impoverished. Therefore, the working class depends on crumbs from imperialists or suffers greatly in hell. Every time we look back, all our tears are dry. Now that our National Assembly has opened, the people's livelihood problem urgently needs to be solved. If the happiness of labor cannot be increased and the regulation of capital lacks long-term planning, not only will the livelihood of the masses be ruined, but also our homeless fellow proletarians will not know where to beg. This great task of relieving difficulties must depend on the comrades. (2) The workers' organizations are scattered like sand, lacking a central leader and united strength. Therefore, the labor unions exist in name only. Compared to Europe and America, we are far behind. Even more painful is that merchants are concentrated under one banner, while workers have different standards. This is a great contrast, and the divisions are increasing. When foreign insults come, we cannot help but shudder. This great task of changing the situation must also depend on the comrades. Our association members only know how to shed hot blood and fight for survival, resisting economic aggression from above and seeking to stabilize the people's livelihood below. We hope that the comrades and representatives will work hard for the labor community, and we are willing to lead more than 800,000 fellow laborers to act as a rearguard. We are sending this telegram of congratulations and hope for your instructions. We also hope that you will forward it to all the labor representatives and make efforts together. We cannot express our hopes enough.

<h3 id="e120">Silk Cocoon General Association Petitions the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Protect Cocoon Merchants <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Huang Jinming, chairman of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Association, submitted a document to Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ye yesterday regarding the protection of the cocoon market, stating, "Regarding the protection of cocoons, advance preparations should be made in accordance with the regulations and methods of past years. We respectfully request your review and instructions to the military, political, and civil officials of each cocoon region to strictly protect the market in order to ensure the safety of farmers and merchants. It has been found that the cocoon market in Jiangsu typically opens after the Little Fullness solar term. Each year, the General Association drafts protection measures and submits them to the National Government, which distributes them to various provinces and regions for implementation, and prints them into protection guidelines, which are submitted to your office for forwarding to the military, political, and civil agencies in each jurisdiction for reference and implementation. This has allowed for thorough protection and has been deeply appreciated. The cocoon market is approaching this year, and the social situation is relatively stable. However, there is a sense of caution in areas with multiple waterways far from the county seat. Most of the cocoon-producing areas in Jiangsu Province rely on waterway transportation. At that time, the flow of silver and goods requires reliable troops to provide protection at all times to prevent accidents. It is the duty of the General Association to list all the items that need to be protected, such as the transportation of cash and the delivery of cocoon packages, with dates, based on past practices. We respectfully request your office to preside over the matter and order the cocoon-producing areas to instruct the troops stationed there and the Public Security Bureaus of the various prefectures to protect the market in accordance with the regulations. In addition to submitting this to the National Government and printing 100 copies of the regulations for your office to forward to the various cocoon-producing counties and military and police officials in charge of protection for reference and implementation, the reasons for the advance request for protection of the cocoon market are hereby attached for your consideration and implementation. We also request your instructions for compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Inland River Steamer Operation Permits <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Response from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction</p>
<p>Notice from the Trade Association</p>
<p>Following the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction's implementation of issuing inland river steamer operation permits, the local Inland River Steamer Trade Association, due to difficulties in complying with the ten application procedures, listed four items and telegraphed for amendments or flexibility: (1) The route filled in on the Ministry of Transportation's permit is comparatively longer. Now, the application form for the operation permit requires filling in the actual route traveled, which may not match the Ministry's permit. Flexibility is requested. (2) Request to waive the submission of a business license copy. (3) For leased steamers, the shipowner's name on the Ministry's permit will inevitably differ from the Shipping Bureau's name. Flexibility is also requested. (4) Request to waive the need for a temporary operation permit. Now, the response from the Department of Construction provides instructions for each item as follows: (1) The fifth section of the application form for the operation permit should state the starting and ending points of the current route and the locations passed, consistent with the details listed on the Ministry's permit. However, the locations passed on the application form must be filled in based on the actual locations navigated. If there are mid-way branch lines and the route is a detour, the locations within the branch lines should be added to the list of locations passed. (2) If there is currently no business license, it is permitted to submit it after obtaining the operation permit. (3) According to the Ministry's regulations, once a steamer is leased, the original license should be cancelled, and the lessee should fill in "leased" and apply for a new license. There is no reason for the Shipping Bureau's name to differ on the Ministry's permit due to the leased ship. The requested flexibility cannot be granted. (4) If an emergency or disaster occurs, assistance from other steamers will not be restricted, but only for rescue purposes. If, at the starting or ending point, another steamer is used as a replacement under the pretext of the original steamer's machinery damage, it will be considered a replacement service, and operation is not allowed without a temporary operation permit. After receiving the response, the association immediately printed the four instructions and notified all affiliated shipping bureaus, requesting them to comply with the ten procedures for applying for an operation permit previously issued by the Department of Construction, and to complete the various forms according to regulations, referencing the four instructions, and submit them to the local county construction bureau to apply for the operation permit, in compliance with the law.</p>

<p>Social Bureau Schedules Mediation for the 12th</p>
<p>39,000 female workers, 3,600 male workers, and 18,000 child laborers in silk factories in the fourth and sixth districts of the city have been subject to a temporary wage reduction last year, which is rare in all industries. Initially, it was based on labor-management mutual assistance and understanding, upholding the spirit of cooperation to develop the industry, and reluctantly sacrificing by calculating wages at 85%. Since the reduction, gold prices have soared, and commodity prices have risen accordingly, making life increasingly difficult for workers. Therefore, the wages earned through hard work and sweat cannot provide for the family, and they cannot even eat their fill, inevitably leading to death. They have no choice but to request that the employers restore the original wages from May 1st. The labor union has sent a letter to the trade association, and the trade association has already held a meeting a few days ago and resolved to issue 57 cents according to the Wuxi method, raising the wages for four workers to three. The union was first notified that the current situation will remain unchanged for the month, and a date will be set for implementation from June 1st. In order to resolve the issue quickly, the Municipal Social Bureau has scheduled a meeting with the Silk Factory Trade Association and the Silk Reeling Unions of the fourth and sixth districts on the morning of the 12th at 9 a.m. to conduct mediation.</p>

They immediately went on strike yesterday at 8 a.m. Upon seeing this, the factory immediately reported to the Municipal Social Bureau and requested mediation. It is reported that the bureau has already sent Gu Bingyuan to mediate.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Native Cloth Traders Request Tax Exemption <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Request Wang Yansong to Propose to the National Assembly</p>
<p>The Native Cloth Traders Association sent a letter to Wang Yansong, the city's representative to the National Assembly, yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you concerning the export of hand-woven native cloth by our industry. Due to customs disputes over tariffs, our association previously sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Unified Tax Bureau, providing evidence of tax-exempt history and examining the Bandit Suppression Unified Tax Regulations, which stipulate 'one tax per item.' We detailed the reasons why we should be exempted from taxation and petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Customs Administration. On April 16th, our association, together with the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Traders Association, sent representatives to meet with Director Xie of the Unified Tax Bureau. We were informed that the Bureau had consulted with the Customs Administration to instruct the General Customs Office to order the Customs to exempt exports. More than 20 days have passed, and the native cloth traders have suffered significant losses due to prolonged suspension of transportation. Furthermore, goods cannot be unloaded, and goods sent are held at customs declaration agents. Various considerations make us deeply concerned about the dangers of fire and water. Therefore, we are writing again to request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request the Ministry of Finance and the Customs Administration to quickly resolve the issue. Our association also sent a telegram on the 28th, but we have not yet seen the approval order arrive in Shanghai, and the Customs has not yet announced it. Merchants are as if they are in a five-mile fog, and the losses to our industry are unprecedented in a century. The members of our association are in positions of responsibility and must accept this, but we also request that the National Government uphold its emphasis on people's livelihood, the resolution to promote domestic goods, and the 'one tax per item' system. We request that you maintain your credibility. We are enclosing a copy of Yu's telegram, requesting your representation to ask the Ministry of Finance and the Customs Administration to order the Customs to announce the order immediately, to uphold the late Premier's attention to people's livelihood, and to comfort the hundreds of thousands of merchants who are longing for rain in a drought. Furthermore, today's newspaper reports the announcement of the public export tariff regulations, with 270 items divided into six categories. Native cloth is in the category exempted from customs duties. At this critical juncture, we urge you to strive to achieve our goal and restore our industry's livelihood. We would be extremely grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e142">On Children's Literature Revisited <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>(In Response to Mr. Wu Yanyin) Shang Zhongyi (I)</p>
<p>During the annual meeting of the Chinese Children's Education Society in Shanghai, Zhongyi proposed a discussion of children's literature. Due to limited time, it was not possible to express all that I wanted to say. I am now writing specifically about "fairy tales" (including stories of gods and immortals and other fantasy stories) to share my thoughts and seek correction from colleagues.</p>
<p>When children are developing and learning to understand the real environment and observe natural phenomena, adults responsible for guiding them should not, unless there is a sufficient reason, give them a concept that conflicts with natural phenomena. There are no such things as gods and monsters in the world, and birds and animals cannot speak human languages. Therefore, unless there is sufficient reason, children's literature should not contain materials that contradict natural laws and principles. "Whether there is sufficient reason" is the key to the whole situation, which is the standard for choosing fairy tales. Let's try to carefully evaluate the value of fairy tales and see if there is a reason to maintain their position in children's literature. If there is a reason, let's see if it is sufficient.</p>
<p>"Evaluation of the Value of Fairy Tales"</p>
<p>(1) Inspiring Imagination: Because fairy tales have been circulating for a long time, most people follow the old path and never talk about their value. Even if they occasionally discuss it, they are blocked by the words "inspiring imagination." Therefore, to this day, fairy tales can still maintain their important position in children's literature, occupying most of children's reading time. We cannot prove that "inspiring imagination" is definitely not possible, but we are afraid it is difficult to determine that it is possible. Between possible or impossible, we still have three doubts:</p>
<p>(1) Is the organized, creative imagination in science and art (Creative Imagination) the same as bizarre, whimsical reverie (Reverie)? (2) If they are not the same, which type is likely to be elicited by stories of gods and fairies? (3) If they are the same, if fantasy is the creative imagination that produces, why is the legendary skill of Changsang from two thousand years ago not realized in China but realized in Germany with X-rays?</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, although we cannot say that fairy tales absolutely cannot inspire imagination, we are convinced that the ability of science stories and natural reading materials to inspire imagination is definitely no less than that of fairy tales. The heaven-defying and earth-shrinking magic methods in science stories, even if Nezha were to appear and Andersen's puppets were born, would have to concede defeat. The various amazing methods of adapting to the environment in the biological world of natural reading materials would probably make Sun Wukong, who can only perform seventy-two transformations, smile wryly.</p>

<p>Mullins Wins Championship</p>
<p>—Dong Zhaobin Takes First Place in the Youth Division—</p>
<p>—The Youth Team is Composed of Baihong Team Members—Yesterday They Rested to Prepare for Today's Match Against Jiangnan—The Shanghai Five Giants, Youth, West, Aviation, Mullins, and American Public, held a joint sports meet at the American Public School sports field on Avenue Petain yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, which concluded at 6:00 PM. Mullins won the team championship with 54.5 points, and Dong Zhaobin of the Youth team won the individual championship with 16 points.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Youth Team's Failure</p>
<p>The Five Giants League has an international character, which has attracted countless enthusiastic Chinese and Western spectators. The Chinese spectators cheered for the Youth team. However, when the declaration of war was issued, only Dong Zhaobin and Zong Zean from the Youth team appeared in uniform, while the rest were missing. Spectators said that most of the Youth team members are from the Baihong team, and they will participate in today's match against Jiangnan. For the sake of cultivating strength, they put the important international competition behind them, which caused great displeasure and discussion. Ni Xiaoben, an official of the Youth team, forgot his personal interests and bravely volunteered to put on his uniform, showing the spirit of four years ago, and also won a point in the hurdles, adding some glory. The three members of the Youth team seemed to be fighting for survival among millions of soldiers, working hard and relentlessly, trying to defeat the majority with a few, and almost snatched the runner-up spot from the American Public team. Dong Zhaobin participated in four events, winning first place in two and second place in two, totaling 16 points, taking the lead in the individual overall standings. Zong Zean also scored three points. If the entire team had participated, the champion of the Five Giants would undoubtedly belong to the Youth team. It is a pity that because of today's game, the brave warriors and generals had the suspicion of avoiding the important and taking the easy, abandoning the former for the latter.</p>

<h3 id="e162">A Record of Boxer Jiang Dafu <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of Sichuan are magnificent and nurture talent. Thus, men of letters often lead the world. And martial arts are especially skilled in the world. My friend Zhu Qiufang, a native of Chengdu, said that there is a person named Jiang Dafu in his hometown, a famous boxer. I have seen his performance skills. He piled a hundred bricks on the ground and slapped them with his hand. If people asked him to break a certain number of bricks, he would break that number of bricks. Or if he was told to break a certain brick, he would break that brick without fail. If he wanted to break them all, he would press down once from top to bottom, and they would all be like powder. He also stood on the ground, with a rope tied to each of his left and right feet. Dozens of people pulled in different directions, but they could not move him even a bit. He also let people hit him with a stick, like hitting a broken quilt. If he was cut with a blade, his whole body would be like stone, and the blade would be completely curled. Dafu already had a great reputation. One day, a guest came to visit and asked to compare skills. When they met, they bowed to each other. The guest's bow was accompanied by a gust of wind, because the guest secretly injured him with five hundred pounds of force. Dafu knew his intention and also responded with five hundred pounds of force. The guest then knew that he could not be insulted. After sitting down, he used his power to break the chair. Dafu saw that the chair was broken and immediately got up and apologized, saying that the chair was not suitable for sitting on, and that he was guilty of slighting the guest. He then lifted the stone drum in front of the steps to replace it. The guest looked at the place where the stone drum was pinched by his hand, as if it had been chiseled. He looked back at Jiang's chair, which had been half-submerged in the ground but was intact. Then they went out together to the field. Beside the field was an ancient pagoda with seven stories, covered with withered vines. The wind chimes rang from time to time. The guest took off his clothes and looked around, saying, "I should first put this thing in place." He then hung his clothes on the fifth floor of the pagoda, fluttering like a swallow between the upper and lower floors. Dafu said, "Hanging it here is good, but I'm afraid that the strong wind will blow it down and stain it. Please let me change it for you." He then moved the clothes to the top of the pagoda. His movements were as fast as lightning, and there was no sound. The guest judged himself to be no match and repeatedly expressed his admiration. In the end, he did not compete and left. Dafu traveled back and forth in Sichuan and often rescued him from thieves. The thieves hated him very much and waited for him every day. One night, Dafu went out, and the thieves followed him. Dafu did not realize it at first. When the thieves caught up with him, they raised their iron rods and hit him hard, thinking that Dafu would be injured and fall. However, when the rod was about to fall, Dafu immediately raised two fingers to catch it and held the rod so that it could not move. Dafu then ran. The thieves' strike was indeed fierce, but since the rod could not fall, their bodies were suspended three feet off the ground. Dafu ran, and the thieves were very frightened and begged him repeatedly. Dafu said, "You rats dare to plot against me! If I were to throw you forward, you would be dead. Now, I will lend you your mouth to spread the word, and don't provoke my anger again." He then released them and left. Qiufang also said that Dafu's encounter with his teacher was especially strange. Dafu was poor as a child and not very intelligent by nature. He was a cowherd. When he led the cow and the cow refused to go, he would kneel down and bow to it. When asked what he meant, he would say, "When the mistress gets angry, the master always does this." Therefore, his companions often insulted him. One day, he drove the cow out and went a little further, entering a neighboring village. There was a small temple in the village, which was very dilapidated. When he was about to return home, the cow suddenly became stubborn and would not accept the whip. Dafu bowed firmly, but the cow still would not go. The temple door opened, and a monk came out and asked what was wrong. Dafu said, "The cow is very angry, and I am begging it." The monk said, "This is a cow, why do you need to do this?" He took the cow's rope with one hand, as if leading a dog. The cow dared not fall behind. When they were about to reach Dafu's home, the monk said goodbye. The next day, Dafu went to the same place again. The cow again refused to go. Just as he was at a loss, the monk came out again. Dafu pleaded with him. The monk said, "I am not a cowherd, how can I drive the cow for you every day? If you are here, you will meet me, but what about elsewhere?" Dafu thought for a long time and then said, "Then please teach me your skills, monk." The monk said, "Your nature is pure and simple, which is good. But you must persevere to achieve success." Thereupon, Dafu followed the monk to learn martial arts every day. After ten years of training, he became invincible in Sichuan. The monk's name was Foyin.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Interesting Prison Life <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>A returning traveler from the north said that in the Third Prison of Tianjin, there are many political prisoners. Confined behind iron bars, they have nothing to do. Recently, with the permission of the prison guards, they agreed to play basketball. The value of a ball is several gold, which they cannot afford. So they begged for a cow's bladder, inflated it, and wrapped it layer upon layer with rubber paper to make it strong. Although its elasticity is not as good as a leather one, it is still quite satisfactory for throwing back and forth. The construction of basketball hoops would cost even more, so they couldn't prepare them. They came up with a whimsical idea and ordered two people to stand on chairs facing each other and join hands to form a ring, which also looked like a basket. Since the establishment of this basketball team, they have been happily throwing the ball around in the prison yard every day, saying that it is both a way to make the best of their suffering and to practice exercise. Those who see it can't help but laugh. The traveler also said that on New Year's Day this year, they even held a celebration party in prison. In addition to the usual speeches, there were also performances. Chinese martial arts, crosstalk, new dramas, and Peking opera were all available. All costumes and props were made of paper, or modified from ordinary clothes. In the "Empty City Stratagem" play, Marquis Wu made a Bagua robe out of a large shirt glued with paper, banana leaves for feather fans, and paper for a Lun scarf. He leaned leisurely against the city tower made from a modified bed sheet and sang loudly. His singing and acting were excellent, making him the most outstanding act of the entire variety show and earning him frequent applause. Other performances were also very watchable. The stage on that day was not built at first, but was made by drawing lines on the ground with white powder. The audience stood outside the lines. Some were relatives and friends of the prisoners, and some were acquaintances of the prison guards. Those without any connections were not allowed to enter. In addition to the variety show, there was also a wall newspaper, which mainly contained texts and pictures. The works were also quite good.</p>

They often divided their trains into groups to compete in order to increase the speed of the trains. However, in recent years, this trend has gradually declined and is rarely seen. On the European continent, however, there are races between trains and cars, which are more interesting and novel than train-versus-train races. However, this kind of competition often leads to danger, and pedestrians on the road are particularly inconvenienced. It is expected that this trend will soon be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>A few months ago, New Zealand had a major race between a car and a train. The race was from Wellington to Auckland. Before and after the race, the railway bureau reported it to the people of the whole country via radio. At one time, many people came from afar to watch. Although the competition time was in the evening and the places passed through were mostly rugged, the car actually arrived at the destination half an hour earlier than the train.</p>

<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>In this publication last month, Mr. Yu recounted the disaster of the Da Ji Wheel. A person named Mr. Yi, carrying $2,400 in cash, boarded a fishing boat owned by a Mr. Wang, and they agreed to split the money equally. Mr. Wang greedily seized all the money and pushed Mr. Yi into the water to drown him. That night, Mr. Yi's son dreamed that Mr. Yi told him about what happened. He immediately went to Hong Kong and waited for the Mr. Wang's fishing boat to enter the port. He reported the case to the authorities, who boarded the boat and found the stolen money. Mr. Wang was brought to justice. Scientists would laugh at this. But in my life, I have personally experienced and heard about dreams that are so strange and incredible, which are undoubtedly true. And consulting the records of thousands of years, are all those storytellers fools? After summarizing them broadly, two causes can be identified: one is caused by sincere feelings, and the other is caused by accumulated resentment. Sincere feelings, such as what is said in "Liaozhai," the soul of the affectionate woman arrives beside the pillow, and the good friend thousands of miles away still recognizes the road in the dream. Accumulated resentment, such as what happened to Mr. Yi. There is an extremely similar case to Mr. Yi's. During the turmoil of Erzhu Zhao in the Northern Wei Dynasty, Prince Chengyang, Wei, sought refuge with Kou Zuren, the magistrate of Luoyang. Because they had old friendship, Zuren said to his sons, "I heard that the reward for capturing Prince Wei is very high. The one who captures him will become a marquis with a thousand households. Wealth and honor have arrived today." Then he beheaded Wei and sent his head. When Wei first sought refuge with Zuren, he brought 100 catties of gold and 50 horses. Zuren was greedy for his wealth, so he did this. Zhao suddenly dreamed that Wei said, "I have 200 catties of gold and 100 horses at Zuren's house. You can take them." At dawn, Zhao surrounded Zuren. Wei took his gold and horses. Zuren secretly told people, hoping to be forgiven. He said that he had indeed obtained 100 catties of gold and 50 horses. Zhao suspected that he was hiding some. Based on Wei's dream, Zhao searched Zuren's rooms. There were 30 catties of gold and 30 horses, all of which were sent to Zhao. It still wasn't enough. Zhao was angry. He seized Zuren, hanged him from a tall tree, dropped a large stone on his feet, and whipped him to death. People at the time considered it retribution. This is described in detail in the "Records of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang." Judging from Mr. Yi's case, can anyone still say that Su Dongpo's ghost stories are all nonsense?</p>
<p>Short News Recently, Mr. Chen Qiufeng, Mr. Huang Huaisheng, and others established the Xinguang Sound Film Company and started filming "After the Rain, the Sky Clears." They sent director Xia Chifeng, along with actors Lin Ruxin, Gu Baolian, and Huang Naishuang, to Japan to record the sound. The total length is 40,000 feet. After Xia Chifeng arrived at the port, he immediately started recording the sound after unpacking his luggage. The sound quality is clear, and the results are very good. It will be released in China soon. (Hongchu)</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>9th: Together with University Professor Venkateswaran K. G., I went to the headquarters of the Indian University. In the evening, the president of the university summoned the professors, about thirty or forty people, for a debate. Mr. Venkateswaran read my manuscript, and the participants raised many questions. I answered them, and they were all very happy. The chairman, Abdhruva, the president, signed his approval. Currently, there are many Marxist study groups in various parts of India, and many of their books are printed. Indians have no resistance to them, so there is no prohibition either. Marxist scholars asked me many questions. I explained that I am a scholar of human nature and society and do not oppose Marx. However, I explained that materialism is not yet sufficient.</p>
<p>10th: The faculty and staff of the Normal School and the Indian School, together with the principals of the two schools, held a joint debate session, with about forty people. I answered them one by one, and they were all very happy. The two principals are very enthusiastic about cultural reform. Naren Misha asked me to take a photo with him and invited me to jointly organize the Asian Education Association. When I return to Varanasi, I will convene a conference to discuss it. On this day, I met Dr. Shri Bhagavan Das, a prominent figure in the Varanasi political faction. He invited me to stay at his home, which has a garden, and introduced me to Gandhi, the leader of India. According to Bhagavan Das, world peace requires promoting matriarchy to abolish war and promoting motherly ways to teach unruly children so that masculinity can be reformed.</p>
<p>11th: I got up at 4:00 AM. Bhagavan Das, who is over sixty years old, also got up. He sent his son to accompany me to the train to Allahabad to visit Gandhi. Before dawn, Bhagavan sent me off very warmly. I boarded the train at 6:00 AM and arrived at 11:00 AM. I read poetry on the train. Seeing the wheat seedlings growing, I couldn't help but feel the song of Wei Zi about wheat growing. It said, "Wheat grows tall and lush, and the millet grows abundantly." I thought of the difficult land of India, where freedom is not easily obtained. It rained on this day. I first heard about the dry and wet seasons in India, thinking that there would be no rain in the dry season. But now I know that this is not the case. It still rains in the dry season, but only once every few weeks. In northern China, it often rains only once every few months in winter. Winter in northern India is roughly the same as in China. I have not yet reached its extreme north, but I already feel quite cold and am wearing a cotton robe. However, there is no frost, and the plants are always green. However, being close to the snowy mountains in the north, its coldness can be imagined.</p>

<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>(3) In the Police Station</p>
<p>So I told Zhang Baoquan the whole story. Finally, I added, "This matter is very clear. The thief was mixed among the Gao family's guests at the time. He used some method to steal the necklace and quietly slipped out. After taking a few steps, he realized your detective was following him. He became nervous and wanted to transfer the stolen goods in order to escape. Unfortunately, your detective fell for his trick and became entangled with me, allowing the thief to escape right under his nose." Zhang Baoquan exclaimed in surprise, "Oh, so that's how it was!" He then turned his head and scolded Qiu Kui, "You useless idiot! How could you do such a thing? You're supposed to be a detective. Even if you don't know Mr. Bao, you should have at least heard of his reputation. How could you still be so stubborn after Mr. Bao explained his name? You're a disgrace!" Qiu Kui lowered his head, not even daring to look up. His humble and fearful state was almost comical. He stammered, "I deserve to die. I misheard. Please forgive me this time, Mr. Bao." He suddenly turned around and repeatedly bowed to me. I felt a bit embarrassed. It's not uncommon for these ignorant people to be arrogant before and obsequious after. If I insisted on retaliating on the spot, it would seem that I lacked magnanimity. So, I mediated, saying, "Mr. Zhang, although his initial rudeness and humiliation towards me were inappropriate for a detective, since it was due to a misunderstanding, I can forgive him. However, this case is clearly very serious. Because he was being unreasonable at the time, he allowed the villain to escape. So, nothing else matters. How should the thief's whereabouts be investigated? Mr. Qiu should be responsible." Zhang Baoquan stamped his foot again and said to Qiu Kui, "Damn it, damn it! You clearly ruined this case. If you want to keep your job, you must take responsibility for tracking down that person." Qiu Kui bent his back like a bow and repeatedly replied, "I recognize this bad guy. I will definitely do it. I will definitely do it." After saying these words, he didn't dare say anything else and bowed deeply again before walking out of the office with his head lowered. I silently thought that arrogance and boastfulness when successful, and flattery and subservience when unsuccessful, are the usual tricks of petty people. It's truly laughable and pathetic.</p>

<p>Gold Price Rises Six Taels and a Half</p>
<p>The trend is upward. Yesterday, the 9th, the gold price rose again. The situation is peaceful, and the initial increase was only two taels. However, transactions were frequent, likely because the silver market suddenly reported a drop, stirring up people's emotions. The market opened with a sharp rise, and buyers were very enthusiastic, quickly pushing through the 740 tael mark. Later, due to increased selling and a slight easing of exchange rates, the listed price did not change, causing a downward trend, falling three or four taels. Nevertheless, industry sentiment was hesitant, with advances and retreats, ultimately settling at slightly above 38 taels. This morning, the general trend seems bearish. Because the market is closed on Saturdays, looking back from the beginning of the week to yesterday, the highest price reached 44 taels and 8 mace, and the lowest price was 31 taels. This six-day range was only 13 taels and 8 mace. Overall, the net increase was six taels and some change.</p>
<p>Sharp Rise at the Open. The June market opened this morning with a jump of more than seven taels, to 739 taels, because the "big bar" was down by 1/16th (due to an expected rise overnight). The silver price also dropped by 1/8th, as did private telegraphs, especially with continuous selling from the United States. Before long, Zhifengyong and others sold, reducing the price by two taels. However, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, and others came to buy, and banks traded June English gold at 375, causing a surge of more than three taels, reaching 40 taels and 5 qian at 9:20 AM. In a flash, China Bank sold June-July English gold at 375 to 4375, and the Dalian Gang and Tianfengyong, Tongchang, etc., also sold, immediately suppressing it by more than two taels. When Xianling announced the price, it was 38 taels and 2 qian, with the posted price remaining the same, at 8 taels and 56 qian. Qianchangxiang, Yuanheng, and others sold. At 9:40 AM, it was 37 taels. Hengxing, Fuyu, and Yongfeng bought. At 10:00 AM, it was 8 taels and 8 qian. Afterward, there were fluctuations of two taels. After 10:30 AM, selling off positions was quite active, making it difficult for prices to hold steady, and they weakened again, falling to 36 taels and a half around 10:50 AM. Before long, Hengxing, Yongfeng, Fuxingyong, and speculators bought, pulling the price up by two taels. At 11:10 AM, it was 38 taels and 3 qian, then reduced by seven or eight qian. At 11:30 AM, Chenfengyong, Yuanmaoyong, and others continued to buy, and because the Guangdong Gang was scrambling for exchange bills, the banks' attitude became firm, calculating English gold settling at 375, with the state suddenly looking good. It has now risen by more than two taels. At 11:45 AM, it was 39 taels and 8 qian, briefly reaching 40 taels. Later, buyers stopped and retail investors sold, pushing it down by one and a half taels. At noon, it was 38 taels and 3 qian, then increased to 9 qian. Until the afternoon close, it was 38 taels and a half, a rebound of six taels and a half compared to the previous day, which was a reaction to three consecutive days of decline. The highest price in the half-day was 4 taels and 5 qian, and the lowest price was 36 taels and a half, a range of four taels. The morning price for bullion was 8 taels and 3 qian, and the afternoon close was 8 taels. The announced price was still 777 taels, calculated down by 4 taels to over 38 taels, registered at 39 taels, and water supplemented at 37 taels.</p>
<p>Frequent Transactions. As for the transactions of various firms, Hengxing, Fuyu, Yongfeng, Futaiheng, Chenfengyong, Fuxingyong, and Yuanmao, etc., all bought. Tong Taichang, Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Tianfengyong, Yuanheng, and Yuantai, etc., all sold. Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Yuhe, Senchangyong, and Yuankangxiang, etc., had mixed buying and selling, in significant amounts. Bullion speculators were buying and selling intermittently. The Guangdong Gang bought two or three hundred bars, the Dalian Gang sold a total of six or seven hundred bars and bought two or three hundred bars. Speculators’ trading volume was limited, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Foreign Exchange Slightly Tighter <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the English and American silver markets reported a slight drop. Sino-American selling interest remained unwavering, and the market was calm. As for HSBC's listed rates, only Hong Kong was increased by 1.25, to 78 taels and 75, and Indian remittances increased by 0.25, to 84 rupees and 75. Other than that, there were no increases or decreases. It seems the domestic silver price was slightly tighter, but with minimal fluctuations, the situation was peaceful. With the gold market turning upward, there were no special changes either. Chinese merchants' transactions were normal, with English gold trading at about 100,000 pounds, and overall, buying exceeded selling. Banks such as Shanghai Hua Bi Bank and McGregor had both inflows and outflows. Among the gold firms, Fuchang, Chenfengyong, Runchang, Yusheng, and others were settling accounts. From Mumbai, a telegram reported selling, and the Japanese bank sold $200,000 USD, which was purchased by Guangdong Bang, Shengda etc., to hedge against gold, while the Dalian Bang sold slightly of Dalian notes, only in the amount of tens of thousands of dollars. Compared to the previous day, the results of each exchange showed that English exchange decreased by .0625, American exchange increased by .125, and Japanese exchange increased by 1 fen.

<p>General Market Situation. Yesterday was Saturday, and banks were closed in the afternoon as usual, so the atmosphere was particularly quiet. The market price of silver cents fell sharply, because most merchants had a large number of silver cents to hedge, and they were eager to sell due to the perceived weak demand for cocoon silk. As a result, the market atmosphere was dismal, and the price ultimately fell by a strong 2 li.</p>

<p>Bond Prices Rebounded Sharply This Week</p>
<p>Up Five or Six Yuan Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>Total Trading Reached Over 11.6 Million</p>
<p>This week, the prosperity of the local securities market was unprecedented. Except for one day, the weekend, which was a commemorative day for the National Humiliation of May 9th, the market was always extremely prosperous. Tuesday saw the largest trading volume, totaling 29.9 million. Friday was about 24 million, Monday and Wednesday were each over 20 million, and Thursday was relatively flat, with also about 19 million. In total, the trading volume for the five days reached 11,638,500 yuan, exceeding the previous week by over 2.5 million yuan.

Last week, people were uneasy, and all debts fell sharply. This week, the political situation improved and people were optimistic. In the first two days of the week, demand exceeded supply for all debts, with prices rising about two yuan each day. However, the trend was more peaceful on Wednesday, with prices rising first and then falling, resulting in no major fluctuations. On Wednesday and Thursday, however, the market rose higher day by day, with each day rising about one yuan. The situation is expected to gradually stabilize from now on. As a result, the 1928 Customs Loan and the 20% debt rebounded by five or six yuan compared to last week. The Disarmament Bond and the Disbandment debt and Whole Six debt also rose by about four yuan, and even the 1896 debt rebounded by about one and a half yuan.

<p>The Yarn Market Continues to be Good</p>
<p>The yarn market is firm because overseas cotton yarn conditions are consistently rising. People's sentiment is relatively good, and actual sales are becoming more active. The political situation is easing, rumors are calming down, and buyers' attitude is strong and bullish. Some large merchants have a very good outlook and have no intention of letting go. However, the majority of retail investors have heavy inventories and the political situation is still turbid. In addition, the season is currently slow, and their intention to sell short is also strong. However, the world cotton industry is gradually showing a turnaround. In the afternoon, the market was closed for half a day due to the May 9th Commemoration, it is said.</p>
<p>Bidding is Consistently Upward. At the opening of the previous market, the market atmosphere was firm. The good sentiment due to the rising price of American cotton of grade three, and the buying interest was strong. Each month rose 8 or 9 qian. The closing price was slightly lower, but the result was that each rose 3, 5, 6, or 8 qian. The trading volume totaled 13,400 bales. The market was closed for half a day in the afternoon.

<p>American Cotton Gradually Rises ... Inventories are not Abundant</p>
<p>The cotton market has skyrocketed, sentiment is good, and Japanese merchants are holding firm and not letting go. Local inventories are relatively short, so the market atmosphere is getting tighter. There are not a few who sell short and then buy to cover. But spot cotton transactions are still sluggish, so some are selling short. However, the inventory in Hankou is also dry, and American cotton is also rising, so there is a deep fear that it will be difficult to fall, it is said.</p>
<p>Han Standard Rises Two or Three Qian. At the opening of the previous market, the market atmosphere was firm due to the rising price of American cotton again.

<p>Cold and Rainy in the South ... Short Covering, Colleagues Slightly Entered</p>
<p>New York, 8th, telegram report of the cotton market last week. The rebound of the cotton market last week was due to the cold and rain in the South during the past week. However, the power of its rebound was limited to short covering. Colleagues also slightly bought in, but because the weight of securities is downstream, even though the weather is not good, it has still not significantly increased demand. The sale of fertilizer in the 13 states of the South, from December to April, the past five , decreased by 28.6% compared to the same time last year. The cotton crop report stated that the climate was humid and the temperature was too low, causing the benefits to be delayed. Most are in urgent need of dry and warm weather. The chairman of the Agricultural Policy Bureau, Mr. Stone, said that private estimates of reduced cotton fields averaged 12.5%. This estimate may not be wrong, and the reduction in fertilizer demand can actually prove it. The weekend statistics are attached below. (Unit: 1,000 bales)</p>

<p>Customer Xian Rice is Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian rice market was quite quiet. Because the local street had Do-Mi rice coming in continuously, there were no more inquiries. There were also no transactions by customer gangs, and the market was immediately dull. However, the cargo owners were unwilling to reduce prices for sale because the source was cut off, so transactions completely stopped. However, Nanjing rice came by train, without export permits. Furthermore, the cargo could not be stored for long. The cargo owners mostly sought to sell quickly. Yesterday, 424 bags of newly arrived Nanjing machine rice were offered, priced at 9 yuan, 7 jiao and a half to 9 yuan, 7 jiao. Nanjing rice, 500 bags, priced at 8 yuan, 4 jiao to 8 yuan, 2 fen and a half. The price was slightly better than the price offered last month, but weaker than the previous market. It was all taken in by the local street, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Forward Delivery Flour Houses Absorbing <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Early Closing of the Trading Session</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, foreign wheat prices were quoted up 12 cents, and short covering activity arose to offset losses. Though local buyers did not inquire much, flour houses with forward deliveries were absorbing (flour). Manufacturers were still not selling, and the market price was seen to rise step by step. However, the miscellaneous grains exchange was closed for the day, and there were few buyers at the flour exchange, so there was little trading throughout the day, and the closing of the session was also early. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, June to August were up 5%, September was up 7.5%, and October was up 1%, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Sugar Market <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>60,000 Bags of Forward Japanese Sugar Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from the production areas indicated that Cuban spot sugar prices rose slightly by 0.03125 compared to previous telegrams. New York sugar futures for May rose by one cent, and the remaining months each rose by two cents. Spot Java sugar futures still lacked increases or decreases. In the syndicate market, the buying interest in Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand was particularly sluggish, with a quoted price of taels 10.05, and no inquiries at all. There were also few buyers for No. 20 medium white sand at taels 10. Spot Japanese sugar saw some scattered transactions, and the market price remained unchanged. N Mark was still at taels 10.06, YT Mark at taels 10.05, YP Mark at taels 10.0925 to taels 10.09, YRO Mark at taels 9.95, SH Mark at taels 10.015, and J Mark at taels 10.0975. The market shape was still stable. Meiji Sugar opened 30,000 bags for delivery in July and August, including 10,000 bags of YP Mark at a price of Japanese yen 4.50, 14,000 bags of YT Mark at a price of yen 4.435, and 6,000 bags of YRO Mark at a price of yen 3.95. Most of these were purchased by various firms from Zhenjiang, and other businesses showed little interest, so the market atmosphere felt particularly calm and unsurprising. Yu Yuanlai &amp; Co. offered over a hundred bags of No. 3 Ice at taels 13.20, a particularly favorable price. However, the goods were old stock and of inferior color, so there were not many buyers, it is said.</p>

<p>Foreign Firms' Silk Market Remains Weak</p>
<p>Continuing from this port, the foreign firms' silk market remains weak. The reason is that overseas silk sales are not moving, and telegrams are sparse. Furthermore, the exchange rate is increasing, and the telegrammed silk price is even lower, making transactions difficult. In the past three days, only Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and others imported fifty bales of Shanghai white factory silk and forty bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, while Butterfield &amp; Swire and others imported twenty bales of white "qian" silk, and Samsung and others imported twenty-five bales of yellow coarse silk. The price is increasingly weak, it is said.</p>

<p>The current situation of sericulture in the north and south markets and villages of Wujin is not good. The early silkworms in the southwest villages suffered significant losses due to the cold weather. Many in the eastern villages are raising improved varieties, but the weather is unpredictably cold and warm, coupled with continuous spring rains, resulting in unfavorable development of the silkworm larvae. The early silkworms in the western villages have completed their second molt and have sufficient leaves, and the late groups in this area have also completed their second molt. Unexpectedly, continuous heavy rains have caused silkworm diseases to spread, with leaking yellow and dead silkworm diseases being discovered. Silkworm farmers are filled with pessimism, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Spring Silkworms in Haining Damaged by Heavy Rains <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Sericulture in the four villages of Haining is unfavorable this spring. Most of the early silkworms were abandoned in the cold rain, and the late silkworms are also developing slowly due to the cold weather, combined with little sunshine and much rain. The heavy rain of the day before yesterday, lasting for two days and nights, caused the silkworm larvae to change. Silkworms that had completed their third molt and had sufficient leaves did not molt and died, and vigorous silkworms were found to be leaking yellow. It is predicted that sericulture this year will inevitably decline, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Tea Season in Tunxi is Relatively Good <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Tunxi is the center of the tea industry in southern Anhui. Due to unfavorable business in recent years, various tea firms have been quite disheartened, either reducing their scope or ceasing operations, and the market situation has been unusually bleak. However, since the beginning of this [month], tea merchants, in view of the low inventory in Shanghai, have once again reorganized and started business one after another. Tea firms have been established one after another, and there are currently as many as forty-six. On the mountain side, due to the difficulty in selling raw tea last year, many have also advanced the picking schedule. Although the weather is cold and the tea buds are not easy to develop, all have entered the mountains to pick green tea on the 5th of this month. It is predicted that the color and quality of tea from this route this year will be superior to previous years, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Yesterday's News After the New Tea Marketed <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the new tea being marketed. The tea factories only had over a hundred boxes on display. They were completely bought by firms such as Jilong, Xiehe, and Tongfu at a price of around taels 100, and the market situation was quite lively. Tea factories such as Yitongxing and Rusheng are employing workers day and night to rush production. Next Monday, a large quantity of "Zhen Mei" new samples will be displayed, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Tea Market in Xiushui is Bleak <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The black tea from Xiushui used to be of superior quality and taste, and was sold to foreign firms in large quantities. In recent years, due to changes in soil and climate, and lack of diligent planting by mountain farmers, the quality of production has deteriorated. The Wuyue and Yingkou groups, which export boxed tea to foreign firms, have suffered repeated losses. The number of firms is decreasing. This year, the number of foreign tea merchants entering the mountains is even rarer than hen's teeth. Only one Wuyue firm continues to operate for foreign firms, and the rest are small organizations operating both tea shops and bamboo-basket tea. New tea from Ruoxi, Kengchi, Manjiang, and Xinchang began to be picked after Guyu [Grain Rain]. The initial mountain price was from 600 to 300-400 cash per catty, similar to last year, but sales to foreign firms have stopped completely, and it all depends on the sales of shop tea. However, the capacity is not very large, and the mountain price must be reduced to allow for large-scale purchases, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Piece Goods <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The White Crepe Cloth Market is Improving</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the piece goods market, because the price of "Three Products" rose again and was more firm, the white crepe cloth, which had been weak for a long time, also rose with it. In fact, the price has been gradually increasing, and merchants are optimistic and reluctant to sell. Furthermore, market participants are buying in, so the prices of various brands have risen by about five cents. Yesterday, Moganshan, Jiaoye, and Tishu were all at taels 4.10, Maxie at taels 4.075, Tongpan at taels 4.20. Spot goods are gradually becoming scarce, but "Yuanyang Miao" still lacks vitality and seems to be in a slump. The reason is that Shanghai is full of inventory, and there are many who urgently need to pledge silver, so it is difficult to improve. Yesterday, "Dian Qiuxiang" was still at taels 10.0325, and "Yipin Fugui" spot goods had fallen to taels 10.015. "Little Beauty" has also fallen. The situation requires a period of smooth actual sales before it can turn around. Poplin is still selling well, and fine wool flannel is still actively being traded by the Changjiang group, with over fifty pieces being transacted. "Gongsun Tu" was at cash 0.02925, "Hele Tu" at cash 0.02975, "Ronghua Fugui" at cash 0.03, "Huxin Ting" at cash 0.03275, and "Sanyou Tu" at cash 0.03175, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Oil Market <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Tung Oil Prices in Hankou Rise Repeatedly</p>
<p>The reason why White Tung Oil prices in Hankou are repeatedly rising is that during the past week, the foreign firms only traded fractional lots and no integral lots, and happened to be at the time when five to six thousand piculs of Xiang Tung Oil were arriving. This oil was sold as soon as it arrived in Hankou. Therefore, the market was slightly weak as a result. The foreign firms sold the oil for taels 20.04, taels 20.02, taels 20.00, and taels 19.80. Each time the opening session traded only several dozen tons, which wasn't enough to attract the attention of the market. However, the inventory in Hankou is extremely thin, and the dealers who sold short haven't been able to cover their positions. Therefore, it's easiest for the market price to rise as soon as foreign firms trade a large number of lots. Yesterday, this port suddenly received a telegram from Hankou saying that foreign firms had sold at taels 20.08. There were even rumors that another telegram said that it had traded at taels 21.40. Although there's no way to confirm it, it's likely not groundless. As such, it's already risen taels 1.5-1.6 compared to last week. One wouldn't call this a clap of thunder out of the blue. Although we haven't received an official report on the cause of the rise, it's generally due to the fact that overseas sales are flourishing, and the demand has surpassed the supply. Hangzhou also followed suit. According to the firms in Hangzhou, they require thirty-one yuan per picul delivered to Shanghai, which is one yuan higher than before. This port is currently in the midst of the sericulture season in the surrounding areas, so the market can't be as lively as it was half a month ago. Therefore, it can only follow Hankou's lead, it is said.</p>
