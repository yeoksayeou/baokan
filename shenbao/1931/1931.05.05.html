<p>自由談世界小事記  海客　　倫敦愛蒙頓議會Edmonton　Council中提議。擬將許多次等街道中所植的樹木。都題以著名的科學家的名字。作爲紀念。　　英國擬建造一隻小飛機。可坐二人。摺疊起來只有八英尺闊。八英尺十一英寸高。二十二英尺五英寸長。造成後擬放在潛水艇中應用。　　據歐洲一位著名的衛生家宣稱。十六歲的青年。應與一個從事於園藝等户外工作的壯丁。吃同樣多量的食物。身體纔可强壯。　　英國電氣事業的發達。遠過於六年以前。人們所用的電氣。也比六年前加多一倍。　　瑞士風景甲天下。每年前去遊覽的人極多。所以旅館計有三千六百所。僱用職員六萬一千人。資本額計共六千萬金鎊。　　英國有兎子田塲。專養兎子。每年所得兎皮。計共十五萬張。　　紐約犯罪的婦女。日見增多。各監獄中的女犯。查一千九百二十年的統計。祇有一千一百五十人。現在多至一倍有餘。鄰婦哀聲  柯定盦　　男權與女權平等之說。比來甚囂塵上。然亦徒掠美名。而無實行之可言也。隔鄰某甲。服務於本埠電業公司。妻某氏。以賢德著。有子女各一。長巳五齡。幼亦三周歲矣。平日夫婦間感情極融洽。休沐之日。輒相偕出遊。載言載笑。其樂靡涯。同里之人。方歆羡彼二人之多情多福。不意事出常軌。有非他人所能臆測者。且一述之。　　數月來。某甲頓變常態。平時每日下午五時。公司事畢。即行返家。以叙天倫之樂。其妻則調羹作饌。倍極殷勤。此固人生樂事也。惟近數月某甲恒深夜不歸。即歸亦在晨鷄高唱之時。且屢以細故與其夫口角。伊尚以伊恐在外受氣。吞聲飲恨。好言以進。圖復原有之和諧。不料反嬰其。怒惡詈狂駡。伊亦忍之。默然無語。如是多日。伊忽聞人言。伊夫在外另有所歡矣。伊聞之戚然。初未深信。乃顧事思情。似爲事實。倘彼憐新棄舊。則孤苦一身。將來之生活何恃。憂患紛乘。伊亦憔悴甚矣。　　一日。綠衣人投一函至。函面書伊名。適爲伊姑所接。姑亦略識之無者。知爲男子手筆。秘而不與。待某甲歸。私與共讀。果爲另一男子所寄伊者。某甲忿極。竊以苦無把柄可尋。今有此函。可償所願矣。當某甲與母讀函時。伊方治餐。初未之覺某甲疾趨廚下。執伊髮而倒曳之出。拳毆足蹴丶伊姑袖手旁觀。復助桀爲虐。迨甲精疲力盡。始行罷手。而伊則力竭聲嘶。伏地不起。尚未知何由開罪於夫也。正思維間。某甲以函擲地。曰無怪近日態度之異常。原來如此。繼以冷笑。伊視函。知爲未婚時之男友所與者。函中不過爲問候語丶並無涉及淫穢。得罪之因。乃由此也。然亦無力更作聲辯。此後。某甲竟禁錮伊於一室。余當午夜夢回。輒聞嬌啼。其聲凄厲。不忍卒聽。伊室與余寓相距較近。故聞之異常悲戚。文明之上海。所謂男女平權。如此如此。噫。如何增進婚姻之美滿  陳元良　　婚姻美滿。畢生之幸福繫焉。否則貌合神離。雖未占脫輻。而勉强同居。亦屬毫無樂趣。歐美人士。對於婚姻問題。研究靡遺。頃閱日本東京「婦女世界」雜誌中某君所撰一文。覺其體貼入微。語多中肯。特迻譯之如次。　　某君之意。以爲家庭之組織。純以愛情爲成分。苟能殷勤將護。愛情可賴以維持。其規條爲夫壻所應遵守者。計十一項。略分習慣。妬嫉。財政。休假。衛生。服飾。飲食。子女及家政等。下列數項。爲夫壻所不應行者。（一）閒常燕居。勿使烟屑墜落地席。（日人席地而坐）致使爾妻多一番操作。（一）相見如賓。久而敬之。即膳時亦勿因畏熱而遽裸裎。（一）偶感精神不振。或身體微覺不適。勿遽嘵嘵以擾之。因伊主持家政。巳足勞矣。（一）勿在人前取用不潔之手絹。致引起他人藐視伊之偶然疏忽。（一）平居力避枯寂。宜常述故事趣聞。逗其笑樂。（一）逢其容顔嬌媚時。應力讚其美。若呈不豫之色。則又應温慰有加。（一）因領帶之未更。皮鞋之未擦。而斤斤在人前訾其妻者。則其家庭斷非完美。（一）伊欲邀爾同赴商塲。雖至不願。亦須勉强一行。歸途可同入咖啡館。茶叙小息（一）無論何事。須徵求伊之意見。雖伊之意見。未必無誤。但伊之意見。亦未必皆誤也。（一）巳成婚之男子。不可過於矜持。否則宛如木石。對之興趣索然。（一）愛貴有表示。當坦然稱其爲我愛或我愛你。因結婚巳久。不必再作新婚之夕覥靦之態矣。（一）女子之美。約分兩種。一爲康健美。一爲精神美。爾妻二者或佔其一。則爾應盡力譽其特點。使伊知爾巳能領略彼之真趣。（一）若感觸不良。宜守寗靜。勿輕發怒。擊碗拍桌諸弊。尤當避免。（一）妻黨姻婭。時加親近。伊欲歸寗。亦勿禁止。將來小别重逢。彌增情味。然愛情以持久爲佳。運用有節。若新婚時過濃。則歷久必衰。（一）妻前勿自誇收入之豐。勿失時。勿說謊。勿忘其生辰。届時應聊申慶祝以紀念之。（一）若逢衣紐脫落而未縫。勿遽出言不遜。致起誤會。（一）詰責妻室。勿高聲。防鄰里傭役及子女知之。與其體面攸關。（一）在兒女之前。切勿言及若無我爾儕將成餓莩等語。須與若輩共同尋樂。使其心坎中常有一可愛之父存在。（一）路逢女友。當代爲介紹。否則易啓疑竇而掀醋波。（一）家庭費用。當解釋來難去易之意義。勸其節省。探其用途但勿行之如守財虜。（一）家庭佈置。什物不可擅自移動。破其紀綱。（一）伊自制之衣履。若有不愜爾意者。不宜儘量批評指摘。當原諒其巳費盡心機矣。（一）如小别家門。亦宜尺素頻通。報告旅况。雖區區郵片之代價未多。而爾妻覩爾平安兩字。蘭閨寂寞之空氣。可賴以打破也。天南梅訊  知　　梅畹華等一行。此遭重膺禮聘。出演港粤。將以其最近研究之所得。與南中人士一資商榷。由滬南行。巳見報載。兹並摘紀其到粤後之行止。以爲知好告云。　　二十日。大洋丸到港。二十二日由澳門轉中山縣。訪唐少川氏。洽談甚久。并同往翠亭村謁中山先生故居。上花圈。二十三日返澳門。偕劉玉麟公使赴澳督茶會。二十五日下午二時半由港乘佛山輪抵粤。到輪歡迎者甚多。由陳主席之私人秘書鄧思曉代表歡迎。與畹華握手。登岸後。陳主席即與陳總指揮合宴於退思園。其上岸時。圍觀者至數千人。　　畹登岸後。赴東亞酒店之歡迎會。此會由八和會館律師公會南洋烟草公司海珠戲院等團體所合組。由陶君安君同往。律師公會代表致歡迎詞。畹致答詞。即由陶君翻譯粤語。衆賓鼓掌。　　出歡迎會後。即往謁陳主席於私宅。暢談甚久。續續往訪陳總指揮。以赴燕塘閱操。未及晤。下午六時。出席退思園。畹華衣夜常禮服。賓主盡歡。陳總指揮并送大横額。　　二十九日開演。總部留座甚多。爭欲一賞中國藝術化之戲劇。第一晚西施。第二晚太真外傳。第三晚别姬。第四晚二本太真外傳。第五晚别姬。第六晚洛神。此爲預定劇目。亦粤中各界所要求者。印度遊記（四三）  靈花　　二十七日。克利須拿會請吃飯。此寺甚大。可半里。房舍洋式。甚整潔。僧二百名。并養貧民。男女作工。進食殊豐富。可二十品。印度之佳饌。亦不在中國下也。味似有優於中國者。然大不同。印度之食法。與中國異。所謂二十品者。與一人食之。分食而非共食。有一半似西法也。我在印度人處食時。注意所食之多少。若此種一人食一二十品。只有暴殄天物而巳。何者。印人奇俗。凡進過他人之食物。不論多少。一律抛棄。不許食他人之物。成宗敎上迷信。不飲人之茶。人亦不得飲之。不與人接觸。其原因均由於階級制度。至今余尚不明白其交際之定則。總之與人以飲食。條件甚多。人欲向彼飲食。亦條件甚多。令吾人頭昏也。若有人誤飲他人之茶。或與人以茶及食品。或與他人共食。即犯規律。故甘地赴英遊學。其族人施以公罪。因須與英人共食也。有與外人通婚者。亦爲破規律。其滯碍難言。　　至其食味純素。多香花甜脆。及牛乳。牛乳變化甚多。可二十種。凡合牛乳糖油花果五種原質。爲印人常食品。四時皆花。蔬果芬芳。故素食味甚佳也。但其甜性太大。吾人不能食印度産蕉故也。今世界食味品評。自以中華爲第一。然印度食品之佳者。吾以爲决不在中華下。至印人之食。午食爲飯。夕食爲麵。以爲常。余將在證道會講演。克利須拿會爲我用打字機打講稿。其僧人普通均用英語。此印度敎堂遍於全印。并歐美亦有之。至其欵均捐自美國。舍美國今世界無施主也。　　二十八日。晚六時。在證道會Theosophical　Society講演此會故友伍廷芳先生曾爲其會員。全球各國均有之。會長乃一女子。Dr.　Besant今年八十四矣。所辦大學及慈善事甚多。由其創辦也。或云其有神通。則不得而知。講題爲小兒爲何啼哭。是想母親。聽者四五百人。有持油抹我頭者。印度之風也。我講主旨爲世界廢戰運動。須用母權。結果到中山大同主義。當晚各英印報均發表講稿。由該會登正月分報。云達於全球。凡四十七國云。印度本境分會數百處。在該會所遇全球士女甚多。遠者有澳洲紐西蘭者。且有回敎各國人士。殊不易遇也。說部扶輪會霍桑探案轉灣（四）  程小青　　（二）　無可理喻　　正在這時。猛覺得我的左肩膊上輕輕一拍。同時有一股香氣。直襲我的鼻管。我立即住了脚步。旋轉頭去。便和那個西裝朋友面面相對。我不認識他。也不知他有什麽用意。我正待發問。那人忽有一種出乎意外的舉動。他的右手從外褂袋中摸出一種白色的東西。向着我左手中一塞。接着便又放開脚步。急急的前進。　　我一時竟呆住了。原來他這舉動完全出我的意料。我的右手雖巳摸着了槍柄。却又不便貿然亂放。因爲我左手中還不知是什麽東西。我的手指自然而然的握了一握。却是一個白巾的小包。在這一握的舉動之中。還發出些細碎磨擦聲音。怪了。這是什麽東西呢。那小包並不沉重。不像是危險物品。在這時候我的理智指示我。第一步動作應把這包中的東西瞧一個明白。於是我的右手立即放了槍柄。急急把那包打開。那是一塊四週摺邊的細白麻紗巾。曾經熨鐵燙過。還帶着濃烈的香氣。這小包幸虧是捲裹着的。並没打結。我在兩三秒鐘時間。巳經展了開來。可是展開以後。我的目光一和包中的東西接觸丶這一驚却非同小可。原來白巾中却是一條異光耀目的珠項圈。　　我彷彿進了夢境。有一聲訝異的驚呼。自動的喉關中衝出來。我口中的那枚紙烟也頓時落在地上。我巳彷彿失了知覺。抬頭一瞧。前面那個穿灰呢外衣的西裝男子。巳在十多碼外。他的背形還隱約可見。這個人有什麽用意。善意的還是惡意的呢。但無論如何。他和我旣面不相識。却把這樣的東西交在我手。我决不能輕輕放他過去。我不再猶豫。順手把白巾和項圈塞在袋中。也放開脚步。急急向前追趕。我的步驟巳從安步變了跑步。恨不得立即把那人抓住。可是我祇跑了三四步遠。猛聽得我的背後也有急促的奔跑聲音。同時我又聽得有人高聲呵喝道。「且慢。」　　這呵喝的命令是向我發的麽。還是對前面的人呢。我不能不疑訝起來。但我的聽覺雖然接受了這個命令。我的兩足却還不肯服從。我的全神旣完全貫注在前面的人。疑訝的結果。以爲這呵喝是向我的前面的人發的。不料碎的一聲。衝破了這沉靜的空氣。原來我後面的人竟因誤會而開槍了。我怎樣應付呢。可能再繼續前進麽。那似乎不智。我爲了避免誤會的犧牲。勢不能不停止脚步。同時我又舉起兩手。以防他第二次開槍。</p>

<p>國民會議在中國丶不但我們向皇帝俯首稱臣的時候未曾有過丶即民國二十年來丶亦以此爲破題兒第一遭丶因此政府與人民丶没有什麽經騐丶可作結果圓滿的保障丶一切因嘗試而生的幼稚的弊病丶多少不免有些丶我們今日能在預定的日期狂歌歡笑以慶祝國民會議的開幕丶巳經算是各地民衆對國民會議贊助熱烈的表徵丶當國民會議議成之初丶任何同志丶祗要稍稍留意中國現狀的不景氣丶似乎都有爲國民會議前途抱憂丶至少的限度丶總以爲國民會議要延長到五月五日以後幾個月纔開得成功丶這個出乎意料的準期開會丶不僅是中國政治進步的象徵丶實在是革命成功的預兆丶</p>
<p>我們必追溯專制時代的情形丶就算是民國成立以來丶政府與人民中間好像有了一道極大的鴻溝丶民是民丶國是國丶政府可以不必打算人民的利益丶人民亦無絲毫期望於政府丶尤其近幾年間各地荒亂迭起丶人民求免饑寒不得丶還有什麽念頭顧到政府丶十幾年來丶在軍閥此興彼仆的變亂中丶人民除了俯首貼耳以外丶絶無所謂國是可以引起大衆的想念丶</p>
<p>這個國與民隔離的僵局丶一直因襲丶到不久以前丶在人民或許夢想不到有個本黨起來丶爲全國人民爭口氣丶然而本黨畢竟担負了救中國的責任丶從紛亂的局面中謀成統一丶剷除叛亂無常的軍閥獲得和平丶人民在這個民國以來空前未有的偉業中丶逐漸認識本黨的面目丶於是乃由認識而生愛護之心丶以今日情形而論丶不特本黨的立義丶在人民中間丶有普遍的信仰丶幾年來因本黨的努力而獲得的一切政績丶在民衆的心坎中也有了深刻的同情丶</p>
<p>大可樂觀的局面丶不時的向前展布丶本黨同志丶覺得中國政治的責任丶遲早是要人民自巳來担負丶如果不使人民在這個統一和平的環境中把國與民打成一片丶則本黨的主義將何以自解於國民會議之前丶總理在時丶要想藉國民來謀中國之統一與建設丶因爲總理眼看國民對政治袖手旁觀丶僅賴本黨少數的同志丶實在無法担負統一與建設的重大責任丶就目前的情形而言丶統一兩字丶雖然由本黨從軍閥割據的局面中千辛萬苦掙日得來丶但統一的保障丶究竟有待於民衆的齊心協力丶且本黨致力國民革命幾十年來丶雖自信本黨主張丶爲救濟本國之良藥丶然欲得國民普遍的了解丶亦大非易事丶所以這次國民會議召集的意義丶是將本黨的主張丶提出期得國民澈底明瞭與贊助丶</p>
<p>本來這種謀國家統一與建設的責任丶乃是國民本身分所應爾丶似乎用不着本黨的催促丶可是中國遠受幾千年來專制的箝制丶近受軍閥政治的壓迫丶本黨幾十年來微弱的民權的種子丶不待發芽早被蹂躪殆盡丶人民對政治丶噤若寒蟬丶人民對國事丶冷如死灰丶我們今日要在新下種子抽出的嫩芽上丶盡培養的責任丶所以這次國民會議丶除了種種的目的以外丶建樹人民政治的興味丶乃是一個重大的意義丶本黨的三民主義是主張政治爲人民所有丶爲人民所治丶爲人民所享丶所以要使政治發揮其本來的作用丶要政治滿足人民的欲求丶必須人民自巳熟練使用政權的技能丶在訓政時期丶人民使用政權的能力丶未有充分丶本黨固可代民行使丶但本黨决定要將政權交還於民衆丶同時訓政的期間規定是六年丶我們希望人民能在預定的訓政時間定了以後丶將政權接受了去丶不得不在這個訓政的過程中丶引起人民對政治濃厚的興味丶就這次各地選舉代表而言丶雖然參加的選民未能多數而應選的人都能在選舉的正軌上行事丶一洗從前一切包攬舞弊的情形丶即如競爭選舉熱烈的地方丶也能用正當競選的方法進行丶這種良好的現象丶不能不說政治上軌道的表現丶我們可以預料這次國民會議以後丶必然能引起全國人民對政治熱烈的同情丶從前人民對政治枯燥乏味以至於灰心消極的情形丶一定可以掉轉頭來</p>
<p>在這一個統一基礎粗具的現在丶我們覺得有兩大障礙丶不得不設法解除丶一個是民生疾苦丶一個是列强侵略丶由於這兩大問題的重要丶使我們愈信人民不能再姑息苟安不問政治丶事實是這樣的丶要民生問題有了相當的解决同時必須打倒帝國主義丶廢除了不平等條約丶中國才會獲得真實的統一丶必須先使中國統一丶才能從事於實際的建設丶以解除民生疾苦而論丶决不是政府片面的設計丶能臻於完善丶民衆疾苦莫好於人民自巳來設法解除丶國民會議的目的丶就是要靠人民自巳的力量丶解决人民自巳切身的要求丶就對外廢除不平等條約而言丶需要人民齊心協力做去丶尤是毫無疑問的丶在過去外交所以失敗丶一方面固然政府的昏庸丶同時因人民任政府昏庸而不加糾正丶未始不是一個極大的原因丶革命的外交丶必須要民衆爲政府作後盾丶以前民衆力量的表現丶大都是散漫没有集中丶這次國民會議裏面丶一定會討論到對外廢約的問題丶集全國民衆代表於一堂丶集思廣益丶以研究如何解除列强的侵略丶這不特使政府外交當局丶可本民意而進行丶而全國民衆熱烈的呼求丶必能使帝國主義者心膽俱驚丶我們根據上述的觀察丶國民會議丶不僅具有建樹人民政治興趣的功能丶而以中國目前的情形論丶國民會議丶乃爲人民表現偉大政治力量的集會丶我們於此不禁高呼丶</p>

<p>At 2:00 PM today, Zhang hosted a banquet for representatives from Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Zhang spoke for over an hour, stating that the current educational expenditures and rural economy are vastly different. People want to cultivate a child to study, it requires exhausting the entire family's production to provide for it, and it's still not enough. Even if they succeed in their studies, the living standards are raised, and returning to their hometown, they are unaccustomed to living there, they will inevitably leave and go to all directions. This is no different than causing family breakdown and death for the sake of education. Therefore, regarding the issue of popular education, I hope the representatives from the North will pay close attention to practical relief measures. Zhang's proposal to the National Assembly is also only on education. The others are just reports on the situation in the North. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<p>Zheng Hongnian said that this political crisis will definitely not expand and will not lead to military action. A certain foreign envoy's telegram from Guangzhou three days ago stated that only Gu Yingfen was the most excited about the Guangzhou affair, concurrently serving as the chairman of the Civil Affairs Department and the Finance Department. A small number of Chen Jitang's subordinates participated, and Chen was acting passively. In the eyes of foreigners, the Chinese situation is not serious. The political crisis has been revealed, and the central committees believe that there is no need to keep it a secret. Zhang Ji and Dai Jitao both visited Hu Hanmin and had a pleasant conversation. Hu has the intention to come out. The crux of the situation is that Hu's attendance at the National Assembly will resolve everything. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>

The Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan are instructed to order the competent authorities to promptly draft implementation measures and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for review and promulgation." Two days after the National Government issued the order, the Minister of Foreign Affairs issued a declaration to explain the National Government's order. The last paragraph of the declaration stated: "The latter is a definite statement, believing that there is no disagreement between the various countries and China regarding the above principles, and if there are any opinions on the measures currently being prepared by the government, they are also willing to deliberate with them within a reasonable period." Therefore, the National Government's order of December 28th is actually a step to remove the causes of misunderstandings and enhance the relationship between Chinese and foreigners. Based on the above declaration, for sixteen months, the National Government has actively engaged in negotiations with the six relevant countries. Several countries have already concluded agreements with the National Government to abolish extraterritoriality. However, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States have not been able to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the National Government. The National Government is quite satisfied with the sympathy of the aforementioned countries, especially the United Kingdom, for seeking to realize China's reasonable expectations. However, it is regrettable that these countries have not been able to fully accept the unanimous and urgent demands of the Chinese government and people at this time. The Premier, on his deathbed, instructed us to advocate for the convening of a National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties as soon as possible. Now that the National Assembly is about to open, it further awakens the National Government's responsibility for abolishing unequal treaties, especially the responsibility for abolishing consular jurisdiction. Under these circumstances, the National Government has no other choice but to declare the unfortunate suspension of legal rights negotiations with the remaining unresolved countries and issue today's orders and regulations for the implementation of the jurisdiction over foreigners in China. The purpose of these regulations is to strive to eliminate disputes between Chinese and foreigners and enhance the relationship between Chinese and foreigners. Therefore, the Chinese government and people firmly believe that this intention can gain a correct understanding and be endorsed by the people of all countries in the world.

<p>I have often said that the world economy is so depressed today, international trade is so sluggish, and silver prices are so low that it is impossible to reverse this dangerous trend without the combined efforts of all countries, with a fair and impartial heart, to discuss and determine all feasible methods. Today, the International Chamber of Commerce held in Washington brings together business representatives from 46 countries and major industrialists from all over the world, intending to take this opportunity to discuss these major issues, which is truly in line with the needs of the times. According to the American telegram, the economic situation in the Far East will occupy an important position in this conference. The board of directors has passed a resolution requesting the governments of relevant countries to consult and save the situation affected by the low silver prices in order to revive trade with China. Therefore, it is expected that the silver price issue will become the most important issue in this conference, along with war debts, tariffs, and relations with Russia. From the perspective of the Far East, world trade will also be discussed at the conference. It can be seen that the so-called International Chamber of Commerce is entirely focused on the development of Far Eastern trade. In other words, the world's attention is focused on the development of trade with China, and the so-called joint operation of the world's industrial and commercial armies to overcome the difficulties of the world economy is nothing more than the combined efforts of the world to break through the difficulties of trade with China. If this conference only thinks in this way, then the method of seeking to stabilize the world economy is also inevitably lacking in breadth of vision. Two important domestic telegrams</p>

<p>He Yingqin Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday</p>
<p>Remarks on Bandit Suppression</p>
<h3 id="e36">Nanjing <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>He Yingqin, accompanied by his wife Wang Wenxiang and entourage, arrived in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 4th after traveling by train from Nanchang to Xun and transferring to the Yongsu ship. Ge Jingen, Cao Haosen, Zhou Yawei, Xia Douyin, Chen Yi, and others went to the naval wharf on the riverbank to greet him. After disembarking, He went to his private residence by car to rest briefly, and then attended the Central Standing Committee meeting. Reporters, because of the three months of bandit suppression in the front, which has attracted the attention of people at home and abroad, specifically went to visit him by car, and the conversation was as follows: The reporter asked, "When did Minister He leave Jiangxi and what is the purpose of this trip?" He replied, "During the Aviation Conference and the Central Provisional Plenary Meeting, I wanted to come to Nanjing, but I was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief to sit in Nanchang, so I did not come. However, regarding the bandit suppression situation in the four provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei, it is necessary to report to the central government, and there are some operational plans that need to be instructed by the Commander-in-Chief. Furthermore, the National Assembly is one of the Premier's last wishes and should be attended. Therefore, I made a special trip from Nanchang yesterday afternoon." Asked, "When will Minister He return to Jiangxi?" He replied, "The work of bandit suppression has been very tense recently. I have decided to actively handle all matters and return to Nanchang within a day or two." Asked, "What is the situation of the Red bandits?" He replied, "The Red bandits are most numerous in Jiangxi, and their poison is also the most severe. Such tragic acts as burning, looting, and killing are extremely contrary to humanity and unbearable to describe." Asked, "How is the work of bandit suppression going? Can you briefly explain?" He replied, "The bandit leaders Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, etc., are now near Ningdu in southern Jiangxi. Although they have no less than tens of thousands of people and about 20,000 firearms, since our army began its general offensive last month, many bandits have been captured and thousands of bandit weapons have been seized. Therefore, the key points formerly occupied by the bandits, such as Guangchang, Futian, Baisha, Zhaitian, and Xinfeng, have all been occupied by our army. In total, hundreds of miles have been recovered in all directions, the bandit area has been shrinking daily, and the bandit situation has become increasingly difficult. However, our army's plans are extremely secret, and it will be difficult for the bandits to escape even if they want to flee elsewhere. Moreover, due to our offensive, the bandits' internal opinions are divided daily, making them easier to annihilate." Asked, "Because the people of the country are concerned about the bandit suppression, some people suspect that this military action is slow. What do you think of public opinion?" He replied, "The outside world does not understand the military situation. It is inevitable to be criticized for seeking perfection, but the Red bandits' usual tactics have been to break up the whole into parts and harass in all directions. This time, the suppression is aimed at the right symptoms and is gradually clearing them up, gaining an inch at a time. Therefore, the bandits' usual tactics have become ineffective, and our progress has been slightly slower." Asked, "What is the attitude of the officers and soldiers and the people towards bandit suppression?" He replied, "Our officers and soldiers of all armies are very clear that if the Red bandits are not eliminated for one day, the Party and the country will not be peaceful for one day. Therefore, they are making great efforts to suppress them, and they are not slackening even in the face of continuous rain. This is indeed enough to comfort the people of the country. As for the people, they were initially lured and intimidated by the Red bandits, so they were often anesthetized by them. Recently, seeing the inhumanity of the Red bandits, many have come to surrender." Asked, "What are Minister's plans for the aftermath of bandit suppression?" He replied, "I believe that the army's bandit suppression is only a temporary solution. The fundamental clearing of bandits still depends on politics and the organization of popular self-defense. Therefore, after I arrived in Jiangxi, I consulted with the Party and the country and the people to reorganize politics and promote the organization of popular regiments to make a plan for the fundamental solution. Now, local areas are actively organizing defense groups. After the main force of the bandits is eliminated this time, it will not be difficult to gradually eliminate the scattered bandits." Asked, "What are Minister's opinions on the Guangdong incident?" He replied, "Regarding the telegram from Mr. Gu Denglin and others regarding the Guangdong incident, the Central Supervisory Committee has corrected it and it should not expand. I always feel that the Red bandits are the great enemy of the people of the country, and no matter how different the opinions are among comrades, it is not difficult to resolve them." At this point, He had to rush to the Commander-in-Chief's banquet, and the reporter said goodbye and left.</p>

<p>Egyptian Police Clash with Civilians</p>

<p>After six leaders of the Egyptian National Party, including Nahas, arrived in Beni Suef, the masses demonstrated today and clashed with the police. The police fired into the air to warn the crowd, but the crowd threw stones at them. The police were forced to fire at the crowd, resulting in eight deaths and ten injuries. Some say there were forty-six injuries. Fifteen police officers were also injured. The crowd then dispersed. The Egyptian Prime Minister told a Reuters reporter that only four rioters had died and eleven were injured, while fifteen police officers were injured, including one seriously injured and one with a broken leg. The rioters smashed the car of the Beni Suef governor and beat the driver. The police fired in self-defense. The rioters also beat three ambulance drivers, destroyed the ambulance and a coffee shop opened by Egyptians. All the telephone lines in Beni Suef were cut, and it was pitch black at night. The authorities have sent troops to Beni Suef and have detained Nahas and others to the court for investigation when they return to Cairo. Troops have been dispatched to Beni Suef, but the town is now officially pacified. Cairo has taken necessary measures to maintain order. The Beni Suef incident proves that the opposition party incited the masses to riot in order to provoke British intervention in Egyptian affairs.</p>

<p>Central Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Week</p>
<h3 id="e99">Central Party Headquarters <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 110th Premier Memorial Week. Ding Weifen, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Miao Peicheng, Fang Juehui, Kong Xiangxi, Yang Shuzhuang, Zhang Daofan, Lu Dipeng, Wang Boling, Zhang Zhen, and hundreds of staff members attended. Ding Weifen chaired the meeting. Zhang Daofan reported on his inspection of party affairs in Zhejiang Province, stating briefly that he departed in early March and completed the inspection in early April. Regarding party affairs in the ten districts of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing, in terms of organization, there are 59 county party headquarters under the provincial party headquarters, 16 directly affiliated district party headquarters, 222 district party headquarters, and 957 district branches, for a total of 11,421 party organizations, with 17,000 probationary party members. Hangzhou County has the most party members, with 801, and Yuyao has the fewest, with 18. Hangzhou County has the most probationary party members, with 1,500. The responsible comrades of the provincial party headquarters are quite united, provide effective guidance, can cooperate with the provincial government, and can gain the trust of the people. Most of the county party headquarters are well-organized, and some have been reorganized in accordance with the resolutions of the Central Plenary Session. The better performing ones are Hangzhou County, Yin County, Haiyan, and Changxing, while the worst are Pinghu and Fenghua. Those that should be good but are not in reality are Jiaxing, Wuxing, and Shaoxing. Since the reorganization of the provincial government last winter, the provincial treasury has been in deficit and has had to adopt a tight policy. After the abolition of likin, the province's total revenue, including business tax, is only 17 million yuan, of which at least 5 million yuan must be set aside for principal and interest repayments on public bonds and interest on bank loans. In fact, there are only 12 million yuan left, while the provincial budget cannot be reduced to less than 20 million yuan, a difference of 8 to 9 million yuan. This is the biggest difficulty at present and cannot be solved without special subsidies from the central government. Currently, all personnel in the provincial government can work together harmoniously, are loyal to their duties, and can cooperate effectively with the party headquarters, which is a good phenomenon.</p>

<p>Provincial Government Chairman Yang Shuzhuang, together with Central Special Inspector for Fujian Party Affairs Chen Zhaoying and Provincial Government Committee member Chen Peikun, had previously traveled to Shanghai by the Puan warship on April 28th, then transferred to Beijing to attend the Central Executive Committee's Provisional Plenary Session and the National Assembly. He also conferred with the Ministry of Finance on financial solutions for Fujian Province. Furthermore, Yang has drafted a proposal to reduce the provincial area of Fujian, which he will bring to Beijing. The proposal suggests dividing the current Fujian Province into Southern Fujian (south of the Min River) and Northern Fujian (north of the Min River). The capital of Southern Fujian would be set in Zhangzhou, and the capital of Northern Fujian would be set in Fuzhou or Jian'ou. (May 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Qingdao Implements Recovery of Fishing Rights <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Fishing Company Officially Opens</p>
<p>Japanese Residents United in Attempting Resistance</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Due to the long-term monopoly of the fishing industry in Jiaozhou Bay by the Japanese, the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce, in order to recover lost rights, has united with various sectors to establish a fishing joint-stock company. The original capital was set at 500,000 yuan, divided into 10,000 shares, each worth 50 yuan. In addition to the 5,000 shares held by the company's promoters, the remaining shares have been gradually subscribed by various sectors. The Chamber of Commerce has also recommended fifteen people, including Chairman Song Yuting, to be preparatory committee members. They have submitted a request to the Municipal Government to allocate two plots of official land on Heze Road and Xiaogang Road as the foundation for the establishment of a fish market and cold storage facility. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also telegraphed the Central Executive Yuan and various ministries, requesting that they order the Jiaohai Customs to faithfully implement central orders and strictly control foreign fishing vessels within the specified limits to protect the fishing industry and regain sovereignty. It is reported that the company, eager to start operations, has temporarily leased a private house on Xiaogang Road and officially held its opening ceremony on May 1st. Over a thousand people attended, including representatives from Party and government agencies, various organizations, and fish merchants. After the meeting began, Chairman Song Yuting first reported on the company's preparatory progress. Then, representatives Wang Chaofan, Zhou Jiayan, Yang Jinsheng, and Yu Jinhe successively delivered speeches, praising the company and encouraging them to work hard to recover fishing rights and wash away the previous humiliation. After the meeting, fish merchants began trading. However, it is reported that the Japanese side has been paying close attention. Most of the Japanese residents in Qingdao are engaged in fishing. If our plan is implemented, they will all be unemployed. They have secretly organized a fishing navigation maintenance association, hoping to resist. They have also sent seven representatives to the Japanese consulate to request assistance. Japanese Deputy Consul Mochizuki promised to accept their request. Indeed, the Japanese are unwilling to give up their right to invade territorial waters and fish illegally. (May 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Jiaoji Railway Implements Fare and Freight Increase <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Drafting Fourteen Provisional Measures</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway, following the resolution of the Ministry of Railways, will increase passenger and freight transportation rates by 20% uniformly starting from May 1st. Fourteen provisional measures for the price increase have been drafted and notified by the Transportation Department to all sections and stations for implementation. They are transcribed as follows: (1) The fare increase should be 20% on the original price of ordinary passenger tickets. For discounted tickets, the increase should be 20% on the actual amount paid. A stamp of "Price Increase 20%" should be added to the ticket. Luggage, parcels, vehicles, livestock, express trains, sleeper berths, platform tickets, postal delivery and storage fees, vehicle rental fees, and miscellaneous income will not be increased. (2) The 20% fare increase should be calculated to the nearest cent. If the fraction is less than one cent, it should be rounded up to one cent. However, for supplementary tickets, the minimum is five cents, so if it is less than five cents, five cents should be charged, and if it is less than one dime, one dime should be charged. (3) For season tickets and return tickets, the price increase should be collected in one payment at the time of sale and stamped. (4) For round-trip tickets, the price increase for both journeys should be collected by the departure station in one payment. (5) For those traveling without a ticket or exceeding the class or station, a 20% increase should be added to the supplementary ticket price. The penalty should be calculated together with the price increase and clearly stated on the ticket. (6) For through tickets, only the fare due to this railway should be increased by 20% and stamped. If the other railway has not collected the 20% increase, it should be collected by the connecting station. If there is an omission, the ticket inspector on the train should collect it, issuing a supplementary ticket for proof. (7) The Department will print an express train price increase table and distribute it to all stations. When selling first and second-class express train tickets, the ordinary fare should be increased by 20%, and then the express train fare should be added. The ticket should be stamped with both "Passenger Ticket Price Increase 20%" and "Express Train Fee Not Increased." (8) For ordinary freight, the rate should be calculated first, and then 20% should be added to the freight amount due. For special freight, the freight discount should be calculated first, then the freight amount due should be calculated by the ton, and then 20% should be added. The freight bills must be filled out separately for verification and stamped with a 20% price increase. Livestock, boats, sedan chairs, gold ingots, silver ingots, bank notes, locomotives, empty vehicles, delayed storage, shunting fees, and special line maintenance fees will not be increased. (9) The 20% freight increase should be calculated in cents. If the fraction is less than one cent, it should be rounded up to one cent. (10) The 20% price increase for freight bills payable and freight bills on account should be calculated and filled out by the departure station for verification by the arrival station and the accounting office. (11) When the freight on the freight bill needs to be corrected according to regulations, the price increase should be corrected accordingly. If there is a penalty, it should be calculated together with the price increase and filled out separately in the correction letter for verification. (12) For the price increase of through freight, the railway of origin should collect the increased freight of 20%. Freight coming in from other railways, should have the arriving station collect the amount of 20%. All increases should be noted on the freight bill. (13) If there are any omissions in the collection of this price increase, whether on the train or at the station, they should be made up according to regulations. (14) These measures will be abolished when the new freight rate table, which increases the freight rate by 20%, is produced and new tickets are issued to all stations for implementation.

<h3 id="e105">Hubei Troops Encircle He Long's Remnants <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Fan's Division Clears Out the Remaining Bandits of Cheng Kechun</p>
<p>Ji's Division Has Recaptured the Bandit Stronghold of Qiliping</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After He Long's remnant bandits fled from Ziyou Donggong City to Xiaojia Weir and Xuejiaping, the bandit stronghold of Donggong City was recovered by Guo Xun's forces. Guo Xun's forces then advanced from Donggong City towards Xiaojia Weir and Xuejiaping. The 48th Division of Xu Yuanquan's forces dispatched two regiments, led by Li and Fu, from Nanqiao and Xujiaji, while the 51st Division of Fan Shisheng's forces also dispatched three regiments, led by Cao, Wang, and Chen, from Liujiaji and Lijia Dang, to encircle and suppress the bandit area. He Long's bandits, having suffered repeated heavy blows, have no more than four or five thousand remnants, with only one or two thousand firearms. They are currently trapped there, with depleted food and no reinforcements. Their annihilation is not far off. For ease of command, the Wuhan Headquarters has ordered Guo Xun to be responsible for command and set a deadline for clearing out the remaining bandits. Furthermore, Guo's forces have recovered Donggong City with great merit, and Guo was specially commended by telegram on the 2nd, stating, "The officers and soldiers of your unit have worked hard and achieved repeated victories. I hope you will take advantage of the victory and pursue the enemy to achieve the effect of total annihilation. I also hope you will boost morale and capture He Long alive to eliminate this great evil." Previously, the forces of Cheng Kechun in northern Hubei were defeated by the 51st Division of Fan Shisheng's forces, and the bandit leader Cheng Kechun was killed. The bandits scattered. Recently, Fan's division has repeatedly uncovered Red bandit organizations in Zaoyang and Zhangjiawan, and the important criminals captured have been executed. Yesterday, on the 2nd, the chief of staff of the division, Ding Teng, telegraphed the Wuhan Headquarters to report, stating, "According to surrendered Red bandits Lu Shishun and Fu Liangnu, after the Red bandit leader Cheng Kechun of Zaoyang was reported to have died of serious injuries, the bandit forces greatly decreased. According to the bandit's recent plan, about two to three hundred firearms from Xiangfan will be led by Zhao Ying to concentrate at Zhushipu in Xiang County to respond to He Long. I have taken precautions in advance and repeatedly uncovered Red Party organizations in Zaocheng, Zhangjiawan, Dongjinwan, and Zhushipu, and captured more than ten important criminals, including Kang Ciqiao and Jiang Yingjie, all of whom have been executed. Xiang and Zao are now exceptionally stable. Please set your mind at ease." After receiving the telegram, the Wuhan Headquarters replied with an order to continue searching for and suppressing the remaining bandits in order to completely eradicate them.</p>
<p>The bandits in the Henan-Hubei border area were entrenched in Xinjie, Laoshanpo, Bopi River, Qiliping, etc. The Soviet government of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei Special Zone was located in Qiliping. Li Mingzhong, the pacification superintendent of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei border area, supervised and ordered the various units to encircle and suppress the bandits, and they have recovered Xinjie, Laoshanpo, and Bopi River. On the 30th of last month, Ji Hongchang's forces also recovered Qiliping. Ji telegraphed the Wuhan Headquarters yesterday, reporting the recovery of Qiliping, stating, "After my unit engaged the bandits in battle at Tuan Shu Gang, the bandits failed to carry out their plan and were severely attacked by us. The bandits all fled in the southwest direction. This morning, I reorganized my troops and followed up to suppress them. The advance troops reached the high mountains north of Wang Xijiu, and the bandits suddenly surrounded my 88th Brigade. A part of the bandits also attacked our army. In addition to the 88th Brigade fighting bravely, the 92nd Brigade rushed to the rescue, bypassing and occupying the northeastern mountains of Wang Xijiu, and counterattacked the bandits from the rear. The bandits were unable to resist and fought fiercely for three hours. By 1:00 PM, Wang Xijiu was completely occupied. At that time, my 92nd Brigade also arrived, and I ordered the 88th Brigade to continue to suppress the bandits, and the 89th and 91st Brigades to advance from the left and right, and the three brigades attacked Qiliping from all sides. The bandits resisted stubbornly, but Qiliping was completely occupied by my 88th Brigade at 3:00 PM. The remnants of the bandits fled south, and the mountains west of Qiliping were occupied by my 91st Brigade, and the Dongshan was occupied by the 92nd Brigade. Each pursued for more than ten miles. In this battle, more than 3,000 bandits were killed and more than 300 were captured, including many female Red bandits. The 91st Brigade seized four mortars and one mountain gun, and more than a hundred rounds of mortar and mountain gun shells. The 92nd, 88th, and 89th Brigades all obtained a large number of bandit weapons and military supplies. The bandits fled to Xuanhuadian. I am now leading my troops forward to pursue and suppress them. I respectfully submit this report." Furthermore, Li Mingzhong, the pacification superintendent of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei border area, believed that after the recovery of various places, post-war work should be handled urgently. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed the Wuhan Headquarters, requesting that personnel be dispatched quickly to handle it, so that the Party, government, and military could advance simultaneously to maintain security in other areas.

<h3 id="e106">Proposal to Abolish Nanchang City <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Educational Circles Petition for Preservation</p>
<p>Mayor Gong Has Submitted His Resignation</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province has been affected by bandit disasters, with no income. This year, the deficit in government expenses is estimated to be more than 8 million yuan. The Local Reorganization Committee, in order to economize on expenses, concentrate financial resources, and provide sufficient funds for bandit suppression and post-war reconstruction, has adopted a policy of austerity for administrative expenses. Many superfluous agencies have been abolished and merged, such as the Provincial Security Bureau being merged with the Garrison Headquarters, the Entomology Bureau being merged with the Agricultural Experiment Station, and the National Goods Exhibition Hall and the Provincial Autonomous Preparatory Office being abolished. Currently, for the sake of cost-saving, there is a proposal to abolish the Nanchang Municipal Government and have the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction take over its responsibilities. After the municipal elementary schools learned of the Municipal Government's abolition plan, they held an emergency meeting on the 25th at the 24th Elementary School. More than a hundred people attended, including Ouyang Qin. Wang Anbo presided over the meeting, which resolved to submit petitions to the Wuhan Headquarters and the Provincial Government, requesting that the Municipal Government be preserved. More than ten people, including Chen Zubei, were selected as representatives to go to the Wuhan Headquarters and various Party and government agencies to petition. The reasons for their petition are: (1) The city's population is over 200,000, and its direct income accounts for more than half of the city's tax revenue, which is in line with the Municipal Government Organization Law. Therefore, the Municipal Government was approved to be established. (2) The Municipal Government is currently carrying out self-governance, and previous efforts cannot be abandoned. (3) Before the municipal tax was established, the provincial treasury subsidized 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month. Now the Municipal Government's income is sufficient for self-sufficiency, except for major construction projects. (4) Since its establishment, the Municipal Government has created Zhongshan, Yanjiang, Huanhu, Desheng, and other roads, established the Municipal Bank, and resolved labor-capital disputes, all of which benefit the citizens. (5) Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, the number of municipal elementary schools has increased from several to more than forty. Currently, Mayor Gong has submitted his resignation to the Provincial Government and presented eight major reasons, arguing that the Municipal Government cannot be abolished. After receiving the presentation, Chairman Lu personally consoled Gong. As for whether the Municipal Government will exist or not, it will be decided at the Provincial Affairs Conference. According to political sources, Provincial Government Committee member Xiong Yuxi believes that since the establishment of the Nanchang Municipal Government in January 1927, it has achieved considerable results. Although there are financial difficulties now, one cannot choke on food for fear of choking, so he proposed to the Provincial Affairs Conference to maintain the Municipal Government. However, during this time of intense bandit suppression and financial exhaustion, the two bureaus of Public Works and Finance should be temporarily reorganized into sections to economize. It is reported that this case is likely to be passed.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Difficult Financial Situation of Military and Government Expenses in Hunan Province <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>He Jian Hopes for Central Government Subsidies</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The National Assembly representatives from Hunan Province, including Yin Deyang, departed from Changsha by train on the 28th of last month and traveled to Beijing by ship from Hankou on the 29th. He Jian had printed the Fourth Route Army Military Report and the Hunan Provincial Government Political Work Report and sent personnel to Beijing to deliver them to the representatives, who would then distribute them to key figures in the central government and representatives from various provinces, so that they could understand the situation in Hunan Province. At the same time, he sent a written statement on the difficult financial situation of military and government expenses in Hunan Province to the Hunan representatives, asking them to request the central government to find ways to assist Hunan Province's finances. The difficult financial situation of military and government expenses is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e108">(A) Military Expenses Situation <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth Route Army's expenses were previously stipulated by the central government to be paid from the national tax revenue, but due to regional relations, they were all taken from Hunan Province. Hunan Province's national tax revenue was used for military expenses, and years of turmoil have left the people in deep distress. Moreover, the national tax revenue relies entirely on the salt tax, which is now in a state of stretched to the limit. In the era of the 19th Division in 1929, the monthly expenses were more than 220,000 yuan, and the average monthly income was about 200,000 yuan. In 1930, the Fourth Route Army was formed, with four divisions, two independent brigades, and one garrison commander under its command, requiring monthly expenses of 1.2 million yuan. Currently, with five divisions, one garrison commander, and directly subordinate units, the monthly expenses are 1.5 million yuan. Bandit suppression and temporary expenses are not included. However, in 1930, it was still possible to receive more than 700,000 yuan per month. Since this year, only 400,000 yuan per month has been received, which is not even enough to pay for food and medicine. The difference in salary is very large. As a result, the salaries of officers and soldiers have been in arrears for six months, amounting to more than 3 million yuan. At this time, when bandits and communists are rampant and vigorous suppression is being carried out, it is hoped that proper assistance can be arranged.</p>
<h3 id="e109">(B) Political Expense Situation <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Since the political situation in Hunan Province roughly stabilized in 1929, the finances have gradually taken shape. It was originally planned to carry out various important policies during the period of political tutelage in order. Unexpectedly, after the Guilin Army entered Hunan in May of last year, the province suffered the disaster of the Red bandits in July 27th, resulting in huge losses to the finances. Therefore, in the second half of 1930, the province's political expenses were increasingly in a state of great financial difficulty. On New Year's Day in January of this year, the salt tax was abolished, resulting in a loss of 600,000 yuan per month in revenue. Although the central government subsidizes 200,000 yuan per month to support the current situation, all the necessary expenses for bandit suppression, troop pensions and rehabilitation, as well as the construction of fortresses, local security, and the salaries of county militias are all allocated from the aforementioned 200,000 yuan subsidy. It is estimated that as of the end of March of this year, the accumulated arrears in political expenses have reached more than 2 million yuan. It was necessary to drastically reduce various expenses. The total amount of reductions in various items is estimated to be 300,000 yuan for party affairs expenses, 180,000 yuan for provincial government expenses, 360,000 yuan for civil affairs expenses, 670,000 yuan for finance expenses, 430,000 yuan for construction expenses, 200,000 yuan for judicial expenses, and 160,000 yuan for office expenses of various agencies, totaling more than 2.29 million yuan in annual reductions. After offsetting income and expenditure, there is still a shortfall of more than 5 million yuan. Therefore, it is hoped that the central government will provide special assistance to maintain the situation. (May 1st)</p>

<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Northeast Frontier Defense Headquarters is currently being reorganized, abolishing the original three departments of Military Affairs, Military Orders, and Secretariat. The original eight departments under the Military Affairs Department are now under the control of the Chief of Staff and the Secretary-General. All internal staff have been publicly announced by Deputy Commander Zhang before entering customs.

Recently, Deputy Commander Zhang telegraphed from Beijing, appointing many internal staff of the committee and announcing a large number of counselors, most of whom are experts with in-depth military knowledge. At the same time, a Counselor's Office will be organized as the highest advisory body for the committee. The organizational content of the committee is as follows: Chairman: Zhang Xueliang; Committee Members: Zhou Lian, Hu Yukun, Wu Tailai, Qin Hua, Rong Zhen; with Zhou Lian designated as Executive Committee Member; Infantry Group Leader: Gao Yinzhou; Artillery Group Leader: Feng Bingquan; Cavalry Logistics Group Leader: Peng Zhenguo; Technical Group Leader: Guo Erzhen; Education Group Leader: Xu Zuyi; Lieutenant General Counselor: Liu Zhendong; Major General Counselors: Fu Xingfu, Han Yunpeng, Zhang Fu, Wu Mingchen, Jiang Baode, Zhang Silin, Zhang Yingchao, Zhu Lihan.

<p>Departs for Russia from Harbin on May 3rd</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The central government's newly appointed special committee members for the Sino-Soviet Conference, Hu Shize and Qian Tai, and Secretary Lao Weixiu, arrived in Harbin on April 24th. Due to the need to organize their luggage and process their passports, they have delayed their departure until May 3rd, when they will leave the country on the Eurasia train. However, Qian Tai received a telegram from his family on the 28th stating that his father had passed away. After receiving the telegram, Qian telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, requesting a month's leave. He took a train south on the 28th to return to his hometown in Zhejiang to mourn his father. Therefore, only Hu Shize and Lao Weixiu will leave the country on May 3rd. According to Hu Shize, "Our passports have been processed yesterday and we will certainly depart on May 3rd without delay. After arriving in Russia, I don't know which group of committee members I will be responsible for. The Sino-Soviet Conference will hold its fourth meeting on the 21st of this month, with Ambassador Mo and Karakhan discussing the issue of redeeming the Eastern Railway. Whether the trade and re-establishment of diplomatic relations groups will proceed simultaneously with the Eastern Railway group depends on the situation at the time. However, our diplomatic authorities advocate discussing the Eastern Railway first and then discussing trade and re-establishment of diplomatic relations after it is resolved. Ambassador Mo received clear instructions from the central government when he came to Beijing for instructions. The various issues of the Sino-Soviet Conference are still being carried out according to the established policy. China and Russia share a border of more than 10,000 miles, and the relationship is extremely complex. The conference must be conducted meticulously. Therefore, I expect that it will not be possible to reach a decision within a few months. I have lived in Russia for many years in the past, and I am very willing to go to Russia again to conduct practical studies on Russian affairs during the conference. The trade issue is very important. In the future, it must be carried out with special caution. Because Russia is a state-run business, we must stipulate special measures when signing treaties with them, and we cannot compare them with other free trade countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also drafted several measures and will proceed according to the circumstances. As for the details, the Ministry of Industry is currently drafting them. In the future, the Ministry of Industry may send other personnel to Russia." (April 28th)</p>

<p>Losses reach millions or more</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Continuous spring rains in the border area of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong have caused the Han River to rise sharply. Furthermore, due to the winding downstream tributaries and the accumulation of silt, flooding has occurred. After the 22nd, the weather began to clear. Letters and telegrams from various counties reporting the disaster and requesting relief flooded in. By the 26th, the river had receded. The wooden floodgates at the east gate of Chaoan were removed, and traffic on the Han River gradually resumed. According to a letter from Xingning County, dozens of embankments in the county have collapsed, and many fields and houses have been submerged. More than 20 shops attached to the city have been washed away, dozens of people have been killed or injured, more than ten ships have capsized, and crop losses exceed 100,000. Towns in Meixian County have also been flooded, with water several feet high on flat ground and up to ten feet in low-lying areas. Agricultural losses are also significant. The losses in Sanheba, Gaobei, and Xianghuang in Dapu are particularly severe. On the 19th and 20th, the northern dike of Chaoan County was in the most danger, with the river only two feet away from the dike surface. Leaks occurred multiple times in Qizhushu and the Memorial Pavilion. Fortunately, the Chaoan County Office and the Dike Defense Office, together with local gentry, patrolled day and night, and disaster was averted. The houses in the sixteen villages of the upper and lower Dengrong districts were completely flooded, and the loss of fields, crops, flowers, and fruits was incalculable. In the Jiangdong district, more than ten zhang of the dike base collapsed. The entire Jiangdong and Yixi districts were flooded, and the accumulated water could not be drained. Furthermore, thirty zhang of the dike collapsed at Datangtou Yutingjiao in Qidu. One hundred li of Longxi, Nanggui, and Tuojiang were also submerged. As for Chenghai, the river dike in the Epu district was washed away by four zhang, and the waves rushed directly onto Changqiao Township, turning it into a deep pool. Dozens of villages in the Yuepu and Longxi districts were affected, and the early rice harvest is hopeless. Furthermore, two sections of the Shicuo Long River dike in the Xiabeng district collapsed, totaling about thirteen zhang. Furthermore, between Liyuzhou Beijizhou and Kandong in the Sanjiao dike, more than twenty zhang collapsed, and the water rushed directly into Yuzhou Township, pouring all the way to Shicuo Long Beijilong Fulong Outing Dongdun Jinsha, reaching the outskirts of Shantou. Hundreds of li of rice fields have turned into lakes. The Shantou-Chenghai light rail has completely stopped. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented, and the losses are estimated at millions or more. (27th)</p>

<p>More than ten thousand mu of embanked fields are submerged</p>
<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: This year's Yangtze River tide is exceptionally high. In addition, the southeast wind has been strong in recent days, and the river tide has directly impacted the north bank, making the situation even more severe. At 9:00 AM today, the river dike between the five embankments and the four embankments on the opposite bank of Zhenjiang suddenly collapsed. In an instant, the area from the riverbank to Hongqiao Town became a watery land. The submerged area is more than five square li, and the submerged fields and crops are about ten thousand mu. About two thousand houses and countless livestock were affected. Fortunately, the breach occurred during the day, and many people climbed onto trees, so there were few deaths. There are more households in the western part of the embankment than in the eastern part. Fortunately, there is a long-distance highway in between, and the water did not flood in; otherwise, the losses would have been even greater. It is reported that various charitable authorities in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, led by the Red Swastika Society, have purchased dry food and mobilized river boats to provide free crossings and rush to the disaster area to provide emergency relief and rescue the victims. However, the sky is still overcast, and the wind is increasing. It is still unknown whether other dikes will continue to collapse. (4th)</p>

<p>Wang Shen, a woman from Maojia City, Shatou, was seduced into adultery by the rogue Zhang Deqing in her hometown and was then deceived into coming to this county. Fortunately, she met Wang, a woman from her hometown, who recounted her past and recommended her to work for the Hu family on South Street. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, Wang Shen went out for business and met Zhang on the road, who forced Wang to go to Shanghai. Xu Kuiyuan, the guard on duty, noticed that the two were suspicious, and went forward to question them, but they were evasive. They were immediately taken to the station, where the director Qin Jieren interrogated them. According to Wang Shen, she had never met Zhang before and was seduced by his sweet words, resulting in her being raped by Zhang for one night at the Shatou Hotel and then deceived into coming to this county. Zhang Deqing's confession was very cunning. Director Qin, based on the confession, considered the matter to involve adultery and abduction and immediately prepared a document to present Zhang Deqing to the county government for legal action.</p>

Until July of last year, Zhu Linru returned to Shanghai from Jiangbei, and Shen could not frequently meet with Jiang. Therefore, on the third day of the eleventh lunar month, Shen invited Zhang Qiao and others to Zhu Linru's house and lured Zhu to a remote place across from Tiantong Middle School on Disingway Road, where they used an ax to kill Zhu. Later, the Public Security Bureau captured Shen and sent him to the local court. On March 30th of this year, he was sentenced to death. Shen refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to appeal to the High Court. After approval by the Shanghai District Court, police were ordered to escort him to Suzhou yesterday (the 4th) and send him to the High Court, where he was sent to a detention center to await trial.</p>

At this time, the nearby villagers gathered when they heard the gunshots and immediately chased after the bandits, killing one bandit and wounding seven or eight. They also cut off the head of the slain bandit, and the body was taken away by his accomplices.

<p>The Jiuqu River in the northern township has not been dredged for many years and has gradually become silted up. Previously, the Twelfth District Office, together with local people, organized a dredging committee, which was building dams and recruiting labor for dredging in sections. Due to continuous spring rains and mountain floods, the farmland around Blackwood Bridge was flooded and damaged, and the harvest was hopeless. More than a thousand farmers immediately gathered and petitioned the district office to open the dam, but their request was not granted. As a result, the district office and the section chief's house were destroyed. Upon hearing the news, the county government, as it was Labor Day, feared that thugs would take the opportunity to cause trouble and consulted with the Danyang Gendarmerie Company and the police team stationed in Danyang and dispatched teams to the countryside for prevention and to maintain order.</p>

<p>The Datong Transportation Company of Gaoyou had a barge from Huo to You carrying sixty male and female passengers. At 8:00 AM on April 30th, when it arrived at Zhaoguanwei, it was drizzling and could not proceed, so it docked at the pier in front of the Tonghuquan Tea House in the town. The barge boss, Yao Demei, saw that one of the young women was somewhat beautiful and was driven by lust. He led his son Mu Xi and sailors Zhu Wenzhong, Zhou Zhengfu, and Zhou Tingchao to lure the woman into the cabin under the pretext of avoiding the rain, and arbitrarily teased her, intending to rape her. At that time, passengers Cha Tinghua and Yang Xijiu and others interfered, saying that they should not tease a good woman. The barge boss and others refused to obey, and then used this as an excuse to break Cha Tinghua's head, causing him to bleed profusely.

<p>Matsunaka's Disappointing Performance</p>
<p>After Matsunaka decisively broke through and moved into the enemy's capital, the group thought that victory was within reach.  However, yesterday's performance was disappointing, with Zhou Heming making very few contributions, which was unexpected.</p>
<p>The Competition Process</p>
<p>Initially, the two teams competed fiercely, with the scores very close, such as eight to eight or ten to ten. Unfortunately, Matsunaka suffered consecutive defeats afterward, which was a key factor in their failure. The score at halftime was eighteen to ten.  Later, there was a struggle at one point, with the score difference only two points. However, they failed to seize the ball and wasted several minutes. Unable to recover, they ultimately lost with a score of twenty-eight to twenty-six.</p>

<p>The tournament has concluded, and male and female athletes from various schools originally planned to visit scenic spots to relieve the fatigue of several days of intense competition. However, the weather did not cooperate. Last night, the rain came down heavily, making the roads muddy. The athletes' interest was greatly reduced. It is reported that they have packed their bags and will depart for home today.</p>

<p>One to Zero Victory over Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Middle School</p>
<p>(Yesterday, the 4th) At 1:00 PM, the soccer final between Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Middle School and Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Middle School took place. The result was one to zero, with Nanjing Middle School winning the championship. The referee was Tang Zhongguang, and the linesmen were He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang.</p>
<p>The Weather Turns Unfavorable</p>
<p>At that time, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and the wind was very strong. As soon as the game started, the rain poured down. The soccer skills of both schools are among the best in the province. Despite the unfavorable weather, the game was quite lively.</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Wind, Missing Opportunities</p>
<p>After selecting the venue and starting the game, Suzhou Middle School had the advantage of the tailwind, making it easier to attack. Nanjing Middle School, facing the headwind, found it difficult to send the ball into the opponent's zone. Sometimes, the wind blew the ball back, creating dangerous situations. Suzhou Middle School had several scoring opportunities, but they all missed them. Nanjing Middle School tried to defend and withstand the critical situation.</p>
<p>Switching Sides to Fight Again</p>
<p>Nanjing Middle School survived the difficult period without any mistakes. Everyone celebrated. After switching sides, Nanjing Middle School took advantage of the tailwind and switched from defense to offense. The ball often lingered in Suzhou Middle School's zone. Lu Yaxiong, a famous sprinter from Suzhou Middle School, switched from center back to inside defender and repeatedly saved dangerous balls. His contributions were significant.</p>
<p>Touching the Post and Going into the Net</p>
<p>About twenty minutes into the game, neither side had scored. Chen Hongqi, the right forward of Nanjing Middle School, shot fiercely at the goal from about ten yards in front of Suzhou's goal. Xu Yuwen tried to push the ball out of bounds with both hands. Who knew that it would hit the goalpost and bounce strongly into the net?</p>
<p>Trying to Counterattack</p>
<p>After Suzhou Middle School conceded a goal, all the players were motivated and tried to counterattack in order to win the championship. Their left and right wings had two excellent crosses with perfect landing points. Unfortunately, the forwards moved too slowly and missed the opportunities. Moreover, the heavy rain continued, the field was muddy, and the ball became heavier due to the water, making it extremely difficult to play.</p>
<p>The Whistle Blows to End the Game</p>
<p>At exactly 3:00 PM, the time was up, and the referee blew the whistle to end the game. Suzhou Middle School unfortunately suffered a crushing defeat by one to zero. Nanjing Middle School also won the tournament's soccer championship with this precious goal. The team lineups for both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing Middle School Lineup</p>
<p>Gong Jialu</p>
<p>Zhan Wenzhuo, Gao Yiping</p>
<p>Yang Gongping, Yang Youmei, Jiao Zongling</p>

<p>Two to Zero Victory over Jiangsu Provincial Nantong Middle School</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 4th, the tennis final between Nanjing Provincial Middle School and Nantong Provincial Middle School was held. Nanjing Middle School won both singles matches and thus won the championship. The referees were Jin Zhaojun and He Chunbi.</p>
<p>(1) Deng Rongling (Nanjing Middle School) defeated Wang Jiayou (Nantong Middle School)</p>
<p>Six to Three, Six to Three</p>
<p>(2) Zhu Huanjiu (Nanjing Middle School) defeated Mao Fukui (Nantong Middle School)</p>
<p>Six to Four, Four to Six, Six to Two</p>
<p>Nanjing Middle School has almost always won the tournament tennis championship in the past. Last year, Dongwu University participated in the amateur competition, and facing strong opponents, they suffered a crushing defeat. This year, they had a smooth journey, did not encounter any opponents, and won the championship easily.</p>
<p>[Image: Viewing the Nanjing Middle School team that won the men's volleyball championship (photographed by this newspaper)]</p>
<p>In yesterday's match, Deng and Zhu, the two players from Nanjing Middle School, both won by being steady, combining powerful and skillful shots, and never overdoing it. Wang and Mao, the two players from Nantong Middle School, were also skilled, but Wang's serve was weak and was repeatedly taken advantage of by Deng. Mao's attacks were mostly wild balls, and he often had double faults when serving and often hit the net when returning the ball. These were the reasons for their defeat.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wind was very strong, and the ball was unpredictable. Both sides' performances were not very good.</p>
<p>Deng vs. Wang</p>
<p>In the first game, both sides first won three sets each, and then Deng won three consecutive sets, winning the first game. After the start of the second game, the competition was fierce. Deng initially led, then it became three all and four all, and then five all and six all. In the end, Deng won the last two sets, winning two consecutive games.</p>
<p>Zhu vs. Mao</p>
<p>The strength of both sides was equal. Zhu won the first game with a score of six to four. Mao also won the second game with a score of six to four. In the decisive third game, Mao was exhausted and could not defend. Zhu then won the victory with a score of six to two.</p>
<p>Since Nanjing Middle School won both singles matches, the championship was in their hands. The doubles match in the afternoon was not held.</p>

<p>Two to Zero Victory over Shanghai Middle School</p>
<p>The boys' volleyball team of Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Middle School won the championship by defeating the boys' volleyball team of Shanghai Provincial Shanghai Middle School in two consecutive games. The final was held at 9:00 AM yesterday. The referee was Wu Bangwei. Nanjing Middle School served first in the first game and took the initiative with the tailwind, scoring two points first. Shanghai Middle School was unwilling to give in and tied the score at six all. In the first half of the game, Nanjing Middle School took the lead with a score of eleven to seven. In the second half, Shanghai Middle School tried hard to fight back and gradually narrowed the score to seventeen to sixteen, with a difference of only one point. In the end, Shanghai Middle School suffered a crushing defeat in the first game with a difference of two points, with a score of twenty-one to nineteen.</p>
<p>In the first game, Nanjing Middle School's momentum did not diminish, and they won repeatedly. The score in the first half was still eleven to seven. The final score was twenty-one to fourteen. Nanjing Middle School won two consecutive games and won the championship. Nanjing Middle School's volleyball skills are more mature, their attacks are powerful, and their setting and spiking are also skillful. Shanghai Middle School seems to be inferior. However, the south wind was very strong yesterday, making it difficult to play volleyball. Both offense and defense had to be careful at all times.</p>

<p>Two to One Victory over Jingzhi</p>
<p>In the women's volleyball final yesterday, Suzhou Zhenhua Girls' School defeated Wuxi Jingzhi Girls' School by two to one and won the championship. Jingzhi won first and then lost, while Zhenhua became more and more courageous. The performance was excellent. The referee was Huang Wenjian.</p>
<p>The Wind Was Strong and the Ball Flew</p>
<p>The south wind was very strong yesterday, and the volleyball was light, so it flew with the wind. It was even more difficult to serve against the wind, especially in women's volleyball. Therefore, the side with the tailwind won yesterday.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Volleyball Skills</p>
<p>Zhenhua's performance was excellent yesterday. They did not panic after losing first, which was the reason for their victory. In particular, the volleyball skills of Tang Lianjuan, the center back in the first row, were stable and commendable, and she was the most outstanding. Yang Luyi in the second row was also strong. The credit for the championship lies in the cooperation of the entire team. Jingzhi was inferior yesterday and made mistakes from time to time. However, Ni Yunshang and Zhu Huiyang were indeed excellent women's volleyball players.</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Wind to Attack</p>
<p>As the whistle blew to start the game, Jingzhi attacked first with the tailwind. The ball shuttled back and forth over the net. Lu Yingya from Jingzhi set the ball, but it went too far out of bounds. Zhenhua scored the first point and took the lead. Ge Fuming from Zhenhua returned the attack, and Jingzhi also killed the ball, tying the score at one all. Both teams played carefully, and Jingzhi took the lead with a score of eight to six and continued to score. In the first half of the first game, Jingzhi won with a score of eleven to seven.</p>
<p>Trying Hard to Counterattack</p>
<p>After Zhenhua failed in the first game, they were determined and extraordinarily cautious. The wind was also favorable. After a score of eight to five, they won successively, winning the first half of the game with a score of eleven to five. Jingzhi gradually showed panic and made mistakes from time to time, while Zhenhua's connection was excellent, especially Tang Lianjuan, the center back in the first row, who was the most outstanding. Her counterattacks and smashes were perfect. As a result, they won back one game with a score of twenty-one to fifteen, tying the score at one to one. Everyone was delighted.</p>
<p>The Outcome Was Decided in the Third Game</p>
<p>The outcome was decided in the third game. The atmosphere was tense, and shouts rose from time to time. Beautiful songs were frequently sent to the ears. Jingzhi initially seemed to have the upper hand. Zhang Zhiyuan served and took the lead with a score of eight to six. However, Yang Luyi also scored two points, tying the score at eight all. Jingzhi had the tailwind. In the first half of the game, they took the lead with a score of eleven to eight. After switching sides, the competition between the two teams was extremely fierce. The score difference was only one or two points, and even reached eighteen all. Then, at nineteen to nineteen, Jingzhi made another mistake, letting each other make mistakes, and ultimately failed. The score was twenty-one to nineteen. As a result, Zhenhua won the championship with joy, with a score of two to one.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Victory over Songjiang Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>Twenty-Six to Twenty-Two</p>
<p>Suzhou Girls' Middle School won the women's basketball championship. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, they defeated Songjiang Girls' Middle School by twenty-six to twenty-two in the final. The referee was Shao Ji.</p>
<p>Two Excellent Athletes</p>
<p>Before describing the match, Guan Yi first introduced two excellent athletes, namely Zhang Yingfen, the center of Suzhou Girls' Middle School, and Xu Jinzhu, the center of Songjiang Girls' Middle School. They were quick on their feet, ran fast, and threw accurately. They could also command. Miss Zhang was even better. Her throws were always accurate. Yesterday, she scored twenty-two points out of the team's total of twenty-six points. Miss Xu was closely guarded by Wang Liangyu, making it difficult for her to move freely. She looked very disappointed.</p>
<p>The Skills of the Two Teams</p>
<p>The forwards of Suzhou Girls' Middle School cooperated very well and showed great skill. They were worthy of being the championship team. The guards Wang and Yao did not let their guard down at all and were also contributors. The forwards of Songjiang Girls' Middle School were also good, but their guards were weaker. However, Zhang Yingfen was definitely not someone who could be guarded by ordinary people. Both teams often charged forward with the ball and did not know how to turn around when blocked. This was a major problem that should be corrected.</p>
<p>The Match Situation</p>
<p>After Zhang Yingfen of Suzhou Girls' Middle School opened the scoring, they won successively, scoring seven points. Xu Jinzhu of Songjiang Girls' Middle School then opened the scoring. Suzhou Girls' Middle School took the lead all the way. The score at halftime was seventeen to eight. In the last eight minutes, Songjiang Girls' Middle School tried their best to counterattack and came closer, but ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Celebrating Victory</p>
<p>After Nanjing Middle School won the volleyball and tennis finals, they won two championships and cheered with joy. All the athletes paraded around the field with firecrackers and school flags, and the cheers were thunderous. The losers were so angry that they were silent. Not rejoicing in victory and not worrying about defeat, this kind of cultivation is rare. However, the courage of the benevolent is something that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Peddlers Wandering Around</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sky was cloudy, and the southeast wind was strong. There were only ball games in the morning, and not many spectators came to the venue. It rained again in the afternoon. The business of ordinary peddlers was several times better in the previous three days. Yesterday, they suffered a big loss. In particular, those selling fruit had no customers. The sound of people shouting "sugarcane" and "bananas" could be heard everywhere.</p>
<p>Gifts from This Newspaper</p>
<p>This newspaper specially prepared two large flags for this tournament and gave them to the men's field championship team and the women's track and field championship team. They were now won by Suzhou Middle School and Yangzhou Middle School for Girls.</p>

<p>Neighbor's Sigh</p>
<p>By Ke Dingan</p>
<p>The theory of equality between men's rights and women's rights has been widely discussed recently. However, it is merely a hollow claim without any practical implementation. A certain Mr. Jia next door works for the local electric power company. His wife, Ms. Mou, is known for her virtue. They have one son and one daughter. The son is five years old and the daughter is three years old. Usually, the relationship between the couple is very harmonious. On holidays, they often go out together, talking and laughing, and their happiness knows no bounds. People in the same neighborhood admire their affection and happiness. Unexpected events often occur that others cannot predict, and I will now describe one of them.</p>
<p>In recent months, Mr. Jia has suddenly changed his normal behavior. Usually, he would return home at 5:00 PM every day after finishing work at the company to enjoy family time. His wife would prepare meals with great care and diligence. This is indeed a happy thing in life. However, in recent months, Mr. Jia has often not returned home late at night, and even when he did return, it was at the crack of dawn. He also often quarreled with his wife over trivial matters. She still feared that he was being mistreated outside, so she swallowed her anger and resentment and spoke kindly in an attempt to restore their original harmony. Unexpectedly, she incurred his anger, abuse, and wild cursing. She endured it and remained silent. This went on for many days. She suddenly heard people say that her husband had found someone else outside. She was saddened when she heard this, but did not deeply believe it at first. However, considering the situation, it seemed to be true. If he cherished the new and abandoned the old, then she would be alone and helpless. What would she rely on for her future life? Worries piled up, and she became very haggard.</p>
<p>One day, a green-clad postman delivered a letter. Her name was written on the envelope. It was received by her mother-in-law, who also knew a little about her. Knowing that it was written by a man, she secretly kept it and did not give it to her. She waited for Mr. Jia to return and secretly read it with him. As expected, it was sent by another man to his wife. Mr. Jia was extremely angry. He secretly regretted that he had no grounds to pursue the matter. Now that he had this letter, he could get his wish. While Mr. Jia and his mother were reading the letter, she was preparing the meal, not knowing anything about it at first. Mr. Jia quickly rushed into the kitchen, grabbed his wife's hair, dragged her out, and punched and kicked her. Her mother-in-law stood by and watched, adding fuel to the fire. When Mr. Jia was exhausted, he finally stopped. His wife was exhausted and hoarse, lying on the ground and unable to get up. She still did not know how she had offended her husband. While she was thinking, Mr. Jia threw the letter on the ground and said, "No wonder your attitude has been so strange recently. So that's what's going on." Then he laughed coldly. She looked at the letter and knew that it was sent by a boyfriend from before she was married. The letter was just a greeting and did not involve any obscene content. The reason for his offense was because of this. However, she had no strength to defend herself. After that, Mr. Jia confined her to a room. I often heard her crying softly when I woke up in the middle of the night. Her voice was so sad that I couldn't bear to listen. My room is relatively close to hers, so I heard it very sadly. In civilized Shanghai, this is what is meant by equality between men and women. Alas.</p>
<p>How to Enhance Marital Bliss</p>
<p>By Chen Yuanliang</p>
<p>Marital bliss is the key to lifelong happiness. Otherwise, even if they appear to be compatible, they are actually alienated. Even if they have not officially separated, they are forced to live together, which is completely devoid of joy. People in Europe and America have extensively studied the issue of marriage. Recently, I read an article written by a certain gentleman in the Japanese magazine "Women's World" in Tokyo. I feel that he is very considerate and his words are very pertinent. I have translated it as follows:</p>
<p>The author believes that the organization of a family is purely based on love. If you can diligently care for it, love can be maintained. The rules to be followed by husbands are divided into eleven items, roughly divided into habits, jealousy, finance, holidays, health, clothing, diet, children, and household affairs. The following are several items that husbands should not do:</p>
<p>(1) Do not let cigarette ashes fall on the floor when you are relaxing at home. (Japanese people sit on the floor.) This will cause your wife to have to do more work.</p>
<p>(2) Treat each other like guests. Respect each other for a long time. Do not immediately undress during meals because you are afraid of the heat.</p>
<p>(3) Do not immediately complain to her if you feel unwell or slightly uncomfortable. She is already tired enough from managing the household.</p>
<p>(4) Do not use unclean handkerchiefs in front of others. This will cause others to despise her occasional negligence.</p>
<p>(5) Avoid boredom in ordinary life. You should often tell stories and interesting anecdotes to make her laugh.</p>
<p>(6) When her face is charming, you should praise her beauty. If she looks unhappy, you should be even more gentle and comforting.</p>
<p>(7) Those who criticize their wives in front of others because their ties are not changed or their shoes are not polished will never have a perfect family.</p>
<p>(8) Even if you are reluctant, you must accompany her to the mall when she wants you to. On the way back, you can go to a cafe together for tea and a rest.</p>
<p>(9) You must seek her opinion on everything. Although her opinion may not be correct, it is not necessarily wrong.</p>
<p>(10) Men who are married should not be too reserved. Otherwise, they will be like wood and stone, and there will be no interest in them.</p>
<p>(11) Love should be expressed. You should frankly call her "my love" or "I love you." Since you have been married for a long time, you don't need to be shy like on the night of your honeymoon.</p>
<p>(12) There are roughly two types of female beauty: healthy beauty and spiritual beauty. If your wife possesses one of these two, you should try your best to praise her characteristics so that she knows that you have already appreciated her true interest.</p>
<p>(13) If you feel bad, you should remain calm and not get angry easily. You should especially avoid the bad habits of slamming bowls and hitting tables.</p>
<p>(14) You should often be close to your wife's family. Do not prevent her from returning to her parents' home. When you meet again after a short separation, it will increase the taste of love. However, love is best when it lasts for a long time. Use it sparingly. If it is too strong during the honeymoon, it will inevitably decline after a long time.</p>
<p>(15) Do not boast about your income in front of your wife. Do not miss the opportunity. Do not lie. Do not forget her birthday. You should celebrate it to commemorate it.</p>
<p>(16) If you find that a button is missing and not sewn on her clothes, do not immediately say harsh words, which may cause misunderstandings.</p>
<p>(17) When questioning your wife, do not raise your voice. Prevent neighbors, servants, and children from knowing about it. It is related to her dignity.</p>
<p>(18) Do not say in front of your children that they would starve to death without you. You must have fun with them so that they always have a lovable father in their hearts.</p>
<p>(19) You should introduce your female friends when you meet them on the road. Otherwise, it will easily arouse suspicion and cause jealousy.</p>
<p>(20) You should explain the meaning of how difficult it is to earn money and how easy it is to spend it. Advise her to save money. Explore its use, but do not act like a miser.</p>
<p>(21) Do not move the furniture in the house without permission. It will disrupt its order.</p>
<p>(22) If you are not satisfied with the clothes your wife makes, you should not criticize them as much as possible. You should forgive her for having exhausted her efforts.</p>
<p>(23) If you are away from home for a short time, you should frequently send letters to report on your trip. Although the price of a small postcard is not much, your wife will be able to break the lonely air of the boudoir when she sees the words "you are safe."</p>
<p>Mei's Southern News</p>
<p>By Zhi</p>
<p>Mei Wan Hua and his party were recently invited to perform in Hong Kong and Guangdong. They will use their latest research results to consult with people in the south. They have already been reported to have traveled south from Shanghai. Here is a summary of their activities after arriving in Guangdong for the information of those who are interested.</p>
<p>On the 20th, the Taiyo Maru arrived in Hong Kong. On the 22nd, they transferred from Macau to Zhongshan County and visited Mr. Tang Shaochuan. They had a long conversation and went to Cuiheng Village to visit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's former residence and laid a wreath. On the 23rd, they returned to Macau and accompanied Minister Liu Yulin to the Governor of Macau's tea party. At 2:30 PM on the 25th, they arrived in Guangzhou by the Foshan round. Many people came to the round to welcome them. Deng Sixiao, the personal secretary of Chairman Chen, represented the welcome and shook hands with Wan Hua. After landing, Chairman Chen and Commander-in-Chief Chen hosted a banquet at Tuisi Garden. When they landed, thousands of people watched.</p>
<p>After Wan landed, he attended a welcome party at the East Asia Hotel. This party was jointly organized by the Bahe Guild Hall, the Lawyers' Association, the Nanyang Tobacco Company, and the Haizhu Theater. Mr. Tao Junan accompanied them. The representative of the Lawyers' Association delivered a welcome speech. Wan gave a reply speech, which was translated into Cantonese by Mr. Tao Jun. The guests applauded.</p>
<p>After leaving the welcome party, they went to visit Chairman Chen at his private residence and had a long conversation. They continued to visit Commander-in-Chief Chen, but he was going to Yantang to review the troops and did not have time to meet. At 6:00 PM, they attended Tuisi Garden. Wan Hua wore a night dress. The guests and hosts were happy. Commander-in-Chief Chen also sent a large horizontal plaque.</p>
<p>The first performance was on the 29th. The headquarters reserved many seats, all vying to enjoy the artistic drama of China. The first night was Xi Shi, the second night was The Legend of Taizhen, the third night was Farewell My Concubine, the fourth night was The Legend of Taizhen, the fifth night was Farewell My Concubine, and the sixth night was Luo Shen. This was the scheduled repertoire, which was also requested by various circles in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Indian Travel Notes (43)</p>
<p>By Linghua</p>
<p>On the 27th, the Krishna Society invited me to dinner. This temple is very large, about half a mile. The buildings are Western-style and very clean. There are 200 monks and they also support the poor. Men and women work. The food is very rich, about 20 dishes. The Indian cuisine is also no worse than Chinese food. Some tastes may be better than Chinese food, but they are very different. The Indian way of eating is different from Chinese food. The so-called 20 dishes are eaten by one person, divided and not shared. Half of it is similar to Western food. When I eat at Indian people's places, I pay attention to how much I eat. If one person eats 120 dishes, it is only a waste of resources. What are they? Indian people have strange customs. All food that has been eaten by others, no matter how much, is discarded. You are not allowed to eat other people's food. It has become a religious superstition. You don't drink people's tea, and people are not allowed to drink it. You don't touch people. The reason is due to the class system. I still don't understand the rules of communication. In short, there are many conditions for giving people food. There are also many conditions for people to eat with them. It makes our heads dizzy. If someone accidentally drinks someone else's tea, or gives people tea and food, or eats with others, they violate the rules. Therefore, when Gandhi went to England to study, his family punished him because he had to eat with the British. It is also a violation of the rules to marry a foreigner. The obstacles are indescribable.</p>
<p>As for the taste of the food, it is purely vegetarian, with many fragrant flowers, sweet and crispy foods, and milk. Milk has many variations, about 20 kinds. All five original substances of milk, sugar, oil, flowers, and fruits are common foods for Indian people. There are flowers in all seasons, and fruits and vegetables are fragrant. Therefore, the vegetarian food tastes very good. However, the sweetness is too great, and we cannot eat the Indian bananas. Today, the world's food taste evaluation is still the Chinese as the first. However, I think that the good Indian food is definitely no worse than Chinese food. As for Indian food, lunch is rice and dinner is noodles, which is the norm. I will give a lecture at the Theosophical Society. The Krishna Society is typing my lecture manuscript with a typewriter. Their monks generally use English. This Indian church is all over India, and also in Europe and America. As for their funds, they are all donated from the United States. Without the United States, there would be no sponsors in the world today.</p>
<p>On the 28th, at 6:00 PM, I gave a lecture at the Theosophical Society. Mr. Wu Tingfang, a late friend, was once a member of this society. It exists in all countries around the world. The president is a woman. Dr. Besant is 84 years old this year. She has founded many universities and charities. Some say that she has supernatural powers, but I don't know. The topic of the lecture was why children cry, it is because they miss their mothers. There were four or five hundred listeners. Some held oil and wiped my head, which is an Indian custom. The main purpose of my lecture was the world's anti-war movement. Motherhood must be used. The result was to achieve Sun Yat-sen's Datong Doctrine. All the British and Indian newspapers published the lecture manuscript that night. It will be published in the society's January report, saying that it will reach 47 countries around the world. There are hundreds of local branches in India. In this society, I met many men and women from all over the world. The farthest ones were from Australia and New Zealand. There were also people from various Islamic countries, which was very rare.</p>

<p>By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>(2) Inexplicable</p>
<p>Just then, I suddenly felt a light tap on my left shoulder. At the same time, a fragrance hit my nostrils. I immediately stopped and turned my head, face to face with that friend in a suit. I didn't know him, nor did I know what he meant. I was about to ask a question when the man suddenly made an unexpected move. His right hand reached into his outer jacket pocket and shoved something white into my left hand. Then he released his foot and hurried forward.</p>
<p>I was stunned for a moment. Originally, this move completely exceeded my expectations. Although my right hand had touched the gun handle, it was inconvenient to fire it randomly. Because I didn't know what was in my left hand. My fingers naturally squeezed it, but it was a small white towel. In this squeezing movement, there were still some subtle rubbing sounds. Strange. What is this? The small bag was not heavy and didn't look like a dangerous item. At this time, my reason instructed me. The first step should be to see what was in the bag. So my right hand immediately released the gun handle and quickly opened the bag. It was a fine white gauze scarf with folded edges all around. It had been ironed and had a strong fragrance. Fortunately, this small bag was rolled up and not knotted. I had already unfolded it in two or three seconds. But after unfolding it, my eyes came into contact with the contents of the bag, and this shock was extraordinary. It turned out that the white towel contained a string of brightly glittering pearl necklaces.</p>
<p>I seemed to have entered a dream. A surprised exclamation came out of my throat automatically. The cigarette in my mouth also fell to the ground at once. I seemed to</p>

<p>Mrs. Chen Hexian Awards Prizes</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM on the fourth day, the grand closing ceremony was held. All schools lined up in front of the command post. Mr. Chen Hexian, the vice president of the conference, delivered the closing remarks, stating that the various achievements of this session were better compared to previous sessions, and many new records were discovered. This was the result of the hard work of all students, as well as the attention of various schools to sports and the promotion of society. He hoped for even better results next year, and also hoped that those who won national championships would not be complacent and should continue to work hard, not only to win national championships, but also to compete on the world sports stage. He told those who did not win championships not to be discouraged, as failure is the mother of success. As long as they work hard, it will not be difficult to win championships next year. Then, the General Secretary Wu Bangwei reported the results of various competitions, saying that the results were greatly affected by the wind during the conference, but we acknowledge that the results of this session are very good, and the sportsmanship of the athletes is also very good. There were never any disputes in the various competitions of this session. He hoped that next year there would be better results than this year. Finally, Mrs. Zhao Lingxian, the wife of Chen Hexian, awarded the prizes. The male overall championship winner received a large silver trophy from Zhang Xueliang's Executive Yuan, etc. The female overall championship winner received a flag and silver shield from President Chiang Kai-shek and Director Chen, etc. The field event championship winner received a silver shield from He Yingqin, Dai Chuanxian, etc. The track event championship winner received a silver shield from the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Interior, etc. The winners of the various ball game championships and the track and field events were awarded silver shields, prize flags, "The Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen," and medals. There were four types of medals: gold medals for first place, silver medals for second place, bronze medals for third place, and copper medals for fourth place.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Competition in Wind and Rain <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the conference. The southeast wind was even stronger, and the sky was covered with dark clouds, unlike the bright and beautiful scenes of the previous days. The wind was wild and the ground was vast, making the dust even more noticeable. There were not many scattered spectators at the two venues yesterday morning. As the afternoon progressed, the wind grew stronger, the clouds grew thicker, and there was a hint of rain. Sure enough, the ball field was not opened in the afternoon, and rain began to fall from the sky. The atmosphere in the field became even more tense. In the afternoon, basketball and football were played entirely in the heavy rain. Ball games were already difficult due to the wind, and the rain made it even more difficult for the athletes to fight. Only a few spectators were present, which was a bit disappointing. At 3:00 PM, the ball games ended, and the military band played triumphant music as everyone returned. Vice President Chen was very enthusiastic about promoting sports. Despite the strong wind, he still went to the venue with his wife and son to watch. He stood briefly at the ball field and expressed his admiration for the spirit of the players at the most exciting moments. Field Director Wu, Chief Referee Zhang, and Ms. Yu Qingtang were busy distributing the prizes, and it seemed that they were also very hesitant in weighing the importance of each prize.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing High School won the men's team championship at the conference. There were a total of six championships in the men's division, and Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing High School won four, including track, football, volleyball, and tennis, which was very rare and a new record for the conference. At the closing ceremony, firecrackers were set off and military music was played to celebrate their victory.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School for Girls won the women's team overall championship at the conference. The four championships in the women's division were divided among four schools, each winning one. However, Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School for Girls won the track and field championship, so they won the overall championship.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Changes in Women's Overall Championship <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>It is a pity that Suzhou Girls' High School lost</p>
<p>The women's team overall championship has now been won by Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School for Girls, because they won the track and field competition. However, there was a slight change in the process. I will record it to observe the shift in the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e151">A Small Misunderstanding <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>During the semi-finals the day before, the women's volleyball game was between Suzhou Girls' High School and Jingzhi Girls' School, and the women's basketball game was between Suzhou Girls' High School and Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School for Girls. Both were held at 9:00 AM at the same time. The players of Suzhou Girls' High School all had two roles, playing both volleyball and basketball. Therefore, the leaders of Suzhou Girls' High School and Jingzhi Girls' School discussed the day before to hold the volleyball game one hour earlier. However, Jingzhi insisted on holding it at the original time of 9:00 AM, and Shanghai High School for Girls also refused to reschedule the basketball game. Suzhou Girls' High School had no choice but to supplement the two teams with track and field players.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Divided Attention <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Girls' High School was distracted, paying attention to both, and seemed flustered, with the difficulty of not knowing which to follow. They decided to try volleyball first. Zhang Yingfen, a basketball star, played volleyball, but was still thinking about basketball, and her will was not focused, so they lost to Jingzhi. Fortunately, after the volleyball game, she rushed to the rescue and reorganized her team, so they were not defeated.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Clash of Strengths <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Zhen defeated Jingzhi, but Suzhou Zhenhua's results were worse than Suzhou Girls' High School, so Suzhou Girls' High School had the possibility of defeating Jingzhi. If they defeated Jingzhi, then the volleyball championship would be in their hands.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Championship Transfer <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>If the volleyball championship was won by Suzhou Girls' High School, then with the women's basketball championship, the overall championship would also belong to them. Now, because of a misunderstanding, the overall situation has shifted, which is a pity for Suzhou Girls' High School.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Excellent Sportsmanship <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The sportsmanship at the conference on the fourth day was excellent. The winners were not arrogant, and the losers were not discouraged. During the ball games, both the winning and losing teams cheered, and they did not take the championship as the ultimate goal. On the third day, the semi-final ball games had conflicting times, but they were able to sacrifice everything to ensure the smooth progress of the conference, which is especially commendable. The fourth runner of the Suzhou Girls' High School team, the women's 400-meter relay champion, Zhang Maolan, was stepped on by someone's shoe spikes, and blood flowed like a stream, but she still rushed forward and won first place. This kind of spirit must be recorded to tell all athletes.</p>

<p>Shanghai Provincial High School, unexpectedly, defeated Shanghai Provincial Songjiang High School by two points in the heavy rain yesterday and won the championship. Everyone was very happy. The score was 28 to 26. The referee was Du Tingxiu, and the inspector was Feng Jiasheng.</p>

<p>After the women's basketball game, the rain poured down, but since only this one game remained, it was decided to hold it in the rain. The field was covered with sand to reduce slipperiness, but the non-stop rain also reduced interest. Otherwise, this fierce battle would have been even more spectacular.</p>

<p>Chen Xizeng, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordered all district chiefs, considering that May 5th is the anniversary of the leader's inauguration as Extraordinary President and also the anniversary of the National Assembly meeting, and schools and factories are all on vacation, the number of tourists in various places will inevitably increase. He ordered his subordinates to carefully increase protection at that time to maintain local security. After receiving the order, the district chiefs immediately informed the heads of the police stations and police officers in their respective jurisdictions to comply with the order. However, along Zhonghua Road and Minguo Road, armed police officers were already dispatched by motorcycle last night to patrol back and forth.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issued a Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Advocates Automatic Abolition</p>
<p>According to news from diplomatic circles in this city, Sino-British legal rights negotiations broke down because the British insisted on maintaining consular jurisdiction for ten years in the ten-mile area centered on the customs in the four commercial ports of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Because the United Kingdom, the United States, and France were not sincere in the legal rights negotiations, our side issued two statements yesterday afternoon to announce to Chinese and foreign people the process of the legal rights negotiations and the issue of responsibility for the breakdown. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Shanghai did not issue any documents on this matter because the information office had already been abolished. However, the Municipal Party Headquarters will have a proposal, which is to request the National Assembly to order the National Government to automatically announce the abolition of all unequal treaties regarding legal rights. It is said that this proposal will be submitted to the Shanghai All Sectors Celebration of the National Assembly Opening Congress held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce this morning for approval, and then telegraphed to the Nanjing National Assembly for discussion and implementation.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from Shanghai on the 4th, the fourth point in the four points proposed by the British and Japanese during the legal rights negotiations issued yesterday had a slight error due to repeated transmission. The original meaning should be "Chinese special courts should try foreign cases with Chinese and foreign judges jointly."</p>

<p>Yu Feipeng Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Minister of Communications Wang Boqun has been ill in Shanghai for more than half a month. He has repeatedly received telegrams from the central government urging him to go to Beijing, but he has been unable to do so due to his illness. In order to understand the truth, a certain gentleman, accompanied by Shuangqingjun of the Eurasia Aviation Company, went to visit Mr. Wang yesterday afternoon to inquire about the truth. The car arrived at Wang's residence at No. 14 Zhangjia Garden Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and a red paper strip was posted next to the door, with the words "The illness has not lessened, the doctor advises rest, it is difficult to see guests, please forgive me." The doorman peered out and only then opened the door. Going upstairs to Wang's bedroom, he saw Wang lying on the couch, covered with quilts, with a thick towel wrapped around his forehead. His appearance was thinner and extremely haggard. He was unable to greet the visitor, and then closed his eyes and went to sleep. It was said that his fever was still 101 degrees, so he was extremely tired. The reporter then withdrew. According to reports, Mr. Wang's illness began on the 15th of last month. At first, his legs were in pain. Because it was an old illness, he did not pay much attention to it. The doctor diagnosed it as a flu. The next day, he developed typhoid fever and intestinal heat. At first, he asked German doctor Dr. Lohr, but now he is being treated by Dr. Xu Shifang, and there are two nurses taking turns to take care of him day and night. Last week, he received a telegram from the central government urging him to go to Beijing immediately, and he had prepared a ship on the evening of one day, but unexpectedly his fever rose to 103 degrees on the morning of the second day, so he could not go. Yesterday, he also received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications, reporting that He Yingqin had already taken a warship from Nanchang to the north, and it was expected that he would arrive in Beijing yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Also, Minister Wang received a telegram from President Chiang Kai-shek of Nanjing three days ago, which read: "Minister Wang Boqun brother Jian, I heard that you have typhoid fever and have not recovered, I am very concerned. Please rest in peace, and if you recover slightly, please attend the National Assembly, Zheng Zhong Jiang Yin. Deputy Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng also came to Shanghai yesterday to inquire about Mr. Wang's illness."</p>

<p>The National Medical Association held its ninth executive committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Xu Naili presided over the meeting to discuss one item, reading the resolutions of the previous temporary executive committee meeting on March 8; one item, reporting that the Hangzhou new drug business tax had been revised by the authorities of that province, and the document that the association had intended to submit to the Ministry of Finance had not been issued and had been filed for future reference; one item, the Wuhan Medical Association and the Wujin Medical Association both sent letters requesting the association to discuss ways to deal with the fact that the local business tax bureaus collected business tax from hospitals and clinics, registered them all, and ordered each hospital to declare its annual income for tax purposes. It was resolved that the Wuhan and Wujin cases would be discussed together. Medical practice is a free profession and is different from business. The authorities in Wuhan and Wujin collecting business tax is an overstepping of the principles of taxation. First, the legal advisor will review it in order to strive for it. One item, the Ningyan Medical Association sent a letter requesting a test of the apparent nature of the "Ariel Malin" drug. It was resolved that Dr. Abe Katsuma of the Faculty of Medicine of Keio University in Japan should be consulted first to determine the composition of the drug, and what is the pharmacology of the hypnotic and mental confusion that occurs after injection, and a sample should be requested from the plaintiff's product office for trial use before replying to the association and waiting for a report; one item, the National New Medical Association sent a letter requesting that the donation collection situation be reported and concluded. It was resolved that the fundraising captain and vice-captain would handle it; one item, whether or not to collect the 20th-year membership fee. It was resolved to do so. Finally, other cases were discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>As Usual, a Phone Call First</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, This Caused Failure</p>
<p>Dong Niankang, a Ningbo native, 41 years old, has been the manager of Yiyuan Qianzhuang in Jixiang Lane, South City. At noon the day before yesterday, he suddenly received a phone call, claiming to be from Laowenbao Jewelry Store at No. 248 Xinzha Road. The caller stated that the jewelry store needed to pay Runchang Hao 948 yuan and asked him to prepare the funds so that a clerk could be sent to collect them immediately. After listening, Dong was worried that something was wrong, so he made another phone call to the jewelry store to inquire. Dong Xuepeng, the owner of the jewelry store, was shocked when he received the call and immediately rushed to the qianzhuang to meet with Dong Niankang. Dong Xuepeng stated that he had not sent a clerk to collect funds or pay Runchang. While they were talking, a young man of about 20 years old came to the qianzhuang with a blank check from Laowenbao Jewelry Store payable to Runchang Hao, claiming that he wanted to withdraw 948 yuan. At that time, the two Dongs heard about it, stepped out from inside, and observed that they did not recognize the young man. Knowing that he was not a good person, they immediately called the police officer Lu Guangwen from that station to come and detain him, and took him to the First District General Administration for preliminary interrogation. According to his statement, his name was Liu Dianqing, 19 years old, from Yangzhou. He was working as a tea server at the Taian Inn outside the Xinbeimen Gate on Minguo Road. At 9:00 AM today, a young man, claiming to be Zhou Suichu, came to the inn and booked room No. 58. After lunch, he gave me the check and asked me to take it to Yiyuan Qianzhuang to withdraw 948 yuan. He did not know the details. The detectives were immediately dispatched to the inn and arrested Zhou and brought him back for questioning. Zhou stated that he was 18 years old, from Ningbo, and had been an apprentice at Yiyuan Qianzhuang. He was very familiar with the qianzhuang's clients. He was fired in September last year and returned to his hometown. In December, he came to Shanghai again and stayed at the Taixin Inn outside the Xiaodongmen Gate in the French Concession. Because he had no progress and life was difficult, he had to privately carve a seal and fraudulently obtained a passbook from Yiyuan Qianzhuang from Futai Chang. Later, he asked the inn's tea server to take the passbook to Yiyuan Qianzhuang and withdrew 1,500 yuan. However, he was unlucky, and the money was all lost in gambling dens in a few days. His livelihood has become increasingly difficult. He then privately carved the seals of Laowenbao Jewelry Store and Runchang Hao and forged a check, sending the tea server to the qianzhuang to fraudulently obtain 948 yuan for use. He first made a phone call to notify the qianzhuang, impersonating Laowenbao Jewelry Store, as usual, but unexpectedly this caused the failure and he was arrested. He did not deny anything. He was ordered to remain in custody for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Xue Qishi's Finger Amputation Case to be Pronounced <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Judge Sincerely Urged Reconciliation</p>
<p>The Two Sides Did Not Reach an Agreement and Adjourned</p>
<p>Chen Kengran, the manager of Youlian Film Company, was previously sued in the Special District Court by Xue Qishi, an actor in the company, for intentional injury, with a request for compensation of 29,460 yuan. The next day, Chen also countersued Xue in the Special District Court for crimes such as intimidation and fraud. The details of the initial trial of this case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the second trial of the part of Xue Qishi's lawsuit against Chen Kengran and Zhao Taishan for injury and compensation. Judge Cheng Shangfeng continued the trial. After both sides had finished providing the past situation (the same as before, omitted), Judge Cheng advised the plaintiff, "Filing a lawsuit is a useless thing. It is better to listen to my advice and let Chen pay 300 yuan as consolation, and the two sides will settle the dispute from now on. It is more practical. Moreover, although Zhao Taishan is currently working at Youlian, according to his own confession, his monthly income is only 25 yuan. If he is really found guilty and punished, it will not help you. Xue said that since the injury, he has suffered mentally and physically, and he has become disabled. It is difficult to find a job. Even if he tells his will, he wants to punish Chen first, and then talk about compensation." The judge then asked Chen, "Are you willing to listen to my advice now and give Xue 300 yuan as consolation? You should know that the plaintiff was injured on official duty. Judging from his situation, it is really pitiful. It is not too much to pay some compensation." Chen said that he was willing to follow the instructions and settle peacefully, but the plaintiff had been treated and given money on his behalf since he was injured. Now he has been charged with criminal charges for repeatedly failing to get what he wanted, which is detrimental to his reputation. He was not unhappy in his heart. Even the Youlian Company is not owned by one person and cannot be the master alone. Judge Cheng then advised the plaintiff, "According to your request in the lawsuit, the purpose is nothing more than compensation. Now, for the sake of settling things, it is better to listen to my advice and add another 100 yuan to you, for a total of 400 yuan, and the two sides will settle it." Xue replied, "Since I was injured, I have been unemployed for a long time. Not to mention that I have a lot of debt, even one item of pawn is more than 400 yuan. If I get 400 yuan, I will not be able to pay off my old debts, nor will I be able to clear my debts and return to my hometown. It is difficult to find a job. The small amount of money will be eaten up, which is not helpful." He immediately expressed his unwillingness to accept it and requested that the other party give him a job. Chen Kengran also said, "The plaintiff has no fixed address and has said that he would shoot my family to death and then commit suicide. If this is the case, even if some money is given to comfort him for his injury, if he has unsafe actions against me in the future, he must issue a certificate when this case is settled peacefully, stating that he will not take any harmful actions in the future. As for the position, I have no idea." Because the plaintiff was still unwilling to accept the advice, there was no guarantee of safety. The court immediately asked the lawyers on both sides to begin their arguments. After arguing, the court scheduled the pronouncement of the verdict.</p>

Afterwards, Hu Qian, the girl's mother, reported it to the police, who arrested Zhang and sent him to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. The details of the interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, this case continued to be heard. The defendant still lied.

<h3 id="e174">A Depraved Youth Commits Suicide <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Weak Will and Bad Environment</p>
<p>Gambling and Unemployment Lead to Inability to Extricate Himself</p>
<p>Wang Shuan, a native of Anhui, was only twenty-four years old. Last year, he came to Shanghai from his hometown to seek employment and was hired by the Kunlun Tobacco Company. If he had been able to work diligently, especially as a promising young man, it would not have been difficult for him to rise above others. However, due to his weak will, he was tempted by a bad environment and made many harmful friends. He was devoted to gambling, and his monthly salary was insufficient to cover his reckless bets. As a result, he accumulated heavy debts and was dismissed from his job. He became destitute in Shanghai and had no face to return to his elders in his hometown. Ye Shengwu, a distant relative in Shanghai, repeatedly provided him with financial assistance, but ultimately failed to alleviate his poverty. Wang's situation became increasingly dire, exacerbated by creditor harassment and an empty wallet. Feeling that there was no joy in life, he went alone to a large hotel on Jiujiang Road on the afternoon of the second of this month, falsely claiming to be lodging there. After being led by a waiter to Room 31, he closed the door and drafted two suicide notes, stating that since losing his job, his finances had become increasingly strained, and he had accumulated hundreds of dollars in gambling debts, all borrowed, with no way to repay them, hence his suicide. He also wrote ten letters to relatives and friends who had lent him money, expressing his inability to repay the loans in this life and hoping to do so in the next, apologizing profusely and hoping for understanding. After completing these preparations, he ingested poison and waited in bed to die. The next day, near noon, when a waiter wanted to enter the room to clean, he knocked on the door but received no response. He broke down the door and opened the curtains to check, only to find that Wang's face had turned gray, and he was no longer breathing, having died at an unknown time. The hotel staff immediately reported to the Zhabei Police Station, which dispatched detective Zhang Yi to investigate. After an investigation, the body was taken to the forensic examination office on Faelun Road, and the suicide notes were taken back to the police station. His relative, Ye Shengwu, was also notified. Yesterday morning, Ye went to the morgue, awaiting Qian, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, to arrive for a clear examination before requesting to claim the body for burial. This was approved. It is said that one wrong step leads to a thousand regrets, and it is too late to turn back. This can be used as a lament for Wang Shuan. Many young people are like Wang, and they should wake up to this reality.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating that usury and exploitation harm people's livelihoods and must be strictly prohibited. The Central Political Conference resolved in its 111th meeting in the 16th year of the Republic that the maximum interest rate should not exceed 20% per annum, and the Municipal Government's Notice No. 5 and the Bureau's orders to its subordinates have been issued to comply with this. Fearing that the matter may be taken lightly over time, and unscrupulous individuals may still be engaging in double-dealing and exploiting the poor, the prohibition must be reiterated and strictly enforced. In addition to ordering subordinates to pay attention to and prohibit this at any time, this notice is issued for compliance. From now on, the prescribed interest rate must be strictly implemented, and usury and exploitation are prohibited. Anyone who dares to violate this will be punished according to the law once discovered and will not be tolerated. This notice is issued on May 4th.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Petition from Rickshaw Pullers in West Shanghai <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Public Works Bureau to Organize Matters Gradually</p>
<p>Peng Yuzhi, Sun Zhaokang, Yu Hainan, Li Zhiliang, Tang Changyu, and more than twenty other representatives of rickshaw pullers in West Shanghai submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that they had received Public Works Bureau's approval number 449, acknowledging their submission. The case had been previously submitted to the Bureau by Tai Jiangzhou and others, and on April 15th, an order was issued to register in accordance with the regulations announced by the Finance Bureau and the Bureau. Their request to issue licenses based on the original number and to use old vehicles was deemed unnecessary. Upon receiving this, the petitioners were deeply distressed, as their families depended on the rickshaws for their livelihood, lacking savings and skills. The Municipal Government's proposal to increase the number of rickshaws was intended for those who wanted to be self-employed and own their vehicles. Therefore, they expressed their difficulties and hardships, requesting the Public Works Bureau to issue licenses based on the original number of rickshaws, considering the livelihood of the poor while organizing traffic. They had no intention of being deceptive or opportunistic. The facts were clear and easily verifiable. However, they were repeatedly rejected without any flexibility. Upon investigation, the rickshaws operating in the Chinese area were mostly淘汰ed from the public concession and some were broken old chartered rickshaws mixed among them when the initial organization華界 was still a pioneering effort It was feared that they would wait and see, and those who came would be granted licenses. After three years of inspection, the uneven vehicles were gradually淘汰ed. Therefore, the 7,400 rickshaws in South Shanghai and Zhabei were more 整齊 and presentable than those in West Shanghai, and only a small number were completely renovated. As the West Shanghai market was still under construction, the rickshaw pullers were not comparable to those who operated for companies. Since the government was able to accommodate them in the past, it should show even more compassion and generosity to these four hundred or so scattered rickshaw pullers, showing its genuine intention to help the poor. The government has been building affordable housing for the people, repeatedly showing its concern for the poor. The rickshaw pullers, who are located in the corner of the city, are the poorest among the people. How dare they dream of building mansions. This request for increased licensing and organization is entirely in accordance with the government's intentions. They will still implement the Public Works Bureau's plan to increase the number of rickshaws in order, with only slight variations in timing based on local conditions. There is no harm to the public, nor to private interests. They earnestly request the Municipal Government to instruct the Public Works Bureau to organize matters gradually within its ability, to save lives and maintain public welfare. They are anxiously awaiting orders.</p>

<p>Shanghai Medical and Pharmaceutical Communities Prepare for Memorial Service</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Shisheng of Haimen dedicated himself to the study of Chinese medicine for nearly thirty years. His experience and knowledge were highly respected in the medical field. He served as the President of the Haimen County Medical and Pharmaceutical Research Association in Jiangsu, the Principal of the Zhongxing Medical and Pharmaceutical Vocational School, the Chairman of the Haimen County Branch of the National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association of Jiangsu Province, a professor of pharmaceutical quality at the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Vocational School, the Chinese Medical College, and the National Medical College, and an executive member and standing committee member of the National Medical and Pharmaceutical Organizations Federation. He donated a large sum of money to establish the National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association's Drug Exhibition Center and invested solely in developing a medicinal herb garden in Nanxiang to cultivate domestic medicinal plants for experimentation and improvement. In summary, he made significant contributions to Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals and was deeply admired by the medical and pharmaceutical communities at home and abroad. Last winter, Mr. Zhang represented the National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association to urge the establishment of the Central National Pharmaceutical Museum. During the severe winter, Mr. Zhang braved the snow, resulting in a cold. He became ill upon his return, and after more than two months of illness, despite the careful diagnosis and treatment of famous Chinese and Western doctors, he passed away in his hometown on the first day of the third month of the lunar calendar at the age of fifty-five. The news of his passing has been met with widespread mourning. It is now learned that Ding Zhongying, Xie Liheng, Xia Yingtang, Zhang Meian, Cai Jiping, Jiang Wenfang, Bao Shisheng, Xu Xiangren, Yu Botao, Shen Zhuoru, Fu Yongyan, Huang Baozhong, Qin Bowei, and Yan Cangshan, all well-known figures in the Shanghai Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical communities, as well as the National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association, the Shanghai Municipal Chinese Medicine Association, the National Pharmaceutical Association, the Chinese Medicine Vocational School, the National Medical College, and the Chinese Medical College, believe that Mr. Zhang devoted his life to medicine and pharmaceuticals and made irreplaceable contributions.

<p>A Prostitute Was Solicited for Company</p>
<p>Also Implicated and Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>The residence of Qiu Mujin, the comprador of the Taikoo Shipping Company's Wuchang ship, located in Junhe Lane, Alabaster Road, was robbed last month. The next day, the Huishi Police Station apprehended three robbers and recovered some of the stolen goods, handing them over to the Special District Court for detention and further investigation of the remaining accomplices. This has already been reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, Detective Bai Zhongqi, Detective Shang Wu, and others went to 922 Maigen Road, 212 Chengdu Road, and the Xin Su Hotel, 296 Yingchun Lane, Hubei Road, and arrested nine men and women, including Yang Jinyuan, Cao Yongchang, Xu Jincai, Zhu Busheng, Lu Abao, Lu Qu, Cao Zhengyi, Cao Asan, and Wang Xiuzhen. They seized five pistols, two Mauser rifles, 141 rounds of ammunition, and a stolen 马甲. The firearms included one pistol and one Mauser rifle, which the victim identified as also being stolen. Subsequently, they also cooperated with the Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest a Jiangbei woman, Sun Qu, at 4 Zixia Road in South City. Yesterday morning, they were all escorted to the Special Court, where Judge Ge Zhitan conducted a preliminary hearing. As the three previously arrested, Chen Gengsheng and others, had their case postponed to the 12th of this month by Judge Wu Tingqi last week, they were also ordered to remain in detention separately and be tried together with Chen and others. It is said that Wang Xiuzhen is a prostitute who was called by Cao Zhengyi to accompany him at the Xin Su Hotel the night before her arrest. Lu Abao is Xu Jincai's mistress, and Lu Qu is Abao's mother. The guns and ammunition were all seized from her home.</p>

<p>Two Years and Six Months Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>When Wang A Ming's son Mao Jian was still a baby, he was sent to the home of Luo Guangxiu's wife Wang, fellow villagers living at 299 Tangjiawan in the French Concession, for breastfeeding and care. After two years, A Ming took him back. The child is now four years old. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, Luo went to Wang's home in Hele Lane, North Henan Road, and enticed Mao Jian with candy, taking him out with him. Luo's wife, Wang, was waiting at the alley entrance and immediately picked up the child, hired a rickshaw, and fled. Li Ada, Wang's neighbor, witnessed the incident and reported it to A Ming, who reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to Luo's home and arrested Luo and his wife. However, Mao Jian was nowhere to be found. Under strict questioning, Luo and his wife confessed that they had hidden him at the home of their subtenant, Yang Zhong. The detectives then arrested Yang. The child was first returned to A Ming. Yesterday morning, Luo and the other three men and women were brought to the Special District Court for trial. Luo and his wife admitted to taking the child, but claimed that Yang Zhong had recently lost her son and was crying all day, so they took Mao Jian to her home, intending to sell him as an adopted son, but the deal had not been completed. Yang Zhong confessed that she had intended to buy him as an adopted son, but she still needed to investigate his background. The police lawyer argued that the three defendants were undoubtedly guilty of child abduction and requested that they be severely punished. After questioning, Judge Feng sentenced each of them to two years and six months of imprisonment. The three convicts all bowed their heads in submission and were sent to prison.</p>

Subsequently, her son, represented by lawyer Yan Feixi Zhen, filed a complaint with the French Court, requesting compensation of 5,000 yuan. After questioning by the Chinese and Western officials, a verdict was awaited. Yesterday, the Chinese and Western officials issued an order after the Mingtang hearing, summoning both parties. The verdict stated that after investigation by the Court, the case was found to be true. The defendant, Luo Bingzhang, was fined 20 yuan, and Xu Baoxing of the Dahe Coal Company was fined 10 yuan.

<p>Li Zhonggong, after being reassigned to the Anhui Provincial Committee by the Central Government, has not been to the Bureau since May 2nd. The affairs of each department have been completed and are ready to be handed over to the new appointee. Before Guo Waifeng takes office, the internal and external affairs of the Bureau, according to the instructions of General Manager Li, are entrusted to the Secretary-General to handle. The internal affairs of the Bureau are proceeding as usual, with each department and branch responsible for their respective tasks.</p>
<h3 id="e195">New Manager Takes Office <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Guo Waifeng, the new manager, received the appointment order from the Central Government and initially planned to arrive at the Bureau this Saturday to take office. Yesterday, the Bureau sent personnel to the new manager's office to inquire about the date of his arrival and assumption of duties. It was confirmed that General Manager Guo has changed the date to the 11th of this month to assume his new post at the Bureau. The Affairs Department has prepared all the necessary procedures. Guo left for Beijing by express train yesterday afternoon to meet with Chairman Chiang and discuss all matters.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Three Section Chiefs Resign <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>After Li Zhonggong arrived at the Bureau, he only reassigned three section chiefs. Now that Li has resigned, Huang Penghao, the Chief of the Shipping Department, Kong Xiangrong, the Chief of the Accounting Department, and Lu Haiqing, the Chief of the Affairs Department, have also submitted their resignations in order to advance and retreat with Li. The affairs of each department have been completed and are ready to be handed over to the new appointees.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Shen Zhongyi in Charge <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The handover procedures for each department during the transition period are extremely complicated. Before the new manager arrives, Li Zhonggong appointed Shen Zhongyi, the Chief of the Business Department, to be responsible for both internal and external affairs, as he is most familiar with the Bureau's operations and is conscientious in his work. He is the most trusted by all the Bureau's staff and is also trusted by the Hakka community. Therefore, Shen is responsible for all matters, large and small, related to the handover. After taking over, he will hand them over to the new appointee when he arrives. Therefore, Chief Shen has been busier than other staff members these days.</p>

<p>Zhao Jinqing, the newly appointed Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, has not yet gone to Beijing to take office since the National Government formally announced his appointment.

After receiving the telegram, Zhao left for Beijing by night express train the night before last to take office.</p>

<p>The registration deadline for the Municipal Certification Examination is today (May 5th). However, today is the anniversary of the Revolutionary Government, and all government agencies are closed.

<h3 id="e200">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Business Tax on Outbound Boxed Tea <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>To Facilitate Overseas Sales of Chinese Tea</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating that the Shanghai Foreign Tea Industry Association had stated that its business was declining due to the export of tea from India, Ceylon, Java, and Japan. The export of tea in those countries, were lightly taxed if not exempted, and various subsidies were provided to seize the sales of Chinese tea. In October of the 8th year of the Republic, domestic Li Jin tax was reduced by 50% or exempted. Request was made in previous years to exempt them, the government exempted Li Jin tax immediately and the request was not repeated. Now that the Li Jin tax has been completely exempted, outbound boxed tea is subject to the same business tax as general merchandise. However, Anhui Province suddenly announced that outbound boxed tea would be subject to a business tax of 20 per mille, the same as general merchandise. The Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting the Anhui Finance Department to exempt the tax, but has not received a reply. The request is made to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the government to permanently exempt outbound boxed tea from customs duties, business taxes, and miscellaneous taxes under other names, to maintain the export of domestic products. Given this, the export of Chinese tea has been exempted from customs duties with approval. As the tea industry has been severely impacted by Indian and Ceylon teas, taxes and duties should be further reduced to protect the industry. Although business tax is a commercial tax, the lace embroidery industry has been exempted from business tax due to its focus on foreign trade. The Association had telegraphed in request and was issued with 钧批赋字 No. 12145 stating that the nature of the lace embroidery business focuses on foreign trade and differs from ordinary lace industry, the request for exemption of business tax is justified. The intention to promote the export of domestic goods is evident. The promotion of Chinese tea exports is of greater importance than lace embroidery, and business tax should be exempted to facilitate development. The request is made to the Ministry for approval. It is a matter of public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Municipal Finance Bureau Takes Over the Municipal Slaughter Tax <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government, which was forwarded to the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office regarding the municipal slaughter tax, which was being collected by them. The request instructed a prompt handover and takeover. It is now heard that the negotiations have been completed. Recently, the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office sent a letter to the Municipal Government, scheduling the collection by our municipality to begin on the first of this month. Upon receiving the order, the Municipal Finance Bureau immediately began preparing for all takeover matters and drafted regulations for the collection of the slaughter tax. After submitting them to the Municipal Government for approval, they will be jointly announced with the Health Bureau. All pig and sheep slaughterhouses within the municipal area must comply with these collection regulations, purchase tax tickets in advance, and be prepared for inspection. It is also heard that the veterinarians dispatched by the Health Bureau and the accountants dispatched by the Finance Bureau have been appointed. The regulations are as follows: Attached are the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's Slaughter Tax Collection Regulations: Article 1: The slaughter tax listed in these regulations is temporarily established for pigs and sheep. All pig and sheep slaughterhouses in the municipal area must comply. Article 2: The slaughter tax is collected by the various collection offices under this Bureau. Article 3: The slaughter tax rates are as follows: (A) Tax of 39 cents (大洋) per pig slaughtered. (B) Tax of 20 cents (大洋) per sheep slaughtered. Article 4: Each slaughterhouse should purchase slaughter tax tickets in advance, categorized, from the collection offices established by this Bureau in the nearby area. The ticket format will be determined separately. Article 5: The types of slaughter tax tickets are as follows: (A) Pig slaughter tax ticket: white, 39 cents (大洋) per ticket, 50 tickets per book, totaling 19.50 (大洋). (B) Sheep slaughter tax ticket: blue, 20 cents (大洋) per ticket, 50 tickets per book, totaling 10 (大洋). Article 6: Daily, this Bureau will dispatch personnel during pig and sheep slaughter inspection hours to go to each slaughterhouse with the Health Bureau inspectors to check the number of slaughtered animals. Article 7: Each slaughterhouse should present the tax tickets for verification according to the number of pigs and sheep slaughtered daily. The accountants from this Bureau will clip the corners and cancel them. Article 8: If no tax ticket is found for the pigs and sheep slaughtered by each slaughterhouse, they should be ordered to purchase and present the tax tickets for inspection before being allowed to transport them out of the factory. Those who conceal the number of slaughtered animals will be fined three times the amount of tax payable in addition to making up the tax. Article 9: Any slaughterhouse that resists inspection will be sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Article 10: If any accounting personnel of this Bureau extort or engage in favoritism and malpractice, they will be investigated and dealt with according to law upon discovery or accusation. Article 11: If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be submitted for amendment at any time. Article 12: These regulations will be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Representatives of the Cattle, Sheep, and Pig Industries Petition the Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Abolish Inspection Fees</p>
<p>The cattle, sheep, and pig industries in our municipality are burdened by the Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of slaughter tax, inspection fees, and the upcoming municipal business tax. The merchants and residents of these industries feel that they cannot bear such overlapping charges. Yesterday (the 4th), they selected five general representatives: Chen Baosheng, Shen Liansheng, Lu Yichen, Gu Changsheng, and He Rusheng. (It was said that they originally intended to send the entire group, but due to the Memorial Day, they feared the government might misunderstand, so they changed to sending representatives.) They submitted petitions to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Municipal Government only received the petition, as the Mayor was in Beijing and Secretary-General Yu was on official business, and did not grant an audience. They then went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, where Mr. Zheng received them. The representatives explained that the cattle, sheep, and pig industries consist of small merchants and residents, and now the Finance Bureau only knows how to collect money without considering the suffering of the merchants and residents. (The cost of a goat is about 20 cents (小洋), but it has to be taxed 27 cents (大洋), which is actually a tax of 150%. The tax on cattle and pigs is also above 10%, with a tax of about 30% or more on small cattle.) Since the collection of cattle and sheep inspection fees began, the industry has suffered greatly. For example, the cattle and sheep industry association is using the excuse that the Municipal Finance Bureau is recovering the extra inspection fees for cattle and sheep from 1919 and is ordering the industry to retroactively pay the fees, which is unbearable. Therefore, the public is indignant and compelled to state the facts and reasons, appealing to the government to abolish the inspection fees for livestock, which are similar to a transit tax and should be abolished. The National Government is now streamlining and abolishing excessive levies and miscellaneous taxes to alleviate the people's difficulties. We in the pig, cattle, and sheep industries are all citizens under the blue and white flag and should enjoy the right to "one item, one tax." Since the business tax is about to be implemented, our industry should not be an exception. Once the business tax is levied, the inspection and slaughter items should be abolished immediately in accordance with the National Government's order. Moreover, the cattle, sheep, and pigs slaughtered before slaughter are transported to the concession for slaughter. When slaughtering in the concession, it is necessary to pay the slaughterhouse fee. It is not possible to establish inspection items and collect huge handling fees just because they pass through the Chinese territory. Inspection should be implemented because it is related to meat hygiene and cannot be abolished. If the Municipal Health Bureau needs funds for hiring veterinarians for inspection and other inspection parts and cannot make up for the expenses, then our industry is willing to be responsible for the sanitation expenses of the livestock inspection part. Please forward the request to the government to open a low budget for the sanitation expenses of the livestock inspection in 1920 and assign it to the cattle, sheep, and pig industries to share. In this way, the government will not have to abandon eating due to choking, and the merchants and residents can avoid worrying all day long. Please, your association, accurately forward the request, etc. Mr. Zheng of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied that the request from your industry to forward various situations is justified and the Chamber will do so. The representatives then left.</p>

<p>The China National Aviation Corporation (中國航空公司) faces the obstruction of high mountains in Sichuan, causing inconvenient transportation. Mail between Shanghai and Chengdu takes more than ten days to arrive. The company recently expanded its air routes to complete its original plan, extending the Shanghai-Yichang line to Wanxian and Chongqing. There are dangerous gorges between Wanxian, requiring light and convenient airplanes to fly over the gorges more nimbly. The company telegraphed the Curtiss airplane factory in the United States to order four light Loening airplanes, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai in about a month. The airport sites in Wanxian and Chongqing have been surveyed and found suitable. The wireless radio to be installed in the station building will be installed by engineers dispatched by the company after the American aircraft arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The National Goods Maintenance Association Promotes the Korean National Products Exhibition Hall <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association (中華國貨維持會) has recently been actively working to promote the Korean National Products Exhibition Hall, sparing no effort. Because Zhang Weicheng, the Consul-General stationed in Korea, is about to return to his post, the Association plans to collect samples of domestic national product factories and transfer them to Consul Zhang to Korea, so that they can be displayed as soon as possible. Yesterday, a notice was issued to various national silk and satin industries and cotton weaving factories to urge them to submit the samples. The original text is as follows: (Omitted above) It is found that the amount of goods shipped from our country to Korea reached several tens of millions of dollars in the past. However, since Japan implemented harsh levies on Chinese goods, with a tax of 100% of the value, only a few items could be shipped, and most of the silk and satin goods have not been able to be shipped in inches or threads for many years. Hundreds of thousands of people in our country's industrial and commercial circles have been destroyed by it. Although the government has worked hard to negotiate and amended it to 70% of the value, it is still too far from the 8% of the value levied on Japanese goods. Fortunately, the agreement is for a period of three years, excluding the past year, there are only two years left. The Association plans to take advantage of this period to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convene relevant industrial and commercial groups to study in detail the points that should be amended in this Sino-Japanese commercial agreement, so as to submit them to Japan for negotiation and proper handling. On the other hand, with the consent of Mr. Zhang Weicheng, the Consul-General stationed in Korea, samples of our country's fine national goods will be collected and sent to the Consulate-General stationed in Korea. A Chinese National Goods Exhibition Hall will be established on a selected site, so that overseas Chinese and local people from all walks of life can be invited to visit the hall from time to time, so that they can understand and recognize it, and develop their belief and purchase intention. This is the first step in preparing for the restoration of the trade in Korea. Moreover, Consul Zhang is returning to China on official business and will stay in Shanghai for several days. Therefore, this special letter is delivered, and we ask your office to quickly compile the fine old and new goods samples, compile the numbers, and open the name of the factory, address, trademark, value, and other words on another paper. Deliver the properly packaged goods to the Association's office for inspection before the 25th of this month, so that they can be transferred to Consul Zhang to Korea for display, restore the inherent honor, and recreate the glory of the country. (Omitted below), etc.</p>

<p>Three Principles Previously Agreed</p>
<p>The municipal business tax, which is being handled by the business tax preparatory office, drafted a draft of the collection regulations and implementation rules, as well as the tax standard and tax rate table. (On the 1st of this month, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Yansong, etc., were convened to participate in the discussion. It is heard that only three major principles were agreed on that day: (1) The Chinese and foreign concessions should be levied uniformly, (2) Chinese and foreign stores should be treated equally, and (3) The tax rate principle should be separately set at three levels: 1/1000, 2/1000, and 3/1000. It is necessary to ask the Municipal Government for instructions before a decision can be made. However, for the convenience of current research, the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce can temporarily use it as a standard when reviewing the draft tax rate. The next session is scheduled for the 21st of this month and will still be held at the preparatory office.</p>
