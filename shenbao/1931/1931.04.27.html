<p>追溯公共租界工部局設置華人代表問題之歷史討論一八六六年所擬地産章程之時曾將推舉中國代表之提議加以討論而其時之領事團亦草擬一種辦法主張由華民各機關之代表及領袖選舉華民代表三人成立一顧問委員會以備對於關係華民之事宜得與工部局商洽工部局總董對於此項所擬辦法曾經函述其意見如下此函於一八六六年十二月間公布工部局之容納華民代表係屬一種創舉容或因此發生意見不同之處但似不致有不利之結果倘能增進中外之親善所得巳多關係華人之政令而能知華人之意見如何此爲外人之利而在華人方面對於吾國所通行之自由代表制度以及吾輩所重視之公平司法行政亦可藉此得有真知灼見上文所提設立華人顧問委員會之辦法在一八六九年北京各國公使最後批准之地産章程之内並未列入其緣因何在載籍未詳華人代表問題之正式重提遲至約近四十年以後一九零五年十二月間以經會審公堂之事變由華人各業領袖與工部局合作商擬恢復原狀之必需辦法結果爲提議設置一承認機關以便工部局與華人商界領袖間之將來商洽此種提議見一九零六年二月間虞洽卿君所致工部局總董函内該函内稱華人業經開會所有上海各業董事會之董事均經列席並曾一致贊同選舉七人組織一華商委員會以代表各業之利益嗣又備函開明該委員會之名稱爲「代表委員會」官吏不加入並不參與選舉委員會之職務在於提出增進公共租界福利之各項建議關係華人利益之現行章程及細則如有更改所望工部局能先予委員會以商洽之機會該函又言設立委員會之目的在使工部局得知華人團體之對於關係華人之特别利益問題其意見如何感覺奚若并使該委員會爲一承認機關華人居民遇有申訴事件得由該委員會轉達工部局且可增進中外人民間之信用與好感而使公共租界之福利進步工部局歡迎上項之提議但因此惹起外報之譏評除其他反</p>

<p>從歷史方面討論在公共租界行政之下華人之對於繳納捐稅以及分享界内所辦巿政之利益其所處地位何若其問題爲從前之工部局何以無華人代表又何以並無規定而使關於工部局之政策及其行政之方法在該局與承認爲界内華人居民團體代表之間得有一種有統係之商洽工部局雖與中國之輿論代表並無一定之接觸但該局之對於華人利益是否對付公道關於公共租界内華民人數之增加一層論列如左一八七六年以來公共租界内之華民日漸加增可見多數華人皆以爲界内之情况較勝於界外所以認爲較勝者大概因公共租界爲商賈及職業之中心具有經濟之吸引力自無疑義然經濟之狀况與行政之狀况關係密切華民之絡繹徙居公共租界亦可證明若輩之對於租界治制知其爲有利益此項利益之性質甚爲實在前章業巳述及工部局曾採用各種方法以保護華民之利益俾不受界外官廳任意行動之影響公共租界内華人商業之日漸擴展亦以此項保護爲一種極重要之原因公共租界之巿政管理卓著成效結果爲界内之生活狀况大見改良大多數華人亦享受之華人之於捐稅固須按期繳納但所定稅額有一定之標準所獲之償報利益亦昭然可見界外各區華官之課稅及收稅其所用方法弛漫無常以致所徵之稅並無一定且多武斷而易涉苛暴對於有進取心之商人以其營業順利認爲財力充裕苛徵尤甚至於納稅之後究有若何酬報利益並無保證地方所徵收之稅係供給公衆服務之用於納稅人有直接之利而非爲徵收官廳或其胥吏或承包捐稅之機關謀其利益但在最近若干年以前中國之行政當局對於此種見解殊少認識公共租界内之路政優良以及警務之得力均可顯然證明工部局所徵之稅如何使用報告表示本章題旨所應加考量之問題並非注重於租界内之華民在租界統治之下其所處境遇是否比假定受治於界外之華官爲勝而實注重於租界之行政就全體而言在華民與外僑之間是否以公平爲標準</p>

<p>Reliable sources in diplomatic circles confirm that the main point of contention in the Sino-Russian negotiations to redeem the Chinese Eastern Railway is China's insistence on a limited valuation of the railway's depreciation, with the remaining value reverting to China. Russia insists on a mixed valuation method, which may lead to the failure of China's plans. Both sides have agreed to continue discussing this case in the future. The Chinese delegation has been treated with courtesy and consideration, even more so than in the past, and the attitude is also more sincere. It is also heard that the reasons for Russia's acceptance are: (1) With the success of Qiqihar, the grain transported from northern Manchuria is being diverted by the Qiqihar-Taonan Railway, making the Eastern Railway less valuable than before. (2) The desire to obtain a large sum of money from the railway redemption to complete the Five-Year Economic Independence plan. (3) Soviet employees can still maintain their advantageous conditions, and China must add additional employee treatment agreements. (4) The success of the railway redemption will further demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sino-Russian agreements. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Our country has expended a great deal of effort to abolish unequal treaties, but progress is not easy. Is the binding force of treaties truly so great? According to a European telegram, Poland and the Free City of Danzig have a deepening sense of antipathy. Poland demands that police or troops be allowed to enter the territory of Danzig. The League of Nations Commission managing the Free City of Danzig has refused. A semi-official Russian newspaper commented that Poland has always taken the dignity of treaties as its slogan, but when it is in its own interest, it does not hesitate to infringe upon them, going back on its word, which is disgusting. Of course, Soviet Russia is not a proponent of the dignity of treaties, and it is appropriate that it made this comment. However, those who take the dignity of treaties as their slogan, but whose actions often exceed the scope of the treaties and who are unwilling to give in, are not just Poland. All powerful countries do the same with weaker countries. The so-called treaty, when it is beneficial to oneself, then the dignity of the treaty is taken as a slogan. When it is beneficial to oneself to infringe on the treaty, then one does not hesitate to infringe and ignores the treaty. Consider China today, which is struggling to resist the infringement of treaties, and the rights that are not covered by treaties but have been infringed upon over the years are countless. How can countries that treat treaties as sacred and hold them as rare commodities explain this? I have written this after being moved by the Soviet Union's comment on Poland.</p>

<p>Taiwanese Aborigine Attack Incident</p>
<p>The purpose seems to be revenge.</p>
<p>Atrocities of the Tasza Aborigines</p>
<p>The Xibao Aborigine community suffered the most damage.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 25th <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>This morning, the Taiwanese Tasza Aborigine tribe attacked the aborigine communities protected by Japanese officials, which was extremely cruel and violent, leaving no one alive. Among the attacked aborigine communities, the protected Xibao aborigine community suffered the most damage. According to the report received by the Colonial Affairs Bureau tonight from the Governor-General of Taiwan, the confirmed damage status of each protected aborigine community is as follows: 1. The damage to the Xibao aborigine community, which was attacked by 60 Tasza Aborigine tribesmen, is as follows: 141 dead, 10 seriously injured, and 25 missing. 1. The above tribesmen set fire to the houses of the aborigine communities. The number of households in the Sike community is 39, the Bualun community is 10, and the Mashibu community is 20. 1. The damage to the Lotofu aborigine community, which was attacked by the above tribal detachment, is as follows: 43 dead, 3 injured, and 79 missing. 1. The number of houses burned in this area is 55 households in the Lotofu and Fuguo communities, of which 49 were destroyed.</p>

<p>According to information obtained by the Governor-General's Office from various sources, the motive for the Tasha Awan's attack on the protected aboriginal villages</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>originated from the Wushe Incident last year. During that incident last year, the Tasha Awan, who were under protection, were attacked and injured by Mahebu and other rebellious aborigines. Most of the villagers were killed or wounded. To avenge this, they first killed three women from the Xibao aboriginal village on the 21st and took their heads. The Tasha Awan anticipated that the protected aboriginal villages would retaliate, so they preemptively attacked the Xibao aboriginals, thus leading to this great tragedy.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Telegraphic News Agency, Taipei, 26th <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to subsequent investigations into the aboriginal attack incident, only eleven Tasha Awan who launched the attack were injured and one was missing. Among the Xibao protected aborigines who were attacked, 144 were killed, ten were seriously injured, and twenty-five were missing. Among the Luotuo protected aborigines, 43 were killed and 79 were missing. The cause of the attack has not yet been determined, but it seems that the Tasha Awan were helping the Governor-General's Office during the Wushe Incident, and they seem to want to take the opportunity to retaliate against the enemy aborigines. The authorities are carefully planning the aftermath.</p>

<p>This attack occurred among the various aboriginal tribes and was unrelated to the Japanese. According to the investigation results, the authorities only stationed one police officer in the protected aboriginal village, which was a major defect in security. It is feared that this will cause problems. In addition, the attacked side only used bamboo spears for defense because they were caught off guard and had no way to resist firearms, which led to this tragedy. The Sike and Bualun villages have reportedly been completely destroyed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Police Chief Chuko of Taichung Prefecture summoned the heads of the attacking aboriginal tribes to the Dantona police station to reprimand them for attacking the protected aborigines. He confiscated the borrowed rifles and ammunition and 101 blood-soaked human heads that had been taken, ordering them to reflect on their mistakes. The tribal leaders all expressed that what they had done was wrong and were willing to accept punishment before returning.</p>

<p>According to a statement released by the Police Affairs Bureau, the surviving Xibao villagers who managed to escape the attack by the Tasha Awan are deeply worried that the enemy aborigines will return. The Japanese police officers are on guard all night, and the villagers' hearts are gradually calming down.</p>
<p>Bad Feelings Arise in Poland</p>
<p>Poland Asks to Send Troops into Danzig</p>

<p>The bad feelings between Poland and the Free City of Danzig are deepening. Poland is asking to send police or troops into Danzig to restore peace. The League of Nations Management Committee of the Free City of Danzig has refused because, according to League of Nations regulations, Poland can only send troops into Danzig's port in the event of military danger. Now that Danzig is peaceful, there is no need to seek help from Polish troops.</p>

<p>Here, extreme attention is being paid to the dispute between Poland and Danzig. A semi-official newspaper stated that Poland is good at using small things to create a huge uproar. This method of destroying European peace is particularly abominable. Furthermore, Poland has always used the sanctity of treaties as its slogan, but when it is beneficial to itself, it does not hesitate to violate them, going back on its word, which is truly chilling.</p>
<p>Japan-Russia Fisheries Negotiations</p>
<p>Ruble Issue Compromised</p>

<p>The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, flustered by the Shinano Maru's forced departure, has been forced to quickly resolve the ruble issue. Foreign Minister Shidehara visited Russian Ambassador Troyanovsky at the Russian embassy at 9:50 this morning to listen to instructions from the Moscow government. The Russian side conceded from 0.35 yen to 0.34 yen for the ruble exchange rate. The Japanese side advocated 0.36 yen, resulting in a compromise of 0.235 yen to pay the fishery area rent. The remaining amount for fishing will be negotiated separately.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 26th <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>According to information received by the Japanese authorities from Ambassador Hirota, the Russian side has no room for compromise on the ruble exchange rate beyond conceding from 0.35 yen to 0.34 yen. If this is the case, then the future of the negotiations will be uncertain again. According to Japanese fishermen, the Russian side is raising the usual exchange rate of 0.30 yen in an attempt to disrupt the Japan-Russia negotiations and delay a resolution, actually wanting Japanese fishermen to lose the fishing season in order to benefit their own country. The Shinano Maru's departure was apparently a trick by the Russian side to prevent the Japanese side from exercising its treaty-granted rights. This is a suitable measure to deal with this situation, strongly criticizing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' slow and weak attitude.</p>

<p>The crab fishing boat Shinano Maru of the Japan-Russia Fisheries Company pretended to be heading to Otaru, and when it reached the sea off Oni Island, it suddenly changed direction. Yesterday afternoon around 7:00 PM, it sailed at high speed towards the North Pacific Ocean off the Erimo Cape in southeastern Hokkaido. Managing Director Shindo of the Japan-Russia Fisheries Company said to people regarding this matter, "The Shinano Maru's sailing to the North Pacific is a predetermined action. Why would a crab fishing boat go to Otaru? There are no crabs to fish in Otaru. Furthermore, there is a danger of drifting ice when sailing through Otaru, making navigation difficult. Therefore, it changed direction. Even if a cruiser is sent to chase it back, it will still be too late. The ruble issue seems likely to be resolved soon, so it is first heading to the vicinity of the fishing grounds to await resolution. It is scheduled to start fishing once it receives a telegram approving it from the Russian consul. If it doesn't do this, it will lose the fishing season."</p>

<p>According to reliable sources, Prime Minister Brüning will soon make certain revisions to the Weimar Constitution and intends to submit the matter to the public and parliament for a vote. The most important part of this is probably raising the voting age from 20 to 25, as extremists often exploit young people who do not understand politics to expand their power. If the age is from 20 to 25, the proposal will be well received by the masses amid the current political turmoil and economic instability, and the number of members of parliament can therefore also be reduced.</p>

<p>It is reported that a week ago, the Spanish Archbishop gave a public speech, saying, "If the Republic is established, may God bring disaster to Spain." The Republican government is now investigating this matter and has formally negotiated with the Roman Catholic Church representative stationed in Spain. The Minister of Justice stated that the Archbishop did not actually say this, but the words he used could be considered an expression of disapproval of the Republican system. Therefore, he has negotiated with the Roman representative, hoping that Rome will not support an attitude that is contrary to the opinions of all Catholics in Spain. However, the government will in no way tolerate this kind of rebellious and improper attitude in the country.</p>

<p>All newspapers should be aware that the Confucian Forest and Temple in Qufu are the focus of attention at home and abroad. They have been preserved unchanged for more than two thousand years, which is why culture is valued. However, since the war last year, Qufu was unfortunately hit hard. The temple was destroyed by the war, and the tombs were also ruined. Furthermore, the Yanzi and Zhougong temples have become piles of rubble. Cherishing the style of the documents, there is no way to follow them. It is thought that Chinese cultural relics have always been known for their cultivation and brilliance. If we allow it to be deserted from now on, how can we obscure the teachings and promote the country's glory? Now, the comrades of the Joint Council have agreed to rebuild it and have telegraphed the central government to ask for assistance from Commanders-in-Chief Chiang and Chang, who replied and agreed to provide assistance. It is now planned to set up a preparatory committee for the restoration of the Confucian Temple and to repair the Confucian Forest, Temple, and the Zhou, Yan, Si, and Ji Temples to restore their original appearance. However, the project is huge and the cost is high, and independent restoration is truly unattainable. I have always admired your integrity and your promotion of Confucianism. I am sure that you will have sympathy. Please generously donate funds to help build the site and gather the resources for construction together. When the amount of donations is sufficient, we will ask the Central Bank to deposit it in order to prepare for construction. This will make the palace walls beautiful and wealthy, and comfort the thoughts of the high mountains, and make the sounds of music suitable for the preservation of ancient sites. In addition to preparing donation letters to be sent later, this telegram is sent first, awaiting your virtuous voice.

<p>Immediately Head to Harbin after Touring the Beiling</p>
<p>Reportedly to Stay Briefly in Harbin Before Going to Russia</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Hu Shih-tse, Director of the Asia Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, and Qian Tai, Counselor, appointed as special commissioners for the Sino-Soviet Conference on Commerce and Resumption of Relations, recently, because the third session of the Sino-Soviet Conference was held on the 11th in Moscow. After the Central Government received a telegram from Plenipotentiary Representative Mo Teh-hui continuing the details of the conference, the foreign affairs authorities, believing that the conference was actively underway, ordered the two special commissioners, Hu and Qian, to go to Russia immediately so that the two issues of commerce and resumption of relations could be discussed opportunely. It is said that the two special commissioners, Hu and Qian, also carried a newer plan on this trip to Russia. The two commissioners took the Beijing-Ping-Liaoning through train from Beijing to Shenyang at 7:00 AM on the 23rd. Mr. Hu was accompanied by his wife, and Secretary Lao Weixiu accompanied him. After Hu and his party got off the train, they went to the Linge Hotel on Sanjing Road in the commercial district. After a brief rest, they went to tour the scenic Beiling. They returned to the Linge Hotel around 3:00 PM. In the afternoon, at 3:30 PM, they took a rapid train on the South Manchurian Railway to Changchun and then to Harbin. During this trip through Shenyang, Hu and his party did not meet with any important figures except for touring Beiling. After Hu and his party arrived in Shenyang, the reporter visited the two special commissioners, Hu and Qian. In the rush to depart, they met with the reporter and said that they had taken the Beijing-Ping-Liaoning through train from Beijing on the 20th and stayed for a few hours to change trains in Tianjin, and then went north that day. They passed through Shenyang and took the route from Shenyang to Changchun to Harbin. They planned to stay in Harbin for four or five days and have some contact with related parties before going to Russia. There is no fixed date for returning home. Regarding the details of the Sino-Soviet Conference, there is no new news to report other than what has been published in the Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and other newspapers. Recently, before they left, the Central Government's diplomatic group held a meeting on the Sino-Soviet negotiation issue. The reporter was not aware of the details because they had already departed. The exact date of the fourth Sino-Soviet Conference, and whether Plenipotentiary Mo has reported in recent days, is also unknown. In conclusion, they were very sorry that they could not talk more due to the hurried departure. The reporter bid farewell, and Hu and his party then went to the South Manchurian Railway Station to board the train and leave Shenyang. (April 23rd, 4th day)</p>

<h3 id="e118">Sun Lianzhong Eliminates Bandit Nest in Zhaoxi <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jinyu's Troops Suppress Scattered Bandits in Baisha</p>
<p>Tan Daoyuan's Troops Destroyed the Foundation of the Bandit Groups</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Zhaoxi in Lean County, which borders Yihuang, Nanfeng, and Yongfeng, was occupied by Red bandits in previous years and was a well-known bandit nest. This time, when the 26th Route Army advanced from Yihuang and Lean County to suppress the bandits, the bandits there, led by Peng Dehuai and Gu Daozhong, stubbornly resisted by relying on the dangerous terrain. After Gao Shuxun and other divisions launched several attacks from Lean County, Zhaoxi and Zhanyuan were finally recovered. At the same time, Sun Lianzhong's 25th Division also occupied Hengshi between Yihuang and Lean County. Peng's bandits fled to the Qingli area. The remaining bandits near Zhaoxi were also eliminated. Currently, Commander Sun is stationed in Yihuang, and Division Commander Gao is stationed in Lean County to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>After Hao Mengling's division of the 5th Route Army, Wang Jinyu's troops, broke through the bandit nest of Tengtian Yaotian in Yongfeng, they advanced to Shimatoupi to patrol, while their 43rd Division expanded from Jishui to the Shuinan Baisha line to surround the north of Donggu. Chief He of the Military Affairs Committee received a telegram from Commander Wang, saying that the Red bandits of the Long Zhichuan unit in Baisha had been defeated by our patrol troops and were fleeing to Tantou and Longtoushan (northeast of Donggu). Our troops are currently tracking and pursuing them.</p>
<p>After Tan Daoyuan's division defeated the bandit groups in Qianka, they destroyed Kong's bandit's old nest in Yanxia. Tan sent a telegram to the province yesterday to report the victory, saying that our army encountered the pseudo-Independent 3rd Division in Qianka in the morning and used a portion of the troops to lure them into battle, while the main force launched a surprise attack on the Yanxia nest. The Red bandits' pseudo-3rd team and the Young Pioneers attacked our flanks. The officers and soldiers calmly responded and launched counterattacks, killing more than 100 bandits on the spot and seizing more than 20 rifles, 30 muskets, and horses, telephone sets, and luggage. The defeated bandits fled to Shazhoukou. The bandit nest was destroyed, and the pseudo-government, clothing factory, ordnance depot, 3rd and 4th labor cooperatives, Lenin Society, and Red Army Hospital were burned down, destroying the foundation of the Red bandits.

<p>Lu Dipin Goes to Beijing from Jiangxi</p>
<p>Wang Yinxi Serves as Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Tan Daoyuan Serves as Acting Commander of the 9th Route Army</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Lu Dipin, is now in urgent need of going to Beijing to participate in the opening of the National Assembly, and also needs to report to the Central Government on the political affairs, bandit suppression, aftermath, and the course of the 9th Route Army's combat reduction and reorganization, so he telegraphed the Central Government the other day to request a three-week leave to go to Beijing. Now Chairman Chiang has telegraphed his approval. Lu reported his travel schedule to Chief He at the Military Affairs Committee. The Provincial Affairs Meeting has appointed Wang Yinxi, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, as the acting chairman. Lu also telegraphed Fifty Division Commander Tan Daoyuan to return to the province to act as the commander of the 9th Route Army. Before Tan arrived, Chief of Staff Xie served as acting commander. At the same time, Luo, Chief of Staff, was commissioned to act as the head of the 18th Division headquarters. Lu, with all matters arranged, took the Nanchang-Xun flower car to Xun on the morning of the 24th and took a boat to Beijing. Accompanying him were the secretary of the 9th Route Army, Zhang Ling Zheng Yanping, and a telegrapher, adjutant, and a platoon of guards. It is said that Lu brought the Jiangxi Provincial Government Report and the 9th Route Army Report, and has the following tasks: (1) Report to Chiang on the political situation in Jiangxi Province, the bandit suppression military affairs, the tragic situation of bandit disasters, and the recent financial exhaustion (insufficient income, about 7-8 million yuan), and ask for relief. (2) Ask the National Government for instructions on the aftermath of Jiangxi Province. (3) Report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang on the course of the 9th Route Army's bandit suppression operations and the 18th and 50th divisions' compliance with the order to reduce and reorganize, and ask for supplementary training to make them a strong force. (4) Ask the Central Government to provide special subsidies for Jiangxi's administrative expenses, because the bandit areas in the province's 81 counties reach more than 70 counties, not only is there no income, but the aftermath of the newly conquered counties requires a lot of money, so there is no way other than to ask the Central Government for subsidies. (5) The bandit disasters in Jiangxi Province are severe and are the worst in the southeast. Lu will contact the Central Relief Committee and ask for a relief of 10 million to distribute to farmers. (6) Please ask the Central Government to issue post-disaster public bonds and road construction public bonds of about one million, so as to provide work as relief (24th)</p>

<p>New Discoveries in the Treatment of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Translated from a German Tuberculosis Sanatorium Magazine</p>
<h3 id="e120">What is the Tuberculosis Bacterium? <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The tuberculosis bacterium (i.e., 　　　) is a bacterium whose shape is straight or slightly curved, with a major axis of about one-millionth of a meter. It cannot be seen with the naked eye. Prepared as a stained specimen using a skilled technique according to a certain method, it can be seen under a microscope with a magnification of 600 to 1,000 times. It is truly a 　small kiss.</p>
<p>In ancient times, China named it the Tuberculosis Cough Worm. Now everyone knows that the tubercle bacillus is the worm of lung disease and does not belong to the animal kingdom. Our surroundings are filled with countless lower microorganisms, commonly known as organic microbes, which are invisible to the naked eye. These organic microbes are divided into two types: animal and plant. Those belonging to the animal type are called protozoa, and those belonging to the plant type are called mold. This lower plant mold belongs to a family of cryptogams without chlorophyll. Molds are further divided into three types according to shape and nature: "filamentous molds," "budding molds," and "splitting bacteria."</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Colonial Policy of Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The reproductive instinct of fission fungi is to divide itself, that is, to transform from one to two, from two to four, increasing day by day, hence the name "fission fungi." Humans and other animals often develop diseases due to this, hence they are called "pathogenic bacteria." Based on differences in shape, they are further divided into three types: "spherical fungi," "rod-shaped fungi," and "spiral fungi." Tuberculosis bacteria are rod-shaped bacteria among fission fungi.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis bacteria are most abundant in the sputum of lung disease patients, often increasing or decreasing depending on the severity of the patient's condition. According to Dr. Haijiao Leier of Germany, one piece of sputum from a lung disease patient contains 300 million tubercle bacilli. Therefore, a person who spits once an hour discharges 720 billion tubercle bacilli from their body into the air every day and night, constantly invading the world. But where do these numerous pathogenic bacteria come from? It is because the fission bacteria themselves have a fission function, as mentioned earlier, and they increase and multiply day by day. Therefore, it originally started as one fungus; later, it gradually divided, from one to two, from two to four, and so on, with the increasing power of proliferation. Now, let us assume that the speed of proliferation is one fission per hour. Within twenty-four hours, one bacterium has transformed into sixteen million. From this perspective, the following matters can be inferred:</p>
<p>(1) How vigorous is the reproductive power of fungi?</p>
<p>(2) Why do countless pathogenic bacteria occur in the patient's body?</p>
<p>(3) Why does the patient's sputum contain countless tubercle bacilli?</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Resistance of Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The resistance of tubercle bacilli is very strong. Knowing the extent of their resistance is crucial for the prevention and treatment of lung disease. When sputum from tuberculosis patients is exposed to air, the tubercle bacilli can survive for more than half a year. If placed in a dark room with little light, they can still survive for more than a year. These fungi are particularly resistant to cold. They can withstand temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius for six or seven weeks without dying. Their resistance to heat is also stronger than other fungi. Other fungi die after being exposed to a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius for 20-30 minutes, but these fungi require a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius for 20-30 minutes to die. However, their resistance to sunlight is quite weak. They die after being exposed to direct sunlight for five or six minutes and die in one or two minutes when exposed to heat above 100 degrees Celsius. Regarding disinfectants, tubercle bacilli from lung disease patients die in 20x carbolic acid water in 30 seconds; in 100x carbolic acid water in one minute; and in 1000x mercuric chloride water in ten minutes.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Tuberculosis Bacteria Dewaxing and Killing Method <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is tubercle bacilli. Once these bacteria enter the human body, they form nodules at that location, blocking blood flow. Moreover, tubercle bacilli can secrete an acid-resistant substance to surround their bodies, defending against the invasion of all external medicinal forces. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they ultimately cannot reach the actual bodies of the bacteria. The natural therapies, symptomatic therapies, physical therapies, serum therapies, drug therapies, and all other treatments that physicians have traditionally used have not been entirely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for consumption has spread throughout the world because people did not know this profound principle. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars have continued to research tirelessly based on the above-mentioned theories, and as a result, they have created this chemical panacea that can kill all tuberculosis bacteria, called Sanosin. This drug was invented following the latest medical theories of German Dr. Koch, the discoverer of tubercle bacilli, and German Dr. Berger, the inventor of the tubercle bacilli dewaxing technique. According to experimental reports from various lung disease sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of lung lesions and dissolving the waxy substance, and it also has bactericidal power and can radically cure stage 1, 2, and 3 lung diseases. It is indeed 10,000 times effective and miraculously effective. In China, the National Government's Central Hygiene Testing Laboratory has tested the drug and found it to be safe, non-toxic, and without any side effects. The therapeutic effects are briefly listed below:</p>
<p>(1) In experiments in test tubes, the medicinal power of "Sanosin" causes tubercle bacilli to disappear after one minute. After three minutes, the acid resistance is lost and the tubercle bacilli are completely killed without exception.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have found that "Sanosin" can penetrate the tubercle bacilli lurking in the lesions, completely eliminating their acid resistance. This is sufficient to prove the complete dissolution of the waxy substance.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they will immediately see good conditions such as thinning of sputum and lowering of body temperature.</p>
<p>(4) Continuous internal use of "Sanosin" for 30 to 60 days or more will clearly increase body weight, stimulate appetite, and gradually alleviate all symptoms, ultimately achieving the great feat of reviving life.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Military Police Conflict in Wuchang <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The garrison brigade and security regiment exchanged gunfire</p>
<p>One pedestrian killed and several injured</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that a conflict occurred in Shouyi Park, Wuchang, on the 25th of this month between the Hubei garrison brigade and the security regiment. Both sides exchanged gunfire, killing one pedestrian and injuring several others. The circumstances of the incident are as follows: the garrison brigade was stationed at Xindi and recently received orders to return to Wuhan. Brigade Commander Rong Jingfang led the troops. On the 24th, most of the troops had arrived and were stationed at Majubuju, the Ordnance Bureau, and other places. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the 5th and 8th companies of the 2nd regiment of the brigade were watching a play at the Shouyi Park theater when a dispute occurred with the 7th company of the security regiment, which was responsible for guarding the park. The dispute soon dispersed. However, at 1:00 PM on the 25th, Liu Yushan, the attached company commander of the 7th company of the security regiment, led 16 armed soldiers and one squad leader to the theater to maintain order. Many soldiers from the 5th company of the garrison brigade also arrived, and the two sides clashed, causing great disorder. Company Commander Liu immediately telegraphed the regimental headquarters to dispatch more than 20 armed soldiers from the 7th company, led by Deputy Regiment Commander Wu Changxu, to suppress the situation from the top of the park mountain at Doujiying. However, dozens of soldiers from the 6th company of the 2nd regiment of the garrison brigade also arrived. Gunfire erupted, and the situation became extremely tense. An elderly woman surnamed Liu was killed, and three civilians were injured. Afterward, the security regiment reported to the provincial government and the garrison headquarters, stating that "the garrison brigade seized two Type 79 rifles from the regiment's patrol team, damaged one, and the regiment also captured nine garrison brigade soldiers on the spot: He Kunshan, Yang Shuming, Meng Wenqi, Chen Zhanbiao, Xu Yulin, Xiang Junbo, Guan Honghua, He Liang, Lin Yishu, Lian Deng, and nine rank badges, seven armbands, six bullets, and one grenade base, which were collected by the regimental headquarters. In addition, the 9th company of the regiment, stationed at the Pinghu Gate and Shouyi Park, had more than 20 rifles confiscated and more than ten soldiers captured by the garrison brigade troops, and they also dispatched troops to guard the Hanyang Gate area," etc. Wu Muni, the chairman of the recreation ground's board of directors, also reported the incident to the Wuchang Garrison District Commander for investigation. It is reported that Director He was very angry about the incident and decided to thoroughly investigate the situation and severely punish the perpetrators. The Garrison Command has also sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation for reporting purposes (25th).</p>
<h3 id="e126">Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang Go to Beiping to Visit Zhang Zuolin to Handle Post-War Matters in Shanxi <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Rong Honglu Discusses the Results of His Trip to Shenyang</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The post-war situation in Shanxi has not made much progress. Some generals recently went to Shenyang together to appeal for military funds. Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang recently went to Beiping to visit Zhang Zuolin for assistance. The future of Shanxi depends greatly on this trip by Shang and Xu. According to Shang and Xu's pre-departure statements, they seem to have great determination regarding military expenditures this time. If military funds are not secured for even one day, the people of Shanxi will have to bear the burden of supplying the military. Other extractions and the invisible losses to the people are even more difficult to calculate. Since Yan Xishan left Shanxi, each county in southern and eastern Shanxi has provided military expenses ranging from more than one million to at least four or five hundred thousand. The suffering of the people can be imagined.</p>
<p>Rong Honglu, who went to Shenyang to visit Zhang Zuolin, returned to Taiyuan yesterday. According to his remarks, he visited Zhang four times before and after his arrival in Shenyang. Zhang left Fengtian (Shenyang) for Tianjin. Zhang said that the post-war settlement in Shanxi regarding military pay of one million to cover demobilization costs is now no longer a problem. Once all the procedures are completed, the money can be allocated. Regarding other pay, Zhang has expressed his sincere intention verbally and is actively planning. Although it is impossible to say when the money will be allocated, observing Zhang's attitude, it is entirely possible to raise it. Zhang is also very concerned about financial matters, but Zhang himself has no specific proposals on how to handle them. The most he can do is appeal to the central government to restore public bonds. Zhang has directly interceded with the central government to alleviate the situation. All the systems of the Garrison Department will be directly under the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. However, for the sake of facilitating contact, he will consult with the provincial government when necessary to carry out everything. Although the organizational content is not yet determined, it is generally not much different from the Garrison Headquarters. As for the Garrison Division, it is internally divided into two brigades and six regiments. The selection of personnel has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Wang Jingguo said that since the reorganization of the Jin-Sui Army, in order for the army commanders to report the reorganization process to Deputy Commander Zhang after the inspections by the Central Government and the Northeast, Commander Sun Cuiai, Artillery Supervisor Zhou Dai, Division Commander Feng Pengzhu, Division Commander Li Muyan, and Division Commander Yang Yaofang went to Shenyang to visit the Deputy Commander. It is speculated by outsiders that they went to the Deputy Commander to request reorganization fees and military expenses, but this is just conjecture by outsiders because Commander Sun, Division Commanders Feng and Li are responsible for military expenses and reorganization fees. Commanders Sun, Feng and Li recently telegraphed that they had left Shenyang and started their journey back to Shanxi on Hao Chen (date not specified). It is estimated that they will arrive in Beiping yesterday (20th). Once Chairman Shang and Military Commander Xu arrive in Beiping, Sun, Feng, Li, Yang and Zhou will be able to return to Shanxi. Military Commander Xu also started from Taiyuan this noon. The date for Division Commander Li Shengda, Division Commander Yang Xiaoou and his brothers (Wang's self-designation) to go to Beiping will be determined after Sun, Feng, Li, and Yang return. Army Commander Yang Chengyuan will postpone his departure due to defense issues. Army Commander Yang Ai Yuan will not be able to leave Taiyuan because he is in charge of Shanxi's military affairs. In the future, after Chairman Shang or Military Commander Xu return, Yang will be able to go to Beiping. Currently, the issues we most hope to resolve are military expenses and finances. This visit to the Deputy Commander by Shang and Xu should allow them to request specific solutions to these issues (22nd).</p>

<p>Forty-Seven Cities and Counties Qualified to Elect</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: In Shanxi Province, apart from the party member elections in 13 counties, which the provincial party headquarters has telegraphed to limit reporting by the 23rd of this month, registration of people's organizations in other counties and cities ended uniformly at 12:00 PM the day before yesterday (20th). However, the elections in Yangcheng, Qinshui, Lingchuan, Yuxiang, and Sixian did not arrive on schedule and have been declared invalid. According to statistics, a total of 97 cities and counties out of 108 cities and counties in Shanxi Province submitted voter lists. After review, only 51 cities and counties were deemed qualified. Now, excluding the four counties of Qinshui, only 47 cities and counties actually participated. A total of more than 130,000 ballots were issued. Based on the total population of 13 million in the province, approximately one in every hundred people obtained the right to vote. The election results office completed the statistics last night, but for the sake of prudence, it is planned to formally announce the results after a second review. It is reported that the Provincial Party Headquarters has decided on the executive committee members for the party member elections: Han Kewen and Hu Biyue. Among others in the education sector and people's liberal professional organizations, Wang Luxun, president of Shanxi University, and Su Tiren are the most promising. In agricultural associations, Liu Kuijiu, president of the Agricultural College, and Wu Zhenduo and Zhao Xuan are the most promising. In chambers of commerce, Wang Xian and Song Chunru are the most promising. The provincial office has already prepared matters concerning the representatives going to Beijing. The Provincial Party Headquarters and various people's organizations have jointly established a National Assembly Propaganda Committee, which will hold a National Assembly Propaganda Week from May 1st to 7th and hold a celebration rally on the opening day of the National Assembly. The preparatory committee is actively preparing (April 22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e128">Severe Flooding in the Han River in Eastern Guangdong <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Many Dikes Below Chaoan Have Collapsed</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The mountains east of the Dayu Ridge on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi rapidly approach northern Fujian and connect with the Thirty-Six Peaks of Mount Wuyi. All the waters north and east of this ridge converge at Sanheba in Dapu, forming the Han River. The Han River flows through Fengshun and Chaoan from Sanhe, then splits into several branches that run through Jieyang and Chenghai counties, exiting into the sea. The Han River, from Sanhe downstream to above Chaoan City for more than 200 li, becomes a single channel with a large flow. Both banks are high mountains composed of yellow soil, with pine and bamboo widely planted on the mountains, forming natural forest farms. The yellow soil is eroded by the water year by year, flowing down below Chaoan City and accumulating in the riverbed. The riverbed gradually becomes higher than the plains. Chenghai counties are all plains, the most fertile and the richest in agricultural products. Since the riverbed is high and there are no barren mountains on both sides, the farmers built dikes to protect against the water. The north dike is more than 30 feet above the ground, extending from outside the north gate of Chaoan to Yixi Station, about 4 li long. If the Han River water is higher than the dike or unfortunately collapses, the Chaojie area will become a swamp. This year, since the beginning of spring, it has been raining continuously, with no sunshine for hundreds of days. Mountain water on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi erupted and rushed to the Han River, flowing to the sea. On the 16th, the Han River water was vast, carrying yellow mud and fences downstream. On the 18th, the east, south, and north gates of Chaoan City were all flooded, with the east gate being the most severely flooded. Thirteen wooden boards were quickly lowered to the gate to block the water. Steamships and sailboats stopped running due to the rapid current and were docked outside the Shangshui Gate Bamboo Wood Gate, with mooring ropes tied to the battlements of the city wall. From the boats, the city could be looked down upon. The water level downstream of the Han River rose eight or nine feet, directly impacting the dikes of Chenghai. Yuzhou, Outing, Dongdun, and Fulong all became swamps, and agricultural crops were severely damaged. The Shantou-Chenghai Road has been closed since the 16th, and electric ferries to Chenghai have also been suspended due to the rapid water. On the 19th, more than 100 zhang of the Xiapu Bridge on the Shantou-Chenghai Road, Chenghai shore, was washed away by the water. Sections of the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway below Anbu, Yuepu, Qishan, and Xinxiang were submerged in a sea of water. At the Huawu and Huilan bridges in Shantou, where the river water flows into the sea, the water roared like thunder and ten thousand horses galloping. Two salt boats were swept away by the water, losing about 3,000 dan of salt.</p>
<p>On the 20th and 21st, haze filled the air and the rain did not stop. The sad and miserable atmosphere filled the world. The Chaoan North Dike was already in a dangerous state. The Han River roared, and the waves rose and fell. Chaoan County Magistrate Ruan personally inspected the North Dike and prepared iron bars, fir wood, and workers to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. On the 21st, various charitable halls and the detective team leader in Chaoan guarded the north and south dikes. Huang Jianjin was responsible for the North Dike, and Ke Mao Zhang was responsible for the South Dike, with three police officers overseeing. On the night of the 21st, the dikes in the Jiangqu and Jianggui districts sent out emergency warnings that water was penetrating the culverts and flooding the entire township. More than 3,000 able-bodied men rushed to the rescue, fortunately averting disaster. The East Gate had already lowered 14 boards, with water filling nine boards. On the opposite bank, more than ten zhang of the Dongjin Dike were washed away, and there were many leaks in the north and south dikes. Coal gas lamps were lit in many places on both dikes, and the able-bodied men of each township braved the rain, sitting on the banks to guard. The Longhou Dike in Chenghai collapsed, and the fields were a sea of water. The major dikes of Donghupu and Mei also overflowed. Chenghai County Magistrate Huang Guoliang supervised thousands of civilians to guard them. As of noon today (22nd), the rain had not stopped and the thunder rumbled, the sky was as dark as lacquer, and it is unknown how the dike guards were suffering in the rain (22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e129">Airplane Show at the Aviation Conference <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The secretariat of the Aviation Conference, in order to increase the aviation interest of members and the public, invited Chinese and foreign aviators to perform flying techniques at the Ming Palace airfield from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday, and Deputy Captain Ding Jixu of the Sixth Aviation Team jumped with an insurance umbrella. Notices were issued to various organizations, groups, and schools in advance, and advertisements were published to invite people from all walks of life to visit. Yesterday, about a thousand people from all walks of life went to visit. The main entrance of the airfield, which is usually prohibited from passing, was specially opened yesterday. Inside and outside the gate were covered with various colored slogans. Dozens of airplanes were arranged along the east side of the airfield. The viewing areas for guests, members, and groups were marked separately with white chalk lines, and the public was in the southeastern corner, with officers and aviation class students divided into shifts to direct and entertain, and the order was well maintained. First, aviation class instructors Shi Mansheng and Li Ruibin and one student each drove Morse aircraft and took off one after another, scattering colored leaflets from the air, which fell all over the airfield. The leaflets were printed with various slogans of the Aviation Conference, and the crowds scrambled to pick them up. Soon after, the three Morse aircraft landed one after another. Immediately, Ding Jixu, the attached captain of the Sixth Aviation Team, alone drove a high-powered Cossack fighter plane into the air, circling the field once, then opening the throttle to perform stunts. First, he made a small turn, during which the fuselage was sideways in the air. Next, he made a somersault, with the fuselage flipping upwards, going around to the rear. Next, he made a "tearing split" (Slsiu), with the fuselage standing upside down in the air and the wings circling around the fuselage like a windmill, causing the audience to gasp in amazement. After a while, Yan Yucong, the captain of the First Aviation Team, and Mao Bangchu, the chief flying instructor of the Aviation Class, also drove similar Cossack aircraft into the air, performing formation flying together with Ding Jixu's aircraft. The three aircraft were very close to each other, flying in a wedge formation, resembling a flock of geese. Next, British aviators Xiawei and Xie Erjun successively drove British aircraft, Yaviang and Flitidy, into the air, each performing stunts, each doing their best. Next, American aviators Anlisheng and Fu Ang drove Fei Erkang and Funajilin aircraft to form a formation flight, their formation changes were extremely agile. Next, they each performed stunts separately before landing. Finally, German aviator Li Cider drove a Junkers A47 aircraft, this aircraft had the largest horsepower and the loudest sound. It was an all-metal low-wing, twin-rudder aircraft in sea green color, shaped extremely strong. Mr. Li has performed many times in Beijing, and his performances are amazing to watch. Yesterday's performance was even more outstanding, such as not ascending against the wind, but deliberately ascending with the wind, and suddenly turning the fuselage upwards when running from the starting point to three or four hundred meters. Also, the "tearing split" he performed was the most urgent and the most numerous. The low-altitude flights skimmed over people's heads several times, and the fuselage was arbitrarily flipped left and right, straight up and down in the air, making all kinds of dangerous situations that made people gasp in amazement. After the stunt flying performance was over, Attached Team Captain Ding Jixu performed the insurance umbrella jump. Chief Instructor Mao Bangchu and Ding drove the Cossack aircraft into the air and gradually turned to the sky just north of Hongwu Gate. At this time, the height of the aircraft was more than 3,000 feet. Suddenly, Ding was seen like a black dot detaching from the aircraft and falling. After about three seconds, the insurance umbrella opened leisurely and slowly drifted in the wind for about six or seven minutes, safely landing in the wheat field at the foot of the city wall. For a time, the crowd cheered, all admiring Ding's excellent technique and his bravery. It is reported that Zhang Huichang, the director of the Aviation Administration, has specially added one month's salary to Ding to express his encouragement.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Jiangsu Provincial Government Plans to Open a New Port at Xiangshan <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Restore and Prosper the Industrial and Commercial Center of the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Zhenjiang was once an important town of Jingkou and is now the capital of Jiangsu Province. Last year, its population exceeded 180,000. It is located at the crossroads of land and water transportation, with favorable transportation conditions. Industry and commerce once flourished extremely. However, since the shift of canal transport to sea transport and the completion of the Jinpu Railway, the transportation center has moved accordingly. In recent years, the original wharves have been severely affected by sandbars, and ships cannot dock, causing the industry and commerce to decline sharply. When the provincial government moved to Zhenjiang two years ago, the Water Conservancy Bureau measured the area of Zheng Runzhou and the depth of the Yangtze River, planning to remedy the old wharf. However, the plan failed to proceed due to the bureau's instability and lack of funds. Subsequently, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau measured the water depth and terrain of the Jiang River bank between Xiangshan and Beigushan and compared it with the maps produced by the customs over the years, and decided to build a new port at Xiangshan in Zhenjiang and open a new market in order to restore and prosper the industry and commerce of the provincial capital. The detailed plan has been submitted by the Construction Department and passed by the Provincial Government's 391st meeting last week, and work has begun. The following is a summary of the new port plan:</p>
<h3 id="e131">(A) Port Area <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>East from Xiangshan to Dajiaochang, north to the deep Hong of the Yangtze River, and south to Huashan as a barrier, the area has a total area of about three square kilometers. To sum up, its advantages in design are six: (1) This area is flat arable land connected to the old city market and is very close to the South Gate Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, which can be used to build cargo lines directly to the pier. (2) The ground is vast and can reap the benefits of flat land construction. (3) A large amount of land can be pre-emptively acquired at a low price for public buildings such as roads, ports, rivers, ponds, and warehouses. (4) The design can be comprehensively planned, and the construction can be implemented in stages. (5) The roads in the area are easy to connect with the old city. (6) In the future, the urban area will prosper, and it can develop south to the South Railway Station and east even more broadly.</p>
<h3 id="e132">(B) Overview of Equipment <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>(Zi) The urban area has a total area of ​​more than three square kilometers. It is estimated that it can be divided into three parts: more than 10,000 acres are allocated to public piers and commercial areas, that is, the central and western parts of the area; more than 4,800 acres are allocated to industrial areas, that is, the eastern part of the area; and more than 15,400 acres are allocated as forest garden residential areas, that is, the mountainous areas around Huashan and Beigushan. (Chou) Wharf construction is divided into lighter boats, river boats, boat ponds, railways, and cargo depots. (Yin) A branch line is built from the Zhenjiang South Gate Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Line, crossing Huashan and reaching the Jiang River bank pier, and another branch line runs along the Jiang River Avenue and the river bank of the boat river. Both end at the western end of the boat river. (Mao) The roads use crushed stone as the road surface. Its three main lines connecting the outside of the area connect with the Jiang River Avenue in the old city via the waist of Beigushan Mountain, and one connects with Zhongzheng Road in the city via the mountain depression of Beigushan Beicheng, directly reaching the Grand Market, and one connects directly to Beimen and Zhongshan Road in the city. The road width is 18 meters. With these three main lines, none of the main avenues in the old city are not connected to the roads in the new city, that is, there are convenient connections everywhere between the old and new areas. (Chen) The cargo depot is a one-story warehouse building with a total area of ​​28,000 square meters. If the average volume of each cubic meter is one ton, the applicable volume of the cargo depot can store 50,000 tons of cargo at the same time. Even if the total tonnage of cargo entering and leaving the port annually is around 5 million tons, it can be handled with ease.</p>
<h3 id="e133">(C) Project Expenses <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>(1) The estimated cost of the urban area filling project is 364,000 yuan. (2) The estimated cost of the wharf project is 596,490 yuan. (3) The estimated cost of the road project is 284,512 yuan. (4) The estimated cost of the cargo depot construction is 364,000 yuan. The total cost of the four items is 1,609,000 yuan, all of which will be allocated from the construction public bonds. The construction costs of the railway and railway bridges should belong to the railway bureau and are not included.</p>

<p>A male corpse, already decomposed, was found in the river outside Guanmiao Lane a few days ago. The head was covered with a purse and the body was tied with a rope. After the court sent personnel to examine it, it was buried in a coffin. Subsequently, the detective team found out that the deceased's name was Gu Gengtu and he was killed by his elder brother Gu Jinshou. Gu Jinshou was arrested and confessed that the deceased was indeed his younger brother. Because he had forcibly borrowed money from him last winter, he harbored resentment. That night, he stayed at home and strangled Gengtu with a rope while he was asleep at midnight and dumped the body in the river. Yesterday, the murderer Gu Jinshou was escorted by the Public Security Bureau to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Bandit Captured on Train Escorted to Beijing for Interrogation <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The 26th slow train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Beijing-Wuxi section, was passing Xiaoshan at 6:00 p.m. on the 21st of this month when Inspector Zhang Hong, who was traveling with the train, together with the military police on the train, shot and killed Zhang Jianxun, a bandit with a gun, in the carriage and captured three bandits, Zhang Erlou, Kai Zao, and Chen Shikui, who were escorted to the 4th Regiment headquarters in Wuxi for interrogation. It is now learned that yesterday, Deputy Officer Wang interrogated the bandits again. The two bandits, Zhang Lou and Zhang Er, have confessed that they and six others planned to take the train to Longtan to rob a certain family. The other three took the opportunity to escape when the shooting occurred. Liang Zhaoxian was the instigator of this matter.

The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Qian Sunqing, announced on the spot that since a portion of the creditors had objections, the liquidation should be suspended from today and each creditor should proceed separately.</p>

<p>Zhou Zengfu, a rent collector (specializing in collecting rent and seeds for others) from Zhijiacun, Xintangkou, near Da Maojiaqiao outside the Shuibei Gate, is 72 years old and has two sons and a grandson. His family has a considerable amount of savings, which has been coveted by bandits. At about 5:00 a.m. on the 24th, five or six bandits came to the Zhou family and knocked on the door. Zengfu's grandson got up to open the door. As soon as the door was opened, many bandits rushed in and shouted for help. Zengfu heard the sound and fled outside. His grandson also ran out and shouted to catch the thief. The neighbors were awakened and came to catch the bandits. The bandits, fearing encirclement, howled and fled with the stolen goods. After checking, it was found that cash, foreign clothes, etc., worth about 200 yuan were robbed. In addition, there were many sailing ships traveling between this county and Luyuan. At about 3:00 a.m. on the 24th, a sailing ship was passing the Hujiao area outside the Ximen Gate when it suddenly encountered two bandit ships. The bandits were armed and blocked the sailing ship's way. They swarmed onto the ship, and the crew resisted and were beaten. Then they searched each passenger, and no one was spared. The loss was estimated at 800 to 900 yuan. At that time, a sailing ship from Xinzhuang Port was also sailing from the countryside and passed by here. It was also ordered to dock and the bandits divided up the ship and searched it thoroughly. As a result, cash and clothing bags worth about 1,000 yuan were lost. In addition, on the 13th, a Wang family passenger ship arrived at Wang Niqiao, Xinqiaobin River, Yuanhe District, and stayed there overnight. Unexpectedly, at midnight, a boat carrying several bandits robbed the Wang ship, resulting in a loss of more than 200 yuan and one crew member being stabbed.</p>

The number of participating schools and the number of people have broken the record of previous joint sports meets in the city, and among the sports events, there are also places where national records have been broken. It can be seen that the schools in the city have all known to pay attention to physical education and sports, and do not regard it as an unimportant kind of course, whether it is available or not, whether it is wanted or not. And the students usually understand the importance of physical education in school and pay attention to practice to have such achievements that can create new national records. This is a good sign that the city's physical education is progressing day by day. Although it rained a little on the second day of these three days, and it seemed that the sky was not very beautiful, the athletes were still in good spirits and did not slack off because of this.

<p>Zhang Pingxian sets national record with 7.3 seconds in women's 50m preliminary.</p>
<p>Rare achievements are nothing more than the result of diligent training. At last year's Far Eastern Games, our country suffered many defeats. However, as the saying goes, "Don't be angry, just remember." As long as we practice patiently and persistently, there is no reason why we cannot avenge ourselves. Although the athletic performance at this city-wide middle school joint sports meet seems to be better than before, it is still hoped that everyone will continue to work harder and practice tirelessly, striving to win championships in international sports arenas. Because sports are not just a matter of one city or one country, but also of international importance. From a small perspective, it is indeed related to the development of physical education and the health of individuals, and thus to individual hygiene and longevity. However, extending this further, it is also closely related to the strength of the nation and its position and honor in the international arena. Today, I come to distribute prizes, and my heart is filled with an indescribable joy and delight. Now, I would like to congratulate all the winners on their victories. However, to those who did not win prizes, I sincerely hope that they will not be discouraged. Didn't I say earlier, "Don't be angry, just remember." Moreover, there is no certainty in victory and defeat. Victory and defeat are commonplace in military affairs. The prizes themselves are inanimate objects and cannot favor certain individuals. Each time, they will always end up in the hands of a few specific people. All those who did not win prizes this time should continue to work hard and practice every day without interruption. If they can do this, I am confident that they will be able to turn defeat into victory and win prizes in the next sports meet. The ancients said, "An iron ruler can be ground into an embroidery needle." Just imagine, if an iron ruler, which is so thick and large, can be ground into a small embroidery needle, how much easier are things like sports? As long as you put in some effort, there is no way you will not succeed. The so-called "Where there is a will, there is a way" is exactly what this victory is about. Those who have won prizes should not become complacent. They must continue to work hard and practice, just like those who have failed this time, and even more so. Only then can they maintain their past glory, retain the prizes they have won, and have hope of winning prizes in the future. Otherwise, like a firecracker, it will make a loud noise and then be gone. Why would one be satisfied with that? These are a few words I want to say to everyone before distributing the prizes. Now, I will begin giving out the prizes according to the list.</p>

<p>The results of all events in this competition are quite remarkable, and the breaking of national records in women's high jump and long jump is especially noteworthy.

<p>The three-day event was successfully conducted with the efforts and assistance of all parties, resulting in a satisfactory conclusion. The Shanghai Hospital rescue team was present for rescue and care on the third day. For example, if a player was injured in the pole vault, they received treatment. The order of the conference was maintained by the East Asia and Guangzhao Boy Scouts for three days, which was very hard work. Yesterday, Chengzhong Middle School performed various apparatus exercises and acrobatics, with quick and exciting movements that were greatly appreciated by the audience. The various medals of the conference were manufactured by the Standard Sports Equipment Company and were exquisite and lovely. Furthermore, the conference specially made a large number of bean paste dumplings every day to reward the staff of the conference, but the staff were very busy serving.</p>

<p>Today at 6 PM at the West YMCA</p>
<p>Over the years, the Shanghai YMCA has cultivated many handball talents, both seniors and rising stars. It is a pity that various community organizations have paid little attention to this sport and its facilities, resulting in few challenges being answered, which has affected the development of players' skills. Fortunately, the West YMCA has agreed to have a competition between the two associations once a month, with three groups each of singles and doubles. However, those joining the singles group may not join the doubles group. The arrangement of the YMCA players for the competition is as follows: (1) Singles group: Zhu Kuan, Hong Yukui, Sun Daosheng, Xu Changfa, Yan Zhaorong. (2) Doubles group: Hong Rulin, Huang Kesu, Cheng Zhenhua, Luo Shunda, Chen Wentao, Yu Xiangsheng, Ni Hongen, Qu Zhenhu, Lu Aibai, etc. It is said that all members have been coming to the court for daily practice to prepare for the battle and show off their skills. Please read tomorrow's newspaper for the results. Those who wish to visit must register with the YMCA's sports department before 12 PM.</p>

<p>Berliners have recently been infected with the American habit of making phone calls. The city has a total of 472,000 telephones, and there are 1.3 million calls made every day.</p>
<p>Although the treatment of university professors in England and the United States is better than that of educators in the East, and those with special knowledge are world-renowned, their salaries are still inferior to other professions. Very few of them can earn 1,500 pounds a year.</p>
<p>The British Museum in London has an average of 800 people reading in the reading room every day.</p>
<p>According to a survey by British sociologists, the total number of slaves in the world who have lost their personal freedom is no less than four million.</p>
<p>The number of divorced men and women in the United States is exactly offset by the number of newly married men and women. For example, if ten people get married, ten people get divorced. Overall, the number of marriages is decreasing day by day, while the number of divorces is increasing day by day.</p>

<p>Spring flowers have the widest range of uses. Lilac can be used for powder, peony can be used in medicine, camellia can be used for hairdressing, crabapple can be used to make honey, redbud can be used as a bed, peony can be used to cover houses, rose can be used to make water, daphne can be used for tea, sweet-scented osmanthus can be used to brew wine, poppy can be used to cook porridge, cymbidium can be used to induce childbirth, wisteria can be used to make incense boxes, mimosa can be used as a pillow, Chinese flowering crabapple can be used to make bait, and hibiscus can be used for hair ornaments. The various spring flowers bloom at different times, so their uses are also different.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Anecdotes After the Daji Disaster <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The Daji steamship of the Dada Shipping Company was burned in Longjusha, Jiangbei, with countless crew and passenger deaths. According to the latest investigation, the Zhang Huanggang Public Security Bureau recovered 398 corpses, the Xinshenggang recovered 11 corpses, and the Xingang recovered another 5 corpses. More than 210 people were rescued and returned to Shanghai by specially dispatched ships and fishing boats. Another 7 people died from the cold after being rescued, so the total death toll reached more than 411, which is a major disaster. It is said that among these victims, there were some who made a fortune because of it. A certain person, with great courage, when the fire broke out on the ship, the passengers were only concerned with their lives, and money was nothing more than an external thing, thinking that it was a burden, so they untied everything they had on their bodies, leaving only their shirts and pants, and then jumped into the water, fearing that heavy clothes and too much money would prevent them from floating on the water to wait for rescue. This person relied on his good swimming skills to take the foreign bills of everyone and put them in his arms, swam away, and survived, thus making a fortune. Also, at that time, the passengers not only untied everything they had on their bodies, but also threw their boxes and cages into the water in groups, and people clung to them to avoid sinking. Who would have thought that the fishermen were cruel and took the objects with bamboo poles without saving people. Those who clung to the objects and tried to float were pushed into the water, causing many deaths, which was no different from being killed by the fishermen. Afterwards, three fishermen were arrested and shot, which everyone applauded. There was also a strange incident. A passenger named Mou Yi hid 2,400 yuan in banknotes. After entering the water, he floated up and down near a fishing boat. He asked the fishing boat for help, saying that he had money. The fisherman immediately helped him onto the boat and asked how much he had. Mou Yi truthfully told him and offered to split it evenly. The fisherman ordered him to take it out and count it. There was no mistake. He was not satisfied with splitting it evenly and wanted to swallow it all. He carried Mou Yi into the sea and pushed him into the water when he was not paying attention, and then he died. The next day at midnight, his son suddenly dreamed that Mou Yi told him about the murder and told his son to avenge him. He could visit a fisherman surnamed Wang, and the banknotes were still on the boat and would not deny it. His son woke up in shock and went to the scene of the accident as he said. He asked about the Wang surname fishing boat, and everyone said that there was one that had not been seen for a day and did not know where it had gone. While he was asking and answering, everyone suddenly pointed to a boat and said, "Here it is! Here it is! It's that boat!" His son hurriedly boarded the boat and dragged the person on the boat to the government, accusing him of his father's dream. The person on the boat did not admit it, so he searched his boat and found 2,400 yuan in banknotes, so he was able to confirm it. The official continued to interrogate him, and he finally confessed to the matter. In this era of scientific enlightenment, whether there are ghosts or not is still a matter of debate among spiritualists. This is indeed an excellent research material.</p>

<h3 id="e194">A Trip to Dongting Lake <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>In this spring day, with the gentle breeze, reading the old saying "Don't let the good spring days pass, the hardest thing is the wind and rain of old friends", the desire to travel arises. Therefore, I invited Jin Binglan, Jin Meisheng, Chen Junbei, Qian Fusheng, and others to travel to Dongting Lake. On the 9th of the month, we arrived at Suzhou by early train and stayed at the Dongwu Hotel. The next day, we took the Baoxing boat to Hengxi and landed to visit the Hengxi School. The principal, Mr. Jin Bofu, warmly welcomed us. The school was well-organized, with a library equipped with various magazines and novels for students to browse after class. There was also a public reading room with Shenbao, Xinwenbao, Wuxian Daily, Mingbao, and City-Township Public Gazette for people to read. Hengxi's municipal administration has been greatly renovated compared to last year, and commerce is developed and the population is dense. In the afternoon, we changed to a gasoline boat to Lianxi Town to visit Cai Lian Tang. It is said that during the Warring States period, King Wu favored Xi Shi, and this was where lotus flowers were picked in those years. There is Cai Lian Bridge, and the traces of King Wu seem to be still faintly discernible. That night, we stayed at Jinjiafang. At dawn, we hired a folk boat and went straight to Dongting. After six hours, we arrived at Longtou Mountain, which has a large stone cave called Long Cave. It is more than ten feet wide and about five feet high. The cave is dark, and you can only enter with the help of candlelight. Cowards dare not enter. According to the mountain people, there are three entrances to this cave, and there are stone benches, stone tables, and stone beds. Outside the cave, a stone tablet is inscribed with "Ninth Cave in the World" by Mr. Yu Quyuan. We then went to Piaomiao Peak. The mountain road is winding and rugged, and it is not easy to walk. After two hours, we reached the top of the mountain. Looking out, the Taihu Lake is the same color as the sky, and the waves undulate like ten thousand horses galloping. It is indeed a spectacle. After walking dozens of steps, we arrived at Shigon Mountain, which has a Guiyun Cave. A statue of Guanshiyin is enshrined in the cave, next to a couplet saying "Clouds stack thousands of layers at the mouth of Guiyun Cave, the moon circles over Mingyue Bay". To the east is Cuiyun Xuan, a small building with a corner and a secluded scenery, built by Mr. Feng Xingcun, a famous scholar of the Ming Dynasty. Above it is Laihe Pavilion, with cliffs on both sides. We climbed up the stone steps, facing south from the mountain, to Sunset Cave. There is an inverted tower in the cave, which is extremely dangerous. Above Sunset Cave is a line of sky, more than ten feet deep. We ventured forward and reached its peak. It was getting late, so we hurriedly took the original boat back to Lianxi, which was already lit with thousands of lights. The next day, we returned to Shanghai and wrote this down to leave a footprint.</p>

<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Mr. Su Kan, the master of Hai Cang Tower, never casually commented on the calligraphy and paintings of his contemporaries. However, he highly praised the flowers and birds painted by Ma Mengrong, saying, "The essence of realistic painting lies in distinguishing between elegance and vulgarity. Works filled with intention are often elegant, while those brimming with vigor tend to be vulgar. Modern people love to imitate He Shaoji and Cang Shuo, whose forceful style I often find questionable. When I look at the works of Wu Rangzhi and Li Futang, they are exceptionally refined and extraordinary. Mr. Mengrong is a close acquaintance of Rangzhi and Futang, as discerning individuals recognize." He also inscribed the two characters "Rong Zhai" as a gift to him. Mr. Zeng Nongran once said, "Among contemporary flower and bird painters, Mengrong should be praised for his elegant brushwork, demonstrating his specialized learning." Both Zheng and Zeng were senior figures in the art world, and their praise for Mengrong speaks volumes about the divine quality of his works. Mr. Cai Yuanpei once remarked, "The difference between the literati and the academy styles in our country lies in the fact that the works of literati are mostly lively in spirit and convey profound meaning, but excessive freedom can lead to looseness. The works of the academy are mostly precise in their ruled-line paintings and meticulously realistic in their depictions, but excessive restraint can lead to rigidity. Mr. Mengrong strikes a balance between the two styles, adopting the strengths of both, resulting in outstanding and artistically valuable works." Li Shu'an, a respected elder in calligraphy and painting, said, "Mengrong's paintings draw inspiration from nature and integrate the past and present. He paints what others cannot and dares not paint, creating meticulous compositions with effortless brushstrokes, each stroke unique and transformed, sweeping away commonplace forms, truly a masterpiece for the ages, worthy of admiration."... Other famous artists such as Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting also presented inscriptions to Mengrong, who kept them hidden in his chest, unwilling to let the world know. Yesterday, I visited him and, after rummaging through his collection, I extracted a few selections to share with those who appreciate Mengrong's paintings.</p>
<p>Wang Dongpei, a renowned figure from Nanjing, is famed for his poetry, calligraphy, and painting throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. He and Mengrong have long been spiritual companions. They plan to arrange a joint exhibition of their works in the spring and summer for connoisseurs to appreciate. Major publishing houses in Shanghai are eagerly seeking Mengrong's works for widespread circulation. It is said that hundreds of people aspire to learn from him. All of this demonstrates that only someone with genuine artistry could deserve such honor, hence this record to express my admiration.</p>

<p>Zhou Zidexin is the beloved son of my friend, Mr. Shanjiang. He was born with innate intelligence and showed extraordinary qualities even in infancy. His mother taught him characters, which he recognized as if he had known them before. At the age of three, he could read books, reciting anything he heard without fail. By the age of seven, he understood literature and reason. His father taught him history books and English arithmetic, which he remembered after a single glance, as clearly as if they were on the palm of his hand. He practiced calligraphy, focusing on Yan Zhenqing's style, striving to capture its essence. Therefore, the people of his hometown all regarded him as a child prodigy. In August of the Gengwu year, he suddenly felt ill and knew that his time was short. He asked for paper and brush on his pillow and drafted a will of one hundred and twenty characters to bid farewell to his parents. I was fortunate to see a printed copy of it. The handwriting was vigorous, and the spirit was extraordinary, resembling Yan Zhenqing's "Draft of a Requiem to My Nephew." It is truly rare for a fifteen-year-old child to be so intelligent. Mr. and Mrs. Shanjiang had only this one son, and their hopes were high, but he was suddenly taken away by Heaven, causing them unbearable grief and a desire to die. There was no elixir to prolong his life, nor any technique to restore his soul. So, a hundred days later, they came to me and said that they had seen this child in a dream, claiming that his past life was as a high-ranking monk, yet his words and actions were just as ordinary as usual, saying that if he had the chance, he would be reborn into their family. His mother's infatuation with this idea deepened, and she even inscribed a mark on his palm as he was dying, perhaps out of the sincerity of her spirit, hoping that his soul could be autonomous. At first, I could only sigh and offer condolences, unable to find words of comfort. I thought that human life in this world is like a dream. If one has a sweet dream, one still has lingering fondness after waking. Therefore, I regret that his dream ended too soon. If it were a nightmare, causing unspeakable suffering in spirit, then one would struggle with all one's might to wake up and would surely rejoice and never wish to relive the previous dream. That can be said with certainty. My friend's love for his son of fifteen years was met with the pain of losing sight in an instant, like a half-cooked millet dream being abruptly awakened, making one feel that the dream was sweet and blissful, and therefore all the more regrettable. However, no matter what, the dream must eventually end. As for the length of the dream and the earliness or lateness of waking, they are mostly created by the mind and are within one's own control. Everyone who has a son believes that he is the hope of the family line, but in reality, this is just a policy to make fools of the people, making them create farmers for the country. However, in today's world, with the well-field system long abandoned and nations competing for survival, everyone uses the weak to feed the strong. If we do not compete with the world, we must haggle over our own selfish desires, hoping for filial sons and virtuous grandsons to protect our inheritance, and hoping to enjoy their sacrifices after we die. I truly feel that this is incredibly foolish, so it is no wonder that nightmares are so frequent. Who in life does not die? To die at a time when it is impossible to promise anything is to be complete. To die while still having parents but no wife and children is especially fortunate. We drift through half our lives, watching the rivers and mountains decline day by day without being able to save them, only feeling that the suffering we endure is getting worse and worse, regretting that we are dying so late. Compared to Zhou Zidexin, I can only praise him without reservation. What is the use of mourning? It is only that my friend and his wife are still searching for a dream within a dream. If their dream truly comes true and human life lasts only a thousand years, my friend and his wife will see their son's sons and grandsons live and die. I do not know how they will be able to resolve the sorrow, joy, suffering, and pain they will experience in their own minds and bodies. Therefore, I sigh and offer condolences with the deepest emotion, unable to find words of comfort. As for his words and deeds, they are detailed in my friend's own "Record of Grief," so I will not repeat them here. I believe that what is worth passing on is not his early learning and intelligence, but his ability to maintain a clear mind at the time of his death, still able to write from his pillow as calmly as usual. His filial piety is commendable, and his willpower is extraordinary. As the saying goes, "Knowing when to stop allows one to be at peace," something that ordinary people cannot do, let alone at the time of death. As for the theory that his past life was as a high-ranking monk, if it is not just the ravings of a dream, then his spirit is immortal and must be able to be autonomous and free. However, I believe that his desire for rebirth is still clinging to a lower form.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Travels in India (36) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Success in business is not easily achieved. In 1756, the Indians retook Calcutta. Three years later, in 1759, the British, under Clive, recaptured it and signed a treaty with the Muslim leaders to subdue them. The construction of the artillery fort was completed in 1753. These events all took place in the 17th century. Over a hundred years of gradual management followed until Queen Victoria promulgated a decree on November 1, 1858, declaring India under British rule. Thus, the British completed their great work in governing India (72 years ago to this day).</p>
<p>Investigation is not easy; people are accustomed to not noticing. For example, if you ask someone who has lived in Shanghai and Nanjing for a long time about the population of Nanjing, they will likely be unable to answer. I repeatedly asked Indian friends about the population of Calcutta, and some said over five million. I did not believe it and consulted books to find a clearer answer: just over 1,327,000 people. Bombay, on the other hand, has only 728,000 people. This place's commerce rivals that of Bombay and Madras, hence the name "London of the East." India has three major ports: Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta.</p>
<p>This place has two seasons a year. From November to February is winter, from March to June is summer, and from July to October is the wet season with much rain. The most rainfall is in August, the hottest month is May, and the coldest month is late December, but only a light jacket is needed to get by. The nights are quite cold, so cotton clothing is advisable.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, I visited the Kali Temple, also known as the old master of Calcutta. It is located south of Calcutta, as indicated by the large characters "Kali Ghat" on trams and other vehicles. The temple is a few minutes' walk from the stop. It is not very large but new, consisting of only a main hall, which is also not grand, and a lobby outside. Before entering the temple, many men asked for money, which I found unpleasant because it was overwhelming. If I gave to one, they would surround me. The temple was crowded with men and women, shoulder to shoulder like the City God Temple in Shanghai, but I found the jostling of dark-skinned, bare-chested Indians unbearable, so I did not want to push my way in and only lingered outside the window. Many birds were perched above, leaving droppings below, making it impossible to stay. My companion had already been hit by bird droppings on the head, and my hat was also stained. The gatekeeper charged two annas to open the door, allowing a glimpse into the black abyss, but it was impossible to see what was inside. Indian friends held incense, bowed, and entered, offering flowers or having flower garlands placed on their heads and necks, but they had to pay for it. I walked dozens of steps west of the temple and saw many vendors selling various incarnations of Kali. Their stories are difficult to trace. Indian scholars say that they are transformed from the same god as Krishna, one male and one female. Not far to the west is a small river with muddy water about two or three feet deep. In the morning, it was still cool, and dozens of men and women were bathing in the river at the same time. I asked why, and they said that this was not bathing but being baptized, immersing themselves completely in the water. I then realized the story of the Jordan River in Christianity and the practice of immersion, where one must immerse the entire body to show reverence. This river is a branch of the old Ganges River, a small but world-famous holy river. There were water taps on the riverbank. I thought that it would be fine to use clean spring water from the taps for baptism, so why enter the muddy waters? There was an ancient temple on the riverbank with various transformations and strange shapes painted on the walls, as well as various idols, half-intact and half-broken, resembling humans and ghosts. I could not help but sigh at the fact that animals have become humans and that their sins are the same as the river, constantly flowing and not knowing when they will be cleansed.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Gold Speculation Rises Thirty-Four Taels Last Week <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Major players covering short positions, bulls adding to their positions</p>
<p>Daily fluctuations exceed ten taels</p>
<p>Since Monday (April 22nd), the big silver bar rose to 1875, and the silver price rose to 375, so the opening price of the June gold contract was 699 taels, a decrease of 7.5 taels compared to last Saturday. Soon after, speculators pushed the price up by 6.7 taels to 706.7 taels, almost reaching the limit. Internal factors were also favorable. In the afternoon, the situation suddenly reversed, with foreign banks showing signs of contraction while domestic banks expanded. Many in the market were selling, so the quoted price was reduced by half a level. Dadetai and Hengxing covered short positions for a total of more than 4,000 contracts, and other firms followed suit, buying heavily and causing the price to rise sharply to 720 taels. The closing price was 17.8 taels, an increase of 11.3 taels. After the market closed, the price rose a total of 21 taels. Looking back at the next day, the big silver bar fell slightly to 1875, and the silver price fell slightly to 375. The quoted price also shrank by half a level. The domestic market followed closely. The market first sold and then bought, and the gold market opened high at 718.5 taels. Dalien and Guangbang sold and retreated to 15.5 taels, then Xinxing and Hengyuan covered short positions, pushing the price up to 27.5 taels. In the afternoon, sellers saw strength and the closing price was 20 taels, still an increase of 2.2 taels. The entire day also saw a fluctuation of 12 taels. On Wednesday, the big silver bar fell slightly by 0.0625, and the silver market decreased by 0.125. The quoted price remained unchanged, then changed to shrink by half a level. The internal market showed strength, and Chinese merchants rushed to buy. The gold market initially opened slightly lower by 1.5 taels at 718.5 taels, which was indeed due to the slight shrinkage of the big silver bar and a lack of confidence. Later, rumors spread that a certain bank planned to transport cash out of the country, and major players covered short positions, pushing the price up by more than 30 taels. There were also rumors from the United States that British banks would close, fearing that exchange rates would tighten sharply and causing the price to rise to 35 taels. In the afternoon, Qianchangxiang bought on behalf of a Shanghai client, reaching as high as 40 taels, and the closing price was 39.1 taels, a further increase of 19.1 taels. The continuous rise for three days totaled 32.6 taels. The total daily fluctuation was 21.5 taels. The next day, the big silver bar shrank again by 0.25, and the silver market shrank by 0.375. The quoted price also shrank by one level. The domestic market was firm but weak, clearly showing strength on the surface but weakness underneath. Banks were still willing to sell, but the situation was the opposite of the previous day. The market rushed to close positions. The gold market initially opened down 4.1 taels at 34 taels. This was due to the poor performance of the big silver bar and the influence of American buying. Later, there was more buying, reaching 39.5 taels. Then Guangbang and others sold, causing the price to fall. In the afternoon, the price suddenly broke through 30 taels and closed at 28.3 taels, a reversal after many days of continuous rise. The drop was 10.08 taels, with a fluctuation of 14 taels. The next day, the big silver bar rebounded by 0.3125, and the silver price increased by half a cent. The quoted price also increased by one level. The domestic market was flat, and those who were trapped continued to buy. The gold market opened slightly lower by 1.8 taels at 26.5 taels. Buyers were active, pushing the price to 27 taels, then back to 24.1 taels. In the afternoon, certain banks bought, causing the price to rise to 39 taels. Due to eager sellers, the price retreated to 33 taels, and the closing price was 35.5 taels, a rebound of 7.2 taels. The total daily fluctuation was 14.9 taels. On Saturday, the big silver bar shrank by 0.0625, the silver price decreased by 0.375, and the quoted price shrank by half a level. The domestic market was stable, and the gold market opened up 7 taels at 740.5 taels. Later, the price rose from 40.02 taels to 46 taels, with fluctuations of two or three taels, but there were no special changes. At noon, the price suddenly broke through the 40-tael mark, closing at 39.5 taels within the mark. The closing price was 40.08 taels, an increase of 5.3 taels compared to the previous day. The difference in the half-day was 6.5 taels. The margin for spot gold was about 12 to 11 taels higher. The high and low prices of British, American, Indian silver markets and exchange rates are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Bond Prices Trended Lower Last Week <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Total Weekly Turnover Exceeded 43 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The local bond market was generally good last week. The total turnover of futures contracts was only about 5 million on two days of the week, which was relatively quiet. Wednesday reached 9.3 million, and Monday and Friday were both over 8 million. Wednesday and the weekend each had over 6 million. The spot market was very sluggish, with only 62,800 yuan, of which Yili Customs accounted for 30,000 yuan, and the rest were only several thousand yuan. As for the changes in bond prices, the bond market environment was as depressed as before. Major players did not make any large-scale entries or exits. With the settlement period approaching, the market was particularly cautious. Therefore, although the market continued to be quite active, the supply and demand situation remained balanced, and bond prices were more sluggish than the previous week. The only exception was Wednesday, when rumors of a price drop of 6 or 7 jiao spread, resulting in a larger fluctuation. The remaining days saw fluctuations of only a few jiao. As a result, compared to the previous week, the price of the 20-year Rolling Tobacco bond was slightly lower by 1.96 yuan, the Disbandment bond futures and the 1919 Customs spot bonds were slightly lower by about 8 jiao, and the rest were all lower by 2 or 3 jiao. The future trend of the bond market depends on what happens after settlement. It is also heard that the stock exchange will reopen the 20-year Customs Duties trading next month. The high, low, and change statistics of each bond price last week are listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e202">Cotton Yarn Market Was Dispersed Last Week <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market trend was extremely dispersed last week, with a risk of market price declining. Overseas cotton yarn conditions trended downwards, and sales of spot yarn were not very smooth. Consequently, market sentiment was extremely weak. Most small traders were cautious as the season was gradually entering a slack period. In addition, there was a large amount of inventory of 10-count coarse yarn, so sellers were bold and exerted more pressure. Although major buyers remained unmoved, the surrounding environment was unfavorable, and it was difficult to support the market alone. At the end of the week, the American cotton grade three slightly improved, and the market slightly rebounded. However, Ruidai liquidated a large number of long positions, and the market was compressed by this action, causing the table to suddenly loosen. It was observed that Shanbang and two yarn factories covered short positions. Judging from the overall trend of the yarn market, it is currently in a consolidation phase. The statistics of spot yarn purchased by each bank show that 7,785 bales were purchased. The most purchases were made by the inland and Guangdong areas, while other banks had average purchases. The marked yarn prices fell for one or two weeks, and slightly rose for four or five weeks. At the end of the week, most long positions were liquidated, resulting in a drop. As a result, the prices of each month were the same as last week for nearby months, and the distant months rose by two, three, or four qian. The total turnover for the whole week was 139,000 bales. The lowest price for grade three yarn was 123.5 yuan in the distant month, and the rebound resulted in a similar situation to last week. The amount of bales purchased by each bank is recorded below.</p>

<p>The cotton market was very weak at the beginning of the week. The trend of American cotton was quite weak, and the lowest price once fell to the 1-jiao mark. Most people predicted that the 1-jiao mark would be broken. Sales of spot cotton in the market were stagnant, and the demand from factories was quiet. Therefore, market sentiment was extremely weak. The middle months fell by less than 40 taels. Later, as American cotton slightly rose, the inventory of goods in various local areas dried up. Japanese merchants exerted a strong pull, and never let go. In addition, the price of gold trended upwards. The market suddenly turned upwards. The price of marked cotton rose by 6.7 qian in each month compared to the previous week. The turnover statistics were 30,101,100 dan. The source on the pier was 1,840 bales of Yao cotton and 2,122 bales of common cotton. The total amount of spot cotton purchased by each factory was 184,700 dan. The American cotton was similar to the previous week. The amount of bales purchased by each manufacturer is recorded below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to bad weather, but later weakened due to Wall Street's weakness and long positions liquidation. Futures fell by 6 to 9 points, and spot fell by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 1 point, and spot was unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 5 points. Japanese merchants purchased Indian cotton, and brokers sold it. Pingle fell by 1 point, and Olala and Bailuo Creek fell by 2 rupees.

<p>Yesterday, the source of arrival was not much. Sales were affected by the sunny weather. The Northern polished rice stored in the river cannot be kept for long in warm weather. Therefore, although the initial opening of Northern polished rice was stable, it soon weakened. The price of top-quality polished rice opened at approximately 12.3 yuan. The inferior quality of the thin rice was mediocre. Only high-quality goods were slightly active. The overall market was slightly discounted. The customer demand for Yangshe indica rice and Shanghai indica rice was poor. The market was not active. The price was initially high but then softened. The value of Yin Yuan has dropped since it was raised. The sales market is sluggish and the situation is weak. The value of Special Yin Yuan opened at around 10.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived, and sales in the main street were initially brisk but then slowed down. The price of early-harvest polished white rice was initially high due to the remaining momentum from the Northern market, but it softened due to the sunny weather. However, the price only oscillated by half a jiao to one jiao. The thin rice and early rice from the South Bank were active in the morning but rare and sluggish in the afternoon. However, the best quality goods fluctuated. The sales of Yin Yuan were stagnant and the willingness to buy was quiet. There was no rise in the price of Yin Yuan and top-quality goods were already too high, so the market continued to decline. The market price was discounted by nearly a jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Silk and Tea: Last Week's Silk Market Lacked Vitality <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Last week, overseas silk weaving factories heavily relied on rayon for summer silk fabrics, coupled with slow sales of spring silk and weak inventories. Silk merchants adopted a passive attitude, leading to a significant decrease in raw silk consumption. Telegrams from Shanghai's Chinese silk businesses to Europe and America were not forwarded, resulting in a lifeless market atmosphere. Japanese and Italian silk inventories remained substantial, making it difficult to clear them before the new silk season. Fortunately, China experienced a poor silkworm cocoon harvest last year, resulting in limited silk inventory. Although a sell-out is expected, small silk merchants are suffering significant losses due to high purchase prices. Reports from Zhejiang indicate a poor spring silkworm season, with 70-80% of silkworm eggs abandoned due to cold weather and rain. Consequently, manufacturers are reluctant to release new cocoon silk. Only over 200 bales of silk were traded last week, with over 700 bales exported. Overseas Chinese silk prices were nominally stable but effectively weak due to exchange rate fluctuations. Below is a table listing the weekend's prices for Chinese silk in Europe and America (New York prices are in gold dollars per pound, Lyon prices are in francs per kilogram):</p>

<p>Qimen County's new tea crop is benefiting from favorable weather this year. Tea bushes in the tea gardens began to bud after Qingming Festival. Recent warm and rainy weather has made it easier for tender shoots to emerge. Famous tea houses in Qizhuang that produce Bai Hao tribute tea have already started picking tender buds and processing them. If the warm weather continues without cold spells, formal garden opening for the first flush may occur within days. Various tea houses are currently planning to transport tea to foreign merchants, dispatching personnel to establish branches in various tea-producing areas to set up weighing scales for purchasing and to supervise tea farmers in harvesting and sun-drying tender leaves to avoid repeating last year's mistake of allowing leaves to become old and coarse, leading to rejection by foreign merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Recent News from Hunan and Hubei Tea Regions <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The provinces of Hunan and Hubei are important tea-producing regions in China, with vast producing areas and significant output. In prosperous years, red tea exports from Hunan and Hubei accounted for about half of the total red tea exports. However, in the past decade, frequent wars and banditry have led to a decline in the rural economy, and tea bushes are no longer cultivated as diligently as before. As a result, output has declined daily. Those engaged in the red and green tea business have also suffered from high costs, tight sales, and sluggish exports, resulting in unbearable losses. This year, the Hunan provincial authorities, in an effort to revitalize the tea industry, telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government to invite tea merchants to purchase tea in Hunan and to protect their safety. However, due to sluggish exports, many boxes of Hunan and Hubei tea remain in Shanghai warehouses uncleared. Therefore, tea merchants' interest in tea trade in Hunan and Hubei has waned, and it appears difficult to actively restore the former prosperity. Currently, tea firms in Hankou and tea merchants in the two provinces are hesitant about whether to promptly go to the mountains to manage tea affairs. However, the various types of green tea in North China stores are gradually seeing improved sales as transportation on the Pinghan Railway and other routes resumes. In the future, there may be a large volume of purchases of green tea, which may show some improvement compared to the past.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Limited Progress Expected in Qiupu Tea Market <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Qiupu borders Qimen and Fuliang and is a famous tea-producing area in central Anhui. Its convenient transportation and fast shipping have led to an increasing number of foreign tea firms operating in the area. In the previous two years, excessive numbers of tea houses led to a sharp rise in mountain prices and doubled costs. Many ended up suffering losses. This year, existing tea houses, recognizing the tight credit situation and the lack of improvement in foreign sales, and considering that the quality of tea leaves here is not as good as that of Qimen, are mostly adopting a wait-and-see approach for the sake of caution. Their intention is that they will not act until mountain prices fall significantly and credit conditions ease. Currently, there are very few people preparing to open tea processing areas, which is not as lively as in previous years. It seems that the tea market will not see any progress for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e212">A Sudden Surge in Fabric Sales Due to Hot Weather <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sudden hot weather caused a surge in retail fabric sales. Items like serge, tweed, water tweed, satin, and drill were in high demand, mostly for making unlined summer clothing for men and women. Business was particularly brisk in the Qipan Street area of Henan Road. Prices were slightly lower than ten days ago, due to a drop in wholesale prices, which translated to cheaper retail prices. Tailors who make Western-style clothing also continued to purchase fabrics like flannel, Barathean cloth, and yellow twill.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Woolen Goods and Fabrics Experience Price Drops <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of woolen goods and fabrics have experienced widespread declines. Items like tribute cloth, serge, tweed, water tweed, pantou cloth, Barathean cloth, and raincoat fabric have all seen sharp price drops. Currently, single-sided "boiling water" American raincoat fabric has fallen to 5.15 taels. Rongtai, Deki, and Yongfeng's colored plaid water tweed and diagonally dotted drill, which were selling for 4.5-4.6 taels last week, have now fallen to 4.2-4.3 taels. Dongfang 3008 medium-thick serge is priced at 3.925 taels, and 3001 is priced at 3 taels. Old Sassoon, Tianjialuo's miscellaneous colors are selling for 2.65 taels, and Ningfeng's "Going to a Banquet" fabric is priced at 2.55 taels, a price decrease of 0.1-0.2 taels compared to the past. Yuanqing tribute cloth, regardless of quality, has dropped by an average of 0.05-0.1 taels per yard. Deki 2488 has been reduced to 4.9 taels, SSS to 2.1 taels, and Rongtai's old brand 15330 remains at 7.75 taels. Anli's "Five Old Friends Meeting" is priced at 6.5 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang requesting several days' leave.</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing with Sun Ke, Minister of Railways. It was rumored that President Wang's visit to Shanghai was to liaise with the Shanghai judiciary regarding the establishment of a court in the Shanghai concessions after the resolution of future negotiations on extraterritoriality. According to sources close to Wang, President Wang telegraphed Chairman Chiang requesting several days' leave for rest after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, has been very busy with engagements in recent days after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to Wang's aides, President Wang's mission in Shanghai is to discuss and investigate matters relating to the recovery of the Shanghai Mixed Court. Yesterday (the 26th) morning at around 9 a.m., he specially invited Xu Weizhen, President of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, Yang Zhaojun, President of the Special District Court, and important figures from the Shanghai legal community to gather at his residence on Haig Road to discuss everything, and it is reported that considerable results have been achieved.</p>

<p>To Wang Chongjian, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Nanjing. Reports have been received that the Sino-Dutch and Sino-Nicaraguan agreements on the abolition of consular jurisdiction were formally signed the day before yesterday, and that negotiations on the abolition of extraterritoriality with the United Kingdom and the United States are also close to completion. The news has spread, and the entire nation is delighted. You, Minister, have worked hard for the party and the country, and are a pillar in the legal field, reversing the collapsing tide and washing away the shame of our ancestors. Your political achievements are evident, and your reputation is greatly enhanced. Upon hearing this, we cannot contain our joy. However, the one million citizens in the Shanghai concessions have long been trapped under the power of imperialists. Even the analogy of being in deep water and scorching fire is insufficient to express their pain. Considering civil lawsuits with imperialists, countless cases have been suppressed and unresolved within a year. As for criminal lawsuits, there have been many wrongful convictions that have never been cleared up in Shanghai alone. If Shanghai is like this, how can the other concessions be an exception? Now that the Netherlands and Nicaragua know to respect each other's national systems and legal rights, our country should treat them as friendly nations. The United Kingdom and the United States, known for their civilization and progress, should not hesitate excessively in this spirit and understanding of mutual respect. In the midst of celebration, we respectfully offer a word of advice, requesting that you further invigorate your spirit and strive to complete the remaining tasks of abolishing extraterritoriality in the shortest possible time. With legal rights unified and national integrity complete, take another step and vigorously implement the work of abolishing unequal treaties to achieve the goal of freedom and equality and to comfort the spirit of the late Premier in heaven and to fulfill the earnest hope of the entire nation. Respectfully submitted. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation salutes you.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Telegram Presented to Representatives of the National Assembly <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>To the Honorable Representatives of the National Assembly in Nanjing. The late patriots knew that the United Kingdom poisoned China with opium, and due to unfortunate military defeats in war, the Treaty of Nanjing was forced upon us in August 1842, a great shame. Tracing back the causes, it was due to the administration of the Manchu barbarians and the presence of treacherous officials in the court. From then on, the great powers regarded China as their prey, freely slaughtering and daring not to resist. From 1842 to the present, a total of ninety years, there have been fifteen instances of losing territory, fifteen instances of losing tributary states, and eight instances of losing territorial waters and straits. There have also been six instances of incomplete sovereignty over territorial waters. As for the loss of legal rights, the establishment of concessions, the agreement on tariffs, and the granting of indemnities, these cannot be fully described in a short space. Observing the great powers' military aggression, cultural aggression, economic aggression, and so on, their unreasonable and barbaric policies have all been directed at us, using every means to bind and oppress us, in an attempt to shatter China's national system and destroy the nation before stopping. Our late Premier awakened the people, promoted the Three Principles of the People, and devoted himself to the revolution and the construction of the Republic of China. Now that military administration has been unified and political tutelage is being implemented, our party comrades are all diligently following his will and striving to complete the remaining tasks. The National Assembly has been convened, unequal treaties should be abolished, and the responsibility to complete the revolution must be actively pursued. The one million five hundred thousand citizens in Shanghai who are located in the concessions created by unequal treaties feel the suffering and pain most deeply and acutely. In short, the Shanghai concessions are semi-colonies, the Shanghai concessions are breeding grounds for all evils, human rights are swept away, and there is no light of day. If these concessions are not recovered, then China's sovereignty will not be complete, and society will not be stable. It is truly essential to recover them as soon as possible to save our compatriots and complete our territory. We respectfully request that your assembly's representatives quickly resolve to abolish unequal treaties and recover the Shanghai concessions and all other concessions in the country, and invigorate your spirit to complete the revolution. It would be fortunate for the citizens of Shanghai and fortunate for the Chinese nation. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation salutes you.</p>

<p>Temporary purchase of 50 mu of land</p>
<p>90 yuan per mu</p>
<p>Since the decision to establish the new Shanghai County seat in Beiqiao Town in the Third District, Wu Wenhua, Chairman of the Relocation Committee, has urged the Construction Bureau staff to actively proceed with the work without sparing effort. The county government has temporarily acquired 50 mu of civilian land for the locations of various county offices, issuing a public notice that the price per mu is set at 90 yuan. Yesterday, Gong Maoxing, Chief of the Technical Section of the Construction Bureau, was specially dispatched to the countryside to, together with Yang Fulin, Chief of the Third District, notify each land owner to submit their land title deeds according to the amount of land, and to simultaneously issue the corresponding land compensation. The designs and drawings for the county government and various office buildings are being prepared, and public bidding will be open for contracting the work in mid-May, with construction scheduled to commence on June 1.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association sent a letter to the French Consul General, Mr. Gangelean, stating: "We are writing to you to inform you that we have received a letter from the Shanghai Seafood and Grocery Association stating that Xin Haishan, an employee of Changhe Company, was shot and seriously wounded by French Constable No. 158 for no reason at the intersection of Yong'an Street and Puan Lane at 9 p.m. on the 7th of this month while on official business. Such inhumane conduct by the French constable, treating human life as grass, is intolerable to the world. Although various agencies have made serious representations to the French police, no response has been received to date. Please uphold justice and provide strong assistance to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrator, apology, compensation, and ensuring safety. After investigation, we found that patrol constables were originally established to protect the people and maintain public order. Now, French Constable No. 158 dared to shoot innocent citizens for no reason, resulting in serious injuries and impending death. This outrageous act is a great misfortune for the French Concession. We have always admired your Consul General's emphasis on humanity and love for peace, and we believe that you will surely punish the French Constable No. 158 according to the law and make appropriate representations to the victim. Furthermore, you must be responsible for ensuring public order hereafter. In the spirit of respecting diplomatic relations, our Association is writing to you to request that you investigate and handle this matter, and we hope to receive a reply. Sincerely, The Shanghai Coal Industry Association."</p>

<h3 id="e221">Declaration of the Establishment of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Workers' Union <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of the Establishment of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Workers' Union (titles omitted): Our Union held its first representative assembly on February 28 of this year and was formally established in accordance with the law. Now, at the beginning of our organization, we dare to briefly describe the mission we bear and the path we will take for future endeavors:</p>
<h3 id="e222">Regarding Organizational Aspects <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>First, regarding the number of members, although there are no accurate statistics on the total number of workers in the publishing industry in the city, it must be at least around 20,000. However, at present, only the members of the Commercial Press Office, numbering less than 4,000, have gathered under the banner of our Union. The remaining 16,000 are enduring a haggard and groaning existence under the oppression of iron-fisted capitalists, which is truly heartbreaking. Our Union is determined to overcome all difficulties in the shortest possible time to promote their organization and mutual support, so that human rights and freedom may be won one day, and the number of members in our Union will also increase accordingly. Second, regarding the quality of active members, the original members of our Union (i.e., those belonging to the Commercial Press Office) have already experienced seven years of organizational life. Comparing the actual situation of the seven years of organizational life with the present situation, it can be seen that there has been some improvement. However, our Union fears that they will become complacent after slight improvements in their lives, causing the spirit of solidarity to turn to fatigue, and even causing the organization itself to collapse, the labor-capital contract to disappear without notice, and not realizing the seriousness of the danger. Our Union should strive to revitalize its inherent solidarity and correct its general misconceptions, while also raising its sense of obligation, hoping to achieve progress and enrichment in terms of quality.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Regarding Economic Aspects <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>(1) In addition to continuing to maintain the original labor-capital contract and welfare matters regarding the general treatment of members' work compensation, we will also, to the extent possible, directly seek to further improve working conditions and indirectly reduce the economic burden on members and increase their knowledge and skills by organizing various welfare undertakings. As for newly added members, our Union should first seek their preliminary liberation in the following three areas: (1) raising the current wage to the level of the line and determining the minimum wage; (2) universally implementing an eight-hour workday; (3) improving other working conditions and labor life. Our Union has repeatedly considered that unless the wages of all workers in the industry in the city exceed the level of the line and all working conditions are universally implemented, it is unlikely that workers in the industry will ever reach the realm of coexistence and common prosperity. (2) Attitude towards industrial rationalization: Since the extreme development of international industrial capital organizations, the rationalization movement has been generated accordingly. Countries that follow its abuses have two extremely serious and unsolvable major problems: one is the continuous increase in unemployed workers, and the other is the excessive surplus of commodity production. The continuous increase in unemployed workers is enough to cause a sharp decrease in domestic purchasing power, and the excessive surplus of commodity production is enough to cause the domestic market to be narrow and sluggish. All kinds of symbols are mutually causal. Although its appearance is the embodiment of industrial capital organization and the concentration of wealth, it already harbors the social unrest and shaking that will promote the outbreak of class struggle, reflecting a period of the collapse of international capitalism. It is the inevitable result of the prosperity and decline of international capitalism. The decline of China's industry is inherently due to the fact that backward countries in the international economy are also subject to the constraints of unequal treaties and are regarded by the international community as the only market for selling surplus commodities. At present, the dumping policies of various countries in China are becoming increasingly obvious, which has aroused panic in the domestic industry, and some industrialists and businessmen advocate the implementation of production rationalization in order to increase production efficiency, but they do not take into account the negative effects of rationalization. Such a situation is a major crisis for society. Our Union observes the state of domestic industry and believes that it is not enough to resist international economic aggression without rapidly developing it. However, the strategy for development must be based on the socialization of the means of production and the socialization of commodity distribution, in order to seek the scientification of production technology without harming the physical health of workers, and to make commodities adapt to the supply and demand of society. If we must force the rationalization methods to be applied to the country, cutting our feet to fit the shoes, then there is no one who will not follow the footsteps of international capitalism. For the sake of social peace and the happiness of the people, our Union will devise strict countermeasures to punish those who violate the principles of social people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Regarding Social Aspects <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Under the capitalist system, our engagement in production work is inherently a condition of being employed by capitalists, but workers in the industry also bear a great responsibility to promote culture and transform society. If we only work to fulfill the conditions of employment, it is tantamount to admitting ourselves to be slaves. Therefore, we must take adapting to the needs of society as the purpose of production, and we must work hard to serve society. Only with the evolution of the entire society can we advance with it.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Regarding Political Aspects <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>To seek the true liberation of the working class, we must wait for the realization of true democratic politics. To seek the realization of true democratic politics, we must first seek the working class to obtain a political position. Because the revolutionary sentiment of the workers is the strongest, the power of their promotion of politics is also the greatest. Politics is driven by revolutionary forces, not only is there no worry about opening the back door, but there is also progress to be expected. That is, our current urgent needs, such as (1) freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication; (2) the right to strike; (3) the right to vote and participate in government; (4) the right to local self-government; (5) the establishment of all other civil rights, etc., all depend on the working class obtaining a political position before there is an opportunity to implement and realize them. Then the people of all classes may enjoy equal political power in politics, and the embryo of true democratic politics may be formed and even fully established to achieve consolidation. This is not only what the workers in this industry hope for, but also what the workers in all industries in the city and the country are trying to achieve. Therefore, what we want to achieve a political position for is the masses, not for private individuals. Violating this principle is all hypocrisy. Departing from this spirit, even if we run and shout, we can only do our best to shout and have no benefit to the actual benefit.</p>
<p>In summary, in order to achieve each and every one of them, we must make the greatest sacrifices and efforts. As the saying goes, "How can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?" The people of this Association are ashamed of their lack of strength and heavy responsibilities, and are willing to encourage each other with all the workers in this industry in the city. This is a statement of intent. April 23, 1920</p>

<p>Cotton Cloth Association Refuses to Pay Inspection Fees and Wharf Dues</p>
<p>And Plans to Organize a Transportation Trust Limited Company</p>
<p>The customs workers in this city went on strike. Yesterday, the union issued a notice ordering work to resume this morning. Businessmen were rushing to load goods for export, totaling more than 6,000 pieces. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e227">Resumption of Work Notice <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The Customs Industry Union yesterday notified all members to obey the order to resume work this morning. Regarding the matter of the notice, the Municipal Social Training Order and the attached tripartite agreement were issued, ordering the union to inform the workers to resume work first, etc. Upon receiving this, a general assembly was convened at 7 p.m. yesterday (25th) to discuss the results. This notice will be published as follows: (1) Obey the government's order to resume work on Monday (27th). However, if the Cotton Cloth Association causes further complications or violates the tripartite agreement, it will be dealt with by a second strike. (2) Before a formal treaty is established, temporary accommodations will be made for the delivery of goods from our store and our warehouse. (3) Except for the Lihe Warehouse, all the union drivers in Huishan, Warehouse, Osaka, Huangpu, and Suzhou River will pick up cars at the Bund on Er Ma Road every day from 1:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Strike Losses <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>There are more than 340 cotton cloth companies in the Cotton Cloth Association that sell cotton cloth from the local factories (i.e., white goods), more than 80 such as Hong Shengyuan, more than 100 foreign-style goods such as Tongqing, more than 100 Western-style goods such as Bao Tai, and more than 50 dismantling houses (i.e., door shops) such as Ri Xin Sheng. This time, due to the cartage fee issue for local factory cotton cloth, a labor strike occurred, and foreign goods were affected. Although the customs workers have scheduled to resume transport today, the losses suffered by various companies due to the strike are substantial. There are more than 50 customs agents such as Yuanfeng and Kunji that transport cotton cloth. During the suspension period, about 2,000 pieces were transported for export by foreign customs companies such as Asia, resulting in a loss of about 3-4,000 yuan. After the Customs Workers' Union announced the strike, the various expenses totaled about 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Cargo Transportation Resumes <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>After the customs workers decided to resume work uniformly starting today, more than 50 customs agents in this city, such as Merchants Bureau and Yu, dispatched staff members to various customer houses starting yesterday to collect dispatch orders and contact transportation matters. The ships that mainly transport cotton cloth, both Western and local factories, such as the Changjiang Gang, Merchants Bureau's Jiangshun Wheel, Taikoo Company's Shengjing Wheel, Suiding Wheel, Jardine Matheson Company's Lianhe Wheel, Merchants Bureau's Yu Manager Changfeng Wheel, Wentiaban Lian'an Company's Zhoushan Wheel, Beiyangban Taikoo Company's Shuntian Wheel, Daming Wheel, Qingdaoban Taikoo Company's Suzhou Wheel, and Niuzhuangban Zhaoxing Company's Lianxing Wheel, are all scheduled to sail today for export. The Changjiang Gang has about 4,000 pieces of cotton cloth, the Northern Gang has about 1,000 pieces, and the Wentai and other gangs have about 1,000 pieces, totaling more than 6,000 pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Reporting to the Authorities <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>The Customs Industry Union yesterday submitted a document to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating, "The purpose of this document is to inform you that all workers have obeyed your bureau's instructions and have resumed all cotton cloth operations on the 27th of this month. The text is presented for your review. We respectfully received your bureau's Order No. 2941, which stated (omitted). Therefore, we immediately convened a general meeting of all members to discuss the resumption of work. All members agreed that this labor unrest has lasted for two weeks and that we are grateful for your bureau's repeated impartial mediation to resolve this labor unrest. We have decided to resume work on Monday, the 27th of this month, and have decided that if the Cotton Cloth Association causes further complications or does not comply with the tripartite agreement, the workers are prepared to deal with it by a second strike. Therefore, we also ask your bureau to convene the Cotton Cloth Association and the capital's industry association as soon as possible to sign a formal treaty so that an early result can be obtained. This document is specially prepared and submitted for your bureau's review. It is a public convenience. Respectfully presented. At the same time, it has also been reported to the Municipal Party Department and the Civil Training Council."</p>

<p>The Cotton Cloth Association held a general meeting of members at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. 181 companies such as Ri Xin Sheng Xu Xianglin, Lai Da Chen Songyuan, and Bao Tai Xu Junmo attended. Chairman Chen Songyuan reported on the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's past mediations and the repeated contacts with the Customs Union, and read out the draft convention previously drafted by the association and the amendments and compromises made by the authorities for discussion and resolution by the public. (1) The origin of the convention should be incorporated. (2) The first article of the amendment agreement was passed. (3) The second article should be fought for by the attending representatives based on the original plan passed by the last general meeting. (4) The third article was passed, but the cotton cloth cartage should be specified as 1.90 cents for double bags and 0.9 cents for single bags. (5) The fourth article should be amended to state that the boundary is north to the Suzhou River and south to the French Concession's Avenue Edward VII. The goods of each shop should be delivered according to the order, and no cartage should be given to banks and warehouses outside the boundary. (6) The words "Western and foreign goods and local factory cotton cloth" in the agreement should be amended to "Various Western and foreign goods, various fabrics, and various local factory cotton cloths." (7) The fifth article was passed. (8) Inspection fees, stamp taxes, and wharf dues were unanimously rejected. (9) Cartage should be paid according to the regulations and should not be increased. Finally, the majority of companies proposed that if the Customs Union does not allow wharf dues and inspection fees, it will organize its own Cotton Cloth Industry Transportation Trust Limited Company. After the chairman repeatedly dissuaded, the proposal was not passed.</p>
<p>Two Silk Industry Unions Send Letters Requesting Employers to Restore Wages</p>
<h3 id="e232">Letter from the Yinxiang District Labor Union <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The Yinxiang District Silk Filature Workers' Union yesterday sent a letter to the Silk Factory Owners' Association, which stated: "Respectfully, we would like to inform you that in November of last year, the workers, in the spirit of labor-management cooperation and for the sake of the factory's business, painfully agreed to temporarily calculate wages at 85% of the original amount. The suffering endured by the workers in the past half-year is beyond description, which we believe your association is also aware of. On March 13th of this year, at the inaugural meeting of our union, representatives of the members, considering that the original wage rate in Shanghai, where prices are soaring for all goods, was already barely sufficient to maintain the workers' livelihood, let alone at 85% of the original amount, which was even more unsustainable, submitted a proposal to the meeting for discussion. It was resolved to request the factory owners to immediately restore the original wage rate. Upon receiving the resolution from the meeting, our union hoped that commodity prices would fall slightly to ease the burden on the workers, so we did not immediately make a request to your association. However, recently, the price of gold has continued to rise, and commodity prices have followed suit, causing the cost of living to continue to rise uncontrollably. In recent days, workers have come to the union to express their grievances and demand that the factory owners immediately restore the original wage rate, often with tears in their eyes. This situation, this scene, if seen by the factory owners, would also cause them heartache, because the workers' livelihoods are already on the brink of despair. This matter was submitted to the eighth regular meeting of our union yesterday for discussion. All agreed that the workers' livelihood is so dire that restoring the original wage rate is urgently needed. Moreover, since the factory's business was poor last year, the workers were able to painfully understand and forgive the factory owners first. Now that the workers are in distress, the factory owners should not turn a blind eye and fail to fulfill their duty of assistance. Furthermore, it must be understood that wages that are too low will make it impossible for workers to maintain their livelihoods, inevitably leading to a loss of their enthusiasm for work and making it difficult for them to concentrate on their jobs. Then, it will be difficult for the factory owners to ask the workers to work hard to improve production. Therefore, it was resolved to send a letter to your association, requesting you to immediately notify all factories to restore wages to their original level from May 1st, so that workers can maintain their livelihoods and devote themselves to improving production, so that the silk industry can have hope of development, which would benefit not only our labor and management, but also the entire country. We hereby send this letter, hoping that you will immediately comply to alleviate the workers' difficulties and avoid disputes, and please reply within three days. Sincerely, Yinxiang District Silk Filature Workers' Union, April 25th."</p>
<h3 id="e233">Letter from the Zhabei District Labor Union <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The Zhabei District Silk Filature Workers' Union yesterday sent a letter to the Silk Factory Owners' Association, which stated: "Respectfully, we would like to inform you that in November of last year, our silk filature workers, in view of the sluggish silk market and the difficult business operations of the factories, and in accordance with the principle of labor-management mutual assistance and understanding to seek the development of industry, spared no pain and sacrifice to temporarily calculate wages at 85% of the original amount. This small amount of sincerity was truly for the sake of the factory's business. However, since the wage reduction, the cost of living has not only been difficult to lower, but the price of gold and silver has increased sharply, to the point where the wages of workers who toil all day long are not enough to provide for their own food and clothing, let alone the livelihood of their families. It is pitiful and lamentable. It is no wonder that the labor unrest at the beginning of the month erupted suddenly. When the labor unrest occurred, our union, for the sake of labor-management cooperation and local security, did its utmost to persuade the workers to return to work, and fortunately, it did not spread and expand, and the effort was successful in less than two days. At that time, the reason why our union did not make a request was that we originally believed that the factory owners would be able to realize this and automatically restore the original wage rate. However, we have not seen your understanding. In the past month, not only have the factory owners shown no intention of restoring the wages, but your esteemed association, which upholds justice and seeks the overall development of the silk industry, has also turned a deaf ear. Is this the proper attitude for labor-management cooperation? Moreover, you have deeply failed the workers' original understanding and forgiveness of the factory owners last year.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>In recent days, workers have come to the union to weep and complain about the pressures of life, one after another. Not only are we in the union heartbroken to witness this, but we believe that your association is also unbearable to hear about it. Therefore, our union held an emergency meeting and resolved to send a letter to your association, requesting you to immediately notify all factories to implement the restoration of the original wage rate from May 1st, in order to prolong the workers' remaining lives and maintain labor-management relations, and to jointly promote the development of the silk industry. If you delay this matter under any pretext and cause unexpected disturbances, your association will be responsible. We hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle it, and please reply within three days. Zhabei District Silk Filature Workers' Union."</p>

<p>Coal Association Discusses Yesterday</p>
<p>More than ten coal dealers in this city, including Xinyi Gong, etc., have been facing accusations from users recently because they have been unable to deliver the coal they ordered from the Kailuan Coal Distribution Office (Yuan Taiquan Tai, etc.). This has led to disputes. Subsequently, the coal dealers purchased other types of coal to supply to users, but the price has increased by more than two taels per ton, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, they repeatedly made serious representations to the Kailuan Coal Distribution Office, but to no avail. Mediation by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also failed to resolve the issue. Then, the Coal Trade Association submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Social Affairs Bureau for formal mediation. The Social Affairs Bureau has already notified the Coal Trade Association and the Kailuan Coal Distribution Office to mediate at 9:00 am today (the 27th). The Coal Trade Association convened a meeting of all coal dealers at 3:00 pm yesterday to discuss the matter. Two representatives from each coal dealer and one representative from the Coal Trade Association were designated to attend the Social Affairs Bureau. In accordance with item 5 of the coal ordering contract, they submitted a statement of reasons to the Social Affairs Bureau, saying:</p>

<p>Request from the Yarn Mill Association</p>
<p>Tax Receipts from Yichang to be Used as Verification</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn Mill Association sent a letter to the General Taxation Office yesterday regarding the refund method for cotton yarn and cloth transported and sold in Sichuan Province. It stated: "Most of the cotton yarn and cloth transported from Shanghai to Sichuan are transshipped via Yichang to Chongqing. Currently, no customs duties are paid for transporting goods from Shanghai to Yichang. However, customs duties must be declared and paid from Yichang to Chongqing. This customs duty should be refunded. Merchants can pay taxes in Yichang, then send the Yichang tax receipt and the duplicate bill of lading back to your office for verification. The already-paid consolidated tax will then be fully refunded to simplify procedures. If approved, please reply so that we can inform the relevant parties."</p>
<h3 id="e236">Recent Continued Reports on the Shaanxi Relief Efforts of the Jisheng Society <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society previously received a report from its relief worker, Mr. Li Yunmen, detailing the situation of the Shaanxi relief efforts, which was published in a previous report. Now, we have received a follow-up report: (1) The relief workers and the burial team set off together on the 5th of this month to investigate and distribute relief in Zhenyuan Town, which was the most severely affected by the disaster. In one day, they investigated and distributed relief in five villages. There were more than thirty corpses in the villages. It is conceivable that there are many corpses in the town, which has about one hundred and ten villages. The society replied that the total number of corpses buried should be increased and the mounds should be heightened to prevent the spread of filth and epidemics. (2) Distribute seeds for emergency relief to facilitate replanting for the autumn harvest. After the investigation and relief distribution in Zhenyuan Town, relief was distributed in ten towns, including Weigong Town, in four batches and in an orderly manner. (3) The first batch of 20,000 yuan in relief funds and the second batch of 20,000 yuan in relief funds were received this month. Of the third batch of 20,000 yuan in relief funds, 18,000 yuan were received by the Shanghai Tai Chang Fu Qingtai Silver Shop, and 2,000 yuan were received by the De Xingcheng Public Warehouse in the Tianhe Public Warehouse. The society converted a total of 60,000 yuan for Shaanxi relief this month. In the future, the number of seeds released for relief will be very large, and it is feared that another 40,000 yuan will be allocated in the near future to meet the urgent need.</p>

<p>Manufacturing New Instruments</p>
<p>There are more than sixty measurement and weighing instrument manufacturing stores and factories, large and small, in this city. Among them, twenty-four stores and factories, including the Commercial Press, the Scientific Instrument Museum, Chen Jinsheng, and Zhu Zhengda, etc., have already followed the regulations and applied to the Bureau of Measurement and Weighing for registration and obtained business licenses. All have begun manufacturing new instruments. Those that have been submitted to the Bureau of Measurement and Weighing for inspection have been stamped with four marks for identification. Those who wish to purchase them can identify and purchase them from these stores and factories. For wholesale purchases, the Bureau of Measurement and Weighing can be requested to handle them on their behalf. It is also heard that because the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau announced the standardization of measurement and weighing in this city on July 1st, and the deadline is approaching, all major trade associations are preparing new instruments. Therefore, stores that have not yet obtained licenses will be ordered to apply for licenses in accordance with the regulations, otherwise they will be severely punished in accordance with the law to promote manufacturing.

<h3 id="e241">Verdict on a Collision Between Two Vehicles <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Both Chauffeurs Were at Fault</p>
<p>Ding Baofa, the chauffeur of Ding Runxiang, a wealthy gentleman, was driving car number 990 on the afternoon of the 11th of this month at 3:00 pm, traveling west on Avenue Petain in the French Concession to Route Lafayette. Unexpectedly, car number 6021, driven by Pei Yufang, was traveling south. The two sides failed to avoid each other and collided, both incurring damage. The police arrived to record the numbers and reported to the head of the patrol. The two parties were summoned to the French Court for interrogation the day before yesterday. First, the head of the vehicle affairs office reported the situation. Then, Mr. Tibbek, the lawyer representing Ding Runxiang, stated that the plaintiff, Ding Runxiang's car, was dispatched by the chauffeur Ding Baofa that day to Tangjiawan to pick up the old lady to return home. Unexpectedly, it was hit by Pei Yufang's car at the intersection of Route Lafayette. The old lady sitting in the car was also seriously injured and is currently still in the hospital for treatment. He requested that the public prosecution part be judged first, and the private prosecution part would be pursued after the appraisal in the future. The defendant, Pei Yufang, was also represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen, who stated that on that day, there was a Public Works Bureau truck parked at the corner, so his client did not see the car traveling from east to west. Ding Baofa, who was driving the car, also did not honk the horn to warn. Who is right and who is wrong? He requested a clear investigation. The Chinese and Western officials ruled that Pei Yufang was fined 15 yuan for careless driving and failing to honk the horn, and Ding Baofa was fined 1 yuan for driving without a license and 5 yuan for failing to honk the horn. The private prosecution was allowed to be reserved.</p>

Sun lived with her two daughters-in-law and grandchildren. Although the old woman was over sixty years old, she was stubborn. Whenever her daughters-in-law slightly disobeyed her, they would be insulted and scolded. However, because the daughters-in-law knew of her age, they did not dare to disobey her. Unexpectedly, she quarreled with her second daughter-in-law again the night before last, and secretly bought half a yuan worth of opium and swallowed it secretly. Then she fell asleep. Later, because she was suffering from poisoning and moaning, her family found a remaining opium bubble in her pocket and realized that she had committed suicide by swallowing opium. Her son, Xianbing, etc., sent her to the Wusong Sanatorium and the Seaside Public Hospital for rescue. However, because she was old and her blood was weak, although Dr. Xu Lanting, etc., tried to treat her, the opium poison was completely vomited out, but she could not overcome the poison, and she died yesterday morning. Her sons, etc., purchased clothing and a coffin and had her buried in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The Restaurant Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which stated: "We are writing to you because the Business Tax Preparation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau has issued a notice stating that since the business tax is a newly created tax, we should study it carefully at the beginning of its implementation. If the trade associations in this city have any opinions to propose, they must submit them to the Chamber of Commerce representative for collection or send them to the office for discussion within two weeks. If you need the draft proposal mentioned above, please request it from our office." According to the draft business tax rates for this city proposed by the Municipal Finance Bureau as published in the newspaper, the tax rate for the restaurant industry is 5 per mille of the business turnover, which does not comply with the Business Tax Outline promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, which stipulates that the maximum amount of business tax should not exceed 2 per mille. However, the raw materials used by the restaurant industry, such as fish, chicken, meat, oil, rice, noodles, seafood, and groceries, have all been taxed. Our industry only boils them in a pot to provide food and drink, and then charges a business tax of 5 per mille, which is actually a tax on a tax and does not comply with the principle of one item, one tax. We have learned that the business tax was established after the cessation of tariffs to compensate for local finances and should be levied with a reduction in accordance with the principle of one item, one tax, with 1 or 2 per mille as the maximum amount. In terms of the scope of Shanghai, there are special circumstances that are different from other places, and there is a distinction between the Chinese and foreign concessions. Restaurant industry tycoons and wealthy merchants set up banquets mostly in the concessions. The collection of business tax must be carried out simultaneously in both the Chinese and foreign concessions to ensure fairness, otherwise there will be excuses. The association requests that your esteemed association forward this to the financial authorities for discussion. Please pay attention to the following four items for the restaurant industry representatives attending the business tax discussion: (1) In accordance with Article 11 of the Business Tax Principles, when applying for a business license, it must be stamped by the trade association after investigation before it is issued. This will unify the high collection of business tax and avoid omissions. (2) Collect taxes in accordance with the principle of one item, one tax. (3) The raw materials used in the restaurant industry have all been taxed, and should be collected with a reduction of 1 per mille or exempted from tax. (4) The collection of business tax should be carried out simultaneously in the concessions and the Chinese area to avoid partiality. In summary, we earnestly request your esteemed association to review and approve the adoption and forwarding to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and to promote fairness. We would be grateful for your kindness." (Below omitted)</p>

<h3 id="e254">A Record of Wei Ru Xiang's Guilt in Stealing Intimacy <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Having an Affair with Maid Bai Tu Zi</p>
<p>Because the Girl Was Under Sixteen Years of Age</p>
<p>Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment</p>
<p>A maid named Bai Tu, employed by the Fan family at No. 367 Shunde Lane, Zhejiang Road, is seventeen years old and originally from Wumen. Due to poverty, her mother, Gu Zhang, brought her to Shanghai to work as a kitchen maid to earn a living. The girl had a name, but people called her Bai Tu Zi (White Rabbit) because of her fair complexion, and she gladly accepted it, so her real name was forgotten. Bai Tu Zi not only had fair skin, but was also petite and could please others. Her employer had an adopted son named Wei Ru Xiang (also known as Shi Xiang), who was thirty-nine years old and fond of dressing up. Whenever Bai Tu Zi saw him, they would exchange glances. Wei was skilled at seduction, and so they became intimate. On the nineteenth of last month, Bai Tu Zi quit her job and eloped with Wei. They first stayed at the Phoenix Hotel on Tianjin Road, then moved to the Zhongshan Hotel. Her mother found out and reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest the pair of lovebirds. The next morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Zhou presided over the trial. According to Gu Zhang's complaint, her daughter Bai Tu Zi had been promised to a Zhang family. Now that Wei had defiled her, the Zhang family would not want to marry her. She requested that the defendant pay 600 yuan to settle the matter with the Zhang family so that her daughter could become Wei's wife. Then, Bai Tu Zi said that she met Wei at the Fan family. Her fiancé was a farmer, and she could not bear the field work, so she did not want to marry him and wished to live with Wei forever. Wei Shi Xiang confessed that he had an affair with the girl. According to the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi, Bai Tu Zi's birthday showed that she was not yet sixteen years old. According to the criminal law, sexual intercourse with a girl under sixteen, even with consent, is considered rape and should be punished according to the rape law. However, Gu Zhang intended to marry her daughter to Wei Shi Xiang and pleaded for leniency, even offering to drop the charges. The lawyer Fan Gang defended the defendant. Judge Zhou finally sentenced Wei to one year of imprisonment for enticing and having sexual intercourse with a girl under twenty years of age. The part of the charge concerning rape was dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e255">A Lawsuit Involving a Brothel Patron <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>The Brothel Accuses Him of Enticement, Incitement, and Theft</p>
<p>The Patron Accuses Them of False Accusation and Forcing Prostitution for Profit</p>
<p>Cheng Zhangcai, an employee of the electric power company from Nanhui County, recently caused a dispute by arranging for Jin Yuan, a prostitute from the Jicheng brothel in Minhe Lane, Zhejiang Road, to leave the brothel. The two parties sued each other in the Special District Local Court. According to Yang Jicheng, also known as Wang Laoda, Jin Yuan is the biological daughter of Zhu He, a woman living in the city. She is thirty-nine years old. According to the complaint of Lu Qi, the lawyer representing Jicheng, Zhu He, due to poverty, hired Jin Yuan to work as a singer in the Jicheng brothel for a term of four years through a guarantor named Zhang in June of last year. She first gave the brothel an earnest money of 400 yuan, and then used the interest on that amount as Jin Yuan's salary. Jicheng hired a teacher to teach Jin Yuan songs and provided her with clothing, which cost a lot of money. Fortunately, she learned the skills and was able to serve customers. However, Cheng Zhangcai, claiming to be a romantic, saw that Jin Yuan was young and beautiful and used his means to take Jin Yuan out on a car on the second day of the first month of the New Year. They went out to worship the god of joy in the afternoon and did not return until late at night. The maid A Genmei and the old woman were sent to search for them and found them at the Zhu Shunxing Iron Shop in the city, embracing on her mother Zhu He's bed. A Genmei and others knew that Zhu He was not in the room and realized that they could not persuade her to return to the brothel, so they reported back to Jicheng and followed her. Cheng and Jin Yuan had already disappeared. According to Zhu He, Cheng had sent Jin Yuan back, but her whereabouts were still unknown the next day. They invited Zhu He's second daughter and the maid to go to Cheng Zhangcai's residence at No. 1027 Wuzhou Road and found Cheng and Jin Yuan lying in bed in broad daylight. They were awakened by her mother and returned to the brothel. Unexpectedly, the next morning, Jin Yuan took the opportunity to steal gold and pearl bracelets, diamond rings, velvet cloaks, and wool serge cheongsams and disappeared. Jicheng was afraid that this matter would be publicized and would not only affect Jin Yuan's reputation but also hinder business, so she secretly investigated. Unexpectedly, Cheng Zhangcai took the initiative to instruct Jin Yuan to entrust lawyer Lin Yingqing to send a letter to Jicheng claiming that she had broken off relations with him and falsely claiming that the 400 yuan earnest money had been returned in full. Jin Yuan is under twenty years old and her ability to act is still lacking. This incident was purely the result of Cheng Zhangcai colluding with her mother to entice her into having sexual intercourse and inciting her to steal clothing. Therefore, she asked the court to summon the defendants to court and punish Cheng Zhangcai for violating Article 257, Paragraph 2, and Article 337 of the criminal law, and to punish Zhu He for violating Articles 258 and 337 and order them to return the 400 yuan earnest money and clothing. In addition to being represented by lawyer Lin Yingqing, the two defendants also filed a lawsuit against Jicheng for false accusation, claiming that Zhu Jinyuan had been repeatedly abused and forced to receive customers since she was hired by Yang Jicheng. Jinyuan was determined to escape the brothel and borrowed 480 yuan from Cheng Zhangcai. Yang agreed to allow her to redeem herself, but after receiving the money, she went back on her word and harassed her in every way, demanding more than double the original deposit. She also filed a false accusation with the authorities. They asked the court to reject her complaint and to prosecute Yang Jicheng for false accusation, forcing prostitution for profit, and extorting money. The case was originally scheduled to be heard the day before yesterday afternoon. Both parties and witnesses were present as scheduled. However, because Judge Ge was busy hearing other cases, this case could not be heard in detail. He only briefly questioned them and ordered them to be rescheduled for further hearing and investigation.</p>

<p>The West Patrol Head of the Traffic Department is Transferred to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>The Police Department of the Bureau of Public Works has been very serious in investigating and banning opium and cracking down on the private sale of various narcotic drugs in recent years. It originally intended to set up a special office early and select competent staff to be responsible for handling it. However, because the affairs of the Traffic Department were not very busy and it had enough time to take care of both, the establishment of a special office was delayed. The Traffic Department has been handling it until now, and the results are quite considerable, so there seems to be no need to change it. However, the transportation business in the Public Concession is becoming more and more prosperous and complex. The Chinese and foreign staff of the Traffic Department are each performing their duties and still feel that they are too busy to handle other matters. Moreover, the anti-smoking policy is now being vigorously implemented. If special personnel are not set up, it may be difficult to eliminate the poisonous atmosphere. Therefore, the Police Commissioner has set up a group to investigate and ban narcotic substances. All cases of opium and other prohibited items will be handled by this group. The West Patrol Head of the Traffic Department, Mr. Pan Gensi, will be transferred to handle the matter in order to make use of his expertise. Pan's vacancy will be filled by a person with traffic knowledge and experience. The personnel assisting Mr. Pan have also been appointed by the Police Commissioner as West Detective Pu Pu and Chinese Detective Song Bingzheng, detectives Zhang Shaoqing and Ding Yugao. They officially started working on the 21st of this month. From now on, there will be a special person responsible for banning smoking in the concession, which will be more appropriate and may be good news for the future of smoking ban.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Major Reform of Electricity in Wusong <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Baoming Stops Generating Electricity</p>
<p>Effective May 1st</p>
<p>Wusong Electric Lights has always only had night electricity. Since the completion of the Yin Xing New Power Plant of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, the Wusong Baoming Electric Light Company has contacted it to purchase electricity from nearby to feed Wusong. After several negotiations between the two parties, a formal contract was signed in October of last year. Baoming Company immediately laid another main line along Jungong Road and purchased land at the corner of Zhanghuabang Railway West Jungong Road to build an electrical room to install transformers, meters, and main switches. It also laid separate street light lines on various roads in Songzhen to prepare for sending daytime electricity. The street lights can be turned on and off on time. The above project was completed the day before yesterday. It is scheduled to stop generating electricity at the Baoming Power Plant on May 1st and implement the uninterrupted transmission of electricity from the Zhabei New Power Plant day and night. Then, the plant will use transformers to convert high voltage to low voltage for distribution. In the future, Wusong Baoming's general users can have electricity day and night, which will be much more convenient than before.</p>

<p>And Fire Cannons Ashore to Demonstrate</p>
<p>After the sea bandits at Wusongkou were jointly suppressed by the Navy, the Water Police, and the Pacification Army, the bandits entrenched in Lvsi also collapsed. Therefore, fishing boats were released to the sea to cast their nets. Unexpectedly, the seaside of Cuzhen suddenly reported a bandit alarm the day before yesterday. At about 5 p.m. that afternoon, more than 20 bandit ships suddenly came to the seaside of the Western Yangjia Slope in the town and fired cannons ashore to demonstrate whether there were any defenses, causing the nearby residents to panic and flee. Yesterday, it was learned that Liang's troops and the Provincial Security Corps had rushed to pursue them and blocked the ports to prevent the bandit ships from sneaking in to land and harass them.</p>

<p>Sunny Weather Yesterday Attracted Double the Number of Visitors</p>
<p>Longhua Temple in the southwest of Shanghai is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai. Every spring, when the peach blossoms are red and the willows are green, and the vegetables are yellow and the wheat is budding, people bring their families to visit, almost like on the Shanyin Road. Since the beginning of this year, it is a pity that the weather has not been good, with dark clouds and storms from time to time, which has dampened the scenery and caused tourists to stay at home. Yesterday happened to be a sunny Sunday with a gentle breeze, so the number of people from Shanghai who went to sightsee was endless. At 2 p.m., the temple grounds were even more crowded. The No. 2 special buses of the South Shanghai Public Bus also ran extra shifts to facilitate transportation, so tourists praised the convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e260">The Case of the Murder of the Accountant Still Needs Investigation <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Xu Kuijun, the accountant of the Wuhua Road Refinery in Hongkou, was robbed and hacked to death with a chaotic axe on the evening of January 3 of this year, and more than 7,000 yuan in banknotes were robbed. Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau found that Shi Ruiqing, an apprentice of the factory, and Zhou Awu, a tea room attendant, colluded with bandits from outside to plot to kill the accountant. Shi and Zhou were immediately arrested, and 1,700 yuan in stolen money and bloodstained clothes, a bag, and a sharp axe were found. It was found that the clothes, bag, and sharp axe belonged to Zhou Awu. The axe was the murder weapon. The interrogation revealed that they had confessed and been sent to the Local Court for investigation. The prosecution was clear and filed a public prosecution for robbery and murder. The day before yesterday, Judge Wu opened the trial. Shi Ruiqing confessed that a total of eight people came in, stayed in the inner accounting room for two hours, took the banknotes, and divided them at the outer accounting counter. I was monitored and did not participate in anything. After they were divided, they ordered me to go to sleep. At that time, Zhou Awu was holding the axe and also came out of the inner accounting room. Zhou Awu gave me 1,700 yuan at dawn to keep for him, saying that he was afraid that things would be leaked and threatened not to report, otherwise he would kill me. Later, my senior brother called me out to play, but I was arrested. Zhou Awu confessed that he was sleeping in the kitchen room with four other people. I only know one name, Fusheng. The accountant was killed while I was sleeping and I didn't know anything about it, and I didn't send any money to Shi Ruiqing. When asked how there was blood on his clothes, he replied that it was from his hands cracking open from the cold. When asked where the blood on the package came from, he replied that he didn't know. When asked why he didn't call Mr. Xu when he went to the accounting room the next morning, but called Mr. Ye, did you know that Xu was dead? He replied that this was not the case. I called Mr. Xu because the silver boxes were opened and I went to the bedroom with the student Chen Kangnian and saw that he had been hacked to death. The apprentice Chen Kangnian said that I lived with Shi Ruiqing. When the incident happened, I was already asleep. The next morning, I went in first and saw that the silver box was open. Later, Zhou Awu came and said he was going to call Mr. Ye. I said to call Mr. Xu, so we went to Mr. Xu's place and saw that he was dead. Xu Lanfang, the son of the deceased, said that his father was kind and had no enemies. He had a good relationship with his colleagues in the factory. I don't know the reason for his death this time. The interrogating official believed that the case still needed investigation, so he ordered it to be rescheduled for trial and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

He was arrested and sent to the Special District Court the day before yesterday to investigate. Lu said that he was still in Tianjin at that time and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Xu ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>Tian Zhengxin, a police officer of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, was patrolling the river to the Dada Wharf at about 1 a.m. yesterday when he saw the Dade steamer berthed there and had not yet set sail. He immediately boarded the ship to conduct an inspection. He found a bamboo box and a net basket at the stern of the ship, but no one was guarding them. When he inquired about the owner of the items, a man came forward and claimed to be Gu Rongji and admitted that the box and basket were his. He immediately tried to open the bamboo box and search it. He found three pancakes and blue cloth short shirts and trousers, but no prohibited items. When he turned over the bottom of the box, he found that the bottom was made of wood, but the outside was made of bamboo. He immediately became suspicious and pried open the wooden bottom of the box. He found that the box had a false bottom and contained thirteen rifle springs, eight barrels, three bolts, and fourteen parts needed for the gun. Then, he found three rifle springs, four barrels, one bolt, and orange peel tea in the net basket. He brought the witnesses back to the team. When Chief Xu of the General Team interrogated Gu Yueji, he confessed that he was 58 years old and from Funing. This time, I took the steamer to Jiangbei because of something. On the ship, I met a fellow villager who I didn't know who asked me to take care of the box and basket for him. He went to look for a room elsewhere. I really didn't know there were prohibited items hidden inside and I was deceived. I asked for your understanding. He was ordered to submit a document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>On the past two days, more than 500 refugees from Xiangxiang, Hunan, crossed from Zhoujiadu to Pudong, passed through Yangsi Sanlin along Shangnan Motor Road, and went all the way to Zhoupu Town in Nanyi, causing a lot of disturbance. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, Kang Yisheng, contacted Zeng Guoqi and He Zhongbo, the leaders, and arranged for them to live in Fangguang Temple and Yue Wang Temple and gave them one stone of white rice and forty yuan. The Zhoupu Chamber of Commerce was afraid of accidents and armed itself day and night to prevent emergencies. Yesterday morning, the large number of refugees went to Xinchang Town.</p>
<h3 id="e265">The Case of Coffin Theft in Yuepu <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>The Stolen Coffins Are Mostly Those of Women</p>
<p>After the Theft, the Female Genitals Are Often Incomplete</p>
<p>Recently, cases of coffin theft and grave robbing have occurred frequently in the Ximeiyuan residential area in Yuepu Town, Baoyi. The coffin of Su, the late wife of Dr. Sheng Mingqiu of Wusong, was stolen. Sheng filed a complaint with the Baoshan County Government for strict investigation. Unexpectedly, the coffin of a Huang woman from Wusong was also stolen, and the coffin of a Zhao woman from Baoshan was also stolen in the same area. Upon inspection, nothing was missing except for a piece of the lower part of the female genitals. It is said that about 80 corpses have been stolen in this area in the past six months, exposing the corpses. Most of them are female coffins. What is strange is that after the theft, the female genitals are often incomplete, which has caused suspicion and different opinions. Some say that the silent incense used by general swordsmen and righteous men in ancient times must be made with this bone. Others say that the current traffickers use this bone to make ecstasy powder to confuse people. It is specially recorded for the research of the medical community.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Tao and Cai Reconcile After Divorce <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Tao Cai Wenqing, a young woman from Jiangning, previously hired a lawyer to sue her husband Tao Yiqing (the eldest son of the late famous doctor Tao Yinkang of this city) in the Local Court for abandonment, abuse, and Tao's impotence, requesting a divorce and demanding 8,000 yuan in compensation and 1,797 yuan in dowry fees. Judge Yang Keqian has repeatedly interrogated the case without a conclusion. Judge Yang has been transferred to be the President of the Wuxi Local Court, so this case has been changed to Judge Chen Bingxin for trial. The day before yesterday afternoon, another continued trial was held. Tao Yiqing did not attend. Only the acting lawyer Jiang Baolian attended. The plaintiff Tao Cai Wenqing and lawyer Chen Zemin attended and said that they had been ordered by the court to mediate, but the defendant did not seem to be sincere in mediation. They asked the court to make a judgment according to law. Then, lawyer Jiang said that the defendant was not unwilling to mediate. If it was an unconditional divorce, it could be accepted. As for the compensation, because the defendant's business has declined since his father Tao Yinkang's death, all the meager property is owned by his three younger brothers and two younger sisters. Moreover, the defendant is not here today, so the lawyer cannot be fully authorized to represent him. According to the plaintiff, the defendant does have more than 80,000 yuan of real estate, such as the houses on Tiandeng Lane and Minguo Road in this city, and there are still large deposits, so the number I requested can definitely be afforded by the defendant. The official asked if the compensation you are seeking can be reduced. She replied, please reduce it by the court. She was also asked whether she would return the original items of the dowry or appraise them. She replied, if everything is the same as on the list I opened, there is no need to calculate the money. The interrogating official then said to the two lawyers, the defendant is not here today, so this case cannot proceed. Please ask the two agents to go out and mediate again. If they still cannot reconcile, the trial will be held again at 28:00 this month. The court adjourned after the instructions were given.</p>

<p>It Turns Out She Was Abducted and Hidden by a Militia Member</p>
<p>The second team of the Pengpu Security Corps in Zhabei suddenly received a report from the plaintiff Zhang Qichang at about 9 p.m. the night before last (the 25th) that Yang Yufu, a militia member who had been dismissed by the team, reported that he was 23 years old, from Yangzhou, and lived at No. 80 Pushan Road. He made ribbons for a living. He had a younger sister named Xiaolan, who was 18 years old and had been promised to a son of the Sheng family in her hometown. On the 15th of this month, my father, Dingjiu, sent Xiaolan home to get married. Unexpectedly, Xiaolan suddenly disappeared when the Yangzhou ship docked at the pier. I immediately searched everywhere without success. The people and Yang Yufu are neighbors, and Xiaolan and Yang's wife are very close and travel back and forth very often. Moreover, Yang Yufu also went to Yangzhou three days after Xiaolan left, which is obviously very suspicious. For this reason, he was arrested and sent to the team for interrogation. According to Yang Yufu's confession, my adoptive father Gao Songchao opened a pancake shop in Yangzhou. Recently, he became seriously ill and sent a letter requesting money and urging me to go to Yangzhou. Because I went to Yangzhou to visit him the day before, I didn't know anything about Zhang Xiaolan's escape. The team verified the confession and believed that the case involved abduction and the confessions of both parties were different, so they sentenced him to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. After the team's Pushan Road substation squad leader Qiao Huaqing inquired further, Yang Yufu's wife revealed the truth, saying that Xiaolan was indeed abducted and hidden by her husband and has now been brought back from Yangzhou and hidden in a certain place in Pudong. After hearing this, Squad Leader Qiao immediately reported to the team headquarters and led plainclothes officers to investigate and found Xiaolan and arrested her. According to Xiaolan's confession to the Third District Public Security Bureau, she and Yang Yufu took a boat to Zhenjiang, transferred to a fourth-class car to Shanghai, stayed in an inn for two nights, and then sent her to Yang's friend's place for only one night. Xiaolan is currently being held in the district because it is Sunday and will be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Pirates Rob Fishing Boats Again <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Since this spring, pirates have been rampant on the waters of Daji Mountain outside Wusongkou. In recent months, fishing boats carrying goods have been robbed of silver dollars by pirates, or the crew members have been kidnapped and held for ransom, which has caused fishing boats to not dare to transport them, so they have asked the Fishery Association to petition the water police to strictly suppress them and send police ships to patrol and protect them in the waters. Now is the fishing season, and the fishing boats going back and forth to the market are even more prosperous. If they are not suppressed, the navigation is worrisome, so the association has petitioned the water police district to strictly suppress them to secure the shipping merchants. At the moment, the water police are suppressing them and have ordered patrol boats to patrol the waters and informed the fishing boats to carry out transportation as usual. However, on the 20th of this month, the Zheng Zhangsheng fishing boat was fully loaded with fresh yellow croaker in Ningbo and was transporting it to Shanghai for sale. Unexpectedly, when it sailed to the south entrance of Daji Mountain, it encountered a large group of pirates sailing in more than a dozen small boats. They fired their guns and ordered them to stop. A helmsman was shot and killed and the boat was also shot with holes. When Zheng's boat stopped, dozens of pirates swarmed onto the boat, all speaking with a Taizhou accent and threatening them with guns to prevent them from making a sound. The pirates searched everywhere and only found more than 200 yuan, which made them very angry. The pirates dragged a group of people out and asked where the shipowner was. The group did not understand the Taizhou language, so they could not answer. The pirates randomly slashed at them. The shipowner Zheng heard the sound and came out, and the pirates beat him and forced him to hand over the silver dollars. When they failed, they kidnapped him and left. When they left, they said to the crew members to prepare 2,000 yuan to redeem the shipowner. After the pirates left, Zheng's boat sailed to the seaside of Chuansha and borrowed money from other boats to buy a coffin to collect the helmsman and send the injured crew members to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the crew members came to Shanghai to report to the fish market that the boat had been shot with holes and had to be repaired before it could sail, so the market hired a boat to transport and sell the goods from Zheng's boat and petitioned the water police to arrest the pirates.</p>

<h3 id="e273">Mr. Fei Tang's Report <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Abstract of Translated Sections from the First to Third Volumes (3)</p>
<p>Chapter 5 continues to describe how the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) obtained recognition for its demands to define and restrict the actions of Chinese authorities within the International Settlement, thus gradually implementing its functions and establishing a system of rule of law within the Settlement. The key points regarding the establishment of its demands are summarized into four categories as follows: (1) Courts: In 1864, the Mixed Court (會審公廨) was first established in the International Settlement. A judge appointed by the Daotai (道台) and an assessor appointed by the consuls of the treaty powers jointly tried cases. Subsequently, the court was recognized, within certain limits, to exercise its criminal and civil jurisdiction over Chinese residents and foreign nationals without extraterritorial rights within the Settlement. Before the establishment of the Mixed Court, all Chinese residents in the Settlement who committed crimes were handed over to Chinese officials outside the Settlement for interrogation. After its establishment, the exercise of judicial power by Chinese authorities within the International Settlement was restricted, and the punishment of criminals and judicial administration within the Settlement became more suitable to the needs of the Settlement. (2) Police: In order to prevent yamen runners from the Chinese city from arresting Chinese residents within the Settlement, the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) had to demand exclusive police power within the International Settlement. Later, it sought to obtain further demands, that is, Chinese residents arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) police should be pre-tried by the Mixed Court before being handed over to officials outside the Settlement, so as to ascertain whether the arrested person had a prima facie case of crime. (3) Taxes: The difficulties arising from the collection of various taxes within the International Settlement in the early days by the Chinese authorities are described. The gradual achievement of the Council's demands, such as the prohibition of establishing likin bureaus (釐局) within the Settlement, the prohibition of likin officers from operating within the Settlement, and the final recognition of the principle that Chinese officials shall not collect other taxes in the Settlement other than customs duties and land taxes. It is also traced in the report that unapproved taxes, such as collection by tax collectors within the Settlement, and punishment when detected, etc. (4) Legislation: The Shanghai Daotai and the judges of the Mixed Court often issued proclamations within the International Settlement intending to give them legal effect. How the habit of issuing them is described in this chapter. How the Council opposed this type of proclamation is also explained. The provisions in the proclamation sometimes interfered with the property rights and business rights of residents within the International Settlement. The matter was discussed by both sides. The final result was that the proclamations of the Shanghai Daotai or the judges of the Mixed Court could not be posted in the International Settlement without the consent of the consular body and the Council. How the Council's opinions on these various issues and the truth about the fundamental issues involved can be expressed by modern official documents is cited in the report. The following is its commentary. As far as specific events are concerned, it is not necessarily certain whether the Council's observation of facts or its argument for the interpretation of treaties is accurate, but the difficulties it encountered were real and important. This is not likely to be wrong. The Council has been working hard to build a suitable system of governance, partly based on customs beyond the letter of the treaties, on the grounds that the treaties (including the Land Regulations) must be applied. However, if the treaties are not supplemented by customs in accordance with the circumstances at the time, the wording of the treaties will be full of obstacles and difficult to implement, and the jurisdiction over the Settlement proposed in the treaties will be of no value. The Chinese authorities' use of pressure to establish its demands by the Council is often regarded as a means of foreign invasion, or as a part of what is now called "foreign imperialism." Foreign consuls' insistence on protecting the leaders of foreign communities inside and outside the Settlement sometimes seems to be merely a selfish desire to protect their private interests, the most prominent being the landowning interests of foreigners inside and outside the Settlement. However, from the perspective of the Council, which is truly responsible for governance, the issue at hand has a direct impact not only on the welfare of tax-paying Chinese and residents within the Settlement, but also on the interests of foreigners and the prosperity and progress of the entire International Settlement. The Council's declaration states that the directors of the Council believe that if their main point of contention, namely that the exercise of authority by Chinese officials over Chinese residents within the Settlement must be restricted, cannot be achieved, then the Council will be unable to implement an effective system of governance within the International Settlement in accordance with the Land Regulations, and there may be even greater hidden disputes in the overall situation. In essence, the difficulty that the Council seeks to resolve is not merely a conflict between two governing bodies, but a conflict between two governing principles. Within this conflict, the International Settlement governing body represents the limited powers exercised under the control of the courts. If the unlimited powers exercised by the Chinese authorities within the International Settlement are not restricted, then the limited powers will inevitably be overthrown. If this fact can be recognized, then the resentment aroused by past conflicts among the Chinese people, a part of which still harbors resentment and is sufficient to influence political action, may be calmed. In fact, the current Chinese government has already established a goal to include the governing principles that foreigners, whether they understand them or not, have always strived for in the national constitution. What is this principle? It is to establish the rule of law as the only effective way to maintain individual freedom and protect civil rights.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Chapter 6 <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Traces the history of the issue of Chinese representation in the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) of the International Settlement. When the Land Regulations proposed in 1866 were discussed, the proposal to elect Chinese representatives was discussed. At that time, the consular body also drafted a method proposing that representatives and leaders of various Chinese organizations elect three Chinese representatives to form an advisory committee to consult with the Council on matters relating to Chinese residents. The Chairman of the Council once sent a letter stating his opinion on this proposed method. This letter was published in December 1866. The Council's acceptance of Chinese representatives is an innovation that may cause differences of opinion, but it does not seem to have adverse results. If it can improve the friendship between China and foreign countries, the benefits will be great. Knowing the opinions of the Chinese on Chinese administrative orders is beneficial to foreigners. On the Chinese side, they can gain true knowledge of the free representative system prevailing in our country and the fair judicial administration that we value. The above-mentioned method of establishing a Chinese advisory committee was not included in the Land Regulations finally approved by the ministers of various countries in Beijing in 1869. The reason for this is not known. The formal re-mention of the issue of Chinese representation was delayed until nearly 40 years later. In December 1905, after the Mixed Court incident, Chinese business leaders cooperated with the Council to discuss the necessary measures to restore the original state. The result was a proposal to establish a recognition mechanism for future consultations between the Council and Chinese business leaders. This proposal can be found in a letter from Mr. Yu Qiaqing to the Chairman of the Council in February 1906. The letter stated that the Chinese have held a meeting, and all directors of the Shanghai business associations have attended and unanimously agreed to elect seven people to form a Chinese Chamber of Commerce to represent the interests of various industries. Later, a letter was sent clarifying that the name of the committee was the "Representative Committee." Officials do not join and do not participate in the election. The duties of the committee are to propose various suggestions to improve the welfare of the International Settlement. If existing regulations and rules relating to Chinese interests are to be changed, the Council is expected to give the committee an opportunity to consult first. The letter also stated that the purpose of establishing the committee is to enable the Council to know the opinions and feelings of Chinese groups on issues of particular interest to the Chinese, and to make the committee a recognition mechanism for Chinese residents to convey complaints to the Council, and to enhance credit and goodwill between the Chinese and foreign people and promote the welfare and progress of the International Settlement. The Council welcomed the above proposal, but this aroused criticism from the foreign press. In addition to other opposition points, the reason for the criticism from the foreign press was that the proposed committee would seek to confront the Council and was a dangerous thing. The committee was in a semi-official position and was produced through formal election procedures. During the recent incident, Chinese officials' attitude of showing hatred towards the Council may be used to secretly plot to undermine the Council's power, which is frightening. However, some commentators strongly urged the election of two Chinese to join the board of directors, believing that using this method to know the opinions of the Chinese at any time is better than using other methods. In March 1906, Western taxpayers continued to hold an annual meeting and passed a proposal denying the Council the right to recognize the proposed establishment of the committee, on the grounds that the Council did not have this right according to the Land Regulations. The following commentary was made on the rejection of the proposed establishment of the Chinese committee at that time. According to the official documents listed above, the attempt to establish a mechanism for the Council to contact Chinese groups in the Settlement did not produce results. This incident is unpleasant to read, because the Western taxpayers' opposition led to the loss of a great opportunity. This is an undeniable conclusion. This opportunity would have allowed the development of the International Settlement system to take a step further, and after a period of time, a significant effect could have occurred to make the relationship between the Council and foreign communities and Chinese residents in the Settlement more satisfying and sound. There may have been sufficient reasons to treat the proposed method with caution, but the Chinese groups clearly initiated this motion out of friendship, and the Council had already made such progress in approaching the Chinese, but the Western taxpayers' annual meeting completely rejected it, which was a major misfortune. The suggestion was initiated by the Chinese and suddenly frustrated, and its impact seems to have been enough to prevent the Chinese from continuing to propose the original proposal for many years, and enough to alienate the Chinese from the Council and not support it. In the following 20 years, the Council had extremely important issues to deal with. If it could have obtained the assistance of the Chinese, the benefits would have been extremely great. The draft treaty for the extension of the International Settlement was passed by the taxpayers' annual meeting in March 1915, one of the conditions of which was to propose the establishment of a Chinese advisory council, but because the draft treaty was not approved, the proposal could not become a reality. The original proposal was revived in 1920 and the taxpayers' annual meeting passed the establishment of a Chinese advisory committee. The committee was established in May 1921. All of these points are mentioned in the report. The report indicates that after the May Thirtieth Movement in 1925, the issue of Chinese representation took on a new aspect. The resignation of the Chinese advisory committee was one of the results of the incident. On April 14, 1926, a motion was put forward at the taxpayers' annual meeting in favor of accommodating Chinese representatives. The motion was passed by the meeting and it was subsequently decided to set up three Chinese directors and six Chinese committee members, which was implemented in April 1928. The report also mentioned that the number of Chinese directors was increased from three to five in May 1930.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Chapter 7 <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Discusses the historical position of the Chinese in the administration of the International Settlement with regard to paying taxes and sharing the benefits of municipal services within the Settlement. The question is why the former Council had no Chinese representatives and why there were no regulations to ensure that the Council's policies and administrative methods were subject to a systematic consultation between the Council and representatives recognized as representing the Chinese residents in the Settlement. Although the Council had no regular contact with Chinese public opinion representatives, was the Council fair in its treatment of Chinese interests? The increase in the number of Chinese residents in the International Settlement is discussed as follows: Since 1876, the number of Chinese residents in the International Settlement has gradually increased, which shows that most Chinese believe that the situation within the Settlement is better than that outside the Settlement. The reason why they believe it is better is probably because the International Settlement is the center of commerce and industry and has economic attractiveness. There is no doubt about this. However, the economic situation is closely related to the administrative situation. The continuous migration of Chinese to the International Settlement can also prove that they know that the Settlement system is beneficial. The nature of this benefit is very real. The previous chapter has described that the Council has adopted various methods to protect the interests of the Chinese from the arbitrary actions of officials outside the Settlement. The gradual expansion of Chinese commerce within the International Settlement is also a very important reason for this protection. The outstanding achievements of municipal management in the International Settlement have resulted in a great improvement in the living conditions within the Settlement, and most Chinese also enjoy it. The Chinese must pay taxes on time, but the tax rates are fixed and the benefits of compensation are obvious. The methods used by Chinese officials in various districts outside the Settlement to levy and collect taxes are lax and irregular, so that the taxes levied are not fixed and are often arbitrary and prone to harshness. For ambitious merchants, the tax is even more harsh because their business is smooth and their financial resources are abundant. After paying the tax, there is no guarantee of what compensation benefits will be received. The taxes collected locally are used to provide public services for the direct benefit of the taxpayers, rather than for the benefit of the collecting officials or their subordinates, or the tax-contracting agencies. However, the Chinese administrative authorities had little understanding of this view until recently. The excellent road administration and effective police services in the International Settlement clearly demonstrate how the taxes collected by the Council are used. The report indicates that the issue to be considered in the title of this chapter is not so much whether the Chinese in the Settlement are better off under the rule of the Settlement than if they were ruled by Chinese officials outside the Settlement, but rather whether the administration of the Settlement, on the whole, treats the Chinese and foreigners fairly.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>My relative suddenly suffered from mental illness in the past two decades. It was caused by thoughts that were too lofty, complicated, and pessimistic about life, and also by stimulation. Sometimes it is literary, sometimes martial, sometimes clear, sometimes dizzy. I don't know if there is any remedy or secret recipe that can be sought. Please disclose it in your newspaper and solicit it from benevolent people at home and abroad to inform us. I wish you the blessings of spring.</p>
