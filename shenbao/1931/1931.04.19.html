<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>北平之前門左近有一個小小的香烟廠廠設在一家商舗的門首掛着巿招陳列着種種香烟有一隻手摇的捲烟機專爲製造香烟之用廠主爲劉某一身兼老關而工人另僱有孩童若干名專在各處路上拾取烟尾供給廠中的原料因爲這個小小香烟所用的烟葉並不是新鮮的烟草乃是收集各種烟尾重新捲製罷了劉某每日命孩童至各處拾取那己爲人遺棄了的烟尾以極便宜的代價爲償又把收集來的烟尾加以選擇歸類以備製造這廠裏出售的屁股香烟（新名詞）也有各種牌號價錢也不是一律譬加你要茄力克或是白金龍都可以向他要他就把選擇的一樣牌子的烟屁股於在捲烟機裏給你捲不一刻烟捲好了付了價錢（大約至多二枚銅元）你就可以吸了劉某這烟廠開幕至今己有幾年的歷史一向生意很好賺的錢己不少劉某自己也是拾香烟屁股出身的人故於此道很有研究</p>
<p>查通都大邑中常見有拾香烟屁股之輩以一布袋和一竹鉗巡邏於市街收集得多了就賣給小香烟公司以備一製造普通的香烟當新香烟出賣劉某這個計畫更來得妥當分門别類以賤價出售這是他的别出心裁之處也無怪乎要發起小財來了</p>

<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>近數年來我國有一絶好之現象關於工商業之發展者至鉅即廣告事業突呈蓬勃之氣象是也多數著名之商公司亦羣知移其目光於文字及美術之宣傳優薪聘請專家擔任其事更不惜犧牲巨大之金錢劃作經常費用而專門爲工商業服務之廣告公司亦如雨後春筍日見怒發吾人衹須一察近年來新聞事業之進步即可聯想及此與新聞息息相關之廣告有以輔助之也</p>
<p>不佞之從事廣告研究遠在八九年前衹以當時商界之能注意此道者少實則大多數商公司對於廣告宣傳之効力猶未有相當之信仰也予以所學之不爲社會用也乃轉移其心力於著述方面從事新聞事業然而研究廣告之興味猶未嘗或怠也去歲應此間某大公司之招重來海上專司廣告之職接觸旣多對於研究廣告之興趣亦愈濃而友輩如徐卓呆倪古蓮等亦皆抛棄賣文生涯而從事廣告撰述一昨鄺笑菴君招飲酒酣之餘鄺君詢余近况因作一聯自嘲云『鐵硯曾磨穿剩有餘情作廣告銀毫己寫秃更無心緒爲文章』句雖滑稽亦聊誌感慨云爾</p>
<p>最近廣告事業之新發起者有黄包車廣告電桿木廣告而交通廣告公司則獨包兩路之火車廣告美靈登公司則承包無軌電車之車身廣告爭奇鬭勝皆足引起一般人之注意又如先靈公司更利用無綫電廣播之力演說報告廣告在一分鐘之内可使廣告效力佈報逹全國亦神奇也己</p>
<p>至於報紙廣告亦較前進步蓋不僅注意於文字且知研求美術觀乎畫報廣告之精美槪可知矣預料十年以後報紙藉廣告之助而銷行愈廣廣告藉報紙之力而收效愈宏雖廣告犧牲之代價愈大而登户必愈衆以予個人之推測則十年之後報紙廣告之刋例每英寸且以三元計算乃必然之事實也</p>

<p>印度之人生觀以最高尙之神德爲標準故輕視肉體之幸福而信定命論富貴貧賤夀天皆爲天命而人生夫婦永無離婚之事夫死妻永不再嫁惟妻死夫可再娶近新潮雖起離婚之事難行於印度也</p>
<p>吾觀印度畫處處含神意女性尤然頗有一種綿邈悠遠之神甚有眞善美之趣多有畫丈夫爲僧拒絶女子或修道而遠女性者此印度人生觀也</p>

<p>歷來一般之醫家因未明膫肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性構造，以爲凡爲病菌盡可以消毒之樂劑，用内服或注射之方法撲滅之，一如「六零六」之注射於梅毒也，自柏格爾博士ＤＲ．ＢＥＲＧＥＬＬ苦心研究後，始發表肺結核有一種特殊之防禦力，能抵抗一切外來藥力之攻擊，蓋肺結核菌體，係中性脂肪之内膜，及抗酸性蠟質之外膜構成，若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其脂肪性之　裝則無由俘擒結核菌，而置之死地且結核菌，侵入人體局部時，其四週即被侵蝕，而形成頑强之結節，以阻碍血流之通過，致使注射或内服之一般消毒藥劑，無由越雷池一步，宛如特别戒嚴之禁區，藥力旣無從接觸患部，則雖溺沉全身於藥池中，　亦不能傷結核菌之毫髮，是故撲滅肺結核菌之唯一作戰方略，至少必須具下列之兩種先决條件，　　（一）凡藥能破壞結節，而直逹患部者，</p>
<p>（二）又能剥奪或溶解其蠟質及脂肪性之内外膜者，</p>
<p>如此，始能奏破關斬將之功，否則隔鞋搔養，彼結核菌，且在此兩種保障之下，竊笑人之莫余害也</p>
<p>肺結核菌發明家德國聖醫考克博士</p>
<h3 id="c191">肺結核菌之脫蠟術成功 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>自考克博士，發見結核菌爲肺結核症（即肺癆）之原體以來，東西結核學者，爭先研侒，欲期得一殺滅此菌之妙方，但其結果，盡歸失敗，蓋因彼等，不知結核菌，能分泌一種蠟質，包圍其本體以禦外力侵入之深奥學理故也，曾有哈莫塞哈黎氏等，發見應用百分之五至十之苛性加里液，而得除去結核菌之抗酸性蠟質，後有莫純氏，應用鹽素瓦斯，而变得除去抗酸性蠟質，然此種脫蠟法，衹能適用於顯微鏡檢查上染色法而己，蓋其藥性剿則毒，對於人體，終不能實用也</p>
<p>近數年來偶有將大楓子油，應用於痲瘋症，而獲意外之奏效者，蓋麻瘋菌，與肺結核菌爲同性質之抗酸菌而大楓子油，能有脫蠟之作用，兼具石炭酸百倍以上之殺菌力，於是一般學者，遵引起熱狂的注意，試以大楓子油．應用於結核症患者冀圖奏效，而用種種之化學的方法，提出大楓子油之主要成分，試用於結核症患者，亦期得相當之效果，然衹限於皮膚及表在性結核症，能奏良效，而對於深部的臟器，如肺臟，肝臓，腎臟等結核，則仍不能奏何等之效果，</p>
<p>因此，我普天下結核病者之大恩師，柏格爾博士，百尺竿頭，再進一步，搜集動植礦物性之各種藥物，而苦心研究，期得一種有脫蠟作用，而藥性和平無毒者孜孜數十年，不知絞盡幾許臘汁，瀝盡幾許心血，以求最大合理最有效之化學劑不己，終發見特殊動物之腸間膜線壓線愿縮汁中某一種有效成分，對於結核菌，有强力脫蠟之作用，乃即將此撙成分，作用於結核菌，則其結果，完全脫蠟．自此昔日東西各醫家，所視爲人工不能除去結核菌抗酸性之主張，完全推翻，誠前後千古醫學界一大疑問的肺結核治療之新曙光也</p>
<h3 id="c192">肺結核之化學療法 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺勞）之原因是結核菌，而此菌一入人體内，則於該處，便成結節以斷血行之路，又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質，包圍其體，以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入，故雖用種種殺菌藥，内服或注射，終不能逹其病菌之實體内歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法，對症療法，理學的療法，血清療法，藥劑療法，及其他一切治療法等以尙未完全成功，而肺癆無藥之說，遍滿於一世者因未知此深奥學一故耳由此現代結核學者，根據上述之學理，繼續研究，不遺餘力，結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑，名曰三那星Ｓanosln此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者，據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告，此藥有滲透肺病　之結節及溶解蠟質之作用，兼具有殺菌力，能根治一二三期之肺癆，確有萬試萬靈之特效，在中國，業經國民政府中央衞生試驗所化驗，藥性和平無毒，絶無任何副作用，兹略舉醫治作用於下，</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中實驗「三那星」之藥力作用，則一分鐘後，結核菌皆消失其抗酸性，至三分鐘後，則此肺結核菌，完全殺盡，無一倖免，</p>
<p>（二）依動物試驗，則發見「三那星」能滲入結核病竈内，設撿查其病竈内潛伏之結核菌，則盡失其抗酸性，此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣，</p>
<p>（三）如患者内　「三那星」一星期左右，則立見咯痰稀釋，體熱下降等良好狀態，</p>
<p>（四）更　續内　「三那星」選三十天至六十天以上，則顧見體重增加，食慾激進．一切症狀，</p>
<p>逐漸緩和，并遂其回天再造之偉功，</p>

<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>奉了兩恊約國政府委任之後我即根據兩日前條陳法國務總理的確定了我作戰的計劃重述如上</p>
<p>（一）法英兩軍務必密切連接掩護亞眠</p>
<p>（二）以此爲目的己在作戰的軍隊務必固守他們的陣地</p>
<p>（三）在他們掩護之下法國援兵下車完畢後第一步增厚英國第五軍</p>
<p>第二步集合待命</p>
<p>英軍獨自爲戰以救護海峽漢口和法軍獨戰以救護巴黎的計劃取銷我們現在决定英法兩軍聯合作戰以救護亞眠就是兩軍的交接點</p>
<p>我更爲擬定施行細則到了緊逼的時候我親向有關係的主要軍官詳細解釋遂於下午四點鐘我偕同英國第五軍司令高夫將軍到杜里我訓令他務必留在前敵嚴飭軍士固守陣地以待法軍開到從南面開始局部調防</p>
<p>我復在杜里遇着後備隊司令福悅將軍的參謀長布塞勒米將軍同樣的訓令他務必固守亞眠</p>
<p>我請法軍司令部的聯絡官瑪琅少校把這些軍令報告貝當將軍我復以電話通知第一軍司令狄朋尼將軍訓令他應如何進行</p>
<p>這支軍隊正向着孟鐵第歐列陣其地位特别重要因爲英法兩軍的陣綫的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>重新連接當時完全靠它我因把電話從杜里接通到梅納萊與狄朋尼將軍直接談話說明他的任務就是呌他把所有的隊伍開到前綫更替英國第十八軍團更替下來的軍隊調歸高夫將軍充作後備軍他試須與左面洛夫勞方面的英軍連接固守戰綫</p>
<p>即在當天二十六日我己把我的計劃通知前敵各司令晚上貝當將軍把三月二十四日的訓令取銷並且命令福悅將軍掩護亞眠及維持與海格總指揮的軍隊聯絡他更下令從别的軍團抽調步兵十師砲兵四團向後備隊增援</p>
<p>在巴黎停留一夜我在二十七的早上仍舊同了魏肯將軍及狄鐵克上校向前綫出發出發之前我寫一密函給貝當將軍堅囑根據計劃進行且請共向法軍說明其必要貝當將軍及其部下頗能本此計劃恊力迎敵無待費辭</p>
<p>我先到克羅孟第三軍司令亨保特將軍的司令部遇着了福悅將軍我申述我的訓令就是固守陣地非到第一功告成不能更替任何軍隊</p>
<p>下午十二時三十分鐘我到杜里看高夫將軍英軍右翼同法軍左翼間的聯絡因受英國第十八軍團幾隊兵士的急遽退却的影響以致不甚穩固我遂把新計劃向法國第一軍左翼司令莫斯堡將軍說明且請高夫將軍親去證實英國第十八軍團己否接得我的訓令和是否照此進行</p>
<p>我再到保格斯訪英國第三軍司令裴格將軍他向我說明他那面的形勢尙不嚴重他對我的作戰計劃表示完全贊同很願盡力促其成功</p>
<p>因爲缺少總預備隊不能開頭就恢復陣綫現在第一步急須實行的就是從速鎔接己被德軍攻破及伸長的陣綫的各段落最緊要的是無論退却的士卒或開到的援兵更無論其國籍務須一德一心統力合作因爲任何軍隊一切調防的計劃現己暫行擱置倘使此點不能做到這幾天裏就没有挫敵的希望了（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Zhang Xueliang Has Arrived in Beiping <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yu, Wang, and Others Welcomed Him at Lutai</p>
<p>Beiping Flying Flags for Three Days to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Beiping Zhang Xueliang arrived in Beiping at midnight on the 18th. Zhu Guangmu, Fu Zuoyi, and others arrived with him.

He said that once the affairs here are taken care of, he will go to the capital to assist the department. Tomorrow, the personnel will arrive in Tianjin. Deputy offices will be set up in Ningbo and Shenyang. Regarding the Sino-Russian issue, Moscow yesterday organized a committee to recover the railway to specifically discuss the matter of recovering the railway. (Special dispatch, morning of the 19th)</p>
<p>Beiping Zhang Xueliang left Shenyang last night to come to Beiping. He passed Tangshan at 3:00 PM today and arrived in Tianjin at 6:30 PM, and is expected to arrive in Beiping at 10:00 PM.

(Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Beiping More than a dozen households on the left and right sides of Zhang's residence in Xin Jian Hutong have been relocated to house Zhang's guards. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Tianjin Zhang Xueliang's special train passed Shanhaiguan on the 18th, and passed Tangshan at 3:40 PM. Yu Xuezhong traveled from Beiping to Tianjin by car at noon on the 18th, and joined Wang Shuchang, Zhang Xueming, and others to take a special train east to welcome him at Lutai. Zhang's train passed Lutai at 5:00 PM. At 6:10 PM, the lead car arrived in Tianjin. Those who welcomed him at the East Station were all issued entrance passes by the Second Army Headquarters. Zhang arrived at the East Station at 6:35 PM. First, he summoned the heads of the provincial government departments and bureaus, and spoke to them on the train. Next, he met with representatives of the Party headquarters, then representatives from the gentry and business communities. Finally, he sent Zhu Guangmu to meet with reporters, saying that the deputy commander was tired from the long journey, and that he had already spoken extensively with representatives from various circles. He sent his brothers to thank everyone for their warm welcome, and would speak with everyone again when passing through Tianjin from Beiping. Then, he answered the reporters' questions as follows: 1. The list of department heads of the Deputy Commander's Office is as reported. It will be officially announced upon Zhang's arrival in Beiping. The headquarters will be established immediately. 2. The length of Zhang's stay in Beiping is currently undetermined. 3. Li Shizeng discussed the Cultural Guidance Committee very little when he went to Shenyang. Further discussions will be held after arriving in Beiping. 4. It is not yet fully determined whether Zhang will go to the capital. If there are not many affairs in Beiping, he will go to the capital to attend the National Assembly. There are no major proposals, only reports to the central government on the political and diplomatic situation in the Northeast. 5. The issue of the Jin Army is very complicated. Zhang has agreed to be responsible for raising one million yuan in the near future for reorganization expenses. Fu Zuoyi came from Shenyang on the train and got off in Tianjin. The Chief of Staff of the Deputy Office, Ji Yiqiao, also got off in Tianjin. Wang Shuhan will go directly to Nanjing in the next few days. There was also a train car of entourage behind the special train. At 6:55 PM, the lead car departed. At 7:10 PM, the special train departed. Yu Xuezhong and Wang Shuchang went to Beiping with the train. In other news, Zhang has decided to go to the capital before the opening of the National Assembly. He has sent Zhu Lihan, Zhao Yanxu, and Wang Lixu, Deputy Directors of the Military Affairs Department of the Northeast Frontier Defense Headquarters, by plane to the North. Chen Haihua, Chief of Staff of the Naval Command, and Yang Fengchun, Director, arrived in Tianjin at 10:00 PM on the 17th to prepare everything for going to the capital. It is also heard that Zhang is scheduled to go to the capital by plane from Beiping at the beginning of next month. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Legislative Yuan Passed the New Export Tariff Law <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Maximum Rate of 7.5%</p>
<p>Nanjing At the 140th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 18th, the revised export tariff law was passed, covering more than 260 items, with a maximum rate of 7.5%. The silk regulations stipulate that tariffs will be levied in grades ranging from 7.5 yuan to 15 yuan. Tea was previously exempt from tax once every three years, but now, in order to develop overseas sales due to declining exports, it is completely exempt from tax. Soybeans will continue to be taxed according to the previous tariff without any increase. It is heard that during the discussion, many revisions were made to the classified tax rates proposed by the Ministry of Finance. For example, factories exporting large quantities of shirts and machines all requested exemption from export tax, while small factories or household products would still pay tax due to unclear procedures, which was unfair. The Legislative Yuan has revised this to provide equal treatment. As for revenue, the previous annual revenue was 20 million. The revised proposal submitted by the Ministry of Finance could generate an annual revenue of over 45 million. After being revised by the Legislative Yuan on the 18th, it has been reduced to around 40 million. The proposal can be submitted to the government council next week for approval and promulgation.

<p>Nanjing British Ambassador Lampson arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 18th. At 3:00 PM, he accompanied Counselor Teichman to the official residence of Foreign Minister Sa Chia-wan to continue discussing Sino-British legal rights with Foreign Minister Wang and Xu Mo, Director of the European and American Affairs Department, until 4:30 PM. It is heard that the British Ambassador brought the answer from his government, which was presented and discussed with Foreign Minister Wang. As a result, there is some room for compromise on the points of contention between the two sides, and the negotiation situation is still good. Lampson is scheduled to exchange opinions with a certain authority on our side again on the 19th. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Nanjing A certain person in diplomatic circles talked about the Sino-British legal rights issue. There have been about ten formal and informal negotiations. Nine-tenths of the issues have been approached. This negotiation is the final five minutes. Our diplomatic authorities should do their best to deal with it and strive for a solution before the National Assembly. The concern of the British and American sides is that after the abolition of consular jurisdiction, their overseas Chinese in China may feel insecure about their lives and property. Our side has explained this in detail and cited the fact that Germany and Russia have no consular jurisdiction in China, but German and Russian overseas Chinese do not feel any unfair treatment, as stated in the first note to various countries last year. This fact is very obvious. The current negotiation situation is just like a newly built building, with all the beams and pillars ready, waiting only for the joints to be connected. (18th)</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Recent Trend of the German-Austrian Customs Union <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in the European situation, the German and Austrian sides want to start by concluding a customs union, first creating economic cooperation between the two countries, and then approaching countries such as Russia and Italy to form a faction. The French side wants to start by uniting the Little Entente countries, organizing an economic union in Central and Eastern Europe to form a faction to resist Germany and Austria. This situation is already obvious. According to a Paris telegram, the French government convened a special cabinet meeting today to discuss countermeasures against the German-Austrian customs union. The results showed that it was generally believed that Briand's countermeasures were sufficient to resolve the difficulties of the Central and Eastern European countries and were very compatible with the League of Nations's policies. France has the determination to implement its policies to deal with Germany and Austria. From the perspective of Germany and Austria, Germany has notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations that the German government is very willing to take the opportunity of the meeting to report in detail for discussion. The Austrian government has also issued a declaration saying that Austria has followed the advice of the British Foreign Secretary and agreed to temporarily suspend the progress of the German-Austrian customs union and wait for the League of Nations Council to resolve it. This move is a step in the same direction as Germany, unwilling to let the agreement become a reality without room for maneuver. If the League of Nations meeting is good at mediation in the future, there is still hope to save this crisis in the European political situation. Some say that the reason why the Austrian government issued this declaration is because there are many affairs in the country and the political situation is shaking, so there is no time to carry out the customs union. However, because the relationship of this move is important, the situation of the opposing parties and the impact of the future European situation must be considered thoroughly and cautiously. This may also be one of the reasons. Domestic Key Telegrams Two</p>

<p>Political Situation Gradually Clarifying</p>
<p>Cabinet Decides to Adopt an Active Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Stabilizing the Monetary System Considered the Most Important Task</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Berenguer Surrenders to Await Trial</p>
<p>Abdicated King Resides in England and France, Undecided</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: According to news from Paris and Madrid today, the governments of France and Chile have recognized the new Spanish government.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 18th: The interim government cabinet meeting on Friday evening decided that Spain should adopt a more active foreign policy and instructed the Geneva representative to express Spain's willingness to cooperate sincerely with the League of Nations. In addition, it was decided to formally recognize all debts from the monarchy era and, after the separation of church and state is implemented, to conclude a treaty with the Vatican. The Catalan region has fully coordinated with the central government, but the crisis in the Basque region has not been completely resolved. The central government has sent troops to suppress and prevent the local autonomous party from declaring independence. The battle cruiser "Alfonso XIII," which carried the abdicated king to France, has been renamed "Libertad." The cruisers "Alfonso VIII" and "Queen Ena" have also been renamed "España" and "Republica," respectively. The royal palace will be opened as a museum, and the palace gardens will be converted into public sports grounds. The local situation in the capital is stable, and public sentiment is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 17th: The new Minister of Finance, Brito, announced the Republican Party's financial policy today: (1) Respect all debts established by the former dictator. (2) The Spanish government supports the republican policy. (3) The government is confident that monetary stability can be achieved through ordinary means. The government does not want to waste huge sums of money to artificially support the exchange rate. Those who withdraw cash will temporarily be paid 10% in cash to avoid a shortage of paper money. Brito anticipates that everything will be stable in a few days, and everyone will think that the new country has existed for twenty years. The government has now sent two senior officials by plane to Barcelona, which shows the government's eagerness to avoid the obstacle of having one country within another. The special envoys will advise the Catalans to change their disturbing separatist tendencies, as the Catalans have created their own anthem and sent plenipotentiary ambassadors to Madrid. All of these actions have indicated their separatist tendencies. In 1872, when the short-lived republic was established, the Catalans wanted to wait for the convening of a legitimate parliament, but the parliament was not opened and the imperial system was restored. The Catalans have not yet responded to the steps taken by Prime Minister Zamora, indicating that they are still unwilling to sacrifice their current opportunity.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 17th: The situation in Spain as a whole seems to be developing favorably, but there is a communist strike in Seville, and many farmers are gathering in the suburbs with Soviet flags, but they were prevented from entering the city by the military police.</p>

It is an unprecedented innovation in Spanish history for a woman to hold an important official position. Reuters, Barcelona, 17th: The Republican Party has selected candidates for the new provincial governors, but the Labor Party opposes them. Today, crowds in the streets are shouting and releasing prisoners. All trade is now completely suspended.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 18th: Former Prime Minister General Berenguer, who was always loyal to King Alfonso, was rumored to have fled to Portugal. Today, he actually surrendered himself in a solemn manner. The new Minister of Interior was working in his office at 11:00 AM when General Berenguer suddenly entered the room calmly and said, "I feel that it is my duty to surrender myself to the government. Please imprison me." However, the Minister of Interior treated this unexpected guest with courtesy and firmly refused to imprison him.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 17th: The Duke of Miranda, an aide to King Alfonso of Spain, told reporters today that the king's plans are undecided, whether to reside in England or temporarily stay in southern France. (Connecting to National News Agency) However, in the future, he will change his title to Duke of Toledo and wishes to live in obscurity, enjoying a little peace. He currently advocates waiting quietly for the results of the parliamentary elections in June before determining whether the monarchy can be restored.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th: Lord Tery of London is willing to offer his London residence for Alfonso to live in. This residence is one of the most famous mansions in the west end of London.</p>

<p>Austria's Political Situation Unstable, No Time to Proceed</p>
<p>League of Nations Administrative Council Will Submit for Discussion</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 17th: The German government recently notified the League of Nations Secretariat that the tariff truce conference had failed and that the Pan-European Committee would meet before the League of Nations Council meeting. The German government is very willing to take this opportunity to report the details of the German-Austrian tax agreement to the committee. This has attracted much attention from the League of Nations, because regardless of the outcome of the Pan-European Committee and the League of Nations Council's future discussions on the German-Austrian tax agreement, it will affect the path of new economic agreements between European countries. Representatives who have no direct relationship with this dispute hope that the valuable efforts and constructions of Germany and Austria should not be taken lightly. Now this discussion has become a political dispute. The League of Nations Secretariat is currently printing and sending the German Foreign Ministry's letter to various countries and has added the document to the agenda of the League of Nations Council meeting to be convened on May 18.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 17th: The Austrian government recently issued a declaration stating that the Austrian government, in order to respect the opinions of British Foreign Minister Henderson, has agreed to temporarily suspend the progress of the German-Austrian tax agreement pending resolution by the League of Nations Council and stated that this move is in step with Germany, so as not to make this agreement a fait accompli with no room for maneuver. It is said that the internal affairs of Austria are currently eventful, and the country is already shaky, with no time to proceed with the German-Austrian tax agreement.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 17th: A special cabinet meeting was convened today to discuss the German-Austrian partial tax agreement and France's counter-measures. The chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the two houses of Congress, the chairman of the Senate Tax Committee, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, etc. all attended. As a result, everyone agreed that Foreign Minister Briand's countermeasures are sufficient to solve the difficulties of countries in Central and Eastern Europe and are very suitable for the League of Nations' major policies.</p>

<p>But In Special Circumstances</p>
<p>Can Change Direction As Much As Possible</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 17th: US Secretary of State Stimson instructed the US Minister in Nicaragua to inform American expatriates that if they feel unsafe under the protection of the Nicaraguan government, they can withdraw from Nicaragua or at least move to coastal towns to get protection when necessary or to easily leave the country. Those who remain in the inland are responsible for their own safety and cannot hope that the United States will send troops deep into the interior to assist them. This is the new policy of the Hoover administration. American businessmen abroad must rely on foreign laws and not lightly request American intervention. This policy applies to Nicaragua and Latin American nations. British forces can be used to protect American lives, but cannot be involved in wars to protect American industries. However, in special circumstances, the authorities can change their policy. The United States will ask Nicaragua and other Central American countries to take full responsibility for maintaining order.</p>

<p>Mao's Division Captures Bandit Squad Leader Xie Guisheng</p>
<p>Han's Division Defeats Li Mingrui Who Invaded Anfu</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang moved from the west bank of the Gan River to the east bank of the Gan River, they initially used Ningdu as their base camp. Because the 19th Route Army advanced towards Ningdu from Ganzhou very quickly, they abandoned Ningdu and fled to Guangchang. The Mao and Xu Divisions of Zhu Shaoliang's troops of the 6th Route Army of the Bandit Suppression Army immediately attacked the important bandit nests on the border between Nanfeng, Yihuang, and Guangchang, such as Ningpi, Qiacun, Luofang, Ganzhu, and Qianshan City. They were successively occupied by the Mao and Xu Divisions. Recently, Director He obtained a telegram from Commander Zhu from Nanfeng stating that the 6th Route Army, in coordination with the police force, had recaptured Guangchang City at dawn. The bandits were routed in the direction of Toupi and Kuzhu. Hundreds of communist bandits were killed on the spot, dozens were captured alive, and mortars, counterfeit banners, and seals were seized. A search is currently underway in the surrounding city, etc. After receiving the telegram, He immediately telegraphed his praise. It was heard that the Sixth Route Army headquarters will advance from Nanfeng towards Guangchang in order to respond at the same time. The eighth division office stationed in the province received the telegram from Commander Mao stating that "This division has been searching and suppressing in Shuinan and Changqiao for days and captured a false guerrilla captain, Xie Guisheng, and killed more than 30 bandits. The false 12th Army Luo Binghui's gang has been routed in the direction of Shicheng." As for the west bank of the Gan River, after Li Mingrui's failed attack on Ji'an, he again attempted to harass Anfu and was dispersed by the Han Division and Zhang Brigade. Director He received the telegram from Han yesterday reporting victory, stating: "According to the report from Brigade Commander Zhang Zhong, several thousand remnants of the Red bandits Li Mingrui's false 7th Army and the Xiangdong Independent Division peasant bandits attacked Anfu on the 13th. On the morning of the 14th, at 12:00 AM, they launched a fierce attack. After two hours of internal and external attacks by our army, the bandit forces were defeated and fled west at dawn. Teams were immediately dispatched to pursue them, killing a platoon leader and dozens of bandits, capturing more than 20 people alive, and seizing more than a dozen carbines and more than a dozen rifles. [Signature] Han Deqin." Also, on the 5th and 6th of this month, the Han Division searched and suppressed the remaining bandits in Bibo, Muyuan, Zhuyuan, and Lukou Yingtang, successively killing hundreds of bandits and capturing the chairman of the False Gan-Southwest Anti-Rebellion Committee and the anti-rebellion judge Zhang Zhang. Zhang had killed thousands of people when Ji'an was captured, so the Han Division executed the prisoner on the spot. (April 17th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Xuzhou: After Wang Jun arrived in Zaozhuang on the 14th, Han Fuqu also arrived by special train from Teng County to Zaozhuang at noon on the 15th. During the meeting between Wang and Han, a thorough plan for jointly suppressing the bandits in Gu Fei was finalized. Wang and Han both stayed overnight in Zaozhuang that night. The next day (the 16th), Han took a car to Yi County for inspection and is scheduled to return to Teng County on the 17th. Wang left Zaozhuang on the evening of the 16th and returned to Xu this afternoon (the 17th) on the original A-class train. Staff Officer Su Zi, Adjutant Jin Shuzhi, and Li Wenbin, the brigade commander of the 21st Brigade of the 7th Division, also accompanied him. They are scheduled to go north to Linzao tomorrow to supervise the suppression. Wang told reporters at the Garrison Headquarters that some time ago, Han's army first launched a campaign to suppress the bandits in Mengshan. The bandits were unable to withstand the attacks, and a small number of them took the opportunity to flee west and join the bandits in Baodugu. There is also a tendency to collude with the bandits in Xijie Lake. At present, the remnants of the Mengshan bandits are still being suppressed by Han's army. The Baodugu bandits have been surrounded by Han's army and our army. Han's army has two divisions, with two division commanders in charge, launching attacks from the Yi County direction. Ma Hongda's unit has a regiment of cavalry and two regiments of infantry, also under the command of a brigade commander, launching attacks from the Teng County direction on the west side of the bandits. Chen Yaohan's two regiments, led by a brigade commander, have also set off west from Yizhou and will arrive soon. The 70th Regiment of the 12th Division, Chen Chuanwen's unit, has already advanced from Zaozhuang. This time, it was agreed with Han that all units should fully reach their designated locations yesterday afternoon (the 16th), and a general assault to suppress the bandits will begin this morning (the 17th). The 41st Regiment of our division is stationed along the Hanzhuang, Shagou, and Lincheng areas to protect the road and block the bandits. There are also railway artillery units dispatched to patrol and assist in the suppression. It is determined that the bandit forces can be eliminated in the shortest possible time. However, the Gu Fei bandits have been entrenched for a long time, the mountains are secluded, and there is a phenomenon of civilians and bandits being indistinguishable. Whenever nearby people who have joined the bandits see the large army launching an offensive, they often bury their guns or hand them over to the bandit leaders and go out empty-handed. Therefore, the suppression and arrest rely entirely on reports from the local militia. As for the bandits who have grown up in the mountains, they do not go out at all. They are now being surrounded and attacked from all sides, so they cannot escape. The attempt by the Xijie Lake bandits to sabotage transportation has been determined to be impossible to achieve, and so on. It is reported that the Baodugu bandit gang is estimated to have more than 4,000 people, with more than 2,000 guns. Most of them were Sun Meisong's troops. When they were offered amnesty, they did not all leave the mountains. The bandits sent a portion out to accept pacification, defraud money and supplies, and left a portion in the mountains to make a living without capital. Those who accepted pacification mutinied and returned to the mountains, forming a large gang again and becoming bandits. (17th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Jinan: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, has been in Teng County for several days, directing the various armies to suppress the bandits in Baodugu and inspecting all party and government affairs. Now that everything is largely in order, he took a special train to Zaozhuang for inspection at 9:00 AM on the 15th. He arrived in Zaozhuang at 1:30 PM that afternoon and stayed at the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company. Wang Jun, the division commander of the 7th Division, and Chen Yaohan, the division commander of the 26th Division, also arrived in Zaozhuang one after another when Han Fuqu arrived. Early in the morning of the 16th, a meeting was held at the Zhongxing Company to discuss the bandit suppression plan in detail. It is rumored that the general attack order to suppress the bandits may be issued within a day or two. Han Fuqu will go to Linyi and other areas from Zaozhuang to inspect. Zhang Yue of the Provincial Committee received a telegram from Han Fuqu and took the Jinpu Railway train number 201 from Jinan at 10:30 AM this morning to go south to Zaozhuang. (17th)</p>

<h3 id="e76">Truth About the Damage to the Sutras Stored in Hainan Temple <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan: After news of the burning of the Ming Dynasty Tripitaka Sutra stored in Hainan Temple in Yexian County came, the Education Department immediately telegraphed Yexian County Magistrate Ma Zhenfan and Inspector Peng to preserve the remaining volumes and sent Wang Xiantang, the curator of the Shandong Library, to Yexian County to investigate everything in detail. On the third day of Wang Xiantang's visit to Yexian County, Yexian County Magistrate Ma Zhenfan reported to the province that the Tripitaka Sutra in Hainan Temple had not been burned by the Normal School Training Institute. The Education Department, considering that the report was too simple and might not be the truth, did not believe it. Now Wang Xiantang has returned from Yexian County last night (the 16th) and went to the Education Department at 3:00 PM today to meet with Director He Siyuan and reported on the situation, saying that the Tripitaka Sutra was destroyed by the army and the militia. The Normal School Training Institute not only did not burn it, but also made efforts to preserve it. There are only 2,275 remaining volumes and some broken ones, packed in eight large boxes and eighteen burlap bags, all to be transported to the province for preservation. They will probably arrive tonight or tomorrow morning. Because this matter is important, I specially went to the library today to interview Wang and asked him about the process of investigating the Tripitaka Sutra in Yexian County and the extent of the damage. Wang said the following: "I was ordered by the Education Department to investigate the burning of the Tripitaka Sutra in Hainan Temple. I departed from Jinan on the morning of the 10th and arrived in Yexian County on the evening of the 11th, staying in a small restaurant. That night, I contacted County Magistrate Ma Zhenfan, Director Ge of the Education Bureau, and Director Wang of the Normal School Training Institute. The next day, I convened a meeting of people from all walks of life in the county to discuss everything and stated the Education Department's views on preserving the Tripitaka Sutra and the method of transporting it to the province. All walks of life expressed their agreement. The Tripitaka Sutra was originally stored in the Dabei Pavilion, which is inside the North Gate and was donated by Zhang Duan of the former Qing Dynasty. Zhang was from Yexian County. Last year, the Tripitaka Sutra was severely damaged and lost due to the stationing of troops. The previous county magistrate, Huang Da, sorted it out and transported it to Hainan Temple. The temple is located west of the city, about a mile away. The losses were even greater when it was transported in bamboo baskets. It was then placed upstairs for preservation. This year, the losses were even more severe due to the stationing of the militia, which moved it from upstairs and placed it under the eaves. The Tripitaka Sutra is a Sanskrit-style book, similar to bound calligraphy. In March this year, the Normal School Training Institute moved into the temple, and the principal of the school was responsible for sorting it out. There were two parts to the method: one part was to sort out the complete ones and store them in the room, and the other part was to sort out the broken ones and preserve them with bricks. After the meeting of people from all walks of life, we first went to Hainan Temple for inspection, and then at 6:00 PM, we sorted and packed the items together with people from all walks of life, using wooden boxes and burlap bags to pack the complete ones and burlap bags to pack the broken ones. The teachers and students of the Normal School Training Institute helped with the work. At the same time, the wooden boxes and burlap bags were numbered, sealed, and the number of complete volumes was checked. There were a total of 2,275 volumes. There were too many broken ones to count, and they were packed in eight large wooden boxes and more than ten burlap bags. Early in the morning of the third day, we hired large carts to transport them to Weixian County. During the transportation, I personally sent someone to escort them with transportation passports. It took three days to transport them from Yexian County to Weixian County. They were handed over to the Yuelai Company at the Weixian County Railway Station for transportation. They have not yet been transported to Jinan and will probably arrive at the library tonight or tomorrow. The plan is to sort out the complete ones as soon as possible and merge them with the existing Tripitaka Sutra in our library for storage. Because the broken ones are difficult to sort out at once, it will take some time to sort them out completely. The Tripitaka Sutra was previously rumored to have been burned, but it was not actually burned. The losses were entirely caused by the destruction of the army and militia stationed there previously. The local education authorities not only did not burn it, but also paid special attention to sorting it out and preserving it. The Tripitaka Sutra is divided into Taoist and Buddhist scriptures. Our library originally had a part of the Taoist and Buddhist scriptures, but they were not complete. The ones stored in Yexian County are Buddhist scriptures. We will try to find a complete set of these scriptures. Many large temples in Shandong Province have Tripitaka Sutras. We plan to petition the Education Department to issue a notice to the education bureaus of all counties to investigate. If there are any Tripitaka Sutras being preserved, we will find a way to transport them to Jinan and complete the incomplete ones. In addition, regarding the collection of books in Yang's Haiyuan Pavilion, the government is raising a large sum of money to prepare to buy them. I plan to rest for a few days and then go to Tianjin to contact Yang. At the same time, I will also negotiate the transportation of the eighty boxes of Tang Kai Ming Stone Classics engraved by Zhang Zongchang in Shandong to Shandong. The cost of engraving the stone classics was paid with public funds from Shandong and should be stored in Shandong. These stones are currently stored at Tao Lanquan's house in Tianjin. Tao is from Wujin, Jiangsu. He was the one who undertook the engraving and stored them at his house. When I go to Tianjin, I will handle the collection of books in Haiyuan Pavilion and this matter at the same time."</p>

<p>Establishment of a Military Training Committee to Train Officers and Soldiers</p>
<p>A dispatch from Shenyang: In order to improve efficiency and save expenses, the Northeast Border Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office has decided to reorganize. The original three offices of Secretary, Military Affairs, and Military Orders will be abolished, and the Chief of Staff and Secretary-General will be responsible for their affairs. On the night of the 14th, Zhang Xueliang specially issued a hand-written order appointing Rong Zhen as the Chief of Staff of the Border Defense Headquarters and Wu Jiaxiang as the Secretary-General. The original eight departments under the Military Affairs Office will remain the same. However, Wang Shouzhong, the director of the Military Balance Department, has been appointed as the director of the Tianjin Mint and was replaced by Xu Shiying yesterday. In addition, Wang Lie and Bai Guilin were appointed as Chiefs of Staff and Public Works Department at the same time. The staff of the Secretary's Office and the Secret Telegram Department under the Secretary-General will remain unchanged. In addition, in order to improve the training of officers and soldiers, Zhang decided to establish a Training Committee of the Northeast Border Defense Army. Zhang himself will serve as the chairman, with Rong Zhen, Zhou Lian, Hu Yukun, Wu Tailai, and Qin Hua as members. The committee is divided into five groups, each with a director. The candidates for the directors were also appointed by Zhang on the night of the 14th, including Xu Zuyi for the Education Group, Gao Yin Zhou for the Infantry Group, Zhao Zhenguo for the Cavalry Group, Feng Bingquan for the Artillery Group, and Guo Erzhen for the Technology Group. It is reported that the cavalry and artillery training supervision departments have already established a training committee and will be abolished separately. (April 15th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Beiping: Wu Tiecheng, a member of the Central Committee who inspected party affairs in the Northeast, arrived in Beiping yesterday morning by train from Shenyang. Accompanying him were Madam Wu and Wang Xingzhou, director of the Public Training Department of the Central Training Department, and six others. They arrived in Beiping at 10:10 AM today (the 17th). Representatives from all walks of life in Beiping went to the station to welcome him, including Zhou Xuechang, Chen Shiquan, Dong Lin, Song Zhenqu of the Municipal Organization Committee, Cai Yuan, director of the Finance Bureau, Bao Yulin, director of the Public Security Bureau, Wen Qun, secretary-general of the Municipal Government, Zeng Guangxiang, director of the Ping Sui Railway Bureau, Zhu Luyun, director of the Ping Han Office in Beiping, Leng Jiaji, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, and more than thirty others. The Public Security Bureau also sent a security team and a band to welcome him at the station. After Wu got off the train, he shook hands with the welcomers one by one as a courtesy and then went to the Beijing Hotel to rest and invited Zhou Xuechang and others from the Municipal Organization Committee to talk. I visited him at 11:00 AM to inquire about everything. Wu said the following: "I came to Beiping from Shenyang yesterday morning and plan to go to Chahar in a day or two to witness Chairman Liu Yifei's inauguration and to administer the oath to party members and officials in Chahar Province. I will represent the Central Committee in administering the oath. The date of the oath will be determined after I arrive in Chahar. After returning to Beiping from Chahar, I will schedule a trip to Rehe to inspect party affairs in the Northeast. I have already inspected the party departments in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other places. However, party affairs in the Northeast are slightly different from those in other places due to the special circumstances. However, the purpose and spirit are the same. The people in the Northeast are simple and honest and are stimulated by the two imperialists. I believe that the progress of party affairs will be very smooth and the future is very promising. The National Socialist Party has no overt activities in the Northeast. Vice Commander Zhang has always advocated that the whole country should be united under the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the activities of this party will certainly not be allowed. Vice Commander Zhang is scheduled to come to Beiping from Shenyang in two or three days to organize the Vice Commander's Office. He will also go to Beijing before the National Assembly. I will return to Beijing with Vice Commander Zhang before the National Assembly. As for the Police Headquarters, because the organizational law has not yet been formulated, it will be necessary for me to return to Beijing to consult before preparations can be made." (17th)</p>

<p>Mediation of Electricity Price Increase Dispute: Recently, the Nanqiao Lixiang Power Plant increased the price per lamp by 2 fen starting in February to subsidize the soaring oil prices. However, the users demanded that the lights be repaired first before they could agree to the price increase, resulting in a major conflict between the two parties. Although the county party department and others repeatedly negotiated to reduce the electricity price by 1 fen, the matter was not resolved due to the users raising the issue of installing electricity meters. They are now firmly refusing to use electricity, expressing their determination. The power plant has also stopped supplying electricity to those households who have not paid the overdue fees, causing the trend between the two parties to become increasingly serious. The county government fears that if this stalemate continues, there may be dangerous consequences in the future, so it has formulated appropriate conditions at this county government meeting and will convene both parties again tomorrow by County Magistrate Shen to persuade them.</p>

There were no wounds on the body, but the gums and fingernails were purple, indicating that he had taken poison before falling into the river. It was suspected that he had been murdered. Yang, the chief prosecutor, was informed and, considering the seriousness of the case, went to the scene again on the 18th to conduct an autopsy in order to investigate and handle the case.</p>
<p>Nine Bandits Were Executed by Firing Squad: Zhang Pengzhu, the county magistrate and director of the Clearing the Countryside Bureau of Wu County, previously reported that he had interrogated the bandits Zhu Aren, Zhi Xilin, Zhu Sanda, Zhang Qi, Gu Rongsheng, Sun Linchang, Lu Zhongfu, Zhang Dai, and Xiao Yang Ruichang, and they had all confessed to the facts of their crimes. He immediately proposed the death penalty and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. Chairman Zhang was informed and dispatched police to bring the nine bandits Zhu Aren and others to the scene at 9:00 AM on the 18th.

<p>Road Construction Workers Repeatedly Cause Trouble: Since the Zhenhu Long-Distance Changtai section started construction on the 6th of this month, there have been frequent reports of road construction workers causing trouble on various pretexts. On the 14th, workers in Guli Village, First District, incited by others, smashed the shops and residence of Zhen Leader Xi Ke. Fortunately, Xi escaped from the roof and was not beaten. After the Zhen Leader reported to the District Office, which forwarded the report to the County Government, on the 16th, Jin Minjun, a section chief from the County Government, along with Chen Qiwei, the head of the Construction Bureau, and an assistant from the First District, went to the countryside to investigate and earnestly persuade the workers. However, after Jin and his team arrived in the countryside, they received another report stating that Yang Yuqian, the head of Hujing Township, had gathered four or five hundred workers at his home, claiming they wanted to tear down the Yang family's house. After asking someone to mediate, Yang gave six jugs of white wine as compensation to the workers, and the matter was settled. Similarly, at the home of Xu Zhisun, the head of Dalu Town, three or four hundred workers gathered, claiming they wanted to eat meat and drink wine, or else they would tear down the house. At that time, Section Chief Jin and Bureau Chief Chen went to persuade them, but without effect. Later, Qu Liangshi (the owner of the Tieqin Tongjian Lou library) was invited to stop them, and the matter was finally resolved.</p>
<p>Bandit Leader Zheng Yushan Arrested and Sent to the County: Zheng Yushan, a native of another province, had been operating in Wangshi Town, Fushan District, in this county, as a pier boss. Two years ago, he was arrested by the county on suspicion of being a bandit. He was subsequently released on bail by merchants. In reality, Zheng was a notorious pirate leader, specializing in directing secret operations in the interior. Incidents such as the kidnapping of Zhang Chengqi and Zhang Baoqi, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Xiyang Town, and the robbery of the Xu Zhang family in Tangfangqiao, were all committed by Zheng Yushan's gang. After Zheng Yushan was released, he went into hiding in Shanghai, making it difficult to arrest him. Previously, due to internal strife within the bandit gang, a captured bandit confessed to Zheng Yushan's residence in Shanghai. Zhu Shunqing, the head of the county's investigation team, telegraphed Xu Fengshan, an investigator stationed in Shanghai, to secretly investigate. In early this month, Investigator Xu, together with Li Huchen, the captain of the Wusong Jiangsu Customs Anti-Smuggling Brigade, arrested the bandit Zheng on the 17th and brought him back to Changshu for trial by the County Judiciary.</p>

<p>Forgery of Documents for Extortion Exposed: Dong Shenyuan, a resident of Gaozi Township, was approached a few days ago by two people who claimed that someone named Fang had an important matter to discuss with him at the Deyue Lou in Longjiang Lane. Shen went to the Deyue Lou to meet Fang, but they did not know each other. When Shen asked why, Fang said that someone had reported him to the Security Bureau for communicating with bandits, and that a secret organization was located at No. 20 Xiaojie. Fang said that he had inquired at the Security Bureau and confirmed that this was the case. Fang claimed to know Long Section Chief, Secretary Xie, and Wen Section Chief at the Security Bureau, and that they knew about this matter and that an arrest warrant would soon be issued. Shen asked who had reported him. Fang said it was Dai from the County Party Department. Fang said that he had asked Wen, Long, and Xie to delay the case, and that a response would be received tomorrow (referring to yesterday). Shen asked where to get the response tomorrow. Fang said he would still be at the Deyue Lou at noon. Yesterday afternoon, at about 1:00 PM, Shen went to the Deyue Lou and saw Fang come with a person who introduced himself as Wen Section Chief from the Security Bureau. He confirmed that Dai had indeed reported Shen, but that Wen Section Chief could find a way to resolve the matter, but it would cost 1,000 yuan. Shen asked who the plaintiff was and how the report was made, asking Wen Section Chief to explain the details so that he could understand the truth. Fang then took out a piece of paper from his pocket with the words "Zhenjiang County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee" on it. The salutation was addressed to Li Mingyang, the head of the Security Bureau. The letter stated that Shen was communicating with bandits in the countryside and asked Li to arrest him immediately. After reading the letter, Shen hid it in his pocket and refused to return it. He then announced the gist of the letter to the crowd in the Deyue Lou, causing a commotion. Fang and Wen realized that Shen had seen through their scheme and immediately ran downstairs. Shen chased after them to the end of Jiajia Lane, but Fang had already disappeared. Only Wen was caught and taken to the Qijingling Seventh Precinct Police Station. This morning, the Seventh Precinct Police Station transferred him to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Guards Flee with Weapons: Tao Hongbang and two other members of the defense corps of Zoujiaqiao, Zhentao District, Rugao County, fled on the night of the 13th with two box guns and extorted 200 yuan from the Dong family in Zhangjiaqiao, Motou. This was discovered by local villagers, who flew to the Dashijiazhuang defense corps and the public security station to report it. The team leader, Zhao Chengxiang, upon hearing the news, led his team to the area north of Dashijiazhuang Zhangjia Village, where they saw three people walking towards them in a panic. Zhao ordered them to stop for inspection. The three, seeing the situation was not good, opened fire. Zhao also ordered his team to return fire, immediately knocking one person down. The other two managed to escape. It is said that the deceased was Shao [blank]qiao, a member of the corps named Tao Hongbang who fled with weapons.

<p>A Suspicious Wife-Killing Case: Shao Atu, a resident of the Ding family's house on Shaoxiang Street in Xitang, was a temple worker at the Sacred Church. On the night of the 4th, at about 10:00 PM, he returned home and, finding that his wife, Ding, was not in the house, went out to look for her. At the entrance of Jiangjia Lane, he found Ding leaning against the wall, barely breathing. She died shortly after being moved. Atu reported this to his fellow villager and police officer Shen Shenqing, who carried the body back. However, the landlord refused to allow the body to be kept in the house, so he hired a boat to transport the body to Dingzha Township, where he notified the deceased's relatives to come and prepare the body for burial. Recently, it has been rumored among the townspeople that the deceased had often quarreled with Chen Sanguan's wife, who was Atu's lover, due to jealousy, and that Atu strangled the deceased with his hands. The town's public security bureau, upon hearing this, summoned Shao Agui and others to the case for investigation. According to Zhang Xu, the deceased was chatting with her in her shop at about 9:00 PM that night before leaving and showed no signs of illness. Ding Songqing, a relative of the deceased, said that Ding's abdomen was swollen when she was prepared for burial and that there were no signs of injury. Shao Atu's testimony was evasive. Therefore, Director Yu, considering that the case involved human life, sent Shao Atu to the County Court on the 16th for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Academic Delegation to France Faces Minor Delays <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>褚民谊 Sends Letter Explaining That the Trip Can Proceed on the 25th of This Month: There have been conflicting rumors regarding the academic delegation to France. Some say that the French members are not following the instructions of the delegation leader, Chu Minyi, and that three crawler vehicles were damaged in an accident, making it impossible to proceed. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency went to the Chinese-French National Institute of Technology to inquire about this matter and learned that Mr. Chu Minyi sent a letter to Mr. Nong Yaomin of the school, describing the situation in detail. The letter stated that the seven crawler vehicles were imported from Tianjin and that it took ten hours to travel from Tianjin to Beiping, and that it took two days to travel less than a hundred li from Beiping to Changping County, which shows how delayed the trip was. However, this was because the roads around Beiping were too bad and there were too many loose rocks. These vehicles are more suitable for traveling in deserts and on land. The report in the Ping Bao that the vehicles fell into the river is completely false. The vehicles weigh seven tons, so they cannot travel quickly. The rubber bands on the front and rear wheels are specially made and extremely strong, but unfortunately, these rubber bands were not properly packaged when they were shipped from France to Tianjin, so they were exposed to the heat and humidity of the tropics and the Mediterranean Sea, which caused them to lose their elasticity and the rubber tires were damaged. Thus, extremely strong materials became fragile and were damaged by small stones when traveling through Changping County, making it impossible to proceed. The vehicles are currently parked 15 li outside of Changping County, and French workers are repairing them. The French representative, Bu An, has telegraphed the Citroen repair factory in Paris to send new rubber bands via the Siberian Railway to Beiping. It is estimated that these rubber bands will arrive in two weeks and that the trip can proceed on the 25th of this month. As for the report that the French were acting independently and that our side sent personnel to the French Embassy to question them, these are all false. The crawler vehicles did not display national flags because they were not prepared in time. This matter was explained by Yu (Chu Minyi referring to himself) to the French representative, Bu An, in Shanghai. Yu said that he would have many national flags made in Shanghai and bring them to Beiping for the delegation to display. Therefore, the French side did not prepare them. The speculations circulating outside are confused and cannot be believed. In short, developing the Northwest is an urgent task, and it is necessary to start with transportation. Yu is therefore determined to move forward despite the dangers and will definitely travel to Xinjiang to conduct on-the-spot inspections to plan for the development of transportation in the Northwest and to seek the development of Chinese industry.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has issued an order urging elementary school teachers who passed the first certification last year to quickly obtain their licenses. It has been found that many elementary school teachers who passed the first certification last year have not yet obtained their licenses. It has been almost a year now, but no one has obtained a license, which is not in accordance with the regulations. The current certification examination is about to be held, and further delays will not be allowed. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is being issued again to urge the bureau chiefs to instruct all elementary school teachers to quickly follow the statutory procedures to come to the department to obtain their licenses so that the matter can be concluded. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Department of Education has issued an order to the education bureaus of various counties to investigate the temporary standards for the validity period of certified elementary school teachers in Jiangsu Province previously promulgated by the department. Articles 3 and 4 stipulate the conditions for extension in order to be cautious about teacher qualifications. However, since the implementation of these standards, elementary school teachers in various counties who are truly excellent in teaching and have outstanding achievements are often unable to obtain the qualifications because the provincial supervisors have not conducted thorough inspections, resulting in the regrettable loss of talent. In order to remedy the aforementioned shortcomings, paragraphs C of Articles 3 and 4 of the original standards are hereby amended. Paragraph C of Article 3: Has been inspected by provincial supervisors or provincial experimental elementary school local education instructors and county supervisors education committee members. Paragraph C of Article 4: Has been inspected by provincial supervisors or provincial experimental elementary school local education instructors and county supervisors education committee members and has received two or more excellent evaluations. The order is being issued to notify the education bureaus of the changes.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Grand Opening Ceremony <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The second annual meeting of the National Society for Children's Education opened at the Shanghai Municipal Council North District Elementary School at 9:00 AM yesterday. More than 250 members of the society attended. Xu Peihuang, the director of the City Education Bureau, Yang Weiyu of the National Vocational Education Society, educators Zheng Xiaocang, Liu Tingfang, Shang Zhongyi, and others were present. Dong Renjian presided over the ceremony according to etiquette. The chairman reported that today is the opening of the second annual meeting of the society. This meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Suzhou, but it was changed to Shanghai due to the convenience of transportation. The history of the society is very short. In 1926, a small number of comrades were interested in early childhood education and organized the Kindergarten Education Research Association in Nanjing. Later, because the meaning was too narrow and the scope was too small, it was changed to the Children's Education Society. In 1929, the inaugural meeting was held in Hangzhou. Last July, the first annual meeting was held in Wuxi. Now, the second annual meeting is being held. The number of members has gradually increased, with 25 group members and 500 individual members. In terms of funding, in addition to the membership fees paid by the members, the Ministry of Education also provided a subsidy of 100 yuan this year. As for the career, the Children's Education Monthly is published every month, and there are plans to publish an annual report. Due to time constraints, the society cannot have a large performance in society, and it cannot keep up with the educational groups of various countries in the world. It is hoped that it will be able to publish series of publications in the future and make efforts in experimental education for children, and that experts will provide guidance and various institutions will assist in cooperation, so that careers can be developed. In addition to inviting educational experts to give lectures, there will also be achievement exhibitions, performances, and receptions from various agencies. It is hoped that all members attending the meeting will participate. Then, Xu Peihuang, director of the City Education Bureau, gave a speech, saying that he was very honored to be able to participate in the annual meeting of the Children's Education Society. Those of you who come from various provinces to discuss children's education issues will surely have remarkable achievements in the future. Shanghai is a major trading port with the attention of both Chinese and foreigners, and educational career is very important. The results of your discussions will surely give us a lot of reference. Your society has only been established for two or three years, and its achievements are already so great, and the future is immeasurable. I would like to congratulate you all first and hope that you will work hard in the psychological construction of the Premier to train children to have good personalities. The Party and the country are very fortunate. Then, Chen Heqin, representing the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Education Committee of the Public Concession, extended a welcome to the members attending the meeting on behalf of the Education Office of the Chinese University. Then, Yang Weiyu, representing the National Vocational Education Society, gave a speech, saying that the two American educators, Dr. Dewey and Dr. Monroe, came to China to visit and criticized China's primary education as being no less than that of Europe and the United States. Japanese educators also came to China to visit and had the same thoughts. This is enough to show the progress of Chinese children's education. However, those who do not understand education often say that we only know how to copy and adapt the laws of the East and the West. We do not think this is right, but we will definitely merge Chinese and foreign education into one furnace and then create an education method that is suitable for the new China. Then, the psychologist Liu Tingfang gave a speech, saying that in the past, China only knew how to imitate the education methods of Japan, the United States, and other countries and had no creative spirit, so there was no progress from father to son. In the future, we should create Chinese education. Then, Zheng Xiaocang gave a speech, saying that according to recent research on the meaning and trends of children by Thorndike, the learning of adults is the same as that of children, but in terms of children's education, it can be extended from the age of six in elementary school to kindergarten and infancy, so the meaning and scope of children is greater than that recognized by ordinary people. At the same time, the issue of children's education has been recognized by educators in various countries, but we should not only pay attention to children's education, but also pay attention to the education of children's parents, so that parents can understand how to protect and educate children. Therefore, children's education should not only educate children, but also extend to children's parents. Also, we should pay attention to practice when studying educational fruits, but theory is also very important, so it is hoped that the society will not only study from the practical aspects in the future, but also take into account the theoretical aspects. Finally, the chairman gave a thank-you speech and invited Ms. MandRrenleci, an American educator, to give a speech. After the speech, the members had lunch at the Jiande Savings Society. The meeting opened at 1:30 PM. First, Huang Yi gave a speech on several methods of recent research on children's thinking. The teacher of the French Elementary School of the French Concession spoke on the teaching methods of kindergartens and elementary schools, and his secretary, Shen Zhonghe, represented him at the meeting to speak.</p>

<p>School Affairs Meeting to Be Held at 3:00 PM This Afternoon</p>
<p>Jinan University has become famous in recent years, and the number of overseas Chinese students returning to China has increased sharply. The Zhenru campus is really not enough to accommodate them. It is expected that even more students will return to China this summer, so the university has applied to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force for permission to return the Jinan campus in Xuejia Lane, Beijing, so that it can be used exclusively for junior high schools. The university has received an instruction from the Commander-in-Chief: "I have received your report. I will order Yang Jie, the commander of the Ningzhencheng Song Four Roads, to investigate and order the relocation." The university sent another letter to Commander Yang yesterday to expedite the investigation and order the relocation, and appointed Zhang Jialu as the receiving committee member. Starting from the 20th academic year, the junior high school department will be moved to the Beijing campus for training and divided into departments in Shanghai. The Department of Law on Laoshenfu Road will still be moved back to Zhenru.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the 17 members of the Lushan Collection Group of the Department of Biology of the university, led by Dr. Gao Chongkui and Dr. Su Rugan, have been busy with collection work in the mountains in recent days, and the results are no less than those of Tiantai Mountain last year.

<h3 id="e107">Opening of Shanghai's First Long-Distance Race <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>| 10:00 AM This Morning | Starting Next to the Chen Ying Shiles Memorial Tower in Ximen | -</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau's first long-distance race, which stirred the entire city, opened at 10:00 AM this morning. The courage and eagerness to be first of the racers lined up in a row, and the excitement and cheers of the audience were as expected. The following is a brief account of the situation:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: The venue is located under the Chen Ying Shiles Memorial Tower, surrounded by bamboo fences and decorated with colored decorations. A couplet is prominently displayed, reading: "Brave and strong children strive to be the first, circling the city twice, washing away the shame of the sick man of East Asia. Magnificent scholars promote and guide with one heart, Shanghai sets an example to promote the spirit of the Chinese nation."</p>
<p>Awarding Location: Many people from all walks of life have enthusiastically sponsored and donated prizes for this conference. The organizing committee has designated the awarding ceremony to be held at the Fanguangqiao Republican Cinema, taking into account its proximity to the memorial tower and its factual convenience.</p>
<p>Important People Attending: In addition to Chairman Zhang (Mayor) and his wife, representatives from the City Party Department, directors of various bureaus, and representatives from various groups and institutions must attend the opening ceremony and the award ceremony. It is now recognized that promoting sports is the most important thing to do.</p>
<p>Route: The route of the race will follow the three-road circle, circling twice, which has been announced earlier. It is reported that the direction of the route is from the memorial tower in the south, passing through Laoximen, Shangwenmen, Dananmen, Xiaonanmen, Dadongmen, Xiaodongmen, Xinbeimen, Laobeimen, Xiaobeimen, and then back to the memorial tower, and then repeating the circuit.</p>
<p>Maintaining Order: In addition to the police from the Public Security Bureau being dispatched to isolate vehicles from driving through the various places, the Boy Scouts of the East Asian Sports Academy are also invited to maintain order. The position of the patrol chief is held by Qu Yue, a teacher at the school.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Referees: Many of the referees for this competition are well-known figures in the Shanghai sports community. It is heard that they have agreed to arrive at the venue before 9:00 AM today to prepare everything.</p>
<p>Eager Racers: The conference is to promote the idea of a general increase in physical fitness, so it has set the number of winners at 15. Those who can complete the race in one hour outside of the top 15 will also be given souvenirs, so 256 people have signed up to join in a short period of time, and it is expected that they will arrive on time and strive to be the first.</p>

<h3 id="e111">This Year's Annual Marathon Race <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Tentatively Scheduled for May 24th</p>
<p>Requesting Sponsorship from All Parties Regarding Funding Issues</p>
<p>Whether this year's annual marathon long-distance race should continue to be held has attracted general attention. The Shanghai Westerners' Amateur Sports Association therefore convened a special meeting to discuss this matter. It was resolved that if sufficient financial assistance can be obtained from all parties and competitors actively participate, then this year's annual marathon long-distance race will continue to be held, tentatively scheduled for May 24th. The meeting will reconvene next Friday to formally decide whether or not to hold it. The meeting proceedings are briefly described below:</p>
<p>All Parties Actively Preparing. A total of eight people attended the meeting. The Amateur Association President, Mr. Blackridge, chaired the meeting and stated that there were many requests to continue holding the annual marathon race. However, economic factors, the venue, and the presence of participants were all prerequisites. The French garrison representative stated that their army could contribute ten people. The Schouder army also had four or six participants. The Russian team had about eight people. Lei Midiqi stated that the Chinese team was also actively preparing and could have about fifteen participants. The Chinese team conducted a long-distance race from Shanghai to Suzhou the day before yesterday as practice.</p>
<p>Economics are a Major Problem. Since there is no concern about enthusiastic participation in the competition, the next issue is economics. The various expenses for the competition require approximately 250 yuan, plus 500 yuan for prizes. There is no source for these 800 yuan in funding. Therefore, it was unanimously resolved to proceed with fundraising.</p>
<p>Next Meeting to Decide. The next meeting is scheduled for Friday. All parties will separately collect the results of their fundraising efforts. If economic problems do not arise, then a decision will be made to borrow a venue and solicit participants.</p>

<p>Pole Vault: Cao Yu (Jiangnan) - 3.01 meters</p>
<p>High Jump was not held due to wind and blowing sand. The 400-meter low hurdles were not held because only Tao Yingjie participated. Zhong Lianji was absent due to illness, and He Debao withdrew midway through the ball game. Gu Zaiping came second in both the 100 meters and 400 meters. The long-distance runners did not compete because of the long-distance run tomorrow. The wind was strong, and the results were poor. Tang Guangchuan, who won first place in the 5000 meters, is a junior high school student and has excellent running form. Wang Jihai's dog often picked up the javelin after it landed and brought it back, going back and forth dozens of times, making it the highlight of the entire field. Due to many absences, the meeting could not be held and will be resolved next week when competing against McLeish. The Guanghua athletes will be absent from the school sports meet next Monday, so the first place results were recorded.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Remembering Mr. Yuan Hanyun <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yuanliang</p>
<p>Mr. Hanyun was the second son of former President Yuan Weiting. He was known as a talented scholar of his time. He passed away at noon on the 22nd of last month at his residence at No. 4 Liangyi Alley, Tianjin, at the age of only 42. Literary friends in Shanghai were saddened by the news. Today, we are holding a memorial meeting for him. Mr. Hanyun was born with intelligence and could memorize anything he saw. He was particularly skilled in poetry and prose. His father doted on him, and all official documents were drafted and transcribed by him. His calligraphy was elegant, and those who obtained it cherished it as a treasure. His poetic talent was overflowing, reaching the level of Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin. He also painted and once drew a Kunqu opera script. From a young age, he was fond of Kunqu opera and Peking opera. He often invited Da Bao to talk about plays, and Xu Ling taught him “Touring the Garden, Startling the Dream” and "Qin Tiao." Comic plays such as “Examining the Head, Stabbing the Soup,” and “Small Banquet, Disturbing Studies” were often performed, and he was very popular. In the winter of the sixteenth year, at the invitation of the China Road Association, he borrowed the Shanghai Gongwu Stage to perform “Examining the Head” with Ouyang Yuqian and the Tiangang attendants. I personally saw him put on makeup and act as Tang Biaobei, a hunchbacked yamen servant in the play. His humorous performance made people laugh. In addition to acting in plays, he also spent much of his time with female performers. Whenever beautiful women surrounded him and music filled the air, he would be inspired and reciprocate with gifts. There are many anecdotes about him. Kunqu opera singer Wang Biyun was once appreciated by Mr. Yuan. Mr. Yuan knew she could write and asked her to inscribe on a Ming Dynasty palace woman's rouge box and gifted it to her. The box was less than an inch high and less than two inches in diameter. It was carved with countless pavilions, flowers, and birds, with as many as seven layers of carvings. However, when viewed, it looked like a flat mirror, perfect for storing rouge. What he exchanged was only a few words, but he may have regarded it as precious because it came from the hand of a beautiful woman. People in the brothels thought he was noble and talented and enjoyed being close to him. When he found someone he loved, he would bring her home with a generous dowry. It is said that he had as many concubines as there were hairpins, but after a long time, his love faded, and they would separate. In the end, only a few remained. He had experienced the bitterness and joy of life. Usually, his descriptions of literature about flowers were vivid, truly worthy of the "dripping powder, kneading cream, blowing fragrance, and chewing nectar." For example, the couplet he gave to Chu Xia said, "I was already interested when I first met you, let alone moved the wine closer to my eyebrows and held your hand when climbing the building. Xia Qi became a dress but I still hated that it was colored, wishing to cut clouds into slippers and tread the moon as a plate." It was very similar to the concept of a beautiful pearl. In addition to loving poetry, books, lyrics, and music, Mr. Yuan also liked collecting antiques. He wrote "Collection of World Coins," a two-volume book full of rubbings of currencies from past dynasties, with detailed annotations, making it a grand view. In the past, I received a draft of "Zhuchen Ji" from a friend, which was like an antique catalog. He classified it with an example and prefaced it, saying, "When I was young, I understood the love of ancient books and strange paintings, and I lingered and couldn't leave. When I grew up, I bought them a little. Occasionally, I would show them to connoisseurs and study them carefully. The things I have obtained over the years have increased to more than a hundred. I am afraid that they will be forgotten and scattered over time, and I am worried that there is no way to tell future generations. So I will narrate the categories of what I have collected." Mr. Yuan was uninhibited and did not adhere to trivial matters. He was addicted to opium and often painted while smoking day and night. If a friend visited, he could meet even if he was sharing a pillow with a concubine. He was so open-minded. Later, he quit his addiction and returned to Tianjin in the autumn of the seventeenth year. He never touched opium again after quitting, and his weight increased. We hoped that he would make good use of his talent and often offer pearls to the literary world. Who knew that this farewell would be a farewell forever? Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e116">Elegy for Hanyun <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Nantian</p>
<p>Gained a wild reputation like Du Sijiun, after all, Yuan Si was also outstanding. Ten thousand deaths in the rivers and lakes, with twin green temples (In the year of Jiazi, Hanyun returned north and sent a poem saying, "Ten thousand deaths in the rivers and lakes, I will come and go.") A lifetime of career with several red skirts. Willing to use sorrow and joy to dispel silk and bamboo, exhausting the quality of Qinshu to buy drunk. Such talent, such a passing, only Lord Xinling in the nine springs.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Future of Humanity in My Ideal <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Dunjin</p>
<p>In ancient times, people were very tall and lived very long lives. Fangfengshi was nine acres wide, and Pengzu lived to be 800 years old. Later, they gradually shortened. Now, people are getting shorter and shorter. Living to 60 or 70 years old is considered old. This still refers to our predecessors. I don't know what will happen in the future. According to my ideal speculation, people will slowly become dogs, sheep, cats, and mice. Then, the size will reach the extreme and will be no different from insects. The ephemeral may be the embodiment of the old saying "the sky is turned upside down." (Not paid)</p>
<h3 id="e118">A Small Cigarette Factory in Beiping <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>Near the front gate of Beiping, there is a small cigarette factory located at the entrance of a shop. The shop displays a variety of cigarettes and has a hand-cranked cigarette rolling machine used for manufacturing cigarettes. The factory owner, Mr. Liu, is both the owner and the worker. He also hires several children who specialize in picking up cigarette butts on the roads everywhere to supply the raw materials for the factory. Because the tobacco used in this small cigarette is not fresh tobacco, but rather collected cigarette butts that have been re-rolled. Every day, Mr. Liu orders the children to pick up the cigarette butts that have been abandoned by people everywhere and pays a very cheap price. He also sorts the collected cigarette butts to prepare for manufacturing. The butt cigarettes (new term) sold in this factory also have various brands, and the prices are not uniform. For example, if you want a "Galiaoke" or a "Platinum Dragon," you can ask him. He will put the cigarette butts of the same brand that you choose into the cigarette rolling machine and roll them for you. In a moment, the cigarette is rolled. After paying the price (about two copper coins at most), you can smoke it. Mr. Liu's cigarette factory has been open for several years and has always had good business, earning a lot of money. Mr. Liu himself started out as a cigarette butt picker, so he has a lot of research on this way.</p>
<p>It is common to see cigarette butt pickers in large cities with a cloth bag and bamboo tongs patrolling the streets. They collect a lot and sell them to small cigarette companies for manufacturing ordinary cigarettes to sell as new cigarettes. Mr. Liu's plan is even more appropriate, selling them at low prices by category. This is his ingenuity, and it is no wonder that he is making a small fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Farewell Notes from Da Fengtang <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Yucen</p>
<p>This time, the Sino-Japanese Exhibition exhibited many products from collectors and artists in Shanghai, and there was also a visiting group to promote national art. The relationship is sincere and great. At the same time, Zhang Shanzi and Daqian, the owners of Da Fengtang, also took their families to Japan on the 18th by boat. Shanzi has recently been busy with painting affairs and has been suffering from guiding students. He goes to bed late every night and feels that his tongue is dry. The doctor advised him to rest. Therefore, going to Japan will be mainly for rest and travel. The mountains and rivers of Fusang will relieve fatigue and medicine. It is estimated that he will stay for two months. At the Sino-Japanese Exhibition, he is indeed an exhibitor of new and old paintings, but he does not intend to join the group to socialize. The packed paintings include landscapes by Zhao Songxue and Tang Liuru, flowers and figures by Shitao, and several recent works by the two gentlemen. They can be called a thousand-foot sword. Da Fengtang's collections and works have a great reputation at home and abroad, and are far-reaching in Chicken Forest. It is unnecessary to wait until today. In the second month of Jiangnan, the spring water is green. It is expected that the two floating beards will cross with the sea sail. It is no different from the boat. Li Guo hopes like a fairy.

<h3 id="e120">The Vigor of the Advertising Industry <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been an excellent phenomenon in my country regarding the great development of industry and commerce, that is, the sudden vigor of the advertising industry. The majority of well-known business companies also know to shift their eyes to the publicity of text and art, and hire experts at high salaries to take charge of their affairs, and are even willing to sacrifice huge amounts of money to allocate as regular expenses. Advertising companies that specialize in serving industry and commerce have also sprung up like mushrooms after rain. We only need to observe the progress of the news industry in recent years to associate this with advertising, which is closely related to the news and has helped it.</p>
<p>I have been engaged in advertising research as far back as eight or nine years ago, only because few people in the business world at that time could pay attention to this way. In fact, the majority of business companies did not have considerable faith in the effectiveness of advertising promotion. Therefore, I shifted my efforts to writing and engaged in the news industry. However, my interest in advertising research has never diminished. Last year, I responded to the invitation of a large company here and returned to Shanghai to specialize in advertising. With more contact, my interest in advertising research has become stronger, and my friends such as Xu Zhuodai and Ni Gulian have also abandoned their writing careers and engaged in advertising writing. Yesterday, Mr. Kuang Xiaoan invited me to drink. After drinking, Mr. Kuang asked me about my recent situation, so I wrote a couplet to ridicule myself: "The iron inkstone has been worn through, and there is still some love left for advertising; the silver pen has been written bald, and there is no more mood for writing." Although the sentence is funny, it is also a little bit of emotion.</p>
<p>Recently, new advertising initiatives include rickshaw advertising, utility pole advertising, and traffic advertising companies that exclusively package train advertising on both routes. The Meilingden Company contracts the body advertising of trolleybuses. Competing for novelty and victory can attract general attention. For example, the Xianling Company uses the power of radio broadcasting to give speeches and report advertisements. Within a minute, the effectiveness of the advertisement can be broadcast to the whole country, which is also amazing.</p>
<p>As for newspaper advertising, it has also progressed compared to before. Not only is attention paid to text, but also to the study of art. Judging by the exquisite advertisements in pictorials, it can be seen. It is expected that ten years later, newspapers will rely on the help of advertising to sell more widely, and advertising will rely on the power of newspapers to achieve greater results. Although the price of advertising sacrifices will be greater, the number of households reached will be greater. According to my personal speculation, after ten years, the advertisement rate for each inch of newspaper will be calculated at three yuan, which is an inevitable fact.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Travels in India (29) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xiangcheng from Yunnan and Jamyang, a Tibetan, came to visit. The Tibetan wore a red mandarin jacket and had cut his hair. I could not understand his language, so Mr. Zhang translated for him. He is in the Tibetan Department of the Asiatic Society here. This society has people from all Asian countries, including Chinese, and there were Russians, but not now. It is a genuine academic organization that is set up for archaeological research and the culture of various Asian countries. It was originally a social organization, but now it has obtained assistance from the British government and is of a semi-official nature. However, its purpose is academic. I heard that the chairman is Dutch. These kinds of things must be started and organized by gentlemen, and the effect will be long-lasting. There is the Geographical Society in Beijing, China, run by my old friend Zhang Xiangwen, which still exists today. I previously met a Swede in the north who specialized in researching northern Chinese animals and collected many kinds of small snakes, even several boxes, sent by their society. Sweden is a small country, but they have come to China to collect small snakes. China is a big country, but they do not know how to unite to study their homeland's cultural relics. It is truly shameful. Rituals are lost and sought in the wild, and learning is in the four barbarians. This is true.</p>
<p>On the 14th, I talked with an Indian friend about something that surprised me. Professor Mala Tai pointed to a passerby and said to me, "This kind of person eats beef. Think about it, the cow plows the field for me and provides milk for my whole family, young and old. Its merit is no different from my wet nurse. I have already eaten its strength and eaten its milk, how can I bear to kill and eat its meat? These people can eat beef, they have no conscience." I asked how many vegetarians there are in all of India. Bimalananda Bramchari replied that there are many meat-eaters in Calcutta because Westerners eat meat and there are many Muslims. If you remove these provinces, most of the Indian Hindus in other provinces do not eat living things throughout India. I think Hinduism is so noble and loves even insects and ants. Zhuangzi said that all things are one with me. Its asceticism is greater than Buddhism. Indians can be the world's masters, noble Indians. I now understand why Indians are inconvenienced to open restaurants because people of different religions cannot eat together and have many taboos.</p>
<p>The Indian view of life takes the highest virtue as the standard, so they despise physical happiness and believe in fatalism. Wealth, poverty, longevity, and heaven are all destined, and there is no divorce in marriage. A wife never remarries after her husband dies, but a husband can remarry after his wife dies. Although new trends have risen, divorce is difficult to implement in India.</p>
<p>I see that Indian paintings contain divine meaning everywhere, especially women. They have a kind of ethereal and distant spirit. They have the true, the good, and the beautiful. Many paintings depict husbands as monks rejecting women or cultivating the Tao and staying away from women. This is the Indian view of life.</p>
<p>The police are like the Indian police in Shanghai, China, with red turbans and long poles, very quiet. I see people standing and watching a paper card, and they do not ask. The house number system is very bad, the characters are small, and it is very inconvenient to visit friends. The strangest thing is that the numbers go from 1 to 50 on the right street, and then return to the right street from 51 to 100. It is very bad. The house number system in Shanghai is very good, and Nanjing is the most effective. The British and American systems are not good.</p>
<p>The government interferes with printing quite strictly. If I print a speech, even if it is only a few pages, the name of the printing house must be printed on it before it can be published. However, the meetings and speeches of various circles are still free.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Gold Prices Finally Decline <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Decrease… Eight Taels Four Qian</p>
<p>The Atmosphere is Extremely Anxious. Yesterday, the 18th, the gold price fluctuated slightly. It was weak in the morning, then stabilized, and finally weakened again, falling by more than eight taels. The state was confusing and difficult to grasp. There were five or six taels of trading in between, and people were anxious and at a loss. The main reason was that each firm was buying and selling. The price of silver on the international market fell very little, causing the gold price to open lower. Moreover, there were more sellers than buyers. Later, after breaking 710 taels, large households took the opportunity to step in and re-energize the price, rising by six or seven taels. Before the exchange rate was even listed, the transaction price was already loose. By noon, the selling pressure suddenly intensified, and the price was difficult to support, falling with the current. After failing again by seven taels, the market closed as usual on Saturday. It is expected that the main contract will have to rebound this morning. During this week, it happened to be the rollover period, and the June contract, from Thursday to today, had a maximum price of 724 taels and a minimum price of 703 taels. There was also a difference of 21 taels in just three days. Comparing the total with the first opening price, it fell by thirteen or fourteen taels.</p>
<p>Frequent Changes Discovered. Yesterday morning's opening price was 711 taels and five qian, a decrease of three taels and four qian. The main contract only fell by one-sixteenth recently. The distant contract and the price of silver were not affected. There was no change in the European market, and the United States was also waiting to see. Moreover, the private telegrams rose by one-sixteenth. Therefore, people's hearts were down. Zhifeng Yonghongli, Wupin, and others were the first to sell. In just over ten minutes, it suddenly fell to 05 taels and five qian. Soon after, Shunli, Qianchangxiang, Wanxingyu, Da, and others all bought. Moreover, Holland absorbed 136,875 June gold, which was sold by Mitsui, Sumitomo, and others. Therefore, it returned to two taels, totaling 08 taels and one qian.

Later, HSBC and others absorbed 6875 July gold, and the price was pulled up by three or four taels. After ten thirty, it had broken out of 710 taels. Yuan Mao Yong, Qianchangxiang, Shunli, Wanxing, Bingxingchang, Yuyong, and others made progress. At eleven o'clock, it was 12 taels and six qian.

For a moment, buyers were still diligent, and at eleven thirty, it was 13 taels. Later, the exchange rate was loose and not good. Especially, Yongheng, Yuanxingyong, Yuyuda, Yuanheng, and others tended to sell.

<p>The yarn market was very weak and trending downwards. This was because the overseas cotton yarn situation remained weak and lackluster, and the surrounding environment was deteriorating. Retailers uniformly tended to sell off, so the situation was quite loose. Most needed to see 60 taels before importing. However, in reality, there was a lack of upward momentum, but a large drop was also unlikely. As for spot sales, although there was no significant improvement in volume, there were still some small transactions among various groups, and the sales of fine yarn were smooth, with market prices tight. However, the business of 10-count coarse yarn was very sluggish, so sellers had more support and a stronger outlook. It is feared that prices will remain difficult to rise in the near future.</p>
<p>Man-made cotton fell by one or two taels. The opening of the foreign cotton market was weak due to poor US cotton prices, and market sentiment was weak. Weavers each fell 346 candareens. In the afternoon, news of poor gold prices further weakened the situation, each falling 68 candareens to 1 tael and 3 candareens. Total transactions for the day were 18,050 bales. Yu Kang sold 1,250 bales, He Shen 950 bales, Shen Ji 600 bales, Chang Feng 750 bales, and Xin Cheng 1,050 bales. Da Fu bought 800 bales, Gong Tai 700 bales, Rong Xing 1,150 bales, and Yi Chang 1,100 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>June 1643 1.472`800 September 1616 1715`750</p>
<p>Yarn sales are still good. Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that various groups bought a total of 1,500 bales for the whole day. 800 bales were bought by the same trade, and the market was slightly weak. 225 bales were bought by out-of-town groups in the mainland, 665 bales in Guangdong, 275 bales in Sichuan, 100 bales in Shantou, 125 bales in Gaoyou, 75 bales in Nanyang, and 100 bales in miscellaneous areas.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Cotton Market in Decline <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was very weak and the decline was intensifying. Although the US cotton situation was weak and the decline had stopped, bulls expected 1 jiao before importing. Spot cotton transactions were sluggish, so there were more sellers and the market quickly broke the 40-tael mark. In the afternoon, the situation was even worse as gold prices fell again, but Japanese merchants remained in a bullish position.</p>
<p>Han-made cotton plummeted by five or six candareens. The opening of the Han-made cotton market was flat and the decline was not intense. Each month fell by 1 candareen and 5 fen. In the afternoon, hearing that gold prices were below 10 taels, people's confidence suddenly wavered and each fell by five or six candareens. Transactions totaled 40,900 dan. Geng Feng sold 2,100 dan, Shen Xin 1,400 dan, Yu Kang 1,500 dan, and De Ji 1,100 dan. Chang Ji bought 1,200 dan, Shen Chang 1,000 dan, Xie Sheng 1,100 dan, and Yuan Da 1,400 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>May 4000551197`700 August 395580199`00</p>
<p>Cotton transactions have ceased again. Spot cotton transactions are completely non-existent. As the futures market is in a sharp decline, all factories are at a loss. The source is only 90 bales of Tonghua.</p>

<p>Buyers Were Cautious Due to Rising Prices</p>
<p>The weather is suitable and planting is smooth.</p>
<p>New York, 17th, telegram report on the raw cotton market in one week. The cotton market gradually turned down last week because traders' purchases were blocked by rising prices, and the weather in the south was again suitable, causing bulls to close positions again, and planting was progressing smoothly. Securities also did not improve, and the Liverpool market was also poor. Cooperatives sold May contracts and bought further-out months. Trading was quiet, and people in the industry were waiting for more accurate news on this season's cotton fields and new cotton. There is an optimistic argument in Washington that the total amount of world cotton production this season is estimated to be 25.5 million bales, compared to 26.3 million bales last year. Based on this number, the rolling inventory of US cotton at the end of the season will be huge, and the non-thinness of other inventories is knowable. Agricultural Bureau Chairman Si Dongjun declared that cotton planters who want to hope for satisfactory cotton prices must reduce cotton fields by at least 25%.

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, not many sources arrived from various gangs, only about twenty numbers. Although sales were light, each medium Guanzhong Bai Jing rice, because of the previous few market price drops were too low, yesterday instead moved upward around a jiao. High-quality goods also slightly increased a few fen. The overall market trend presented a firm look. Bo Dao (inferior rice) was average in sales, and arrivals were also scarce, but the price of this good was particularly low, so it also followed the Jing (superior) market and was firm. Especially high-priced goods opened at eleven yuan and one jiao. Yang Xian, Du Xian, and Bu Xian prices were all stable yesterday, but transactions were average, and people's hearts were not very optimistic. Er Bai Yuan and Diao Fan (two types of rice) sales varied. Top-quality goods were active, while mediocre goods were fixed in place.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, over ten numbers arrived by river. Sales on this street were not smooth. Buyers of Bai Jing rice from Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang were extremely flat, and transactions were also scarce. The market prices of each Xing-numbered (star) stalls continued to hold at the original levels. The sales of early Bo Dao in the Southern gang were stagnant and arrivals were rare, remaining flat. Top-quality early rice hovered between ten yuan and five or six jiao. Yang, Du, and Jian remained scarce in arrivals, and out-of-town gangs inquired slightly. Prices were similar to the previous day. The sales of Bian Yin Yuan (a type of rice) were stagnant, and sources were particularly scarce. The overall market had no ups and downs.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the out-of-town Xian rice market, Guangdong gangs continued to ship, and the market remained stable. However, this street and northern gangs, etc., had river arrivals and disliked the goods were difficult to choose, so they were watching and not moving. Only Guangdong gangs were buying, so although the market shape was good, prices were difficult to rise. The overall market transaction of Jiangxi machine late rice was over 700 bags, with prices from eleven yuan and three jiao to eleven yuan and one jiao. The sales of out-of-town Yuan rice remained lively, only because the stock was low and there were no arrivals, it was difficult for buyers to choose. Yesterday, Jiangxi machine Yuan rice was also shipped by Guangdong gangs for 110 bags at prices from eleven yuan and seven jiao and a half to thirteen yuan and three jiao and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Flour Price Stays Firm <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening of the morning and afternoon markets, the market for each month generally trended toward stability. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat rose by one or two jiao, the hearts of outsiders were inevitably reactivated. Although the Tianjin gang had returns in the middle (it was heard that sales in Tianjin were fatigued and the price was lower by two and a half fen), the market trend remained very firm. This was because the factory tightened the recent pricing of foreign wheat, and the exchange rate could not be determined for a while. Therefore, although buying interest did not surge, the asking price resumed to a better step. As a result, this month was better by five mils than the previous day, May was better by seven mils and a half, June was better by five mils, July and August were better by one fen, and September was better by one fen and two mils.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Wheat Futures Market Turned Steady Afterwards <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, after the opening of the morning and afternoon markets, the market for each month presented a first flat and then firm appearance. Initially, because the floating multi-positions in the inland were successively returned, although the near term was not good, the distant term had been slightly raised due to the good news of foreign wheat. Afterwards, because the flour market was very stable, the buying interest of outsiders gradually revived. The key to this was that the price of foreign wheat could not be determined for a while, and gangs from Hankou and Qingdao, etc., if they were to draw again, still had the potential for continued shipment. Therefore, the market could not help but be stable. As a result, this month was better by two fen than the previous day, May was better by one fen, June was better by three fen, July was better by two fen, August was better by two fen, and September was better by four fen.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Quiet, Market Stable <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Car Sugar Initially Weak, then Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, a message from the production area was that the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.28125, which was a continued drop of 0.1875 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for May fell one point, September fell two points, December had no ups and downs, and March of the next year also fell one point. Java spot and futures prices still had no ups and downs. In the association market's allocation disk, although the buying interest for He sugar 24 coarse sand and white sugar was quiet, the market sentiment was still firm. The asking price for the seller was still 10 taels and 05 qian, lacking inquiries. High-quality goods with coarse granules were slightly traded at 10 taels and 06 qian. The market shape of 20 medium sand and white sugar at 9 taels and 9 qian was flat and stable. Japanese sugar was initially weak, then strengthened, and transactions were still relatively active. N mark at 10 taels 04 qian and a half, SH mark at 10 taels 00 qian 07 fen and a half, J mark at 10 taels 08 qian and a half, YT mark at 10 taels 03 qian and a half, YRO mark at 9 taels and 9 qian, YP mark at 10 taels 07 qian and a half, TM mark at 10 taels 00 qian 07 fen and a half, TK mark at 10 taels 04 qian and a half. Sellers were particularly scarce, so the market shape was quite brisk.</p>

<p>Honey jujubes, which previously had both rare arrivals and stock, have risen to thirty-one or two taels like a shorn head, but now that the weather is gradually getting hotter, there is a risk of oiling after the sugar juice melts, so the market price has fallen, dropping two or three taels from before. Yesterday, the market price of shorn heads sold for around twenty-eight taels. The stallholders still added and refunded as usual, and the sales of various gangs were average, trending weakly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk sales of local foreign shops were still difficult to improve. The exchange rate had not changed much, and the European and American markets continued to have telegrams to Shanghai, but the prices were not high, and the cost of silk was still high, making it difficult to trade. Only Taihe, etc., imported about 40 bales of Zhejiang factory; Lianna, etc., imported about 16 bales of Sichuan yellow factory; and Xiangli, etc., imported about 10 bales of white Qian factory. The prices were all firm.</p>

Yesterday, a fundraising initiative was drafted, which reads: "Respectfully, the Central Party Headquarters plans to raise funds in various provinces and cities to construct office premises for use. Shanghai should contribute 200,000 yuan, which will be the responsibility of the Shanghai business community to raise. The Central Party Headquarters is the source of national politics. At a time when the new capital is being established and the scale is just beginning, various official residences are being planned and constructed one after another. However, the Central Party Headquarters' office premises are still temporarily borrowed and do not have a fixed foundation. Building a permanent structure is necessary to show the regulations and leave a lasting legacy. Raising funds for construction is both necessary and difficult due to strained public finances. Therefore, we are undertaking a fundraising effort. The Party Headquarters has the task of leading the people, and the people's resources should be used to build a grand and lasting structure, which will demonstrate the spirit of democracy and leave a lasting legacy. We have briefly described the origin to prepare for separate fundraising efforts. We hope that you will enthusiastically contribute to this grand undertaking. We pray for your consideration."</p>

During the banquet, Director Tang gave a speech, saying that he was ordered to concurrently serve as the director of the office and felt deeply that his talent was limited and his responsibility was heavy. He hoped that the committee members and experts would offer guidance and assistance to correct his shortcomings. He also mentioned that diplomacy is extremely important and must rely on the people as its backing. It is also necessary to have experienced, knowledgeable, and academically accomplished people to plan carefully before there is any hope of victory. Fortunately, the members of this committee and the experts are all leaders in various sectors of society and well-known figures in the diplomatic and academic fields. If they can often provide assistance, the diplomatic authorities will naturally benefit greatly. Then, Lin Kanghou, Chu Seng Hui, Yu Qiaqing, and Xia Jinlin gave speeches, generally saying that the discussion group has achieved good results since its establishment. They hoped that Director Tang would be able to do more after taking office. The legal rights issue is currently under tense negotiation. The colleagues deeply hope that the authorities can continue to work hard to achieve their goals. If there are any questions, they are willing to do their best to offer advice. For a time, the atmosphere was lively, and the banquet did not end until 9:30 PM.</p>

<p>Dr. Love, a world-renowned crop expert from the United States, arrived in Shanghai, as reported in yesterday's newspaper (18th). The Ministry of Industry and Commerce invited the heads of Jiang and Zhejiang organizations and crop experts to a meeting at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday to determine specific plans for Dr. Love's work. After the ministry approves, they can be gradually implemented. The ministry hosted a banquet at the Hua An Building on the eighth floor last night to welcome Dr. Love. At about 7:00 PM, Dr. Love arrived with his wife and daughter. The invitees included Yang Dunfu, Dong Xianxian, Guo Bingwen, Zou Xie Bingwen, Cai Wuji, Shou Yicheng, and over thirty others. Vice Minister Mu Xiangyue represented Minister Kong Xiangxi as the chairman of the banquet. During the banquet, Vice Minister Mu gave a speech, saying that it was a great pleasure to have Dr. Love present for the gathering. Dr. Love came to China in 1925 to handle agricultural improvement matters and made outstanding achievements. He is now coming to China again to continue his previous work, which will be of great benefit to the improvement of agriculture in China, and there are endless hopes for the future. Although China is established on agriculture, it is shameful to say that it still has a large import of staple foods such as rice, wheat, and flour. With Dr. Love's qualifications, experience, knowledge, and cooperation with us, there will be many contributions to our country's agricultural construction in the future. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude and sincerity for cooperation. After the speech, Dr. Love responded with a speech expressing his gratitude for the grand hospitality. Everyone enjoyed themselves and dispersed at about 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Asks the National Government for Relief</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a telegram from the Beijing General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which stated: "To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China: We received a telegram from the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government's National Assembly Election General Office, which stated: 'To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government's National Assembly Election General Office: We hereby present a copy of the letter from the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting relief because merchants were suddenly deprived of their civil rights during the upcoming national election. We have read the report in the Beijing Municipal Election Office's report on March 31st that the Beijing Municipal National Election Office telegraphed the General Office the day before to explain four points of doubt. The reply was: "The first item states that the Chamber of Commerce should use the representatives of its affiliated trade associations and the direct members of the Chamber of Commerce's stores as electors, and there is no need to limit the age." We were shocked to learn of this. Restricting the merchants' due right to vote and distinguishing them from other professional groups concerns the merchants' personality, so we must request relief. We are now submitting three points to request a clear explanation. Please consider them: (1) Merchants and workers are on an equal footing. Workers who join the labor union have the right to vote, while store employees are also merchants, but they are restricted if they join the trade association. Those who are not representatives of the trade association cannot have the right to vote. The national regulations should not have such unfair provisions. This is the first request for clarification. (2) The regulations of the industrial and commercial trade associations stipulate that companies and firms in the same industry may be members of the trade association, while the detailed rules stipulate that each company and firm may send one person, and only those who have more than ten employees can recommend one store employee representative, and at most, no more than three. The intention is to regulate labor and capital by adjusting the number of main parties and the number of employees. However, although the users are not direct members of the association, they are indirectly members of the association. The store employees have the right to vote as store employee representatives, but the entire store employees who elected the representatives have no right to vote. It is not known under which regulations the restrictions are based. This is the second request for clarification. (3) For example, if a company has ten workers and ten store employees, the workers have one vote each, while the store employees cannot have one vote unless there are ten of them. Compared with each other, the workers are in a superior position, and they will actively participate in the election at the time of the election, while the majority of the store employees have had their right to vote deprived. As a result, they will become passive about the election, and no one from the business community will be elected. Although they are participating in name, it is only a formality. Why should the business community be included in the election? This is the third request for clarification.' Based on the above three points, merchants should strive for the right to vote. Now, the various associations in the city have come to the association to request that Prime Minister Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of civil rights is that the larger the organization, the thicker the power. Merchants and agricultural workers are in the same position, and store employees are also merchants. The first National Assembly election will strictly restrict and narrow the scope. In the future, merchants may never have a basis for foothold. Not only will they cancel their inherent qualifications, but also deprive them of their due human rights. The matter is unfair, and the group is deeply angry. We dare to state the reasons and request your office (government) to review and quickly correct the meaning of the previous explanation and give all merchants the opportunity to participate in the election in order to provide relief and show great fairness. We await your instructions and obey them." With this as the standard, it is felt that the merchants' efforts to succeed in the National Revolution are great. The merchants are the taxpayers, and all supplies are taken from our merchants. The current election regulations are far less than the workers in the comparison. It is difficult to accept. Please allow to clearly order the correction, stipulating that all merchants have universal suffrage, delete the representative provisions, and show fairness to the law. The Beijing General Chamber of Commerce's cold seal.</p>
<p>The association specially telegraphed the National Government yesterday to ask for help, which is recorded as follows: "To the National Government in Nanjing: A telegram from the Beijing Municipal Chamber of Commerce said that the application for the relief of merchants being deprived of the right to vote in the election. In addition to the cold-day telegram application, the corresponding telegram requests assistance. It is stipulated that the workers' right to vote is granted upon joining the membership, while the merchants' right to vote can not be granted unless it is the right of the voters. Therefore, the right of merchants to be elected and the equality of the election should be considered, and the uniformity of equal treatment should be the whole nation. To the Federation of the Chambers of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e162">More Than Fifty Trade Associations Petition for a Separate Qianzhuang Law <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The city's Chinese medicine industry, iron industry, fruit and land goods industry, wood industry, Chinese grain and oil cake industry, rice store industry, advertising industry, biscuit candy canned food industry, seafood grocery industry, dried goods industry, paint industry, Chaozhou refined grocery industry, paper industry, color printing industry, camp factory industry, Chinese pigment industry, oil press factory industry, department store industry, knitting industry, transshipment customs clearance industry, kerosene industry, yarn and cotton weaving industry, antique industry, Chinese soap industry, etc., more than fifty trade associations jointly submitted a document to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government yesterday, requesting the Legislative Yuan to expedite the enactment of a separate Qianzhuang Law, which stated: (Omitted above) I have read the news that Article 1 of the Banking Law passed by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that anyone who operates one of the following businesses but is not called a bank is also regarded as a bank, etc. Although the Qianzhuang is not explicitly listed in the article, it is actually included in it. Although the behavior of banks and Qianzhuang is similar on the surface, there is a big difference in their history and nature. The organization of banks belongs to a limited liability company, which has been in our country for a very short time. Even in remote towns, there is still no establishment of banks. The nature of their business is mostly buying and selling securities, managing real estate mortgages, and lending. The Qianzhuang industry is mostly a partnership nature. All shareholders bear unlimited liability. Its history in our country is very long. Even in inland cities, the Qianzhuang is the hub of finance. The nature of its business is to lend on credit as a common body. It is to put the two different natures into the same regulations, which is not appropriate. Moreover, when the domestic business is declining, the general small and medium-sized merchants rely on the Qianzhuang's credit to borrow money for turnover and circulation. If the Qianzhuang industry is forced to be restricted by the Banking Law, it will inevitably change its habit of lending on credit and take mortgaged goods as its goal. As a result, the Qianzhuang industry will be hindered by its business, and all industries will hinder its development. This is not the purpose of the government to love and protect industry and commerce. The law is responsible for adapting to the times. If it violates the times, why is it so valuable? The current environment in the country requires a Qianzhuang. It is not enough to adapt to the needs of the Chinese people unless a separate set of regulations is formulated. It is reasonable to submit a written application to your Ministry (Government) for consideration and transfer to the Legislative Yuan to speed up the deliberation and revision of the Qianzhuang Law to adapt to the times and meet the needs (omitted below).</p>
<p>The Silk and Satin Industry Association submitted a document to the Legislative Yuan yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the fact that the Banking Law is not applicable to the Qianzhuang industry, please enact a separate Qianzhuang law to suit the business conditions and avoid obstacles. I have read in the news that your hospital passed the Banking Law. I have carefully interpreted the meaning of the words in Article 1, which seems to include ordinary Qianzhuang in it. Therefore, the Qianzhuang Association in the city has had a quiet discussion about the obstacles to its business, and various businesses that have a relationship with the Qianzhuang also believe that the regulations cannot be suitable for the business conditions, and they all think that it is impossible. According to my country's commerce, all operations depend on the Qianzhuang's turnover to adjust the surplus and deficiency. It can pass through the youth and yellow and can be continued. It is the hub of all industries. From all cities and towns to various rural cities and towns, although the size is different, there is an organization of this industry. It has a long history in the business market and predates the production of the banking industry for thousands of years. If the organization is different, the nature is different, the advanced and the backward are forced into a kind of law, there must be a disease that does not conform to the people. It is only because the bank Qianzhuang, although the same as the financial industry, is completely different in nature. The bank is a limited company, and the Qianzhuang bears unlimited liability. The bank must mortgage loans, and the Qianzhuang can lend on credit. The mortgage of goods is sometimes poor, and the promotion of credit can be used at any time, so the Qianzhuang has a great impact on the flow of sales and the prosperity of the city. And the custom has been around for a long time, and all industries, large and small, are happy to deal with it. If there are dissimilar restrictions, it will not only be difficult for the Qianzhuang, but also the suffering of all industries. In the future, the operation will be stagnant, and the business market will decline, which will cause social panic. You are requested to enact a separate Qianzhuang law so that the customs can be dealt with and the financial center can be spared from changes, then the business is fortunate. There is also Article 5 of the same law, which states that the investor's property certificate must be attached when applying for approval. Although this method is for the sake of seriousness, to be fair, the content of the assets is often reluctant to be revealed. If the investors are worried about this, the entrepreneurial future will be reduced, and the social finance will be hindered. One heart of our association in all industries, so-called danger dare not keep silent, so the reason why the Banking Law does not apply to the Qianzhuang industry should be applied to the Qianzhuang industry. Please examine and approve to enact a separate Qianzhuang Law to suit the business conditions, which is for the public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Customs Clearance Industry Has Difficulty Resuming Work Temporarily <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Association's Attitude Remains Firm</p>
<p>The Union Cannot Comply with the Order to Resume Work</p>
<p>The customs clearance workers' strike in the city has been instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau to resume work within a specified period. The transportation costs are still to be transferred by the cotton cloth industry to the union. The union decided at a meeting to resume the transportation of cotton cloth tomorrow. The cotton cloth industry expressed its opposition. The customs clearance union held a meeting yesterday to negotiate, but there was no result. Therefore, the union decided to postpone the resumption of transportation. The various situations are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Cotton Cloth Association: After receiving instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Chen Songyuan of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, in order to respect the instructions and seek a peaceful solution, specially convened an emergency meeting of the local cotton cloth industry at 2:00 PM yesterday. The representatives who attended the meeting still insisted that they would not stop until they achieved their goals. After Chairman Chen's repeated persuasion, they slightly eased their attitude. On the spot, they unanimously decided that they would refuse to deliver the matters and would not pay the passes unless the proposed conditions were agreed with the customs clearance union. They also publicly elected Chen Songyuan, Zhou Rong, Sun Shaozhong, and Shi Jiucheng as the responsible representatives to attend the customs clearance union meeting at the Shangbang Association.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Customs Clearance Union: The Customs Clearance Industry Union held a representative assembly at 3:00 PM yesterday.

Chen Songyuan, Zheng Zhonghe, Shi Jiucheng, Zhou Rong, Sun and other four people from the Cotton Cloth Association, Su Houxin and six people from the Customs Clearance Union were present. Chairman Shi Zhikun had a long discussion, but there was no specific solution to the conditions proposed by the Cotton Cloth Association.</p>
<p>General Assembly of the Customs Clearance Union: In order to comply with government orders, the Customs Clearance Union had decided to resume the customs clearance of cotton cloth, etc., starting tomorrow. Because the Cotton Cloth Association opposed it yesterday, it held an emergency representative assembly at 6:00 PM yesterday. Over 150 representatives from various industries, including Su Houxin, attended. Chairman He Yumin and recorder Yu Qishu. The chairman reported on the meeting of the Customs Clearance Union and decided that (1) the resumption of work will be postponed until the 20th, (2) a general assembly will be convened on the 19th, (3) if the cotton cloth industry is not sincere, cotton yarn and foreign goods will be stopped on Monday, (4) the inspection team will be restored and will immediately continue to go out for defense.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Industry Proposes Conditions: The Cotton Cloth Industry Association proposed five new conditions and requested the Transshipment Customs Clearance Industry Union to acknowledge them: (1) No matter which factory or warehouse the goods are in, the customs clearance workers should go to the factory to transport the goods by themselves. If there are still cases of refusal to push or transport the goods, the Customs Clearance Industry Union shall be fully responsible. (2) From Ning Shao New Warehouse in the south, Yangshupu Road in the northeast, and the warehouses along the river, Maigen Road in the west, Sanban Factory New Bridge, and the warehouses along the Suzhou River, and the ticket numbers and warehouses in the central area from the Bund in the east to Tibet Road in the west, from the Republic Road in the south to the Boundary Road in the north, the goods within this area should be transported by the customs clearance workers themselves without paying for transportation. (3) The transportation costs of the cotton cloth in this factory (a separate transportation cost table will be formulated) will be paid according to the table without special additions or demands. The settlement will be made once a week. The customs clearance union will first collect the transportation costs from the buyers. If the buyers refuse to pay, the cotton cloth industry and the customs clearance industry shall share the costs. (4) All other expenses such as pier donations, inspection fees, and stamp duty shall be collected by the customs clearance industry from the buyers and shall not involve the cotton cloth industry. (5) For goods in Pudong warehouses that are transported by foreign companies, they must be able to clear customs until 10:00 PM before they can be returned.</p>

<p>Short-Term Solution - Recover Coal Debts According to Law</p>
<p>Long-Term Solution - Reclaim Coal Mines Held by Foreigners in China</p>
<p>The coal dispute resolution meeting at Kai Le still did not reach a solution yesterday. Various coal merchants are rushing to prepare a list of coal debts to be submitted to the Coal Industry Association, which will then forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request mediation from the Social Bureau in accordance with the law. The Coal Industry Association's opinions on the city's coal supply problem will be addressed in two steps: (1) Short-term measures: Recover the owed coal from the four distribution points according to the law; (2) Long-term measures: Since the Kai Le coal dispute arose from a shortage of coal supply, in addition to short-term measures, a fundamental solution to Shanghai's coal supply problem should be sought. Therefore, three proposals will be submitted to the National Assembly: (A) Reclaim the Kailuan Coal Mine: The joint venture contract between the Kailuan and Jizhou companies expired in 1920. Reclaiming it and operating it independently is justified in terms of law and reason, and there is no concern about a lack of capital for this profitable venture; (B) Extend the Cangshi Railway to Dagukou and connect it with the Zhengtai Railway. The tracks should be the same as the Zhengtai Railway to transport the massive amount of coal from Shanxi to supply the national needs and develop China's rich resources. Furthermore, connect the Ping Sui Railway from Kouhan to the vicinity of the Tongbao Coal Mine to facilitate the smooth transportation of Tongbao coal. Tongbao coal contains only one part per thousand of sulfur and can be considered the highest quality coal in the world, especially suitable for naval ships; (C) Reclaim the Fushun Coal Mine: The Fushun Coal Mine was forcibly occupied by Japanese troops and then transferred to the management of the South Manchuria Railway Company on April 1, 1907. It is now declared that it should be reclaimed and operated independently in accordance with the law. The above two short-term measures are awaiting mediation by the Social Bureau, and the long-term measures are currently being drafted and will be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion.</p>

<p>Strategies to Rescue the Textile and Flour Industries</p>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its sixth luncheon discussion meeting at the Lianhua General Association yesterday afternoon. Director Dr. Kong Yongzhi specially came to Shanghai from Beijing to chair the meeting. Attendees included Directors Rong Zongjing, Wu Qingtai, Guo Bingwen, Qian Chengxu, Shi Youming, Shou Yicheng, Tao Leqin, Xu Chao, Xu Dinglan, Zhang Xianglin, Zhu Yinong, Zhao Shutong, Cao Yunxiang, and other members. After the meal, Chairman Rong Zongjing, Director, gave a speech on the difficulties in operating China's textile and flour industries and the strategies to rescue them, stating that the textile and flour industries are of great importance to China's social economy. In recent years, competition with countries such as Britain, Japan, and Canada has become increasingly fierce, and the difficulties have been immense. The main reasons are excessive tax burdens, traffic obstruction, high freight costs, poor raw material quality, and unscientific factory management. The key to saving the situation lies in improving cotton production, reducing taxes and freight costs, and implementing scientific management. He also stated that Japanese flour can be imported duty-free in Dalian, Andong, and other places, encroaching on the market in the Eastern Provinces, which puts Chinese producers at a disadvantage. He hopes that the government authorities will find ways to help. Furthermore, China has too few textile experts, and he hopes that domestic engineering universities will establish textile specialties to train specialized talents. Chairman Kong expressed his gratitude on behalf of the association and stated that Premier Sun advocated that psychological construction and material construction should be given equal importance. Although China's industrial construction faces difficulties, as long as the whole country works together and all industry leaders can effectively promote scientific management, the future is still bright. Subsequently, Director Shou Yicheng of the association distributed a copy of the book "German Commercial Warfare Strategies" translated by Secretary-General Cao Yunxiang, which is very helpful for Chinese entrepreneurs, to the members present at the meeting. They were all eager to read it.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall of this city found that the items sent for display by various factories were too old and dilapidated. They have been returned and stored in the warehouse. If this continues, the items will inevitably be moldy and damaged, which is a pity. The hall is now preparing for the Double Tenth Festival's Tenth Anniversary Exhibition and the Permanent National Goods Commercial Exhibition and has started to clear out the old items in the warehouse. The goods must be cleared out completely before the end of May this year. Separate letters have been sent to the factories, instructing them to send personnel to the hall on a specific date to take back the old items to complete the procedures. If they fail to take them back after the deadline, the hall will sell all the items at a low price to close the matter.</p>

<p>Executed in Xincang the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Taihu Gang's famous bandit leader, Taibao A She, Xu Tianxiong, and his younger brother, Xu Fusheng, were ordered to be executed in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County, on the 16th, as reported earlier. His subordinate bandit, "Piggy" Ah Mei, Wang Qiming, was ordered to be escorted to Xincang Town, Pinghu County, for execution on the 17th. According to a report from Pinghu, "Piggy" Ah Mei committed more than a thousand crimes in the vicinity of Pinghu. Therefore, the Songjiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters requested and was approved to execute him. Yesterday (the 17th), Cao Pang, the bandit suppression commander of the four counties of Jinshan, Songjiang, Jiading, and Qingpu, and Xu Pucheng, the district chief of the first district of the Jiangsu Water Police Force, led dozens of soldiers and police officers on warships and escorted the bandit leader to Xincang in the afternoon. He was immediately tied up and beheaded at Xinjia Bridge in Zhujia Alley and his head displayed to the public. It took two strikes to sever his head from his body. The bandit's attitude remained the same as before his execution. Thousands of spectators gathered. The bandit's head has been taken away by the army and placed in a wooden cage to be displayed in the areas where he committed crimes.</p>

<p>Customs Maritime Affairs Section Patrol Engineering Division Bulletin No. 1002: This patrol engineering division, upon investigation by the Jianghai Customs Tax Office, found that a steamer sank in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River channel within its jurisdiction and installed a buoy to mark the sunken ship. The situation and position are listed below: Because the Dachang steamer sank in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River channel, its location is 85 degrees and 10 minutes west of the Wusong Lighthouse, 3.8 nautical miles away. The entire ship is not visible on the surface. A green buoy is installed, flashing a green light once every three seconds, that is, on for 0.3 seconds and off for 2.7 seconds. The buoy is moored 15% of a mile away from the sunken ship at 88 degrees east of south. From the buoy, the Wusong Lighthouse is 85 degrees and 6 minutes west of north, 3.96 nautical miles away. The above degrees are all based on the compass direction and refer to the Chinese Navy Hydrographic Chart No. 1011. All ships should pay attention and remember this to avoid accidents.

<p>Results of the Arbitration by the Wuhan Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Gonghe Steamer of the Qiahe Company had a dispute over labor between new and old workers, which was mediated by the Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Department of both Shanghai and Wuhan, but to no avail. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce designated the Wuhan Municipal Government as the competent administrative authority for the case and granted it arbitration powers, as detailed in previous reports in this newspaper. It is now known that the ship arrived in Wuhan on the 14th. The next day, the Municipal Government convened an arbitration meeting. The attendees included Ren Yaoxian from the Municipal Government, Gao Lang from the Municipal Party Department, Zhou Xingbin from the Local Court, Zhou Yunduan from the General Chamber of Commerce, Jiang Huanruo from the Labor Union, Ma Xisan and others representing the new workers, Huang Wenchen and Chen Bonian representing the Seamen's Union, and Xu Bingxiang representing the comprador. Chairman Ren Yaoxian, in addition to having representatives from all parties report on the situation, decided on the following: The 80 old workers will continue to work as usual. 30 of the 38 new workers will be allowed to stay, and who goes and who stays will be decided by drawing lots. Before the 8 workers who are laid off find other jobs, the new workers will subsidize them for a period of four months, and the amount will be determined by the new workers themselves. Regarding the issue of the 30 new workers joining the union, the Party Department and the Municipal Government will jointly send a letter to the Seamen's General Union to approve their membership to provide protection. Before the new workers join the union, Chen, the comprador, should pay a deposit, but the amount should not exceed the original amount. Once the membership formalities are completed, the comprador will return the deposit in full to the new workers to achieve unity and show equality. All three parties had no objection and signed on the spot. Thus, the labor dispute that had been dragging on for more than a year came to an end. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning, and it is said that when it sails to Wuhan the day after tomorrow, the 30 new workers can resume their work on board.</p>

<p>Social Bureau Sends Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>No Results in Negotiations</p>
<p>The Changjiang Steamer, which is operated by the Shanghai Steamboat Company as an agent, ran aground and sank in the waters off Wenzhou in the middle of last month, drowning many people. The surviving crew members, who reside in this city, have repeatedly demanded compensation from the company for losses and for the families of the deceased. Initially, the company only agreed to compensate each of the deceased with 200 yuan and each of the survivors with 50 yuan. After serious negotiations by the Seamen's General Union, the company agreed to compensate each of the deceased with 325 yuan and each of the survivors with 65 yuan. The crew members did not accept this. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., negotiations resumed between Li Zuyao, representing the Seamen's General Union, Ling Hong and Lin Xiong, representing the surviving crew members, and Cai Jingbo and Kang Shenji, representing the company, and others, at the Shanghai Steamboat Company at 35 Renji Road. Zhu Guilin, an official from the third section of the Social Bureau, also went to investigate. The workers' representatives put forward five demands: (1) Compensation for the deceased should follow the precedent of the Xinchang and Xinhua steamers, at least 500 yuan per person; (2) Survivors should be compensated at least 150 yuan per person; (3) Reimbursement of 250 yuan for the cost of food and lodging for the survivors in Shanghai; (4) Wages should be paid from April 1 until the crew members return to Hong Kong; (5) Reimbursement of travel expenses for each person to return to Hong Kong. The company representatives said that these demands had to be telegraphed to the Hai Fang General Company for approval before they could be accepted, so there were no results.</p>
<h3 id="e172">All Silkworm Moth Workers Went on Strike Yesterday <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-Six Factories Participating in the Strike</p>
<p>Hope for Resumption of Work Today</p>
<p>The silkworm moth workers in this city went on strike yesterday because the company violated the conditions for increasing wages, and they did not attend the talks convened by the authorities. The labor union announced that if the company did not pay the arrears by the 17th, they would go on strike. Thirty-six factories joined the strike. The Social Bureau obtained the company representatives' permission to fulfill the conditions and ordered the workers to resume work immediately, so there is hope for a resumption of work today. The situation yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike: Article 2 of the conditions agreed upon between the Silkworm Moth Workers Union and the company on October 28 last year stated that the factory would increase the wages of workers by 2 yuan per month, with the amount to be determined by the factory. The implementation period would be when more than half of the silk factories in Shanghai resumed operation. The silkworm moth workers requested the Social Bureau in March to order the company to fulfill the conditions because 80% of the silk factories in the city had resumed operation. The bureau summoned them three times for questioning, but the company did not send representatives, considering that they had no sincerity in the negotiations. Therefore, they all went on strike yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Number of Factories Joining: The silkworm moth workers joined the strike at the following factories: Toubei Gonggu Dou, Tanjiachiao Guangdechang, Zhicheng, Xin, Changda, Lunjuncheng, Juxing, Yuan, Yu San, De Tai, Wanchang, Hefeng, Yuncheng, Buxiang, Yunchang, Yuancheng, Jucheng, Yunfeng, Yingfeng, Wanfeng, Ruihe, Houyu, Dechang, Xiexingji, Xielong, Tongyi, Jin Wuji, Huichang, Xie Mao, Longxiang, Tongyi, Dexin, Tiancheng, Xiexinggong, Jingcheng, Wufeng, etc., totaling thirty-six factories.</p>
<p>Authorities Intervene: The Municipal Social Bureau learned that the silkworm moth workers had gone on strike due to the wage increase issue and immediately sent Guo Yongxi to investigate the truth and mediate. Zhu Zirong, the company representative, believed that the silkworm moth industry was different from other industries and that once a strike occurred, the stored cocoons would inevitably be useless. Therefore, he went to the Social Bureau last night and promised to take full responsibility for persuading the factories to immediately fulfill the conditions, but hoped for an immediate resumption of work. The bureau immediately ordered the silkworm moth workers to resume work immediately after receiving the report.</p>
<p>Union Petition: The Silkworm Moth Workers Union submitted a petition to the Social Bureau yesterday requesting a remedy, stating that the company had deceived the weak workers and refused to fulfill the legal labor-capital treatment contract, which had now sparked a labor unrest and left them helpless. They requested a review and compliance. The union stated that the workers were suffering from difficult living conditions and signed a labor-capital treatment contract, but the company intentionally deceived and delayed its implementation until now. After discussion, they submitted a request to the bureau for review and had been summoned to the bureau several times for questioning. However, the company was ignorant and disregarded the superiors and treated the workers like horses and cattle. Now the workers are oppressed and unable to extricate themselves. They unanimously took a rest today and appealed for the righteous to help. The union believes that this labor unrest was caused by excessive oppression by the company, which is to blame and cannot shirk its responsibility. The union is unable to remedy the urgent situation, so it has prepared a document and respectfully requests the bureau to review and comply. Submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau.</p>

<p>Satisfactory Results</p>
<p>The Municipal Ham Industry Association previously believed that the Zhenjiang Sixth District Office's heavy tax on ham slaughter was inappropriate because it was a double tax on one item. They sent a letter to the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office requesting an investigation, but without result. Therefore, they sent representatives Cai Xiaohe on a special trip to Beijing to appeal to the office to cancel the tax. Representative Cai returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday, saying that the appeal had been very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The Japanese ship, Yijin Maru of the Dalian Steamship Company, collided with the moored civilian ship Xu Yuanjie at Renjiagang, Nantong, at about 8:00 p.m. on the 10th of this month due to a mistake in the course. Because the Japanese ship did not provide assistance in accordance with maritime law at the time and because it was heavily loaded with ballast stones, the ship sank and could not be salvaged. The rising and falling tides gradually shifted the ship to deeper waters, making it more difficult to handle. The Yijin Maru, which caused the accident, had the shipowner, Ling Jiang, sign a document acknowledging the collision and agreeing to resolve it in Shanghai. However, when the victim ship arrived in Shanghai, the ship had already sailed to Qingdao with cargo. When they contacted its business organization, the Dalian Steamboat Company, they refused to compensate. They have requested the Zhejiang Shipping Association to send personnel to negotiate and have sent letters to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other groups to request assistance in urging them to quickly realize their mistake and compensate for the loss. They have also hired a lawyer to prepare for a legal solution as the second step.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Disposition of Communist Development Company Assets to Solicit Creditor Consent <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Resolution Achieved Through Mediation by Pan Gongzhan Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Pharmacy to be Unsealed Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Japanese and Chinese Bank case caused a dispute due to inconsistent opinions among the creditor groups. Social Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan mediated to quickly resolve this issue. Yesterday afternoon, he specially convened representatives of various creditors, lawyers, and the accountants of Pan and Wu, who were handling the liquidation, at the Municipal Government's Recreation Club on Weihaiwei Road. Attendees included Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Wu Jingxiong, Jiang Yiping, Chen Tingrui, Dong Yu, Yan Luqing, Bian Jialu, and other lawyers, and the accountants of Pan and Wu. Chairman Pan Gongzhan first had lawyer Jiang Yiping, representing the four voluntary lawyers appointed by the Social Bureau, state the process of applying to the Special District Court for the pre-trial attachment of the assets of the Communist Development Company and the reasons why the pre-trial attachment had to be implemented. He then stated that the revocation of the pre-trial attachment required the condition that the creditors represented by the four lawyers should have the right to agree on the disposition of the assets of the Communist Development Company and Huang Chujiu. He repeatedly stated the necessity of the creditors having the right to agree. The reasons were sufficient. After detailed discussion, a compromise was proposed. It was recognized that the creditor group had the right to agree to the disposition of the assets, but because there were too many creditors, it was too cumbersome to obtain the consent of each one. The representative lawyers of the creditor group should be responsible for contacting the accountants of Wu and Pan. The accountants of Wu and Pan also had no objection. Finally, two resolutions were passed: (1) When the accountants undertaking the liquidation dispose of all the assets of the Communist Development Company, such as the Zhaopan of the Chinese and Western Pharmacy, they should first formulate a plan and convene a meeting of all representative lawyers of the creditors three days in advance to discuss it. After obtaining the consent of the majority of the lawyers present at the meeting, they should report it to the French Concession for a decision; (2) The four lawyers, including Wu Jingxiong, should explain the whole story of the case to the parties concerned and request the Special District Local Court to revoke the pre-trial attachment of the Chinese and Western Pharmacy, etc., and the accountants should manage the accounts of the various business institutions of the Communist Development Company to provide protection. The Social Bureau has notified the accountants of Wu and Pan and the lawyers of these two resolutions, and all dispositions of the assets of the Communist Development Company must be in accordance with these resolutions. Therefore, the dispute over the right to agree has come to an end, and the progress of the case is expected to be smooth. It is also reported that the four lawyers, including Wu Jingxiong, have drafted a petition to the Special District Court to revoke the pre-trial attachment and plan to submit it on the morning of the 20th. The Chinese and Western Pharmacy is expected to be unsealed on the 20th. For the convenience of the proceedings, the four lawyers have opened a separate room in the law firm of Jiang Yiping at 48 Sichuan Road as an office for the case to handle all matters.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Jihong Temple's Jigong Hall was Burned Down <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Worker Flicked a Candle Wick, Causing the Disaster</p>
<p>Hall of Stars and Jigong Hall Destroyed</p>
<p>The Jigong Hall of the Longhua Temple was suddenly burned down yesterday morning. The details are as follows: The abbot of the temple, Yuanzhao, recently hired many workers to repair the walls and clean the Buddha statues in various rooms in preparation for the incense burning season. The workers lived upstairs in the north second room of the west hall in the second courtyard, and the floor below was the Hall of Stars. Straw mats were laid for the beds. They worked from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day. At 4:30 a.m. yesterday, the workers had all gotten up, but it was still dark. A candle lamp was lit in the room. A worker named Wang Daoming saw that the candle wick was too long and the light was dim, so he flicked off the candle wick with his finger and left it on the floor. He did not expect that the candle wick would fall into the straw and ignite it. At that time, the workers did not notice it. After a while, they suddenly heard the sound of the fish gong. The workers all went downstairs for breakfast and locked the door of the room. At 7:30 a.m., they saw smoke filling the room upstairs, and the fire had already spread. In an instant, the roof was on fire. The Longhua branch of the sixth district, third section, was nearby. Patrol officer Qiu Pengfei learned of the fire and immediately led all the police officers to help put out the fire. He also used the telephone to notify the fire departments of each district to come to the scene to put out the fire. However, the wind was too strong and it was impossible to control it for a while. Moreover, there was no tap water, so they had to use river water to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until 8:25 a.m. The Hall of Stars and two buildings and the Jigong Hall and three rooms were burned down. The abbot of the temple, Yuanzhao, sent the worker who caused the fire, Wang Daoming, to the police station for investigation. Director Liu briefly questioned him, and according to his confession, he was a 49-year-old man from Ningbo. He confessed the above and sent a document to the bureau for verification.</p>

<p>The bandits Xue Wu, also known as Xue Zhiming, Yang Yin San, and Xue Guo Qing, etc., previously robbed a stone boat in Dianshan Lake, sank the owner, Zhong Hehua, to the bottom of the lake to his death, and sold all the goods on the boat for money. They also raped the owner's wife, Cui Hu, and then sold her to Li Da Jinzi. This case was not discovered in Shanghai until February of last year. Xue Wu, Yang Yin San, and Xue Guo Qing were all arrested by the Public Security Bureau. Tang Er and Guo Wei Long were also arrested and sent to the Local Court. After the court prosecutor and criminal court judge conducted a detailed investigation and review of the evidence for seventeen months, it was finally found that Xue Wu, Yang Yin San, and Xue Guo Qing were the main perpetrators. It was found that the criminals' crime details and methods were cruel and their crimes were extremely deep. If they were not sentenced to the most severe punishment, it would not be enough to atone for their crimes. Therefore, after the debate was over, Judge Zhao Yongzhou opened the court at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to announce the verdict. The three defendants, Xue Wu, also known as Xue Zhiming, Yang Yin San, and Xue Guo Qing, were sentenced to death for the crime of robbery and murder, and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for the crime of raping and abducting women, to be executed together with the death penalty and deprived of civil rights for life. The remaining Li Da Jinzi, Feng Lian Bao, Tang Er, and Guo Wei Long were all acquitted. After the judgment was completed, the three criminals, Xue Wu, etc., were sent to the detention center for imprisonment pending review and execution by the province.</p>
<h3 id="e180">A Mother-Son Lawsuit <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Mother Wants to Dissolve Relationship with Son</p>
<p>Evidence Insufficient, Judgment Dismissed</p>
<p>The local woman Hou Chen has been a widow for many years and has one son and one daughter, who are all adults. Her daughter is married and her son, Gui Sheng, is married to a woman named Xu. However, after she married into the family, the sisters-in-law began to argue, and then the mother-son and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had opinions from time to time, and the good family became a place of disputes. Recently, Hou Chen sued the Special District Local Court, claiming that Gui Sheng was adopted and not her biological son, and requested to dissolve the mother-son and mother-in-law-daughter-in-law relationship. Gui Sheng hired lawyer Hong Shihhao to defend him, denying that he was adopted and claiming that Hou Chen gambled away her family property, borrowed money from Indians to make a living, and had a son and recruited a son-in-law, which was against the law. He requested that it be corrected. The court opened the trial a few days ago and summoned Hou Chen to testify. Hou Chen said that she only gave birth to one daughter, and because she had no son, she adopted Gui Sheng as her son, educated him when he was young, and married a wife for him when he grew up. Since their marriage, the son and daughter-in-law have been uneasy at home, colluding with each other, making excuses to quarrel, and even wielding knives and disregarding their elders. Now that they have separated, she should be allowed to dissolve the relationship with them. Lawyer Huang, representing the plaintiff, submitted an adoption document and called Shen Fusheng as a witness. Lawyer Hong Shihhao, defending the defendant, said that there should be considerable evidence to support the adoption claim before it could be believed. The adoption document was from 1907, and the witnesses in it were all dead, making it difficult to distinguish the truth from falsehood. Shen Fusheng was the son of the plaintiff, so it was difficult to testify. As for the separation of mother-son and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, it is a common trend in modern times, and it is also a helpless measure for the son. It is not acceptable in terms of etiquette, but it is still understandable in terms of sentiment. However, kinship cannot be broken due to separation. The defendant did not know who gave birth to him when he was born, but before the plaintiff provides conclusive evidence, he should be considered a biological son and is willing to undergo procedures such as blood dripping to clarify the truth. Yesterday, the court ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit, and the plaintiff was responsible for the litigation costs. The reason was that the witnesses in the adoption document were no longer alive, making it difficult to distinguish the truth from falsehood, and other evidence was also difficult to rely on. Therefore, the plaintiff lost the case.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (17th), three major properties in this city changed hands, all on Jing'an Temple Road. One was the property of the Longfei Car Company at the west end of the New World, opposite the racecourse, with an area of more than four mu, which was purchased by a Westerner for 700,000 taels. The second was the property next to the China United Assurance Company, with an area of more than five mu, which was purchased by a Chinese joint venture from China United Assurance for 975,000 taels. It is said that the new owners of these two places plan to build new-style buildings, but it is said that the Longfei property may not start construction immediately. It is rumored that after the property adjacent to China United Assurance is rebuilt, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will move in to work, but this has not yet been confirmed. In addition, the third place, the Da Hua Hotel, was also sold yesterday to a capital group composed of Chinese and foreign investors for 3.5 million taels.</p>

<p>It is heard that the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Engineering Society holds a regular monthly meeting. The April meeting is scheduled for the 21st at 6:00 PM at the Great China Restaurant across from the YMCA on Szechuan Road. After dinner, attendees will proceed to the laboratory of the National YMCA at 20 Museum Road to hear a lecture by Professor Robertson. The laboratory's architectural facilities and equipment are all designed with scientific methods. For example, the windows, curtains, and doors have special mechanisms for automatic opening and closing, making it a unique venue in Shanghai and extremely valuable to visit. It is heard that Professor Robertson's lecture is confirmed to be titled "Air is also a Lubricant." The lecture will be accompanied by various novel instruments and moving films displaying the electronic movements within various objects and the situation of air lubricating the Earth's axis, all of which are not easily seen or commonly encountered, making it extremely interesting. It is heard that the society has sent invitations to all members, asking them to invite friends and family to join in the grand event on that day.

<h3 id="e183">Embezzlement Case of the Day and Night Bank Staff <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Continued Trial at the French Concession Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Huang Xianzong Awaited to Testify</p>
<p>Chen Zhiquan, the manager of the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and chief accountant of the Gongfa Company, along with Chen Yuqing and Chen Xunqing, both in the accounting department, were accused of embezzlement by Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng, the liquidators of the Day and Night Bank, in the French Concession Court. The court ordered officials to arrest and detain Chen Zhiquan and Chen Yuqing at the police station, awaiting investigation. This information has already been reported in the newspaper. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the French Concession Court convened a hearing. Lawyers Fei Xizhen and Yan Luqing, representing various creditors, were present in court. First, the two accountants, Pan and Wu, stated that after the Day and Night Bank collapsed, the court appointed them as liquidators. The defendants provided six account books. After examining these books, the accountants found that the appearance of the books was unusually new and the accounts within were inconsistent. Therefore, they requested the detention of the defendants. Later, after receiving official capital account books and comparing them with the books submitted by the defendants, the accountants found a significant difference in the age of the books, further indicating collusion, fraud, and forgery on the part of the defendants. It was also discovered that on the day of Huang Chu Jiu's death, the 19th, the Day and Night Bank paid out over 2 million yuan. There were also five checks issued by Huang Chu Jiu totaling over 1 million yuan. Although they bore Huang Chu Jiu's personal seal, the signature was not Huang Chu Jiu's. According to the bank's articles of association, withdrawals require either a signature, a seal, or both, with the official seal as the standard. However, the withdrawals made by Huang Chu Jiu relied solely on the seal, and the signature was not his own. As the bank manager, how could the defendant not notice this and authorize the payment? Defendant Chen Zhiquan testified that Huang Chu Jiu, due to illness, instructed his son, Huang Xianzong, to come and withdraw the funds, and the signature was also made by Xianzong on his behalf because Huang Chu Jiu was the general manager. Accountant Pan also stated that Huang Chu Jiu mortgaged eight title deeds to the Day and Night Bank, valued at 800,500 yuan. The defendant then remortgaged the title deeds to the Siming Bank and the China Industrial Bank in the name of the Day and Night Bank for 680,000 yuan, a difference of over 100,000 yuan. This not only caused losses to the Day and Night Bank but also harmed the creditors. Subsequently, the defendant's representative, lawyer Yao Zhaodi, made a defense. Judge Zhu then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for seven days, summoning Huang Xianzong to testify and conduct further investigation.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Trust Company at 801 North Szechuan Road published advertisements announcing the sale of public land in sections, it has been widely praised and gained a strong reputation.</p>
<p>In recent years, land prices have soared, and landlords have repeatedly increased rents. Patrol donations have also increased accordingly, causing tenants to struggle financially, leading to frequent disputes between landlords and tenants. Moreover, tenants face various inconveniences when renting, such as small deposit rentals. The annual leakage of rent money is considerable, and since the house is not their own, they are unwilling to decorate it. However, purchasing real estate is beyond the reach of most people. Considering the above reasons and embracing a spirit of service, the company spared no expense to purchase public land on Jiangwan Road and divide it into small sections so that even those who are not wealthy can realize their dream of owning property. Moreover, the land is adjacent to Hongkou Park, with fresh air, a peaceful location, and convenient transportation. In Shanghai today, it is difficult to find such a good location. In recent days, many people have visited the site to inspect the land, and it is heard that there is not much left. If you do not purchase it soon, you may regret it.</p>

<p>The *Continental Daily* reports that yesterday's newspaper stated that the Soviet Russian government telegraphed the German Consulate, stating that the Russian Consulate building and furniture on Huangpu Road were severely damaged. The reporter specifically interviewed the German Consul General to inquire about this statement. He claimed that he had not heard of this. It has been some time since the Soviet Russian delegation came to discuss the return of this building for use by trade organizations, but a concrete agreement has not yet been reached. Since the German Consulate took over the management of this building three years ago, they have regularly sent people to inspect and take care of it. The Soviet Russian side has never sent anyone to inspect it, so how would they know the situation inside? In any case, it is unlikely that the Russian side would make such a statement. Subsequently, the reporter met with Li Wen, the manager of the Russian Assistance Society, who also stated that he had never heard of such a telegram and that the condition of the interior was satisfactory. Last night, it was also reported by the Chinese side that if the German Consulate returns this building to the Soviet Russian trade representatives, it must first obtain the consent of the Chinese authorities. It is heard that the visit of German Consul Fuchs to Beijing is related to this matter.</p>

<p>New Discovery in Chemical Therapy for Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Dr. Koch Discovers the Pathogen of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Dr. Bergell Successfully Develops a Method for Dewaxing Tubercle Bacilli</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Pathogen of Tuberculosis <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Exactly forty-nine years ago, on March 24, 1882, Dr. Robert Koch, a German medical saint, presented a highly valuable medical paper at the Physiology Congress in Berlin, Germany, titled "The Cause of Tuberculosis." The purpose of the doctor's report was to state that tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is a specific infectious disease, not a hereditary disease, and he cited various examples to prove it (such as the culture, staining, and animal experiments of tubercle bacilli). This opened a special and unique chapter in the history of tuberculosis research over the past three thousand years. With the pathogen of tuberculosis identified, a definitive standard was established for diagnosing tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Tubercle bacilli are microscopic fungi. Their shape is extremely small and minute. If one "gram" of it is weighed, the number would be more than 3.5 billion. Their reproductive capacity is astonishing, destroying human tissue and causing the most terrible tuberculous diseases. When these bacteria are discharged from the human body, they cannot reproduce at all and can only maintain their survival. However, once they have the opportunity to invade the human body, they occupy the delicate lungs and establish a base of operations, unleashing their terrible power. Alas, the greatest enemy of mankind is tuberculosis, which is to be feared.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Structure of Tubercle Bacilli <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>In the past, most doctors, not understanding the unique structure of tubercle bacilli, believed that all bacteria could be eradicated with disinfectant drugs, administered internally or by injection, just like "606" for syphilis. After Dr. Bergell's painstaking research, he announced that tubercle bacilli have a special defense mechanism that can resist attacks from all external drugs. The tubercle bacillus is composed of an inner membrane of neutral fat and an outer membrane of acid-fast wax. Unless a method is found to break through the wax barrier and dissolve the fatty armor, it is impossible to capture and destroy the tubercle bacilli. Moreover, when tubercle bacilli invade a local part of the human body, they erode the surrounding area and form a stubborn nodule that blocks blood flow, preventing generally injected or ingested disinfectant drugs from penetrating even a single step beyond the restricted area. It is like a specially guarded zone, and the drug's power cannot reach the affected area. Therefore, even if the entire body is immersed in a pool of drugs, it cannot harm a single hair of the tubercle bacilli. Therefore, the only battle strategy for eradicating tubercle bacilli must meet at least the following two preconditions:</p>
<p>(1) The drug must be able to break through the nodules and reach the affected area directly.</p>
<p>(2) It must also be able to strip away or dissolve the waxy and fatty inner and outer membranes.</p>
<p>Only in this way can the effect of breaking through barriers and capturing the enemy be achieved. Otherwise, it is like scratching an itch from outside a shoe. The tubercle bacilli, under these two layers of protection, secretly laugh at human helplessness.</p>
<p>Dr. Koch, the German medical saint and discoverer of tubercle bacilli</p>
<h3 id="e191">Successful Dewaxing of Tubercle Bacilli <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Since Dr. Koch discovered tubercle bacilli as the cause of tuberculosis (i.e., consumption), scholars of tuberculosis from the East and West have striven to research and develop a magic formula to kill these bacteria. However, their efforts have all failed because they did not understand the profound theory that tubercle bacilli secrete a waxy substance to surround their bodies to defend against external forces. For example, Hammarsten-Harris and others discovered that the application of 5% to 10% caustic potash solution could remove the acid-fast wax of tubercle bacilli. Later, Morquin used chlorine gas to remove the acid-fast wax. However, this dewaxing method can only be applied to staining methods for microscopic examination. The drug's properties are too toxic for practical use on the human body.</p>
<p>In recent years, occasional successful results have been achieved by applying chaulmoogra oil to leprosy. Leprosy bacilli and tubercle bacilli are both acid-fast bacteria of the same nature, and chaulmoogra oil has a dewaxing effect and a bactericidal power a hundred times greater than carbolic acid. This aroused widespread attention among scholars, who tried to apply chaulmoogra oil to tuberculosis patients, hoping to achieve results. They used various chemical methods to extract the main components of chaulmoogra oil and tested them on tuberculosis patients, hoping to achieve a corresponding effect. However, this was only effective for skin and superficial tuberculosis, and it still could not achieve any effect on deep organ tuberculosis, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys.</p>
<p>Therefore, Dr. Bergell, the great teacher of all tuberculosis patients in the world, went a step further, collecting various medicinal substances of animal, plant, and mineral origin, and painstakingly researching them, hoping to find a dewaxing agent that was peaceful and non-toxic. For decades, he tirelessly devoted all his efforts and energy to seeking the most rational and effective chemical agent. Finally, he discovered that a certain effective component in the pressed juice of the intestinal mesenteric gland of a special animal has a strong dewaxing effect on tubercle bacilli. He immediately applied this component to tubercle bacilli, and the result was complete dewaxing. Since then, the long-held view of doctors in the East and West that artificial removal of the acid-fast properties of tubercle bacilli was impossible has been completely overturned. This is truly a new dawn in the treatment of tuberculosis, a major question in the medical world for thousands of years.</p>

<p>The cause of tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is tubercle bacilli. Once these bacteria enter the human body, they form nodules in the affected area to block blood flow. Tubercle bacilli can also secrete an acid-fast wax to surround their bodies and defend against invasion by all external drugs. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they cannot reach the actual body of the bacteria. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, drug therapy, and other therapies commonly used by doctors in the past have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for consumption is widespread because this profound theory was not known. Based on the above theory, modern tuberculosis scholars continue to research tirelessly, and the result is the creation of this chemical holy agent for killing all tuberculosis bacteria, called Sanosln. This drug was successfully invented based on the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch, the German discoverer of tubercle bacilli, and Dr. Bergell, the German inventor of tubercle bacilli dewaxing. According to experimental reports from various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of tuberculous lesions and dissolving the wax, and it also has bactericidal power. It can radically cure stage one, two, and three tuberculosis and has a proven effect in all cases. In China, it has been tested by the Central Health Laboratory of the National Government, and the drug's properties are peaceful and non-toxic, with no side effects. A brief description of the therapeutic effects is given below:</p>
<p>(1) When the power of "Sanosln" is tested in a test tube, tubercle bacilli lose their acid-fast properties after one minute, and after three minutes, the tubercle bacilli are completely killed, with none spared.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have found that "Sanosln" can penetrate into tuberculous lesions. Examination of the latent tubercle bacilli in the lesions shows that they have all lost their acid-fast properties, proving that the wax has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If the patient takes "Sanosln" for about a week, they will see good results such as sputum dilution and a decrease in body temperature.</p>
<p>(4) If they continue to take "Sanosln" for more than thirty to sixty days, they will see an increase in weight, an increase in appetite, and all symptoms gradually alleviating, thus achieving the great effect of bringing them back to life.</p>

<p>Strict Prohibition by the County Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently reported from the County Construction Bureau that the seedlings planted on both sides of the North Huixian Road during Arbor Day have recently been damaged and removed by villagers. The section from North Huixian Bridge to Dutugang is particularly severe and should be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.

Finance Committee member Wang Yansong reported on the donation of 5,000 yuan from Jisheng Yarn Factory as a general hospital fund and proposed that the 5,000 yuan be temporarily used for general expenses for March and April. When the fixed general expenses are raised in the future, the amount will be repaid. Zhu Wenqi said that the hospital has benefited laborers and won the praise of people in the community, meeting the needs of laborers. Although the general expenses are slightly insufficient, everyone is responsible for finding solutions, so it should not be a problem. There were many proposals for discussion, some of which are recorded below: (1) The proposal to temporarily borrow 5,000 yuan donated by Jisheng Yarn Factory for general expenses for March and April was passed.

<h3 id="e196">Dissection of Bandit Corpses Not Allowed <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Tongde Hospital Wanted to Use Them for Academic Research</p>
<p>The District Court Prohibited Further Desecration Due to Difficulty in Executing Sentences</p>
<p>The other day, the District Court executed the four bandits, Yang Zhengting and others, sentenced by the Special District Court at the Second Prison in Caohejing. After the execution, the corpses were ordered to be collected by the Tang Guild Hall, awaiting relatives to claim them. However, Tongde Hospital in the Public Concession took away the corpses of the executed criminals Yang Zhengting and Li Kepeng for dissection and experimentation. This was discovered by the District Court Prosecutor yesterday morning. Since the criminals had relatives who would claim the corpses in the future, and since they had already been sentenced to death by shooting for their crimes, their corpses should not be further desecrated. Furthermore, desecration of corpses is prohibited by law and unacceptable to morality. The court cannot act illegally, so it immediately notified the hospital to not allow the dissection and ordered them to return the corpses to the prison for collection to show respect for humanity.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Ring the Doorbell Before Buying Opium <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Method is Very Appropriate</p>
<p>Police Handle the Matter According to the Law</p>
<p>Xia Chen, a woman who has recently been selling opium, has a doorbell installed on the front door of her residence at 19 Wuzhou Road. Anyone who wants to buy opium must first ring the doorbell and then go to the back door of the house. She will then open the back door and let them in. Those who do not know this secret will not be able to buy it. Recently, someone revealed this secret to the police, who sent a detective to purchase two small bags of opium. On the afternoon of the other day, at 2:00 PM, the police chief led the detectives to make an arrest, first ringing the doorbell at the front door and then going to the back door. The second landlord of the house, Ge Wang, was already waiting at the back door and was arrested. They then entered the house and arrested Xia Chen, searching her residence and finding twenty-two small bags of opium, a set of opium paraphernalia, and cash, including two silver coins that the police chief recognized as the ones he had sent someone to buy opium with earlier. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court. Judge Feng Shide conducted a preliminary hearing and, finding the evidence sufficient, immediately sentenced Xia Chen to one year and four months of imprisonment and a fine of 320 yuan. Ge Wang was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, and the opium was confiscated.</p>

After preparing lunch at home, she planned to go to the store to invite her husband, Guolai, to eat together.

She fainted on the ground, bleeding profusely. The Indian police arrived and took her to Tongren Hospital and then to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Due to her old age and blood loss, she was still in danger late into the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e199">A Ferry in Pudong Collided <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Passengers and Family Members Drowned</p>
<p>The Pudong ferry operated by Jiang Kunhua departed from Shanghai the other day. Ling Qingtang, the owner of a construction company, and his wife and children, a total of six or seven people, chartered Jiang's boat to visit graves in the countryside of Datuan Township. The boat also carried cargo such as sugar, northern goods, and tung oil. It departed during high tide the other night and arrived near Xinchang at about 4:00 AM yesterday. It was still dark when they suddenly heard the whistle of a steamer approaching rapidly. Seeing that the steamer was traveling quickly, Jiang steered the boat towards the dock and shouted to slow down the steamer. However, the steamer still approached rapidly and crashed into Jiang's boat head-on. The hull was shattered, and the tide rushed into the boat. The passengers, including Ling Qingtang, were shocked by the crash and the water rushing into the front of the boat. They came out of the cabin and shouted for help, while Ling's wife and daughter cried out. Seeing the accident, the steamer stopped and rescued the people, towing Jiang's boat to the dock. Ling and his wife and children were rescued to the steamer. However, Ling's wife and daughter were extremely panicked and accidentally fell into the river. It was not known at the time. When Ling was rescued to the steamer and checked, he did not see his wife and daughter. He immediately asked the steamer to search for them. It was dark at the time, making the search difficult. They had not been found by daybreak. The steamer that caused the accident belongs to Shen, the owner of a Pudong kiln. Because Shen had important business in Shanghai, Shen sat on the ship and started to Shen at two o'clock yesterday morning. After the accident, Ling negotiated with the steamer about the loss of the boat. Shen comforted Ling, saying that it was the error of the steamer's helmsman and was willing to be responsible for salvaging Ling's wife and daughter's corpses and all the losses in the boat. Ling initially refused, but Shen repeatedly persuaded him and eventually agreed.</p>

This year, he is building a new house. When relatives and friends heard about it, they asked Xie to borrow money, but Xie refused, saying that he would not lend money without collateral. Those who wanted to borrow money were resentful. The other day, Xie went to the grave to sweep the tomb. On the way home, he was suddenly attacked from behind by an enemy who stabbed him seven or eight times in the back, neck, and legs with a knife. Xie fell to the ground unconscious. A neighbor saw him and reported it to his wife, who carried him home. Yesterday, Xie's wife applied for medical treatment and investigated the assailant, sending him to the authorities for investigation.</p>

<p>Estimated to be Over a Hundred Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, Yin Zhennan and other team members of the second team of the Water Patrol of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were patrolling the Suzhou Creek in North Shanghai when they saw a person standing on the Yuansheng tugboat. They observed that the cotton jacket he was wearing was thicker than usual and estimated that the weight of the jacket was quite different, making it suspicious. They immediately approached him for inspection and found concealed red pills estimated to be over a hundred taels inside the thick jacket. They also found five boxes of red pills in the basket he was carrying, estimated to be over ten taels. They immediately took the person and the evidence back to the South City Headquarters. During the preliminary hearing by Team Leader Xu, the person stated that his name was Yu Wenshou, 25 years old, from Huizhou. The clothes and basket were entrusted to him by a friend, and he did not know that there were prohibited items hidden inside. When asked why he was wearing the clothes if they were not his, Yu was speechless. Because the matter involved smuggling poisonous red pills, it was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Investigation of Two Cases of Seized Opium <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 3:00 AM, before dawn, Zhao Liangcai, the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team, dispatched detectives Wang Jiheng and team member Lu Gengsheng on a patrol boat to inspect the jurisdiction. They arrived at the Huangpu Wharf in Hongkou and noticed a person standing on the dock. Shortly after, another person came from the Fengtian steamboat docked there, carrying a burlap sack onto the shore. The person appeared flustered and suspicious. The officers shouted to stop, and the person looked back, saw the police, and hastily discarded the burlap sack next to the person who was standing there, then fled. The police jumped ashore and gave chase, but quickly lost sight of the fleeing person. They returned and opened the abandoned burlap sack, discovering over 960 taels of opium inside. Suspecting the person standing nearby, they detained him and brought him and the seized opium back to the team for preliminary interrogation. The person identified himself as Zhao Liangcai, 45 years old, claiming to be a temporary dockworker. He stated that he was watching dockworkers unload cargo when someone suddenly threw a burlap sack next to him, after which the police discovered the opium and arrested him. The team was instructed to prepare a document to be submitted to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Shou Agou: Yesterday, while patrolling the Huangpu River, Zhu Desheng and other team members of the Third Squad of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team, Yangsi Port Police Station, observed a Shaoxing boat docked there. Upon inspecting the boat, they found an iron bucket in the cabin. After managing to open it, they discovered 23 packages of opium inside, totaling approximately 220 taels. When the police attempted to take the boat owner into custody, the owner became frightened and quickly pulled out eight silver dollars from his person, attempting to bribe the officers to avoid arrest. The officers refused the bribe and detained him, taking him, the evidence, and the bribe money back to the Third Squad. The patrol officer prepared a document and transferred it to the General Team. After a preliminary interrogation led by Team Leader Xu, the person identified himself as Shou Agou, 44 years old, from Shaoxing. He claimed that an unknown person had asked him to transport the iron bucket to Songjiang and admitted to attempting to bribe the police. He was instructed to prepare a document to be submitted to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Various Industries Telegraph Requests to Correct Business Tax <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Cosmetics Industry: The Cosmetics Industry Association yesterday telegraphed the National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, and Ministry of Finance regarding the business tax issue, stating, "The implementation of the business tax on a per-industry basis means that all businesses dealing in cosmetics are taxed as cosmetics businesses, which is the duty of the people. It is reported that the business tax rates in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces classify cosmetics as the highest category, the same as paper firecrackers and funerary items, which has caused widespread dismay. We have investigated and found that the unit price of domestic cosmetic items is only a few cents, and their uses, such as toothpaste, tooth powder, and mouthwash, are for dental protection; hair oil, hair tonic, pure honey, and cold cream are for skin and hair protection; washing powder, bath salts, and prickly heat powder, as well as their accessories such as pig bristle and bone toothbrushes, rabbit hair, or silk cotton powder puffs, are designed to prevent disease and promote health, and are essential daily necessities for personal hygiene. They are not like imported cosmetics, whose unit price is over one yuan and cater to the luxurious tastes of wealthy families, or like paper firecrackers and funerary items that should be prohibited. The import of foreign cosmetics is either handled by Western medicine businesses or foreign goods businesses, so their business tax rate only needs to be paid once according to the Western medicine or foreign goods industry. We have not heard of any Chinese cosmetics manufacturers also selling foreign cosmetics, which shows that the domestic cosmetics manufacturing industry is purely operated by Chinese merchants. Therefore, their business tax rate should be taxed at a rate of 0.2% as daily necessities to ensure fairness. Otherwise, domestic cosmetics manufacturers will pay the first tax as manufacturers, then the distributors will pay the second tax as wholesalers, and then the retailers will pay the third tax as retailers. How can they compete with foreign goods? Now that the government is actively promoting domestic goods and issuing orders to encourage industry, it is necessary to protect the domestic cosmetics manufacturing industry, which is neither a luxury item nor an item to be banned like paper firecrackers and funerary items. We hereby telegraph the Executive Yuan (Ministry) to consider the situation, sympathize with the difficulties of merchants, and order (consult) the Ministry of Finance to quickly correct the business tax rate for the cosmetics industry to lighten the burden on merchants and maintain industry. We are grateful and await your decision. Cosmetics Industry Association, Shanghai, April 18, 20th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>New Medicine Industry: The New Medicine Industry Association yesterday telegraphed the Central Political Conference and the Legislative Yuan, stating, "The Ministry of Finance's revised business tax regulations for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces tax new medicines at 0.5%, which violates the Ministry's promulgated business tax regulations. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has submitted the revised business tax regulations to the Legislative Yuan for review. We hereby telegraph the Legislative Yuan to consider the suffering of medicine merchants and correct the new medicine business tax during the review, not exceeding 0.2% to comply with the Ministry's established guidelines and lighten the burden on merchants and citizens."</p>

<p>(1) A nameless male corpse suddenly floated up near the Yangjingbang Wai River a few days ago. The corpse was wearing a blue cloth long gown, had no hat, and was about thirty years old. It was discovered by a coal dreg boat, which reported it to the Water Patrol Station. The police sent a patrol to retrieve the corpse and transport it to the Rescue Bureau for collection, awaiting identification and collection. (2) Also, at 7:00 AM yesterday, a nameless male corpse floated up on the Suzhou River outside the American Consulate. The corpse was wearing an empty blue long gown and was in extremely poor condition, especially the face, which was horrifying to look at. The age was difficult to estimate, but it had probably been drowned for several months. It was discovered by Chinese patrol No. 65 of the Water Patrol Station, who retrieved it and transported it to the South City Rescue Bureau for collection.</p>

<p>Incense Industry: The Incense Industry previously jointly requested the Shanghai Civic Training Association to allow them to initiate the organization of the Incense Industry Association, and nominated Zhu Xinlong, Jindingzhai, Wang Dayou, and eighteen other companies. Zhu Yongyuan, Ma Guifang, Huang Jinyi, Zhu Jiahan, Zhang Yueqing, Ye Baolin, and Sun Yaoxun were nominated as representatives. Yesterday, they received approval from the Civic Training Association to establish the association and were issued license No. 48. It is reported that the association is actively preparing and will hold its inaugural meeting soon.</p>
<p>Quicklime Factory Industry: The Quicklime Factory Industry Association held its 14th Executive Committee meeting yesterday, which resolved the following: (1) A letter was received from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce soliciting donations for disaster relief in Shaanxi. The committee decided to donate thirty yuan per factory and requested all group members to solicit donations separately to be collected. (2) It was reported that the Brick and Ash Industry Association's resolution accused the quicklime factories of taking advantage of the shortage of Kai Ping coal and the soaring market prices to engage in monopoly and profiteering. The committee decided that it is well known that there is a shortage of Kai Ping coal. In order to meet the needs of various factories, Fushun coal was purchased to burn ash, and prices had to be temporarily increased to maintain costs. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has approved and recorded this. However, Zhishun, Xiehetai, Fusheng, and other brick and ash merchants from the association purchase ash from various ash factories and resell it for 2.8 to 3.8 yuan per load, making a large profit in the process. The association does not know how to maintain its reputation and dares to damage the reputation of our association. It should notify all ash factories to temporarily suspend trading with the association's merchants until they realize their mistake. At the same time, the legal consultant, Zheng, should be asked to send a warning letter. (3) The date of the association's general meeting was set for April 25th.</p>
<p>New Method Dyeing and Cleaning Industry: The New Method Dyeing Industry Association has appointed a committee to draft industry regulations to carry out rectification.

<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>After being entrusted by the governments of the two Entente countries, I finalized my battle plan based on the instructions I presented to the French Prime Minister two days prior, restating it as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The French and British armies must be closely connected to protect Amiens.</p>
<p>(2) To this end, the troops already engaged in battle must hold their positions.</p>
<p>(3) Under their protection, the French reinforcements, after disembarking, would first reinforce the British Fifth Army and second assemble and await orders.</p>
<p>The plans for the British army to fight alone to save the English Channel and for the French army to fight alone to save Paris were canceled. We now decided that the French and British armies would fight together to save Amiens, which was the point of intersection of the two armies.</p>
<p>I further drafted detailed implementation rules. In times of urgency, I explained the plan in detail to the relevant senior officers. Then, at 4:00 PM, I went with General Gough, commander of the British Fifth Army, to Dury. I instructed him to remain at the front line and strictly order his troops to hold their positions and await the arrival of the French army, starting partial adjustments from the south.</p>
<p>I also met General Foye's Chief of Staff, General Buserlemi, at Dury, and gave him the same instructions: he must hold Amiens.</p>
<p>I asked Major Malang, the liaison officer of the French headquarters, to report these military orders to General Petain. I also notified General Depenne, commander of the First Army, by telephone, instructing him on how to proceed.</p>
<p>This army was being deployed towards Montdidier, its position being particularly important because the</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>reconnection of the French and British lines depended entirely on it. I connected the telephone from Dury to Menard and spoke directly with General Depenne, explaining that his mission was to have him send all his troops to the front line to replace the British 18th Corps. The replaced troops were to be transferred to General Gough as reserves. He must connect with the British troops on the left, towards Rocheleau, and hold the line.</p>
<p>On the same day, the 26th, I notified all the commanders on the front line of my plan. In the evening, General Petain canceled the instructions of March 24th and ordered General Foye to protect Amiens and maintain contact with the troops of General Haig. He further ordered the transfer of ten infantry divisions and four artillery regiments from other corps to reinforce the reserves.</p>
<p>After spending one night in Paris, I set out for the front line again on the morning of the 27th, accompanied by General Weygand and Colonel Didier. Before setting out, I wrote a secret letter to General Petain, urging him to proceed according to the plan and asking him to explain its necessity to the French army. General Petain and his subordinates were able to cooperate effectively and meet the enemy without further explanation.</p>
<p>I first went to the headquarters of General Humbel, commander of the Third Corps, in Clermont, where I met General Foye. I reiterated my instructions, which were to hold the line and not replace any troops until the first success was achieved.</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, I went to Dury to see General Gough regarding the connection between the right wing of the British army and the left wing of the French army. This connection was not very stable due to the hasty retreat of several troops of the British 18th Corps. I explained the new plan to General Mossberg, commander of the left wing of the French First Army, and asked General Gough to personally confirm whether the British 18th Corps had received my instructions and was proceeding accordingly.</p>
<p>I then visited General Byng, commander of the British Third Army, in Beauquesne. He explained that the situation on his side was not serious. He expressed his full support for my battle plan and was willing to do his best to ensure its success.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of a general reserve force, it was not possible to restore the line from the outset. The first step that needed to be implemented urgently was to quickly weld together the various sections of the line that had been broken through and stretched by the German army. The most important thing was that all retreating soldiers or arriving reinforcements, regardless of their nationality, must be of one mind and work together. Because any plans for troop adjustments had been temporarily put on hold, there would be no hope of defeating the enemy in the next few days if this could not be achieved. (To be continued)</p>
