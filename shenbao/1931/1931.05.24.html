<p>— 文若翁</p>
<p>中央委員兼任立法委員焦易堂氏。近赴陜考察黨務歸。十八日在立法院紀念週報告陜西奇災。謂陜災之慘及其奇特。皆爲曠古所未有。凡履陜境者。雖盲且聾。亦能知其災情之奇慘。蓋未埋之餓殍達四十萬具。蒸臭達數千里。觸鼻即知也。現在全陜已達有路無人走之境况。昔日之汽車道。今則蓬蒿滿目。荆棘遍途。但見白骨成堆。汽車已不知何往矣。至陜災搆成之原由。則一爲蝗。二爲旱。其三則爲聞所未聞之鼠災。陜北一帶縱横千里之中。忽於一日内發現五色鼠數千頭。遍地皆是。大者如狸。小者如常鼠。貓狗見之皆驚避。斑斕之色。漫山塞野。至人不能下足。越日盡失農作物。再一夜則倉厫盡空。逾晨民食罄盡而鼠亦不見。中西人士之往研究者。咸不能明其所自來。鄉人或謂爲牛羊糞中之白蟲所化。但亦未能證信。然必非胎生。（胎生無繁殖如此之速者）則可斷言。於是千里空儲。民盡枵腹。乃成千古未有之奇災。不一來復而饑死者數千人。如斯鼠災。誠不知所自來。然而陜民無噍類矣。焦君言時。並指壁案各色爲證。謂鼠毛繽紛咸備。不若常鼠顔色之簡單云。噫。浩劫之來。如此奇特。實亙古所未有。科學者曷從而研究。使不再爲患。或得預防。則亦人類之福音也。</p>

<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>自從中國的茶葉。介紹到歐西各國以後。西方的人們。居然也有一部分不飲咖啡。飲起茶來了。因此。茶的銷路。也一天發達一天。我們在各國大城市中走過。差不多到處可以看見有茶葉店的開設。英國有一家茶葉店。開店的老閭。是一個年輕的少女歐文小姐　M　issMargaret　lrving。伊對於各種茶葉。進貨的時候。都要嘗試一下。以辨茶味。可是因爲每天嘗試而所費的茶價。一年竟有五千金鎊之多。</p>
<p>伊的辨茶方法。的確有獨到之處。委實可稱辨茶大王了。伊的店裏。每年所進的茶葉。價值也在金洋百萬以上。事業的確不小。據說經伊一度的嘗試。茶的新鮮與否。不必說能夠辨别出來。連出産的地方。也能辨出。這或許是言過其實。然而品質的優劣。經伊一辨。的確就不能瞞過伊了。</p>
<p>說起了伊辨茶的方法。也非常有趣。伊的家裏。豫備着不少的小茶壺和茶杯。進貨的時候。把每種樣品。彼此分量相同。放在小茶壺裏。用開水泡下去。經過六分鐘後。便倒在杯中。一一嘗試。據伊說來。鑒别茶葉的方法。顔色現淡的靑銅色的。品質最好。這原是伊的經騐之談。我們也不能不相信呢。</p>

<p>— 黄炎培</p>
<p>六日到東京。</p>
<p>十多年不到東京了。頗聞大地震後。復興的成續。市街房屋。比以前還要體面。於是抱着很大的熱望。留心觀察。整潔是日本固有的美俗。就論到市容。果然偉大堂皇。比從前大大的不同。交通設備。尤爲可驚。如地面鐵道以外。還有高架鐵道。地底鐵道。可是人客不多。街道殊未見擁擠。他處不說了。就是最熱鬧的銀座。一點不覺得熱鬧。尤其是各處飲食店。生意非常清淡。大家都在那裏說不景氣。不景氣</p>
<p>我在國内。非必要。不坐汽車。到日本大大的坐汽車。不是出鋒頭。實在價目太便宜了。東京市内。任何街道。隨時有兜生意的汽車。牌上寫明。「市内一圓就是凡在本市以内。不論路的遠近。每坐一次。價只一圓。實際上還只須五十錢。所謂一元。還是門面話</p>
<p>從馬關到東京。車站密極了。大槪十幾分鐘必有一站。每站月臺極長。雖小站。還比我國京滬路上海站要長得多。可是經過的各站。人旣不多。貨更不見。問何以故。都說是不景氣。不景氣。</p>

<h3 id="c293">霍桑探案轉灣（二三） <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 程小靑</p>
<p>他忽作切齒聲道。「埃。這可殺的。害得我好苦。如果被我瞧見。我必拚了性命打他一個半死。」霍桑微笑着答道。「半死太重了罷。打一個對折。也就夠了。—現在你且瞧瞧。那個西裝的男子。你可認識他麽。」那邱奎依了霍桑所指的方向仔細瞧了一瞧。忽搖頭答道。「不認識啊。這個人難道就是—」霍桑止住他道。「好。你再等一等再說。」我暗忖這人明明是那個惡少。邱奎怎說不識。莫非他是果眞同黨。故意推托着麽。</p>
<p>這時那侍者陸續的把菜端送上來。我一邊喫着。一邊偷偷的瞧着對角的一男一女。所以無論烟魚炸肉。送到嘴裏的實在也辨不出什麽滋味。我又悄悄的問霍桑道。「現在我們怎麽辦呢。若使今天再白白的放他過去。我却再認冰住了。」霍桑低聲答道。「你打算怎樣」我道。「我現在實在顧不到法律問題。我準備先出一出氣。打傷了他。受刑事處分。我也願意的。」霍桑又微笑道。「你的理智到那裏去了呢。這舉動也值得麽。你請安心罷。他旣然用了轉灣的方法作弄我們。我們也儘可抄襲一下。如法泡製。你姑且再耐一耐罷。我明知霍桑所說的同樣用轉灣方法對付。一定是要利用那邱奎。不過邱奎旣已不承認認識這人。我們的計劃又何從實施。　正在這時。我見霍桑的目光一閃。急忙從衣袋中摸出了他的錢夾。準備付賬的樣子。他的神情頓時緊張起來。我回頭一瞧。立即查明了那緊張的來由。原來那對角桌上的一對少年男女。都離座起立。那男的先將一件黑絨的斗篷給那女的披上。接着有一個侍者也給這男的穿上了大衣。那大衣正是灰色靑呢。還有方格的條紋。一頂銅盆呢帽。也是深棕色的。和那晚上所見的完全相同。這二人。穿好了衣服。女的在前。男的後隨。便從那玻璃門裏出去。</p>

<p>— 心</p>
<p>我國人對於攝影的藝術一向不很重視、所以在攝影方面終不免落人之後、這是極可悲的現象、近年來似乎比較有人注意了、但他們的目的大都在於美麗底摩登女郎、專攝些這種種美麗的女郎來獲得他們經濟上的利益、他們的目的並不在研究攝影的藝術、而是爲個人物質上的利益而已、</p>
<p>中公攝影研究會是王相秦、曹　濟、謝承炳、唐歐州諸君所組織的、他們對於攝影都極有興趣而且都有了相當的研究、該社成立已有一年多、在這一年當中已經有過很好的成績、他們把平日的攝影成績每星期展覽一次、現在已經展覽過二十幾期了、每期的成績都受了同學的讚美、</p>
<p>最近、他們除將成績在學校展覽之外、爲了要供獻給多數人的鑑賞、所以把他們比較得意的成績在「良友」和「文華」諸畫報上發表、</p>
<p>中國的攝影和西洋太相差遠了、我很希望有志於攝影的朋友多多的努力、非但要趕到西洋的攝影、而且要勝過他們、只要我們肯努务研究、進步是很快的、</p>
<p>最後、我謹以十二萬分的誠意希望中公攝影研究會諸君更加努力、以求深造、同時、希望國内有志於攝影的朋友們尊重藝術、决不要專爲個人的利益而對於一切都置不顧、</p>

<h3 id="e5">Zhu Jia-hua's Brief Remarks <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Zhu Jia-hua stated that the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity, in accordance with the central government's decision and the Sino-British Exchange of Notes, is entirely for railway construction and other productive enterprises, with interest calculated at 5%. This interest will be used to subsidize educational and cultural undertakings. Currently, the various agencies borrowing from the Boxer Indemnity have no concrete plans for the use of the funds. The accumulated funds are still in London, and the unexpired funds have not yet been delivered, so the interest income is not yet available. Furthermore, the accumulated £3 million+ in London must, according to the Exchange of Notes, be entirely handed over to the London Purchasing Commission for the purchase of materials in London. Half of the funds due in the future will be handed over to the London Purchasing Commission, and half will be deposited with the Board of Trustees. The custodians must, in accordance with the central government's decisions, lend the funds to various agencies separately, with interest calculated at 5%. The Board of Trustees will then use the received interest to appropriately distribute the funds according to the standards and principles for subsidizing educational and cultural endeavors. Therefore, at this moment, the Board of Trustees actually does not have a single penny, and it is even more impossible to handle requests for subsidies from various schools and organizations. As for the news reports about the allocation of funds to the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese committees at various universities in London, these are all to resolve what is stipulated in the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Exchange of Notes, allocated from the total amount accumulated in London, and are not decisions of the Board of Trustees, nor are they within the Board's authority.

<p>Both the Danish and Belgian Envoys Are Promising</p>
<p>Beiping, Sources from the diplomatic community report that the position of Dean of the Diplomatic Corps is currently vacant after the Dutch envoy returned to his country.

Therefore, the Belgian and Spanish envoys are the most promising. Although the position has lost its importance in Chinese diplomacy after being denied by foreign ministers, it is still indispensable in handling internal common problems within the diplomatic corps.

<h3 id="e27">Japan's Salary Reduction Trend <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>This salary reduction trend in Japan is not only a matter of the survival of the Japanese cabinet but also concerns the fate of Japan's national future. Why is this so? Because the Japanese Ministry of Finance's revenue shortfall has exceeded a huge 100 million yen, and the military authorities' demands for national defense spending have adamantly refused to be cut. Relief for unemployment and other expenses must also be addressed. Other expenses have already been reduced to the extreme, and there is no other way to raise funds. Therefore, they have been forced to try the salary reduction plan again, even though it has caused hardship. The Japanese government believes that opposition to salary reductions will only come from officials and will not affect other parties. Therefore, even though the previous attempt suffered a major blow, they are still not afraid. However, they do not know that if this opposition trend expands, it will inevitably lead to the paralysis of government affairs. Under this serious situation of economic depression, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not be affected. The spread of ideological problems is also penetrating everywhere. How can they know that others will not see it as an opportunity to incite them? The Japanese government has two major worries: economic depression and ideological problems. Their actions must be extremely cautious, and they must try their best to eliminate anything that can dispel these two worries and never do anything to exacerbate them. However, they did not consider this salary reduction measure thoroughly. Now that the trend is gradually expanding, the Japanese government must maintain its prestige and cannot cancel it again. However, if they do not cancel it, they fear that the situation will become increasingly dangerous. It is truly a dilemma. Whenever anyone in the world encounters a crisis, their response policies will often be risky. The Japanese government's salary reduction strategy is almost a gamble. After this experiment, they will never dare to launch risky strategies lightly again.</p>

Subsequently, Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux presented the report of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference. Finally, the Council approved the questionnaire proposed by the Preparatory Commission. The German representative did not vote. All governments are now requested to submit their armaments inventories by September 15th, reporting only on standing armies and military supplies actually in use. Subsequently, the Council discussed the final case on the agenda, the report on the German minority in Poland. Japanese representative Yoshizawa presented the report, recommending its acceptance. German Foreign Minister Curtius stated that the report was submitted late and had not been studied in detail, proposing to postpone the discussion until the September session. After a lengthy debate, a motion by British Foreign Secretary Henderson to postpone the discussion until September was passed.

<p>Since the outline of the salary reduction plan was decided at the Cabinet meeting and announced, representatives of the Tokyo Railway Bureau staff have met with Railway Minister Eguchi several times, expressing their absolute opposition. The Railway Minister only explained the difficult financial situation of the country and the government's unavoidable reasons for implementing the salary reduction, but to no avail. Now, staff from all lines have scheduled a general meeting on the 24th, which will be attended by 2,000 people. However, the Metropolitan Police Department has been on high alert for this for days.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Ministry of Justice <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Justice Minister Watanabe, standing between the courts and the government, reported the views of the courts at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, requesting that judicial officials be excluded or given special treatment, which was not accepted. If the Cabinet meeting on the 26th, which will make the final decision, does not accept Justice Minister Watanabe's proposal, the Justice Minister may resign, which is unknown. If the Justice Minister does resign, the problem will be even greater, even affecting the fate of the Cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Ministry of Communications <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, high-ranking officials and section chiefs of the Ministry of Communications gathered in the dining hall to discuss methods of opposing the implementation of salary reductions. Meanwhile, Communications Minister Koizumi, the two Vice Ministers, the Participating Official, and the Bureau Directors were also in a separate room discussing ways to suppress it, but without results. A decision to remain neutral.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Ministry of Finance <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, all appointed officials related to the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance submitted a petition to Finance Minister Inoue opposing the salary reduction. The Finance Minister sternly ordered Tax Bureau Chief Aoki to engage in suppression. Although the surface is calm, the opposition movement is expanding.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The salary allowance for officials working at embassies and legations abroad related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is 4 million yen, about twice the base salary. If the salary reduction plan is applied, the salaries of diplomats will be the same as those of Spain and Chile, and Japan's prestige cannot be maintained. Therefore, senior officials in the ministry requested Foreign Minister Shidehara to only reduce the base salary and not reduce the overseas allowance. (Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Dentsu News Agency <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The government announced the outline of the salary reduction plan because the opposition movement in various provinces was quite fierce and feared that it would have a major impact on society. Therefore, it first announced the outline to test public sentiment. If the opposition movement calms down, the final decision will be made on the 26th. If it worsens again, there will be room for consideration.</p>

<p>Although the government has only decided on the outline of the salary reduction plan and has not yet formally decided to reduce salaries, things have come to this point, and the salary reduction plan cannot be withdrawn. In order to fill the deficit, salary reduction is absolutely necessary. Therefore, the Cabinet meeting on the 26th will still make a decisive decision. As for the problem of Justice Minister Watanabe's resignation and the social problems caused by other opposition movements in the Ministry of Railways, they cannot be ignored. If a major incident is caused by the forced salary reduction, not only will Railway Minister Eguchi's resignation be an issue, but it will also be a fatal blow to the entire Cabinet. The Japanese government is therefore in a dilemma, and the salary reduction plan has now become a major political issue.</p>

<p>This morning, editorials in major newspapers all focused on the government's salary reduction. The consensus was that the salary reduction would cause opposition or lead to the downfall of the cabinet. Since the news of the salary reduction spread, there have been complaints everywhere. The police are afraid that someone will harm the Finance Minister, so the Finance Minister has been accompanied by special police riding motorcycles in and out of the area in recent days. The police station has also been strictly preventing extremist elements from taking the opportunity to act. Recently, people in the market have been selling stocks of large stores and film companies, causing prices to fall sharply. This is obviously due to the authorities' intention to reduce salaries. Merchants are now quite anxious, fearing that various stocks will be affected sooner or later. It is said that railway personnel are now raising funds to prepare for an anti-salary reduction movement.</p>

<p>Public opinion on salary reduction is generally as follows: Bankers are unwilling to express their views because Finance Minister Inoue has asked for their support, but they oppose it in their hearts. As for whether banks will follow the government's salary reduction, they believe that companies do not have redundant personnel and expenses like government agencies, and salary reduction is not possible in terms of efficiency, but they will consider pay raises. If the government does not force them to reduce salaries, the Bank of Japan will adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Nippon Yusen Vice President Otani said that since the private sector has already been reorganized, government officials should reduce salaries. Tokyo Stock Exchange Chairman Okazaki Kuniomi said that in view of the current situation, both government and the people should be patient. Oji Paper President Fujiwara Ginjiro said that salary reduction for government officials affects people's hearts and should be absolutely opposed.</p>

<p>The King of Belgium met with leaders of various political parties today to discuss ways to resolve the political crisis. The current situation in the Cabinet is that no one can form a majority without the support of the Liberal Party. Former Prime Minister Theunis cannot reorganize the cabinet because of the strong opposition from the Liberal Party. Politicians have widely promoted former Prime Minister Poullet, but Poullet is also opposed by the Liberal Party because he has always expressed sympathy for the Flemish autonomy faction. However, many parties believe that the current cabinet crisis is actually impossible to resolve and will inevitably lead to the dissolution of Parliament. However, at a time when the Flemish issue is thorny, the election competition will be fierce. Therefore, all parties are still trying to avoid this path.</p>

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Deputy Commander Zhang arrived in Tianjin by Ford aircraft from Beijing at 9:45 am on the 20th. Those who accompanied him were Zhu Guangmu, Ye Biliang, Wu Taihun, Huang Xiansheng, Advisor Iyagu, Adjutant Tan Hai, and two sons, as well as two guards. The plane arrived in Tianjin at 2:10 pm and landed at the British Racecourse. The Public Security Bureau had previously dispatched more than 40 plainclothes detectives to guard the landing site. Provincial Government Chairman Wang Shuchang and Tianjin Mayor Zhang Xueming rushed back to Tianjin from Peiping that morning to welcome him. In addition to Zhang and Wang, those who came to welcome him included Han Linsheng, Ning Xiangnan, Zou Shangyou, and others. After getting off the plane, Zhang rested briefly there and then returned to his private residence at No. 17, 1st Special District. According to Zhu Guangmu's statement, "The Deputy Commander took off from Beijing at 9:45 am. The weather was excellent and he was very comfortable in the air. This trip reduced the time by one hour compared to the last time he entered Beijing. Chairman Chiang personally sent him to the airport from the Central Party Headquarters this morning. The relationship between Chiang and Zhang is harmonious. The Guangdong incident is still being politically resolved. There is absolutely nothing wrong in the North. When the Deputy Commander will go to Peiping has not yet been determined. Because the special train is in Pukou, it will not return until 2:00 pm this (20th) afternoon. Or wait for the train to arrive and then decide. Otherwise, it is not known whether he will fly to Peiping within days. After Deputy Commander Zhang arrived in Tianjin, he went to visit his two younger brothers to meet his family and did not return to his residence to see guests. The municipal construction in Nanjing is very successful. Mrs. Zhang is now going to Shanghai for a short trip and will return north in three or two days." Yu Xuezhong, Liu Yifei, Bao Yu, and others also rushed from Peiping to meet Zhang. It is heard that Zhang intends to go to Peiping during the day and then return to Shenyang. (21st)</p>
<p>Tianjin Chamber of Commerce Firmly Rejects Production and Sales Tax</p>
<p>All Industries Stop Transporting Goods</p>
<p>The Special Office Sets Up a Special Bureau to Collect Taxes on Sugar</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Special Commissioner's Office of Finance of Hebei Province has decided to start collecting the special product sales tax from today (21st). Because of the urgency of the situation, the relevant businesses in Tianjin held an emergency meeting of various industries yesterday (20th) convened by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. More than 20 representatives attended. Chairman Wang Wendian first reported the significance of the meeting, saying that the production and sales tax will be implemented tomorrow (21st), which is of great concern to various industries. Please discuss in detail how you will deal with it. After discussion, everyone felt that the market has been in decline in recent years, business has been depressed, and various industries have been struggling to maintain. If they add more burdens, it would be tantamount to sitting and accepting destruction. Moreover, the production and sales tax is only implemented in Hebei Province, and the impact will be even more unknown. It was immediately decided that the general merchandise, sugar, paint and pigments, candy, leather goods, porcelain merchants, foreign paper, bamboo and wood, yarn mills, sauce industry, Sanjin flour mills, weaving and dyeing industry, rope and hemp industry, and other 18 industries would go to the Hebei Provincial Bank to plead with Special Commissioner Jing Youyan to forward to the Central Government to postpone the tax collection. Chen Chuxiang, Tu Zhenchu, Bao Zhusan, Gao Dianqing, Zhao Hanqing, Pi Huanchen, Liang Yanchen, Yue Jingwu, Wang Yulin, Li Runtian, and others were appointed to gather at the Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 am today (21st) to petition the Municipal Party Department. Until a clear answer is obtained, all industries will stop transporting goods so that the production and sales tax cannot be collected. A joint meeting will be held at 4:00 pm today to discuss the final response.</p>
<p>Since the Hebei Province special commodity production and sales tax has been decided to be implemented, the special consumption tax that had already been ordered by the Central Government to be suspended will be suspended from 8:00 pm yesterday (20th). Tianjin is the second tax zone for production and sales tax. It was originally planned to set up two district tax bureaus and three inspection offices. The number of inspection sub-offices has not yet been determined and will be decided based on the severity of the region. However, it is feared that the two district tax bureaus planned for Tianjin will not meet the demand. Jing Youyan has approved that since Tianjin has a large amount of sugar commodities entering and exiting the country, it has been decided to set up another bureau to separately collect the sugar production and sales tax. The remaining fur, mountain goods, fruits, cotton and hemp, bean seeds, timber and its products, paper, medicinal materials, tea, seafood, textiles, porcelain, paint, glue wax, and other goods will be collected by the other two bureaus and various inspection offices. When the tax paid by various goods reaches 10 yuan, they must go to the district bureau to pay. Although scattered goods for personal use are tax-exempt, those whose import and export tax collection amount is above two angles must pay taxes according to regulations, which is more harsh and detailed than the consumption tax. All Hebei Province unified tax inspection offices are required to assist in the duty of inspection and verification due to the articles of the organization regulations of the production and sales tax bureau, in order to save expenses and the regulation of no inspection offices. One production and sales tax district bureau is located at Da Hongqiao, which is the original site of the former Fourth Unified Tax Bureau. One is located at the East Railway Station, which is the original office site of the former Cotton and Dried Fruit Tax Bureau at No. 5, 3rd Jing Road, 3rd Special District. The sugar production and sales tax bureau will still be located at the original location. In addition, various important land and water locations in Tianjin have also been approved by the Special Commissioner's Office to set up several inspection offices to strictly collect taxes.

<h3 id="e79">Shi Yousan Telegraphed His Father to Refute Rumors <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Support to the End, Absolutely No Problem</p>
<p>Instructed to Stay in Shenyang, Do Not Move Lightly</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The rumor that Shi Yousan's troops of the Third Route Army moved to Tulu spread widely a month ago, which was considered strange by all parties. After the facts proved to be incorrect, Shi himself sent a separate telegram to clarify the truth. Deputy Commander Zhang also went to Beijing at that time to attend the National Assembly, and the rumors subsided. By the time the Guangdong mutiny occurred this month, rumors about the actions of Shi's troops arose again. Yesterday, the reporter met with a friend who had just arrived in Shenyang from Shunde and talked about the cause of the rumors about Shi's troops. It is said that one reason was that Shi's troops stationed in the county planned to build ditches and dams a month ago to prevent floods. However, because the project was huge and required a large amount of money, they had no choice but to negotiate with the local government to agree to use soldiers instead of workers. This is the origin of the saying that Shi's troops were digging trenches for military purposes in the defense zone. The second reason was that the central government was nervous about suppressing the Communists, and a certain central army stationed in central Henan was ordered to be transferred, which led to the misunderstanding that Shi's troops were being transferred. The third reason was that Shi invested 130,000 yuan in the Shenyang Concession District 6th Wei Road a year ago to purchase a private residence and set up the Liaoning Office of the 13th Route Army, which was for the convenience of contacting military affairs with the Northeast Army Border Defense Commander-in-Chief Office. In addition to appointing Bi Guangyuan as the director of the Liaoning Office, Shi's father also often resided in Shenyang to assist him. After the establishment of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office in Beiping, the contact matters of Shi's troops were transferred to the Deputy Office. In fact, Shi had no need to set up an office in Shenyang. However, because Deputy Commander Zhang spent more time in Shenyang than in Peiping, in addition to setting up an office in Beiping, the Liaoning Office continued to exist as usual. When Shi was not in Shenyang, his father stayed in Shenyang and directly contacted the Border Defense Command when necessary. The rumor that the office was cancelled is absolutely untrue. After Deputy Commander Zhang entered Beijing to attend the National Assembly, there were no differences with the Central Government. North China and Northeast China under the leadership of Deputy Commander Zhang have issued a telegram supporting peaceful unification in response to the Guangdong mutiny. Shi Yousan also sent a telegram from Shunde to Jiang Province Chairman Wan Fulin and Border Defense Chief of Staff Rong Zhen in Shenyang to his father. The original text is as follows: "Limited to immediate arrival, 萬"</p>
<p>Chairman, Director Rong, please translate to Shi's old master, I, Han, am grateful for Deputy Commander's special knowledge and love. I will definitely support it to the end, and there will be no other problems. However, there are various rumors outside that are deliberately provoking, which is infuriating. At this time, I pray that you will still live in Shenyang and not move lightly, so as to dispel rumors. I will not fail to pray for it. Yours truly, Shi Yousan, Xiaoyin Yi (May 19th)</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Proposed</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Price of Redeeming the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Requires 1.8 Billion Gold Rubles</p>
<p>Said to Be Based on the Railway Yearbook for the Past Few Years</p>
<p>North China Daily News, Harbin Correspondence: The situation of the Sino-Russian negotiations rumored in Harbin, whether true or not, is worthy of attention regarding the price of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The news about the Sino-Russian Conference in the Harbin newspapers is prohibited from being published, but news continues to come from travelers from Vladivostok and Moscow, and we began to know the reason. When the Chinese representatives asked the Russian side for the price of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Russian side proposed a shocking number, that is, it needs 1,800,000,000 gold rubles. The Chinese representatives were greatly surprised and replied how this number could be a problem. Soviet Russia then presented a book, namely "Statistics of the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1930", which was printed in Chinese. The price of the Eastern Railway recorded in the book is the number mentioned above. If so, this number was originally recognized by the Chinese side. The Chinese representatives then claimed that they needed to ask the National Government for instructions, and adjourned the meeting to the 14th of this month, and at the same time telegraphed Harbin to investigate the details. However, in fact, this number has existed for many years, and it has been reprinted in the yearbook every year. The Chinese side seems to have never paid attention to the number of the price of the railway, which is equivalent to admitting it. If they want to reduce the number now, they must find another way to persuade Soviet Russia to accept it. In addition to the above-mentioned railway price issue, Soviet Russia also put forward many requirements: (1) If the railway is purchased by the Chinese side, it must be guaranteed that no White Russian will be used as railway staff; (2) Russian goods passing through Manchuria must be subject to special tax rates; (3) Russian ships have the right to load grains in Chinese ports in the Amur River and the Iman River and the lower reaches of the Songhua River; (4) The Chinese side shall not borrow foreign capital to purchase the railway; (5) The Russian staff on the railway will not be removed before the payment of the railway purchase money.</p>
<p>From the economic point of view of Soviet Russia, even if the Chinese side pays 1,000,000,000 gold rubles, Soviet Russia has already taken a great advantage. The lease term of the Eastern Railway is only 25 years left, and the railway's business in the next 25 years will inevitably decline more than before. The annual income will not exceed 15 million gold rubles at most, and the total will be only 400 million gold rubles in 25 years. However, the railway helps Soviet Russia's production and sales, and also helps Soviet Russia's power in other aspects. This value should also be added to the price.</p>
<p>In short, the total profit that Soviet Russia can obtain from the Chinese Eastern Railway in the next 25 years is only one-fifth of the price recorded in the Chinese Chinese Eastern Railway Yearbook. However, Soviet Russia will certainly not admit its actual price and sell it at a price lower than the price recognized by the Chinese side. As a result of a kind of negligence, the Chinese side is in a difficult position in the negotiations.</p>
<p>This negotiation will obviously be extended, and the result may be a breakdown, which is also unknown. Soviet Russia is prepared for this. If its five-year plan is successful, its large factories and new equipment can be turned into military use at any time. Supplying Soviet Russia with various important industrial equipment today not only creates a competitor for themselves, but also makes it possible for them to become the country with the best military equipment in the world.

<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Sino-Japanese specialized committee for the Sino-Japanese negotiations of the Eastern Province Railway has now been appointed. Japanese Director Kimura went to Jilin to investigate and has now completed the matter. After passing through Shenyang, he returned to Dalian to prepare everything. As soon as Traffic Committee Chairman Gao Jiyi returns to Shenyang from Beijing, the negotiations can be formally opened. According to the traffic industry, the date of the meeting has been set for the end of this month. However, due to the complexity of the issues, the negotiation period will take at least a year and a half to complete. The Liaoning Provincial National Diplomacy Association recently stated that since this negotiation is closely related to our country's interests and is also a matter of life and death for our Eastern Province people, it is rumored that the Japanese side is planning to carry out various activities to support the negotiation. Our side must make corresponding preparations. It has been decided to convene an emergency meeting in a day or two to discuss countermeasures and warn our negotiators that they must conduct revolutionary diplomacy and that the meeting should be absolutely open, etc. (May 19th)</p>

Due to the importance of Hunan's defense, he took the postal flight from Nanjing to Hankou on the 22nd, and then transferred to a special train on the Hunan-Hubei Railway to return to Hunan. He arrived in Hankou at 2 p.m., crossed the river and boarded the train at 3 p.m., and departed south at 4 p.m. It is estimated that he will arrive in Changsha at 7 a.m. on the 23rd. What He Jian said to the visitors in Hankou can be summarized into five points: (1) This time, the central government, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, convened a National Conference to plan the construction of the country and complete the important tasks during the period of political tutelage. After the opening of the conference, all the resolutions were the most urgent needs of the people of the whole country. From now on, we only hope that the entire nation will work together to promote their implementation to consolidate national unity and enhance international status. (2) Regarding the important issues of Hunan Province, such as military, political, educational, and financial matters, he has already reported them to Chairman Jiang and requested special assistance. He has obtained the understanding of Chairman Jiang and the Ministry of Finance, who promised to provide appropriate assistance within their capabilities. (3) The large groups of Red Bandits in Hunan Province have been successively defeated, and the scattered bandits are also being cleared up. Now, they are engaged in self-government, organizing defense corps, conducting household registration, implementing the Baojia system, and implementing rural clearance for a permanent solution. (4) The central government is determined to resolve the Guangdong and Guangxi problems with political means and does not want to suffer from war again. There are many enlightened people in Guangdong who should be able to understand the central government's intentions. In the event that those who love chaos undermine unity, they will be subject to military sanctions and will not affect the overall situation. (5) A small part of the Guangxi army recently advanced to Quanzhou, which is more than 200 miles away from the border of Hunan. It is rumored that they have reached the border of Hunan, which is absolutely not true. (May 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Case of the Xianghe Steamer Sinking the Chinese Steamer <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Hunan Provincial Government Sends Personnel for Negotiation</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Attempts to Evade Responsibility with Clever Words</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: On the 6th of this month, the Japanese steamer Xiangjiang collided with the Chinese merchant steamer Taishun in the Xiang River below Zhaoshan, drowning passengers and sinking goods, a very tragic situation. Public opinion in Hunan Province is extremely indignant. The case is currently being negotiated by personnel sent by the Hunan Provincial Government. The details of the incident and the negotiation are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e85">Details of the Incident <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese merchant steamer Taishun loaded passengers and goods from Xiangtan to Changsha on May 6th. At 5 a.m., when it arrived in the river below Zhaoshan, it encountered the Japanese Xiangjiang steamer heading upstream. The Xiangjiang steamer did not sound its whistle and rushed forward at high speed. The downstream Taishun steamer was unable to avoid it due to the urgent situation. The Xiangjiang steamer rammed into the Taishun's front section, destroying the accounting room and steering room, causing it to sink instantly. Passengers and goods were lost in the water, and the cries for help were extremely tragic. The owner of the Taishun steamer reported it to the water police headquarters, who forwarded it to the provincial government for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Investigation <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>After the incident occurred, the Steamer Association immediately sent members Cao Xiangjie and Li Xinquan, together with Tu Huilie, an official from the Changsha Customs, and Guo Hongnian, a patrol officer from the Fifth Water Police Brigade, on a special steamer to investigate the site of the sunken steamer, and invited photography experts to take pictures. According to the report from the Steamer Association, on the 6th of this month, the Chinese steamer Taishun was sailing from Xiangtan to Zhaoshan, following the regulations by staying close to the east bank along the Muyun Market. They saw the Japanese steamer Xiangjiang also speeding downstream from the east bank (according to regulations, downstream traffic should stay on the west bank). The Taishun steamer sounded its whistle, but the Xiangjiang steamer did not respond and approached rapidly. The Taishun immediately tried to avoid the collision, but due to being close to the river bank, there was no room to maneuver, and it was violently rammed by the Xiangjiang, causing the hull to break immediately. Seeing that the water was deep at the site of the incident, and in order to save lives, they had to rush to the sandbar of Xingmazhou on the opposite west bank, hoping that the shallow water would prevent the entire steamer from sinking to the bottom. However, by the time they reached the opposite bank, the water had already flooded in, and the steamer sank. It was the fault of the Xiangjiang steamer: first, it went the wrong way, downstream traffic should not be on the east side; second, the Taishun steamer sounded its whistle repeatedly, but the Xiangjiang steamer did not respond and continued forward, causing the disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Indignation from All Sectors <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>After the Taishun steamer was sunk, all sectors expressed indignation. In addition to the Provincial Steering Committee already sending a letter to the Provincial Government requesting serious negotiations, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Shipping Association, and various public law organizations also submitted petitions to the Provincial Government, forwarding letters to the Japanese Consul ordering the Nisshin Steamship Company (the owner of the Xiangjiang steamer) to fully compensate for the losses, provide generous compensation to the families of the victims, and guarantee that such incidents would not happen again in the future, in order to safeguard national rights and value human life.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Negotiation <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>After the Provincial Government received reports from all parties, it ordered the Diplomatic Secretary Yang Xuancheng to be responsible for the negotiation. Yang immediately met with the Japanese Consul, Tsuguya Komei, for preliminary negotiations. However, the Japanese side, citing the report from the Xiangjiang steamer, stated that the Taishun steamer was damaged at the bow, and the side of the Xiangjiang steamer also had damage, seemingly implying that the Taishun rammed directly into the Xiangjiang steamer. However, they stated that the Nisshin Company (the owner of the Xiangjiang steamer) could be instructed to compensate for the losses suffered by the Taishun steamer. The Provincial Government must wait for the reports from the Changsha Customs and the Water Police Headquarters before serious negotiations can be conducted. However, according to a thorough investigation, the bow of the Xiangjiang steamer is streamlined, with both sides of the front protruding, which can bear the force. The bow of the Taishun steamer, although pointed and bare, was therefore rammed into the protruding parts on both sides of the Xiangjiang steamer. Furthermore, the Xiangjiang steamer is very large, and the force of the collision was like Mount Tai pressing an egg. Now, the Japanese side is using the trace of the Xiangjiang's bow being damaged as an excuse. For example, if two people A and B are fighting, and A breaks B's chest and causes death, while B only has slight injuries on his shoulder, would B be responsible for causing A's death during sentencing? Moreover, the Japanese company, Nakajima Yoko, has a letter proving that the Taishun and its passengers were sunk head-on by the Xiangjiang, and there is indeed a hole pierced on the right side of the Taishun steamer. Based on this judgment, the Japanese steamer Xiangjiang should undoubtedly be held responsible for the damage and compensation for the sinking of the Taishun. (May 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Han Lingbao's Suppression Troops Return to Defense <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Leaving Troops in Qufu, Sishui and Fei Counties</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong army's suppression of bandits in southern Shandong has lasted for more than two months. The large groups of bandits in Mengshan and Baodu Mountain have long been defeated. Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju returned to Jinan from Nanjing yesterday. Since the Baodu Mountain bandits have been cleared and there is no need to station a large army, he immediately dispatched his special train and requested two trains from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to transport Gu Liangmin's directly subordinate troops of the 22nd Division back to Jinan from Xi County to station in northern Shandong. The remaining suppression troops were ordered to return to their original defense positions. However, Fei County has long been a den of bandits, and Qufu and Sishui are close to Mengshan, so a regiment of Chen Yaohan's 58th Division was left to defend Fei County to suppress bandits. Two regiments of Tang Yaoxun's 65th Brigade of the 22nd Division were stationed in Qufu, and one regiment was stationed in Sishui, so that they could advance to suppress the remaining bandits in Mengshan as circumstances warranted. Gu Liangmin led the special service battalion of the division back to Jinan last night (21st), disembarked at Xinzhuang, and stationed in Xi County. Liu Shuxiang, the chief of staff of the 3rd Route Army stationed in Xi County, led the personnel stationed in Teng County from the Eight Departments and arrived in Jinan on Gu's military train, immediately reporting everything to Han Fuju.</p>
<p>Recently, the Third Route Army's Staff Office in Teng County sent a telegram reporting the situation of the army's suppression of bandits, which is recorded below. Telegram 1: (1) According to Division Commander Gu Liangmin's telegraph, relayed from Brigade Commander Tang's report, Regiment Commander Kong led his troops to Nanbolin at noon, and cooperated with the militia to suppress the bandits of Wang Jiapu in Huangya Dongling. There were more than a thousand bandits. After four hours of fierce fighting and artillery fire, the bandits were defeated and fled to Mengshan. It is estimated that more than 50 bandits were killed, and dozens of kidnapped people were rescued and sent away. Regiment Commander Xue searched the Qingshan area a few days ago, and there were no traces of bandits in the mountains. (2) According to Wang Wanqing's telegraph, it is roughly the same as the report from Regiment Commander Kong. (3) According to Brigade Commander Ma's telegraph, Regiment Commander Ma of the 1st Regiment searched a mountain cave near Maojiazhai yesterday and found five hidden bandits and five guns. The bandits have been executed. According to reports, the other regiments have no bandits. (4) Except for telegramming Wang Wanqing to lead his troops to cooperate with Kong's regiment in the suppression efforts, and telegramming Brigade Commander Ma and Brigade Commander Tang to strictly search and suppress without slackening, I respectfully inform you. Telegram 2: (1) According to Division Commander Gu's telegraph, Kang's regiment searched for hidden bandits at noon today and advanced to Xingyu. They suddenly encountered more than 300 defeated bandits and immediately attacked them fiercely. The bandits were defeated and fled to Zhuwo. The Gaogiao militia surrounded the area south of Taishanling and intercepted the bandits, who turned south. Three 82mm mortars, more than a dozen hostages, and more than 30 bandits were captured. (2) In addition to ordering Brigade Commander Tang to strictly search and suppress, Chen's division and Ma's brigade were ordered to intercept and not let them escape. (May 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Coal Merchants on the Jiaoji Railway Go on Strike <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Increase in Freight Rates on the Jiaoji Railway</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Coal mine merchants in Zichuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu, Weixian, and other places along the Jiaoji Railway went on strike yesterday (20th) due to the increase in freight rates on the Jiaoji Railway, causing a panic in fuel supply along the line, and the price of coal soared. The coal merchants on the Jiaoji Railway have long considered the freight rates to be higher than other railways. Now that the coal industry is in recession, the freight rates have been increased again, and the freight rebates that were given to coal merchants in the summer in previous years have been cancelled, which is tantamount to putting domestic coal merchants to death. Representatives have been repeatedly elected to request exemption from the increase, but without result. Therefore, on the 13th, the Zibo Zhangwei Coal Mine Association was organized, and it was unanimously decided to go on strike on the 20th of this month and to appeal to all parties. The Agriculture and Mines Bureau considered the matter to be important and has reported it to the Provincial Government for instructions. However, according to those who have investigated the situation of coal merchants, the coal in Zibo, Boshan, Zhangqiu, and Weixian is transported to Qingdao and Jinan at the farthest. The current cost is only ten yuan per ton, but the coal merchants sell it for fifteen yuan, or even twenty yuan per ton. Last winter, it was sold for thirty yuan. On average, one million tons of coal are sold every year, and coal users have lost more than ten million yuan. Therefore, the coal merchants' actions this time are purely to compete with the Jiaoji Railway for profits, and coal users have no benefit to speak of. The coal merchants' telegram is attached below: "We believe that coal is the driving force of industry and commerce and a necessity for people's daily life. All countries actively promote the increase in coal production and reduce freight rates, all because they are related to the foundation of the country, which cannot be ignored. Moreover, coal is a coarse commodity, and freight accounts for the largest part of its cost. The Ministry of Railways previously proposed that freight rates should not be increased for essential commodities, which clearly shows its intention to protect industry and pay attention to people's livelihood. Unexpectedly, the Jiaoji Railway revised the freight rates last year, incorporating the temporary 20% surcharge into the actual price. Now, during the period when the reduced price of 10% has been implemented for years, there is a sudden increase of 20%, which is an increase of more than 40% in two years. Merchants and people are shocked. According to the rates of various railways, such as Pingpu, Beining, and Pinghan, the freight rate for coal is generally five or six cents per ton-mile, while the original freight rate on the Jiaoji Railway was as high as one cent and three cents per ton-mile. They are all national railways, but the difference in rates is more than double. This kind of unequal treatment has already put Shandong coal in a difficult situation. Suddenly increasing the price and cancelling the summer rebates imposes a heavy burden, which is unbearable. Merchants and people have repeatedly appealed without success. The Jiaoji Railway is ignorant of the commercial situation and has reported to the Ministry of Railways that the price increase is harmless, disregarding tens of thousands of miners and hundreds of millions of lives along the line. How can it be exported to compete with foreign coal? It seems that this hinders industry and disregards people's livelihood. It is harmful to merchants and not beneficial to the railway. In one fell swoop, the railway and merchants are in trouble. We don't know how they can bear to do this. Now, due to unbearable poverty, we have no way to support ourselves. We have no choice but to convene a public conference of workers in the coal mining industry in Zibo, Zhangqiu, and Weifang in eastern Shandong and unanimously decided to temporarily suspend business on the 21st of this month to await further orders. We sincerely request that you maintain and help us, telegraph to the Jiaoji Railway, and restore the old regulations as soon as possible, so as to maintain the foundation of the country and value people's livelihood. The Shandong Weibo Zhangwei Coal Mining Industry Federation respectfully kowtows and awaits orders." (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Reasons for Stagnation of Huayang River Project <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Funding Issues Still Being Discussed</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Huayang River dredging project is related to the water conservancy of seven counties belonging to the provinces of Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Although it has been repaired many times, it has not been completed due to various obstacles. Previously, the Ministry of Interior consulted the Anhui Provincial Government, in accordance with the request of People's Representative Cao Shutang, to allocate funds equally from the beneficiary fields, and to consult with the Hubei and Jiangxi Provincial Governments to handle the matter. The Anhui Provincial Government ordered the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments to propose a proper plan and submit it for review and decision. The departments then proposed that the three provincial governments should allocate funds to set up a surveying office to measure the area and topography of the lakes on the left bank of the Yangtze River, the river basins, and the rainfall, flow rate, and flow velocity. After the survey is completed and the plan is completed, the labor costs will be shared by the beneficiary fields, so that the matter will be practical, and it will be different from estimating out of thin air and rashly ordering the people to bear the burden. Based on this, the Anhui Provincial Government separately consulted the Hubei and Jiangxi Provincial Governments, requesting verification and reply. Yesterday, the reply from the Hubei Provincial Government was approved, stating that it is now financially exhausted and it is difficult to carry out surveying. It proposed to approve the request of the representatives to jointly establish a method by the beneficiary owners and gentry of the three provinces and seven counties. The Jiangxi Provincial Government generally agreed with the method proposed by Anhui Province. The Anhui Provincial Government considered that the opinions of the two provinces were inconsistent and it would be difficult to implement at present. However, as the matter concerns the water conservancy of the three provinces, it had to be further planned. It ordered the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments to propose a compromise method and submit it for review and transfer. Therefore, the project had to be temporarily suspended. (May 23rd)</p>

<p>The Songyi Slaughter Tax was originally contracted by Sheng Jing, with an annual tax amount of 16,500 yuan. The one-year term expired on March 20th of this year. Later, the contractor Wang Mou recognized an increase in the tax amount of 10% to the Nanjing Education Fund Management Office, for a total of 18,151 yuan and one dime. After Wang Mou recognized the contract, he has not officially taken over. Chief Liu ordered Sheng Shang to continue to collect taxes and maintain the status quo until the new merchant Wang Mou officially takes over.</p>

<p>After the execution of Taihu bandit leader Taibao Ashu, his followers regrouped and committed crimes in various places along Taihu Lake. The Suzhou Civil Affairs Office has ordered the military, police, and security agencies in the lakeside counties to quickly dispatch large teams to suppress the bandits. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 22nd, a large gang of more than a hundred bandits raided Hengjing in Suzhou, and traces of bandits were also found in Yishan. Shen, the head of the third district of the Water Security Bureau here, received a long-distance telephone report on the morning of the 23rd and immediately dispatched eight gunboats, towed by the Zhenwei cruiser, to Jiapu Bridge to intercept them. At the same time, he telegraphed Xu Boying, the captain of the 14th team, to command the ship of the 12th and 14th teams and assemble at Jiapu Bridge (Jiapu Bridge is located near Yishan Township at the junction of Wujiang and Wuxian) for a large-scale search and suppression. The County Police also dispatched teams to assist.</p>

<p>Chen Leng, a local woman from Shunjiang Township in Zhenjiang County, hired bricklayers such as Shen Laosi to work at her home during the construction of her house in October of the eighteenth year. Unexpectedly, Shen stole materials while working at the Chen's house. Chen Leng discovered this and ordered the local security guard Jin to search Shen Laosi's house and recover the original items. Shen Laosi was fined four yuan. Shen held a grudge and colluded with Zhang Heden, who knew about the case, on December 3rd of the same year to murder Chen Leng and sink her body in a pond with a cloth bag. Later, the deceased's daughter Chen discovered this and reported it to the Zhenjiang District Court's Prosecutor's Office, which verified the facts and arrested Shen. Shen was sentenced to death. Shen did not accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, but his appeal was rejected. On the 22nd, the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court presented the case to the Ministry of Justice for approval and ordered the Prosecutor's Office of the Higher Court to execute the sentence according to law. After receiving the order, the Prosecutor's Office of the Higher Court extracted Shen Laosi at 8 a.m. yesterday (23rd), verified his identity, and executed him by hanging at the Third Branch Prison's execution ground.</p>

<p>A long-distance telephone report stated that at 9 a.m. on the 23rd, more than 20 bandit ships with more than 300 bandits swarmed ashore from Puyuan Town, Tongxiang County, Zhejiang, robbed the entire town, and kidnapped five hostages. Later, the bandits fled to Yanmu in Suzhou, where the Xiangfeng small steamer from Pinghu to Zhenze happened to be passing by and was also extensively robbed. Five female hostages were kidnapped (one was a female teacher Wang Zhongli, one was Mrs. Ni Qinru, the instructor of the Wujiang Sericulture Cooperative, one was the daughter of Ma Guilong, who lived in Yanmu, and the others were not known). After the robbery, the bandit ships fled in disorder to the Sitinzi area of Wujiang.

<p>The Wuxi Sericulture Association received a telegram from the County Chamber of Commerce forwarding a telegram from the Department of Finance, stating that business tax should be collected on the cocoon industry uniformly. At the same time, it also approved the Construction Bureau's transfer of Ni Chunrong, a supervisor sent by the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office, to Wuxi to supervise the collection. The matter was discussed at the Executive Committee meeting. It was argued that the regulations and outlines for the collection of business tax on the cocoon industry, as well as the supplementary measures, were contradictory. The cocoon industry in Wuxi all opened according to the Jiangsu Province Cocoon Industry Regulations and paid the fees first and then paid taxes annually. According to Article 21 of the regulations and Article 11 of the supplementary measures, those who have paid the intermediary tax will have their intermediary tax renamed as business tax, and of course, they will no longer pay tax. Moreover, the cocoon industries in Wuxi are all local silk factories that entrust intermediaries to collect and dry cocoons, which are purely intermediary in nature and should be exempt from business tax. It was requested to exempt them from taxation in accordance with the regulations to maintain the law and show great faith. The County Chamber of Commerce was immediately asked to telegraph the Finance Department to provide prompt relief to maintain the law and show great faith.</p>

On the 19th, he ordered Inspector Wang Wenzhong and employee Chen Fusheng to lead police to Huang Wantong's opium den outside the North Gate. They arrested Huang Zuyin, the owner of the small opium den, and seized opium paraphernalia at the home of Dr. Jiang Benli near Tongxing Lane. Subsequently, a member of the Chamber of Commerce interceded, and Huang Zuyin paid 300 yuan, while Jiang Benli paid 100 yuan to settle the case. On the 22nd, County Magistrate Li learned of this and immediately ordered legal police officer Liu Xiangting to arrest both Huang and Jiang outside the North Gate. While they were resting in the Chamber of Commerce, some people wanted to find a way to ease the situation to avoid complications, but County Magistrate Li refused. In the evening, both Huang and Jiang were taken to the county government, where Judge Wu Cheng interrogated them behind closed doors in an inner room for a long time before ordering them to leave. Judge Wu Cheng then went to Yiyuan to attend a banquet held by the Relief Institute for County Magistrate Li. At the county government gate, he asked Huang and Jiang, "Did you disclose anything you confessed just now to anyone outside?" They replied that they had not. Wu said, "If there is any leakage, you will be responsible." It is unknown what the final outcome will be.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhuohe from Hunan has recently been using counterfeit ten-yuan banknotes from a certain bank to purchase goods and receive change in silver dollars in Zhenjiang. Yesterday, Huaxin Shoe Store detected the counterfeit and reported it to the police, who arrested him. Several counterfeit banknotes were found on his person. Upon hearing the news, various defrauded businesses went to identify the suspect and reported to the Public Security Bureau. The bureau transferred Zhou to the court. Zhou's testimony was evasive, and he insisted that he borrowed the banknotes from a friend and did not know they were counterfeit. The court has dispatched officers to investigate the details with each defrauded business to determine the verdict.</p>

<p>In the eastern townships of this county, the weather turned suddenly cold after the third sleep of the silkworms during this silkworm season, coupled with continuous rain.

<p>In Puyuan Town, at the border of Jiaxing and Tongxiang, around 5 AM on the 23rd, dozens of bandit ships suddenly arrived with over a hundred bandits, all armed with guns. They swarmed ashore, first looting the firearms of the stationed water police, the Jiaxing-Tongxiang Public Security Bureau branches, and the local defense corps. After killing one police officer from the Public Security Bureau, they began looting various businesses separately. None of the medium-sized or larger businesses were spared. Around 8 AM, they began to loot and escaped towards Xincheng. By the time the military and police officials in Hecheng received the news, they immediately telegraphed the commander of the Third District Water Police and the mobile patrol team stationed in Zhouquan to block all the main roads, but the bandits had already fled far away. It is reported that the Gongyi Pawnshop suffered the greatest losses among the looted businesses, while gold shops and cloth stores also suffered substantial losses.</p>

<p>Xia Zhenwen, the director of Jiaxing Hospital, was invited to see a patient at No. 16 Xieqiao Street in the south of the city the day before yesterday. However, upon arriving, there was no patient there, only a woman and two young men. After Dr. Xia went upstairs, the two young men demanded a loan of two thousand yuan from Xia. When Xia said he had no money, he was threatened in various ways. Fortunately, Xia was resourceful and managed to escape. The next day, Dr. Xia received a threatening letter instructing him to prepare the money and send it. After the County Public Security Bureau learned of this, they dispatched a wooden-cased gun team to search the house at No. 16 Xieqiao Street. They found a woman living there, but the two young men were nowhere to be found. The county bureau has now learned the names of the two young men and is conducting a strict investigation.</p>

<p>Defeats Hujiang 28-23</p>
<p>丨Tonight at 8 PM vs. St. John's… Tomorrow vs. White Team丨The Black and White basketball team, which shook Pingjin, is campaigning in Shanghai. Last night, in their first game against Hujiang University, they won 28-23 at the Chinese Basketball Hall, starting at 8 PM. Tang Baokun of Black and White was most admired. Hujiang also performed well. Shao Ji was the referee. Tonight at 8 PM, Black and White will play St. John's, at the same location.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Tang Baokun's Prowess Not Diminished <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Tang Baokun, one of the Five Tigers of Nankai, is agile and lively, known for his quickness and accurate shooting. This time, he came south as the mainstay of the Black and White team, working hard in offense and defense, directing advances and retreats. His agile figure and the prowess of a famous general have not diminished in the slightest, making him the most popular player. Left forward Shen Yugong cooperated very well with Tang.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Black and White Team Full of Promise <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Black and White team is a rising force in Tianjin. Last night, their individual skills were excellent. Their dribbling posture was beautiful and unmatched. However, the whole team was slightly flustered and disorganized, especially at the beginning of the game. They improved significantly later on. It seems that they still need to work hard. Their shooting skills are not yet the most refined, and there were occasional mistakes, making them slightly inferior to the Northeast University team. However, with continued effort, they have a promising future.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Hujiang Team Worthy of Attention <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Hujiang's players were entirely from the university team. They are not what they used to be, and their performance has greatly improved. Last night, there were some surprisingly quick passes. However, their shooting was too inaccurate, leading to the pain of not being able to score. Lao Xiong's three long-range shots were exceptionally beautiful. Wang Xiliang commanded the entire team, performing meritorious and arduous service. Having been separated from Tang Baokun for a long time, facing him in a different army, he must have felt a sense of change.</p>

<p>After the start of the game, the attack was as rapid as a storm, but neither side gained an advantage for a long time. The Shen brothers scored four points first, giving Black and White the lead. Hujiang, with Lao Xiong's long-range shot, surprisingly took the lead by one point, making it 10-9. Hujiang repeatedly took the lead by one point. The first half ended with Hujiang winning by three points. In the second half, Hujiang collapsed, and Black and White won 28-23.</p>

<p>(1) High Jump (2) Long Jump (3) 50 Meters… Broken by Zhuang Mingzhen of Chenglie School</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results: Soochow Girls' Middle School First in Group A, Yinhua First in Group B</p>
<p>The second track and field meet of the Soochow Women's Athletic Association was held yesterday morning. The results were excellent, with Soochow Girls' Middle School winning the Group A team title, and Zhuang Mingzhen of Chenglie School breaking three national records in the high jump, long jump, and 50 meters. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Heroines <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Soochow society was initially quite rich in feudal forces, and active children were often scolded by their elders. As a result, progress in men's sports has been recent, let alone for women. This conference, because of the promotion and publicity, suddenly increased thousands of moving shadows and traces of footsteps among the fields of Zhujiazhuang, Changmen, creating an unprecedented event. The venue was set up at the Chenglie School's sports field, with Qingbai flags flying. A banner reading "Heroines" was hung high in front of the stage, and the audience suspected that all the Soochow ladies participating were female heroes like Hua Mulan.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Opening Ceremony <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 9 AM. After performing the ceremony, the president, Lin Yunsheng, reported on the preparations, and Chen Zhenbang of the county party committee and You Yuefeng, the representative of the education bureau, gave speeches. Their words generally elaborated on sportsmanship and not forgetting the original curriculum. Then, the competition began. When more than eighty athletes paraded around the field with flags, and more than a hundred white legs walked along, it made some old men frown in surprise, but we thought it was beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Soochow Eccentric <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>

<p>More than eighty people participated in this competition. The track events adopted a semi-final system. Zhuang Mingzhen of Chenglie School usually ran the 50 meters in seven seconds, jumped one meter and thirty-five centimeters in the high jump, and four meters and fifty-five centimeters in the long jump. Sun Guiyun and Wu Meixian from Guandong are not her opponents. Is this not one of the eccentrics in Soochow's sports scene? Although Soochow Girls' Middle School has many talents, none can hope to match her.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Scores of Each School <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After the competition was completed, Zhu Song and Sun concluded the results. The team title for Group A belonged to Soochow Girls' Middle School, and the team title for Group B belonged to Yinhua. Soochow Girls' Middle School scored 23 points, Chenglie 20 points, Jinghai 13 points, and Leyi 6 points in Group A. Yinhua scored 32 points, Jinghai 19 points, Leyi 10 points, and the women's vocational school 3 points in Group B.

The prizes included Qian Tianpeng, Director of the Construction Bureau, a "Rising Step by Step" easel, Zou Jingzhi, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, a victory flag, a silver shield from Cuiying Middle School Patriotic Girls' School, and a silver cup from the Da Guangming Newspaper, etc. The winners laughed and held their prizes in the dim night, going their separate ways.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Brief History of Zhuang Mingzhen, Who Broke Three National Records <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Zhuang Mingzhen, a student from Chenglie School who broke the national records in the long jump, high jump, and 50-meter race, is from Nanxiang and is 19 years old. She initially studied at Baoshan Normal School and entered Chenglie Physical Education School in Soochow this semester. She has a tall stature and does not have a girlish appearance. In the 50-meter preliminary, her stride was more than six feet, and her score was only seven seconds. Compared to the final, because she participated in too many events, her score was slightly inferior. According to the previous national record, the high jump was one meter and twenty-two centimeters, the long jump was four meters, and the 50-meter race was seven seconds and four tenths of a second, which has now been easily broken by Ms. Zhuang, speaking for the Soochow ladies, a good phenomenon in the sports world. If she can be trained further, Soochow women's sports will not be difficult to show their strength in the National Games and win championships. Ms. Zhuang, strive!</p>

<p>Nanjing University Wins Track Championship</p>
<p>Hujiang University Wins Field Championship</p>
<p>丨Five New Records Created at the Games丨</p>
<p>丨Excellent Results in 100 and 200 Meters丨</p>
<p>The Third East China Four University Games closed yesterday at 5 PM.</p>
<p>Nanjing University won the track championship, and Hujiang University won the field championship. A total of five new records were created at the Games, in the 100 meters, 200 meters, 800 meters, 1500 meters, and discus throw. The results in the 100 and 200 meters were particularly outstanding. Although the rain reduced the number of spectators, slightly diminishing the excitement, it did not greatly affect the results of the Games. At the award ceremony, with heavy rain pouring down, Mrs. Tang Liu, the wife of the director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, presented the awards and closed the Games. All the athletes from the three schools, except for Soochow, are scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to their schools today.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Nanjing University Wins Track Championship <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Titles in Three Jumps and Two Throws</p>
<p>Victory Comes Easily</p>
<p>Nanjing University won the track championship with 32 points. Nanjing has a wealth of talent in track events, and other schools have no outstanding athletes. Therefore, although the results were average, victory came easily. They won championships in the triple jump, high jump, long jump, shot put, and discus throw. Therefore, the championship belonged to them. The scores of the four schools in track events are as follows:</p>
<p>1st Nanjing University 32 Points</p>
<p>2nd Hujiang University 24 Points</p>
<p>3rd Soochow University 14 Points</p>
<p>4th Zhejiang University 7 Points</p>

<p>Near Total Victory in Sprints</p>
<p>Very Well-Rounded Talent</p>
<p>Hujiang University won the field championship with 37 points. Although they were second to Nanjing yesterday, they jumped to the championship today. The key to their victory lies in the sprints. Hujiang has a well-rounded talent pool, and with multiple positions, their score also increased. They accumulated 8 points in the 100 meters, 6 points in the 200 meters, and 7 points in the 400 meters, adding up to 21 points. Nanjing's defeat was due to their inability to gain positions in the sprints. The scores of the four schools are as follows:</p>
<p>1st Hujiang University 37 Points</p>
<p>2nd Nanjing University 26 Points</p>
<p>3rd Soochow University 11 Points</p>
<p>4th Zhejiang University 3 Points</p>

<p>丨100 Meters丨200 Meters丨800 Meters丨1500 Meters丨Discus Throw丨</p>
<p>All five items are new meet records</p>
<p>Lin Guangxing emerges as a dark horse</p>
<p>In the two-day competition, a total of five new meet records were set: (1) Lin Guangxing of Shanghai University in the 100 meters with 11.1 seconds, breaking Huang Zhiming's 11.6 seconds; (2) Lin Guangxing of Shanghai University in the 200 meters with 23.2 seconds, breaking Zhou Xingjue's 24.4 seconds; (3) Meng Guangshun of Jinling University in the 800 meters with 2 minutes and 19 seconds, breaking Ma Shunwei's 2 minutes and 22 seconds; (4) Meng Guangshun of Jinling University in the 1500 meters with 4 minutes and 48.5 seconds, breaking Yang Pu's 4 minutes and 53 seconds; (5) Ling Peigen of Jinling University in the discus throw with 33.15 meters, breaking Chen Guoxiang's 29.68 meters. Generally speaking, the results are not bad, but Lin Guangxing's 100-meter and 200-meter results are particularly good, adding a lot of color to the meet. Lin Xiu fell 5 or 6 meters behind in the 100-meter race, and the result of 11.1 seconds paled the whole field, but Mr. Rong Qizhao's unofficial timing was 11.4 seconds, which is not too far off. In the 200-meter race, he left Ling Yuanyang more than ten meters behind. Moreover, the 200-meter race is not on a straight track, but requires turning a corner. The rain and the loose track made the result even better. If he can practice hard and take Liu Changchun's place, it is within reach. The rain reduced the appeal of the field events. Although Ling Peigen's discus throw of 33.15 meters did not fully realize his potential, it is already a rare result in East China.</p>

<p>丨This newspaper awards Lin Guangxing a special prize</p>
<p>At around 5 o'clock, after all the events were over, just as the award ceremony was about to begin, a heavy rain suddenly came. Therefore, the prizes were quickly moved into the girls' dormitory. However, their reception room was hosting visiting advisory groups, so they had to give the awards in front of the dormitory entrance. After Mr. Peng Sanmei, the Director of Physical Education at Shanghai University, reported, Tang Liu, the Director of the Diplomatic Affairs Office in Shanghai, gave a speech, hoping for more efforts. Liu Zhanen, the President of Shanghai University, said that this spirit in the midst of wind and rain was admirable. Finally, Mrs. Tang Liu presented the awards, which were very generous. This newspaper awarded a banner to Lin Guangxing of Shanghai University, who had the best results. The event then concluded.</p>
<p>After the award ceremony, Shanghai University hosted a banquet for the meet officials in the girls' dining hall before everyone dispersed.</p>

<p>Four schools participated in the Suzhou Women's Baseball Tournament. Initially, Huishan was thought to have more hope, as they practiced more actively and had defeated the Liangjiang teams in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, in the preliminary round, they were eliminated by the Women's Vocational School, an unknown hero, which was surprising. In the match between Yinghua and Jinghai, there were many twists and turns. Yinghua, due to unfamiliarity with the rules, lost by two points, watching Jinghai obtain the right to the final. Yesterday, the two teams met in the final. The weather was unfavorable, as it was raining in Shanghai. The battle with no retreat was quite exciting. In the end, Jinghai won the championship with a score of 21 to 20.</p>

<p>Educators are increasingly focused on training from early childhood</p>
<p>The School of Education at Jinan University feels that music has a close relationship with education and life. It strongly emphasizes promotion. Yesterday afternoon, taking advantage of the remaining time of the week, a special music conference was held. Principal Xie Xunchu reported on the significance of promoting music education, encouraging the cultivation of the ability to appreciate music, and observing performance results from an educational perspective. Principal Zheng sent Secretary Fan Youshan to deliver a speech, stating that aesthetic education can replace religion and that the school has always promoted music and recreational activities. The performances then began, including mixed Chinese and Western music. In particular, the Shanghai Municipal Council Children's Music Team, led by Miss Wang Ruixian, a musician and music professor at the college, and Miss Dui Xuruo, was highly praised by the audience. All of this originated from the promotion of childhood education by educator Dong Renjian, which shows that educators have focused on music and the need to start training from early childhood. Other wonderful performances included Western music by the Xia Yuehui Society, harmonica ensemble by the China Harmonica Society, English chorus by female students, and the leaf music invented by Lin Maoji.</p>
<p>Also, Jinan University held a school affairs meeting at Yizhixiang yesterday afternoon, discussing the financial allocation for the 20th year in great detail.

Li Youzi was unable to correct the situation in the plane. The plane fell like an arrow</p>

Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of the Navy, went to preside over the ceremony after hearing the news. Shen Dexie of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of the Navy and all the instructors and students went to pay their respects. Li Youzi, also known as Gui Lie, was from Fujian and was 24 years old. He had 60 hours of flying experience. The coffin is temporarily placed in the International Funeral Home. The date of transport back to his hometown has not been set.</p>

<p>Wang Chonghui and others personally bid him farewell</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng sends a letter to Gu Yingfen</p>
<p>Zhang says he will return to Nanjing on the 10th to report</p>
<p>Zhang Ji, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, was ordered to mediate the Guangdong affairs. He took the French postal ship Sphinx at 11 o'clock yesterday morning to Guangdong. This reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang on board. Zhang, dressed in a gray cloth jacket and black cloth mandarin jacket, was smiling and said that he was confident of achieving peace in the Guangdong affairs. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Arriving Late <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>At 10:15 AM yesterday, Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Industry, arrived at the China Merchants Bureau wharf and boarded the ship to bid farewell. However, Zhang Ji himself did not arrive until 10:35 AM. After a brief meeting, Wu Tiecheng arrived, followed by Li Shizeng, Zhang Qun, and Wang Chonghui at 10:45 AM. The ship was about to set sail at that time, and the two sides only stood and spoke to each other from a distance, wishing him a safe journey.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Accompanying Secretary <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The secretaries accompanying Zhang on this trip to Guangdong are Mr. Sheng Cheng and Mr. Huang Jianfen. Although Wu Tiecheng did not travel with them, he had a personal letter to Gu Yingfen, asking him to take the overall situation into consideration and maintain peace. When Wu boarded the ship to bid farewell yesterday morning, he personally handed the letter to Zhang, which was drafted only yesterday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Zhang's Remarks <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Zhang told this reporter on the ship yesterday that he was ordered to go to Guangdong to mediate the Guangdong affairs and that he was confident that a peaceful resolution could be achieved. He may have to stay in Hong Kong for a while, depending on the situation. He expects to return to Nanjing to report in ten days. When asked if Chen Jitang had sent a telegram welcoming him to Guangdong, he replied that Chen had not sent a telegram recently, but Gu Xiangqin (Yingfen) had sent a telegram welcoming him.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Kong Xiangxi's Remarks <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then had a brief conversation with Kong Xiangxi, who said that the Guangdong affairs were caused by the impeachment telegram from the four supervisory committee members, including Deng Zeru. Now, Mr. Zhang is also a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and was ordered to go to Guangdong to handle this matter, which is most appropriate. In the event of a dispute, the final decision can be made according to the law. There is no reason to use force. What's more, between family members and brothers, the Guangdong affairs are the same. As for the military men of Chen Jitang's generation, obedience is their duty. Once the four supervisory committee members' matter is resolved, there should be no problem.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Steps for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Recover Concessions <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The first step is to send personnel to investigate</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of recovering concessions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized three committees last year to design the plan in groups. It also sent Zhang Wenhua, Deputy Chairman of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry, together with Li Jinglun, Deputy Minister of Political Affairs, Wang Jiazhen, Deputy Minister of Permanent Affairs, Chen Yilin, Counselor, and Ying Shangde, Director of the General Affairs Department, to formulate specific recovery measures. It is heard that this measure has now been decided. The first step is to send personnel to various places to investigate the origin of all concessions, administrative measures, economic conditions, etc., with a deadline of four months. After the investigation and report, the second step will be carried out. The personnel for this project have been planned and will be divided into three zones for investigation: (1) The Yellow River Basin and Northeast regions will be responsible by Huang Yuding, assisted by Inspector Cui Shijie; (2) The Yangtze River Basin will be responsible by Guo Taizhen, assisted by Inspector Zhou Zechun; (3) The Pearl River Basin will be responsible by Tao Shumu, assisted by Inspector Tao Lilian. It is also heard that this order will be issued by the Ministry.</p>

<p>To His Excellency Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of Nanjing: Regarding the reorganization of the Shanghai French Court, since Your Ministry raised the issue with the French ambassador, the other party should respect our country's legal rights and return it promptly to honor the relationship between the two countries. However, the French side has always adopted a slow and delayed attitude as a coping strategy. This prolonged delay not only hinders the integrity of our country's legal rights but is also enough to leave a stain on the history of diplomacy. In order to strive to remove the shackles of inequality and complete the unification of the Shanghai Special District Court, the citizens of the French Concession, in addition to sending a message to the French Consul General in Shanghai to forward to the French ambassador to return it unconditionally, hereby telegraph Your Ministry to negotiate the acceptance immediately to comfort the people's aspirations. We respectfully telegraph this to Your Excellency and respectfully ask for your review. The Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, Chairman Cheng Zhusun, Shang Mujang, et al., bow with utmost anxiety. Respectfully printed.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Letter to the French Consul General <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sir: The integrity of legal rights is valued by any country and its people. The legal rights of our Republic of China have been undermined for decades. All the people consider it a great humiliation and vow to redress it. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the people's concept of national sovereignty has become increasingly rich. They have been working to remove the shackles that have violated modern international justice and fairness for the past 80 years. Friendly countries understand the principle of not doing to others what you would not want them to do to you, and provide friendly assistance in the spirit of mutual help and cooperation. This enthusiasm is deeply felt by both the government and the people. Just like the Public Concession adjacent to this concession, its Mixed Court has long been returned to our government and a court has been established according to law. This further shows that the governments and people of the Public Concession have a deep understanding of the way of commerce and diplomacy. However, although the Mixed Court in this concession has been automatically reorganized, it has not fully complied with the provisions of our country's court organization law, and the appointment of moderators and judges is not from our government. This hindrance to our country's legal rights cannot be concealed. China and France have always had a strong relationship. Leaving this stain will inevitably tarnish the jade. The different methods between the two concessions will further cause misunderstandings and increase obstacles to friendly commerce. Based on the spirit of cooperation in the past and with boundless enthusiasm, we hereby convey this special letter, hoping that Your Consul General will forward it to the diplomatic authorities of your government to return the Mixed Court to our government as soon as possible and establish a court in accordance with the law. This will strengthen the relationship between China and France, and the countries related to the Shanghai Public Concession will not be able to excel in the past, and it is also the beginning of a world of great harmony. We respectfully request that you investigate and handle this matter. To His Excellency Mr. Ge, the Consul General of France in Shanghai (May 23, 20th year)</p>

<p>Expected to depart within a week</p>
<p>Decided to travel via the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui, the President of the Judicial Yuan, has been recuperating in Shanghai recently, declining to see guests. He personally went to the port yesterday morning to bid farewell to Zhang Ji, who was heading to Guangdong. Wang was wearing a dark green silk cotton robe and looked haggard. He told this reporter that his health had recently recovered and that he had decided to depart for Europe within a week to take up his post as a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. He has been packing his luggage in recent days and is very busy. He plans to take a train to Liaoning from Beijing, then travel via the Chinese Eastern Railway and Siberia to Europe. His passport has been processed by the Foreign Affairs Commissioner in Harbin. After arriving in Beijing, he intends to stay for a while to say goodbye to friends and deal with personal matters. The International Court was originally scheduled to convene in August, but due to the dispute over the new customs agreement between Germany and Austria, it is necessary to convene the court early. Therefore, he must rush to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>The Central Government hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Guangdong situation</p>
<p>He is extremely firm in his opposition to the slaughter tax issue</p>
<p>Building wharves to develop the city center</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Qun went to Beijing on business on the 18th of this month and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. After arriving in Shanghai, he visited the Central Committee members who remained in Shanghai, including Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Zhang Renjie, Wu Zhihui, and Kong Xiangxi, to discuss the mediation plan for the Guangdong situation. At 11 o'clock, he accompanied the committee members to the wharf to see off Zhang Ji, who was heading to Guangdong. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency interviewed him at his residence yesterday and asked him about various issues. He answered in detail, and the following is a record of his remarks.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Guangdong Situation <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>According to Mayor Zhang, the central government consistently hopes for a peaceful resolution to the Guangdong situation. The unified image that the National Government possesses today was not easily achieved. Therefore, everyone now, mindful of the difficulties in building it, will take extra care to protect it, hoping for a more solid foundation day by day. Moreover, the communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have not yet been completely eradicated, and the people of those three provinces are in dire straits awaiting relief. Thus, the central government is currently striving to eliminate the bandit scourge and vigorously planning construction, absolutely unwilling to initiate any disputes that would hinder the aforementioned plans for suppressing bandits and construction. As for the Guangdong situation, it is merely a slight misunderstanding. Once explained in the future, there should be no problems. In short, the people are tired of turmoil, and the majority do not want to disrupt peace.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Slaughter Tax Issue <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>When the reporter inquired about the solution to the business suspension of local butchers due to the slaughter tax issue, the response was that he had expressed his views on the slaughter tax issue some days ago. The current disturbance was entirely stirred up by a few contractors, and the butchers themselves had not had an increased burden placed on them, but were merely being incited by others. Moreover, the slaughter tax is a kind of statutory tax rule, and we only know how to abide by the law, with no other issues. Therefore, he is extremely resolute on the slaughter tax issue.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Pier Issue <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Also discussed was the recent approval by the Ministry of Interior for the construction of a pier in the Hongkou District Number Two Map area of this city. This was originally part of the plan to construct a central urban area. Three piers will be built east of the central urban area in the future to meet the needs of developing the central urban area. The trunk road for reaching the pier under construction is already under construction. However, to complete the plan for a great Shanghai commercial port, the Wusong River will still need to be dredged in the future.</p>

<p>Yang Shuzhuang Has Several Days Before Returning to Fujian</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Minister of the Navy and concurrently Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai the afternoon before yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter from the Kwok Man Agency called on him and asked about the current state of the navy. The conversation obtained was as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e203">Yang's Trip to Hangzhou <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Chen briefly stated that Minister Yang (Shuzhuang) had gone to Hangzhou for private matters. After he arrived in Shanghai, he had already reported this by telegram. However, due to matters needing to be discussed, Minister Yang was scheduled to return to Shanghai today (yesterday). He heard that he would still need to go to Hangzhou once more, so his return to Fujian was still a few days away. Currently, the Pu'an warship is still waiting for orders at the mouth of the Songjiang River.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Review Not Yet Completed <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The naval review has already been completed for a large part of the navy. Those not yet reviewed are only the ships under repair. Therefore, there was a previous order for the Hai Chou and other ships in Shanghai to complete repairs within ten days so that they could sail to Beijing for review.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Recruiting One Hundred Students <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The Naval Department plans to recruit one hundred naval students on the sixteenth of next month. Each province will recommend fifteen students to come to Beijing for the examination. Those admitted in the future will first study at the Minjiang Naval Academy. After the naval academy being built in Xiangshan is completed, they will be transferred there.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Surveying Commercial Port <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>According to Sun Yat-sen’s "The International Development of China," the central government is developing a large eastern commercial port. Currently, the Naval Department has dispatched the Ganlu survey ship to the Qianjiang River estuary near the Yangtze River to actively conduct surveys. It is expected to be completed in about two to three months.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Lin Zhong in Custody <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Lin Zhong and others were previously arrested and escorted to Beijing. This matter is entirely being handled by the central government. He had recently been in Beijing and had not heard any news. Fujian's finances are indeed very difficult, but this matter is also being handled by the provincial government. All naval expenditures in Fujian are allocated by the central government. After Minister Yang contacted Chairman Chiang and Finance Minister Song in Beijing this time, it is expected that there will be a solution. He was not deeply aware of this. After the conversation, he bid farewell. He heard that Chen had already gone to Beijing on the night train last night.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Ma Hongkui Denies Entering Gansu <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>There is a rumor that Ma Hongkui, the commander of the Fifteenth Route Army, will be appointed as the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government. Ma happened to be in Shanghai for business. A reporter from the Kwok Man Agency visited him at his residence yesterday. According to Ma, his elder brother Hongbin is currently in charge of provincial affairs in Gansu. Although there is talk outside that the central government will send him to Gansu, it will definitely not become a reality. The Fifteenth Route Army is still stationed in Tai'an and other places in southern Shandong. His trip to Shanghai this time does not have any special mission.</p>

<p>According to the Kwok Man Agency, the District Party Headquarters of the nine districts of this city issued a declaration yesterday, requesting the central government to recover the Shanghai concessions as soon as possible, and requesting the whole country to unanimously advocate for it. The original text stated: Tracing back to when the European and American powers, relying on their huge military force and abundant capital,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>carried out aggression against weak nations and small countries, some were occupied as territories, and others were reduced to foreign dependencies. Our industry is backward, and our old and large China with a long history cannot but fall into the misery of a semi-colony. Our populous, conveniently located, and strategically important prosperous Shanghai cannot but sink into a base for international imperialists to invade China. International imperialists, relying on the superior power of politics and the unequal treaties that act as shields, run rampant and do whatever they want within our solemn and brilliant land. Anything that can be said to have the slightest benefit for the imperialists themselves and is sufficient to harm our national sovereignty, damage the lives of our people, and weaken our national vitality is carried out wantonly. Just look at the so-called Shanghai concessions ruled by the imperialists, where opium and gambling are openly practiced, bandits run rampant, brothels line the streets, prostitutes crowd the alleys, national traitors and wanted criminals all regard them as places of refuge, and reactionary groups all regard them as sources of origin. Not only is the tranquility of society and the customs of the people affected, but the safety of the country and the survival of the nation are also seriously damaged. At a time when our whole country is unanimously striving to abolish the unequal treaties, the despicable means and sordid behaviors of the imperialists are increasingly intensifying. Thinking of this, how can we not be frightened? The members of this association vow to lead all party members and all people in the district to appeal to the central government to recover it as soon as possible, and hope that all sectors of the people will unanimously advocate for it, in order to sweep away the arrogant and fierce flames of the imperialists and wash away the great humiliation of being trampled under iron hooves for decades.

<p>The Farmers' Association of Fahua District and various labor unions such as the Steamboat Water Industry Union in this city issued declarations and telegrams yesterday regarding the Guangdong matter, urging Chen and others to awaken. The text of the telegrams is recorded separately as follows:</p>

<p>The National Conference has already been held in the capital. All political, military, and economic matters have largely reached a unified principle. This is an early symbol of China's unification and peace. We are eagerly anticipating its realization. Unexpectedly, in the midst of firecrackers, there suddenly came the news of Chen Jitang of Guangdong raising troops. How astonishing this is! We common people suffered from the imperialists' oppression of China through wars twenty years ago. The Opium War and the Eight-Nation Alliance's invasion of Beijing are all past wounds.</p>
<p>After the founding of the Republic of China, up until last year, it can be said that there was no year without civil war. We common people have suffered enough and committed enough sins. Fortunately, this year there is finally peaceful unification, and the National Conference has also been held in Nanjing. Everything can be resolved. Moreover, Guangdong is the source of the revolution, and the people of Guangdong have suffered particularly much. Then how can they have the extra strength to supply [the army]? Chen should wake up quickly! Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot. The central government is very lenient and will definitely be able to forgive you. Otherwise, if everything is destroyed, it will be terrible. Sincerely, the Shanghai Steamboat Wood Industry Union Preparatory Committee, the Shanghai Preserved Meat Industry Union Preparatory Committee, the Shanghai Shoe Manufacturing Industry Union Preparatory Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Association Declaration <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Ever since the founding of the Republic of China, we have been internally subjected to the trampling of warlords and externally subjected to the aggression of the great powers. The people are living in misery, and the nation's fate is in danger. Fortunately, our revolutionary comrades, upholding the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, have undergone difficult hardships and sacrificed countless martyrs, and only then have we been able to achieve today's unified situation. All citizens should wholeheartedly cherish this party and country of peaceful unification. This is a time when we should advance and jointly resist foreign aggression and eliminate communism, and strive for political tutelage and construction. Unexpectedly, Deng, Lin, Xiao, Gu, and others, being members of the supervisory committee, harbored different ambitions and dared to provoke conflict due to private grudges, rashly taking up pens and issuing 30 telegrams. Chen Jitang, even more ambitious, did not consider it and responded to the 30 telegrams of Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu, following Feng Yu-hsiang and Li Zongren's disobedience and raising troops. At a time when the red bandits are causing trouble and the great powers are watching intently, Chen not only does not work for the party and country, but instead willingly acts as a traitor who destroys national law and violates party discipline, disregarding the survival of the country and disregarding the suffering of the people. All citizens are indignant and hate this. We now issue the most sincere and loyal declaration, hoping that Chen will immediately repent and thoroughly correct his past mistakes. If he stubbornly persists and follows in the footsteps of the warlords, we can only urgently request the central government to severely denounce him.</p>

<p>After Liu Jiwen, the former Jianghai Customs Superintendent, went to Guangdong, it was recently reported that Liu had embezzled two million yuan of public funds during his tenure, and the Ministry of Finance ordered the new superintendent Tang Haian to investigate. Yesterday, a reporter from the Kwok Man Agency went to the office to visit Tang Zhaoshi specifically for this reason. Tang Zhaoshi, the secretary, received him and was asked about the previous matter. He replied that when Superintendent Tang took office, the handover was handled by the secretary Xu Tigang of the previous administration. It has now been completely completed. The account books and files are very clear, and Mr. Xu is still in this office. As for the matter of embezzling funds, it is even more untrue. When the Changguan was not withdrawn fifty li away, there were no such large sums of money stored in the office. Moreover, the superintendent's funds are well known to the customs tax department. Now the Changguan within fifty li has been effectively abolished since June 1. After the abolition, the regular expenses of this office will be reduced from 7,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan per month. The reduction is 2,000 yuan from the fines of the Changguan and 3,000 yuan from the tax department. To this day, this office has not received an official order from the central government to investigate, so this matter is likely a rumor.</p>

<p>The 36th Meeting</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Discussion Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held its 36th regular meeting at 7 p.m. on the 22nd of this month on the fourth floor of the Bank Association Building at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. More than a dozen people attended, including Li Shiying, He Yongzhen, Chen Zemin, Gong Fengqiang, Li Fenghui, Chu Huiseng, Wang Xiaolai, Xiao Huarong, Chen Shaoyou, Lin Kanghou, Shen Zhongfu, Wu Zonglian, Zhang Zhuping, Mo Ruisen, Qu Wenliu, Tang Liu, etc. Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang recorded. After Director Tang reported on the affairs of the office, they discussed the proposal by Committee Member Lin Kanghou to invite the Ministry to train personnel for overseas embassies and consulates, and the proposal by Committee Member Chen Zemin to request the prompt recovery of the Mixed Court of the French Concession in Shanghai. Committee Member Chen gave a very thorough explanation of the urgent need to recover the French Court, and was particularly indignant at the violation of the principle of original jurisdiction in the Chinese lawsuits under the regulations for the extension of the new boundary of the French Concession of the second year of the Republic of China. The listeners were deeply moved.</p>
<p>It was unanimously passed and submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for adoption, and a serious negotiation was proposed.</p>

<p>The case of checking the telegrams coming from and going to the three companies, Daito, Great Northern, and Pacific, has been reported previously. It is essential to check foreign telegrams for our country's international promotion. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications decided to send personnel to check them. During the European War, checks were conducted once before but soon withdrew. After the Ministry of Communications assigned inspectors, the Shanghai International Telegraph Office, entrusted the head of the waterline section, Shen Fuhai, accompanied by the director of Daito Inspection, Chen Wende, the director of Great Northern, Pan Chengdong, and the director of the Pacific, Sun Xichen, and various inspectors to negotiate inspection matters with the three companies. The attitude of the three companies was hesitant, but after the staff repeatedly negotiated and explained the reasons for the inspection, the three companies put forward two points: (A) All inspections of telegrams from various countries must be approved by the Universal Telegraph Association and notified to various countries for investigation; (B) All telegram institutions in Shanghai must be checked uniformly, and that they have not received a reply from the Ministry of Communications. The next day, the three directors went to the three companies and negotiated in person. At that time, the reply from the Ministry of Communications also arrived, and the misunderstanding was cleared up. They took various inspectors to the three companies on the 20th of this month to start work. They are currently engaged in arranging everything, and as soon as the procedures are complete, they will implement the inspection in accordance with the six inspection rules published in the three companies' reports. It is also heard that the Ministry of Communications has also appointed Yu Zezhao, a technician of the Ministry and a member of the International Telecommunications Committee, as the director of the inspection of Japanese telegrams. It is also said that inspectors will be selected to handle various radios in the same way.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Sand and Gravel Industry Dispute Changes <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>There are fears that there may be another work stoppage</p>
<p>The sand and gravel industry in this city, after resuming operations in unison the day before yesterday, encountered disputes over the issue of detaining ships and extorting donations yesterday. The various situations are recorded again as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e219">About to Stop Work Again <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sand and gravel businesses became extremely indignant because the Dachang contractor, responsible for tax collection, employed personnel and dispatched nine police officers to collect sand and gravel taxes in various places along the shore, with respect to sand ships coming to Shanghai. They are planning to suspend operations again to show their resistance.</p>
<p>Sand Ships Respond The Sand Ship Industry sent a letter to the Association yesterday saying: “Regarding the illegal collection of sand management fees and sand prices under various guises in Zhejiang Province, all shipowners are opposed. After reading the newspapers repeatedly, your association has spoken righteously and sought the interests of our shipowners. We are very grateful. We hereby record the documents submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government on the 19th of this month as follows: We hereby present a petition that Zhejiang Construction Hall is setting up improper names and illegally collecting the money. Please immediately cancel the fees so that the government may respond appropriately and alleviate the people’s poverty. The shipowners have been living in the coastal mountains for generations, with more than two to three thousand people relying on the transportation of sand and gravel for a living. In the past, loading and unloading were free, and sales were free, without any levies. Two years ago, treacherous merchants proposed to contract for sand and gravel donations, but the government rejected it because it involved onerous details. The shipowners were grateful for the government's kindness and felt that there would never be any sand and gravel donations again. Unexpectedly, on May 1 of this year, Zhejiang Construction Hall offices and inspection stations were suddenly set up everywhere in Shanghai, Wusong, Dinghai, and other places to issue sand mining permits, regardless of whether it was sand or mud from the outer sea or inland rivers, and a management fee of 50 cents per ton and a sand price of 20 cents were collected. At the same time, Dachang Yitai Company was organized to forcibly buy and sell, otherwise people would be detained and ships would be impounded, and harassment was ubiquitous. Not only was there monopolistic hoarding, but also profiteering. This kind of taxation of goods is actually a disguised likin. At a time when likin is being vigorously abolished, they dare to set up improper names and illegally collect a disguised sand and gravel donation that was not found in the likin era. It is really shocking. The livelihoods of thousands of shipowners are at stake, and the public is in a state of panic. For this reason, we collectively request that you, the leaders, consider the livelihoods of the small people and immediately issue an order to cancel the management fees, sand prices, and other items, and impeach those who disregard political orders in accordance with the law. In addition to the separate submission, we sincerely submit this." Signed by Huang Yuankang, Wu Shengui, Ping Qingfa, Dong Yuesheng, Ping Axiu and others, shipowners of outer sea fishing boats, who have nominated Mr. Zhou Dezheng to come forward and request you to receive him. We are overwhelmed with gratitude."</p>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce is Responsible for Resolving the Slaughter Tax</p>
<p>Fresh Meat Available in the Chinese Quarter Tomorrow</p>
<p>The fresh meat merchants in this city have suspended business due to the slaughter tax issue, which has affected the business of restaurants and other businesses, especially the pig industry. Butchers in the concessions, accepting the advice of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, have already slaughtered. Butchers in the Chinese Quarter will start slaughtering today and wait for a solution. The various situations yesterday are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e222">Pig Merchants Request <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>He Laiqing, Zhu Jiugao, Zhang Weisheng, Zhang Fuchen, Sun Kexuan and other representatives of the pig merchants from Jiangbei in Shanghai, totaling 1,326 people, sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday saying: “We, the undersigned, make a living by selling pigs. We transport goods from the production areas in Jiangbei to Shanghai to seek meager profits. More shipments mean more meager profits, and fewer shipments mean more losses. The sales of pigs depend entirely on meat merchants, so the fresh meat industry is our only customer. Recently, the meat merchants in Shanghai have been resisting the high tax issue and appealing to the chamber, hoping to find a solution and stabilize their business. When the news came, our thousands of pig merchants were overjoyed, and according to reports, the Fresh Pig Association has also sent a letter to your chamber, requesting a quick resolution to relieve the meat industry from its difficulties. However, there has been a delay until now without any results, which has caused all the meat merchants in the city to suspend operations, and the greatest impact is on our pig merchants. The source of goods has lost its sales channels, and our livelihoods are becoming increasingly precarious. We are wandering aimlessly and stuck in a dilemma. Moreover, fresh pigs are live goods, and the longer the delay, the more crowded they become in the cargo hold, becoming thinner day by day, and the losses are increasing. If a solution is not found in time, the capital on which we rely for our livelihood will be lost. Thinking about it is frightening, and speaking of it is painful. Therefore, on behalf of our thousands of pig merchants, we call on your chamber to be impartial and resolute and find a quick and effective solution to save the merchants from the water and fire. We are extremely hopeful.” The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied immediately, “We have received your letter requesting a quick resolution of the meat merchants' suspension due to the slaughter tax issue. The Municipal Finance Bureau has sent a letter requesting that we summon the meat industry representatives to persuade them to resume business first and be responsible for finding a solution. We are now actively working on it and hope to find a reasonable solution in the shortest possible time. This is a reply for your information."</p>

<p>More than 1,400 shops and stores of fresh meat merchants in the concessions, such as Lujiangjian, complied with the order to enter the market to purchase goods yesterday and reopened for business. Renyuan Slaughter in Jiaxing Road, Juxing Slaughter in Yuezhou Road, Suxi Slaughter in Dawang Temple, Suning Slaughter, Fanggongdong Bureau Slaughter in Nanyang Bridge, and Yinggongbuju Slaughter in Huasheng Road were all slaughtered last night, and fresh meat is available in the concessions today. Meat shops in the Chinese Quarter will purchase goods today and resume business, and fresh meat will be available tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, recognizing that the suspension of business by fresh meat merchants has been prolonged and is ultimately not a good solution, has been actively working to persuade them since receiving the letter from the Finance Bureau requesting that it find a way to persuade them. The Chamber invited representatives of the industry to persuade them the day before yesterday, and the meat merchants in the concessions immediately reopened for business. At 2 p.m. yesterday, they invited representatives of the industry again. Representatives Rong Qianchu and Wang Jinwen attended, along with Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Executive Committee Member Wang Yansong, and Secretary-General Zheng Chengqing. They ordered the representatives to persuade all the meat merchants in the city to resume business first and be responsible for working out a solution with the municipal government. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce will guarantee all the slaughter tax amount, and the tax will be paid when the solution is reached. The representatives left feeling satisfied.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Finance Bureau saying, "Regarding the collection of slaughter tax on a per-animal basis for the fresh meat industry, business has been suspended for many days. Our Chamber has tried our best to persuade them to resume business first and discuss a solution with the competent authorities. The industry has complied with our advice and will slaughter tomorrow. During the period when our Chamber continues to discuss the solution with your Bureau, please continue to count the number of pigs slaughtered and pay the tax when a solution is reached. Our Chamber is responsible for guaranteeing the amount. Please instruct your Bureau not to detain the pigs so that a smooth solution can be reached. We sincerely hope for your cooperation."</p>

<h3 id="e227">Wang Yansong Talks <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Wang Yansong, the Executive Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, yesterday because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce had taken over the mediation of this case, and asked about the mediation situation. According to Wang, at the beginning of the dispute, the industry association sent representatives to Beijing several times to request him to forward their pleas to the central government to sympathize with the merchants' difficulties and find ways to safeguard them. At that time, he was attending the National Congress and had little time, and the case was a local issue and there was no need to report to the central government. He could wait until he returned to Shanghai to resolve it. While in Beijing, he heard rumors that a few people were manipulating the situation, but after returning to Shanghai, he realized that this was not the case. The meat merchants have expressed that they can accept the small collection of points per animal, but they are requesting a reduction in the tax rate because they cannot afford it, which is not too much to ask. He recently decided that the meat merchants' prolonged suspension of business has caused considerable losses, so he strongly urged the meat merchants to resume business first, and he will be responsible for working out a solution with the mayor. The meat merchants have recently accepted his advice and will reopen for business tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Grand Opening Ceremony of the National YWCA Association <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>A Precursor to the Success of the National Women's Movement</p>
<p>Madame Huang Zuoting's Labor Deserves Commemoration</p>
<p>The new building of the National YWCA Association has been under construction since last winter, and the main beams and pillars have been completed. On the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, at 4 p.m., the association held a foundation stone laying ceremony, and Madame Huang Zuoting was invited to lay the foundation stone. Here is a record of the grand occasion:</p>
<p>Around 4 p.m. on the 22nd, Chinese and foreign guests arrived one after another. At that time, more than a dozen people including the committee members of the Association, Madame Mei Huaquan, Madame Xia Jinlin, Dr. Su Shouzhen, Ms. Jin Mao Yunqin, and the General Secretary of the Association, Ms. Ding Shujing, stood respectfully at the entrance of the venue to receive the guests cordially and seat them one by one. It is estimated that there were about 300 people attending the ceremony to offer their congratulations, including representatives from the China Vocational Education Society, the local municipal government, various agencies, the Cosmopolitan Student Association, and major Christian organizations in Shanghai. It was a grand occasion. In addition to the usual ceremonies such as paying the highest respect to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and respectfully reading his will, the chairman, Madame Zheng Zhangcheng, reported on the preparation process of the new building and the origin of the site. Then, Madame Mei Huaquan, chairman of the building committee, gave a detailed account of the history of the new building. Finally, Madame Huang Zuoting performed the foundation stone laying ceremony. At that time, workers slowly raised the foundation stone to the designated position with a lifting machine and placed it properly. Then, Madame Huang personally took a few spoonfuls of plaster with a silver hoe and lightly touched the joints of the foundation stone as a symbol of personally sealing it. The foundation stone was placed under a large window sill on the left corner of the new building, about the height of a person. The window faces the street and is sure to be seen by passersby. The foundation stone is engraved with eight large Northern Wei characters, "Walk to Know Truth, Truth Releases Steps," which is the motto of the Association. The handwriting is clear and the style is strong, making it an excellent work of art. Madame Huang, who presided over the foundation stone laying ceremony, has a deep relationship with the YWCA movement in China. Madame Huang has been serving in the YWCA for more than 20 years, and has made admirable contributions to the Association's affairs, both large and small. It can be said that she has earned the honor of performing this grand ceremony as a reward for her hard work. As for the silver hoe used during the foundation laying, the chairman respectfully presented it to Madame Huang as a permanent souvenir. After the ceremony, important figures from the municipal government, Ms. Lin Kecong, Ge Baohang, executive member of the Drug Resistance Association, and Mr. Zhong Ketuo, Mr. Zhu Lide, general secretary of the Christian Association, and Zhang Jun, chairman of the Youth Association, delivered speeches, earnestly expressing their views and encouraging the audience. The audience was moved. The gist of the speeches was that the YWCA's foundation laying ceremony today is not only to congratulate the committee members and staff of the YWCA from the perspective of a tangible foundation, from which a solid foundation will be built and the future is limitless. The laying of this foundation stone actually contains an intangible aspect, which is even more worthy of celebration, that is, this foundation laying is tantamount to laying a solid foundation for the future of the Chinese women's movement, and showing that the success of our future women's movement is as stable as Mount Tai. (2) This foundation laying is a sign that the YWCA movement in China has reached the right track. (3) Looking at the women's groups in China today, the only one with organization, system and national scope is the YWCA. Therefore, the laying of this foundation stone should be solemnly congratulated and encouraged by the people of the country. Now that the foundation has been laid, the Association has added another responsibility to guide women across the country. In short, although the ceremony itself was to lay a small foundation stone, it seemed insignificant, but the atmosphere at the venue at that time and the expressions in the speeches of the guests were full of infinite solemnity and infinite joy. Finally, the students of the Chinese and Western Girls' School sang and dispersed, and went to the second floor of the new building to enjoy tea and snacks. At about 6 o'clock, the hosts and guests dispersed happily.</p>

<p>The Jing'an Temple in Western Shanghai always holds a Buddha bathing ceremony on the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. This year, the Public Works Department issued a notice restricting the setting up of stalls. After the abbot of the temple, Zhifa, repeatedly negotiated with the Public Works Department, the order was revoked. The stalls along the way are like combs, and when the lights are turned on, it is like entering a city that never sleeps. Local gentry have donated money to hire musicians, and various agencies and schools have assigned security guards and boy scouts to serve in the temple to celebrate together. Its grandeur is unprecedented. It is expected that if the weather is good today, the bustling situation will be more prosperous than in previous years.</p>

<p>The Plight of the Victims Brings Tears to One's Eyes</p>
<p>Generously Donate to the Emergency Relief Association</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau responded to the request of the Shaanxi Disaster Emergency Relief Association and sent the Shaanxi film to major cinemas for screening, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, the film was premiered at the Carlton Theatre. Although it was raining continuously, there were still many enthusiastic viewers. Some women in the audience were brought to tears by the plight of the victims, showing that this situation is truly beyond the imagination of the people who live in comfort in Shanghai. It is said that the film will still be screened at the Carlton Theatre at 10 a.m. next Saturday, with an additional feature film. From the 31st, it will be screened at the Central, Shanghai, and Odeon theatres. Those who feel compassion for the displaced victims and generously donate can send their donations directly to the Shaanxi Disaster Emergency Relief Association on Yunnan Road, the General Office of the Red Cross Society on Second Avenue, or to the temporary donation boxes at the entrances of the Central, Shanghai, and Odeon theaters, so that they can gather sand into a tower and lift the victims from their misery, which is a supreme virtue.</p>

<p>Two American Soldiers Fight Each Other by the River</p>
<p>A Chinese Worker Tries to Mediate and Suffers a Calamity</p>
<p>Still Not Found by Evening</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around 2 p.m., two sailors from an American warship docked at the Xin Kai He Riverfront hired two rickshaws and got off in front of Jinyuan No. 8 Warehouse. The two then started fighting each other near the No. 11 pier, as if they were drunk. As they fought, they gradually moved towards the pier, as if they were about to fall into the river. A coolie who was watching rushed to Limalu and reported to Chinese Constable No. 165. The constable arrived at the riverbank and saw the two sailors fighting on the pier, seemingly about to fall into the water. He went forward to try to persuade them, but was pushed away. He retreated and stood on the shore. At that time, one of the sailors was half-submerged in the water. Seeing the danger, the coolie resolutely went down to the pier to save him. Unexpectedly, the other sailor pushed the coolie into the river, and he immediately disappeared. Seeing the disaster, the constable took the two sailors to the No. 16 Wharf Police Station, reported the situation, and a patrolman from Jinyuan Wharf No. 8 testified. The police station detained the two sailors and sent detectives to investigate the scene and dock workers to search for the coolie. Because it was high tide at the time, he had not been found by 4 p.m. Only a pair of broken shoes and a hat were found.</p>

<p>Three Corpses Reburied Last Month</p>
<p>Shen Zhongping Offers Reward to Catch a Thief</p>
<p>Grave robbery cases in Pudong and Western Shanghai are often heard of. The Yao family's ancient tomb on Avenue Paul Doumer in the French Concession was robbed by thieves again last night, and the bones were scattered. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e237">History of the Yao Family Tomb <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The Yao family's ancient tomb is located at the northwest corner of Avenue Paul Doumer and Rue Alfred W P in the French Concession, behind the German School, in the 27th Bao 5th Tu of Shangyi County. The Yao family is the maternal family of the late Shen, the owner of the Yongxiangfeng Funeral Supplies Store on Sanmalu, and a famous wealthy merchant in Shanghai. The coffin of Shen's maternal grandfather was made of nanmu wood, extremely strong, and contained a lot of gold, silver, and jade. He died decades ago. The Yao family's ancestral tomb was originally near Jing'an Temple, but the three coffins were moved to the 5th Tu of Avenue Paul Doumer due to the construction of roads by the Public Works Department. Every Qingming Festival, Shen's descendants would go to sweep the tomb.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Details of the Robbery <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The night before yesterday (the 21st), around midnight, three thieves carrying grave-robbing equipment dug up the three coffins and split them open with axes. They stole the ancient jade and gold objects from the coffins. The corpses had already rotted, leaving only bones. The thieves had three wooden boxes, and they put the bones in the boxes and reburied them, intending to cover up their tracks. While they were working, dawn broke. Neighbor A got up and went to the field to pick vegetables and saw the situation. He ran to the Yongxiangfeng store on Sanmalu and reported to the young master of the store, Shen Zhongping. Shen drove to the scene by car, but the thieves had already fled. Only the three coffins were split open, and the bones were scattered all over the ground, a very tragic sight.</p>

<p>Water Police Arrests One Pirate After Receiving Report</p>
<p>Around 5 p.m. on the 18th of this month, a Wang Fuji official salt ship was sailing through the Red Boat waters outside the Wusong Estuary when two pirate ships suddenly came after it, firing shots as a warning. They surrounded and robbed the ship from both sides. The shipowner, Wang Shanzai, was taken to the pirate ship. Around 6 p.m., an ice-fresh ship sailed to the same waters and was also intercepted and robbed by pirate ships. Both ships were then taken by the pirate ships to Xiaosha and anchored. On the next day, the pirates took the ice-fresh ship out to sea. Gong Yuesheng was tied up on the official salt ship, and two pirates were sent to monitor the ship, ordering it to sail towards Wusong. Yesterday afternoon, around 3 p.m., the official salt ship sailed into the Wusong Estuary. The pirates ordered the ship to dock near the Hei Futong (Black Buoy) near Paotai Bay. One pirate remained on the ship to monitor it, while the other escorted Gong Yuesheng from the ice-fresh ship to shore at the Paotai Bay Foreign Wharf, took a train to Shanghai to collect money to redeem the ship. Around 4 p.m., the helmsman of the official salt ship, Yang Azeng, took advantage of the pirate's inattention and sneaked to the stern of the ship, escaped ashore in a small boat, and ran to the 16th Team of the 4th District of the Wusong Water Police to report the crime. Captain Wu Zhishan of the team immediately sent police to be stationed at the station, secretly waiting for the pirate to go to Shanghai. At the same time, he sent Inspector Jiang of the 3rd Team to lead a large number of water police to take a small steamer, silently, to the Hei Futong official salt ship. At this time, the pirate had become aware and attempted to jump into the water and escape, but it was too late and he was arrested and taken back to the team headquarters. The pirate confessed his name as Wang Shaochuan, 42 years old, from Haimen, Zhejiang, a boatman. He used to work on Panxinglai's ship and was kidnapped by pirates in the Da Ji waters some time ago. He was forced to act as a pilot on the pirate ship. The day before yesterday, the pirates ordered him to guard the salt ship with another pirate who was at large and to sail to Wusong. Because it was raining and he was hungry, he wanted to get off the ship after eating, but was arrested by the soldiers. The pirate leader's surname is Wang. There were nine pirates on the pirate ship, with eight rifles and seven pistols. They ordered me to stay on the salt ship and wait for the ice-fresh ship to go to Shanghai to get money and redeem the tickets. I was just urging for money for the pirates. Captain Wu, after verifying the confession, immediately ordered Inspector Jiang to lead the police to take a small steamer to Xiaosha outside the Wusong Estuary to pursue the remaining pirates. The two pirate ships anchored in Xiaosha saw the small steamer from afar and knew that something was wrong. They immediately took advantage of the wind and set sail and fled. Seeing the situation, the small steamer immediately chased after it, but it was already dark and the wind and waves in the waters outside the estuary were very strong. The small steamer was afraid of encountering danger and had to return, so the ice-fresh ship that had been kidnapped was able to take the opportunity to escape and return to the Wusong Estuary, which can be said to be the best of a bad situation. The police, who were secretly waiting at the station, did not see any trace of the pirates until the evening and reported back to the team. Captain Wu considered the case to be serious and sent the arrested pirate to the 4th District for review that night.</p>

<p>Pucao Road in Western Shanghai starts from Chengjiaqiao on Hongqiao Road, passes south through Hongqiao Town to Yaojiawan Bridge, and extends east along the Caohejing River to the gate of the Youmin Xiqin Institute in Caojing Town, and ends at Zhongshan Road in Longhua Temple. The entire road is 16 li long. It was originally named Qinglong Road, but the municipal government's funds were unavailable, so it was temporarily postponed. Now, Mr. Huang Jinrong has donated a large sum of money to build the eastern section of the road first to facilitate transportation, starting from Caojing West Town, along the river to the Huang family ancestral hall in Laofenshan. The road surface is entirely paved with stones and has been completed, which is convenient for the villagers who come and go.</p>
<h3 id="e245">The Health Sports Meeting of the YWCA Ended Successfully <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the Shanghai YWCA Health Sports Meeting. The weather was not good in the morning, it was raining, but it cleared up at noon, and the number of people attending suddenly increased. The places where physical examinations and vaccinations were given were especially crowded, and the venue was packed. In the afternoon, there was a speech by Dr. Fu Wenshou, who, based on his experience, put forward the following thoughts on the issue of infant care: (1) There are four errors in infant care methods: (1) Mothers lack common sense of infant care, (2) Old ideas are not easy to break and hinder new knowledge, (3) Entrusting infants to ignorant maids, resulting in illness or the development of bad habits, (4) Improper feeding after weaning. It must be known that feeding children only with porridge and rice is not enough to meet the needs of the child's body. Infants must have a small amount of milk, eggs, fruits, vegetables, grains, and meat every day in order to develop a strong body. It is important to prevent the following every day: (3) Delay and panic after illness, (4) Disregard for the advice of doctors, (5) Lack of well-equipped pediatric hospitals, (6) Lack of health care cooperation between medical experts and philanthropists. The above points should be paid attention to by us. Correct the first four examples if you have them, and encourage yourself if you don't. As for the latter two, we hope that all walks of life will advocate and promote them in order to achieve the goal and wipe out the shame of being a sick man. After the speech, the Jingwu Gymnastics Association's national music was followed, and the melodious silk and bamboo added color to the conference. The "Child Labor" skit by the association's labor union group was also quite alarming. In the three days, a total of more than 300 women and children attended the meeting for physical examinations, injections, and vaccinations. This does not include the students of the association and the ladies of the dormitory. There were about 2,600 visitors to the conference, and many ladies from all walks of life took this opportunity to learn about the YWCA and join as members, and many children joined the Children's Health Association established by the association, so that they can be examined once a week to achieve the purpose of health care. It is also heard that the association will regularly select those children who are physically sound from this examination and re-examine them once, and give awards according to the rankings to encourage them. In addition to the awards prepared by the association, there are also gifts from various milk powder companies.</p>

<p>Elementary School Sports The Youth Association has always advocated sports, and various sports meetings have been held successively. However, the elementary school joint sports is uniquely lacking. At this time of early summer and clear weather, the neighboring elementary schools are united to hold a game sports meeting, which can not only develop children's sporting nature and make them feel interested and become a habit, but also allow teachers and students of various schools to get to know and connect with each other, and promote group sports, with the group as the unit. It is scheduled to convene the first preparatory meeting at the gymnasium of the association at 4 p.m. on the 23rd of this month (Saturday).

<h3 id="e253">Superintendent of Pacification Sends Detectives to Escort Wanted Criminal, Zhi Jingui <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Zhi Yan Requests Retrial</p>
<p>Trial Postponed Due to Absence of Lawyer</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang, Superintendent of Pacification for Jiangsu, previously sent a document to the French Concession court stating that the bandit leader Zhi Jingui, also known as Zhi Xingkui or Zhi Xiaotao, had committed serious crimes in the Jiangbei area and fled to Shanghai, hiding in the French Concession. He requested cooperation in apprehending and extraditing him. The Chinese and Western authorities informed the police, who arrested Zhi and handed him over to the court. After interrogation, the court ruled that Zhi should be extradited to the inland authorities for trial. Zhi, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyer Gu Jirong to file an appeal for a retrial. The appeal was granted, and Zhi was summoned yesterday. First, the prosecutor stated that he had received a letter from Gu Jirong, the plaintiff's representative, stating that he had to leave Shanghai due to important matters and requested a postponement of fourteen days. Subsequently, the lawyer representing the Superintendent of Pacification's office stated that the plaintiff's lawyer's request for postponement was strongly opposed. As Zhi Jingui was a wanted criminal, the Superintendent of Pacification's office attached great importance to the case and had sent dozens of officers and soldiers to Shanghai to escort him. If the trial was postponed, they would suffer irreparable losses. He requested that the trial be opened today and that the court order Zhi Jingui to be handed over to the officers to be taken back for trial as soon as possible, to avoid further losses. After consultation, the Chinese and Western judges ordered a postponement of the trial for seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Danyang Kidnapping Victim Still Not Found <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Two More Bandits Arrested, One Handed Over to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Two children from the Wang and Li families in Danyang County were kidnapped by bandits in February. Aside from one bandit captured by local authorities, three male and female suspects were arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the police the day before yesterday and sent to the Special District Local Court. The court ordered that Li Wenxiang be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation, while Liu Dehuai and Li Wei were detained for further verification, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. After being handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Li immediately underwent a preliminary hearing. He confessed that Li Sihong and Ding Shangzhen (also known as Ding San), two Jiangbei natives residing at 126 Tongzhou Road, were also accomplices. Investigator Qin Bin was dispatched to the Harbin police station to cooperate with the Chinese and Western detectives in secretly arresting Li and Ding at the address. Subsequently, according to Sihong's confession, the kidnapped Wang and Li children were hidden in a house at 576 Zhoushan Road. However, when the detectives rushed to investigate, they found that the bandit gang had already fled with the children. Yesterday morning, police officer Li Ding brought investigator Qin Bin to the Special Court to request extradition. After questioning by Judge Luo, Li Sihong was handed over to the officer to be taken back to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation. It remains to be investigated whether Ding Shangzhen was indeed one of the kidnappers in the case, and evidence still needs to be collected. He was ordered to be temporarily detained at the police station, awaiting a joint trial with Liu Dehuai and Li Wei on the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Suzhou Woman Sues General Manager of Jiangnan Bank <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>General Manager Qian Zengbao Absent Due to Illness</p>
<p>Court Orders Defendant to Appear</p>
<p>Yao Shunhua, a 29-year-old woman from Suzhou, had an informal relationship with Qian Zengbao, General Manager of Jiangnan Bank. They initially resided at No. 29, Lane Fai, Rue Lafayette in the French Concession, cohabiting for one year and seven months. Since September of last year, Qian has stopped visiting Yao. Unable to support herself, Yao hired a lawyer to sue Qian for violating Article 244 of the Criminal Code, accusing him of using deception to make a woman believe they had a marital relationship and submitting to his fornication, as well as Article 310, abandoning a person without the ability to support themselves whom he was legally or contractually obligated to assist, support, or protect. She also filed a private suit, demanding that the defendant pay her 60,000 yuan in lifelong alimony. The court issued a warrant for the arrest of Jin Wanrong to Bai Tongli, 598 Rue Beclague, notifying the defendant to appear in court for questioning, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitan of the Second Criminal Division summoned the defendant. Qian Zengbao was absent, and lawyer Jiang Yiping appeared in court on his behalf. Yao Shunhua stated that she had cohabited with the defendant since November of the seventeenth year of the Republic. Qian initially told her that he had no wife at home. Half a year into the cohabitation, she discovered that he already had a legal wife. As things had already progressed, she had no choice. In September of last year, Qian suddenly claimed that her behavior was improper and wanted her to commit suicide. He even gave her opium to take. She swallowed the opium but was later saved. Since then, Qian has not visited her. Unable to support herself, she moved from No. 29, Lane Lafayette, to No. 366, Juqing Lane, Xin Zha Road. She requested that the court rule according to the law. Lawyer Jiang Yiping then stated that the defendant was absent today because he was ill. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately stated that since the defendant had been legally summoned but claimed illness as the reason for his absence, he should provide evidence of his illness. Lawyer Jiang replied that even if the plaintiff's lawyer did not mention the legal summons, he would still have to state that Qian Zengbao did not reside on Rue Beclague but at No. 152, Route du Père Froc in the French Concession. Rue Beclague was the home of his relatives. Furthermore, all the articles of law cited by the plaintiff were inapplicable because she was still young and had not reached the point of being unable to support herself, and she could not prove that she was Qian's wife. According to her, there was no matchmaker, no exchange of birth charts, and, furthermore, the plaintiff was a prostitute. If a prostitute were to sue a customer for abandonment, everyone would feel threatened. This trend should not be encouraged, and the plaintiff's suit should be dismissed. Judge Ge Zhitan, believing that the defendant's presence was necessary, ordered a postponement of the trial to the afternoon of May 30th.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Hu Hongyuan Convicted on Two Counts <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Counterfeit Cigarettes and Illegally Made Seal</p>
<p>Combined Sentence of Seven Months and a Fine of 300 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Consolidated Tax Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance previously discovered that Hu Hongyuan was evading national taxes. Inspectors were dispatched to No. 721, Qipu Road, where they seized several boxes of tax-evading cigarettes, some of which were counterfeit products of the Delon Tobacco Company. Hu was arrested and brought before the Special District Local Court, accused of tax evasion and counterfeiting, as reported in this newspaper. It has now been learned that during the search, a counterfeit seal of the cigarette tax bureau with the words "Examined and Approved" was also found. The police added a charge of illegally making a seal. The tax evasion portion of the case was recently tried by a judge in the Summary Division of the Special Court. The evidence was conclusive. If the case were handled according to the Stamp Tax Regulations, he would have been subject to extremely severe penalties. However, the judge, considering that he was a small businessman who was unaware of the consequences and was a first-time offender, granted leniency and reduced the penalty to twice the amount of tax evaded, ordering him to pay a fine of 112 yuan as a light punishment. As for the counterfeiting and illegally making a seal charges, both were local cases. Judge Luo of the Local Division of the Special Court held a joint trial yesterday morning. After the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin and the Delon Company's representative lawyer Wu Linkun presented the details of the case, Judge Luo questioned the defendant Hu Hongyuan. Finding the evidence in both cases to be sufficient, he immediately pronounced the verdict: three months imprisonment and a fine of 300 yuan for counterfeiting, and six months imprisonment for illegally making a seal, with the sentences to be served consecutively for a total of seven months. The fine was 300 yuan. The counterfeit cigarette seals were confiscated.</p>

<p>The Jinxin Cloth Factory, located on Nancang Street, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, dismissed six workers, including Huang Cai, Gou Jiang Hegen, Chen Afa, Huang Pinzhou, and Yao Zushun, without cause on the 5th of this month.

<h3 id="e263">Property Owners Association Announces Establishment of Conciliation Committee <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Property Owners Association sent a letter to its members and related organizations yesterday, stating: "We, the Association, have observed that rental disputes have been occurring frequently recently. The historical morality of peaceful coexistence between landlords and tenants has been destroyed. Minor disputes lead to animosity, and major disputes lead to lawsuits, causing losses to both parties. The state has now established a mediation process in addition to litigation for civil matters, hoping to restore our country's inherent virtue of peaceful coexistence. Landlord-tenant relationships are civil matters and should be based on kinship. How can they be treated as enemies and engaged in litigation? If reasonable and fair conciliation is carried out, can major disputes not be turned into minor disputes, and minor disputes into no disputes? Based on this principle, a Conciliation Committee has been established. Kui Yanfang, Dou Yaoting, Jiang Bingsheng, Yao Shantao, Liu Hongyuan, Yuan Ludeng, and Zhang Xingcun were elected as committee members to handle disputes between landlords and tenants through conciliation. We are sending this letter for your information and instructions."</p>
<h3 id="e264">Appeal for Disaster Relief in Ningxia <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society recently received a telegram from the Ningxia Provincial Party Headquarters stating: "Our province has long been occupied by the Feng Faction warlords, who have levied heavy taxes, a hundred times more than in the past. They have squeezed the people dry, leaving them unable to survive. When the Feng army collapsed, bandits ran rampant, and people were displaced. Hailstorms, rats, and locusts have caused repeated disasters. The granaries are empty, and food is running out. The extremely poor are starving to death, and the middle class is becoming displaced. Gathering to rob grain and committing suicide by family have become common occurrences. The current disaster situation cannot be fully described, and the future is uncertain. As there are no farming tools in the homes and no grain for seeds, the spring planting will not happen, and the autumn harvest is uncertain. If urgent action is not taken to provide extensive relief, the people of the province will perish. The hidden dangers in the Northwest are unimaginable. We have just arrived in this land and are deeply shocked by what we see. We respectfully present the local disaster situation for your consideration. We respectfully request that you quickly report to the National Government and allocate large sums of money for emergency relief to save the remaining people. The National Government has approved the allocation of 20,000 yuan from the Gansu relief funds, but this is a drop in the bucket and has little effect. Without allocating additional large sums of money, this extraordinary disaster cannot be averted. We implore you to consider the disaster-stricken people and advocate for relief, and we hope that you will generously provide grain to support this righteous cause. We are kneeling and begging on behalf of the millions of starving people in the province. The telegram is urgent. Please give it your attention. Chinese Kuomintang Ningxia Provincial Party Affairs Special Commissioners Fang Deren and Zhang Tianwu."</p>

(2) "Letter inquiring about the interpretation of water fees: We, the Association, sent a letter to your department on February 14th requesting an explanation regarding two points concerning water fees. We have not yet received instructions and are deeply confused. We believe that your department, as the municipal authority within the Settlement, will not disregard this request. Therefore, we are sending this letter again to request your department to provide an explanation as soon as possible. We sincerely hope to hear from you."</p>

<p>The Daily News reports that the workers of the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company recently requested double pay on race days due to the high cost of goods and the difficulty of making a living.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau continued to mediate the dispute over the revision of treatment conditions in the binding industry yesterday morning. Representatives from the labor union, including Xu Fuli, Chen Zhaoqing, and Ren Changfu, and representatives from the trade association, including Ding Handong, Lou Weiqing, and Xu Hanqing, were present. Wang Bing presided over the meeting, and Wang Zhiqin recorded the minutes. After a lengthy discussion, the two sides strongly disagreed on the second item, the apprenticeship issue. The chairman announced that it would be temporarily shelved. The third item, that the employers should not dismiss workers or union officials without cause and that workers must be given one month's notice of dismissal, and the union must be notified at the same time, was passed. However, this does not apply to temporary workers whose employment is less than three months. The same applies to workers who do not wish to work. When hiring workers, preference should be given to unemployed members of the union. However, these unemployed members must be approved by the government as qualified to enjoy this right. The fourth item, working hours, stipulates nine hours per day. Night shift work is five hours for one shift and three hours for half a shift. Sundays are eight hours for one shift. During working hours, workers must not leave the workplace without permission. After the two items were discussed, the meeting was adjourned due to time constraints. It was decided to convene a conciliation committee again at 9:00 AM on the 26th to continue mediation. The Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters were also invited to send representatives to attend.</p>

<p>The other day, Pan Zhiquan hosted a banquet for Xun Huisheng and Yan Jupeng at his villa on Maiyang Road. More than ten people were present, including Wu Jing, Xiong, E Lügong, and Lin Lao Zhuo, Yang Cheche, etc. They exchanged toasts, and the scene was very grand. Everyone present knew that Mrs. Pan was good at singing and encouraged her to try. Mr. Pan suddenly said, "If you really want her to try singing, please allow me to leave for a while." Everyone was surprised by his words. Mr. Pan continued, "It's nothing. As soon as I hear her sing, I feel goosebumps all over my body and can't stand it for a moment. If you must ask her to embarrass herself, I can't refuse, but I must leave for a while." Then everyone burst into laughter and stopped the discussion of singing at the banquet. Since the proposal to sing a song was made, everyone asked Huisheng to sing first. After being asked again and again, she sang two excerpts from the hairpin phoenix and the Lantern Festival riddle. Her voice was round and her words were correct, like pearls rolling on a jade plate. Everyone present applauded. Huisheng is very modest and has the best interpersonal skills. This time, when she came south, she was accompanied by Mr. Shu Sheyu to visit literary giants whom she had never met before. On the evening before going on stage, she specially visited Mr. Cao Mengyu. Mr. Cao has always had a connection with bearded actors. This time, with the introduction of Sheyu, he also agreed to support the performance. In addition, there is a social butterfly in Zhenjiang named Cha Peicang, who is good at singing Qingyi and resembles Yu Shuang, and has been praised by many people. Recently, she changed her plan and wanted to learn from the strengths of various schools and meet the Four Great Vajras. At that time, she happened to be in Shanghai. Hearing that Huisheng was coming, she wanted to see her. Before leaving, she asked Cao, "I have met three of the Four Great Vajras. I have never met Huisheng. Can you introduce me to her? Please write a letter to me. I will come to Shanghai again." From this, we can see the magic power of Huisheng. She is indeed a deep person.</p>

<p>— Xiao Die</p>
<p>My father built a house on the lake, titled "Rest and Recuperate," facing Yu Huang in the distance and next to Su Xiao nearby. The bright windows, twenty-four in total, face the lake, and the scenery is beautiful in rain, moon, wind, and sunshine. My father has already written several lyrics, and Cui Mei is ashamed to respond with poems. I am not literary, so I will write a short poem to record the scenery at that time.</p>
<p>The heavy clouds have not yet closed the surrounding mountains. Poplar catkins and flowers fly all over the ground. The empty courtyard is quiet with no one. Red roses dance wildly on half the wall. A thousand points of oars are rushing in the lake. Waves far suppress Su Gong's embankment. The night in Hangzhou in April is dark. Overcoats are often deceived by the east wind. The season is sometimes cold and sometimes warm. Like a clear or misty mist, it is subtle. The spring breeze can bloom for a few days. Many branches are already sparse on the ground. I urge you to cherish flowers in time. Don't wait for the rain to turn into empty branches. (Lake Tower Rain Arrives)</p>
<p>Woke up to the sound of birdsong. The first sun is in the forest table. The green mountain is bathing for me. We both smile at each other. Open the window and look at the lake. The mirror surface is shining. Who is going to Nanping? Call the boat out early. Gradually far away from the blue sky. The little point at the end of the eye is small. (Sunny day)</p>
<p>The guests in the building left and the moon had not yet risen. Tourists gradually returned as the sun set in the west. Leaning on the railing for a while, all sounds are empty. Reading a book and not sleeping, sitting alone at night. Sparse stars flickering, the lights are there or not. Distant buildings see the lights. The moon gradually brightens towards midnight. I feel that there are people talking in the lake. The water is close at hand, the sky is upside down. Three or five small boats come and go. Not a ghost, not an immortal, can't be picked up. A long flute floats with the mountain rain. (Sitting at night watching the moon)</p>
<h3 id="e288">Unprecedented Rat Disaster <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Ruoweng</p>
<p>Jiao Yitang, a member of the Central Committee and a member of the Legislative Yuan, recently returned from an inspection of Party affairs in Shaanxi. On the 18th, he reported on the strange disaster in Shaanxi at the memorial week of the Legislative Yuan. He said that the tragedy and strangeness of the Shaanxi disaster were unprecedented. Anyone who set foot in Shaanxi, even if blind and deaf, could know the strange tragedy of the disaster. There are 400,000 unburied starved corpses. The stench reached thousands of miles. You can know it by touching your nose. Now the whole of Shaanxi has reached a situation where there is a road but no one walks on it. The former motor road is now full of Artemisia and thorny paths. All you can see is piles of white bones. I don’t know where the cars have gone. As for the reasons for the construction of the Shaanxi disaster, one is locusts, the second is drought, and the third is an unprecedented rat disaster. In an area of ​​Shaanxi, thousands of five-colored rats suddenly appeared within a day. They were everywhere. The big ones were like civets, and the small ones were like ordinary rats. Cats and dogs were startled and avoided them. The mottled colors filled the mountains and fields, to the point that people could not set foot. Within the next day, all crops were lost. After another night, the warehouses were empty. By the morning, the people's food was exhausted and the rats were gone. Those Chinese and Westerners who went to study could not understand where they came from. The villagers said that they were transformed from white insects in cow and sheep dung, but this has not been proven. However, it must not be viviparous. (Viviparity cannot reproduce so quickly.) That can be asserted. As a result, thousands of miles of empty storage. The people were starving. It became an unprecedented strange disaster. Thousands of people died of hunger without coming back. I really don’t know where such a rat disaster came from. However, there are no people left in Shaanxi. When Mr. Jiao spoke, he pointed to the various colors on the wall case as proof, saying that the colors of rat hair are all available and not as simple as those of ordinary rats. Alas. The coming of the catastrophe is so peculiar. It is really unprecedented. What are the scientists going to study from and prevent it from happening again, or to prevent it. That is also the gospel of mankind.</p>
<h3 id="e289">British Girl's Strange Way of Distinguishing Tea Leaves <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Ever since Chinese tea leaves were introduced to various European and Western countries, some Westerners have actually stopped drinking coffee and started drinking tea. Therefore, the sales of tea are also developing day by day. When we walk through major cities in various countries, we can see tea shops everywhere. There is a tea shop in England. The owner of the shop is a young girl named Miss Margaret lrving. When she purchases various tea leaves, she always tries them to identify the taste of the tea. However, because she tries every day, the price of tea she spends is as much as 5,000 pounds a year.</p>
<p>Her method of identifying tea is indeed unique. She can indeed be called the King of Tea Identification. The value of the tea leaves imported into her store every year is more than one million in gold coins. Her business is indeed not small. It is said that after her trial, not to mention being able to identify whether the tea is fresh or not, she can even identify the place of origin. This may be an exaggeration. However, the quality of the tea, after her identification, can indeed not be hidden from her.</p>
<p>Speaking of her method of identifying tea, it is also very interesting. There are many small teapots and teacups prepared in her home. When purchasing, she puts each kind of sample in a small teapot in the same amount. She pours boiling water down. After six minutes, she pours it into a cup and tries it one by one. According to her, the method of identifying tea leaves is that the color is light bronze, and the quality is the best. This is originally her experience, and we cannot help but believe it.</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Arrived in Tokyo on the 6th.</p>
<p>I haven't been to Tokyo for more than ten years. I have heard a lot about the reconstruction after the great earthquake. The city streets and houses are more decent than before. So, with great hope, I paid attention to observing. Cleanliness is an inherent beauty of Japan. As far as the city appearance is concerned, it is indeed great and magnificent, and it is very different from before. The transportation facilities are especially surprising. In addition to the ground railway, there are also elevated railways and underground railways. But there are not many passengers. The streets are not crowded. Not to mention other places, even the busiest Ginza doesn't feel lively at all. Especially the restaurants everywhere, business is very slow. Everyone is talking about the recession. recession</p>
<p>In China, I don't take a car unless it is necessary. When I arrived in Japan, I took a car a lot. Not to show off, the price is really too cheap. In Tokyo, any street has cars that solicit business at any time. The sign says, "One yen in the city" means that within this city, no matter how far the road is, the price is only one yen per ride. In fact, it only costs fifty cents. The so-called one yuan is still a facade.</p>
<p>From Maguan to Tokyo, the stations are extremely dense. There is probably a station every ten minutes. The platforms at each station are extremely long. Even small stations are much longer than the Shanghai station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in our country. But the people at each station that passed were not many, and even fewer goods were seen. When asked why, they all said it was a recession. recession.</p>

<h3 id="e292">Hawthorne's Turning Point Case (23) <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>He suddenly made a gnashing sound and said, "Hey. This is damn killer, it made me suffer so bad. If I see him, I will risk my life and beat him half to death." Hawthorne replied with a smile, "Half dead is too heavy. Discount it in half. That will be enough. —Now take a look. Do you know the man in the suit?" Qiu Kui looked carefully in the direction that Hawthorne pointed. He shook his head suddenly and replied, "I don't know him. Could this person be—" Hawthorne stopped him and said, "Okay. Wait a minute and talk about it." I thought to myself that this person was clearly the evil young man. How could Qiu Kui say he didn't know him? Could it be that he was really an accomplice, deliberately trying to avoid it?</p>
<p>At this time, the waiter brought the dishes one after another. While I was eating, I secretly watched the man and woman across the corner. So no matter whether it was smoked fish or fried meat, I couldn't really tell what it tasted like when it was sent to my mouth. I quietly asked Hawthorne, "What are we going to do now? If we let him go again today, I will be really angry." Hawthorne replied in a low voice, "What do you plan to do?" I said, "I really can't care about legal issues now. I'm prepared to vent my anger first. I'm willing to be subject to criminal sanctions if I hurt him." Hawthorne smiled again, "Where has your sanity gone? Is this action worth it? Please rest assured. Since he used the turning method to fool us, we can also copy it and follow suit. You can be patient for a while. I know that Hawthorne's method of dealing with the same turning method must be to use Qiu Kui. However, Qiu Kui has already denied knowing this person. How can our plan be implemented? Just at this moment, I saw Hawthorne's eyes flash and he quickly took out his wallet from his pocket, ready to pay the bill. His expression suddenly became tense. I looked back and immediately found out the origin of the tension. It turned out that the young man and woman at the corner table had both gotten up and stood up. The man first put a black velvet cloak on the woman. Then a waiter also put a coat on the man. The coat was exactly gray Qing tweed. There were also square stripes. A copper pot hat was also dark brown. It was exactly the same as what I saw that night. The two people put on their clothes. The woman was in front and the man followed behind. Then they went out through the glass door.</p>

There was a slight rise and fall afterwards, hovering around 90 taels. At noon, it became more expensive and actually rushed out of 95 taels. It was actually due to the efforts of large households, and the drafts were particularly strong. Finally, the situation calmed down slightly, but the big news this morning should see a decline.

Very few banks settled, and various transactions in silver dollars in the market were far less than usual, which shows the current trend of laziness.

<p>Fluctuations are stable and the transaction amount is 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt futures market was slightly flat compared to the previous day, while the spot market remained bleak. Various prices in the morning market fluctuated very steadily, and the afternoon market was even more stagnant. As the end-of-month settlement period approached, the buying sentiment in the market was weak, and prices continued to decline. However, apart from the 20-year customs tax due in June, which continued to fall by 1 yuan, and the编遣約, which fell by 8-9 jiao, other stocks mostly fell by only 2-3 jiao. The total spot transactions for the day were only 6,400 yuan. The total futures transactions were over 15.5 million.</p>

<p>The yarn market is firm, with the contraction of the exchange rate and the soaring gold price creating a positive atmosphere. At the same time, actual sales are still developing well. There is a strong intention to buy in the north, and there is also development in Guangdong. Therefore, the market atmosphere is becoming more lively. However, the price of American cotton grade 3 yarn is trending down due to the impact of the exchange rate, so sellers still have no intention of short selling and the pressure is still strong. However, a certain manufacturer has a firm attitude and an extremely strong intention to receive goods. As for the sellers, they are also very bullish, so the May contract shows a stalemate between both sides.</p>

<p>The opening of the man-made fiber market was due to weak American cotton and a gold price increase of more than ten taels, which created a firm sentiment and the market turned stronger. Prices for all months rose by 8-9 mace to one tael. In the afternoon, the gold bullion firms were actively covering their short positions, and prices for all months rose by 3-4-5 mace. The transaction volume was 24,850 bales. It was found that DAFU sold 1,550 bales, He Shenji 600 bales, Deji 700 bales, 900 bales, Hengde 1,000 bales, Shenji 600 bales, and Deji 700 bales.

<p>The cotton market is trending stronger, with a very sharp upward trend. With the gold price soaring to nearly 800 taels, although there is sufficient delivery this month, some manufacturers are receiving goods. At the same time, spot sales were better yesterday, and the appetite of various factories has opened up slightly, leading to a sudden increase in morale. Japanese merchants also have the intention to buy in, making the situation very tense. Therefore, it has increased by 5-6 mace. In short, because the bottom goods are too dry, in the era of aged goods, the changes are getting faster.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Then it weakened due to a smooth forecast for the west.

British cotton futures rose by 5 points, and the spot price rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton's spot price rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm due to good news from Liverpool.

<p>"客秈" remains in poor condition. After the recent upward surge, the source of train rice is gradually increasing. The supply at HeXia is旺, and the market has seen a downturn. With falling prices, both 客囤 sides are eager to sell, and the market continues to decline. Yesterday, the transactions on Japan Street were still acceptable, but the price fell by another small 5 fen. 650 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were sold at a price of 11 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen to 11 yuan, and 90 bags of machine yuan rice were sold at a price of 12 yuan and 5 jiao. 200 bags of Nanjing machine rice were sold at a price of 10 yuan and 4 jiao. There were no transactions by 客帮. "洋米" is difficult to set prices due to the expensive gold price. The sentiment is slightly positive. 100 tons of goods returning to the market were sold at a price of 5 taels, 3 qian, and 1 fen, which is 1 fen higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e319">Active Buying in the Flour Market <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices in various months were good by 2-3 jiao due to the good quotes for foreign wheat. There was also a light rain before the market opened, so the sentiment was quite tense at the beginning. Near and far terms were about 1 fen better than the previous day. However, because the actual sales group's attitude was very silent, speculators in the market also temporarily sold short, so the market atmosphere suddenly turned weak and was similar to the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the booming gold price in the morning and the increasingly low exchange rate caused the initially silent sentiment to shake again. The buying enthusiasm was similar to that at the beginning of the week (the whole city reached more than 1.4 million). The opening prices of each contract rose steadily. Judging from this situation, if the weather does not clear, the continued good performance can be expected. As a result, the current month rose by 1 fen and 7 li and a half compared to the previous day, June and July rose by 2 fen and 7 li and a half, August rose by 3 fen, September rose by 2 fen and a half, and October rose by 2 fen and 7 li and a half.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the prices of various months were higher by 3-4 fen due to the cloudy and rainy weather and the good quotes for foreign wheat. However, after the weather cleared, the bulls sold off, and the prices fell by 2-3 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was increasingly difficult to set the price for foreign wheat due to the sharp rise in the gold price. The general inland gangs, due to the weather, were actively buying in, causing the quotes for each month to rise again. In the end, the current upward trend started due to the bad weather, and recently it has been driven by the gold market. The so-called "when it rains, the house leaks", and there are still many disturbances ahead. As a result, the current month rose by 5 fen compared to the previous day, June rose by 6 fen, July rose by 4 fen, August rose by 5 fen, September rose by 4 fen, and October rose by 3 fen.</p>

<p>The various 划盘 prices rose uniformly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegrams showed that the Cuban current sugar price had not changed. The New York sugar futures price for September was 22, December was 1.30, each falling by 1 fen compared to the previous telegram. The price for March next year was 1.37, falling by 2 fen. The current and futures prices of Java sugar remained unchanged. In the association market 划盘, due to the rising exchange rate and increasing buying enthusiasm, the prices of outgoing goods rose sharply. The成交價 for荷 sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was 11 taels, 0 qian, 7 fen and a half to 1 qian, Hong Kong goods were 11 taels, and the trading was quite lively. The market situation was extremely good. No. 20 medium sand white was 10 taels and 6 qian and a half, with both entry and exit being sluggish. Japanese sugar rose at the same time, and the sharpness of the trend had the impression of a rapid rise. N was 11 taels, 1 qian to 1 qian and a half. TK was at the same price. SH was 10 taels and 8 qian. T was 11 taels, 4 qian, 7 fen and a half to 5 qian. YT was 11 taels. YRO was 10 taels and 6 qian. Minghua goods were 10 taels and 6 qian and a half.

The factory market had Central Factory opening 5,000 bags of Japanese sugar AEAR due in June and July, with a price of 4 yuan, 4 jiao, and a half for Japanese gold, and the market situation was stable. The 號盘 had domestic Huanggangqing opened several hundred bags yesterday, with a price of 8 taels and 2 qian per yuan. Because the inventory was particularly thin and the output from the production area was not旺, the market price rose but remained attractive.</p>

<p>Quanzhou large 泉泡桂圆 has recently been rising in the Shanghai market, and the new flower seedlings in the local area are very rare. It is expected that the harvest will be poor, so the ground price suddenly increased by 5-6 yuan. The inventory of goods is also not much. Yesterday, the Xinyuanan Wheel entered from the Quanzhou port, carrying only three hundred boxes, so the sentiment is even more stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market remained lifeless. It was found that overseas silk prices had fallen sharply, and telegrams reported a gloomy situation. Chinese silk merchants, considering the extremely low silk prices and the huge losses incurred, adopted an increasingly passive attitude. Yesterday, only Berthold &amp; Jennings handled eleven bales of Huang Yao silk, and Hsiang Lee handled five bales of coarse Huang silk, with prices continuing to weaken.</p>

<p>Overall, only about 30% remains... Cocoon prices are high, at sixty yuan.</p>
<p>In various towns and villages in Xiaoshan, such as Kanshan, Toupeng, Shushan, Shanxinan, and Guali, this year's early silkworms suffered purely from adverse weather conditions, and the late silkworms also suffered losses of 60% due to unfavorable climate. New cocoons have already been put on the market, with only a dozen or so cocoon trading houses open. The quality of the cocoons is inferior, and the price of superior cocoons is high. Improved breeds of cocoons were already being sold for sixty yuan yesterday.</p>

<p>Sales of tea leaves from Shexian County have always relied heavily on shops and firms. Last year, flower tea from the southeast and northern China sold extremely well. Therefore, shops and firms were very eager to stock up on tea. In addition, this year's new tea was picked early, and the goods were of excellent and tender quality. Those shops and firms searching for supplies were particularly enthusiastic, driving market prices up to hundreds of yuan, a record high. Foreign firms are now wary of the soaring market prices. Furthermore, they observe that the new tea from Sui'an County, which local Shanghai firms are processing into Chun Mee tea, is selling at prices similar to last year. Since the cost is higher than before, but the selling price remains the same, the losses are obvious. Foreign tea firms, faced with this situation, see that the market trend is too strong to reverse or reduce prices, and they can only limit purchases as a temporary strategy.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a surge in prices occurred, with fine cloth being the strongest. The reasons are the low silver prices, the rapid rise in the gold market, and the consequent increase in commodity prices. In addition, a large quantity of fine cloth has already been purchased by Tianjin merchants, and this month's goods are almost exhausted. Therefore, all brands have increased by five cents. Blue Flying Fish is priced at seven taels and nine mace, Trumpet Boy at seven taels and five mace, Colored Ball at seven taels and four mace and five candareens, and Blue Chicken at seven taels and two mace and five candareens. Fine twill has increased by two and a half cents. Sentiment towards coarse cloth has also slightly improved. Eleven-pound Three Rabbits and Three Deer are both priced at five taels and four mace, and thirteen-pound Double Flags at six taels and six mace and five candareens. Jardine Matheson's blue-striped bleached cloth and Golden Pagoda bleached cloth are consistently in short supply, while sales of coarse twill remain sluggish.</p>

<p>The market situation yesterday was such that, due to the soaring gold prices, all goods rose rapidly. Fine broadcloth was higher by about one cent. Lakeside Pavilion now requires three mace and three candareens and five cash, and Three Friends Picture requires three mace and two candareens and five cash. Bao Qiu (Precious Ball) goods are still out of stock. Straight tribute flannel, Mount Mogan, Hunting Goose, Double Boy, and Deer are consistently out of stock. Tianjin merchants purchased twenty-five pieces of Three Friends Picture at a price of three mace and two candareens. Yue Hua cloth is increasingly expensive, with large patterned cloth priced at two mace and three candareens and five cash, and medium and small patterned cloth priced at two mace and three candareens. The speed of the increase was truly unexpected. Cotton flannel from Changsha merchants saw considerable purchases, with Yang Guifei (Consort Yang) red priced at two mace and three candareens, and Wu Meiren (Black Beauty) in concubine color priced at two mace and two candareens. Yuan Yu silk also rose yesterday, with Bamboo Forest priced at eleven taels and seven mace and five candareens. However, white crepe remains stable, mainly because the remaining stock is still abundant.</p>

<p>As the exchange market fell frequently in the past few days, the cost of various metal goods increased by one or two cents of cash in an invisible way. Local merchants, aware of this, are holding firm on prices. Therefore, yesterday, the standard of all goods was raised considerably. British tinplate has already risen by one mace and five candareens, selling for sixteen taels and two mace. Pig lead has increased by two mace, selling for fifteen taels and eight mace and five candareens. Over four hundred bars were traded yesterday, purchased by merchant groups from Sichuan and Tianjin. British steel plates, seven and a half cents thick, can also be sold for six taels and seven mace and five candareens. The asking price for eighteen sheets of black iron sheet has risen to twelve taels. It is said that six or seven hundred bundles were sold, mostly to enamel factories. Flat white iron corrugated sheet The market situation was improving yesterday due to hoarding by speculators. New iron wire, new lead wire, and French nails previously had little trade, and the market situation was weak and the standard was weakening. Recently, due to good sentiment, the market price has rebounded, with French nails estimated to sell for nine taels and two mace and five candareens, new lead wire for fourteen taels, and new iron wire for fourteen taels and two mace and five candareens. In addition, the market situation for other iron products is related to sentiment, and all are showing an upward trend.</p>

<p>Beipiao bituminous coal dust has a large market in the Tianjin area, so its arrival and dispatch here have been rare for a long time. As of yesterday, the Chang'an Shipping Line brought 1,700 tons, which were unloaded at the Beipiao Main Warehouse. However, this batch of goods is only for the company to deliver orders to various factories. Although there is a market price, it is still quite difficult to buy a small amount.</p>

<p>— Heart</p>
<p>The Chinese people have never paid much attention to the art of photography, so it is inevitable that we lag behind others in this field. This is a very sad phenomenon. In recent years, it seems that more people are paying attention to it, but their purpose is mostly to photograph beautiful modern girls, taking such pictures to gain economic benefits. Their purpose is not to study the art of photography, but for personal material gain.</p>
<p>The China Public Photography Research Association was organized by Wang Xiangqin, Cao Jiji, Xie Chengbing, Tang Ouzhou, and others. They are all very interested in photography and have a considerable amount of research. The association has been established for more than a year and has already had good results during this time. They exhibit their daily photographic achievements once a week, and have already exhibited more than twenty times. Each exhibition has been praised by students.</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to exhibiting their achievements at the school, they have published their more successful works in publications such as "The Young Companion" and "China Pictorial" in order to provide them for the appreciation of the majority.</p>
<p>Chinese photography is far behind Western photography. I hope that friends who are interested in photography will work hard and not only catch up with Western photography, but also surpass them. As long as we are willing to study hard, progress will be rapid.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my sincere hope that the members of the China Public Photography Research Association will work harder to seek deeper learning. At the same time, I hope that friends at home who are interested in photography will respect art and never disregard everything solely for personal gain.</p>
