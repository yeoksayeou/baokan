<h3 id="c28">今後敎育上基本問題之討論（四） <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>敎育家時時在敎育靑年。而同時其本身又時時在受現實環境之敎育。故現實環境。即現實事實。實爲敎育家正確而有力之批評。亦即爲敎育家正確而充實之敎材。敎育家應基於本身之責任。而接受客觀的批評。更應依於時代的要求。而接受事實的敎訓。</p>
<p>一提三問題。吾人已加以事實與理由之申述矣。往者不必咎如何打破現實如何加以改進。乃爲今日敎育家當前之重責。記者謹更述管見藉貢蒭蕘關於第一問題所述現象之改正。其重心端在於敎育家之本身。敎育家應時時體念其本身對於民族社會前途所負之重責。視敎育。重視責任。此種責任之自覺要爲敎育家之基本道德基本條件如能重事敎育。則不至以敎育事業爲解决生活之工具。以學校爲互相攘奪之政治舞台。以學生爲利用與嗾使之爭鬥武器。如能重視責任。則不至以敷衍保全地位。優容結納學生。保守現實。或更辯護現實。夫使敎育家重其所事。重其所負之責。處處爲學生着想。爲民族與社會着想。時時作自我之批評。時時接受境與事實之敎訓。則敎育上之一切設施。自皆能有確定之目的。事先之計劃。敎育之效能。自亦克應時代之要求而增高。</p>
<p>第二問題所述現象之改正。在於敎育家應時時環顧其四週之貧苦大衆。時時顧及其四週之貧苦子弟。時時注意及中華民國約法第五章第四十八條「男女敎育之機會一律平等」之規定。固然。敎育機機平等之實現。要非敎育家一方面所能爲力。但最低限度。敎育家應盡其心。盡其力。爲貧苦子弟多造求學機會。清光緒三十二年以前之書院與學堂。不特不收學宿等費。而且有膏炎等之津貼。雖清代之科舉學堂同爲愚民政策。而其普予貧苦子弟以求學之機會。則亦實有足多者在。往事未遠。現在何以遂不能倣行示世界各國以中國特立獨立之精神退一步言。在約法第五五十七條中曾規定。有「全國公私立學校。應設置免費及獎金學額。以獎進品學俱優無力升學之學生」之明文。切實遵行。即所以爲貧苦子弟造機會。亦即所以盡其心與力。目前國内南開東北兩大學。已設有獎金學額。負有敎育之責者。其曷急起而聲應。至於第三問題所述現象之改正。應切實使敎育中國化。應求其合於我國之國民經濟力。合於我國之社會狀况。合於我民族與社會之切實要求。此問題在國民會議所議决之確定敎育設施之趨向一案中。曾有痛切之指陳。同時曾有「中小學敎育應體察當地社會情况。一律養成獨立生活之技能。與增加生產之能力爲中心。務使大多數不能升學學生。皆有自立之能力。」及「社會敎育應以增加生產爲中心目標。就人民現有之程度與實際生活。輔助其生產智識與技能之增進。」等敎育方案之確立。方案旣定。力求實行。則敎育家之責。亦即所以改正第三問題所述之現象也。</p>
<p>凡在所述。固都爲今日我國政治問題之一部分。但整個政治問題未得適當之解决以前。此種關係民族前途至大之部分。固亦不能竭吾人之心力。以求其改進。在上吾人已有言。「敎育之使命爲對現實求進步。爲追求比現實較高較遠之理想。」最後記者仍謹鄭重以此意獻致今日我國之敎育界。</p>

<p>邱飛海（中）六比二六比一六比○里特（坎）</p>
<p>德孚（坎）六比二六比三六比四江道章（中）</p>
<p>邱飛海隨手克敵中坎之戰、邱飛海里特兩人首當其衝、坎拿大以里特充第一單打似有取巧之嫌、不應出者、以邱之技、勝里特問題不生、惟邱之表演、昨未臻最佳、境或因敵弱之故、精彩遂因之大損、邱發球、勝一局、里亦得一局、由是而二二平分、繼邱連得四局勝第一盤、第二盤里特僅勝第二局一、局第三盤則全軍覆没、邱昨日不甚用勁、野時見、犧牲不回拍之球亦多、殆爲保留氣力之故、入後曾有數次極準之邊角球猛抽、甚爲可觀、里臂力甚大、發球邱拍有一次彈中、而竟不能回答、惜雙錯誤疊出、自殺觸網之球、不一而足、最一盤似已無心戀戰矣、</p>
<p>江道章力抗德孚江德繼邱里作戰德之高深球藝、昨乃大顯、江初曾小心作戰、擬謀一抗、及戰方知不可比儗、此組擊法花樣較多、兩人時時奔上攔網、而德孚網上之反手壓殺、其勢旣順有力而美觀揮手甚熟、江則時有觸網及野球發球之雙錯、誤常使勝局反敗、德球之峻急、尤最令人注意、第一盤江於一比五後、方又勝一局、二比六終、第二盤、江似見振作、造三比三數、惜又連失三局、三比六又敗、第三盤亦於三比三後、再失二局、又挽回一局成六比四而敗、二三兩盤希望較、大惜皆未先成功爲憾、江之球藝、已較往日大進步矣、</p>

<p>俵積雄（日）六比二六比四六比一卡那凡洛（葡）</p>
<p>町田（日）六比二六比○六比二H柯拉沙（葡）</p>
<p>卡那凡洛佼計未售日本葡萄牙一組、第一單打卡那凡洛對日本俵積、雄卡知俵之抽擊任何人、不能與抗、故一二兩盤、用輕落進擊之法、使俵氏遠近狂奔、然有時遇輕、常有不能過網、俵氏則站位甚適當、均能接應、故計終不售、俵氏一遇機會即施猛抽第三盤卡知已歸失效、與之對抽、終以敗北、第二盤卡曾以四比三佔先、惜失敗三局曾敗、第三盤僅第五局得一局、甚矣俵氏之難敗、也</p>
<p>柯拉沙大敗於町田戰前柯拉沙似可勝町田、結果則不然、蓋日人善於長抽、柯氏亦以抽對之、何能不敗、柯有時上前攔網、不得力不得法、常不能制人死命、於是大敗於日人抽擊之下、第一盤柯失三局後奪回二局、以二比六敗第二盤片甲不歸第三盤二二平手後、再以二比六敗、</p>

<p>仍未談判全體售票員於二十日起、相率罷工後、經罷工委員會提出待遇條件九條、當日派代表五人赴公司談判、因車務總管不予接受、前昨二日罷工委員會、並未派代表前往接洽、堅持繼續罷工、故一時尙難解决、</p>
<p>各路情形昨日公共汽車仍由查票員代行售票職務、駛出一路靜安寺至公園靶子塲十輛、二路二洋涇橋至公園靶子塲六輛、五路三芧閣橋至北站三輛、九路靜安寺至電燈廠十輛、A特别快車一輛C特快車一輛、共計三十一輛、行駛時間、自晨六時起至晚八時止、其餘三·六·七·十等路公共汽車、因無人售票仍在停駛中、</p>
<p>今日停駛英商中國公共汽車公司昨由車務總管西人敝特來（譯音）出佈告云、「本月二十三日各職員給予特假一日星期一照常服務、此佈、」因由勉强行駛之一二五九路公共汽車、今日亦停公共租界公共汽車、今日完停駛明日起售票員工潮如仍未解决、則仍由查票員代行職務、勉强行駛數路、</p>
<p>另雇新工公司於二十日上午開董事會議後、除設法恢復各路、公共汽車外、聞曾請總巡捕房另招新售票員、昨日總巡捕房已僱就數十人、於上午送康腦脫路二六三號該公司總廠内訓練、俟訓練完竣、即將分别派赴各路公共汽車工作、</p>
<p>當局防範市公安局六區長任履平、自英商公共汽車售票員罷工後除派員澈查外、並派長警連日駐守康腦脫路總廠附近、以資防範、因該處係工部局越界築路、故戈登路捕房、亦派巡捕駐守該處防範、</p>
<p>工人釋放本月二十一日上午六時滬西康腦脫路膠州路口、被戈豋路捕房拘入之新售票員兩人、係　四五號及二四零號、經捕頭詢問後、聞已釋放、</p>

<p>俄人勒味司蓋·畢克·華人韋小蘭·串同冒充國府官吏、向英商來發洋行訂購價値一百八十餘萬元之軍火、並僞造印文變造文書、又以恐嚇手段、意圖向求新廠主朱子堯詐財、經捕房提起公訴、業經第一特院數度傳訊、諭候定期開始辯論各情、已誌本報、昨晨由承審刑庭長許家栻君開刑一庭續訊、首詢畢克、尙有何言、畢操英語答復、由蔣葆良譯員譯稱、我本有許多言語、但所有重要文件、悉在代理律師普蘭梅（法籍）處、今普律師因我無力繳付訟費、今日即不出庭、文件亦未歸還似此情形、實與律師道德、大有妨碍今亦另無他言云云、庭上遂諭令</p>
<p>開始辯論首由捕房代理汝葆彝律師起而辯稱、本案捕房控訴勒味司蓋·畢克·犯刑法一百六十五條僭行民國公務員職權罪、同法二百二十四條變造文書罪、同法三百七十條恐嚇詐財罪、並加控勒個人犯刑法二百三十四條僞造印文罪、韋小蘭則控以刑法一百六十五條三百七十條之罪、在未曾辯論被告犯罪之前、將</p>
<p>提出二點請庭上注意、然與本案則無關係、因被告律師必欲提及、故敝律師先行提出、（一）來發是否爲販賣軍火者、假定確係出售軍火者、則彼是否違法、或犯英國法律因捕房並未起、訴姑不置論、（二）來發是否將軍火售於粵人、若以高調論之、必謂來發不助國府而助粵方於國際上更有他論、然於本案則毫無關係、亦可勿論、今就被告</p>
<p>犯罪事實加以辯論、即現須研究張發英是否有無其人、即有其人則確係張發英本人乎、但捕房以爲决無其人、即有亦係假冒因根據共犯韋小蘭之供詞、韋謂勒·畢·二被告前曾向其云爾不能充作軍長、祇可作秘書、此點當然不解自破、茲再進一步研究勒·畢·二被告是否有僭行公務員職、權因被告至原告處、謂係國府軍事顧問、而國府確有此等職位、故不論其何人、均屬犯罪、然韋小蘭冒充張發英軍長之秘書、實可不必辯論、因其</p>
<p>業已自白也、至各被告是否至來發處、業由來發卡羅等相繼證明、則其僭行公務職權、事實已甚明顯、至變造文書一點、因合同上於證人字樣之前加保人字樣、對於保人之字被告所提出合同一紙、有此字樣、兩原告提出之合同、則無擔保字樣、前次業經捕房鑑定人證明、被告提出之合同上保人字樣、係屬以後加上、在加上保人字樣之後、則證人卡羅·朱子堯·責任、大不相同矣、英國法律、證人祗證明訂立合同、並無詐欺恐嚇情形、美國之法律亦然而</p>
<p>中國法律自必相同、而保人之責任則不同、保人在合同不能履行時、當負責履行之、是以證人不能兼任保人、若保人而兼證人、乃一發生訟爭、保人祗須以證人資格向庭上謂訂合同、確有詐欺恐嚇情形、則該合同自必不能發生效力、保人亦可不負責任、故英國法律規定頗嚴、保人不能兼作證人、且原告係屬英人、而所訂合同、又屬英人、原告豈不知此理、而原告又非第一次訂立合同、可見</p>
<p>被告變造無疑、再論被告等僞造印文一點、業經美泰印務局店主夥計證明勒司蓋往該印刷所、着照來發之圖章照刻一枚、更有捕房探員證明勒經取圖章時、在來發洋行信紙上、加蓋該印、雖被告絕對否認、然以證據確屬無可抵賴、彼等所以要進行此種犯手、續實欲達到其</p>
<p>恐嚇詐財之目的彼等以爲原告出售軍火、當另以方法向之詐財要知某甲偷竊他人財物、乙即搶奪之、而甲所犯者爲竊盜、乙所犯者爲搶奪罪、决不能謂甲所有之物、係屬竊來搶之當不犯法、初捕房對於本案十分疑惑、及韋小蘭被拘、案始大白、更有施卓人律師證明被告委任施律師向朱子堯</p>
<p>索取佣金當時施律師向朱言爾係保人、自應負擔責任、且此項軍火、以了結爲佳、在施律師以爲並無恐嚇言詞、然在朱子堯方面、則已認爲極端恐嚇、故被告實犯恐嚇詐財之罪、請求庭上對於勒味司蓋·畢克·依法從重處斷、至韋小蘭亦有</p>
<p>帮助行爲亦請加以處罪云云、繼由范剛律師代表韋小蘭辯稱、韋事前並未知情、事後即不願前往、致發生爭吵之事、故請庭上宣告無罪云云、繼由畢克·勒味司蓋·之律師裘汾齡、依法爲二被告辯護、要點有二（一）軍事顧問並無職守、不能認爲僭行公務員職權、（二）變造文書等、不能直接證明爲被告等所爲、故不能成立、請求宣告無罪云云、許家栻庭長遂宣告辯論終結、定八月廿九日上午宣判、</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>鬚的故事</p>
<p>在古代的東方的民族。有一種很深的迷信。以爲一個男子的鬚髯是榮耀的表示。而要懲罰人時。便是强迫分薙去鬚髯并將頭髮剪短。但看阿西利亞ASSYRIA古代的雕刻。所刻的帝王之像都是長長的鬚子。飄柫胸前。他們的頭髮。也總是長長的。而伺候在左右的奴隷却連一根鬚子都没有。把臉面刮得很光。頭髮也剪得極短彼此貴賤之分當然一看就看出來了。</p>
<p>埃及人的意見。却又與阿西利亞人不同。他們以爲鬚髮都是齷齪的東西。非將頭部與臉部完全薙光不可。他們的奴隷和僕人們也被迫照辦不許留長。</p>
<p>古代的希臘人與羅馬人因和仇人交手鬥爭時。往往鬚子被揪大大的吃虧。因此都將鬚子薙去。據說亞歷山大王SLEXANDERTHEGREAT嚴令他的兵士們薙鬚。也就爲了這個緣故。</p>
<p>羅馬舊俗。男子們二十一歲。即須將鬚子薙下貢獻於家中的神像之前。過了這年紀而再留鬚子時。那是遇到家人死亡的事了。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>中華全國道路建設協會。創立迄今。已有十載。本年九月十二日起。舉行路市展覽會三星期。前日王正廷會長特邀請中西人士。討論進行方法。席上所述。趣聞甚多。爰誌一二如下。</p>
<p>王正廷口眼不閉　王正廷謂國家之於道路。猶人身之於血脈血脈。不流通。其人必死。道路不發展。其國難强。前在北平時。曾遇西友述及我國交通不便。渠有數語。予永矢勿忘。渠謂譬如西藏有人送兩袋麵粉與予。欲予帶回北平。予情願由北平拍電至美京定購麵粉兩袋。蓋西藏至北平。交通不便。此兩袋麵粉。沿途須令駱背負。須僱小車裝運。貨雖贈與但所耗運費。反較在美定購來之麵粉價値爲高貴。雖係戲言`確是實情。故鄙人發起全國道路建設協會時。曾有一志願。擬協助政府與地方。將全國各省道路建築後。自乘汽車。在全中國各行省環遊一週。能達到此目的。則死亦無憾。經本會提倡後。已成之路。約十一萬餘里。但我國幅圓遼闊。欲乘汽車環遊。爲期尙遠。苟不達此目的。則予死後口眼不閉。希望諸君對於築路運動`努力宣傳云云。聽者軒渠。</p>
<p>林康侯恐防熱昏　該會總幹事吳山。當衆報告。謂此次所開路市展覽會。入塲劵共印十萬張。每張售洋一元。以售得之費。補助開會用費劵由中西人士各銷五萬。華人方面經林康侯君担任。甚爲感激。王正廷因林君如是熱心。不勝欽佩。堅請其起立賜敎。林謂今日天氣炎熱。諸君又將高帽子戴予頭上。不能勝任。恐將熱昏。鄙人此次加入本會。担任總務組主任者。因近來我國事事不上軌道。欲上軌道。須先築路。故對於銷票一層。曾有意見貢獻。並非五萬張劵完全由我獨任。仍須分請各界。代爲推銷。近悉王部長與子廉二君。已各認一萬張。則鄙人之仔肩。已卸去五分之二。其餘請會長出面。柬邀各界蒞會勸購。諒容易設法也</p>
<p>張之江語不忘本　該會因副會長蔣百器去世後。敦請張之江繼任副會長張謂築路與地方治安大有關係。譬如士匪來襲擊時。一二小時内能調集相距百餘里之軍隊。則勦滅甚易。如道路不築。交通不便。相距百餘里之軍隊。須一二日内始能會集者。則土匪出其不意。早已飽掠潛逃。無從追緝。地方受其糜爛矣。僉謂張君近任江蘇綏靖督辦。正在江北辦理勦匪事宜。三句不離本行。足徵其對於本身職務之關心。</p>

<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>憶明人題百駿圖云。九十九中皆汗血。當頭一個是龍媒。名句也。此次高等考試得士朱雷章以下九十九人。竊意錯分之劉君。必補入`合爲百駿。雖龍媒未知誰屬。而九十九固汗血名駒矣。故政府待遇。備極優隆。授證之日。百僚陪位。禮儀旣肅。訓勉有加。普贈則有銀質紀念之章。特獎則有總理全集建國月刋之册。邵元冲院長·張默君女士復贈鏡題書扇。異數也。至於謁陵之禮。同於釋菜。鞾林之宴。無異瓊林。又聞擬於陵前立紀念碑。則唐雁塔明太學進士題名遺意也。諸生復設同年會。是今後赴。聞黨誼一項。固可添新。而年誼一項。亦不廢舊矣。總之科名佳活。國人榮之。幸運哉九十九人也。然而向隅而泣。尙有百五十人在。百五十人者何。即上年試院一次考試及第之法官是也。是役也。招考自司法院始。而典試由考試院終。立法院有専案焉。期間雖分兩年。考試實同一次。故今年五項考試。獨缺司法一項以此。考試院授百五十人證。咨司法院令司法部。設立専所。訓練復訓練實習又實習。限定年半。作爲候補推檢。論成績殆過於新進之九十九人。顧榮典一不之及。何以饜靑年競勝之心。而表示國家重視司法人選之意乎。所員晤愚。有若悻悻者。愚首糾正之曰。士崇實學。不尙虚文。漢桓榮侈陳車服。夸示稽古之榮。王磐山讀通鑑論鄙之。此宋韓魏公及第不肯簪花。卒爲大儒名臣也。愚又慰藉之曰。掄才榮典。所以重遺敎。勵士氣。新視聽。示方來。開國之初。規模剏。日不暇給。容有疏漏。拾遺補闕。必有辦法。詎有六項取士。隆重其五而冷落其一者。二三子少安勿躁何如。</p>

<p>— 鄒今適</p>
<p>不侫走滬杭。僕僕已五易其寒署。此次奉慈命告假回里。赤禍橫流。十室九空。嚮稱浙東樂土。埝將安在。聞見所及。聊誌一二。</p>
<p>吾邑（瑞安）南渡飛雲江三十里爲平陽。河輪半日往返。平陽固山明水媚之鄉。而風俗淳厚。物產富饒。甲於東南。客歲五月問。該地原駐有省防軍一連於城北城隍廟廟。有無常活偶像獰惡可怖。邑人以其至靈。供香火甚殷。自駐軍後。邑人不得入廟者數月。是月二十六日午前。省防軍奉命開拔。士卒多負槍待發。適該隊某隊長之槍忽失所在。乃四出尋覓。約二小時之久。始於無常神座下獲見。而時已至正午。遂就廟炊爨。正在午餐。忽報匪至當是時。爲匪導者欲導匪至此繳械。不意路迷。官軍即乘此相率豋城。舉槍射擊。一槍一彈。毫無虚放。赤匪數百。無一倖免。當軍匪交戰之際。官軍恐寡不敵衆。遣使請兵於吾邑。使者往返僅一小時。其尤奇者是日大雨竟夕。匪所携柴油引火等物。皆不得燃燒。或有澆油於柴。縱火燬屋。則火柴忽失所在。迨出屋則仍有之。如此往返者再。匪怒甚。擊屋而已。是役也。殺敵數百。而官軍僅斃一卒。亦云幸矣。</p>
<p>令通曰平陽之獲轉危爲安者。有數異焉。始則軍隊失槍誤時。致有兵殺敵。一異也。繼則導者迷路。致不得繳械。二異也。次即火柴忽失所在。致不得縱火。三異也。次則殲敵數百。僅斃一卒。四異也有此四異。故平陽人每傳爲神助云。</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>余曾爲文本報。述朱詠葵君之鐫牙絕技聞者奇之。惟尙有未盡者。特再記之如次。</p>
<p>朱君於方寸面積之牙件上。可鐫三千字。故非目光所能辨認。須假極精顯微鏡之力。方可尋其勁秀整齊之字跡。但朱君於鐫字時。則未嘗或假鏡力之助。蓋研鍊十餘年。已入化境矣。尤奇者。君鐫字之刀。與普通鐫字所用者無異。不知大刀闊斧。何以能鐫細如蟻足之文字也。</p>
<p>余嘗見其爲某君鐫一牙戒。戒面鐫「愛之誓言」約數百字。蓋某將以持贈其愛人。永誌不忘也。其他如扇骨。烟嘴。表墜象箸等件。均可鐫字於上。亦至有趣。</p>
<p>君除擅鐫牙外。復擅鐫竹。藝亦精妙。聞近將於學務之暇。以其鐫技供諸同好。已由友輩代定潤例。每字二角。愛其藝術者。可逕往國立音樂専科學校與君面洽云。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>十一日應印度大學之請。參與其舉行建築VIWANATB廟之典禮。維須那者。世界主人之義也。印度人名幾無一不存征服世界之念。此其一耳。其爲何神何年代。則不可知也。是日有風。鹿土不少。在大學空。地起一大布棚。到者一萬餘人。女界亦不少。會場以外。爲麥田。正在刈麥。旁有樹。人多上樹以瞻仰開會之景。余到已晚矣惟見主席者乃一赤身不掛寸絲之光蛋。此處眞光蛋也。與各會所見者不同。各會光蛋。尙有一寸許布圍之。此光蛋并生殖器均現父母眞身。坐于正位爲主席。身披各花圈。頭髮尙後捲成髻。如中國之道士。然彼眞有道矣。中國道士皆假人。此乃眞人也。名KRISH丨NASHRM。約四十餘。黑鬚數寸目有光身肥而皮黑厚蓋久與自然同化也。彼于萬人中。生殖器亦露于外。余見之甚清楚。此蓋天下第一大神仙也。何需第一大神仙。天下第一高山爲喜馬拉雅山。彼往此山云十四年矣。向不講話此闪乃被印度大學特請爲神廟主開幕盛典。故降臨此會云。不久仍回第一高山仙窟也。光蛋大仙眞人有時起座。運鐵索。萬人皆起觀之。司儀者禁止不許起立。則不知其何爲也。其旁立者。則講演員。名馬維亞。MOHANMALVIYA用收音機講。满座可聽。惜余不通印語。云此會爲全世界男女求和平之意也。余赴此會太晚。只見裸體眞人。可謂天下一奇餘無他異。不過余不但好奇。亦知奇者。佛道書均言修仙者修成陰馬藏相。何謂陰馬藏相。謂男子陽具因運工夫之故。縮于内部而不外現。無量義經述佛三十二相之一。爲陰馬藏相。謂陽具不外現也。首書言女子修行斷月經。名爲斬赤龍也。今此第一大仙陽具沿露于外。不知其道尙未成與。抑修法不同與。不過佛昔在雪山靜坐六年。並未得道。佛自言最後由悟得之。蓋修道在雪山。而成道乃在伽印平地。又佛修道六年。當時之老前輩不信。曰彼爲太子。不耐苦。太嬌慣。吾等苦修八年。尙未得道也。今此大仙修十四年矣。不知得道與否。彼又不言。則吾不知也。但昔達摩東來。面壁十年不語。由達摩證之。此大仙能不語。想亦達摩之流亞矣。</p>
<h3 id="c177">湖樓詩話（上） <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>此次湖樓詩課。不意吟壇宿將。亦多乘興而來。何敢謬評甲乙。且多至六百餘卷。琳榔满目。苦無細讀之暇。而走馬看花。又恐令人敗興。是以先送翠吟樓。令將可取之句圈出。再由鄙人複選加圈。結果。欲其四首全佳。逐句均得雙圈者。可謂絕無其人。蓋瑕瑜互見。雖李杜亦所不免。旣非掄才大典。何必詮叙名次。。引起榮辱之觀念。爰爲摘句細評。擇尤披露如左。</p>
<p>第一首第一句。當以過了春分日漸長爲最。因冬至日最短。夏至日最長。春分爲由短而長之中。秋分爲由長而短之中。故此一句。所嵌三字。實具科學常識。穩妥之至。或作過了新秋日漸凉之類則較泛矣。第二名當以畫擔低處吸波光爲最。因吸字與低字頗有神韵。一氣呵成。或作接山光。或壓山光。壓字雖較勝於接字。但不如吸字之流動耳。第三句以簾波欲動微風起爲最。以欲字扣微字。便覺無字不雋。洵稱徍搆。第四句則以荷葉满池人影香爲最。但此四句。均非一手所出。是以波字犯複。然如易波光爲湖光。易满池爲满塘亦頗减色而簾波之波字。則與動字及微字起字均有關連。萬不可易。今爲詩話而非詩選。以解剖法斟酌字句。譬如切玉。棄瑕取瑜。亦正不必。如集腋爲裘。更求吹毛疵也。</p>
<p>第二首第一二句。當以夜來蟲語透窗紗。銀漢無聲月半斜爲較穩。因以銀漢無聲。襯出蟲語。以月半斜。襯出透字。而以更深月色半人家一首爲藍本。便覺上下關連　環可誦。他作每多膚泛。不免有巧拙之分。第三四句接以誰泛扁舟尋舊約　　西泠橋畔問蘇家。實爲最稱。蓋扁舟尋舊約爲整個的詞牌名。而西泠蘇小。已爲陳死人。尙復有誰過問。似爲夜來蟲語所。說適爲作者所聞。此等幻想。最爲詩境所取。此首集成。可謂天衣無縫矣。</p>
<p>第三首第二二句當取雨後桃花放嫩晴。綠楊陰裏聽流鶯兩句。以桃花扣放字嫩字。以綠楊扣陰字。以流鶯扣聽字。潁妙之至。或作啼鶯。則不免呆滯矣。或作垂楊。則不如綠字陰字之有呼應耳。第三四句當取環湖一帶行人路。縱有倪黃畫不成。末句雷同。或易一二字者甚多。上句不　爲新西湖作圖志。蓋環湖一帶。柳邊水次。均有行人路。人行其上。倒影水中。誠有非畫所能描寫者。行人路爲建築界名詞。能用白話入詩。。不覺可厭。實爲竹枝本體。末句用翻寫法。自較絕似倪黃畫裏行爲挺拔也。</p>

<p>昨値星期六、銀行市面祇早晨半天營業、下午例無市况、錢業雖照常貿易、可是亦較平時清淡至於市價方面、除銀轉緊、銀拆改昂外、其餘各種市象、大都赢弱銀行收解除常例外、其他當日滙欵、及各種以時間怱促、類率不及簽字改至下星期一再行疏理、</p>
<p>釐拆價格（洋厘）早市及午市釐價同爲七錢二分五釐三毫七忽半、較前日改小一毫二忽半、交易平常人心悥懈、（銀拆）早市一錢二分、午市一錢五分、較前日加昂五分、趨勢略緊、劃頭加水故亦有一錢五六分、銀行掛牌五分、</p>
<p>輔幣市情江南小洋早市爲六錢五分二厘、午市爲六錢五分三釐半、做出交易、早市六千角、午市八十千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢四分四釐八毫七忽半、午市爲六錢四分五釐、做出交易早市二十二萬五千角、午市九萬五千角、銅元改縮五百文、爲三百七十五千文、交易三萬○七百餘串、</p>
<p>銀洋進出（銀欵）昨日銀行收解甚爲簡略、華商收解票欵一百五六十萬外商收解票欵九十餘萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解六百六七十萬、進倉八十萬、日商銀行收解各欵三进二十餘萬、進倉四十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千五百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百七十餘萬、各路匯欵收解九十餘萬、解現一百餘萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出一百三十九萬、午市做出八十四萬、鈔票早市七萬、午市二萬、場外鈔票早市十二萬二千、午市四萬五千、銀行交易早市互市九十萬、午市互市七十萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解一百二十餘萬、鈔票進出二百七八十萬、錢莊洋公單收解六百三十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百四十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百十餘萬、小錢莊交易六十餘萬、</p>

<p>其他互有漲跌上落甚微</p>
<p>昨日本埠證券市塲各債券市况、期市依然沉靜買賣兩方閒散如前、未見轉機、又現貨交易亦甚寥落、查各債券市價之變動情形、以債市環象沉靜、且離交割期漸近、大戶熊度觀望、市况清閒、交易零星、套利獨多、求供形勢均衡、債價趨勢呆滯、晨初開出時、惟需要尙佳、比前日咸續張、旋買方漸見沉靜俏稍回縮、結果較前日如統稅跌五六角、一九善·二○關捲亦跌三角左右、其他大致稍漲、計全日現貨交易僅五千元、期貨上午七百餘萬、後市三百三十萬合計約達一千零四十萬元、</p>

<p>棉市晨間甚虚、因美棉漲力徵薄而匯兌又見鬆動、致外棉採算銀價愈廉、且大戶抛賣異常踴躍、有一部份購進外棉套出標花、故跌風較熾、人心十分惡化、午後以三品棉花突一元又因美國紐约崙地方明年對於新棉田畝有减種消息、於是商場上人氣大爲震動買方活動而抬、市盤遂上漲三錢、但現棉中外各廠均無採辦之舉、前途仍須看跌爲多、惟本埠棉商傾向做多、以年成受水災影響之故也、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Wuhan Residents' Hearts Slightly Calmed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Water Level Still Shows No Rise or Fall</p>
<p>Public Order Can Be Declared Safe</p>
<p>Li Jin Brings Funds to Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou, 22nd: The water level in Hankou remains unchanged today, and the residents' hearts are slightly at ease. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou, He Chengjun told people that first, the public order in Wuhan is consolidated; second, he has telegraphed various provinces to purchase rice, so there is no worry about the people's food supply; and third, the fundamental solution for future governance is to first dredge the Yangtze River and open up the tributaries of the Xiang River. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou, Li Jin, a member of the China Relief Society (中振會), arrived in Hankou by plane on the 22nd, bringing with him 170,000 relief funds. Li said that the central government has clearly understood the severity of the disaster in Hubei and will issue a large sum of money for relief. Zhu Qinglan will also come to Hankou to inspect the disaster in the next few days. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou, Amid the Wuhan flood, public order is consolidated. The Garrison Department, the Fortress Department, a part of the 48th Division, and the Gendarmerie Battalion are all responsible for maintaining order. The central government will also send an additional division and several warships to Hankou to strengthen defenses. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou, Xiong Kaixian, an internal commissioner for inspecting the disaster, arrived in Hankou on the 21st. Starting on the 22nd, he went to the disaster area to conduct on-site investigations. Liu Ruiheng and others are also working intensely. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou, Eight out of ten parts of Wuchang are flooded. The provincial government established a temporary flood control committee on the 21st at the Wuchang city wall, with Liu Wendao and others as members and Fang Dazhi as the director. The flood control office was simultaneously abolished. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou, In this flood, foreign merchant ships and warehouses in Hankou suffered losses of tens of millions. However, state-owned enterprises, such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, under the direction of Director Li Yunliang, have been rescuing and preserving goods, moving them to higher ground in recent days.

<p>Decision to Deliver it Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Nanjing, The third note on the Korean incident, drafted by the responsible department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and repeatedly revised, has been finalized. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Foreign Minister Wang convened Ji Jing and Jiang Huaben for a final review. It was then handed over to the International Department for drafting at 2:00 PM, and it was not completed until 7:00 PM in the evening. It was immediately sealed and sent to the diplomatic residence for Foreign Minister Wang to sign. It was originally intended to be sent to the Japanese consulate that night, but it was changed to the morning of the 24th because it was already late. It is reported that the content of the note is about two to three thousand words long. The first paragraph refutes the Japanese response to our second note, stating that the Japanese side cannot shirk responsibility, and there are sufficient facts to prove that the local officials in Korea did not fulfill their responsibility to protect them in advance. The second paragraph describes the losses of life and property suffered by overseas Chinese based on Wang’s investigation and reports from various parties. Regarding lives, it is divided into three categories: deaths, injuries, and missing persons, all with detailed figures. Regarding property, because a joint investigation is required, only the principles of compensation are proposed, without listing specific figures. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Deliberately Making Trouble to Shirk Responsibility for the Korean Incident</p>
<p>Reinforcing Troops in China Confirmed</p>
<p>Nanjing, According to diplomatic circles, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a report on the Nakamura incident. This matter may be a propaganda effort by the Japanese side to deliberately exaggerate the seriousness, in order to shirk responsibility for the Korean incident. As for the Qingdao incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a detailed report, and the Qingdao municipal government is currently negotiating with the Japanese consulate. Diplomatic authorities hope that this matter will not escalate further. It has been widely rumored in recent days that Japan will reinforce troops in China. I met with a senior official in diplomatic circles to inquire about the truth of this matter. According to the reply, the reinforcement of Japanese troops in Korea is indeed a fact. Regarding the reinforcement of troops in China, it is reported that the Japanese side does have this intention. The method of advancing troops is to extend the term of the Japanese army stationed in Dong Province and increase the number in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Diplomatic circles are paying close attention to this and hope that the people of the country will also pay attention, he said. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

He will stay in Beiping for a week and then go to Henan to visit Chairman Liu to discuss clearing the countryside. Yan Xishan will not be able to publish his views because the opportunity has passed. Last year, he had great power, but he did nothing. Now, the exhausted troops of Shanxi province are even less likely to be effective, and it is unlikely that they will be used by him. As long as the generals of North China are united and support the central government, Yan will have to leave. Feng Yuxiang will eventually have to leave as well, because if there are ten bandits in Shanxi, they can tie him up and take him away. The generals in the Northwest all hope that Mr. Feng will realize his mistake as soon as possible and leave the Northwest. Regarding his views on the situation in North China, he hopes to find ways to get closer to the generals in the Northeast, obey the central government, and follow the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief so that no war will occur in the country. The defeated soldiers of Shi Yousan who fled to Shandong have been reorganized into a division of more than 7,000 people, and Zhan Shutang has been appointed as the division commander.

<h3 id="e28">Discussion on Fundamental Issues in Education Going Forward (4) <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Educators are constantly educating young people. At the same time, they themselves are constantly being educated by the real environment. Therefore, the real environment, namely, the real facts, serves as an accurate and powerful criticism for educators, and also as accurate and substantial teaching material. Educators should, based on their own responsibilities, accept objective criticism, and even more so, accept the lessons of reality based on the demands of the times.</p>
<p>As for the three questions mentioned, we have already provided factual and reasoned explanations. It is not necessary to blame the past on how to break the reality and how to improve it. But it is the heavy responsibility that educators today should bear. The reporter would like to further state his humble views to contribute to the discussion regarding the correction of the phenomena mentioned in the first question. The focus is on the educators themselves. Educators should always be mindful of the heavy responsibility they bear for the future of the nation and society. They should value education and value responsibility. This self-awareness of responsibility should be the basic morality and basic condition for educators. If they can value education, they will not treat the education career as a tool to solve their livelihood, the school as a political arena for mutual scramble, and the students as fighting weapons to be used and instigated. If they can value responsibility, they will not perfunctorily protect their positions, accommodate and win over students, and stubbornly defend the status quo, or even justify the status quo. If educators value what they do and value the responsibility they bear, thinking of the students everywhere, thinking of the nation and society, constantly criticizing themselves, and constantly accepting the lessons of the environment and facts, then all educational facilities will naturally have definite goals and plans made in advance. The effectiveness of education will also increase to meet the demands of the times.</p>
<p>The correction of the phenomena mentioned in the second question lies in the fact that educators should always look around at the poor masses, always consider the poor children around them, and always pay attention to the provisions of Article 48 of Chapter 5 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China: "Men and women shall have equal opportunities for education." Of course, the realization of equal educational opportunities cannot be achieved by educators alone. But at a minimum, educators should do their best to create more learning opportunities for poor children. Before the 32nd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1906), academies and schools not only did not charge tuition and accommodation fees, but also provided stipends such as support subsidies. Although the imperial examination schools of the Qing Dynasty were both policies to fool the people, their provision of learning opportunities to poor children was indeed commendable. The past is not far away. Why is it impossible to emulate it now, showing the spirit of China's unique independence to the world? Taking a step back, Article 57 of Chapter 5 of the Provisional Constitution stipulates that "all public and private schools nationwide should establish free and scholarship quotas to reward students who excel in both character and academics but are unable to continue their education." Strictly complying with this is to create opportunities for poor children, and it is also to do one's best. Currently, Nankai University and Northeast University in the country have already established scholarship quotas. Those who are responsible for education should quickly respond. As for the correction of the phenomena mentioned in the third question, it should be earnestly made to make education Chinese. Efforts should be made to ensure that it is in line with our country's national economic strength, in line with our country's social conditions, and in line with the practical needs of our nation and society. This issue was acutely pointed out in the "Determination of the Trend of Educational Facilities" passed by the National Assembly. At the same time, the establishment of education programs such as "Primary and secondary education should understand local social conditions, cultivate independent living skills, and focus on increasing production capacity, so that most students who cannot continue their education have the ability to be self-reliant." and "Social education should take increasing production as its central goal, and assist people in improving their production knowledge and skills based on their existing level and actual life." Once the program is set, strive to implement it, and the responsibility of educators is also to correct the phenomena mentioned in the third question.</p>
<p>All that has been said is indeed a part of today's political problems in our country. But before the entire political problem can be properly resolved, this part, which is so important to the future of the nation, cannot but exert our efforts to seek its improvement. We have already said above that "the mission of education is to seek progress in reality and to pursue ideals that are higher and further than reality." Finally, the reporter solemnly dedicates this intention to the education sector in our country today.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Difficulties in Coping with the Financial Crisis, Shaky Position of the British Cabinet <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Rifts Between Government and Trade Unions Not Reduced</p>
<p>Opposition Parties Suggest Forming a Coalition Cabinet</p>
<p>Baldwin Rushes Back to London from Paris</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Looks Tired and Affected</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: Due to the possibility that the entire Labor government or some of its cabinet members may resign, the cabinet continued to discuss the best way to deal with the national financial crisis facing the country from 9:30 this morning until it adjourned at noon and scheduled to continue the discussion in the afternoon. Since the tense times of the European War, this is the first time the cabinet has met on Saturday and Sunday. This matter is of great importance to the political situation. Therefore, this morning, many people gathered outside the prime minister's residence to watch the arrival of cabinet members and await developments. After the cabinet adjourned at noon, the leaders of the opposition parties gathered again to discuss. It is expected that the cabinet will issue a declaration after adjourning this afternoon to announce the government's will to the people. Rumors have been circulating in recent days, and political observers have made many predictions. The most notable is that the Conservative Party has suggested to the Liberal Party to form a Conservative-Liberal coalition government, with George as Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: Only two hours after the cabinet announced that it would not hold any more cabinet meetings until Tuesday, it suddenly convened an emergency meeting scheduled for 6:30 p.m. However, cabinet members could not be summoned, so the meeting was changed to 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. The Labor government will probably seek the most powerful support from the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties, ignoring the opposition of the Trades Union Congress to the government's economic proposals. It is expected that Sir Reading will join Samuel and Maclean, other important members of the Liberal Party, to participate in the tripartite meeting. Conservative Baldwin has rushed back to Paris from vacationing in France, will stay overnight, and can return to London tomorrow morning. It is expected that he will meet with the Prime Minister soon after arriving in London.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: There have been various negotiations behind the scenes today, but the rift between the government and the Trades Union Congress has not been reduced. The Trades Union Congress does not believe that the national financial crisis has reached the point where the industrial sector and the unemployed must also make sacrifices. The Trades Union Congress requires the government not to make any decisions before the Trades Union Congress conference held in Bristol on September 7. It is expected that if the government insists on proceeding with its current proposals, several cabinet members, such as Johnston, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, and Lansbury, the Minister of Works, will inevitably resign. At the same time, the leaders of the opposition parties demand effective frugality. The Labor government is under pressure from both within and outside the party, and its position is very dangerous. Resignation is also possible. It is also speculated that Baldwin will soon become the Prime Minister of the Conservative government. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden is deeply concerned about the outflow of gold pounds and may not be willing to give up his proposed economic measures. However, the government will still try its best to avoid resignation. For if one returns to the electoral district and says, "I resigned because I was unable to solve the problem, and now I still ask you to elect me to deal with the same problem," it would be too self-contradictory. The government's only possible course of action is to resist the Trades Union Congress. If so, the disintegration of the Labor Party is inevitable. It is expected that the government will proceed with its procedures without reopening negotiations with the Trades Union Congress. It is heard that the proposal for emergency tariffs has been rejected by the government, because Snowden, who strongly supports free trade, and First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, have both declared that if such tariffs are implemented, they will withdraw from the cabinet.</p>
<p>National, New York, 21st: The New York stock market fell sharply today, and people were tired and sold off one after another. The price of each security fell from one pound to ten pounds. As the market was about to close, someone dumped thousands of shares of a certain number of companies on the market. The reason is that people are generally worried that the British budget cannot be balanced, so people's hearts are unstable. In addition, the profits of the automobile industry also show a decline.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: The Bank of England, with the special permission of the government, will maintain the total amount of £275,000,000 in banknotes issued for another three weeks. The legal total amount is £260,000,000. On August 2, temporary additional £15,000,000 was approved.</p>

The police authorities now believe that these military supplies must have been hidden by violent Communist elements. The recent assassination of police officers and the overturning of trains must be related to these people, because according to the report of the chemical examiner, the seized bombs were made in the same way as those used in the train bombing case. The police also seized 37 pounds of bombs and other explosive devices with detonators, as well as some Communist propaganda documents, in the room of an engineer at the Gorba Power Plant in southern Berlin. The engineer admitted to being a Communist but refused to provide the reason for secretly storing the bombs.</p>

<p>Reuters, Simla, 21st: The Indian Viceroy replied to Gandhi, denying that the government had violated the Irwin-Gandhi Pact, and said that the activities of the All-India Congress Party in many respects contradicted the spirit and letter of the agreement and often endangered the maintenance of peace. To say that the local government has no intention of fulfilling the agreement or has a scheme to destroy the work of the All-India Congress Party is a complete misunderstanding of the truth. The Indian government does not want to take any action except as required by special circumstances, nor does it want to easily have special plans. As for Gandhi's request to submit it to arbitration, the Indian government cannot bind its own or the local government's freedom of judgment.</p>

<p>The United States Will Stop Planting Cotton Next Year to Raise Market Prices</p>
<p>The United States and Brazil Sign a Contract to Exchange Surplus Agricultural Products</p>
<p>National, Washington, 21st: President Hoover stated today that China's purchase of wheat will exceed 15 million bushels, and the Department of Agriculture is also willing to supply it. Currently, the Chinese and American governments are negotiating the price of wheat and interest. The most difficult thing to solve is the repayment period. China hopes for a period of 10 to 20 years, while the Department of Agriculture is only willing to lend for two or three years.</p>
<p>National, New Orleans, 22nd: Representatives of farmers and businessmen from the 14 cotton-producing states in the United States today passed a resolution proposing to stop planting cotton for one year next year, and the legislative body will make it into a bill, but it will only become binding after it is uniformly implemented nationwide. The Department of Agriculture will also purchase 8 million bales of cotton at prices higher than the market price and distribute them to farmers who do not gin cotton. Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 21st: The terms of Brazil's exchange of coffee for American wheat have now been agreed upon and conveyed to Washington. The terms stipulate that Brazil will accept 25,500,000 bags of wheat, stored in warehouses, and withdraw 10,000 bags per month until after October 1932, and then withdraw 62,000 bags per month.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st: The Brazilian government and the Food Market Maintenance Agency signed a contract today to exchange 1,050,000 bags of Brazilian coffee for 25 million bushels of American wheat. This transaction is probably the largest commodity transaction ever, exchanging what I have in abundance for what I lack, and each gets what it wants. Brazil has a large surplus of coffee and has recently burned 530,000 bags of inferior coffee. The United States has a lot of wheat in stock, estimated to total 250 million bushels.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Continued Report on the Riot of Japanese in Qingdao <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Arrive in Qingdao, But Soldiers Do Not Land</p>
<p>Japanese Protest to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Report from Witness, German Doctor</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The case of the riot of Japanese residents in this city and the murder of Chinese people has been detailed in yesterday's news. After this case occurred, Japanese newspapers tried their best to publicize the opposite, hoping to expand the incident. Yesterday, a large meeting of Japanese residents was held in the Japanese Residents Group to discuss countermeasures. In the evening, hundreds of Japanese rioters, each secretly carrying weapons, went to Huan Tai Road and Liao Ning Road in Xiao Bao Dao to provoke trouble again. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau dispatched security teams in advance, and all personnel were on duty patrolling and suppressing the area, paying close attention to preventing the area. All Chinese people were not allowed to pass through the area to avoid conflict, so no accident occurred. Seeing that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, the rioters dispersed late at night. After receiving an emergency telegram from the Japanese, the Japanese warship Kuma stationed in Lushun arrived in Qingdao last night. In fact, this city is as peaceful as ever and not as bad as the Japanese have publicized. Therefore, after the warship arrived in Qingdao, it docked at Pier No. 4 in Dalian, and the soldiers did not land. The municipal government has submitted a serious protest to the Japanese Consulate based on reports from all parties. However, the Japanese side not only ignored it but also sent an unreasonable protest to the municipal government. The municipal government has refuted it with reason. The details of the incident and the number of injured have been inspected by both parties together with the notary, the German famous doctor Wei Shiying. The inspection report of Wei Shiying is recorded as follows, so it is not difficult for people to distinguish the right and wrong of this matter. (1) Report from the Chinese side: This doctor examined ten injured people in the Municipal Hospital this afternoon. Three of them were slightly injured and seven were seriously injured (knife wounds). The cause of the injuries was all caused by sharp instruments (knives). Although there is no danger to life, it is not known whether pus will occur in the process. In short, this doctor observed the wounds and dared to conclude that the injured were indeed mostly injured in the back, and those who could not avoid it were also injured. (2) Report from the Japanese side: A total of sixteen injured people were inspected at the Qingdao Hospital. Most of them were skin injuries or beaten with sticks, stoned, or kicked. Three of them were injured to the bone, and it could not be determined whether the bone was injured without X-rays. Although the injured are slightly injured, there may be suppuration during the treatment period. The above report from Wei Yishi proves that the Japanese carried weapons and it was a deliberate riot, while the Chinese had no weapons and could not resist, resulting in serious injuries, and the injured People more claimed that although they were brutally victimized at that time, they still did not know why they offended the Japanese, which shows that they did not intentionally cause trouble. Also, after investigating the injured Japanese, it was found that a Korean man named Xu Daihao who sold morphine was also sent to the hospital by the Japanese to make up the numbers, which has nothing to do with this case, and it can be seen that the Japanese's intentions are cunning.

<h3 id="e77">National Army Kills Key Red Bandit Leaders <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Fake Army Commander Deng Yigang's Bandit Corpse Shown to the Public</p>
<p>Airplane Bombs Bandit Leader in Sedan Chair to Death in Ningdu</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The remnants of Red bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang have recently concentrated in the Wangpi, Xiaobu, Nankeng, Liangcun, Liantang, Jiangbei Cave, Yinkeng, Zhangmushan, and Ge'ao areas bordering the four counties of Yudu, Xingguo, Yongfeng, and Ningdu, hoping to take advantage of the familiar mountainous terrain and dangerous topography to invade the National Army, attempting to succeed. Therefore, in recent days (from the beginning to mid-month), the left and right wings of the National Army, such as the Mao, Zhao, Wei, Jiang, Han, Hao, Luo, Jiang, and Cai Divisions, have braved the summer heat and fought fiercely with the Red bandits in the deep mountains and remote valleys of Xing, Yu, Yong, and Ning. The intensity of the fighting, the length of the stalemate, and the ferocity of the firepower have surpassed even the battles to recover Ningdu and Shishi. According to military sources, the main forces of Zhu and Mao, led by Peng (Dehuai), Huang (Gonglue), Lin (Biao), and others, who invaded from Ningdu on the left wing, have been defeated by Zhu Shaoliang's Third Army Group. The main forces of bandit troops led by Xiang Ying, Wu Zhonghao, Chen Yi, and Deng Gang, who invaded from Yudu and Xingguo towards the Third Route Army, have also been defeated by the right-wing army. The various armies are currently searching and suppressing the remaining bandits everywhere. Victory telegrams have been arriving in the province daily. Deng Yigang, commander of the bandit's Thirty-Fifth Army, gathered three to four thousand bandits with hundreds of guns (the rest were spears), hiding in the Datian (border area of Yudu, Ruijin, Ningdu, and Xingguo) Zhongpo area. Commander Han rushed there in the morning, first occupying the nearby mountain peaks and high grounds where the bandits were located, and then using a part of the force to charge into the bandit formation. The bandits resisted briefly and then scattered and fled over the mountains. At that time, our ambush troops fired their guns and cannons together, and bullets rained down, killing thirteen to fourteen hundred bandits and wounding over a thousand. Fake army commander Deng Yigang was also shot and killed. The wounded bandit soldiers identified Deng's body, and it was carried out for public display, which was met with great rejoicing. The scattered bandits are still being pursued by separate teams. It is reported that this operation mostly involved mountain bandits operating in the area, similar to the Miao and Yao people. The National Army inevitably faces many difficulties. Regarding reconnaissance and communication, it relies entirely on the instructions and notifications of aircraft, which is the only effective tool. It is understood that there are several squadrons, including the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, in the aviation team in Jiangxi, and most of the fighter planes are stationed in Ji'an and Fuzhou. Since Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek appointed Mao Bangchu as the commander of the Air Force, all reconnaissance and bombing operations on the front lines are under his command. Mao also flies from the province to the front lines from time to time to inspect. For example, in the battles of Liantang and Huangpi, the aircraft were very effective. Furthermore, the headquarters recently received a report from the Aviation Department that yesterday, when an aircraft flew to the Ningdu area for reconnaissance and bombing, it saw hundreds of armed bandits escorting several large blue sedan chairs on the road from Zhukeng (Guangchang to the Fujian-Jiangxi-Ningdu main road) to Ningdu, heading east. Knowing that they were bandit leaders, they immediately dropped a heavy bomb, which exploded instantly. The sedan chairs were shattered into powder, and the armed bandits scattered and fled. The bandit leaders in the sedan chairs must have been killed, and so on. According to front-line reports, the bandits in Huangpi and Xiaopu are from the two major groups of Zhu and Mao. Recently, under the intense firepower pressure from the left-wing army, they fled east along Zhukeng, passing through Kuzhu and Qianshan north of Guangchang, towards the Fujian border. This confirms the above news that those traveling east towards Zhukeng in sedan chairs must be Zhu, Mao, and other leaders. (August 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Zhu Qinglan's Disaster Narrative <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>

<p>Birds peck at fresh corpses, blood not yet dry... This is the battlefield along the Ping-Han Railway.</p>
<p>Disaster relief: First save the people, then discuss relief efforts.</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, in response to the telegram invitation from Song Ziwen and others from the Flood Relief Emergency Committee, arrived in Tianjin last night (the 18th) and will take the Pingpu express train south at 10 p.m. tonight. The reporter interviewed him at the Qunxian Hotel and had a long conversation, inquiring about the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu and his opinions on going south to handle flood relief. According to his remarks, as follows:</p>
<p>This time, I entered Gansu from Shaanxi, only reaching Liangzhou (Wuwei County), when I received a telegram from Shanghai urging me to return. However, the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is gradually improving. When I went to Shaanxi and Gansu the year before last, in all the counties I visited, the ground was without grass, the trees were without bark (having been scraped off and eaten by the disaster victims), and the houses were like empty shells. No chickens or dogs could be</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>heard. This time, returning to the old places, although the houses are still like empty shells, the trees already have bark, the ground already grows grass, and the sounds of chickens and dogs can be heard. As for grains, the low-lying, water-adjacent fields have all been planted and have a five- or six-tenths chance of harvest. The highland areas without water are still barren mountains. Our China is truly unfortunate. Disasters of floods, droughts, hail, bandits, and soldiers come one after another. Disaster relief is only a temporary emergency measure. What should be done after disaster relief? Most disaster relief organizers have not considered this. They only seek to treat the symptoms, not the root cause. Given the size of China, there will inevitably be disasters every year, and disaster relief will be needed every year. Thus, disaster relief organizers will become a permanent enterprise. The disaster in Gansu, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, was caused by inconvenient transportation and the failure to develop water conservancy. The canals built during the Tang Dynasty can still be faintly discerned today. The ancients built the country on agriculture, so they paid attention to water conservancy. If modern rulers had continued the policies of the ancients and engaged in water conservancy construction, widely opening canals on the Guan River in the provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, and Shanxi to divert the floodwaters of the Yellow River, then how could the provinces in the Yellow River basin suffer from floods every year? Furthermore, extending this, if all the provinces in the Huai River and Yangtze River basins could strive for water conservancy construction, then why would China's agricultural products lag behind the world? The China International Famine Relief Commission is doing very well in Shaanxi and Gansu. The first step is to develop transportation, and the second step is to develop water conservancy. Currently, the Binwei motor road (i.e., from Bin County on the Shaanxi border to Wuwei County in Gansu, over 1,000 li long) is under construction. This is a method of providing work in exchange for relief. The entire road can be completed next year. The Commission has hired many engineers to survey other routes. I preside over the Shaanxi-Gansu Emergency Relief Committee. After completing the spring relief, the remaining funds were used to distribute seeds. I originally wanted to organize rural cooperatives, but because there were villages without people, or people without land, it was impossible to do so. Therefore, I investigated farmers who had land but no ability to cultivate it, and provided loans appropriately to enable them to purchase cattle, horses, and farm implements, to be repaid with an interest rate of one and a half percent after the autumn harvest, as a form of restriction. As for the conflicts between Hui and Han in Gansu, I believe it is a political problem, not a national problem. Those who hold military power occupy their respective areas and do not yield to each other. The newly appointed Chairman of Gansu Province, Ma Hongbin, can only exercise his authority in one corner and cannot extend it to the entire province. The conflicts between Hui and Han have a long history. Rulers have always used high-pressure tactics to quickly quell disputes, but they do not know that the greater the pressure, the greater the reaction. Therefore, grievances are repaid with grievances, endlessly. I hope that the rulers will find ways to instruct the people that the dead are already gone and cannot be brought back to life. The only thing to do is to comfort the surviving families, transform them with virtue, and promote the spirit of Hui-Han friendship. Over time, they will naturally be able to live in peace. Lixian County is where the Hui-Han killings were the most tragic. Only nine people with white hair were left in the entire county. We do not need to witness the tragedy; hearing about it is enough to bring tears to our eyes. On my way back north, I received a telegram from the Battlefield Emergency Relief Committee inviting me to assist in everything. So I got off the train in Baoding and boarded the train from Zhengzhou. Passing through Shunde, I could see new graves stacked up all the way to Baoding, with Wangdu being the most tragic. The battlefield burial teams all did their work perfunctorily. Those who died in the trenches were buried in the trenches, covered with soil. Those who died on the plains were mostly buried in mass graves, but the burial pits were too shallow, and many were dug out by wild dogs. One often sees several dogs or a flock of birds fighting over a corpse, covered in blood, too horrible to bear. In this hot weather, corpses buried too shallowly are evaporated by the sun and easily transmit epidemics through the spread of air. I mentioned above that in Gansu, I could already hear the crowing of chickens and the barking of dogs, which I considered a sign that the situation was gradually improving. However, occasionally walking through ancient temples and deserted suburbs, one still occasionally finds the tragic scene of dogs gnawing on white bones. Now I see the tragic scene of new battlefields. An ancient poem says, "Dogs gnaw on white bones, sinews still remain; birds peck at fresh corpses, blood not yet dry." This can be used as a portrayal of today's disasters. I suggested to the Battlefield Emergency Relief Committee: (1) Reorganize burial teams to set out and rebury the corpses, digging pits more than four feet deep. (2) Investigate the houses destroyed by the people and provide appropriate compensation so that they have homes to return to, to avoid becoming displaced. Currently, the Committee has transported four trainloads of relief grain and a considerable amount of relief funds and is providing relief. As for how to deal with the floods in the south, I am not yet clear. I believe that disaster relief must first save people. More small steamships should be hired to quickly transport the disaster victims to Xujiapeng on the Wu-Chang Railway, where the terrain is higher, and more mat sheds should be erected to shelter them from the wind and rain. Then, funds should be raised to transport grain to provide emergency relief. Mr. Zhang Jian once said that the Huai River diversion project is crucial and cannot be delayed any longer; otherwise, in thirty to fifty years, Wuhan will inevitably be flooded. However, it has been delayed for ten years, and the Huai River has not been diverted. Mr. Zhang's prediction has been confirmed today, which is regrettable. Lou Xiangqing, a member of the Shaanxi-Gansu Emergency Relief Committee, hosted a banquet for Mr. Zhu at the Huizhong Hotel at 7 p.m. tonight, reporting on his inspection of the disaster situation in Shaanxi and Gansu and inviting representatives from various charitable organizations to attend. The guests and hosts did not disperse until 9 p.m., and Zhu immediately boarded the train south. (August 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Yellow River Water Levels Drop in Shandong Province <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Situation Near Luokou Somewhat Stable, Downstream Works Still Need Strong Protection</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Regarding the Yellow River situation, as of last night (the 20th), a telegram from Shanzhou reported a stable water level, the same as the 17th. In the upper reaches of this province, Lishangtun water level dropped four inches, Sunlou water level dropped one foot three inches. In the middle reaches, Guanzhuang in Dong'a County dropped eight inches, Qihe water level dropped three inches, and Luokou water level dropped two inches. The situation seems to have stabilized somewhat. According to river bureau officials, a stable water level in Shanzhou and a dropping water level in this province means that even if Shanzhou rises again in the future, this province will be able to accommodate it after the subsidence. According to this view, if there is no major rise again, there may be no danger this year. River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia returned to Luokou from the downstream last night and went to Beidianzi in the upstream this morning to cross the river and inspect the upstream. The Qingcheng County Magistrate was reprimanded by the River Affairs Bureau in a telegram for his ineffective rescue efforts and disregard for work defense. The telegram read: "To Changfuzhen and the chief magistrate of Qingcheng (named Shi Zi) and the director of the Public Security Bureau: Since the beginning of autumn, the river water has been rising sharply, and the various sections of the project are in danger. The chairman and the civil affairs department have repeatedly telegraphed the county magistrate and the director of the Public Security Bureau to quickly go to work, gather laborers to assist in prevention, and the bureau has also telegraphed to comply with the cases. However, it was found that the county magistrate and the director of the Public Security Bureau delayed until the bureau chief personally came to the worksite before the county magistrate arrived. After the county magistrate left, the laborers scattered, disregarded the merit order, and acted perfunctorily, which is extremely inappropriate. The autumn floods are long, and the water source is abundant. If there is any negligence, the relationship will be far-reaching. Therefore, we order the director of the County Public Security Bureau to comply with the merit order, immediately go to work, and quickly assemble laborers to the various dangerous sections on the north and south banks that have been transferred, station them permanently to work, and assist the section defense officers in strictly guarding to ensure safety, and report the handling situation at any time. Sincerely. Director Zhang Lianjia (seal)"</p>
<p>River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia went to the downstream yesterday to inspect the river works and arrived at Damajia in the Tianjin border on the north bank that night. Because a dangerous section suddenly appeared there last night, Zhang immediately supervised the rescue work there. Today, the situation has stabilized somewhat. Zhang telegraphed the provincial government from Damajia, urgently requesting the provincial government to continue ordering the county magistrates and public security bureau directors of the counties along the river to go to the embankment to supervise the flood rescue work. Also, Beidianzi, 30 li northwest of Luokou on the south bank of Changqing, which was in danger the night before last, is now stable. This afternoon, the Luokou water mark dropped another two inches, still nine zhang two chi seven inches above sea level, and the situation is slightly more stable than yesterday. Licheng County Magistrate Zhou Zongyao gathered more than a thousand laborers in Mengjiaquan to supervise the flood rescue work. The following is the text of Zhang Lianjia's telegram to the provincial government: "Urgent to Chairman Han Jun of the Jinan Provincial Government: The director is currently at Damajia in Lijin. All the works along the way are tight, especially the downstream. At Daoxu Wangwangzhuang in Putai County, the water level is only three feet above the lowest point of the levee. At Xiaolizhuang in Lijin, the water level is about two feet above the levee. Eight or nine out of ten of the dams are overflowing, with the water depth on the dams varying from two to three feet. All are running Zibo. Fortunately, before the great flood, the foundations of the dams were still solid and well-maintained, and they were not lost. We have ordered each section to cut willows, bundle soil, or add pressed sacks for temporary relief. There is no major danger at present, but the downstream river water has not subsided. If protection is slightly lax, danger will be inevitable. We still urgently request that you telegraphed the county magistrates and public security bureau directors of the counties along the river to be permanently stationed at work, supervise the laborers to go to the embankment to check the water, and assist the defense soldiers in fighting hard to protect it, so as to avoid negligence. River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia (seal not affixed) (August 21st)"</p>

<p>Will Visit Zhang Xueliang and Then Go to Bianliang to Meet Liu Zhi</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Liu Zhi's representative, Li Guosheng, arrived in Jinan and went to the provincial government at 2 p.m. yesterday to visit Han Fuju and discuss everything. Han left Li at the provincial government and hosted a banquet to welcome him, with all the important figures in attendance. This morning, the reporter visited Li and learned that the results of yesterday's meeting with Director Han were extremely satisfactory. (1) Regarding the Shi Hanzhang issue, Han said that he and Hanzhang had been through thick and thin for twenty years and had a deep friendship. He was surrounded by reactionaries, and I had repeatedly and earnestly advised him, and many others had also advised him, but he was ultimately stubborn. For the sake of maintaining the overall situation, the central government and Chairman Liu had no choice but to stop him. I cannot harm the public for personal reasons, so I obey the commander-in-chief's orders. This is his own fault, and there is nothing that can be done. (2) Regarding the issue of Director Han going to Henan, Han said that Henan was a place of old friendships. Chairman Liu and I had shared weal and woe and had long wanted to go to reminisce. Recently, I was appointed by the central government as the Director of Qingxiang (cleanup) in Shandong and Henan. Regarding the various issues of Qingxiang and bandit suppression in the two provinces, I need to discuss them with Chairman Liu in person and ask for his help. However, due to busy official duties, I have not been able to go. Now that the reorganization of Shi's troops is underway, I cannot get away. Once the reorganization of Shi's troops is completed in the next few days, I will prepare to set off. As for the issue of jointly attacking Liu Guitang's troops, Director Han ordered the commander of the 29th Division, Cao Fulin, to set off with his troops yesterday. Liu's remaining troops can be resolved within a few days. I will stay for a few days and then return to Henan to report. According to reliable sources in the provincial government, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang had previously invited Han to Peiping for a meeting. Han had not been able to go because of the reorganization of Shi's troops. Now that the reorganization of Shi's troops is complete, he plans to first go to Peiping to visit Zhang in the next few days, and then take the Ping-Han Railway to Bianliang to meet Liu Zhi and discuss all Qingxiang matters in Shandong and Henan. After returning, he will immediately begin a major Qingxiang operation. (August 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Jinan Court Investigates the Zhu Shude Case <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Han's Wife Questioned and Found the Gun</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The provincial Second Experimental Elementary School shooting death case, after Chairman Han Fuju summoned [the parties] for questioning and discovered the source of the handgun, has been referred to the local court for investigation in preparation for prosecution. The court has sent two official letters to the Third Public Security Sub-bureau outside the city. The first letter asked whether the nearby police officers on duty had heard gunshots at the time of the incident at 5 p.m. on July 27th. Because the positions of the sub-bureau's guards were far from Shenjia Alley, the police officers on duty at that time did not hear any gunshots. The second letter asked when Officer Yang went to Wang Weijun's house to check the household registration on the day of the incident and when he received a phone call to go and see what had happened. It also asked where the bullet casing was found and turned over to the court for reference. Officer Yang Yichao of the First Sub-bureau was ordered to submit a detailed report yesterday. According to Officer Yang's report, at 6 p.m. on the 27th of last month, he and census police officer Wang Benzheng made a random check of Wang Weijun's house in Shenjia Alley and there was no activity. At around 7 p.m., he received a phone call from the general affairs section of the main bureau and returned with the police to knock on the door. He asked Weijun's wife, Liu Hesheng, who initially did not admit that a murder had occurred. Later, Wang Weijun and Dr. He Delin of Huamei Hospital arrived at Wang's residence and went to the west room of the hospital. The rickshaw puller Zhang Jigui lit a lamp and He Delin said that she could no longer be saved. At around 9 p.m., the court sent personnel to examine the body, etc. Ms. Zhu died in bed, and the gun was thrown under the bed. The abandoned bullet casing was picked up from the ground by the local guard Wang Yuan inside the door between the south room and the west room of Wang Weijun's house while sweeping the floor on the afternoon of the 28th. Yesterday, a detailed report was submitted, and the bullet casing was also delivered to the local court. Today (the 20th) at 9 a.m., the local court also sent Wang Weijun's rickshaw puller, Zhang Jigui, to the court. Prosecutor Liu Rongshan was present in the Third Investigation Room to question him about Wang Weijun and Zhu Shude forming a family in Xiaowangfu in August and September of last year. Zhang answered in detail about Ms. Zhu Shuxin continuing her studies. Li Shijun's daughter-in-law in Tianjin wrote a letter expressing sympathy for her situation and offering to help with her future tuition. Ms. Zhu has already replied to the letter, expressing her deep gratitude for her kindness. She politely declined the offer of financial assistance. It is also heard that Chairman Han's wife, Ji Ganqing, was extremely saddened by the tragic death of Zhu Shude and went to great lengths to ask Wang Weijun's maid, Chen Wangshi, and finally found the source of the handgun. Seeing that her younger sister, Shuxin, was eager to study but lacked the funds for her studies, she expressed sympathy. It is heard that she also told Zhu that she was willing to fund Zhu Shuxin's studies in Nanjing.</p>

<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Shuanghesheng Leather Factory, the only industry of its kind in the country, and the Yuqingde Woolen Mill in Harbin are both the most promising enterprises run by Chinese. The owner of the factory is Zhang Tingge. Zhang is from Yexian County, Shandong Province, and is currently the chairman of the Harbin Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of the Municipal Self-Government Association. The Shuanghesheng Brewery in Peiping and the Shuanghesheng Flour Mill in Harbin were both founded independently by Zhang, starting in the 7th year of the Republic of China, and have been in operation for 12 years. Initially, the German technicians hired were not successful in their research, and the products made were not suitable, resulting in huge losses. It almost went bankrupt in the middle. Zhang persevered and invested over 7 million yuan in national currency. It was only in the last five years that it began to make a profit. The leather produced, such as that supplied to leather boot shops in and outside the city for purchase, was very popular and was comparable to foreign goods. This year, due to the depression in the gold industry, and with enough stock for a year's sales, it stopped work a month ago. Recently, because 1,000 raw sheepskins were purchased and needed to be made quickly to avoid spoilage, work was started on the 17th. At 10:20 a.m. that morning, while the workers were working, they suddenly saw fire on the roof of the south building of the factory. The entire workforce stopped working and took out the factory's own water dragon to put out the fire. However, the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit, starting between the iron cover of the ceiling and spreading very quickly, making it difficult to extinguish. At the same time, well water could not be used, so water troughs were used to fetch water for extinguishing. At that time, the scorching sun was in the sky, and a southwest wind suddenly rose, increasing the fire. In less than half an hour, it had spread beyond control. The factory urgently telegraphed the city fire department to come quickly for rescue. The Daoli fire engines rushed over. Because the factory was far outside the city in Quanhe, more than ten miles from the city, and the roads were muddy, the fire engines could not advance after reaching 20th Street outside the city. Some firefighters had no choice but to wade barefoot, carrying grappling hooks. Although they arrived at the fire scene, they could not climb up because the fire was on the roof of the building and the fire ladder had not been brought. They could only protect everything around the burning area. The Jiangfang Navy Barracks were located behind the factory. When the sailors saw that the fire was already large, they borrowed a water dragon from the Jiangbei shipyards and helped to extinguish it. Because they were located downwind, and the water dragon was small, the extinguishing was ineffective. The sailors were smoked by the smoke and fire and found it difficult to stand, so they returned to the barracks to protect their own homes. By about 2 p.m., all 500 rooms of the factory's buildings had been burned down. The sound of explosions from the machinery, gasoline, and wooden frames stored in the factory continued. The two accounting rooms in the northeast corner of the factory had also been engulfed, and the warehouse where goods were stored and the flat rooms where machinery was stored were also in danger of being burned. The fire engines of the fire department, blocked several miles away, were helpless. The factory manager, He Guochen, came up with a plan. He borrowed a large ship from the Northeast Shipping Bureau and told the fire engines to board the ship from 12th Street, bypass the factory from Quanhe, and connect the various fire engine water dragons to draw water from the river for extinguishing. The fire department followed the plan and arrived at the fire site at 3:30 p.m. Because the shore was muddy, the fire engines still could not get ashore. They connected the water dragons and drew water from the river to pour on the flames. By this time, not a single factory building was intact. Only the warehouses and accounting rooms were sprayed with water, which fortunately protected them. The fire was not extinguished until about 5 p.m. The fire department returned to the city after it was extinguished. It is estimated that 500 rooms in the north and south buildings of the factory, one accounting office, 17 tanning machines, 40 soaking machines, 4 planing machines, 2 cutting machines, 2 softening machines, 2 polishing machines, 1 stretching machine, 3 engines, and 3 large and small boilers were burned down, totaling losses of more than 5 million yuan in national currency. The insurance amount, with three companies, was only 1 million Haikwan taels, with actual losses of more than 4 million. Fortunately, the warehouse was not burned, and the machinery storage room was not burned, and there were still dozens of pieces of goods and machinery worth over a million yuan. However, at a time when the market is depressed and finances are extremely stagnant, the factory has suffered such a huge loss and has no ability to recover. (August 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Records of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Congress <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Closing Ceremony Held on the Afternoon of the Twenty-Second</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Second Jiangsu Provincial Congress held its eighth meeting at 9:00 AM on the twenty-second at Boxian Park in Zhenjiang. Seventy-five delegates were present. The presidium elected Ge Jianshi as chairman. After the leadership led in paying respects, the discussion of proposals continued: (1) A proposal to devise methods for rescuing the province from its extraordinarily severe flooding. (Resolution) Passed. The methods were divided into two categories: immediate and fundamental. (A) Immediate Measures: 1. The provincial government's budget for the 20th year of the Republic includes a total of 400,000 yuan for disaster relief. The Finance Department should allocate this amount promptly for emergency relief efforts. 2. Telegraph the Central Relief Committee to allocate one million yuan for emergency relief in the disaster-stricken areas of Jiangnan and Jiangbei in this province. 3. The provincial government should promptly purchase one million yuan worth of food, with 500,000 yuan for rice and 500,000 yuan for wheat flour, to relieve the disaster victims in various counties. 4. Petition the Central Government to allow all national salvation funds in the counties to be used for disaster relief in those counties. 5. Allocate and borrow unspent funds from the provincial government and construction funds and special water conservancy funds retained by various counties. 6. Party and government agencies and organizations in the disaster-stricken counties should establish disaster relief committees to investigate the total food production in each county and handle all relief matters. 7. No grain from any county in this province may be transported out of the county without the order of the local government or the consent of the county's disaster relief committee. Speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants are strictly prohibited. 8. County warehouses should actively store grain and rigorously clear out old, empty grain reserves. 9. No additional acreage tax should be levied this year. In disaster-stricken areas, county governments should conduct detailed investigations and reduce or exempt land taxes and rents accordingly. 10. Request the provincial government to issue public bonds as appropriate for relief and work relief. (B) Fundamental Measures: 1. The central and provincial governments should immediately follow the late Premier's teachings and implement the Huai River diversion project. This project must be completed within two years. The Huai River diversion should be based on the principle of simultaneously directing it to the sea and the Yangtze River. 2. The Grand Canal should be dredged immediately, and unemployed people near the drainage tributaries should be hired to excavate them. 3. Allocate unused construction bonds as special funds for water conservancy, adopt work-for-relief methods, and expedite the dredging of waterways, riverbeds, and rivers entering the sea, the Yangtze River, and lakes north and south of the Yangtze River. The Construction Department must announce the entire plan within one month and implement it immediately. 4. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining should focus on afforestation this year, soliciting donations from local people in various counties or using local public funds for afforestation. Appoint personnel to guide and supervise the implementation of this plan. (2) A proposal to reform the politics of this province. (Resolution) The review report and the supplementary opinions of the delegates will be compiled and submitted to the Resolution Drafting Committee for collation. (3) A proposal to petition the Central Government to swiftly arrest and bring to justice Tan Shuqing, who arbitrarily killed Party members, to avenge the Party and provide generous compensation to the families of the victims, Comrades Chen and Zhang. (Resolution) A. Petition the Central Government to swiftly remove Tan Shuqing from his post, bring him to justice, and punish him to the fullest extent of the law. B. Petition the Central Government to provide generous compensation to the families of the deceased Comrades Chen Siheng and Zhang Jingchu. (4) A proposal to request the provincial government to strictly prevent Zhang Cha, a major local tyrant in Jiangsu, who has been on the run for three years, from engaging in extensive activities in an attempt to escape punishment. (Resolution) 1. The General Assembly Secretariat should immediately notify the provincial government that his property should not be returned before the local tyrant case is adjudicated, and report the case to the Commander-in-Chief's Office for review. 2. The Provincial Executive Committee should notify the High Court to promptly summon the case for trial and judgment. 3. The Provincial Executive Committee should petition the Central Government not to be confused. By this point in the meeting, only sixty-eight delegates were present. (There were actually one hundred and forty-nine delegates to the congress.) This was less than the legal quorum, so the chairman declared the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the ninth meeting was convened. Seventy-eight delegates were present. Huang Yuren chaired the meeting. After the leadership led in paying respects, the following urgent proposals were discussed: (1) A proposal to request the Central Government to immediately remove and punish Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, who has shown no results since taking office and has often engaged in acts of national humiliation and loss of sovereignty, in order to purify the officialdom and maintain national discipline. (Resolution) Passed. (2) A proposal to investigate Chen Hexian, a member of the Provincial Government and concurrently the Director of the Department of Education, who is ignorant of education, has achieved nothing in his two years in office, has colluded with academic cliques, has used elements of the National State Doctrine faction, has disregarded Party principles, and has undermined local education, which is a violation of Party discipline. Should this assembly petition the Central Government to instruct the National Government to swiftly remove him from office and punish him as a warning to others? Please decide by public vote. (Resolution) Passed. (3) A proposal to investigate Wang Boling, a member of the Provincial Government, who has been drawing a salary every month since taking office but has never come to the province to work. The Provincial Party Consolidation Committee has previously sent letters urging him to attend Provincial Government meetings, but he has ignored them. This is dereliction of duty. Should this assembly petition the Central Government to instruct the National Government to swiftly remove him from office and punish him in order to uphold the law and discipline? (Resolution) Passed. (4) A proposal to set a five-month deadline for the suppression of bandits. (Proposed by the delegate from Shuyang County.) (5) A proposal that the General Assembly notify the provincial government to order the county magistrates to suppress bandit gangs within a specified period. (6) A proposal that bandits are rampant in Suqian, Suining, and other counties, and the people are living in misery. They should be suppressed as soon as possible in order to secure the good people and pacify the local area. (Proposed by the delegate from Suqian County.) The above three proposals were discussed together. (Resolution) Send a letter to the provincial government to consult with the Pacification Superintendent's Office and set a three-month deadline for the suppression of bandits. (7) A proposal that the construction projects in Jiangbei, in this province, should prioritize river management first. (Resolution) Passed. (8) A proposal to strictly prohibit land and acreage taxes from exceeding one percent of the land value in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. (Resolution) Passed. (9) A proposal that the General Assembly Declaration, which has been drafted by the Drafting Committee, be reviewed and passed. (Resolution) Amended and passed. (10) A proposal that all cases not yet discussed be referred to the Executive Committee for review and handling. (Resolution) Passed.</p>
<p>General Idea of the Declaration: The Declaration of the Third Provincial Congress states the responsibility of the Party during the period of political tutelage based on the resolutions of the Congress, actively completing the work of self-government as a model for the provinces. The most important tasks at present are (1) promoting Party affairs in this province, (2) reforming the politics of this province, and (3) providing relief for the floods in this province. The entire text will be revised by Ge Jianshi and Ma Yinbing.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony: After the discussion of the proposals was completed, the closing ceremony was held. The ceremony was conducted as usual. Huang Yuren delivered the closing address, stating that this Congress had been successfully completed and would be sufficient to promote Party affairs and politics in this province in the future. He hoped that the delegates from various counties would return to their villages and conduct widespread propaganda among the people so that all the resolutions could be realized. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Post-Disaster Agricultural Relief in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Expanding the Cattle Protection Movement and Promoting Famine Relief Crops</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture believes that the floods in Jiangsu Province this year have been extraordinarily severe. Not only have many fields been flooded, but the displacement of farmers and the loss and drowning of cattle have also been countless. Currently, people and cattle are living together on the banks of the Grand Canal and in relatively high places. People have no food, and cattle lack fodder. Farmers are too busy taking care of themselves to care for the cattle, so they are willing to sell them at a low price to prolong their lives for a few more days. Unscrupulous merchants and cattle dealers are further suppressing the price. If this continues, they will all be sold to slaughterhouses. What will be done for spring plowing next year? Protecting cattle is an urgent priority. Furthermore, due to the heavy losses from the autumn harvest in various counties, except for the areas below the river, where it is inconvenient to replant suitable crops due to the water not receding, the weather in the other disaster-stricken counties has cleared up, and the water has gradually receded. It is essential to guide farmers to replant autumn crops, such as buckwheat, turnips, and beans. Providing loans for seeds is also an urgent matter. The department has now formulated separate measures to help various counties recover from the agricultural disaster. Details are described below: (A) Expanding the Cattle Protection Movement: (1) Allocate 10,000 yuan from the emergency flood relief funds this year, and continue to allocate 50,000 to 60,000 yuan from the second relief funds to purchase fodder. At the same time, order the autumn harvest counties in Jiangnan to raise funds and transport them to the disaster areas to be loaned at low prices or distributed free of charge. (2) Order county governments to encourage farmers to preserve cattle and prohibit cattle from leaving the county. Provincial and county governments should organize cattle protection committees. Disaster-stricken counties should also establish one cattle foster home, all of which should be organized by local community organizations and managed and fed by the county agricultural improvement field. (B) Promoting Famine Relief Crops: The department will purchase famine relief crop seeds worth 20,000 to 50,000 yuan and distribute them to farmers according to the circumstances of each county. The above two measures have been submitted to the Provincial Government Committee yesterday (the twenty-first) and have been resolved and passed. If the funds arrive on time, they can be implemented immediately. (Twenty-second)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Education Tide Near the Start of the School Year: Educational circles in Wu County are dissatisfied with the Bureau of Education's austerity policies and have expressed their opposition.

<p>The District Office and the Construction Bureau Contend for Rickshaw Donations: In the past, the first district office of this county released 240 rickshaws. All donations were collected by the district office. In November of last year, the Construction Bureau considered it necessary to add more rickshaws to Changshu, so it added 60 rickshaws, which were donated by the Construction Bureau. Since then, the boundaries have been clearly defined. Previously, the Construction Bureau believed that the rickshaw business was a business that should be handled by the Construction Bureau, and the monthly donations should not go to the district office. Therefore, it listed the reasons and, according to the regulations, presented them to the county government, requesting the first district office to hand over the donations. The county government ordered Wu Xinheng, the district chief of the first district office, to reply himself. Soon, District Chief Wu also listed the reasons and presented them to the county government according to the provincial regulations, expressing his unwillingness to hand over the donations. Now, the Construction Bureau will directly ask the Provincial Construction Department to review and seize the donations.</p>
<p>The Party Committee's Accusation Case is Transferred to Suzhou for Trial: With respect to the allegation by Tong Shizhong, a Party member from Meili, that Shi Minyong, a supervisory committee member of the county Party headquarters, defrauded him of money, although County Magistrate Tan of this county had accepted the case, the Party Supervisory Committee has the power to audit the government at the same level. It applied to the High Court for permission to transfer jurisdiction. Lin Wan, the president of the High Court, handed it over to Li Mian, the chief of the Second Criminal Division, for a decision. He considered it reasonable. The decision has now arrived at the county. All kinds of documents and files in this case have been presented to Suzhou and transferred to the Wu County District Court by the High Court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Yixing <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>An Eighty-Eight-Year-Old Man Gets Married: Deng Bingnan (also known as Lao San) from Hubei, who has been living at the foot of Yangling Mountain in Dongda Temple, Zhangzhu Town, for more than sixty years, is now eighty-eight years old. He has reclaimed more than a hundred acres of barren land and has some savings. His late wife has been dead for more than thirty years. He adopted his nephew as his son. His nephew's wife was kidnapped by bandits a few years ago but was later ransomed and returned home. He treats both of his nephew's wives as if they were his own daughters and is quite content. A few days ago, he was persuaded by a fellow villager to marry a fifty-two-year-old widow as his second wife. He was formally married the other day. The two elderly newlyweds also rode in sedan chairs at the time of the wedding. After the marriage, they were very fond of each other. People nearby were all talking about it as a beautiful story. The whole of Yixing's Xushe Becomes a Waterland: Since the beginning of summer, the continuous rain has lasted for more than ten days. The severity of the flood is the greatest it has been in thirty years. In addition, Xushe is located downstream of Liyang and has low-lying terrain. The accumulated water upstream flowed down, causing most of the houses to be flooded, and countless livestock drowned. It was a sea of water, a heartbreaking sight. The water in the city was several feet deep, and shops were completely closed, and traffic was cut off. The river water is still rising, and the wind is raging, causing the dikes to collapse one after another. In places like Waimuwei, Etouwei, and Dingtongwei, about tens of thousands of acres of farmland were flooded. The disaster victims were in danger of starvation, and the city residents were sighing about the fish. It was a real catastrophe. Countless disaster victims are now lying in the flood, crying for food. They are eagerly awaiting relief.</p>

<p>Disputes over Unsuccessful Appeals: Since its establishment, the Wuxi County Court has acted in accordance with the law in all its measures. However, even with the most careful planning, negligence is inevitable. For example, Xu Quanlao, a gambling offender who had already served his sentence and been released, was mistakenly arrested again as a soil smuggling offender and escorted to Suzhou. Only after questioning by the High Court did it become clear that he was another person. Despite repeated arguments, he was still not released. He has now filed a petition. Recently, Han Zhian from Suqian was falsely accused by Wang Laoer of interfering with his family last winter. The county government transferred the case to the court, which sentenced Han Zhian to one year of imprisonment for enticing on June 19 of this year. On June 27, the defendant Han Zhian officially received the judgment. Dissatisfied with the judgment, he immediately drafted a petition and sent it to the County Court and the High Court, as well as a petition for dissatisfaction. He formally delivered them on July 6, within the appeal period, with a receipt. However, he did not receive any approval. The other day, Yang Keqian, the concurrent prosecutor, suddenly summoned the appellant Han Zhian to the court, saying that the appeal period had long expired and he must now be sent to prison. Han asked why, and the prosecutor Yang checked the files again, saying that there was only an appeal to the High Court, but no petition. Han insisted that he could use the receipt as proof, but Yang still did not believe him and ordered him to be returned to custody. Han, who had been unjustly implicated, has already filed an appeal and requested compensation for damages.</p>
<p>Spontaneous Combustion of a Stove Leads to a Tragic Incident: The owner of Shengxinchang Shoe Store on Guanqian Street in the city, Lu Gerong, who is related to him, is thirty-seven years old. He recently came to Wuxi for medical treatment due to illness. He has now recovered slightly. The other night, he was cooking food with a foreign stove when he suddenly fainted, causing the stove to ignite his limbs and chest. He was seriously injured and sent to Datong Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries are very serious, and his life may be in danger.</p>

<p>The Tragic Situation of the Liyang Floods: This time, the continuous rain caused a disaster, and the mountain water burst out. The water in Liyang County was several feet high, and the villages and fields were all submerged. The residents were trapped by the water and had no way to escape. Those who climbed trees and roofs, stretching their necks and looking for help, were everywhere. The rest either slept in the open on high ground or begged for food in the city. It is not known how many more there are. According to various investigations, the area is more than forty miles long and sixty to seventy miles wide. There is not a single field that has not been submerged, and not a single seedling can be seen. There are nearly 100,000 disaster victims waiting for relief. The local area has suffered from various disasters, including soldiers and bandits, and the economy is in a desperate situation. There is no way to provide assistance. It is said that the local gentry Di Xinzhi, Di Jianren, Zhou Qingsheng, etc. have been publicly elected by the Flood Relief Association to go to Shanghai to beg for relief from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association and various charitable organizations and philanthropists.</p>

<p>The Dispute over Converting Cash into Silver Dollars is Not Yet Resolved: Nantong's public education funds are deposited in money shops and pawnshops to generate interest. Because the deposit was calculated in cash, disputes have arisen over the conversion into silver dollars over the years, and they have not yet been resolved. Currently, money merchants Liu Zhongze et al. have filed a request with the court for legal mediation.</p>
<p>The Yan Zheming Case is Difficult to Proceed: The 18th Team of the Provincial Water Public Security stationed in Tong shot and killed Yan Zheming in front of the court. The prosecutor's office has begun investigating and has summoned the shooters. Because this case requires an autopsy, it has sent a letter to the team headquarters pointing out the location of the buried coffin. The reply stated that the coffin had been taken away by Yan Qingshan, the brother of the deceased. Captain Xie has not yet returned to Tong. The case is proving very difficult to proceed, and it has been submitted to the High Court for review. The Notorious Bandit in the Northern Township is Captured: Xu Yuan, a notorious bandit in the northern township of Tongyi, specializes in kidnapping women, raping them, and selling them. He also gathers crowds to rob. On the twenty-first, he was captured by the police corps in Xiting and escorted to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<p>Representatives of the County Disaster Relief Association Go to the Department of Civil Affairs to Request Urgent Relief: The Zhenjiang County Party Headquarters and the County Government believe that the disaster situation in the county is serious and that there is an urgent need for rescue. Therefore, yesterday, they convened representatives of various agencies and organizations in the County Party Auditorium to hold a disaster relief meeting and elected seven agencies and organizations, including the Zhenjiang County Party Headquarters, as members of the Disaster Relief Association. After the meeting, Tan Peiyan of the County Party Headquarters, Zhang Peng of the County Government, Wu Shengfu of the Money Trade Association, Huo Rentai of the County Farmers' Association, and Zhao Xianbai of the County Chamber of Commerce jointly went to the Department of Civil Affairs to petition. Director Hu personally met with them and promised to do his best to allocate funds according to the opinions of the representatives.</p>
<p>The Unscrupulous Merchant Zhu Yuehua is Sent to the Public Security Bureau: The inspection team of the Provincial Public's Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Association discovered sixty bags of Japanese sugar being transported by Yao Yiwan's Fuxiang Company at the riverside the other day. They immediately ordered them to go to the Anti-Japanese Association to complete the registration procedures for Japanese goods before selling them. However, Zhu Yuehua, the manager of the company, refused to comply and acted unreasonably. Therefore, the Aid to Overseas Chinese Association sent a letter to the Fourth Branch of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, requesting that the manager be taken to the General Bureau for detention pending handling.</p>

<p>The Tenth District's Disaster Situation After the Water Subsides: Although the water level in the Grand Canal has now stabilized slightly, there are still many dangerous sections along the canal. The Jiangdu section has purchased a large number of wooden piles and hired the Yuan Wheel to transport them to the construction site on the twenty-second for use. In the tenth district, the area from Hanjia Ditch, Baijia Lane, and Xujia Lane in the east to Huaizibiqao in the south and Huangbing Bridge in the north to Miaotou Town in Huohao Township is a sea of water. More than 70,000 disaster victims are mostly living by stealing lives from treetops. In the fourth district, the collapse of the Bihu Dam caused flooding of residential buildings, and the northwest corner has become a waterland.</p>
<p>The Jiang-Zhejiang Masses Gathered at the Shahe Dam: At about 9:00 AM on the twenty-first, nearly a thousand people from Jiang-Zhejiang gathered at Shahe Dam outside Dongguan, claiming to protect the dam. The county government telephoned the Jiangdu section for inquiries. The section stated that there was no talk of opening the dam and sent personnel to the dam to explain to the people. After a while, Zang Liuqi, the chief of the second district, also arrived by car and announced to the people that it was a rumor. However, the people were still unable to believe it and have sent representatives to the county to petition. The county government again told them that it was currently raising the height of the dam and that there was no talk of opening the dam. The people from Jiang-Zhejiang who came to protect the dam are still stationed at the dam and have not returned.</p>

<p>Rice Merchants Attempt to Manipulate Prices and Are Discovered: Due to the extraordinarily severe floods in various provinces, rice prices in Ningbo ports and rice shops suddenly rose. Therefore, unscrupulous merchants are doing a lot of speculative business by selling short. The rice merchant in charge of this matter is Shunhe Rice Shop on Houtang Street, Jiangdong. The shop was opened by Shi Jitang. Shi believes that Ningbo's rice prices are based on Shanghai prices. Therefore, he secretly sent Secretary Zhang Zhongying (also known as Amao) to Shanghai to counterfeit the seal of Dacheng Rice Shop in Shanghai. On the seventeenth, he telegraphed various large and small rice shops in Yongdi, reporting false price quotations. The rice shops in Ningbo received the telegram and registered with the telegraph office. However, the telegrams were all bookstore names, which was quite suspicious. Therefore, they telegraphed Dacheng to ask about the actual rice prices and asked if they had sent a telegram. They received a reply stating that they did not admit to any of this. They then realized that someone was forging telegrams in order to manipulate prices and profit. Therefore, the managers of each shop discussed with each other and secretly plotted to find a remedy. At 11:00 PM that night, Xu Guo ran into two salesmen, Shen Zirong and Zou Guangming, at the Xinxin Dance Hall. He promised to give them a reward of 500 yuan and asked them to find a way to crack the case. On the morning of the eighteenth, the two salesmen took eight policemen to wait at the port. They saw Amao coming down from the Ningxing ship in a hurry. They detained him, took him to the first branch of the second district, and found two receipts for the telegrams and a forged seal on the spot. It is said that Amao was temporarily bailed out by the Jiangdong Xiangtai Lumber Company. When the party and government agencies heard about this, they ordered the Rice Industry Association to investigate and verify the matter.</p>
<p>Feng Songqing is Kidnapped: Feng Zifan, a gentleman from Houchang, Yinxi, is the father of Feng Songqing, who owns a business and is somewhat well-off. At about 10:00 PM the other night, four bandits suddenly came with guns, broke down the door, and robbed a small alarm clock, a leather box, and two cheongsams, as well as more than ten silver dollars. After the looting, they kidnapped Feng Zi and took him out the door, heading south. When the detective team heard about it, they ordered each detective to investigate in different directions.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Letter from Bao Xiangzhong of Yangzhou <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I was very surprised to read the news item "The Yangzhou Sub-Service Member's Scheme to Entice a Singer Case" in the Yangzhou Communications column of your newspaper on August 19. According to the report, the prostitute Hua Yuchun claimed on August 1 that she did not want to be a prostitute and entered the Women's Relief Center. Mother Shen Gu suspected that Zhao Zhentan was one of the customers and suspected him of enticing her. Because Zhao has a marital relationship with me, she further falsely accused me of colluding with him. You should know that I have not inquired about matters within the Relief Center since I resigned as director of the Relief Center in March. Moreover, when Shen Yuchun entered the Relief Center, I was in Jingkou receiving medical treatment due to illness. When I heard the news and returned, I learned that the woman had been instigated by others to make all kinds of slanders. I filed a lawsuit with the Jiangdu County Court, accusing her of pointing out facts, damaging the reputation of others, falsely accusing me, and intending to subject others to criminal and disciplinary actions. On August 18, the prosecutor's office opened a court to investigate the matter. After the interrogation, it ordered Shen Gu to pay a bail of 200 yuan and obtain a shop guarantee to await summons. As for the superintendent's dismissal of me and the dispatch of personnel to recover my credentials, this has not happened to this day. I am writing to request a correction. I would be most grateful. Sincerely, Bao Xiangzhong, August 22,</p>

<h3 id="e97">Implementation Plan for Establishing Secondary Agricultural and Industrial Schools in Provinces and Cities <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The "Implementation Plan for Establishing Secondary Agricultural and Industrial Schools in Provinces and Cities" drafted by the Ministry of Education, along with the implementation plans for three types of specialized schools: agriculture, medicine, and engineering, were simultaneously approved by the 276th Central Political Conference. The Ministry of Education will soon issue a directive to all provinces and cities to comply. The text of the plan is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Secondary Agricultural Schools</p>
<p>(A) Establishment Methods: 1. Each province should first establish one secondary agricultural school in each former circuit district. Approximately four to five schools per province. If a province's finances are genuinely difficult, the schools may be established over three years. 2. After each province has established the required number of secondary agricultural schools in the former circuit districts, additional schools should be added to the former prefectural areas or the larger counties under the direct jurisdiction of the former subprefectures, one school per district, to be completed within three years. 3. Each district should select the village within the district that has the most wasteland and is easily accessible from all counties within the district as the location for establishing the secondary agricultural school. 4. Each secondary agricultural school must be attached to a farm of at least 500 mu and a forest farm of considerable area. If a forest is established, it should be attached to a forest farm of at least 1,000 mu. If it is not easy to allocate or purchase this amount of land at once, it may be gradually expanded, but it must meet the minimum requirement within three years at the latest. 5. Students entering the secondary agricultural school must have graduated from junior high school or have equivalent academic ability, be physically strong, and be willing to engage in agriculture after graduation.</p>
<p>(B) Establishment Standards: 1. The purpose of secondary agricultural schools is to cultivate talent capable of independently managing various agricultural activities, farm technicians, farm instructors, agricultural extension officers, personnel for farmer cooperation and rural improvement, and primary school agriculture teachers. 2. In addition to the compulsory general agricultural courses, secondary agricultural schools may offer courses in forestry, sericulture, etc., depending on local agricultural conditions and the financial resources of the province. 3. The duration of study in secondary agricultural schools is set at three years. 4. The proportion of time spent on classroom instruction and practical work in secondary agricultural schools should be approximately equal. 5. Secondary agricultural schools do not have summer vacations, but classwork may be reduced during hot weather. 6. Secondary agricultural schools should focus on agriculture, promote farmers' economies, rural improvement, and cooperative endeavors. 7. Secondary agricultural schools should be attached to agricultural cooperative organizations to facilitate practical training. 8. Secondary agricultural schools should be attached to a simple agricultural museum (including farm tools and agricultural products) and may hold agricultural exhibitions. 9. Secondary agricultural schools should be attached to an agricultural extension department to effectively connect with farmers around the school and implement agricultural improvement initiatives. 10. Secondary agricultural schools should be attached to farmers' supplementary schools and various short-term agricultural training courses, to be determined as needed depending on the environment. 11. The construction cost of secondary agricultural school buildings is approximately 50,000 yuan per school, and the equipment cost is 30,000 yuan. The purchase cost of attached farms and forest farms, if purchased, must be raised separately. 12. The recurring expenses of secondary agricultural schools, with all grades in each department complete and two classes per grade, are estimated at 40,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>(2) Secondary Industrial Schools</p>
<p>(A) Establishment Methods: 1. Any city with a population of 100,000 or more must establish one secondary industrial school. If there are multiple such cities in a province, the schools may be established sequentially over three years. 2. In addition to establishing one industrial specialized school in each city under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, one secondary industrial school must also be established, either attached to the industrial specialized school or established independently. 3. After all secondary industrial schools in each city have been established, the cities should gradually increase the number of schools as needed, depending on the development of each school. 4. Students entering the secondary industrial school must have graduated from junior high school or have equivalent academic ability, be physically strong, and be willing to engage in industry after graduation.</p>
<p>(B) Establishment Standards: 1. The purpose of secondary industrial schools is to cultivate technical personnel for various industries, individuals capable of independently managing small industries, and primary school industrial teachers. 2. Secondary industrial schools are divided into departments such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, architecture, applied chemistry, dyeing and weaving, and ceramics. The departments to be established should be determined based on the local industrial situation and social needs. A school may establish one or several departments. 3. The duration of study in secondary industrial schools is set at three years. 4. Secondary industrial schools should be attached to factories with complete and sufficient equipment for students' practical training. 5. The proportion of time spent on classroom instruction and practical work in secondary industrial schools should be approximately equal. 6. Secondary industrial schools should establish close ties with local factories. Factories should provide opportunities for secondary industrial school students to visit, study, or receive practical training. 7. Secondary industrial schools should establish industrial exhibition rooms for research purposes. 8. Secondary industrial schools should be attached to industrial product societies to promote and extend the manufacture of domestic goods. 9. Secondary industrial schools should be attached to various short-term industrial training classes and adult supplementary classes, etc. 10. The construction cost of secondary industrial school buildings is approximately 50,000 yuan per school. If multiple departments are established, the cost of factory equipment, establishment, and recurring expenses should be increased accordingly. The regulations for each department are as follows: Establishment costs (including factory equipment costs): Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Department: 120,000 yuan; Civil Engineering and Architecture Department: 50,000 yuan; Applied Chemistry Department: 100,000 yuan; Dyeing and Weaving Department: 100,000 yuan; Ceramics Department: 50,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e99">Normal School Trainees Allowed to Take High School Normal Department Entrance Exams <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Jilin Education Department to the Ministry of Education, in the past, due to a lack of primary school teachers, the department formulated brief regulations for normal school training institutes, ordering them to be established by various counties and attached to schools in various provinces to meet the immediate need. Graduates of the three-year training courses were recruited from graduates of higher primary schools, and their curriculum was roughly the same as that of junior high school, except that the English subject was removed and educational subjects were added. Some of these graduates wish to continue their studies. Recently, because the English subject has been included as an elective in the normal school curriculum standards, these students have petitioned to be allowed to take the high school normal department entrance exams to deepen their knowledge. Upon investigation, these students originally possess the same qualifications and years of study as junior high school students, except that they have not studied English, which is a special case. The matter concerns changing the entrance qualifications, and the department has wired to request an explanation of whether it is feasible. The Ministry of Education replied that if the normal school students in the province originally possess the same qualifications and years of study as junior high school students, they should be allowed to take the high school normal department entrance exams. You are hereby notified.</p>

<p>The Chahar Education Department inquired to the Ministry of Education whether the "xuetong" (school director) mentioned in Zhangbei County's previous report refers to the "xuetong" of public rural schools, some of whom are appointed by the county government or education bureau, and whether they are the same as the school board members of private schools, and whether they can be considered as having the qualifications of current educational administrative personnel listed in Article 16, Section 2 of the Education Association Law. The Ministry of Education replied that school board members of public and private schools at all levels shall not be regarded as current educational administrative personnel. You are hereby notified.</p>

It is heard that Ying has agreed, and the Education Bureau's report was issued last night.</p>

<p>Defu (Canada) 6-2 6-3 6-4 Jiang Daozhang (China)</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Immediately Overcomes The Enemy In the China-Canada match, Qiu Feihai and Litt were the first to bear the brunt. Canada seems to have used a trick by using Litt as the first singles, which should not have been done. With Qiu's skills, there is no question about winning against Litt. However, Qiu's performance yesterday was not the best. Perhaps because the enemy was weak, the wonderfulness was greatly reduced. Qiu served and won a game, and Litt also got a game, thus dividing the points equally at 2-2. Then Qiu won four consecutive games to win the first set. Litt only won the second game of the second set, and then the entire army was wiped out in the third set. Qiu didn't use much effort yesterday, and he often saw himself sacrificing the ball that he couldn't return, probably to save energy. Later, there were several very accurate corner shots, which were very spectacular. Litt has great arm strength. Qiu's racket once hit a serve, but he couldn't answer it. Unfortunately, double faults were piled up, and there were many suicides hitting the net. In the last set, he seemed to have no intention of fighting.</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang Resist Defu Jiang De succeeded Qiu Li in the battle. Defu's profound skills were greatly displayed yesterday. Jiang had been cautious in the early stages of the war, intending to plot a resistance, and the war party knew that it was incomparable. There are many tricks in this group of hits, and the two often run up to block the net, while Defu's backhand volley on the net is smooth, powerful and beautiful. Jiang often had double faults and wild ball serves on the net, which often made the winning game fail. Defu's fast and urgent ball is especially noteworthy. In the first set, Jiang only won one game after one to five, and ended with two to six. In the second set, Jiang seemed to be invigorated, creating three to three numbers. Unfortunately, he lost three consecutive games again, and lost again at three to six. In the third set, after three to three, he lost two more games, and then recovered a game to lose at six to four. It is a pity that the two or three sets were relatively hopeful, but they did not succeed first. Jiang's skills have greatly improved compared to the past.</p>

<p>| Two Singles All Win |</p>
<p>Biao Jixiong (Japan) 6-2 6-4 6-1 Kanafanluo (Portugal)</p>
<p>Machida (Japan) 6-2 6-0 6-2 H Kelasha (Portugal)</p>
<p>Kanafanluo's trick did not sell In the Japan-Portugal group, the first singles Kanafanluo against Biao Jixiong of Japan. Ka knew that Biao's shot could not be resisted by anyone, so in the first two sets, he used the method of light and falling attack to make Biao run wildly from near and far. However, sometimes when encountering light, it often fails to pass the net, and Biao stands in a very appropriate position and can respond. Therefore, the trick is not sold after all. Biao used a fierce shot as soon as he encountered an opportunity. Ka knew that it had become invalid and fought against him. In the end, he lost. In the second set, Ka once took the lead with four to three, but unfortunately lost three games and lost once. In the third set, he only got one game in the fifth game. It is very difficult to defeat Biao. also</p>
<p>Kelasha was defeated by Machida before the war. Kelasha seemed to be able to win against Machida, but the result was not. The Japanese are good at long shots, and Ke also uses shots to counter them, so how can he not be defeated? Ke sometimes comes forward to block the net, but he is unable to exert force or is not effective, and he often cannot kill the enemy. Therefore, he was defeated by the Japanese shots. After losing three games in the first set, Ke won back two games and lost by two to six. In the second set, he did not return a piece. After the third set was tied at two to two, he lost again by two to six.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Four Groups All Lost Three Straight <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's singles in four groups, the situation was exactly the same, all going one-sided, ending with three straight losses. In this three straight losses, the highest score was six to four, and there were numbers such as seven, five, eight, six, etc. The disparity in the situation can be seen at a glance.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Today's Doubles In Two Groups <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 4:30 pm</p>
<p>Today is the second day of the semi-finals. Starting at 4:30 pm, China vs. Canada and Japan vs. Portugal, a total of three doubles groups are related to wins and losses, especially China-Canada. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Jiang Daozhang (China) vs. Defu Litt (Canada)</p>
<p>Biao Machida (Japan) vs. Gussi Tankelasha (Portugal)</p>
<p>The line-up of Portugal is announced as such, I am afraid there will be changes, or Kanafanluo Kelasha will be changed, or Kanafanluo and Yitafulas may also be changed, it is not yet known.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Disaster Relief Fundraising from All Walks of Life Yesterday's News <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The floodwaters in the disaster area are gradually receding, and disaster relief efforts are underway</p>
<p>Looking at yesterday's news, the floodwaters in the disaster area seem to have gradually receded, and disaster relief efforts from all walks of life are underway. However, the salt shortage and the problems of accommodation and epidemic prevention are quite challenging for the relief workers to study. The various news heard yesterday is compiled as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Important News Received Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Baker Telegraphed that the Han River is Gradually Receding: According to the Water Disaster Relief Committee, Mr. Baker telegraphed from Hankou on August 22nd, stating that aerial reconnaissance over the Han River basin revealed that the water was gradually receding. Most of the land had become mud, and the flooded area extended 60 miles northwest from Hankou.</p>
<p>Minister Song Ordered Merchants to Transport Salt to Aid the People: According to the National News Agency, yesterday's telegram from Hankou stated that the salt reserves there were entirely submerged, causing hardship for merchants and salt scarcity. The reporter specially called on Minister Song to inquire about the measures being taken. Minister Song replied that he had ordered the Hubei Salt Monopoly Bureau to supervise merchants in moving salt and had sent officials to survey the situation in order to salvage it. He had also ordered merchants to continuously transport salt by land and distribute it to various banks to supply the people with food. As for the concerns of Hubei banks and salt merchants that the current salt tax was high and the new salt law stipulated a lower salt tax, and that transporting and storing salt on various banks might result in losses when the new salt law was implemented, Minister Song stated that laws and regulations have implementation periods. Before the implementation of the new salt law, the government would definitely consider the situation and properly plan to ensure that salt merchants do not suffer any losses due to the reduction of the new salt tax. Merchants should not worry excessively.</p>
<p>The Social Bureau Drafted Measures for Sheltering Disaster Victims: This year's flood is massive, and it is reported that hundreds of thousands of refugees from affected provinces will come to Shanghai, making it urgent to find ways to accommodate them.

<p>Ningbo Community Held a Meeting to Urgently Aid the Hankou Disaster: The Ningbo Shanghai Association and the Shanghai Siming Guild Hall convened a general meeting yesterday at the Association's lecture hall on Tibet Road to discuss ways to urgently aid fellow Ningbo natives affected by the disaster in Hankou. Over a hundred people attended, and Yu Qiaqing was elected chairman. The chairman declared the meeting open, briefly stating that the disaster in Hankou was extremely severe, and fellow Ningbo natives in Hankou were suffering in dire straits. The Association, along with the Shaoxing seven counties Shanghai Association and the Shanghai Siming Guild Hall, had organized an emergency relief team to Hankou, carrying food and medicine, but urgently needed funds. He requested all fellow Ningbo natives to actively donate and contribute to the righteous cause. Zhang Shenzhi then reported on the situation of the emergency relief efforts in Hankou. The meeting then discussed fundraising methods. Mr. Wu Zhihao proposed dividing the fundraising into two categories: assigned fundraising and donations. Those assigned to fundraise would be responsible for a team, with a quota of 2,000 yuan, while those making donations would freely sign up for the amount they wished to donate. The goal was initially set at 200,000 yuan. Mr. Fang Jiaobo seconded the proposal, and it was passed after discussion by the chairman. Those who signed up for assigned fundraising on the spot included Wu Yaqin, Mao Heyuan, Lou Xunru, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Jiguang, Chen Songyuan, Fang Jiaobo, He Shaoting, Wang Guanxin, Sun Meitang, Xu Shengchan, Wang Boyuan, Yu Zuoting, Hong Xianfang, Fang Shiru, Ge Yuchen, Yang Yongxiang, Wu Zhihao, Zheng Chengqing, Li Zhexiong, Zheng Yuanxing, the Zhejiang Ningbo Guild Hall, Zhang Shenzhi and Cai Qinshun (jointly), Zhu Meixian and Jin Runxiang (jointly), Feng Jingzhai and Shi Zhikun (jointly), Ge Yuchen and Zhu Zikui (jointly), totaling twenty-six teams (52,000 yuan).

The total of the two categories was 72,000 yuan. Fellow Ningbo natives who were unable to attend the meeting due to other commitments would also be solicited for donations separately.</p>
<p>Jiang Zuobin Formed a Shanghai-Based Relief Fundraising Office: The Hubei Flood Emergency Relief Association held its tenth executive committee meeting on the 21st and resolved to send a telegram to twelve fellow Hubei natives in Shanghai, including Jiang Zuobin, to organize a Shanghai-based relief fundraising office. They also mailed thirty donation booklets on the same day. After receiving the telegram, Jiang and the others temporarily set up an office at No. 78 Gongshun Lane, Wuma Road, and scheduled an inaugural meeting for tomorrow to elect responsible personnel and raise relief funds to save the people affected by the disaster.</p>
<p>Continued Report on the Hubei Association's Fundraising Efforts: The Hubei Shanghai Association's Hubei Province Flood Emergency Relief Committee issued a fundraising appeal yesterday, stating: "Our Hubei is unfortunately struck by a heavenly disaster. Since the beginning of summer, incessant rain has led to mountain torrents, like water pouring down from a high roof. The Yangtze and Han rivers have overflowed, like arrows shooting through rapids. The levees have been breached, and houses have been washed away. Plants are swept along by the waves, and corpses float down the river. The plains have turned into a swamp, boundless and limitless. The highlands appear like floating bubbles, disappearing in an instant. The submersion of the city of Jinyang is not enough to compare to its extent, and the flooding of the seven armies cannot be compared to its magnitude. Moreover, the disaster area has reached over forty counties, and the number of disaster victims exceeds several million. Speakers are silenced, and listeners shed tears. It is truly a unprecedented catastrophe. We, as fellow natives, are concerned about our homeland and pity the displaced. We see bodies that have not yet turned to worms, suffering the misery of swimming with fish and turtles. The young and strong cry out in hunger on the road, while the old and weak wail on the mountain peaks. The urgency is greater than fire burning eyebrows, and the danger is akin to total destruction. If we borrow the ferry of compassion, we must spread the gold of the earth. When the滔天 is subsided and the安澜 is celebrated, when we find the millet and sorghum in the ruins of the graves and tread on the mud and sand of the flat ground, there is no hope of a harvest in the autumn, and how can we plan for clothing and food in the winter? It is unbearable to think of not providing relief early. Therefore, we have organized the Hubei Province Flood Emergency Relief Committee under this association to solicit donations and relieve the disaster victims. However, a cup of water is useless to a cart of burning firewood, but those with hair tied in crowns and those with disheveled hair all have compassion. We hope that those who uphold morality and benevolence and those who are compassionate will not shirk their responsibility, but will be courageous and act righteously. Either share Bao Shu's gold or contribute Chun Ren's wheat. The more the better, every grain is a pearl, reducing the flow of springs in the four seas and widely reviving the lean in the ditches. Pour down the sweet dew of the nine heavens to revive the souls at the bottom of the cauldron. We sincerely hope for your kind understanding." Yesterday, we also received a notification from the Shanghai Bank, stating that donations received included: Shanghai Kangcheng Winery (500 yuan), Guan Huai Shantang (250 yuan), Zhou Zhizang and Zhou Miaohai Lay Buddhist (200 yuan each), Chen Jingshan and Fang Keji (200 yuan each), Yu Jiyitang (150 yuan), Tongyi, Zhou Shengchao Lay Buddhist, Wu Shan, Song Jijiucui, Zhengda, Yuchun, and Xia Kunshan (100 yuan each), Tongfeng, Guan Zhuangzhu, Guan Jingzhi, Song Jiju, Guan Yingui, Dafeng, and Yuqing (50 yuan each), She Angxiao (40 yuan), Liang Wanfa, Kedai, and Chongyu (30 yuan each), Yan Xintai, Hengxingxiang, Zhenji, Dunhoutang, and Hongyu (25 yuan each), Peng Zhongshan, Hu Hengfeng, He Xinshun, and anonymous (20 yuan each), Hu Hongcheng (15 yuan), Xiong Jingcheng (12 yuan), Juyuanxiang, Zhou Fuji, Guan Chuhui, Tingsongji, Mingji, and Zhang Cengzhan (10 yuan each), Yu Yuantai, Tianfaxiang, Wei Yongshun, and Jinyushu (5 yuan each), Zhang Runshi (4 yuan), Yan Jinting (3 yuan), Shunhan (2 yuan), Hu Laojiu (1 yuan), totaling 3,302 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Bank Raised 100,000 Yuan for Relief: Mr. Zhuang Dezhi, chairman of the board of directors of the Shanghai Bank, and Mr. Chen Guangfu, general manager, believed that the current flood was extremely severe and urgently needed relief. They consulted with the board of directors and proposed donating 50,000 yuan for flood relief from this year's profit and loss account, and also having all employees donate 40% of their monthly salary, amounting to 25,000 yuan. The board of directors convened a regular meeting, chaired by Mr. Zhuang Dezhi, with Chen Guangfu, Yang Dunfu, Xu Jingren, Wu Weiying, Huang Huannan, Xia Xiaofang, and Luo Yuesheng in attendance. After the chairman and Chen Guangfu finished reporting, Director Xu Jingren proposed that the severity of the flood had attracted worldwide attention, and since the employees, despite their year-round hard work, were still able to generously donate, the shareholders should not ignore it. He requested to withdraw 25,000 yuan from the dividend, making a total of 100,000 yuan, to be distributed separately, pending ratification by the shareholders' general meeting. The entire board agreed and passed the proposal. The allocation of funds to various parties is as follows: National Government Flood Relief Committee (25,000 yuan), Hubei Flood Emergency Relief Association (25,000 yuan), Jiangsu Flood Relief Association (12,000 yuan), Capital Flood Emergency Relief Association (3,000 yuan), Anhui Flood Relief Association (6,000 yuan), Jiangxi Flood Relief (6,000 yuan), Bengbu, Wuhu, and Anqing Flood Relief (6,000 yuan), Hunan Changsha Flood Relief (2,000 yuan), Guangdong Flood Relief (2,000 yuan), Henan Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Shaanxi Flood Relief (2,000 yuan), Fundraising for various provincial flood relief associations (10,000 yuan), Gansu Drought Relief (1,000 yuan).</p>
<p>International Relief Committee Held a Meeting: According to the North China Daily News, Westerners in this city have organized an International Relief Committee for the Yangtze River flood. A meeting was held at the Welfare Company yesterday afternoon, chaired by Major Nasan. As the invitation letters were only sent out the day before, not many people attended. The various proposals were briefly discussed, and it was decided to hold another meeting next Monday for detailed discussion and to select a subcommittee to handle the various tasks. Among the proposals was renting a ship to serve as a hospital, staffed entirely by medical personnel from the churches, to go to Hankou and other places for epidemic prevention and emergency relief. In addition, Mr. Guo, the representative of the National Flood Relief Committee established by the National Government, inquired about the relationship between the committee and the National Relief Committee, as the National Relief Committee had already invited foreign representatives to join, and its scope was already international in nature. Chairman Nasan replied that raising relief funds from foreigners would be easier if a separate organization was formed. The committee was established for this reason and would naturally cooperate with the National Flood Relief Committee. The two groups would consult with each other on relief matters.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Voluntarily Provided Disaster Relief: The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union held its sixth joint meeting at the Workers' Club yesterday to discuss donating money to relieve flood disasters in various places. The following resolutions were passed: A. Measures: (1) Those with salaries under 50 yuan will donate one day's salary; (2) those with salaries between 50 yuan and 200 yuan will donate two days' salary; (3) those with salaries above 200 yuan will donate three days' salary. B. Donations: The Post Office will temporarily advance the full amount of the donations, which will be deducted in two installments in the September and October paychecks. C. Disaster relief publicity: The Propaganda Committee will be responsible for publicity. D. All donations will be used to purchase flour, half of which will be transported to Hankou and entrusted to the Hankou Postal Administration for distribution, and the other half will be sent to the National Government Relief Affairs Committee for responsible distribution. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<p>The Ratepayers Association Urged Residents to Donate for Relief: The Shanghai Foreign Settlement Chinese Ratepayers Association issued a notice yesterday urging residents to donate for the relief of the floods in various provinces, stating: "The current flood has affected sixteen provinces and 50 million compatriots, who are homeless, without food or clothing, with no way to heaven and no door to earth. They are fleeing famine and obstructed by water,守株待死. Those who see them are saddened, and those who hear of them are heartbroken. People are not made of wood or stone,鹿豕, and will surely have great compassion, and will not hesitate to donate. However, some say that due to years of banditry and human disasters, every family has a戒 of霜臨深. Rescuing those who are drowning cannot be delayed, but it is not reliable to rely on the井. The灾区 is far away, and the disaster can be avoided.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>It is better to accumulate wealth for the sake of 姬妾 and the enjoyment of descendants. Alas, they do not know that if the current flood is not urgently relieved, the consequences will be unimaginable. After a great flood, there will surely be a great epidemic. Epidemic toxins spread through the air, and their scope and speed are like radio waves, and it is difficult to escape regardless of whether one has money or not. This is the first reason why one should generously donate to save others for the sake of personal hygiene. After the great flood, family property is ruined. Driven by hunger, the disaster victims will take risks. If a quarter of the 50 million compatriots become bandits or are forced to join the 共, it is feared that we will all perish together. Wealth and honor will seem unattainable, and it will also be impossible for industry and commerce to make a living. This is the second reason why one should generously donate to save others for the sake of personal safety. Therefore, from the government down to the common people, the current flood is regarded as a critical juncture for the survival of the nation and the state, and they are working together to raise relief funds. Residents in our界 are always at the forefront of public service and righteousness. Regardless of whether they view disaster relief as charity or responsibility, they generously donate to save others and themselves. If they do not act quickly, the consequences will be endless. All donations should be sent to the designated bank to obtain a receipt. Saving lives is like putting out a fire. We respectfully ask for your kind consideration. Shanghai Foreign Settlement Chinese Ratepayers Association, August 22nd, year 20."</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation Convened a Disaster Relief Conference: Zhang Yi一, Yu Hualong, Wang Yansong, Yuan Luden, Wu Zhihao, Qian Longzhang, Cheng Xiechun, and other standing committee members of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation, in view of the disasters in various places, specially scheduled a conference of representatives from the Federation's district branches throughout the city for 2:00 PM on Tuesday, August 25th. All executive committee members of established branches must attend the meeting. If a branch has not been established, the organizers should attend the meeting to jointly discuss emergency disaster relief measures.</p>
<p>Suggestions for Raising Emergency Relief Funds: The 23rd District Branch of the Municipal Special District Citizens' Federation suggested to the Municipal Special District Citizens' Federation Committee ways to raise emergency relief funds, stating: "According to reports, floods in provinces along the Yangtze River have caused a catastrophic disaster unseen in centuries, which is shocking and unbearable to describe. Residents of this city, in view of this浩刦, should rise up and follow the example of邻恤, acting rather than just talking,节衣食食. Each person only needs to save one copper coin per day, which, if donated to the disaster area, will definitely save countless lives. Now, calculating based on the 2.7 million population of the special district, if each person donates one copper coin per day, one can obtain 10,000 silver dollars per day, which amounts to 300,000 yuan per month. The measures are outlined as follows: (1) Divide the special district into several areas; (2) place several donation boxes in each area; (3) appoint several local fair persons to be responsible for monitoring the donation boxes and collecting the funds; also appoint several reliable shops to temporarily store the donations in the boxes; (4) borrow several donation boxes from shops to be numbered and used as needed; (5) appoint several publicity personnel responsible for each area; (6) post slogans on 通要道. If this method is deemed feasible, please order each district branch to prepare for implementation in order to save黎, and also present it to various agencies, groups, and trade associations, so that a large-scale fundraising effort can be观成."</p>

Standing Committee members Zhang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, and Cheng Yiqing are extremely anxious and have already appointed another specialist to continue the investigation.</p>

<p>The Japanese Consul's Response is Absurd</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Japanese soldiers looting and assaulting inspectors of Japanese goods from the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association, after the municipal government sent a letter to the Japanese Consulate General on the 14th of this month to lodge a serious protest, the Japanese side considered the matter until yesterday morning, when they sent a formal reply. The content did not fully address the three demands for guarantees of compensation and punishment of the perpetrators. However, it is reported that the Japanese side claimed that the soldiers' actions were legitimate acts of rescuing merchants, which is absurd. After the municipal government received the Japanese side's reply, Mr. Murai, the Consul General of the Japanese Consulate, visited Mayor Zhang at the municipal government but left without achieving any results. It is still unknown whether the municipal government will lodge another protest against the Japanese side's reply and what its attitude towards the reply will be.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Chamber of Commerce Issues Circular to All Guilds to Expose Fellow Traders Selling Japanese Goods <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a circular to all trade guilds in the city, stating: Respectfully, on the 21st of this month, we received a letter from the Japanese Goods Inspection Committee established by this Chamber, stating that a permanent economic severance with Japan requires the self-awareness of merchants to be effective. Many merchants in our business community understand the greater good and genuinely resist Japanese goods, but it is feared that there are those who are blinded by profit and disregard the overall situation. Once someone intends to deceive, it will be impossible to prevent it. One bad apple spoils the whole bunch. Urgent preventive measures should be taken to safeguard the honor of all our merchants. Trade guilds are the leaders of their respective industries, with a deep understanding of the business conditions and the integrity of their members. Prevention can be thorough, and exposure will be effortless. If each trade guild regularly monitors the operation of its industry regarding Japanese goods and is responsible for reporting violations, then even cunning merchants will be exposed and unable to succeed. The day when we thoroughly eliminate inferior goods and defeat Japanese imperialism will surely come. The Chamber, having seen this, resolved in its first executive committee meeting to request your esteemed guild to forward a letter to all trade guilds, responsible for reporting fellow traders selling Japanese goods on record. We hereby record this for your information and urge prompt implementation, expressing our deepest appreciation, etc. Upon examination by the Chamber, each trade guild is responsible for correcting and reporting the actions of its members. Moreover, economic severance with Japan concerns the survival of the nation, making the situation even more significant than the usual "correction of business malpractices." Since each guild is closely monitoring and easily investigating, if reports are made promptly, those who violate the agreement for personal gain will be deterred. If the truth is concealed, not only will the meaning of "merchant self-regulation" be completely lost, but it will also create unnecessary chaos and invite criticism from the outside world. We issue this particularly earnest notice, hoping for strict attention and diligent handling. The Chamber will observe the determination of each guild in handling this matter, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e128">British-Owned Buses to Halt Service Entirely Today <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Company Prepares to Hire New Workers, Managed to Keep a Few Routes Running Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the strike by all ticket sellers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, Routes 1, 2, 5, and 9 managed to operate with difficulty yesterday. The terms of employment have not been negotiated. All routes will completely cease operation today. The company is preparing to hire new workers. The arrested workers have been released. The various situations yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Negotiations Still Stalled After all ticket sellers went on strike on the 20th, the strike committee presented nine terms of employment. Five representatives were sent to the company for negotiations that day, but the traffic superintendent refused to accept them. The strike committee has not sent representatives for contact in the past two days, insisting on continuing the strike, making a resolution difficult for the time being.</p>
<p>Route Conditions Yesterday, ticket inspectors continued to act as ticket sellers on the buses. Ten buses operated on Route 1 from Jing'an Temple to the Park Shooting Range, six on Route 2 from Er Yang Jing Bridge to the Park Shooting Range, three on Route 5 from San Mao Ge Bridge to the North Station, ten on Route 9 from Jing'an Temple to the Power Plant, one A Express, and one C Express, totaling thirty-one buses. The operating hours were from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM. The remaining Routes 3, 6, 7, and 10, etc., are still suspended due to a lack of ticket sellers.</p>
<p>Service Suspended Today The British-owned China General Omnibus Company issued a notice yesterday by Traffic Superintendent Mr. Byatt (transliteration), stating, "All staff will be granted a special holiday on the 23rd of this month. Normal service will resume on Monday. This notice." Due to this, Routes 1, 2, 5, and 9, which managed to operate with difficulty, will also be suspended today. The public buses in the Public Concession will cease operations entirely today. If the ticket seller strike is not resolved by tomorrow, the ticket inspectors will continue to act as ticket sellers, managing to operate a few routes.</p>
<p>New Workers Hired After holding a board meeting on the morning of the 20th, the company, in addition to finding ways to restore all routes of public buses, reportedly requested the General Inspectorate of the Municipal Council to recruit new ticket sellers. The General Inspectorate had already hired dozens of people yesterday and sent them to the company's main factory at 263 Connaught Road in the morning for training. Once the training is completed, they will be dispatched to work on various bus routes.</p>
<p>Authorities Taking Precautions Since the British-owned public bus ticket sellers went on strike, Ren Liping, the Sixth District Chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has not only sent personnel for thorough investigation but has also dispatched long-term police officers to guard the vicinity of the main factory on Connaught Road for several days to prevent any disturbances. Because the area is an extraterritorial road built by the Municipal Council, the Gordon Road Police Station has also dispatched patrol officers to guard the area for prevention.</p>
<p>Workers Released Two new ticket sellers, numbers 45 and 240, who were arrested by the Gordon Road Police at the intersection of Connaught Road and Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai on the morning of the 21st of this month, have reportedly been released after being questioned by the police chief.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Russian Impersonates Official in Arms Trafficking Case <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Debate Concluded Yesterday, Judgment Scheduled for the 29th</p>
<p>The Russian, Leviskei Peek, and the Chinese, Wei Xiaolan, colluded to impersonate officials of the National Government, ordering over 1.8 million yuan worth of arms from the British trading firm, Lai Far. They forged seals, altered documents, and attempted to extort money from Zhu Ziyao, the owner of the Qiu Xin Factory, through intimidation. The Public Security Bureau filed a public prosecution, and the First Special Court has repeatedly summoned them, scheduling a date for the start of the debate. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiashi, the presiding judge of the criminal division, continued the trial in Criminal Division One. He first questioned Peek, asking if he had anything to say. Peek replied in English, which was translated by interpreter Jiang Baoliang, saying, "I have much to say, but all important documents are with my attorney, P. M. (French). Today, Attorney P. M. is not appearing in court because I cannot afford to pay the legal fees, and the documents have not been returned. This situation seriously harms the ethics of lawyers. I have nothing else to say." The court then ordered:</p>
<p>To begin the debate, Attorney Ru Bao-yi, representing the Public Security Bureau, rose and argued, "The Public Security Bureau accuses Leviskei Peek of violating Article 165 of the Criminal Law, impersonating a public official of the Republic of China, Article 224 of the same law, altering documents, Article 370 of the same law, extortion through intimidation, and additionally accuses Leviskei Peek personally of violating Article 234 of the Criminal Law, forging seals. Wei Xiaolan is accused of violating Articles 165 and 370 of the Criminal Law. Before debating the defendants' crimes, I will</p>
<p>Raise two points for the court's attention that are unrelated to this case. Because the defendant's lawyer will inevitably mention them, I, as the attorney, will raise them first. (1) Is Lai Far a seller of arms? Assuming that Lai Far is indeed selling arms, is he violating the law or breaking British law? Because the Public Security Bureau did not prosecute, we will not discuss it for now. (2) Did Lai Far sell the arms to the Cantonese? From a high-minded perspective, one would say that Lai Far is not helping the National Government but assisting the Cantonese faction, which could lead to other international discussions. However, this is irrelevant to the case and can also be disregarded. Now, regarding the defendant's</p>
<p>Criminal facts, let's discuss whether Zhang Faying exists. If he exists, is he actually Zhang Faying himself? The Public Security Bureau believes that he does not exist or is an imposter. According to the testimony of accomplice Wei Xiaolan, the two defendants, Leviskei Peek and Wei Xiaolan, told him that he could not act as a military commander, only as a secretary. This point is naturally disproven. Let's further examine whether the two defendants, Leviskei Peek and Wei Xiaolan, were impersonating public officials. The defendants went to the plaintiff's place, claiming to be military advisors to the National Government, and the National Government does have such positions, so regardless of who they are, they are committing a crime. However, Wei Xiaolan's impersonation as Secretary to Military Commander Zhang Faying does not need much debate because he</p>
<p>has already confessed. Has each of the defendants been to Lai Far? It has been proven by Lai Far, Carlo, and others, so their impersonation of public officials is very clear. Regarding the alteration of documents, on the contract, before the word "witness," the word "guarantor" was added. The defendant submitted a contract with the word "guarantor." The plaintiff submitted a contract without the word "guarantor." The Public Security Bureau's expert witness has previously proven that the word "guarantor" on the defendant's contract was added later. After adding the word "guarantor," the responsibilities of the witnesses, Carlo and Zhu Ziyao, become very different. According to British law, witnesses only prove the signing of the contract and do not cover fraud or intimidation. American law is the same, and</p>
<p>Chinese law must be similar. The guarantor's responsibility is different. If the contract cannot be fulfilled, the guarantor is responsible for fulfilling it. Therefore, a witness cannot also be a guarantor. If a guarantor also acts as a witness, in the event of a dispute, the guarantor can simply claim in court as a witness that there was indeed fraud or intimidation when signing the contract. Then the contract will certainly not be valid, and the guarantor will not be liable. Therefore, British law is very strict, and a guarantor cannot also act as a witness. Moreover, the plaintiff is British, and the contract was made with British people. How could the plaintiff not know this? The plaintiff has also entered into contracts before, so it is evident that</p>
<p>the defendant altered the document without a doubt. Furthermore, regarding the forging of seals by the defendants, the owner and employee of the Mei Tai Printing Bureau have testified that Leviskei Peek went to the printing shop and had a seal made to match Lai Far's seal. Public Security Bureau detectives have also testified that Leviskei Peek used Lai Far's stationery to stamp the seal when he picked it up. Although the defendants absolutely deny it, the evidence is undeniable. The reason they committed these crimes was to achieve their</p>
<p>goal of extortion through intimidation. They believed that the plaintiff was selling arms, so they would find another way to extort money. Suppose A steals someone's property, and B robs him. A is guilty of theft, and B is guilty of robbery. One cannot say that A's stolen property does not make B's robbery a crime. Initially, the Public Security Bureau was very doubtful about this case. When Wei Xiaolan was detained, the case became clear. Furthermore, Attorney Shi Zhuoren testified that the defendant hired him to demand a commission from Zhu Ziyao.</p>
<p>At that time, Attorney Shi told Zhu, "You are the guarantor, so you should bear the responsibility, and it is best to resolve this matter of arms." Attorney Shi did not believe there was any intimidating language, but Zhu Ziyao considered it extremely intimidating. Therefore, the defendant committed the crime of extortion through intimidation. I request the court to severely punish Leviskei Peek according to the law. Wei Xiaolan also had</p>
<p>helping actions, so I request that he also be punished." Following this, Attorney Fan Gang, representing Wei Xiaolan, argued that Wei did not know the details beforehand and was unwilling to go afterward, leading to a quarrel. Therefore, he requested the court to declare him innocent. Following this, Attorney Qiu Fenling, representing Peek and Leviskei, defended the two defendants according to the law. The key points were: (1) Military advisors do not have specific duties, so they cannot be considered to be impersonating public officials. (2) Alteration of documents, etc., cannot be directly proven to have been done by the defendants, so it cannot be established. Therefore, he requested that they be declared innocent. Judge Xu Jiashi then announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the morning of August 29.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Midnight Gunfire <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Man Shot and Killed on the Avenue du Parc</p>
<p>Three Gunshot Wounds Found on His Body</p>
<p>On the Avenue du Parc, built by the Municipal Council in the extraterritorial area, a murder occurred the night before last. The deceased was a young man, approximately twenty-five or twenty-six years old, wearing a Western suit, white shirt, white gabardine pants, black silk socks, and black leather shoes. Next to the body was a brown Western-style jacket and a felt hat. There were three gunshot wounds on his body: one in the back of the head, with the bullet lodged inside; one in the temple, with the bullet having passed through; and one in the chest, with the bullet not found. His entire body was covered in blood, a gruesome sight. He had a tattoo on his arm that had been removed with chemicals, leaving a large scar. The body was discovered near Guanghua University on Avenue du Parc between Lincoln Road and Zhongshan Road, a rather remote area. It is said that residents nearby heard several gunshots at approximately 11:30 PM when the incident occurred. It was also said that the victim appeared to have been brought to the location by car and then murdered by his enemies. Upon receiving the news, the Public Security Bureau of the Sixth District immediately dispatched police officers to the scene to investigate and apprehend the murderer. The body was unidentified, so they ordered the twenty-eighth Bao, seventh Tu, and local bailiff to report to the District Court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Yang and Examiner Shen arrived at the scene to conduct the autopsy and ordered the charitable organization to collect the body while awaiting the arrest of the murderer.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Film Industry Leads the Way in Aiding Flood Victims <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The current flood has spread across sixteen provinces, with the severity of the disaster being the worst in a century. People from all walks of life are heartbroken and are taking action to find relief methods. The managers of the theaters under the jurisdiction of the Central Film Company have voluntarily decided to select excellent films to show for three days. All proceeds earned during these three days, after deducting the original operating expenses of the theaters, will be donated to flood relief. These excellent films will be leased from various film production companies as usual. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Juchuan of the company, along with Mr. Bian Yuying of the Hua Wei Company, have written a letter requesting that all film production companies also donate all the rental fees they would have received. This act benefits the disaster victims, and all film production companies have an unshirkable duty and will undoubtedly agree. Furthermore, it is learned that Mr. Zhang has scheduled an invitation in his personal capacity for the managers of the theaters within the company's scope, as well as other theater managers such as Mingxing, Zhongshan, Tongsu, Xin Ailun, Changjiang, Broadway, Jiuxing, Penglai, Olympic, Zhabei, and Royal, etc., to the Great China Restaurant on Sichuan Road tomorrow at noon. The company's range includes seven theaters: Central, New Central, Empire, Cathay, Majestic, World, and China. With a total of eighteen theaters, the income from the three days will be considerable. It is also heard that Mr. Zhang plans to invite prominent figures from the new drama industry and film stars to perform at the Central Grand Theatre. If successful, it will not only create a sensation among the audience in Shanghai but also provide more benefits to the disaster victims in various provinces.</p>

<p>"Shun Mu Bridge," a New Drama Arousing the World, Contributes to Social Morality</p>
<p>The Cantonese opera performed by the Yongshounian Troupe at the Guangdong Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road in this city has a tight plot and noble meaning. It spares no effort in promoting and elaborating on our country's inherent morals. It can be described as "revolutionary art" without any shame. The art of actors such as Bai Yutang, Qianlijiu, and Li Haiquan is particularly commendable. All performances are able to vividly portray and understand human subtleties. The recently performed play "Shun Mu Bridge" picks up local anecdotes and is compiled into a new drama arousing the world. It embodies the intention of expounding ethics while changing customs and habits. The Municipal Education Bureau believes that this play has contributed to social morality and specially issued an commendation order yesterday to encourage them.</p>

<p>Huang Jinchen, the Director of the Shanghai-Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Association, passed away on May 30th of this year. The business he operated during his lifetime mainly consisted of silk factories and silk shops. In recent years, due to the decline of the commercial market, there have been many losses.

<p>Zhao Shixi, a 51-year-old resident of Dongchijiabang, Hongzhen, north of Shanghai, was a small landowner. It was rumored that he had a lot of money, which attracted the attention of bandits. At 11:00 PM the night before last, three bandits broke into his house. One bandit pulled out a gun to threaten him, and then they searched for valuables, stealing 21 yuan in cash. Dissatisfied, they continued to force Zhao to reveal the location of his hidden silver. When Zhao refused to give in, the bandits opened fire, shooting Zhao in the abdomen and foot. The bandits then fled in panic. Zhao fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. His family reported the incident to the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District, which ordered the arrest of the bandits. Zhao was sent to Hongkou Tongren Hospital for treatment, but the bullet in his abdomen could not be removed, and he lost too much blood. As a result, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 4:00 AM the next day. Upon learning of the incident, the Fifth District Precinct, in addition to reporting to the Public Security Bureau to dispatch detectives to track down the murderers, ordered Ling Renjie, the local bailiff of the Twenty-third Bao, Fifteenth Tu, to report the incident to the District Court.

<p>Ding Jinbao Plans to Return to His Hometown with His Mother</p>
<p>Kidnapped by Bandits Before Being Able to Embark</p>
<p>Shi Guibao Suspected of Having a Grudge Against the Woman's Father</p>
<p>Suspected of Coveting the Woman</p>
<p>Ding Zhushan from Yancheng makes a living by pulling rickshaws. He has two sons and one daughter. The eldest son, Jind, is twenty-two years old and married. The second daughter, Jinbao, is seventeen years old, and the youngest son, Jinlong, is fifteen years old. They live at No. 16 Feixing Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, and own seventy rickshaws, doing well in business. At around 2:00 AM yesterday, Ding's wife and children got up because Ding's wife planned to return to her hometown that day with her daughter to purchase farmland, preparing to board a ship to Yancheng, Jiangbei, at 5:00 AM. Suddenly, six bandits arrived. Three bandits jumped in through the window, and three waited outside by the car that had been prepared. Among them, one wore a white Zhongshan suit, one wore a white silk gown, and the rest wore short clothes. After the three bandits entered the room, they closed the front door and used guns to drive Ding and his wife into the right-side room. They then broke into Ding's eldest son's new room on the left, snatched Jinbao, locked the front door, and drove away in the car towards Taiyangmiao on Datong Road. The victim, Ding Zhushan, immediately went outside to report the incident to the Fourth District police officer, who reported it to the headquarters. The headquarters immediately ordered detectives to investigate, but they had disappeared. After the chief asked Ding about the details, Ding said that Shi Yulu's son, Guibao, who was in the same industry, had asked to borrow one hundred coppers from him last week. Ding refused because he was unwilling to lend it to him. Guibao was very angry at the time, saying, "I'll give you what you deserve," and left. Guibao is suspected of causing this incident. After verifying the confession, the chief immediately ordered the police to arrest Shi Guibao at Feixing Lane, but he had already fled. They took his father, Yulu, to the station for questioning. According to neighbors of the family, the kidnapped woman, Jinbao, is quite attractive, and Guibao has been coveting her for a long time. Hearing that Jinbao was returning to her hometown with her mother and was going to be promised to someone else, Shi Guibao feared being disappointed and resorted to this measure.</p>

<p>Violation of Article 21 of the Telecommunications Regulations</p>
<p>Guohua Electric Company, located at No. 418 Gongguan Road in the French Concession, has recently set up a radio station without the approval of the Ministry of Communications, disrupting the telegrams of the Ministry of Communications International Telegraph Office and Pinghan and other places within the country. The Ministry of Communications discovered this and sent a letter to the Political Department of the French Concession Police, requesting the court to issue a search warrant. The Ministry of Communications representative Xu Zhuoyun accompanied them to Guohua Electric Company to search at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Radio equipment was seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday, the police brought the case to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District for interrogation. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement. Xu Zhuoyun, the representative of the Ministry of Communications, stated that the defendant had not registered with the Ministry of Communications, set up a radio station without permission, and disrupted telecommunications, violating Article 21 of the Telecommunications Regulations. He requested that the case be investigated according to law. Zhao Xudong (40 years old, Cantonese), the manager of Guohua Electric Company, did not appear. His lawyer stated that the defendant was in Nanjing and would return to Shanghai in about a week, requesting a postponement for the hearing. Judge Wu Fanglian approved the postponement and scheduled a continued hearing for 9:00 AM on the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Remarkable Success of Shanghai-Taicang Company's Fire Extinguisher Trial <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company recently purchased several large and small fire extinguishers from the Aurora Foam Fire Extinguisher Distributor at 363 Zhejiang Road, Shanghai, to be installed at various stations in Liuhe, Luodian, Jiading, Shanghai, etc., for fire prevention. At around 9:00 AM yesterday, a trial was conducted on an open space west of the Shanghai station. A wooden shed was constructed, doused with kerosene, gasoline, and other fuels, and then set ablaze. As the fire raged, Yang Yimin, a staff member from the fire extinguisher distributor, carried a fire extinguisher and sprayed white foam. Within a minute, the fire was completely extinguished, to the amazement of the onlookers. Subsequently, a large lead basin filled with gasoline was ignited and extinguished in the same manner. The burned wood and the remaining gasoline in the basin were covered with a thick layer of white foam, isolating the fuel from the surrounding air, effectively smothering it like a blanket. Observers then watched as the staff members from the distributor assembled the equipment and prepared the chemical powders. There were two types of powders, slightly yellow and white. Each extinguisher used one can of each powder, the size of the can depending on the capacity of the extinguisher. The yellow powder was mixed with seven times its weight in water, stirred well, and placed around the inside of the extinguisher. The white powder was mixed with an equal weight of water and placed in a glass tube, which was inserted vertically into the yellow powder solution, kept separate. The upper end of the glass tube had multiple holes. After everything was assembled, the lid was closed. The extinguisher had a nozzle at the end. In case of fire, the extinguisher was inverted, and the white powder solution in the glass tube flowed out, mixing with the yellow powder solution, creating a twelve-fold expansion of white foam that could be sprayed onto the burning material to extinguish it immediately. According to the staff members from the distributor, this prepared foam can be stored for up to three years without losing its effectiveness. A 1-gallon "housewife" model costs 40 yuan, a "vehicle" model costs 45 yuan, a 2-gallon handheld model costs 50 yuan, a "vehicle" model is also 50 yuan, a 5-gallon fire department model costs 80 yuan, and a 22-gallon wheeled model costs 500 yuan. All prices include the chemical powders. Refills cost 5 yuan, 6 yuan, 12 yuan, or 50 yuan, depending on the size. The effectiveness surpasses that of imported products, and all raw materials are domestically sourced.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Business Community Enthusiastically Assists in Disaster Relief <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Xiang Songmao, General Manager of Wuzhou Pharmacy, recognizing the vastness of the flood-stricken areas and the severity of the disaster, has decided to contribute to the extent of his personal ability. Wuzhou's head office and its four branches at Tianhougong Bridge, Bazilu, Dongmen Road, and Penglai Market will donate 10% of their total sales revenue from July 24th (tomorrow) to July 30th, for a period of seven days. Additionally, 10% of the August salaries of all employees of the company and its manufacturing plant will be extracted as a donation. Other pharmacies under Xiang's management, such as Taihe Pharmacy, will also contribute in the same manner. It is also reported that the Chinese Soap Industry Guild, chaired by Xiang, will convene its members in the coming days to actively solicit donations to rescue the flood victims.</p>
<p>Xie Xing Pharmaceutical Factory: Recent rains have caused widespread flooding, leading to much suffering. Charitable organizations are actively providing relief, which has garnered the sympathy of the business community. Some generously open their purses, donating large sums, while others pledge a certain number of days' sales revenue to support the effort. This spontaneous generosity is a clear indication of the public's eagerness to help those in need. However, after a disaster, epidemics are likely to occur, especially in hot weather, with polluted waters and foul odors. Without sanitary medicines for prevention, epidemics will quickly erupt and be difficult to control. Recognizing this, the Xie Xing Pharmaceutical Factory in Shanghai has donated one case of "Sheng Dan" pills, totaling 12,000 pills worth 600 yuan, to Mr. Xiang Songmao of the Flood Relief Association for distribution in the disaster areas. These pills are known for their effectiveness in eliminating filth and preventing epidemics. They are commonly carried by travelers during summer and autumn and are especially important as a preventative measure in disaster areas where accumulated filth can easily breed epidemics. It is reported that these pills have already been shipped to the disaster areas along with other relief supplies.</p>
<p>Pei Lin Egg Factory: This year's floods in various regions are unprecedented in a century. Colleagues at the Pei Lin Egg Factory in Yangshupu, Shanghai, inspired by the spirit of human mutual assistance, have launched a fundraising campaign to assist in disaster relief. They will also contribute the funds allocated for this year's Ghost Festival (盂蘭會) and will soon hand them over to the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee for distribution.</p>
<p>Sun Yuxing Fan Shop: Sun Yuxing Fan Shop, located inside Xiaodongmen in Shanghai, recognizing the severity of the floods in various provinces, which are the worst in decades, has decided to donate a portion of its proceeds to aid the tens of millions of displaced fellow citizens who are in urgent need of relief. The shop will offer suitable elegant fans for sale for disaster relief purposes from today, August 23rd, to September 2nd, donating the entire sales revenue for a period of ten days, as well as 20% of the total wholesale revenue.</p>
<p>Guan Sheng Yuan: After the news spread that the Guan Sheng Yuan Food Company's catering department in Shanghai had voluntarily donated its yesterday's revenue for disaster relief, the restaurant was crowded with customers yesterday. The restaurant temporarily displayed heartbreaking images of disaster victims and used various eye-catching slogans to encourage people to donate to help the flood-stricken fellow citizens. The food prepared was even more exquisite than usual, and the tips collected by the waiters were also included in the donation. Representatives from other major food companies also visited yesterday to observe the situation, preparing to follow suit and continue the righteous act of disaster relief.</p>
<p>Qi Yi Glass Factory: Mr. Shen Lianghua, director of the Qi Yi Glass Factory of the Qi Yi Electric Company, unable to bear witnessing the widespread floods this year, voluntarily initiated a disaster relief association within the factory, setting a precedent for saving fellow citizens. The association is divided into two categories: immediate relief and long-term relief. Immediate relief involves a one-time donation, while long-term relief involves monthly installments over six months. This approach is very well-organized. Currently, the factory's colleagues and workers have donated over 300 yuan, which will be sent to the Provincial Flood Relief Association immediately to assist in disaster relief. We hope that all sectors will not be indifferent, but will spontaneously organize and emulate this initiative, so that the disaster victims may be fortunate.</p>

<p>Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, is one of the nation's leading sports experts. Over the past year, he has devoted his remaining time and energy to inventing "Tai Chi Exercise," based on the principles of physiology and sports, while incorporating the strengths of both Chinese and Western sports methods. He has repeatedly demonstrated and explained the exercise publicly in various regions of the country, earning unanimous praise from all sectors. This spring, he completed a book on the exercise, providing detailed descriptions, illustrations, and mnemonic rhymes, enabling self-study without a teacher. The book also includes discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese and foreign sports techniques and the structure of human physiology. In addition, prominent figures from the Party and government, such as Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, and Li Jinglin, have provided inscriptions, while Li Shizeng, Liu Shangqing, Zhang Yuejun, Zhang Zhijiang, and Xiao Zisheng have written prefaces based on their experiences in sports and their observations of Mr. Chu's performance, expressing their admiration. This demonstrates the book's value. After its completion, the book was entrusted to the Shanghai Dadong Bookstore for printing. After four months of careful review and revision, it is now being bound and will be published within a week. It will be distributed by the bookstore's retail department. It is reported that the Ministry of Education and other departments have agreed to promote the book. Below is a letter from the Ministry of Education to Mr. Chu: (Respectfully replying, we received your letter and a copy of the first draft of "Tai Chi Exercise," which we have read with great interest. We deeply admire your enthusiasm and insight in promoting sports and writing a book on the subject. When the complete book is published, please send us a copy so that we can study it together and develop methods for promotion. We hope you will consider this. Sincerely, the Ministry of Education to Mr. Chu Minyi.) It is predictable that the book will be highly sought after upon publication.</p>

<p>The China Harmonica Society recently filmed a sound movie at the repeated request of Tianyi Film Company. Conducted by the renowned harmonica expert Mr. Wang Qingxun, the result was exceptionally beautiful. Yesterday, the movie was screened at the Guanglu Grand Theater. The harmonica music was as sonorous and clear as a mountain stream, as melodious and delightful as string music, and deeply moving, earning the praise of both Chinese and foreign audiences. It is truly a pioneering achievement in the Chinese film industry. The society is purely dedicated to the study of harmonica music and the promotion of refined arts, unlike commercial organizations. The membership fees are very low, so the number of students from all sectors has reached over 600. The performance of each class is also excellent. It is recently heard that the Society, in order to popularize this music, will continue to recruit new members in September, with three classes: day, night, and noon. The classes will be taught by the President and Vice President, Mr. Wang Qingxun and Mr. Liu Yin. Anyone interested, regardless of gender or previous experience, can register at the Society at 168 Sichuan Road before August 31st. Additionally, Mr. Wang's recent book, "The Latest Harmonica Playing Method," has been typeset by the Commercial Press and should be published by the end of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Standardization of Weights and Measures in Shanghai <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Following the declaration of standardization of weights and measures in Shanghai on the 1st of this year, reporters from the News Agency visited Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau and Director Zhou of the Weights and Measures Testing Institute yesterday to inquire about the progress of implementation. The following is a summary of their conversations:</p>
<p>The Supply and Demand in the Market are Sufficiently Balanced: Currently, there are 67 registered shops and factories manufacturing weights and measures in the city, employing 370 workers with a total capital of 35,000 yuan. In the spring of this year, the Testing Institute repeatedly ordered the shops to rush the production of new instruments for the market. However, at the beginning of the reform, most shops were hesitant and took a wait-and-see attitude. On the government's side, the implementation of the new system in various provinces and cities followed procedures stipulated by the central government, which could not be delayed. Thus, the Weights and Measures Instrument Manufacturing Co., Ltd. was established as a joint public-private venture with the approval of the Ministry of Industry, starting with loans and orders for the products of various shops. After the establishment of the factory in early May, the shops began to actively produce new instruments and submit them to the Testing Institute for verification. According to statistics, the number of items accepted for verification each month was 6,805 in May, 27,990 in June, and 42,385 in July. As of August 20th, it has reached 32,629 items. The number has been increasing month by month, so the overall output in one month is sufficient to meet the needs of that month.</p>
<p>Adherence to New Instruments and Destruction of Old Instruments: Since July 11th, the Testing Institute, in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's published first-phase inspection program for industrial and commercial weights and measures, has been conducting inspections in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau's district offices. The inspection of approximately 2,000 shops in the Hunan district is expected to be completed by September 26th. The second phase of inspections will then be announced for either the Zhabei district or the Special District. According to the regulations of the Ministry, from the date of the announcement of standardization of weights and measures in a certain area, new instruments should be used, and old instruments that cannot be repaired should be destroyed according to law. However, as this is the initial stage of implementation, the Testing Institute, to facilitate preparation by merchants and residents, only requires shops that have not yet purchased new instruments to set a deadline for switching to new instruments and to make a firm commitment. As the deadlines set by these shops are either imminent or have already passed, they are now being ordered to adhere to the deadlines and use new instruments, subject to reinspection. Those who deliberately violate the rules will have their old instruments destroyed without further leniency. The Testing Institute has also recently stipulated that uninspected shops will be given a notice to</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>uniformly install new instruments and await inspection. If the manufacturing shops and factories are temporarily unable to supply enough new instruments, a purchase order should be obtained as proof, and it is not permissible to simply submit a commitment at the time.</p>
<p>Industries Conforming to New Instruments in Succession: At present, there are quite a few new instruments circulating in the market. According to reports from weights and measures manufacturing factories, in addition to the nearly 10,000 new scales purchased by vegetable stalls in the north and south markets, the number of new instruments purchased by various trade associations exceeding 200 is as follows: 1,200 items for the sauce industry, 700 items for the soy sauce and wine industry, 1,300 items for the dried goods industry, 390 items for the fruit industry, 350 items for the medicinal materials industry, 390 items for the cooked food industry, 261 items for the tea industry, 340 items for the candle industry, 206 items for the sugar industry, 200 items for the electrical machinery and silk weaving industry (above are weighing instruments), 500 items for the silk and satin industry, 500 items for the footwear industry, 1,000 items for the cotton cloth industry, 400 items for the embroidery industry, and 1,000 items for the ready-made clothing industry (above are measuring instruments). The scattered quantities purchased by other individuals or groups and those purchased directly from other shops and factories are not included, and the total number is estimated to have reached more than 50,000 items.</p>
<p>Inspection of the Concessions will Begin Soon: Regarding the inspection matters within the Public Concession and the French Concession, the French Concession had already reached an agreement with the Public Works Department in early July through Director Wei Zhiren, and the joint inspection matters were generally handled in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the Ministry. The French Concession also requested and obtained approval from the French Minister to implement the regulations in September. As for the Public Concession, Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives from the Public Works Department for multiple discussions, and the Chairman of the Public Works Department, Mr. Macnaghten, met with Mayor Zhang to express his agreement to assist. Finally, Director Pan, based on the results of this meeting, and Chief Administrator Fei Xindun and Chief Patrol Mao Ding of the Public Works Department negotiated and finalized the assistance measures for the concession on July 7th. The main points are that the inspection matters within the Public Concession should be handled by inspectors sent by the Testing Institute with the assistance of the police, in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the Ministry. Penalties for violations of the law will also be jointly enforced by the Testing Institute and the assisting agency in accordance with the Weights and Measures Law. All procedures for transfer to the court will be handled in accordance with the usual procedures of the concession. However, in order to facilitate communication with the police, the Testing Institute should designate five or six inspectors, who must first meet with the police before starting their work. According to Chief Administrator Fei, the above measures will be implemented after being approved by the board of directors of the Public Works Department. However, due to the summer vacation, the board meetings were suspended, which delayed the process. It is expected that the measures will be approved and implemented after being submitted to the board in early September. Currently, factories in the city are preparing reserves of new instruments to meet the needs within the concessions.</p>
<p>Customs Must Also Implement the New System: This reform to the new system is a national policy and should be uniformly observed. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously received a report from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which in turn received a report from the Preserved Meat Industry Association, stating that the Shanghai Customs had not yet adopted the new system. The Bureau reported this to the Ministry of Industry, which then forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Customs to implement the reform so as not to hinder the implementation of the new system in Shanghai. Subsequently, a report in the Mainland News stated that, according to the Jianghai Customs authorities, although there had been rumors about the reform to the new system, it had not been officially reported in newspapers and had not been officially informed of the matter. This was quite surprising. The Weights and Measures Law was promulgated by the National Government, and as a government agency, how could it not be aware of it? This news was likely based on inaccurate reporting or on personal opinions of those who were not yet informed of the matter. Although it was a private conversation, its publication in the newspaper was sufficient to confuse the public. The Social Affairs Bureau then submitted a clipping of this news to the Ministry for instructions. Fortunately, the Ministry of Industry has instructed that it has forwarded the situation to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Jianghai Customs to adopt the new system by a deadline, so the implementation of the reform is expected to be near.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Anti-Opium Society Convenes a National Congress <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Circular Has Been Issued</p>
<p>The National Congress of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, held every two years, is scheduled to take place from November 1st to 5th this year at West Lake in Hangzhou. The Society, recognizing the urgency of the date, should promptly inform local anti-opium organizations to prepare early and to formulate and nominate representatives and other procedures in order to comply. This circular was issued yesterday, and the original text of the notice is copied below. This Society convenes a general meeting every two years in accordance with its charter. This year marks the scheduled meeting, and it also coincides with the loosening of opium prohibition in the country, with divergent prohibition orders. Currently, public opium sales have been canceled due to enthusiastic opposition from comrades in various regions, but those advocating public sales are still operating in the dark, devising various plans and conspiracies to resurface. All anti-opium comrades should expand their campaigns and strengthen their organizations to prevent a relapse and to avoid the failure of years of anti-opium efforts in one fell swoop. Therefore, convening a national congress to bring together comrades from various provinces to encourage each other and to determine the grand plan of action is truly an urgent task for saving the times. Therefore, the Standing Committee of this Society resolved at its August meeting to convene the congress at West Lake in Hangzhou from November 1st to 5th. In view of the vastness of the national scope and the dispersed locations of the groups, it is necessary to appoint specialists to prepare in different regions in order to achieve twice the results with half the effort. The plan is organized as follows: (1) Meeting location: Xihu Grand Hall and Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters Grand Hall, West Lake, Hangzhou; (2) Meeting dates: November 1st to 5th; (3) Representative qualifications: Local National Anti-Opium Societies, Anti-Opium Propaganda Societies, and anti-opium organizations with similar characteristics to this Society, as well as individual members of this Society's joint organizations, may send representatives to attend. In areas where anti-opium organizations have not been established, representatives may be nominated by the Party Headquarters and civil organizations to attend as observers. In addition, Christian churches, Catholic churches, Buddhist associations, Muslim associations, and Confucian associations may also send representatives to participate. The selection methods and the number of representatives will be determined in detail separately; (4) Representative fees: Except for individual member representatives who will be provided by this Society when necessary, the travel expenses of representatives from various organizations will be borne by the respective organizations. However, this Society will, to the extent possible, write to the authorities to request a reduction in the train fares and other expenses for the representatives. Accommodation and meals in Shanghai and Hangzhou will be borne by this Society; (5) Regional preparation: For the convenience of communication, the country is divided into North China, Northeast China, South China, Southwest China, West China, East China, and Southeast Asia preparation offices. The North China Preparation Office is located at the Tianjin Hebei National Anti-Opium Society and includes the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Chahar, Shaanxi, and Gansu. The Northeast China Preparation Office is located at the Shenyang Liaoning National Anti-Opium Society and includes the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. The South China Preparation Office is located at the Fuzhou Fujian National Anti-Opium Society and includes Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan. The West China Preparation Office is located at the Chengdu Sichuan National Anti-Opium Society and includes Sichuan and Guizhou. The Southwest China Preparation Office is located at the Kunming Yunnan National Anti-Opium Society and includes Yunnan, Guangxi, and French Annam. The Southeast Asia Preparation Office is located at the Singapore National Anti-Opium Society and includes the British Straits Settlements, the Malay Peninsula, and the Dutch East Indies. The East China Preparation Office is located at the Hangzhou Zhejiang National Anti-Opium Society and includes Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. The National Preparation Office is located at the Shanghai Chinese National Anti-Opium Society; (6) Representative nomination: Local anti-opium organizations should convene meetings as soon as possible after receiving this notice, nominate representatives in accordance with the law, and register with their respective regional preparation offices to obtain qualification certificates and discounted train and boat tickets to prepare for departure; (7) Representative proposals: Local anti-opium organizations should prepare their proposals in advance and send them to this Society in Shanghai before October 15th for inclusion in the agenda, mimeographing, and distribution for discussion at the congress; (8) Congress promotion: This congress is of great importance to the future of the anti-opium movement of the masses. Local anti-opium organizations should make full preparations and carry out necessary promotion during the Anti-Opium Week in October, soliciting opinions from all sectors and submitting concrete articles to the congress; (9) Congress expenses: The expenses for convening this congress are enormous.

<h3 id="e152">Annual Meeting of the National Medicine Trade Association <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The National Medicine Trade Association held its annual meeting for the 20th year yesterday. More than 230 members attended. Zhang Meian, Zhuang Meitang, and Cen Zhiliang were elected as the presidium. After the formalities, the secretariat and finance department reported on the work of the association over the past year, as well as a summary of income and expenditure. Subsequently, the agenda was discussed, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the new metric system, the industry believes it cannot be implemented due to its special circumstances and requests government assistance. It was resolved that the dosage of medicine is extremely important for the treatment of patients. If the new system is improperly implemented, it will inevitably affect the lives of patients. The government should be requested to exempt it from change according to the common practice of special medicinal dosages in various countries around the world in order to emphasize hygiene. (2) Regarding the new regulations of the French Concession Public Works Bureau on licensing pharmacies and the method of collecting business tax within the concession, and how the association should express its attitude, it was resolved that these regulations infringe upon the national sovereignty of hygiene administration, and the additional business tax is particularly damaging to the national tax law. The association should resolutely oppose it and proceed in unison with the New Medicine Industry Association. (3) Regarding the Ministry of Industry's division of the pharmaceutical industry's internal shop assistants to organize a labor union, and the external shop assistants to join the association, and what the association's opinion on this method is, it was resolved that pharmaceutical shop assistants have absolutely no need to organize a labor union in accordance with the law and reason, and the association should continue to strive against it. (4) Regarding the frequent incidents of members of the Fresh Medicine Industry Association arbitrarily raising prices and suspending the delivery of fresh goods, and how the association should handle it, it was resolved that the association should periodically invite the persons in charge of the Fresh Medicine Industry Association to the meeting to properly conclude a contract to facilitate compliance and prevent abuses. (5) Regarding the association's entrusted revision of labor and capital treatment conditions, which has been pending for many years and has not yet been resolved, and how to proceed, after this case was raised, the atmosphere in the entire venue suddenly became tense, with more than 20 speakers expressing their deep sorrow. Later, the chairman adopted the opinions of the public and resolved to urge the party and government organs to promptly comply with the order for resolution. (6) Regarding how to raise and pay the annual operating expenses of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it was resolved to add one month's monthly donation to facilitate payment. (7) Regarding the chaotic selling prices among the industry, a price evaluation committee should be quickly formed to properly discuss methods to suppress the selling prices and benefit the sick. It was resolved that the general assembly publicly elect Cen Qisheng, Zhuang Meitang, Zhou Gansheng, Feng Jinpu, Zheng Baosheng, Chen Quanheng, Zhang Hongzhao, Shao Shilu, Cen Binghuang, Ge Kejian, Ding Defu, Sun Wenan, Yu Dongsheng, Xu Jiusong, and Liu Peiqing, 15 people to form a price evaluation committee, and Cen Qisheng will convene a meeting. (8) Regarding the proposed formulation of industry regulations, it was resolved that the former industry regulations committee should be reconvened by the association to formulate them. (9) Regarding the issue of members who do not pay donations according to the number of employees and those who fail to pay overdue fees, it was resolved that those who are in arrears should pay within a limited time. Those who do not pay donations according to the number of employees will be investigated by personnel and supplemented in full. (10) Regarding the practice of some colleagues receiving prescriptions and delivering medicine, which, although said to be convenient for patients, actually damages the business of smaller colleagues, and a request for a relief method, it was resolved that the freedom of business should not be discussed for the time being. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>According to official sources, the industrial authorities have received a report from the Consulate General in New York stating that the asbestos produced in the United States has very short fibers, which are not as suitable as Chinese asbestos with longer fibers. Overseas Chinese businessmen have investigated and found that Chinese asbestos can still be sold well in the United States. Please inform domestic merchants that if they have asbestos with long fibers for sale, they can directly send prices and samples to the Consulate (Consulate General in New York) so that they can be introduced. It is heard that the industrial authorities have already ordered the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau to send letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to inform domestic merchants to directly contact and negotiate.</p>

<p>Wu Jingqing, the chief of the First District of Minhang County, passed by the door of Yichang Grocery Store on the main street of the town at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday. He considered that two buckets of tung oil parked next to the street were obstructing pedestrians. Without asking the reason, he immediately grabbed the store staff and beat them severely. He then summoned the police to the Public Security Bureau for detention, which aroused public outrage among the merchants and residents of the entire town. The Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting and resolved to petition the county government to dismiss him from his post and investigate him. Seeing that the situation was not good, the district chief held a banquet in the evening for influential figures in the town to mediate, but the Chamber of Commerce believed that as an administrative staff member, he dared to be so reckless and illegal, so they unanimously insisted on dealing with him until the goal of dismissal and investigation was achieved.</p>

<p>At about 4:40 p.m. yesterday, a fire broke out unexpectedly in a thatched shed inhabited by people from Jiangbei at No. 394 Shihuyao, Xiaoshadu, Huxi. Suddenly, thick smoke filled the air and penetrated the roof. Because the thatched sheds were connected, they were easily burned. The fire quickly spread to the surrounding dwellings. The fire was extremely fierce. The area was remote and narrow, making it difficult to rescue. Fortunately, the police on duty directed the crowd to immediately demolish the sheds to isolate them, and the fire gradually went out. A total of ten thatched sheds were destroyed. When the fire was raging, the cries of the poor people, both big and small, were deafening. The fire owner, He Jitao, jumped into the dense smoke and dragged out a small child. The child's feet were slightly burned. Seeing that he had caused the disaster, he fled with his wife and child. When the police station in charge of the Sixth District sent police to investigate, they could not find the fire owner. It was then said that the fire started between Nos. 393 and 4, so Zhu Xiucheng, a native of Funing at No. 393, was detained and escorted to the Sixth District Police Station for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Story of Beards</p>
<p>In ancient Eastern nations, there was a deep-rooted superstition that a man's beard was a symbol of honor, and to punish someone, they would forcibly shave off their beard and cut their hair short. However, looking at ancient Assyrian sculptures, the images of the emperors all have long beards flowing down their chests. Their hair is also always long, while the slaves serving them have no beards at all, their faces are clean-shaven, and their hair is cut extremely short. The difference between the noble and the lowly is, of course, immediately apparent.</p>
<p>The Egyptians, however, had different opinions from the Assyrians. They believed that beards and hair were filthy things and that the head and face must be completely shaved. Their slaves and servants were also forced to do the same and were not allowed to grow them long.</p>
<p>Ancient Greeks and Romans often suffered greatly when fighting with enemies because their beards were grabbed. Therefore, they all shaved off their beards. It is said that King Alexander the Great strictly ordered his soldiers to shave their beards for this reason.</p>
<p>In ancient Roman customs, men at the age of twenty-one had to shave off their beards and offer them to the statues of the gods in their homes. Growing a beard after this age was only done when a family member died.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Funny Stories at the Road Exhibition <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association has been established for ten years. The Road City Exhibition will be held for three weeks starting on September 12 this year. The other day, Chairman Wang Zhengting specially invited Chinese and Western people to discuss the methods of implementation. Many funny stories were told at the meeting. I will record one or two of them below.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting's Eyes Don't Close Wang Zhengting said that roads are to the country as blood vessels are to the human body. If the blood vessels don't circulate, the person will surely die. If the roads are not developed, the country will be difficult to strengthen. When I was in Peiping (Beijing) before, I met a Western friend who mentioned the inconvenience of transportation in our country. He had a few words that I will never forget. He said, for example, if someone in Tibet sent me two bags of flour and wanted me to take them back to Peiping, I would rather telegraph from Peiping to Washington, D.C. to order two bags of flour. Because transportation from Tibet to Peiping is inconvenient, these two bags of flour must be carried by camels and transported by small carts along the way. Although the goods are given as a gift, the transportation costs are actually more valuable than the flour purchased in the United States. Although it is a joke, it is indeed the truth. Therefore, when I initiated the National Road Construction Association, I had a wish to assist the government and local areas in building roads in all provinces across the country, and then ride in a car and travel around all provinces of China for a week. If I can achieve this goal, I will have no regrets even in death. Since the promotion of this association, about 110,000 li of roads have been completed. However, our country is vast, and it is still a long way to go to travel around by car. If this goal is not achieved, my eyes will not close after death. I hope you all will vigorously promote the road construction movement, etc. The listeners were amused.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Fears Heatstroke Wu Shan, the executive director of the association, reported in public that a total of 100,000 entrance tickets were printed for the Road City Exhibition this time. Each ticket sells for one yuan to subsidize the expenses of the meeting. The tickets are sold by Chinese and Western people, each selling 50,000. Lin Kanghou is responsible for the Chinese side, for which we are very grateful. Wang Zhengting was very impressed by Lin's enthusiasm and insisted that he stand up and give advice. Lin said that the weather is hot today, and you are putting a high hat on my head, so I can't handle it and I'm afraid I'll get heatstroke. The reason why I joined this association and took on the position of director of the general affairs group is that things in our country have not been on the right track recently. If we want to get on the right track, we must first build roads. Therefore, I have contributed some opinions on the ticket sales. It is not that I am solely responsible for all 50,000 tickets. I still need to ask people from all walks of life to sell them on my behalf. I recently learned that Minister Wang and Zilian have each recognized 10,000 tickets, so my responsibility has been reduced by two-fifths. For the rest, please have the chairman come forward to invite people from all walks of life to the meeting to encourage them to purchase. I believe it will be easy to find a way.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang Doesn't Forget His Roots The association invited Zhang Zhijiang to succeed Jiang Baiqi as vice chairman after Jiang Baiqi passed away. Zhang said that road construction has a great relationship with local security. For example, if bandits come to attack, it is easy to eliminate them if troops can be mobilized within one or two hours from a distance of hundreds of li. If roads are not built and transportation is inconvenient, if troops from a distance of hundreds of li must be gathered within one or two days, the bandits will unexpectedly loot and escape long ago, and there will be no way to pursue them. The area will be devastated. Everyone said that Zhang is currently the Superintendent of Jiangnan Pacification, and is handling bandit suppression affairs in Jiangbei. He doesn't leave his profession in three sentences, which shows his concern for his own duties.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Consoling Successful Judges <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>I remember a Ming Dynasty poem about the Hundred Horses Picture: "Ninety-nine of them are all sweating blood, the first one is the Longmei." This is a famous line. Ninety-nine people below Zhu Leizhang have been selected in this high-level examination. I secretly thought that Mr. Liu, who was wrongly divided, must be added to make up a hundred horses. Although I don't know who the Longmei belongs to, ninety-nine of them are strong horses. Therefore, the government's treatment is extremely generous. On the day of awarding the certificates, all the officials accompanied him. The ceremony was solemn and the instructions were added. The general gift is a silver commemorative badge, and the special award is a complete collection of the Prime Minister's books and a compilation of Building the Nation Monthly. President Shao Yuanchong and Ms. Zhang Mojun gave a mirror and inscribed a fan. These are unusual numbers. As for the ceremony of visiting the mausoleum, it is the same as releasing vegetables. The banquet at the shoes forest is no different from the Qionglin. It is also said that a memorial tablet is planned to be erected in front of the mausoleum, which is the legacy of the Tang Yan Pagoda and the Ming Taixue Jinshi inscriptions. The students also set up a reunion of the same year. It is said that a new item can be added to the party friendship, and the old friendship will not be abolished. In short, the country glorifies the success of the examination. Lucky are the ninety-nine people. However, there are still 150 people crying in the corner. Who are the 150 people? They are the judges who passed the first examination of the trial court last year. In this campaign, the recruitment began with the Judicial Yuan and ended with the Examination Yuan. The Legislative Yuan has a special case. Although the period is divided into two years, the examination is actually the same. Therefore, this year's five examinations are uniquely lacking in the judicial one because of this. The Examination Yuan awarded certificates to 150 people and consulted the Judicial Yuan to order the Ministry of Justice to establish a special office for training, retraining, internships, and more internships. It is limited to one and a half years as a reserve for promotion and inspection. In terms of results, it is almost better than the ninety-nine new entrants. However, the glory is not shared by them. How can we satisfy the youthful competitive spirit and show the country's importance to judicial candidates? The members of the office met me and seemed to be indignant. I first corrected them and said, "Scholars value practical learning and do not value empty words. Huan Rong of the Han Dynasty extravagantly displayed his carriages and clothes to show off his glory in studying the past. Wang Panshan read the Tongjianlun and despised him. This is why Han Weigong of the Song Dynasty refused to wear flowers after passing the examination and eventually became a famous Confucian and minister." I comforted them again and said, "Selecting talents and honors is to value the legacy of education and encourage morale. New visions and directions will be shown in the future. At the beginning of the founding of the country, the scale was new, and there was no time to spare. There may be omissions. There must be ways to pick up the omissions. How can there be six selections, five of which are grand and one of which is neglected? Do not be impatient, you two or three children."</p>
<h3 id="e174">Anecdotes from the Calamity <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Jinshi</p>
<p>I, the unworthy one, have traveled between Shanghai and Hangzhou. Incessantly, I have experienced the changing seasons five times. This time, upon my mother's command, I took leave to return to my hometown. The communist scourge is rampant, and nine out of ten homes are empty. The once-renowned Zhejiang as a land of happiness, where can it be found now? What I have heard and seen, I will record a bit of it.</p>
<p>My county (Ruian) is thirty miles south across the Feiyun River, known as Pingyang. River steamers travel back and forth in half a day. Pingyang is indeed a land of scenic mountains and clear waters, with pure customs and abundant products, surpassing all in the Southeast. Last year, in May, the area was originally garrisoned by a company of provincial defense troops stationed in the City God Temple north of the city. The statues of the impermanent officials there were terrifying and hideous. The people of the county believed them to be extremely efficacious, offering incense and prayers abundantly. Since the troops were stationed there, the people of the county had not been allowed to enter the temple for several months. On the 26th of that month, before noon, the provincial defense troops received orders to move out. Many soldiers carried guns, ready to depart. Just then, the gun of a certain platoon leader of the troop was suddenly missing. They searched everywhere. After about two hours, it was finally found under the seat of the Impermanence God. By then, it was noon. They then started cooking in the temple. While they were having lunch, a report suddenly came that bandits were arriving. At that time, the guide for the bandits intended to lead them to disarm the troops here. Unexpectedly, they lost their way. The government troops then took the opportunity to climb the city walls together and shoot. Every shot hit its mark, with no wasted bullets. Hundreds of communist bandits were spared. During the battle between the troops and the bandits, the government troops, fearing they were outnumbered, sent a messenger to request reinforcements from my county. The messenger returned in just one hour. Even more strange, it rained heavily all night that day. The firewood, oil, and other flammable materials the bandits carried could not be ignited. Someone even poured oil on the firewood to set fire to a house, but the matches suddenly disappeared. When they came out of the house, they were still there. This happened again and again. The bandits were furious and just beat on the house. In this battle, hundreds of enemies were killed, while only one government soldier died. This can be considered fortunate.</p>
<p>The magistrate announced that Pingyang's transformation from danger to safety was due to several extraordinary occurrences. First, the army losing its gun and delaying the time, leading to the troops killing the enemy, was one extraordinary event. Second, the guide getting lost, preventing the disarmament, was the second extraordinary event. Next, the matches suddenly disappearing, preventing arson, was the third extraordinary event. Next, wiping out hundreds of enemies with only one soldier killed was the fourth extraordinary event. Because of these four extraordinary events, the people of Pingyang all said it was divine assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Further Record of Zhu Yongkui's Engraving Skills <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>I once wrote for this newspaper about Mr. Zhu Yongkui's superb engraving skills, and those who heard of it marveled at it. However, there were still some things that were not fully explained, so I will record them again as follows.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu can engrave three thousand characters on a piece of ivory the size of an inch. Therefore, it cannot be recognized by the naked eye. One must use a very precise microscope to find the vigorous, elegant, and neat characters. However, Mr. Zhu never uses the aid of a mirror when engraving. After more than ten years of research, he has entered a realm of mastery. What is even more amazing is that the knife Mr. Zhu uses to engrave characters is no different from the ones used for ordinary engraving. It is unknown how a large knife can engrave such tiny, ant-like characters.</p>
<p>I once saw him engrave an ivory ring for a certain gentleman. The ring face was engraved with "Oath of Love," about hundreds of words. It was intended to be a gift to his beloved, to be remembered forever. Other items, such as fan bones, cigarette holders, and ivory chopsticks, can also be engraved with characters on them, which is also very interesting.</p>
<p>In addition to being good at engraving ivory, Mr. Zhu is also good at engraving bamboo. His skills are also exquisite. I heard that he will use his engraving skills for fellow enthusiasts in his spare time from academic affairs. His friends have already set the price, two jiao per word. Those who love his art can go directly to the National Academy of Music to discuss with him in person.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Travel Notes of India (88) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the eleventh, I was invited by the University of India to participate in the ceremony of building the VIWANATB Temple. Visuna means the master of the world. Almost all Indian names contain the idea of conquering the world. This is one of them. As for what god it is and what era it is from, it is not known. There was wind that day, and a lot of dust. A large cloth shed was set up on the open space of the university. More than 10,000 people arrived, including many women. Outside the venue was a wheat field, where wheat was being harvested. There were trees next to it, and many people climbed the trees to admire the scene of the meeting. I arrived late, and only saw that the chairman was a naked, bare-skinned man. This is truly a naked man here. It is different from what I have seen in various meetings. The naked men at various meetings still have an inch or so of cloth around them. This naked man showed the true body given by his parents, including his reproductive organs. He sat in the right position as chairman, wearing various flower garlands, and his hair was rolled into a bun like a Chinese Taoist. However, he is truly virtuous. Chinese Taoists are all fake people. This is a real person. His name is KRISH丨NASHRM. He is about forty years old, with a black beard of several inches, bright eyes, a fat body, and thick, black skin, probably because he has been assimilated with nature for a long time. Among the ten thousand people, his reproductive organs were also exposed. I saw it very clearly. This is probably the number one immortal in the world. Why does he need to be the number one immortal? The number one mountain in the world is the Himalayas. He went to this mountain for fourteen years. He never speaks. This time, he was specially invited by the University of India to preside over the opening ceremony of the temple. Therefore, he descended to this meeting. Soon, he will return to the cave of the number one mountain. The naked immortal sometimes got up and operated an iron chain. Everyone got up to watch. The master of ceremonies forbade them to stand up, but I don't know why. The person standing next to him was the speaker, named MAVIA. MOHANMALVIYA spoke using a radio. The entire audience could hear him. Unfortunately, I don't understand Indian. He said that this meeting was intended to seek peace for men and women all over the world. I went to this meeting too late. I only saw the naked real person, which can be called a wonder of the world. But I am not only curious, but I also know the strange. Buddhist and Taoist books all say that cultivators who become immortals cultivate into a concealed yin-horse phase. What is the concealed yin-horse phase? It means that a man's yang tool shrinks internally due to cultivation and is not exposed externally. The Infinite Meaning Sutra describes one of the Buddha's thirty-two phases as the concealed yin-horse phase, which means that the yang tool is not exposed externally. The first book says that women who cultivate cut off menstruation, which is called cutting off the red dragon. Now this number one immortal's yang tool is exposed externally. I don't know if his Tao has not yet been achieved, or if the cultivation methods are different. However, the Buddha used to sit quietly on Snow Mountain for six years and did not attain enlightenment. The Buddha himself said that he finally attained it through enlightenment. Cultivation is done on Snow Mountain, and enlightenment is attained on the plains of Gaya. Also, when the Buddha cultivated for six years, the old seniors at the time did not believe it, saying that he was a prince, unable to endure hardship, and too pampered. We have been cultivating hard for eight years and have not yet attained enlightenment. Now this immortal has been cultivating for fourteen years. I don't know if he has attained enlightenment or not. He doesn't say, so I don't know. But in the past, when Bodhidharma came to the East, he faced the wall for ten years without speaking. Bodhidharma testified to this. This immortal can not speak, so he is probably a type of Bodhidharma.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Lakeside Pavilion Poetry Talk (Part 1) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>This time for the Lakeside Pavilion poetry lessons, unexpectedly many veterans of the poetry scene also came with great interest. How dare I presumptuously judge the merits of each entry. Moreover, there were more than six hundred volumes, with a dazzling array of impressive works. Unfortunately, I have no time to read them in detail. However, a cursory glance might disappoint people. Therefore, I first sent them to Cuiyin Pavilion to have them circle the acceptable lines. Then, I, the humble one, made a second selection and added circles. As a result, there is hardly anyone whose four poems are all excellent, with double circles for every line. Flaws and merits are interwoven, and even Li Bai and Du Fu could not avoid this. Since this is not a talent selection ceremony, why bother to interpret the order of names, which could provoke feelings of honor and disgrace. Therefore, I will extract lines for detailed commentary and choose the best to reveal as follows.</p>
<p>For the first line of the first poem, "After the vernal equinox, the days gradually lengthen" is the best. Because the winter solstice has the shortest days, and the summer solstice has the longest days, the vernal equinox is the midpoint from short to long, and the autumnal equinox is the midpoint from long to short. Therefore, this line with its three embedded characters actually contains scientific knowledge and is very reliable. Something like "After the new autumn, the days gradually cool" would be more general. The second-best is "The painting shoulder picks up the wave light in the low place." because the words "picks up" and "low" are quite evocative and create a coherent whole. Something like "connects with mountain light" or "presses against mountain light" - the word "presses" may be slightly better than "connects", but is not as fluid as "picks up". The third line, "The curtain waves seem to move as the breeze rises" is the best, using the word "seem" to echo the word "breeze", making every word feel outstanding. It is truly worthy of praise. The fourth line is "Lotus leaves fill the pond, the shadows of people are fragrant" is the best. However, these four lines were not all written by the same person. Therefore, the word "wave" is repeated. However, changing "wave light" to "lake light" or "fill the pond" to "fill the pool" would also diminish the beauty somewhat. The "wave" in "curtain wave" is related to the words "move" and "breeze" and "rises" and must not be changed. Now, this is poetry talk, not a poetry selection. Using analytical methods to consider the words and phrases is like cutting jade, discarding the flaws and taking the merits. It is not necessary to be like gathering armpits to make a fur coat, seeking a flaw in the hair.</p>
<p>For the first and second lines of the second poem, "The sound of insects comes through the window screen at night, the Milky Way is silent, and the moon is half-slanted" is more stable. Because the silence of the Milky Way sets off the sound of insects, and the half-slanting moon sets off the word "through". And taking "Deeper the night, the moonlight, half the people's homes" as a blueprint, you can feel the connection up and down, and it is a circle worth reciting. Other works are mostly superficial and inevitably have differences in skill. The third and fourth lines connect with "Who is rowing a small boat to seek the old agreement? Ask the Su family by the West Lake Bridge", which is the most appropriate. Because "rowing a small boat to seek the old agreement" is a complete song title, and Su Xiao of West Lake is already a dead person. Who still cares? It seems to be the sound of insects at night saying what the author hears. These fantasies are most appreciated by the poetry scene. This whole poem can be said to be seamless.</p>
<p>For the second and second lines of the third poem, "Peach blossoms bloom in the clear weather after the rain, listen to the oriole in the green willow shade" should be chosen. Using "peach blossom" to echo the words "bloom" and "tender", and using "green willow" to echo the word "shade" is extremely clever. Something like "crying oriole" would inevitably be dull, or "weeping willow" would not have the echoes of the words "green" and "shade". The third and fourth lines should take "A road for pedestrians around the lake, even Ni Zan and Huang Gongwang could not paint it." The last sentence is redundant. There are many who change one or two words. The upper sentence is not to create a gazetteer for the new West Lake, because all the lakeside areas and the water's edge have pedestrian paths. People walking on them, with reflections in the water, truly cannot be described by painting. The pedestrian path is a term in the architectural world. Being able to use colloquial language in poetry is not annoying and is truly the essence of the bamboo branch. The last sentence uses a reverse writing method, which is more similar to the upright behavior of Ni Zan and Huang Gongwang in painting.</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Situation of Gold Standard Finance Hesitates <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of gold bidding on the 22nd was peaceful, seeming to rise slightly, but the advances and retreats were complicated, hovering around 780 taels. The difference between the high and low was 7 taels in half a day, and finally it rose slightly by 6 qian. It was firm from the early opening, probably because the silver market rose slightly, but there was a rumor that the United States had sold silver, and the price of American silver fell by more than 3 yuan, which led to people's hearts moving higher. However, the buying and selling paths of each firm were different, so the price sometimes rose and sometimes fell. It was rumored that a certain bank continued to purchase, and that a large batch of spot goods would be shipped for export that day. The market situation was not without excitement. The foreign exchange rate has been raised by half a grade, but the internal rate is flat. When the gold price was within 80 taels at noon, the market was closed due to Saturday. Remembering that the situation in the middle of this week was very outstanding at first, once jumped to a new high price of 795 and a half taels, and then fell by more than 10 taels. By the end of the week, it finally retreated to 776 taels. As a result, it fell by more than 8 taels compared to the previous weekend. It was a reversal of the two consecutive weeks of rising.</p>
<p>The change was peaceful. The opening price for October yesterday morning was 780 taels and 0.05 qian, and then it increased by 1.6 qian. The big bars and American silver both rose by one-eighth. The private telegram was only sixteen one, and the market situation was soft. Therefore, Zhifeng, Yongda, Lianbang, Shunmao, Hengyu and others all entered at a high opening. It was also heard that a certain bank also purchased hundreds of bars, so the price rose from 79 taels and 5 qian to 83 taels in an instant. Hongli, Fuxing, Xiexing, Yongrichang, Yuanxingyong, Senchangyong and others all disposed of their shares. The British gold could be quoted at 6875, but people's hearts went down and fell by 4 points. When the British gold was announced, it was at the border of 80 taels, and the listing was lengthened by 125. The American gold fell by 1.25 fen on the 25th, and then fell slightly to 78 taels and 8 qian. Helplessly, the selling wind was strong, and Hongli, Fuyu, Dade, Chenchun, Yuanyong and others agreed to sell, and immediately depreciated by more than 3 taels, and finally became 76 taels, so British gold 75 was difficult to sell. Later, Fuyu, Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Daxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Shunli and others reversed the situation and pulled in, and Mitsui absorbed October British gold 75, and banks mutually traded September American gold 29.75 yuan, causing the gold price to gradually rise to a peak of more than 5 taels, to 81 and a half at 10:45. In an instant, it turned downward again, because Shunli, Wanxing, Hengxing, Fuxingyong and others sold out, and it fell by more than 3 taels, to 77 taels and 8 qian at 11:30. At this time, the Indian exchange telegram arrived and had shrunk by 3 anna, and the price was pushed up by more than 2 taels, to 80 taels and 0.02 qian. However, Tongtaichang, Fuxingyong, Yuandayong, Yongfengcheng and others tended to sell at this price, so the price could not stand and fell by more than 2 taels again. At 11:45, it was 77 taels and 8 qian, and suddenly pulled up by more than 2 taels again, to 80 taels and 0.02 qian. In short, the floating and unstable market has become a revolving situation. When the market closed at noon, it was 79 and a half taels, only 6 qian more than the previous day, and then it was done to 9 taels. The transaction was sporadic. According to the maximum of 83 taels and the minimum of 76 taels in half a day (but both were smaller than the intraday average on the previous day).</p>
<p>There are very few who sell spot goods. The opening price was 80 taels, and the closing price was 79 and a half taels. The revealed price was changed to 811 taels and 8 qian, which is a squeeze of 32 taels and 3 qian to 30 taels and 3 qian, and then a count of 33 taels. The registered price was 77 taels and 8 qian, and the replenishment water was 77 taels. The spot red bar was calculated to add 9 taels, and more than 100 taels were collected by Yingfeng Fenghheng. However, there were very few sellers, because a certain bank had shipped out 1500 bars, and the stock was already scarce.</p>
<p>There are many transactions and dances, and the trading on each counter, Yuanmaoyong, Daxingyong, Shunmao, Yuda, and Fuyu all entered Shunli, Cuichangyong, Yifengyong, Futaiheng, Hengxing, and Fuxingyong all left. Yuanxingyong, Xiexingyong, and Richang and others first left and then paid. Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuantai, Qianchangxiang, and Tianxiang and others had a lot of ins and outs. Hengyu and Yuanfengyong advanced first and then left. Speculator Mr. Wu slightly advanced, the Guangdong help sold 500 to 600 bars, and the Dalian help sold about 1300 to 1400 bars, with the ins and outs balancing.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Telegraph of the Big Bar Remained Still Yesterday <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>

<h3 id="e180">Foreign Exchange Is Clearly Loose and Darkly Flat <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian silver markets all rose, and the exchange rate also rose. However, the European market seemed to trend towards softness. When HSBC's listing was lengthened by half a grade, the British gold was 125, and the current rate was 1 shilling and 2 and a half pence. The American gold was 25, and the rate was 29 yuan and 375. The Japanese gold was reduced by 1.25 taels, and the rate was 168 and a half taels. All other rates were also lengthened. However, Hong Kong only decreased by 0.0625, and the rate was 80 yuan and 05625, which was rare. Probably the internal British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were first flat and then stable, and then showed a loose trend. As a result, they were flat. Compared with the previous day, only the Japanese exchange rate decreased by 0.25, while the British and American exchange rates were the same as before, which was a clear loosening and dark flattening trend. Most Chinese businessmen sold more than 100,000 pounds of British gold, and the difference was only about 10 taels. However, the banks' appetites were still not silent. The American gold was traded back and forth for 100,000 to 200,000 yuan in each bank, and the Japanese gold was settled for 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday and there was no market.</p>

HSBC absorbed September 75, Sumitomo entered 75, and Mitsui Zhenggin bought 10 and 11 months 75 to 8125, so the gold price fell to 77 taels. Later, Mitsui absorbed 75 and suddenly saw it harden, and then entered 75 to 8125. Dongya Sumitomo traded for December 75, and Shanghai entered October 75. The closing price at noon was 6871 to 75, and the buying price was 75 to 8125.</p>

<p>(21st) London Telegraph, the large silver bars have all increased again, with the near and far periods both increasing by 1.25, the same as 12 pence and 8125. The Indian foot slightly filled the gap, the transaction was sparse, and the market situation was calm before the market closed. After the market closed, the market was even more stable, and the buyers were satisfied.

As for the market price, except for silver turning tight and silver dismantling changing to expensive, most of the other market conditions were weak. Banks received except for the usual exceptions, other remittance money of the day, and various rates were too hasty and the signing was changed to be sorted out next Monday.</p>

<p>Other Increases and Decreases Offset Each Other, with Very Little Variation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the securities market in this port, the situation of each bond market, and the futures market were still calm, and both buyers and sellers were as idle as before, and no turning point was seen. Also, the spot transactions were also very sparse. Checking the changes in the market price of each bond, the market environment of the bond market was calm, and the delivery period was gradually approaching, the large households were bearish and waiting, the market conditions were quiet, the transactions were sparse, and there were many arbitrage transactions. The supply and demand situation was balanced, and the bond price trend was sluggish. When the market opened in the early morning, the demand was still good, and it continued to increase compared to the previous day. The buying gradually became quiet, and the market was slightly retracted. As a result, compared to the previous day, the unified tax fell by 56 jiao, and the 19 bond and 20 customs rolls also fell by about 3 jiao.

<h3 id="e184">The Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Markets Are Fluctuating <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The trend of the yarn market is chaotic and inconsistent, and the market conditions are still brewing. It rises and falls suddenly, making it difficult to grasp. The distant months are hovering between 52 and 3 taels. In short, the world's cotton industry is deteriorating, so the big households unanimously sell. A certain giant merchant still enters the near and leaves the far. However, the raw materials for coarse yarn are cheaper, and the profit from spinning coarse yarn is still not bad, so there is no lack of short sellers. However, a certain manufacturer is tightening and still does not relax. However, the actual sales have been good recently, so the market conditions are tight one step. However, the environment is more severe. In the afternoon, the price of third-grade yarn rose by 34 yuan, and it is expected that American cotton has the power to rise, and the market plate is rising.</p>
<p>The afternoon market rose slightly, and the market opened in the previous market. As the price of American cotton rose slightly, the situation was relatively false, and each month fell by 1, 3, and 4 qian. The market opened in the afternoon, which was very weak. In the two or three plates, the price of the second-grade yarn rose by 3 or 4 yuan, and each month rose by 4, 5, and 7 qian. The transaction totaled 36,200 bales, and Gongtai sold 2,550 bales, Taixing 2,300 bales, Xincheng 2,350 bales, and Yiyu 1,600 bales. Meiji bought 3,750 bales, Rongxing 1,800 bales, Houfengchang 1,300 bales, Dafeng 800 bales, and Gu Da 700 bales. The closing prices of the market are listed on the left. The closing prices of the market rose and fell, and the number of deposits on the account. The closing prices of the market rose and fell, and the number of deposits on the account in August were 157.5. The increase of 428850 in November was 152. The increase of 4107200 in September was 155.4.171450 in December, it was 152.8 and 1101900 in October, it was 152.5 and 194500 in January, it was 155.1468800</p>
<p>The Spot Yarn Sales Are Active and the Price Is Flat The sales of spot yarn are more active. It is found that all the gangs bought a total of 2,185 bales throughout the day, and 200 bales of futures were entered among the peers. The market was flat, and the customers from Sichuan entered 1,500 bales, the mainland entered 160 bales, Shantou entered 125 bales, Guangdong entered 190 bales, Zhenjiang entered 30 bales, Tianjin entered 115 bales, and the North Gang entered 65 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Cotton Market: Morning Weakness, Afternoon Strength <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was quite weak in the morning due to the meager upward momentum of American cotton and the weakening exchange rate, which made foreign cotton cheaper to purchase. Furthermore, large traders were selling off unusually vigorously, with some buying foreign cotton to arbitrage against domestic spot cotton, leading to a sharper decline. Market sentiment was very poor. In the afternoon, Grade 3 cotton suddenly rose by one yuan, also because of news that the New York and Liverpool areas of the United States would reduce new cotton acreage next year. This greatly stimulated market sentiment, buyers became active, and the market rose by 30 copper cash. However, domestic and foreign factories are currently not buying cotton, and the future is still seen as mostly bearish. Nevertheless, local Shanghai cotton merchants are inclined to go long, due to the impact of water damage on this year's harvest.</p>
<p>Hankow Cotton: Near-term Decline, Long-term Rise. The Hankow cotton market opened weak in the morning, with American cotton showing a slight increase but with weak market sentiment and a lack of buyers. Prices for all months fell by 20-30 copper cash. In the afternoon, due to positive news, prices rose by 20-35 copper cash. Total transactions amounted to 97,900 bales. Sales included 3,500 bales from Rui Da, 2,800 bales from Tian Long, 2,400 bales from Yu Chang, 2,000 bales from Xin Cheng, 2,500 bales from Heng Da, and 500 bales from Da Ji. Purchases included 3,000 bales from Mei Ji, 4,700 bales from Yuan Da, 2,500 bales from Da Chang, and 2,900 bales from Shen Chang. The closing prices for Hankow cotton are recorded below:</p>

<p>Spot Cotton: High Prices, No Transactions. Inquiries for spot cotton have disappeared because prices are too high. There are attempts to buy foreign cotton instead, as American and Indian cotton are cheaper and foreign firms are fiercely competing to sell. Special concessions are reportedly being offered.</p>
<p>Shandong Cotton: Special Grade Lint: 33.75. Hengfeng Factory received 750 bales, spot delivery to the factory. Broach Cotton: 35.00. Shenxin Factory received 1,000 bales, spot delivery to the factory.</p>

<p>American cotton continued its upward trend. Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to weakness on Wall Street and mass selling. Futures rose by 1-5 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 5-6 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 20 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton but then weakened due to profit-taking. Finally, it firmed again due to good news from Liverpool. Bengalees rose by 2.5 rupees, Oomras rose by 2.75 rupees, and Broach rose by 4 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated 21st):</p>

<p>New Crop Growing Smoothly Compared to Previous Years</p>
<p>Long Traders Have No Way to Intervene</p>
<p>A telegram from New York dated the 21st reported on the cotton market during the week: The cotton market continued to decline last week because the growth of the new crop this month has been better than the previous average. Based on this yield, the market price is expected to see new lows. Currently, it is speculated that the increase in new crop movement and the increase in the government's next production estimate have caused long traders to liquidate. Even new buyers are reselling. Price declines have prompted some buying from industry insiders and short covering, but rallies are quickly halted. Market sentiment is completely bearish, with little hope for improvement. The strong bearish sentiment is quite rare, and long traders have practically no way to intervene. Weekend statistics are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the supply from various sources in the southern market was still thin, and river stocks were abundant. Due to the hot weather, retail sales in towns and villages were slow, and stores did not keep large inventories. The price of thick japonica rice suddenly decreased by 20-30 copper cash. The arrival of thin indica rice was somewhat sluggish. Local sales remained slow, and the local market remained sluggish, causing prices to fall again by a few copper cash. Although there wasn't a large amount of high-quality Xu Lu and Yang Jian rice, only the fresh varieties were selling. The market remained flat, and small sales of converted Yin Yuan were steady.</p>
<p>Goods from Zhabei Road were not moving well, and Jiangsu and Changzhou white japonica rice was quite sluggish, with prices falling by 200 copper cash. Early and late season rice was difficult to move, and prices had not returned to lower levels after several days of waiting. Buying interest was stronger than the previous day, and the situation seemed set. There was little demand for foreign Lu Jian rice, and sales of converted Yin Yuan were slow. Sales of Kunshan rice and Liyang-Yixing rice were extremely weak, with prices decreasing by 200-300 copper cash. Approximately 2,000 dan of river town rice arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Flour Market Turns Firm in the Afternoon <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months were flat and weak due to a slight increase in the quoted price of foreign wheat. This month briefly broke through the one copper cash mark, but Tianjin merchants became active and prices stabilized. By the afternoon, real demand buyers were actively purchasing due to the low market value, with Tianjin merchants being the most active. Outside speculation that the US wheat loan to China might be difficult to achieve due to the harsh conditions recorded in the telegrams of the day boosted market sentiment, and buying interest became active again. Observation of the situation suggests that prices may fluctuate for a few days. As a result, this month improved by one copper cash compared to the previous day, September/October improved by 0.05 copper cash, November/December improved by one copper cash, and January improved by 1.25 copper cash.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Wheat Milling Active, Wheat Futures Show Common Color <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a flat and stable trend for all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. For this month, as delivery is imminent, the short sellers' delivery reserves are reportedly around 200 truckloads. On the long side, large traders have already sold off, and most of the current positions are held by inland merchants. Their ability to take delivery seems limited. Mills have ample foreign wheat and will not take delivery, so market sentiment is quite flat. Distant months are slightly better due to the difficulty in securing the US wheat loan. As a result, this month was down 0.01 copper cash compared to the previous day, September/October were down 0.01 copper cash, November was down 0.02 copper cash, December was down 0.01 copper cash, and January was down 0.02 copper cash. Spot wheat milling was good, and the market also turned brisk. More than 5,000 bags were traded throughout the day. Six-Hop wheat was offered at 3.79 to 3.76 taels, Wuxi wheat at 3.77 taels, and Pudong Anting wheat at 3.7 taels. Zhitang Penglai wheat was offered at 3.75-3.76 taels, and Yangzhou Six-Hop, Jiangbei Zhenjiang, etc. wheat was offered at 3.74-3.75 taels.</p>

<p>Lanxi jujubes, which had previously fallen to just over 30 taels due to large arrivals, are now weakening due to sluggish sales. Yesterday, the bare selling price had reached 24 taels, more than 10 taels lower than the highest price. The market seems temporarily stable, but in the long term, if supplies continue to arrive in large quantities, prices could fall to 20 taels.</p>

<p>Overseas raw silk markets saw gradual increases in sales from raw silk factories. As Japanese silk prices were low, Shanghai Chinese silk firms found local prices to be too high and telegrams were sparse. Yesterday, only China Trading imported 10 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Jardine and others imported 40 bales of gray factory silk. Prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Wuyuan Green Tea: Large American Orders Continue <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wuyuan natural, pure grade green tea continued to be popular with American firms. Jardine, Jinlong, and other firms, as well as the China Tea Company, were all interested, and transactions were quite brisk. Prices were similar to before. Firms such as Yongxing, Tianxiang, Jinlong, and Tongfu were all interested in local Zhen Mei tea, but they were offering slightly lower prices than before. However, as Chinese merchants had low inventories and exhausted sources, they were firm in their position and unwilling to sell at lower prices. In addition, there were scattered transactions in needle tea, aged tea, and other items, and the market was unusually stable.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Oil Market: Hankou White Tung Oil After Flooding <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Lack of Arrivals...Transactions Completely Quiet</p>
<p>Local Villages...Sales Market Slightly Active</p>
<p>After the flooding in Hankou, the streets became waterways, business was suspended, and loading was difficult. There were no transactions in either the domestic or foreign markets. It was reported that foreign firms had sold at 23 taels Shanghai currency per pound before the flooding, but no bids have been made since. Domestic sales have become even quieter due to the continued rise in water levels. The local villages have not been greatly affected by the flooding and have been paying more attention to lacquer work due to the hot weather and lack of work in the fields, so the market in nearby villages has been slightly active. The road is still waiting. However, Hankou tung oil cannot arrive in Shanghai for the time being due to the inconvenience of loading. It will have to wait for the water to recede before loading can be resumed. As a result, Shanghai firms are very short of Hankou tung oil. Although sales are not brisk, they are already stretched thin.</p>

<p>Domestically produced woolens have been selling quite well lately. As early autumn has arrived, buyers are actively purchasing wide and narrow stripes and solid-color camel wool, resulting in the most transactions. Shengda Dragon and Phoenix, Xinda Camel Brand, Weilun Tiger, Weiyi Double Deer, and Hongfa Tianxiang brands are all selling at 1.65 taels per yard. Five-color stripes are priced at 2.175 taels. All prices are for delivery in Shanghai. For export to other ports, an additional 0.01 tael per yard is required. Zhanghua small cap flannel sells for 3.5 to 4.25 taels. Cap makers are actively selecting and ordering Ningbo Jiangshan horsehair interlining at 1.25 yuan per ruler, and tailors are buying 9-inch material at 0.3 yuan per yard.</p>
