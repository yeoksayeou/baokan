<h3>肺癆病家庭之大危險</h3>
<p>共食制與肺癆</p>
<p>中國當代大醫學家余雲岫先生述</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>共食之制中國到處有之南方尤甚方丈一案圍坐七八人餚饌雜陳盃箸交錯家人父子和氣圑聚賓朋主客醉飽俱至非不煦然親唯而周至也然而疾病傳染之鴆媒</p>
<p>即在乎此其冐犯危險與踏白刄赴湯火無以異也聞者疑吾言乎　擊肺癆以爲說肺癆之爲病也雖醫學發達如今日苟病勢稍進者幾不能保其必愈一經診室則生死莫卜此固人人所聞之而色變避之惟恐不速者也然而蔓延日廣罹者日衆畏之而不能免避之而無所逃豈眞有死生之命懸於天哉亦其知識不足習尚未善而防之不得其道也　　二</p>
<p>夫肺癆之爲病爲由細菌傳染而成德國考克博士發明肺癆菌以來四十餘年矣世界學者舉無異議千古神奸豁然呈露方之禹鼎功不在下至於今日婦孺皆知憤憤者獨我護俗耳其爲菌也長不及萬分珊知米突之十五闊不及萬分珊知米突之五以千倍顯微鏡窺之僅如短　無足不能以行也無尾不能以行也無尾不能以游也無羽翼不能以飛翔也欲謂癆瘵由虚損而成又謂肺蟲靈物病人將死飛遁而出傳附他人者妄也而紫庭追癆方且圖其六代之形王肯堂證治準繩採之要皆彷彿相像之辭四庫提要所以語怪之議也</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>肺癆菌之人於肺中也發育生長繁殖醜類故肺癆病人咳唾之痰多有此菌雜居居其中甚者一微塵痰沫包涵癆菌之數多至數千百頭此以顯微鏡檢之歷歷可數非空言恫脅也準此而推一口之痰其中癆菌之數何止幾億萬頭以包藏幾億萬頭癆菌之痰由肺中而唾諸外界必經喉舌沾唇齒而後出然則包藏癆菌之痰沫其汚染於病人喉舌唇齒間者不知有幾微塵而痰中癆菌之蟻附於病人喉舌唇齒間者爲數之多何堪設想盃箸之屬一經肺癆病人之口之接觸被其包涵癆菌之痰所汚染者不知有幾微塵而痰中菌之僕緣於盃箸間者爲數之多何堪設想席上餚饌一經病人下箸其包涵癆菌之痰沫足以汚染餚饌者不知有幾微塵而痰菌緣附浮游於餚饌中者爲數之多又何堪設想同席之人貿然不察而用其盃箸而食其唾餘是吞癆菌也</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>嗟呼患肺癆者而爲賓客寄食之人則一二次之共食或可幸免於傳染若爲家人父子同顆共業之人朝夕與處每飯必共是日二三餐取癆菌而吞之也欲求其不傳染豈可得乎故吾曰其冐犯危險與踏白刄赴湯火無以異也其偶有不被傳染者或有特别之體質關係直幸而免耳曷足恃乎雖肺癆之傳染多在於呼吸之氣而入口之飲食亦取禍之道也然則共食之制乃日取肺癆細菌以饜無病者之制也豈非陋習豈非知命者所宜悚然知戒豈非仁人君子所當大聲疾呼而痛革之哉中國肺癆病人之多實堪驚愕湯湯洪水不知汛濫之所極亦亡國弱種之源也有心世道者亦於習俗改良之點知所措意乎（此文由余氏醫述轉載）</p>

<h3>肺癆病最新醫療法</h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌而此菌一入人體骨則於該處便成結節以斷血行之路又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質包圍其體以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入故雖用種種殺菌藥内服或注射終不能達其病菌之實體内歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法對症療法理學的療法血淸療法藥劑療法及其他一切治療法等尚未完全成功而肺病無藥之說遍　於一世者因未知此深奥學理故耳由此現代結核學者根據上述之學理繼續研究不遺餘力結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑名曰三那星Ｓanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實騐報告此藥有滲透肺病竈之結節及溶解蠟質之作用兼具有殺菌力能根治一二三期之肺癆確有萬試萬靈之特效在中國業經國民政府中央衛生試騐所化騐藥性和平無毒絶無任何副作用兹略舉醫治作用於下</p>
<p>（一）設於試騐管中實騐（三那星）之藥力作用則一分鐘後結核菌皆消失其抗酸性至三分鐘後則此肺結核菌完全殺盡無一倖免</p>
<p>（二）依動物試騐則發見（三那星）能滲入結核病竈内設檢查其病竈内潛伏之結核菌則盡失其抗酸性此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服（三那星）一星期左右則立見咯痰稀釋體熱下降等良好狀態</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服（三那星）達三十天以上則顯見體重增加食慾　進一切症狀</p>

<p>周賢言　手快脚快身快眼快不慌不忙不雜不亂此鐵門昨日之表演也安如磐石穏若泰山此賢言之所以爲鐵門也敵人負鴨蛋歸吾謂鐵門之功居半</p>
<p>江善敬　右衛勇猛冠絶全塲截敵守衛頗見功夫昨監視衛金生甚得力上半時密守勃萊特之偷襲亦稱勞者雖間有失足功多於罪</p>
<p>馮運佑　上半時左衛下半時中堅靜以觀亂逸以待勞守衛功夫不容多贅下半時與李寗對調充中堅全軍頓增生氣爲得勝之關鍵</p>
<p>李寗　先任中堅下半時改左衛李之左衛有口皆碑初以莊世鴻缺席而以李代之但李守有餘中堅須兼進取是以稱職中露侷促　與馮對調後如意稱心</p>
<p>陳家球　自改在前衛後頓時刮目相看前攻後守勞苦功高接濟前方功頗不小昨日中華隊超等出色人材之一</p>
<p>陳璞　全隊資格須讓陳璞最老矣昨日以守衛之功居多下半時生色不少雖未能盡如人意亦當謂之難得</p>

<p>陳虞添　平平未能特殊出色或亦欠聨絡之故盤球昨日當稱第一</p>
<p>羅海光　前鋒人才後起之秀少年血氣上半時内外兼顧頗見英勇惜下半時未能一貫如前殆精力不濟歟</p>
<p>梅洪寳　　力不足是以不能充分發幾昨日常見麽然不能成就平平而已</p>
<p>陳鎭和　天斌獨厚勇猛在前鋒中有目共賞昨日奔走全塲時左時右最後攻破敵門自居大功惟十分得意則未見也</p>
<p>卡納爾　論英軍亦請自守門起卡納爾之守門球在手中被圍攻時輒有莫知所措之憾左右足以貽誤大局尚稱安穏較之周鐵門相去遠矣</p>
<p>史托克　赫赫有名之後衛上半時英軍前鋒無攻力頻受中華壓迫時救出險球不少　　法平　守衛着實不差與史托克伯仲最後之失孤軍無助勢已燎原非戰之罪也</p>
<p>軋許　鹤立鷄　尼球中堅之怪傑退守百不失一球球在脚進攻則球去如砲彈準而有力得此人在全隊安於磐石上半時英軍進攻乏力而免爲危者史法二人外軋許之大功雖孫恩敬輸之或許稍遜謂之怪傑非虚語也</p>
<p>韋斯和　左前衛昨日拚命釘住黑炭功雖有而最後之失亦當歸韋之失守</p>
<p>亨拉的　左前衛英軍中之未出色者</p>

<p>愛立脫　愛立脫以埠際賽而英名遂震昨日一人任三職先右鋒而右内鋒終任中鋒策應攻射的是名手惜欠接應少搭擋爲惜</p>
<p>魏仲爾　英軍前鋒中之弱者上塲數分鐘即受微傷後任右翼庸庸而已原定勞倫斯之代替人</p>
<p>烏萊　英軍前鋒中不得力之一人任左内鋒</p>
<p>衛金生　有名黃毛充左翼昨日敏捷有之惜均球去無眼不準確爲大病失機甚多否則中華隊險遭其毒手幸爲江善敬密密監視寸步不離鬱鬱而終焉</p>

<h3>萬人今日祭黃花</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>一年一度之黄花崗紀念又重現於吾人眼簾孫總理視此次殉難烈士有重大之意義曾謂『是役也集各省革命黨之精英與彼虜爲最後之一搏事雖不成而黄花崗七十二烈士轟轟烈烈之概已震動全球而國内革命之時勢實以造成矣」云云是役碧血横飛浩氣四塞全國久蟄之人心乃大興奮怨憤所積如怒濤排壑不可遏抑不半載而武昌之大革命以成則斯役之價値誠至重且大也』</p>
<p>黄花崗原名紅花崗初潘達微收葬黨人尸首本不欲宣揚詎料翌日保皇黨國是報首先揭載措詞有不利於潘氏潘知事難隠秘乃宣布始末標題爲「諮議局前新鬼錄黄花崗上黨人碑」其意以紅花兩字軟弱不知黃花之雄渾各報沿用迄今遂成定名</p>
<p>徴集辛亥三月二十九廣州革命事實最力者爲朱執信鄒海濱經營墳塲者則爲林子超（森）方韻松（聲濤）審查七十二烈士中年齡最小者爲余東雄年只十八最大者爲黃炳忠年爲四十五其中年在二十至三十之間者佔大多數以省籍言之則廣東佔四十一人福建佔十九人廣西六人四川安徽各三人以縣别則花縣佔十八人以姓别則姓徐者佔十六人云</p>

<p>▲標識之新奇也　該公司以航空爲職務靑天白日飛行萬里其標識爲鳶鳶之飛也翺翔杳冥而性又穏健故取之視中國航空公司之以鷹爲標識者可謂别樹一幟也</p>
<p>▲名論之可師也　孫君與予爲神交近始識荆其爲人也年富力强才長心細曾任古巴領事足跡徧大西洋通各國語言文字餘事又工繪畫能於寸紙中著千邱萬壑余以君今屈爲董事會秘書稍露知馭之慨君曰昨爲元首今爲勞工此歐帮民治之眞精神君何慊焉余憬然若悟謹誌之</p>
<p>▲成績之可觀也　孫君告我曰十六日試飛以六小時十五分即抵北平南苑沿途氣候變遷甚多而機件并未受任何影響餘兩架日内亦可完竣將來飛抵柏林至多不過四日但在俄交未復以前中途須用火車接達則須七八日云</p>

<h3>Parliaments and Conferences in the World Today</h3>
<p>After the closing of the current session of the Japanese Parliament, the various political parties expressed their feelings about the parliament. However, the ruling party, because it had achieved a final victory, said it was a matter worthy of national celebration. The Outer Political Friends Association, Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi, felt that although the tax reduction bill had been passed by a majority, it could not be implemented without a source of funds, and he could not help but worry about the country. Various proletarian factions jointly issued a statement expressing their feelings, saying that the current session of the parliament was a parliament of capitalists and landlords fighting for political power, which ended in chaotic fighting, and was base and ugly. They refused to recognize it. Although the words of each were for their own political party to attack the enemy party, they were also not entirely devoid of a kind of real situation.</p>
<p>As for international conferences, the naval agreement between France and Italy, although there was hope of its establishment before due to the British Prime Minister's visit to France and Italy, there are now disputes and difficulties in drafting, and the situation is said to be serious. Its difficulty in success can be imagined. Moreover, the World Wheat Conference, according to a Rome telegram, the Soviet representative stated that Russia may not be bound by any resolution of the World Wheat Conference. If what he said is true, then the results of the conference and its achievements can also be imagined. In addition to this, if the restriction of rubber between Britain and the Netherlands, the tariff truce conference of European countries, whether private or public, mostly end up with nothing accomplished.</p>

<h3>Points of Contention Between Italy and France in the New Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>Restrictions on Battleships</p>
<p>And Submarine Tonnage</p>
<p>National News, Paris, March 27 - All the difficulties currently being encountered in drafting the naval treaty have now been confirmed by newspapers. The Paris Daily News reports a "serious situation," while other newspapers state that France's submarine tonnage of 80,000 tons is the real point of contention. Other debated points include limiting battleships to 25,000 tons and heavy guns to no more than 12 inches. British Foreign Secretary Henderson returned to England tonight. Before leaving France, he had a final discussion with Foreign Minister Briand and French naval experts. He did not comment on the German-Austrian customs union.</p>
<h3>Trend of German-Austrian Tax Agreement</h3>
<p>Germany May Make Concessions</p>
<p>Submit to the League of Nations for Review</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, March 27 - The storm caused by the partial German-Austrian tax agreement now appears to be gradually calming down. It is said that the incident will temporarily reach a stalemate until the League of Nations Administrative Council meets in mid-May, when the issue will inevitably be raised again. Even if Germany and Austria insist that the agreement has no political implications and does not require discussion by the League of Nations, the major powers will inevitably try to require Germany's consent to allow the League of Nations Administrative Council to conduct a legal review. The United Kingdom is particularly engaged in this endeavor. The London Times recently stated that British Foreign Secretary Henderson's suggestion for the League of Nations to analyze the agreement has been misunderstood by Berlin, and British Ambassador to Germany Sir Horace Rumbold and German Chancellor Brüning have also exchanged views. The British Ambassador wants to examine the legal points of the agreement, while the German Chancellor stated that the agreement is purely economic and not a political combination. However, Brüning previously declared that Germany and Austria have nothing to fear from a legal review, so it is felt that Brüning has hope for a final concession to Henderson's suggestion.</p>

<h3>Great Danger to Families with Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Communal Dining and Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Narrated by Mr. Yu Yunxiu, a prominent contemporary Chinese physician</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The practice of communal dining is prevalent throughout China, especially in the South. Seven or eight people sit around a table, sharing dishes and exchanging cups and chopsticks. Family members, fathers, and sons gather together in harmony, while hosts and guests eat and drink to their fill, creating a warm and intimate atmosphere. However, this is precisely the medium through which diseases are transmitted. The danger involved is no different from treading on sharp blades or plunging into boiling water. Do those who hear this doubt my words? Let me use the example of tuberculosis to explain. Although medical science has advanced to its current state, patients with even slightly advanced tuberculosis can hardly be guaranteed a cure. Once diagnosed, their fate becomes uncertain. This is something everyone has heard of, and they change color and avoid it for fear of being too slow. However, the disease spreads wider and wider, and more and more people are afflicted. They fear it but cannot avoid it, and they try to avoid it but have nowhere to escape. Is it really that life and death are predetermined by fate? It is also due to insufficient knowledge and imperfect habits, so they cannot prevent it in the right way.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is caused by bacterial infection. It has been over 40 years since Dr. Koch of Germany discovered the tuberculosis bacillus. Scholars worldwide have no objection. The millennium-old trickster has been exposed. Its contribution is no less than that of Yu's Ding. Today, even women and children know about it. The only ones who are angry are my conservative folks. The bacillus is less than 1/10,000 of a Sanzhi meter in length and less than 1/10,000 of a Sanzhi meter in width. When viewed through a thousand-fold microscope, it appears only like a short line. It has no feet to walk, no tail to swim, and no wings to fly. It is absurd to say that tuberculosis is caused by deficiency and that lung worms are spiritual creatures that fly out when a patient is about to die and attach themselves to others. Moreover, the Ziting method of chasing tuberculosis attempts to depict the shape of its six generations, and Wang Kentang's "Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng" adopts words that are all vague and imaginative. The Siku Quanshu summarizes them as strange talks.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>When tuberculosis bacilli enter the lungs, they develop, grow, and multiply into hideous forms. Therefore, the sputum of tuberculosis patients often contains these bacilli. In severe cases, a tiny speck of sputum contains thousands of bacilli. This can be clearly seen under a microscope and is not an empty threat. Based on this, one can deduce that a single mouthful of sputum contains hundreds of millions of bacilli. The sputum containing hundreds of millions of bacilli travels from the lungs to the outside world, passing through the throat and tongue, and adhering to the lips and teeth. Therefore, countless specks of sputum containing bacilli contaminate the patient's throat, tongue, lips, and teeth, and the number of bacilli clinging to the patient's throat, tongue, lips, and teeth is unimaginable. Once cups and chopsticks come into contact with the mouth of a tuberculosis patient, they are contaminated by specks of sputum containing bacilli. The number of bacilli clinging to the cups and chopsticks is unimaginable. Once a patient dips their chopsticks into the dishes, countless specks of sputum containing bacilli are enough to contaminate the dishes, and the number of bacilli clinging to and floating in the dishes is also unimaginable. Those who share the table carelessly use the same cups and chopsticks and eat the patient's leftovers, thus swallowing tuberculosis bacilli.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Alas, if a person with tuberculosis is a guest staying for a short time, they may fortunately avoid infection by sharing a meal once or twice. However, if they are family members, fathers, and sons living and working together, sharing every meal every day, they are swallowing tuberculosis bacilli two or three times a day. How can they not be infected? Therefore, I say that the danger they are taking is no different from treading on sharp blades or plunging into boiling water. Those who are not infected by chance may have special physical conditions that allow them to escape, but this is not something to rely on. Although tuberculosis is mostly transmitted through the air, food and drink also lead to disaster. Therefore, communal dining is a system of taking tuberculosis bacteria every day to satiate the healthy. Is this not a陋习? Is this not something that those who know fate should fear and abstain from? Is this not something that benevolent gentlemen should loudly call for and resolutely reform? The large number of tuberculosis patients in China is truly alarming. Like a raging flood, the extent of its devastation is unknown, and it is also the source of national subjugation and racial weakness. Those who care about the world should know where to focus their efforts on improving customs. (This article is reprinted from Mr. Yu's medical writings)</p>

<h3>The Latest Medical Treatment for Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis) is the tuberculosis bacillus. Once this bacillus enters the human body, it forms nodules at that location to block blood flow. Moreover, the tuberculosis bacillus can secrete an acid-resistant waxy substance to surround its body and defend against the invasion of all external drugs. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they ultimately cannot reach the actual body of the germ. The natural therapies, symptomatic therapies, physical therapies, serum therapies, drug therapies, and all other treatments that medical experts have been accustomed to using in the past have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for lung disease has spread throughout the world because they did not know this profound theory. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the above theory, continue to research tirelessly, and as a result, have created this chemical panacea that kills all tuberculosis bacilli, named Sanosin. This drug was successfully invented in accordance with the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch of Germany, the discoverer of tuberculosis bacillus, and Dr. Burger of Germany, the inventor of the tuberculosis bacillus dewaxing technique. According to current experimental reports from various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of pulmonary lesions and dissolving the waxy substance, and also has bactericidal power that can radically cure stages one, two, and three of tuberculosis. It has truly magical effects. It has been chemically tested by the Central Hygiene Testing Institute of the National Government of China and found to be safe, non-toxic, and completely free of any side effects. The therapeutic effects are briefly listed below:</p>
<p>(1) When the medicinal power of (Sanosin) is tested in a test tube experiment, the tuberculosis bacilli all disappear after one minute, and their acid resistance is completely eliminated after three minutes, completely killing the tuberculosis bacilli without a single survivor.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have found that (Sanosin) can penetrate into the tuberculosis lesions. When examining the tuberculosis bacilli lurking within the lesions, they are found to have completely lost their acid resistance. This proves that their waxy substance has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take (Sanosin) internally for about a week, they will immediately see good results such as thinning of sputum and lowering of body temperature.</p>
<p>(4) If patients continue to take (Sanosin) internally for more than 30 days, they will visibly gain weight, have improved appetite, and all symptoms will gradually be alleviated, ultimately achieving the great effect of returning to life and rebirth.</p>

<h3>Receiving Important Foreign News</h3>
<p>The proposal to take independence as the goal is still under consideration. Bittel, chairman of the All-India Congress Committee, stated that the Delhi agreement is only a temporary truce, and the war has only been temporarily suspended, not abandoned. Gandhi mentioned the tragedies in Kanpur and Chaipo and urged the committee to immediately find ways to eliminate the cause of these disasters.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, March 27 - Churchill spoke in London, advocating a tough policy towards the Indian unrest. However, Governor-General Irwin stated at a farewell banquet last night that some people believe that a strong government can quell the Kuomintang's actions, but in reality, this statement is superficial, forced, and completely out of touch with reality.</p>
<p>Reuters, Allahabad, March 28 - The situation in Kanpur has greatly improved. Scattered incidents of fighting have decreased. A total of about 10,000 people have gone to the neighboring four villages. However, arson and looting still occur from time to time. Yesterday, several gold workshops opened by Indians were burned. To date, a total of 200 houses have been burned in the city. Today, a slight panic arose in Allahabad, and several stores moved their inventory.</p>
<p>Reuters, Kanpur, March 27 - After the riots, the military and police patrolled the streets, and people gradually calmed down. Several houses were robbed and burned, and several people were killed by stray bullets. At the same time, there is a risk of cholera breaking out in the troubled area because the streets are difficult to clean. In this riot, 160 people died and 300 were injured, all of whom are being treated in hospitals.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, March 27 - The Legislative Assembly today rejected the financial bill by a vote of 60 to 56. Although the Governor-General sent a letter to the Speaker stating that the bill should be passed, it was ineffective. Members opposed the increase in income tax, and Special Finance Commissioner Schuster agreed to reduce the amount collected by 10 million rupees, but the Assembly still struck down the bill. Tomorrow is the deadline for submitting this bill to the Senate for review.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ending with a Struggle for Power</p>
<p>Exposing the Weakness of Parliamentary Politics</p>
<p>The Proletarian Faction Issued a Joint Statement</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, March 28 - The closing ceremony of the 59th Diet was held in the Upper House at 11:00 AM today. Cabinet members and members of both houses attended. After the meeting, Land Minister Ugaki read the imperial rescript, and the ceremony ended at 11:05 AM.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, March 28 - After the Diet closed, Prime Minister Hamaguchi expressed his feelings, saying: "This Diet was a turbulent autumn for the government. I was deeply worried about the unexpected disaster I suffered before the Diet opened. Fortunately, all parties understood the sincerity of the current cabinet, and the session was able to end peacefully. A total of 64 laws were passed, which is something to celebrate for the country. In the future, I will sincerely and earnestly implement everything I have declared in the Diet. My health is no longer a concern, and I will work harder to live up to the expectations of the people."</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, March 28 - Seiyukai President Inukai Tsuyoshi expressed his feelings about the Diet, saying: "The ministers' answers in this Diet were too unfriendly, which is very regrettable. Prime Minister Hamaguchi clung to power and only attended briefly near the end of the session, which made the people doubt their faith in Hamaguchi's responsibility as an assistant. Although both the tax reduction bill and the budget bill were passed by a majority, they cannot be implemented without financial resources. Thinking about this makes me worried for the country."</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, March 28 - After the Diet closed, various proletarian factions jointly issued a statement, saying: "This Diet was a parliament for capitalist landlords and political parties to争夺争权, ending with chaos and idleness. It was base and ugly and unbearable to watch. The suppression of the speeches of proletarian party members and the repression of the masses outside the parliament were particularly revealing. Although the reactionary labor union bill and the tenant bill were not finished审议, it can be judged that they themselves deny the function of parliament. We hereby declare that the proletarian party members will fight to the end with them for the interests of the proletarian masses."</p>
<h3>Political Unrest in Spain Continues</h3>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, March 27 - The political turmoil that has been brewing for months is now showing signs of breaking out again. Large numbers of police are now patrolling the streets of Madrid, and rumors of a military dictatorship are rampant. The root cause of the public's anxiety is the Ministry of Finance's negotiations with American and other bankers for a £12 million loan to maintain the currency system. Republican leaders will vigorously criticize the government for this. At the same time, General Queipo de Llano, the head of the military tribunal that is trying prominent Republicans, published an article stating that Spain will never again allow a dictatorship. What this statement implies has aroused much speculation among the masses.</p>
<p>National News, Madrid, March 27 - The Spanish cabinet has been able to maintain a temporary situation, but its fate is ultimately like the setting sun. It is expected that after the next election, Alba will replace Azana and build a constitutional party cabinet. Alba is highly respected by the Republican Party, and even the Socialist Party is inclined to join him.</p>
<h3>World Wheat Conference</h3>
<p>Specifically Discussing Methods to Remedy the Wheat Market</p>
<p>Russia Declares It Will Not Be Bound by the Resolutions</p>
<p>National News, Rome, March 27 - The World Wheat Conference, initiated and convened by Italy, opened here yesterday. Representatives from Russia, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Central America, France, England, Ireland, Australia, Canada, South Africa, India, Greece, Nicaragua, Panama, Siam, Switzerland, Poland, the Netherlands, and Hungary are participating. Soviet Russian chief delegate Dr. Krelemann stated today that Soviet Russia will not be bound by any resolutions of the International Agricultural Society or the World Wheat Conference. However, Soviet Russia is extremely willing to assist in reducing the panic in the world wheat industry. Soviet Russia is currently not experiencing any panic, and wheat prices are quite low due to increased production skills and the elimination of rents, etc. Representatives from various countries will now study possible remedies for the wheat industry panic, but they do not hope to resolve this matter completely. They only want to roughly define a policy and propose various suggestions so that the wheat market can be turned around. This conference is also preparing to hold a second conference of the same nature, the date of which will be decided during the meeting.</p>
<h3>French Coal Miners' Strike May Be Avoided</h3>
<p>Government's Mediation Efforts</p>
<p>Parliament Expresses Gratitude</p>
<p>National News, Paris, March 27 - The major strike of 100,000 French coal miners has now been suspended through the mediation of Prime Minister Laval. The miners have accepted the Prime Minister's mediation to reduce wages by 8 percent starting in May (the mine owners previously proposed a 10 percent reduction), and the workers' representatives have convened representatives from various regions on Saturday and Sunday to make a final opinion. Parliament was extremely pleased to hear about this. The Prime Minister reported to Parliament that the government had ordered the railway administration not to use illegal coal in the future, and that the freight rate for coal produced in northern France should be reduced by 15 percent. Parliament cheered upon hearing this.</p>
<h3>German President Issues Emergency Decree</h3>
<p>Outlawing Acts That Disrupt Public Order</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, March 28 - German President Hindenburg today issued an emergency decree pursuant to Article 48 of the Constitution, empowering the government to exercise emergency powers during the parliamentary recess to outlaw extremist acts that disrupt public order. This order is sufficient to increase the effectiveness of current laws and can prohibit all open-air gatherings and speeches. The Minister of the Interior, upon receiving the order, immediately transmitted it to the state governments, requesting them to prohibit atheist groups from holding meetings in their jurisdictions during Easter.</p>
<h3>Official Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from Kaifeng: To all newspaper offices, may they be aware that in Jiangxi Province, the bandits have been rampaging for a long time, and the suffering has been most severe in the ten districts of Ji'an. The Ji'an area has always been a sanctuary for the bandits, with Jinggang and Donggu Mountains as their gathering places. For two years, the towns and cities of the Ji'an area have been occupied by the bandits. The bandits have taken advantage of the terrain, spread their influence, and deceived the people with lies. The flames of rebellion have spread everywhere, and immoral acts have been rampant. Corpses fill the great rivers, and blood stains the Great Wall. The solemn society is in utter chaos. Row upon row of city walls are half-destroyed by fire. Young women are forced into brothels. Innocent and beautiful young boys are kidnapped to the bandit dens, where they are forced into labor or even have their stomachs cut open and their eyes gouged out, their bodies buried and bones destroyed, turning into dust. All along the roads, only the sounds of weeping can be heard, and a foul stench fills the air for miles. Even the Red Eyebrows and Huang Chao were not as cruel, and Li Zicheng was less savage. The atmosphere is heavy with death, but who cares for the wronged ghosts? The mournful wind howls, but who summons the souls who died in vain? It is estimated that no fewer than 200,000 compatriots have been brutally murdered by the bandits, and countless men and women have fled their homes. They are thin and haggard, wandering the world, sleeping in the open, eating in the wind, and hesitating on the roads. When they encounter other refugees, they can only share the sorrow of their broken homes, reminisce about the old days, and frequently wipe away tears of common loss. They look in vain for their mothers, but clouds cover the Qiling Mountains. They call for their children, but where are they? The Gan River sobs. They beg for alms, but there is no one to help them. They exchange their daughters for grain, or become servants. Who will provide them with gruel? Everywhere one goes, one hears only sounds of sorrow. All that remains is a landscape of burning hills and a desolate scene. The sight of the yellow flowers on the homeland is unbearable. Although the army has now gathered and the suppression is imminent, the old and young have long sighed about their drifting lives, and their resettlement is of utmost urgency. Our association, deeply concerned about providing assistance, is gradually becoming less capable. We sympathize with the suffering of the refugees and are making our calls for help. We hope to divert water from the West River to relieve the drought in the ditches, and to distribute grain to rescue the suffering refugees in Zhongze. We hope to provide timely relief and early comfort. Those who use words to appeal for the disaster victims and raise funds to gather support are to be praised for their benevolence. Our gratitude will be eternal. It is not just the tens of thousands of suffering people in Ji'an who prostrate themselves in the mud. The urgent telegram is filled with voices and tears. We respectfully submit the donation list and hope for your attention. The Ji'an Ten Districts Relief Association of Jiangxi Province, based in Henan, respectfully thanks you.</p>
<p>Telegram from Shenyang: To all newspaper offices, may they be aware that Xue Liang and others have repeatedly received telegrams from the Central Party Headquarters, appointing them as special party affairs instructors for the five provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin, respectively. Xue Liang and others, in accordance with the order, gathered in Shenyang on March 26 and solemnly swore to take office. Wu Tiecheng, a member of the Central Committee, was also sent by the Central Committee to supervise the oath-taking. Thinking that accepting the order from the Party means dutifully complying, we are willing to act like broken arrows and exhaust our limited abilities. We can only look up to the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and follow the lead of those who know the mission first, with the sincerity of unwavering faith and loyalty, to build a great cause of saving the people and the nation. We eagerly await your guidance to avoid negligence. We respectfully submit this telegram for your attention.

<h3>137th Meeting of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Passed the Law on Disciplinary Actions for Public Officials</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan held its 137th meeting on the 28th. Thirty-four members, including Liu Guanxun, were present, with Shao Yuanchong presiding. The following items were discussed: (1) The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and its attached regulations were decided to be submitted to the Foreign Affairs and Military Affairs Committees for review. (2) The report of the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee on the interpretation of Articles 7 and 13 of the Publications Law was decided to be passed according to the review report. (3) The report of the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee on the draft Law on the Organization of the Public Officials Disciplinary Committee was decided to be passed. (4) The draft Law on Disciplinary Actions for Public Officials was reviewed and decided to be passed with amendments. (5) The draft amendments to the County Organization Law were reviewed. (6) The draft amendments to the Implementing Regulations of the County Organization Law were reviewed. It was decided that the above two cases should be submitted to the Legal System Committee for joint review with the Autonomous Law Drafting Committee.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Interpretation of the Publications Law</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department previously stated that the registration of newspapers and news agencies was handled by the Party Headquarters, while the filing of cases was handled by administrative agencies. After the promulgation of the Publications Law, many provinces have had doubts about handling the above-mentioned matters. Before the promulgation of the Publications Law, local governments had their own provisional regulations for handling newspaper and news agency matters. Article 7 of the Publications Law has provisions for registration. Does the registration mentioned in this article equate to filing a case? And should the previous case-filing procedures in various places be uniformly suspended because of this registration? Regarding the coordination procedures between the government and the Party Headquarters for newspaper registration, should publications concerning Party affairs and Party doctrines be registered with both the Party Headquarters and the government? Furthermore, what is the scope of the matters designated in Articles 7 and 13 regarding the recording of Party doctrines and Party affairs? Can the publication of resolutions of the Central Standing Committee by newspapers be regarded as a record of Party affairs? The Legislative Yuan was consulted for interpretation. The Water Court issued it to the Legal System Committee for review. The committee's review concluded that the filing of cases and registration of newspapers and news agencies serve the same purpose: to know their internal organization and the purpose of their publication before they begin publishing, so as to facilitate inspection and verification. After the implementation of the Publications Law, there is no need to fulfill the case-filing procedures in addition to applying for registration in accordance with the law. All kinds of provisional regulations originally stipulated by local governments regarding this case-filing matter should uniformly become invalid. Newspapers or magazines that publish matters related to Party doctrines or Party affairs should apply for registration with both the Party Headquarters and the government. Articles 7 and 27 of the Publications Law stipulate this very clearly. The resolutions of the Central Standing Committee are naturally matters related to Party doctrines or Party affairs. The publication of such resolutions should be subject to the provisions of Article 7, Paragraph 3, and Article 13, Paragraph 2, of the Publications Law. This opinion was submitted in a report requesting immediate delivery to the plenary session. Today (the 28th), the 137th meeting of the Legislative Yuan has decided to pass it according to the review report.</p>
<h3>Law on Disciplinary Actions for Public Officials</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan's 137th meeting on the 28th passed the Law on Disciplinary Actions for Public Officials with amendments, as follows:</p>

If the impeached person is a political appointee other than those in the preceding item, it shall be sent to the National Government. 3. If the impeached person is an administrative official, it shall be sent to the Public Officials Disciplinary Committee. (Article 11) If the heads of various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions, or the highest local administrative officer, believe that a public official under their jurisdiction has committed any of the acts specified in Article 2, they shall prepare a document stating the reasons and forward it along with the evidence to the Control Yuan for review. However, for public officials under the recommended rank under their jurisdiction, they may directly send it to the Public Officials Disciplinary Committee for review.

<h3>Hanyang Aircraft Team Disaster in Reconnaissance Mission</h3>
<p>Two Planes Collide in Tuanfeng, Killing Two Pilots</p>
<p>First and Fourth Teams Hold Memorial Service in Hankou</p>
<p>HANKOU COMMUNICATION: The First and Fourth Aircraft Teams of the Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Military Affairs stationed in Hankou were dispatched to Luoshan on the 24th of this month to scout for bandits. Five aircraft, numbers 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45, were jointly dispatched, with pilots from both teams co-piloting. As they flew to the Tuanfeng area under the jurisdiction of Huanggang County, the air bag of the fourth aircraft (number 44) was lowered to the ground to exchange air. Unexpectedly, the fifth aircraft (number 45), which was flying straight forward, was unable to avoid it, causing the two aircraft to collide. Because aircraft 44 was exchanging air and lacked horsepower, it crashed into the wilderness near Tuanfeng. The machine was damaged, and gasoline leaked out, causing a fire. The pilots driving the aircraft, Zhang Mu and Liu Zhengxin, were paralyzed and unable to move from the high fall and were immediately burned to death by the fire. The fuselage was also destroyed by the fire. Aircraft 45 was also severely damaged due to the collision. While in a state of crisis, aircraft 43, which was ahead, heard the alarm and rushed back to help, fortunately without encountering danger. The pilot was unharmed, but the aircraft was severely damaged and could not be repaired. It has been verified that the horsepower of these two aircraft was over 300 horsepower, and they had only been flying for over a year. Each aircraft was worth approximately 150,000 yuan. The two pilots who died, Zhang Mu, was from Xianyou County, Fujian Province, was 24 years old, and graduated from Guangdong Aviation School, serving as a pilot in the Fourth Team. Liu Zhengxin, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, was 21 years old and also graduated from Guangdong Aviation School, serving as a pilot in the First Team. Neither had family members in Hankou. Afterwards, the two teams telegraphed their families and submitted a report to the Ministry of Military Affairs for generous condolences. All officers and soldiers of the two teams wore black armbands from the 25th to express their condolences. A public memorial service was held at 10 a.m. on the 27th to express their condolences, presided over by Yan Yucong, the captain of the First Team. Dozens of people from the aviation community attended the memorial service, and the situation was extremely sad. This is also an unfortunate event for our aviation community (March 27th).</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Supervises the Suppression of Bandits in Baodugu</h3>
<p>Planned to Clear the Bandit Nest Within One Month</p>
<p>JINAN COMMUNICATION: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, has decided to clear the bandit nest in Baodugu. He has ordered the Third Route Army under his command to join forces with the troops of Chen Yaohan in Yizhou, Wang Jun in Mengyin County, and Ma Hongkui in Tai'an to encircle the area. Han himself went south to supervise the troops and severely suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>The pistol brigade under Lei Taiping served as the guard. Lei Taiping took the brigade headquarters and the special service battalion by train to Qufu last night (the 25th). This morning (the 26th), a special train was prepared on the Jinpu Railway, consisting of 14 covered wagons, two flat cars, one factory car, and one guard car, and four cars and the Tiejiache North-China took the lead. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the staff of the accompanying agencies boarded the train, including Li Tianni, Director of the Inspection Department of the Provincial Government, Zhao Liantang, Deputy Director, Jiang Cuijing and Chen Yunqi, Secretaries, Li Tingwei of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, Wang Guangrui of the Finance Department, Zhou Yanguang of the Education Department, Chen Ganru of the Civil Affairs Department, Ren Youwu, Clerk of the High Court, Huang Jie, Officer of the Propaganda Section of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Meng Guangshan, Adjutant of the Headquarters, and Liu Shuxiang, Chief of the Staff Office. In addition, there were two squads of soldiers from the First Battalion of the pistol brigade. At one thirty, Han and the people who came to see him off arrived at the station and said to the press that all the armies engaged in bandit suppression would arrive at their destinations and the general attack order had not yet been issued. There were no more than 3,000 bandits in Baodugu, and they were divided into several groups that were not under unified command. It was expected that the bandit nest could be cleared within a month. He would first go to Qufu, then inspect the counties along the way through Sishui, Mengyin, Yishui, Feixian, Tengxian, Zouxian, Wenshang, Yanzhou, and Tai'an and returned to Jinan in about 20 days. The train left Jinan at around 2 pm. It was heard that Han had printed hundreds of proclamations to be posted in the bandit suppression area. The text of the proclamation was as follows: "Since the rise of the revolutionary army and the spread of war in various provinces, the suffering of the people has been unprecedented. The bandits in various places have taken advantage of the opportunity to rise up and plunder, so that even after the military affairs have been settled, the elders and brothers are still displaced and cannot live in peace. Even their houses are in ruins and their fields are abandoned. It is extremely heartbreaking to talk about it. Since the Chairman took over the military and civilian affairs of the province, he has consistently adhered to the principle of using the army to protect the people and ensuring the people's security as the army's responsibility. He deeply knows that the reason why the people are not at ease is that the bandits have not been quelled. Therefore, he has repeatedly ordered the divisions and brigades under his command and the local militia groups to severely suppress all the bandits within the territory, in order to allow the elders and brothers to live and work in peace. Although troops have been dispatched to suppress the bandits, the bandits often leave when the troops arrive and return when the troops leave, and the root cause has not been eradicated. The bandits in the areas bordering Teng, Fei, and Mengyin counties are especially cunning, and the people have suffered the most. Every time I think about it, it is difficult for me to sleep and eat. The people and the bandits cannot coexist. If there are bandits, there will be no people; if there are people, there must be no bandits. In view of the past failures in bandit suppression, the Chairman has led a strong force to supervise the suppression and vowed to sweep away the nests and eliminate this major scourge for the people. Do not disturb each other when the army passes. If bandits should try to escape, it is hoped that the elders and brothers will cooperate to block them or send them to the government for punishment in accordance with the law, so that none will escape the net. From now on, fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters will be able to emerge from the water and fire and ascend to the mat, so that they can share the happiness of peace. I am afraid that the people of all circles may not know this, so I hereby issue this proclamation." (26th)</p>
<h3>The Haiyuan Pavilion Collection of Books is Priced at One Million</h3>
<p>Yang Jingfu Expresses His Willingness to Donate Half and Sell Half</p>
<p>The Government Will Send Personnel to Tianjin to Negotiate</p>
<p>JINAN COMMUNICATION: The collection of books of the Yang family of Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng was previously investigated by the Shandong Provincial Government upon consultation with the Ministry of Education, and its sale was prohibited. The Education Department then instructed the Shandong Library to conduct an investigation. Subsequently, the library drafted a draft agreement on the Haiyuan Pavilion collection of books (which was published in a previous newspaper) and sought the written consent of the Yang family. Yang Jingfu, the owner of the collection, replied to the library after receiving the draft in Tianjin, saying that he was "grateful for the repeated expressions of concern, but would reply to the draft agreement in detail later." However, to this day, there has been no written reply. Only a few days ago, Yang Jingfu came to Jinan once and indirectly expressed his willingness to accept the third method of the agreement (i.e., the government prepares a price to purchase the entire collection). Later, after being persuaded by relatives and friends that this would damage the family's reputation, Yang expressed his willingness to accept the second method (i.e., donate half and sell half), but the government must offer a price of one million yuan. Upon receiving this news, the government immediately sent personnel to negotiate, but Yang had already returned to Tianjin. The matter now rests on Yang Jingfu's decision with his wife's father, Lao Zhichang, while Yang's old lady (Yang Jingfu's adoptive mother) is no longer able to make a decision. Therefore, the government plans to send personnel to Tianjin to negotiate with Yang Jingfu. Since Yang Jingfu has expressed his willingness to donate half and sell half, this problem should not be difficult to solve. However, the Shandong Provincial Treasury is currently extremely depleted, and it is feared that the source of the huge sum of money for the books will become a problem. According to a certain bibliophile, the books in the Yang family's collection in Jinan are not rare. If all the books stored in Tianjin were transported back, it would not be excessive to ask for one million yuan for half donation and half sale. According to reports, the Yang family's collection of books includes Yingshu Yulu, but several recently discovered works are not recorded in Yingshu Yulu. There is a Song edition of Zhuangzi, which Yang Jingfu sold to Zhou Shutao (son of the former Governor of Liangjiang, Zhou Fu) for 3,000 yuan, which is the most complete edition in China. There is also a Song edition of Shicai Hall Hanji, 30 volumes of the main collection and 10 volumes of the outer collection, for a total of 32 volumes, bound into four cases, which is also the only surviving copy in China. There is also Su Dongpo's handwritten and Tao poems, which those who have seen it say is still as complete as new. The above three works are not recorded in Yingshu Yulu. In addition, the Haiyuan Pavilion also has two copies of the Song Yaoben Hanji, which, although not the Shicai Hall edition, are also extremely precious. (26th)</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Promises to Allocate Military Expenses for the Jin Sui Army</h3>
<p>1.5 Million Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>TAIYUAN COMMUNICATION: The Jin-Sui military expenditure issue has caused tension here since the Liaoning side telegraphed a few days ago, ordering Jin to raise the funds themselves. The price of Jin currency has also soared repeatedly, which is related to this. General Xu, Yang, Sun and others have repeatedly discussed and sent representatives to Shenyang to see Mr. Zhang, stating that Shanxi is unable to bear the burden and requesting Mr. Zhang to handle the matter in accordance with the Tianjin Resolution. The representative telegraphed back yesterday, saying that Mr. Zhang had expressed his approval of our request, but ordered Lian to report the Shanxi revenue and expenditure budget book immediately for verification, and ordered to reduce the military expenditure of each army as appropriate. According to another telegram, although Mr. Zhang agreed to assist the Jin-Sui military expenditure on a monthly basis, it should not exceed 1.5 million yuan per month. According to a certain important person here, after the Jin-Sui army is inspected, the military expenditure of all the armies should be drawn from the Deputy Commander's Office in accordance with the Tianjin Resolution. According to the Tianjin Agreement, in addition to Shanxi's national income, the Northeast will allocate 3 million yuan to the Jin army each year. Moreover, this case was approved by Deputy Commander Zhang in both the Tianjin and Fan Yang meetings. Since the Jin army has been inspected and dispatched by the Northeast, the military expenditure should be subsidized by the Northeast. Recently, Deputy Commander Zhang ordered Jin and Sui provinces to raise the funds themselves. In fact, Shanxi's finances are unable to do so, so the military and political authorities still unanimously request Deputy Commander Zhang to handle the matter in accordance with the Tianjin Agreement. As for the exchange of banknotes for cash, the price of each yuan has risen from 2.4 yuan to 3 yuan in the past three to five days, and the people are in a state of extreme anxiety. However, many merchants are taking advantage of the situation to raise prices. Although the government has promised to do its best to maintain the provincial banknotes, the price of the banknotes is still falling. (24th)</p>

<h3>Notorious Bandit Jiang Guochang Killed in Eastern Anhui</h3>
<p>Remnants of Ma Yuren's Band Fleeing Towards Jiangsu Border</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Jiang Guochang, a notorious bandit in eastern Anhui, nicknamed "Three Legs," has been harassing eastern Anhui for more than a decade. Recently, he colluded with the remnants of Ma Yuren's band, led by Qi Yaozong, and roamed between Jiangsu and Anhui. The National Army has repeatedly encircled and suppressed them, but they have not been completely eradicated. Earlier this month, near Xiaobian Village along the Jinpu Railway in Mingguang, they attempted to intercept trains. Zhang Lisheng, commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division, dispatched Ge Wucheng's 3rd Brigade and Zhang Shutian's 4th Brigade of the division, along with police and local militias from Chuzhou and Lai'an counties, to剿辦and pursue them. The bandits fled to the western border of Chuzhou County. On the 24th, the two cavalry brigades surrounded the bandits in villages such as Xiaoyangchong and Erwangzhuang and launched a fierce attack, killing over 400 bandits. Jiang Guochang and a pseudo-battalion commander under his command, surnamed Yang, were also killed on the spot. Over sixty bandits were captured alive, and over one hundred and forty male and female hostages were rescued. The officers and soldiers then cut off Jiang's head and transported it to Chuzhou County. Today (26th) at around 3 p.m., it was transferred to Bengbu, where it will be hung up for public display. With Jiang's death, a major scourge in eastern Anhui has been eliminated. Qi Yaozong's band, finding it difficult to establish a foothold in Anhui, has already fled east, intending to escape back to Jiangsu Province. Zhang Lisheng has telegraphed Zhang Zhijiang, the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, requesting that he quickly dispatch troops to intercept them. Jiang Kanru, deputy commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division, accompanied by staff member Mo Jinlong, took a car to Chuzhou this afternoon at 3 p.m., carrying funds to reward the officers and soldiers who suppressed the bandits in order to encourage them.

<p>Summary of the Four-County Clearing Conference: After Cao Pang, commander of the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force, was ordered to concurrently serve as the temporary commander of the joint suppression efforts in Songjiang, Jinshan, Jiashan, and Pinghu counties, he actively suppressed bandits and captured key bandits such as Zhu Luo'e and others, who have been escorted to Songjiang for detention. Yesterday (26th), Commander Cao convened a four-county clearing conference. Those present included Jin Qingzhang, magistrate of Songjiang County; Qu Yunshu, secretary of Jinshan County; Ye Zheng'gang, representative of Jiashan County; Gao Xiaolan, representative of Pinghu County; Sun Kaixun, battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Fourth Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Force; Bai Jizhi, battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment; Zhao Xunshi, battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of the Zhejiang Security Force; Kai Jun, chief of the Zhejiang Xincang Security Group; Xue Zhichao, representative of the Second District of the Zhejiang Water Police; Xu Pucheng, chief of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police; and local representatives, etc. The meeting was held at the headquarters.

The resolutions included: (1) Establishing security groups in each district; (2) Burying exposed corpses and coffins to prevent bandits from hiding weapons; (3) Continuing to blockade small rivers and ports during the clearing period. The above were proposed by Commander Cao. (1) To hold joint guarantee agreements, a new household register must first be created. It was resolved that each county would task the district and township heads to handle this. (2) Requesting that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments each send two warships to patrol the coastal waters along Songjiang, Jinshan, Jiashan, and Pinghu counties. (3) Passing the investigation of bandits and the hiding of weapons to be handled according to the investigation methods. The above were proposed by Jinshan County. (1) If bandit traces are discovered in a certain area, the nearby military units should cooperate with the local police to search. (2) During the clearing period, those who capture bandits with significant circumstances in each county should be handed over to the headquarters, and those with minor circumstances should be interrogated by the respective counties. (3) It was resolved to grant leniency to accomplices who surrender themselves in accordance with the self-surrender regulations issued by Jiangsu Province. The above were proposed by Pinghu County. (1) Conscientiously inspect guns and check boats, and implement joint guarantees in accordance with the methods listed in the clearing instructions to eliminate bandits. (2) Inspecting wharf areas was passed by the Water Police Chief Xu. The remaining cases were lengthy and are omitted.</p>
<p>Confession of the Secretary of the Major Bandit: Zhu Zhenxin, secretary of the major bandit Zhu Luo'e, has also been captured. According to his interrogation by Commander Cao, he is 20 years old, with the courtesy name Zhichen, from Pinghu. He was a teacher at a certain school in Shanghai and was recommended by Fang Jie to serve as Zhu Luo'e's secretary, handling paperwork and correspondence, and was also apprenticed to him. In Qianwei, Luxiang, Langxia, Zhangjing, Dianshan, Jinjiazhuang, Taozhuang, and Gaoxu, he fought with the water and land police, resulting in over two hundred deaths. After the failure, Taibao A'shu escaped by sea, and A'e fled ashore. He was captured in Tianningzhuang, seized a civilian boat, and opened fire again in Zhujiaxing, resulting in over ten deaths. A'shu then led troops with weapons to fight again, but was defeated and the gang dispersed. Currently, Tao A'da, also known as Longhu, and Shen A'lu, Lu Yaosheng, are hiding in Shanghai. Shen Shouyi and his wife Shen Aihua claim to live in a small house at No. 180 Ximen Road, Shanghai, and were mistakenly arrested. Shen used to work in the Jiashan County Party Headquarters. Please allow them to be released on bail.</p>
<p>Clearing News from Headquarters: After the clearing conference at the headquarters yesterday, Commander Cao and the county magistrate representatives discussed the issue of bounty rewards for bandits. The bounty amounts for each bandit have now been compiled. The county offers 2,000 yuan for Taibao A'shu, with varying amounts for others, totaling 12,000 yuan. It was decided that the four counties would be responsible for raising the funds. Jinshan would contribute 4,000 yuan, Songjiang and Pinghu would each contribute 3,000 yuan, and Jiashan would contribute 2,000 yuan. The funds would be deposited in a bank and managed by a committee composed of the four county magistrates and one local representative each, to be used as needed. Since there have been no large-scale disturbances in the bandit areas since the gangs dispersed, the second phase of clearing work should be implemented. Three clearing brigades should be formed, with local authorities as the main body and the military as the auxiliary force. It is reported that implementation will begin in April. Commander Cao has been summoned to Beijing by Chairman Jiang tonight by night train to provide consultation on the compilation of revolutionary war history and to thank him for his promotion to major general.</p>

<h3>(2) Revolutionary Heroes Glorify History</h3>
<p>Our country's participation in this competition began in 1923, which is eight years ago. The first competition's results were mediocre, but this showed our determination for international competition. Since then, we have worked hard to train, and in the second year (i.e., 1924-25), we were able to meet England in the final. At that time, the magnificent and enthusiastic cheers of more than ten thousand spectators in the China baseball field still echo in our minds. However, China lost to England with a score of zero to four. Later, in 1927-28, China and England met again in the final. At that time, China's strength was quite strong and had the hope of winning the championship. Unexpectedly, the Jinan University football team had players traveling in Southeast Asia, such as Feng Yunyou, Chen Zhenhe, and Liang Guansong, who did not join, which affected the team's strength and led to a tragic defeat of two to four. Last year (1929-30), the Chinese team won the final for the third time. China defeated Scotland with a score of two to zero and won the championship. Years of hard work were finally realized. This year, yesterday, China once again played against England in the final. As a result, China won with a score of one to zero and continued to hold the championship. The Shanghai International Football Championship competition began in 1908. Except for the four years of suspension during the European War, it has been held every year without interruption. England has won the most times, followed by Scotland. The past championships are listed below:</p>

<p>1925｜26 Scotland 1926｜27 Scotland</p>
<p>1927｜28 England 1928｜29 Portugal</p>
<p>1929｜30 China 1930｜31 China</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, there have been a total of 19 competitions. England has won 18 times, Scotland 3 times, Ireland once, Portugal once, and China won the championship for the first time last year. This year, China defeated the stubborn England with a score of one to zero, and also has the glory of winning the championship for two consecutive years.</p>
<h3>(3) Over Ten Thousand Fans Sing Triumphantly Together</h3>

<h3>(4) Dragons and Tigers Stare, Bows Drawn and Swords Ready</h3>
<p>Yesterday's International Football Championship final between China and England, the importance of its combat mission and the concentration of talent on both sides, is self-evident. The Chinese team had some difficulty with the replacement of the injured central defender Zhuang Shihong. The final selection of Ningren was still considered satisfactory. England had the support of the cunning Zhazha , and their strength was doubled compared to when they competed with the Jewish team. The Chinese players entered the stadium first, greeted by applause from the crowd. The English team arrived shortly after and the game began. The lineups of the two teams are as follows: Referee Li Silian, Linesmen Le Xiurong and Maxwell.</p>
<h3>Chinese Team Captain Dai Linjing</h3>
<h3>Chinese Team Lineup</h3>
<p>Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Chen Pu Luo Haiguang</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Li Ning Dai Linjing</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing Chen Jiaqiu Chen Yutian</p>
<p>Mei Hongbao</p>

<p>Faping Henri Urle</p>
<p>Kanal Zhaxu Brandt</p>
<p>Stoke Wesu Weifer</p>
<p>Aili Tuo</p>
<h3>(5) Shouting and Roaring, Thousands Easily Defeated</h3>
<p>With the declaration of battle, England opened the ball first against the wind.阻江 Shanjing was careless and leaked the ball. Wei Jinsheng took the opportunity to rush in.佑's placement was appropriate, turning danger into safety. Chen Zhenhe took the lead, a border merchant挑掦, the three central defenders were unable to respond in time. The English defender Zhaxu, a famous player on the sea, was superior in receiving, passing, and intercepting. At that time, the Chinese players repeatedly attacked but were unable to achieve their wishes due to Zhaxu's strength. However, the five English forwards wandered around and were unable to penetrate, thanks to Feng Yunyou's efforts. These two, one Chinese and one English, were shouting and roaring, and thousands were easily defeated, the overlords of the football world.</p>
<h3>(6) Eyes Like Torches, Seeing Thousands of Miles</h3>
<p>At twenty minutes, the English right inside Weifer was injured and withdrew to rest for five minutes before re-entering the battle. At that time, center forward Dai passed the ball to right winger Mei Hongbao. Yang's shot went towards the sky, and all efforts were wasted. The English right winger挑ed the ball, and Zhou Zhongyan got it with both hands and passed it to the front. Then, the English Zhaxu led the whole army to counterattack. Feng Yunyou met him and kicked the ball, but it was blown back by the strong wind and fell towards his own goal. Zhou Zhongmen's eyes were like torches, seeing thousands of miles, and with a single arm strike, the wind and waves were calmed. After another ten minutes, the English army advanced again and retreated due to offside. Luo Haiguang was good at both inside and outside offense and defense. Chen Zhenhe got his pass and bravely invaded. The two English guards blocked him halfway. Chen Jiaqiu followed up, and the ball came from Mei's to Chen Yutian, who挑ed it again and dropped it in front of the goal. Luo Haiguang met it with his head and went over the door. The English left defender Wei Jinsheng挑ed it out. Jiang faced the empty goal and lightly kicked it diagonally out of the goal. The first half ended with no goals scored by either side.</p>
<h3>(7) Overturning Clouds and Rain, Thousands of Changes</h3>
<p>In the sound of the restart, Jiang leaked the ball again and the enemy rushed in, passing it to the front of the goal. Zhou Xianyan rushed out to receive it and was knocked down by the incoming player, but he insisted on not letting go. Relying on his lively figure and superb skills, he preserved the dragon gate, which was a great contribution. A misunderstanding suddenly appeared in the English interior. Chen Yutian took the opportunity to shoot. Kanal knelt down and held it down. Chen Jiaqiu passed it remotely to Chen Zhenhe. Chen kicked back into the field. Dai and Luo, two generals, chased after the shadow. He lost his composure when shooting. Mei passed the ball to the center appropriately. The goalkeeper got it and lost it again. He fell to the ground again. The five forwards arrived at the same time. Zhaxu saved the situation and got out of danger. However, the wind and waves in front of the English goal were still turbulent. It only calmed down after five minutes.</p>
<h3>(8) Three Lineup Changes, Turning Misfortune into Good Fortune</h3>
<p>Li Ning was injured and replaced by Chen Zhenhe. When Li entered the field, his position changed. Chen Zhenhe and Chen Yutian, Li Ning and Feng Yunyou, the four of them switched positions with each other. Zhong菴 changed the lineup three times in order to be tidy. Chen Zhenhe showed his instinct. Faping made a mistake and almost succeeded. The ball turned around. Wei Jinsheng entered from the left and attacked the goal, but was saved by Zhou. In the blink of an eye, he came again. Zhou snatched it and threw it out. Wei Jinsheng kicked it in. Referee Li Silian blew a loud whistle. At that time, the Chinese lost their color and the English cheered. Everyone thought that the Chinese dragon gate had been breached! Unexpectedly, the referee said that the English army was offside, and although they scored, it was invalid. Therefore, the worried were happy and the happy were angry. The second half was the same, and the record was not opened.</p>
<h3>(9) Clouds Open and the Sun Comes, the Earth is in Spring</h3>
<p>At ten minutes, the statutory time had arrived, and the outcome of the China-England match was not yet determined. The overtime was decided again. Dai Linjing took the lead and passed it to the right. Chen Zhenhe was in the right inner position, carrying the ball and advancing quickly, breaking through the passes. When the opportunity came, he shot fiercely at the goal. Center forward Dai was just in front of the goal, and the ball hit his body, causing it to bounce out, which was extremely regrettable. The English army survived and suddenly launched a counterattack, but their strength was weak. They focused on defense and called back center forward Brandt to focus on Chen Zhenhe, forming a formation of seven people defending inside and four people attacking outside. After fifteen minutes, they changed the formation again and fought again. At that time, China showed its spirit of indomitable courage, breaking the boat and vowing not to return. Heaven rewarded their ambition and finally in the last five minutes, Chen Jiaqiu's pass was well-balanced, and the left and middle two departments advanced together. Center forward Dai headed towards the left, falling behind Faping. Luo Haiguang's shot missed, and Chen Zhenhe happened to be there, sweeping it in with his foot, rolling into the goal. The sounds of firecrackers, cheers, applause, and whistles came at the same time, showing China's victory. There was little time left. China finally won this year's championship with this ball!</p>
<h3>(10) Great Achievements Shine Together with the Sun and Moon</h3>
<p>Our Chinese generals fought hard and finally斩broke the enemy and maintained this supreme glorious silver cup. Great achievements must be recorded. Rewards and honors should be given according to merit. Although there are also outstanding and good-fighting generals in the English army, the stones of other mountains can be used to attack jade. They are listed in order:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan: Fast hands, fast feet, fast body, fast eyes, calm, not mixed, not chaotic. This is the performance of the iron gate yesterday. Safe as a rock, stable as Mount Tai. This is why Xianyan is the iron gate. The enemy returned with a duck egg. We said that the iron gate's contribution was half.</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing: The right defender's bravery is unmatched in the entire field. His interception and defense are quite skillful. Yesterday, he monitored Wei Jinsheng very effectively. He also worked hard to closely guard Brandt's sneak attack in the first half. Although there were occasional slips, his merits outweighed his sins.</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou: Left defender in the first half, central defender in the second half. He observed the chaos calmly, waited for work, and his defensive skills need no elaboration. In the second half, he switched with Li Ning to fill the central defender, which added vitality to the entire army and was the key to victory.</p>
<p>Li Ning: First served as central defender, and changed to left defender in the second half. Li's left defender is well-known. Initially, Zhuang Shihong was absent and Li replaced him. However, Li's defense was more than enough, and the central defender had to combine offense and defense, so he was competent and cramped in the middle. After switching with Feng, he was satisfied.</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu: Since changing to the forward, he has been greatly impressed. He has worked hard and made great contributions to both attacking forward and defending backward. He has made a small contribution to helping the front. He is one of the outstanding talents of the Chinese team yesterday.</p>
<p>Chen Pu: The oldest in the entire team must be Chen Pu. Yesterday, he focused on defense. He added a lot of color to the second half. Although he could not be completely satisfactory, it should also be said that it was rare.</p>
<p>Dai Linjing: Although the last ball to keep the silver cup was 黑炭's wonderful shot, Dai's contribution should be counted. The ball came from the left. Without the middle recording, a head could not cross the level of Faping, and it was also a contributor. However, he was closely monitored by the enemy, and his activities were rarely seen.</p>
<p>Chen Yutian: Mediocre and unable to be particularly outstanding, perhaps due to lack of communication. His dribbling yesterday should be called first.</p>
<p>Luo Haiguang: The rising star of the forward talent, a young man with blood. In the first half, he took care of both inside and outside, which was quite heroic. It is a pity that he could not maintain his previous performance in the second half, probably due to lack of energy.</p>
<p>Mei Hongbao: His strength is insufficient, so he could not fully发挥. He was often seen 么然 yesterday, but he could not achieve anything. He was mediocre.</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe: He is endowed with unique talents and is brave and commendable among the forwards. Yesterday, he ran all over the field, sometimes left and sometimes right. He made a great contribution to finally breaking the enemy's goal. However, he was not very proud.</p>
<p>Kanal: When discussing the English army, please start with the goalkeeper. Kanal's goalkeeper has the regret of not knowing what to do when the ball is in his hand and he is besieged. The left and right are enough to delay the overall situation. He is still considered stable, but he is far from Zhou's iron gate.</p>
<p>Stoke: A famous defender. In the first half, the English forwards had no offensive power and were frequently oppressed by China. He saved many dangerous balls. Faping's defense was really good and was equal to Stoke. The last loss was due to an isolated army and the situation had become燎原, not a crime of war.</p>
<p>Zhazhu:鹤立鷄 A strange man among the defenders. He never loses when defending. The ball is on his foot and the attack is like a cannonball, accurate and powerful. With this person, the whole team is safe as a rock. In the first half, the English army lacked offensive power and avoided danger. Apart from the great contributions of Shi and Fa, Zhazhu's great contribution, although Sun Enjing lost to him, may be slightly inferior. It is no exaggeration to call him a strange man.</p>
<p>Wesu: The left forward tried his best to nail 黑炭 yesterday. Although he made a contribution, the last loss should also be attributed to Wei's loss of defense.</p>
<p>Henri: A non-outstanding player among the English forwards.</p>
<p>Brandt: A famous center forward from Schutde. Yesterday, he served as a center forward in the first half and then changed to a right inside forward. He galloped across the field and attracted attention. He was powerful in both offense and defense, especially defense. He was the leader of the English forwards.</p>
<p>Aili Tuo: Aili Tuo's fame was shaken by the inter-city competition. Yesterday, he served three positions, first as right forward, then right inside forward, and finally as center forward. He was a master of responding to attacks and shots. Unfortunately, he lacked response and a lack of partner was a pity.</p>
<p>Wei Zhonger: The weakest among the English forwards. He was slightly injured a few minutes after entering the field and then served as right winger, which was mediocre. He was originally the replacement for Lawrence.</p>
<p>Urle: One of the ineffective players among the English forwards, serving as left inside forward.</p>
<p>Wei Jinsheng: A famous yellow hair who served as left winger. Yesterday, he was agile, but all his balls had no eyes and were inaccurate, which was a big problem and lost many opportunities. Otherwise, the Chinese team would have been in danger. Fortunately, Jiang Shanjing closely monitored him, not leaving him for a moment, and he ended up depressed.</p>

<h3>Chongming Schools' Teachers and Staff Resume Work</h3>
<p>County Magistrate is Responsible for Raising Funds</p>
<p>Due to the excessive amount of fees owed by the Education Bureau to various schools in Chongming, a unanimous work slowdown occurred. The Education Bureau telegraphed the county government to allocate funds for repayment and督促instructed all schools to resume classes as usual.

On the 26th, the representatives of the teachers and staff who went to the province returned to Chongming and stated that they should agree to resume classes first. Xu Shang's method, the county government also agreed to issue one and a half months' expenses before the resumption of classes and another half month's expenses within one week, with County Magistrate Shen responsible. On the evening of the 26th, the work slowdown committee decided to reluctantly accept this method and notified all schools to resume work together from the 27th, and decided to convene representatives from all schools on the 29th to discuss the fundamental solution for clearing education fees in detail in order to achieve a satisfactory result. However, Deputy Director Zhang Peishu has not yet returned due to his inability to cope.</p>

<h3>Today's Commemoration of the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs</h3>
<p>All Sectors of the City Hold Meetings to Commemorate</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM in the City Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Today (29th) is the anniversary of the revolutionary martyrs who died at Yellow Flower Mound. The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters has already notified all agencies, organizations, and party headquarters at all levels to send four representatives to the City Party Headquarters to hold a commemorative meeting. Rural areas and various agencies, organizations, and schools farther away from the city may also hold separate commemorative ceremonies. All sectors of the city will fly flags at half-mast and close business for one day, and suspend entertainment to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 Martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound. All agencies will take a day off to express their condolences. The French Concession Water and Electricity workers plan to request the company authorities to provide an additional day off since today falls on a Sunday. Lu Guanhong and Zhang Renjun were specially appointed as representatives to first negotiate with the Chinese compradore Shen Shumei, and then Shen accompanied Lu and Zhang, two representatives to ask the foreman.

<h3>Jianghai Customs Requests Foreign Warships to Withdraw from the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>And Confiscate Naval Buoys Set Up in the Port. Jianghai Customs has recently received an order from the National Government to write to the consuls general of various countries in Shanghai, requesting warships from various countries not to dock in the Huangpu River, and requesting the confiscation of naval buoys set up by Britain, the United States, France, Japan, and Italy in the port of Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs' reason is that the existence of such buoys is enough to cause fear among travelers and Shanghai pilots from various countries, and the initial port development plan did not anticipate the entry and exit of such huge ships as today. According to customs officials, if this continues, accidents will inevitably occur near the naval buoys in the future for huge ships traveling in the river. After receiving this letter, the consuls of various countries said that this request was not only reasonable but also inevitable, but the result is currently unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Jin Liyuan Case Breaks Down</h3>
<p>Sandetang Should Bear Full Responsibility</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong Urgently Telegraphed to Negotiate with the French Ambassador</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Said It Has Instructed Sincerity to Resolve</p>
<p>The Jin Liyuan Wharf case cannot be negotiated due to the French maritime agreement. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to resolve the matter through diplomatic means. If it still does not comply, the government is requested to cancel the Sandetang's land deed to maintain national navigation. It is learned that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again, urging Wang Zhengting to negotiate with the French ambassador. The following is a record of the telegram exchange between Li Zhonggong, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:</p>
<p>Telegram from General Manager Li to Minister Wang in Nanjing: Minister Wang Rutang, my brother, Xunjian. The case of our bureau's land lease negotiation with Sandetang has been fully reported in Shanghai before. In addition to actively dealing with it, I have now heard that the French ambassador has arrived in Beijing. I urge you to report to him personally. If the hall does not realize its mistake, it should bear the responsibility for any unfortunate consequences. This matter concerns national sovereignty. I urge you to give your full assistance. I would be grateful for your reply. Brother Li Zhonggong, Yu.</p>
<p>Reply telegram from Foreign Minister Wang to General Manager Li: Commissioner Li Zhonggong, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, brother Xunjian. I have received your telegram.

<h3>Another Jiang'an Ship Incident Involving Gambling Bandits' Extortion and Assault</h3>
<p>Please Request Headquarters to Send Troops to Protect</p>
<p>Otherwise Passengers Will Take Foreign Ships</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun ship was previously killed by gambling bandits. The report was纪recorded by this newspaper. Now one thing has not been completed and another thing has happened. A disaster of disturbance and extortion by gambling bandits occurred in the Jiang'an ship of the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau. The situation heard is recorded in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Initiating a Quarrel by Asking for Food The previous Jiangshun ship gambling bandits initiated a quarrel by asking for food in Huangshi Port. The same is true for the Jiang'an incident this time. It was found that when the Jiang'an ship left Shanghai on the 25th and sailed upstream, the accounting office began to sell tickets. Suddenly, more than 30 gambling bandits in the ship, all wearing uniforms, rushed to the door of the accounting office and demanded lunch from the crew. The crew members, punished by the murder of the cook of the Jiangshun ship, comforted the bandits with kind words, saying that they would send the food as soon as it was cooked. The bandits refused and insisted on getting the food immediately. At that time, there were more than 100 armed comrades in the ship. The bandits used words to instigate them to cause trouble with the accounting office and others, and they were about to use force. Finally, one crew member was twisted and beaten by the bandits. Fortunately, the entire crew rose up to rescue him and save his life, but the bandits continued to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Accusing a Passenger of Drowning When the ship arrived in Jiangyin, another 30 to 40 accomplices of the bandits, all like retired soldiers, joined the bandit group and made things difficult for the crew. They claimed that a passenger had been pushed into the river by your crew and had drowned. This passenger had boarded the ship at the same time as them. The life was at stake and they demanded the crew to pay a huge sum for compensation. The situation was very tense. Operations Director Liu Jida and others stepped forward to resolve the matter and proved that no passenger had been pushed into the water and died. The bandits relied on their power to forcibly make unreasonable demands. The passengers on the entire ship were panicked and rose up to prove that this had not happened. The bandits had no excuse and planned another revenge.</p>
<p>Detaining the Ship for Negotiation When the ship arrived in Zhenjiang, some bandits reported to the Public Security Bureau that a homicide had occurred on the Jiang'an ship. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau urgently sent a large number of constables to the ship to investigate the case thoroughly. They immediately detained the Jiang'an ship and wanted to arrest the crew members to go to the bureau for questioning. The Operations Director came forward to state that no passenger had fallen into the water and that the incident was a false accusation by gambling bandits for extortion. After various negotiations and investigations, it was confirmed that there were no conclusive facts before the ship was released.</p>
<p>Requesting Military Protection Since the capital garrison headquarters transferred the garrison troops to Suzhou for training, dozens or hundreds of gambling bandits have often traveled up and down the Yangtze River ships, deceiving and extorting in every possible way, and often resorting to violence. Passengers regard Chinese merchant ships as a dangerous place and dare not take them. Recently, the passengers on British and Japanese river ships have been very crowded. The Chinese ships' business is declining. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company reported the Jiang'an ship's accident in detail to the headquarters, requesting that special service soldiers be sent to the ship for protection as soon as possible, otherwise it will be difficult to navigate.</p>

<h3>The Eligibility for Elections of Industrial and Commercial Groups in Shanghai County Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>Announcement Issued Yesterday to Avoid Errors</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai County election submitted the rosters of the Minhang Chamber of Commerce and the Minhang Aquatic and Timber Industry Association to the provincial supervisor for review, all election ballots and ballot boxes have been collected from the province by appointed personnel. It has been verified that only the Minhang Chamber of Commerce and the Minhang Aquatic and Timber Industry Association are the only two groups with electoral eligibility in Shanghai County. Therefore, the first phase of determining the eligibility for elections of industrial and commercial groups in Shanghai County can be said to be completed. The agricultural associations and educational groups for the second phase are still being organized. An announcement will be made once they are reviewed. Therefore, yesterday, County Supervisor Yan Shenyu specifically issued a public announcement for industrial and commercial groups, including the names of the election representatives, including Sun Ziqing, Liao Fengge, Chen Lujun, Wang Qiuting, Wang Zhuting, Zhu Yangsun, Qian Yaotang, Ni Chunxiang, and 178 others from the Minhang Chamber of Commerce; and Ma Dechu, Yu Zhenyuan, Xi Shouqi, Wang Shouhu, Yu Xingchun, Huang Shilin, and 95 others from the Minhang Aquatic and Timber Industry Association.

It should be announced immediately. If anyone believes there are errors or omissions after the announcement, they should submit evidence before April 2nd for referral to the General Supervisor of Elections for verification. Submissions beyond the deadline will not be referred. In addition to announcing the scheduled date for voting and elections separately, pay attention to any errors or omissions in the list of electors according to the reviewed roster and submit requests by the deadline without delay. This is specifically announced."</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Orders Rong Zongjing to Postpone the Takeover of the Sanxin Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>Employees of the Sanxin Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, which announced its sale, have demanded that post-employment arrangements be made first and have refused to hand over the mill. This has been unresolved for many days. Yesterday was the second time the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened the parties involved to attempt mediation. The old and new mill owners still did not attend. The labor representatives requested that the handover be postponed until the matter is resolved. The bureau agreed to their request and rescheduled the meeting for April 1st. The details obtained are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Convening Mediation - The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to handle the sale case of the Sanxin Cotton Mill. It was heard that on the 26th, the parties involved were convened for questioning, but the old and new mill owners did not attend. A public notice was issued, and the meeting was rescheduled for 1:00 PM on the 28th to question all parties involved in the case, including the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Third Special District, the new buyer Rong Zongjing, and the Sanxin mill owner Sheng Ze Cheng, and to attempt mediation. Tian Sanzi and others from the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Third Special District attended on time, but the old and new mill owners, Rong Zongjing and Sheng Ze Cheng, still did not attend. The case officer Xu Zhi instructed the labor representatives to return and await further processing.</p>
<p>Labor Representatives' Submission - The Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Third Special District submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "Regarding the report that the new buyer of the Sanxin Cotton Mill is using hooligans to undermine our labor union, we request your review. Since the sale of the Sanxin Mill, the old and new owners have not completed the handover, and our request to the mill owner for severance pay has not been resolved. The new owner has even bought off unscrupulous elements to incite workers to spread rumors in order to shake the will of our entire membership. The association members witnessed this and were extremely alarmed. In the event of unexpected events arising from this labor-management dispute, this association will not be responsible. Before the old mill owner resolves the post-employment issues for the workers, we beg your bureau to instruct the new mill owner to temporarily postpone the takeover and urgently stop all destructive acts. This is our earnest prayer."</p>
<p>Order to Rong Zongjing - Yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, the buyer of the machinery and factory buildings of the Sanxin Cotton Mill, stating: "Regarding the matter of complying with the order, in the case of your company purchasing the Sanxin Cotton Mill, you previously stated that you were willing to assist in resolving the labor dispute, so you were permitted to take over first. However, this bureau convened mediation, and the old and new mill owners repeatedly failed to attend, resulting in the case remaining unresolved. You are hereby ordered to comply with the order to postpone the takeover until the severance pay dispute for the mill's employees is resolved, to avoid inciting unexpected events."</p>
<p>Instructions to the Labor Union - Yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received a submission from the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Third Special District stating that the new buyer of the Sanxin Mill was using hooligans to undermine the union and requesting instructions to temporarily postpone the takeover. The bureau issued instructions to the labor union, stating: "The submission has been noted and approved to order a temporary postponement of the takeover. You are to be notified and await a resolution."</p>
<p>Notification to the Mill Owner - Yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau published a notice in the newspaper for Sheng Ze Cheng, the mill owner of the Sanxin Cotton Mill, and Sheng Yujun, the manager, stating: "Regarding the announcement, in this sale of the mill, you neither submitted a request beforehand nor dispatched representatives to attend the mediation convened by this bureau afterward, which is highly inappropriate. In addition to instructing Rong Zongjing, the buyer of the mill, to temporarily postpone the takeover, a meeting for mediation is scheduled for 1:00 PM on April 1st. Sheng Ze Cheng and Sheng Yujun, or a responsible representative appointed by them, are ordered to attend the bureau on time to listen to the mediation and not to violate this order again, to avoid inciting unexpected events. This is specifically announced."</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's Advice to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Opposing the Assessment of Police Rates Based on Estimated Rent</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement yesterday, stating: "Regarding the fact that our Chamber has recently received reports from various businesses stating that the police rates collected by your Council will be calculated based on estimated rent and implemented from January 1st of this year, requesting negotiations. Our Chamber believes that the purpose of this change in collection method by your Council is solely to expand your Council's financial income without regard to the sharp increase in the burden on citizens. This method is unfair and will also provide landlords with an excuse to increase rents. Therefore, this action by your Council will have two impacts: (1) It is tantamount to an invisible increase in the tax rate; (2) It is tantamount to inducing landlords to raise rents. At a time when the global market is depressed and this city is no exception, your Council's sudden action will increase the burden on citizens in two ways, which will inevitably arouse resentment among the majority of citizens in the Settlement towards your Council. This year, your Council has been striving to foster harmonious relations with the Chinese within the Settlement. If this action is implemented, it will be tantamount to abandoning years of effort in one fell swoop, which is regrettable. Therefore, our Chamber sincerely offers its advice and requests that this proposal be canceled and that police rates continue to be collected based on actual rent. This would be greatly appreciated."</p>
<h3>Shareholders' Meeting of the Shanghai Waterworks Company of the International Settlement</h3>
<p>Water Prices May Increase Significantly This Year After Revision</p>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company of the International Settlement held a shareholders' meeting at the company yesterday, reported the "North China Daily News." Chairman Liddell reported on the company's business performance last year, stating that the revenue from user accounts in the Settlement was taels 3,832,281.46, an increase of more than 390,000 taels compared to taels 2,434,725.93 in the previous year. However, expenses also increased from taels 1,077,365.34 to taels 1,320,984.19, an increase of approximately 240,000 taels. The net profit was taels 1,511,297.27, an increase of more than 150,000 taels compared to taels 1,357,360.69 in the previous year. The increase in expenses last year was primarily due to the sharp decline in silver prices and frequent fluctuations in exchange rates, and secondly, the amount of water supplied also increased. A total of 14,320 million gallons of water were supplied last year, compared to only 13,148 million gallons in the previous year. The increase in revenue was largely due to the surcharge approved by the Municipal Council. The net profit from user accounts in the Settlement last year was taels 1,065,002.16, an increase of more than 139,000 taels compared to taels 925,461.36 in the previous year. However, after paying the interim dividend of 3.125% in the fall, with an exchange rate of 1 shilling 6 pence, taels 484,677.09 was spent. The remaining net profit must be added to the dividend reserve fund to raise taels 960,209.90 to pay the final dividend for Class A shares at 5.85%, Class B shares at 3.875%, and Class C shares at 4.875%, with an exchange rate of 1 shilling 3 pence 875. The net profit from user accounts outside the Settlement and from ship users was taels 88,876.44 last year, compared to taels 121,605.64 in the previous year. Revenue also decreased from taels 346,538.79 to taels 331,713.06. Although the water consumption by ships increased significantly due to the water shortage in Hong Kong, the water consumption outside the Settlement decreased sharply due to the expiration of the water borrowing agreement with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, resulting in a decrease in revenue compared to previous years. It is proposed to distribute dividends this time at 2 shillings 8 pence for Class A shares and 1 shilling 6 pence for Class B shares. In terms of engineering, two large pumping machines, each with a capacity of 600,000 gallons per hour, were installed last year, as well as two large water inlet machines and a batch of rapid filters. A 40-inch main water pipe is currently being laid from the Yangshupu Pumping Station to the Jiangxi Road Water Tower, with a value of nearly £50,000. He then described the negotiations with the Chinese Association on the increased water surcharge and the payment of taxes in the fall and stated that the revised water prices this year, in accordance with the contract signed with the Municipal Council in 1928, may increase significantly compared to the old prices. This surcharge is only a precursor to the price increase, but the company's water prices, even including the surcharge, are not excessive and are lower than those in many cities and towns in England. The company has long advocated abolishing the system of charging based on rent and switching to a water meter system. Fortunately, the Municipal Council has expressed its agreement, so...</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The revised water prices submitted to the Municipal Council this year will be based on the water meter system. However, there are still many related issues that need to be resolved before implementation, so it cannot be realized in a short period of time. However, the company firmly believes that it is necessary to switch to a water meter system for the benefit of all users. Regarding the issue of supplying water to the area west of the Public Concession, the company is in negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. After the chairman's report, the various proposals were passed and new directors were elected, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Safety Bureau Will Periodically Inspect Foreigners' Entry Passports</h3>
<p>Cooperating with the Seaport Quarantine Office to Report and Implement</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the National Government promulgated the "Regulations on Inspecting Foreigners' Entry Passports" and its implementation details in August of last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs distributed them to consulates of various countries, who all agreed that this was a matter of international practice and had no objections. The Municipal Government received the decree from the Executive Yuan and instructed the Municipal Public Safety Bureau to comply. It is learned that the Municipal Public Safety Bureau has drafted a plan to implement it on May 1st. However, as this is a new initiative in our country, the chief and deputy directors of the Foreign Affairs Section, Hong and Chen, were dispatched yesterday to visit the Seaport Quarantine Office for consultations. Director Suo was out on business and could not be met. Later, Director Wu Liande sent Secretary Ni Mingshan and Medical Officer Bai Shien to meet with Director Chen of the Public Safety Bureau. Director Chen stated that as they are both government agencies, they should naturally cooperate and work together to expand national sovereignty. It is heard that the Public Safety Bureau will set up an office at Wusong Pier in the near future.</p>
<h3>Customs Procedures for Restricted Goods Transportation</h3>

<h3>Steps to Excavate the Shentan Shoal</h3>
<p>Starting with Surveying</p>
<p>The Dredging Bureau, based on the suggestions of shipping merchants and transportation merchants, requested that the Shentan Shoal (i.e., Hidden Sand) at the mouth of the Yangtze River be excavated to allow large ships from all countries to enter and exit without the need for time-consuming detours. The Bureau convened a meeting and decided to dredge the shoal. The Inspector General of Customs proposed that the cost of excavating the Shentan Shoal be covered by adding a dredging surcharge to import duties, and that 3% of the value be levied according to the new tariff, which was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implemented from April 1st. It has been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the Bureau's Chief Engineer, Chatley, is preparing for the excavation of the Shentan Shoal. As this is a major undertaking, it is necessary to conduct a detailed and final survey to determine whether the Hidden Sand is sedimentary and to prepare accordingly. It is heard that he has ordered the surveying section, led by Deputy Engineer Xia Ruifu, to go to the mouth of the Yangtze River to conduct a final and thorough survey.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is Reviewing the Organizational Outline of the International Trade Bureau</h3>
<p>The Claim That It Will Be Established on April 1st Is Inaccurate</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is Preparing for the International Trade Bureau - It was recently reported that the International Trade Bureau, which is being prepared, would be established on April 1st. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Guo Bingwen, who is in charge of the preparations, to inquire about the latest developments. According to him, after the Ministry of Industry and Commerce entrusted him (self-claimed) with the preparations, the draft organizational outline has been completed and submitted to the Ministry for review. The rumor that it will be established on April 1st is completely inaccurate. As for whether the Industry and Commerce Visitation Bureau will be merged into the Trade Bureau or whether the Trade Bureau will be reorganized from the Industry and Commerce Visitation Bureau, it is still under consideration and has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Tang Liu's Notification After Taking Office</h3>
<p>Visited Various Consulates Yesterday</p>
<p>Tang Liu, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent letters to the consuls of various countries in Shanghai and to the various local agencies yesterday after taking office. He also sent letters to all members of the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee, of which he is also the Director. Mr. Tang also visited the consuls and diplomats of various countries in Shanghai yesterday to strengthen ties.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Requesting Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>Insurance Industry - Recently, the Ministry of Finance revised the "Regulations on Business Tax in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai," stipulating that the insurance industry will be taxed at a rate of 20 per thousand, which will soon be submitted to the Central Political Conference and the ministries and departments for review and promulgation. The Shanghai Insurance Industry Association convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday at 2:30 PM, attended by more than 30 members, to discuss ways to request the central government to reduce or exempt business tax. Liu Shisun was elected as chairman and Hu Xiansi was elected as secretary. After the meeting, the members all agreed that the insurance industry is an undertaking that develops the national economy, and that the Chinese insurance industry has been repeatedly oppressed by foreign merchants, and its business is declining. It is now in its infancy and requires government protection and promotion to achieve development. However, it is now burdened with this tax, which it cannot afford. It was decided to appoint representatives to prepare documents to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Finance, and other ministries and departments. Li Shuxiong, Lu Yuequan, Liu Shisun, Guo Baming, Hu Yongqi, and Pan Xuean were elected as representatives to go to Beijing to petition. The representatives are currently preparing everything and will leave for Beijing in a few days.</p>
<p>Paint Industry - The Paint Industry Association believes that the implementation of business tax in this city has a significant impact on the burden on the various guilds in the paint industry. A general meeting of members was convened the day before yesterday at 3:00 PM. More than 40 letters from members of the carpentry guild were received on that afternoon, stating that the business tax stipulated in Jiangsu Province for paints and varnishes is 2 per thousand, while Western-style furniture and rosewood and sandalwood industries are still taxed at 10 per thousand. If this is passed and implemented, they will not be able to afford it, and their industries are on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition to requesting a reduction, there is no need to attend the meeting, etc. Therefore, a temporary executive committee meeting was held instead. Du Gengsheng was elected as chairman, and Min Xingchu was elected as secretary. Zhang Fukang, Zhou Shanqing, Ling Youqiao, and Chen Yougeng, and others jointly deliberated that the business tax stipulated in Jiangsu Province for rosewood and sandalwood industries was initially 20 per thousand. After the association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, it was approved for revision, and a 10 per thousand tax was proposed. However, from the import of raw materials to the production of furniture, rosewood and sandalwood go through four tax payment procedures. If business tax is levied again, it will be difficult to maintain a livelihood. Therefore, they requested that the gentlemen discuss this at length. It was decided to elect Du Gengsheng, Zhang Fukang, Ling Youqiao, and Zhou Shanqing as representatives to petition the relevant authorities and seek solutions. Next, Ma Yunxiang, Xu Guoqing, Wang Shengcai, Ma Zhigang, and others deliberated on revising the regulations of the various guilds. It was decided to schedule a meeting of members of the six guilds to discuss the matter. The meeting adjourned. The secretary drafted a memorial that evening, and the four representatives, Du Zhang Ling Zhou, went to the Shanghai South Municipal Government to petition yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. They were received by Mr. Chen Xilu, who, after hearing the representatives' statements, believed that the business tax on paints, varnishes, Western-style furniture, and rosewood and sandalwood had special characteristics and that it was necessary to request the government to consider the hardships of the merchants and transfer the petition to the various ministries and departments of the National Government for consideration of reduction or exemption to maintain their livelihoods. Mr. Chen accepted the petition and promised to report it to the mayor. The representatives felt satisfied with the purpose of the petition and took their leave. They then went to the Bureau of Finance, where they were received by Mr. Fang Zhongyan of the Bureau, and the result was also very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Cotton Weaving and Manufacturing Industry Should Be Exempt from Business Tax</h3>
<p>Conversation with a Leader in the Cotton Weaving Industry</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Zhu Qi, a leader in the cotton weaving industry, to ask for his opinion on the issue of whether the cotton weaving and manufacturing industry should pay business tax. According to him, Article 4 of the "Detailed Rules for the Collection of Unified Tax on Cotton Yarn" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance states that cotton yarn that has already paid the unified tax and the cotton cloth directly woven from this type of cotton yarn may be exempt from any other types of national, provincial, or local taxes in the interior. This means that all products manufactured by yarn factories and cotton weaving factories are exempt from any other types of national, provincial, or local taxes other than the unified tax. Furthermore, the term "any type" includes goods tax, business tax, and other types of taxes in the national, provincial, or local categories. According to Article 1 of the "Measures for Collecting Business Tax" in various provinces, those who have already paid special steady donations levied by the central government are exempt from paying business tax. It is heard that yarn factories are exempt from paying business tax based on the former regulations. The position of the various factories in the cotton weaving and manufacturing industry is the same as that of yarn factories and should be exempted from business tax. The unified tax paid on cotton yarn, a product of yarn factories, is actually borne by the cotton weaving and manufacturing industry. Yarn factories are only acting as collectors of taxes and enjoy the right to be exempt from paying business tax. Cotton weaving factories are the actual payers of the unified tax. If they cannot be exempted from paying business tax, it would not be fair in terms of reason and logic.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Held a Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai held a meeting of the Special Relief Committee yesterday (the 28th) at 4:00 PM regarding the silk industry public debt. The attendees included Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, Chu Huiseng, Qian Fenghao, Xue Shou, (Chen Pinsan's representative), Yang Yuchu, Zhang Zizhen, Cheng Bingruo, (Shan Youxian's representative), Zhang Yunsheng, Huang Jinjin, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinfan, (Zhang Yunsheng's representative), and more than a dozen others. The meeting was chaired by Shen Huachen and began with a ritual, followed by Chairman Shen's report on the purpose of the meeting and the reading of the original text of the telegram from the Ministry urging the issuance of public debt. The discussion then began on how to proceed. The members believed that the silkworm season in Zhejiang Province was the earliest. Farmers in Hangzhou and Shaoxing were preparing for silkworm farming. Qingming is the time for hatching seeds, and Guyu is the time for collecting ants, which is the usual practice for silkworm farming. However, farmers, considering the sluggish silk market last year and the failure of silk factories, were on the verge of bankruptcy. The silk merchants were asked whether they would collect cocoons as usual, and inquiries were made to the cocoon dealers in the various regions. In the past, silk merchants would contract with cocoon dealers during the winter to secure cocoon purchases for the following year. This year, during the Qingming Festival, no one had contracted to rent the cocoon dealerships in the various regions. The cocoon dealers were gathering in Shanghai to contact their counterparts to negotiate the rental of cocoon dealerships. The members believed that the sharp drop in silk prices last year had severely impacted their businesses, resulting in a loss of capital. The financial sector was unable to repay the advance payment for silkworm cocoons. This year, factories borrowing cocoons to start production are facing the difficulty of selling their products due to the current sluggish silk market and high prices. There is no definite date for the government's issuance of relief public debt. Silver and money lenders believe that the silk factory industry is still in arrears and will be unable to provide loans for cocoon purchases this year. Therefore, they are not sure whether they will be able to collect cocoons this year. They hope that the public debt will be issued as soon as possible so that the livelihoods of farmers, social finance, and foreign trade can be maintained. It was decided to send another telegram to the Ministry to urge them to issue the public debt. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Egg Product Freight Rates Approved to Temporarily Remain the Same</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Ministry of Railways yesterday stating that the request to allow all egg factories to charge egg yolk and egg white at the fourth-class rate until the reorganization of the grade levels has been discussed and a solution has been agreed upon has been approved. All routes have been instructed to charge egg yolk and egg white at the fourth-class rate. This letter is also to inform the egg factory industry association.</p>
<h3>Tea Industry Commission Increases</h3>
<p>Has Requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Notify the Bureau of Social Affairs for Record</p>
<p>Tea merchants and brokerage houses have always charged a commission of 4% for buying and selling tea on behalf of customers (i.e., deducting 4 yuan for every 100 yuan). This regulation is still the old rule from 30 years ago. With the increasing cost of living, many tea merchants and brokerage houses have been unable to maintain their businesses and have closed down. It is heard that the industry has decided to increase the commission by 2% in order to compensate, following the example of Zhejiang Province. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been requested to notify the Bureau of Social Affairs for record.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Two Farmers' Associations</h3>
<p>Commercial District: Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Gao Hang District Farmers' Association of this city held its inaugural meeting at the Chenghuang Temple in Gao Hang Town, Pudong.

The Naval Department has approved the appointment of Director Wu of the Hydrographic Office to supervise the institute at that time.

In addition to separate letters, this letter is sent to you for your information and to be forwarded to Yangtze River pilots and apprentice pilots to comply with the instructions and not delay. We hope for your cooperation.</p>
<h3>Changjiang Ship Crew Members Released from Songshan Road Police Station Yesterday</h3>
<p>Annamese Returned to Take Defence</p>
<p>The Remaining Negotiations Were Conducted In Shanghai</p>
<p>The crew members of the Changjiang, who were in distress, had been residing at the Songshan Road French Police Station for several days. Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, personnel from the French Consulate went to instruct the crew members to pack their luggage and transport it in a large car to the French Consulate near the Bund on Gongguan Road to await processing. The crew members complied with the instructions and boarded the car. However, the car drove directly to the China Merchants Wharf in Nanshi. The French mail ship, the "A Tad De Na," approached and forced them to board the ship. The Austrian crew members were in uproar and unanimously refused to board. Later, Li Zuyao, a representative of the Seamen's Union, arrived and negotiated. As a result, the Guangdong and Zhejiang crew members were allowed to stay in Shanghai. The Seamen's Union ordered them to temporarily reside at the stevedore club of Guangde Yi'an Company on West Wuchang Road. The Zhejiang crew members were provided with accommodation by the Shanghai Seamen's Branch to facilitate negotiations for compensation with the company. At around 10:00 AM, the Seamen's Union again sent Li Zuyao as a representative to the Shanghai Steamship Company on Renji Road to request food expenses for the crew members staying in Shanghai. The company refused, saying that they would cable Banier, the shipowner in Haiphong, for his opinion before proceeding.</p>
<h3>An Appeal for Disaster Prevention in Haizhou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association received a letter yesterday from Reverend Ming, a Western missionary of the Haizhou Presbyterian Church. The gist of the translation is that the area has always been known for its fertile land, but in recent years, the western and eastern districts have suffered from floods. Every harvest season, vast tracts of fertile land are submerged, causing repeated disasters and extreme hardship for the people. The root cause of the deep suffering is that the waterways are blocked, resulting in annual losses of life and property. For the fundamental purpose of disaster prevention, it is proposed to dredge the waterways and open new canals to allow accumulated water to flow from Haizhou, branch off to Shuyang, and enter the sea to discharge water and prevent future disasters. Three million yuan has already been raised, but one to two million yuan is still needed. They would like to request assistance from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. It is reported that all of the association's relief funds have been remitted to relieve the urgent needs in Shaanxi and are completely exhausted. They feel helpless in the face of this important disaster prevention plan. It is commendable that the missionary, as a foreigner, is doing his utmost to benefit the Chinese people and provide fundamental relief. It is hoped that benevolent individuals will provide assistance to complete this charitable endeavor.</p>

<h3>Constable Nie Dianrong</h3>
<p>Commendable Demise in the Line of Duty</p>
<p>Police Department Grants Compensation of One Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Funeral Scheduled for Tomorrow</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Detectives Will Attend</p>
<p>The owners of Wang Yu Tai Tea House, Wang Zhenshi and Zhenhuan brothers were kidnapped by bandits on the same day. Zhenhuan cleverly escaped from the bandits. Zhenshi was taken away. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. After Zhenhuan escaped, two bandits holding Mauser pistols fled, encountered a rickshaw, jumped on the rickshaw, and forced the rickshaw puller to flee towards South Chengdu Road. Constable Nie Dianrong, number 2124, and Patrolman, number 2844, pursued with their revolvers, but because of the distance, they could not catch up immediately. A car happened to pass by, and Constable Nie boarded the car and continued to pursue south along Tongfu Road to Lane 79 of Shengmu Yuan Road in the French Concession. When he was close to the bandits' rickshaw, Constable Nie got out of the car and fired four shots at the bandits. The bandits also returned fire with their Mauser pistols, hitting Constable Nie in the left chest. He fell to the ground. By the time Chinese Constable 2844 arrived, the bandits had disappeared. Examining Constable Nie, he was already dead. He immediately reported to the police station, and Detective Ruan Yao rushed to the scene and carried Constable Nie's body to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. After the bandits killed Constable Nie, they abandoned the rickshaw and continued to flee. When they reached Lane 103 of Beidichen Road, they entered House No. 4 of Zhengyuan Li, seeking refuge. The homeowner, Mrs. Chen He, firmly refused. The bandits then ran through the back door into House No. 9, but were also refused entry by the homeowner, Mrs. Zhang Li. The bandits had no choice but to retreat, abandoning the Mauser pistol in the gutter and fleeing empty-handed. Someone retrieved the abandoned gun and sent it to the French police station. Later, Detective Ruan went to Zhengyuan Li to investigate and found two rows of bullets outside the door of House No. 9. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo of the Special District Local Court went to the scene to examine the body. Detective Ruan recounted the circumstances of the pursuit and investigation. The two fleeing bandits were about five feet seven inches tall, with slightly elongated faces, and were wearing short clothes. Prosecutor Guo then instructed the deceased's wife to sign a statement and claim the body for burial. It is reported that Nie Dianrong was from Yanzhou, Shandong, only twenty-four years old, and lived with his wife at No. 603, Ma'an Li, Chongqing Road. They had two children, both only three or four years old. This time, he bravely pursued the bandits and was killed by them in the line of duty. The police department specially granted a cash compensation of one thousand yuan to support the bereaved family. The funeral will be held tomorrow (Monday). The police chief will issue an order to all Chinese and Western detectives in the police department to attend and offer condolences to show mourning and demonstrate exemplary conduct.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Who Colluded with Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Ding Jinfang Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday</p>
<p>Asked Someone to Send a Letter to His Parents to Ease Their Grief</p>
<p>Instructed His Wife to Take Good Care of Their Son and Accumulate Merit</p>
<p>Ding Jinfang (also known as Jinfeng and Afu), a native of Tongzhou, had been hired as a rickshaw puller by Zhou Zongzhi, a Cantonese employee of Hongyu Yarn Factory. On the morning of January 14th of the previous year, Zhou was kidnapped by bandits while riding in Ding's rickshaw from his residence at No. 567, Xin Dagu Road, to the factory. He was held in Ziyang Li, Wuding Road. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police cracked the case, rescued Zhou from the bandits' den, and arrested the kidnappers, including Liu Arong, who were duly punished according to the law. Later, it was discovered that Zhou's kidnapping was actually initiated by Ding, who colluded with the kidnappers to betray his employer for money. Ding was arrested and charged according to the law. On November 11th of the previous year, after investigation by the Special District Local Court, he was sentenced to death. The sentence was submitted to and approved by the higher authorities and executed as originally sentenced. Yesterday morning, the Special Court instructed the handling police station to bring Ding from the Western Prison. Judge Cheng Shangfeng took the bench and announced that the death penalty would be carried out. He then asked the prisoner if he had any last words. According to Ding, he was thirty years old, and his parents, wife, and children lived at No. 37, Lujiazhai, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. His father's name was Ding Longxian. He requested that a letter be sent to his parents to ease their grief and instructed his wife to take good care of their son and accumulate merit for him to be reborn in a better life. After speaking, he asked for wine and food to satisfy his hunger. Judge Cheng then ordered the bailiffs to purchase wine and dishes and grant his request. After he finished eating, he ordered the detectives to escort him onto the prison car and transport him to Caohejing execution ground. The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate was notified in advance to send a prosecutor to accompany the execution police to the scene to verify the identity before the execution police bound him and carried out the execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Ownership Issue of the Fuchang Tobacco Company</h3>
<p>Huizhong Bank has Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Accusing Fuchang's Manager and Huang Chu Jiu's Son</p>
<p>After Huang Chu Jiu's death, due to debt relationships, many of the businesses he operated were closed. The Fuchang Tobacco Company was one of them. The company owed the most debt, in addition to the Riyue Bank, owing more than 170,000 in goods to various tobacco leaf companies, resulting in all of Fuchang's factory assets being seized by creditors who applied to the Special District Local Court for impoundment. However, the American Huizhong Bank claimed that the entire property of Fuchang had already been mortgaged to them by its manager, Huang Chu Jiu, and that Huizhong had priority of disposition and that other parties could not interfere. Upon hearing that it had been seized by various creditors, they requested a lawyer to file an objection with the Special Court. The judge instructed that if there were any objections, a separate lawsuit should be filed. Huizhong has now complied with the court's order and filed a lawsuit against the manager of Fuchang, the son of the late Huang Chu Jiu, etc., for ownership. The hearing was scheduled for yesterday morning. When the judge in charge of the case heard other cases at the appointed time, and the statements of all parties in this case required a lot of time and could not be completed in a short time, the lawyers requested that another hearing date be set. The judge agreed and has now rescheduled the hearing to 9:00 AM on the 7th of next month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Public Buses Add Longhua Special Bus</h3>
<p>From April 1st to May 15th</p>
<p>The Longhua Temple in Shanghai West is said to have been built in the Jin Dynasty. Ascending the ancient pagoda and looking down, one can see people like ants and horses like beans. The breeze carries the sounds of chanting, making one feel refreshed. Every year when the willows turn green and the peach blossoms bloom, many men and women go there together. However, the round trip is dozens of miles, and transportation is not very convenient. The Shanghai South Public Bus Company has decided to add a special bus from April 1st to May 15th, in addition to the original Route 2 public bus, to facilitate spring outings for men and women. The special bus will run directly from the Old West Gate via Xiejiao to Longhua. Each person will be charged 48 copper coins to facilitate round trips for tourists.</p>
<h3>Xia Dexing Sand Ship Robbed</h3>
<p>Goods Worth a Total of Forty to Fifty Thousand Taels</p>
<p>Captain, Helmsman, and Others Kidnapped</p>
<p>Demand of Six Thousand Silver Dollars for Ransom</p>
<p>Three or Four Crew Members Injured</p>
<p>The Beiyang class sand ship Xia Dexing has always sailed to Yingkou, Dalian, and other ports, specializing in carrying passengers and goods. After the Niuzhuang River froze last winter, it sailed to Qingkou in Shandong Province. Recently, it received a telegram ordering the ship to sail to Niuzhuang because the river was about to thaw. Therefore, the ship loaded cloth, woolen cloth, and other goods worth forty to fifty thousand taels in Shanghai and set sail. Unexpectedly, it encountered several pirate ships in the waters off Haizhou. The pirate ships surrounded the merchant ship and robbed it. When the Xia ship saw this situation, it immediately turned the rudder to retreat. However, it was spotted by the pirates, who immediately opened fire on the Xia ship and chased after it. The pirate ships were smaller and faster, while the Xia ship was heavily loaded and larger, so it was slower. As a result, it was still caught. The pirates, wielding guns, swarmed onto the ship, extremely angry. They indiscriminately attacked people and rushed to the captain's, surnamed Ye, cabin to rob him. They robbed him of more than seven hundred silver dollars, but they were still not satisfied. They insisted on asking where more silver dollars were hidden and demanded that he hand them over immediately. Ye said that this was all he had and that there was no other place where he had hidden silver dollars. The pirates questioned why he had fled. Ye said that he did not know and that it was the helmsman's responsibility. The pirates then kidnapped the captain of the ship, Ye, to the pirate ship. Then they opened the cargo hold and robbed the goods, carrying away more than a hundred pieces of cloth. Before leaving, they kidnapped the helmsman and two crew members and said to the crew that if they wanted to redeem them, they had to prepare six thousand silver dollars within half a month and contact them at the same place. After speaking, they drove the pirate ship away in a hurry, heading towards the northern sea off Haizhou. After the pirates left, the Xia ship sailed to the port of Haizhou and anchored. Three or four crew members were severely injured by the pirates on board and were sent to the hospital for treatment. The ship's hull was also hit by more than a dozen bullets. Yesterday, the ship's accountant came to Shanghai to report to various cargo companies, requesting them to find a way to rescue the kidnapped captain and others. The various cargo companies have telegraphed the local government office to strictly suppress the pirates.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Healing</h3>
<p>Drinking Tea Before the Rain Can Activate Blood Circulation</p>
<p>Bowing to the Sky Can Exercise the Meridians</p>
<p>Recently, two people from Wuxi, Yang Jingan and Yin Xingquan, claiming to be able to cure diseases, have been in House No. 1, Hesheng Li, Wangjia Wharf, Nanshi. They hung a scroll in the middle with the two large characters "Sky" written on it, claiming that they could summon the heavenly generals to cast spells to exorcise disease demons. They muttered incessantly all day long, and rang bells and chimes, making Buddhist sounds that reverberated outside. They also had unemployed people praise their various skills in order to deceive patients and extort money from them. Soon, ignorant men and women believed them and flocked to them. As the news spread, the first precinct and first section of the jurisdiction found out and immediately sent police to arrest Yang and Yin and detain them in the station for preliminary interrogation. According to their confession, they were only treating people for their illnesses and did not charge any money, offering only complete voluntary assistance. They said that difficult and strange diseases arose purely from the patient's blood circulation not being smooth. Therefore, when patients came to the fairy altar they set up, they would first respectfully drink tea before the rain from the top to stimulate their blood circulation, and then make the patients kowtow to the sky to exercise the meridians. After that, they would have them rest quietly for a few minutes, and the illness would be cured immediately. There was no extortion involved. They were ordered to remain in custody for investigation, as they had been engaged in soliciting money under false pretenses for a long time in violation of the ban.</p>
<h3>The Mentally Confused Female Worker Regains Her Original Consciousness</h3>
<p>Zhou Jindi, a sixteen-year-old female worker from Changzhou at the Yufeng Yarn Factory on Pingliang Road, was previously lured and raped by someone and then abandoned in Zhabei. She was found, but her mind was extremely unclear. Later, the police arrested the suspects, Liu Beide and Xie Changhai, etc. Because the victim could not provide evidence, the defendants were detained, as reported previously. Now that Zhou Jindi has gradually regained her original consciousness, the defendants were again sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning for trial by Judge Xiao. According to Zhou Jindi, at 7:00 PM on January 30th, she was abducted by Xie Changhai and another person at the factory gate and forced to spend two nights. Although she did not want to, she could not resist. On the morning of the third day, Xie forced her to eat raw spinach, and from then on, she could not speak. She did not know Liu Depei at all.

<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Company's Route 4 bus, which runs between Xujiahui and Hongqiao Airport, has been losing money in recent years due to competition from British public buses, which have been selling tickets at reduced prices. The company recently applied to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to increase the fare on the entire line from 45 cents to 50 cents in order to maintain operations and to request that the British public buses be prohibited from operating on their route in order to uphold national sovereignty. The company received approval from the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday.</p>

<h3>Municipal Authorities Prohibit Fishing Boats and Cargo Ships from Docking at Shanghai South Wharves</h3>
<p>Order to Moor at Buoys Set Up by Customs</p>
<p>Many fishing boats and cargo ships dock at the Shanghai South Wharf, hindering the entry and exit of commercial ships. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, at the request of the shipping company, has previously conducted a survey with the Public Security Bureau to determine the mooring locations for fishing boats, etc., and consulted with the Jianghai Customs to add two buoys for mooring. The joint notice from the Public Utilities and Public Security Bureaus prohibiting fishing boats, etc., from docking at the wharves is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Notice of Joint Prohibition: The Shanghai South Municipal Wharves are all for commercial ships traveling to and from the coast, the Yangtze River, and inland rivers. The entry and exit are frequent. If other ships are allowed to stay arbitrarily in front of the wharves, it will greatly hinder the entry and exit of the commercial ships and cause many collisions. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau previously reported that there were often fishing boats, etc., staying in front of the wharves. The Jianghai Customs has long set up buoys in the Jiangnan River in Shanghai for cargo ships and fishing boats to moor. Now, two more buoys will be added in addition to the original buoys. All cargo ships and fishing boats should moor at the buoys and not stay arbitrarily in front of the wharves, hindering the entry and exit of commercial ships. This notice is hereby issued jointly. All cargo ships and fishing boats must be informed that if they stay arbitrarily in front of the wharves again, the Public Security Bureau will severely punish them and will not tolerate them. It is important to abide by this notice.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Issues Rules for Privately Owned Public Utility Vehicles</h3>
<p>Recently, various universities and other institutions in the city have increasingly owned privately owned public utility vehicles, and the consumption of gasoline and other items is very large. Some charge students, teachers, and staff for rides. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau believes that the sale of tickets along the way is close to business operations, which conflicts with the rights already obtained by commercial public bus companies, and that the structure of these vehicles carrying many passengers is also closely related to public safety. Therefore, it has drafted 13 rules for prohibition and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Rules for Prohibiting Privately Owned Public Utility Vehicles Charging Fees</p>
<p>Article 1: All institutions in the city that own privately owned public utility vehicles and charge fees shall be governed by these rules.</p>
<p>Article 2: Any institution that wishes to own such vehicles shall first specify the route and stopping points in writing and request a license from the Public Utilities Bureau.</p>
<p>Article 3: If the route of the vehicle is within the business scope of a commercially operated public bus company, the company should first be given the opportunity to operate the route. If the company is unwilling to do so, the vehicle-owning institution may operate the route, and both parties shall submit a joint report to the Public Utilities Bureau for record.</p>
<p>Article 4: The vehicle-owning institution shall submit the vehicle's chassis, body, and drawings to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval before it can be manufactured.</p>
<p>Article 5: After the vehicle has been inspected and approved by the Public Utilities Bureau, it shall pay taxes at the same rate as commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>Article 6: The passengers carried by the vehicle shall be limited to internal personnel of the institution.</p>
<p>Article 7: The amount of fees charged by the vehicle shall be determined within the scope of gasoline and other consumption expenses and reported to the Public Utilities Bureau in writing for record. It shall not be for profit.</p>
<p>Article 8: The fees charged by the vehicle shall be limited to the originally designated route.</p>
<p>Article 9: The fee collection method for the vehicle shall be to exchange for a ride pass within the institution. Tickets shall not be sold along the way or on the vehicle. The sample of the ride pass shall be submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau for record after it is determined.</p>
<p>Article 10: In addition to the provisions of this chapter, all other rules and regulations regarding private vehicles shall be followed.</p>
<p>Article 11: Anyone who violates any of the following articles shall be dealt with in accordance with the regulations, and the Public Utilities Bureau may revoke the vehicle's license at any time.</p>
<p>Article 12: These rules may be amended at any time if there are any omissions.</p>
<p>Article 13: These rules shall take effect from the date of promulgation by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Benevolent Mother Dormitory Starts Construction Immediately</h3>
<p>The Women and Children Education Institute affiliated with the Chinese Women's Temperance Association has been overcrowded in recent years due to the increasing number of people requesting relief, and the accommodation of the institute's staff has become more difficult. The construction of a suitable dormitory has long been planned by the association, but there was no way to start due to economic constraints. Recently, Dr. Li Peisheng donated several thousand yuan in memory of his wife, Mrs. Li Wang Shuji, Ms. Ma Shaoying, the daughter of the late Mrs. Ma Zuxing, and the daughter of the late Mrs. Liang He Yuxin in Beijing. The Charity Bureau has been given a free license by the director as a charitable organization, and the association's authorities have signed a contract with Xu Jinfu Construction Company and are now starting construction.</p>

<h3>Daughter Who Has Married is Having an Affair</h3>
<p>A'Xin, daughter of Zhou Huoxiang, a farmer residing in the Zhou Wang family compound in Hongqiao Township, Shanghai West, is a beautiful twenty-five-year-old woman with a modern bobbed hairstyle. Last autumn, she married Huo Sheng, daughter of Wang Xingquan from Xinqiao nearby, through a matchmaker. Initially, the couple's relationship was excellent, but later, disagreements arose due to minor family matters. A'Xin then returned to her mother's home. Soon after, she became romantically involved with a man named Xue and lived with him secretly in the Jing'an Temple Road area. The day before yesterday afternoon, Xue's friend, Xu Yulin, accompanied Zhou's daughter to a dowry shop on Hongqiao Road to purchase tables and chairs. They were spotted by Wang's relatives, who detained the man and woman. After mediation, Xu paid a ransom of forty yuan before being released. It is now reported that the Wang family has accused Xue in the District Court of enticing their child to elope, while the Xu family has reported Wang Xingquan to the relevant police station for allegedly colluding with hooligans to extort money under false pretenses.</p>

<h3>Case of Japanese Car Killing Ningbo Native</h3>
<p>Japanese Consulate Responds to Mayor Zhang</p>
<p>Chen Jinguan, a native of Ningbo, was struck and killed by car number 2343 while walking on Huade Road. The car is owned by Japanese merchant Morimura's car dealership, and the driver was a Japanese man named Yoshioka. Chen's family reported the incident through the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association, which requested the municipal government to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai. The Japanese Consulate General has now responded to Mayor Zhang, stating that the driver will only be detained for fifty days and that the car owner, Morimura, is willing to offer about fifty yuan to comfort the bereaved family. Mayor Zhang has already forwarded the letter to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association for their information.</p>
<h3>Truck Carrying Goods Collides With Utility Pole</h3>
<p>Avoiding a Child Prevents Fatality</p>
<p>Violent Collision Damages the Vehicle</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at around 4:00 PM, a truck with municipal license plate number 3605, carrying a large batch of approximately one hundred parcels from Zhenru, was traveling east on Zhongxing Road, in front of the Taiyuanfang area of Zhabei, heading to the General Post Office to send them to various provinces. Unexpectedly, at that location, Rong Sheng, an eight-year-old child of Zhu Zhoufa from Nantong, who lives nearby at 29 Fanli, and works pushing a cart at a soap factory, was playing in the road with a girl. The driver of the truck, Zhu Rongqing, also from Nantong, in an attempt to avoid the girl, turned the front of the truck south. Rong Sheng was knocked down by the mudguard of the truck and fell underneath it. Because the truck was overloaded, it had double wheels on the back. The child was caught between the wheels, but fortunately, pole number 84 on the side of the road stopped the truck from crashing violently into the cement base of the pole. The front of the truck was severely damaged, and the electrical wires were severed. The child was lucky to survive, suffering only minor facial injuries. Without the pole to stop it, the child would likely have died. Police officers arrived at the scene and took the driver and the injured child to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. It was discovered that the injured child had been in Shanghai for less than a month and was unaware of the dangers of traffic on the road. The damaged truck belongs to Jiuda Automobile Company on North Shaanxi Road and Avenue Edward VII in the British Concession and is contracted to transport mail for the Zhenru Post Office.</p>
<h3>Girl Run Over and Killed by Bus</h3>
<p>Yu Guixing, the nine-year-old daughter of Yu Pengfei, a local resident living at number 12 Fudeli, on the east side of Shafei Road and Songshan Road in the French Concession, was a student at Chongzhen Elementary School in Yudeli, Route Cardinal Foch. Yesterday, near noon, during lunchtime, Guixing and two male classmates left Yudeli to buy food across the street. The two boys were in front, and Guixing was behind. As they were crossing the road, a French-owned bus, number 820, traveling from east to west, passed by. The two boys in front managed to avoid it, but Guixing was unable to get out of the way and was struck, suffering injuries to her head, left cheek, chest, and back. She immediately lost consciousness. Police officers recorded the license plate number and transported the injured person and the bus to Renji Hospital. Due to the severity of her injuries, she died at 2:00 PM. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for examination.</p>
<h3>Fine for Car Dealerships Failing to Affix Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance established a special stamp duty office in the Shanghai Concession and strictly enforced the affixing of stamp duty, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Taxpayers Association, and other organizations have repeatedly issued notices and urged businesses to respect national taxes and comply with regulations. In cases where stamp duty is not affixed to invoices and account books, people are allowed to report the violations, and the courts will issue summons for punishment. Recently, Weihai Automobile Company on Weihaiwei Road and Jiujiang Automobile Company on Jiujiang Road have been found to have failed to affix stamp duty to their car licenses and business account books. On the 20th of this month, the court issued search warrants, and the office dispatched personnel along with detectives from the police station to search the premises. At Jiujiang Automobile Company, they discovered one account book without stamp duty, and at Weihai Automobile Company, they found two account books without stamp duty. This morning, Judge Tao of the court held a hearing and ordered Jiujiang Automobile Company to pay a fine of thirty yuan and Weihai Automobile Company to pay a fine of twenty-five yuan. He also instructed them to affix stamp duty to all documents in accordance with regulations in the future. The car dealerships paid the fines and complied with the court's instructions.</p>

<p>Five Gunshot Wounds to Waist, Ribs, and Chest</p>
<p>It was reported yesterday that Pang Gongyi, a former detective of the Third Water Police Team residing at 39 Zhongxingli, Hongzhen, was shot and killed. It has now been learned that the incident was a complete revenge killing, as the assailant only targeted the victim. The Fifth District Third Precinct has dispatched police to investigate the case and has also submitted a report to the Public Security Bureau to request the dispatch of detectives for the apprehension of the perpetrator. Yesterday, Xu Jinlin, the head of the 15th Tu of the 27th Bao, reported the incident to the District Court for examination. Prosecutor Yang and others were assigned to the scene and found five gunshot wounds to the waist, ribs, and chest. They determined that the death was caused by the injuries and filled out an autopsy report. During the inquiry, the victim's wife claimed that a total of ten shots were fired, with five hitting the victim. She said that two assailants each carrying a handgun committed the crime, and she requested justice. The official ordered the preparation of a coffin for burial and ordered that the murderer be captured and brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Zhu Ziqiao Telegrams About His Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Tianchu MSG Sold to Aid Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Relief Committee for Shaanxi Disaster Relief received a telegram from Zhu Ziqiao yesterday, stating that he had arrived in Ji'nan and was staying at the Jiaoji Hotel and would go to Tianjin in the evening. He will come to Shanghai after finishing his business there. The committee sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the National Government Relief Committee yesterday, stating that Mr. Zhu Ziqiao came to Shanghai from afar to solicit donations for Shaanxi disaster relief, which is particularly severe and short of funds. He has now raised 100 boxes of Tianchu MSG, which will be shipped to Shaanxi for sale to provide relief funds. The goods will be shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin by sea today and then transferred to Beijing, where Mr. Zhu Ziqiao will transfer them via the Pinghan and Longhai railways to Shaanxi. The committee requested that the National Government Relief Committee forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for the issuance of a tax-exempt passport from Shanghai to Shaanxi for inspection and release along the way. It also requested that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company be authorized to provide free shipping from Shanghai to Tianjin to save on transportation costs and reduce relief expenses.</p>
<h3>Appeal for Disaster Relief from Anhui</h3>
<p>Please Grant Relief Quickly</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross recently received a telegram from the Sixian Disaster Relief Committee of Anhui, stating that Sixian has been plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities in recent years. In the summer of the 17th year, the Yu bandits led by Li Laomo burned down dozens of wealthy shops in urban and rural areas, raping, killing, and looting, leaving ruins everywhere. Before the people could recover, they were hit by a severe drought in the 18th year, resulting in a complete failure of the wheat and autumn harvests. The people were starving and crying for food. Taking advantage of the situation, bandits gathered in the eastern part of the county, kidnapping, stealing cattle, and extorting money from the people. At the same time, the communists carried out brutal acts in the western mountains, killing, burning, and forming so-called Red Guards and assassination squads, sparing no one who resisted them. The southwestern half of the county became a terrifying place. For months, the people could neither live nor die. Fortunately, the National Army and local security forces worked hard to suppress the eastern bandits, and the western communists were also driven out. However, last December, the evil communists launched a full-scale invasion from the border of Hubei, numbering more than 20,000, and successively captured several towns, including Jinjiazhai, Liubo Village, Mabao, Dushan, and Subao, and marched straight to the city. The disaster area covered more than 200 miles, and less than 100,000 people fled to the city with their families, young and old. In the freezing weather, they were displaced, relying on nothing, exposed to the wind and rain, and suffering from starvation. They were on the verge of death. The local organizations urgently formed a disaster relief committee and set up refugee camps. They requested the provincial government to issue 3,000 yuan for emergency relief and raised donations locally to provide relief. However, this was only a drop in the bucket. Moreover, the communists were still entrenched in the western mountains, and it was unknown when they would be defeated. If relief is not provided quickly, the refugees, young and old, will fill the ditches and die. Furthermore, on February 15th, the soldiers of the 272nd Regiment of the Sixth Defense Army suddenly rebelled in Liucheng, and shops and residents throughout the city were looted. The impact was devastating and unprecedented. The Sixian region is under threat from bandits and communists, and even the central area is not safe. Thousands of merchants and residents have become destitute, heavily indebted, and unable to do business. The city is in decline, and the sight is heartbreaking. The undersigned appeal to all kind-hearted people to extend their compassion and provide grain and aid quickly. If you can help more, you can save more lives. The relief efforts will be remembered forever. We express our urgent plea with tears. Sincerely, The Sixian Disaster Relief Committee, Standing Committee Members: Weng Qianshui, Cui Yaohua, Chao Yangzhi, Shao Mengjue, Zhou Ziqian, Cheng Yicheng, Yang Shiru.</p>
<h3>Commissioner Guan Reviews the Daji Wheel Case</h3>
<p>Tax Commissioner May Responds to the Ship</p>
<p>Structure is Solid, Management is Appropriate</p>
<p>Regarding the fire on the Dada Company's Shanghai-Yangzhou route Daji Wheel on the 11th of this month near Longju Sand, Tongzhou, which resulted in the tragic deaths of more than two hundred crew members and passengers and the loss of cargo, the Ministry of Transportation telegraphed the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to investigate the cause of the fire, the number of casualties, and to instruct the company to quickly devise a plan for handling the aftermath. Commissioner Liu appointed Tang Naigen as a committee member to conduct a detailed investigation of the company and instructed Dada Company to quickly submit a report on how they will handle the casualties, compensation, and other matters. Commissioner Liu also sent a letter to Jianghai Customs Tax Commissioner May, instructing him to investigate whether the structure and management of the Daji Wheel were appropriate and to report back for further action. As time has passed, the Commissioner's office has urged Dada Company to submit a detailed report on how they will handle compensation. Yesterday, Dada Company manager Bao Chengpei sent a representative, Mr. Wang, to the Commissioner's office to meet with Secretary Xu and submit a report stating that all matters related to compensation and handling of the aftermath for the Daji Wheel will be handled in accordance with maritime law. However, most of the families of the victims are poor, and the company has already purchased coffins for the victims and is gradually providing compensation. Once this is completed, a report will be submitted. The Commissioner's office has reportedly submitted a report on the investigation to the Ministry of Transportation for review. Jianghai Customs Tax Commissioner May, after receiving the Commissioner's request to investigate whether the structure and management of the Daji Wheel were complete and appropriate, responded that the structure of the Daji Wheel was very solid and perfect, and the management was appropriate and did not violate the regulations of maritime navigation.</p>
<h3>Wu Wenhua Ordered to Thoroughly Investigate the Daji Wheel Tragedy</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department is paying close attention to the case of the Dada Company's Daji Wheel fire, which resulted in the deaths of three or four hundred passengers. The Shanghai-Yangzhou route operated by the company is essential for north-south transportation and passenger safety. This unprecedented tragedy indicates that the ship's management was negligent and lacked proper precautions. A thorough investigation is necessary. Therefore, Director Sun instructed Wu Wenhua, director of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau, yesterday to conduct a thorough investigation of the victims, Dada Company, and other relevant parties to provide a detailed report for review.</p>
<h3>Director Qin of the County Property Department Resigns</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai South Society, Qin Xitian, director of the Shanghai County Public Funds and Property Department, has served in his position for more than ten years. His achievements are outstanding. Since the establishment of the National Government, he has been reappointed twice. He has repeatedly requested to resign but has been retained. As his second term is expiring in June of this year, and according to the newly promulgated regulations, reappointment is not allowed more than twice, Director Qin has submitted another request to the county government for permission to resign. It is reported that the designated successor is Jiang Zhujun, the former head of Minhang Township. Shen Zhou, the deputy director of the department, will also resign at the same time.</p>
<h3>Sun Baoqi's Memorial Service Date</h3>

<h3>Edwards May Continue to Serve</h3>
<p>Decision Awaits April 1st Board Meeting</p>
<p>Edwards, the chief executive of the Municipal Council, previously filed a lawsuit against the council for compensation after being suspended from his duties. Although the lawsuit failed, Edwards' contract with the Municipal Council still had more than a year remaining. Edwards has been suspended for three months since the lawsuit was filed, during which time the council has continued to pay his annual salary of 12,000 taels. Reliable sources have reported that the Municipal Council will discuss Edwards' case at its board meeting on April 1st, and it may allow Edwards to continue serving until the end of his term. However, the Municipal Council has already decided at its last meeting to appoint Fessenden as chief executive from April 1st, so it is uncertain whether Edwards will be reinstated.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at the Guangdong Brothers Rubber Factory Resolved</h3>
<p>On February 5th, the Guangdong Brothers Rubber Factory on Weituoma Road announced changes to the employee leave system, which the workers opposed, leading to a labor dispute. The factory fired nine workers, including the leader, Bai Zongxi, and reported them to the police for arrest. The workers had no choice but to request assistance from the Social Affairs Bureau. After repeated mediation by the bureau, no results were achieved. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the fourth mediation was convened, with Liang Pinqing and Pang Ziqing representing the employer and Bai Zongxi and others representing the employees. After a long discussion led by Chairman Wang Bing, the representatives of both parties agreed to sign a three-article agreement: (1) The factory is allowed to dismiss the nine workers, including A'Lin. (2) The factory will pay each of the above workers 46 yuan. (3) The factory will immediately request the police to drop the case against Bai Zongxi and others.</p>
<h3>Taixing Sends Representatives to Shanghai for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Taixing was originally a wealthy area, but in the past three years, bandits and communists have risen up, and villages have been destroyed. Some families of dozens of people have been slaughtered, leaving only one or two survivors, and even those survivors have been killed. The stench of blood filled the air, and the ground was scorched. The total loss is estimated at more than 50 million yuan. Although the suppression has been completed, the vitality of the area has been greatly damaged. People have been displaced, and many have starved to death on the road. Recently, Dai Weifu and others from the Taixing County Disaster Relief Association came to Shanghai and have been begging for aid from all sides. It is reported that they have received the support of many philanthropists.</p>

Testing has shown that the ore is of high quality and suitable for manufacturing dry batteries, stoves, ink pencils, paint, and casting sand. At the beginning of this month, Dr. Shen Xiongqing, director of the Industrial Goods Testing Institute of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Hu Guoguang, director of the Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory of the Ministry of Transportation, visited the factory and praised it highly.</p>

Liu dispatched officers, including Lu Songxing, to patrol the area around the wharf. At around 1:00 AM yesterday, the officers spotted a man standing on the wharf, acting suspiciously. They approached him and searched him, finding a paper package containing twelve pieces of opium, weighing approximately 140 taels. They arrested the man and brought him back to the squad, then transferred him to the Nanshi General Squad. Chief Xu preliminarily questioned the man, who identified himself as Chang Ren, 28 years old, from Ganyu.

<h3>Ten Thousand People Commemorate Huanghuagang Today</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>The annual Huanghuagang commemoration is once again before our eyes. President Sun regarded the martyrs of this uprising as having great significance, saying, "This battle gathered the elite of revolutionary parties from various provinces to fight to the last with the Manchus. Although the event did not succeed, the heroic spirit of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang shook the world, and the domestic revolutionary situation was indeed created." In this battle, the blood flowed freely and the heroic spirit filled the air. The long-dormant hearts of the people across the country were greatly excited, and the accumulated resentment was like a torrent that could not be restrained. In less than half a year, the great revolution of Wuchang was successful, so the value of this battle is truly significant and great."</p>
<p>Huanghuagang was originally named Honghuagang. Initially, Pan Dawei collected and buried the bodies of the party members, not wanting to publicize it. Unexpectedly, the next day, the royalist newspaper Guoshi Bao first published an article with unfavorable words about Pan. Pan knew it was difficult to hide the truth, so he announced the whole story, with the headline "New Ghost Records Before the Consultative Bureau, Martyr Monument on Huanghuagang." The intention was to use the two characters "Honghua" (red flower) to indicate weakness, not knowing the vigorousness of "Huanghua" (yellow flower). The newspapers followed suit, and the name has become established ever since.</p>
<p>The most powerful recruiters for the Guangzhou Revolution on March 29th of the Xinhai year were Zhu Zhixin and Zou Haibin. Those who managed the cemetery were Lin Zichao (Sen) and Fang Yun Song (Shengtao). Among the 72 martyrs examined, the youngest was Yu Dongxiong, only 18 years old, and the oldest was Huang Bingzhong, 45 years old. Most of them were between 20 and 30 years old. In terms of provincial籍, Guangdong accounted for 41 people, Fujian 19, Guangxi 6, and Sichuan and Anhui 3 each. By county, Huaxian accounted for 18 people. By surname, the surname Xu accounted for 16 people.</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief of this battle was Zhao Sheng, and the deputy commander was Huang Xing. Both escaped to Hong Kong. In March of the first year of the Republic, Huang Keqiang wrote a eulogy for the Huanghuagang public memorial: "Seventy-two brave men fought fiercely in the spring clouds and soaked in azure blood; four hundred million countrymen sadly watch the autumn rain wet the yellow flowers." There is also a poem in the tune of "Butterflies Lingering Over Flowers" mourning Huanghuagang: "In the blink of an eye, the yellow flowers are blooming. I ask the west wind to temporarily cover the fragrance, waiting for the branches to be full of fresh dew and fragrance, blowing on the ruthless tomb. Looking back on Guangzhou in March, blood and flesh flew, and the spirit swallowed the fierce captives. Failure or success are originally rat-like, and heroes are silent underground." The matter belongs to personal experience and is expressed in poetic beauty. The words here cannot be created by those who merely search for chapters and sentences.</p>
<p>On March 14th of the twelfth year of the Republic, Yu Youren and Deng Yun, Zili, and others visited Huanghuagang and met Lin Zichao, writing a poem: "The sun is setting below Baiyun Mountain, sweeping the tomb and meeting you with added emotion. It is said that after the spring rain, plant yellow flowers on Huanghuagang." He also visited the tomb of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang with Zeng Mengming, writing a poem: "Below Huanghuagang, we step and wipe our handkerchiefs. It is difficult for those who die later to respectfully present the tombs of the former sages. We made the same oath in those years, and today we envy their success. Pick the seeds of cockscomb flowers and send them to the Minzhi campus" (picking cockscomb flower seeds to send to the Minzhi campus). I also wrote a eulogy for the Huanghuagang memorial, which is recorded below to express my grief. The eulogy reads: "Sacrificing blood to exchange for the republic, lightly risking life, throwing heads, and grieving that you generously sacrificed your lives. Tragically buried heroic bones by the city's edge, contemplating the yellow flowers and thinking of the former martyrs, preparing the heart and bowing respectfully. Ashamed of us who live in ease and have not died, we come to the hill to mourn the heroic souls." Being a member of the People's Party, I cannot continue the legacy of the martyrs, and I am grieved by the departed and ashamed of myself.</p>
<h3>Prelude to the Direct Flight of Eurasia Aviation</h3>
<p>— Wang Meiju</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, Mr. Sun Mutang, Secretary of the Board of Directors of Eurasia Aviation, invited me to the Hongqiao Airport to see the company's two new test flight aircraft, and to meet the company's gentlemen at the office on the third floor of No. 25 Renji Road. After being shown the articles of association, we had a pleasant conversation before parting. Nowadays, the aviation industry is expanding day by day. The company is a joint venture between the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the German Lufthansa. China accounts for two-thirds and Germany one-third of the capital. The organization is well-funded and well-organized. I will record what I saw and heard at the time of the visit, as well as what Mr. Sun has told me in the past one or two days, as a prelude to the direct flight of Eurasia Aviation.</p>
<p>▲ The enthusiasm for the visit: During the visit, Chinese and foreign people crowded the station. When the plane circled and took off, there was thunderous applause and the order was orderly. However, this was only the first of the test flights, only to Beijing Nanyuan. Mr. Sun said that the official inaugural flight will be at the beginning of next month, flying directly from Shanghai to Berlin. At that time, the visit will be even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>▲ The meticulous organization: The company has a general manager, a board of directors, and several secretaries. The office is divided into three groups: operations, finance, and aviation. The shares are under the jurisdiction of each group to serve. Externally, the stations along the aviation line are divided into first and second class, with directors and other staff. The number of Chinese staff is two-thirds and German staff one-third. There are no biases in obligations and rights.</p>
<p>▲ The novelty of the logo: The company's duty is aviation, flying ten thousand miles in the blue sky and white sun. The logo is a kite flying. Soaring into the unknown and being stable, it is taken as a sign. It can be said to be unique from the Chinese Airlines logo, which uses an eagle.</p>
<p>▲ The instructive nature of fame: Mr. Sun and I are close friends and have only recently met. He is rich in age, strong in talent, careful in mind, and once served as a Cuban consul. His footprints are all over the Atlantic and he is proficient in various languages. He also paints and can create thousands of hills and valleys on a small piece of paper. I was somewhat regretful that he is now working as the secretary of the Board of Directors. Mr. Sun said, "Yesterday I was a head of state, today I am a laborer. This is the true spirit of European democracy. Why should I be reluctant?" I was enlightened and respectfully recorded it.</p>
<p>▲ The remarkable results: Mr. Sun told me that the test flight on the 16th took 6 hours and 15 minutes to reach Beijing Nanyuan. The climate along the way changed a lot, but the machine parts were not affected in any way. The other two aircraft will also be completed within a few days. In the future, it will take at most four days to fly to Berlin, but before the restoration of Russian relations, it will take seven or eight days to connect by train midway.</p>
<h3>Jing Shan Photography Society Returns</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>My old friend Mr. Lang Jingshan is known for his photography skills, and everyone knows him. There seems to be no need for me to say more. What is described here is what I admire in my heart. When Jingshan was a child, he was diligent in this art. His works were always remarkable and were highly praised by his painting teachers. Because of this, he worked even harder, with a camera never leaving his side. What his eyes and mind touched was immediately captured by the lens and displayed on paper. His fame today is not without reason. Three years ago, he and Hu Boxiang, Zhang Zhenhou, and others formed the Hua Society and publicly exhibited the results of their research at the Shibao Museum. This has been done several times since then.</p>
<p>Recently, at the request of colleagues in the art world, Jing opened a photography studio at No. 1 Beisichuan Lane, North Sichuan Road, and attached a solo exhibition for art lovers to appreciate. I visited Jingshan last night and he happened to be meeting with Tan, discussing various arrangements with great interest. The furnishings were trending towards three-dimensional construction. The tables, chairs, lamps, and sofas all showed new ideas, weeding out old trends. The arrangement of the photography studio was even more artistic, and the beauty of the background and the harmony of the colors gave people a sense of beauty. Jingshan told me that this background is changed every day to avoid the drawbacks of dullness. These words are true. Compared with the photography studios on the market that stick to the old methods, there is no comparison. Even those who usually use art photography to attract customers are very different from Jingshan. Besides taking pictures, photography should also pay attention to the softness and hardness of the light, the selection and abandonment of composition, and the quality of retouching and developing. You must know that the creation of a single piece is not easy, how can the people of the market fully understand it? Looking at the works as a whole, there are no less than hundreds of pieces of portraits, landscapes, still lifes, etc., which have been almost completely collected. The light and composition are just right. Jingshan, in addition to clarifying the essence of the art, has also erected a unique banner. Later, I read the criticism manual and found that famous people such as Chu Minyi, Gan Naiguang, Xu Zhimo, Chen Xiaodie, and Huang Jingwan all had inscriptions, and their words were very pertinent. Jingshan asked me to write a comment, but I had nothing to say. I wrote "The two words 'divine and wonderful' are attributed to it, and I think it can describe Jingshan," and Jingshan smiled at this.</p>
<p>▲ Short News: The Shiyu Lianhuan Society has been established for more than a month. It is now scheduled to hold its first tea party at the society at 2 pm on Sunday, the 29th of this month. Famous people will be invited to give lectures, and visitors from all walks of life are welcome. (Gu Ziyan)</p>
<p>▲ Correction: In the annotatons on "A Painful Word from Huanglu" the previous day, in the eighth line, "suo suo" should be "ci suo" and in the tenth line, "xiu zhi" should be "fu zhi." We hereby correct it.</p>
<h3>Feeling and Gifting Butterfly After Watching the Opera Singer Red Peony Movie</h3>
<p>— Ye Zhongling</p>
<p>The beauty Butterfly is famous in the South, and her predecessor must be a palace skirt. Her beauty is subtle and without restraint. Her eyebrows are lightly painted like the third month, and the silver screen is lifted and her fame spreads. Flying to the sky, I wish for a bright star, writing the eternal hatred of Han Ping, and the illusionary soul also conveys the love of the Xie family. Who knows that the rouge on the Qin Terrace is re-transmitted, and the Phoenix's son can cry sadly and tightly. Flowers are suitable for thin lives, forgiving the east wind. People are like the setting sun, sad for the evening scenery. In the vast sky, I watch Red Peony. In the season when the red is bustling, I hold a colorful crown. The palace makeup is in Yanzhi Fortress, and the chivalrous bones are sour in the blue mud. The amorous guests are like butterflies fluttering in the wind. Ten dans of bright pearls cannot measure them. The pear garden has a younger brother, a crazy bee, secretly peeping at the jade slave's waist, which is one foot. Mother is afraid of the partridge flying south, advising her son to avoid the golden husband at all costs. She directly teaches the country to be without happy dreams, and even makes the love field a place of complaint. The absurd ten-string song is mistakenly sung, and the concubine's body has been transformed into a tree that shakes. Glimpses of the old jade pendant on her chest, and a mouthful of red clouds makes Etai fall. Her sick wings are difficult to fly, what can she do? The dance clothes are snatched and set off a storm, and there is no son to play with, only a spoiled daughter. Who else will pity the remaining grandmother? She has just left the medicine jar, and the sandalwood clappers cannot bear to fall, rolling down the slope. The people of Ba sing the songs of the Lower Village on a red carpet, and the gyrfalcons and soldiers all roll their eyes. After stopping singing and returning, she loses her palm pearl. A-Xiang cries out her little name. Once the call for chicks enters the market, the fire of the bird cage burns the ladder to call the crows. Iron shoes break through and search in vain, how can she bear Ju Bu's arrival? She is late to the stage with her phoenix hair combed, and her rhinoceros heart is shattered when she hears the drums in chaos. From then on, she endures hunger and cold, and she is also shocked that her husband is heavily tied. Killing people is no better than throwing fish into a net, selling daughters only to know they are entering a phoenix nest. She cries while pulling her clothes in the cave of bewilderment, and she is not allowed to redeem Wenji with empty hands. It is difficult to meet an old acquaintance with lowered eyebrows. Generously waving money to complete the bones and flesh, she examines the cloud clothes and goes to the sea mountain. She sheds tears when she meets her lover, and the soul is lost outside the railing, comforting her feelings. It is difficult to part with the past in front of the car, and ordinary tragedies exist in the world, making my intestines twist. I am willing to bow my head and this is the first sound of China. May you be the only one to walk after Jenny, regretting that the mandarin ducks are flying in opposite directions. Trying to listen from across the forest is not as good as returning home. The pink clothes are not necessarily frivolous, enduring to chase the willow catkins to other branches.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes in India (8)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Daojie Shi told me that there is a big problem, which is the Great Treasure Pagoda in Bodh Gaya. According to Dao Shi's estimation, the construction cost of this pagoda should be more than one million rupees. There is a stone tablet in it with Chinese characters recording that Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty built it for his father, Emperor Taizong, at the decree of the Empress Dowager. The person in charge was a monk, and it took three years to complete. Dao Shi had taken 100 rubbings of the inscription for examination. If so, it would be a great feat for China to have such a grand building in the Western Regions in the pre-communication era, which would be enough to show the development of our nation's overseas undertakings and not be unworthy of being the Emperor of China. However, Master Wanhui doubts that this pagoda was not built by the Chinese, but that the pagoda built by the Chinese is the small pagoda next to the big pagoda. However, if it is a small pagoda, it would take three years to build. Considering the time spent, it is undoubtedly a large pagoda. Master Wanhui suspects that the pagoda was built by King Ashoka, but Dao Shi refuted that King Ashoka was only about 200 years after the Buddha's time. This pagoda is in the Bodhi Field and next to the Bodhi tree. Since the Tang Dynasty, famous Chinese monks who traveled to the Western Regions, such as Xuanzang's Records of the Western Regions, Yijing's Dharma Returning Biography, and Faxian's Records of Buddhist Countries, have recorded the events of the Bodhi Field in detail, with every grass and tree being as detailed as it can be verified today. How could there be such a grand pagoda that has not been mentioned at all? It can be known that there was no such building at that time, and it can be known that this pagoda was built in the Song Dynasty, so tourists before the Tang Dynasty could not see it and record it. I told Dao Shi that a full photo of this pagoda and the Chinese inscription must be taken, and then the inscription must be printed and photographed to be kept on file at the Chinese Consulate, so that a case can be established for future negotiations. This is a major public case of the Chinese overseas development of cultural undertakings. I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to it. I remember that Europeans fought for a piece of Columbus's stone for a long time without a decision. In the end, the Americans bought it for 500,000 yuan and took it to the United States, which was a great joke. Another example is the hometown of the ancient poet Aesop. People from all over the world are vying for it. Today, it is said that there are three places that claim to be the birthplace of Aesop. Culture is the crown of the nation and is also an interesting contention. How much more so is this great building? I will考焉.</p>
<p>I discussed with Dao Shi the relationship between cultural dissemination and assimilation. The old culture of India is extremely solid, so the Buddha could not change it with softening and transmitted it to Ceylon in the south and spread it to the small countries of Nanyang, Myanmar, Siam, and Annam. Once they encountered Buddhism, they became purely Buddhist countries. In China, there is the old culture of Confucius and Lao Tzu, which can only be harmonized and not swallowed. To the east, to Korea and Japan, Buddhism is more prosperous than Confucianism. Even to Mongolia and Tibet, it is swallowed up and gone. This proves that the culture of small countries is low and the culture of the Chinese nation is complex, and it cannot be conquered by a single method. Great is the culture of China. The culture of China is harmonious with all religions, which is more harmonious and beautiful than the simplicity of small nations.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Ends with Softening</h3>
<p>Decline of Seven Taels and Three Mace</p>
<p>Xiu Erfu: The situation yesterday, March 28th, was like a dream. The gold price was volatile, sometimes at 5 or 6 taels. It was difficult to guess the direction of the people's hearts. In the end, it fell by more than 7 taels. In fact, the long and short positions were facing back to back. The improvement of foreign exchange was the main reason. The prices remained unchanged, and there were various transactions on the table. Hengxingshengda was still a fierce seller, and Chenfeng Yongshunli Wanxing and others were buyers. Overseas silver markets reported slight declines, so the gold price opened high, once rising to more than 707 taels. Afterwards, it became a volatile situation. At noon, the exchange rate tended to be loose, especially with the Cantonese helping, and the selling intention was strong. The atmosphere was not good, and it turned sharply downwards. Suddenly, it had already broken the 700 tael mark, and there was almost a collapse. In the end, it was exhausted at 692 taels. This morning, the big names seemed to have a rebound trend. In the afternoon, as it was Saturday, it was closed as usual. The market situation this week was extremely volatile. The highest price was 711 taels and 5 mace, and the lowest price was 674 taels and 5 mace, a difference of 37 taels. Compared to the previous Saturday, it still fell by 2 taels.</p>
<p>The collapse came after the volatile situation: As soon as the May opening started in the morning, it increased by 2 taels and 5 mace to 704 taels. The silver price fell by 3/8, and the private telegram also fell by 3/16. Buyers were active, such as Yuancheng Yongda Decheng Shunli Wanxing, etc. They all came in, and British gold was also strong. May paid a settlement of 136,875. Also, the Dalian ticket Mitsui initially absorbed 1 tael and 5 mace, 4 fen and 6 li and 2.5 hao, and then 1 tael and 5 mace and 5 li, so it rose again to 707 taels.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Domestic Market Declines Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported lower prices. The market's average British and American exchange rates rose, while the American exchange rate saw a drop in British exchange. As for the HSBC posted prices, there were no changes. However, the domestic market changed from tight to deficient, which was the trend of the gold market's morning rise and afternoon weakness. It fell from 707 taels to 695 taels, with a difference of more than 14 taels in half a day. As a result of the review, the British gold was 12.5 longer, the American gold was 2.5, and the Japanese gold was reduced by 1.25 compared to the previous day, which was a sign of a decline in the market. The transactions of Chinese merchants were not quiet, and the demand for gold was very different. The British gold成交量 was more than 200,000 pounds, and Fuchang and Shengda all cleared their positions, while Yanfengyong and Xinhang sold. In total, the demand of each firm exceeded its supply, which was to make up for the previous inquiries, which was to engage in套做条子. Banks such as Shanghai, Hefeng, Huabi, Anyuan, Maixing, Citibank, and Zhengjin all sold, while Yulimai and Sumitomo absorbed a little. Mutual transactions between various banks amounted to about tens of thousands of pounds. Also, 200,000 yuan of American gold was traded against 200,000 yuan in the gold industry. Almost all of the Dalian幫 sold more than 1 million yuan of Dalian tickets. Mitsui, Taiwan, Huabi, and Mitsubishi absorbed them. There was no market in the afternoon because it was Saturday.</p>

<h3>Concerns About the Decline of Foreign Small Coins (Yang Cents)</h3>
<p>Market Overview: In recent weeks, the trend of foreign small coins has been gradually increasing, reaching a peak of 5 cents in the midday market the day before yesterday. The situation has been quite brisk. According to industry insiders, customer demand is still strong, and the local market is preparing for the upcoming settlement of securities this month and large-scale remittances of principal and interest. Therefore, considering the overall trend, there seems to be no weakening within the month, and further increases are possible.

The Guangdong small foreign coins decreased by 2 hao and a half compared to the previous midday, reaching 6 yuan, 3 fen, and 0.025 hao. The morning and midday markets were also the same, with transactions of 150,000 jiao in the morning market and 70,000 jiao in the midday market. Copper coins increased by another 1,000 wen, reaching 368,500 wen.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Market Decline After Yarn Marking</h3>
<p>The yarn market was stable in the morning and declined in the afternoon. However, the prices of overseas third-grade yarns were still good. Most local retailers reduced their sales due to actual sales being less favorable. With sufficient deliveries in March, they believed the upward trend was weak, so they unanimously sold off large quantities. Although there were large buyers, the overwhelming trend made it difficult to support, and the market fell by 2.3 to 4 yuan. However, a certain major merchant's intentions remained strong and did not relax at all, continuing to purchase and increase holdings. However, Japanese Lotus brand yarn continued to arrive, leading to shortages of most Japanese yarns. As for local yarn, the inventory was slightly high, but with many new sellers at a price of 70 yuan, the market price fluctuated and declined. Future movements will still depend on exchange rates and actual demand.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn Was Stable in the Morning and Lower in the Afternoon: The People's Standard Yarn market opened flat in the morning. The market was slightly looser in the second and third sessions, with each month falling by 1.4 yuan. In the afternoon, as gold prices declined and actual sales slightly cleared, the market suddenly fell, and the selling pressure increased, with each falling by 2.1 to 3.4 to 5 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,200 bales. Rongxing sold 1,700 bales, Gu Da sold 1,350 bales, and Changfeng sold 2,100 bales. Yichang bought 1,150 bales, Yiyu bought 1,450 bales, Xiesheng bought 1,250 bales, Xincheng bought 650 bales, and Taixing bought 650 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Cotton Market Declined from High Levels</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. However, the overseas cotton market remained flat, and exchange rates remained strong. People still intended to increase holdings, and the pulling force was strong, unwilling to relax. New sellers were still lacking. However, as the yarn market declined, the cotton market also declined.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Was Pulled Down by the Yarn Market: The Hankou Standard market was flat in the morning, with the exception of overseas cotton. Empty positions were also weak, and each month rose by 2-3 yuan. In the afternoon, as the yarn market fell sharply, the cotton market followed, falling by 4.5 to 6 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 54,800 dan. Ruida sold 6,200 dan, Shenji sold 2,100 dan, Tongxing sold 2,700 dan, Tianlong sold 1,200 dan, and Changji sold 2,500 dan.

<h3>Doubts Still Exist About the Reduction of American Cotton Fields</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 27th reports on the cotton market for the week: The Agricultural Administration has abandoned maintaining new wheat. Although its future policy on cotton has not been determined, the hearts of people in the exchange are uneasy. The old bulls are carrying out large-scale settlements. However, their supply during the price decline is absorbed by domestic and foreign peers. The South sells very little. The real position has improved due to the settlement of bulls. However, speculators are limited in purchasing because the statistics are favorable to shorts and there are still doubts about the reduction of cotton fields. There are also several places where cotton field work has been delayed due to rain, but the soil has benefited. According to official sources, the policy of the Agricultural Administration will not be expressed until the new cotton has considerable certainty.

<h3>Grain: The Decline in the Rice Market Intensifies</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, No. 40 rice from Hexia was seen, and the market was more stagnant. Baishan rice was even softer due to few people inquiring. Top-grade rice fell to 12 yuan and 8 jiao, and large plates also fell by 2-3 jiao. Thin rice arrived sparsely, and the faint-hearted were discouraged. Step rice was down by a small jiao and half. Sheep Xian rice had little stock in Shanghai, but the road to disposal was also quiet, so it followed down by a small jiao. Dufu pointed rice was extremely stagnant. Retail was also dim. After the decline in the Japonica rice market, buyers mostly chose medium and second-grade Japonica rice, so the rice continued to short a jiao. Baiyuan rice transactions were not prosperous, and the ups and downs were minimal.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, various gangs arrived with about No. 30 rice. The sales of rice in the market were unusually slow. The appetite for Xilu Beilu and other machine-polished Japonica rice was stagnant, and the transactions were quiet. The market fell by about 2 jiao. The supply of early rice in the South Road was continuous, but sales were not prosperous. The price followed the overall trend and was tired by a jiao and a half. Sheep Dufu Xian rice arrival and sales were both light. The market situation was still weak, and the price surface went down by a jiao or so. Bianyuan rice arrival and stock were both sparse, and hoisting sales were stagnant, seeing a shortage of nearly one foot.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Is Weak and Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed a state of hovering. At the beginning of this month, it was still flat, followed by one fall after another. Actual sales were still smooth in terms of temporary buying for sales purposes, so the market atmosphere was slightly firmer. Although the remote Ming Dynasty months once showed a firm and brisk image in the morning, most bulls, in view of the current good flour sales, were still unable to maintain it. Later, as soon as the spot goods accumulated, they were deeply afraid of the increased squeeze in the future, so they gradually returned, which led to the market atmosphere becoming weak and depressed again. As a result, this month was up by 5 li compared to the previous day, April and May were down by a small 2 li and a half, June was down by a small 5 li, and July and August were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Near Up, Far Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market generally showed a state of ups and downs. The overseas wheat quotation was slightly better, and the hearts of people outside the industry were slightly better. The market atmosphere for the next month was slightly better because the end of March was good, and in view of the identity relationship of overseas wheat, the market atmosphere was associated with April, so the market atmosphere was slightly better in the midst of hovering. The distant period was still in a bad environment, and Citibank wheat was still available for sale between 4 taels, and the official was reluctant to sell for a small number of dollars, and refused to sell unless it was a huge amount. In this situation, the future is really hard to say. As a result, April and May were up by 2 fen compared to the previous day, June was unchanged, July was down by a small 2 fen, and August was down by a small 1 fen.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Longan Meat Market Trend Weak</h3>
<p>Longan meat has been slow to sell lately because there is not much stock and because various gangs are also selling it very slowly. As a result, the market trend has gradually become weak. The opening price of top and middle grade goods has not been above 40 taels recently, and the opening price of ordinary goods is 30 taels. Each store is unwilling to continue to loosen the top dried longan meat, because they are short of stock, which has decreased by 1-2 taels compared to the previous one. The lower grade goods are not above 28 taels, but the market plate is quite accommodating because the market is not smooth. It is difficult to turn around for the time being.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Market Atmosphere Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>This Factory Market: Yesterday, actual sales were greatly increased, and Tianjin gangs were searching for fine cloth very fiercely. Yesterday, transactions reached more than 500 pieces. The destination of dyeing embryos in this street was also unusually abundant, resulting in a large shortage of supply. Trumpet Italy, Colored Ball, and Blue Chicken, etc., continued to rise by about 1 qian. Blue Flying Fish rose by 5 fen, and Yanghe rose by 7 fen and a half. The trend of fine twill was more stagnant, but it also rose. Yanghe and Blue Two Fish both rose by 5 fen. Spot coarse cloth was in short supply. Since Sanshin stopped weaving, all of the double horse, horse dog, four horse, and grass cow brands have been sold out. The Shenshin brands were also in short supply due to the large demand from customer gangs. The trend of coarse twill was stable.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods: Sales were more active. Yesterday, Tianjin gangs needed East Goods very much. Because the Three Products rose sharply and the Osaka price was rising day by day, they rushed to search for them in Shanghai. Yesterday, Wild Goose Tribute Cloth was sold the most, and more than 100 pieces were installed, and the price was 3 qian and 5 fen and a half. Mogan Mountain followed and rose to 3 qian and 5 fen. Fine cloth was more sturdy, and Shuangyi Pearl was sold for 7 taels, 8 qian, and 7 fen and a half. Only Shiratori 9 taels and Moon Goose 9 taels and 7 qian and a half were sold, and Standard Cloth gradually rose. However, the price of calico was too high and slightly fell. Fine Serge was still stable, and white crepe cloth has been launched one after another. Ren Dog was 4 taels and 2 qian, and Mogan Mountain was 4 taels and 1 qian. There was a slight move in this street. Western Goods bleached cloth was firm, and interwoven foreign yarn returned to 3 qian, 8-9 fen.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Morocco Has a Large Stock of Tea</h3>
<p>Morocco is the largest market for green tea in our country. In recent years, Zhenmei, Pearl Tea, Needle Eyebrow, and Xiumei have been shipped to the area by British and French merchants. Therefore, the prosperity or stagnation of the tea market there is closely related to the sales of green tea in our country. It is now known that although the green tea market in Morocco is slightly more active than last year, the tea price is quite low and tea merchants are not profitable. At present, there are still 75,000 boxes of various kinds of Zhenmei Pearl Tea in stock, and no less than 100,000 boxes including those not yet shipped from Shanghai. This year's new tea will be launched in a blink of an eye, but the sales overseas are not prosperous, and the stock is abundant. The future is difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Hardware: The Weakness of Plain White Iron Is Exposed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's hardware transactions were sporadic, and few were heading to the genuine wholesalers. As a result, the market was even more lively. Since the price of French Western nails fell, the outlet was still smooth. For example, the Yangtze River inland and Fujian gangs all had transactions, and the market was still estimated at 9 taels and 2 qian and a half. Because there were fewer and fewer goods in the English tinplate market, buyers were more prosperous, so the trend was quite optimistic. Tin Qing lead was idle and scattered due to sluggish outlet, and the market was leisurely. Although there were many buyers of plain white iron yesterday, the weakness of the market was exposed. The market was full of stock, and the overseas price also fell again. People's hearts were afraid and they were manipulated by buyers. The market price fell as much as two taels. It is estimated that No. 31 American goods only cost 20 taels and 07 qian and a half, No. 28 cost eleven taels and three qian, No. 26 cost 20 taels and 05 qian, and No. 24 cost 19 taels and 5 qian. As for the English goods, No. 31 has not changed. As for No. 28 to No. 24, they have not fallen by as much as 7-8 qian. It is estimated that No. 28 sells for 17 taels and 5 qian, No. 26 sells for 16 taels and 7 qian and a half, and No. 24 sells for 16 taels. As for the transactions, such as construction gangs and customer gangs, there are only sporadic ones. There are still few large transactions. Yesterday, new lead wire was only estimated at 13 taels and 7 qian and a half, which was another 2 qian and a half cheaper than before, and the transaction was very quiet. Yesterday, there were purchases and sales of English steel plates in thick colors, but thin colors were lacking in demand. The price of 2 li and a half was 9 taels, 5 li was 7 taels, 7 li and a half was 6 taels and 7 qian and a half, and 1 cent was 6 taels and 5 qian. Thick colors were 6 taels and 2 qian and a half. In addition, white lead skin and green iron wire cloth were slightly decorated on the market yesterday, but the market had no momentum.</p>
