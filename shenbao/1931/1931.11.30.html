<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c13">銀根緊急與國人之責任 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>本市以連日大批現銀出口。據估計近八百萬元之多。因之銀根奇緊。市塲頓呈恐慌現象。社會亦頓感不安。日來市府討論。銀錢業會商。金融界集議。都認爲自天津變亂發生人心騷動。市民多存儲現金。外商銀行亦多吸收現洋。故銀根之緊急。最大原因爲由於時局之影響。果誠如此一推斷。則吾人不得不認爲我國人迄至今日。猶未能體認國家之危難。猶未能體認其本身對於國家所應負之責任。換言之。即尙未能明白體認其本身與國家究有若何密切不可分離之關係。</p>
<p>國家目前内困洪水。外迫强敵。存亡之機。已不絕如縷。此正負責之國民。有力者盡力。有財者輸財。以共赴國難之時此時。惟有國家之利害。民族之利害。至個人則應抱絕對犧牲之精神。以打破國難。亦惟能打破國難。而後能解决個人之艱難能維護民族之利益。而後可以獲得個人之利益。蓋國者載民之舟舟沉則舟人皆溺。國亡則國人皆奴。此理至明。退一步言。社會爲一整個之組織。各個社會層都休戚相關絕不容分離此一部分人榮枯休戚在直接或間接之關係上。即爲整個社會之榮枯休戚。故徒求一已之休而忽視全社會之戚。亦爲事實所絕不容有。</p>
<p>今日以時局緊張之故。紛提存儲現金。成以大批現金存儲外商銀行者。吾人推斷其心理不謂我如能存欵於外商銀行。即國内持久騷亂。我不至受若何恐慌乎。不謂即使國家破滅民族淪亡。我尙不失爲一寄人籬下之富翁乎。吁即此一念。已誠足使我國家破滅民族淪亡而有餘。如有人存此念。則不得不自承爲心已死。血已凝生之活力已耗失。尤不能不自承爲本身甘作亡國之奴隷而無悔。</p>
<p>以銀根之緊急。勢必使我市塲呈現日益擴大之恐慌。復以市塲之恐慌。更必至影響及於對日之經濟絕交運動故此中實不僅由於時局之影響。實更有日人擾亂我市場。牽掣我經濟絕交運動之陰謀從中作祟。吾人應明燭此一陰謀而防遏此一陰謀之實現。其唯一之武器。則在於國人每個人之愛國熱血。</p>
<p>國難當前。打破國難。責在國人吾人個人爲民族之細胞。而民族即吾人個人所寄託。有民族而後有個人。皮存則毛附。亡國之民。其生命且操諸人手。更何有於身外之財帛。縱觀世界。不乏前轍。此點我國人應須先行覺悟</p>
<p>國難正殷。市塲固絕不容有若何之紛擾。即小之如時届冬令。亦不容使市塲蒙受此打擊。而倍呈蕭寥。以增多冬令禍變之危機。故國人對此一問題。應都重視。尤應發揮愛國之熱忱。以防遏此一危機。此後如尙有人不惜自棄於國人。再以大批現欵存儲外商銀行者。即輿袁金鎧熙洽輩之公然賣國。無以稍異我金融界應予以嚴密之監視。我全國人應共起而予以有效之制裁。</p>
<h3 id="c14">日本撤退攻錦兵 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>日本此次忽然撤退進攻錦州之軍隊。原因不外二端。一爲日本明知中國方面。不有撤兵之舉動决不肯承認。國聯之决議案。故先進一步大張聲勢。以進攻錦州。加重武力壓迫。威脅我國民使益起極大恐慌。然後退而停止錦州之攻擊。以安慰中國人之心。敷衍中國要求撤兵之面目。使中國可藉此下台。接受國聯組織調查團之决議案。此爲愚弄中國之一策也。一爲國聯近日急欲成就其决議案。使和平之假面具不破。正盡力勸誘中國接受若日本在錦州方面再進行攻擊。未免益令中國難議。去接受之機會愈遠。故美英法各國。一致力遏日本攻錦之行動。日本恐持之過堅。激起各强反響放在此互相諒解之下。容納國聯意見。此又爲敷衍國聯之一策也。</p>
<p>蓋日本今日之用意着重在爭國聯决議案之勝利。力求於議决案中先佔足活動地步。於撤兵則堅持不定限期於調查則不許干涉其軍事行動。於中立區則堅持保留日僑如遇危險日軍仍得開入之要求。如此種種條件而得償其願。則此後非特直接交涉。可以事事如意。即在軍事行動。亦可隨時地。自由行動。欲攻錦州。則攻錦州更有何物可以拘束。更何必急急於今日故此新决議案。日人必力求速成。欲求速成。不妨即以撤攻錦兵。爲欲擒姑縱之計。一方則又在天津。極力騷擾。使擴大東北之軍事範圍爲華北軍事範圍。以加重將來直接交涉之壓迫。日人之狡計如此。而我國人尙有以日本撤兵爲欣慰者耶。</p>

<p>巴黎今日雖爲星期日、國聯理事會起草委員會仍於上午十一時三十分在法外部開會、日代表伊籐送達日本對於國聯决議案之復文、内容聞提出關於預防性質之修正數點、日本雖贊成訓令統兵長官禁止軍隊前進與敵對行動、伹須規定倘日軍爲士匪攻擊時、則將應戰、今日中國施總代表致函白里安、告以中國贊成理事會提議之錦州附近設中立區域辦法、中代表接有官報、中國政府業已訓令錦州軍事長官與該處外國軍事視察員訂立約束等語、又齊齊哈爾英國軍事視察員報告理事會、該城完全在日兵管理之下一日軍入城時雖無大混亂但迄今尙無中國人員辦事、日僑大半重返、日軍尙無北進模樣、第日派飛機往東北方偵察云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎今晨國聯方面聞美日間外交上意外事件、業已圓滿解决之訊、爲之大慰今日下午理事會仍將舉行秘密會議、刻已　出通知、中日代表俱不出席、但日代表芳澤曾於今日赴起草委員會、報告日本對於錦州設中立區域之態度、據聞日政府大體表示贊成、芳澤又向委員會否認日軍向錦州前進之一切報告、否認日飛機曾在該處抛擲炸彈、又通知大部份日軍已退出齊齊哈爾、美大使道威斯今日通知白里安、美國駐日陸軍參贊刻在東三省已接奉訓令、與滯留錦州之其他中立國視察員密切合作、（二十九日國民電）</p>

<p>「打起仗來，日本自必要用海軍把中國的通商口岸一起封鎖起來。只怕經濟命脈一斷，一切都要嗚呼，在我看來，打仗終是凶多吉少。」</p>
<p>「如果日本是很笨的，他或者是要這樣的幹。我想他們荷包裏還藏有更聰明的策略。中國的通商口岸，特别是上海，是帝國主義者施行經濟侵略之根據地。封鎖通商口岸是給列强，特别是英美，一個總打擊。日本現在至少要想英美站在旁觀地位，何能出此挑戰之下策。日本現在所採取之策略是鼓動較大之事以遮蓋較小之事。您看他運用朝鮮屠殺來掩蓋萬寳山案，運用侵略東三省來掩蓋朝鮮屠殺便是這策略之過程。」</p>
<p>「日本還隱藏着什麽大事預備掩蓋東三省之侵略呢。」</p>
<p>「您看他爲什麽一定要越中東路而取齊齊哈爾？向蘇俄挑戰！如果蘇俄中了他的計，英美一起都要站在日本的戰線上來。那時世界上人人心目只有日俄宣戰，資本主義與共產主義宣戰，誰還管日本侵略東三省是一回什麽事。於是東三省便可成爲帝國主義者對於日本之一種慰勞品。所以我的憂慮在蘇俄之中計而不在海口之封鎖。」</p>
<p>「現在宣戰，總好像是孤注一擲。您看，暫時稍受委屈，等到十年生聚，十年敎訓之後，再來和日本算帳如何？」</p>
<p>「十年生聚，十年敎訓，戰而敗的越國可以採這政策。不戰而敗的人决没有資格可以說這句話。自從甲午之後·請問過了幾個十年，於今生聚了什麽，敎訓了什麽？我大胆的說，不戰而敗，敗而不戰，只有奴隸的生聚，奴隸的敎訓！」</p>
<p>「我看這樣拿國命來賭，成敗賓在難有把握。還得愼重。」</p>
<p>「大難當頭，正義在前，生死且須看破，何况成敗。成敗的打算只是秦檜，吳三桂，一流人的把戲。岳武穆，文天祥，史可法，馬占山的心裏有的是正義，何嘗存過一絲一毫的成敗之見！」</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>暴日武力侵掠東三省事件發生國聯爲主持公道之機關。遂受全世界所注目。近來我國伍朝樞氏曾言。我人不可太重視國聯。亦不可輕視國聯。蓋國聯究非與會各國共戴之太上政府也（意思如此。）伍氏昔列席於國聯。知其情形甚審。斯言也。固不可謂非中厥肯竅矣。考查國聯過去之成績。如一九二○年解决瑞典與芬蘭之交涉。一九二一年調解聶哥斯拉維亞與埃爾培尼亞之戰爭。一九二三午調停意大利與希臘之爭端。一九二五年主持英士劃界問題。一九二八年解决玻利維亞與巴拉圭之衝突。似乎對於兩國間之停戰息爭。國聯亦有相當之威力。但在國聯方面。努力於國際間之事業。並非限於仲裁一途。所辦事務。經會中職員湯潑孫氏之報告稱其成功。約有數端。茲特加以譯述。以爲欲明瞭國聯情形者之參考。</p>
<p>（一）歐戰停止後。各聯盟國所獲之俘虜。人數近五十萬。啼飢號寒。無可安置。由國聯决議送往希臘。授地之廣。佔一百二十萬畝焉。同時於士耳其境内救濟被難之婦孺。亦達人數二千之衆。</p>
<p>（二）俄國革命時代。屠殺甚多。時疫甚烈。苟不加以禁遏。則西歐方面。亦須備受傳染。爲禍之廣。將如中世紀歐陸流行之黑死病矣。國聯衛生組之努力。實爲消滅此種危害之唯一功臣。</p>
<p>（三）世界各國之勞資糾紛。亦爲國聯注意之點。所以國聯特組織一國際勞工組。專以調查各國勞工情形。及生計狀况。藉爲解决各項爭端之預備。</p>
<p>（四）此外如恊助各國禁止奴隷之販賣。乃取締鴉片與各種毒物之銷行。亦爲國聯本身視屬重要之職務。據述有相當成績也。</p>
<p>全民界各國供給於國聯之會費。年約百萬鎊。國聯之成績。亦昭然在人耳目此次暴日橫行。提交國聯討論。能否據公理以解决。殊爲該會今日維持威信之重要關鍵矣。</p>
<h3 id="c153">出兵遼吉後的日本眞相 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 陳健午</p>
<p>此次暴日不宣而戰。佔我遼吉。近且奪我黑省。遠因爲田中義一侵略滿蒙奏摺之實施。近因爲日本現内閣南陸相及金谷參謀長再軍閥所演成。吾友萬耕堯君肄業士官學校步兵科。熟悉彼邦情形。一昨爲吾談日本侵佔我領土後。日人朝野上下之態度甚詳。孫孑云知彼知已百戰百勝。爰紀述於后。想亦爲留心中日事件者所樂　歟。</p>
<p>日本靑年感於彼邦失業問題及不景氣現象。愈趨嚴重。政府無法解决。一般大學生及無產黨以爲欲挽回難局。非倒閣不可。故「殺天皇」「打倒内閣」「打倒財閥一等之標語口號。到處皆是南陸相爲維持其地位起見。乃故意造成國際交涉。藉以移動民衆之目光。革命風潮。暫時停頓。若槻内閣。得以苟延殘喘。迨出兵遼吉後。我華人土。感於領土被侵。舉國上下。義憤塡膺。敵愾同仇。世界各國大半同情於我。日本民衆。洞燭其好。更起而向軍人演說。莫受陸相利用。軍人經此番勸導後。反對戰爭者。頗不乏人。南陸相聞知此事。曾殺死軍官數人。而前此民政黨幕中之財閥三井。本爲主戰之份子。近因吾華對日經濟絕交。彼之郵船·煤炭·棉紗·銀行以及東三省大豆公司。相繼停業。虧損之數。難以言喻。營業前途。絕無希望。乃急轉直下一變宣戰之主張爲言和。以早日解决一切糾紛。言於内閣。首相若槻。以軍人尾大不掉。實際上天皇已失却統治兵權之能力。特邀元老西園寺公爵至東京。共商國是。而政友會黨人亦痛詆民政黨之失策。綜上觀之。此次暴行。日本朝野同情我者多。從中作祟止少數軍閥及在鄕軍人。（按日本爲徵兵制度。此種軍人。即在田中時代服過兵役者）語云多難興邦。深望國内同胞。抗暴禦侮。經濟絕交。堅持到底。則扶桑島國自有俯首乞和之一日。</p>

<p>— 天疣</p>
<p>從前梁任公全錄公度此歌二十四首於飲冰室詩話。并說。</p>
<p>其精神之雄壯活潑沉渾深遠不必論。即文藻亦二千年所未有也。吾爲一言以蔽之日。</p>
<p>讀此詩而不起舞者。必非男子。</p>
<p>我們現在讀此詩。不與任公同感嗎。</p>
<p>公度的小學校學生相和歌。共十九章。其歌先以一人唱。章末三名衆人合唱。茲錄其最雄壯的六首。</p>
<p>聽聽汝小生。人各有身即天職。一身之外皆汝敵。一身之内皆汝責人。不若人吾喪吾。怙父倚天總無益。於戱。我小生絕去奴隸心。堂堂要獨立。</p>
<p>聽聽汝小生。我愛我書莫如史。此一塊肉搏搏地。軒頊傳來百餘世。先公先祖幾經營。長在我儂心子裏。於戱。我小生。開卷愛國心。掩卷憂國淚。</p>
<p>聽聽汝小生。人言汝國多文辭。彼尖尖筆毛之錐。此點點墨染於絲。何物蟹行肆蠶食。努力努力爭相持。於戱。我小生。世無文弱國。今非偃武時。</p>
<p>聽聽汝小生。欲求國强先自强。食案以外即戰塲。劍影之下即天堂。偕行偕行若赴敵。朝歌夕舞黑裲襠。於戱。我小生。生當作鐵漢。死當化金剛。</p>
<p>勉勉汝小生。旣爲國民忍作賊。國民貴保民資格。國民要有民特色。任鋤非種任瓜子分。心肝直此黑奴黑。於戱。我小生。焚盡白降幡。有我無他國。</p>
<p>勉勉汝小生。汝當盡職務民義。嬴顚劉　幾廢興。蚩蚩不問官家事。棟折榱崩汝所知。天墜難逃天壓已。於戱。我小生。誓竭黔首愚。同救蒼天死。</p>
<p>我們讀這種妙文。又豈能不起舞嗎。（注二）</p>
<p>附註一。如最近頒佈的學生義勇軍敎育綱領第三條略云「全國各學校在課程上。······關於文學藝術等課程。必須注重發揚民族精神。造成雄壯勇敢之風尙。一切浪漫墮落萎靡不振之文藝。絕對禁止。」</p>
<p>附註二。人境廬詩集在日本印行。現不易得。坊間有人境廬詩箋。尙易購買。惜所選不多。</p>

<h3 id="c155">鄕下人又到上海（三十二） <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄕下人吃飽了飯，走出了梅園酒家。心想··現在可以到梅蘭坊，尋他的外甥阿木林去了。還是坐黃包車去呢？還是坐電車去呢？坐電車，已經纒了半天，把我送到了大舞台對過，没有達到目的地。還是爽爽快快，呌了一部黃包車，敎他拉到梅蘭坊，似乎省事得多咧。</p>
<p>他一面想，一面正在觀看上海夜景。那時正在夜裏八點鐘光景，上海人吃夜飯的時候。中西各餐館，客人似潮水一般的的湧來。電燈照耀得好像家家店舖子門前，都紮了一座電燈牌樓。那此出堂唱的妓女們，打扮得花團錦簇，坐了光可鑒人的包車。那個包車夫，一推一挽，跑得比了馬車還要快。</p>
<p>鄕下人想起一件事來了··也是他們一村上的，名喚阿金龍的一個小夥子，到上海來，給一家公館裏拉包車。那位公館裏的老爺，是個大塊頭，拉包車的人，都有些不歡迎他，他却偏要包車夫拉得快。那班老鎗包車夫見了他就搖頭。他們說；「與其拉這位大塊頭老爺，寗可還是扛棺材好得多。」那位阿金龍，却是年輕脚健，拉了這位老爺，舉步如飛，所以那位老爺，便選中了他。</p>
<p>有許多妒忌阿金龍的人，駡他一聲兩脚馬。這兩脚馬的意思，却也有些惡毒。拉車子的馬，原是四隻脚的，現在人類也做了馬的營生。馬是畜生，爲人類服務，牠是不能說話，不能向人類訴苦。旣然是個人，爲什麽這個人應得寫寫意意坐在車子上，那個人應得奔走喘汗拉着車子跑，人也幹了畜生的營生，却是還比畜生短了兩條腿，因此拉車子的人類，便得到了這個雅號，喚做「兩脚馬。」</p>
<p>可是鄉下人見了那一推一挽出風頭的包車，那包車夫還是得意洋洋，暗想這明明也是四隻脚在那裏跑，不過一頭畜生，却換了兩頭人類罷了。</p>
<p>「該！上海的女諸葛亮眞多哪。」他一面走，又一面自言自語的在那裏說痴話。</p>
<p>原來在春天做草臺戲的當兒，他看見過一齣空城計，他知道手裏握着一柄羽毛扇的那個人兒，名字喚做諸葛亮。不想現在到了上海來一看，那些坐在包車裏的姑娘們，人人手裏握着一柄羽毛扇，所以他嘆着一口氣，說上海的女諸葛太多咧。</p>

<h3 id="c164">關於烟草的故事　富·蘭· <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>美國的喬治哀蘭士、（	Ｇeorge　Ａrents）可算世界上惟一的烟草書籍的收藏家了、幾吉部的書本、册子、以及古代判罰無不應有盡有、價値連城、所以特地用一隻古舊的鐵箱、把那些稀有的版本、本齊藏在裏面、外加十二管不同的暗鎖、</p>
<p>他開始於一八九二年搜集、那時他還只十七歲、他的一位阿叔、是種植烟草的、所以對他提出這個建議、目下他預備印刷一部烟草的故事、分爲三卷、每卷和電話用户簿一般的厚、裏面包含着許多有趣的事實、像范浦西（Ｖespucci）是書籍上最初提起烟草人的、時在一五零五年、他見委内瑞拉的印第安人、把烟葉研成粉末、搓成爲丸、呑入口内、當他們坐着獨木舟出發遠征的時候、以爲如是可以防止飢餓、</p>
<p>第一次在書本上提起吸烟的人、是西班牙人奥維陀（Ｏviedo）、約在一五三五年、他見海第的印第安人、把烟草燃着、裝入蘆管、吸入鼻孔裏去、他們一燃着火、立刻拚命地狂吸、在今日的人類當之、是要結果性命的、</p>
<p>一二年之後、奥維陀瞧見有些印第安人、把乾烟草放在棕梠葉上、用火燃着、吸受他們發射出來的毒氣、這事可使吸者終日麻醉、但當時竟没有人去警醒他們、</p>
<p>斯賓塞是英國作家最初提及烟草的人、莎士比亞的集中、却從來不曾有提及烟草之事、據哀蘭士推想起來、以爲這就是莎翁一世與培根反對的證明、因爲培根時時提起這件東西、也許這位大詩翁、爲了英王查米斯反對吸烟、把烟捐徵至百分之四千、以期戒絕人民吸烟、所以特地在詩集裏摒絕不提</p>
<p>在十八世紀之時、英國差不多没有吸烟的人了、當十七世紀之時、英國遍地風行、上下各階級都爭以吸烟爲時尙、</p>
<p>自從鼻烟崛起、吸者漸少、但到了十九世紀、吸者復盛、一八六四年、開始用機器製造香烟、而捲烟機器、即於一八八三年發明、以迄於今、</p>
<p>烟草、一般人認有可以療治鼻涕膜、痙攣、等等病痛、據哀蘭士的考據、當美國南北大戰之時、兵士們出發、都於腋下塗敷着烟草、以止病痛、</p>
<p>哀蘭士又考得世界古今第一位的吸烟錦標的保持者、當推荷蘭人充雷斯（Ｍ.Ｖ.Ｋlaes）、他於一八七一年身故、存年九十八歲、他一生所吸之烟、共有四噸左右、當他臨終之時、邀求一應吸烟同志、請他們共同參與他的葬禮、在舉葬之時、須大家吸烟、不許間斷、屈時共到同志數百人、每人給以烟斗二枚、烟草十磅、這個葬禮、眞是破天荒的盛舉、一時烟霧迷天、對面不能辨人、</p>

<p>富·蘭·</p>
<p>世界聞名的英國文學家華來斯、（Ｅdgar　Wallace）最近已經與美國有聲電影公司總辦史納綬訂立契約、替該公司寫一部小說、這是美國許多影片公司經過多年的磋商、要想獲得他創造的服務、而没有結果的、這次居然給該公司達到目的、眞是難能可貴了、</p>
<p>這位文學家的天才、久爲美國一般製片商所羨慕、他們繼續不斷的努力、想把他從英格蘭引誘來美、終於不能如願、這次史納綬氏的成功、也即美國有聲電影界的奏凱、</p>
<p>這位卓異的英國著作家、他的現代世界作家中、已可推爲有數分子、寫過幾百種的小說、和無數的短篇、在過去三十年中、無時不孜孜於此、在英國、他在二三位出類拔萃的現代文學家中、安穩地坐着一把交椅、</p>
<p>他的書籍、每年行銷美國、不下幾百萬册、他的著作、各國都有譯本、神秘的和冒險的故事、尤其是他的拿手好戲、除了長短篇小說之外、他更著過不少的劇本、内中有若干曾在紐約百老匯街出演、博得很大的成功、像「當塲」一劇、是勗弁德公司出品、曾在福來斯德戲院出演、便是一例、</p>
<p>美國戲院第一次表演他的著作、是在一九一三年、他在那時、早經成爲一位成功的小說家了、他曾寫一部劇本、題爲「經理之夢」、不曾引人注意、於是他改著音樂的喜劇、像「喂、大家、」「你在那邊嗎、」「微笑、」「兵士、」「地黃牛」等等、</p>
<p>到了一九二六年、他開始寫歌舞劇本、遂被列入一股倫敦劇作家之前茅、第一次來了一部「完全的君子、」繼之以「恐怖、」「變姓名的人、」「飛行隊、」「呼號者、」「無名氏、」及「日曆」等等、</p>
<p>華來斯的簽訂合同、在史納綬氏方面、還是第一步工作的開始、他們預備將一般著名作家、悉行設法羅致、替有聲電影公司各寫一部有價値的原始作品、</p>

<h3 id="c166">地方自治槪論·曉·光 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>林衆可著</p>
<p>中山先生在「建國大綱」裏說、「在訓政時期、政府當派曾經訓練考試合格之員到各縣協助人民籌備自治······」、又說、「建設地方自治、促進民權發達、」我們都知道、黨的革命政策、分軍政、訓政、憲政三個時期、憲政的基礎乃打在訓政之上、訓政的工作則包含於地方自治之中、可見地方自治的事業、實爲吾黨唯一精神的基本工作、換句話、即地方自治的思想到了今日、已明白地由文藉的綱領移到政治的綱領了、所以在這訓政開始、地方自治正在舉辦之時、我來介紹這本書、也不是多事的吧、</p>
<p>本書作者林衆可先生、是個著作豐富的學者、他心理想地方自治之實現已有十多年了、此書是作者十多年來對於研究地方自治血汗的累積、</p>
<p>本書共分六章、第一章是緒論、第二章是地方團體的構成、第三章是地方團體的機關、第四章是地方自治的劃分、第五章是地方自治的運用、第六章是地方自治的監督、茲將每章簡略的作下列的分析、</p>
<p>第一章、緒論、本章說明「關於地方自治的基礎觀念」、中間對於地方自治的意義及辦理自治的人所負擔的使命尤說得無微不至、</p>
<p>第二章、地方團體的構成、本章内分三節、第一節是「地方團體的區域」、第二節是「地方團體的住民」、第三節是「地方團體的公民」、在第一節中又分第一欵、「地方團體的區域之性質」、對於區域的性質及設施事項均有非常詳細的說明、第二欵「地方團體的區域之變動」、它是以法律規定其如何得能變解其區域範圍之方法及區域内之區鄕鎭處理廢置分合境界變更之種種情形、第二節是「地方團體的住民」、本節說明怎樣才算是地方團體的住民、及地方團體的住民之種種以法律規定之相當條件、第三節是「地方團體的公民」、在第一欵内包涵「公民的意義及淵源」、第二欵爲「公民的要件」、在這里、作者以爲公民應具有積極的要件和消極的要件兩種、才稱爲公民、第三欵說到「公民的權利」、就是選舉、罷免、創制、複决等四個政權、作者以黨的立塲爲根據、並且參考世界各國的各種制度來闌明四個政權的起源及如何的運用、單就複决權一項來說、作者在形式上分開六類、（一）强制的複决權、（二）任意的複决權、（三）普通的複决權、（四）勸告的複决權、（五）諮詢的複决權、（六）批准的複决權、</p>
<p>而且、每個複决權中都有它特殊的作用、就是其他三個政權、都像複决權一樣的那麽精密的分說、這在讀者、是覺到很明白而且不會挖破腦袋去多費思索的</p>
<p>第三章、地方團體的機關、本章共分兩節、第一節、「地方團體的意思機關」、丨如縣的地方自治團體的意思機關是爲縣選議會、丨細述縣參議會的性質、組織、權能、及議事方法、第二節、「地方團體的理事機關」、丨如縣政府丨關於縣長應如何選舉、而被選的縣長應有怎樣的職權、都很顯明地在這節詳爲說明、</p>
<p>第四章、地方團體的劃分、中山先生手訂之「地方自治開始實行法」中劈頭第一句說、「地方自治的範圍、當以一縣爲充分之區域、如不得一縣、則聯合數村而附有縱橫二三十里之田野者、亦可爲一試辦區域、」於此、足見中山先生對於地方自治、原亦主張劃分的、本章内分三節、第一節爲「區自治」、内包含「」關於區民大會」、「區公所」、「區監察委員會」、「區調解委員會、「區財政」等等、均有徹底明確之規定、第二節爲「鄕鎭自治、其中對</p>
<p>行政範圍、悉依法律規定之、第三節爲「閭鄰自治」、其組織及事務較區鄕鎭爲簡單些、閭鄰的範圍雖小、但作者却没有因範圍的狹小而疏忽其種種有系統的叙述</p>
<p>第五章、地方自治的運用、作者在本章的開端、就這樣說「地方自治的運用云者、就是地方自治團體、對於本身的作用如何經營及對社會的實現如何活動的意思、」現正値訓政開始、舉國各地辦理地方自治之際、關於「地方自治的運用」的一個基本實際問題、無論如何也决不能任其疏忽的、所以本書的作者格外具體化的列舉許多社會上實際情形來作本章各節的引證、</p>
<p>這一章共分三節、第一節是、「關於自治權的基礎觀念」、在這一節裏分兩點來說明、即一爲「自治權的基礎」、一爲「固有事務與委任事務」、自治權的基礎即國家的法制之承認的自治能力、在這裏、作者詳爲解釋五個治權的意義及機能、並述歐洲各國的自治權與我國自治權的不同之比較、</p>
<p>第二節是「地方團體的行政管理權」·内詳細分開·「組織權的意義」·「組織的内容」·「法規制定權」·「自治法規制定權的内容」·「條例制定的過程」·「公共的勞務管理的限界」·「公共的勞務管理權的運用」及「强制權」等、逐一說明地方上應如何的設置及應如何改格或廢止事務、關心社會問題者、能在這里得到許多具體的補救及設施方針、亦是目前從事於勞動運動者有以很大的帮助的、</p>
<p>第三節是、「地方團體的財政管理權」·將「財產管理權」·「支出財政權」·「地方自治團體的歲出」·「地方稅」·及公用「負担」等項、作者以財政學爲依據、對於以上各項在地方自治團體應如何去管理、均予以很充分的伸說、</p>
<p>第六章、地方自治的監督、我們在要明瞭地方自治的監督是什麽以前、自然是不能不先知道監督是什麽、好在關於這一個急待解答問題、作者已很明白在書本上代我們解答了、「監督的意義、應分二點來說、一是行於公法上之關係的監督、一是行於私法上之關係的監督、前者如各國之「立法監督」·「司法監督」·「行政監督」是、後者如代理人之對於複代理人的監督、使用者之對於被使用者的監督、親權者之對於無能力者的監督是」</p>
<p>本章計分二節、第一節是「關於自治監督的基礎觀念」、在這一節裏又分爲三要點、一、爲「自治監督的必要」二、爲「自治監督的形式」、三、爲「自治監督的機關」是、第二節是「監督權的内容」、内包括、監視權、取消命令權及處分權、代議决權、專决處分權、代執行權、解散權、懲戒權、認可權、决定權保留等九項、以上各權都有各權的意義和任務、名稱上雖是各異、但却都是互爲條件、互爲關係的、在區鄕鎭等公所成立之後、自治監督即行使其職務、爲各該地方團體謀永固的福利、</p>
<p>綜合上述各章、我認爲此書是地方自治書籍中内容最豐富而充實的一本、實在說、關於比較完美的地方自治的書本在目前的中國確實缺乏得可憐、著者以十多年腐心研究的結果而作成這十餘萬字的巨著、實在是學術界開一朶光輝燦爛的花、對於辦理地方自治的人、作一南針是無可否認的、訓政時期已展開在我們的眼前了、爲了促進地方自治的工作早日實現起見、故樂於介紹此書於讀者諸君之前、我虔誠地禱祝這部材料豐富的巨著、在最短期間能收獲到、很大的效果</p>

<p>— 澄</p>
<p>連日下着霏霏的淫雨、使我們歡快的心情、跟隨着陰沉沉的天氣、而也成了陰沉沉的、在課室内、有幾個同學、鼓足了氣、從口琴内、大吹出電影名曲「雷蒙娜」的歌調、但口琴聲雖仍和以前一樣的淸婉抑揚、一樣的悅我們的耳、但同學們和着口琴聲唱出的歌聲、却没有以前那般高興、那般婉囀、那般的移動着脚尖、似乎要準備着跳舞的樣兒、眞的、不快了的心情、有甚法子使他快樂呢、除了那正情自動的快樂、</p>
<p>「呵、這種悶人的天、悶人的雨、悶人的課室、悶人的功課、眞可以把我們悶死了、」口琴的聲音停後、楊說着、每句中有一個「悶」字、</p>
<p>「本來、做學子當然是悶悶的、我們不是比囚在籠中的鳥、還要悶嗎、鳥雖囚在牠狹小的天地裏、可是牠的呌、牠的跳、牠的吃、都是自由的、牠覺得高興了、便自由地呌呌、或是跳跳、想吃了、就吃些食物、再没有甚麽不適意的了、可是我們呢、就不及囚在籠中的鳥、那般的自由了、「嘡······」的上課鐘聲、根本阻止了我們的活潑、我們的想做甚麽便做甚麽、我們的想說甚麽便說甚麽、」同學汪發着牢騷、她是最愛自由的、學校裏的規則、她以爲都似乎死板板的來縛着她、</p>
<p>「老實說、學校是吃人的地方、如我的爸爸不逼着我到學校、我定不會像這時樣的悶坐在課室中、試想、我們所學的、都非將來在社會上時所用、所以我們徒耗費精神去孜孜地研究的、」汪的同調陸接着說、她是很聰明的、可是平時對於任何、那樣功課、都不加以深切的研究的、她是抱着六十分主義的消極者、她考試後、得到了她「可能及格」的消息、便快樂得甚麽似的、</p>
<p>我們都婉惜着汪和陸、爲了她們把她們靈敏的頭腦、在寫情書上用功夫、他們輕視名列前茅、對於六十分以上的分數、是不要求的、所以他們二人、願寂寂的落在人後、而不願與誰競爭、也不妒嫉誰、因此、「撒爛汚的朋友」幾字、成了他倆人的綽號、</p>
<p>「確是徒耗精神去孜孜地研究的、試想、做一個Ｌady是何等的容易、我們現時所學的、那個Ｌady曾拿來應用過、Ｌady們所要知道、不過是怎樣去服侍她們的丈夫吧了、」沈黯然的、又似嘆息說着、她絕對婉惜着汪和陸的、所以因了愈婉惜、她愈拿話來挖苦她們、同時、沈是這樣的一個人、這樣的主張着學校裏的功課、有一門要精通一門的、有幾個同學曾譏笑她、她坦然的說、「旣不須完全知着、爲甚學校裏面定須我們樣樣都讀、而且是要及格的呢、」我們想不出適當的話回答她、祗喊着她「好學生、好學生、」</p>
<p>沈說的挖苦話、對於汪和陸、不起一些反響、她們滿不在乎似的、淡然的說着、「隨你說、隨你說、」</p>
<p>我們也寂寂的、對於兩方都不加甚麽意見、</p>
<p>○　　　　○　　　　　○</p>
<p>今天國文課、先生發還我們的作文簿、每個人從先生的手中接過來後、都低着頭在讀、獨汪和陸還不安似的坐着、昻着頭望着先生、</p>
<p>「汪和陸定不有格、」一個聲音輕輕的進我的耳、</p>
<p>但先生忽高聲的微笑着說、「汪××和陸××、這次的作文很進步、她們的文的意義、比誰都好、我來講給你們聽、··························」</p>
<p>我們一邊靜靜地　着　一邊想着她們大槪得了覺悟吧、在聽了沈的話後、</p>
<h3 id="c169">不同的先生 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 錦</p>
<p>英文敎師怱怱地跨進敎室來、一面氣喘喘地揩着額上的汗、兩只骨流流的眼睛、跼促地往四方一瞧、那種情狀也眞使人可憐他呢、</p>
<p>「喔、先生、好早呀、上課已十分鐘咧、」張女士顯出譏諷的狀態對先生說、</p>
<p>「呀、上課已十分鐘咧嗎、不、時候好像還早呢、」先生一面看着錶、一面驚奇地說、</p>
<p>「那麽、何不在府上再坐一會休息休息、」張女士冷冷地說、</p>
<p>「哈、先生你的錶或許在睡覺呢、」鈴笑嘻嘻地望着先生說、</p>
<p>「哦、是了、我的錶走慢咧、」先生慢慢的說、</p>
<p>「原來你的錶慢咧、但是到了上課時、總不見得因你没有來而不敲鐘、等你來了敲鐘總不見得、」張女士露着卑視的形狀、恨恨地對先生說、</p>
<p>「先生、你點名吧、」鈴對於張女士的話、好似有些不耐了、她恨恨地望了張女士一眼、便對先生說着、</p>
<p>先生就慢慢地把點名册放下、便點名了、他的狀貎是無可奈何的、</p>
<p>在點名時、鈴輕輕地對同坐的娟說道、「也没這樣的、先生遲到了幾分鐘、她就如此無禮對着先生、眞的先生也太善了、······喂、你看呀、她在對先生做鬼臉呢」、</p>
<p>我聽了、不覺迅速地把頭回轉去望她一眼、只見張女士迷着眼睛、張大着嘴兒、一個舌頭在左一擺右一擺地急急的搖着、</p>
<p>這時、先生在敎書了、靜默得很、</p>
<p>「不懂、不懂、不懂你有說些什麽、」張女士立時衝破了寂靜、胡閙般的喊了起來、也不聽先生爲了她重講的一段、她祇管同她坐在一角裏的同學談笑、</p>
<p>「喂、你們瞧先生的一件袍子呀、這麽大而長、哈哈他不是像一隻大燈籠嗎、」珍開始批評先生了、</p>
<p>「不、倒像戲台上的小丑呢、」芬跟着她說、</p>
<p>「他的臉我最恨了、好似一個哭鬼、那張嘴一動一動的好似老太婆、那些頭髮也不梳梳光、你們看不像一把爛稻章嗎、」</p>
<p>「我最恨他的惹人厭的聲音、國語不像國語、土語不像士語、聽得連人飯也要吐出來咧、你聽呀、「則夠」「則夠」不知他爲何要這樣讀、難道讀「這個」不可以嗎、」瑞輕輕地說着、</p>
<p>「呀、怎麽、先生你講得這般快、」張女士現着驚奇的樣子說、</p>
<p>「並不快、或許你不在聽呢、」先生說</p>
<p>「你怎知我不在聽、我明明聽着呢、」張女士氣憤憤地說、</p>
<p>「那麽我問你、我講到什麽地方、」先生說、</p>
<p>「你在講書爲何要問我、難道你忘記了講到那裏嗎、」張女士紅着臉說、</p>
<p>噹、噹、噹、好容易一課散了、先生急忙忙地跑出了敎室、好似逃出了地獄一般、</p>
<p>○　　　○　　　○</p>
<p>接下來一個是政治學、上課了許久却還不見先生來、同學們便胡閙起來了、忽然一陣壳壳的皮鞋聲在走廊裏敲動起來了、一會敎室的門開了、政治學先生穿着一套簇新的西裝、頭上戴着一頂呢帽、手裏提着一只大黑皮包、那隻肩胛欣了起來、好似挑着一付擔似的、走了進來、</p>
<p>張女士又開始對先生說了、「呀、先生、今天怎麽遲到了、我們等了許久時候了、差不多有一刻了呢、」</p>
<p>「呀、不、還早呢、」先生望着張女士慢慢地說、</p>
<p>「是、還早、恐怕還没上課呢、」</p>

<p>Peiping: In recent days, Japanese troops outside Shanhaikwan advanced westward on a large scale, occupying Xinmin, Jiliuhe, Raoyanghe, and other stations, pressing towards Dagushan. The Council of the League of Nations and the United States believed that Japan showed no intention of repenting. Suddenly, Japan's attitude turned serious. Japan, realizing the unfavorable situation, has ordered the Japanese troops to retreat from Tokyo. According to a Jinzhou dispatch, all the Japanese troops at Jiliuhe have withdrawn. The Japanese troops stationed in Shenyang and Xinmin are also in the process of withdrawing. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Peiping-Shanhaikwan Dispatch: After the Japanese troops withdrew from Jiliuhe, Xinmin, and other places, the Jin Province Government ordered: "The original security forces will take over the defense separately, paying attention to suppressing bandits and protecting the local area."

<p>Shenyang: A regiment of Japanese soldiers that departed along the North Ning Road on Friday night has almost completely withdrawn today. There are currently about 200 South Manchurian Railway cars, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers and baggage, returning to the station. Some Japanese soldiers have also returned here from Qiqihar. However, the exact number is not disclosed by the Japanese military headquarters. It is reported that Major General Domon, the commander of the Second Division, who led the troops across the Nen River to seize Qiqihar, has now moved his headquarters to Changchun. Only one regiment remains stationed in Heihe. A large detachment of Kwantung troops took a train to Dalian today. It is expected that this detachment will board a ship to Tianjin after arriving in Dalian. The transfer of troops along the North Ning Road has been very busy these days. Ordinary passenger trains have been completely suspended. There was a train at the station today with its engine running, ready to depart, but it was ultimately unable to depart for Tianjin. It is reported that the Jiliuhe telephone line was cut by Japanese soldiers during the advance and has not yet been repaired. The trains used by the Japanese soldiers who left for Jinzhou on Friday were all South Manchurian Railway vehicles. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Our Troops Stationed at Dagushan</p>
<p>Peiping-Jinzhou Dispatch: On the 28th, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs west of Raoyanghe and east of Dagushan as a show of force. Our armored train fleet was at Tangjiawopu, and the Japanese armored train and troop train were at Lijiawopu. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>

Two aircraft flew over Dagushan and dropped two bombs, one falling on the new station and the other on the old station. One aircraft flew to Goubangzi for reconnaissance, intending to assist the military in the attack. According to official reports, on the morning of the 27th, a Japanese armored train, escorted by cavalry, artillery, and infantry trains (over a dozen vehicles), advanced towards Raoyanghe. Our side sent an armored train to protect the passenger train, blocking their advance. The Japanese armored train with eight cannons and four machine guns attacked us fiercely. Our armored train, with only two cannons and four machine guns, was no match and was damaged. A Dagushan armored train came to the rescue, fiercely resisting and damaging the front of the Japanese armored train. At 4 p.m., the Japanese sent two more locomotives, one of which was destroyed. Japanese artillery dismounted and launched a fierce attack from the side. Our armored train was forced to retreat to the west bridge of Raoyanghe. Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked our armored train from the left, destroying Bridge No. 34. One of our armored trains retreated to Chenjiatun, and the other retreated to Lijiawopu. During the Japanese attack, many aircraft dropped bombs, and the army is currently stationed in Dagushan, prepared for absolute self-defense. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops Disregard Previous Agreements</p>
<p>Continued Shelling and Firing Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Consuls of Various Countries Mediate Again</p>
<p>Entire Security Forces Retreat to Hebei</p>
<p>Gunfire Still Heard in the Japanese Zone Last Night</p>
<p>Tianjin: On the afternoon of the 28th, the authorities of our province and city accepted the advice of the consuls and ordered the security forces to retreat to maintain peace. They also agreed with the Japanese military that if the Japanese military did not shell or fire guns on the night of the 28th, the security forces would retreat to Hebei on the morning of the 29th. Unexpectedly, at 0:30 a.m. on the 29th, the Japanese military suddenly directed plainclothes troops to attack Rongye Street and Nanguan Xiatou. Japanese soldiers from Haiguang Temple also fired four or five cannons to assist. We urgently called the Japanese military headquarters to question them. They replied that they were unaware and promised to reply after an investigation. At 1 a.m., the Japanese soldiers led the plainclothes troops to retreat. At 5:10 a.m. on the 29th, plainclothes troops from the Jiekou, Southeast City Gate, Nanshi, and Nanguan Xiatou gun emplacements, led by Japanese soldiers, launched a fierce attack on the affiliated territories. Japanese troops fired eight cannons to cover the advance. The Commander of the Security Forces Wang Yimin, and the Chief of Staff of the Martial Law Headquarters Dong Zhifang, personally inspected the defenses and strictly ordered no return fire. The plainclothes troops charged to within 20 meters of our defensive line but were blocked by the electric fence. We still did not return fire. Seeing no resistance, the plainclothes troops tried to destroy the electric fence. The situation was critical, so they threw hand grenades. At 6 a.m., the Japanese soldiers led the plainclothes troops to retreat. Therefore, because the Japanese side showed no sincerity, the planned withdrawal of the security forces on the morning of the 29th was temporarily suspended. At 9 a.m., Chinese and Japanese representatives met to discuss a peaceful resolution, but without result. The Japanese side instead accused us of not withdrawing the security forces, considering it insincere. The Japanese military headquarters again ordered on the 29th that residents within the Japanese concession must move out completely within three days and not be allowed to remain. Duan Qirui, Wu Guangxin, and others were also warned by Kashi and moved to the British concession on the 28th. Bai Wenwei and others took refuge in the British concession on the night of the 9th. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Tianjin Public Security Bureau issued a notice to merchants and residents on the 29th, allowing them to move freely. Martial law was lifted from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Those fleeing to the British, French, Italian, and Special District One concessions surged like a tide, adding two or three hundred thousand people to each concession, but there were no houses to accommodate them, and the situation was extremely tragic. Due to a lack of vehicles, some forcibly seized cars to move. Hebei was also affected. The Public Security Bureau has moved its files and documents, and the Martial Law Headquarters has moved to the Hebei Second Army Headquarters for offices. As the security forces are implementing their withdrawal, there will be no guarantee south of the Grand Canal. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to relief workers from the Red Cross, the Japanese military is building fortifications on Fugui Street in the southern city. The Japanese defense line at the east entrance of Qinghe Street has encroached on the Qingyang Tea House on Jianwu Street. Since the night of the 26th, the area within 300 meters has become a rampant area for plainclothes troops, and Japanese soldiers are also appearing there. Poor people in Gun Emplacement Village and Wandezhuang, due to threats, are all wearing armbands welcoming the plainclothes troops. On the 29th, the Japanese zone expelled Chinese people from the zone, not allowing them to re-enter. The number of gun emplacements along various roads has increased. The marines who arrived in Tianjin were also dispatched. The Belgian Ship Three Maru brought another 48 boxes of ammunition and four portable machine guns from Tanggu at 8 a.m. on the 29th, which were unloaded at the wharf in the Japanese Concession. Sixteen Japanese soldiers stationed at the East Station returned to the Japanese Concession on the morning of the 29th. Because the Japanese soldiers did not keep their word and fired on our troops, our security forces are willing to defend their original defense line to the death and will not retreat again. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Japanese soldiers did not keep their word and fired cannons and guns twice on the morning of the 29th. Five shells landed in Huaiqing Li. The Xia residence at No. 14 had one south room destroyed by the bombing. The Li residence at No. 15 had one east room destroyed. Two people were injured at No. 29. The Western room of the headquarters of the 20th Company of the Security Forces was destroyed by the bombing. Two mortar shells landed near the lane. One shell landed on Zhongxi Temple Street, and two shrapnel bombs landed on Jianwu Street, exploding in the air. Details of the above damage are unknown. Consuls from various countries are mediating, still advising both China and Japan to make concessions and maintain peace. Our side is enduring humiliation and seeking complete peace, deciding that the Security Forces will withdraw between 4 and 6 p.m. on the 29th. South of the Grand Canal in Hebei, police will maintain order with handguns and hand grenades. If they encounter groups of three or five plainclothes troops, the police will have sufficient strength to repel them. If a large number of plainclothes troops are discovered, the Japanese military headquarters will be notified immediately, and our security forces will cross the river to suppress and capture them. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: At 4:30 p.m., our security forces gathered at the headquarters and, under the supervision of the Japanese, retreated to Hebei with grief and tears. Our police immediately returned to their posts, and our fortifications were temporarily retained. The First District General Office moved to the Fourth Precinct of the First District for offices, and the Sixth Precinct of the First District moved to a brothel for offices.</p>

Plainclothes troops in that area and Xingye Street also fired at us until after 4 a.m. In the Southeastern Corner area, machine gun fire was very dense. At 7 a.m., the enemy fired machine guns from the roof of the Jintan Company in the Southeastern Corner, and a cannon was fired, the shell landing in front of the Tongniu Photo Studio on Dongma Road. At 8 a.m., the enemy fired two short bursts of artillery in the Southeastern Corner. (2) In the Jiekou area, the enemy fired machine guns at us from Jiekou starting at 2 a.m., and the gunfire was still very intense until after 4 a.m. At 8 a.m., about 20 Japanese soldiers and plainclothes troops near the South Jiekou Telephone Bureau intermittently fired machine guns at us. (3) In the Nanguan Xiatou area, at 2:50 a.m. on the 28th, plainclothes troops attacked from Haiguang Temple, Gun Emplacement Village, and Huaiqing Li, and also attacked Nanguan Xiatou from Haiguang Temple. In all of the above locations, our side did not return fire, and the defensive lines remained unchanged. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: After lengthy negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the Japanese military authorities here, an agreement was reached this afternoon that the Chinese authorities would transfer all armed police forces to the opposite bank of the river, leaving only police to direct traffic to guard the areas they are withdrawing from. These police will only carry handguns and hand-thrown tear gas grenades. If plainclothes troops appear in the areas they are withdrawing from, the Chinese authorities can summon the armed police forces on the opposite bank to control them. At the same time, the Japanese military authorities will be notified. The Chinese armed police forces are scheduled to withdraw between 4 and 6 p.m. today. Residents within the Chinese boundary are moving to various concessions all day long in an endless stream. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>To Discuss the Neutral Zone Issue in Jinzhou</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Expresses Willingness to Withdraw Troops</p>
<p>Peiping: Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Yano visited Zhang Xueliang last night to discuss the Tianjin incident. Zhang said that he had been ordered by the Central Government not to allow the incident to escalate and had instructed Wang Shuchang and Zhang Xueming to handle it carefully. Yano said that he had just received instructions from his country that the Tokyo government had sent a letter to the French ambassador, expressing the suggestion of taking over the neutral zone of the Chinese side, and had instructed Honjo to withdraw the westward troops to the leased territories of the South Manchurian Railway within Shenyang. As for the administrative police and other matters within the future neutral zone related to Chinese sovereignty, they would also be handled by the Chinese side. Zhang replied that he had not yet received instructions from the Central Government regarding the demarcation of the neutral zone and could not act arbitrarily. Since he had been informed of the Tokyo government's opinion, he would telegraph it to the Central Government for instructions. It is rumored that he entrusted French Ambassador Wilden to suggest the construction of a neutral zone, which is actually speculation and unfounded talk. However, if the Central Government has orders, he is very willing to comply. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Peiping: Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Yano, acting on instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited Zhang Xueliang last night to discuss ways to establish a neutral zone between Shenyang and Shanhaikwan. Yano stated that the Japanese troops in that area are now withdrawing towards Shenyang. It is heard that Zhang Xueliang claimed that he was willing to withdraw the Liaoning provincial government and troops from Jinzhou to Shanhaikwan, which could only be done after approval from the Nanjing government. However, if the troops were withdrawn, local banditry would be a concern, so it is planned to leave cavalry to assist local officials in maintaining order. Zhang is now awaiting instructions from the Nanjing government, and the troop withdrawal order has not yet been issued. It is expected that the Japanese troops on the North Ning line will be completely withdrawn tonight. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Japanese Fighting Capability Greatly Reduced Due to Severe Cold</p>
<p>Peiping-Harbin Dispatch: The supporting troops for Ma, who have arrived at the area of Genghis Khan, are now divided into northern and southern routes, planning to cross the Qike-Tao-Ang lines and concentrate on Keshan and Hailun. The northern route army, which has arrived at Halatun, has clashed with Japanese troops. The southern route army, which has reached Daheishanzi, has opened fire on each other due to Japanese troops preventing their advance. Currently, the Nen River has frozen, and vehicles can travel on the ice, but tanks and machine guns are extremely difficult to use because the machine oil is congealed. As a result, the fighting capability of the Japanese troops has been greatly reduced. These supporting troops will wait for an opportunity to advance to their destination.

<p>The Japanese Emperor Has Ordered the Withdrawal of Troops</p>
<p>Peiping: Jiang Zuobin telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, reporting that the Japanese military brazenly disregarded international conventions this time, sending troops to China, and the military occupation area is expanding daily. Japan's international credibility has therefore been lost, and the Japanese diplomatic authorities feel particularly difficult to respond. Recently, Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara paid a special visit to the Japanese Emperor, requesting him to stop the military's reckless actions, and explained the situation in detail. Finally, he contended over whether to stay or leave, demanding that the Japanese Emperor agree immediately, otherwise, he would resign from the position of Foreign Minister and leave everything to be presided over by the military. The Japanese Emperor then expressed his condolences to Shidehara personally and promised to stop the military's inappropriate behavior immediately, seemingly stating that he would withdraw to the original defenses, and ordered the Minister of the Army not to act rashly and to halt the troops.

<p>Paris: Japanese representative Ayasawa cabled Briand, guaranteeing that Japan would not take hostile actions other than self-defense, declaring that the Japanese government wished to avoid conflicts in the Jinzhou area. The cable also stated that if the Chinese troops in the Jinzhou area were withdrawn west of Shanhaikwan, the Japanese military would not enter the withdrawal area, except when the lives and property of Japanese residents in North China and the safety of Japanese troops stationed in North China were seriously endangered. Observers here noted that the mention of North China in Ayasawa's cable was noteworthy. Several interpretations were made of this meaning, believing that Ayasawa indicated that actions for the safety of Japanese residents would not be limited to the three northeastern provinces. The Chinese delegation here has not received a definite message on Honjo's military actions. Nanjing official telegrams stated that Japan had already invaded Raoyanghe and was advancing towards Jinzhou, and a front-line urgent message was received stating that the Japanese military had occupied Dagushan and Goubangzi. Dr. Shih is meeting with the drafting committee of the Council, but it is heard that Dr. Shih is unwilling to accept any resolution of the Council unless he receives the most definite news that the Japanese military has retreated to Shenyang. As for the proposed modifications to the resolution suggested by Dr. Shih, he will demand a stipulation on the withdrawal period. The twelve council members held a closed meeting today from 5:10 to 6:40 p.m. before adjourning. (National News Agency Dispatch, 29th)</p>

As for the Japanese withdrawal order, it is heard that Chief of Staff Kanaya issued it to Honjo to avoid further hostile actions that Briand had warned against. However, the Ministry of the Army still announced that if Chinese troops were to threaten the South Manchurian Railway and cause disturbances to public order in the future, the Japanese military authorities would still take appropriate military actions, and solemnly declared that the Japanese troops currently advancing towards Jinzhou have stopped east of the Liao River.

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Note to Japan</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent another note to the Japanese ambassador, Shigemitsu Mamoru, on the 28th regarding the recent attempts by the Japanese to disturb the situation in Tianjin. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the note, according to a report from the local official of Tianjin, on the evening of the 26th of this month, at around 8 p.m., several dozen plainclothes thugs were discovered near the Japanese military camp at Haiguang Temple in Tianjin, attacking us. At around 9 p.m., there was also a plainclothes thug attack within the boundaries of the Sixth Precinct of the First District. The Chinese police immediately took legitimate defense measures and notified the Japanese consul and the Japanese military authorities, but the Japanese side used the excuse that stray bullets had fallen on the Japanese military camp and suddenly opened fire on the territory under Chinese jurisdiction, a total of more than forty rounds. The Japanese military attacked very fiercely. After repeated negotiations, it did not ease up until 12 a.m. And at around 1 a.m. on the 27th, thugs and the Japanese military resumed their attack, and at around 5 a.m., shell and grenade attacks were very fierce in the Huaiqing Li area. At around 6:30 a.m., the Japanese military in Nanguan Xiatou even used machine guns to fire at us. At around 8 a.m., the Japanese military in the Southeast Corner used machine guns to sweep the area. This time, the Chinese police have confirmed that four people have been killed and more than twenty people have been injured by the artillery fire. At around 9 a.m., the Japanese military forced our police to withdraw from the Sixth Precinct of the First District. The current situation is still extremely tense. It has been found that in the previous incident, the Japanese concession in Tianjin assisted thugs in attacking the area under Chinese jurisdiction, and our government has repeatedly protested severely. Now, the above situation has occurred again, and the Japanese side has fired as many as forty artillery shells and used machine guns to sweep the area. The places where the thugs were discovered are all close to or adjacent to the Japanese concession. The Japanese government should bear significant responsibility for the serious situation that has occurred in Tianjin. We are therefore protesting severely again, requesting that the Japanese government instruct the Japanese concession authorities and the Japanese garrison in Tianjin not to fire guns or cannons on the territory under Chinese jurisdiction under any circumstances and not to allow thugs to use the concession to attack Chinese police and administrative agencies again. The Chinese government also reserves the right to make legitimate demands. This note is sent to your Excellency for your reference and action. (Special Dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Financial Emergency and the Responsibility of the Chinese People <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Our city has seen a large outflow of silver in recent days. It is estimated that nearly eight million yuan has been exported. As a result, the money market is extremely tight. The market has suddenly shown signs of panic, and society is also feeling uneasy. In recent days, the municipal government has discussed, the silver firms have consulted, and the financial community has held meetings. All believe that the turmoil in Tianjin has caused public unrest. Many citizens are storing cash, and foreign banks are also absorbing a large amount of silver dollars. Therefore, the biggest reason for the financial emergency is the impact of the current situation. If this inference is indeed true, then we must recognize that the Chinese people have not yet fully understood the nation's crisis and their own responsibility to the country. In other words, they have not yet fully realized how closely and inseparably they are related to the nation.</p>
<p>The nation is currently plagued by internal floods and threatened by external enemies. The chance of survival hangs by a thread. This is precisely the time when responsible citizens, those with strength, should contribute their strength, and those with wealth should contribute their wealth to overcome the national crisis together. At this time, only the interests of the nation and the interests of the people matter. Individuals should embrace the spirit of absolute sacrifice to overcome the national crisis. Only by overcoming the national crisis can individual difficulties be resolved, and only by safeguarding the interests of the nation can individual interests be obtained. For a nation is like a boat carrying its people; if the boat sinks, all aboard will drown. If the nation perishes, all its people will become slaves. This principle is clear. To take a step back, society is a whole organization, and all social strata are inextricably linked. The prosperity or decline of one part directly or indirectly affects the prosperity or decline of the entire society. Therefore, merely seeking one's own well-being while ignoring the suffering of the entire society is also unacceptable to reality.</p>
<p>Today, due to the tense situation, people are rushing to withdraw and store cash, and many are storing large amounts of cash in foreign banks. We infer that their psychology is, "If I can deposit money in a foreign bank, even if there is prolonged turmoil in the country, I will not suffer any panic," or "Even if the country is destroyed and the nation is enslaved, I can still be a wealthy person living under someone else's roof." Alas, this very thought is enough to destroy our country and enslave our people. If anyone holds this thought, they must admit that their heart is dead, their blood is frozen, and their vitality is exhausted. They must also admit that they are willing to be slaves of a fallen nation without regret.</p>
<p>The financial emergency will inevitably cause panic in our market to expand day by day. Moreover, the panic in the market will inevitably affect the economic boycott movement against Japan. Therefore, this is not only due to the impact of the current situation, but also to the conspiracy of the Japanese to disrupt our market and undermine our economic boycott movement. We should be keenly aware of this conspiracy and prevent its realization. The only weapon is the patriotic fervor in every Chinese person.</p>
<p>With the national crisis at hand, overcoming the crisis is the responsibility of the Chinese people. Each of us is a cell of the nation, and the nation is where each of us is rooted. There is an individual only after there is a nation. When the skin survives, the hair attaches to it. The lives of the people of a fallen nation are in the hands of others. What more is there to say about external wealth? Looking at the world, there is no shortage of precedents. This is something the Chinese people must realize first.</p>
<p>With the national crisis pressing, the market must not be allowed to be disrupted in any way. Even minor things, such as the arrival of winter, must not be allowed to inflict this blow on the market, causing it to be even more bleak and increasing the risk of winter disasters. Therefore, the Chinese people should all pay attention to this issue and, in particular, display patriotic fervor to prevent this crisis. From now on, if anyone abandons himself to the Chinese people and stores large amounts of cash in foreign banks, it would be no different from Yuan Jinkai and Xi Qia's open betrayal of the country. Our financial community should monitor them closely, and the entire nation should rise up and impose effective sanctions on them.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Japanese Withdrawal of Troops Attacking Jinzhou <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The reason for Japan's sudden withdrawal of troops attacking Jinzhou this time is no more than two points. One is that Japan knows that the Chinese side will not agree to the resolution of the League of Nations without withdrawing its troops. Therefore, it first made a big show of attacking Jinzhou, increasing military pressure and threatening our people to cause extreme panic. Then, it retreated and stopped the attack on Jinzhou to appease the Chinese people and give the appearance of complying with China's demand for troop withdrawal, so that China could use this as a way to step down and accept the resolution of the League of Nations' investigation team. This is a strategy to deceive China. The other is that the League of Nations has recently been eager to achieve its resolution and prevent its mask of peace from being broken. It is doing its best to persuade China to accept it. If Japan continues its attack on Jinzhou, it will inevitably make it more difficult for China to agree, and the opportunity to accept it will be further away. Therefore, the United States, Britain, and France have unanimously tried to stop Japan's attack on Jinzhou. Japan is afraid that holding on too firmly will provoke a backlash from the major powers. Under this mutual understanding, it is accommodating the League of Nations' opinion. This is another strategy to appease the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Japan's intention today is focused on winning the victory of the League of Nations' resolution, striving to occupy a sufficient foothold for activities in the resolution. On troop withdrawal, it insists on not setting a deadline. On investigation, it does not allow interference with its military operations. In the neutral zone, it insists on retaining Japanese residents, and if they encounter danger, the Japanese army can still enter. If these conditions are met, then not only will direct negotiations be able to go smoothly in everything in the future, but military action can also be carried out freely at any time. If it wants to attack Jinzhou, then attacking Jinzhou will have nothing to restrain it. Why rush today? Therefore, Japan must strive to achieve this new resolution quickly. To achieve it quickly, it may as well use the withdrawal of troops attacking Jinzhou as a strategy of seeming to release in order to capture. On the one hand, it is doing its best to harass in Tianjin, expanding the military scope of the Northeast to the military scope of North China, in order to increase the pressure of future direct negotiations. The Japanese are so cunning, and are there still Chinese people who are pleased with Japan's troop withdrawal?</p>

<h3 id="e16">League of Nations Drafting Committee <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Continued Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Resolution Expected to Pass on Wednesday</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Still Insists on Deadline for Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Both Chinese and Japanese Replies Have Been Sent to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Paris, although today is Sunday, the drafting committee of the League of Nations Council held a meeting at the French Foreign Ministry at 11:30 this morning. Japanese representative Ito delivered Japan's reply to the League of Nations resolution. It is heard that the content includes several proposed preventive amendments. Although Japan agrees to instruct the commander-in-chief to prohibit troops from advancing and hostile actions, it must be stipulated that if the Japanese army is attacked by bandits, it will fight back. Today, Chinese representative Shi sent a letter to Briand, informing him that China agrees to the Council's proposal to establish a neutral zone near Jinzhou. The Chinese representative received an official report stating that the Chinese government has instructed the military commander of Jinzhou to enter into an agreement with the foreign military observers there, etc. In addition, the British military observer in Qiqihar reported to the Council that the city is completely under the control of Japanese soldiers. Although there was no major chaos when the Japanese army entered the city, no Chinese personnel have been handling affairs to date. Most Japanese residents have returned, and the Japanese army does not appear to be advancing north. It is said that airplanes were sent to the northeast for reconnaissance the next day. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris, this morning, the League of Nations heard the news that an unexpected diplomatic incident between the United States and Japan has been resolved satisfactorily, which was greatly gratifying. This afternoon, the Council will still hold a secret meeting, and notices have been issued. Chinese and Japanese representatives will not attend, but Japanese representative Yoshizawa went to the drafting committee today to report Japan's attitude toward the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou. It is heard that the Japanese government generally expressed its approval. Yoshizawa also denied to the committee all reports that the Japanese army was advancing toward Jinzhou and denied that Japanese aircraft had dropped bombs there. He also announced that most of the Japanese army had withdrawn from Qiqihar. US Ambassador Dawes notified Briand today that the US Army Attaché in Japan is currently in the three northeastern provinces and has received instructions to cooperate closely with other neutral observers staying in Jinzhou. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris, since Japan has promised not to attack Jinzhou, the League of Nations Administrative Council is expected to agree on its proposal on Wednesday. This morning, the Administrative Council listened to Dr. Shi's opinion on this proposal. Shi still insisted that the Japanese army withdraw completely by a deadline and suggested that a period be stipulated without specifying a date. This suggestion was not supported by the members. The Administrative Council agreed to add a clause stipulating that when the investigation team arrives in Manchuria, it must report to the Administrative Council how far the Japanese army has withdrawn and whether China's plan to protect Japanese residents can be considered satisfactory. It is heard that the Administrative Council has temporarily passed this proposal this afternoon and is considering expanding the number of the investigation team. Someone proposed that the neutral observers in Jinzhou should be part of the investigation team. It is heard that the Administrative Council has rejected this, believing that the observers should cooperate with each other, exchange information, and report to their respective governments, and the governments will then forward the reports to the League of Nations. This approach seems to be more beneficial. Tomorrow morning, the drafting committee will meet with Yoshizawa to discuss the revisions. The Administrative Council will meet again in the afternoon, but Chinese and Japanese representatives will still not attend. Today, the British delegation submitted to the League of Nations Secretariat the British report on the recent events in Tianjin, stating that gunfire occurred in Tianjin on the evening of November 26, intermittently throughout the night, and stopped only in the morning. The Chinese side said that plainclothes teams attacked the Chinese police again, but the Japanese said that Chinese soldiers deliberately attacked the Japanese concession. The Japanese army used machine guns and light artillery. On the morning of November 27, several Japanese aircraft flew over Jinzhou. British observers saw that trenches had been dug in the strategic areas of Hushan on the Beining Railway line, but it was expected that the Chinese soldiers would not resist</p>

<p>Paris, the Chinese government's reply to the telegram from the Chairman of the Administrative Council on November 26 has been sent by representative Shi. The text is as follows: The Chinese government suggests that countries that can send observers to the vicinity of Jinzhou should issue the following instructions to the observers: (1) The observers should jointly study and delineate a neutral zone between the Chinese and Japanese armies or other systems that can avoid contact between the two armies. (2) The observers should jointly agree on a method to contact the commanders of the Chinese and Japanese armies in order to implement necessary measures. In order for these instructions to have beneficial results, the commander of the Chinese army will contact the observers. The Chinese government deeply thanks the Chairman of the Administrative Council and all members and immediately instructs the commander of the Chinese army in Jinzhou to take necessary measures with the observers to avoid contact between the Chinese and Japanese armies.

<h3 id="e17">Stimson's Statement <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Did Not Make Derogatory Remarks About Japan</p>
<p>Re-Publication of Previous Remarks</p>
<p>Japanese Side's Resentment Dissipated</p>
<p>League of Nations Investigates the Truth in Detail</p>
<p>Washington, Secretary of State Stimson stated when meeting with reporters today that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's opposition to comments not made by him was a misunderstanding. Stimson then gave the verbatim record of his conversation yesterday to the newspapers and stated that he was willing to take responsibility for his words. He said, "On November 23, I instructed the ambassador to Japan to inform Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara that I was very worried about the reports that the Japanese army commander was now planning to attack Chinese soldiers near Jinzhou. I sincerely hope that the reports are unfounded." The next day, the Japanese ambassador conveyed Shidehara's words, saying that he and the Army Minister and Chief of Staff had all agreed not to take hostile actions against Jinzhou and had issued military orders to that effect. "Looking at this reply, I cannot understand the news of Honjo's troops advancing in the reports," he said. Senator Swanson of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee met with the Secretary of State today and requested the publication of various documents issued by the United States regarding the Manchurian Incident.

<p>Tokyo, Japanese Ambassador to the United States Debuchi visited Stimson and Cassell on the morning of the 28th upon instructions from the Japanese government to inquire whether Mr. Shi had made the statements reported in the newspapers. (29th Japanese United News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington, the US State Department issued a statement today regarding the Japanese Foreign Ministry's accusation against US Secretary of State Stimson, stating that Mr. Shi had not made any remarks unfavorable to Japan. The US State Department also denied that Mr. Shi had stated that Japan had ambitions to seize all of Manchuria and that the Japanese army was acting like madmen in Manchuria. In short, the US Secretary of State had not made any critical remarks about the Japanese authorities. In Tokyo, the remarks were</p>
<p>made by a news agency that has a cooperation agreement with it. Therefore, the US partner agency is suspected of transmitting the remarks. However, in New York, officials of the partner agency stated that there were no such remarks circulating in the country or abroad. It has been found that reports on Stimson's remarks by news agencies in the United States are slightly different, but generally the same. The two major US news agencies, the United Press and the Associated Press, both believe that Stimson's clarification of the news transmitted by the Japanese United News Agency is indeed accurate. Stimson has now ordered the publication of his conversation with reporters last Friday, the original text of which is roughly the same as that transmitted by the Associated Press and the United Press. On that day, Stimson only told reporters that he had just received a telegram that the Japanese army was approaching Jinzhou, which was very surprising. Mr. Shi also said that on November 24, Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara had firmly stated that Japan would not attack Jinzhou. This statement was conveyed by US Ambassador to Japan Forbes. On Friday, Mr. Shi told reporters again that various countries were planning to send military attachés to Jinzhou, and the US military attaché from the US Embassy in Peiping, Magruder, was already in Jinzhou. At that time, there was no plan to establish a neutral zone around Jinzhou with Western troops, so the US State Department was unwilling to express anything about the establishment of the neutral zone or whether the United States would participate. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo, the temporary resentment in Japan against US Secretary of State Stimson's conversation with reporters has now dissipated. Official news from Washington denied that the US Secretary of State had made any remarks criticizing Japan, and public opinion has calmed down. It is said that false rumors caused misunderstandings, and both sides expressed regret. Although some people are worried that China's attitude toward Japan may become tougher due to these unfounded rumors, the misunderstanding has now ended, so the Foreign Ministry will not issue any statements in response to the falsely reported accusations made by Stimson. (29th Reuters Telegram) Paris, today, the League of Nations Council and people in the League of Nations are paying close attention to the unexpected attack incident between US Secretary of State Stimson and Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara. Although the League of Nations Secretariat has no official relationship, it has ordered a detailed investigation of the facts. League of Nations officials are keeping silent in accordance with diplomatic etiquette, but they said that Tokyo's reaction was too emotional and easily aroused criticism. However, this matter has a tendency to consolidate the position of the Council, because it shows that the US position is the same as the League of Nations' attitude.

<p>Urging Comrades in Guangdong to Enter the Capital as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to Wang Jingwei, and telegraphed the text to Cai, Zhang, Li, and other members, also to urge their departure. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to Wang Jingwei: To Mr. Wang Jingwei and all comrades in Guangdong, greetings. This time, public opinion throughout the country believes that only the unity of our party can save the country from the national crisis. It is not that the people are disgusted with our party, but rather that they believe that if our party is still divided, the national crisis will be even more unimaginable. Zhongzheng is apprehensive, so he specially sent Mr. Cai, Zhang, and Chen to Guangdong to present this idea. Fortunately, Mr. Wang and others shared this fear and agreed to come to Shanghai to form a united front. Zhongzheng also contributed his difficult views on unity at the Fourth Plenary Session. Fortunately, the comrades at the conference worked together to live up to the expectations of the people. All endured the pain and tears and resolutely compromised on the newly elected law and quickly completed the conference affairs. It has been more than a week since the adjournment of the conference. All this is to speed up the process of resisting the disaster through unity and dare not delay the days and mislead the party and the country. After the adjournment of the conference, I eagerly hope that the comrades in Guangdong will come to the capital within the month as agreed to immediately achieve the great benefit of collective wisdom. Then, in the face of a major disaster, compared with the ordinary support of the central government, there must be improvement. This is especially the unanimous public opinion today. But recently, I heard that the comrades in Guangdong have been meeting for half a month, and their opinions are still different, making unity impossible to achieve soon. This month is coming to an end, and time is running out. If there is no national crisis other than unity, then consideration can be cautious and delay will not be a big problem. But the Kou disaster is deepening and intensifying. The collective thinking of unity has not been gathered, and the credibility of the central government is falling. Mr. Wang and his comrades must deeply understand that the ordinary strategies are not suitable for joint measures. Then the old prescription will be shelved and the new agent will be delayed in dispensing. Like a critical illness, how can it be tolerated? Zhongzheng is rushing north to wait for the full meeting to open, so that he can be ordered to set out with a follow. Otherwise, the central plan will not be allowed to be informed by Zhongzheng before departure. If at that time there are still a few who cannot avoid the differences in Guangdong today, temporarily delaying the situation of mutual restraint, even if it is easy to correct, and the advancement has this concern of looking back, it is easy to fall into a situation where advancement and retreat are impossible. Then, the success or failure of the individual is not enough to care about, and misleading the country is a great crime. Therefore, I deeply hope that all comrades will be aware of the warning of fratricide and follow the purpose of resisting foreign insults, acting quickly to achieve the effect of unity through immediate assembly and rescue. The overall plan is decided by the central executive and supervisory plenary meeting. Mr. Wang is mediating the crisis, and I hope that he can invite nearby comrades to guide him as soon as possible. I hope even more that the comrades in Guangdong can tell me as soon as possible when they can arrive in Beijing so that the central plenary meeting can be held on time. I am waiting for your reply. Younger brother Chiang Kai-shek bows</p>
<p>(2) Telegram to Cai, Zhang, Li, etc.: To Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Zhang Puquan, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Zhenru, greetings. The telegram I sent to Jingwei earlier said, (see the previous omission), etc. I hope that you will earnestly urge the departure and come together as soon as possible. I am waiting expectantly.

<p>To Prohibit the Export of Silver</p>
<p>According to Nanjing financial circles, the Japanese are using various methods in the Tianjin area to undermine finances and are collecting silver dollars in Shanghai to transport to Dalian. Their intention is to reduce the amount of cash in circulation in our country and shake the silver market. Shanghai silver houses believe that the market needs a lot of cash because the accounting period for merchants is approaching. They ask to prevent the outflow as soon as possible, and in addition to taking measures to check it themselves, they also ask the Ministry of Finance to notify all customs to prohibit the export of silver. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance will implement this in the near future. In addition, due to the lack of cash in the markets of Hankou and Jinan, the provincial and municipal authorities have announced a ban on the export of silver dollars and large remittances and have submitted this to the Ministry of Finance for record.

<p>To be Convened in Geneva Next February</p>
<p>Delegates from Various Countries Sing the Praises of Peace</p>
<p>But are Greatly Insulted in Paris</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Geneva, 26th: The Secretariat of the League of Nations recently stated that the rumors that the Disarmament Conference will be postponed are completely unfounded. The Secretariat stated that no country has requested the postponement of the Disarmament Conference so far, nor has this issue been raised in any way. Preparations for the conference are proceeding with great effort, and the Swiss postal authorities have also made special arrangements for this matter to facilitate direct communication between the various delegations and governments and to provide special convenience for journalists. It is expected that hundreds of journalists will gather here at that time. At the same time, regarding the issue of disarmament, France has expressed difficulties regarding the prospects for disarmament, insisting that it is unwilling to reduce its armaments slightly without sufficient guarantees. Recently, the International Disarmament Discussion Meeting was held in Paris, and the British representative, Seir Cecil and others, were surrounded by anti-disarmament rioters, who insulted and scolded them. Seir Cecil and others are all people of great renown who advocate international peace, but now they have been insulted by rioters in a foreign capital. Therefore, many German newspapers have criticized this, saying, "If a Frenchman went to Berlin to promote peace and friendship and was subjected to such insults, would the French newspapers remain silent?" It is also reported that the five people who were arrested at the meeting due to the riots have now been released, which is also enough to leave an unpleasant impression.</p>

<p>To Fill the Revenue Shortfall</p>
<p>The Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: The Ministry of Finance decided yesterday afternoon to issue a huge amount of public bonds and increase tax rates to fill the shortfall in the next year's revenue budget. The Minister of Finance will first consult with the cabinet tomorrow, and then discuss with the party executives. The final decision will be made at the cabinet meeting on December 4th. (1) "Form of Public Bond Issuance": In addition to the original telephone bonds and post-earthquake reconstruction bonds, the public bonds used to supplement revenue and the unemployment bonds will be considered general accounting and will all be attributed to the public bonds used to fill revenue shortfalls. (2) "Tax Increase Rate": (A) Income Tax: (1) Comprehensive income tax will be increased by 1.5 percentage points on the current rate of 5 percent to 6.5 percent. (2) The second type of income tax will be increased by 1 percentage point on the current rate of 4 percent to 5 percent. (3) The third type of income tax will be increased by 10 percent. (B) The capital interest tax will be increased by 1.5 percentage points to 3 percent. Other inheritance taxes and gasoline taxes will remain at the current rates. (3) The total amount of tax increase is 40 million yuan, but the amount of tax increase is 5 million yuan less than the planned amount, and the amount of public bonds is more than the planned amount, namely (1) deficit bonds of 60 million yuan and (2) unemployment bonds of 45 million yuan, totaling 110 million yuan.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 28th: The final plenary session of the Indian Round Table Conference began today. The chairman, Sankey, and the British Prime Minister, MacDonald, said that in order to make the work of the conference public, they intend to formally propose to pass the reports of the Federal Structure Committee and the Minorities Committee. There are currently fifty delegates requesting to speak, so the conference will have to be extended until Tuesday to conclude. The British Prime Minister will report on the British government's policy towards India before the end. Sankey said that the Federal Structure Committee has approved the committee's report, but the representatives of Muslims and other minorities have reserved their opinions on national defense, diplomacy, finance, and commerce, and will only withdraw their reservations after the minority issues have been satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>The National News Agency, London, 28th: British Prime Minister MacDonald held the first conference of the second Indian Round Table Conference at 10:30 this morning in the Queen Anne reception hall of St. James's Palace. One hundred and five delegates were present and sat around the round table. MacDonald gave the opening speech. Meetings will continue this afternoon and evening, but Gandhi may not have the opportunity to speak until Monday.

<p>Actively Preventing Gandhi's Movement</p>
<p>Havas, Bombay, 28th: Gandhi's movement is about to happen again. The Indian government has begun to take preventive measures and has deployed troops at important military locations for defense. This force is assisted by tanks and aircraft and can take a strong offensive when necessary to avoid the danger of most white troops facing hostile actions in densely populated areas. The Indian government is setting up radio stations in important cities and towns along various railway lines for mutual communication because railway, telegraph, and telephone personnel may go on strike. Gandhi seems to be using opposition to taxes as an excuse to repeat the non-resistance movement. The various taxes were originally intended to be reduced separately, but due to recent financial difficulties, they have been increased instead, which has caused dissatisfaction among the people. Gandhi's request at the National Congress for a review of the rights acquired by the British on tea, mines, rubber, ships, land, and various patents has only made the British more united and formed a united front. According to the two representatives who returned from the Round Table Conference, the failure of this conference was actually due to Gandhi's excessive demands. It is also rumored that Gandhi has been suffering from a cold for several days, but he still attended the Round Table Conference today. Gandhi's condition is not worth worrying about at all, and rumors cannot be believed.</p>

Correspondence address: Central University, Nanjing,</p>
<p>Lanzhou to all newspaper offices, formerly Gansu Province had differences between military and civilian chiefs, resulting in disputes. At that time, all circles in the province, including the party, government, military, agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia, convened a joint meeting and publicly elected Lei Zhongtian as the Commander-in-Chief of Security for Gansu Province. They also publicly elected Ma Wenche and other thirteen people as members to organize the Gansu Provisional Provincial Government, with Ma Wenche concurrently serving as acting chairman, to temporarily maintain order and avoid the interruption of provincial affairs. It has already been reported by telegram. Later, Qinghai Chairman Ma Lin came forward as a mediator and obtained a considerable understanding from all parties. Recently, General Wu Ziyu came to Lanzhou from Sichuan, and his words are worth their weight in gold. He immediately released private grievances and held a friendly banquet, restoring friendly relations. After further discussion, it was agreed that Ma Hongbin would lead the 7th Division back to Ningxia, and Lei Zhongtian's troops would be stationed in Lanzhou to handle the aftermath, and everything would be referred to the Central Government. All the people of Gansu are grateful for the mediation of General Wu and the Chairman of Qinghai and should respectfully report it by telegram. They also urge the Central Government to quickly decide on the aftermath of Gansu Province for easy compliance. Furthermore, the Japanese寇 are invading the east, and the nation is about to perish. Patriots are planning peaceful unification and jointly resisting foreign insults, and the generals of Qinghai, Ningxia, Sichuan, and Gansu provinces are sending joint telegrams to request General Wu to come out of the mountains to preside over foreign military affairs. It is believed that General Wu is an old statesman who, although retired in Sichuan for many years, has a heart of patriotism and concern for the people. As evidenced by the mediation of the Gansu situation, it is clear that Lian Po is still heroic and capable of killing thieves despite his age. If he rises again in Jinghan, he will be able to defend the country. People with the duty of everyone to protect the country, dare to express sincerity and be willing to be ghosts after death, rather than slaves in life. The Central Government and the people of the whole country are asked to unite and urge, so as to initiate the people's spirit and build the purpose of saving the country. At the time of the telegram, we are saddened and respectfully report our heartfelt words. We ask for your attention and await your instruction.

<h3 id="e59">Japanese Troops Again Distort Tianjin <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>First, Plainclothes Troops are Sent to Cause Disturbances</p>
<p>Then Japanese Troops Immediately Fire Artillery into the Chinese Territory</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the Chinese and Japanese authorities agreed to withdraw defenses, in order to maintain the security of Tianjin and the lives and property of merchants of all countries, we have compromised and resolutely withdrawn defenses first. However, the Japanese concession authorities have made various excuses to deliberately delay until now, and have failed to remove defensive works as agreed. On the contrary, they have secretly stepped up military deployments, a large number of marines have entered Tianjin from Tanggu in disguise, and they continue to recruit plainclothes troops and hide them in the Haiguang Temple barracks, attempting to revive. Recently, it was heard that two ships of ammunition were secretly transported to Tianjin from Tanggu by hired civilian ships. Hara, the mastermind of the last incident, has also sneaked into Tianjin again. Therefore, rumors have been spreading in the city in recent days, and people are panicked. Yesterday afternoon, the situation became more and more serious, and disturbances by plainclothes thugs occurred again at night. Although the number of thugs was not as large as last time, the Japanese troops fired artillery like a string of beads, which was even more serious than on the evening of the 8th. The initial gunfire was at 8:14, and half an hour later, the entire city heard artillery fire, which became denser after 10:00. It subsided slightly around 12:00 for a short time, and then started again after 1:00 this morning. The artillery fire continued until about 3:00. The plainclothes troops were divided into two groups. One group of about twenty or thirty people was first discovered in Potaizhuang and was quickly repulsed. The other group, it was heard, had more than a hundred people and wanted to attack the Public Security Bureau from the Zhakou direction, but was also repulsed. First, gunfire was discovered in Xiguangkai at 8:14. At 8:15, it was identified that there were thirty or forty plainclothes troops south of Huaiqingli, firing guns at our side. At 8:20, an artillery shell suddenly fired from the Japanese barracks, with a loud bang, shocking the entire city. At 8:24, twenty or thirty plainclothes troops were discovered again in the Xiaotili area of Potaizhuang near Haiguang Temple in the Sixth District of the Second District, firing at our police on duty. Our security team rushed to the scene and retaliated with hand-held grenades to prevent bullets from falling into the concession. At that time, the louder sound than the gunfire was hand-held grenades, not artillery shells. Section Chief Shen of the Municipal Government immediately notified the Japanese consul of the discovery of plainclothes troops everywhere. At 9:14, the Japanese concession's electricity was completely cut off, and the French and Italian concessions also temporarily imposed martial law, prohibiting pedestrians from traveling, and dispatched armed police and police officers. At 9:26, bullets suddenly fired from the roof of the Zhongyuan Company, firing at the Chinese territory. At 9:49, Japanese troops used machine guns and artillery to fiercely attack the Chinese territory from the Zhakou direction, shaking off a window of the Telephone Bureau. The wall of the exchange room of the Telephone Bureau was destroyed by artillery shells, and the machine was also damaged, but the workers did not leave the bureau. The back wall of the 15th squadron of the South Xiejie Security Team was also destroyed by artillery fire. An artillery shell landed on Dongmalu, killing three policemen. Another three artillery shells landed behind the wall of the Provincial Government. At 10:24, the Japanese troops in the Zhakou area fired dozens of small steel cannons at the Chinese territory. At the same time, Haiguang Temple also fired guns and artillery shells, landing more than ten on Dongmalu and more than ten on Ningjia Bridge, wounding one of our policemen. Three artillery shells landed near the Jinjiayao power plant in the Fifth District of the First District, two artillery shells landed at the Fourth District Public Office on Dajing Road, and one artillery shell landed at the Provincial Government. At 2:30 this morning, the artillery fire sounded again, followed by gunfire, and the situation was very serious. Until 3:30, the Japanese troops' artillery and guns attacked the Chinese territory every few minutes. After receiving the news, the municipal and provincial authorities immediately convened a meeting to discuss measures and telegraphed the deputy commander's office in Beiping to request instructions.</p>
<p>The Sixth District of the Second District was taken over by our side by Section Chief Ge Jiaqi of the Fifth District of the First District, in coordination with Section Chief Pan Enrong of the Sixth District of the Second District. After negotiations with Captain Matsushita, the area commander of the Japanese troops in Haiguang Temple, it was returned. However, all documents and seals were gone. Therefore, the takeover of the Sixth District of the Second District was only an empty building. The items inside the building were empty, and local police affairs could not be carried out. Although it is called a takeover, it is actually still occupied by Japanese troops. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter went to the area of the Sixth District of the Second District to inspect. Passing the west entrance of Luan Street, the defensive line set up by the Japanese was still there. In front was a barbed wire fence, and behind it were several layers of earthworks. The Japanese flag was flying in the wind, and three or four Japanese soldiers were patrolling with guns. The situation was no different from before the takeover. I saw a hole through which people could pass, but they had to be inspected by the Japanese troops before they could pass. In the Sixth District of the Second District, only Inspector Xing led six or seven policemen stationed inside the station, and there were two doormen outside. There were no Chinese police on the street. Thirty or forty Japanese soldiers who withdrew from the Sixth District of the Second District the day before forcibly occupied civilian houses about three feet north of the station. The entire street was completely under the influence of the Japanese police. In general, the Japanese side's defensive lines were not removed everywhere, and it was clear that there were other conspiracies. Another serious incident occurred last night, which shows that the Japanese troops in the Sixth District of the Second District insisted on not returning it, which was actually kept as a base for hiding plainclothes troops.

<h3 id="e60">Zhang Jinghui Does Not Go to Heilongjiang <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Harbin Already Within Japanese Sphere of Influence</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Stationed in Hailun Reorganizing Troops</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Zhang Jinghui's trip to Heilongjiang has been called off. Today, Zhang told Mu Weitang, representative of the Harbin General Chamber of Commerce, and Zhang Xiangting, president of the Binjiang Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who came to visit, that "My initial intention was to go to Heilongjiang to seek a relief strategy due to Chairman Ma Zhanshan's military actions against the Japanese army and the dangerous situation. Now that the matter has passed and mediation is impossible, I have abandoned the idea of going to Heilongjiang. The rumors outside about my intentions or secret trip to Heilongjiang are all speculation. As for Harbin, it is located in the center of the Northeast and is extremely important. The Japanese army may not necessarily want to come here. In order to maintain the security of Harbin, I have to take precautions to prevent the Japanese army from coming and avoid unexpected events for the local area. In recent days, I have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Consul in Harbin, showing my intention to maintain local security and being responsible for protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents, requesting the Japanese army not to mobilize to Harbin. At that time, the Japanese Consul immediately telegraphed the military authorities of his country, and they replied satisfactorily to my proposal, saying that since Harbin does not take hostile actions against Japan, the Japanese army will definitely not mobilize to Harbin. The rumors outside that the Japanese army will come to Harbin on the 25th are purely rumors." According to the current situation in Harbin, it is still relatively stable, but according to general speculation, even if the Japanese army does not send a large team to Harbin, it will definitely increase the number of police and military police at the consulate or force the reorganization of various agencies and send Japanese advisors to monitor them separately. Although Harbin is not hostile to the Japanese army, the Japanese side may not be able to tolerate the existence of the old system of various agencies, because the Japanese Consulate is now acting as the owner and interfering in everything. What is most disappointing here are the general White Russian newspapers. When the Fang Shen Incident occurred, the White Russian newspapers all published news favorable to the Japanese side, and the Japanese Consulate also fully supplied materials. After the fall of Heihe, the attitude of the Japanese Consulate changed drastically, changing its usual gentleness to a fierce demeanor. Recently, it was reported that all Russian reporters were summoned, and Consul Tadakazu Oohashi gave them a lecture, warning that future news reports must be approved by the consulate and first be checked. All the Russian reporters were very frustrated by this lesson. After receiving this news, the general White Russians, who intended to use Japanese power to incite chaos, knew that tigers and wolves could not be co-operated, and their plan to conquer Northern Manchuria was shelved. Since Zhang Jinghui stopped going to Heilongjiang, the Japanese side used the lower-class officials and gentry of Heihe to organize an autonomous maintenance association, led by Zhao Zhongren, the former Daoyin of Hulunbuir and current provincial committee member, Li Yintang, the former Speaker of the Provincial Assembly and current provincial committee member, and Liu Dequan, the chief of police of Heilongjiang Province. They have decided to work in the former Provincial Assembly on the 25th. Zhao has been plotting the Heihe government for many years and can now take charge of everything. In Heihe, the Japanese army started to set up checkpoints on all streets on the 23rd to check pedestrians. Those who responded slightly slower were lightly beaten and humiliated, forced to kneel in the street, and severely shot to death. They also ordered the Chamber of Commerce to guide the Japanese army to check household registrations. Every time they entered a household, they arbitrarily teased women. If they found military agency name cards, they would arrest the head of the household and take him away. Many people have been arrested for this reason in recent days. Due to the oppression of the Japanese army, all shops opened completely on the 24th, but the shop assistants sat listlessly behind the counters with sad faces, without a single customer all day long. On the evening of the 23rd, a traveler, Mr. Jia, took the Qiong-Ang Road train to the Ang'angxi Station of the East Railway. The train was checked by the Japanese army, and a military uniform was found in his luggage. He was accused of being a soldier, and without explanation, he was stabbed to death with bayonets. The general passengers were shocked, but fearing the barbarity of the Japanese soldiers, no one dared to intercede for him. At present, all the valuables in the residences of important people in Heihe have been loaded and transported to South Manchuria via the Tao'ang Road. In recent days, Japanese planes have continued to scout the retreating Heilongjiang army on the Qiqihar-Koshan Road. On the 24th, they flew to Baiquan once, but due to heavy fog, they could not hover as they wished and returned. A large group of Japanese cavalry stopped at the Ningnian Station on the Qiqihar-Koshan Road, and another group stopped at the Zhongxing Town on the Bokui-Hailun Road. Because the mountains and forests ahead were continuous and the terrain was unfamiliar, they did not dare to advance. At this time, the Heilongjiang army may have a chance to reorganize. It is said that the temporary provincial government of Heilongjiang, established by Ma Zhanshan in Hailun, started working on the 24th. Because the staff of various departments have not yet arrived, it is difficult to divide the work in practice, so eight major departments, including industry, education, finance, politics, intelligence, secretarial, police, and military affairs, are temporarily established in the provincial government to carry out preliminary reorganization. In about a week, the provincial committee and the staff of various departments should arrive, and the old regulations will be restored. The troops currently retreating to Hailun include 5,000 infantry under Yuan Chonggu, 1,000 cavalry each under Cheng Zhiyuan, Wu Songshan, and Zhang Dianjiu, 2,000 infantry under Su Bingwen, and 1,000 guards and pistol teams under Ma Zhanshan. More than 2,000 militiamen from Baiquan, Qinggang, Tiebi, Mulan and other places have also arrived, and they are being supplemented and incorporated into the regular army by various brigades. Ma is also afraid that the Japanese army will attack, so he ordered the Yuan and Wu brigades to be distributed on the Suihua-Hailun section of the Huhuai Road and outside Hailun City. If the Japanese army advances further, the war will break out. Recently, many young people from various places, motivated by righteous indignation, have gone to join the army. Ma has accepted them and selected officers with excellent academic skills to train them in order to supplement the various brigades. Tonight, the soldiers of the 10th company of the 3rd battalion of the 671st regiment of the Jilin army's Xing Zhanqing brigade stationed at the Xiaohaizi Station on the Manchu line mutinied, led by the logistics officer, killing the company and platoon leaders and fleeing to Hailun to join Ma's troops. A company of the Jilin army's Su Dechen brigade stationed in Fularji also fled to join Ma's troops, which shows that the military's hearts are filled with hatred for the enemy and they are extremely dissatisfied with their commander's policy of non-resistance.

<h3 id="e61">Anxious People in Shenyang <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Military and Police Search Extensively Inside and Outside the City</p>
<p>Hwangutun and Julu River Busy with Military Transport</p>
<p>Shenyang-Hai Road Vehicles Concentrated in Plan to Attack Jinzhou</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: In recent days, the Japanese army has claimed that there have been many robbery cases on various streets inside and outside the city. Starting from 5:30 every night, they send many soldiers in groups to search everywhere. Any Chinese walking late at night are shot to death. There are several such cases every day. Merchants and residents inside and outside the city do not go out on the streets after 6:00 in the evening. Since last night (23rd), Japanese troops and Chinese police have been added to guard each city gate, and pedestrians entering and leaving are subjected to strict checks, and people are extremely panicked. The pseudo-agencies established in recent days, such as the finance, education, and industry bureaus and the Northeast Communications Committee, were previously guarded by Chinese police. Recently, Japanese troops have been added, and they look very fierce when Chinese people pass by, like fierce tigers staring at sheep.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the incident, the Japanese have taken advantage of the situation to make profits. Many business restaurants (i.e., brothels) have been established inside and outside the city. Recently, an official restaurant (official prostitute) has been established in the Binggongchang Club, and Japanese military police have found prostitutes to serve the Japanese soldiers. Now, Chinese brothels in the industrial area and the north and south markets must be approved by the Japanese before they are allowed to operate. The Japanese side has issued a notice that Japanese soldiers are not allowed to be charged or refused when they go to visit.</p>
<p>The walls of various streets inside and outside the city and in the concession area are covered with proclamations and slogans of General Shigeru Honjo, Commander of the Kwantung Army, which mainly say "Determined not to withdraw troops," "Oppose troop withdrawal and troop request," "Open door and co-prosperity," etc. Outside the Xiaoxibianmen Park and in the Beishichang and Dongta areas, the Japanese have ordered thugs to openly set up gambling dens, and there are many gamblers.</p>
<p>In the concession area, many small barracks have been newly built, starting from Jiuwei Road. Women in nearby residents are mostly raped by the Japanese. Those who refuse are often brutally killed.</p>
<p>The 6th, 39th, and battalion regiments of the infantry of the Suzuki Mixed Brigade stationed in Dongdaying and the Binggonglian squad arrived at Hwangutun Station at about 3:00 pm yesterday. Under the pretext of suppressing bandits in the west, they actually planned to attack Jinzhou. They asked Hwangutun Station for a train to drive west. Xu Duanzhang, the head of the station, tried to find a solution, but the Japanese armored train had already arrived at Julu River on the night before (22nd), fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, and is now parked at the station. The station is surrounded by iron nets and piled with sandbags (because they have frozen). Julu River to Shenyang has also been temporarily set up by the Japanese army with military telephones. The west bank of Julu River is equipped with electric nets, and two small cannons are erected on the soil slope on the east bank. Honjo Shigeru has ordered the vehicles on the Shenyang-Hai Road to be concentrated in Shenyang and used entirely for transporting troops. Six-foot-tall wooden villages are planted in the area from Hwangutun to Masanjiazi, with the words "Showa Agricultural Company leased land." According to the farmers, passage is prohibited where there are villages. (Can be sent on November 24)</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Common People of the Qing Banner in the Old Capital <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Declaration Against Puyi's Restoration</p>
<p>Swear to Defend Democratic Politics to the Death</p>
<p>Those Who Go Against the Tide Will Destroy Themselves</p>
<p>Dai Purun, Guan Lunyan, and other representatives of the common people of the Qing banner in Peiping, together with ten million common people of the Qing banner, issued a declaration yesterday, vowing to defend democratic politics to the death and denying that Puyi and his royalist remnants use the name of the Manchu people to implement the imperial system. The original text of the declaration is disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>The Manchu people originated from the Sushen. During the time of Tang Yao and Yu Shun, they had already communicated with China. History records that they have been here for a long time. Compared with the various states of the Spring and Autumn Period, they are like Qin, Chu, Wu, Yue, and Qi, Jin, Yan, and Zhao. This is originally a branch and descendant of the Han people, and there is no distinction to be made. Moreover, the places where they live are all Chinese land and belong to one body, which can further prove this. Since the Middle Ages, the Xianbei and Donghu have appeared in the Yellow River and Yangtze River regions for many years. Although there have been many gaps with the Chinese scholars and officials, it is only because of the emergence of one or two ambitious people as leaders. What does this have to do with the common people of the Qing banner? Moreover, confusion and migration have led to the integration of Manchus and Hans, growing together and mutually reinforcing each other. After thousands of years, their racial blood has become assimilated and indistinguishable. It has been like this for a long time. The Aisin Gioro clan ruled the Eight Banners and came to China, striving to distinguish between Manchus and Hans in order to consolidate the foundation of autocracy and benefit from their mutual hatred. However, considering the reality, those who wielded the power of rule were purely members of the Aisin Gioro clan (that is, the so-called Manchu Qing royal family). The common people of the Qing banner were also ruled and exploited. Examining its origins, the so-called Eight Banners were composed of the Siber Mongols, Bargus, Solons, Ichman Manchus, Nikan Wailans, Yehes, and other tribes, as well as the Han army, Boye, border platforms, post stations, and other people. It is like organizing divisions and brigades and deploying teams. However, the name of the Banner People originated from this. They were given bows and arrows, taught horse riding and archery, and led to the front line, fighting bravely. They ended their lives as soldiers, only receiving dozens of strings of grain. Moreover, they had to abide by the rules of their banner. If they crossed a hundred li, they would be treated as fugitives, causing our people to be trapped to death. It was not only difficult to seek knowledge, but also the inherent spirit of perseverance, martial arts, and courage was worn away. It is truly regrettable. However, those who held high ranks, generous salaries, and titles were all Beizi, Beile, Prince, Duke, and Marquis. Those who inherited official positions were all members of the royal family and relatives. They sat high and mighty, exercising power and influence, living in extravagance, and displaying great arrogance. Eventually, during the Guangxu Restoration, they took a small step towards constitutionalism, but it was destroyed by Empress Dowager Cixi and the royal family. This shows that the princes and ministers of the Qing dynasty were stubborn and ignorant, and their corruption had reached its extreme. As for the Banner Soldiers, they were reduced to servants, suffering from hunger, cold, and disease, with no one to care for them. Pressed by livelihood, how could they have time to improve themselves? As a result, the rich became richer, the poor became poorer, the noble became nobler, and the lowly became lowlier. The gap between the classes was as different as heaven and earth. Having already become poor and miserable Banner Soldiers, they also suffered the discrimination of their own kind. During the Xinhai Revolution, countless people died with grievances. Alas, the common people of the Qing banner were only burdened with empty names and suffered real disasters. How could they complain about the hidden pain in their hearts? After the founding of the Republic of China, the political system became republican. The abdicated emperor was still treated favorably. With faith, righteousness, peace, and the world for all, the people of the Qing banner all entered the door of equality and fraternity and roamed in the realm of civilization and reform. For the past twenty years, there has never been a case of seeking separation from the outside world. This is what all of us common people of the Qing banner sincerely unite and can openly announce to our compatriots across the country without shame. It is also due to thousands of years of marriage and the same language and writing, which have led to assimilation. Alas, it is best to live in peace and avoid danger. If you want to seek more happiness, do not create your own misfortune. The abdicated Puyi and his royal family should all live peacefully, live their civilian lives, and share the happiness of the republic. Unexpectedly, it has recently been heard that they have been seduced by Japanese imperialists and are about to ascend the throne and declare themselves emperor. Such confusion, madness, foolishness, and rebellion will ultimately lead to their own destruction, which is the inevitable result. However, in order to express our fundamental opposition to this, we, the common people of the Qing banner, hereby solemnly declare in all sincerity: Puyi's perverse actions are purely the ambition of the Aisin Gioro royal family and its lackeys, and by no means the public opinion of our ten million Banner People. We swear to defend democratic politics and oppose the restoration of the imperial system. As for their borrowing the name of the Manchu people to claim independence, seceding from China, and willingly betraying the country, it is intolerable by national law. We respectfully request public discernment in tears.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Wuhan Regularly Inspects Japanese Goods <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since Japanese Navy Commander Shiozawa left Hankou, the situation between China and Japan seems to have eased slightly on the surface. However, upon closer inspection, the Japanese side is still actively working together from top to bottom to plot against us. According to a report from a certain party, the Japanese side has decided to launch an attack in Hankou and other ports on the 6th of next month, which is credible when evidenced by the secret burying of landmines in Hankou. As for the people of Wuhan, under the restraint of the authorities, they are still accumulating strength to avoid conflict with the Japanese, and the only method of movement is to boycott Japanese goods. The recent actions of the Japanese residents in Hankou, the process of negotiations with the officialdom, and the progress of the people's inspection of Japanese goods are recorded below.</p>
<p>Japanese Secretly Burying Landmines: The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters issued an order to the Hankou Municipal Government on the 28th, stating that according to the report of Wang Shijie, the director of the Hankou Public Security Bureau, Tan Zuoxiao, the captain of the Second Brigade of the Security Bureau, reported on the 23rd of this month that Li Zhaonan, the chief of the 7th platoon of the temporary soldier sentry of the Overseas Chinese Hotel, reported that at about 4:00 pm on the 21st, two Japanese men, dressed in suits, each carrying a small circular iron box, resembling a landmine, followed two Chinese men and went straight to the wall of the Mitsubishi Yoko company to bury them, and left after a while. It was specifically reported for review. Based on this, we immediately went to investigate and inquired with nearby residents. All residents confirmed that the Japanese men buried iron boxes, but it was still difficult to determine whether they were landmines. During this serious diplomatic period, both the real and the virtual should be prevented. In addition to reporting the investigation situation to the commander of the Third District, who forwarded it for verification, and ordering prevention, we also strictly ordered the sentries in that area to pay special attention, keep a distance, and avoid danger. The above situation should be submitted in writing for verification, and we earnestly request that it be transferred to find a way to prevent and maintain order. Based on this, the reported sections concern the security of Hankou City, and it is urgent to consult with the Japanese Consul to dig out and inspect clearly. If they are dangerous goods, they must be taken back for verification and to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Wages at Taian Yarn Factory: After the Taian Yarn Factory stopped working, the municipal government negotiated with the Japanese Consul several times regarding the issue of paying severance fees to the unemployed workers as required by the contract, but there was no result. On the 28th, the municipal government sent another letter to the Japanese Consul, requesting that the factory be ordered to resolve it quickly. It said that according to the letter from your consulate, the manager of the Taian Yarn Factory replied that the factory's temporary suspension of work was actually due to the anti-Japanese society hindering operations, and it was not a permanent shutdown, nor could it be considered a labor-capital problem. As for the temporary unemployment of workers, we regret this, and the factory cannot bear any responsibility. In response to this, the anti-Japanese movement in Wuhan is the result of the general public's patriotic indignation, and the Taian workers have never heard of it. Moreover, the materials stored by the factory in the Hanyang warehouse can supply a long period of work. Now, the factory is automatically suspending work under the pretext of stockpiling products. Therefore, the factory should bear full responsibility for this shutdown. Moreover, the fact that the factory automatically stopped working has caused the workers to become unemployed for no reason, resulting in a request for six months' severance pay. This labor-capital dispute is a mediation mechanism of the government's responsibility, and we do not want this kind of dispute to be unresolved for a long time, which would lose the affection of labor and capital. Therefore, before the issue of severance pay for unemployed workers in the factory is formally resolved, we will provide them with the convenience of borrowing according to the workers' demands. We firmly believe that the factory will have good relief for the unemployed workers who have promoted the factory's business development through labor in peacetime. We are corresponding to reply to your Consul, and we still hope that the Taian Yarn Factory will be ordered to resolve it quickly.</p>
<p>General Inspection of Japanese Goods to Be Held Immediately: The Wuhan Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has decided to hold a general inspection of Japanese goods in the three towns of Wuhan on December 4th. On the 28th, twelve methods were adopted, and the main points are as follows: (1) The deadline for the general inspection of this association will be the end of the period after the completion of the inspection of the designated area. (2) The scope of work and the number of people assigned for the general inspection of the person: (A) Scope of work, the inspection area shall be based on the police area. (B) Number of people assigned, 48 people in each district, 6 people in each group, and inspections will be carried out separately. (3) Daily inspections are limited to one area. (4) The area to be inspected shall be temporarily designated by the association. (5) The boundary of the area to be inspected shall be secretly sent by the association inspectors to prevent leakage. (6) All inspection groups organized by various trade associations shall conduct the general inspection at the same time as this association, but they must first gather with this association when conducting the inspection to obtain close contact in order to unify command and achieve consistent steps.

<h3 id="e64">Hubei Province Implements Disaster Relief by District <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Part of American Wheat Has Arrived in Hankou</p>
<p>Floodwaters in Wuhan Have Not Receded Completely</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since the violent Japanese invaded, people across the country have been paying attention to the changes in diplomacy, and they seem to have forgotten the survivors of the disaster. The disaster in Hubei Province is the most serious in the country, with a total of ten million victims in the province. More than 1.5 million people are stranded in Wuhan. At present, the floodwaters in Wuhan have not completely receded. Although the disaster victims have been repeatedly sent away, most of them still have no home to return to. In order to relieve the disaster victims and implement flood control, the authorities decided to implement a work-for-relief method. Today (25th), the first batch of 700 tons of American wheat has been transported by the Dehe Wheel, and another 4,500 tons are on the way and will arrive soon. The authorities then decided to repair the embankments according to the planned plan. All the collapsed embankments of the Xiang River and the Yangtze River were divided into five districts for repair. A labor-for-relief management bureau was established in each district. The bureaus were located in Hankou, Xindi, Jianli, Xiantao, and Qianjiang. The district was divided into sections, and a labor-for-relief office was established in each section, accommodating 5,000 workers, divided into ten regiments, each regiment divided into twenty platoons, and each platoon with twenty-five people. The first district covers the area from Wuxue to Jinkou, requiring about 13,737,000 cubic feet of earth and 45,000 workers. The second district covers the area from Jinkou to Chenglingji, requiring about 14,564,000 cubic feet of earth and 50,000 workers. The third district covers the area from Chenglingji to Tuomao, requiring about 16,331,000 cubic feet of earth and 60,000 workers. The fourth district covers the area from Hankou to Xiantao Town, requiring about 7,366,000 cubic feet of earth and 30,000 workers. The fifth district covers the area from Xiantao Town to Qianjiang and the Jingjiang section, requiring about 8,211,000 cubic feet of earth and 40,000 workers. A total of 225,000 workers are needed. As for the distribution of American wheat, 17,410 tons in the first district, 17,350 tons in the second district, 17,125 tons in the third district, 11,650 tons in the fourth district, and 15,480 tons in the fifth district, totaling 85,020 tons. Hankou is the top grain station, and Wuxue Huangshigang, Jianli, and Xindi are the second grain stations for storage and application. The construction period is set from this month to the end of May next year. This is all about the official embankments. As for the people's embankments, the government will also consider repairing them appropriately. (November 25)</p>

<p>The Command Executed Eight Bandit Criminals by Shooting: The chief of the fourth district of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team, who previously arrested six pirates in the Wusong area, Zhang Shangxian, Qu Jiakai, Chen Dakao, Chen Xianjuan, You Zhaoyun, and You Zhaomeng, and Fan Guozhong, the leader of the first team of the first district, who arrested two members of the Taibao A Shu gang, Wei Hongxiang and Gan Azuo, in Shanghai, confessed to the robberies and other cases under interrogation by the Songhu Pacification Division Command. They were sentenced to death in accordance with the provisions of the Punishment of Bandits Ordinance. Today (29th), Commander Cao followed the order, signed and extracted the six pirates Zhang Shangxian, etc., and the two criminals Wei Hongxiang, etc., verified their identities, announced their crimes, and ordered them to be bound to the execution ground and executed by shooting.</p>
<p>The Power of Bandits in the Ninth District Is Gradually Increasing: In Xiaokunshan Township, which belongs to the county, there have been several cases of small gangs of bandits committing robberies and kidnappings with weapons in groups of six or seven. The police force of the public security police station in the district is weak and difficult to protect. Wang Huankun, the director of the Ninth District, has personally requested the county public security bureau to allocate weapons and ammunition to strengthen its strength. It is reported that last night, a certain family not far from the town was threatened by bandits to extort money, demanding 1,400 yuan. They first took 400 yuan, and the remaining amount was allowed to be delivered at Meijialong at a later date. The cunning of the bandits is evident.</p>

Wang Kuihe and 178 other users in the Beiqu Daqiao Town responded after receiving the letter that the users pay electricity bills monthly according to the current used.

<p>The Gaoyou breach plugging is complete. The two major breaches at Junlou and Miaoxiangkou in Gaoyou, one 160 zhang long and the other 90 zhang long, were not far apart and were the most difficult breaches to plug in the canal embankment. This time, Director Shen of the Construction Bureau selected and appointed Yu Heng as the director of the breach plugging project. Yu first built a levee on the west bank and then built dams upstream and downstream of the two breaches to cut off the flow. Construction began on October 12th, and by the 24th of this month, the northern section of the west levee and the upstream and downstream dams had been joined. As for the southern section of the west levee, because the opening was narrowed, the water level rose more than a zhang, forming a waterfall, making construction extremely difficult. Yu supervised the workers and worked hard, and finally, on the 26th of this month, the breach was safely joined in a storm. Once the earth levee is completed, the flow can be cut off. The entire project for Junlou and Miaoxiang has been successfully completed.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Anti-Japanese National Salvation's Vital Force (Asia) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>More than seventy days after the successive fall of various parts of the Northeast, it was only then that the professors of various universities in Shanghai, who hold the leading position in national knowledge, formed an anti-Japanese national salvation organization. One cannot help but sigh at how the nation is in such dire straits, how could they endure so long. However, at this critical moment when the strength and voices of the national masses are about to run out, this unique vital force stands out. In addition to feeling extremely excited, we extend our infinite hopes.</p>
<p>First, given the state of the country, neither war nor peace is feasible, and indecision is even less feasible. However, if everyone is truly determined to die for the country, then war is a solution. If one has the ability to endure the pain for a while, then peace is also a solution. Alas, in today's country, there are only a few: (1) traitors who seek personal gain at the expense of the country, (2) warmongers driven by momentary emotions, (3) those who are ignorant and follow the emperor's orders, and (4) incompetent meat-eaters who are at a loss. Alas, with such national difficulties, such people, and such a government, the future of the Chinese nation is fraught with unprecedented dangers. Professors are all scholars with deep learning and reflection. The association has clearly stipulated that "research" is one of the important tasks of its members. It is hoped that they will systematically and comprehensively study the issue and arrive at a factual conclusion regarding war and peace, and then use various methods to urgently achieve practical results. This is the most crucial issue among the current difficult problems, and it urgently awaits a calm, rational answer, or even more effective emotional stimulation. Since the meat-eaters have failed to plan for the long term, it is hoped that those who call themselves professors will take on this responsibility. We further hope to assess the true value of today's university education from this.</p>
<p>Second, professors usually have their own specialties and are less involved in association affairs. However, their legitimate personal rights should not be abandoned. I believe that in the future, there will definitely be those who consider giving up the right to vote as a crime. And in the current national crisis, the civic duty brooks no exception. The purpose of the association must lie in this. Although there are many methods of resisting Japan and saving the country, merely relying on theory is ineffective. Since the general public's level of education is so low, even realistic, objective arguments, such as statistics and comparisons, may have little effect. We sincerely hope that all professors will use their expertise, not only to think but also to take action, to perform brave and effective deeds.</p>
<p>Third, even if you gather all the world's most skilled architects, you cannot build a mansion. It requires the hard work of countless laborers. The professors should not be too arrogant and just discuss plans on paper, forgetting the masses of people who possess great power and are anxious and unable to live in peace. We firmly believe that only by leading the vast army of the people can we resist Japan and save the country. This depends on the association's propositions and methods.</p>
<p>In conclusion, concerning the anti-Japanese national salvation association of the so-called professor class, amidst extreme grief and hardship, we cannot help but hope that the association will make unique contributions. Why is the 5,000-year-old Chinese nation so weak today? May the Shanghai universities' anti-Japanese national salvation association, rising as an unexpected force, catch up quickly.</p>

Designating it as a neutral zone is tantamount to abandoning our sovereignty. Therefore, we telegraph to you, requesting that Representative Shi immediately withdraw this proposal and continue to insist on Japan's troop withdrawal as a prerequisite. We also order the Northeast troops to strictly defend their positions and not to withdraw to the interior, so as to protect our territory. We eagerly await your response."

<p>Portugal has fallen sharply, and the heroic spirit of dominance is a thing of the past. In yesterday's battle at Yitu, the team was short of personnel, and Xi Nisi was temporarily assigned as goalkeeper. Mr. Xi was dressed in plain clothes and behaved like a gentleman, not like a martial artist. Of the remaining ten players, only Ma Sai'er, Gu Si Tan, and Gong Shifu are veterans, and the rest are new players. Gu Si Tan, a famous central defender at sea, has not shown his talent for a long time. He played yesterday, and his footwork was slightly rusty, but his posture remained the same. It is said that he will join Lax, which is truly like adding wings to a tiger. Ma Sai'er is also one of the famous generals. His powerful footwork can still be used as desired. How can a defective lineup fight against a healthy army? Although they held a resistant attitude, they eventually failed. It is inevitable that they will be defeated.</p>

<p>Donghua's victory was easy. Although the enemy was ambitious and tried to take advantage, there was no dangerous action, which was chilling. Zhou the Iron Gate and the five defenders within the defense blocked the enemy like a paradise, barely knowing what war was. The five forwards were very active, scoring four goals in the first half and six more in the second half, totaling ten. On the list of merits, Dai Linjing scored four goals, Li Yichen three, Chen Hongguang two, and Qian Jingyong also opened the scoring record with one goal. Only Chen Yutian was absent, presumably because his luck was poor.</p>

<p>Will Sail Today at Noon</p>
<p>Will Stop at the Otaru Wharf in Japan</p>
<p>Requesting the American Merchant to Handle the Pilot</p>
<p>Changing Berth to the American Merchant Wharf The China Merchants Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications to dispatch the Beiyang steamship "New Ming" to Japan to transport overseas Chinese back to their country. The "New Ming" foreign passenger ship's licenses and other documents have been prepared by the Ministry of Communications in consultation with the Customs. The most important matters are the pilot for going to Japan and the wharf to dock at in Yokohama. The Bureau has consulted with the American merchant Otaru Company in this port. When the "New Ming" arrives in Japan, Otaru will be asked to hire a pilot on its behalf. When the ship arrives in Yokohama, it will berth at the Otaru Wharf so that overseas Chinese can board the ship. After days of consultation, it is said that Otaru has agreed and has telegraphed its Yokohama branch to prepare.</p>
<p>Preparing a Large Amount of Food Supplies The problems of the pilot and wharf for the "New Ming" to Japan have been resolved, and there are no other difficulties. Because there are a total of 1,200 to 1,300 overseas Chinese returning to the country this time, the demand for food on the ship will be huge. It must be purchased in Shanghai first. It is estimated that at least six days' worth of food must be prepared for these thousand-plus people after they board the ship. Yesterday, the Bureau allocated funds and handed them over to the "New Ming" shipowner, instructing the stewards to purchase everything in Shanghai and store it on the ship.</p>
<p>Setting Sail East Today at Noon The cargo brought by the "New Ming" from Tianjin this time has been unloaded. The ship will sail to Japan empty and needs ballast. Yesterday, the shipping department ordered the ship to prepare this and load enough coal for fourteen days. It is approved to set sail east at noon today, heading directly from Shanghai to Yokohama. The journey is expected to take about five days.</p>
<p>Telegraphing to Inform the Consulate The date of departure for the "New Ming" to Japan to transport overseas Chinese has been telegraphed by the China Merchants Bureau to the Ministry of Communications, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering our Consul-General in Yokohama to take care of the "New Ming" upon its arrival and to liaise with the Japanese Customs authorities on all matters. Overseas Chinese who should take the ship back to the country are also ordered to gather in Yokohama so that they can board the ship after it arrives, in order to avoid delaying the schedule. The Bureau has also telegraphed Consul Zhou in Yokohama directly.</p>

<p>Talks About Saving the Country Through Aviation</p>
<p>Fujian Province Has Already Donated Over 2.9 Million</p>
<p>Planning to Promote it Nationwide in Shanghai</p>
<p>He Jingzhi Intends to Establish a Factory Jointly Funded by China and the United States</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Fujian Province has recently launched an aviation-based national salvation movement and has already received donations of 2.98 million. Currently, it is still actively in progress. Yesterday, the executive committee member Song Yuanyuan came to Shanghai to purchase aircraft and plans to promote the movement nationwide to strengthen national defense. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency specially visited Mr. Song at his private residence yesterday, and he talked about various matters as follows:</p>
<p>The Origin of the Initiative According to Mr. Song, he has been away from Fujian for more than four years. Recently, he returned and passed through Xiamen, where various community organizations came to visit him, because the foreign insult is imminent, and Xiamen is especially noticed by the Japanese. They asked him to discuss with the community organizations in Zhangzhou and Commander Zhang Zhen to convene representatives from various counties in southern Fujian in Zhangzhou to jointly discuss national salvation and self-defense strategies. After Mr. Song arrived in Zhangzhou, he immediately discussed with all sectors and believed that the issue of saving the country should not be empty talk but should be studied on the basis of facts, especially on the basis of military preparedness. Our country has more than two million regular troops, making it the world's leading army country. However, the quality of soldiers is more important than quantity. Moreover, the combat effectiveness of this conscripted army is even more limited. Recently, people from all walks of life have advocated changing to a conscription system, and the voices are quite high. It is expected that it can be realized soon. However, the effect of implementing conscription will be seen several years later, which is not enough to be a current strategy to resist foreign insults. Secondly, research on the navy shows that our country's navy suffered a setback in the Sino-Japanese War. Although the naval authorities proposed a plan to revive the navy the year before last, it was shelved due to financial difficulties. However, even if this plan is implemented, its effect will be seen in twenty or thirty years, which is not enough to be a current strategy to resist foreign insults. When I was serving in Nanjing, I talked with various central committee members about our country's military preparedness and had research on the two issues of submarines and aviation. I said that the manufacturing of submarines is considered a secret technology by various countries, and it is not easy to get its transmission. If we buy from various countries, they will definitely not let us have the excellent ones. If we want something easy and quick to achieve and cost-effective, we should follow the aviation-based national salvation legacy of the Prime Minister first. Many committee members agreed. In recent years, the government has paid great attention to the aviation industry, but the progress is still slow due to the current financial difficulties. People in Fujian want to seek national salvation and self-defense in practice and should first promote civilian-run aviation as a backing for the government. All sectors agreed, and Commander Zhang also strongly supported it. Therefore, Mr. Lin Zhiren and others were publicly elected to send a telegram to initiate the Fujian Aviation National Salvation Association.</p>
<p>The Progress of the Situation Mr. Lin and others initiated the Fujian Aviation Association, thinking that the overall situation was critical and the traffic in northern Fujian was blocked, making it difficult to convene. Therefore, they asked various counties in southern Fujian to first send representatives to meet in Zhangzhou on the 8th of this month. On that day, representatives from more than 20 counties attended the meeting. Chen Guohui, the Brigade Commander of Quanzhou, sent representative Ye Zuyi, Lin Guogeng, the Naval Commander of Xiamen, sent representative Zhao Zhixiong, and Commander Zhang also attended. They immediately announced the establishment of the Fujian Aviation National Salvation Association to preside over the civilian-run aviation affairs of the entire province. After passing the articles of association, they also agreed that each county and overseas Chinese port should make donations. The aircraft purchased should be named after the county or port, and those purchased by individuals should be named after them. The aircraft should be formed into teams, which would be used for transportation in peacetime and assist the national army in attack and defense in times of resistance or suppression of the Communists. In addition, because there was a shortage of aviation talents in Fujian Province, it was decided to establish aviation schools in a short period of time to recruit students from various counties and ports to train specialized talents in driving and manufacturing. At the continued meeting on the 9th, in addition to electing executive and supervisory committee members and custodians, the representatives of each county jointly discussed the amount of donations, which should be proportional to wealth. Siming County recognized 500,000 as the most, followed by Longxi and Jinjiang, each with 200,000, and Dehua and Yongtai each with 20,000 as the least. All officers and soldiers of Zhang Zhen's department donated one month's salary and recognized 300,000, and Chen Guohui's brigade also recognized a donation of 150,000. Because the representatives of Putian, Xianyou, and other counties had not arrived, the conference also compared and tentatively decided that a total of 2.98 million had been recognized for donation. Commander Zhang and the representatives of various counties also agreed to first pay 600,000 within two weeks, which would be kept by Committee Member Huang Yizhu and others for the purpose of ordering aircraft. At the same time, they telegraphed the provincial government and various counties that had not recognized donations to uniformly initiate the movement and telegraphed various overseas Chinese ports to collect large sums of money, and it is expected that the effect will not be small.</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai to Purchase Aircraft and also, in order to purchase aircraft, they should first apply to the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs for a passport. The Fujian Aviation Association initially elected Commander Zhang to go to Beijing to get the passport and elected me to come to Shanghai to contact leaders from all walks of life to promote the movement nationwide. Later, Commander Zhang received a telegram from Beijing saying that defense was important and asked him to postpone his trip. Therefore, the aviation association entrusted me to handle matters related to obtaining the passport and purchasing the aircraft.</p>
<p>Planning to Set Up a Factory to Manufacture Themselves Currently, Minister He Jingzhi is in Shanghai to discuss the aviation-based national salvation movement in Fujian Province. Mr. He expressed his sympathy and suggested that it would be too uneconomical to purchase from foreign countries. Currently, there are foreign merchants planning to establish an aircraft manufacturing plant jointly funded with our country, with a capital of about 10 million. If a portion of the funds in Fujian Province can be retained as share capital, it will be even more beneficial. This idea is very good. If more than ten provinces have successfully established civilian-run aviation, tens of millions of funds can be raised, and one or two tenths can be used to set up a factory to manufacture themselves. Once the negotiations are completed in Shanghai, they will go to Beijing again to discuss everything with Mr. He.</p>
<p>Contacts in Shanghai Mr. Song also said that the national salvation movement in Shanghai's various community organizations is very enthusiastic, and there are also many who advocate civilian-run aviation. I originally intended to immediately convene leaders of various community organizations to discuss and initiate the Aviation National Salvation Association. However, before the initiation, there must be a backbone person responsible for formulating the steps to be taken so that it can be easily effective. Moreover, Shanghai is the center of national public opinion and economy and has a great influence on politics. This national salvation undertaking is related to the security and survival of the country. If the research and preparation are not mature in advance, the effect may be very small in the future and may even create obstacles. Therefore, I am now exchanging opinions with various parties and asking various leaders to come forward to preside over the movement. It is expected that a method will be formulated within a few days and then the movement can begin. I plan to wait for the establishment of the civilian aviation organization and notify various provinces and cities, and then go to Ningbo to handle the passport, purchase aircraft, and discuss setting up a factory to manufacture aircraft. Now I hope that various newspapers will strongly promote the movement. If various provinces and cities uniformly initiate the movement, thousands of civilian-run aircraft can be added within a few months. Using this as a backing for the government will have real strength. In terms of the current resistance against foreign insults, Japan is an island country, and its invading troops must be protected by the navy. Warships are most afraid of aircraft. If we first drive away their navy, their landing troops will be cut off from the rear supply and will inevitably be disarmed by us. Therefore, in planning a strategy to resist foreign insults, I dare say that saving the country must promote aviation, and aviation can definitely save the country.</p>

<p>Telegraph Briand to Resolve According to Law</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance</p>
<p>The Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance held an emergency meeting at 5 PM yesterday on the 5th floor of the Women's Bank, attended by more than ten people including Yan Shuhu and presided over by Ding Shujing. It was resolved to invite the Women's Temperance Association, the Chinese Women's Suffrage Association, etc., to jointly telegraph Briand, requesting that Japan be judged according to law. The telegram is recorded as follows: To Chairman Briand in Paris, Japan violates the Nine-Power Treaty, sends troops to invade our Republic of China, occupies our three northeastern provinces, and carries out indiscriminate bombing, killing, and arson, with no regard for humanity. Your Excellency Chairman respects the Covenant of the League of Nations and has repeatedly ordered the withdrawal of troops, but the Japanese stubbornly ignore this and advance instead of retreating. If this Sino-Japanese negotiation cannot be properly negotiated, then our country will be deceived. What will become of the credibility of the League of Nations and the future of the disarmament conference? As a result, world peace will become a disappointment. Therefore, we request Your Excellency Chairman to resolutely resolve the issue of our three northeastern provinces in accordance with the law in order to seek peace and happiness for the entire world. We are pleading for the people of our country, no less than pleading for the entire world. The Chinese Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance, the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, the Women's Rights Movement Alliance, the Chinese Women's Suffrage Association, and the Chinese Women's Assistance Association respectfully bow.</p>

<p>The Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court submitted a request to the Judicial and Administrative Department to verify the meaning of execution mentioned in Article 5 of the agreement on the establishment of a Chinese court in the Shanghai Concession. The Judicial and Administrative Department forwarded it to the Judicial Yuan. Yesterday, the Judicial Yuan instructed that the execution mentioned in Article 5 of the agreement refers to all litigation documents and judgments. As for the disposition of confiscated items after execution, it should still be handled in accordance with Article 493 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<p>Handling First Aid for Japanese Soldiers with National Qualifications</p>
<p>Japan and France Want to Join Hands to Dominate The Chinese People Should Save Themselves Quickly</p>
<p>Yu Youren Came to Shanghai from Beijing and Invited He to Go to Beijing Together</p>
<p>Madam He Xiangning, the wife of Liao Zhongkai, arrived in Shanghai from France on the French mail ship "Maishanqi" the day before yesterday and is staying at Madam Sun Yat-sen's residence on Molly Avenue. A reporter from the Xinzhen News Agency visited her upon her arrival, but she was out. Yesterday, Madam He moved to Gan Naiguang's place for a temporary stay, and the reporter visited her again in the evening and was granted an audience. The conversation was as follows: Madam Liao said that she left Shanghai for Europe in September the year before last and stayed abroad for a total of two years and two months, mostly in France, and also went to England and Germany for a period of time. In ordinary times, she lived in Europe, and in addition to painting and reading for entertainment, she operated her own clothing, food, and other items. This time, because of the pain of the national disaster, she will handle first aid and other matters for Japanese wounded soldiers with national qualifications. She does not intend to participate in domestic politics in nineteen cases. Therefore, when I passed through Hong Kong, I did not go to Guangzhou, only to Shantou, because my (He called herself) mother was buried there, and I went to see her tomb. This time, among the European countries, apart from England and the United States being closer to us, France's attitude towards us is the worst. France</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>has clearly shown that it wants Japan to join hands and the two countries to dominate East Asia. When this matter happened not long ago, our country planned to invite the press in Paris to report the truth, but it was not possible. The Parisian press completely followed the Japanese. Therefore, it is not advisable for our country to rely on the League of Nations to resolve the matter. The League of Nations is actually a group in which major countries carve up small countries and divide up honesty. We have no other strategy but to save ourselves daily. Now that I have arrived in Shanghai, I plan to hold a calligraphy and painting exhibition within a week or ten days, and then I will reside in Shanghai and engage in the first aid work of the Red Cross Society.</p>
<p>Yu and Others Invite He to Go to Beijing Yu Youren, the President of the Supervisory Yuan of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai express train at about 8 AM yesterday. At about 5 PM yesterday, he and Zhou Qigang and Ding Chaowu, members of the Central Committee, visited her one after another. In addition to talking with Madam He about the internal and external situation, Yu and others invited Madam He to go to Beijing. Madam He expressed that she was unwell and would not go anywhere else for the time being.</p>
<p>Madam Liao's Recent Poems Madam He also showed her recent works and attached a short introduction, saying, "The Japanese disaster has befallen the motherland. Passing through Annam, I was moved by the sound of the song. One poem written in the boat in November of the 20th year: I am afraid to hear the sound of singing the national ruin, and I want to stop and chant because of the heartbreak. There is a way to revive the country, the virtue of Emperor Wen, weeping for the sin of stopping the car, Xia Yu Ren, losing all the allies, who can love and comfort the common people? Every common man has a duty to rise and fall. The people under the spring should be full of tears. I am afraid to hear the sound of singing the national ruin, wandering on the road, and doubling my sadness. What is the weight of sacrificing rights? Where to find the lost rivers and mountains? The leaves fall in the Xiao Xiao, and the wild geese fly south, wandering thousands of miles back to the motherland. The events before and after the eight years in the Central Plains teach people to recall tears on their clothes. Three years of facing the wall like Vimalakirti, the right and wrong are unclear. The unbaked soil is not dry, and the strong neighbor does not destroy itself. I have been wandering in Paris for three years, dreaming of Liaoning and Ning, and the lungs are fried. Such a Jiangshan is fragmented, and the slave insults without words."</p>

<p>Declaration of the General Meeting: The declaration of the Ten-Man Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps' Hundred-Corps General Meeting stated: On September 18, 1931, Japanese imperialists took advantage of our tragic disasters and the fact that international powers were preoccupied with their own interests and had no time to look eastward, and suddenly used violence to first occupy Shenyang, seize Liaoning and Jilin, and invade our Heilongjiang, slaughtering our soldiers and civilians, plundering our wealth, destroying our cultural relics, undermining our sovereignty, disregarding justice, and abandoning humanity, not hesitating to open up unprecedented tragedies in order to achieve their conspiracy of aggression and annexation. We personally feel the pain and deeply resent it. Based on the responsibility of every citizen, we have contacted comrades and are implementing four simple tenets through the basic organization of ten people: (1) Do not buy Japanese goods; (2) Do not work for the Japanese; (3) Prepare for war against Japan; (4) Promote the organization of the Ten-Man Corps, trust each other, encourage each other, and strive to spread it throughout the country in the near future, gather the strength of 400 million people to defend ourselves and survive, so that justice may be extended and power may be eliminated. To this day, more than two months have passed. Our concessions have reached their limit, our patience has reached its limit, and the League of Nations is procrastinating and acting perfunctorily, disregarding the dignity of the covenant and its resolutions. Its struggling and pathetic state only serves to embolden the violent Japanese. As a result, our General Ma Zhanshan was forced to retreat north to Hailun, and alarming news from Jinzhou is frequently reported, and the sound of cannons in Tianjin has risen again. Moreover, the Japanese army is constantly increasing its reinforcements, and its ambition is becoming increasingly apparent. Its momentum will not stop until it destroys our country. We were born as Chinese and will die as Chinese ghosts. Our ancestors have passed down their legacy to us, and our descendants will continue it in the future. As long as there is a breath of life, we will never be willing to be reduced to prisoners. Seeing today's gathering of thousands of people, all with the determination to resist Japan and save the country, in the future, all our compatriots will unite in the same hatred and determination, and the day will not be far off. However, because the situation is critical, the entire country must be mobilized and move in unison in order to talk about saving the country. Therefore, there must be no more Qin-Yue states within the country, constantly at odds with each other, bickering over the rights, and pursuing disintegration. All grudges should be swept away at once. Even if we want to hold our heads and cry bitterly, and tell each other about our past mistakes, we will not have time for that. How much more so for those who are still scheming against each other and harming each other? If they still do not realize this, I really do not know what they are thinking. If they are still obsessed, they should admit that they have other intentions. Harmful horses must be removed, and traitors should be killed. We thousands of people swear to abandon them together with the people of the country. The situation is urgent. Three million square miles of territory are being trampled under the iron hooves of the violent Japanese, and thirty million compatriots are being bombarded by the violent Japanese cannons. Smoke and fire obscure our vision, and the sound of war drums frightens our hearts. We thousands of people swear to exhaust our blood and sincerity, and are willing to join the people of the country to resist the violent Japanese in order to save the country. If we slack off or disobey, may heaven and earth punish us. This declaration is made with utmost sincerity.</p>

<h3 id="e105">General Meeting of the Youth Support Ma Corps <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Brutally Assaulted Corps Member Shang Defa</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Youth Volunteer Corps to Support Ma Against Japan in the Northeast has been working very hard, and many people from all walks of life have been following its example. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the corps held a general meeting of members at the Ximen Public Sports Ground. More than 300 members attended. After performing the ritual, the corps leader reported on the work situation, and then the members were divided into teams for training. It is reported that the corps is scheduled to hold a demonstration parade this afternoon at 2:00 PM to call attention to people from all walks of life. The route will start from the Public Sports Ground, pass through Fangxie Road, Minguo Road, and Zhonghua Road, and then disband at Ximen. At that time, various circles in this port will also be invited to the venue for guidance. The departure date of the corps has not yet been determined because the funds have not yet been raised. However, it will definitely be able to depart for the north by the day before next week at the latest. The corps is currently planning to raise donations from all walks of life. Its announcement states: Since the fall of the Northeast, General Ma has been fighting alone without assistance, and the rulers are watching without helping, and the commanders are standing by with their arms folded. We are indignant and determined to sacrifice everything to go to the Northeast, take our country's hot blood to help General Ma, and fight the Japanese devils to the death. In the first registration, more than 400 people have joined after cutting their fingers and swearing an oath, and there is a continuous stream of people requesting to join. In recent days, we have also received many blood letters with very passionate words. Registration is still continuing. We are planning to set off in the near future, determined to shed blood outside the Great Wall and have our bones exposed in the desert, to use our hot blood to awaken the people of the country. However, because the journey is long, the weather is cold, and the number of people is large, our economy is limited. We are afraid that we will become hungry and cold ghosts before we reach the desert. In desperation, we ask patriotic compatriots from all walks of life to donate generously to help us go to our deaths. However, the world is not as it used to be, and there are speculators and muddlers everywhere. In order to be cautious about our integrity, we have formulated proper measures. All donations are requested to be sent to the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank for safekeeping. We will withdraw them on the day of our departure and will never waste a penny, living up to your high expectations. At the time of departure, we plan to hold a large farewell meeting to express our determination not to return alive until the Japanese devils retreat. At that time, we sincerely hope that you will come and give us instructions on everything. We are ready and waiting to depart, and we are very much looking forward to it. We are sincerely writing this announcement.</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that Gao Defa, a member of the Youth Volunteer Corps to Support Ma Against Japan in the Northeast, was walking along North Sichuan Road at 6:00 PM the night before when he had a conflict with several Japanese naval landing force soldiers due to bumping into each other while walking. The Japanese soldiers brutally assaulted Gao Defa with their fists. At that time, the crowd gathered and shouted loudly to fight back. The Japanese soldiers saw that the situation was not good and dispersed. Gao suffered a nosebleed and was injured. It is reported that he will report the incident to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau and request negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Summary of Volunteer Army News <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Decided to Change the Organization: Chen Yafu, director of the Compilation Office of the Volunteer Army Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and others recently believed that the army's organization, which was entirely based on the existing army's three-three system, was likely to be confused with the government's army. Therefore, they had a plan to change the designation and adopt a general team system. It is learned that the reorganization plan has been approved by the army committee and is being actively carried out by the Compilation Office starting today. It is said that the city will be divided into five major areas based on the soldiers' addresses: Nanshi and the French Concession will be the first area, Zhabei will be the second area, Yinxiang and Yangshupu will be the third area, the Public Concession will be the fourth area, and Pudong will be the fifth area. It is planned to place one large team in each area. Name lists are being rushed to be made, and new teams are being formed separately. The selection of officers for each team is underway. It is expected that the reorganization will be fully completed and established within the next week.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Beijing to Request Weapons: The Volunteer Army of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has been in training for two months since it began. Every day from 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM, they practice in the Nanshi Public Sports Ground and Qingyun Road in Zhabei, and they are quite diligent. However, the training is all unarmed, which is difficult to achieve further development. Furthermore, the future of the country is already in frequent danger. Without the skill of using weapons, how can we defeat the enemy? The army committee believes that the issue of weapons and ammunition is already urgent. In addition to having telegraphed the National Government a few days ago to request a prompt allocation, it has specially sent army committee members Li Yongxiang, Tang Junzhu, Zhou Xuexiang, Wang Wenhua, and others to Beijing last night with a petition to request the issuance of weapons.</p>
<p>Second Regiment Paraded Yesterday: The second regiment of the Volunteer Army of this city scheduled a parade. The regiment leader, Ming Jinglie, issued a notice to the three battalions under his command to assemble at the Qingyun Road Grand Training Ground at 7:00 AM on the 29th. Then, training director Li Yongxiang and regiment leader Deng led the entire team to set off. They passed through Baoxing Road, Baoshan Road, Xinmin Road, Hengfeng Road, and Maigen Road. The march was orderly, and the military appearance was solemn. The audience blocked the road. Then, they rested for ten minutes at the Maigen Road Grand Training Ground. Then, each battalion began to drill, with each battalion commander taking charge of the battalion training. Finally, regiment leader Deng directed the regiment training. The spirit was vibrant, and the movements were lively. It was indeed the elite of the Volunteer Army in this city.</p>
<p>Retired Soldiers Organize: Retired soldiers held a preparatory meeting for the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army at Xilin Temple yesterday. More than 40 people attended. Yu Jingyu was elected chairman. After performing the ritual, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting. Then, Xiao Jinfan and Qiu Luanxie successively reported on the progress of the situation. Several important proposals were resolved. The name was designated as the Preparatory Committee of the Retired Soldiers Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army of the Republic of China. All those present were preparatory committee members. Qiu Luanxie was publicly elected as the chairman of the committee, and Huang Yue was elected as the director of preparation. The preparation period is at most two weeks. A temporary office will be set up in Xilin Temple in Ximen. In addition to immediately submitting a report to the local party, government, and military authorities, as well as the central party headquarters and the national government for record, a declaration of righteousness was also made. Tan Weihua and Chen Huiming were sent to Beijing to welcome Comrade Bai Ju and ask him to come to Shanghai as soon as possible to preside over all activities.</p>

<p>Ren Jinping, Zhu Meixian, Jin Runxiang, and others in the business community of this city, in view of the perilous diplomatic situation in our country and the loss of the Northeast, have been strongly advocating for a declaration of war against Japan in order to save this critical situation.

Taking the diplomatic difficulties of the Soviet Union as an example, they requested that he express the courage of assassinating the Qing regent, make the decision of Macdonald, and advise Mr. Hu Hanmin to go to Beijing together and Chairman Chiang to go north immediately to recover the lost territory. They also put forward seven suggestions and asked him to forward them to the Special Diplomatic Committee for adoption and implementation. The letter was 6,000 words long and was extremely sorrowful and impassioned. The seven suggestions to Mr. Wang are recorded below: (1) Formally announce to the 44 non-war covenant countries that Japan is attacking Heilongjiang, occupying Qiqihar, and harming General Ma along the Qike Road, along with evidence and mileage. (2) Telegraph the US envoy to retain the sympathy of the great powers, citing Article 15, Paragraph 9 of the League of Nations Covenant, requesting that the dispute be transferred to the General Assembly.

<p>Autumn General Meeting Failed to Meet Quorum</p>
<p>Changed to Hold Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association convened an autumn general meeting at the Ningbo Association Hall in the Public Concession yesterday (Sunday). From 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM, Li Shirui, Tang Yingsong, Qu Yue, Xu Genhao, Yu Zhongluo, Liu Zuwang, Zhao Zuwei, Zhang Feixiong, Zhan Jifeng, Zhan Yigang, Tan Yigong, Mao Yun, Wang Chengkuan, Yu Zufen, Shan Yuhua, Huang Han, Zhu Taiqing, Cai Nipei, Jin Zhi, Huang Qiying, Zhang Enhan, Yang Chunlu, Hu Yuanjun, Hu Yuanteng, Liu Xiang, Pan Zhensheng, Yang Zhihao, Shi Liang, Cai Ding, Xi Yuchang, Xia Zhexin, Li Zuyu, and others, totaling 134 people, arrived successively. Prosecutors Wu Renxin and Li Hao, dispatched by the Shanghai District Court and the Special District Court, came to the venue to supervise. The meeting was opened with a bell ringing and a ritual. The presidium, Li Shirui, Tan Yigong, Lu Shaozong, and others, took their seats, and Dai Yuanxian recorded the minutes. First, Li Shirui reported that the association has a total of 751 members, but the number of members present was insufficient to meet the legal quorum, so they had to change to holding a discussion meeting. The details of the meeting are excerpted below: (1) The presidium reported on the work situation of the association, which was divided into: (1) Li Shirui reported on the general affairs work, including the opposition to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's ban on rent arrears notices and the organization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and other work; (2) Tan Yigong reported that there were more than 17,000 incoming and outgoing documents since the spring general meeting; (3) Lu Shaozong reported on the accounting situation, with current deposits of more than 30,000 yuan. (2) The issue of building a meeting place was raised, which was divided into three proposals: (A) Chen Zemin proposed building a large-scale clubhouse; (B) Tang Yingsong proposed renovating the clubhouse; (C) Tan Yigong and others proposed adding a clubhouse to the original site. Zhang Feixiong, Sha Xunyi, Liu Zuwang, Mao Yun, Qu Yue, Yu Zhongluo, Shan Yuhua, Tang Yingsong, and others successively expressed their opinions. Because it was a discussion meeting and there was no right to vote, it was decided to submit it to the executive and supervisory committee for a long-term discussion. (3) Yu Zhongluo proposed requesting all members of the executive and supervisory committee to join the members' training of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps, and the letter from the National Lawyers Association of the Republic of China requested the attachment of a foundation and 11 surcharges. All of the above cases will be left to the executive and supervisory committee meeting for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>

<p>The China National Products United Commercial Center was closed by the Public Works Department this summer and has been closed for half a year. Although the municipal government and the municipal chamber of commerce have negotiated with the Public Works Department, there has been no effect. Recently, Zhang Zilian and Hong Yanbin, the persons in charge of the commercial center, specially petitioned the municipal government and the municipal chamber of commerce yesterday, requesting them to actively negotiate with the Public Works Department. The participating manufacturers also convened a general meeting of all representatives yesterday, and all said that during this period of passively resisting Japanese goods, promoting national products is imperative. However, Shanghai's largest supplier of national goods has been unreasonably locked down, resulting in patriotic compatriots having no opportunity to recognize national products, which is very regrettable. As a result of the meeting, Liu Zhongying, Zhou Zhaolin, and others were appointed as representatives to send letters to various national goods organizations and the five Chinese directors of the Ratepayers Association, requesting that they quickly negotiate with the Public Works Department so that a solution can be reached soon and business can be resumed. It is reported that the case has been accepted by the municipal government and the five Chinese directors, and the time for a solution should not be far off.</p>

<p>Fell from a Horse and Was Crushed to Death</p>
<p>The Corpse Was Crushed into Three Sections, and the Skull Was Shattered</p>
<p>Brain Matter and Fresh Blood Flowed Together, a Tragic Sight</p>
<p>Xie Mingdan, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the First Regiment of the Special Service Corps of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government's Tax Police, was transferred back to Wusong from Nantong the night before. Currently, because the empty houses in Songzhen are all occupied by the troops of the 19th Route Army, the troops of the battalion had no place to live. Therefore, yesterday, the troops were transferred to Jiangwan to be stationed. After the troops set off, Battalion Commander Xie rode his horse with several guards, heading south along the railway from the Yuncaobang Bridge, and when he reached the factory entrance of the railway general machine gate north of Zhanghuabang, a local villager was walking in the railway track ahead. Battalion Commander Xie, with good intentions, immediately beckoned the villager to jump out of the railway. When he was about to urge his horse to start walking, the horse's foot accidentally got stuck in the track and could not move. However, the train had already arrived, and the driver, due to the rapid speed, was unable to brake in time, causing the front of the train to hit the horse's buttocks. The horse jumped around in pain, and Battalion Commander Xie fell into the track and was crushed by the wheels in the crook of his leg, cut into three sections. Both legs were separated from the body, and the skull was also crushed, a bloody and blurred scene that was too horrible to bear. The corpse was dragged by the wheels to the factory gate about two to three feet away to the south. The snow-white brain matter and bright red fresh blood were stuck to the railway track and sleepers where the corpse stopped, which was very regrettable. After the accident, the battalion's secretary, Tang, immediately reported to the regiment headquarters. The corpse has not yet been collected. It is said that it will be collected after the regiment commander arrives for inspection. People have been ordered to build a cool shed and send troops to guard it. The horse was also seriously injured. When Xie's subordinates heard the news and rushed to the scene, they cried incessantly. It is reported that Battalion Commander Xie was 32 years old, from Anyue County, Sichuan Province. After graduating from Tsinghua University in Beiping, he stayed at the University of Virginia in the United States. After returning to China, he took his current position. He married last year, and his family is still in Sichuan. He has a younger brother who is currently studying at Tsinghua University in Beiping. He has no relatives in Shanghai, and his afterlife is very miserable.</p>

<p>Grandchildren Inherit Maternal Grandfather's Estate</p>
<p>First Case of Its Kind in Shanghai</p>
<p>Subrogation Inheritance Not Without Reason</p>
<p>Request for Provisional Execution Rejected</p>
<p>Qin Fang, daughter of wealthy merchant Xue Baorun and former wife of Hua Lihou, passed away after giving birth to two children. Last year, Xue Baorun passed away, and his family became involved in lawsuits over the distribution of his estate. Hua, believing that his deceased wife Qin Fang also had the right to inherit part of the estate, hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Qi Shaoying, and Zhang Jiahui to represent his children, Hua Yigu and Hua Manyun, in a lawsuit against Xue Baorun's sons, Yan Sheng, Jia Sheng, Gen Sheng, and Gan Sheng, in the First Special District Court, seeking a share of the estate. Because both plaintiffs were minors, Hua Lihou appeared in court as their legal guardian to make statements. The defendants hired lawyers Lin Yingqing and Wang Youling to defend them. After several court hearings, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, allowing the grandchildren to inherit their maternal grandfather's estate, the first case of its kind in the city. The defendants, dissatisfied with the verdict, intend to appeal to the High Court. The first instance judgment is appended below:</p>
<p>(Main Text) The defendants shall pay the plaintiffs two-thirds of the 500,000 yuan inheritance share that the deceased Hua Xueqin Fang was entitled to. The remaining claims of the plaintiffs and their request for provisional execution are rejected. The plaintiffs shall bear one-third of the litigation costs, and the defendants shall bear two-thirds. (Facts) The plaintiffs' representatives stated that the defendants should be ordered to pay 500,000 yuan. Their statement briefly stated: Xue Baorun, the plaintiffs' maternal grandfather, had seven children: four sons, the defendants Xue Gansheng, Yan Sheng, Jia Sheng, and Gen Sheng, and three daughters, Hua Xueqin Fang, Xu Xuechaoqun, and Xue Baobao. Hua Xueqin Fang, the plaintiffs' mother, gave birth to the plaintiffs and Hua Yiheng. Unfortunately, she passed away on February 20th of the Republic of China year eight. The maternal grandfather, Xue Baorun, also passed away recently, on August 25th of the Republic of China year nineteen, leaving behind approximately 2 million yuan in assets, all of which are managed by the defendants. Except for Xue Bao's inheritance share, which has already been resolved separately, the share that the plaintiffs' mother should inherit, calculated at one-sixth, should be 500,000 yuan. According to the Judicial Yuan's Interpretations Nos. 405 and 424 of the Republic of China year twenty, the plaintiffs should inherit by subrogation. Whether a woman has the right to inherit property should be determined at the time the inheritance begins. The date of the woman's death is irrelevant. The defendants are still jointly managing the aforementioned estate and have not divided it, which does not involve the provisions of Article 3 of the Implementation Law of the Inheritance Compilation. A person inheriting by subrogation can claim the entire inheritance share of the person being subrogated. It is permissible for the plaintiffs' brother, Hua Yiheng, not to be included among the plaintiffs. Furthermore, the defendants are currently extravagant. Xue Baorun has only been dead for a year, and the defendants have already spent a considerable amount of the estate. In the future, they may not be able to repay their debts. Therefore, they request a declaration of provisional execution. The defendants' representatives responded, stating that it is true that one-sixth of Xue Baorun's estate should be 500,000 yuan. However, the plaintiffs' mother died in the Republic of China year eight. At that time, women did not have the right to inherit property. The right to inherit property cannot be retroactively applied to the plaintiffs' mother simply because women had the right to inherit property when Xue Baorun died. The plaintiffs fundamentally have no basis for subrogation inheritance. Furthermore, the defendants had already divided Xue Baorun's estate and had an estate management certificate issued by the court. According to the provisions of Article 2 of the Implementation Law of the Inheritance Compilation, there is no room for the defendants to inherit by subrogation. Furthermore, of the plaintiffs' three siblings, Hua Yiheng was not included as a plaintiff, and it is inappropriate for the plaintiffs to claim the entire inheritance share of their mother. As for the defendants' sale of part of the industry, it was used to repay Xue Baorun's debts. There are still 3 million yuan in assets, and it is highly unlikely that they would not be able to pay 500,000 yuan. The plaintiffs' request for provisional execution is clearly inconsistent with the law. They submitted a photograph of the estate management certificate as evidence. (Reason) The defendants' representatives admitted that one-sixth of Xue Baorun's estate should be 500,000 yuan. The issues to be examined are (1) Whether the plaintiffs can claim subrogation inheritance because their mother died in the Republic of China year eight; (2) Whether the defendants had divided Xue Baorun's property; (3) Whether the plaintiffs can claim the entire inheritance share of their mother; (4) Whether provisional execution should be declared. Regarding the first point, whether a woman has the right to inherit property should be determined at the time the inheritance begins, i.e., when the deceased dies, and not when the woman dies. If a woman had the right to inherit property at the time of her death, but the woman no longer had the right to inherit property when the deceased died, then her direct descendants would have no room for subrogation inheritance. Conversely, if a woman did not have the right to inherit property at the time of her death, but women had the right to inherit property when the deceased died, then her direct descendants could claim subrogation inheritance. In this case, although the plaintiffs' mother did not have the right to inherit property at the time of her death, women had the right to inherit property when Xue Baorun died. The plaintiffs' claim for subrogation inheritance is not without reason. Regarding the second point, the defendants argued that Xue Baorun's estate had been divided, relying on the estate management certificate issued by this court. However, the certificate stated that the defendants were jointly managing the estate and did not mention any division. The defendants' argument is clearly untenable. Regarding the third point, the plaintiffs are claiming the right to inherit by subrogation themselves, which is different from claiming the right to inherit on behalf of their mother. They can only sue for the share they are entitled to inherit by subrogation and should not include the share that other persons inheriting by subrogation are entitled to inherit. The defendants' argument on this point should be considered reasonable. Regarding the fourth point, the defendants are managing an estate of 3 million yuan, which the plaintiffs' representatives do not dispute. The plaintiffs are only requesting 500,000 yuan, so it is highly unlikely that they will not be able to afford it in the future. Their request for a declaration of provisional execution is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 463, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Procedure Law and cannot be approved. Based on the above conclusions and in accordance with Article 98 of the Civil Procedure Law, the judgment is made as in the main text. November 3rd of the Republic of China year twenty, Judge Li Moyin of the Civil Division of the First Special District Court of Jiangsu, Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation sent a letter of inquiry to the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association because it approved the sale of Korean goods. Yesterday, it received a reply stating: "We have received your letter and understand everything. After reviewing the 15th Standing Committee Meeting of this Association, we resolved to exempt Korean products such as Korean ginseng and hasma from Yuan Chang Company from boycott.

This Association should unite with small and weak nations to fight together against the great enemy. Therefore, we have the said resolution. Since its disclosure, we have received numerous warnings from all sectors, weighing the pros and cons, and requesting the revocation of the resolution. This Association bears the mission of resisting Japan and saving the country. All resolutions are completely based on facts.

<p>Near the Xia Miaogen residence in Xiagiazai, Figure 18, Yanghu Township, Dachang, Baoshan County, a male corpse was found lying prostrate at around 6:00 AM yesterday. The corpse had a shaved head and no hat, and was wearing a dark blue cloth short shirt and trousers, with a floral cloth shirt underneath and a pair of blue cloth single trousers. Bruises were found on the back, and there was fresh blood on the mouth and nose. The left foot was red and swollen, and there were rope marks under the two ribs. The Township Police Chief Yang Xi immediately reported to the Township Head Yang Zhong'anlong to investigate. It was determined that the corpse resembled Chen Guixiang from Chenjiazhai. The younger brother of the deceased, Chen Jinxiang, was immediately notified and confirmed that it was true. According to Chen Jinxiang, his brother Chen Guixiang was 44 years old and worked as a shop assistant in Shanghai. He had returned to his hometown to help Yang Jinfazijiao of Beiyanghu marry his daughter-in-law. He left Yang Jinfa's house at around 9:00 PM after dinner and returned to Chenjiazhai. His family did not see him return home that night and initially thought he was staying at a friend's house. They did not suspect anything else, but unexpectedly he was assassinated.

<p>Ren Zhennan's Fraud Case Opens</p>
<p>Lawyer Ren Zhennan was involved in a case where his wife, Jiang Xingjuan, sued him for obstructing morals and harming her. The criminal case was dropped since both parties unconditionally divorced. The court session was originally scheduled to commence the other day, but it was terminated. However, there was also a case where Zhuang Chunfu accused Ren Zhennan of defrauding him of money. The court session was also scheduled to commence the other day. In the afternoon, Judge Qian Chengjun presided over the session regarding Zhuang Chunfu's accusation. According to Zhuang's wife, Zhuang Li, who filed the case, her husband Zhuang Chunfu could not attend due to a stroke. The official asked how much money they had paid Ren Zhennan in total. She answered, "696 yuan for procedures, 280 yuan for official expenses, 1,000 yuan for settlement fees, and another 3,000 yuan plus a 500-yuan check." (Question) "Where did the 3,000 yuan come from?" (Answer) "She took it out from her cloak." (Question) "Where did you hand it over?" (Answer) "In the office." (Question) "What color was the cloak?" (Answer) "Black." (Question) "What kind of collar?" (Answer) "Leather." (Question) "Was the 3,000 yuan wrapped?" (Answer) "Yes, it was wrapped." (Question) "How many people were there?" (Answer) "My husband and I, Zhuang Jihuai, Qian Yumin, and others." (Question) "How did the check come about?" (Answer) "Qian Yumin borrowed it." (Question) "Did you see Qian Yumin hand it over?" (Answer) "I saw him hand it over to Ren Zhennan." (Question) "Where did you settle the matter?" (Answer) "At the China Hotel, first in room 206, then in room 204." (Question) "Why did you change rooms?" (Answer) "Ren opened it." At this point, the official questioned Qian Yumin, "Regarding the lawsuit between Zhuang Chunfu and Wang Lianxiang, did you introduce Ren Zhennan?" (Answer) "I introduced him to Gu Gongyin, who then introduced him to Ren." (Question) "Did you know about the previous 500 taels?" (Answer) "It was handed over in a room at the China Hotel. There was also 1,000 yuan, also at the China Hotel. The 3,500 yuan was handed over in the office. The first time was with cash, the second time was also with cash, and there was also a 500-yuan check that I lent to Zhuang Chunfu from the Shanghai Bank." (Question) "What was the signature?" (Answer) "My friend Han Dingfeng." (Question) "Where did she take the cash from?" (Answer) "Zhuang Li took it out of her cloak." At this point, the official ordered the clerk to bring Qian Yumin out of the courtroom and asked Zhuang Li, "Is the cloak made of wool or satin?" (Answer) "It is made of black satin." The official then summoned Qian Yumin to the stand and asked, "What material is the cloak made of?" (Answer) "Black soft satin." (Question) "What kind of collar?" (Answer) "Leather collar." (Question) "Was the 1,000 yuan wrapped?" (Answer) "It was wrapped." (Question) "When was the agreement reached at the China Hotel?" (Answer) "February 12." (Question) "Why did you say it was the 9th at the Lawyers' Association?" (Answer) "I didn't know there would be this testimony at the time, so I forgot." (Question) "Since Ren Zhennan took the money, why didn't he issue a receipt or any kind of record?" (Answer) "He refused to issue one." At this point, the official asked Ren Zhennan, "Do you have any animosity with Zhuang Chunfu?" (Answer) "As far as the defendant is concerned, there is no animosity. But Qian Yumin seems to have some animosity." (Question) "Did you take the official expenses?" (Answer) "I did." (Question) "What about the 500 taels and 4,500 yuan?" (Answer) "I didn't." (Question) "According to Qian Yumin's testimony, you cannot say you are innocent." (Answer) "Because Qian Yumin asked to borrow money from me and I didn't have it, he holds a grudge. He introduced the case, and a month later he wanted to borrow 200 yuan." The official asked Qian Yumin, "Did you borrow money from him?" (Answer) "Yes, it was last December. He owed me money from playing cards and didn't pay it back, so I didn't want to ask for it, so I wrote him a letter asking to borrow money." At this point, he asked the prosecutor Yang for his opinion, and the official announced the end of the debate and awaited the verdict.</p>

<p>Seduced by a Neighbor in Her Youth</p>
<p>Lived Together for Years, Too Boring</p>
<p>Recently Discovered He Has a Wife</p>
<p>Sues for Damage to Family</p>
<p>Chen Xuezhen, a 23-year-old woman from Wuxi residing at No. 172, Weixin Lane, Jiangyuan Lane, Xinzha Road, recently hired lawyer Xiaoxiaoxian to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court accusing Wang Lisanzai of damaging the family and other charges. The defendant, Wang Lizai, did not appear. According to the plaintiff, Chen Xuezhen, in January of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the defendant and I were neighbors. At that time, I was not yet 20 years old, young and ignorant. The defendant took advantage of my mother's absence and used tricks and sweet talk to seduce me into his home. He lied that he worked for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and earned 50 or 60 yuan per month. If we lived together, he said we could maintain a family life. I was seduced into having sex with him and was instigated to leave my mother and live with him. Later, in the 18th year of the Republic of China, the defendant, under the alias Ye Rongsheng, was sentenced to six months in prison by the local court for committing fraud. At that time, I still visited and provided him with supplies. When he was released from prison, he lied that he would be working at a certain institution soon and asked me to find a way. I also spent a lot of money, a total of 798 yuan, and then he disappeared. I have been living in my mother's house for two years, and I still don't know the defendant's address. I recently learned that the defendant already has a wife. I am extremely angry and have therefore filed a lawsuit, requesting that he be punished according to the law and that he be ordered to compensate for damages of 798 yuan. Judge Feng verified the statement and ordered the case to be adjourned and the defendant summoned for further questioning.</p>

<p>Divorce is Mediated</p>
<p>Geng Guoxiang, a nurse at the Red Cross Branch on Chihang Bridge, Xinzha Road, and his wife, Zhu Yulian (also a Red Cross staff member), lived together at No. 598, Xinzha Road. The couple's relationship was quite harmonious on weekdays, but recently they suddenly quarreled over trivial matters, which led to the breakdown of their love. Zhu went to the Mediation Office of the First Special District Court to request a divorce. The other day, Judge Li presided over the hearing. According to Zhu Yulian, the reason for requesting a divorce was that Geng beat and abused her from time to time. Geng Guoxiang claimed that there was no abuse of Zhu and that there were two children at home. If they divorced, the children would not be cared for. Therefore, he could not agree with his wife's request. Judge Li persuaded the two parties not to disregard their ten years of marital love over trivial matters and to consider their children, who were their own flesh and blood, and that they should make up as before. However, neither party realized this, and Mr. Li ordered that the mediation failed and that a formal lawsuit should be filed separately.</p>

<p>Gu Zonglin, a wealthy merchant, was the president of a major bank in Heilongjiang and possessed great wealth. His wife, Mrs. Xu, lived in the Public Concession, No. 2308, Xiude Lane, Fuxu Road, and had several children. Therefore, she hired five or six male and female servants. One of them was Zhou Kainan, a female servant from Ninghai, 30 years old, who had been in the Gu residence for two years. She was diligent in her work and attentive in her service, so she was deeply favored by the mistress, who encouraged her. Unfortunately, when Shenyang fell and Heilongjiang Province was occupied, Gu's whereabouts were unknown, causing Mrs. Xu great anxiety. The other day, she received a telegram from her husband, informing her that he had safely arrived in Beiping. Mrs. Xu was overjoyed upon hearing this and planned to go to Beiping alone to meet her husband that day. When she was packing her luggage, she intended to take her female servant Zhou Kainan with her so that she could take care of her along the way. However, Zhou had just received a letter from her hometown, reporting that a funeral was urgently needed. She was dismissed, which disappointed the mistress greatly. When the luggage was being transported, a package of clothes suddenly disappeared. The mistress, in a fit of rage, used it as an excuse to accuse Zhou of stealing and sternly rebuked her, and then left by car. Zhou Kainan suffered this injustice and was extremely angry. At around 7:00 PM in the evening, she secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. At 2:00 AM the next day, her companion noticed and urgently called the nearby obstetrician Qi Xiuzhen to come for diagnosis. It was found that the poisoning was serious, and she was immediately sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. The body was transferred to the autopsy office to await a report from the court for inspection.</p>

<p>This summer, a couple from Wenzhou, Qian Wangping and his wife, suddenly rented a flat opposite Daxia Middle School on Jiaozhou Road, Huxi, for eight yuan a month. However, Qian's luggage and utensils were quite simple. Qian then opened a hospital in the house, calling it the Couple's Ophthalmology Hospital, and also treated emergency rescues for poisoning, swallowing gold, and difficult and complicated diseases. However, due to its remote location, business was not very developed, causing several households, such as the neighboring Jingqi Store and the Asia Shoe Store, to be owed more than one hundred yuan by Qian. Recently, Jiang Sanhe, the owner of Jiangtongsheng Bicycle Shop, hired Qian Wangping to treat his eight-year-old son's pinkeye. The fee was agreed upon to be twenty yuan, including medicine. Unexpectedly, after several treatments, not only was it ineffective, but the left eye was blinded. Jiang was eager to save his son and negotiated with Qian, but his right eye was also heavy. Qian claimed that it was due to insufficient medicine and that he needed to purchase medicine from Chinese and Western pharmacies to restore his vision. During the interval, he borrowed a bicycle from Jiang to buy medicine. Jiang was unaware of the trick and generously lent him a new bicycle. However, Qian disappeared. Jiang went to Qian's hospital to inquire and saw that the double doors were closed and there was no sign of anyone. Realizing something was wrong, he immediately inquired with the neighboring shops, who all said that they were owed money. They immediately gathered together and went to the hospital, opened the door, and saw only a camp bed and a few broken tables and chairs. They now plan to hire a lawyer to petition the government to arrest him.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Eight Years in Prison</p>
<p>The robber Zhang Chenghua, at 8:00 AM on October 29th, colluded with two other accomplices who were at large and used weapons to rob the Sen Tai Pawnshop at No. 40, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession (the shop had just opened the door), stealing hundreds of yuan in cash. They escaped northward, and the owner of the pawnshop and his staff followed behind. The two robbers lost track of them. Zhang turned west from Aida Road into Mintini Shade Road, and fled south to the front of the YMCA, where he was apprehended by the owner of the pawnshop and his staff. They took a pistol from Zhang's hand. Nineteen bullets were brought to the police station. It was found that Zhang had robbed the Lantai Pawnshop opened by Guo Liangfu at No. 324, Lanwei Road, on the morning of August 24th, obtaining 236 yuan, which was divided up. He was sent to the Second Special Court Police Station and prosecuted for robbery. Judge Xiong Huihua questioned the defendant several times, and the defendant confessed to the robbery. After the court appointed a lawyer to defend him, it announced the end of the trial and awaited the verdict. Yesterday, when the verdict was due, Judge Xiong arrived at the first criminal court at 3:00 PM and ordered the defendant to be brought to the stand and announced the verdict. Zhang Chenghua was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for each of the two crimes of robbery with weapons by a gang of three or more people, to be executed for eight years. The number of days of detention before the trial was determined to be one day for every two days of imprisonment. The pistol and nineteen bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Counterfeit "Old Beauty" Cigars Lawsuit <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Oriental Tobacco Factory manager Bi Renyingqin, represented by lawyers Yao Zhaomao and Yao Yongli, filed a report with the police, stating that the plaintiff's tobacco factory produces "Old Beauty" cigars in Hong Kong and sells them worldwide. The trademark was registered at the Nanjing Trademark Bureau under number 3076, which was issued in April 1929 and has been published in various newspapers as proof. It has now been discovered that Yongshunyu Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 58-60, Avenue Joffre, is selling counterfeit "Old Beauty" cigars. A request for investigation was made. Upon approval from the court, the police chief issued a search warrant and dispatched detectives to the shop, confiscating more than fourteen boxes of counterfeit cigars, which were taken to the police station. Yesterday, Jiang Bojian, the owner of the shop, was summoned to the First Special District Court for prosecution. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, stating that the "Old Beauty" cigars seized from the defendant's shop were identical in style to those of the plaintiff. However, the defendant's cigar boxes bore the words "Little Luzon," constituting a violation of Article 269 of the Criminal Law concerning obstruction of agriculture, industry, and commerce. He requested an investigation. Subsequently, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the situation of the plaintiff's rights. At this point, the lawyer representing the Little Luzon "Old Beauty" Cigar Factory stated that the cigars produced by his client's factory were the genuine "Old Beauty," and that the plaintiff's factory was in fact imitating them. The trademark of his client's factory had been involved in a lawsuit at the Executive Yuan, which has not yet been resolved. Now, the plaintiff intends to bring this case under false pretenses, attempting to obstruct the business of the genuine "Old Beauty." Now that his client's factory has learned of the case, they wish to join the lawsuit and request permission to countersue the plaintiff for the crime of obstruction. The plaintiff's lawyer rose to refute, stating that this case was initiated by his client, and there was no need for the other lawyer to participate. If there were any acts of counterfeiting, a separate lawsuit could be filed. The judge agreed with this point and ordered the lawyer representing the Little Luzon Tobacco Factory to leave. When questioned, Jiang Bojian stated that the "Little Luzon Old Beauty" cigars were purchased from Yongtaixiang Tobacco Shop on Henan Road and that he was unaware of the counterfeiting. He also requested a lawyer for defense and asked for a postponement. The presiding judge ordered Jiang to provide a shop guarantee for his release and granted a postponement for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e150">A Message from Mr. Liu Mingsan (Seeking to Awaken the Entire Nation.) <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The situation is urgent. There is only one way to seek the awakening of the entire nation: (A) The lack of cooperation between the people and the government is the greatest weakness of China. The way to remedy this is through cooperation between officials and civilians, but it should depend on the degree of awareness of the government. (B) Work hard on propaganda among the lower and middle classes (non-intellectuals), explaining how precarious China's national situation is, how dangerous the nation's position is, how important the gains and losses in the eastern provinces are to the other provinces, and how the imperialist powers are invading and oppressing. Find ways to spread this among the people to awaken their awareness. As for newspapers, books, leaflets, slogans, and various special publications, they are particularly useful tools for propaganda and should be widely printed with simple and clear explanations of current events, along with illustrations and posters, and posted in remote villages, factories, wine shops, tea houses, and shops to make them immediately understandable to the people. The power to stimulate the people and influence the masses should be more widespread than written propaganda. (C) Collect various atrocities committed by the Japanese in our Northeast and make glass slides (preferably in color) to be distributed to movie theaters across the country to be shown during movie screenings, shocking the viewers and creating a lasting impression, like the sound of evening drums and morning bells, never to be forgotten. (D) Implement a thorough economic severance plan with Japan. The most important key to whether economic severance with Japan can be achieved depends on the level of awareness of merchants across the country. If merchants do not privately sell Japanese goods, then Japanese goods can be prevented from entering our markets without resistance. As for the Japanese goods that have been sealed up this time, they should absolutely not be sold publicly on the grounds of financial congestion. In the past, the Zheng merchant Xian Gao used twelve oxen to save Zheng state, a story that has been passed down as a good deed for thousands of years. If our merchants have a modicum of conscience, they will certainly be able to catch up and emulate Xian Gao. (Regarding the issue of enemy goods, they should be handled in two categories:) (1) All luxury enemy goods should be disposed of in the same way as opium, by burning them publicly to show our determination. (2) All daily-use enemy goods should be registered and sealed up, and a circulation method should only be considered after the government announces the severance of diplomatic relations. Public sale is absolutely not allowed at present. In addition, what our industrial and commercial sectors should strive to do: (1) is to investigate, to investigate Japanese goods and the factories, banks, shipping companies, shops, and various businesses established by Japanese merchants in our inland areas, as the foundation for resistance. (2) is to promote, to promote domestic goods, to establish factories, to collect and compare domestic products for exhibition, and to strive for excellence to benefit the people and the nation. (3) is to manufacture, to manufacture substitutes for various Japanese goods to avoid the disadvantage of rejecting them but then welcoming them.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>The Sound of Anti-Japanese Resistance</p>
<p>— Shou Man</p>
<p>The word "fear" only exists in the dictionary of a slave of a conquered nation.</p>
<p>The five-minute fervor is a common ailment of the Chinese people. But all victories also depend on the effort in the final five minutes.</p>
<p>Inwardly, calmness allows both sides to understand each other and resolve disputes. Outwardly, calmness is sufficient to show weakness and invite foreign aggression.</p>
<p>The anti-Japanese movement must not be like the intermittent fever of malaria, fluctuating between hot and cold. It must be like the flow of rivers, ceaseless day and night.</p>
<p>Bees are the smallest of insects. Anyone who destroys their nests will surely be stung by the swarm. If a nation is destroyed and a family is wiped out and there is no resistance, it is truly worse than being a bee.</p>

<p>"Once the war starts, Japan will certainly use its navy to blockade all of China's treaty ports. I'm afraid that once the economic lifeline is cut off, everything will be over. In my opinion, fighting is more likely to lead to disaster than good fortune."</p>
<p>"If Japan is very stupid, it might do that. I think they have even smarter strategies hidden in their wallets. China's treaty ports, especially Shanghai, are the base for imperialists to carry out economic aggression. Blockading the treaty ports is a general blow to the great powers, especially Britain and the United States. Japan at least wants Britain and the United States to stand on the sidelines now. How can they come up with such a challenging and inferior plan? The strategy that Japan is now adopting is to stir up bigger things to cover up smaller things. You see, he used the Korean massacre to cover up the Wanbaoshan incident, and the invasion of the three northeastern provinces to cover up the Korean massacre, which is the process of this strategy."</p>
<p>"What major event is Japan still hiding to cover up the invasion of the three northeastern provinces?"</p>
<p>"Why do you see that he must cross the Middle East Road to take Qiqihar? To challenge Soviet Russia! If Soviet Russia falls for his plan, Britain and the United States will have to stand on Japan's side. At that time, everyone in the world will only have the war between Japan and Russia in mind, the war between capitalism and communism. Who cares what Japan's invasion of the three northeastern provinces is all about? So, the three northeastern provinces can become a consolation prize for the imperialists to Japan. So, my worry is in Soviet Russia's plot, not in the blockade of the seaports."</p>
<p>"Declaring war now seems like a desperate gamble. You see, it's better to suffer some temporary grievances and wait until ten years of reproduction and ten years of teaching, and then settle accounts with Japan?"</p>
<p>"Ten years of reproduction and ten years of teaching, the Yue state that was defeated in war can adopt this policy. Those who are defeated without war have no qualifications to say this. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, may I ask how many decades have passed, what has been reproduced, and what has been taught? I boldly say that being defeated without war, and being defeated without fighting, only leads to the reproduction of slaves and the teachings of slaves!"</p>
<p>"I think it's too uncertain to use the fate of the country to gamble like this. We still have to be careful."</p>
<p>"When disaster strikes, righteousness is in front, and even life and death must be seen through, let alone success or failure. The calculations of success or failure are only the tricks of people like Qin Hui and Wu Sangui. Yue Wu Mu, Wen Tianxiang, Shi Kefa, and Ma Zhanshan have only righteousness in their hearts. How can they have ever had a trace of consideration for success or failure!"</p>
<h3 id="e153">The Past of the League of Nations <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>When the violent Japanese army invaded and seized the three northeastern provinces, the League of Nations was the organization to uphold justice. As a result, it attracted worldwide attention. Recently, Mr. Wu Chao-chu of our country said, "We should neither overemphasize nor underestimate the League of Nations. After all, the League of Nations is not a supreme government that all participating countries universally respect" (meaning something like that). Mr. Wu once sat on the League of Nations and knows its situation very well. This statement cannot be said to be without its merits. Examining the past achievements of the League of Nations, such as resolving the dispute between Sweden and Finland in 1920, mediating the war between Yugoslavia and Albania in 1921, mediating the dispute between Italy and Greece in 1923, presiding over the British-Turkish boundary demarcation issue in 1925, and resolving the conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay in 1928, it seems that the League of Nations has considerable power in achieving ceasefires and resolving disputes between countries. However, the efforts of the League of Nations in international affairs are not limited to arbitration. According to a report by Mr. Tompkinson, an official of the League of Nations, its successful achievements can be summarized in several aspects. They are specially translated here as a reference for those who want to understand the situation of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(1) After the end of the European War, the Allied countries captured nearly 500,000 prisoners. They were starving and freezing, with nowhere to settle. The League of Nations decided to send them to Greece, granting them a vast area of 1.2 million acres. At the same time, within Turkish territory, it rescued distressed women and children, reaching a total of 2,000 people.</p>
<p>(2) During the Russian Revolution, there were many massacres and severe epidemics. If they were not contained, Western Europe would also suffer from transmission. The widespread disaster would be like the Black Death that prevailed in Europe during the Middle Ages. The efforts of the League of Nations Health Organization were truly the sole contributor to eliminating this harm.</p>
<p>(3) Labor-capital disputes in various countries around the world are also a point of attention for the League of Nations. Therefore, the League of Nations specially established an International Labor Organization to specifically investigate the labor conditions and living conditions of workers in various countries, as a preparation for resolving various disputes.</p>
<p>(4) In addition, assisting countries in prohibiting the sale of slaves and cracking down on the sale of opium and various drugs are also important duties for the League of Nations itself. It is said that considerable achievements have been made.</p>
<p>The annual membership fees provided to the League of Nations by various countries around the world are about one million pounds. The achievements of the League of Nations are also obvious to everyone. This time, the Japanese army's rampant behavior has been submitted to the League of Nations for discussion. Whether it can be resolved based on public reason is a crucial key to maintaining the credibility of the League today.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Truth About Japan After Sending Troops to Liaoning and Jilin <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jianwu</p>
<p>This time, the violent Japanese army launched an unprovoked war and occupied our Liaoning and Jilin. Recently, it has also seized our Heilongjiang Province. In the long run, it is the implementation of Giichi Tanaka's memorial to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. In the short term, it is the result of the current Japanese cabinet's Army Minister Minami and Chief of Staff Kanaya, who are both military men. My friend Wan Gengyao studied infantry at the Military Academy and is familiar with the situation in Japan. Yesterday, he spoke to me in detail about the attitude of the Japanese people, both government and public, after Japan invaded and occupied our territory. Sun Tzu said, "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you will not be defeated in a hundred battles." Therefore, I have recorded it below. I think it will also be welcomed by those who are concerned about Sino-Japanese affairs.</p>
<p>Japanese youth feel that the unemployment problem and the economic downturn in their country are becoming increasingly serious. The government cannot solve it. University students and the proletariat generally believe that the only way to reverse the difficult situation is to overthrow the cabinet. Therefore, slogans such as "Kill the Emperor," "Down with the Cabinet," and "Down with the Zaibatsu" are everywhere. In order to maintain his position, Army Minister Minami deliberately created international conflicts to shift the public's attention. The revolutionary trend has temporarily stopped, and the Wakatsuki cabinet can barely survive. After sending troops to Liaoning and Jilin, the Chinese people felt that their territory had been invaded, and the whole country was filled with righteous indignation and hatred of the enemy. Most countries in the world sympathized with us. The Japanese people were well aware of the situation and rose up to give speeches to the military, urging them not to be used by the Army Minister. After this persuasion, many soldiers opposed the war. When Army Minister Minami learned of this, he killed several military officers. The Mitsui zaibatsu, which had previously supported the Minseito, was originally a pro-war element. However, due to the economic severance of relations between China and Japan, their postal ships, coal, cotton yarn, banks, and the Northeast China Soybean Company have successively closed down. The amount of losses is difficult to describe, and there is no hope for future business. Therefore, they urgently made a sharp turn and changed their advocacy of war to advocating peace in order to resolve all disputes as soon as possible. They spoke to the cabinet. Prime Minister Wakatsuki believed that the military was becoming too powerful, and in reality, the Emperor had lost the ability to control the military. He specially invited Elder Prince Saionji to Tokyo to discuss national affairs together. The Seiyukai party members also severely criticized the Minseito's mistakes. In summary, most Japanese, both government and public, sympathize with us in this atrocity. Only a small number of warlords and veterans (according to the Japanese conscription system, these soldiers are those who served in the military during the Tanaka era) are causing trouble. As the saying goes, "Adversity builds a nation." I deeply hope that our compatriots will resist violence, defend against insults, and persevere in economic severance to the end. Then, the island nation of Fusang will have a day when it bows its head and begs for peace.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Magnificent Literature (5) <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Tian You</p>
<p>In the past, Liang Rengong (Liang Qichao) fully recorded these twenty-four songs by Gongdu in the "Drinking Ice Studio Poetry Talks," and said:</p>
<p>"The magnificence, liveliness, profundity, and far-reaching nature of its spirit need not be discussed. Even the literary style is unprecedented in two thousand years." I would like to say in one word:</p>
<p>"Whoever reads this poem and does not dance is certainly not a man."</p>
<p>Do we not feel the same way as Ren Gong when we read this poem now?</p>
<p>Gongdu's "Primary School Students' Chorus" has a total of nineteen chapters. In the song, one person sings first, and at the end of each chapter, three people sing together in chorus. Here are the six most magnificent songs:</p>
<p>Listen, you little students, each person has a body and a heaven-given duty. Everything outside the body is your enemy, and everything inside the body is your responsibility. It is better to be unequal to others than to lose ourselves. Relying on parents and leaning on the sky is ultimately useless. Alas! My little students, get rid of the slave mentality and stand tall to be independent.</p>
<p>Listen, you little students, I love my books more than history. This piece of flesh and blood has been passed down from Xuanyuan for more than a hundred generations. The ancestors worked hard, and it is always in our hearts. Alas! My little students, opening the book evokes love for the country, and closing the book brings tears of sorrow for the country.</p>
<p>Listen, you little students, people say that your country has many literary works. That is a sharp pen tip, and this is a little ink stained on silk. What is this crab crawling and wantonly devouring? Strive, strive to compete with each other. Alas! My little students, there is no weak country in the world of literature, and this is not the time to lay down arms.</p>
<p>Listen, you little students, if you want a strong country, first strengthen yourself. Everything outside the dining table is a battlefield, and everything under the shadow of the sword is heaven. Walk together, walk together as if going to face the enemy, singing in the morning and dancing in the evening, wearing black breastplates. Alas! My little students, when alive, be iron men, and when dead, transform into vajras.</p>
<p>Encourage yourselves, you little students, since you are citizens, endure being bandits. Citizens value protecting the qualifications of citizens, and citizens must have the characteristics of citizens. Let the hoe not plant, let the melon seeds divide. The heart is as straight as the black slave's heart. Alas! My little students, burn all the surrender banners, have me and no other country.</p>
<p>Encourage yourselves, you little students, you should fulfill your duties and the meaning of the people. Ying Zheng and Liu Bang have been overthrown many times. The foolish people do not ask about the affairs of the government. You know that the beams are broken and the rafters are collapsing. It is difficult to escape when the sky falls and crushes you. Alas! My little students, vow to exhaust the foolishness of the common people and save the dying sky together.</p>
<p>How can we not dance when we read such wonderful words? (Note 2)</p>
<p>Note 1. For example, Article 3 of the recently promulgated "Educational Outline for Student Volunteer Army" states: "All schools in the country, in terms of curriculum, ... must focus on promoting the national spirit and creating a magnificent and brave atmosphere in courses such as literature and art. All romantic, decadent, and languid literature and art are absolutely prohibited."</p>
<p>Note 2. The "Collected Poems of the Renjinglu Studio" was printed in Japan and is not easy to obtain now. The "Commentary on the Poems of the Renjinglu Studio" is still easy to buy in the market, but the selection is limited.</p>

<h3 id="e156">A Country Bumpkin Arrives in Shanghai Again (32) <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>After the country bumpkin finished his meal, he walked out of the Mei Garden Restaurant. He thought to himself, "Now I can go to Meilanfang to find my nephew A Mulian. Should I take a rickshaw or a tram? I've been on the tram for half a day, and it took me across the Grand Theater without reaching my destination. It seems much easier to quickly call a rickshaw and tell him to pull me to Meilanfang."</p>
<p>As he thought, he was looking at the Shanghai night scene. It was about eight o'clock at night, when Shanghai people were having dinner. Chinese and Western restaurants were filled with customers like a tide. The electric lights shone as if every shop had an electric light archway in front of its door. The prostitutes who came out to sing were dressed in gorgeous clothes and sat in shiny rickshaws. The rickshaw pullers, pushing and pulling, ran faster than horse-drawn carriages.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin remembered something. A young man from his village named A Jinlong came to Shanghai to pull rickshaws for a mansion. The master in that mansion was a big guy, and the rickshaw pullers didn't like him. But he insisted on having the rickshaw puller run fast. The old rickshaw pullers shook their heads when they saw him. They said, "Rather than pull this big guy, it's better to carry a coffin." A Jinlong, however, was young and strong. He pulled this master and moved as fast as flying. So the master chose him.</p>
<p>Many people who were jealous of A Jinlong called him a "two-legged horse." The meaning of "two-legged horse" was also a bit malicious. The horse that pulls the cart originally has four legs. Now humans are also doing the work of horses. Horses are livestock and serve humans. They cannot speak and cannot complain to humans. Since they are humans, why should one person sit comfortably in the cart, while the other person runs, panting and sweating, pulling the cart? Humans are also doing the work of livestock, but they are still two legs shorter than livestock. Therefore, the humans who pull the cart got this elegant name, called "two-legged horses."</p>
<p>But the country bumpkin saw the rickshaws pushing and pulling and showing off, and the rickshaw puller was still complacent. He thought to himself that it was clearly four legs running there, but one animal had been replaced by two humans.</p>
<p>"Gee! There are so many female Zhuge Liangs in Shanghai." As he walked, he muttered to himself, saying silly things.</p>
<p>It turned out that when they were putting on a makeshift opera stage in the spring, he had seen a performance of the "Empty City Stratagem." He knew that the name of the person holding a feather fan was Zhuge Liang. He didn't expect that when he came to Shanghai and took a look, every girl sitting in a rickshaw was holding a feather fan. So he sighed and said that there were too many female Zhuge Liangs in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Bid-Up Gold Market Was Complex Last Week</p>
<p>Fluctuations Occurred Several Times, Resulting in a Gradual Increase. The fluctuations in the bid-up gold market last week were still considerable, the situation was complex, and it seemed to be in a swirling pattern. The turbulent waves were difficult to suppress, with differences of more than ten to twenty taels per day. People's hearts were extremely disturbed and it was difficult to take measures. However, in the end, it gradually increased. From the beginning of the week, it slightly weakened to a minimum of 654 taels, and then the overseas silver market showed different trends. The UK rose and the US shrank, but the exchange rate of Shanghai bills still deviated in the opposite direction. The UK was loose and the US was tight, mainly because the exchange rates between the UK and the US frequently fell. The pound sterling first lengthened by four levels, and the US dollar shrank by 0.25. The domestic market was also the same. Gold companies sometimes bought and sometimes sold, but the spread was opened wider, causing the gold price to break through the 80-tael mark. On Thursday, a new high price of 685 taels was discovered. Later, due to the situation, the news of the Japanese army's advance on Jinzhou and the disruption of Tianjin worsened, and people's hearts were panicked, breaking through the 60-tael mark again. As a result, it was on the border of 70 taels. There were 31 taels of retrospect in these six days. The total continued to rise by 10 taels and 8 qian. The price was settled according to the US dollar. At first, it was pressed around 70 taels, and then it even reached more than 112 taels. The Dalian gang slightly occupied the majority of long positions. As for the Guangdong gang, which was originally short, it engaged in more than 5,000 counterattacks by the end of the week. However, the spot red tape was loose, mainly because the silver market was still tight. The situation in the north was unstable, so the price only increased by 5 taels in the spot bid. In the future, there may still be drastic changes. The general situation of the past week is summarized below.</p>
<p>Different Mentalities Caused Chaos. From Monday (November 23), the silver market was long 1875, the US silver market shrank 125, the pound sterling did not change, and the internal market was tightening. Foreign firms George Joseph and the gold gang were all buying. The gold price initially opened slightly lower by 0.25, at 654.5 taels, followed by 54 taels. Due to the shaking of the Japanese cabinet, the buyers were active, and George Joseph captured short positions, soaring by more than 10 taels to 68 taels. Then, due to rumors that Japan banned the transportation of cash, it plummeted by more than 10 taels, and the afternoon closed at 55 taels and 2 qian. In the afternoon, the market opened at 56.5 taels, followed by 5 taels and 8 qian. Afterwards, Wu and others pursued, and it was heard that a telegram came from Mumbai to buy pound sterling, which boosted people's hearts and broke through 70 taels, reaching 79.5 taels. By the time the market closed, it was 77.5 taels, an increase of 19 taels compared to the previous Saturday. There were 25.5 taels of ups and downs throughout the day. On Tuesday, the silver market was short 1875 for the near term, and did not change for the far term. The US silver price shrank 875, the pound sterling did not change, and the US dollar shrank 75, which also means that the exchange rate shrank. The domestic market seemed to be covering the bid-up gold market. The market opened at 74.5 taels, and then there were ups and downs of more than 10 taels, with considerable fluctuations. Then, a large trader bought in at 79 taels. At noon, Wu and others sold out, only accounting for 67 taels. At noon, it was from 70 taels to 68 taels and 9 qian. In the afternoon, it opened at 71.5 taels, followed by 68 taels to 73 taels and 9 qian. A large trader sold 65.5 taels, and by the time the market closed, it was 70 taels and 08 qian, a decrease of 6 taels and 7 qian compared to the previous day. There were 13.5 taels of ups and downs in total. On Wednesday, the silver market rose by 375, the silver price rose by 375, the pound sterling lengthened by another level, the internal market also lengthened, and the industry sold out, because the exchange rate returned, and the US dollar trend became harder, so the spread was slightly closer. As for the gold price, it immediately dropped by 5 taels and 3 qian when the market opened, to 665 taels and 5 qian, and then only accounted for 57 taels. At noon, there were more buyers, so it became 63 taels and 7 qian, and the market closed at 60 taels and 7 qian. In the afternoon, it opened at 62 taels, and retail traders sold out, to 59 taels. Again, as Mumbai was decreasing, there were still more buyers, rising to 65 taels and 3 qian. By the time the market closed, it was 64 taels and 6 qian, but it was 6 taels and 2 qian less than the previous day. The front and rear markets were up and down 8 taels and 7 qian, the situation was still flat, and the foreign exchange market was closed on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, the silver market shrank by 0.25, the US silver market decreased by 375, the pound sterling also shrank by one level, the internal UK was flat and the US was tight, which also meant that the exchange rate shrank again. The bid-up gold market immediately rose by 9 taels and 9 qian, accounting for 724.5 taels. It was also rumored that South Africa maintained the gold standard, and people's hearts were upward, rising to 84 taels. Later, a large trader sold to 73 taels, and the noon closing was 77 taels and 8 qian. In the afternoon, 79.5 taels once reached a new high price of 85 taels, because Wu and other large traders bought hard. Afterwards, the exchange market became easier, and Mumbai suddenly added 13 annas, plummeting by more than 16 taels, to 68 taels and 5 qian. In a moment, Mumbai reported 7 annas smaller, and the price re-emerged to 70 taels, accounting for 74.5 taels. By the time the market closed, it was 72 taels and 7 qian, a decrease of 7 taels and 1 qian compared to the previous day. There were 16.5 taels of ups and downs throughout the day. On Friday, the silver market lengthened 0.25, the US silver market was not in the middle, the pound sterling lengthened by one level, but the US dollar did not change, because there was no exchange market. As for the domestic market, it was wide, and the industry sold out the most. The bid-up gold market opened at 73.5 taels, adding 1 tael and 8 qian, which also meant that the silver market was short, followed by 75 taels. Afterwards, it gradually decreased, but there were 10 taels of ups and downs. The noon closing was 65 taels and 3 qian, and in the afternoon it was 57 taels and 5 qian. The Dalian gang first sold out, followed by 54 taels and 5 qian. Mumbai reported that it was also big. After entering, the buying was strong, accounting for 63 taels and 7 qian. By the time the market closed, it was 62 taels and 8 qian, a decrease of 8 taels compared to the previous day. There were 20.5 taels of ups and downs in one day. On Saturday, the silver market rose again by 5625, the silver price shrank by 125, the pound sterling lengthened by 75, and the US dollar only added 75 due to the exchange rate shrinking again. The domestic market was very different, the UK was loose and the US was tight, and there were not many transactions. The gold gang slightly exited, and the gold price opened at 63 taels and 5 qian, adding 7 qian. The Dalian gang sold out, as low as 60 taels and 2 qian. Afterwards, it gradually rose, breaking through 70 taels, which also meant that the Guangdong gang's Hengxing was strongly filling the short positions, accounting for 74 taels. Then, as Chengfengyong and others sold out, it fell back by 4-5 taels. At noon, there were ups and downs of 3-4 taels at 67 taels and 5 qian. By the time the market closed, it was 69 taels and 3 qian, an increase of 6 taels and a half compared to the previous day. There was a difference of 13 taels and 8 qian in half a day, but after the market closed, it was done to 71-72 taels, and the last 70 taels had zero. The highest and lowest prices of the UK, US, Indian silver market and the exchange market bid-up gold market are listed below.</p>

<p>Silver Market Is Near and Far Long</p>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram came from London, and speculators bought in slightly. The market was stable, and the post-market was still flat. According to the silver market, the near term did not move, still at 19 pennies and 125. The far term lengthened 0625, to 19 pennies and 375. A telegram also came from New York, and the U.S. silver price still saw a disastrous decline. For example, the spot market shrank by 0.25 again, to 2 angles and 9375. The private telegram also fell 125, and the market was very tired. The pound sterling added 1 point and 625 to the US dollar, to 3 yuan, 5 angles, 3 points and 125. The US dollar decreased by 1 point and a half to the pound sterling, accounting for 3 yuan, 5 angles and 3 points and a half.

<h3 id="e159">Weekly Interest Rate Is Small, and the Discount Is High <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual. The price of the weekly interest rate was the same in the morning and afternoon markets, at 7 qian, 2 fen and 6 li, a decrease of 2 hao and a half compared to the previous noon. The silver discount in the morning and afternoon markets was also the same, at 4 qian, an increase of 5 fen compared to the previous change. The remittance bill was 560,000 in the morning market and 475,000 in the afternoon market. There were no transactions in banknotes in both markets. Qianjing's foreign public received and remitted more than 2.2 million, and the silver public received and remitted more than 35 million. The remittances from various routes received and remitted more than 300,000. The small money shops traded 400,000-500,000. The Jiangnan small foreign exchange was 6 qian, 4 fen and 6 li in the morning market and 6 qian, 4 fen and 7 li in the afternoon market. There were 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign exchange was 6 qian, 5 fen, 03 hao and 7 hu and a half in the morning market and 6 qian, 5 fen, 06 hao and 2 hu and a half in the afternoon market. There were 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins lengthened by 2,000 wen, accounting for 378,000 qian wen.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Securities <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Last Week's Bond Prices Continued to Fall Sharply</p>
<p>Falling about Three or Four Yuan More Than the Previous Week</p>
<p>Settlement Was Handled for Only Three Days Throughout the Week</p>
<p>Although the January Futures Market Opened, There Were No Transactions</p>
<p>Last week (from November 23rd to 28th), the bond market situation at the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was such that, coinciding with the end-of-month futures settlement period, except for the first two days and the last day of the week, the remaining three days were closed for settlement of November futures. Spot transactions were mainly small-scale, with a total turnover of only 41,000 yuan for the entire week. Among them, compilation and dismissal of troops bonds accounted for 9,000 yuan each at 20 customs, consolidation and troop reduction bonds, and 19 customs salt tax bonds each accounted for 5,000 yuan, and the remainder were very small. The price fluctuations in the futures market were very sharp in the first two days of the week, with active trading. On Monday, it totaled more than 15.4 million yuan, and on Tuesday, it also totaled 12.5 million yuan. On the last day of the week, although the 20-year January futures market opened, there were no transactions. The December futures were also maintained due to the bond market, prohibiting new sales, and with only one session in the afternoon, the turnover was only more than 1.4 million yuan. However, due to the Ministry's order prohibiting over-the-counter transactions, the over-the-counter transactions among brokers that were transferred to the account of the exchange on that day amounted to 9,485,000 yuan, with a cumulative total of 38.85 million yuan. Among them, consolidated salt bonds were the most, with consolidated tax bonds at 2.29 million yuan for November futures and 4.34 million yuan for December futures; salt tax bonds at 1.84 million yuan for November futures and 4.12 million yuan for December futures; 20 customs bonds at 1.74 million yuan for November futures and 3.29 million yuan for December futures; 20 customs bonds (rolled) at 1.875 million yuan for November futures and 2.68 million yuan for December futures; 19 good customs bonds at 1.3 million yuan for November futures and 2.655 million yuan for December futures; 19 customs bonds at 1.725 million yuan for November futures and 1.745 million yuan for December futures; troop reduction bonds at 660,000 yuan for November futures and 3.035 million yuan for December futures; compilation and dismissal of troops bonds at 1.425 million yuan for November futures and 2.03 million yuan for December futures; 96 public bonds at 930,000 yuan for November futures and 200,500 yuan for December futures; consolidation six percent bonds at 445,000 yuan for November futures and 190,000 yuan for December futures. However, only the November futures for customs duties opened at 320,000 yuan, and there was no market for December futures. As for the changes in the market prices of various bonds during the past week, the prospect of diplomatic relations with Japan was bleak, and the situation was extremely serious. The League of Nations was also timid and hesitant, and there was no progress in mediation and negotiation. The market sentiment became increasingly weak. Although the bond prices fluctuated greatly on Monday, there were both rises and falls, and the trend was still relatively calm. However, on Tuesday, the market demand was weak, and those who were unable to take delivery of goods urgently sought to sell, causing prices to fall sharply across the board, with declines ranging from two to four yuan. The fall in market prices was almost a new record. However, the impact on the financial market and investment was extremely significant. The Ministry of Finance, in view of this situation, had no choice but to find ways to provide relief, ordering the exchange to comply. The method was to take the closing price on November 24th, that is, last Tuesday, as the standard market price, and the market transaction price could not be lower, and illegal over-the-counter transactions were prohibited. In addition to complying with the Ministry's order, the exchange also suspended new sales transactions in order to maintain the market, while not restricting buyers, in order to alleviate the market. As a result, on the last day of the week, market sentiment stabilized slightly, and market prices rose by about one yuan due to demand exceeding supply. However, as a result, compared with the previous week, they still fell by about three or four yuan. Looking at the future of the securities market, with the exchange absolutely limiting new sales, bond prices are indeed unlikely to continue to fall. However, it is said that the exchange's regulations are temporary measures. If there is a turnaround in the external situation, prices may quickly rebound. The following is a statistical table of the high and low market prices of various bonds during the past week (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>The Yarn Market Was Extremely Sluggish Last Week</p>
<p>The yarn market was extremely sluggish last week due to the many national troubles, tight money, resulting in a lack of confidence, stagnation of commerce, and a special lack of actual sales. All merchants were lifeless. The daily supply of current yarn was only 400 to 500 bales. As a result, new sellers gathered, making it more difficult to stabilize the market. The disturbance in Tianjin was unbearable, and transportation to Shanghai was suspended, leading to a weakening sentiment. The market showed signs of a sharp decline. Fortunately, the bottom holdings were not thick and could be maintained for a while. Bidding yarn for the near month was down five taels from the previous week, and the far month was down two taels. The following is a record of the high and low comparison prices for bidding yarn last week:</p>
<p>Bidding Yarn, Highest, Lowest, Weekend, Compared to Previous Week</p>

<p>Mill Demand Was Almost Entirely Seized by Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market had an early warning of decline because foreign cotton was cheap, and various mills purchased large quantities, which could supply raw materials for eight or nine months. There was no inquiry about domestic cotton, and after being seized by foreign cotton, there was no surplus to purchase. As for the American and Indian cotton markets, they remained sluggish, with no upward momentum. The financial situation was extremely tight, and buyers viewed spot goods without moving, showing a rather uneasy situation that was difficult to support. The near month finally revealed flaws and fell by one or two passes. The current cotton prices of various mills this week were stagnant. The bidding cotton price for the near month was down one tael and seven mace from the previous week, and the far month was down five and a half mace. American cotton was similar to the previous week. The following is a record of the high and low comparison prices for bidding Han cotton last week:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to poor news from Liverpool, but later recovered due to buying by peers and short covering. Futures prices rose or fell by one to seven points, spot prices rose by five points. British cotton futures fell by six or seven points, spot prices fell by two points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by twenty-five points. Indian cotton speculators sold off, and the market was calm.

<p>The Hsiaho Rice Market Plunged</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of supply from various merchants in Nantou was slack, and the stock in the wharf gradually increased. It was heard that the sales of city and rural stores were being cut back in the sluice market and suffered from the unloading of the previous market. People's hearts were depressed, and each stomach was sluggish, and transactions were unusually lonely. Selling interest gradually fell, and the market price of thick new japonica rice was also short of nearly one corner. Early indica rice reached the end, but still received sales. The street markets of this city were dull and Ning's stomach was also scattered. The market price fell by two corners. The main street of Du Yangjian remained unchanged and followed the corner outside the cut.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an endless stream of goods arrived on the West Road of the New Sluice. Sales were sluggish, and the accumulation was still thick. Because the price of rice before the Winter Solstice Festival must be low, the opening price of new japonica rice from the northern merchants fell by two corners again in the morning. Early and late rice arrivals were scarce and accumulation was thick. Sales in this city and other merchants were dull. The middle pass goods were low by three corners. The arrival and sales of the three types of Du Jian, Yang Jian, and Bu Jian were even, and the shape was unchanged. The source of Yuanlai goods turned into Yin and were few and sporadic. The liquor stomach was still weak, and the market belonged to Tingxiu, and the foot of the unified market bucket was less than 3,000 stones.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Stories About Tobacco By Fu Lan <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>George Arents of the United States can be regarded as the world's only collector of tobacco books. Books, pamphlets, and ancient judgments are all available, worth a lot of money. Therefore, he specially uses an old iron box to hide those rare versions and copies, with twelve different secret locks added.</p>
<p>He started collecting in 1892, when he was only seventeen years old. One of his uncles was a tobacco grower, so he made this suggestion to him. At present, he is preparing to print a story about tobacco, divided into three volumes, each as thick as a telephone directory, containing many interesting facts, such as Vespucci, who was the first person to mention tobacco in books, in 1505, he saw the Indians of Venezuela grinding tobacco leaves into powder, kneading them into pills, and swallowing them. When they were sitting in canoes and setting off on expeditions, they thought that this could prevent hunger.</p>
<p>The first person to mention smoking in a book was the Spaniard Oviedo, around 1535. He saw the Indians of Haiti burning tobacco and putting it into reed pipes to inhale into their nostrils. As soon as they lit the fire, they immediately sucked frantically. In today's human beings, it will lead to death.</p>
<p>Twelve years later, Oviedo saw some Indians placing dried tobacco leaves on palm leaves, burning them, and inhaling the poisonous gas they emitted. This could make the smoker intoxicated all day long, but no one at the time warned them.</p>
<p>Spenser was the first British writer to mention tobacco. Shakespeare's collection never mentioned tobacco. Arents speculated that this was proof that Shakespeare opposed Bacon, because Bacon mentioned this thing from time to time. Perhaps this great poet, in order to support King James' opposition to smoking, taxed tobacco to 4,000 percent in order to dissuade the people from smoking, so he deliberately avoided mentioning it in his collection of poems.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, there were almost no smokers in England. In the 17th century, smoking was popular throughout England, and all classes competed to smoke as a fashion.</p>
<p>Since snuff rose, smokers gradually decreased, but in the 19th century, smokers revived. In 1864, machines began to be used to make cigarettes, and cigarette rolling machines were invented in 1883, and so on until today.</p>
<p>Tobacco, in general, is considered to be able to treat nasal mucus membranes, cramps, and other diseases. According to Arents' research, during the American Civil War, soldiers applied tobacco under their armpits when they set off to relieve pain.</p>
<p>Arents also found that the world's ancient and modern champion smoker was the Dutchman M.V. Klaes. He died in 1871 at the age of ninety-eight. He smoked about four tons of tobacco in his lifetime. When he was dying, he invited all his smoking comrades and asked them to participate in his funeral together. When the funeral was held, everyone had to smoke, without interruption. At that time, hundreds of comrades came, each given two pipes and ten pounds of tobacco. This funeral was an unprecedented grand event. For a time, the smoke was misty, and people could not be identified on the opposite side.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Wallace Invited to Hollywood By Fu Lan <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Edgar Wallace, the world-renowned British writer, has recently signed a contract with Sneraud, the general manager of an American sound film company, to write a novel for the company. After years of negotiation by many American film companies, they wanted to obtain his creative services, but without results. This time, the company actually achieved its goal, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>The genius of this writer has long been admired by American filmmakers. They continued their efforts to lure him from England to the United States, but finally failed. This time Sneraud's success is also the triumph of the American sound film industry.</p>
<p>This outstanding British writer, among his contemporary world writers, can be regarded as a number of members. He has written hundreds of novels and countless short stories, and has been diligently engaged in this for the past thirty years. In England, he securely sits in a chair among two or three outstanding modern writers.</p>
<p>His books sell millions of copies in the United States every year. His works have been translated into various countries. Mysterious and adventurous stories are especially his forte. In addition to short and long novels, he has also written many scripts, some of which have been performed on Broadway in New York and have been very successful. For example, the play "On the Spot" produced by 勗弁德 Company was performed at the 福來斯德 Theater and is an example.</p>
<p>American theaters first performed his works in 1913. At that time, he had already become a successful novelist. He wrote a script entitled "Manager's Dream," which did not attract attention. So he changed to writing musical comedies, such as "Hello, Everyone," "Are You There," "Smile," "Soldier," "Dihuangniu," and so on.</p>
<p>In 1926, he began writing musical scripts and was listed as the vanguard of a group of London playwrights. First came a "Complete Gentleman," followed by "Terror," "The Man Who Changed His Name," "Flying Squad," "The Howler," "The Unknown," and "Calendar," and so on.</p>
<p>Wallace's signing of the contract is only the beginning of the first step of work on Sneraud's side. They are preparing to set up a method to attract general famous writers to write a valuable original work for the sound film company.</p>

<h3 id="e167">An Overview of Local Autonomy · Dawn · Light <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>By Lin Zhongke</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen said in the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," "During the period of political tutelage, the government should send personnel who have been trained and passed examinations to various counties to assist the people in preparing for self-government..." and also said, "Build local autonomy, promote the development of civil rights." We all know that the Party's revolutionary policy is divided into three stages: military government, political tutelage, and constitutional government. The foundation of constitutional government is laid on political tutelage, and the work of political tutelage is included in local autonomy. It can be seen that the cause of local autonomy is the fundamental work of our Party's unique spirit. In other words, the idea of local autonomy has clearly shifted from a textual program to a political program today. Therefore, at the beginning of this political tutelage, when local autonomy is being carried out, it is not meddlesome for me to introduce this book.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Mr. Lin Zhongke, is a scholar with rich writings. He has had the ideal of realizing local autonomy in his mind for more than ten years. This book is the accumulation of the author's blood and sweat in researching local autonomy for more than ten years.</p>
<p>The book is divided into six chapters. The first chapter is an introduction, the second chapter is the composition of local groups, the third chapter is the organs of local groups, the fourth chapter is the division of local autonomy, the fifth chapter is the application of local autonomy, and the sixth chapter is the supervision of local autonomy. The following is a brief analysis of each chapter:</p>
<p>Chapter 1, Introduction. This chapter explains "the basic concepts of local autonomy." In the middle, the meaning of local autonomy and the mission undertaken by those who handle autonomy are explained in detail.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, Composition of Local Groups. This chapter is divided into three sections. The first section is "the area of local groups," the second section is "the residents of local groups," and the third section is "the citizens of local groups." In the first section, it is divided into the first paragraph, "the nature of the area of local groups," which provides a very detailed explanation of the nature and facilities of the area. The second paragraph, "the changes in the area of local groups," stipulates by law how to change its area scope, and various situations such as the disposal, division, merger, and boundary changes of districts, townships, and towns within the area. The second section is "the residents of local groups." This section explains what constitutes a resident of a local group, and the various corresponding conditions stipulated by law for residents of local groups. The third section is "the citizens of local groups." The first paragraph includes "the meaning and origin of citizens," and the second paragraph is "the requirements of citizens." Here, the author believes that citizens should have both active and passive requirements to be called citizens. The third paragraph talks about "the rights of citizens," which are the four political powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. Based on the Party's position, and referring to various systems in various countries around the world, the author elaborates on the origin and how to use the four political powers. Taking the referendum power alone, the author divides it into six categories in form: (1) mandatory referendum power, (2) arbitrary referendum power, (3) ordinary referendum power, (4) advisory referendum power, (5) consultative referendum power, and (6) approval referendum power.</p>
<p>Moreover, each referendum power has its own special function. The other three political powers are divided and explained as precisely as the referendum power. For readers, this is very clear and does not require much thought.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, Organs of Local Groups. This chapter is divided into two sections. The first section, "the will organ of local groups," such as the county assembly for the local autonomous body of a county, details the nature, organization, powers, and deliberation methods of the county assembly. The second section, "the administrative organ of local groups," such as the county government, clearly explains how the county magistrate should be elected, and what powers the elected county magistrate should have.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Division of Local Autonomy. The first sentence of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's handwritten "Law on the Commencement of Local Autonomy" states, "The scope of local autonomy should be a county as a sufficient area. If a county is not possible, then the combination of several villages with fields of twenty or thirty li in length and width can also be used as a pilot area." From this, it can be seen that Mr. Sun Yat-sen also advocated the division of local autonomy. This chapter is divided into three sections. The first section is "district autonomy," which includes "regarding district people's congress," "district office," "district supervision committee," "district mediation committee," "district finance," etc., all of which have thorough and clear regulations. The second section is "township autonomy," in which the administrative scope is entirely in accordance with legal regulations. The third section is "neighborhood autonomy," whose organization and affairs are simpler than those of districts and townships. Although the scope of neighborhoods is small, the author has not neglected its systematic description due to the narrowness of the scope.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Application of Local Autonomy. At the beginning of this chapter, the author says, "The application of local autonomy means how local autonomous bodies manage their own functions and how they carry out activities in society." Now that political tutelage has begun, and local autonomy is being carried out throughout the country, a basic practical issue regarding "the application of local autonomy" can in no way be neglected. Therefore, the author of this book has listed many actual situations in society in a concrete way as citations for each section of this chapter.</p>
<p>This chapter is divided into three sections. The first section is "Basic Concepts of Autonomy." This section is explained from two points: one is "the foundation of autonomy," and the other is "inherent affairs and delegated affairs." The foundation of autonomy is the autonomous ability recognized by the national legal system. Here, the author explains in detail the meaning and function of the five powers of government, and describes the comparison between the autonomy of various European countries and the autonomy of our country.</p>
<p>The second section is "the Administrative Management Power of Local Groups," which is divided into "the meaning of the right to organize," "the content of the organization," "the right to formulate laws and regulations," "the content of the right to formulate autonomous laws and regulations," "the process of formulating regulations," "the limits of public labor management," "the application of the right to public labor management," and "coercive power," explaining one by one how local areas should set up and how they should reform or abolish affairs. Those who care about social problems can get many concrete remedies and facility policies here, which is of great help to those currently engaged in the labor movement.</p>
<p>The third section is "the Financial Management Power of Local Groups," regarding "property management rights," "expenditure financial rights," "expenditure of local autonomous bodies," "local taxes," and "public burden," the author, based on public finance, gives a very full explanation of how local autonomous bodies should manage the above items.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Supervision of Local Autonomy. Before we can understand what the supervision of local autonomy is, we naturally need to know what supervision is first. Fortunately, regarding this urgent question to be answered, the author has clearly answered it for us in the book: "The meaning of supervision should be divided into two points: one is supervision in the relationship of public law, and the other is supervision in the relationship of private law. The former is like the 'legislative supervision,' 'judicial supervision,' and 'administrative supervision' of various countries, and the latter is like the supervision of an agent over a sub-agent, the supervision of an employer over an employee, and the supervision of a person with parental authority over an incapable person."</p>
<p>This chapter is divided into two sections. The first section is "Basic Concepts of Autonomous Supervision." This section is divided into three key points: one is "the necessity of autonomous supervision," two is "the form of autonomous supervision," and three is "the organs of autonomous supervision." The second section is "the content of the supervisory power," which includes nine items: the power of monitoring, the power to cancel orders and dispositions, the power of substitute resolution, the power of special resolution and disposition, the power of substitute execution, the power of dissolution, the power of disciplinary action, the power of approval, and the reservation of decision power. The above powers all have their own meanings and tasks. Although the names are different, they are all mutually conditional and mutually related. After the establishment of public offices such as districts and townships, autonomous supervision will perform its duties to seek lasting welfare for the local groups concerned.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above chapters, I believe that this book is the most comprehensive and substantial book on local autonomy. In fact, there is a pitiful lack of books on relatively perfect local autonomy in China today. The author has created this voluminous work of more than 100,000 words as a result of more than ten years of painstaking research. It is truly a brilliant flower blooming in academic circles, and it is undeniable that it serves as a guiding light for those who handle local autonomy. The period of political tutelage has unfolded before our eyes. In order to promote the early realization of the work of local autonomy, I am happy to introduce this book to readers. I sincerely pray that this voluminous work with rich materials will achieve great results in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The continuous drizzle has made our joyful mood, following the gloomy weather, also become gloomy. In the classroom, several classmates, full of energy, blew out the melody of the famous movie song "Ramona" from their harmonicas. But although the sound of the harmonica was still as clear and melodious as before, and as pleasing to our ears, the singing of the classmates to the sound of the harmonica was not as happy, not as melodious, and not as foot-tapping as before, as if they were about to prepare to dance. Really, how can an unhappy mood be made happy, except for that true and automatic happiness?</p>
<p>"Oh, this stuffy weather, stuffy rain, stuffy classroom, stuffy homework, it's really suffocating us to death!" Yang said after the sound of the harmonica stopped, with a "stuffy" character in each sentence.</p>
<p>"Originally, being a student is of course stuffy. Aren't we even more stuffy than birds trapped in cages? Although birds are trapped in their narrow world, their cries, their jumps, their eats are all free. When they feel happy, they freely cry or jump. When they want to eat, they eat some food. There is nothing uncomfortable. But we are not as free as birds trapped in cages. The 'dang...' of the class bell fundamentally stops our liveliness, our wanting to do whatever we want to do, our wanting to say whatever we want to say!" Classmate Wang complained. She loves freedom the most. She thinks all the rules in the school seem to bind her rigidly.</p>
<p>"To be honest, school is a place that eats people. If my dad didn't force me to go to school, I would definitely not be sitting stuffily in the classroom like this. Think about it, what we learn is not what we will use in society in the future. So we are wasting our energy to diligently research it." Wang's comrade Lu continued. She is very smart, but usually she doesn't do in-depth research on anything, like homework. She is a negative person who holds the sixty-point doctrine. After the exam, she got the news that she "might pass," and she was so happy about it.</p>
<p>We all regret Wang and Lu, for using their agile brains to work on writing love letters. They despise being at the top of the list, and do not require scores above sixty points. Therefore, the two of them are willing to fall behind silently, and are unwilling to compete with anyone, nor are they jealous of anyone. Therefore, the words "friends of sloppy mud" have become their nicknames.</p>
<p>"It is indeed a waste of energy to diligently research it. Think about it, how easy it is to be a Lady. What we are currently learning, which Lady has ever used it? What Ladies need to know is just how to serve their husbands." Shen said dimly, seeming to sigh. She absolutely regretted Wang and Lu, so the more she regretted, the more she used words to ridicule them. At the same time, Shen is such a person, advocating that in school, one subject must be mastered. Several classmates have ridiculed her, and she said frankly, "Since it is not necessary to know everything completely, why does the school have to require us to read everything, and to pass?" We couldn't think of appropriate words to answer her, so we just shouted "Good student, good student."</p>
<p>Shen's sarcastic words did not have any repercussions for Wang and Lu. They said indifferently, as if they didn't care, "Say whatever you want, say whatever you want."</p>
<p>We were also silent, not adding any opinions to either side.</p>
<p>○　　　　○　　　　　○</p>
<p>Today in Chinese class, the teacher returned our composition books. After everyone took them from the teacher's hand, they all lowered their heads to read. Only Wang and Lu were still sitting uneasily, looking up at the teacher.</p>
<p>"Wang and Lu definitely won't pass," a voice gently entered my ear.</p>
<p>But the teacher suddenly said aloud with a smile, "Wang ×× and Lu ××, this time their compositions have improved a lot. The meaning of their writing is better than anyone else's. I will explain it to you... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... "</p>
<p>While we were quietly listening, we were thinking that they probably had an awakening after listening to Shen's words.</p>

<p>— Jin</p>
<p>The English teacher hurried into the classroom, panting and wiping the sweat from his forehead. His two bony eyes looked around nervously, and that situation really made people pity him.</p>
<p>"Oh, teacher, so early. Class has been in session for ten minutes!" Ms. Zhang said to the teacher with a mocking expression.</p>
<p>"Oh, class has been in session for ten minutes? No, it seems early," the teacher said in surprise while looking at his watch.</p>
<p>"Then why not sit and rest at home for a while longer?" Ms. Zhang said coldly.</p>
<p>"Ha, teacher, your watch is probably sleeping," Ling said to the teacher with a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, my watch is slow," the teacher said slowly.</p>
<p>"So your watch is slow. But when it's time for class, the bell won't ring because you haven't come. It's unlikely that it will ring when you come," Ms. Zhang said to the teacher hatefully, revealing a contemptuous expression.</p>
<p>"Teacher, call the roll," Ling seemed a little impatient with Ms. Zhang's words. She glared at Ms. Zhang hatefully, and then said to the teacher.</p>
<p>The teacher slowly put down the roll call book and called the roll. His expression was helpless.</p>
<p>While calling the roll, Ling said softly to her seatmate Juan, "There's no such thing. The teacher was a few minutes late, and she's so rude to the teacher. Really, the teacher is too kind... Hey, look, she's making faces at the teacher."</p>
<p>Hearing this, I couldn't help but quickly turn my head to look at her. I saw Ms. Zhang closing her eyes, opening her mouth wide, and shaking her tongue rapidly from left to right.</p>
<p>At this time, the teacher was teaching, and it was very quiet.</p>
<p>"I don't understand, I don't understand, I don't understand what you're saying!" Ms. Zhang immediately broke the silence, shouting like a riot, and didn't listen to the teacher repeating the section for her. She just chatted and laughed with her classmates sitting in a corner.</p>
<p>"Hey, look at the teacher's robe. It's so big and long, haha, isn't he like a big lantern?" Zhen began to criticize the teacher.</p>
<p>"No, he looks more like a clown on the stage," Fen followed her.</p>
<p>"I hate his face the most. It looks like a crying ghost. That mouth moves and moves like an old woman. And those hairs don't comb it light, you don't see like a rotten rice stalk?"</p>
<p>"I hate his annoying voice the most. It's not like Mandarin, it's not like dialect. Listening to it makes people want to throw up even rice. Listen, "ze gou" "ze gou" I don't know why he has to read it like that. Can't he read "this"?" Rui said softly.</p>
<p>"Oh, how come, teacher, you're talking so fast?" Ms. Zhang said with a surprised look.</p>
<p>"It's not fast, maybe you're not listening," the teacher said.</p>
<p>"How do you know I'm not listening? I was clearly listening," Ms. Zhang said angrily.</p>
<p>"Then I'll ask you, where did I talk to?" the teacher said.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask me when you're lecturing? Did you forget where you talked to?" Ms. Zhang said with a red face.</p>
<p>Dang, dang, dang, finally the class was over. The teacher hurriedly ran out of the classroom, as if escaping from hell.</p>
<p>○　　　○　　　○</p>
<p>The next one was political science. Class had been in session for a long time, but the teacher hadn't come yet, so the students started rioting. Suddenly, a series of crisp leather shoe sounds knocked in the corridor. After a while, the classroom door opened. The political science teacher was wearing a brand new suit, with a felt hat on his head, and carrying a large black leather bag in his hand. His shoulders were raised up, as if carrying a load on a pole, and he walked in.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhang started talking to the teacher again, "Oh, teacher, why are you late today? We've been waiting for a long time, almost a quarter of an hour!"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, it's still early," the teacher said slowly, looking at Ms. Zhang.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's still early, I'm afraid class hasn't even started yet... the time to dismiss class is coming soon."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't bother so much. What's the point of rioting like this?" Ms. Zhang suddenly broke their conversation and said seriously.</p>
<p>This class was really quiet, no one was rioting. Ms. Zhang quietly looked at the teacher's glowing hair, with a smile on her face. In the silence, the sound of Ms. Zhang's conversation in that corner could be heard.</p>
<p>"The teacher's hair is really shiny. I wonder what he put on it. It's also a little fragrant. Can you smell it?" Ms. Zhang said, staring blankly at the teacher's face.</p>
<p>"I can't smell it. Your sense of smell can be considered extremely sensitive," Hui said coldly.</p>
<p>"His suit is really good-looking. Comparing it with the English teacher's robe, it's really a world apart," Ms. Zhang said again.</p>
<p>"Hey, Zhang, you're a little... you probably love him," Hui said to Zhang jokingly.</p>
<p>"Bah, don't talk nonsense," Ms. Zhang said with a red face.</p>
<p>"Hey, Zhang, his face is really beautiful, look, why don't you look?" Yun said to Zhang with a smile.</p>
<p>"Oh, his hair is really fragrant, shiny and bright, it can reflect your face from his hair, but it's your mirror of love," Juan said in the silence, revealing a contemptuous expression, ridiculing.</p>
