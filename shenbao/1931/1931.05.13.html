<h3 id="c7">印度之銀傾銷 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>據今日華盛頓電訊。運動銀會議之中國代表。將往倫敦。希望與英相接洽後。至少可以在國際銀會議召集前。暫行停止印度之銀傾銷。蓋銀之供給遇多。實爲銀價低跌之一原因。印度苟能停止傾銷。誠於安定銀價策劃。不無裨益。然而欲得印政府同意。恐又甚難。蓋此議美議員畢特門氏。早已先中國代表倡之。謂世界各國不妨在美國領導下。向英政府磋商停止其售賣印度銀之破壞大局辦法。則銀價無疑的可以恢復。但英國尙未能同意於此舉。觀月前英保守黨議員凱式爾司蒂華伯爵。在下院向財長施諾登建議。請其與有關係各政府。接洽限制售銀事件。而施氏之答詞。則絶不承認出售廢幣生銀。爲銀價低落之一原因。并表示不願提議接洽限制售銀事。其所言正與畢氏之主張。針鋒相對。由此可見中國代表。雖有赴英接洽之熱心。而其難得滿美之結果。已可預料。又據外電謂。各國皆不願居銀會發起人之列。英旣以印度而感爲難。美亦因戰債而多躊躇。日本雖尙無表示。恐亦未必願爲此會倡始之人。觀此則又知非特印度銀傾銷之接洽。無多希望。即銀會議之召集。亦已無一往之勇氣。蓋用金各國。總不免各有維護己方利益之意。且銀問題之牽連關係甚多。利害一有衝突。會議即生障碍。穩定銀價之策劃。誠不易言矣。</p>

<p>（南京）　何應欽在國民會議席上、對於國民政府勦滅赤匪報告説明如下、主席、各位代表同志、關於國民政府勦滅赤匪的報告、今天已經有印刷品分散與諸位、本人奉主席的命、特來説明一下、裏邊詳細情形、大家可以自己參閲、現在只指出幾個重要的地方使大家對於勦滅赤匪這一件事、有更深切的了解、爲什麽赤匪能有現在的猖獗呢、這是值得我們首先注意的一點、少微分析一下、便可以看出有五個很重要的原因、第一、自然是由於歷年軍閥的叛變、散軍潰卒嘯集成匪、槍支遺失的旣多、於是他們就憑藉地勢肆行不軌、第二、是由於赤色帝國主義者之毒計、他因爲想暗中併呑中國、去供給他的原料、銷售他的產品、所以用種種方法、豢養他的走狗以爲奸細、同時也想利用他走狗的力量去脅威歐美、得到他外交上的勝利、所以也不惜以中國爲犧牲、我們知道我們歷史上的流寇也有計多、但是與現在不同的、就是現在的赤匪是有國際背境、挾有經濟的後援、有組織的指揮與訓練、所以更形猖獗了、第三、是由於白色帝國主義者之經濟侵略以致於農村瀕於破產、增加了農村裏的失業人數與痛苦、因此也有爲生活所迫不能當兵、就去從匪的、第四、則是由於過去敎育制度的不良、青年在學校裏、頂好的只注意了知的訓練而缺少了德的修養、所以多數的青年、只有一時熱烈的衝動、很少有沈毅持久的操守、於是在衝動的反面甚至趨於堕落與消沉、赤匪就利用這一個心理的弱點、把純潔的青年、做他們的工具了、其次敎育缺少職業的訓練、仍就養成士大夫習氣的遺留、除了從政治上謀生活以外、其他無甚辦法、所以赤匪乃能誘之以領袖慾、豢之以少數的羅卜了、第五、是由於中國社會組織的鬆懈、中國因爲受了數千年專制的毒害、又遭了軍閥的宰割、所以社會上簡直失去了自動的能力、連保衛自己的願望與勇氣、都不容易實現出來、所以歷代的流寇士匪、總是狡點無賴的流民驅使着良善無辜的百姓、他們爲匪所刦掠爲匪所脅迫、還要爲匪所驅使、而且多數犧牲的也就是他們、這也是赤匪之能如此猖獗之一點、由着這些緣故、赤匪的毒害、便如潰瘡一様的爛起來、江西人民被匪慘殺者、差不多十八萬六千人、難民流亡的差不多二百十萬人、焚燒的房屋、總有十萬多棟、財產的損失、更可怕了、有六萬萬五千萬元之鉅、穀米的損失、有三千九百萬石之多、湖南被匪慘害的有七萬二千人、房屋被燒的有十二萬多棟、財產的損失差不多三萬萬餘元、湖北的損失、現在還没有詳細的調查、（未完）</p>

<p>（南京）　國民政府勦滅赤匪報告全文如下、</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>中國目前最大之禍患、厥爲赤匪、國民政府與全國人民當前最急要之工作、亦莫過於撲滅赤匪、赤匪之禍患、其已發露於江西湖南等處者、固正在政府與當地人民協力撲滅之中、而其潛伏於他處、冀圖使各省均爲江西與湖南之續者、亦已漸露其端、而實不容吾人之忽視、以各地受匪殘害之種種事實言之、赤匪之存在與蔓延、不惟於中國民族之生存與發展不能相容、且於全國人民、各個人之生命與生計不能並立、故撲滅赤匪之工作、在政府固應始終盡其敢善之努力、而實則必全國人民盡能了解赤匪之毒害與罪惡、週知赤匪與民族生存羣衆生命國民生計不能相容之事實、人人起而以消弭赤匪肅清赤匪之責自任、夫然後中國前途之最大禍患、乃能於最短期間澈底消除、</p>
<p>（二）赤匪毒害</p>
<p>近年以來、受赤匪茶毒而最烈而最慘者、厥爲江西與湖南、而湖北次之、今試即就贛湘二省有形之損失言之、其統計已至堪驚人、江西人民被匪慘殺者約十八萬六千人難民之流亡者約二百十萬人、各縣被匪焚燬之民房約十萬餘楝、財產之損失約六萬五千萬元、穀米之損失約三千九百萬擔、湖南之匪患、蔓延雖不若江西之廣、而損</p>
<h3 id="c13">（附）中國共產黨僞中央政治局組織系統表 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>水等二十五縣、股匪出没未徧全境者有上饒廣豐玉山等三十一縣、其間人民之　息流離倖免於死者、亦勢將無以爲生、更就鄂省而言、則如沔陽潛江監利石首公安等縣、與洪湖匪巢接近、受禍最烈、而麻城羅田黃岡黃安黃梅孝感通城崇陽大冶鄂城等處、亦無不備受赤匪之蹂躪、吾人設想、若使贛湘鄂之匪禍次第延及於各省、則每年全國人口之損失當在五百萬人以上、財產之損失當在八十萬萬元以上、寗非駭人聽聞之尤者乎、</p>
<p>夫赤匪之所以自任毁壞新中國生命之責者、實受赤色帝國主義之嗾使、民國十六年、其黨翼即散佈於湘鄂贛粤等省、製造中國之内亂、五年以來、焚殺淫刦、罪惡昭著、擢髮難數舉其最動人心魄之浩刦、當推十六年八月南昌之變、同年十一月廣州之變十九年七月長沙之亂、同年十月吉安之亂、其他如廣東海陸豐、福建之龍巖永定、江西之上饒永新銅鼓弋陽、湖南之平江瀏陽華容、湖北之沔陽黃安監利、河南之商城等縣、均曾經赤匪攻佔組織僞蘇維埃政府、僞紅軍指揮部、僞軍事委員會等機關、而肅反委員會之殘殺良民、財政委員會之綁票勒贖、尤爲各地人民之所痛心疾首、凡赤匪蹂躪之區、男女八歲以上十六歲以下者、編爲兒童團、十六歲以上二十三歲以下者、編爲少年先鋒隊、二十三歲以上四十歲以下者、編爲赤衛隊、以甲村而推乙村、以一失亦不相上下、計被匪慘殺者約七萬二千人、房屋被燬者約十二萬楝、財產之損失約三萬萬元、當匪禍最熾之時、江西全省八十一縣之中、計全縣有匪者、有寗都興國安福永新弋陽等十一縣、大部有匪者、有瑞昌修水銅鼓萬載萍鄉吉安吉鄉而及一縣、日夜迫脅暴動、所至十室九空統計全國曾被匪禍之地、蓋達三百縣以上、設長此以往、全國國民不再奮起一致引撲滅赤匪爲己任、則新中國未來之生命必將如赤色帝國主義之願望而中斬、</p>
<p>（三）赤匪罪惡</p>
<p>抑赤匪之爲崇、猶不僅使吾全國人民受物質上之有形損失已也、其處心積慮所蓄之陰謀、乃在於赤色帝國主義卵翼之下、直接利用青年男女農民工人以破滅吾國之社會基礎與濟基礎而間接亦即所以破滅青年男女農民工人自身之生命蓋吾國社會基礎爲家庭、而家庭之新生命即爲青年男女設匪一方利用青年好奇心理之弱點、煽惑青年男女爲種種反叛家庭之慘害舉動而社會唯一基礎之家庭爲所破毁矣、他方更乘青年血血氣未定之弱點、誘使一般男女自由縱慾、則家庭之新生命又爲所戝賊矣、若使此種破滅社會基礎之禍患未除、則中國民族非至滅種不止、同時、赤匪之於工人、則故意提出不合生產狀况之過度、以增加工資减少工時改良待遇等口號誘惑之、使無間斷的從事於踰越範圍之日常鬥爭、而希圖罷工暴動之形成、於農民、則以抗捐抗税没收土地等口號誘惑之、使無間斷的從事於殺人放火之殘酷鬥等、而希圖各地零星騷動之擴大、由此兩種鬥爭之結果、則城市經濟與農村經濟之基礎必全被摧毁而其所利用之農民工人、即一時奪得若干土地或加得多少工資、亦終必以資本枯竭工廠倒閉之故、無所施其勞力、而流離死亡之慘乃更甚於前矣、此種破滅經濟基礎之禍患不除、則全國人民之生計固將斷喪凈盡、而受禍最烈者當仍爲貧苦農工之自身、　　（四）勦匪情形</p>
<p>中央深知赤匪禍源之所在、與夫民生疾苦之所由、故自十六年四月清黨十七年統一全國以後、一方盡量宣傳三民主義之思想、以破青年男女農民工人之迷夢、一方調集國軍、設法勦辦、漸收成效、不難絶其根株、無如張唐閻馮各軍閥、先後背叛、中央爲鎭壓反動實現統一起見、所有國軍各部隊、大半調赴前方、遂予赤匪以絶好機會、而湘贛二省匪勢乃復漸形猖獗、此則中央所引爲萬分痛心、而反動軍閥之所以罪在不赦者也、一航民衆因生活艱難知識薄弱、多被赤匪裏脅入夥、而各地盜匪流氓、更以臭味相投之故、相率被其吸收、於是朱德毛澤東在贛南有槍二三萬枝此外各處赤匪之有槍千餘枝或數百枝、尙有二十餘股、分　各處、互爲援應、而聲勢遂日覺其囂張、十九年、中央一面調集大軍、討伐閻馮、一面酌留部隊、鞏固後方、祇以後方兵力較薄、未收圓滿效果、自閻之亂旣平、中央决以全部兵力、從事清剿赤匪、特派大員、赴贛督師、現計國軍入贛者已逾二十萬人、兵力雄厚、勢如破竹、匪災區域、如吉安永豐萬安崇仁樂安興國　部信豐廣昌修水銅鼓等縣、均已先後克復、贛省赤匪、勢窮力蹙、各部匪酋、頓起恐慌、於是欲將湘南鄂西各股集中鄂西、贛省全部各股集中贛南、以作最後掙扎、一方擬用避實擊虚、東竄突之游擊方法、希圖苟延殘喘、而一方則欲鼓動湘鄂贛閩蘇皖各省之流民暴動、以爲虚張聲勢之計、蓋赤匪固已自知國軍合圍之勢已成、根基覆滅之日殆至也、</p>
<p>就剿匪之國軍方面言之、明知赤匪原爲烏合之衆、不足當有紀律軍隊之一擊、然匪徒善於輾轉趨避、出没無常、或憑恃天險、相與抵抗、或化裝農民、擾我視線、加之匪區遼闊山嶺深　、絶不能以正或作戰之方略、施之星羅棋布之赤匪、故决定妥善佈置、嚴密搜索、然後匪無所逞、自可聚而殲之、而匪區克復以後、如何恢復秩序、如何安撫流亡、使民衆得以安居樂業、不致再爲赤匪所乘、則政府固有待於全國國民之協作矣、　　（五）赤匪之來源</p>
<p>夫剿匪原爲政府之職責、而曷爲必有賴於全國國民之合作、蓋赤匪之指揮者、直接爲中國共產黨、間接爲赤色帝國主義、確有整個的陰謀、而非若局部流寇之可等閒視之者也、蓋第三國際時於中國所抱持之一貫陰謀、乃在以共產主義迷惑吾國之人心使吾國之農民工人時起暴亂、乃至使吾國各種職業界自相鬥爭、以冀造成全國人民流離失業之普遍現象、更由中國人民流離失業之普遍現象、以冀引起歐美各國之經濟恐慌與工商業之倒閉、彼時全世界人民均陷於失業之境、而彼赤國帝國主義即自以世界革命之理想可以實現、故赤色帝國主義之陰謀、無論其所號召共產主義之理論如何、而其必欲先以中國民族作犧牲以供彼時歐美各國逞憤洩怨之資、則已昭然若揭、赤色帝國主義因有此種陰謀、遂豢養其所謂共產黨徒者、對於中國實施勾結軍閥助長内亂、煽惑游民、麻醉青年、分裂民衆、鼓動土匪、散播謠言、破壞地方之種種計劃、重以中國過去軍閥之割據、人民生計之憔悴、智識之幼稚、與夫統一和平之大業未能早日完成、故赤色帝國主義之種種陰謀與計劃、乃得乘虚而入、藉中國共產黨徒爲工具而潛播其一部分之惡根於社會、以致釀成今日赤匪之禍患、證以政府所獲之情報、中國共產黨、在赤色帝國主義卵翼之下、於僞中央設政治局、負指揮各地赤匪組織各地蘇維埃之最高責任、其下則有長江局、南方局、北方局、滿洲局、與江南省委、（見附表）雖目前彼所最視爲重要者、厥爲長江局與江南省委、希圖奪取上海與武漢之大城市爲其活動之中心、然以若輩頻年失敗之餘、難保不移轉其目光於南方北方與關外、利用其潛伏之分子、以作萬一之蠢動、而赤匪之流毒更將徧於全國矣、於此可知今日之赤匪、實赤色帝國主義者與吾國落伍軍人無聊政客以及地痞流氓惡少土匪之混雜體、而其流毒所及、實足以危害中國民族之生存、戕賊中國羣衆之生命、斷絶中國人民之生計、固不僅已　殘害之匪區受其　毒已也、</p>
<p>不寗惟是、赤色帝國主義者侵略中東鐵路以後、於去年七月十五日所决定對於中國之計晝、不僅利用中國人民多數貧弱與内戰爲時過久之弱點、盡量在社會上勾結游民土匪、破壞農村秩序、在文藝上收買無恥文丐、鼓吹所謂普羅文學、在政治上宣傳匪化之共產主義、欲使中國成爲人民失業内亂不息之國家、而斷絶亞洲與歐美各國之通商、且在軍事上更有積極之準備、以期併呑中國、供其宰制、彼所謂積極之軍事計畫者即（一）由外蒙蘇維埃境内、經上烏金斯克庫倫至張家口之路綿、自由運輸各種人員武器與共產宣傳品、以入於中國之北部、（二）以赤色帝國主義之敎官訓練外蒙軍隊、而充實其唐克車飛機等等之最新戰鬥的設備、（三）中東鐵路之共產黨徒、密爲軍事之組織、以備一旦啟釁可以立刻擾害東北各省、（四）在西伯利亞東部貝加爾省黑河及沿海省、佈置二個軍團之重兵、以示威脅、而備將來作戰之用、由此更可知赤色帝國主義之謀我、乃習用其内應外合之策略、必欲使中國全國淪爲赤色帝國主義之屬地而後已、而湘鄂贛及其他各省之赤匪實無殊以古代式流寇之資格爲彼作呑併中國之虎倀也、</p>
<p>（六）結論</p>
<p>夫赤匪成因之複雜旣如此、赤匪流毒之蔓延又如彼、則赤匪之得撲滅與否、實中國今後人民生死、民族存亡所繫之關　、而决非僅涉一部分人民或一政治團體之細故、政府旣下剿滅赤匪之决心、自必無間始終以求其貫澈、惟吾全國國民究宜如何羣策羣力、協助政府、排除萬　、以完成此安定社會鞏統一和平之任務、則不得不有望於國民會議予以確切詳盡之方針矣、</p>

<p>（附答吳研因先生）　尙仲衣（二）</p>
<p>（二）引起興趣擁護童話者多稱兒童喜悦此類的故事、而我們確又常常聽見兒童懇切地要求「眞的」故事、究竟兒童是否眞喜悦幻想性的讀物、只有長時期有系統客觀的觀察和精密的實騐方可解答、决非空談强辯所能爲力、此類的觀察尙屬闕如、然實地試騐確已給我們不少的智識、據近年鄧恩Ｄｕｎｎ精細的探討、「幻想性」不惟不能引起興趣、對於男孩反略生反感、此外曾作過關於讀物興趣之嚴密的研究的如推孟Ｔｅｒｍａｎ趙登Ｊｏｒａｎ余爾ＵｈＩ等人都告訴我們「幻想性」决不是引起興趣的最好的材料、更不是激發愛好的唯一方法、在不違反自然現象的範圍以内能引起興味的、正多着呢、</p>
<p>退一步講、姑假定鄧恩、趙登等的探討、都含有錯誤或都不適合於中國兒童、再假定「幻想性」確可引起中國兒童的興趣、那末、這種興趣所趨、我們就可以無條件的跟隨嗎、敎育者是否有移轉好尙的責任、兒童喜糖果、應否給以節制、幼兒見物輒欲此爲已有、應否加以抑止所以、即使「幻想性」果能引起興趣、尙須於兒童有益無損、方可採納、何况我們根本就懷欵它引起興味的能力呢、更何况我們還覺得它的價舉可欵而它的危機層層呢、</p>
<p>（三）包含敎訓　或有人以爲童話的價值在它字襄行間的寓意、爲討論便利計、是否包含敎訓即是好讀物、姑且不論即就包含敎訓本身講、我們覺得根據事實和可能材料的敎訓、其效力恐必較大於根據不可能幻想的敎訓、幻想的寓意、有時成人尙且難於領受、何况兒童、根據於不可能材料的敎訓、兒童明知其爲虚懸僞設、何能引起他信心、</p>
<p>總括以上三節、我們覺得童話的價值實屬可疑、維持它在兒童讀物上的地位之種種理由、實不充分、所謂「啟發想像」「引起興趣」、包含敎訓」云云、皆在成有或無之間、而不違背自然現象的讀物皆「可有」童話「或有或無之價值、「童話之危機」</p>
<p>從心理分折的觀點看來、童詞最類似夢中的幻境和心理病態人的幻想、成人而過於浸沉於幻想、尙且有害於心理健廉、何况兒童、</p>
<p>兒童早年的目我識本强、敎育者在此時正宜輔助他、使之日漸適應客觀的實在、在此種正當適應進行之時、若給他一種與所要適應的客觀實在相違背的材料、消極方面可以阻碍他的正當適應之進行、積極方面或可構成變態的適應、在這適應進程的第一步、敎育者務須洋意、不使兒童早年就養成樂於離開實在而浸沉於幻想之中的心景、不致使他養成向幻想中求滿足的趨向、</p>
<p>成人入以他的閲歷經騐、遇着世路的崎嶇、事實之難於應付、尙且往往因畏難而生變態的心景、而搆成「向幻想中求滿足」、「萬事由天」、「酸葡萄」、「甜檸檬」等聊解嘲的心理、兒童旣少閲歷經騐、還要適應這紛亂複雜的成人社會、輔之導之、尙恐其不能應付實在的環境、尙恐其流於變態的心景、何得眩之以幻想、惑之以非非、</p>
<p>童話中的主人翁、多半皆由偶然的神奇僥倖的贊助而達到目的、絶少由直接的努力、和忠實的奮進而造成幸福的、祗就此一點論、多半的童話都在淘汰之列、因爲我們對兒童對社會的責任、是在敎兒童去用忠實的努力以謀社會及個人的福利、决不當鼓勵如童話中的許多不勞而獲的幸福、</p>
<p>要而言之、童話的危機約可歸納爲下列數點、（一）易阻碍兒童適應客觀的實在之進行、（二）易習於離開實現生活而向幻想中逃遁的心理、（三）易流於在幻想中救滿足或祈求不勞而獲的趨向、（四）易養成兒童對實現生活的畏𪭟心及厭惡心、（五）易流於離奇錯亂思想的程序、</p>
<p>（我的立塲）在一般人的心目中、一談到兒童讀物、立即聯想到童話、（包括關於神仙物語以及其他幻想的故事）且時常把兒童讀物和童話混而爲一、這是極不幸的、仲衣對於童話的作戰中、有請求於敎育同志者是、</p>
<p>（一）務須把「兒童讀物」和「童話」兩名詞闢關、且</p>
<p>認定童話只不過是兒童讀物中的極小部分、縱使把童話全部流放了、兒童讀物仍有極廣極富的　的、再者、關於童話價值及流弊的分折、我們可歸納爲兩點、甲、童話的價值實在可欵、乙、童話在下意識的危機實在很多、以價值可疑而危機甚多的材料去侵占兒童實貴的光陰、可否、與其用這種讀物、何不用那有童話的價值而無其危機的根據於事實和可能材料的讀物、所以、（二）務須將童話所占之兒童的時間削縮至最低限度—將大部分的時間讓與不違反自然現象的讀物、</p>
<p>（三）對於童話本身的要求、就是把童話的數量大加删削、格外審愼地選擇、（關於此類的選擇、將另草一文以討論、）祗可保留其眞有藝術價值和遊戲興趣的第一流的童話、例如吉柏林的「」象兒「或洛夫廷的「　里德大夫、」（祗用其第一本）保留和　擇的格言是「寗跌勿濫「、</p>
<p>（附對於吳研因先一的疑間之解答）</p>
<p>吳先生對於仲衣在兒童敎育社的講演曾在上月二十九日申報三十日新聞報中發表其意見、並</p>
<p>提出五項疑問、除一·二·三四等條在上文中已有當然的解答外、今且順便將其餘的兩條解答如次、</p>
<p>吳（疑問）神怪故事是否應該以合情理不合情理爲取　尙（解答）不惟神怪故事、一切敎材及讀物、（除少數滑　材料之外）都應以合乎情理不合乎情理爲取捨標準之一、成人們有何權利拿「不合乎情理」的材料給兒童、</p>
<p>吳（疑問）尙先生所説鳥獸不言而專述動物生活的故事、又是什麽、尙（解答）從這個問題看來、彷彿是吳先生以爲離了物語就没有關於動物的讀物了、仲衣就很誠　地向吳先生介紹ＪｅａｎＨｅｎｒｉ　Ｆａｂｒｅ的著作、讀了以後、或不致再有這様問題、也或可給吳先生心目中的兒童讀物另闢一片新的園地、（完）</p>

<p>（六）注　師範敎育　敎師爲國民敎育之母、換言、之即爲民族之本、蓋其爲民族文化之承轉人、無論欲保存民族文化、或發展民族天才、皆非頼其力量不可、此敎育當局之所宜注重師範敎育也、一·師範學校應以公立爲原則、不得自由設立、二·師範敎育應特别注重、須以最適宜之科學敎育、及最嚴格之身心訓練、養成一般國民道德上學術上最健全之師資爲主要之任務、</p>
<p>（七）厲行科學敎育　此爲中國敎育當前之問題、蓋科學不振、則實業不興、而民生凋敝、國勢貧弱、又科學不振、則民智不開、迷信不除、大足爲革命進行之障碍、中山先生有鑒於此、故於科學敎育、極力提倡、（常提倡科學知識之輸入）今日國民政府應提出一宗欵項、專爲發展科學敎育之用、</p>
<p>（八）保障敎育獨立　此有兩層意義、一·敎育經費獨立、（即國民黨政　所規定者、「…增高敎育經費、並保障其獨立」）凡全國敎育經費、應由敎育界自身徵收、保管、與支配、而他種機關不得任意挪動、二·敎育界用人權獨立、上至敎育部長、下至小學幼稚園敎師、對於其專業地位、有相當之保障、而於人員之甄拔、任用調遷、降黜、罷免、有一定之標準、兩種獨立中、「敎育經費」尤爲重要、蓋敎育經費不獨立、則無敎育基金、而「敎育救國」亦必無希望、</p>
<p>其他如提倡人格敎育、實施政治敎育、注重軍事敎育、改良鄉村敎育、施行勞工敎育、注重商業敎育以及改良敎職員待遇、與奬勵敎職員學術著作等、亦皆爲今後國民敎育應注意之點、</p>
<p>總之國民敎育之普及與否、與國家强弱之關係極密切、余甚望此次國民會議、對於國民敎育之實施、能在法律上有詳細之規定、使全國民皆爲健全之分子、以促成憲政焉、（完）</p>

<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>歐陸之名城凡四。樸穆軒偉。而饒歷史之價值者。首推羅馬。崢嶸藝苑。獨放奇葩。以構成近世文化之中心者。厥惟巴黎。謹嚴莊麗。以表現科學之精神者。當推柏林。他如人口之繁衍。執經濟界之牛耳。藉工商之發展。磅礴近世者。當以英倫爲巨擘焉。</p>
<p>倫敦跨太晤士河兩岸。北爲市都。建築巍峨。廣厦連雲。南岸工廠林立。濃烟蔽天。人口七百餘萬。可狀之爲人類蜂房。此城曾罹兩次浩刦。一六六五年大疫。一六六六年大火。全市蕩爲灰燼。死者七萬人。英人乃重建倫敦市。愚於去夏獲一遊焉。下車後。徑謁施公使。晤談殊暢。并導觀使館。及中山先生當年倫敦被難時拘禁之室。室在三樓。僅堪容膝。牖外有鐵欄。光線黝然。想見當時鐵窗風味。施公使并介紹使館秘書孫君式甫。爲之嚮導。殊可感也。</p>
<p>英國國會。爲世界之濫觴。踞太晤士河畔。占地三萬方米突。工程十年。費英金三百萬鎊。爲倫敦市名建築之一。有塔三座。巍峙東西。中有廳約數百間。輝煌金碧。氣象森嚴。壁間繪歷代君王畫像及彫刻。其議塲座位。約五百席。而議員人數。計六百七十人。多數出席時。未占席位者。即後立無發言權。英人以首創國會制號召當世。而事實之紊亂不規則如是。殊可怪也。</p>
<p>維斯民司脱敎堂Wstminster　Abbey建築於七世紀。與與會相對峙。歷代君王即位。行加冕禮於此。中列名人造像。及陵寢。政敎互用。當於此見之矣。</p>
<p>不列顛博物院British　Museum此院爲羅馬式建築。規模宏壯。自石器時代。以迄於今。内容除分列各國珍品外。而尤以吾國之古畫。名磁。玉璽。典籍。不計其數。蓋爲庚子之亂所掠去者。其最痛心者。則陳列各式之鴉片烟槍。林林總總。觸目皆是。英人以介紹毒物入中國。乃不自覺悟。反椰揄而詆毁之。帝國主義者之用心。亦云險矣。</p>
<p>國家美術院凡二。一爲收藏中世紀之繪畫。作家之卓犖者。如拉飛爾勒不郎脱等傑作。其一創自一八九○年。爲戴迪Tate個人將畢生珍藏。捐贈國家。故又稱戴迪美術院。陳列近世紀之繪畫。新作如哥更馬提斯等。亦與焉。倫敦博物院約二十所。美術院占五分之一。規模設備。以較巴黎、殊有遜色。</p>
<p>臘人館Madame　Tussaud's　Exhibitio爲　梭夫人所創設。故以夫人之名名之。自一八○二年。以迄於今。舉凡朝野名流。羅列殆遍。依時代遞邅。而劃分之。吾國中山先生造像。亦陳列其中。御皮領大衣。狀貎若中年時代。惟兩頰過豐。不甚酷肖。大文豪如沙士比亞迭更司斯各德囂俄蕭百訥等。坐立俯仰。栩栩如生。其技之妙。至爲神奇。</p>
<p>其他最惹人注意者。則倫敦失業工人。將近二百萬。衣衫襤褸。蹲躅街頭。比比皆是。經其原野。則荆棘縱横。荒蕪滿目。絶少耕種。糧食原料。悉取諸殖民地。時有不濟之虞也。</p>

<p>半櫻桃如豆小。風雨連宵。花落知多少。花漸闌珊葉漸好。荼　一架游蜂閙。海燕也知春色老。軟語商量。孵箇雛兒抱。隔着簾櫳聲悄悄。雙棲恐惹黃鸝笑。此郁君葆青春暮詞也。余方嘯傲於白雲溪上。綺閣春酣。畫堂春永。但識春光之旖　。詎知春景已闌珊。日前海上鳴社同人。集辛未第三次之觴詠於郁君之光裕堂中。爲之餞春。主觴政者爲哲嗣蘭迂。先期通訊。雖大雨滂沱。而遐邇履臨者。用得二十八人。如姚公勁秋。自京口來。徐公修自青浦。袁夢白自紹興。王袖滄自蕭山。周辨西自杭州。余則來自武進。藉取西泠印社代刋余所繪之勝遊圖詠二集故也。寓公如海寗陳亦陶。會稽顧鼎梅。吉安李仲連。嘉興朱大可。吳琴木。績溪胡寄凡。潮州陳島嵐。崑山陸安欽。吳縣曹叔衡。鄭質庵。黃映禪等均先後蒞止。袖中各出餞春詩詞。佳作紛陳。互相諷咏。吟哦之聲。遂與雨聲相應。余更出示所畫中秋與同人鴛湖泛月圖横卷。欣賞之下。華筵旣張。而朱古微鄭蘇戡。則部署北行不克至。孫玉聲以事阻雨。皆函辭示歉。於是相將入席。飮酒賦詩。幾忘却人間何世也。舉頭適見堂中。懸有胡公壽所書楹聯。句云。春氣遂爲詩人所覺。夜坐能於畫理益深。讀之不啻預爲吾儕即景書贈矣。狂吟擊節。酒闌始起。見庭中刀槍劍戟。武器駢列。悚然詢之。知繭迂固精嫻熟練。習已有年。然不僅一門風雅。而尙武之功。允爲國器。不愧其名日元英也。告别而出。已鐘鳴十下。旅舍聽雨。爰爲之記。（不受酬）</p>
<h3 id="c111">揚州鹽商今昔談（上） <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 石翁</p>
<p>中國鹽法。在前清勝時。未嘗不適用也。積久弊生。日見疲敗。鹽法改良。實爲需要。而新舊爭執紛議莫决。閲四月三十日申報。内載新鹽法延緩施行之理由。一日就場徵税。不假手引商。每年是否確能超過於一萬三千萬之收入。是語最爲扼要。顧吾儕平民。亦不欲多辯矣。惟揚州繁盛。夙以鹽業爲大宗。上月過邗江。一覽風景。蕭瑟異常。因不勝今昔之感。</p>
<p>六代風流。邗江尤勝。自古有腰纒十萬費騎鶴上揚州之詠。固也。自鹽院興起後。凡鹽商家高臺廣榭。恒舞酣歌。銜杯漱醪。青衣箕踞。一輩名士美人。爭相題咏。能诗者嘗有句云。千家養女先敎曲。十畝栽花當種田。其繁華不亦至乎。鹽院以下之官寮。翩翩裙屐。鬥艶爭奇。不可覼縷。即以鹽院頭門外棋杆之大旗一役而論。月得銀數甚夥。其佗可知。今則一片茺邱。變爲牛羊場者久矣。光復後余曾過此。途遇一七十餘之老嫗。曰。此當初鹽院舊址也。噫。</p>
<p>乾隆南巡。備極奢侈。典麗矞皇。華睆切錯。無奇不具。帝隨意曰。小金山畔。風物極佳。惜缺一塔。鹽商聞之。不數日而告一塔。或又隨意曰。某處缺一橋。鹽商聞之。不數日而置一橋。此猶無足異。尤可異者。春郊野望。忽見麥畦中菜花叢裏。排列四大字。其色黃。成方形。字曰萬壽無疆。此蓋未南巡以前。鹽商預授意田家子。示以字形。用菜子依式種成。儼若天生。但求博帝一笑足矣。而所糜不計其數。於是鹽商之名。甲於天下。嘗聞北京父老云。乾隆帝回宮。戲語太子曰。爾曹生帝王家。不若生揚州鹽商家之爲意也。嘻。盛矣哉。今則平山堂下。車馬蕭疏。瘦西湖邊。柳桃薷落。民國七年冬。綠揚村路西。風雪中。遇一舊鹽商之裔孫爲乞丐者。囊無多資。僅與以八百文。心爲之怵。以上種種。未免有情。何以堪此。</p>

<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>時間　二十年三月十九日——四月二十四日</p>
<p>遊程　青島·大連·瀋陽·朝鮮京城·釜山·東京·箱根·碧海·西京·大阪·神戶·長崎</p>
<p>好遊。是我的天性。也許是我的遺傳性。因爲吾父京好遊。四十年前。中國三大流域。早都有吾父的的足跡了。</p>
<p>旅行是最足使人興奮的一件事。但也有幾個條件。（一）要有相當的同伴。（二）對於所到地方先有相當的認識。（三）要有相當的體格和精神。不過我所説興。奮是包含兩個方面的。一是笑。一是哭。　　三月十九日自上海乘大連丸行。海鷗成羣的相送。從早到晚不去。成鷗三章。</p>
<p>碧海兮無垠。白鷗兮成羣。依依兮亭午。往復還兮斜嚑。鷗乎。汝其伴我壯遊兮。送千里以殷勤。吾與汝有同好兮。逝將汗漫乎乾坤。嗟。嗟。佘固知高潔之戾俗兮。可以人而不如君。</p>
<p>雪浪兮滔滔。船之讀兮高高。鷗其來乎。吾且汝招。方翔空其自得兮。又點波以飄飄。忽焉没水不見兮。起魚兒之驚號。鷗乎。汝爲魚之大仇兮。猶弄汝利喙以自豪。吾　汝之求生兮。念汝之腹枵。雖殘羹餘粒之無多兮。猶堪飽汝之老　。鷗乎。鷗乎其爲祥鳳兮。無爲惡鴞。</p>
<p>鷗乎。鷗乎。汝有羣兮。吾亦有偶。此紺衣兮吾婦。彼髭兮。晳且秀兮。壹皆吾友。鷗其有知兮。吾將一一介汝握手。願人與禽兮相親。更禽與魚兮相厚。太和紛綸其一氣兮。至誠格乎萬有。凡含生於天地間。有相携兮無相負。平吾心如水波之不揚兮。其永康而長壽。</p>

<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>霍桑的鎭靜工夫。平日常得到我的讚偑。有時候他的情緒無論怎様變動。他竟能保住着不使在面容上漏露出來。這時候他的目光凝定。雙顴上微泛着些赤色。顯得他心中的忿怒。正也没法遏制。張寳全也似受了暗示一般。握着拳頭。在桌子邊上擊了一下。彷彿代霍桑表示不平。我又問道。「這様看來。這件事一定不是偶然的。你以後又怎麽様呢」霍桑道「當時我便成立了兩種理解。第一種也許有人故意使弄一種惡作劇的玩笑。第二種也許有人要在高家裏弄什麽花巧。却顧忌着我。特地把我調開。我因此趕回高家裏去。悄悄的一問。却並没有發生什麽事故。我又問起你來。據佩賢説。他竟不知道你在什麽時候逃席。於是我着急起來。深恐你不幸遭了暗算。我一時不知道你的行蹤。便先打電話到你家裏去。你還没有回去。我更覺焦心。我又打電話到我自己寓所。施桂才告訴我你在這裏。現在你還算没有多大損失。但那條項圈。却又是一個難題。這項圈在那裏呀。」張寳全聽説。早把桌子上的白巾包打開。取了項圈。雙手交給霍桑。霍桑接過了一瞧。作驚訝聲道。「唉。這東西價值可觀。若照現在市價。足值五六千—」他説到這裏。忽把項圈承在掌中頓了一頓似在估量圈的重量。接着他走到書桌上的電燈面前把項圈凑近燈光。仔細瞧了一瞧。他的始終嚴冷的臉上。忽而透露出一絲微笑。他發一種又似讚美又似譏笑的聲浪説道。「好一條賽珍珠的項圈。代價也足值三十元以上。」我不覺跳起來道。「假的麽」張寳全也漲紅了臉答道。「唉。我的眼光委實太不濟了。」霍桑接嘴道。「你們不用引咎。這東西委實做得很好。你們又在驚惶之餘。我剛才也不是瞧錯的麽。現在們且不要空談。這東西的來由怎様。那人弄這一齣把戲又有什麽目的。我們大家在這上面用些兒腦力罷。」</p>

<p>(1) The National Government's report on suppressing communist bandits. First, National Government Chairman Chiang made a report, stating that the work of suppressing bandits was a crucial key to China's survival and the people's lives. Director He Yingqin of the Xingying (provisional headquarters) was responsible for presiding over it, and he would report to the conference. He stated the contents of the report, and also mentioned the key points of future work: 1. Restore the national spirit; 2. Advance bravely, sacrificing personal opinions and interests to seek the happiness of the majority; 3. Uphold central peace and unification. If the military and civilians of the whole country proceed in accordance with this, it is believed that they can be completely eliminated within three months. After the report, delegates Wang Qi, Xiang Yujie, and Li Zhishan took the stage to speak successively. As a result, the chairman announced that the case would be handed over to the conveners of the review committees of each group, Zhu Peide, Ding Weifen, Wang Shijie, Wu Jingheng, Cai Yuanpei, Niu Yongjian, Kong Xiangxi, Peng Jiqun, and Jin Enqi, nine people in total, and He Yingqin, He Chengjun, He Jian, Liu Luyin, Chen Bulei, Li Zhishan, and He Siyuan, seven committee members, were added to form a special committee to review it, and draft a resolution, convened by He Yingqin.</p>
<p>(2) The draft of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China (Review Report) Wu Jingheng took the stage to report. The case of submitting the draft of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China, which was handed down by the conference, was reviewed in successive meetings on the 9th and 11th of this month. 69 opinion papers from various delegates were also handed down by the conference. After detailed discussion, all acceptable points have been separately classified into corresponding articles. Other opinions either have been prescribed in the original draft, or involve trivial matters that are not suitable to be included in the provisional constitution, or are too idealistic and difficult to implement. For the sake of the dignity of the provisional constitution itself and the effectiveness of its implementation, it seems unnecessary to adopt them all. The revised and added articles (with additional reasons) are incorporated into the original draft and submitted together, respectfully requesting a public decision. After the report, the chairman announced the start of the second reading, and each amendment was submitted for discussion. From Article 1 to Article 46, except for the addition of the words "to give awards and protection" at the end of Article 36, the rest were passed in accordance with the review report.</p>
<p>After a five-minute break, the meeting continued, starting the discussion from Article 47. When it came to Article 52, on education funding, many representatives and central committee members spoke. The chairman submitted Chiang Kai-shek's proposal, "The central and local governments should broadly raise the necessary funds for education, and the funds that are independent according to law should be guaranteed," to a vote, which was immediately passed. Article 56 was amended to "National public and private schools should set up free and scholarship places to reward students with excellent character and learning who cannot afford to go to school." An article was added under Article 83, "All laws that conflict with the provisional constitution are invalid." There were no objections to the review amendments in the remaining articles.</p>
<p>At 12:00, the third reading was opened. The chairman read out the articles. The entire provisional constitution, consisting of eight chapters and eighty-nine articles, was unanimously resolved and passed.</p>
<p>The entire audience stood up and, led by Chairman Dai Chuanxian, cheered "Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! Long live the Republic of China! Long live the National Government! Long live the Three Principles of the People!" The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the report on the bandit suppression work was submitted for review, Chairman Dai Chuanxian announced that if any delegates had any observations and opinions on this case, they could publicly elect one person to join the review committee and contribute everything.

<p>Amendments to the Draft</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 12th, during the fourth meeting, many delegates spoke after the second reading of the provisional constitution began. Chapters 4 and 7 were studied in particular detail. Except for the preamble, which was changed from being decided by the National Conference to being formulated by the National Conference, Articles 1 to 46 were all discussed. Some delegates advocated changing Article 1, "The territory of the Republic of China is the provinces," to "The provinces and cities," Article 8, "Judicial organs," to "Judicial institutions," Article 33, "The state" to "The government," but due to the small number of supporters, the original draft was maintained. Regarding Article 36, a certain delegate proposed changing the last sentence to "The state should give awards and protection to privately-run shipping," which was supported by the majority and passed as amended. Add "protect fisheries" to Article 36, delete "labor-capital cooperation" in Article 39, and add "and promote the spirit of mutual assistance among the people" to Article 43. The results were all to maintain the original draft. Article 51 was amended to "People who have not received compulsory education should be given adult literacy education, the details of which will be determined by law." Regarding Article 52, some advocated amending it to "The central and local governments should broadly raise the necessary funds for education, and its independence should be guaranteed by law," while others advocated maintaining the original draft. Zhang Lisheng advocated still following the original draft, which was refuted by Wu Zhihui standing up, and he proposed a further amendment, "The central and local governments should broadly raise the necessary funds for education, and the funds that are legally independent should be guaranteed." Finally, Chairman Chiang proposed an amendment, "The central and local governments should broadly raise the necessary funds for education, and the funds that are independent according to law should be guaranteed." The chairman submitted Chiang's proposed amendment to a vote, and the majority stood up, and the amendment was passed. Regarding Article 55, Qin Fengxiang advocated deleting the five words "who have been in their positions for a long time," but the number of those who seconded the motion was small, and the original draft was maintained. Regarding Article 56, Wang Zhuoran advocated adding the three words "and scholarship money" under "should set up free places," and some advocated maintaining the original draft. The chairman first submitted the motion to maintain the original draft to a vote, but fewer than two hundred people stood up. The chairman then submitted Qin's proposed amendment to a vote, and two hundred and twenty people stood up, which was still less than the legal number. The chairman then announced a reverse vote, asking those who did not agree with Qin's proposed amendment to stand up, and the result was a small number, so it was passed according to the amendment proposed by Qin. Regarding Article 58, a certain delegate advocated adding the sentence "if they do not harm the public interest" after "historical sites and antiquities," but the number of those who seconded the motion was small, and the original draft was maintained. When discussing Article 67, a certain delegate advocated adding "with the permission of the highest organ of the Chinese Kuomintang" under "National Government," but the number of those who seconded the motion was eight, which was less than the legal number, and the original draft was maintained. Regarding Article 72, Li Tianni advocated changing "elected" to "appointed and dismissed," but the number of those who seconded the motion was small, and the original draft was maintained. Cheng Boren also advocated adding an item after Article 72, which was "The term of office of the chairman and members of the National Government shall be set at two years," but the number of those who seconded the motion was small and it was not established. Regarding Article 74, Ma Yinbing requested that "request according to law" be changed to "request." The chairman submitted it to a vote, and 240 people raised their hands. At this time, there were a total of 491 delegates in the meeting hall, so it was less than half. The chairman then submitted the motion to maintain the original draft to a vote, and 177 people raised their hands. The chairman then announced that all eight members of the current presidium would join in supporting the amendment proposed by Ma, making a total of 248 people including those who raised their hands above, which was a majority, so the amendment proposed by Ma was passed as amended. After reading to Article 83, Liu Zuozhou advocated adding an article as Article 84, the text of which was "All laws and regulations that conflict with this provisional constitution are invalid." The number of those who seconded the motion was large, and the vote was passed. Up to Article 89, the second reading was completely passed, and then the third reading was opened. The chairman read out each article, and when it came to Article 71, Kong Xiangxi requested that the various ministries and commissions be changed to the various yuan, ministries, and commissions, but the result was still in accordance with the original draft. When it came to Article 72, Ye Jialong raised a question, asking how to remedy the situation if the chairman and members of the National Government violated public opinion and acted arbitrarily. After the chairman answered, he continued to read the following articles. When it came to Article 84, Shao Lizi advocated changing "all laws and regulations" to "any laws and regulations." The vote was passed. At this point, the third reading was completed, and the entire provisional constitution was completed. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">India's Silver Dumping <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>According to today's Washington dispatch, the Chinese representative to the silver conference will go to London, hoping to contact the British Prime Minister and at least temporarily stop India's silver dumping before the international silver conference is convened. The excessive supply of silver is indeed one of the reasons for the low silver price. If India can stop dumping, it will undoubtedly be beneficial to planning for stabilizing the silver price. However, it may be very difficult to obtain the Indian government's consent. Congressman Pittman had already advocated this before the Chinese representative, saying that countries around the world might as well consult with the British government under the leadership of the United States to stop its destructive measures of selling Indian silver, and the silver price would undoubtedly recover. However, Britain has not yet agreed to this move. Looking at Earl Castle Stewart, a member of the British Conservative Party, who suggested to Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden in the House of Commons a month ago to contact the governments concerned to restrict the sale of silver, Snowden's answer was that he did not admit that the sale of waste coins and raw silver was one of the reasons for the fall in the silver price, and expressed his unwillingness to propose to contact and restrict the sale of silver. What he said was directly opposed to Pittman's claim. From this, it can be seen that although the Chinese representative has the enthusiasm to go to Britain for consultation, the result that he will hardly be satisfied can be predicted. According to foreign telegrams, various countries are unwilling to be among the initiators of the silver conference. Britain feels difficult because of India, and the United States is also hesitant because of war debts. Although Japan has not yet expressed its position, it is probably unwilling to be the initiator of this conference. From this, it can be seen that not only is the consultation on India's silver dumping not promising, but also the convening of the silver conference has lost its courage. Countries that use gold inevitably have the intention of maintaining their own interests. And the entanglement of the silver issue involves many relationships. Once there is a conflict of interest, the conference will be obstructed. Planning to stabilize the silver price is indeed not easy to say.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Wang Shijie Discusses Four Characteristics of the Provisional Constitution <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Hubei National Congress Representative Wang Shijie said that the provisional constitution passed this time has four characteristics compared with the constitutions of other countries: (1) This provisional constitution is a fundamental law with a time limit, which only applies to the period of political tutelage. It is clearly different from the constitutions of other countries, which only stipulate the period of amendment but stipulate the applicable period; (2) This provisional constitution is detailed in the work of the government and brief in the organization of the government, aiming to determine the scope of the government's work and make the organization of the government adapt to the progress of politics; (3) The provisions on the rights and obligations of the people mostly only declare principles and do not define the scope themselves. On the one hand, because the rights and obligations stipulated in the provisional constitution are new in our country, they are different from the constitutions of the United States and other countries, which recognize existing customs. On the other hand, because special rights and obligations cannot be appropriately regulated without resorting to the law during the period of political tutelage; (4) This provisional constitution itself is not a self-sufficient object and often needs to be interpreted with the help of Premier Sun's teachings. Therefore, Premier Sun's teachings have also become legalized. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Dr. Soejima Giichi, advisor to the National Government who participated in drafting the provisional constitution, said to a reporter from the Dentsu news agency who visited him today, "This provisional constitution is the most stable from the current state of the National Government's organization. The chapters on the rights and obligations of the people and others are more detailed than those stipulated in the constitutions of various countries. For today's China, it can be said to be an ideal provisional constitution. All the national representatives discussed it enthusiastically and passed it in its entirety, which makes me very happy."

<h3 id="e11">He Yingqin's Explanation of the Bandit Suppression Report <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin, in the National Assembly, explained the National Government's report on suppressing the Red Bandits as follows: Chairman, fellow representatives, the report on the National Government's suppression of the Red Bandits has already been distributed to everyone in printed form. I am here under the Chairman's order to explain it briefly. You can read the details yourselves. Now I will only point out a few important aspects so that everyone can have a deeper understanding of the suppression of the Red Bandits. Why are the Red Bandits so rampant now? This is a point that deserves our first attention. A slight analysis reveals five very important reasons. First, it is naturally due to the mutinies of warlords over the years, with scattered and defeated soldiers forming gangs. There were many lost firearms, so they relied on the terrain to act lawlessly. Second, it is due to the poisonous schemes of the Red Imperialists. Because they want to secretly annex China to supply their raw materials and sell their products, they use various methods to support their running dogs as spies. At the same time, they also want to use the power of their running dogs to threaten Europe and America, so they do not hesitate to sacrifice China. We know that there were many bandits in our history, but what is different from now is that the current Red Bandits have an international background, economic support, and organized command and training, so they are even more rampant. Third, it is due to the economic aggression of White Imperialists, which has led to the bankruptcy of rural areas and increased unemployment and suffering in rural areas. Therefore, some people, forced by life, could not become soldiers and went to join the bandits. Fourth, it is due to the defects of the past education system. The best students in schools only paid attention to the training of knowledge and lacked the cultivation of virtue. Therefore, most young people only have a temporary intense impulse and rarely have perseverance and lasting integrity. Therefore, on the reverse side of the impulse, they even tend to degenerate and become depressed. The Red Bandits take advantage of this psychological weakness and use pure young people as their tools. Furthermore, education lacks vocational training, and the legacy of the literati mentality remains. Besides seeking a livelihood from politics, there are not many other ways. Therefore, the Red Bandits were able to lure them with the desire to be leaders and feed them with a small amount of profit. Fifth, it is due to the laxity of Chinese social organization. Because China has suffered from thousands of years of autocratic poison and has been slaughtered by warlords, society has simply lost its ability to act automatically. Even the desire and courage to defend oneself are not easily realized. Therefore, the bandits and outlaws of the past always drove the good and innocent people with cunning and rogue vagrants. They were robbed and coerced by the bandits and also driven by the bandits, and most of those who sacrificed were them. This is also one of the reasons why the Red Bandits can be so rampant. Because of these reasons, the poison of the Red Bandits has rotted like a festering sore. In Jiangxi, nearly 186,000 people were brutally killed by the bandits, nearly 2.1 million refugees were displaced, more than 100,000 houses were burned, and the loss of property was even more terrible, amounting to 650 million yuan. The loss of grain was more than 39 million dan. In Hunan, 72,000 people were brutally harmed by the bandits, more than 120,000 houses were burned, and the loss of property was nearly 300 million yuan. The losses in Hubei have not yet been thoroughly investigated. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the National Government's report on suppressing the Red Bandits is as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>The greatest disaster facing China today is the Red Bandits. The most urgent task for the National Government and the people of the whole country is to eliminate the Red Bandits. The disaster of the Red Bandits, which has already manifested itself in Jiangxi, Hunan, and other places, is being eliminated by the government and the local people working together. However, their lurking in other places, hoping to make each province a continuation of Jiangxi and Hunan, has also gradually revealed its signs, and it is not something we can ignore. Considering the various facts of the people being harmed by the bandits in various places, the existence and spread of the Red Bandits are not only incompatible with the survival and development of the Chinese nation, but also with the lives and livelihoods of all individuals in the country. Therefore, the work of suppressing the Red Bandits is something that the government should always do its best to achieve. In fact, it is necessary for the people of the whole country to understand the poison and evil of the Red Bandits and to know that the Red Bandits are incompatible with the survival of the nation, the lives of the masses, and the livelihoods of the people. Everyone should rise up and take responsibility for eliminating and eradicating the Red Bandits. Only then can the greatest disaster in China's future be thoroughly eliminated in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(II) The Poison of the Red Bandits</p>
<p>In recent years, the provinces that have suffered the most severe and tragic poisoning by the Red Bandits are Jiangxi and Hunan, followed by Hubei. Now, let us try to consider the tangible losses in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. The statistics are already alarming. In Jiangxi, about 186,000 people were brutally killed by the bandits, about 2.1 million refugees were displaced, about 100,000 houses in various counties were burned by the bandits, the loss of property was about 650 million yuan, and the loss of grain was about 39 million dan. Although the banditry in Hunan is not as widespread as in Jiangxi, the losses are</p>

<p>In twenty-five counties such as Shui, bandits appear in thirty-one counties such as Shangrao, Guangfeng, and Yushan, where bandits have not yet spread throughout the entire territory. The people in these areas who have survived the turmoil will have no way to make a living. Furthermore, in Hubei Province, counties such as Mianyang, Qianjiang, Jianli, Shishou, and Gongan are close to the Honghu bandit nest and have suffered the most severely. Macheng, Luotian, Huanggang, Huang'an, Huangmei, Xiaogan, Tongcheng, Chongyang, Daye, and Echeng have all suffered from the ravages of the Red Bandits. We can imagine that if the banditry in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei were to gradually spread to other provinces, then the annual loss of the national population would be more than five million people, and the loss of property would be more than 800 million yuan. Is this not the most shocking thing to hear?</p>
<p>The reason why the Red Bandits take it upon themselves to destroy the life of the new China is that they are instigated by Red Imperialism. In 1927, their party wings spread to provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, creating internal chaos in China. For five years, they have been burning, killing, raping, and robbing. Their crimes are obvious and countless. The most moving and soul-stirring catastrophes include the Nanchang Incident in August 1927, the Guangzhou Incident in November of the same year, the Changsha Rebellion in July 1930, and the Ji'an Rebellion in October of the same year. Other counties, such as Haifeng and Lufeng in Guangdong, Longyan and Yongding in Fujian, Shangrao, Yongxin, Tonggu, and Yiyang in Jiangxi, Pingjiang, Liuyang, and Huarong in Hunan, Mianyang and Huang'an in Hubei, and Shangcheng in Henan, have all been occupied by the Red Bandits to organize pseudo-Soviet governments, pseudo-Red Army command headquarters, and pseudo-military committees. The Anti-Rebellion Committee's killing of innocent people and the Finance Committee's kidnapping and extortion are particularly heartbreaking for the people in various places. In all areas ravaged by the Red Bandits, boys and girls between the ages of eight and sixteen are organized into children's corps, those between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three are organized into Young Pioneers, and those between the ages of twenty-three and forty are organized into Red Guards. They promote violence from one village to another, so that nine out of ten families are empty. According to statistics, the area in the country that has been affected by banditry covers more than 300 counties. If this continues and the people of the whole country do not rise up and unite to take the elimination of the Red Bandits as their own responsibility, then the future life of the new China will inevitably be cut off in the middle, as Red Imperialism wishes.</p>
<p>(III) Crimes of the Red Bandits</p>
<p>Moreover, the Red Bandits' ambition is not only to cause material and tangible losses to the people of our country. The conspiracy they have been deliberately accumulating is to, under the wings of Red Imperialism, directly use young men, women, farmers, and workers to destroy the social and economic foundations of our country, and indirectly destroy the lives of young men, women, farmers, and workers themselves. The social foundation of our country is the family, and the new life of the family is young men and women. If the bandits use the weakness of young people's curiosity to incite young men and women to commit various rebellious and destructive acts against the family, then the family, the only foundation of society, will be destroyed. On the other hand, they take advantage of the weakness of young people's unstable blood and energy to induce ordinary men and women to indulge in free licentiousness, then the new life of the family will be plundered. If this disaster of destroying the social foundation is not eliminated, then the Chinese nation will not stop until it is exterminated. At the same time, the Red Bandits deliberately put forward excessive demands that do not conform to the state of production for the workers in order to lure them with slogans such as increasing wages, reducing working hours, and improving treatment. They encourage them to engage in daily struggles that exceed the scope of their duties without interruption, and they hope to form strikes and riots. For the peasants, they use slogans such as resisting donations, resisting taxes, and confiscating land to lure them to engage in cruel struggles such as killing and arson without interruption. They hope to expand the scattered disturbances in various places. As a result of these two types of struggles, the foundations of urban economy and rural economy will inevitably be completely destroyed. Even if the farmers and workers who are being used temporarily seize some land or get some wage increases, they will ultimately be unable to apply their labor due to the exhaustion of capital and the closure of factories. The tragedy of displacement and death will be even worse than before. If this disaster of destroying the economic foundation is not eliminated, then the livelihoods of the people of the whole country will be completely cut off, and those who suffer the most severely will still be the poor peasants and workers themselves. (IV) Circumstances of Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>The central government is deeply aware of the source of the Red Bandit disaster and the causes of the people's suffering. Therefore, since the purge of the party in April 1927 and the unification of the country in 1928, it has been vigorously promoting the ideas of the Three People's Principles on the one hand to break the dreams of young men, women, farmers, and workers, and it has been mobilizing the national army to devise ways to suppress the bandits on the other hand, gradually achieving results and making it not difficult to cut off their roots. Unfortunately, the warlords Zhang, Tang, Yan, and Feng successively betrayed. In order to suppress the reaction and realize unification, the central government transferred most of the national army units to the front, thus giving the Red Bandits an excellent opportunity, and the bandit forces in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces gradually became rampant again. This is what the central government is extremely heartbroken about, and it is why the reactionary warlords are guilty and unforgivable. Because the masses of the people are suffering from difficult living conditions and have weak knowledge, they are often coerced by the Red Bandits into joining their ranks. Moreover, local bandits and hooligans, due to their shared depravity, are absorbed by them one after another. Therefore, Zhu De and Mao Zedong have 20,000 to 30,000 guns in southern Jiangxi. In addition, there are more than 20 other bandit groups with more than 1,000 or several hundred guns each. They are scattered in various places, supporting each other, and their momentum is becoming increasingly arrogant. In 1930, the central government, on the one hand, mobilized a large army to attack Yan and Feng, and on the other hand, it retained troops to consolidate the rear. However, because the rear forces were relatively weak, the results were not satisfactory. Since the Yan Rebellion has been quelled, the central government has decided to devote all its forces to suppressing the Red Bandits and has sent special officials to Jiangxi to supervise the army. Currently, more than 200,000 national army soldiers have entered Jiangxi. The military strength is strong, and the momentum is like a landslide. The disaster areas of the bandits, such as Ji'an, Yongfeng, Wan'an, Chongren, Le'an, Xingguo, Xin'gan, Guangchang, Xiushui, Tonggu, and other counties, have been recovered one after another. The Red Bandits in Jiangxi are in a state of exhaustion and despair. The bandit chiefs of various units are panicking. Therefore, they want to concentrate the various units in southern Hunan and western Hubei in western Hubei, and all the units in Jiangxi Province in southern Jiangxi, to make a final struggle. On the one hand, they plan to use the guerrilla tactics of avoiding the real and attacking the weak, and fleeing to the east to survive. On the other hand, they want to incite the vagrants in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Anhui to riot, in order to create a false show of strength. The Red Bandits have already realized that the encirclement of the national army has been completed, and the day of their collapse is approaching.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the national army suppressing the bandits, it is clear that the Red Bandits are originally a motley crowd, not enough to withstand a single blow from a disciplined army. However, the bandits are good at turning around and avoiding, and their appearances are irregular. Some rely on natural dangers to resist each other, and others disguise themselves as farmers to disturb our vision. In addition, the bandit areas are vast and the mountains are deep. It is absolutely impossible to apply the strategy of a regular war to the scattered Red Bandits. Therefore, it has been decided to make proper arrangements, conduct a thorough search, and then the bandits will have nowhere to go, and they can be annihilated. After the bandit area is recovered, how to restore order, how to appease the refugees, and how to enable the people to live and work in peace so that they will not be taken advantage of by the Red Bandits again, then the government needs the cooperation of the people of the whole country. (V) Source of the Red Bandits</p>

<p>From the perspective of the national army suppressing the bandits, it is clear that the Red Bandits are originally a motley crowd, not enough to withstand a single blow from a disciplined army. However, the bandits are good at turning around and avoiding, and their appearances are irregular. Some rely on natural dangers to resist each other, and others disguise themselves as farmers to disturb our vision. In addition, the bandit areas are vast and the mountains are deep.

After the bandit area is recovered, how to restore order, how to appease the refugees, and how to enable the people to live and work in peace so that they will not be taken advantage of by the Red Bandits again, then the government needs the cooperation of the people of the whole country. (V) Source of the Red Bandits</p>
<p>The reason why bandit suppression relies on the cooperation of the people of the whole country is that the commanders of the Red Bandits are directly the Chinese Communist Party and indirectly the Red Imperialists. They have a definite overall conspiracy, which is not to be equated with local bandits. The consistent conspiracy of the Third International towards China is to confuse the people of our country with communism, to cause peasants and workers to riot from time to time, and even to cause people in various professions to fight each other, in order to create a universal phenomenon of displacement and unemployment among the people of the whole country. Furthermore, from the universal phenomenon of displacement and unemployment among the Chinese people, they hope to cause economic panic and the collapse of industry and commerce in European and American countries. At that time, all the people in the world will be in a state of unemployment, and the Red Imperialists will be able to realize their ideal of world revolution. Therefore, no matter what the theory of communism that the Red Imperialists advocate, it is clear that they must first sacrifice the Chinese nation to provide resources for the European and American countries to vent their anger. Because the Red Imperialists have this kind of conspiracy, they support their so-called Communist Party members to implement various plans in China, such as colluding with warlords, fueling internal strife, inciting vagrants, anesthetizing young people, dividing the people, encouraging bandits, spreading rumors, and undermining local areas. Moreover, due to the past division of China by warlords, the exhaustion of the people's livelihood, the immaturity of knowledge, and the failure to complete the great cause of unification and peace at an early date, the various conspiracies and plans of the Red Imperialists were able to take advantage of the situation and secretly plant a part of their evil roots in society through the Chinese Communist Party members as tools, resulting in the disaster of the Red Bandits today. As evidenced by the information obtained by the government, the Chinese Communist Party, under the wings of the Red Imperialists, has set up a political bureau in the pseudo-central government, which is responsible for commanding the Red Bandits in various places and organizing Soviets in various places. Below it, there are the Yangtze River Bureau, the Southern Bureau, the Northern Bureau, the Manchurian Bureau, and the Jiangnan Provincial Committee (see attached table). Although what they currently consider most important is the Yangtze River Bureau and the Jiangnan Provincial Committee, hoping to seize the large cities of Shanghai and Wuhan as the center of their activities, it is difficult to guarantee that after repeated failures, they will not shift their attention to the south, north, and outside the customs, using their latent elements to make desperate moves, and the poison of the Red Bandits will spread throughout the country. From this, it can be seen that the Red Bandits today are actually a mixed body of Red Imperialists, outdated military personnel in our country, idle politicians, and local bullies, hooligans, and bandits. Their poison is enough to endanger the survival of the Chinese nation, harm the lives of the Chinese masses, and cut off the livelihoods of the Chinese people. It is not just the bandit areas that have been harmed that have suffered their poison.</p>
<p>Moreover, after the Red Imperialists invaded the Middle East Railway, the plan for China decided on July 15 last year not only used the weaknesses of the majority of poor and weak people in China and the long-term civil war to collude with vagrants and bandits in society as much as possible, to destroy rural order, to buy shameless literary beggars in literature and art, to promote so-called proletarian literature, and to promote communist banditry in politics, wanting to make China a country where people are unemployed, internal strife is endless, and trade between Asia and Europe and the United States is cut off, but also has active preparations in the military, in order to annex China and dominate it. The so-called active military plans are (1) to freely transport all kinds of personnel, weapons, and communist propaganda through the route from Soviet territory in Outer Mongolia, via Ulaanbaatar and Kalgan, to northern China; (2) to train the Mongolian army with Red Imperialist instructors and to replenish its latest combat equipment such as tanks and aircraft; (3) to secretly organize military forces among the Communist Party members of the Middle East Railway to prepare for the immediate disturbance of the northeastern provinces once a war breaks out; (4) to deploy two army corps of heavy troops in the Eastern Siberian Baikal Province, Heilongjiang, and Primorsky Krai to show intimidation and prepare for future operations. From this, it can be seen that the Red Imperialists' scheme to invade us is to use their strategy of internal response and external cooperation, and they must make the whole of China a colony of the Red Imperialists before they are finished. The Red Bandits in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces are actually acting as tigers for them to annex China in the guise of ancient-style bandits.</p>
<p>(VI) Conclusion</p>
<p>The complex causes of the Red Bandits are such, and the spread of the Red Bandit poison is such. Therefore, whether the Red Bandits can be eliminated is related to the life and death of the Chinese people and the survival of the nation from now on. It is by no means a minor matter involving only a part of the people or a political group. Since the government has made the determination to suppress the Red Bandits, it must consistently seek to implement it from beginning to end. However, how should the people of the whole country pool their wisdom and efforts to assist the government, eliminate all obstacles, and complete this task of stabilizing society and consolidating unification and peace? We must look forward to the National Assembly to give a clear and detailed direction.</p>

<p>To be Submitted to the Assembly for Discussion Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Declaration on Abolishing Treaties will be submitted to the Assembly for discussion tomorrow. It is said that the wording is extremely cautious. The opinion of the drafting committee is that the National Assembly is not comparable to an ordinary free gathering. The words published should not only seek to be decisive and resolute. It should be fair and resolute in order to have strength. It should generally describe in detail the unequal treaties that violate international justice, the unreasonable shackles imposed on China, which endanger the survival and development of the nation, and that it is absolutely impossible to allow them to continue to exist. Based on the principle of changing circumstances, it should decisively</p>

The presidium has decided to include it in the agenda of the fifth general meeting on the 13th as the first item for discussion. The wording of the full text is extremely cautious and the language is quite reserved. It can be passed and published without much modification. (Special telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The content of the Declaration on Abolishing Treaties first states that unequal treaties violate international justice, then describes the pain of the Chinese state and people being bound by unequal treaties, and finally states the reasons why unequal treaties cannot but be abolished. It requests the government to announce the abolition within a time limit immediately. (Special telegram on the 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Industrial Construction Program <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Review Situation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic and Financial Review Committee held its second joint meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon in the gymnasium of the Central University to review the government's proposal on the industrial construction program. Chairman Kong Xiangxi first discussed the original text of the proposal, and there was no objection from the audience. It was passed. Next, the committee reviewed the amendments of the representatives. The results were as follows: (1) Zhang Zhengxian proposed adding the Shashi-Xingyi line or the Guangzhou-Chongqing line and the Guangzhou-Dali-Tengyue line in the southwest railway system to the second item. (2) Hu Shuhua proposed (A) adding the Hankou-Chongqing section of the Sichuan-Han Railway to the Yuancheng Railway item and completing it by the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China, and (B) revising the original text of the sixth item to "The country must increase to more than 50,000 miles of aviation lines and 800 commercial aircraft by the 24th year of the Republic of China, and there must be two aircraft manufacturing plants, which the National Government will actively prepare and encourage." (B) Revise the original text of the eighth item to "Basic industries such as water conservancy, electricity, alkali, coal, sugar, kerosene, and gasoline should be actively handled by the National Government, and steel rails are essential materials for repairing railways, building ships, and manufacturing various agricultural and industrial machines.

<h3 id="e19">Proposal to Recover Outer Mongolia <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The proposal by Pan Xiuren et al. on recovering Outer Mongolia and Khulun as soon as possible to maintain the nation and strengthen the border: Outer Mongolia has a vast territory and abundant resources and has always been part of our country's territory. Since the Russian White Party Semyonov fled into Mongolia in the ninth year of the Republic of China, the Red Russians entered Khulun in the name of expelling Semyonov. Under the pretext of helping weak nations, they actually invaded Outer Mongolia. In fact, it is no longer ours. The Mongolians are ignorant and deceived by them, falsely claiming autonomy and sparing no effort to offer the great rivers and mountains to the Russians. All political power is held by the Russians. Although they are nominally independent, they are actually destroyed. The economic invasion they implement is even more vicious. There is a huge state-owned trade company, one is the Stermenka Company, which is completely operated by the Red Russians, and the other is the Xiehe Company, which is organized by Mongolian people with shares, but it is actually controlled by the Red Russians. Mongolia's business organization has always used a barter system, which has been handed down from generation to generation and is quite suitable. Since being Redized, the Soviet Union has prepared a ten-year plan for Mongolia, establishing leather factories, soap factories, chemical factories, and other factories, transporting the main products of Mongolia, fur, entirely to Russia, and not allowing them to be transported to China. They are especially able to oppress Chinese merchants trading in Mongolia. In the early years of the Republic of China, there were 200,000 to 300,000 Chinese merchants in Mongolia, but now there are only 2,000 to 3,000. What is even worse is that their cultural aggression policy against Outer Mongolia is even more pressing. They spare no effort in establishing schools and promoting Redization. Most of the Mongolian youth are forced to receive communist education and undergo strict military training. All Mongolian tribes have always believed in the Panchen Lama. Because the Red Russians found that the Panchen Lama was loyal to our country, they forced the Mongolians to shout the slogan "Down with the Panchen Lama." Cultural aggression is enough to destroy the country and the race. Korea and Taiwan are lessons from the past. Moreover, in recent years, the Red Russians have forced the Mongolians to sign secret railway agreements. The railway layout contract for seven lines has also been established, one from Ulan-Ude to Chita, one from Khulun to Uliastai, then from Uliastai to Biysk, and then from Uliastai to Kobdo, and then from Kobdo to Semipalatinsk, and to Urumqi, and from Urumqi to Olulu in Turkestan. The plan is meticulous, and their premeditation can be seen. The undercurrent of the Red disaster in the country is already a hidden worry, and Mongolia is actually existing in name only. It is a great sigh. According to our Republic of China, the five races are united, how can we let the Mongolians be trampled on like this for a long time? Now the Russian aggression policy is actually gaining an inch. In a few years, the northern border will no longer be ours. If Xinjiang, Yichang, and Suiyuan are lost, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Hebei will be shaken, and national defense will become more dangerous. Looking forward, I can't help but worry. Therefore, preventing the Soviet Union from Redizing Outer Mongolia and Khulun is the top priority for saving the country and the nation today. Moreover, now the general public in Outer Mongolia, because they cannot bear the abuse and oppression of the Red Russians, are extremely eager for our country to recover it as soon as possible so that they can get rid of their suffering. This time, Special Envoy Mo Dehui went to Russia to negotiate only on the Chinese Eastern Railway and trade and diplomatic relations. I have not heard of any consideration of this important issue. The representatives are in the border area and feel deeply oppressed. They believe that if Outer Mongolia is not recovered quickly, the foundation of Soviet aggression will become increasingly consolidated, and it will be difficult to recover it in the future. This time's trade and diplomatic relations are equal to a futile effort. The tragedy of subjugation is imminent, and a moment's hesitation will be lost. The survival of the country is at stake, how can we sit idly by and make mistakes? Therefore, I hereby request the General Assembly to resolve to ask the National Government to find a way to recover Outer Mongolia as soon as possible to maintain the nation and strengthen the border. Is it appropriate? Please decide publicly. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Proposal to Reduce Grain Tax <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xiang Dingrong et al. proposed, I think that our country has valued agriculture since ancient times, but in recent years, the suffering of farmers has been twice as much as that of industry and commerce. Natural disasters such as floods and droughts are not to be mentioned. One is trapped by the high prices of everything, and daily use cannot be without needs. The other is trapped by the doubling of wages, and cultivation cannot be without assistance. The most painful thing is the sharp increase in land taxes and the unlimited surcharges. The urgent pursuit of taxes has been enough to discourage them and hasten their livelihood. The heavy land tax in the country is no more than Jiahu in Zhejiang and Susong in Jiangsu. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, autocratic monarchs heavily taxed our people out of spite and private resentment, charging several counties in the southeast with the grain tax that was unique in the country. In hundreds of years, although there have been successive reductions in taxes, the unfair tax has never been removed by revolution. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the temporary provincial assembly of Jiangsu and Zhejiang once discussed exempting the grain tax. Later, because the province's expenses were insufficient, it was changed to a discounted levy. At first, the discounted price of each stone of grain tax was three yuan, which still meant to exempt it from the levy. Recently, the price per stone has increased to seven or eight yuan, which has exceeded the selling price of new grains on the market, and the attached expenses for construction, education, etc., disaster relief, pest control, and land consolidation are increasing day by day. As a result, the total silver tax per mu of land is actually levied to one yuan and several corners, or even two yuan, which is heavier than the burden borne by farmers at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Coupled with years of famine and the decline of people's power, selling children and mortgaging wives to pay off this unfair burden is common. The purpose of the revolution is to help farmers and workers. Now, they do not benefit from it, but suffer from it first, which is very contrary to the wishes of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. The National Government should order the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to find out the amount of grain tax in each county with grain tax, the amount of discounted silver, and hurry to find a way to offset it. Before a way to offset it is found, the discounted price of three yuan per stone should be temporarily levied as in the first year of the Republic of China, and the additional taxes should not exceed 20% of the extra levy, in order to slightly relieve the people's power. When the offset is determined, the discounted grain tax in each county should be exempted immediately, so that the poison of autocratic monarchs will no longer exist under the revolutionary government. Some may suspect that if the grain tax is reduced and surcharges are limited, the provincial government's expenses will be insufficient. I don't know that taxation is based on the principle of fairness. If the tax is light, people will be happy to pay it. If the tax is heavy, they will accumulate arrears. In the northern provinces, the land tax is generally no more than ten copper coins. Every year, the collection is often fully paid. In the counties with grain tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, in the Qing Dynasty, only 80% was collected. Now, it is becoming heavier and heavier, and the arrears are becoming more and more. Why? The farmers' wealth is only this amount. Increasing the nominal amount will not help the actual situation. If the grain tax and surcharges are reduced separately, the number of arrears will be less and the number of payers will be more. The provincial government's expenses will definitely not be reduced because of this. Some also say that the government's recent policy of land tax collection will be based on land prices. This fair method can be used once and for all, and there is no need to discuss other methods. I don't know that land prices in the mainland are falling sharply. If the tax amount is determined and collected according to the current price, it will be really short. Moreover, the economic conditions and population of various places are different. Land in rich villages has high prices, and land in poor villages has low prices. It is difficult to find a standard, and the handling is tricky. It is better to gradually remove the most unfair of the current taxes. There is actual benefit to helping farmers, not empty words and decorations, which is easier to start. This is the general idea of reducing grain tax and limiting surcharges to help farmers. Is it feasible? It should be decided publicly.</p>

Before it is taken back, a salt administration reform committee should be sent to directly supervise it, so that the habitual power of the old salt merchants will be lost, and at the same time, the monopoly of refined salt merchants can be avoided, which is in line with the original intention of the reform.

<p>The Provincial Government Tries to Mediate</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Ruoyu took office as Superintendent of the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tianjin today. After taking office, he will seek a solution to the recent disputes in Kailuan. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After all Kailuan miners went on strike on the 11th, the Hebei Provincial Rectification Committee sent Su Baicheng to investigate. Su set off on the 13th. This strike was completely instigated by the Mine Bureau. Because the Mine Road issue has not been resolved, the Mine Bureau wants to use the strike to resolve the Mine Road dispute. The reason is very complicated and it may be difficult to resolve it for a while. The workers plan to mine coal themselves to maintain their livelihood. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of the dispute between Kailuan Mine and the Beining Road, the Road Bureau claims that the Mine should pay 1.38 million yuan for the delayed settlement fee and 800,000 yuan for the coal weight handling fee. The Mine only agrees to pay 500,000 yuan for the settlement. The Road Bureau believes that it is suffering too much and must calculate according to the case. Recently, Kailuan is imposing itself. It has sent people to mediate, hoping to increase the delayed fee by a few yuan, but does not agree to pay 0.3 yuan per ton for the handling fee. The Road Bureau still insists on its original proposal because there is a precedent on the Jinpu Road. The case has not made any progress, and the Kailuan strike is also fundamentally unresolved because of this. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Mine General Trade Union issued a declaration on the 11th because the Bureau did not respond to the request to cancel the two-day weekly shutdown.

<p>Reuters, Madrid, 12th: This morning the situation here is normal, but soldiers are still stationed at various key points. The police have arrested 26 people and recovered the weapons stolen yesterday. Prime Minister Zamora issued a statement, admitting to a setback, but said that the government would not allow a repeat of yesterday's events. Freedom of belief would be respected, but all religious sites would be protected. He also urged the public to work as usual. The directors of the Socialist Party and the General Confederation of Labor have issued notices denouncing the excesses and urging workers to resume work immediately.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 12th: Entertainment venues and cafes are now operating as usual. Foreign Minister Lerroux set off for Geneva yesterday morning to attend the League of Nations administrative meeting. He turned back halfway upon hearing the news of the riots and has now set off again. It is reported that the provinces are still quiet.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 11th: Official sources say that a total of ten monasteries and churches have been destroyed. The Minister of the Interior stated today that the government is determined to eradicate this lawless behavior. Troops stationed outside Madrid have been transferred back to the city. The Catholic newspaper "Debate" has been ordered to cease publication by the government. The government has ordered officials throughout the country to actively prevent the spread of unrest. It is reported that former Prime Minister Berenguer has been arrested again after the declaration of martial law and is being held in a military prison. Tonight, the situation in Madrid suddenly changed, and the calls for destruction abruptly ceased. Shops have reopened, and the city has returned to normal, except for soldiers patrolling the streets. Catholics had prepared for today's disturbances and are said to have sent their documents and valuables to Rome and other places months ago. When the unrest first broke out, women emerged from monasteries disguised as country women, who were actually nuns. They had prepared simple and suitable secular women's clothing in advance, so they were able to change clothes and escape before the monasteries were burned. Although at least five monasteries have been burned down, no one was hurt. The cabinet has been meeting all day, and the Minister of the Interior stated in the evening that these riots were merely a suicidal act by the restoration party and the Communist Party, and the government is determined to stop them. Reuters, Cordoba, 11th: This morning, crowds here threw stones at several churches and monasteries, and a Catholic newspaper office was also attacked. Demonstrators shouted "Death to Archbishop Segura and Dr. Apina!" A Catholic school was also pelted with bricks, but although the school gate was open, the crowd did not enter. Order was later restored. Local streetcar drivers have gone on strike, following the example of the Madrid streetcar drivers.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 11th: The French presidential election is scheduled to be held on Wednesday. The new president will be inaugurated on June 13th for a term of seven years. As usual, there is no vice president. National News Agency, Paris, 11th: This evening, Foreign Minister Briand met with representatives of left-wing groups from the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies and announced that he had accepted the nomination for the election. He said that if he were to be elected president, he would go to Geneva on May 15th for a few days, but would not participate in the Pan-European Conference or be involved in preparing for the conference. His sole purpose is to bid farewell to the diplomatic representatives of various countries. Briand is the most experienced and qualified person on the French political stage. His entry into the presidential election is by no means a rash attempt. He must have a well-thought-out plan and a predetermined victory. Therefore, only Briand and Senate President Doumer are the most likely candidates for the presidential election.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 11th: Briand has agreed to be a presidential candidate. Senate President Doumer is also a presidential candidate. He expressed his opinion today, saying that Briand is more useful to the country as Foreign Minister than as President. For this reason, he is unwilling to concede, but hopes that the electors will choose for themselves. Senator Hennessy has also agreed to be a presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 11th: British Foreign Secretary Henderson said in the House of Commons today in response to a member's question that, according to a report from the British Minister to China, Sir Lampson, the Chinese government issued an order on May 4th to abolish the consular jurisdiction enjoyed by foreigners, effective January 1st of next year. However, this order has not been officially delivered to the British Minister, so he has not received the original text. Negotiations are still ongoing. Documents regarding this matter are not yet convenient to be published in the House of Commons. Former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain said that since China has issued this order, the situation has changed, so the diplomatic authorities can report the negotiation process to the House of Commons. Henderson replied that he did not think it appropriate. He had previously stated that if the treaty is agreed upon, the House of Commons may have a detailed debate during the ratification. Conservative Party member Wood said that this important order is very important to many people in other countries. Why was it published in the newspaper instead of being delivered to the diplomatic authorities of various countries? He asked the Foreign Secretary to investigate. Henderson replied that he was not in a position to interfere with the way other governments publish news.</p>

<p>Undersecretary of State for the Colonies Defends Hong Kong Government</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: Sir John Simon, a key figure in the Liberal Party, strongly criticized Hong Kong's Mui-Tsai system in the House of Commons today, while Undersecretary of State for the Colonies, Shiels, vigorously defended the Hong Kong government. At the beginning of his speech, Sir John Simon took out a Chinese-style sales contract for the sale of a nine-year-old girl for 110 Hong Kong dollars. Sir John Simon said that this is no longer a national issue, because there is an international movement against slavery, and Britain is its leader. Shiels replied that, as a general rule, the treatment of Mui-Tsai is currently not bad. Chinese public opinion expects those who keep Mui-Tsai to let the Mui-Tsai marry when they are eighteen years old, or to provide them with appropriate preparation. If any money is paid, it is strictly prohibited by the Hong Kong Domestic Servants Ordinance of 1923. The Hong Kong Mui-Tsai system is different from slavery. The number of Mui-Tsai has decreased by 50% in the past eight years, so the number of registrations has decreased significantly compared to before. It will definitely continue to decrease and eventually be eliminated. This is the intention of the Governor of Hong Kong in consultation with the Colonial Secretary. There is a police inspector who specializes in investigating Mui-Tsai. The Governor of Hong Kong and Chinese charitable organizations have taken measures to protect the happiness of Mui-Tsai, and the Hong Kong government has adopted various reasonable steps to implement the government's policy on this matter. Before taking office, the Colonial Secretary had informed the new Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Peel, of the importance of thoroughly implementing the Mui-Tsai Management Ordinance. Members of various parties in the House of Commons expressed disapproval of the Hong Kong Mui-Tsai system. Therefore, when concluding this debate, Shiels earnestly stated that the Colonial Department will eliminate this system in every possible way.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: Chiba has been exposed to the sun and rain since climbing the chimney on May 1st and is in extremely critical condition. This morning, a union lawyer, accompanied by two of Chiba's comrades, braved heavy rain to climb to the top of the chimney and urged Chiba to come down. They saw that Chiba was almost too weak to stand. They brought a basket and 500 feet of rope to lower Chiba, but Chiba, although having suffered for many days, remained unmoved and would not come down until the strikers had achieved their goal. In the afternoon, two of his comrades again climbed the chimney with a change of clothes and a small tent to help him change out of his wet clothes and to set up the tent to protect him from the wind and rain. At 4:30 p.m., a doctor climbed to the top of the chimney and injected him with camphor. The doctor descended after examining Chiba and said that Chiba's condition is currently stable, but if he continues to stay in a high place and sleep in the open air, his life expectancy may not be prolonged. Chiba is only nineteen years old, and his strong will is admirable. As for the workers who have been on a hunger strike, there has been no respite since April 21st. About 50 people have been sent to the hospital due to weakness from prolonged hunger.</p>

<p>Soviet Russia Implements Consistent Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Melnikov, returned to his country on the 4th of this month upon the order of the Soviet government. Red Party members in Harbin all went to the station to see him off on that day. It is said that Mr. Mei will not return to his post this time. The affairs of the consulate will be handled by the Deputy Consul. Moreover, Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Yemushanov, Director Bandura, and Supervisor Ma Guan have also returned home. Director of the Railway Bureau, Rudyi, will also return home. The Soviet government has recently upgraded the Harbin Consulate to a Consulate General in order to implement a consistent Northeast diplomacy policy. All consuls stationed in the Northeast must be responsible to the Harbin Consul General for all affairs and are subject to the Harbin Consul General's command. At the same time, key personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway are being replaced by diplomatic personnel so that they can work together with the consulate. They will cooperate with each other in case of emergencies. Melnikov and Yemushanov are not the right people, so they have been transferred back to their country. Yemushanov's position has been filled by Director Kuzmin, who was previously the Soviet Consul General in Liaoning and the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in China after Karakhan was expelled. This time, he is coming to serve as Deputy Director, which means that the Chinese Eastern Railway Board of Directors has been transformed into another situation. As for who will fill Melnikov's position, nothing is known at present. (7th)</p>

<p>Ministry of Finance Decides to Implement Business Tax</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The budgeted revenue and expenditure of Jiangxi Province are both 14 million yuan, but since the communists are all over the country, the revenue is generated in only over ten counties such as Linchuan, Jinxian, Jiujiang, and Nanchang, totaling less than 30-40% of the budget. And after the implementation of eliminating likin and turning over the salt surcharge to the central government, revenue is further reduced by hundreds of thousands of yuan per month. At the same time, due to the suppression of communists, grain transport, and post-war reconstruction in communist areas,</p>
<h3 id="e73">News Summary <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>And Editor: Security forces, self-defense corps, etc., urgently need funds, and expenditures have surged. As of now in the 19th year of the Republic [1930], the deficit is approximately 7 million yuan. Arrears to various government agencies for administrative expenses have accumulated for several months, with some payments dating back to October of last year still outstanding. Beggar asylums and homes for the disabled and elderly receive only a few hundred yuan per month in funding, and these too are in arrears for several months. Consequently, large groups of disabled beggars are staging protests everywhere, waving banners and seeking relief. Furthermore, many individuals holding payment orders from the treasury are seeking redemption. Several days ago, the Provincial Government's general affairs staff even had a major conflict with the treasurer over the lack of funds to purchase tea leaves, highlighting the dire financial straits. Fortunately, the educational expense circulation notes and financial treasury note funds have been allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the salt surtax revenue. Therefore, the education sector seems to have found new hope after facing a dead end. The two types of notes had previously experienced a temporary surge in value, with circulation notes rising from 75% of face value to 98%. However, in recent days, due to the diversion of funds intended for redemption by the Provincial Department of Finance, they have resumed their decline. Short-term treasury notes, originally intended as a fund for the autumn grain transport, have also fallen to 55% because no grain can be collected from the bandit areas and the provincial treasury is required to allocate administrative expenses instead. The Provincial Department of Finance hopes to use central government subsidies and the opening of business tax as life-saving measures. Regarding central government subsidies, various sectors in the province have repeatedly appealed. The Director of the Department of Finance, Huang Bozhong, has gone to Beijing several times to petition. The Minister of Finance, Song, finally agreed to provide 40,000 yuan per month, in addition to the two educational fund notes, stating that this would only last until October. This is merely a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. As for the more than 3 million yuan in military expenses that the province previously advanced for the central government, there is still no news of repayment despite repeated demands. The regulations and rules for the collection of business tax have long been passed. It is estimated that more than 100,000 yuan will be collected in Nanchang, Jiujiang and other places with the establishment of bureaus; more than ten places such as Hekou will set up tax offices with less than 100,000 yuan; thirty-six counties will be handled by the local financial bureaus. However, the business community in the province has submitted petitions one after another requesting a postponement of the business tax due to the devastation of the bandit scourge and the decline of all industries. Nevertheless, the Department of Finance, in order to make up for government expenses, has decided to implement it and has decided to start from Nanchang and Jiujiang first, while bandit areas will be temporarily postponed.</p>

<p>Remnants of Bandit Forces in Hubei Flee to Anhui Border</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Li Mingzhong, the Pacification Commissioner of the border region of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, after receiving the order to encircle and suppress bandit forces, immediately moved the Commissioner's Office to Hanchuan to facilitate command. He also ordered the divisions of Ji Hongchang, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, Fan Xiji, Xia Douyin, and Xiao Zhichu to jointly launch a general offensive with the two divisions of Zhao Guantao stationed in Xinyang and Dai Minquan stationed in Gushi. After several fierce battles, the main force of the bandits was finally defeated. The important passes occupied by the bandit forces, such as Bopi River, Xinji, Qiliping, and Xuanhua Store, were also successively recovered. All the pseudo-organizations such as the Soviet government of the special zone of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui and Hubei and the Rural Soviet government were destroyed. Important members of the pseudo-government, military inspectors of the pseudo-special zone, and instructors of military transport in the special zone were all shot on the spot. On the 6th, a major organ of the Red bandits was uncovered in Hanchuan City, and a recent secret riot plan and a copy of the pseudo-central government's defense strategy for the second meeting of the National Army were seized. They were immediately sent to the Wuhan headquarters and forwarded to the General Headquarters for record. As for the remnants of the bandit forces, it was reported that they had fled to the border of Anhui. Li Mingzhong therefore ordered Ji Hongchang to lead his division to track down and pursue the bandits to eliminate them completely. At the same time, he reported the course of successive battles to General Commander Jiang and Director He of the Wuhan headquarters. The original telegram is as follows: "Director He of the Wuhan Headquarters, esteemed: According to the telegram from Chief Commander Ji Hongchang, the situation of pursuing and suppressing the Red bandits is as follows: (1) The Red bandits entrenched in the border area of Henan, Hubei and Anhui occupy Bopi River, Xinji, Qiliping, Xuanhua Store, etc. It is the entire 1st, 14th, and 15th armies, the entire Independent 3rd Division, and a part of the Guard Brigade, totaling about 45,000 people. The local farmers have all become Red slaves. (2) I have been ordered to lead the 30th, 31st, and 23rd divisions to fight fiercely with the Red bandits and Red slaves in Bopi River, Huwan, Xinji, Shuangshan, Changjian Factory River, Yuanshugang, Qiliping, Gufengling, Huangpi Dian, Xuanhua Store and other places for ten days from April 22. All the above places have been successively occupied, and about 600 square miles of land have been recovered. Most of the remnant bandits have fled to the Anhui border. (3) In all battles, about 6,000 to 7,000 enemies were killed, one pseudo-commander and one pseudo-captain were killed, and 797 bandits were captured, including many female bandits in yellow military uniforms, who have all been executed.

<p>Japanese Impersonate Our Workers to Enter Venue</p>
<p>The Masses Resolved to Submit Two Proposals to the National Assembly</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: May 9th is the National Humiliation Memorial Day for Yuan Shikai's acceptance of Japan's Twenty-One Demands. Unexpectedly, when all circles in Jinan held a meeting to commemorate it, the Japanese consul in Jinan actually dispatched detectives to impersonate our workers and sneak into the meeting to gather information and plot disturbances, which can be said to be extremely rogue. On this day (9th), all circles in Jinan, in commemoration of May 9th, not only lowered the flag to half-mast throughout the city to express condolences and stop entertainment banquets, but also held a citizens' assembly at the Jinan Municipal Government at 9 am. As early as 7 o'clock in the morning, people from all walks of life, officials from various agencies, and students from various schools lined up to attend the meeting, holding small flags with various slogans written on them, totaling more than 300 groups and about 50,000 people, with an extremely tragic atmosphere. The presidium of the conference was composed of Wang Yumin of the Provincial Reorganization Committee, Chen Weixin of the Provincial Government, He Shenzhai of the Department of Civil Affairs, Rui Xiebang of the Third Route Headquarters, Wang Weijun of the Department of Education, Ni Dexin of the Municipal Government, and Wu Yeshan of the County Reorganization Committee. Before the meeting started, the Japanese Consul Nishida Koichi secretly sent his police department's Japanese plainclothes detective Kaneko Sankyu, dressed in Chinese clothes, impersonated Chinese workers, and sneaked into the venue to gather information. He also held small flags and leaflets. Those who didn't know him regarded him as a Chinese patriotic man. In fact, Kaneko Sankyu has been in Jinan for many years. During the May Third Massacre, he led Japanese soldiers to brutally kill our compatriots. Many people in Jinan knew his face. Someone reported to a certain gentleman of the Provincial Reorganization Committee. The gentleman went forward to ask which group he belonged to. The Japanese claimed to be a worker. When asked in which factory he worked, he could not answer. The masses at the meeting believed that the Japanese dared to sneak into our citizens' assembly to gather information and advocated severe punishment. The Japanese saw that the situation was not good, so he scurried away. The meeting started at 9 o'clock. After Chairman Wang Yumin performed the etiquette, Wang Yumin reported on the purpose of the meeting, the facts of the National Humiliation Memorial Day, and the efforts that should be made in the future. Then Zhang Honglie, Director of the Department of Construction, Wen Chenglie, Mayor of Jinan, Wang Fangting, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, Chen Weixin, Counselor of the Provincial Government, Wang Weijun, Chief of the First Section of the Department of Education, Rui Xiebang, Chief of the Propaganda Section of the Third Route Headquarters, and Yuan Changguo, a student of Zhengyi Middle School, delivered speeches one after another, all of which were extremely impassioned and慷慨. Finally, Wang Yumin reported that the Preparatory Committee for the May Revolution Memorial Day of All Circles in Jinan had formulated two proposals and submitted them to the Citizens' Assembly to ask the National Assembly to put forward a resolution: (1) Abolish unequal treaties and implement revolutionary diplomacy. (2) Unconditionally abolish consular jurisdiction, please the General Assembly to resolve. The whole audience raised their hands and applauded to pass. The meeting adjourned at 11 o'clock.

<p>Gu Liangmin's Division Transferred to Caozhou</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Chen Xiaosi's division of the former Shandong Garrison Second Brigade left Shandong with Chen Diaoyuan last year and entered Anhui. Last month, they were ordered to go to Jiangxi to participate in the suppression of the Communists. Chen Xiaosi was killed in action. Chen Diaoyuan's division besieged and disarmed the Garrison Second Brigade due to certain relations. Afterwards, because most of the soldiers of the Yang brigade were from Shandong, they were sent to Jinan for disbandment. A total of more than 500 people arrived at the station by special train at 8:15 pm on the 10th. The soldiers immediately got off the train and scattered, which was very pitiful.</p>
<p>Gu Liangmin, commander of the Twenty-second Division, reported to the Third Route Headquarters today on the transfer of defense, stating that he led his division to Caozhou to inspect the situation there, which was still peaceful. He is now engaged in arranging everything to protect the local area and assist the production of social people. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Jiawang Company Builds Jiahu Railway <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Route Runs From Jiawang to Huzhuang</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Jiawang Coal Mine in Northeast Xuzhou has been actively reorganized recently. The Huachang Company of the coal mine plans to build the Jiahu Railway in order to expand its business and alleviate the coal shortage for the public. The Jiawang Company used to transport coal to Huzhuang by ox cart several years ago. Huzhuang is a water terminal connecting Jinning in Western Shandong to Qingjiangpu in Northern Huaihe, which is very convenient for shipping by boat in peacetime. Now, the East China Company has sent an engineering specialist to start surveying. The measured route is planned to start from the Jiawang General Mine and end at the Huzhuang Ferry. A large amount of coal is transported from the General Mine to Huzhuang Ferry, and then transferred to Western Shandong and Northern Huaihe. It is predicted that the river is deep enough to carry ships of 20 tons, which is sufficient for transportation. General Manager Cheng of the company has recently negotiated a coal transportation contract with the Jinpu Railway authorities, which will be able to transport it in more than a month. According to the investigation, the mine currently produces 200 tons of coal per day, which is still a small amount. When the coal wells are completed and the old wells are repaired, a new No. 9 large well will be opened, and the coal mine will produce in large quantities, with water and land transportation to expand business. The mine also sent specialists to set up coal plants along the water and land lines to major towns and ports in the north and south for sales. In the future, the mine's output will probably further open up the Xuzhou's source of benefits. At the beginning of the operation, it was recognized to contribute to local public welfare donations, and it is also possible to allocate expenses for it. (11th)</p>

<p>Pessimistic About the Future of Sericulture: After the spring silkworms hatched this year, the weather was uneven, which caused great losses to the silkworms. In the recent four or five days, there has been continuous heavy rain and the weather is unusually cold. Silkworms eat wet leaves and suffer a lot of damage. Therefore, mulberry leaves have no market price, and early growers have already gone through three molts. In previous years, silkworm cocoon merchants were busy preparing for cocoon activities at this time. This year, seeing that the silkworms are not in good condition, they are very discouraged. Therefore, there is no news about the preparations for cocoon activities. The other day, silk factory merchant Cheng Bingruo hosted leaders of cocoon merchants in the county to discuss the cocoon activities this year, so as to avoid huge losses. After the heavy fog yesterday morning, the sky cleared up and the weather also warmed up. The future of sericulture may still have a glimmer of hope.</p>

The next day, they sailed to Xiaojing area to purchase. However, at about 5 pm, while passing near Zhujing Qiao, they suddenly encountered two bandit boats, with more than a dozen bandits on board, each holding wooden sticks and sharp blades, shouting to stop the sand boat. Lu and others knew that they were bandits, so they tried to avoid them, but the boat was too heavy and could not move forward, so they were chased by the bandit boat, swarmed over the boat, twisted the boat partner Lu Sen, and forced them to hand over silver coins. Lu shouted for help, causing the bandit's anger, and stabbed Lu's leg several times. The rest of the people dared not speak out when they saw the situation.

<p>Huai Zhen Pig Merchants Petition to Stop the Collection of Pig Donations: The Huaiyin Yangzhou Che Tax Office originally had no item for pig police donations. Since Sun Chuanfang occupied Jiangbei, due to insufficient military needs and insufficient income from Lijin, he forcibly levied an additional jiao per pig when passing through the Yangzhou military tax office. When Sun's army retreated, the donation should have been stopped. However, it was difficult to theorize because the overall situation was uncertain. This year, the Lijin was cut, and this additional Lijin has been reported to the Civil and Financial Departments and the Provincial Government for instructions and approved for abolition. It was also ordered not to set up bureaus to collect it on the pretext. However, Zhu Ying, the director of the Public Security Bureau of the county, believed that the cancellation of the donation was related to the police salary, so he fabricated a statement and asked the Department of Finance to restore the collection. The Department of Finance thought that it was voluntary by the merchants and should be approved. Therefore, the county issued a notice to collect it. The pig merchants of the county do not accept the admission. In addition to telegraphing the Civil and Financial Departments for instructions to revoke it, they also selected Zhou Junsheng as a representative to come to the province to petition, presenting the situation of the county's Public Security Bureau Director changing the order of the Department and fabricating facts to coerce merchants to recognize the situation, and requesting the provincial government and the Civil and Financial Departments to strictly order a stop. It is heard that the representative received a telegram from the Huaiyin pig merchants yesterday, saying that the county's Public Security Bureau had detained the pig boats and detained the pig merchants because the pig merchants resisted paying the pig donation. Therefore, he specially met with Wang Mingliang, the representative of the Zhenjiang pig merchants, and went to the Department of Finance to petition today. At that time, Director Chen was out on official business, and Director Xia received the delegation. He explained in detail the situation of the illegal collection of pig donations by the Public Security Bureau, and asked him to immediately issue an order to stop it in order to maintain commerce and sympathize with the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<p>Director Xia promised to forward it to Director Chen immediately, and expressed that he would consider accommodating it. The representatives then left.</p>

Wang Jun, Commander of the 7th Division of the Jinpu Railway Garrison, dispatched Gong Chaomei's 39th Regiment of the 20th Brigade to be stationed in Suxian to suppress the bandits. Although they had achieved successive victories, the bandits would return after the troops left, remaining rampant. A large band of fierce bandits, numbering two to three hundred, suddenly appeared at Liuziji, 35 miles from the county seat, looting, burning, and killing with impunity. Local firearms were all seized, and over five hundred men and women were kidnapped, along with over a hundred head of livestock. A portion of the bandits occupied the settlement. Li Peng, the third battalion commander of Gong's regiment stationed in Suixi Town, dispatched battalion adjutant Xu with a team carrying mortars to suppress them. The bandits resisted stubbornly. Subsequently, the government troops advanced bravely, spraying machine-gun fire, killing over ten bandits on the spot and wounding several others, capturing one alive. The rest scattered and fled. Over ten of Li's battalion soldiers were also killed or wounded. The captured bandit has now been beheaded and displayed as a warning, and the search for the remaining bandits continues.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Further Discussion on Children's Reading Materials <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>(In response to Mr. Wu Yan'yin) Shang Zhongyi (II)</p>
<p>(II) Many proponents of fairy tales argue that children enjoy such stories and that they arouse their interest. However, we often hear children earnestly requesting "real" stories. Whether children truly enjoy imaginative reading materials can only be answered through long-term, systematic, and objective observation and precise experimentation. Empty talk and forceful arguments are of no use. Observations of this kind are still lacking, but practical experiments have indeed given us much knowledge. According to Dunn's recent detailed exploration, "imaginativeness" not only fails to arouse interest but even provokes slight aversion in boys. In addition, researchers who have conducted rigorous studies on reading interests, such as Terman, Zhao Deng (Joran), and Yu Er (UhI), all tell us that "imaginativeness" is by no means the best material for arousing interest, let alone the only method for stimulating fondness. Within the boundaries of not violating natural phenomena, there are many things that can arouse interest.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, let us assume that Dunn's, Zhao Deng's, and others' explorations contain errors or are not suitable for Chinese children. Let us further assume that "imaginativeness" can indeed arouse the interest of Chinese children. Can we then unconditionally follow this trend of interest? Do educators have a responsibility to shift preferences? Children like candy; should it be given without restraint? Toddlers want to possess everything they see; should this be suppressed? Therefore, even if "imaginativeness" could indeed arouse interest, it must be beneficial and harmless to children before it can be adopted. Moreover, we fundamentally doubt its ability to arouse interest. What's more, we also feel that its value is questionable and its dangers are manifold.</p>
<p>(III) Containing Lessons: Some people believe that the value of fairy tales lies in their implicit meaning between the lines. For the sake of discussion, let us put aside the question of whether containing lessons makes for good reading material and focus on the act of containing lessons itself. We feel that lessons based on facts and possible materials are likely to be more effective than lessons based on impossible fantasies. Fantastical allegories are sometimes difficult for even adults to understand, let alone children. Lessons based on impossible materials, which children know to be fictitious and fabricated, cannot inspire their confidence.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above three sections, we feel that the value of fairy tales is indeed questionable. The various reasons for maintaining their position in children's reading materials are insufficient. The so-called "inspiring imagination," "arousing interest," and "containing lessons" are all between having and not having, while reading materials that do not violate natural phenomena all "can have" the value that fairy tales "may or may not have," as well as "the dangers of fairy tales."</p>
<p>From a psychoanalytic point of view, fairy tales are most similar to dreamlike illusions and the fantasies of psychologically ill people. For adults to be too immersed in fantasy is detrimental to mental health, let alone children.</p>
<p>Children's sense of self is strong in their early years. Educators should assist them at this time, gradually enabling them to adapt to objective reality. During this process of proper adaptation, giving them material that contradicts the objective reality they are trying to adapt to can, in a passive sense, hinder the progress of their proper adaptation and, in an active sense, create a distorted adaptation. In the first step of this adaptation process, educators must be careful not to allow children to develop a fondness for leaving reality and immersing themselves in fantasy at an early age, lest they develop a tendency to seek satisfaction in fantasy.</p>
<p>Adults, with their experience and knowledge, often develop abnormal mental states when faced with the ruggedness of life's paths and the difficulty of dealing with reality, constructing self-deprecating psychologies such as "seeking satisfaction in fantasy," "everything is predetermined," "sour grapes," and "sweet lemons." Children, with their limited experience and knowledge, still need to adapt to this chaotic and complex adult society. Aiding and guiding them is still not enough to ensure they can cope with the real environment, lest they fall into abnormal mental states. How can we then dazzle them with fantasy and mislead them with the unreal?</p>
<p>The protagonists in fairy tales mostly achieve their goals through chance, magic, or lucky assistance, rarely creating happiness through direct effort and sincere striving. On this point alone, most fairy tales should be eliminated. Because our responsibility to children and society is to teach children to use sincere effort to seek the welfare of society and individuals, we must not encourage the kind of unearned happiness found in many fairy tales.</p>
<p>In short, the dangers of fairy tales can be summarized as follows: (1) They easily hinder children's progress in adapting to objective reality; (2) They easily lead to the habit of escaping from real life and fleeing into fantasy; (3) They easily lead to a tendency to seek satisfaction in fantasy or to pray for unearned gains; (4) They easily foster a sense of fear and aversion towards real life in children; (5) They easily lead to a process of bizarre and chaotic thinking.</p>
<p>(My Position) In the minds of most people, when children's reading materials are mentioned, fairy tales (including stories about gods and immortals, as well as other fantastical stories) are immediately associated with them, and children's reading materials and fairy tales are often confused. This is extremely unfortunate. In Zhongyi's battle against fairy tales, there are requests to fellow educators:</p>
<p>(1) It is essential to distinguish between the two terms "children's reading materials" and "fairy tales," and to recognize that fairy tales are only a tiny part of children's reading materials. Even if all fairy tales were banished, children's reading materials would still have a very broad and rich scope. Furthermore, regarding the analysis of the value and drawbacks of fairy tales, we can summarize it into two points: A. The value of fairy tales is indeed questionable; B. The subconscious dangers of fairy tales are indeed numerous. Is it permissible to use materials of questionable value and numerous dangers to occupy children's precious time? Instead of using this kind of reading material, why not use reading materials that have the value of fairy tales but without their dangers, based on facts and possible materials? Therefore, (2) It is essential to reduce the amount of time children spend on fairy tales to the bare minimum—allocating most of the time to reading materials that do not violate natural phenomena.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the requirements for fairy tales themselves, we must greatly reduce the number of fairy tales and choose them with extra caution. (I will draft another article to discuss this kind of selection.) Only the first-class fairy tales that truly have artistic value and playful interest should be retained, such as Kipling's "The Elephant's Child" or Lofting's "Doctor Dolittle" (using only the first book). The motto for retention and selection is "Rather be short than shoddy."</p>
<p>(In response to Mr. Wu Yan'yin's questions)</p>
<p>Mr. Wu published his opinions on Zhongyi's lecture at the Children's Education Society in the Shenbao and Xinwenbao on the 29th and 30th of last month, raising five questions. Apart from points 1, 2, 3, and 4, which have natural answers in the above text, I will now take the opportunity to answer the remaining two:</p>
<p>Wu (Question): Should stories about gods and monsters be judged based on whether they are logical or illogical? Shang (Answer): Not only stories about gods and monsters, but all teaching materials and reading materials (except for a few humorous materials) should be judged based on whether they are logical or illogical. What right do adults have to give children materials that are "illogical"?</p>
<p>Wu (Question): What are the stories about animals that Mr. Shang mentioned that do not speak but only describe the animals' lives? Shang (Answer): From this question, it seems that Mr. Wu believes that without stories, there are no reading materials about animals. Zhongyi would sincerely like to introduce Jean-Henri Fabre's works to Mr. Wu. After reading them, perhaps this kind of question will no longer arise, and perhaps it will open up a new field in Mr. Wu's mind for children's reading materials. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e91">National Assembly and National Education Lu Shaoji (II) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>(VI) Emphasize Teacher Education: Teachers are the mothers of national education, or in other words, the foundation of the nation. They are the carriers of national culture. Whether we want to preserve national culture or develop national talent, we cannot do without their strength. This is what the education authorities should emphasize in teacher education. 1. Teacher training schools should be public in principle and should not be freely established. 2. Teacher education should be given special emphasis. The most suitable scientific education and the most rigorous physical and mental training must be used to cultivate teachers who are morally and academically sound as the main task.</p>
<p>(VII) Vigorously Implement Scientific Education: This is the current problem of Chinese education. If science does not flourish, then industry will not prosper, people's livelihoods will be impoverished, and the country's power will be weak. Furthermore, if science does not flourish, people's intelligence will not be enlightened, superstition will not be eliminated, and it will greatly hinder the progress of the revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was aware of this, so he vigorously advocated scientific education (often advocating the import of scientific knowledge). Today, the National Government should put forward a sum of money specifically for the development of scientific education.</p>
<p>(VIII) Safeguard Educational Independence: This has two layers of meaning: 1. Independent educational funding (as stipulated by the Kuomintang government: "...increase educational funding and guarantee its independence"). All national educational funding should be collected, managed, and distributed by the education sector itself, and other agencies should not arbitrarily divert it. 2. Independent hiring rights for the education sector. From the Minister of Education to primary school and kindergarten teachers, there is considerable protection for their professional positions, and there are certain standards for the selection, appointment, transfer, demotion, dismissal, and removal of personnel. Among the two types of independence, "educational funding" is particularly important. If educational funding is not independent, there will be no educational fund, and there will be no hope for "saving the country through education."</p>
<p>Other points that national education should pay attention to in the future include promoting character education, implementing political education, emphasizing military education, improving rural education, implementing labor education, emphasizing commercial education, and improving the treatment of teachers and staff, as well as encouraging teachers and staff to engage in academic writing.</p>
<p>In short, the prevalence of national education is closely related to the strength or weakness of the country. I sincerely hope that this National Assembly can make detailed provisions in the law for the implementation of national education, so that all people in the country can be sound individuals, so as to promote constitutional government.

<p>The draft budget for education expenditure in Anhui Province for the 20th year of the Republic has been prepared by the Department of Education and submitted to the provincial government for review. The total amount is over 2.39 million yuan, an increase of over 570,000 yuan compared to the 19th year. The uses include increasing social education institutions, restoring three vocational schools, and merging Zhengyang and Xin'an Vocational Schools, etc. In addition to the central government subsidy of 1.2 million yuan, the province should bear over 1.19 million yuan. The School Federation is worried that the provincial government will not approve it and is currently petitioning the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Joint Opening Ceremony of People's Schools in the Provincial Capital of Jiangsu <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the closing of the literacy campaign propaganda week in the provincial capital of Jiangsu, 20 people's schools were immediately established. At 3:00 PM on May 10th, a joint opening ceremony for the first session was held in the auditorium of the Department of Education. Several hundred people attended. Yu Qingtang, the head of the Department of Education, presided over the meeting, and Shao Zhenlou was the recorder. The chairman reported that only 25 people's schools are planned to be added in the provincial capital, and only 20 have been established so far. Among the more than 170,400 people in the provincial capital, there are more than 64,000 illiterate young people and adults, and out-of-school children are not included. How could a small number of 25 people's schools accommodate them? Therefore, the money used by the Literacy Movement Committee in running people's schools, in addition to the 4,000 yuan spent by the Department of Education from the provincial social education funds, plus the 500 yuan subsidy from various party and government agencies in the provincial capital, totals 4,500 yuan. Do not think that this is a lot. According to the current actual situation, it seems that a lot of funding is indeed needed before there can be a solution. Next, Chen, the head of the Department of Education, Ge Jianshi, the secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Qi Yong, the director of the Zhenjiang People's Education Center, gave speeches. Then, Kong Xianzhang, a student from the First People's School, Zhang Shaoqing, a student from the Second School, Yang Yingfeng, a student from the Thirteenth School, and a female representative from the First School gave responses. Finally, there were recreational performances.</p>

<p>— Long</p>
<p>One should naturally speak little about useless things. And even about things beneficial to oneself, one should speak little, because what is beneficial to oneself often causes harm to others.</p>
<p>A woman can only receive the love of the opposite sex in her youth. Therefore, in today's society, there are many sex maniacs in love, but no true love at all.</p>
<p>In the past, women were often afraid of being divorced by their husbands. Now, women are only afraid that their husbands are unwilling to divorce them.</p>
<p>Most good young people are caught in the web of love before leaving school. Before their studies are completed, they are already weary of life. Is this due to poor education or a bad society?</p>
<p>If you can understand that the money you suck from your compatriots is being used to manufacture guns and warships for future attacks on China, you will resist without being told to resist.</p>
<p>Today's students are in an environment of dancing and tea parties in the East and West. It is truly difficult to expect them to bury themselves in books and become talents to save the world from the violent sun.</p>
<p>Those who constantly use terms of endearment as a verbal tic are certainly not as devoted in their feelings as those who are taciturn.</p>
<p>The art of returning to youth does not exist in the world. Why are those who fight for power and profit so foolish?</p>
<p>If all countries do not quickly wake up from the delusion of dominating the world and continue to build weapons of mass destruction, there will be a day when humanity is wiped out.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Notes on a London Inspection <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Among the famous cities of Europe, there are four. Rome is simple, solemn, and majestic, and rich in historical value. Paris, a flourishing art garden, uniquely releases wonders, and forms the center of modern culture. Berlin, cautious, dignified, and magnificent, represents the spirit of science. As for cities with a large population, holding the reins of the economic world, and flourishing in modern times through the development of industry and commerce, England is a giant.</p>
<p>London straddles both banks of the Thames River. The north is the city center, with towering buildings and endless mansions. The south bank is full of factories with thick smoke covering the sky. The population is over seven million, which can be described as a human beehive. This city has suffered two great catastrophes: the Great Plague in 1665 and the Great Fire in 1666. The entire city was reduced to ashes, and 70,000 people died. The English rebuilt London. Last summer, I had the opportunity to travel there. After getting off the train, I went directly to visit Ambassador Shi. The conversation was very pleasant, and he guided me to see the embassy and the room where Mr. Sun Yat-sen was detained during his ordeal in London. The room was on the third floor, barely able to accommodate the knees. There were iron bars outside the window, and the light was dim. I could imagine the feeling of being in an iron-barred cell. Ambassador Shi also introduced me to Sun Shifu, the embassy secretary, to be my guide, which was very touching.</p>
<p>The British Parliament is the origin of the world. It is located on the bank of the Thames River, covering an area of 30,000 square meters. The project took ten years and cost three million British pounds. It is one of the famous buildings in London. There are three towers standing majestically in the east and west. There are about hundreds of halls in the middle, magnificent and solemn. The walls are painted with portraits and sculptures of past kings. The auditorium has about 500 seats, while the number of members is 670. Those who do not occupy a seat when the majority is present have no right to speak. The British promote the creation of the parliamentary system to appeal to the world, but the fact that the chaos and irregularities are like this is quite strange.</p>
<p>Westminster Abbey was built in the seventh century and faces the Parliament. Successive kings ascended the throne and held coronation ceremonies here. The names of famous people and mausoleums are listed in the middle. The interaction of politics and religion can be seen here.</p>
<p>The British Museum is a Roman-style building, grand in scale. From the Stone Age to the present, the content is divided into treasures from various countries. In particular, there are countless ancient paintings, famous porcelain, jade seals, and classics from China, which were looted during the Boxer Rebellion. What is most heartbreaking is the display of various opium pipes, which are numerous and eye-catching. The British introduced drugs into China, but they do not realize it, instead mocking and belittling it. The intentions of the imperialists are also very dangerous.</p>
<p>There are two national art galleries. One collects paintings from the Middle Ages, masterpieces by outstanding artists such as Raphael Lebrun. The other was founded in 1890, when Tate personally donated his lifelong collection to the country, so it is also called the Tate Gallery. It displays paintings from recent centuries, new works such as Gauguin Matisse are also included. There are about 20 museums in London, and art galleries account for one-fifth of them. The scale and equipment are inferior to those of Paris.</p>
<p>Madame Tussaud's Exhibition was founded by Madame Tussaud, hence the name. Since 1802, almost all famous people from the government and the public have been listed. They are divided according to the changing times. The statue of Mr. Sun Yat-sen of China is also displayed in it. He is wearing a fur-collared coat, looking like a middle-aged man, but his cheeks are too full and not very similar. Great writers such as Shakespeare Dickens Scott Hugo Shaw and Bern, sitting and standing, are lifelike. The skill is amazing.</p>
<p>What is most noteworthy is that there are nearly two million unemployed workers in London, dressed in rags and squatting on the streets everywhere. Passing through its fields, there are thorns and weeds everywhere, and there is very little cultivation. Food and raw materials are all taken from the colonies, and there is a risk of insufficient supply.</p>
<h3 id="e110">A Record of a Farewell Spring Gathering <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Chunshu</p>
<p>Half the cherries are as small as beans, and after nights of wind and rain, who knows how many flowers have fallen? The flowers are gradually fading, and the leaves are getting better. Bees are buzzing around a wisteria frame. The swallows also know that the spring is getting old, softly discussing how to hatch their chicks. Separated by the curtain, the sound is quiet, afraid that the paired birds will attract the laughter of the orioles. This is a spring evening poem by Mr. Yu Baoqing. I was wandering on Baiyun Creek, enjoying the spring in the beautiful pavilions. I only knew the beauty of the spring scenery, but I didn't know that the spring scenery was already fading. A few days ago, the members of the Mingshe Society gathered at Mr. Yu's Guangyutang for the third spring farewell gathering since Xinwei. The host was his son Lan Yu. Although there was heavy rain, twenty-eight people came from afar. Yao Gongjinqiu came from Jingkou, Xu Gongxiu from Qingpu, Yuan Mengbai from Shaoxing, Wang Xiucang from Xiaoshan, and I came from Wujin, borrowing the Xiling Seal Society to publish the second collection of my paintings and poems of scenic spots. Residents such as Chen Yitao from Haining, Gu Dingmei from Kuaiji, Li Zhonglian from Ji'an, Zhu Dake from Jiaxing, Wu Qinmu, Hu Jifan from Jixi, Chen Daolan from Chaozhou, Lu Anqin from Kunshan, Cao Shuhang from Wuxian, Zheng Zhian, and Huang Yingchan all arrived one after another. Everyone took out their spring farewell poems, and there were many wonderful works. The sound of chanting echoed the sound of rain. I also showed the horizontal scroll of the Mid-Autumn Festival painting with the fellows, the Yuanyang Lake Moon Viewing Picture. After the appreciation, the banquet was set up, but Zhu Guwei and Zheng Sucan could not come due to their deployment to the north. Sun Yusheng was prevented by rain, and they all sent letters of apology. So we entered the seat together, drinking wine and composing poems, almost forgetting what world we were in. Looking up, I saw a couplet written by Mr. Hu Shou hanging in the hall. The sentence said, "The spring atmosphere is perceived by poets, and sitting at night can deepen the understanding of painting." Reading it is like a pre-written gift for us to see the scenery. After madly chanting and tapping the beat, we got up after the wine was gone. Seeing the swords, spears, and halberds arranged in the courtyard, I asked in fear. I learned that Jian Yu was proficient in practice and had been practicing for many years. Not only is he a man of refined tastes, but his martial arts skills are truly a national weapon. He is worthy of his name Yuan Ying. After saying goodbye and leaving, the bell rang ten times. I listened to the rain in the hostel and recorded it. (No payment accepted)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Past and Present of Yangzhou Salt Merchants (Part 1) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Weng</p>
<p>The Chinese salt law was never inapplicable in the prosperous era of the Qing Dynasty. Over time, abuses arose, and it became increasingly decadent. Salt law reform is a real need. However, the dispute between the old and the new could not be resolved. Reading the Shen Bao on April 30, the reasons for delaying the implementation of the new salt law were mentioned. One was whether the tax collection on the spot without the intervention of salt merchants could reliably exceed the income of 130 million yuan per year. This statement is the most important. However, we common people do not want to argue too much. However, Yangzhou's prosperity has always been based on the salt industry. Last month, I passed through the Han River and took a look at the scenery. It was unusually desolate. I couldn't help but feel the changes between the past and the present.</p>
<p>Yangzhou is famous for its six dynasties. Since ancient times, there has been the poem "waist tied with a hundred thousand, spend it riding a crane to Yangzhou". It is true. Since the rise of the Salt Court, the salt merchants have built high platforms and wide mansions, constantly dancing and singing, sipping wine, and having beautiful women attend. A group of famous scholars and beauties competed to write poems. Those who could write poetry often had the sentence "a thousand families raise daughters, first teach them songs, ten acres of flowers are planted instead of fields." Its prosperity is indeed extreme. The officials below the Salt Court competed in splendor. Even the large flag outside the gate of the Salt Court earned a lot of silver every month. What else can be known? Now, a piece of wilderness has been turned into a sheep farm for a long time. After the restoration, I once passed by here and met an old woman in her seventies who said, "This was the old site of the Salt Court." Alas.</p>
<p>When Emperor Qianlong made his southern tour, it was extremely extravagant. The elegance was brilliant. Everything was perfect. The emperor casually said, "The scenery beside Xiaojin Mountain is extremely beautiful, but it lacks a pagoda." The salt merchant heard this and reported a pagoda in a few days. Or he casually said, "A bridge is missing in a certain place." The salt merchant heard this and built a bridge in a few days. This is still not surprising. What is even more surprising is that when I looked at the countryside in the spring, I suddenly saw four big characters arranged in the wheat field in the cauliflower bushes. The color was yellow and square. The words said "Long live the Emperor". Before the southern tour, the salt merchants had instructed the farmers to show them the shape of the characters and use rapeseed to plant them in the same style. It seemed natural. They only wanted to win the emperor's smile, and the amount spent was countless. Therefore, the name of the salt merchant was the best in the world. I once heard from the elders in Beijing that Emperor Qianlong said to the prince in jest when he returned to the palace, "It is better for you to be born in the family of a salt merchant in Yangzhou than to be born in the imperial family." Alas, how prosperous. Now, there are few carriages and horses under Pingshan Hall, and the willows and peach blossoms are falling by the Slender West Lake. In the winter of the seventh year of the Republic of China, I met a descendant of an old salt merchant begging on the road in Lvyang Village in the snowstorm. He had little money in his pocket. I only gave him eight hundred words. My heart trembled for it. The above is inevitable. Why can I bear this?</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Time: March 19 - April 24, 1931</p>
<p>Itinerary: Qingdao, Dalian, Shenyang, Gyeongseong (Seoul) Korea, Busan, Tokyo, Hakone, Bikai (?), Seikyo (?), Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki</p>
<p>Traveling is my nature. Perhaps it is my heredity. Because my father Jing loved to travel. Forty years ago, my father's footprints had already been all over the three major river basins of China.</p>
<p>Traveling is the most exciting thing, but there are also several conditions: (1) There must be suitable companions. (2) There must be a certain understanding of the places visited in advance. (3) There must be adequate physical strength and spirit. However, the excitement I speak of includes two aspects: laughter and crying. On March 19, I took the Dalian Maru from Shanghai. A flock of seagulls saw us off. From morning to night they did not leave. Three chapters on seagulls.</p>
<p>The blue sea is boundless. The white seagulls are in flocks. They linger at midday, going back and forth. Seagulls, you accompany me on a grand tour, sending me off for a thousand miles with earnestness. I have the same hobby as you, and I will roam the universe. Alas, alas, I know that high integrity is against the customs. Can a person not be as good as you?</p>
<p>The snowy waves are surging, and the boat is reading higher and higher. The seagulls are coming. I will invite you. Sometimes soaring freely in the air, and sometimes fluttering on the waves. Suddenly disappearing into the water, alarming the fish. Seagulls, you are the great enemy of the fish, and you still use your sharp beak to boast. I think of your need to survive, and I think of your empty stomach. Although there is not much food left, it is enough to feed your old age. Seagulls, seagulls, may you be auspicious phoenixes, not evil owls.</p>
<p>Seagulls, seagulls, you have a flock, and I also have a partner. This blue-clothed woman is my wife. That beard is white and beautiful. They are all my friends. Seagulls, if you have knowledge, I will introduce you to each other and shake hands. I hope that people and birds can be close to each other, and birds and fish can be close to each other. The harmony is a unity, and sincerity touches all things. All living things in the world should support each other and not betray each other. Keep my heart as calm as the unwavering waves, and may you live long and healthy.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Turning Point of the Hawthorne Detective Case (12) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorne's composure has always been admired by me. Sometimes, no matter how his emotions change, he can keep them from showing on his face. At this time, his gaze was fixed, and his cheekbones were slightly flushed, showing the anger in his heart, which could not be suppressed. Zhang Baoquan also seemed to be hinted at, clenched his fists, and struck the table, as if expressing injustice for Hawthorne. I asked again, "Looking at it this way, this matter must not be accidental. What happened to you later?" Hawthorne said, "At that time, I had two understandings. First, maybe someone was deliberately playing a prank. Second, maybe someone wanted to play tricks in the Gao family, but they were afraid of me, so they deliberately transferred me away. So I rushed back to the Gao family and asked quietly, but nothing happened. I asked about you again. According to Pei Xian, he didn't even know when you left. So I became anxious, fearing that you might have been assassinated. I didn't know your whereabouts for a while, so I called your house first. You hadn't returned yet. I felt even more worried. I called my residence again. Shi Guicai told me that you were here. Now you haven't suffered much loss, but that necklace is another problem. Where is the necklace?" Hearing this, Zhang Baoquan had already opened the white cloth package on the table, took out the necklace, and handed it to Hawthorne with both hands. Hawthorne took it and looked at it, and exclaimed in surprise, "Alas, this thing is valuable. According to the current market price, it is worth five or six thousand -" When he said this, he suddenly held the necklace in his palm and paused as if weighing the weight of the circle. Then he walked to the electric light on the desk and brought the necklace closer to the light to take a closer look. A trace of a smile suddenly appeared on his always cold face. He let out a sound that was both admiring and mocking, saying, "What a pearl necklace. The price is worth more than thirty yuan." I couldn't help but jump up and say, "Is it fake?" Zhang Baoquan also blushed and replied, "Alas, my vision is really too bad." Hawthorne interjected, "You don't have to take the blame. This thing is really well made. You were also in a panic. Didn't I just see it wrong? Now let's not talk about empty words. How did this thing come about? What is the purpose of that person playing this trick? Let's all use our brains on this."</p>

<h3 id="e114">Financial Standard Gold Market Situation is Confusing <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Extremely Unpredictable Rumors The gold market presented a series of high peaks yesterday, but the situation was hesitant, and the fluctuations were irregular. The supply and demand from major households varied greatly. From morning to noon, there were more than four taels of turnover. It was mostly because the overseas silver market continued to report declines, so it saw a high opening again. Afterwards, both the spot and forward exchange rates rose, once reducing by half a point, but buying on the surface was strong, so the price rose steadily, once appearing at 750 taels. Then, when Yuancheng and others entered and then withdrew, and it was rumored that a certain bank would release some gold, it went down. Now it has fallen sharply by more than four taels. The trend of the future market is normal, only with a difference of about two taels, and the exchange rate is flat. However, it suddenly saw an increase, probably because there were many buyers, trying to push it up. According to the people's hearts, the transaction volume was not large.</p>
<p>High Peaks Repeatedly Appear in the Early Market From the opening of the June market in the early market, it increased by 1 tael and 4 qian, totaling 747 taels. Large bars shrank by 1/16, and silver prices for forward contracts also fell by 1/8, private telegrams by 1/4, the market was sluggish, but buying was very strong. Yuanheng, Hengxing, Hengyu, Senchang, Yong and others all purchased, so the price continued to show a peak, rising from 46 taels 5 qian to 49 taels 3-4 qian. Only one tael rose and fell, and the initial quotation was reduced by 125, US dollars by 25, and Japanese gold increased by 1 point 25. At that time, it increased from 8 taels and a half to 9 taels and a half, mostly because the internal exchange rates were also firm. The bank initially issued 25, and later 1875. Taiwan absorbed 1 tael 5 qian 9 fen 875 from Dalian. Because Yongfeng, Daxing, Yongshunli, Wanxing, Hengxing all sold, it immediately went down by more than 2 taels, and at 10:15 it was 47 taels and 1 qian. Soon Fuxing, Yongyu, Da Hengyu, Chengfeng, Yong Yuancheng and others all had inflows, and it immediately turned high by 3 taels, reaching 49 taels 9 qian at 10:30 (transactions were once made at 50 taels). After entering, the exchange rate was still flat, especially because Yuancheng suddenly withdrew again, and Tianyu, Yonghengxing, Zhifeng, Yong Yuanmao Yong and others sold one after another, and it was rumored that a certain bank's order was about to move, so people's hearts were downward, falling by more than four taels, and at 11:00 it was 45 taels and a half. Before long, buyers were still diligent, raising it by 3 taels, and at 11:40 it was 48 taels and 4 qian, but Yuancheng, Yuankang, Xiangqian, Changxiang and others were tirelessly selling, and the midday closing was only 45 taels and 8 qian, and then a small amount of money was pressed, and the quotation was changed to 783 taels, totaling 33-34 taels to 37 taels. The Afternoon Market Trends Towards a Stable Route. The afternoon market opened at 45 taels and 8 qian, then at 5 taels and 1 qian, and then at 5 taels and 8 qian. Because the Indian exchange rate increased again, Yuan Mao Yong and others sold out, so around 2:30, it finally reached 44 taels and 4 qian. Zhifeng Yong Yongfeng came in, and at 2:45 it was 6 taels and 7 qian. Afterwards, retail investors sold, and at 3:15 it was 45 taels. The foreign exchange transaction was quite small, and the market situation was flat. There was not much volume in the over-the-counter delivery, but the price was calculated to have risen or fallen by 1 tael. After 3:40, the buyers were seen to be numerous, and after 4:00 it was 6 taels and 7 qian, followed by a few coins in rotation. At 4:30, the market closed at 46 taels and 7 qian, an increase of 1 tael and 1 qian compared to the previous day. After the closing, it continued to trade at 48 taels, and it was heard that Taichang, Zhifeng Yong and others had come in, and people's hearts were looking up, so the goods were raised by 1 tael and 3 qian. The largest price of the day was 49 taels and 9 qian, and the smallest price was 44 taels and 4 qian (according to the listed price), with a difference of 5 taels and 5 qian. The goods opened at 7 taels in the early morning, closed at 5 taels and 5 qian at noon, 5 taels and 5 qian in the afternoon, and 8 taels at the closing. The quotation was pressed down by 38 taels to 36 taels, with a logged price of 46 taels, a water supplement of 44 taels, and 45 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Disorganized Inflow and Outflow, No Large Tickets The transactions between the same industry are complicated, with Chengfeng Yong, Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuanheng, Fuxing Yong, and Yu Da all coming in. Yuancheng initially came in and then went out, and Qian Changxiang, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, Wanxing and others had inconsistent inflows and outflows. Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Tong Taichang, Shunli, Changshengyong, Yongfeng, Daxingyong, Hengxing, Tianyu Yong, Yuantai, and Yuankangxiang all went out. In the afternoon, the inflow and outflow of Yuanmao Yong, Yuanda Yong, and Dadecheng Shunli were uncertain. Yu Da, Zhifeng Yong, Daxing Yong, Yuankangxiang, and Tong Taichang all came in, while Wanxing went out. The Dalian gang issued a total of 1,800-1,900 tickets and bought a total of 1,000 tickets. The Guangdong gang issued 600-700 tickets. Speculator Mr. Wu had a slight outflow.</p>

India had some selling pressure, but transactions were scarce, and the market was calm. After the market closed, conditions were very stable. The United States was inclined to sell. Recently, a New York telegram reported that the American bank rate also decreased successively by 0.125, to 28 cents. The British rate against the US rate decreased by 0.03125, and the US rate against the British rate decreased by 0.0625, both to 4 dollars 86.375 cents.

<h3 id="e117">Silver Tael Rebounds, Market Stabilizes <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver tael market, because banks considered the price to be too low, raised prices together. Also, the Sichuan gang slightly reduced their demand, so the situation rebounded. However, the future rise and fall of the market cannot be determined at present. Generally, it depends on the needs of the times. However, if the cocoon market is not good and the uses are naturally scarce, then even if it is obviously high, it is only temporary.</p>
<p>Interest Rate: (Silver Tael) The early market interest rate suddenly improved by 1.25%, to 7 qian 2 fen 7.875 li. The noon market increased by another 0.125%, to 7 qian 2 fen 8 li. The bank's buying interest was very strong. (Silver Discount) was also better than the previous day. Both the morning and noon markets opened at 5%, which was 1% better than the previous day. There was also a 4-5% premium for drafts.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The Jiangnan small silver coin was 6 qian 5 fen 1 li in the early market and 6 qian 5 fen 2 li in the noon market, with transactions made. The early market saw 2,000 jiao, and the noon market saw 3,500 jiao. The Guangdong small coin was 6 qian 4 fen 4.5 li in both the morning and noon markets, with transactions made. The early market saw 85,000 jiao, and the noon market saw 40,000 jiao. Copper coins rebounded by 2,500 wen, to 380 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Tael Inflow and Outflow: (Silver Funds) Yesterday's bank settlement news reported that Chinese merchants settled over 2.5 million taels in drafts, foreign merchants over 1.9 million taels, various cargo exchange taxes and other items settled 9.89 million taels, special settlements 1.56 million taels, warehouse entry 700,000 taels, warehouse exit 600,000 taels.

<p>Securities: Bond Prices Continue to Decrease Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot transactions of public bonds continued to be scarce, while the futures market remained active. The former market had two trading sessions with over 10 million in transactions, and the latter market also had 9.9 million yuan. Various bonds were slightly firmer in the two sessions of the former market, while the latter market hovered and trended weaker. As a result, only customs duties continued to fall by more than 1 yuan, while the other amounts were only about 0.2-0.3 yuan. The total spot transactions for the whole day were only 10,000 yuan, while futures reached 2,230,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Quiet and Firm</p>
<p>The yarn market is quiet, and the rumors of the previous days are false. The Osaka Sampin (three-product exchange) has seen dramatic gains recently, and actual sales are not bad. Various gangs have some scattered transactions. Furthermore, one manufacturer stated that in order to maintain the yarn market, they are prepared to purchase large quantities. However, selling pressure is still heavy, and floating rumors about the situation persist. The season is still for clearing old stock of 10-count coarse yarn, and the intention to sell is still strong, so the market is still in a state of contention. In general, it is possible to stabilize temporarily.</p>
<p>Human Mark Up by Six to Seven Qian: The opening of the Human Mark (Ren Biao) market in the morning was due to further declines in American cotton, and the rumors of the previous day were rampant, creating a very weak situation. Chinese merchants fell to within the 60 tael range. Later, due to the rebound in Sampin yarn, there were fewer sellers, and it continued to rebound, resulting in gains of 3-5-8 qian for each month. The market was very good at the opening in the afternoon, but selling pressure was still heavy and it fell slightly. As a result, recent months rose by 2-4 qian, and distant months fell by 1 qian. Transactions totaled 23,600 bales. It was found that Heshen sold 1,400 bales, Shenxin 1,900 bales, Tianlong 650 bales, Rongxing 1,950 bales, Tiancheng 900 bales, and Dachang 700 bales. Jifeng purchased 950 bales, Gengfeng 1,300 bales, Changfeng 900 bales, Lichang 500 bales, Deji 750 bales, Taixing 950 bales, and Yuda 600 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>September 1563 6 43,250</p>
<p>October 1565 7 38,900</p>
<p>Spot Demand Needs to Become More Concentrated: Spot yarn sales are relatively good. It was found that all gangs purchased a total of 1,650 bales throughout the day, and the same industry purchased 1,300 bales. The market is trending firm. Among the customer gangs, Tianjin purchased 100 bales, the interior purchased 350 bales, Changsha purchased 200 bales, Hankou purchased 500 bales, Guangdong purchased 90 bales, Shantou purchased 185 bales, the Northern gang purchased 120 bales, Yunnan purchased 100 bales, and miscellaneous gangs purchased 140 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Cotton Market in Stabilization <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, the underlying stock is depleted, and the sources from various routes are declining, so people's hearts are settled, and sellers are not very enthusiastic. The gold market is firm, but American cotton trends are flat, so the gains and losses are very small. Therefore, according to the general situation, the cotton market lacks confidence.</p>
<p>Hubei Mark (Han Biao) Has No Major Movement: The opening of the Hubei Mark market in the morning should have followed American cotton, but people's hearts went against it, and each month rose by 1-2 qian due to a lack of sellers. The market was slightly softer in the afternoon, and each month fell by 0.05 to 1-2 qian. Transactions totaled 51,000 dan. It was found that Rongxing sold 4,900 dan, Tongxing 2,900 dan, and Dachangcheng 2,000 dan. Ruid purchased 4,700 dan, and Taixing 2,700 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e119">British and Indian Cotton Markets Rebound at the Weekend <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Bombay: Last week, both Indian and American cotton were weak. When they fell, the bulls took profits, but in reality, they were still firm. Afterwards, American cotton rebounded, and Far East demand improved, with a sharp increase. As a result, the difference between Bombay and Liverpool narrowed. At present, speculators expect Far East demand to increase and are inclined to be bullish. Spot goods were calm at the beginning of the week and more active later. European demand was very poor. Japanese manufacturers were reported to have purchased 32,000 bales. The statistics for last week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Liverpool: Last week, spot sales continued to be quiet, and futures were flat due to a lack of speculation. The weather in the Four Americas Liang area was not good at the weekend, and market prices rose, but the market was still uncertain. Egyptian cotton also rebounded with American cotton after being flat.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Overseas Cotton Yarn Mostly Weak with Few Gains <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>American Spot Cotton Up 1 Cent: Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to a lack of major buyers, good weather, and bad news from Liverpool. Futures fell 9-12 points, and spot fell 10 points. British cotton futures fell 13 points, and spot fell 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell 5 points. Indian cotton was soft due to the poor opening market price in Liverpool.

<p>Grains: Clear Weather Causes Flour and Wheat to Both Weaken</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market showed a flat and weak trend. The quotation for foreign wheat did not fluctuate much. The weather has turned clear, so the market weakened after the opening. Although the current clear or rainy weather has little impact on the wheat itself, people are bound by habit and are inevitably shifting. Recent actual sales have not been active. Tianjin's daily sales are only around 30,000, and prices are also hovering. If there is no chance of strong sales in the future, the standard will also need to be driven. As a result, the current month is down 0.05% from the previous day, May is down 0.1%, July is down 0.15%, August-September is down 0.1%, and October is down 0.075%.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat futures market, the current month was seen to be weak due to abundant existing stocks and a lack of demand from factories. The distant months were seen to be softer as people's anxiety about the weather turning clear had dissipated, so selling sentiment gradually increased, and the market fell. If the weather does not change before the new wheat harvest, the distant months are expected to weaken further. As a result, the current month fell 0.3% from the previous day, June-July fell 0.4%, August fell 0.2%, September fell 0.3%, and October fell 0.2%.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Customer Sen Rice Sales Stagnate and Prices Weaken <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Sen rice market saw another standstill. Because some buyers thought the prices were too high after the market rose the previous day, and because the river boats blocked by rain were all rushing to Shanghai yesterday due to clear weather, the market no longer focused on customer Sen rice. Therefore, the customer Sen rice market immediately saw stagnant sales and weakening prices. Throughout the day, only the street responded to Nanjing Ji Yuan rice for 190 bags at a price of 10 yuan and 4 jiao, and there were no other transactions.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Still Difficult to Turn Around</p>
<p>European and American markets were affected by the small price of Japanese silk, and the price of Chinese silk was difficult to increase. The telegram indicated weakness and stagnation. Yesterday, only Lan Le Bi and others entered Shanghai with 40 packages of white filature silk, and Da Chang and others entered with 15 packages of yellow filature silk, and prices were still flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Yu Hang Spring Silkworms All Suffer from Diarrhea <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The silkworm season in various towns and villages of Yu Hang this year is quite prosperous, but the weather is not right. Most of the early silkworms failed, and the amount of late silkworms raised is still not small. Although the weather was cold after the silkworms woke up, with continuous cloudy and rainy days, farmers worked diligently day and night, and losses were still small. However, during the major sleep, there was heavy rain for two days and nights, causing the silkworms to eat wet leaves and all have diarrhea with yellow water. In recent days, there has been continuous heavy rain, and the weather has become even colder, and the silkworms are all suffering from diarrhea and dying. This year's silkworm harvest is likely to be hopeless.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Qi Men Black Tea Has Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The local Xin He Chang Lane has received 53 boxes of new Qi Men black tea, and it is reported that hundreds of boxes will continue to arrive today. According to the tea merchant's opinion, it is necessary to wait for the large shipment from the Yangtze River to arrive in Shanghai before formally displaying the samples.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Few New Green Tea Transactions <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhen Mei green tea produced by the local earth house tea factory was still not selling well. Foreign companies, because the first batch of new goods has already been shipped for export in over 400 boxes yesterday, are not currently in urgent need, so they are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. Only Bao Chang Foreign Firm purchased over a hundred boxes in the city, and there are still no large transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e125">All Wu Yuan Tea Production Reports Losses <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The production volume of Wu Yi green tea is over 100,000 boxes annually, and it is the richest among the six tea-producing counties in Anhui Province. Among them, the production volume in the northern townships is the largest, followed by the eastern townships, and then the southwest. In the past, the new tea market started annually around the Beginning of Summer. Last year, the weather was earlier, but the mountain households still opened their gardens according to the season. Later, because they could not catch up with the harvest, there was mostly old grass, and buyers disliked the manufactured tea for being coarse and large, and no genuine goods could be taken, so they rejected it and did not purchase it. Therefore, many mountain households suffered from the disease of harvesting old grass late last year. No one asked, and there was nowhere to sell it, and the huge losses cannot be described in words. This year, each mountain household is afraid of repeating the same mistakes. Ten days before the Beginning of Summer, they have all chosen to pick early. According to the tea farmers in each village, each family's tea garden has been harvested and manufactured by half, and the quantity is less than six-tenths of previous years. The new tea produced by Shangbei Fengshan is similar to Mao Feng in its tenderness. The tea produced by Xiabei Longteng, Huangcun, and Jiacun does not need to be sifted and selected, and it is already like Fengmei. The tenderness of the shipment is rare since Wu Yi has tea. Therefore, each household estimates that the quantity of tea that has been harvested and has not been harvested has been reduced. Generally, it is necessary to discount 40%, and some have a sharp reduction in yield of 60%.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Fu Liang Later Batch Tea Prices Trend Downward <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Fu Yi's new tea, according to the reduced number of tea firms this year, the mountain price should have been lower than in the past. Unexpectedly, the Qi Men tea firms are numerous and raise prices to compete for purchases. Although Fu Yi wants to suppress prices, it is difficult. They have to reluctantly follow suit and make purchases with pain. Therefore, the highest new price for the first grade of black tea has been raised to 90 yuan, and the second grade must also be 70 yuan. Various tea firms are trending madly in this market. Those who are cautious mostly temporarily suspend weighing and stop making purchases. In recent days, mountain households have been willing to reduce prices for sales because the new tea is fleeting and the tea itself is deteriorating daily compared to previous prices. The market in recent days seems to have turned sharply downward. The mountain price for each dan of the second and third grade tea purchased by each firm has already fallen from 90 yuan to around 50 yuan and 40 yuan. In addition, bandits are wandering in the tea-producing areas to rob them, and tea firms from far and near are all vigilant and dare not store much cash in the firm. There are occasional cases of weighing and purchasing as soon as possible to avoid danger. If the weather is not clear in the next few days, the price of tea will still tend to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e127">De Xing Tea Production is Expected to Increase <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>De Xing's tea production has always been abundant. Its tea land is adjacent to the Wu boundary, and the quality and taste are quite superior. Each year's new tea, in addition to the needs of the local tea firms, is also purchased by many Wu Yuan firms in De Xing. Last year, about 50% of the whole county's tea leaves were not harvested due to banditry, and the rural economy and income were greatly reduced. This year, the new tea in the county has also developed early. Mountain households are forced by livelihood. Although the Communists appear and disappear without constant pattern, the income from the annual sideline industry is a major source, and they are unwilling to abandon the benefits to the land. As in previous years, they allowed the old trees to remain unharvested. In recent days, most of the high-altitude tea in the areas of Xie Chong and Nan Chong Quan Qi in the east of the county has been formally harvested, and the tea quality is also more tender than in the past. Even the low-altitude tea near Kaihua Wannian is also being harvested. If there is no disturbance within two weeks, the amount of new tea produced this year may increase compared to last year.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Price of Keemun Tea Is Unlikely to Fall <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The initial batches of Keemun's "First Character Mountain" grade tea have been eagerly sought after by various firms, pushing prices to unprecedented highs. As is customary, prices for "Second" and "Third Character" teas tend to decline, but in recent days, fluctuating weather conditions, with alternating sunshine and rain, have slowed deliveries from the mountain farmers. Supply has been unable to meet demand, making it difficult for prices to drop immediately. Over the past two days, the weather has been sunny and favorable for drying and picking, resulting in superior deliveries. Nevertheless, prices have remained steady at 90 to 60 yuan across various markets. Cautious firms, recognizing the high costs involved and the slim chances of profit, have temporarily suspended weighing and procurement to avoid further losses. Some cite a lack of cash flow, hindering their ability to purchase in large quantities.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Inland Merchants Gradually Begin Purchases</p>
<p>The piece goods trade showed signs of recovery yesterday, as inland merchants have been arriving in Shanghai in droves. Prices have stabilized, and the downward spiral of foreign yarn has ceased. Over a hundred deals were made for "Dian Qiu Xiang" fabric, indicating a potential shift from falling to rising prices. Sales of printed cotton fabrics have also been brisk, with "Shou Lao Qi Lu" selling for 3 candareens, 5 mace, 7 li and a half, "Jing An Si" for 2 candareens, 5 mace, 2 li and a half, and "Wo Long Gang" for 2 candareens, 5 mace, and a half. Inland merchants have been the most active buyers. Fine cloth is also gaining strength, with "Shi Le Niao" priced at 9 taels and 1 mace, and limited stock available. "Yue Yan" is priced at 9 taels and 9 mace. Printed cloth has been in high demand recently, with merchants from Qingdao and Hankou making consistent purchases, leading to a near exhaustion of supplies. "Shuang Tong Lu Chong" deep-patterned fabric sells for 5 taels, 3 mace and a half, and the new patterns of "Rong Hua Fu Gui" are mostly sold out. "Lun Chang" goods are also scarce in the market. Shanghai-dyed fabrics are more readily available, but prices are also quite high, exceeding 5 taels at the customs clearance. "Zhi Gong" woolen cloth, being out of season, experienced a price increase followed by a return to normal. Merchants from Hankou transported thirty to forty pieces of fine serge yesterday. The supply of "Zhi Gong" printed woolen cloth remains limited. "Qing Guan Jing" requires an asking price of 3 candareens and 8 mace and a half, while white crepe remains unchanged. Sales of imported cotton fabrics have been quite active, with blue-striped fabrics selling for around 3 candareens and 5 mace, and white-striped fabrics around 3 candareens and 4 mace.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Cheaper at Lower Grades</p>
<p>Sales of Sichuan pickled mustard tuber have remained sluggish across various regions, leading to a weak market, particularly for lower grades. The lowest grades are selling for as little as 23 yuan, while higher grades remain relatively stable, currently selling for 27 or 28 yuan. The abundance of lower-grade stock suggests the possibility of further price declines. However, considering the costs involved, all grades are currently operating at a loss, indicating that prices are unlikely to fall excessively.</p>

<h3 id="e132">International Chamber of Commerce Passes <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The International Silver Conference Proposal</p>
<p>Proposed by the Chinese Representative</p>
<p>Representative Pei Advocates China Convening</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the fifth International Chamber of Commerce Congress held in Washington, D.C., from the 4th of this month for five days, concluded on the 9th. The proposal submitted by the Chinese representatives, Pei Songsun and Li Guochin, to convene an international silver price conference, has been approved by the Congress. However, countries seemed to be yielding to each other on the issue of initiating the conference, and some expressed doubts about China's leadership capabilities. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency specifically inquired about opinions from the banking community in Shanghai on this matter. The consensus was that China, being deeply affected by the high gold and low silver prices, should be well understood by all countries. It is indeed commendable that our representatives were able to pass the proposal to convene an international silver conference at the Congress, and the efforts of our representatives are also conceivable. However, the comment about whether our country can assume leadership should be heeded by the entire nation.</p>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, Lin Kanghou, the standing committee member of the Bankers' Association, said that 46 countries participated in the International Chamber of Commerce to convene the meeting and there are only seven or eight countries directly related to the silver price issue, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan. All representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and India expressed their support for the proposal to discuss silver prices. However, since this issue is only a matter for a part of the countries of the International Chamber of Commerce, another meeting must be convened, only if the countries concerned negotiate thoroughly. Therefore, this International Chamber of Commerce meeting failed to thoroughly discuss it. Our country's representative Mr. Pei has already reported the matter to Shanghai and intends to convene the meeting by our country after the closing of the International Chamber of Commerce. The location is also in our country, because our country also has an organization of the International Chamber of Commerce branch. The banking sector in Shanghai expressed deep sympathy for the opinions of the representatives of Mr. Bei, etc., and intends to send a telegram to express their support and hope that it will be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e133">To Relieve the Suffering of Shipping Merchants <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Abolish the Inner Port Boat License and Yangtze River License</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association sent a letter to all member shipping companies yesterday, stating: "Regarding the case of domestic merchant ships sailing in the interior, there is a bad example of exchanging inner port licenses. This government decree is no different from self-binding, and shipping merchants have suffered for many years. The Association had previously submitted it to the National Transportation Conference and asked to abolish it. Although it was passed, it has not been implemented. Therefore, in March of this year, it was submitted to the Ministry of Communications to repeat the previous request, and then received instructions to consult the Ministry of Finance to cancel it, etc. After recording and printing the original submission and instructions, it was sent for inspection on April 3. Now, the Ministry of Communications instructs No. 699 to open, according to the request of the Association, and ordered to abolish the domestic merchant ships to receive the inner port special license, so as to facilitate shipping merchants, etc. It has been approved on April 3. Now, after consultation between the Ministry and the Ministry of Finance, in the future, domestic ships that have been given a ministry license can be exempted from giving boat licenses or river port special licenses and river licenses after going to the sea to open and inspect, so as to avoid complexity. In addition to amending the regulations on the registration and licensing of ships, it will be announced and implemented on the 2nd of this month, and it is hereby ordered to be informed. In view of this, the Association requested to abolish the inner port license, but now the boat license and Yangtze River license have been cancelled. The great intention of the Ministry to protect shipping merchants is more evident. The bondage and pain of decades have been lifted once and for all. In addition to waiting for the revised regulations on the registration and licensing of ships to be issued and delivered, it is hereby reported immediately, and I hope you will check it out."

<h3 id="e134">Jianghai Customs Announces New Rules for Cracking Down on Smuggling Taxes <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Strict Regulations</p>
<p>When merchant ships transport goods, some unscrupulous crew members smuggle small packages and the goods are not listed in the hatch list. Not only does the shipping company suffer losses in water feet, but the customs also suffers from the impact of tax evasion. Last month, the Shanghai-Ningbo route had repeatedly cracked down on smuggling of large amounts of passenger and cargo goods, and one time found as many as thirteen barges. The local Jianghai Customs, in order to strictly prevent tax evasion, has specially formulated strict new rules and has been promulgated. For imported goods, the shipowners are responsible for reporting the hatch list. If there are any unlisted goods, they will be fined. The Jianghai Customs announced the strict new rules for preventing tax evasion, and selected important records: (1) Any merchant ship entering Chinese territorial waters or sailing in Chinese territorial waters shall have a hatch list signed by the shipowner, detailing the goods loaded, and submit it to the customs officer for inspection at any time. If it is found that there is no hatch list, the shipowner shall be fined no more than 500 taels of customs silver. (2) The hatch list shall contain the name, nationality, shipowner's name and the number of goods, as well as the number, mark and packaging style of each piece of goods. (3) The designated port of shipment and unloading. (4) Omitted (5) The goods carried on board (including transit goods), if there are any discrepancies with those not listed in the hatch list or listed in the list, the shipowner shall go to the customs within 24 hours after customs clearance to request correction, but only if the error is due to inadvertence or clerical error. However, goods not listed in the hatch list shall not be requested to be corrected if they have already been found by the customs. (6) If any goods not listed in the hatch list are found by the customs officers, the shipowner and the owner of the goods shall each be fined no more than 1,000 taels of customs silver, and the goods shall be confiscated. If the goods not listed in the manifest are hidden in a special way, and the customs officers find that the shipowner has done his duty, carefully supervised, and did not know the hiding of private goods, the penalty may be reduced. If there are several packages of goods packed in one piece, and the words "several packages packed together" are not noted, it shall be deemed as not listed in the hatch list. (7) If goods listed in the hatch list are found by the customs not to be among the goods carried on the ship, and the shipowner cannot point out and provide solid evidence that the missing goods were loaded at the original port of departure or unloaded in transit, the shipowner shall be fined no more than 500 taels of customs silver for each piece of goods. (8) Any merchant ship exporting without the permission of the customs shall be fined 1,000 taels of customs silver. (9) Warships, yachts and river-leading ships are not managed by these rules.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Third Prevention Meeting</p>
<p>June 6 Parade and Publicity</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Scouts Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cholera Prevention Campaign Committee held its third meeting at the Seaport Quarantine Station at 5:15 pm yesterday. Attendees included Bi Dehui of the Ministry of Health, De Ge of the Public Concession Health Department, Pu Bi of the French Concession Health Department, Yang Tingyao of the Seaport Quarantine Station, Shen Hao and Wu Liguo of the Municipal Health Bureau, Wang Gang and Ni Jiasheng of the Boy Scout Corps, and Mi Lindeng. The main points of the discussion were to expand cholera prevention publicity and actively implement prevention work. However, given the vastness of Shanghai, it was decided to divide the work and cooperate, and to convene a meeting once a week thereafter to report on the progress of the work. The scope of the work includes: (1) producing and printing cholera prevention slogans, flags, and all publicity materials; (2) establishing inoculation stations in various districts of Shanghai and setting up necessary equipment; (3) formulating rules for implementing the work, and setting June 6 from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm as the grand parade for cholera prevention publicity, with Wang Gang designated as the general commander of the Chinese and foreign boy scouts. The route of the parade will be drawn and printed by the Municipal Health Bureau and distributed to all sectors. It is also heard that the parade area in the Chinese and Concession regions is planned to depart from the Chinese Road of Ximen, passing through Caishi Road, Mintiniyin Road, Aiduya Road, Minguo Road, Aiduya Road, Henan Road, Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, and North Sichuan Road, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Lin Kanghou's Views on Recovering the Kailuan Mines <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, someone met with Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, and asked about the Kailuan Mines recovery case. Public clamor is very high at the moment. In the end, are there any concrete measures from all parties, and can it become a reality, etc. According to Lin's personal observation, this issue is extremely complicated and does not seem to be resolved in a short time. It is especially inappropriate to discuss it together with the current dispute between Kailuan and the Railway Bureau. Mr. Lin's intention is that in the past, many Chinese people thought that the use of foreign capital was harmful to the country. However, based on the facts, it does not seem to be the case. Taking the two organizations involved in the dispute this time as an example, the Beining Road was also built with foreign investment, with an annual interest rate of 5%, and an annual surplus of several million yuan. Kailuan Mine produced more than 5.5 million tons of coal last year, and the total selling price should be around 60 million yuan. However, the shareholders of Kaiping, many of whom are Chinese, received only more than 3 million yuan. In addition to being used for purchasing materials and machinery, and paying foreign salaries, the rest of the money is obtained by Chinese people. More than 40,000 workers rely on the mine for a living, and their monthly wages should be more than one million, which is also an important issue for the livelihood of workers. Nowadays, countries all over the world invest in each other's industries. If our country wants to revitalize its industry without foreign capital, it may not be easy to have large-scale development in a short period of time. Recently, Deputy Commander Zhang sent Zou Zuohua, the Commissioner for Xing'an Reclamation, to go abroad to raise foreign capital to develop the resources of Northeast China, which is the intention. I previously met with Lu Qisheng, the standing committee member of the Coal Industry Association, and talked about recovering the Kailuan Coal Mine. He said that people in the association are actively proceeding and intend to petition the authorities to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds to borrow cash from banks at a 70% discount. Fellow traders only need to raise 3 million yuan in cash to prepare for the recovery. I extremely agree with the recovery of the mine, but the recovery procedure may not be so simple. According to reports, the redemption price is 70 million yuan or 100 million yuan. Regardless of the amount of money needed, it will definitely not be resolved in a short time. At present, Kailuan coal cannot be transported south, and factories that need it everywhere will inevitably suffer. In short, recovery and suspension of operations are absolutely two separate matters, and those who talk about recovery now seem to be aimed at prolonging the suspension of operations, and the losses of general users and industry have not been taken into account at all. The output of mines that are completely Chinese-owned is limited, and transportation is also difficult. After Kailuan is shut down, its sales will definitely not be compensated by mines run by Chinese people. Those who replace it are being taken over by others. This should be paid attention to by Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Lu Feibo's Reply to the Coal Industry Association <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Lu Feibo's reply to the Shanghai Coal Industry Association says: "Regarding the letter of May 10, I am very grateful for the instructions. I have little research on the coal industry. Recently, because the price of coal used in my factory and residence is high and of poor quality, and all factories have this pain, I inquired from all parties. The conversation recorded in Shen Bao on May 8 was an impromptu answer. There are bound to be some discrepancies in the words between the consecutive records. I only want to open up the transportation as soon as possible to avoid increasing the price and sales of Dong coal. Other points are just general discussions. The two points of the dispute between Beining Road and Kailuan Mine were heard from friends coming from the north. As for the Kaiping recovery level, the answer to the question "How do the British oppose?" was "According to the treaty, the recovery seems unlikely that the British will oppose," and it does not mean that there is no fact that the British oppose it. Regarding the question "How much money is needed?", the answer was "I don't know, but according to the Beijing-Tianjin Times, it is 70 million yuan, even if the gold is expensive now, it is at most 100 million yuan," meaning that no matter what, it should be recovered. As for the two points of being able to recover without compensation and compensation for damages, I had not thought of it before. I agree very much with the instructions now. It seems that we can claim it now, so that Kailuan Mine can become completely domestic as soon as possible. If, as you intend, we wait for China to become strong before recovering Kaiping Mine, it will be too late. I hope you will investigate the files, study the legal principles, and urge the government to proceed as soon as possible. I have no relationship with British businessmen, nor with Japanese coal. I only want factories to get coal of good quality and low price, and that the interests and rights will not overflow. I don't know what else." (Below omitted)</p>

<p>Wang Ying Replies to Zhang Shouyong by Telegram</p>
<p>The Ningbo County Government levies a 5% stone tax and authorizes contractors to set up tax stations in Shanghai and Xiajiang to collect taxes, and post signs such as "Strictly investigate smuggling and prohibit bypassing," which has aroused opposition from the local people. Zhang Shouyong (from Ningbo County), Vice Minister of Finance, recently sent a telegram to Zhejiang Province requesting that the tax be abolished and the county magistrate be punished. The original telegram has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that Wang Chengying, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, replied to Zhang's telegram, "Respected Vice Minister Zhang, the Qing telegram has been received, and the Construction Department has been consulted and ordered the county to abolish it immediately. I reply respectfully, Wang Chengying sends greetings." It is heard that Ningbo County has gone on strike for a month in opposition to the stone tax, and more than 4,000 people have lost their jobs. Now, with Zhang's telegram to save the situation, the huge wave will subside.</p>

<p>Sends Telegram to Zhejiang Authorities</p>
<p>The Huashang Shanghai Cement Company sent a telegram to Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Director Wang of the Finance Department, and Director Shi of the Construction Department, stating, "After the Central Government clearly ordered the abolition of the likin tax, the Changxing County Government continued to levy the stone tax. The Company previously submitted it to the Ministry of Finance and your government, requesting the abolition of the tax to comply with the government decree. The Ministry approved it, stating that it has been instructed to the Zhejiang Finance Department to investigate and abolish it on a deadline. The original text of the instructions has been copied and sent for your information. However, according to a report from the Changxing Quarry of the Company, the County Government has not only delayed in abolishing the stone tax, which is a tax similar to the likin tax that is levied on goods and contracted by merchants, but also issued arrest warrants on Yangri, dispatched police to arrest the manager, and pressed for the tax payment. This kind of illegal extortion should be strictly stopped by your Excellency, and please order that the stone tax be abolished immediately to protect human rights and comply with the legal system. The telegram is very urgent and awaiting orders."</p>

<h3 id="e144">Finance Bureau Takes Over Slaughter Tax <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Drafts Three Suggestions for Mediation</p>
<p>Pigs are Allowed to be Released on Credit After Slaughter</p>
<p>The Meat Industry Discusses Follow-up Measures Today</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry was taken over by the Finance Bureau to receive the slaughter tax of Shangbao II counties and began to levy it on May 1. Fresh pigs must be counted and charged after slaughter, which led to shipping disputes. The industry petitioned the City Chamber of Commerce to mediate, and the City Chamber of Commerce drafted opinions: (1) The tax from the 1st to the 15th of this month, within half a month, will be paid uniformly when the entire case is resolved in the future, and the Chamber of Commerce will be responsible for it. (2) The fresh pigs slaughtered within the period up to the 15th of this month shall be counted temporarily and allowed to pass unhindered without detention. (3) The City Chamber of Commerce will convene the industry before the 15th to properly plan measures and consult with the Finance Bureau for resolution. As for the pigs that have been slaughtered and detained, they should all be released first to avoid spoilage. The above three items have been sent to the Finance Bureau by the Association. According to the staff of the Finance Bureau, the two counties of Shangbao have been incorporated into the urban area, and the slaughter tax is approved by the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office to be transferred to the city for management, and funds are allocated monthly to subsidize education expenses. The Bureau followed the instructions of the Municipal Government and issued tax tickets on May 1 and implemented the levy, still according to the old tax rate. Each pig is taxed at 39 cents, and each sheep is taxed at 20 cents. It is not a new tax, and it does not increase any burden on meat merchants. In addition, direct collection is the principle of sorting out taxes, but after repeated persuasion, all meat merchants use the excuse of waiting for the association to resolve the matter, and do not buy tax tickets. I don't know what the intention is. In order to implement the laws and regulations, the Bureau sent personnel to the slaughterhouse on the 9th to carry tax tickets to persuade them to purchase on the spot, so that they could count the number of animals and cut corners to facilitate them. However, they still did not comply, so they checked the regulations and did not allow the slaughtered pigs to leave the factory. Now that the tax has been taken over by the City Chamber of Commerce, the tax collection offices have been instructed to temporarily count the number of animals and allow the pigs to be released, and the City Chamber of Commerce has been informed to convene a meeting to give detailed instructions and order them to purchase slaughter tax tickets and wait for inspection from May 16. The tax for the first half of the month should be paid as soon as possible. If they fail to comply after the deadline, they will still be dealt with according to the regulations. It is heard that the meat industry will convene a general meeting at 3:00 pm today to discuss follow-up measures for the slaughter tax.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Egg Industry Associations Telegraph Request to Reduce Tax Rates <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Industry Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "We have recently read in the Shen Bao the new export tax rates issued by your ministry. Dried eggs are taxed at 4.5 taels per dan for export, and wet eggs at 1.5 taels per dan. The original tax rate was 1.5 taels per dan for dried eggs, plus a surtax of 7.5 fen, totaling no more than 2.25 taels. Wet eggs were taxed at 2.25 li per dan, plus a surtax of 1.125 fen, totaling no more than 3.375 fen. Now, the surtax has been eliminated, but the basic tax has increased by three to four times, which is alarming. According to the recent selling prices of various egg products, egg white is 100 taels per dan (equivalent to only 90 taels on the customs scale, including customs duties; the following is similar), dried yolk is 55 taels, machine-made dried yolk (commonly known as "flying yolk") is 60 taels, dried egg powder (containing both yolk and white) is 70 taels, machine-made dried egg powder is 75 taels, and wet yolk is 23 taels. Among these, machine-made dried yolk and machine-made dried egg powder should be exempted from taxation according to the general practice for exporting machine-made products. All other products are cooked goods and should not be treated the same as raw goods such as fresh eggs and frozen eggs. At a time when the government is promoting foreign trade and encouraging the export of cooked goods, it should also specifically reduce taxes to protect domestic industries. However, the reality is the opposite. Comparing the selling prices of various goods with the new tax rates, the tax burden is almost 10% of the value, which is unbearable for businesses with already meager profits. The annual export volume of egg yolk and white in our country is no less than that of silk and tea, and the difficulties in operating the business are even greater than those of the silk and tea industries. Recently, it has also been affected by the United States' increasing import tariffs, and the future of the business is precarious. If we do not receive the government's consideration and support, we fear that this fledgling industry, even if it tries hard to maintain itself, will be on the verge of extinction. The association has carefully examined the situation and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we urgently request your excellency to promptly revise the tax rates, reduce or exempt them separately, and provide a written reply for compliance. This would be a virtuous and convenient measure."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Relief from Difficulties in Various Industries <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Bureau of Social Affairs for transmittal to the Ministry of Industry, stating that it was replying to an official matter. On February 27th, the bureau issued Instruction No. 7044, based on Instruction No. 1215 from the Ministry of Industry, instructing the chamber to investigate the recent facts and difficulties of various industries and methods of relief, in accordance with the resolutions of the proposals by Xu Peihuang and Wu Jian at the industrial and commercial conference. The chamber was instructed to avoid empty talk and biases and to compile a report. The chamber then sent letters to various industries to investigate and reply. Now, regarding the replies received from various industries, we have selected those that avoid empty talk and biases and listed them as follows: (1) Flour mills request two items: (A) The special tax subsidy should be increased. The cost of setting up factories in Shanghai is particularly high, and the wages are very large. The wheat needed is transported to Shanghai from other ports, which is expensive and results in significant losses. Therefore, the cost is more expensive than in the inland. Even if the special tax subsidy cannot be raised compared to inland flour mills, it should be the same as inland flour mills. (B) Heavy tariffs should be imposed on imported flour, and Chinese flour should be completely exempt from export tariffs. The price of imported flour from the Americas and Australia is two or three qian lower per bag than Chinese flour and is sold well in Shenyang, Tianjin, and major ports in Southeast Asia. Chinese flour has almost no place to compete. Imported flour has no tariffs and only a special tax of one jiao per bag. It is urgent to consider imposing import tariffs or anti-dumping duties to resist it. As for Chinese flour exported overseas, the special tax was previously reduced by five fen, but now it is taxed at one jiao, which hinders development. It should be exempted to reduce costs and protect it. (2) The brick and tile industry requests one item: (C) Prohibit "bailala" brick and tile brokers from obtaining licenses and paying taxes to be able to open businesses. Brick and tile shops have various expenses, including partners' salaries, and the commissions earned are limited. However, cunning individuals cleverly establish "bailala" broker names to solicit business. These people do not obtain licenses and do not need to rent houses or hire partners. Therefore, although the construction industry in Shanghai has been flourishing in recent years, the brick and tile industry has not been doing well and has been closing down one after another, which is due to the influence of "bailala". It should be requested that the Public Security Bureau issue a strict prohibition order, and that the water and land police teams be instructed to send "bailala" brokers to be investigated according to law. At the same time, the association should be allowed to report and assist in identifying them at any time, which would benefit both national taxes and commerce. (3) The coal industry requests two items: (D) Request the National Government to order the entire country not to prohibit people from setting off firecrackers during non-martial law periods. Recently, public security bureaus in various places have been prohibiting the setting off of firecrackers for no reason, which would completely eliminate the industry. It is proposed to change this to non-martial law periods, which are not subject to the prohibition, in order to maintain it. (E) Abolish the saltpeter and sulfur trading system and allow the industry to apply for passports to purchase them. Since the establishment of the saltpeter and sulfur bureau, the prices of public sales have been repeatedly raised, and the cost is increasing day by day, which hinders the sales of the industry. It is not enough to save it unless licenses are obtained for self-purchase. The above are the circumstances of the various industries' requests for relief from difficulties. We have summarized them for your bureau's review. It would be a great convenience to transmit the report.</p>

<p>All Trains Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The Engineering Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has found that the steel rail sleepers laid between Fengjing and Shihu Dang (approximately twenty li) have been in disrepair for many years and are inevitably rotten. In order to ensure the safety of train operations, all steel rail wood in the area will be replaced. Work is scheduled to begin at 4:30 AM this morning and end at 8:30 AM. During this repair work, there is a risk of train accidents. Therefore, all stations were notified yesterday that the No. 405 freight train departing from the Zhabei station should stop at Fengjing and pass through at 8:30 AM. Other unscheduled inbound trains should also be detained at Fengjing to avoid danger. Please be informed.</p>

<p>Planning Shanghai-Chongqing and Shanghai-Guangdong Routes</p>
<p>Reduced Postage Rates for Beijing-Ping Line</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation has recently expanded its business and developed air routes to complete its original national route plan. It has decided to launch direct flights between Shanghai and Chongqing in mid-July and between Shanghai and Guangdong in early August, carrying only mail. Effective immediately, postage rates for Beijing-Ping airmail will be uniformly set at 15 cents for items within 20 centimeters. The news received yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Beijing-Ping Line Postage Rates: The Beijing-Ping Line has been operating every morning (except for one day of suspension per week) for almost a month. The company is currently focusing on postal transport. In one or two months, it plans to add passenger transport. Mail transported on the Beijing-Ping Line is carried by the Shanghai-Yichang direct flight to Nanjing Ming Palace every morning, where it is unloaded and transferred to the Beijing-Ping flight for transport to various stations along the line. Tianjin mail is transported to Beijing by the Beijing-Pukou Railway on the same day and then delivered to various stations the next morning. However, the flights between the two lines (Beijing-Ping and Hankou-Yichang) are sometimes delayed due to bad weather. Each station is notified by radio and takes off after a short delay. Therefore, Shanghai flights sometimes fail to arrive in Beijing in time to hand over mail to the Beijing-Ping flight, which then takes off north. Currently, in order to achieve speed, the company will transport mail from Shanghai to the Beijing-Ping line to the capital by the Beijing-Ping day and night express train, and then transfer it to the northbound flight to Beijing and Tianjin. Tianjin mail will be transported to Tianjin by the Beijing-Pukou train on the same day, eliminating any delays. According to the company's original plan, postage for mail over 1,000 kilometers was 3 jiao per 20 centimeters. The company has now agreed with the postal authorities that, effective immediately, postage for all stations on the Beijing-Ping line will be uniformly set at 15 jiao, regardless of distance.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Chongqing Line Planning: The direct Shanghai-Chongqing line, which is being planned, will be launched in mid-July. The aircraft ordered from the United States will arrive in Shanghai in a month. Airports in Wanxian and Chongqing have been surveyed and appropriate locations have been determined. Radio equipment will soon be transported for installation.</p>
<p>Continuing to Establish Shanghai-Guangdong Line: The company plans to launch the Shanghai-Guangdong line in early August. In the future, it will fly along the coast, taking off from Shanghai and passing through Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and other stations before flying to Guangzhou. Floating pontoons will be placed along the coast for aircraft to stop and land. The company also telegraphed the American Sikorsky Aircraft Manufacturing Company to purchase two more seaplanes in order to achieve the goal of launching flights to all stations in the plan on schedule, which will depend on the environment.</p>
<p>Tianjin Station Awaiting Survey: The French barracks near the Tianjin East Bureau's aircraft station is obstructing operations, and aircraft cannot land. However, negotiations are underway, as it is the responsibility of the diplomatic sector. The company is an operating agency. Negotiation is one thing, and station establishment and flight operation are another. Therefore, it has been decided to entrust the Tianjin office to find a better location to build the Tianjin station, which will benefit airmail transport.</p>

<p>The National Products Maintenance Association Telegraphs a Request to the National Government and Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association sent a communication to the National Government Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Culture, stating: "Respectfully submitted, on April 6th, we sent a special telegram requesting measures to prevent foreigners from establishing factories in China. We believe this matter is of great importance and requires the convening of all Shanghai national product industry and commerce circles to conduct a thorough discussion, gather opinions, and jointly vote to contribute to the government's request for adoption and implementation. Therefore, on the 20th of last month, we convened the All Shanghai National Products Industry and Commerce Representative Assembly. After detailed discussions by the representatives, the following six points were resolved: (1) Request the National Government to promptly formulate special regulations for the registration of foreigners establishing factories in China. For foreign factories that have already been established, in addition to ordering them to register according to law, heavy taxes should be levied on their products, business taxes, and anti-dumping duties. (2) Request the Ministry of Industry to effectively implement the National Products Encouragement Law and provide strong support for its development. (3) Request the Ministry of Finance to reduce or exempt taxes on national products to ease their burden. (4) Request the National Government Central Party Headquarters to instruct party and government officials at all levels to use national products and intensify the promotion of national products. (5) Request the Ministry of Industry to instruct administrative officials at all trading ports to strictly prohibit foreigners from secretly transporting workers from their countries to China to work, so as to avoid seizing the livelihoods of Chinese workers, especially paying attention to Russia and Japan. (6) Request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the governments of all countries to instruct their merchants to mark the nationality, factory name, and location on their products; otherwise, once discovered, they will be confiscated or heavily fined. The above points are currently the most urgent and necessary measures. We request the government to adopt and implement them to consolidate people's livelihoods and protect national rights. Recorded in the minutes, in addition to gathering various groups to work together, promote public awareness, encourage compatriots to love national products, and reject foreign goods, we should follow the resolution and respectfully submit the report. We earnestly request that you review and approve the implementation. We are anxiously awaiting your command, and we respectfully await your instructions. This would be a virtuous and convenient measure. Standing Committee Members of the China National Products Maintenance Association, Wang Jie'an, Wang Moyi, and Wang Hanqi, bow in truth."</p>

<h3 id="e153">Sudden Wealth Creates Trouble <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Poor Friends Agree to Extort</p>
<p>Problems Indeed Arise</p>
<p>Confiscated Jewelry and Large Sums of Money</p>
<p>Seemingly Related to Gold Bar Robbery</p>
<p>Wang Lanlin, who had carried gold bars worth over 5,000 yuan, was robbed at the Jardine Wharf in Yangshupu on October 23rd of last winter. Half a year has passed, but the case has not yet been solved. Recently, Wang Hanqing, a native of Henan residing at No. 177 Miller Road, suddenly became rich. Ma Wenliang, a watchman at the Baoxing Silver Shop on East-West Huade Road, a fellow villager and longtime acquaintance of Wang, as well as Zhu Mutang from Tianjin and Zhou Deju from Shandong, all suspected that his wealth was not obtained legitimately. They all believed that it would be fine to extort from this kind of ill-gotten wealth. If he was willing to share the spoils, they would mutually conceal it; otherwise, they would rather perish together. On the 18th of last month, they gathered Wang Jinpeng and went to Wang's house to demand 300 yuan. Wang's wife, Zhang, refused to give them a single penny, which led to an argument. At that time, Wang's brother, Fuyou, his sister-in-law, Yang, and his son, Cuibao, all quarreled with them. Wang immediately reported to the Hongkou police station, and detectives Yang Zhaoqing and Liu Yongxiang rushed to investigate and arrest them. Ma and Wang Jinpeng had already fled. Only Zhu and Zhou were caught, and they confessed the details of the extortion. The detectives then re-entered Wang's house and, as expected, found 550 yuan in cash and a draft for 7,000 yuan in the pockets, waists, and shoes of the two women, Zhang and Yang, and Cuibao. In addition, they found 16 pieces of jewelry, including gold bracelets, gold necklaces, and gold rings. Wang and his brothers, their wives, and their son, a family of five, were all arrested. They then went to the Baoxing Silver Shop and arrested Ma. Wang Jinpeng was not arrested until the day before yesterday in a house at No. 498 Guangdong Road. Yesterday morning, they were taken to the Special District Local Court for investigation. The police lawyer stated that the gold bar robbery case still needed to be investigated and requested a postponement of the hearing. Wang Jinpeng then confessed that Ma Wenliang and Wang Hanqing were fellow villagers, and Ma knew that Wang had robbed a large amount of wealth, so he invited everyone to extort 300 yuan from Wang. Judge Feng subsequently ordered the defendants to be detained separately pending further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Rickshaw Boat Registration Disturbance in Wusong <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Conflict Caused by Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Assault Caused by Conflict</p>
<p>Eighteen North Sea dried fish boats arrived in Wusong yesterday morning, sixteen of which were sold by the Cui Sheng Fish Company and two by the Baofeng Fish Company. As these fish boats were arriving in Wusong for the first time, they had not gone through registration procedures. The patrol boat of the Bureau of Public Utilities' Ship Affairs Office went to the river in the morning and summoned the boatmen (one person per boat) to the bureau. They were detained until after noon, around 12:00 PM, without being released. The fish boats all contacted Cui Sheng for negotiation. The company sent representatives, along with Jiang Rusong, the owner of the Xietai tax reporting agency, to the bureau to discuss having the fish company pay the registration fee (3 yuan per boat, plus a daily donation of 2.16 yuan) and monthly donation. The bureau refused and insisted that, according to the regulations, each boat had to send one boatman to the bureau to inquire about the boat's name, pay the donation, and then be issued a license plate and a lamp before the boatmen would be released. However, this procedure took a long time, so the boatmen believed that they were being deliberately detained, which caused great dissatisfaction. Unexpectedly, Director Yang of the bureau went to the boats a second time in the afternoon and summoned the boatmen. At that time, the boatmen thought that the boat donation had already been paid by the fish company, so why were they being arrested again? The misunderstanding arose from this, and because the boats were eager to open their holds and sell fish, a conflict broke out, resulting in violence. Director Yang, seeing that the situation was not good, swam away and rushed to the 4th Water Patrol Division, ordering the police to arrest them immediately. The water patrols saw that the boatmen were not on the boats, so they rushed to the Cui Sheng Fish Company and arrested the injured boatmen Wang Jinyu, Lü Wanzhi, Lü Wanmao, and Lü Wancheng, causing great injustice to all the boatmen and all the fish merchants in Wusong Town. They all wanted to go to the bureau to question them. After Zheng Shushan, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, learned of the matter, he feared that it would lead to a town-wide fish merchant strike. He went to the 4th Water Patrol Division to bail out the four injured boatmen and sent them to the Seaside Public Hospital for treatment. He also discussed a proper solution with Director Yang, and the strike was averted. Mediation is currently underway.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Compiles Report on the Order of Household Registration Changes <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that most citizens still have a rudimentary understanding of household registration change reports. Therefore, it has recently compiled an illustrated explanation that is distributed to households and posted in various places. The diagram shows the following: (1) Report within three days of birth. (2) Report on the day of death. After receiving the report, the precinct will issue a coffin transport certificate, burial certificate, and permit. After burial, the burial permit must be submitted. (3) Report three days before moving out. After receiving the report, the precinct will issue a move-out certificate. (4) Report within three days of moving in. (5) Report on the day of adoption. (6) Report three days before moving (within the city). After receiving the report, the precinct will issue a move certificate. After moving, the move certificate must be submitted. (7) Report within three days of inheritance. (8) Report three days before marriage. After receiving the report, the precinct will issue a marriage certificate. After marriage, the marriage certificate must be submitted. In addition to the above eight items, there are three items that must be reported based on the situation in this city, which are recorded on the left: (A) Visitors: If relatives and friends of residents come from outside the city or family members and friends go out and stay temporarily, if they leave Shanghai or return to Shanghai within three days, they can be exempted from reporting. If it is more than three days, they must explain the reason and submit a written report. (B) Separation: If a father, son, uncle, nephew, brother, or sibling of a resident divides the family, regardless of whether they live in the same household or move to another household, they must report three days in advance. If they live within the jurisdiction of the city, they must also report to the new precinct three days after moving, surrender the move certificate, and exchange it for an investigation certificate. (C) Missing: If a family member or employee of a resident leaves home and their whereabouts are unknown, they must report within three days. If a citizen commits one of the above-mentioned circumstances and does not report it, once discovered, they will be subject to detention for up to ten days or a fine of up to ten yuan. If they refuse to be investigated during a spot check or intentionally make a false report, they will be subject to a fine of one yuan or more and five yuan or less. If they obstruct the Public Security Bureau's investigation, they will be subject to detention for five days or more and one month or less, or a fine of five yuan or more and thirty yuan or less. However, the punishment for this obstructing behavior will be decided by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. All other matters will be enforced by the chief of the police district.</p>
<h3 id="e156">More Rickshaws in the City <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Registered Number… 3,565 Vehicles</p>
<p>Subtracting the Actual Number… 1,477 Vehicles</p>
<p>The original number of rickshaws (commonly known as "yellow bags") operating in the city, including Shanghai South and Zhabei, was 4,500 in Shanghai South and 2,900 in Zhabei, totaling 7,400. Previously, due to citizens' requests for an increase in the number of vehicles, the Municipal Government approved an expansion to 10,000 vehicles, excluding special zones. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Bureau of Finance discussed reserving 1,000 vehicles for Pudong and 200 vehicles for Wusong and the three-wheeled rickshaws that should be eliminated, with 1,400 vehicles being the actual number to be increased. Registration began on April 11 and ended on April 25. As a result, a total of 488 households registered 3,565 vehicles, exceeding the quota of 1,400 vehicles by 2,165 vehicles. The Municipal Government then sent personnel to review and reduce the number of vehicles along with the two bureaus of public utilities and finance. The regulations are as follows: (1) Households registering one or two vehicles will not be reduced. (2) Households registering three to ten vehicles will each be calculated at one-half, and households with a remainder of one vehicle after the reduction will also be calculated as two vehicles. For example, three vehicles will be calculated as two vehicles, and seven vehicles will be calculated as four vehicles. (3) Households registering eleven to twenty vehicles will each be calculated at one-third, and households with a remainder of two vehicles after the reduction will also be calculated as three vehicles. For example, eleven vehicles will be calculated as four vehicles, and fourteen vehicles will be calculated as five vehicles. (4) Households registering twenty-one to two hundred vehicles will each be calculated at one-fourth, and households with a remainder of two or three vehicles after the reduction will also be calculated as four vehicles. For example, twenty-two vehicles will be calculated as six vehicles, and thirty-four vehicles will be calculated as nine vehicles. According to the above methods, the actual number of vehicles reduced is 1,477, still exceeding the quota by 77 vehicles, which will be made up from the 1,000 vehicles reserved for Pudong. The two bureaus have jointly announced to the registered vehicle dealers that, starting from May 20, they should go to the Bureau of Public Utilities to obtain permits according to the number of vehicles they are entitled to, and manufacture the vehicles and report them for inspection in accordance with the regulations. The guarantee deposits for the number of vehicles reduced can be returned to the Bureau of Finance with the receipts previously issued.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Rickshaws in the French Concession <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Association Requests Improvement of Donation Certificates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "According to a report from member Li Chunhe, the donation certificates issued by the French Municipal Council are not durable. Often, before the end of the month, the paper and the lead sheet separate, leaving a torn and incomplete certificate. Even if the paper is eroded by wind and rain and nothing is left, the license number can be checked on the aluminum sheet. However, most patrolling constables, knowing this is the case, deliberately 'check' and, seeing the above situation, immediately detain them, accusing them of 'smuggling' or 'stealing'. Foreigners, unaware of the facts, fine them at least five yuan or detain them at the police station. Even if they pay the donation for a new certificate, they are still punished. Such heavy treatment disregards right and wrong and disregards the difficulties of merchants. We request that you negotiate on reasonable grounds.' The association believes that donation certificates are valid for one month, and if the certificate loses its effectiveness within one month due to circumstances beyond one's control, the party responsible for the donation should find a way to remedy it. In any case, the donor is already unfortunate and should not be made to suffer any further losses. This is only reasonable. There are three types of rickshaw licenses in this city: Chinese, British, and French. The French license has the worst pasting quality. Before the expiration of the term, it wrinkles, tears, and becomes unrecognizable. Rickshaw merchants have repeatedly requested improvements, but they remain corrupt and the abuses continue. Foreigners blindly listen to the police's one-sided account and arbitrarily interfere, while the police fan the flames and take the opportunity to show their diligence and merit. Our rickshaw industry has dared to be angry but not to speak for a long time. Now that we have received this report, we respectfully request your association to forward it to the French authorities, requesting that they promptly improve the pasting process of rickshaw licenses for business purposes and, before a practical improvement is made, stop the illegal treatment of impounding vehicles and fining them in order to satisfy public opinion and relieve merchants' difficulties. We are eagerly awaiting your command."</p>

<p>Deng Yulin, a chef from Xiang in a certain school on Hongqiao Road, rode his bicycle to the market early in the morning the day before yesterday to buy vegetables. While passing Haig Road, he raced another cyclist. As the bike was turning a corner, Deng suddenly fell to the ground. He barely opened his mouth to gasp, without saying a word, before his eyes closed and he passed away. The other cyclist left without looking back. Chen Xiaoer, a poor man who was collecting coal cinders by the roadside, saw Deng collapse and die. Unable to bear it, he went to report to the nearby constable. After inspecting the scene, the constable returned to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and reported to the head constable, who sent a detective to transport the body to the Fielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Qian, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, was commissioned to inspect the body. The deceased's wife, Mrs. Li, arrived and stated that her husband was thirty-five years old this year and had no previous illnesses.

<p>Hu Guoguang, the owner of the China Battery Factory, represented by lawyers Jin Yu and Li Yuan, stated in the French court that the "53 Brand" dry battery produced by the plaintiff's factory is made of starch and has been registered with the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce for a five-year patent, which can be proven. Unexpectedly, the defendant, Ding Xiong Zhao He Cai and others in the battery factory set up inside counterfeited the plaintiff's brand. After the plaintiff's testing, the defendant also used starch in manufacturing, which is a deliberate imitation, causing a great impact on the plaintiff's business. The defendant violated the Trademark Law, requesting investigation and, in addition, granting incidental private prosecution to recover losses of 10,000 yuan. The defendants were also represented by lawyers who argued that the electrical materials produced in the defendant's factory are different from the plaintiff's trade name and trademark. The defendant's electrical materials are presented for inspection. As for the manufacturing method, the plaintiff uses starch, while the defendant uses gluten juice. The plaintiff's accusations have no evidence and should be dismissed. Judge Zhu ruled a deadline of fourteen days for the plaintiff to produce conclusive evidence for further verification.</p>

He has two married sons. His second daughter-in-law, Mrs. Su, is only in her early twenties and still quite beautiful. Because there was a lack of care on the boat, Huang, since this year, took his second daughter-in-law Su to the boat to take care of it, because his two sons were working outside. At the beginning of the third month of this year in the lunar calendar, when the boat was docked in the Suzhou River outside the Waitanyuan Bridge, Wu A'si and Tang Jinfang from another small gasoline boat met and became acquainted, because the boats were docked side by side and they passed each other from morning till night. On the eighth day, Huang took his wife to the hospital to see a doctor. When he returned to the boat, he suddenly found the boat empty. His second daughter-in-law, Mrs. Su, was missing. The small gasoline boat parked next to it had also sailed away. Huang then inquired from the neighboring boats and learned that Tang Jinfang had sailed away first, and Wu A'si had enticed Ms. Su to go with him. Huang then searched everywhere, but found no trace. It wasn't until 11:00 AM yesterday that Huang spotted Wu and Tang hiding in the boat along the Suzhou River in front of the Zhaofeng Garden in the West Shanghai. He got off the boat and dragged them to the shore, calling the police back to the Sixth District Police Station. After the District Chief's separate preliminary hearing, Huang He Da testified, 48 years old, from Changzhou, the rest of the statement as above, and Wu A'si testified, 35 years old, from Kunshan, working on a gasoline boat, and Tang Jinfang testified, 21 years old, local, prevaricated and denied about conspiring to kidnap Mrs. Su, the District Chief learned the confession and judged that the case involved conspiring to kidnap a married young woman and decided to prepare the documents today and send them to the court for interrogation.</p>

He came to Shanghai as a lounger not long ago. He had no residence in Shanghai. In the first month of this year in the lunar calendar, he met Wang Guibao, a woman from Nanjing (19 years old, currently pregnant), and cohabitated in a hotel. After the incident, the deceased's fellow villager notified his mistress, who went to the morgue yesterday morning to identify the body and reported it to the police. Subsequently, the Criminal Section of the French Police reported to Judge Zhu of the French Concession Court, who arrived at the morgue at 2:00 PM in the afternoon to inspect the body. The corpse's head and upper body were chopped seven times with an axe, and the lower abdomen and legs were shot four times. After the examination, he sat in a public position. First, the detective reported the previous situation and presented the seized murder weapon. After Mr. Zhu questioned the deceased's mistress, he ruled that the deceased, Lou Ashui, had been assassinated on the spot. Since no relatives of the corpse were found, the mistress, Wang Gui, was allowed to be responsible for the coffin and burial. The police were ordered to take photos of the body for the record and to arrest the murderer for investigation. Subsequently, fellow villagers raised funds to purchase clothing and a coffin for burial and temporarily placed the coffin in the guild hall, waiting for the mother of the corpse to claim it for burial.</p>

<p>Ship Rescued By American Trading Company</p>
<p>The Pacific mail ship President Cleveland of the American Trading Company, which came to Shanghai from Little Luzon, arrived in Hong Kong first. As it was about to reach Hong Kong, it suddenly encountered heavy fog, and the ship ran aground. Yesterday, the local American Trading Company received a telegram from Hong Kong, stating that the ship had been towed out by a ship sent after the fog cleared, but the ship had suffered minor damage and needed to be repaired in the Hong Kong shipyard. The original plan was to come to Shanghai on the 15th and sail to San Francisco and New York, but it may not be possible by then. The cargo and passengers are safe and sound.</p>
<p>Cargo and Passengers Transferred</p>
<p>The ship is a special express mail ship directly to New York newly dispatched by American Trading, requiring only 36 days from Shanghai to reach. The speed is the fastest among the New York routes of the Pacific ships in Shanghai. There was a lot of export cargo this time, with tung oil alone accounting for 1,200 tons, and there were also quite a few items such as lake silk. Yesterday, the company had to temporarily withdraw the customs declarations of those who had already been declared and transfer them to other ships because it could not arrive in Shanghai as scheduled.

<p>Due to the Influence of Adverse Weather</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other places in Zhejiang, the silkworm season is earlier, but the weather this year is cold and rainy. Most of the early silkworms have failed. After the late silkworms hatched, the climate is still bad and the feeding is difficult. After the silkworms entered hibernation, it rained heavily for five or six days, and the weather was as cold as winter, causing the silkworms in the lush leaves to spit black foam and excrete yellow water due to eating wet leaves, and seven out of ten died of stiffness. No one in the silkworm trade is willing to rent, and those who exchange for cocoon coupons are only about 20%. In Lanxi, Yuhang, Linping, Chang'an, Haining, and other places, about 20 cocoon shops are expected to open for sale, but silk factories in Shanghai are rarely prepared to collect cocoons.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Bookbinding Workers Went on Strike Yesterday <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Demanding a 40% Wage Increase</p>
<p>More than 1,200 workers from 85 Western-style and Chinese-style bookbinding workshops in this city, including Ma Hongji, went on strike voluntarily yesterday morning to demand changes in their treatment conditions. The Municipal Social Bureau has scheduled a mediation meeting today. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike</p>
<p>The bookbinding workers submitted 18 treatment conditions, which were approved by the general meeting on March 13. The most important of these was the first, that from April 1, 1931, regardless of contract or monthly work, all wages would be increased by 40% based on the current amount. After the Citizen Training Council approved it, they were asked to negotiate on their own first. After half a month, it was believed that the capitalists were not sincere in accepting. It was said that the final means would be used to deal with it. The day before yesterday, Geng Longxiang, the owner of Xin Yi Workshop in Lian Zhi Lane, Baoshan Road, had a dispute with worker Zhou Guangyan, which triggered a full-scale voluntary strike at 9:00 AM yesterday. The union's persuasion was ineffective.</p>
<p>Number of Participants</p>
<p>85 companies in the Chinese clothing industry including Ma Hongji, De Da, He Xing, Tang Pinji, Zhang Shunji, Xu Xiangji, Wang Yuji, Dai Chunji, Ma Baoji, Wang Shengji, Chen Xinji, Wang Hengji, Wang Jinji, Yan Puji, Sun Bingji, Feng Yiji, Lu Baoji, Ding Ji, Xu Ji, Qiu Peiji, and the western clothing industry including Rui Feng, Mao Haoji, Lou Chengji, Shi Yongji, Zhao Deji, Fu Youji, He Xing, Shen Guiji, etc. A total of more than 1,200 workers participated.</p>
<p>Authorities' Mediation</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau believes that a strike by clothing workers once would affect local public security, in order to quickly resolve the matter, yesterday notified the Bookbinding Industry Association and the Bookbinding Industry Union to notify the Bureau that it would convene a mediation at 2:00 pm on May 13, and first notify this fact, nominating two responsible representatives to the Bureau to await mediation.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Anti-Drug Meeting Resolves Seven Important Cases <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association held its May Standing Committee meeting yesterday. Wang Yingqi, Li Denghui, Cai Runuo, Ding Shujing, Guo Baoyi, Huang Jiaohui, and others attended. Wang Jingqi chaired the meeting as usual. First, the Secretariat reported on the progress of work in April and the transportation of the association's anti-drug exhibits to anti-drug groups in Java for public display. (1) Following the report that Ms. Huang Baizhiying, the director general of the association, was previously falsely accused of drug trafficking by villains, in addition to the standing committee of the association issuing a statement to prove the truth, the Party Headquarters and the Hong Kong government subsequently proved that the rumors were unfounded. The truth has been published in Chinese and foreign newspapers based on the facts, and anti-drug groups from all over the world have also sent letters of condolence and defended her. The truth has already been revealed. However, the villains who spread the rumors and slander, their purpose was originally to destroy the anti-drug movement. Not only did this plan fail, but they may have changed their tactics and launched attacks by despicable means. How should we respond to this case? It was discussed to observe changes in the environment and find ways to respond at any time. (2) It was resolved that the association previously established a special committee to preside over the association's affairs when Director General Huang left Shanghai and rumors of Mrs. Bai's drug trafficking arose. Now that the truth about Bai's false accusation has been revealed and Director General Huang has long since returned to the association, the special committee's mission has also ended. From today onwards, the committee should be cancelled. (3) The Secretariat reported that the preparation office of the Tianjin Anti-Drug Association was not operating in accordance with the regulations, and the association entrusted Mr. Cao Hongzhu to go to sort it out to maintain the association's reputation and emphasize anti-drug efforts. According to a telegram from Cao, after arriving in Tianjin, he first visited all parties and took over the preparation office, reorganizing it into the Hebei Anti-Drug Association. All parties supported the preparatory committee, which has now been recognized by the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters and received Permit No. 101. The association's reputation has now been restored and progress is going very smoothly. A letter of commendation should be sent to Representative Cao. However, although the organization and purpose of the local organizations are the same as those of the association, the content organization often varies due to circumstances, which often causes misunderstandings from the outside world due to the system. How should we respond to this? It was discussed that most of the local anti-drug organizations are promoted by enthusiastic people in the local area and are not established by the association's personnel. According to the regulations, they should be referred to as a certain local landlord.</p>
<p>Anti-Drug Association or Anti-Drug Propaganda Association does not need to be called Anti-Drug Branch to clarify the truth. (4) Director General Huang Jiaohui reported that Lu Zhengxiang, the former Premier of the State Council, recently sent a letter from the Pope of Rome commending the association's work, expressing great sympathy for our country's national anti-drug movement. It was resolved to send a letter to the Pope of Rome to thank him for his praise. (5) It was resolved to send representatives to contact the leaders of the local Catholic Church and ask them to send the Pope's opinion on the anti-drug movement to national church leaders, and to invite the Catholic Church to participate in anti-drug efforts and work together to promote the early success of the opium ban. (6) It was resolved to submit an opinion to the International League of Nations Conference on the Restriction of Narcotics and mail it to Europe immediately, and to consider the situation and urge colleagues staying in Europe to represent the association at the meeting in the vicinity. (7) The members of the national college thesis competition judges handed over to the secretariat for appointment. There is also a letter from the Singapore Anti-Drug Association, stating that the association's work is progressing actively and there is an urgent need for talent, requesting the association to send a secretary to assist the association for several months, which will be decided at the next meeting.</p>

<p>Red Cross Receives Report</p>
<p>Raising Funds to Rescue Abandoned Infants</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society recently received a joint telegram from the Jiangxi Moral Branch and the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association, stating: "In Jiangxi Province, crops have failed for years in a row. Due to floods, droughts, and wars, and in recent years, the rampant activities of the Red Bandits, looting, burning, and killing, blood has filled the valleys, and floating corpses are still visible in the rivers. One cannot take a step without encountering nets. Travelers still lament, like birds clinging to their branches, who will stop them? Cries of sorrow echo across the fields. Nine out of ten houses are empty, and the sounds of chickens and dogs are not heard along the way. Suffering a hundred sorrows and a thousand calamities, there are no plowing oxen to return to the fields. The disaster is truly the worst in the world, and fundraising is always running dry. The hope for life has been exhausted, and the future is even more difficult. We, the colleagues, are deeply saddened by what we see, and our hands are exhausted from helping. Fulfilling the duties of our homeland and upholding the conscience of morality, we dare to appeal to the billions of disaster victims, to the ten thousand homes of living Buddhas, hoping that gentlemen and people of benevolence, both at home and abroad, will show great compassion and provide extensive relief. A drop of willow branch sprinkled is like sweet rain. Streams from the mountains will converge into a great swamp. The urgency of the telegram is beyond words as we await your orders." Signed by Zhang Luchun, Xu Henian, Zeng Zhanggui, Wang Yunrong, Ding Lizhong, Zhang Shu, Zhang Xianqing, Hu Siyi, Wang Wenxuan, Xu Yuting, Lu Fang, Hong Benli, Xu Zhaolin, Wu Zhaochen, Ou Zufou, Cai Jin, Zhou Renlin, Gong Shicai, Xiong Yuhua, Zhao Congyi, Zhu Wu, Zou Rikui, bowing in gratitude.

<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society considers the relief of infants as one of the active tasks of the International Red Cross Society. In China, apart from the existing orphanages in various places, there are no specially established institutions. According to a report from a certain charitable organization in Jiangxi, wherever the Communist Party goes, they burn and loot the wealth and treasures of the rich, and then the heads of the families are often shot, leaving behind more than 130 infants. They are temporarily being cared for by a certain charitable organization, but due to insufficient funds and a lack of wet nurses, the Chinese Red Cross Society has donated 1,000 yuan to purchase supplies needed for childcare, and plans to establish a model orphanage near Ganzhou, Jiangxi, to raise these infants.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Recent Report on Shaanxi Relief by the Jisheng Society <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society previously received a report from its Shaanxi relief commissioner, Mr. Li Yunmen, stating that the methods for surveying the disaster areas have been recorded in previous reports. Now, the number of households and detailed circumstances have been identified in each town, and a detailed report is being submitted in sections as follows: (1) Wugong Zhenyuan Town: 2,854 households surveyed. Weigong Town: 1,713 households. Youfeng Town: 1,301 households. Yangling Town: 2,322 households. Yongan Town: 1,057 households. Urban Area: 1,023 households. The above six towns have been surveyed, totaling approximately 10,270 disaster-stricken households. Relief funds and grain have already been distributed, and a separate letter has been submitted. (2) It is planned to survey the entire town of Changning. The three towns of Dazhuang, Xuegu, and Pujiji will be surveyed specifically in the highlands, as these three towns are adjacent to Changning and Zhenyuan Towns. Currently, Changning, Dazhuang, Xuegu, and Pujiji have begun the survey, which is expected to be completed within three weeks, and a detailed report will be submitted again. However, the number of disaster-stricken households in the surveyed towns has increased compared to the past, for three reasons: (1) Consecutive years of disaster have led to a gap between the old and new harvests, turning the poor into the extremely poor. (2) People who were displaced in the past are now returning home after hearing about the survey and relief. (3) People who previously fled to the north and south mountains have returned home to receive seeds and grain. They can now settle down and farm after receiving two rounds of timely rain. It is reported that three batches totaling 60,000 yuan were previously remitted to Wugong Zhenyang. After deducting 2,000 yuan for Jingyang Zhenyang, 3,400 yuan for the Wugong Disaster Children's Shelter, and 4,000 yuan for Qian County burial expenses, a total of 8,400 yuan was deducted. Therefore, the funds for seeds and emergency relief in various towns in Wugong are insufficient and will require additional allocations. When needed, an immediate request will be telegraphed for appropriation to meet the urgent needs. Upon arrival, the society's relief funds were completely depleted. Practical planning is now underway to provide immediate relief. It is said that after the seeds were distributed in Wugong, there have been two rounds of timely rain, so fortunately the planting was not delayed, saving the disaster-stricken households from starving again.</p>

<p>The Anquan Firm proclaims that the Yang Brand record oil manufactured by the firm has been popular throughout the country since its launch. All those who have used this oil have praised it highly. Proof letters have been arriving daily in recent days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this oil in protecting records, which is indeed incomparable to other adhesives on the market. As a result, inquiries and purchases have been pouring in from various ports such as the Nanyang Islands, Pingjin, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong, to meet market demand. In addition to having the special effect of protecting records and gramophones, this oil can also be used to lubricate clocks, instruments, cameras, and all commercial typewriters, daily hardware, wooden furniture, etc. Once used, it ensures smooth and easy operation and long-lasting durability, truly making it the only essential product on the market for protecting records, gramophones, and all machinery. The price is only 60 cents per bottle. All major gramophone companies in this city are agents for its sale. The main distributor is located at Weianfang, Haining Road, this city.</p>
<p>The Wantai Limited Company proclaims that it is now selling a "Jierwen" boiler powder, which is the most suitable product for preventing iron scale from forming inside boilers and removing existing iron scale. The water used in boilers often contains minerals, which over time harden into iron scale and adhere to the inner surface of the boiler shell, reducing the boiler's heat transfer ability, wasting fuel, and damaging the boiler surface. The life of the boiler is thus shortened, and sometimes there is a risk of explosion due to slightly higher pressure. Using this powder can avoid all these problems, and the price is extremely low, requiring very little each time. It can be used in any type of water and is absolutely not like other iron scale prevention products, which have more harm than good. Even softened water needs to be added with a little of this powder to completely remove the remaining minerals. Therefore, it is truly a great contribution to the industrial world.</p>
<p>The Chinese Staff Association of the American Shenchang Foreign Firm proclaims that since its organization, the association has spared no effort in its management and operations, and its affairs are thriving. Recently, it has also launched a monthly publication called "Lianyizhi Guang," which is co-edited by Mr. Yu Xinyan and Mr. Lu Shixiong. The content includes editorials, academic knowledge, special articles, etc. Its purpose is to promote justice and to allow outsiders to understand the organization of the association. It is truly an innovative undertaking for Chinese staff in foreign firms to manage publications.</p>
<p>The Babicock &amp; Wilcox Boiler Company proclaims that its London headquarters signed a contract with a power plant last month to undertake the construction of eight water-tube boilers, along with automatic coal feeders, etc. Each boiler can generate 256,000 pounds of steam per hour, with a steam pressure of 650 pounds per square inch, worth a total of 700,000 British pounds.</p>
<p>The British China Soap Company's main factory on Yangshupu Road in East Shanghai proclaims that the factory was built in 1924 and expanded in 1929, occupying a huge area of 150 acres. The main gate faces the Huangpu River, and the approximately 15,000 to 20,000 tons of raw materials required annually can be easily imported through this gate, taking full advantage of the geographical convenience. The factory is managed by British merchants, and the chairman and manager, Mr. E. H. Jones, is a talented person with rich experience in the business world. The factory is well-managed and neatly arranged, and it adheres to the principle of small profits and quick turnover, so its business is growing daily. Now, on the occasion of adding a fragrance soap factory, which is specially prepared for manufacturing Lux fragrance soap, merchants and journalists from various ports both domestic and foreign are specially invited to visit. The general manager, Mr. Jones, and the factory manager, Mr. Hobert, led the tour. The factory is large in scale and utilizes the latest machinery everywhere to replace manual labor. Therefore, it can produce 1.5 million boxes of soap annually, and only a little over 300 workers are needed. The factory has a total of 26 soap kettles, including 20 large kettles, each of which can boil 50 tons of soap, and the remaining small kettles can boil 25 tons. The steam room has 10 steam furnaces, burning approximately 50 to 60 tons of coal daily. The steam required for most soap kettles is supplied by this furnace. Other equipment such as printing presses, wooden box nailing machines, and printing presses that can print five sets of colors at the same time are all available. The comprehensiveness of the equipment is second to none among all factories in Shanghai. The soaps currently produced include Lever Sunlight Soap, Sanitary Medicinal Soap, Lux Toilet Soap, Lever Soap Powder, Xiangmao Beiji, and Hexing Umbrella Brand Soap, especially Sunlight, Xiangmao, and Beiji, which are the most popular. Furthermore, the main ingredients purchased by the factory, such as vegetable oils, are mostly sourced from China. The office staff, engineers, chemists, and workers employed are also all Chinese.
