<h3>Mao's Troops Recover Guangchang</h3>
<p>Bandits Flee Towards Toupi and Kuzhu</p>
<p>Mao's Entire Force Marches into Fujian</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Nanchang Headquarters Staff Office telegraphed on the 16th, relaying a report from Zhu Commander-in-Chief Shaoliang Xian that Mao Division Commander Bingwen Xian had telegraphed in the afternoon stating that his division attacked the Guangchang Red bandits at dawn on the [date removed by censor], and the bandits resisted fiercely. After repeated charges, over a thousand bandits were killed on the spot, several hundred were captured alive, and a large quantity of firearms, ammunition, flags, and seals were seized. They then occupied Guangchang at [time removed by censor]. The remaining bandits are currently fleeing towards Toupi and Kuzhu. Orders have been issued to the troops to pursue and suppress them in separate directions. This is being telegraphed as good news. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, Chiang telegraphed from Hangzhou to a certain agency stating that he had received a telegram from Jiangxi saying that the bandit suppression was progressing smoothly and that Guangchang had been captured. He was very optimistic about the third phase of the post-war reconstruction plan. Additionally, the Jiangxi Headquarters telegraphed the headquarters on the 16th, also stating that the bandits were indeed splitting up and that some of them had sought surrender. It is expected that the situation can be completely resolved within two months. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The entire force of the Sixth Route Army's Mao Bingwen Division has already departed from Nanping and entered Fujian. They will be stationed in Changting, Liancheng, and Wuping counties. Once they reach their destinations, they will join the Chiang and Zhang divisions in suppressing the Red bandits on the Fujian-Jiangxi border. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 1st Cavalry Division telegraphed to Nanjing that several groups of Red bandits in the Huanggang area were causing disturbances and attempting to occupy the county seat. Troops were dispatched to suppress them. On the 14th, Huanggang was surrounded, and after several hand-to-hand battles, the bandits were completely captured. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Headquarters Staff Office issued a circular telegram stating that all newspapers nationwide should be aware that the country has faced many difficulties in recent years, and the Red bandits have taken the opportunity to grow and spread their poison. The situation in central Jiangxi is severe, and it is deeply distressing to see them attempting to endanger the foundation of the nation. Therefore, after the conclusion of the suppression of the rebels, the central government immediately dispatched a large army to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, with the aim of quickly eliminating these vile elements, relieving the suffering of the people, and securing the foundation of the country. It has been found that the Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang bandit groups are entrenched in Jiangxi province, with a large number of them occupying a wide area. However, since the general offensive against the bandits began this month, the bandits' first and second lines of defense have been completely broken through. Key strongholds occupied by the bandits in areas such as Futian, Baisha, Longgang, Toujiangbei, Dongguang, Guangchang, Qia Village, Xinfeng City, and Wangxian have been captured by our various armies. In total, the recovered area spans over three hundred li in length and breadth. The number of bandits killed and the number of bandit weapons seized are countless. Moreover, the people who previously resided in the bandit-controlled areas have risen up to eradicate the bandits. The resources that the bandits rely on to strengthen their forces are being reduced daily, and their original strength is suffering repeated losses. It can be said that their inevitable collapse due to exhaustion is already evident. Furthermore, all officers and soldiers of the National Army can uphold the Central Government's intentions and are striving hard. It is estimated that within a month, these remaining bandits can be gathered and annihilated. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

Peng Weiren, commander of our 16th Division, ordered the brigades of Zhang Liangji and Liu Jiren, along with the Gong Sheng and Yiyong gunboats, to coordinate and advance to suppress them on the morning of the 13th. Upon crossing the river, they immediately made contact with over a thousand bandits, half of whom were armed. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to resist the encirclement by our troops and scattered in all directions. They are currently being searched and suppressed. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian dispatched Huang Fei to attend the aviation conference. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Noteworthy Issues in Spain</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Spanish Republican government, the disturbances caused by the royalists and opposition parties are difficult to resolve in the short term. However, there are several other issues that deserve attention. One is the religious issue. Currently, Spain has abolished Catholicism as the state religion. The new Minister of Justice has notified the representative of the Roman Catholic Church, stating that the new government will treat all religions equally and has declared the separation of politics and religion. Although the representative has agreed to allow Catholics in Spain to not interfere in political affairs in the future, the attitude of the Holy See on this matter is still unknown. Moreover, what kind of response will Catholics in Spain have after losing their privileged position? It is still difficult to predict whether major conflicts will arise in the future. Another is the issue of colonies. The Moroccan islands belonging to Spain are important to Spain along the Mediterranean Sea, both commercially and militarily. They also have a long history of contention with major powers such as Britain and France. They are not easy to obtain, and their indigenous people are fierce and warlike, repeatedly rebelling, and suppressing them is also very difficult. If the reports of opposition to the republic and unrest are true, this is also an extremely difficult problem. One is the issue of diplomacy. The major European countries have a very cold attitude towards the Spanish Republic. The Italian Fascist newspapers are strongly attacking it, while on the other hand, there are rumors of a secret Spanish-Italian pact. Someone asked the Spanish Foreign Minister Le Roux about this, and Le Roux said that he has notified the French government that if France and Italy are unfortunate enough to start a war in the future, France can rely on the loyalty of Spain. The attitude is unpredictable. Reuters stated in its report on this matter that it can be seen that the Spanish revolution will affect the balance of power in Europe. This is also the most noteworthy issue for Spain in the future.</p>

However, these people had no weapons, and they would not have been able to help in the event of an emergency. Outside the palace, rioters surged back and forth like a tide. From the windows, they could be seen wearing red hats, holding red flags and torches, shouting and cursing, trying to enter the palace. The women in the palace were all terrified at this sight, deeply worried that the tragedy of the French Revolution would be repeated. They surrounded the Queen and wept. The Queen suppressed her feelings and pretended to be calm to comfort the people. The Queen and the others did not sleep all night. Before long, the east gradually turned white, and the crowd began to retreat. Later, it was learned that the rioters had used heavy cargo trucks to ram the iron gates in front of the palace during the night. Fortunately, the gates were strong and did not break, which was also said to be a close call.</p>
<h3>The Former Queen of Spain and Her Children</h3>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 17th: After the declaration of the former King of Spain was published, the people were shocked and angry when they read it. The social democratic party's organ newspaper called it "the last evil act of the chief culprit". Political prisoners in Madrid's prisons are now being released in batches. One hundred and thirty people were released on Wednesday, and one hundred and ninety people were released yesterday. Newly formed Republican militia, wearing red armbands, have already been dispatched to guard. These people have all sworn to strictly observe discipline, take charge of the security of the Spanish Republic, and be willing to sacrifice their lives for this if necessary. However, no matter what the circumstances, they will never use violence against the national and peaceful demonstration.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 17th: The former King discussed state affairs with the Queen at the Jiqi Hotel until 3:00 AM this morning before going to bed. The Queen looked happy after meeting with the King again. This morning, the King got up and looked very energetic, no longer as tired as yesterday. He ate a lot. The Queen came to visit at 10:00, an hour later. The Crown Prince is still in bed, but his illness has eased slightly. The hotel where the royal family is staying suddenly feels like a marketplace. The lobby is full of newspaper reporters, and outside the hall stand filmmakers preparing to add new material. Those standing on the road and looking up at the room where the royal family is staying are numerous. The hotel guest book has inquiries expressing sympathy all day long. One old woman signed her name and wrote: "In 1915, I was sentenced to death by the Germans, and I was able to be reborn thanks to the help of the former King."</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 16th: One of the first measures of the new government was to issue an order to cancel the summer daylight saving time system in Spain.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 17th: Since the new President Zamora and Colonel Masia, the leader of the Catalan Autonomy Party, agreed to abandon the name of the Catalan Republic, indicating that Catalonia is still an integral part of the Spanish Republic and not an independent political group, the political situation in Spain has greatly improved, and the work of the provincial government has therefore become much easier. Currently, the authorities in each province are continuing to eliminate the abuses of the dictatorship era, and the militia have also been ordered to disband.</p>
<p>Reuters, Barcelona, 16th: There was quite a bit of disturbance last night, but it is now quiet. This morning, military aircraft circled the sky, displaying the Republican flag. Part of the fleet in the harbor also flew the Republican flag.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 16th: Since the establishment of the new Spanish Republic, Uruguay and Mexico in South America were the first to officially recognize it. Justice Minister Faros de Rivos published an article today stating that he has formally notified the Pope's envoy that the new government treats all religions equally. Therefore, Catholicism has lost its position of superiority in Spain. Furthermore, the separation of church and state is currently being planned. In the future, priests and monks will not be required to swear allegiance to the Spanish Republic. The Pope's envoy replied that he would instruct Catholic priests in Spain to not interfere in political affairs in the future. However, he would reserve his position on the attitude of the Vatican. There are already signs of instability in various parts of Spain, and laborers are particularly dissatisfied with the new government's conservative attitude. Therefore, they are inclined to be incited by anarchists. Riots have occurred in Seville, Barcelona, Bilbao, Malaga, and Huelva, and troops have opened fire to suppress them, killing six people and injuring many others. Communist Party members in Seville seized a large amount of military equipment, intending to declare a Soviet government. The authorities immediately declared martial law and vigorously suppressed them. The armed patrol organized during the era of former dictator Rivera has been disbanded, but the weapons and equipment have not been removed. Therefore, the people of Seville and Barcelona are requesting that firearms be issued to them in order to resist these armed patrols. Furthermore, when political prisoners were released in various places, many rioters also released ordinary criminal offenders.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 17th: Someone visited the new Foreign Minister Lero and asked about the secret treaty between Spain and Italy. Lero said that he had notified the French government that if France and Italy unfortunately started a war one day, France could always rely on the loyalty of Spain. It can be seen that the Spanish revolution will affect the balance of power in Europe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 17th: The Provisional Cabinet of the Republic has decided to allow each department to greatly change the affairs of the dictatorship system, and to plan new systems to replace those implemented by the previous dictatorship government, to be completed before May 31. The cabinet also decided to dissolve the permanent members of the Senate, because these people were not elected. All those appointed by the king have lost their qualifications to participate in the elected assembly. The elected assembly will be elected by universal suffrage.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: Last night, news was received here that the new government of Spain had abolished Catholicism as the state religion, but this news has not yet been verified by the Reuters reporter in Madrid. The reporter said that the Spanish government has drafted an order regarding freedom of belief, and it may not abolish the state religion to invite unfavorable things upon itself. Furthermore, the new Attorney General Los Rivos met with a delegation of Catholic churches in Madrid yesterday, which is enough to prove that the church has recognized the new government. According to news from Barcelona, Catholic groups are now issuing declarations stating their support for the new government, with "May God bless the Republic" as their conclusion. Spanish police have been ordered to vigorously prohibit any demonstrations against churches.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 17th: The new government has ordered the dismissal of all provincial governors in the country and the appointment of new officials to replace them, in order to show that the revolution has succeeded and the people have been renewed. All officers and soldiers who have been detained have been released to show the meaning of the revolution.</p>
<h3>Speculation in the American Film Industry</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Hollywood, California, 16th: The American film tycoon Gu Luoman sent a telegram to the former King of Spain inviting him to Hollywood to make a sound film. According to Gu's calculations, the sound film made with the former King as the protagonist would generate at least three million U.S. dollars in profit, which could be used for charity in the future.</p>
<h3>The Portuguese Revolution Shows Signs of Spreading</h3>
<p>Authorities Crack Down on Political Gatherings</p>
<p>Military Strongholds Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 16th: The Spanish revolution has shown signs of spreading to Portugal, and the whole country is panicked. The government has issued orders to ban all gatherings planned by the Republican Party. All railways have been heavily guarded, and military strongholds are all heavily garrisoned. Furthermore, news censorship is extremely strict, so no reliable news of the rebellion has been transmitted.</p>
<h3>The British Conservative Party's Motion of No Confidence</h3>
<p>Failed to Deal with Unemployment Relief as a Reason</p>
<p>Finally Defeated by a Margin of 54 Votes</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: This afternoon, Conservative Party leader Baldwin moved to impeach the Labor government for failing to fulfill its promises regarding unemployment relief made during the general election. The chamber was crowded with spectators, and there were many aristocrats in the gallery. Baldwin's criticism of the government was unusually fierce, saying that the government had not only lost the trust of the people, but also the trust of its own party. The new Lord Privy Seal, Johnston, defended the government, stating the steps the government had taken to relieve unemployment, criticizing the House of Lords for suppressing the government's education bill, and explaining the various difficulties of overseas autonomous territories in re-settling British immigrants and dealing with the unemployment problem. He said that the root cause of unemployment lies in export trade, and there is no way to seek relief without international action. Johnston also reported on the achievements of the British Empire Exhibition in the Argentine capital in promoting agricultural machinery and automobiles. After Johnston finished speaking, many Labor Party members applauded. The Liberal Party members then temporarily withdrew to discuss the case. As a result, 28 Liberal Party members opposed the impeachment motion, 7 supported it, and 8 advocated not voting. The government has decided that it has a majority vote. Before long, Independent Labor Party leader Brockway and Liberal Party leader George successively declared their willingness to vote in support of the government. Prime Minister MacDonald said that if the House of Commons passes the impeachment motion, the government will appeal to the people. The Conservative Party's impeachment motion was finally defeated by 305 votes to 251 votes.</p>
<h3>New Indian Governor-General Wellington Arrives in Bombay to Take Office</h3>

<p>Reuters, Bombay, 16th: Gandhi and cotton merchants in Bombay and other places gathered this morning and decided to appoint an executive committee to implement Gandhi's plan to re-export foreign cloth. Reuters, Bombay, 16th: Gandhi met with outgoing Indian Governor-General Irwin for two hours and then rushed home to observe silence and not deal with newspaper reporters. However, Irwin said in his farewell speech to the yarn factory association that he knew that Gandhi was now trying hard to implement the Delhi Treaty, but he could not avoid mentioning that many matters remained to be dealt with.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of China's Egg Industry</h3>
<p>American Farmers' Groups Request Increased Import Taxes</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 16th: Today, all American farmers and poultry industry groups jointly petitioned the Federal Tariff Commission, recommending that the U.S. President increase the import tax on egg powder by 50% in order to protect the egg industry against the simultaneous import of Chinese egg powder. At the same time, importers, bakeries, and the confectionery industry also sent representatives to the Federal Tariff Commission to oppose this move. Currently, most of the egg powder imported by the United States is shipped from China. The current tax is 18 cents per pound. When the tariff rules were amended last year, farmers petitioned to increase it to 36 cents, but the result was not increased. Therefore, there is today's petition. According to Mo Yi, leader of the Pacific Coast Poultry Association, Chinese egg powder is currently 15 cents cheaper than American goods in the U.S. market. Therefore, if tariffs are not increased, the American egg industry will be defeated. However, according to representatives of importers and others, the manufacturing cost claimed by the American egg industry is too high.</p>

<h3>Hankou Discovers Japanese Gun-Selling Organization</h3>
<p>The main person, Gorinkichi, has been captured</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: For several years, the Red bandits in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have been harassing the area and have not yet been wiped out. Their grain and salaries are mostly plundered from the people or used with counterfeit Soviet banknotes, and their guns and ammunition are also inexhaustible. The source of purchase is really worthy of attention. The Wuhan Garrison Command previously received a secret report that the Red bandits in the three provinces were mostly supplied with guns and ammunition from Hankou, but because there was no evidence, it only issued a general order to the garrison troops to strictly guard against this and at the same time strictly ordered the water and land inspection posts to carefully inspect them. After many days, the 48th Division Military Police Battalion, which was responsible for the garrison in Hankou, did break this organization. The main culprit was a Japanese named Gorinkichi, who sold poisons in addition to guns and ammunition. He has now been escorted to the Headquarters along with the criminals and evidence for interrogation. Previously, Su Yaozeng, battalion commander of the 48th Division Military Police Battalion, received an order from the Garrison Command to strictly investigate the supply of guns and ammunition to the Red bandits. He then assigned many detectives to investigate in different directions. It was reported that there was an organization in the Japanese Concession that sold radioactive poisons and handguns, and that the person in charge was a Japanese ronin named Gorinkichi, who was using the concession to operate this business exclusively. At that time, because the organization was located in the concession, it was not easy to crack down on it. Therefore, a well-trained detective disguised himself as a customer and contacted the Japanese. After negotiations, it was agreed to purchase five guns with a bottle of poisonous liquid as a gift, and a deposit of one hundred yuan was paid first. They agreed to deliver the goods at the YMCA on time. When the Japanese did come out of the Japanese Concession to the YMCA to contact the buyer, the detective team immediately captured him and searched his body for five handguns and a bottle of poison. He was immediately taken to the battalion headquarters, where Battalion Commander Su personally interrogated him. According to Gorinkichi's confession, he had been in Hankou for a long time and specialized in selling guns. These handguns, when filled with poison and released into the air, immediately turned into poisonous gas that could kill many people. If the amount of poison was reduced, the wounded could be rendered unconscious for as long as two hours. Battalion Commander Su believed that the case was serious and reported it to Commander-in-Chief of the Wuhan Headquarters on the 15th, along with the criminal Gorinkichi and the guns and poison for interrogation. That night, Chief of the Military Law Office Yuan Zhuqiao interrogated him once. The Japanese's confession suddenly changed, saying that the poison was for killing bedbugs and could not kill people, and that there was no poisonous gas effect. Chief Yuan then took a dog on the spot and released the poison in the same way. The dog was so severely poisoned that it immediately fell to the ground. Because the evidence was conclusive, there was no need for doubt. He then reported the interrogation and test situation to Director He for instructions. He discussed the matter with Mayor Liu Wendao, saying that it was a matter of harming public order. In addition to reporting the details to the central government, they also planned to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese consulate through the municipal government as soon as possible. This poison is currently being tested. As for the Japanese consulate, Consul Tanaka heard the news and is also investigating the matter and sent two officials to visit Yang Kui, the director of the Headquarters Office, on the 16th to discuss the situation. The details of their communication have not yet been ascertained. The Japanese has been handed over by the Headquarters to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for detention, awaiting further interrogation. (April 16)</p>
<h3>Aviation Fifth Squadron Plane Crashes in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>"Wu Sheng" Plane Crashes and Breaks into Three Sections</p>
<p>Squad Leader Wu and Pilot Jing Killed</p>
<p>Minister He Allocates 2,000 Yuan for Funeral Expenses</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs recently sent section chiefs and consultants to Jiangxi to examine the Fifth Squadron stationed in Jiangxi. From the 10th to the 12th, all aviation personnel flew their planes in the air for exercises. After the examination, the Aviation Department considered the results to be excellent. On the 13th, at noon around 11 o'clock, the squadron leader Wu was ordered to depart for the front line to conduct reconnaissance and bombing. He and pilot Jing were flying the "Wu Sheng" aircraft at 11:30 a.m. from the Shunwai station airfield. They circled the airfield once and were about to go south when the driver was slow to close the throttle and the plane flipped over in the air and crashed in a rice field near the Nanyue Temple outside Shunwai (half a li from the airfield). At that time, airfield personnel and city residents were watching and had not dispersed. At first, they thought the plane was performing a somersault exercise, and only realized that it was an accident when they saw the plane's nose pointing down. When the aviation personnel rushed to the rescue, they saw the plane's nose plunged more than a foot into the soil and the entire plane broken into three sections. Squadron leader Wu Xingjian and pilot Jing Shuzhuang were lying in pools of blood. Jing's brain was cracked and his body was shattered. There was a lot of brain matter and blood near the plane. He had already died. Wu's head was broken and his bones were broken. He was barely breathing and could only speak intermittently. However, the fuel tank was still pressing on Wu's body. The rescuers then opened the fuel tank, lifted Wu out, and carried him to Nanchang Hospital in a canvas stretcher. However, after walking only a few dozen steps, Wu's pulse stopped completely and he could not be saved and died. At that time, the aviation section of the Headquarters had sent personnel to investigate everything and reported the situation to Minister He. He was very saddened after hearing the report and allocated 2,000 yuan for funeral expenses and reported to the central government for condolences. At the same time, he drafted a eulogy: "Lofty aspirations soaring into the sky, flying thousands of miles, air battles playing out courageously, breaking through the sharp and invincible, no match for the enemy, a sudden gust of wind caused the two heroes to crash, the chapter gate conveys tragic details, falling flowers and crying birds leave behind sorrow." Currently, the remains of Wu and Jing have been placed in coffins made of nanmu wood worth more than a thousand yuan purchased by the squadron and will be transported back to their hometowns for burial that day. The plane has been dismantled and transported back to Nanjing for repairs. According to aviation personnel, the plane is worth about 150,000 yuan. Fortunately, the gasoline did not spill out when it crashed, otherwise it would have been burned. Wu's ancestral home is in Jiangxi and he grew up in Guangdong. He graduated from Guangdong Aviation School and is still unmarried. He was skilled in piloting and had won a gold medal. Jing was from Hebei and graduated from Beiping Nanyuan Aviation School. His old mother and weak wife are in Beiping and he has one son and one daughter who are all under three years old. His situation after his death is extremely desolate. (April 13)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Suppression of Bandits in Baodugang by Various Units of the King of Han</h3>
<p>Temporary Change of Timetable for Jinpu Railway Train Due to Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Wang Jun went north to Linzao on the 13th for inspection. He arrived in Lincheng on the same day and then went to the Linzao branch line. On the morning of the 14th, he arrived in Zaozhuang to inspect the 70th Regiment of the 12th Division under Chen Chuanwen and observe the bandit suppression situation. He then received a telegram from Han Fuju inviting him to meet in Zaozhuang. Wang stayed in Zaozhuang temporarily. When Wang passed through Lincheng, he ordered Li Wenbin, the commander of the 21st Brigade of the 7th Division's bandit suppression command, to inspect the situation of the Jinpu Railway in southern Shandong. Han has now transferred from eastern Shandong to the Jinpu Railway and is taking a train south. He will first meet with Li Wenbin in Tengxian, and is expected to arrive in Zaozhuang today (the 15th). Li will also go to Zaozhuang to meet with Wang. According to reports, the bandit forces in Baodugang are showing signs of collapse, and the situation in the Linzao area is very calm. The 41st Regiment of the 7th Division under Hu Yan has blocked several sections along Hanzhuang, Shagou, and Lincheng. The 70th Regiment of Chen Chuanwen is converging on Baodugang from the Linzao branch line, making it impossible for the bandit gangs to flee westward. The main force of the Han army and the 26th Division under Chen Yaohan are suppressing the bandits from the northeast of Baodugang, making it easy to eliminate them. Yesterday, the Garrison Headquarters also received a telegram from Jiang Chuou stating that the railway artillery team stationed in Jinan, the First Battalion under Dai Hongbin, has been dispatched to patrol the Xuyan Railway. The Third Battalion under Wang Haoding, stationed in Xuzhou, has dispatched armored vehicles to Hanzhuang to patrol and suppress fleeing bandits. For safety, the Jinpu Railway train schedule has been changed during this period of bandit suppression. All trains pass through southern Shandong at night. The first-class train arrives in Xuzhou at 7:16 PM and departs south at 7:46 PM daily. The second-class train arrives in Xuzhou at 9:06 AM and departs north at 9:36 AM daily. The 201st train arrives in Xuzhou at 7:20 PM and departs south at 7:50 PM on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The 202nd train arrives in Xuzhou at 6:15 AM and departs north at 6:45 AM on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Other short-distance tickets have also been slightly changed.

<h3>Joint Suppression of Red Bandits on the Border of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Red Bandits in eastern Jiangxi were severely suppressed by the Sixth and Nineteenth Route Armies, they planned to flee from Shicheng and Ruijin to Ninghua and Changting in Fujian Province. The garrisoned troops of Liu Shangzhi and Zhou Zhiqun dispatched teams to block and suppress them in Qiaoyang and Gucheng. Mao Bingwen's division of the Sixth Route Army also broke through Shicheng from Ningdu and advanced towards Ninghua and Changting to join forces with Liu and Zhou's brigades to launch a pincer attack on the Red Bandits. Since Ninghua and Changting counties were already prepared, and fearing that they would be attacked from both sides after the Fujian and Jiangxi armies joined forces, the Red Bandits fled from Ruijin and Changting to Wuping, Shanghang, Pingyuan, and Jiaoling on the border of Fujian and Guangdong. The Fujian Provincial Government immediately telegraphed Zhang Zhen, the division commander of the 49th Division stationed in Zhangzhou, and Xiang Hanping, the division commander of the 61st Division stationed in Shantou, to quickly send troops to jointly block and intercept them. It also telegraphed He Yingqin in Jiangxi, requesting him to urge Mao Bingwen's division to advance at full speed to pursue the bandits. It is expected that the four provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Fujian will carry out a joint suppression of the Red Bandits on the border in a few days.</p>
<p>Recently, the Red Bandits in Chong'an and Pucheng counties, where Qianshan and Guangfeng in Jiangxi Province border Fujian, have again shown signs of unrest. Yesterday, the Provincial Government received a telegram from Chen Yingkui, the magistrate of Chong'an County, stating that more than a thousand local Red Bandits had arrived from Pucheng, planning to attack the county seat. They have already reached Xiamei, thirty miles away from Chong'an. Please send troops to urgently aid. Upon receiving the telegram, the Provincial Government immediately ordered Lin Bingzhou, the brigade commander of the Second Marine Corps Brigade stationed in Jian'ou, to lead his troops to rush to suppress the bandits. The base of the Red Bandits in Pucheng and Chong'an counties is located on the border of the two provinces. They specialize in resisting taxes, killing people, and setting fires. Although Lu Xingbang and Qian Yuguang's brigades have suppressed them with heavy troops, they have not been completely eliminated. The Provincial Government has recently sent Lin Jinan to investigate in order to plan fundamental follow-up measures. (April 14th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Finance Department Revises Regulations on Silver Firm Circulating Notes</h3>
<p>Also, the Regulations on the Prohibition of Silver Firms are Formulated</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Silver firms in Guangdong previously issued circulating receipts based on Hong Kong banknotes. The Finance Department discovered this and sent a special task force to search. The proposal and regulations for issuing receipts were seized at the Silver Firm Association and sent to the Finance Department. The Finance Department then issued an order to investigate Zou Dianbang, the chairman of the association. Zou immediately submitted a report to the Finance Department, stating that the initial intention of proposing the issuance of circulating receipts was purely to facilitate the circulation of receipts within the industry and facilitate business, with no other intention. He requested instructions on whether the regulations were feasible and how to revise or suspend them. The Finance Department approved and issued six revised regulations on circulating receipts, ordering the association to comply. The general idea of the approval was that the obstruction of the circulation of old silver coins was entirely due to the failure of silver firms to make efforts to establish a silver coin appraisal center. Not only did they not want to see it succeed, but they also issued a type of receipt based on Hong Kong banknotes, indirectly resisting national currency, preventing the circulation of old silver coins, and destroying finance. If it were allowed to circulate, the result would inevitably be: (1) New silver coins would turn into old silver coins in three or two months. At that time, only Chinese paper money and Hong Kong paper money would be used for transactions in the market. (2) Apart from being destroyed, the circulation of Chinese paper money would be at most more than 20 million. Apart from tax turnover, there would not be much surplus for market transactions. At that time, silver coins in the market would inevitably be excluded by Hong Kong currency and become a Hong Kong currency world. Therefore, the nine regulations on the association's issuance of circulating receipts were revised to six regulations, and the Finance Department immediately issued an order to be put into effect. At the same time, the association's nine regulations on circulating receipts were abolished, so that the person in charge would not be held accountable. The six revised regulations on silver firm circulating receipts by the Finance Department are as follows: (1) When accepting receipts, the issuing firm must pay cash when receiving silver, and must not force the accepting firm to accept the lower firm's receipts. (2) When the accepting firm brings the receipt to the issuing firm to receive silver, the issuing firm shall immediately pay the common silver coins stipulated in the Guangdong Silver Coin Appraisal Center regulations or the cash-convertible paper money issued by the Guangdong Central Bank. The receiving firm shall not refuse to accept them. (3) If the accepting firm believes that the silver coin paid by the issuing firm is low-quality or fake and a dispute arises, both parties shall immediately go to the Guangdong Silver Coin Appraisal Center to apply for appraisal in accordance with the regulations. (4) If the issuing firm or the accepting firm violates the above regulations, in addition to being sanctioned by the Guangdong Silver Coin Appraisal Center regulations, if the opposing party or the appraisal center notifies the Silver Firm Association of the fact that a certain firm has violated the regulations, the firm shall be deemed to have abandoned itself to the public and all firms shall be notified not to accept the receipts of that firm. At the same time, the Finance Department shall be notified for record. When that firm is willing to abide by the above regulations, it shall submit a written guarantee to the association and forward it to the Finance Department for record, and pay a fine of 500 yuan to the Silver Firm Association for expenses before notifying all firms to accept the receipts of that firm. (5) These regulations are revised by the Finance Department and issued to the Silver Firm Association for announcement. All firms that have expressed their willingness to abide by the original nine regulations and sent them to the association for record, as well as silver firms that have not sent a written statement of willingness to the association for record, shall comply with these regulations and implement them from April 15, 20th year. (6) If there are any necessary amendments to these regulations, the Silver Firm Association may submit a request to the Finance Department for verification and amendment.</p>
<p>Since the Finance Department has revised the regulations on silver firm circulating receipts, it has also taken the view that the industry's unauthorized issuance of foreign currency-denominated notes and speculative trading have had a great impact on finance and must be strictly prohibited. Therefore, the Finance Department formulated regulations on the prohibition of silver firms and submitted them to the 159th meeting of the Provincial Government on the 10th. It was resolved to hand them over to the Finance Department to finalize them and announce them by the end of this month. The following are the regulations on the prohibition of silver firms: Article 1: In Guangzhou City, in addition to the government-run and merchant-run banks established in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the competent authorities of the National Government, all silver operators in Guangzhou City are divided into the following two types: (A) Silver Firms (B) Money Exchange Shops. Both types of silver operators shall be subject to the prohibition of each article of these regulations, but the articles and plans previously approved by the government that do not conflict with these regulations shall still be complied with. Article 2: The minimum capital of a silver firm shall be 50,000 yuan, and the minimum capital of a money exchange shop shall be 5,000 yuan per shop.

<h3>Judgment in the Gu Ziyi Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment and a Fine of 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>External Compensation of Over 120,000 Yuan to Tianjin Customs</p>
<p>Tianjin Aviation Correspondence: During the Northern military period last year, Yan Xishan wanted to use the Tianjin Customs tax revenue, so on June 20th, he appointed Xin Bosen and Gu Ziyi as the chief and deputy tax commissioners to forcibly take over the Tianjin Customs. By August, Yan and Feng had failed, and Xin Bosen was assassinated. Gu, under the alias Zhang Kaixian, fled to Dalian. He did not account for any of the Tianjin Customs accounts or public funds. The Customs Office then sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to arrest Gu. On December 17th of last year, Gu was arrested at the Southern Hotel in Dalian. He was detained at the Dalian Japanese Police Station for more than ten days and escorted to Tianjin on January 3rd of this year. At the same time, Gu Zifan (Gu Ziyi's younger brother, who had served as an accountant in the Customs Office), who was related to this case, was also arrested and detained at the Public Security Bureau. The Tianjin Customs Office then hired lawyer Lu Yimei as a representative to request the Public Security Bureau to transfer the case to the Tianjin District Court. In February, the District Court accepted the case, and Shun also hired lawyer Sun Qilian as a defense counsel. After repeated court hearings, the verdict was announced at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 14th). Gu Ziyi was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and fined 3,000 yuan. Gu Zifan was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fined 2,000 yuan. Gu Ziyi and Gu Zifan were jointly and severally liable to compensate Tianjin Customs with 123,000 yuan of silver and return the fine receipts they had handled to Tianjin Customs. Gu stated in court that he did not accept the verdict and would appeal. The full text of the judgment is reproduced below:</p>
<p>Main Text: Gu Ziyi is sentenced to five years of imprisonment for embezzling items held in public office and fined 3,000 yuan. If the fine cannot be fully paid after compulsory execution, imprisonment will be commuted at a rate of three yuan per day. The number of days of detention before the final judgment shall be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days per day. Gu Zifan is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for assisting in the embezzlement of items held in public office and fined 2,000 yuan. If the fine cannot be fully paid after compulsory execution, imprisonment will be commuted at a rate of three yuan per day. The number of days of detention before the final judgment shall be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days per day. Gu Ziyi and Gu Zifan shall be jointly and severally liable to compensate the Tianjin Customs Office with 123,778.91 yuan of silver and return the fine receipts they had handled to the Tianjin Customs Office. The incidental civil litigation regarding the part of miscellaneous fines of 10,713.83 yuan is dismissed.</p>
<p>Facts: The defendant Gu Ziyi once served as a special agent in the Tianjin Second and Fifth Additional Tax Bureau. On June 20th of last year, he and the Englishman Xin Bosen were appointed by Yan Xishan as the chief and deputy tax commissioners of the Tianjin Customs Office to handle customs affairs. According to the Tianjin Customs regulations, if merchants passing through customs concealed goods or failed to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations, they would be punished once discovered. All fines were collected by the defendant Gu Ziyi. From the date the defendant took over the matter to the end of August of the same year, a total of 123,778.91 yuan was received in fines. This fine was first deposited by Gu Ziyi and Xin Bosen jointly and privately in the Dongfang Huili Bank. On September 20th, Xin Bosen wrote a check and withdrew all the deposits and handed them over to Gu Ziyi for safekeeping. Gu Ziyi then spent a part of this amount himself and deposited the remaining part in the Tianjin National Bank on September 24th and 25th in the names of Luo Shi and Long Ji, totaling 37,133.67 yuan of silver in Luo Shi's account and 42,150 yuan of silver in Long Ji's account. On the 30th of the same month, 10,000 yuan was withdrawn from Luo Shi's name, and a total of 30,000 yuan including the previous surplus was deposited in the Zhongnan Bank in the name of Gu Jian to earn interest. Luo Shi's and Long Ji's two deposit books and a deposit slip from the Zhongnan Bank were all kept by Gu Ziyi himself. Afterwards, although the Tianjin Customs was recovered by the Central Government, Gu Ziyi still hid the huge amount of money and refused to hand it over, and secretly destroyed the relevant documents and privately took out the fine receipts in an attempt to destroy the evidence of the crime. On the evening of October 1st, Xin Bosen was stabbed in his residence in the British Concession. Gu Ziteng inquired and learned that a tobacco merchant was resentful because a large amount of tobacco he was selling had been confiscated by the Customs, causing him to lose his family fortune, so he committed the assassination. He also heard that the National Government was about to issue an arrest warrant, so he became fearful and changed his name to Zhang Kaixian and secretly went to Dalian to hide on the 8th of the same month. Before leaving, he handed over all the deposit books to his brother Gu Zifan for safekeeping and told him that the two deposits of Luo Shi and Long Ji must first be consulted with Yan Xishan before they could be disposed of. After receiving the deposit books, Gu Zifan went to Taiyuan to consult with Yan Xishan. At that time, Yan Xishan was absconding due to defeat and failed to meet him. After Gu Zifan returned to Tianjin, he withdrew 15,000 yuan of deposits on October 16th and spent it without authorization. On November 11th, Xin Bosen died of his injuries. Gu Zifan then occupied the deposits as his brother's sole possession. At that time, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner had learned from the Dongfang Huili Bank and the National Bank about Gu Ziyi's deposits and withdrawals in the various banks and sent a letter to the Tianjin Municipal Government, secretly ordering the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send police to the defendant's home at 26 Shengdeli in the Japanese Concession to search for him. The National Bank and Zhongnan Bank deposit books and Gu Jian's seal were found. Because Gu Ziyi was at large, the defendant Gu Zifan and Gu Ziyi's wife and others were taken to the Bureau for interrogation. With the assistance of the Guandong Police Department, Gu Ziyi was arrested at the Southern Hotel in Dalian on December 17th of last year and escorted to this court. The prosecutor investigated and concluded that the defendant Gu Ziyi's embezzlement of items held in his official duties violated Article 357 of the Criminal Law, and the destruction of documents violated Article 380 of the same law. Gu Zifan's assistance in the embezzlement also violated Articles 45, 357, and 356 of the same law. A public prosecution was filed. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Longjiang Correspondence: The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Headquarters, after being appointed by the central authorities last month and sworn in in Liaoning, has been actively preparing for its establishment. Wu Tiecheng, a member of the Central Committee, arrived in Jiang yesterday from Harbin. Wu Huanzhang, Wang Xianzhang, and other members of the Provincial Party Headquarters immediately consulted with Wu and decided to hold the inaugural meeting at 10:00 AM on the 10th. Today (the 10th), the entire city is hung with flags, and all agencies, schools, and organizations are given a holiday for one day to celebrate. The meeting place is set up in the auditorium of the Provincial Party Headquarters (Provincial Assembly). Soldiers and police stand guard on both sides of the gate, and many Boy Scouts are responsible for maintaining order. At 9:30 AM, representatives from all walks of life had already gathered. At 10:00 AM, Wu Tiecheng, along with secretaries Mai Chaochu, Wang Xingzhou, Chen Yinong, Huang Jianfen, and others, arrived at the meeting. Wu shook hands with Wan Fulin and others, and then went with Wan to the lounge for a short rest. About five minutes later, the meeting was declared open. More than a thousand people from all walks of life observed the ceremony, and the seats were full. Wan Fulin presided over the meeting and first reported on the preparation and establishment of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Headquarters. He then said that the Provincial Party Headquarters would follow the teachings of the Premier, obey the orders of the central authorities, work hard to promote and strive to awaken the masses to fight together for the construction of the province and China. Then, Wu Tiecheng was invited to deliver a speech on behalf of the central authorities. Wu then stood up and said that today, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Headquarters is officially declared established. He, Tiecheng, feels very honored to represent the central authorities in attending this grand and solemn ceremony. Although the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Headquarters was only established today, the comrades in the Northeast who participated in the revolution more than 20 years ago before the establishment of the Northeast Party Headquarters have made great sacrifices for the revolution. The great contributions of the Northeast comrades to the revolution are also a glorious background for the establishment of the Northeast Party Headquarters. Today, at this grand and solemn ceremony, we want to commemorate that glorious revolutionary history in the Northeast. At the same time, we must also know that when Soviet Russia invaded the border in the 18th year of the Republic of China, there was a very important, very glorious, very tragic, and very humiliating thing that is worthy of our eternal commemoration, that is, the brave spirit of the Heilongjiang Province's anti-Russian soldiers. The Heilongjiang Province's anti-Russian soldiers died on the border for the Republic of China and for the Chinese nation. Their deaths were a matter of seeking benevolence and gaining benevolence, and they died in their place. Not only do we have to commemorate them now, but they will also always become the most meaningful and profound lessons for the whole country, that is, to teach us to always maintain the unity and peace of the Republic of China and to work together to promote the construction of the Republic of China. If we cannot maintain the unity of the Republic of China and cannot promote the construction of the Republic of China, the Republic of China cannot exist, and the Chinese nation cannot survive. The position of the Northeast is extremely dangerous, and everyone feels the pain of being oppressed by imperialists. The people of the Northeast should work together under the leadership of the Three People's Principles to cope with this special environment and not have the concept of "this territory" and "my territory." Only then can the danger of the Northeast be gradually eliminated, the foundation of China be consolidated, and everything in China can begin to be built. The safety of the Northeast is related to the safety of the entire China. The people of the whole country must unite under the guidance of the Three People's Principles to help the Northeast, which is an important gateway to China. If we, the people of the Northeast, in this important position and dangerous environment, want to divide something like "this territory" and "my territory," we will immediately be defeated by our enemies one by one. Today, representing the central authorities, I have come here to attend this grand ceremony, hoping that the comrades in the Northeast, starting from the establishment of the Party Headquarters today, will all base themselves on the Premier's great fearless spirit, take the Three People's Principles as their guide, and jointly shoulder the mission of construction. Only then can this territory be preserved and the foundation of China be consolidated. Tiecheng hopes that everyone will work together here and wish everyone good health. After Wu's speech, the music was played, the photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned. (April 10th)</p>
<h3>Joint Declaration of the Various Chambers of Commerce in Jiangsu Regarding the Provincial Government's Imposition of Business Tax</h3>
<p>Concerning the Provincial Government's Levying of Business Tax</p>
<p>At 3 PM on the 16th, representatives from chambers of commerce in various counties and districts of Jiangsu Province held a discussion meeting at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce. Forty-six people, including Zhu Runzhi, were present. First, Yu Xiaochuan reported on the process of visiting the Provincial Finance Department, stating that the Provincial Government had already set a date for the tax collection, which could no longer be delayed. Furthermore, the tax rate could not be changed, and it would still be collected according to the tax rate revised by the Ministry of Finance. The representatives expressed their opinions one after another. As a result, the following resolutions were reached: (1) Before the petition yields results, if the government rashly sets a date for the implementation of business tax collection, all counties should uniformly refuse to pay and issue a declaration. (2) Wu Shouying was publicly recommended to be responsible for drafting the declaration, with Ren Yao Fu and Wu Maoshu as drafting committee members, and incidentally draft telegrams to the National Government, the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, and the Provincial Government. (3) In addition to publishing the declaration in Shanghai newspapers, local chambers of commerce should also forward it to local newspapers in their respective counties for publication. (4) The declaration would use the roll call of the general meeting on the 15th, with each chamber signing in order. After extending the meeting for an hour, the drafting members proposed the declaration and telegram drafts for discussion, which were revised and approved separately. The meeting then adjourned. The declaration and telegram drafts are recorded below:</p>
<p>Declaration to the Various Levels of Party Headquarters, Legal Organizations, and Newspapers Throughout Jiangsu Province: The Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations violate the guidelines set by the Ministry of Finance. The tax rate is burdensome, and the procedures are complicated. Petitions have been repeatedly submitted, appealing for revisions, which have been acknowledged by the various ministries and departments of the Central Government and Chairman Ye of the Provincial Government, who sympathized with the difficulties of businesses and adopted them. Merchants throughout the province were finally relieved of their burdens and would not suffer similar likin [internal transit tax] pains again. Unexpectedly, the Finance Department suddenly proposed at the Provincial Government meeting on the 14th that the implementation of the tax collection would begin on April 1st. This contradicts both the Provincial Government's document of the 10th of this month to our association and others, instructing the Finance Department to consider and respond, and also violates the Executive Yuan's instruction that "all compulsory collections from the people by the central and local governments must first be decided in principle by the Central Political Council and reviewed in content by the Legislative Yuan before they can be established." Furthermore, an investigation reveals that the losses from the abolition of likin in Jiangsu Province, including the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, amount to only over 1.4 million. The original purpose of establishing the business tax was to compensate for the losses from the abolition of likin, so the original losses should be used as a basis. However, the Finance Department has intensified its efforts, rashly including the huge sum of 4 million for business tax in the budget. Freely establishing regulations indicates an intention to profit from the merchants, and freely negotiating the collection period further violates the approvals of the Ministry and the Province. Is this not the benefit of likin abolition being just lip service to merchants, while the government actually gains from increased taxes? What is the purpose of reducing economic hardship? What about the credibility of the government? The commerce of various counties in inland Jiangsu is declining day by day, and the government should be supporting it. The Central Political Council's decision this time earnestly instructed not to harm businesses or impede commercial development, which merchants deeply appreciate. Our association, in order to respect central laws and regulations and to alleviate the suffering of merchants, will not recognize the order to implement business tax collection in Jiangsu on April 1st until the Business Tax Law is reviewed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan. Any new tax law that is not cautious at the beginning will directly harm businesses and indirectly harm the people. The previous example of likin is frightening. Therefore, we solemnly issue this declaration, appealing to the various levels of Party Headquarters, legal organizations, and newspapers in Jiangsu to uphold righteousness and provide assistance. We await instructions with utmost urgency. Sincerely, Chambers of Commerce of Jiangdu, Jiangyin, Jintan, Guazhou, Donghai, Chongming, Taixian, Yancheng, Haimen, Jiangyan, Pixian, Hai'an, Suqian, Liuhe, Nanhui, Liyang, Huai'an, Changshu, Tangshan, Dongtai, Wuxi, Nantong, Suining, Yaowan, Shengze, Zhenjiang, Wujiang, Yizheng, Xinghua, Yilin, Kunshan, Peixian, Huaiyin, Taixing, Wujin, Sishui, Xiaoxian, Wuxian, Yixing, Hushu, Gaoyou, Lishui, Dangshan, etc.</p>
<p>Telegram Draft to the Jiangsu Provincial Government: Having read in the newspaper that your government decided on the 14th to implement the business tax in our province on April 1st, we were shocked and alarmed. The member associations have repeatedly dispatched representatives to petition the Executive Yuan, ministries, and your government, presenting our opinions and requesting a revision of the tax rate. On April 10th, we received your government's approval, instructing the Finance Department to consider and respond. Member associations deeply appreciate the Chairman's concern for merchants and have announced to merchants in all counties that they are awaiting the revision of a tax law that conforms to the guidelines set by the Ministry. We never expected that the tax collection would be rashly implemented before it was revised and promulgated by the Central Government. Unexpectedly, only four days after your government's approval, there was a resolution to implement the collection. The government can freely change its decisions, but the representatives truly feel the pain of broken trust, causing merchants to have doubts and raise questions. We urgently telegraph to your government for review, humbly requesting that you consider the various points made by the representatives of member associations throughout the province in their previous petitions and temporarily postpone the implementation of the tax collection until it is reviewed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, in order to comply with public opinion and demonstrate legal credibility. We await instructions with utmost urgency. Respectfully, Chambers of Commerce of Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Jiangyin, Jintan, Guazhou, Donghai, Chongming, Taixian, Yancheng, Haimen, Jiangyan, Pixian, Hai'an, Suqian, Liuhe, Nanhui, Liyang, Huai'an, Changshu, Gangshan, Dongtai, Wuxi, Nantong, Suining, Yaowan, Shengze, Wujiang, Yizheng, Xinghua, Yilin, Kunshan, Peixian, Huaiyin, Taixing, Wujin, Sishui, Xiaoxian, Wuxian, Yixing, Hushu, Gaoyou, Lishui, Dangshan, etc.</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Command Headquarters Appoints a Military Judge: The Songhu Pacification Zone Command Headquarters, in view of the active suppression of bandits, although the ringleaders Xu Tianxiong, Xu Fusheng, and Wang Qiming (who were executed in Xincang Town today) have been arrested and brought to justice, the interrogation of their accomplices is very extensive. Therefore, Jin Puren has been appointed as the military judge of the headquarters and has already taken office.</p>
<p>Approval for the Levy of Funding for Universal Education and District Projects: As the county previously found the funding for universal education and district projects insufficient, it convened meetings to decide to request the levy of mu [unit of area] taxes to provide financial support. The Finance Department, based on the situation, forwarded the request to the Provincial Government, which submitted it to a committee meeting. The committee resolved that the mu tax for universal education would be levied at 2.4 li [monetary unit] and the district project fee would be levied at 1.2 li, both collected during the busy season of the 20th year [of the Republic]. The order was relayed by the Finance Department to the county, and County Magistrate Jin specifically instructed the Finance Bureau and the First District Office to inform and direct the First District to inform all districts accordingly.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Request to Prohibit Foreigners from Purchasing Cocoons in the Interior: The silk, yarn, and satin industries of Suzhou, noting that when fresh cocoons were on the market last year, Japanese merchants infiltrated the interior, bribed villagers in various places, and used the names of Chinese people to apply to the Construction Bureau for cocoon permits, causing the fresh cocoons of Suzhou to be almost entirely absorbed by Japanese merchants and shipped abroad, resulting in a monopoly of the cocoon market. Due to the resulting shortage of raw materials, the number of shutdowns and unemployed workers increased daily. Now that fresh cocoons are about to be on the market, they have specifically submitted a request to the Construction Department to order the Wuxian Construction Bureau to investigate and verify that applicants for cocoon permits have actual workshops before issuing them and to strictly prohibit foreigners from infiltrating the interior to privately purchase cocoons. Scheduled to Conduct Ship Registration: The Wuxian County Government will conduct ship registration starting on May 1st and will complete it within one month. The method is as follows: Vessels carrying 100 dan [unit of weight] will be charged 3 jiao [monetary unit], vessels carrying 50 dan will be charged 2 jiao, and vessels carrying less than 50 dan will be charged 1 jiao. Very poor small boats will be exempt from charges. Any extortionate demands will be subject to denunciation.</p>

Kamikura Yuichi, a Japanese national of Yonghe Foreign Firm, No. 9 Guangdong Road, Shanghai, aged over twenty, visited Shanghai with five male and female friends from Nagasaki, including Tomio Seitaro, Inatada Nana, and Sugie Haruko.

While passing the Postal Branch Office on Hulong Street, a rickshaw driver swerved to avoid an empty rickshaw parked there, lost his footing, and tripped, throwing Kamikura Yuichi out of the rickshaw and onto the ground. He lost consciousness on the spot. The news spread far and wide, and many people gathered to watch. The relevant public security branch office then called Western doctor Zhang Buxiong and traditional Chinese doctor Li Yunzhi to the scene, who tried their best to provide treatment, diagnosing it as cerebral anemia caused by fatigue and shock from the journey. He was carried to the post office and stood upside down for an hour and a half before regaining consciousness. Kamikura remained in Suzhou for treatment, while the rest of his companions returned to Shanghai at 3 PM that afternoon.</p>

He also had two apprentices, Xu Heshang and Huang Hunshi. Wang Yingpei suddenly had a bizarre idea. He instigated his apprentices to commit theft while Li Qiufu's wife, Mrs. Li Wang, was out the day before. They stole 50 yuan in paper money from a drawer. At the same time, he also ordered Xu Heshang to soak newspapers in kerosene and set them on fire downstairs, intending to cover up the traces. The smoke filled the air and became unbearable. Neighbors carried water to put out the fire, preventing a major disaster. When Mrs. Li Wang returned home, she found the charred kerosene-soaked paper downstairs and became suspicious. She questioned Wang Yingpei and his apprentices Xu Heshang and Wang Hunbao. She found 45 yuan in paper money and one yuan in cash on Huang Hunbao. Mrs. Li Wang, with conclusive evidence, immediately reported it to Bao Songfu, the district head of the district, who sent the three arson suspects, Wang Yingpei, Xu Heshang, and Huang Hunbao, to the county government to await transfer to the County Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Amusing News of an Absurd Rumor: Recently, for some unknown reason, a rumor has spread in the city that the construction of bridges on the Chengxi Road requires the souls of one thousand children to succeed.

The wording is vulgar and laughable. As a result, peach trees have become unlucky. The previous night, two trees in Zhongshan Park were stolen. Children in the city all wear a small peach wood tablet around their necks. Chen Dun, the head of the Public Security Bureau, learned of this and was deeply saddened by such ignorant and superstitious actions in this era of bright daylight and party rule. He specifically ordered that they be banned.</p>

<h3>The Horses of Hengyang</h3>
<p>— Yi Fu</p>
<p>Hengyang, located south of Dongting Lake and north of the Five Ridges, is a place where outstanding individuals are born. In the late Ming Dynasty, Wang Fuzhi became famous for his Confucian scholarship. During the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, Peng Yulin was known for his military achievements. In recent times, Zeng Nongran has become famous at home and abroad for his calligraphy and painting. Among the rising stars, the ones I know are Ma Junzong and Huo Jun. Both were sons of prominent families, intelligent and exceptionally talented. Due to the suspension of the imperial examinations, they began studying at schools at a young age. As young boys, they were respected and loved by their teachers and friends. With a collection of books at home, they devoted themselves to studying and researching. Even before reaching adulthood, the name "Little Ma" was already well-known in the district. Near the district's outer city wall was the Dongzhou Academy. Since the founding of the Republic of China, all the academies had been closed, except for Dongzhou, which was preserved because Wang Xiangqi was the principal. Many candidates who had taken the imperial exams attended the academy. When Ma Junzong was sixteen or seventeen, he submitted his examination paper and was accepted. On the day of the ceremony, the group considered him too young. They said to the headmaster, Xiangqi, "Let's try him out." During a test, Ma Junzong wrote an essay. Xiangqi praised and commented on his paper, saying, "Its beauty is comparable to the maple leaves of Dongting Lake." The entire academy was impressed. When Xiangqi died, Ma Junzong felt that he had started studying too late to make significant progress. He didn't dare to consider himself a disciple of Xiangqi. In his early twenties, he traveled to Jiangnan and taught at various universities in Nanjing and Shanghai, upholding a balanced view while the new banner of literature was being unfurled. Students recorded his lectures and compiled them into a book called "An Outline of Literature," published by the Commercial Press, which is still popular today. Ma Junzong humbly said, "Writing is a small skill; it's not the most important thing. How can this be considered learning?" He then followed Zhang Taiyan of Yuhang to study philology and completed a "General Theory of Phonology," "Treatises on the Classics," and "Case Studies of the Philosophers of the Zhou and Qin Dynasties," which will be published in succession. He usually doesn't easily show his writing to others. Those who have seen his works praise them. Zeng Chongbo, the master of the Huan Tianshi Studio from Xiangxiang, who prided himself on his talent as a sacred child, never acknowledged anyone. He once saw Ma Junzong's writing at Zeng Nongran's place and was amazed, saying, "This is the Northern Dynasty's Li Daoyuan and the Southern Dynasty's Ren Fang!" Chen Sanli of Yining also said, "When I first met Zong Huo in Baimen, I only knew that he studied the classics and elementary school. I didn't expect his writing to be so profound and elegant." Nongran said, "The style of Junzong's writing mainly lies between the Jin and Song dynasties." This is how he was praised by the elders. Ma Junzong also studied calligraphy with Nongran, capturing the spirit of "Crane Inscription" and "Black Girl." He was especially proficient in clerical script, practicing "Liqi," "Huashan," "Xia Cheng," and "Yiying," leaving no stone unturned. His running script had a refined and elegant style. However, Junzong was busy with teaching and diligent in self-study, so his calligraphy could be obtained by those who requested it, but his writing was not easily obtained. Some people advised him to wait for a higher price, but Junzong said, "Writing cannot be sold; selling writing only leads to disaster." Calligraphy is already sold by many in modern times; why compete to do the same? Someone said, "Selling writing and calligraphy, as Du Gongbu said, is for a righteous purpose. Why must Junzong not be like the ancients?" Junzong smiled and declined. Recently, I heard that someone has started acting as a broker for Junzong, so those who want to obtain Junzong's writing should bring gold to pay. They should all be satisfied.</p>
<h3>Elegant Dishes of Spring Cuisine</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yu</p>
<p>▲ Peony Turtle: Turtle meat is best when it is neither too large (which makes it tough) nor too small (which makes it lacking in fat). The turtles caught during the peony blossom season are both fatty and tender. The Wu people call them peony turtles.</p>
<p>▲ Yellow Croaker: The "Zheng Zi Tong" refers to the stonehead fish, also known as the yellow croaker, which is the yellow fish of today.</p>
<p>▲ Crystal Shrimp: In February and March, the shrimp in the clear water rivers are transparent inside and out. The Wu people call them crystal shrimp.</p>
<p>▲ Rapeseed Flower Fish: The sea bass caught during the rapeseed flower season has the freshest taste. The Wu people call them rapeseed flower fish.</p>
<p>▲ Thousand Gold Vegetable: This refers to lettuce shoots. According to the "Qing Yi Lu," when the envoy of Gao Kingdom came to Han, he sought out its seeds, which were rewarded handsomely, hence the name "Thousand Gold Vegetable."</p>
<p>▲ Swallow Bamboo Shoots: According to the "Bamboo Shoot Records," swallow bamboo shoots are purple in color and sprout when swallows arrive. This refers to the swallow-coming bamboo shoots of today.</p>
<p>▲ Red-Beaked Green Parrot: This refers to spinach. Legend has it that when Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty made a southern tour to Suzhou and stayed at the weaving bureau, one of the dishes served had this flavor. The Emperor ate it and found it delicious. When he asked for the name, an official did not dare to say the real name, so he knelt down and said, "This is red-beaked green parrot." This elegant name was then given.</p>
<h3>The World's Curiousities</h3>

<p>When Taiwanese aboriginal women are about to give birth, they go to the riverbank themselves. After giving birth, they cut the baby's umbilical cord with bamboo shards and wash the baby's body with river water. Two or three days after giving birth, the women work as usual.</p>
<p>The first and second wives of the King of Siam are his own sisters, because marriage within the bloodline is not considered strange in Siam. Moreover, the King of Siam fears that his relatives will usurp the throne, so he often marries his own sisters as queens.</p>
<p>Most Siamese people wrap a cloth belt one meter wide and three meters long around their waists. Many also wrap long cloths around their heads as hats, which can also be used as parcels when taken off. Some people even wrap stones inside as a kind of protective weapon.</p>
<p>There is a type of native African who is completely obedient to their masters. If the master tells them to water the flowers and plants every day, they will continue to water them even if it rains heavily.</p>
<p>If a baby native African's teeth grow in, and the lower teeth come in first, it is considered very unlucky. If the baby is a boy, he will be killed; if it is a girl, she will be taken back by the mother's family.</p>
<p>When Malaysians want to harm someone, they often make a wax idol of that person and melt it with fire, or pierce the idol with needles. They believe that by doing so, the person will be burned or pierced at the same time.</p>
<p>When Malaysians catch crocodiles, they must swallow three rice balls. They believe that if they swallow the rice balls, the crocodiles will more easily swallow the bait used to catch them.</p>

<h3>Records of a Trip to Huzhou (4)</h3>
<p>— Shen Xingchu</p>
<p>Arrived at 8:45 AM.</p>
<p>▲ Biyan: Abandoning the boat and landing, the guards carried rifles and patrolled up along with the tourists. The distant mountains were stacked with green, vying to greet the guests, and the mountain flowers were charming. Good birds leaned on each other, and the winding path was quiet, fearing that it would end too soon. We walked and rested, arriving at the mountain ridge at 10:15 AM. There was a temple that was quite quiet. Going up the stone steps next to the temple, there was a waterfall called Pearl Curtain, which had a great reputation in Biyan. In the past, when Su Dongpo was the prefect of Wu, he often led his officials to visit it in person. His inscription says, "The pearl curtain wants to roll up the rain from the western mountains, all pouring down like the Milky Way." This is a factual record. Checking Changxing, located in a remote mountainous area, the Twelve Peaks of Bian stretch endlessly, and Biyan is the highest. A thousand-foot-high stone wall stands upright into the clouds. The Pearl Curtain water is located within. Until the opening, the water flows straight down, and the momentum is very rapid, forming a waterfall about thirty feet high. From a distance, it looks like a long white training from the sky, and the gurgling sound continues day and night. The locals often use it to irrigate their fields. Below it is the Abandoning Body Pool. The pool is not wide, and it curves to the northeast, passing through the Great Rippling and entering Lake Tai. Examining the distant source of the Pearl Curtain water, it originates from the Heavenly Rooster Ridge of Biyan, about three miles away. Whenever the yellow plum rains come, the momentum surges, and if the discharge is not sufficient, it will eject from the gaps, and the pearl flies and jade splashes, making it even more spectacular. It is a pity that the location is remote and lacks anyone to care for it, so the natural beauty has long been buried in the wilderness. Recently, it was discovered by the group, and only today did the ephemeral flower appear to witness it. How happy is it? Recently, I heard that the Bianxiang District Committee of Huzhou was ordered to investigate and urgently construct. If it can be updated and expanded, the scenery of western Zhejiang will surely add a lot of color to the lakes and mountains. At 11:00 AM, descended the mountain and borrowed lunch from a farmer's house. Returned by boat at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲Fahua Mountain: Commonly known as White Sparrow, it is a branch peak of Bian. The temple is called White Sparrow Temple, and above it is the Guanyin True Body Hall. The main hall of the temple is bound to catch fire once a year, so there is a saying of "fire burning White Sparrow Temple," and then there is a shadow play of "fire burning White Sparrow Temple." Pilgrims from far and near come and go on White Sparrow Road, carrying incense baskets and wearing yellow bags. Therefore, White Sparrow Mountain is also known as a famous scenic spot in Buddhism. After drinking tea in the reception hall and resting for a while, Monk Doufeng came out to greet us, quite amiable. The evening bell rang five times, and then we descended the mountain and boarded the boat to return to our residence. At that time, there were already thousands of lights.</p>
<p>On the morning of the sixth, the military band of the orphanage and others saw us off at the station. We split into two groups and returned, one to Hangzhou and the other to Mogan Mountain. At 7:55 PM, we took a special train back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of India (27)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 10th, I and Mr. Ma Shilada watched the fish in the park. The fish were each three or four feet long, and many had red tails, forming dozens of teams. They were not afraid of people, and people were not allowed to catch them. The government could not catch them either. Thinking of the West Lake, there is a release pond with many red carp six or seven feet long. I wonder how they are now. This pond is a square, with clear water that can be used as a mirror. There are small boats inside, which are places where university students practice swimming. The parks in addition to the city all have square ponds. I dislike them for being too rigid and inactive, because the park ponds are valued for complexity, not for rigidity. Although the scale of the parks in China and Nanyang is large, they are ultimately too rigid. This is probably why Westerners have a movement to imitate the Chinese garden style. Next, a strange person came, wearing a thick, long wool robe, barefoot and wearing shoes. His hair was all white, and the hair behind his head was tied into several small braids hanging down like grape bunches. I estimated that he was at least seventy years old. I was very curious about the scene of his hair hanging behind, but unfortunately I didn't use a camera to take a picture of it. Thinking only of the Dream of the Red Chamber, Jia Baoyu's small braids were divided into many small braids and tied into a large braid, which can be compared, but one is a young master and the other is a Taoist. This old man was something Mr. Ma Shilada taught. Seeing his appearance, he quickly greeted him with respect, saying, "There are many saints in our country, and we must respect them." Then he went forward and spoke with him, not knowing what he said. On the next day, he told me that he had invited the immortal to his home, and the whole family performed salutations and offerings for him. After that, the immortal still went to the Ganges River and lived by sitting and sleeping by the river without luggage. This old immortal was already ninety years old and had walked through Siberia, Chinese Central Asia, and recently came down from the upper reaches of India. I asked what he said. Mr. Ma Shilada replied, "It is not something you can understand, mostly words connected to the gods." Indians consider the Ganges River to be a sacred river. I wanted to use the phrase "wash feet in the Ganges River" in a poem, but an Indian friend said that it was greatly inappropriate because the Ganges River is a sacred river, and this could not be used. But Xin Han Jun said that he could not praise the water of the Ganges River very much because it was very turbid, so the Ganges River was only a holy place historically. I asked about the source of tap water and said that it was Ganges River water. I drank it, and the taste was not very sweet, but it was also drinkable. Ordinary city people all drink this water, while rural people can only drink natural Ganges River water. I believe that all science, philosophy, and religion have failed to solve the problems of human life, so Confucius had the sigh of "men are not as good as birds," which is still true today. Immortals, saviors, and inventors are all no better than birds on the battlefield.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 13th, there was a meeting in the lecture hall, and I listened to it. Many photos were shown to the public, taken of buildings and antiquities from various places, which were sculptures of ancient customs and biographies, including scenes of dramatic male and female performances. The faces of the men were extremely fierce, while the female images were beautiful. There were also many ancient Buddhist relics, which were extremely rich, some obtained in Madeira and others obtained in various places. I think that in the past, Buddhism in the five provinces of India was popular for a time, so statues were made to record it. If you want to study ancient history and the rise and fall of Buddhism, you must learn Sanskrit and study the statues of various places to understand. There was an image carved by Devadatta using several mad elephants to harm Buddha's affairs, which was vividly visible. One person had already been trampled under the elephant's feet, and the Buddha brushed the elephant with his finger, and the elephant fled. From this, it can be examined that there was indeed this myth at that time, so this event must have happened to be able to fit. But I dare not lightly ask if the Buddha was human, how could he make the elephant run away by pointing at it with his finger? Is it really a supernatural power? But the lecturer was not a Buddhist, but a historian. One thing that was strange was that I saw that he had many large photographic books, which were published and printed in England. It turned out that the Indians had searched for ancient relics in various places, hired people to translate them, and printed them. I observed that many ancient images of Indian philosophy, Buddhism, and various ancient images of China were published in England. In the future, if you want to study Chinese studies, you must go to England. People from Myanmar and India said that our gems and pearls are all exported to Europe and America, and we do not know that the various images of Buddhism, such as the Thousand Buddha Map seen at Yangon University, the colorful Dunhuang Grottoes, are circulated and collected by Europeans and Americans more than we treasure them. If they were in China, they would never be seen. Why can't Chinese Buddhists organize associations, raise funds, and send people to study in various places?</p>

<h3>Financial Specie Fluctuates Slightly</h3>
<p>The market began weakly and then shone. Yesterday, the 17th, the specie price was initially tired and then sharp, fluctuating slightly throughout the day, only rotating around three or four taels. However, from morning to night, it totaled thirteen taels. Looking back at the statistics, it rose slightly by two taels. Dealers intended to buy low and sell high, and business was brisk. Speculators each took their own routes. The overseas silver market indeed rose, so the gold price plummeted, reaching almost ten taels. Afterwards, large households aggressively purchased, and because the exchange rate stabilized, the listed price was affected by the silver market, once extended by one notch. It was true that the outside was loose and the inside was flat, so it re-presented auspiciousness, soaring by more than eight taels. In the afternoon, the Indian exchange rate rose. Initially, it was peaceful, but then the buying sentiment from all sides surged, breaking through 715 taels. It is expected that the large amount should fall back this morning.</p>
<p>The opening price plummeted. In the morning, the June opening fell 9.7 taels to 703 taels, because the large amount returned to one-quarter of the high and the silver price rose one-half, because the foothold was solid and China and the United States were buying, and the private telegram also added 3/8. Later, because Yongfeng, Tongtaichang, and others were eager to sell, Yuanheng, Wanxing, Shunli, and others bought in, and it rose to 0.6 taels. Suddenly, Bingxing, Senchangyong, and others sold out, and it fell back to 0.3 taels. At this time, the bank sold 1,375 May English gold. Shortly after, Hengxing came in, and Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, and others followed to purchase, so it had already increased by four taels. There was a hidden one tael until the official announcement was 0.678 taels. Although the listed price extended 0.25, the specie was reduced by 0.5, and the daily gold fell by 0.25, which was not a concern, because the buyers were not silent. Only the internal English gold remained settled at 0.75. Afterwards, because Yongheng and others invested, it was suppressed to 5.7 taels. After that, various numbers enthusiastically sold off, such as Changsheng, Yongcuichang, Yongqianchangxiangfuchang, Yuanhengyuanmaoyong, and the Dalian gang, and others joined forces to come in, and English gold was also good. Each firm absorbed 0.6875 until 10:20, which was 0.89 taels. After entering, Hengxingyongheng sold again and again, so it softened. When it was about to reach 11:00, it fell to 0.45 taels. Shortly after, Fuchangyuanheng, Tongtaichang, Tianfengyong, and hedging, etc., all competed to purchase, causing the price to suddenly peak, rising seven taels. At noon, it reached 11.8 taels, but Hengxing resold and closed the market, retreating to 10.05 taels, but the people seemed hesitant, so the price drifted uncertain. The bid price was changed to 765 taels, counting 58.9 taels to 54.5 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon progressed calmly upwards. In the afternoon, the market heard that the price was 10.05 taels, and the buyers continued to rise to 12 taels. Then, because the Indian exchange rate increased by two annas, it reached a small 10.2 taels. In an instant, it increased to 13.5 taels. Tianyuyongqianchangxiang, etc., bought in. Afterwards, Hengxing came out and suppressed a little more than two taels. At 2:30, it was 10.08 taels. After that, the market situation was very good, because a large household, Wu, was chasing up, and various firms, such as Changsheng, Yuanhengfuyu, Fuchangdadecheng, etc., all bought in. In addition, English gold was increasingly firm, and Huabi Sanbing Zhejiang, etc., ate up June 5625 to 625. The people's hearts were consolidated, and the price rose calmly by 5 taels. At 4:00, it was calculated to be 15.7 taels. At 4:89 taels, it returned to 15.8 taels. Dadecheng and others had a strong buying intention, but Yuanmaoyongheng and others had sell-offs. When the market closed at 4:30, it was calculated to be 14.9 taels. Compared to the day before, it increased by 2 taels. Practiced again and again, it picked up to 5.12 taels, and re-did more than 4 taels. The maximum price for the whole day was 15.8 taels, and the minimum price was 0.3 taels, with a difference of 12.8 taels. The item opened in the morning at 0.45 taels, closed at noon at 11 taels, and closed the market at 15.2 taels. The bid price was suppressed by a small 50 taels, and the account was registered at 0.9 taels to 11 taels. The water supplement was 0.5 taels to 0.9 taels.</p>
<p>Speculation trends were different. The transaction statistics of various numbers, Cuichangyongqianchangxiangshunliwanxingchengfengyongfuchangfuyuyuanheng, etc., all came in, and Taichangyuan Dafu Taihengdadechengzhifeng Yongshi had occasional withdrawals. Yonghenghengxingyuanyuanmaoyongyuancheng, etc., all came out. Hengxing first came in and then came out. In the afternoon, Cuichangyongchangshengyongtianyuyongfuyu, etc., all came in (some were buying on behalf of Wu). Dadechengqianchangxiang came in more and came out less. Hengxingyuanhengxingyuanmaoyongzhenchangxiang all came out. Fu Taiheng Yiyuyuhe Taifengchengyifengyong and other Yongren were not few. Guangdong gang bought in 400-500 strips and altogether came out more than 1,000 strips. The Dalian gang came out more than 2,000 strips and then came out 800-900 strips.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Strong on Surface, Level Underneath</h3>

<h3>The Yarn and Flower Yarn Market Still Remain in a Soft Situation</h3>
<p>The trend of the yarn market is still tired, because the situation of overseas flower yarn is still depressed, and the decline of three-product yarn is particularly serious, so people's hearts are not good and the market situation is weak. However, although the sales of present yarn are not developing in large quantities, the sporadic transactions of various gangs are still uninterrupted, so the market price of present yarn is still firm. The asking price for fine yarn is still high, and retail households unanimously sell short standard yarn. Because the sales period for present yarn is declining in the future, the large households still do not relax, and the multi-party and short-selling parties still hold on to each other strongly.</p>
<p>The human standard is loose and falling. The human standard in the afternoon is due to the flat and tired American cotton, and the three-product yarn has fallen again, causing people's hearts to loosen and the selling atmosphere to be more intense, with each falling eight or nine cents to one or two taels two or three qian. The transaction was calculated to be 3,200 packages. It was found that Changfeng sold 800 packages, Heshen 450 packages, Gongtai 400 packages, and Gengfeng 1,500 packages. Rongxing bought 1,700 packages and Baoji 600 packages.</p>
<p>Yilong 800 packages. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Initial Weakness Followed by Stability in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market experienced a morning decline followed by a midday surge, but the overall trend remained subdued due to the lackluster performance of overseas cotton markets. Consequently, most participants held a bearish outlook. However, Japanese traders maintained a strong bullish stance, focusing on hedging strategies, as spot goods were scarce and sourcing remained difficult, leading them to hold firmly to their positions.</p>
<p>The Han Standard market was generally flat. The pre-market opening for Han Standard was influenced by mixed movements in U.S. cotton prices and a rise in silver prices coupled with a decline in the gold market, resulting in a weakened market sentiment. Prices fell by one or two cash units. In the afternoon, spot prices followed the Shanghai market's recovery, rising by one or two cash units. The total daily trading volume amounted to 48,500 bales. Sales included 1,000 bales by He Shen, 1,100 bales by Gong Tai, 1,600 bales by Jin Feng, and 1,900 bales by Yu Chang. Purchases included 1,600 bales by Rong Xing, 1,400 bales by Tai Xing, 4,300 bales by Geng Feng, and 2,000 bales by Chang Ji. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton Demand: Absolutely No Spot Cotton Trading, No Transactions, and a Shortage of Supply</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Yarn Prices Decline More Than They Rise</h3>

Futures prices fluctuated between gains and losses of one to three points. Spot prices remained unchanged. Both U.K. cotton futures and spot prices increased by one point. Egyptian cotton spot prices decreased by ten points. Indian cotton was firm due to higher opening prices in Liverpool.

<h3>Grain: Rice Market Stable in the South, Declining in the North</h3>
<p>In Zhabei yesterday, ships from various provinces arrived around the 30th. Sales of early white japonica rice were extremely sluggish, and prices had to be lowered by half a jiao. However, one ship with special japonica rice opened surprisingly high at 12.35 Yuan, but this type of goods was very scarce. Subsequently, around noon, sales of mid-grade white japonica rice suddenly improved, and the market slightly firmed, resulting in a minor gain of about a jiao. Thin early rice goods were scarce and sales were slow, lacking any change. Yangxian rice saw weak buying interest, and the market continued to decline by half a chi to one chi. However, some top-quality goods in the market were priced as high as 11.78 Yuan per unit, but this price cannot be considered as a standard. Duzi rice and Shanghai rice were dull and saw few transactions. The overall market softened slightly by a few points. Sales of white yuan rice were balanced and remained flat, but special high-quality goods saw a significant price increase.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai yesterday, between the 20th, goods from the river reached. Sales on this street are commonly normal. The scattered sales of white japonica rice from Suzhou machines are especially brisk, while the stock in warehouses is sluggish and prices are commonly stable. Thin early rice from South provinces arrivals are not thick, sales were especially sluggish. Only a few merchants inquired, but the price are keeping its original plate. Yang Dujian rice trends were floating with high priced were rare and in high demand, but lower priced was stagnant and in short supply. Fortunately, the goods were scarce, there was not much increase or decrease. Yuan Yin Hua was increasing and each parties focused on high quality goods with Special Yin Hua was above 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Trend Softens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the morning and afternoon opening sessions in the flour market saw an overall downward trend. The quotation for foreign wheat retreated slightly by one or two jiao, leading to a weaker market sentiment. A more significant factor was the reduction in spot sales in Tianjin, with only twenty to thirty thousand bags traded daily, indicating a sluggish market. Consequently, Tianjin merchants were again offering standard flour for sale, totaling approximately ten thousand bags in the morning and afternoon. This contributed to a shift in sentiment among most participants, and limited mill sales ultimately resulted in lower prices. It is expected that this type of pricing will fluctuate. In the end, the price for the current month decreased by 7.5 li compared to the previous day, the May price fell by 2 fen, the June price fell by 1.5 fen, the July price fell by 1.75 fen, the August price fell by 1.5 fen, and the September price fell by 1.25 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Show Signs of Weakness Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a sluggish trend in both the morning and afternoon opening sessions. With foreign wheat quotations retreating slightly by one or two jiao, many floating investors took the opportunity to sell. Prices seemed uncertain, but if flour sales were brisk, further declines would be unlikely, as the cost of future foreign wheat would be difficult to reconcile with expectations, potentially suppressing prices temporarily. In the end, the price for the current month decreased by 3 fen compared to the previous day, the June price fell by 4 fen, the August price fell by 3 fen, and the September price fell by 6 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Old Coarse Sugar and White Grades Firming Up</h3>
<p>Shanghai Market Reverses, Falling by 5 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market news from producing regions indicated that Cuban spot sugar prices remained unchanged, while New York futures prices for all grades fell by one point each, except for the March contract for the following year, which fell by two points. Javanese spot sugar prices remained stable with no fluctuations. Trading on the public market (Gonghui) in Shanghai turned lively, although buying interest seemed to wane. The asking price for Dutch 24-grade coarse sugar and ordinary white sugar remained at 10.05 taels, but demand was quiet. Later in the market, high-quality goods were traded at 10.055 taels, leading to slight transactions for ordinary goods at 10.045 taels. However, with both sales and purchases sluggish, the market remained stable. The market for 20-grade medium white sugar at 9.90 taels was also brisk, although it had fallen by 5 fen compared to the previous day. Although demand for Japanese sugar was not strong, limited inventories supported strong market sentiment, and sellers were holding firm. The asking price for N-mark sugar remained at 10.05 taels, YT-mark at 10.04 taels, YP-mark at 10.08 taels, YRO-mark at 9.95 taels, SH-mark at 10.0075 taels, and TM-mark at 10.01 taels. Transactions were limited, but the market remained stable. The grading market saw Nanyang Factory offering over a hundred bags of Grade 1 Binghua Qing (Ice Flower Green) sugar at 9 taels. Sales of Bing (Ice) sugar from the same factory were also moderate, with Grade 1 priced at 13.4 taels and Grade 2 at 13.3 taels. Although demand was scarce, there were rumors of other factories raising prices by 1 qian, so the market remained firm. Zhenxiang Trading Co., which had previously offered old coarse white sugar at 10.01 taels, suddenly stopped selling, indicating potential price increases.</p>
<h3>Dried Seafood: Scarce Domestic Fragrant Mushrooms See Price Increases</h3>
<p>Fragrant Mushrooms: Arrivals of domestic mushrooms have decreased in recent days, and rising prices in production areas have made sourcing more expensive. Consequently, merchants have tightened their holdings, and sellers have gradually raised their asking prices. Yesterday, high-quality large pieces were sold for 205 taels, standard grade for 180 taels to 172 taels, and lower grades for 140 taels. Small-scale transactions were also very active, with large dealers such as those from the Guangdong province experiencing strong sales. The market is expected to rise further.</p>
<p>Dried Bamboo Shoots: Osaka goods saw reduced sales due to high price, and despite the arrivals, they were already exhausted. The listing price of the plum brand was 350.03 taels. Those in the trade were not willing to take in the stock. Jiangxi goods were sold for 260-270 taels and the sales from provinces were very efficient.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Black Fungus Sales Sluggish, Market Weak</h3>
<p>Black Fungus: After a previous rally in the Hankou market, black fungus prices had briefly firmed, but sluggish sales in various provinces in recent weeks have led to a renewed weakening of the market. Ordinary assorted fungus is selling for no more than 90 taels, while higher quality fungus is selling for 91-92 taels. Top-grade branded fungus is selling for 94-95 taels, with lower grades at 90 taels. High-quality auxiliary fungus is selling for 150 taels. Sales to Guangdong and Hong Kong are sluggish, and the market remains flat.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: European and American Silk Markets Remain Stable</h3>

All prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Firms: European Sales Continue Smoothly</h3>

Road branch needle eyebrows were sold for 32 taels, but because the country side price was not ideal, needle eyebrow was sold at an extremly low price.</p>
<h3>Metals: Corrugated Iron in High Demand in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tinplate Orders Exceed 3,000 Boxes</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tianjin dealers such as Lao Zhong Ji, Juxingcheng, and others actively sought corrugated iron, causing standards to surge due to limited supply. Number 24 iron was selling for 15.25 taels, Number 26 for 16.25 taels, and Number 28 for 17.25 taels. It is reported that orders totaled as many as 4500 pieces. Other merchants are also interested in procuring, so prices are expected to continue to rise. Due to insufficient supply, tinplate standards have been raised. Goods from the Company of United Steel can be sold at 35 taels. English iron, like 90 pounds and 100 pounds are all trending high to about three or four qian. Each fellow company give powder to buy regular order. The overseas order set for the market yesterday was 3000 boxes and the British price was 15s9p and American price was 4.5 dollars.</p>

Yesterday, Yang Guifei was priced at 3.8 qian, Qingguan Jing at 3.75 qian, and Meilanfang at 3.75 qian, with active purchasing by local merchants. White crepe silk is weakening. Straight tribute cloth, including Mo Qianshan and Lieyan brands, are not performing well. Straight tribute satin remains quite firm due to limited spot goods. Yesterday, Tianci Caiyuan was priced at 4.05 qian, Gucheng Hui at 3.9 qian, Diyi Gong at 3.5 qian, and Sanyou Tu at 3.3 qian. Shiledao fine cloth is also seeing slightly brisker sales at 9.35 taels. Stocks of wool silk cloth are very low, and orders have been gradually increasing in recent days. Yesterday, there were large transactions of sesame beaverteen, Huxinting fine beaverteen. Velvet imports from Yuehua have been popular for the past few days, mainly because prices are very high, leading to a consistent search for spot goods. Large and medium patterns have reached 2.1 qian, black flower 2.05 qian. There are also transactions of water wave velvet, printed velvet, and checkered velvet.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Unprecedented Increase in Asphalt Prices</h3>
<p>The Asphalt from last year came from the very rich Western Hubei and Yijing in production but was also indebted to the unstable and common banditry. During the season of autumn and winter, the merchants did not carry money and go so seven out of the ten were stopped. Villagers had to travel more than several hundred lis to sell for money because the traveling was long and also blocked from bandits so they abandoned the job to be lost. There was a lack of harvest because less crops were sold to extract oil was estimated to be 20 to 30 percent. Due to this, the oil count was greatly reduced despite Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui etc. also have the product but it was not enough. By the end of the year, the candle trade was in high demand and Shanghai was an area to concentrate on trades, the origin of the asphalt trade was lost. Shanghai always relies on Shanghai oil for supply and its supplies were exhausted. Luckily it had Zhe, Wan oil came to help and the supply would not stop in the middle. At that time, the upper stream of Chang Jiang and its rivers are empty. By February, the news spread and people could understand that the soap factories were about to use their goods and oil vendors had to sell hundreds of tonnes before being able to refill, but they could not and had a state of panic. The product was scarce and wanted to put in a heavy price, but could not find the supply. The current market has greatly increased over the past two months, it has already risen six to seven times, with news from Hankou that Chongqing has risen to 22.6 taels, Cao Bao bank sold Ping Yi at 23 taels, Macheng oil at 21.4 taels. Its origins are rare and hard to meet demands. The current momentum is expected to increase but Shanghai's current bottom is equivalent to nothing and the vendors have not replenished their goods leading to a high loss. However this spring's trend has never been seen since its beginnings and has reached its highest price in the market.</p>

<h3>Prediction of Elected Representatives</h3>
<p>It is predicted that the city will elect five representatives: one from the Party, one from the labor union, one from the farmers' association, one from the chamber of commerce, and one from the independent professional groups. For the Party, the candidates are Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, and Ms. Pan. Ms. Pan has repeatedly declined, so Wu Kaixian is the most likely candidate. For the labor union, the election results yesterday showed that votes were concentrated on Hou Dachun, making him the most promising candidate. It is said that the members of the farmers' association favor Chen Guansheng. For the chamber of commerce, Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong are the most promising candidates. However, the Ministry of Interior has recently stipulated that one person cannot exercise their citizenship rights in two places, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai has informed Mayor Zhang that he wishes to exercise his citizenship rights in Sheng County. Therefore, Wang Yansong is the most predictable candidate. For the independent professionals, Hu Shuhua and Zhu Yingpeng are currently competing.</p>
<h3>The Eurasia Aviation Route Has a Date</h3>
<p>Official Launch on May 15th</p>
<p>The Route is Determined by the Company's Meeting</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jingcong, the business director of Eurasia Aviation Company, returned to Beijing from Beiping on the Eurasia No. 4 aircraft on the 14th. He stayed in Jinan for one day and arrived in Beijing yesterday morning by train. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited him at his residence. A record of the conversation is as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled Launch: Mr. Li said that after the trial flight of the Shanghai-Manzhouli section of the Eurasia Aviation Company's air route, the head office decided on the 14th that it would be officially launched on May 15th. The number of upstream flights is set at twice a week, on Fridays and Sundays. The number of downstream flights is also twice a week, on Sundays and Fridays. This will allow for connection with the Siberian Railway when the company's aircraft has not yet obtained permission from Russia to fly to Europe via Siberia. The first official flight from Manzhouli back to Shanghai will be on May 17th. It is also scheduled to start unofficially every Sunday from this Sunday, the 19th, with each flight carrying 75 kilograms of mail and 25 copies of each newspaper free of charge. Those wishing to ship newspapers to Beiping or Manzhouli free of charge on April 19th, 26th, and May 3rd and 10th must deliver them to Hongqiao Airport by 4:30 AM on those days to be handed over to the company's aircraft, which departs from Shanghai at 5:00 AM.</p>
<p>Handling Airmail: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00, I went to the Directorate General of Posts to discuss the Eurasia airmail contract with Director Smith of the Planning Department. The main points have been finalized. For domestic mail, the fee is 0.15 yuan per 20 centimeters per 1,000 kilometers. For foreign mail, the fee is 0.2 yuan in national currency per 20 centimeters per 1,000 kilometers. The contract will soon be submitted by the Directorate General of Posts to the Ministry for approval. Once approved, it can be officially signed.</p>
<p>Route Determination: The second trial flight of the Eurasia Aviation route from Beijing via Beiping to Manzhouli was from Beiping via Duolun Dalaifu to Manzhouli. The trial flight found that the route from Beiping to Duolun, about 300 kilometers, has 200 kilometers of flight in the Inner Xing'an Mountains where mountain ranges were clustered, but level grounds were not found in the fields. Dalawifeh's comparative flatness was slightly level. From Dalawifeh to Manzhouli was about 700 kilometers, which was flat though it had few mountains. However, the route was a wildness with no people. After staying in Manzhouli for a day, we flew back to Beiping. We gathered the technicians and judged that the fligth was greatly difficult and there were no way of rescue once there was a danger. We agreed from the fligh via Beiping to Nankou to Duolun and although the journey was winding, it avoided the Xing'an Mountain dangers. From Duolun via Linxi, it had its own route with mountains and flat ground that was more than Beiping to Duolun. From Linxi to Manzhouli was about 775 kilometers and although there were many mountains, it had fewer unpopulated wilderness compared to Dalawifeh to Manzhouli. We suggested the company headquarters that from Beiping to Manzhouli should go through Nankou, Duolun and Linxi for a better arrangement. Wireless Equipment is necessary and has been recommended to start with electricity.</p>
<h3>Various Industry Associations Send Letters to Mayor Zhang, Urging Attention to Business Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Medicine Industry, Chinese Medicine Industry, Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Industry, Woodware Industry, Spring Chair Industry, Biscuit Candy Canned Food Industry, Restaurant Industry, Laundry Industry, Mine Ash Factory Industry, Paint Industry, Bookstore Industry, Color Printing Industry, Rice Industry, Flour Industry, Kerosene Industry, Chinese Grain Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Paper Industry, Transport Customs Declaration Industry, Knitting Industry, Department Store Industry, Refining Industry, Antique Industry, Oil Extraction Industry, Chinese Soap Industry, Advertising Industry, Ham Industry, Bamboo Industry, Shoe Industry, Candle Industry, Domestic Pigment Industry, Cooked Food Industry, Bran Industry, Miscellaneous Grain Retail Industry, Preserved Meat Industry, Ginseng Bird's Nest Industry, Northern and Southern Goods Industry, Fruit and Local Produce Industry, Chaozhou Sugar Industry, Dried Seafood Miscellaneous Goods Industry, Garment Industry, Construction Industry, Home Spun Cloth Industry, Blacksmith Industry, Sauce and Wine Industry, and other 47 industry associations sent a letter to Mayor Zhang yesterday, urging attention to the city's business tax rates. At the same time, they also sent a letter to the representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, arguing reasonably. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Mayor Zhang: Mayor, It has come to our attention that the business tax is intended to compensate for the loss of local abolition taxes. Shanghai has never had income from abolition taxes, and the establishment of the business tax is entirely to supplement the city treasury. Compared to other provinces that have suffered losses from the abolition of taxes and urgently need to find ways to compensate, Shanghai cannot be compared on the same level. Moreover, the Shanghai environment is unique, with the presence of concessions and purely foreign-funded shops. Therefore, to inspire a sense of patriotism among merchants and fulfill the responsibility of universal contribution, it is necessary to seek a reduction in tax rates. Given Shanghai's commercial prosperity, even a very low tax rate would generate considerable revenue. Therefore, the city's industry associations have requested that the business tax rate not exceed 0.2% except where the government has other regulations, and that the collection method be based on the industry as a unit. We have previously read in the newspapers that Secretary-General Yu stated that the Mayor has decided on three principles for Shanghai's business tax: (1) not to burden Chinese merchants more heavily than those in the concessions; (2) not to set tax rates higher than those in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, or to make them lower; and (3) to accommodate merchants' opinions and not to arbitrarily set tax rates. The Finance Bureau Director Tang also followed these instructions and sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that five representatives be nominated to participate in the discussion of Shanghai's business tax rates, giving merchants the opportunity to express their opinions. We deeply admire this approach. However, we have heard that the municipal authorities are now setting business tax rates that often exceed the maximum limits of the general outline and that there is a tendency to collect taxes on goods, which goes against your sincere concern for the difficulties of merchants. Is it possible that Director Cai of the Finance Bureau, being new to the position, is not familiar with the local situation in Shanghai and is relying on personal academic theories or the blueprint of other provinces to implement policies in Shanghai, which has a unique environment? This is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. How can we expect to achieve success? We are compelled to urge you to order corrections, ensuring that all business tax rates, except for those deemed luxury businesses or those that should be banned, do not exceed 0.2% and that merchants' opinions are accommodated as much as possible to promote the implementation of a win-win situation. If the hardships of merchants are ignored and excessive burdens are imposed, then merchants, in order to ensure the survival of their own businesses and the future tax revenue of the country, will find it extremely difficult to allow the financial authorities to exhaust the resources of the market. We have stated our views directly, and we hope that you will understand and strongly support us.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Yansong, Qinghua, Wenqi, Songyuan, Jiaobo, We have sent a letter to Mayor Zhang saying that "...". Please, sirs, consider the heavy responsibility entrusted to you by the merchants, and based on this understanding, fight for our rights. Merchants throughout the city pledge to support you. In addition to sending a separate letter, we are sending this message to you to be taken care of.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Cloth Trade Guild's Suspension of Transport Has Not Yet Resumed</h3>
<p>Because Customs Duties Are Required as Usual</p>
<p>A Letter Has Been Sent to the Chamber of Commerce Requesting Another Submission to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Previously, members of the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Trade Guild received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that the Ministry of Finance had approved the issuance of export duty-free transportation permits by the responsible tax authorities for the transportation of handmade native cloth (i.e., cotton cloth). However, the customs authorities have recently continued to levy transport taxes according to regulations. Cotton cloth merchants, facing poor business conditions, are unable to bear this tax burden and have collectively suspended exports since the middle of this month. Yesterday (the 17th), the guild also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting that they telegraph the Ministry of Finance again to approve the exemption of customs duties. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Current Business Situation: The members of the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Trade Guild are promoting native cloth made in Nantong and Haimen areas in Shanghai. Their sales locations are mainly in the three northeastern provinces and Yingkou, Andong, Harbin, and Changchun. Before 1926, annual sales reached more than 200,000 bales, with a total trade volume of approximately six to seven million taels. The transport of this native cloth to various ports is in its original state (i.e., white native cloth). Merchants from various ports purchase it, dye it blue, and sell it to the public. Laborers, villagers, and rural women mostly prefer to buy and wear it. Tonghai cloth merchants, who sell this cotton cloth, purchase cotton yarn locally and weave it by hand. Due to adherence to established methods and lack of improvement, although there are more than 30 specialized export businesses in Shanghai, they all rely on the Northeast as their main market. However, Japanese trade methods are extremely thorough, encroaching on China's cotton cloth sales. According to cloth merchants, the cotton cloth market has seen a large number of Japanese imports to the Northeast for promotion in the last three to four years. Although the quality of the cloth is not as strong as domestic products, the color is better than domestic products, and the sales of Japanese cloth in the market are also huge. As a result, the sales volume of domestic native cloth has suddenly decreased from more than 200,000 bales to 110,000 to 120,000 bales in recent years.</p>
<p>One Tax Per Item: When Shanghai cotton cloth merchants export native cloth, each merchant manually weaves the cloth with cotton yarn purchased from Tangjiaza's Dasheng Yarn Factory in Tonghai. In the past, each box of cotton yarn was taxed 2.75 taels locally. After the native cloth was produced and transported to Shanghai and exported to the Northeast, the tax per bale, including yarn tax, was no more than five taels. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Finance's Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau on February 1st, the cotton yarn tax is 5.8 taels per box, borne by both the yarn factory and the cotton cloth industry. However, cotton cloth exports are duty-free, because the Ministry of Finance stipulates one tax per item. With this, cotton cloth merchants exporting yarn have a passport from the Ministry of Finance and a duty-free waybill from the Unified Tax Bureau, which exempts them from paying taxes at customs. However...</p>
<p>Customs Duties Are Still Collected: Shanghai cotton cloth merchants have already suffered from heavy cotton yarn tax burdens, and business has declined compared to previous years. Therefore, after the cotton yarn tax is paid, the customs duties should be exempted based on the principle of "one tax per item." After receiving approval from the Ministry of Finance, the customs authorities should immediately stop collecting taxes on native cloth. However, cotton cloth merchants still have to pay customs duties when transporting cotton cloth from Shanghai to the Northeast. The cotton cloth merchants are unable to bear this burden and collectively suspended transport on the 14th of this month. As of yesterday, business has not yet resumed.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 16th of this month, we received a joint letter from the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Trade Guild and the Native Cloth Trade Guild regarding the matter of tax-exempt native cloth exports. We recently received a letter from the Unified Tax Administration stating that export permits are allowed, but whether customs duties were previously exempted for sales abroad is still handled by customs according to the usual regulations. This is a misunderstanding. The 'one tax per item' system is stipulated by the ministry. All cotton yarn that has completed the unified tax and is directly woven into finished products is exempt from customs duties. This is clearly stated in the unified tax regulations promulgated by the ministry. The phrase 'shipped abroad' is also a misunderstanding. In summary, whether this native cloth is within the scope of 'one tax per item,' whether it is cotton yarn that has completed the unified tax and is directly woven into finished products, and whether the customs should comply with the ministry's order to exempt customs duties when reporting exports at the Jianghai Customs are key matters for the authorities. Now, the Jianghai Customs is still collecting taxes on exports, citing Hong Kong as 'abroad' and the three northeastern provinces as regions where the unified tax has not been established. The native cloth merchants are extremely worried, and the stagnation will cause irreparable damage as the busy farming season approaches. Therefore, we request that your council urgently telegraph the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Jianghai Customs to comply with the ministry's order to exempt customs duties in order to facilitate exports and avoid stagnation." After deliberation, the council found two points of concern. First, the customs in Hong Kong collect export taxes because the goods are transported abroad. This argument lacks sufficient grounds, as the difference between the new regulations and the old regulations is that goods directly woven from yarn that has completed the unified tax are exempt from any other taxes. Therefore, the transport of handmade native cloth within the country is based on this principle, and the Unified Tax Administration issues tax-exempt transport permits to exempt export customs duties. Whether the goods are transported domestically or abroad, they have completed the unified tax and should be subject to the same principle. Why are the new regulations applied to domestic sales, while the old regulations are applied to sales abroad? We do not know the basis for this argument. Furthermore, machine-made cotton yarn and cloth are exempt from customs duties when transported abroad, and Article 6 of the unified tax regulations also stipulates that the unified tax is also exempt. The state encourages foreign trade with extreme care. Although handmade native cloth may vary in quality, it can open up overseas markets for the country and should also be included in the incentives. Why is the tax-exempt transport permit under the new regulations restricted, inevitably hindering foreign sales and causing excessive discrimination? As for the second point, the three northeastern provinces are regions where the unified tax has not been implemented. If the Shanghai Customs uses this as a reason to collect customs duties on goods transported from that province to Shanghai, it may be self-explanatory. There is no reason to collect taxes on goods transported from a region where the unified tax has been implemented to a region where the unified tax has not been implemented. According to the regulations for tax-exempt transport permits for native cloth, it only states that there is no refund if re-taxation happens when shipping to the un-unified tax area. The Shanghai Customs' interpretation of this matter is inappropriate. We hereby submit the facts and respectfully request that your department investigate and correct this matter for the public good. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Sternly Orders Customs Workers to Resume Work Immediately</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Cartage Fees Still Paid by Merchants</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Trade Guild Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>Extension of Unified Tax for Cotton Cloth and Yarn Denied</p>
<p>The city's customs workers went on strike due to the Cotton Cloth Trade Guild's cancellation of cotton cloth cartage fees, which affected transportation and cotton cloth freight. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the workers to resume work immediately, with the cotton cloth cartage fees still paid by merchants to the firms for distribution to the workers. The Cotton Cloth Trade Guild expressed opposition. The union resolved to organize the reporting of goods today, and the extension of the unified tax for cotton cloth and yarn was rejected. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Order to the Union: Yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Customs Industry Union, limiting the time for resuming work, stating: "For your compliance, this bureau finds that the union's sudden strike over the issue of cotton cloth freight charges, affecting other industries, is inappropriate. In addition to announcing to cotton cloth merchants that a fee of 3.4 cents per piece of fine cloth should be added to the unified tax, the Cotton Cloth Trade Guild should be instructed to act in accordance with the previous practice. You are hereby ordered to instruct all workers to resume work immediately without delay. This order is final."</p>
<p>Order to the Cotton Cloth Industry: Yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Cotton Cloth Trade Guild, stating: "For your compliance, it has been the practice that merchants purchasing cloth pay six taels of silver during customs clearance, of which 5.66 taels are for taxes and the remaining 0.34 taels are for freight charges. After this year's change to the unified tax, the industry suddenly published a statement that freight charges would be the responsibility of the merchants, causing merchants to hesitate, affecting the livelihood of workers, and triggering the strike by customs workers. The actions are inappropriate. In addition to strictly ordering the customs industry workers to resume work immediately to avoid involving other industries and announcing to cotton cloth merchants that a fee of 0.34 taels of silver per piece of fine cloth should be added to the unified tax, you are hereby ordered to instruct all firms to act in accordance with the previous practice of collecting and distributing the fees to alleviate the workers' difficulties. This order is final to avoid disputes."</p>
<p>Public Notice by the Authorities: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued a public notice to cotton cloth merchants, stating: "From now on, cartage fees should still be paid when buying cloth. The strike by customs workers was caused by the Cotton Cloth Trade Guild's cancellation of freight charges. It has been the practice that merchants purchasing cloth from Wusong, Zhabei, Caojiadu, and other places to the Pujiang River have found it inconvenient to transport goods to the boats, so the firms paid the taxes and collected six taels and two cents and one-half of silver per piece, of which 5.66 taels are for the brick tax and customs duties. The remaining 0.34 taels are used by the firms to hire workers to transport goods. This has become a custom, and a few merchants are unaware that the six taels collected per piece include freight charges. This year, the unified tax is 9.73 yuan per piece of fine cloth. The nature of this unified tax is the same as that of customs duties and wharf dues, and freight charges are not included. Since workers still need to transport goods as before, the aforementioned freight charges should still be added. In addition to limiting the industry's workers to resume work immediately and instructing the Cotton Cloth Trade Guild to instruct all firms to continue to collect freight charges and pay them to the workers as before, you are hereby notified that all cotton cloth merchants in the city must comply. From today, when buying cloth from firms, in addition to...</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>...paying the unified tax, a freight charge of 0.34 taels of silver per piece must be added to facilitate the transfer to alleviate the workers' difficulties. This notice is final."</p>
<p>General Meeting of the Union: After receiving the order from the Social Affairs Bureau limiting the time for resuming work, the Customs Industry Union convened a general meeting of representatives from various trades at 8 p.m., with over 150 people attending. Su Houxin was elected as chairman. The chairman reported the contents of the Social Affairs Bureau's order and immediately began discussions: (1) Starting tomorrow (the 18th), the goods of various merchants will be organized first. (2) Starting on the 20th, the reporting of cotton cloth, Western goods, woolens, and piece goods will be resumed. (3) The inspection team will be disbanded immediately.</p>
<p>Extension Denied: The Cotton Cloth and Cotton Yarn Guilds requested the Unified Tax Administration to extend the deadline for the unified tax due to the impact of the strike by customs workers on the inventory of cotton cloth and yarn. Now, a reply has been received from the Unified Tax Administration stating: "We received your joint association's letter yesterday requesting that the time lost due to the Spring Festival holidays and the strike by customs workers be added to the half-month extension period for the tax-free transport and sale of cotton yarn inventory. This administration has submitted a report to the minister for review and has already replied by letter. Now, we have received the minister's telegram of the 11th, stating that the deadline for the tax-free transport of cotton yarn inventory has been extended repeatedly and must not be extended again after April 15th. You must comply with this order and handle the matter accordingly. This letter is to inform you to examine and handle the case accordingly, and to separately inform all manufacturers."</p>
<h3>The Lawyer Election of the County People's Congress Has Been Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Starting at 5 p.m. on April 21st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyer Association's election of representatives to the National Assembly, originally scheduled by Shanghai County Supervisor Yan for 10 a.m. on the 21st of this month, has been rescheduled for 5 p.m. on the same day due to the fact that most lawyers are busy handling cases and appearing in court during the day, making it difficult for them to participate. Supervisor Yan has specifically rescheduled the election for the convenience of the association. A notice has been issued yesterday to inform all parties involved.</p>
<h3>The Newly Elected Executive and Supervisory Committees of Each District Party Headquarters in the City</h3>

The swearing-in ceremony will be held at 10 a.m., and Municipal Supervisory Committee Member Wang Yansong will be the supervisor. Municipal Executive Committee Member Tao Baichuan will represent the Municipal Party Headquarters to deliver instructions. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Shigetsu's Return to His Country Postponed</h3>
<p>His Health Unwell, He is Expected to Recover Soon</p>
<p>Originally Scheduled to Depart on the 21st</p>
<p>Japanese Acting Minister Shigetsu Aoi was originally scheduled to return to his country at 9 a.m. yesterday aboard the Nagasaki Maru to report on the Sino-Japanese legal rights negotiations. However, he suffered a cold and fever the night before, reaching 38 degrees Celsius. Yesterday morning, it had dropped to 37.8 degrees Celsius. After being diagnosed by a doctor, he is expected to fully recover within a few days. Therefore, his departure has been postponed to the 21st aboard the Shanghai Maru. As it was a temporary change, those who went to the Huishan Wharf yesterday morning to see him off made an empty trip.</p>
<h3>British Naval Commander Carey Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>The Soviet Union Requests the Return of the Shanghai Consulate</h3>
<p>The Russian Assistance Association Will Move in to Handle Affairs</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" reported that the Soviet government, through its foreign trade organization, the Russian Assistance Association, has formally requested the German Consulate in Shanghai to return the Russian Consulate building on Huangpu Road, which it has been managing. According to Li Wen, the manager of the Assistance Association, a telegram from Moscow stated that the building's interior and exterior are badly damaged, many appliances and sundries are damaged, and there have been thefts. Mr. Li has forwarded this telegram to the German Consulate and is currently in contact with German officials to discuss the handover. According to reports from the German Consulate, the consul who is handling this matter with Mr. Li Wen is currently in Beijing for business, and the handover of the Russian Consulate building will have to wait until the consul returns to Shanghai. The German Consulate has taken care of the building and the damage mentioned in the Russian telegram is likely a misunderstanding and not a fact. Recently, it has been rumored that the Soviet Union will send a new consul-general to Shanghai. The reporter also inquired with Mr. Li Wen this morning, who stated that this was not the case. After the Russian Consulate building is handed over, it may be moved into by the Russian Assistance Association to handle affairs. The association is currently located at No. 2 Beijing Road, Shanghai, and is engaged in Sino-Russian trade. The Russian Consulate building in Shanghai was handed over to the German Consulate for management in November 1927 when the government ordered the Russian consul to leave the country.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Agrees to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The Matter Has Been Forwarded to the Sports Advancement Association for Review</p>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Emergency Relief Association for Shaanxi Disaster Relief exchanged the following telegrams with Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding fundraising: (1) From Ru Tang, Minister of Foreign Affairs: "The disaster in Shaanxi is severe and requires urgent relief. Since the establishment of our association, we have received enthusiastic donations from all sectors, which is greatly appreciated. However, the disaster area is too vast and the number of victims is too large, making it difficult to provide thorough relief without extensive fundraising. The China National Sports Advancement Association has strong capabilities and many resources, and you, as the chairman, have the power to call for fundraising, which will be very effective. We sincerely hope that you will grant your approval. In addition to sending the donation list directly to your association, we eagerly await your response. (2) From Yu Youren, Zhang Yuejun, Zha Jingren, Zhu Zizhao, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Huang Hanzhi, and Lang Zhihao: "I have received your telegram regarding the relief of the disaster victims.

In addition to instructing all officers to comply, he also convened a meeting of his subordinate officers a few days ago to provide practical instructions, stating that the superiors are earnestly encouraging, and all colleagues should strive to restrain themselves and be diligent in their duties. Emphasize true inspection affairs, pay attention to duties, and do not fail the superior's intention to be diligent in governance. After receiving the order, all officers have returned to their original posts and are earnestly handling affairs.</p>
<h3>The Yixian Warship to Have Trial Runs</h3>

<h3>Further News of the Dachang Collision and Sinking</h3>
<p>Both Parties Begin Negotiations</p>
<p>The Dahua and Dachang vessels collided at the mouth of the Songjiang River. The Dachang sustained severe damage and sank due to the influx of seawater. Details of the incident have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, according to a source from the Dahua company, the other party did not admit their mistake, and the matter would have to be resolved through arbitration in the future. The case will first be submitted to the Shipping Association for review. The Shipping Association is scheduled to hold an executive committee meeting on Tuesday the 21st. The company will submit the case to the association tomorrow (today). If necessary, experts will be asked to arbitrate. Only one of the deceased, carpenter Chen Pigen, has been found. The whereabouts of the others are still unknown as of today. The welfare of the rescued crew members will be provided for, and their salaries for April will be paid in advance. The compensation for the remaining deceased and the crew members' lost property will be determined after the Shipping Association's meeting. The news received yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>Request for Boat Rental: The Dachang vessel was leased to the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company on March 25th for a term of one year at a monthly rental of 7,000 yuan. The first month's rent has been paid. The lease was originally for 1 year. Up to last night (March 13) only 12 days remained of the lease. Yesterday, Zhongxing sent a letter to Dahua requesting the return of 12 days' rent, as well as more than 100 yuan in customs tonnage taxes, totaling more than 3,000 yuan. The company is still considering the matter after receiving the letter.</p>
<p>Correspondence Between Companies: A letter from Ping An to Dahua: "To whom it may concern, our company's Dahua vessel sustained losses yesterday evening at the mouth of the Wusong River due to a collision with your company's Dachang vessel. The accident was caused by the Dachang's negligence. The Dahua vessel is currently docked at No. 8 Wharf in Nan Shi. Please send a marine surveyor to inspect the vessel as soon as possible. Your company will be responsible for all repairs and lost time. A detailed invoice will be sent to you in the future. We await your reply. Sincerely, Ping An Company." Dahua forwarded the original letter to lawyer Xi Yuchang for a reply. Yesterday, they also sent a direct reply: "We received your letter claiming that Dahua was responsible for the collision that sank the Dachang and demanding compensation from our company. This reversal of right and wrong is not worth arguing. Ultimately, the truth cannot escape public opinion. Both parties have conflicting accounts of who is responsible for the accident and how it should be resolved. Please propose a solution for our consideration. Sincerely, Dahua Company."</p>
<h3>Urging Collection of Inland Water Small Wheel Driving Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau has recently received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Office: "It is hereby declared that the issuance of inland water small wheel driving certificates has been implemented in accordance with the previous regulations. All small wheels that have already started operating must stop leading by the end of March. Many days have passed since then, and there are indeed those who have followed the rules to get their certificates and there are still those who have delayed in taking them. If the small wheels are in order to protect their due rights and interests, they should immediately receive them in accordance with the regulations. The chief of the bureau is instructed to forward it for compliance. Those who continue to delay the receipt of the certificate after this urgent collection will be severely punished in accordance with the law." Director Wu has issued orders to all inland water small wheel companies in the county to comply and quickly obtain the certificates without further delay.</p>
<h3>The British Chamber of Commerce Elects President and Vice President</h3>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" reported that the British Chamber of Commerce elected its president and vice president yesterday (the 16th). Marshall was re-elected as president, and Leslie was elected as vice president.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Factories Cable for Dredging Coal Transport</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Factories Union wired Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways the day before yesterday, stating that the association has repeatedly reported to various factories that the coal reserves in Shanghai are only about 150,000 tons, which will be exhausted in an instant, causing great panic. Please find a way to provide relief to maintain industry. Coal's utility is greater than iron. China's coal mines are widely buried and rich, but unfortunately, there is not enough mining, resulting in insufficient supply. As a result, foreign coal takes advantage of the situation and invades, and the loss of rights and interests is heartbreaking. People with insight are promoting domestic coal in the hope of stopping the leak. However, due to the lack of vehicles and inconvenient transportation in coal-producing areas, both producers and sellers are suffering. Previously, due to the unresolved war, vehicles were seized and there was nothing to do but endure the pain and wait. Now that the North and South have been unified and the seized vehicles have been returned one after another, the National Coal Production and Sales Association proposed during the National Commercial Transportation Conference that vehicles should be designated to transport domestic coal, which was passed by the conference and should be implemented accordingly. We urgently cable the leaders to consider that coal is as important to factories as rice and tatami are to the human body and cannot be separated for a day. In the future, please give special consideration to the transportation of domestic coal. The revitalization of industry and the restoration of rights and interests depend on this. The telegram is filled with anticipation.</p>
<h3>Government Issues Commendatory Plaques to Rice Donors</h3>
<p>To Encourage Those Who Enjoy Doing Good</p>
<p>Last year, when rice prices soared in this city, in order to relieve the people's food shortage, the Bureau of Social Affairs requested the City Government to allocate funds to roughly organize a rice price stabilization committee to handle flat-price sales of rice. Over the course of five months, more than 70,000 stones of rice were sold. All deficits, in addition to a portion allocated by the city treasury, were mostly raised from all walks of life. It is now heard that the Shanghai Feng Rice Industry Association, Yan Tongyin Qian Industry Association, Rice Shop Industry Association, and other four entities donated more than 5,000 yuan. The National Government has inscribed the words "Happy to Give and Love to Donate," and the Shanghai Charity Association, Mr. Liu Hongsheng, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Ye Dunhou Tang, Various Associations, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Tongxingtai Company, Xinjie Company, Zhenxing Sui Factory, Jinfar, and other eleven entities donated more than 1,000 yuan. The Shanghai Municipal Government has issued eleven commendatory plaques with the inscriptions "Righteousness Heavier than a Wheat Boat," "Benevolent Oars and Righteous Chestnuts," and "Grace Covers the City's Circle." Zhenkang Jingdetang, Shanghai Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Dalu Bank, Siming Bank, JinCheng Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shen Rendatang, Deruntang, Tea Industry Association, Gold Industry Association, Guangzhao Guild Hall, and other fifteen entities donated more than 500 yuan. The Bureau of Social Affairs has also inscribed the plaque with the words "Benefit the Poor." All of the above awards and plaques are issued by the Bureau of Social Affairs for each donor to claim. It is also heard that all income and expenditure reports regarding the rice stabilization committee have been compiled by the association into a report on association affairs, which is already being printed and will be distributed to all sectors of society soon.</p>
<h3>Chairman Lu of Jiangxi Province Asks for Urgent Telegram</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China济生会(Jisheng Society) received an urgent telegram from Chairman Lu Diping of Jiangxi Province, addressed to the China济生会(Jisheng Society) and 道德会(Moral Society). The telegram reads: "Heaven has sent calamity, and red flames are raging. All the people of Jiangxi are suffering together. Looking around, the starving corpses are scattered on the roads, and the scarred and emaciated look up with sorrow. However, the treasury is empty, and there is no way to help. Although we have repeatedly received the Central Government's order to provide urgent relief, and various parties have responded, the vastness of the bandit areas and the depletion of vitality make it difficult to achieve widespread relief with a mere cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood. I have long known that you gentlemen of the association have embraced universal love and feel the pain as if it were your own. Thinking of the lamenting cries across the land, you will surely bestow the rain of mercy. Seeing that the dry carp is about to wither, you will certainly spread the moisture of warmth. I hope you will grant practical benefits to relieve the hanging upside down. I respectfully call for help on behalf of all the people of Jiangxi and await your jade voice." The association and 道德会(Moral Society) had previously established a shelter in Ji'an City, Jiangxi Province, and had first released emergency relief. However, due to the unrest in the outer county villages, relief efforts were difficult to carry out. It is necessary to wait for the bandits to be gradually cleared before preparing for further progress.</p>
<h3>An Appeal for Disaster Relief in Funing</h3>
<p>The China Red Cross recently received a telegram from the Funing County Charity Committee, signed by Lu Jixi, Xie Feiqing, Yao Shanqiao, Wang Jiying, Jiang Guozhen, Yang Zhiyun, Gu Rulin, and others, appealing for relief. The telegram reads: "The Premier's strategy lies in the survival of the entire nation, and the common people's pursuit focuses on the individual's life. At a time when the whole country is jointly planning for survival, the people of Funing alone are denied the opportunity for life. They are either devastated by man-made disasters or oppressed by natural calamities. If no one provides assistance, life will be difficult to secure. The people of Funing have long lived in barren land. The two years of extreme drought have left them barely surviving. Last year's rain caused disaster, first inundating our crops, and then the bandits raged, destroying our homes. The survivors after the disaster have experienced unprecedented hardship. The state of collapse and displacement cannot be described in words. Thinking of this, tears stream down our faces. Are there not benevolent people and philanthropists overseas who eat with elaborate feasts while thinking of our people of Funing who cannot even get enough to eat all day long? Are there not those who possess heavy wealth while thinking of our people of Funing who have no clothes to wear and cannot get through the year? Are there not those who enjoy themselves in pavilions and terraces, thinking of our people of Funing whose houses are destroyed and cannot find shelter from the wind? Are there not those who laugh and talk around the stove, enjoying the pleasures of family, thinking of our people of Funing who exchange children for bones, and whose flesh and blood are separated? Compassion is inherent in everyone. All people with round heads and square feet do not hesitate to climb mountains and cross seas to carry huge sums of money and donate righteous rice. Moreover, we are compatriots in the same country and share the grand aspiration of helping ourselves and others. Hearing of this extraordinarily heavy disaster, how can we not offer special assistance? Although the appeal of the disaster victims has been made again and again, we cannot bear to push it a third time. Promoting the compassion of Buddhism, saving people still requires saving the future. Therefore, we call for help on their behalf. Even a drop of water is unforgettable. We hope that you will show great compassion and provide as much relief as possible. The remaining people after the disaster will not only be able to maintain their livelihoods but also jointly establish the foundation for survival. It is not only saving all living beings, which is better than building a pagoda of seven levels, but also helping the world, which is enough to last for ten thousand years."</p>
<h3>Jiangshun Crew Falsely Accused of Homicide</h3>
<p>Seamen's Union Telegraphs to Request Case Closure</p>
<p>The China Seamen's Industrial Federation telegraphed the Wuhu Public Security Bureau and the Water Patrol Team Outpost yesterday, stating: "According to a report from the Jiangshun steamship workers, your station dispatched a team with a letter to summon the steamship workers Wu Asheng and others for questioning, claiming that according to Huang Zhangshi, Wu Asheng pushed her husband Huang Changgui to his death in the Tongzhou sea area, and it is necessary to bring the case to trial. However, the alleged time of the pushing to death has been several months ago, which is a false accusation. Please find a way to handle the matter." Regarding this case, a telegram was sent to your station yesterday, urging you not to summon the workers and causing unnecessary trouble. It was also ordered that Mo Zuoming, a staff member of our association stationed in Wuhu, investigate. According to the reply, the military police stationed on the ship confirmed that there was no such thing, and the alleged location was in Tongzhou. According to Article 13 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the Wuhu authorities should not accept the case. Therefore, in addition to sending telegrams and ordering the staff member to handle the matter nearby, we hereby telegraph your bureau to request that you investigate and order the closure of the case. Your station need not summon the workers and cause unnecessary trouble, we are grateful.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Society Implements Crackdown on Child Abuse Tricks</h3>
<p>The China Children's Welfare Association previously sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the French Concession Court, and the Public Works Department, requesting that they strictly prohibit street performers from cruelly abusing children to solicit money. This has been reported in this newspaper, and the authorities have replied that they have ordered their subordinates to comply and prohibit it. It is now heard that the association has found that Liu Qinghai from Jinan, Shandong, is using cruel methods in Zhoujiaqiao, west of Shanghai, such as harming a seven-year-old girl named Liu Shuangxi to solicit money from the audience. At first, it was still light, but as the audience was all coolies with no money, he increased the punishment. If that was not enough, he added extremely difficult and harsh methods. When the association staff saw this, they were filled with anger and immediately reported to the nearby post number 3355, asking them to investigate and handle the matter to prevent imitation and to register the person in detail for reference.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan Mediates Day and Night Bank Debt Dispute</h3>
<p>Wenquan Bathhouse Sealed Off Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Dispute Over Consent Rights</p>
<p>The Day and Night Bank case has recently had disagreements due to inconsistent opinions from creditors. There have been quite a few misunderstandings. Yesterday morning, the Wenquan Bathhouse was also subjected to provisional seizure. According to investigations by this newspaper's reporter, the four volunteer lawyers entrusted by the Municipal Government, Wu Jingxiong, Jiang Yiping, and others, represent more than 3,000 creditors, totaling about 1.5 million yuan. The steps taken were to file a lawsuit with the Special District Court and participate in the French Concession Court's litigation. Because the Gongfa Company's assets in the Public Concession are still managed by the manager hired by Huang Chu Jiu, it cannot win the trust of the creditors. Therefore, it was repeatedly requested that the Special District Court implement provisional seizure to provide security. After approval, the two accountants, Wu and Pan, who were handling the liquidation, believed that the loss was significant and urgently consulted with the four lawyers, requesting them to quickly withdraw the request. The four lawyers put forward two conditions to them: (1) The future proceeds will be distributed equally among various claims. (2) The creditors represented by the four lawyers should have the right to agree on the distribution of Gongfa Company's and Huang Chu Jiu's assets, so that the creditors will not suffer too much loss. The two accountants, Wu and Pan, fully acknowledged (1) and only allowed to put forward opinions for adoption without allowing consent to (2). This matter became a stalemate, and Zhongxi and Wenquan implemented provisional seizure. At the same time, both parties still intend to continue to contact for mediation. The current Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Pan Gongzhan, has scheduled a banquet for the four lawyers, the two accountants Pan and Wu, and representatives of various creditors at Weihaiwei Road this afternoon to resolve the issue of consent. If it cannot be resolved satisfactorily, then only the law will prevail.</p>
<h3>Four Kidnappers Executed</h3>
<p>Two of the Bandits are Brothers</p>
<p>The Bandits Initially Shouted and Screamed</p>
<p>Then Confessed with Regret</p>
<p>The kidnappers Yang Zhengting (also known as Li Zijiao), Li Xin (also known as Ziyu, the elder brother of Zijiao), Li Kepeng, and Lu Fucai broke into Gong Kuiyuan's house at No. 487 Pingliang Road with weapons on November 24 of last year, robbing 188 yuan. They also kidnapped Gong's eleven-month-old boy, Ruxin, demanding 1,000 yuan for ransom. Subsequently, detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station rescued Gong's son and arrested the bandits. After interrogation by the Special District Local Court, they were sentenced to death and temporarily detained in the Western Prison pending execution. Now, according to the Provincial Government's order to execute them according to law, the four bandits were escorted from the Western Prison to the court by the police station at 2:00 PM yesterday. Judge Cheng Shangfeng interrogated them one by one about their last words. The bandits were stubborn at first and shouted and screamed. Later, Yang Zhengting confessed his origin in Hangzhou, his real name is Li Zijiao. There are three brothers in my family, and Li Xin is my elder brother. I am 24 years old. There are still parents, a wife, and a disciple in the family. My brother worked at the Fengtian Arsenal. Last winter, he heard that I was arrested and sentenced to death, and he was extremely angry. He once committed suicide and was saved by someone. He is still working in the factory. My father, Li Shengchang, lives at No. 43 Hengfeng Workshop, Huasheng Road, Yangshupu. Please send a letter to my father and tell him not to be sad and to tell my brother not to know, because I am afraid that my brother will hear the news of my death and commit suicide again. My wife is only 21 years old. Although she gave birth to a son on November 14 last year, I am afraid that she will find it difficult to keep her chastity. She can remarry. The child she gave birth to can be given to someone or disposed of. It is not necessary to keep it in the family to burden the old father. Please also send a letter to my uncle at No. 46 Hengfeng Workshop, please order my cousin Jiang Hewan to take care of my family in the future. There is nothing else to say. Li Kepeng confessed that he was from Yangzhou, 33 years old. Please send the news of my execution to my brother Li Kexiong at No. 110, Lane 8, Puanfang, Yangshupu. Li Xin also requested to send a letter to his father at No. 43 Hengfeng Workshop, telling him not to be sad. Finally, Lu Fucai confessed that he was from Pudong, 22 years old. Please send a letter to my mother-in-law, Zhang, at No. 17 Longren Lane, Pingliang Road, because my wife gave birth to a son on November 24 last year, but she is young and must remarry. Please tell my mother-in-law to inform my wife that if she does remarry, she should be clear about who she marries and not marry someone like me again. Please also notify my brother Zhang Zichao to be careful in making friends in the future. After Judge Cheng finished the interrogation, he ordered the four bandits to be escorted to the execution ground of the Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing in a prison car. The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor led the execution police to the scene to verify their identities and execute them one by one.</p>
<h3>Lu A'gen Sentenced to Death for Kidnapping and Extortion</h3>
<p>Zhou Linsheng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xu Yuying Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison</p>
<p>The manager of Xielong Real Estate Company, Hui Yunfang, at No. 313 Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, had been targeted by kidnappers. On February 8, when the kidnappers went to abduct him, Hui was not out that night. His friend Li Huiqing was kidnapped by the bandits. Later, he was redeemed for 2,000 yuan. However, because the bandits did not get Hui, they were still ambitious and sent a letter to Hui demanding extortion, and they were arrested by the police station. Four male and female bandits were escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu found that Wang Genmei had committed a minor crime and ordered her to be released on 100 yuan bail. Zhou Linsheng, Lu A'gen, and the woman Xu Yuying were still accused of extorting money from three households, including Yuanfengshun Candle Shop, and were detained pending sentencing. Yesterday morning, when the sentencing date arrived, Judge Xu ordered the Zhou and others to be brought forward to announce the judgment. Zhou Linsheng was sentenced to life imprisonment for two crimes of jointly delivering threatening letters and causing damage to others, and sentenced to five years imprisonment for two crimes of jointly attempting to extort money, serving life imprisonment. Lu A'gen was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly delivering threatening letters and causing damage to others, and sentenced to death for jointly kidnapping for ransom, serving the death sentence. Xu Yuying was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for jointly kidnapping for ransom. Wang Genmei was found not guilty. The threatening letter, distribution of stolen money, account book, ink crystal glasses, and iron chain were confiscated. After the judgment, the lawyer of the police station, Ru Bao Yi, stated that he would not appeal against Wang Genmei. Judge Xu ordered the bail bond of Wang to be revoked and she was released.</p>
<h3>Bandit Song Wusheng Tried Again by the French Concession Court for Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Jointly Tried by Six Chinese and French Officials</p>
<p>Awaiting Consultative Ruling to Pronounce Sentence</p>
<p>Chen Xing's four-year-old grandson, Chen Yongkang, who lived at No. 2 Huabaofang, Lagelana Road, Annakin, French Concession, was kidnapped by his maternal uncle Luo Henglin in collusion with Song Wusheng, Yuan Tianming, Bao Zhiming, and others on July 20 last year, hoping to extort a ransom. The French police discovered the case on August 11 and escorted the defendants to the French Concession Court for interrogation. Luo Henglin and Song Wusheng were sentenced to five years imprisonment each and sent to the inland court for interrogation. Yuan and Bao were sentenced to four years imprisonment each and expelled from the concession forever after their term. Because the defendant Song Wusheng disagreed with the judgment, he hired lawyer Gu Jirong to write a letter requesting a retrial. After the Chinese and Western officials approved it, the case was proposed for retrial on September 19. The judgment ordered the revocation of the initial trial ruling and ordered the defendant Song Wusheng to be imprisoned in the Western Prison for four years. Because the French police believed that the defendant Song Wusheng was indeed an accomplice, they believed that the retrial judgment was inappropriate. Therefore, they submitted evidence requesting the French Concession Court to re-examine the case. After the Chinese and Western officials approved it, the defendant Song Wusheng was brought from the prison for interrogation at 3:00 PM yesterday. The Western detective Zachar first stated the reasons, saying that the defendant Song Wusheng was indeed an accomplice in the kidnapping and had a written confession. He requested that the retrial ruling be changed. Lawyer Gu Jirong, on behalf of the defendant Song Wusheng, argued that after the initial trial judgment, the defendant disagreed and applied for a retrial, which has been determined until today. Even according to the Chinese Criminal Law, there is a certain time limit for extraordinary appeals. The police station's request is inappropriate and should be rejected. After consultation between the Chinese and Western officials, it was announced that they would await the consultative ruling to pronounce the sentence. This case is highly valued by the French authorities, so the Chinese officials Zhu Qi, Gong Xiang, and Tang Zaili, together with the French Consul General, Junadu, and Judge Gekedang, jointly conducted the trial to show caution.</p>
<h3>Sir Ho Tung Entertains Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>United Photoplay Service Stars Serve as Hosts</p>
<p>Mei Goes to Hong Kong to Prepare Sound Film</p>
<p>Sir Ho Tung went north from Hong Kong last month and took a detour to Europe. He briefly stayed in Shanghai and closed the door to thank guests. Yesterday, when Mei Lanfang went south from Beiping, he paid a special visit to Ho Tung when he heard that Sir Ho Tung was in Shanghai.

<h3>Bandit Leader Zheng Yushan Escorted to Changshu</h3>
<p>This newspaper has reported that the First Brigade of the Wusong Jiangsu Anti-Smuggling Unit captured Zheng Yushan, the bandit leader who harassed various places along the coast of Changshu. It is now known that Zheng is 58 years old, a native of Funing County, Jiangbei. He is very tall and has an eight-character mustache. His attitude is calm. Those who do not know him would not believe that he has bandit behavior. Zheng has many party members in the coastal area of Changshu. In recent years, he has repeatedly committed rape, looting, and accumulated cases in the Changshu area. The Changshu County Government issued an order to arrest him. Zheng was unusually cunning. Therefore, although many of his subordinates were arrested, Zheng was still at large. In November of last year, the Changshu Anti-Smuggling Camp soldiers of the First Brigade of the Wusong Jiangsu Anti-Smuggling Unit were robbed of five rifles by Zheng and his party. He then kidnapped Zhang Chengqi and Zou Lingxian, wealthy households in Xiyang Town, one after another, extorting huge sums of money from Jiangbei. After the incident, Mao Zhong, the captain of the anti-smuggling squadron, sent detectives to investigate. It was discovered that Zheng and his two sons had committed the crime. Captain Li Huchen immediately reported it to the brigade commander, ordering him to be strictly wanted. Zheng saw that the arrest was very strict, so he secretly came to Shanghai and hid in the concession. Recently, Zheng took advantage of the lax arrest of the anti-smuggling team, so he reappeared and impersonated a water police detective to direct his party members to smuggle along the coast. Squadron Captain Mao secretly reported it without making a sound. A detective was sent to arrest Zheng a few days ago, but his two sons and other party members had already fled when they heard the news. They are still under strict arrest. After Zheng was escorted to the brigade headquarters, Brigade Commander Li Huchen reported it to Song Zi'an, Director of the Jiangsu Anti-Smuggling Bureau. After receiving the report, Director Song sent personnel to join Brigade Commander Li to conduct a rigorous interrogation for several days. According to Zheng's confession, he knew all about the cases of robbing the anti-smuggling soldiers' guns and kidnapping Zhang Chengqi and Zou Lingxian, wealthy households in Xiyang Town. However, he did not admit that he was the bandit leader and blamed his two sons and party members. After verifying the confession, Brigade Commander Li immediately reported it to Director Song. Director Song ordered to escort him to the Changshu County Government for interrogation. Therefore, Zheng was escorted to Changshu by Brigade Commander Li at 9:00 AM yesterday, led by Squadron Captain Liu Zhiyi and four patrol boats with documents.</p>
<h3>Thieving Monk of Taixing Temple Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Denies Bail</p>
<p>The Guangxiao Temple in Taixing County, Jiangbei, is one of the eight famous ancient temples in the south. The abbot, named Pei'an, had previously embezzled over ten thousand yuan of the temple's property. Local gentry repeatedly reported and accused him to the county. The monk fled to escape punishment. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs investigated and confirmed the facts, issuing an arrest warrant. A few days ago, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau also received a confidential order, stating that according to a tip, the monk had secretly arrived in Shanghai and was hiding in the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road in the Public Concession. They were ordered to arrest him. Director Chen, upon receiving the order, immediately assigned the Detective Team to handle the matter properly. Team Leader Lu personally went to the Jade Buddha Temple to investigate and ordered detectives to search in all directions. It was only reported a few days ago that the monk had stayed at the temple for a while, but had moved to the Qingliang Temple's lower courtyard in Xinzha Road's Xin's Garden. They were asked to arrest him immediately. Team Leader Lu personally led several detectives to the temple on the morning of the previous day. Before they even entered the gate, Pei'an came out, getting dressed. The detectives secretly followed him and, when they reached a suitable location, seized him and brought him directly to the team. They reported the arrest to Director Chen. Before long, Buddhist believers heard the news and rushed to Director Chen, requesting bail. Director Chen refused, stating that the case involved a provincial arrest warrant and the crime must be serious. Therefore, he temporarily detained the monk and telegraphed the province for instructions for further handling.</p>
<h3>Hotel Staff and Porters at Tiannan Hotel Obstruct Sealing</h3>
<p>Arrested by the Police and Prosecuted</p>
<p>Yang Wenlai and others invested in opening the Tiannan Hotel at 316 Avenue Edward VII. Business was unusually slow, and recently it had become deserted, with heavy debts and no funds to repay. Various creditors filed lawsuits in the Civil Division of the Special District Local Court, requesting a preliminary attachment to prevent the hotel's shareholders from privately moving assets. The Special Court approved the request. At 10:00 AM on the previous day, court bailiff Xu Mingcha, Russian police officer Boyle Kovsky, and Chinese police officers Gu Ziqiang and He Routing went to seal the hotel with the Special Court's seal. Unexpectedly, the hotel clerk, Qian Jintang, and porter, Cao Shanzhi, obstructed the sealing. Despite explanations, they ignored them. The bailiffs reported to the Zhabei Police Station for assistance. The police chief ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene and arrest Qian and Cao before the hotel could be sealed. Yesterday morning, the police station's lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, filed a lawsuit against Qian and Cao based on Article 142, Section 2, and Article 143, Section 1, of the Criminal Law. Judge Xu of the Special Court directly examined the case. The bailiffs who executed the attachment testified about the obstruction, stating that Qian Jintang refused to hand over the keys he managed, and Cao Shanzhi dared to shout threats. Questioned, Qian stated that the plaintiff was waiting for the hearing in the Seventh Civil Division yesterday morning and rushed back to the hotel upon hearing the sealing news. The police asked for the keys, but they were with the porter, so he couldn't hand them over, and he didn't resist. Cao Shanzhi also denied shouting threats and hired a lawyer to defend himself. Judge Xu verified the testimonies and ordered Qian to pay a 1,000-yuan bail, while Cao was temporarily detained pending sentencing next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Two People Attempt Suicide, Both Rescued</h3>

He had served in the military and was now discharged. He came to Shanghai to seek a living but found no work and was penniless, leaving him no choice but to resort to this. After hearing his statement, District Officer Cheng, moved by his plight, provided funds to send him back home. At around 4:00 PM that afternoon, another person who jumped into the river at the Paotaiwan beach was spotted by the local police station chief, Chang Jiajin, who rescued him. He was taken to the Seventh District for questioning. He identified himself as Huang Fuquan, 26 years old, from Guangdong, residing at 63 Xinkang Lane, Wuchang Road, Shanghai. He had previously worked on a ship and had been unemployed for two years. His finances had become increasingly dire. Rather than waiting for death, he thought it better to die.

<p>Gao Liansheng, a 47-year-old man from Suzhou and the owner of a board shop at 150 Jiujiang Road, near the intersection of Jiujiang Road, recently struggled with poor business and a large family. Life was difficult, and he conceived the idea of suicide. At 10:00 AM the previous morning, he secretly took opium paste.

<h3>Suspect Small Monk in Wanshou Temple Fire Turns Himself In, Detained</h3>
<p>Statement Deemed Untruthful</p>
<p>Held Pending Return of Senior Monk</p>
<p>The Wanshou Temple behind Xiaoyangjing Temple on Lan Ni Du, Pudong, was suddenly burned down on the morning of the 14th of this month at 1:00 AM, destroying two halls of the main temple due to carelessness. After an investigation by the Third District Public Security Bureau, it was found that Longshan, a small monk who had been expelled from the temple for violating the rules, was suspected of arson for revenge. However, he could not be found. Therefore, the incense keeper, Yuan Lianyou, was sent to the General Bureau for handling, as previously reported. It is now known that the senior monk of the temple had gone to Putuo in Ningbo before the incident and had not yet returned. The temple ruins were still guarded by police officers. The small monk, Longshan, suddenly turned himself in to the Third District in the afternoon of the previous day, claiming to be 19 years old. He said that he had a disagreement with his master, Benlai, last October and was expelled from the temple. He then went to the Xiaoshenglin Temple in Zhabei to temporarily stay and chant scriptures for others. The abbot of that temple was named Shouzhen. He claimed that he knew nothing about the Wanshou Temple fire. The district chief ordered him to be detained and sent lead detective Zhang Chunting to investigate whether there was such a temple and whether Longshan had stayed at the temple that night. He later reported that he had searched the Zhabei area and found no Xiaoshenglin Temple. After repeated investigations, it was found that the small monk had no fixed address. On the night of the temple fire, he was playing mahjong with women in a house in the Wu Family Alley on Lan Ni Du until late at night. This showed that his statement was not true. Therefore, he was ordered to be strictly detained pending the arrival of the senior monk in Shanghai for further questioning.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor, Shanghai News, Shen Bao: The article titled "Rental Dispute in Yifeng Lane" published in the local news section of your newspaper on the 15th of this month is inconsistent with the facts. Our office manages the houses in Yifeng Lane not as a whole rental. Rents are unified and set at the end of the year. Since the tenants have been living here, they have been on good terms. However, on February 6 of this year, Zhu Yan, also known as Wen Bo and Chen Qingchang, rented house number 20 in the lane and then established a "Tenant Union" to encourage tenants to campaign for rent reductions and posted slogans at will. On April 4 of this month, our office reported the situation to the Sixth District Police Station (omitted). The City Public Security Bureau not only disbanded the illegal organization but also destroyed all the seals and signs. We are requesting that your newspaper promptly make a correction. Sincerely, Zhi Ping Law Firm Rental Department, April 17.</p>

<h3>Consultation by Mail</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanhe</p>
<p>▲To Mr. Zhao Zhongju, greetings. The periods of your wife are gradually regulating, and the abdominal pain is gradually decreasing. It is still advisable to adhere to the same prescription. As for excessive discharge, reduced appetite, yellowish complexion, thinness, and weakness, she can also take Ginseng and Atractylodes Macrocephala Pill, three qian daily or every other day, with jujube soup or rice water. However, it can only be taken if the tongue coating is moist and the mouth is not dry.</p>
<p>▲To Mr. Lu Tuisi, greetings. Affection between husband and wife lies in the spiritual connection and is not related to the frequency of sexual activity. The ancient saying that upper scholars have different rooms, middle scholars have different beds, and lower scholars have different quilts is precisely to indicate enjoyment without indulgence and to prevent sexual impulses. Given the current situation, please prepare a remedy. You can purchase Baozhen Pills from a larger national pharmacy, take fifty to seventy pills every morning on an empty stomach with light alum stone soup or warm wine, and then have a nourishing breakfast such as eggs, white fungus, milk, or soy milk. This must be done persistently, and you must also be abstinent and have a clear mind and strong body to be effective. This is not like stimulants, which take effect quickly but are very harmful and have many drawbacks.</p>
<p>▲To Mr. Jiang Zemin, greetings. Hemorrhoids that have ruptured belong to surgery, and I only treat internal medicine. However, for pain with pus and no blood, you should take a modified Zhutong Rushen Tang internally. For constipation, Zhutong Wan is the main treatment. For external use, use Ku Zhi powder. A simple method is to eat more raw and cooked water chestnuts and use Sophora japonica to make tea. The residue can be decocted again for fumigation and washing, or use Purslane decoction for fumigation and washing.</p>
<p>▲To Mr. Shi Tianlai, greetings. Lanolin can remove blackness from the face, and pearl powder can also remove freckles and brighten the complexion. If face powder uses lanolin and pearl powder as the main ingredients, it is worth trying. However, dark blackness on the face is not a problem. As long as it is black and shiny, it is a sign of health. An ancient saying says, "Don't dislike being thin when you're not sick," and "Eight or nine times out of ten things don't go as planned." Therefore, having a dark complexion is much better than having a pockmarked face, cleft lip, or even being blind or mute. Fortunately, it is far away, so don't worry about transforming it.</p>
