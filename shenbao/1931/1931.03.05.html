<p>曉得的幾點「國民會議何以在今年召集」中國國民黨第三届中央執行委員會第四次全體會議於民國十九年十一月十二日起開會、至十八日開會、在這個會議當中、决定於二十年五月五日、在首都召集國民會議、本來國民會議、是總理遺囑中所希望於最短期間促其實現的、因爲幾年來一般封建的軍閥·和其他反動份子、相繼搗亂、千方阻難、所以遂稽延到現在、如果中央在那個時局危險的時候、留然召集國民會議、那末所召集的、一定是軍閥政客以及流民的分贜會議、而决决不是總理所要開的和國民所希望召集的、在各地方脫離了軍閥的淫威和壓迫·使人民眞正能發表自己的主張和意見時的國民會議、所以中央在戰亂敉平國勢大定的今年、才來實行召集國民會議、實正適合總理、尤須於最短期間促其實現的遺教、「國民會議與國民大會顯著的分别」或須有人對於國民會議與國民大會的性質、不十分明瞭、容易發生誤會、其實國民會議與國民大會確有分别、其最顯著的不同點有二一·組織不同、二·職權不同、組織上的不同、先就組織說、國民會議是以全國己有的職業團體的代表組織的、其内容如總理當時所定爲現代實業團體·商會·教育會·大學·各省學生聨合會·工會·農會·其同反對曹吳各軍·和政黨·而國民大會則不然、建國大繼第十四條說、「每縣地方自治政府成立後、得選國民代表一員、以組織代表會、參預中央政事、」這樣、便知道國民大會是由每自治縣所選出的代表組織的、此與國民會議的組織不同、己十分明顯了、職權上的不同、次就職權說、本黨主張召集國民會議、目的是在齊一全國國民的心志、以謀中國之統一與建設、對内解决全國民生問題、對外打破列强政治統濟的侵略、這正如總理所言、「民國之命運、在於國民之自决、本黨若能得國民之援助、則中國之獨立自由統一諸目的、必能依於奮鬥、而完全達到、」的意義、所以國民會議、是一個解决目前訓政時期的重要問題的集合、至於國民大會則不然、建國大綱第二十三條說、「····則開國民大會决定憲法而頒佈之、」第二十四條又說、「····即國民大會對於中央政府官吏有選舉權·有罷免權·對於中央法律有創制權·有複决權、」據此、則國民大會的職權、如在消極方面說、乃爲憲法及法律的修改與制裁政府人員失職、换言之、是人民行使政權的最高權力機關、與國民會議　有顯著的不同、「國民會議的重大使命、」我們旣然認清了國民會議和國民大會不同的特性、我們現在可以簡單的、肯定的說、國民大會是國運康泰時候的一個集會、而國民會議、是解决目前中華民族生死存亡的一個重太集合、是達到和平統一永免戰禍的唯一關鍵、中國過去所以不能統一與建設、實在是民生疾苦與列强侵略所交互造成的結果、我們應該趁着這個空前絶後的國民會議、來集合全國國民的心志集中全國國民的能力做一個妥當的解决、以立民有民治民享的基礎、面造成三民主義的中華民國、凡是中國國民、是宜充分注意的、「規定約法」前面一段、是說國民會議的重大使命、其實、在這個隆重會議的當中、我們還應該做一件最重大最要緊的事情、這件事就是要會議中的全體代表、在三民主義的訓政範圍以内、來確立一個中國國民黨和全國人民共同遵守的約法、以期樹立長治久安的宏規、因爲「約」字的舍議、本來是「省約」及「約束」的意思、現在我們很懇摰的希望全會代表切實實把總理全部遺教來省約標出條文作爲政府與人民間的約束、以樹立全民政治的基礎、這是不可不特别提出來的、「全國代表名額」現在國民會議代表選舉法和國民會議代表選舉法施行法、己經國民政府先後頒布、國民會議代表總額爲五百二十名、「本市代表名額」本市應該選舉代表五名、「産生代表的團體」遵五名代表、是由（一）農會選舉二人、（二）工會選舉一人、（三）商會和實業團體選舉一人、（四）教育會國立大學教育部立案的大學和自由職業團體選舉一人、（五）中國國民黨選舉一人、不過上面所說的農會·工會·商會·教育會等各團體都以依法設立的爲限、至於實業團體也應該具備下列的兩個條件、（一）其會員確以資本或技能從事於各種事業的（二）曾經主管機關立案的上面所說的自由職業團體、是包括曾經主管機關立案的新聞記者·律師·醫師·工程師·會計師·所組織的職業團體「代表産生之範圍」不遇各團體的人數非常衆多所以代表産生的範圍不得不有所規定在農會方面的代表、應以本市各區區農會出席於市農會的會員代表選舉之、在工會方面的代表、應以本市各區區工會會員選舉之至於商會和實業　體的代表、應以本市各同業公會和商店會員出席於市商會的會員代表和實業團體的會員選舉之、關於第四欵教育會國立大學教育部立案大學和自由職業團體的代表、應以本市各區區教育會出席於市教育會的會員代表和國立大學教育部立案大學裏的現任教職員、本科學生和自由職業團體裏的會員選舉之、還有中國國民黨的代表一人就在中央提出候選人當中、由本市全體　員在所屬區分部開黨員大會時選舉之上面所說的就是代表産生的範圍、我們在下邊還要說明當選人的標準和資格「當選人的標準」我們旣然曉得這次所召集國民會議的使命、是非常重大、那末出席於這個會議的代表、當然應該是十分完善的人、所以（一）有反革命行爲經判决確定或尚在通緝中的、（二）曾經服務公務而有貪污行爲經判决確定的、（三）被褫奪公權尚未復權的、（四）有精神病或不良嗜好的（五）曾隸中國國民黨被開除黨籍或停止黨權的我們都不要選舉他「當選人的資格」不但如此、倘使一個人就是没有上面說的壞行爲、我們還是不能認爲他是備具了充當國民會議代表的資格譬如一個人對於義業祇有二三年的經騐、他當然不能澈底明瞭農村生活狀况、農村經濟狀况、怎樣能够代表一般農民來出席國民會議　所以中央對於代表的資格上也規定了相當的限制、這個限制就是無論那一界當選人、都以從事於各該界業務有下列規定的年期而現在尚未改業的爲限（一）從事於農業十年以上的、（二）從事於工業或商業五年以上的（三）從事於教育事業五年以上的、（四）從事於各種自由職業五年以上的、「編造册籍的内容」在没有舉行選舉之前、各團體應該先行造具册籍、星報審核、這個表册裏面、應該寫明、（一）組織章程設立程序和經過（二）立案機關及立案年月日、（三）職員姓名略歷、（四）會員姓名年齡籍貫住址和他從事於該界職業的年期、（五）會員有同時爲其他團體的會員時、那末應該寫明其他團體的名稱和這個會員所選定的團體、編造册籍的時候、應該把同姓的人合併寫在一起、以便審查、「公告選舉人名總册」本市選舉監督、收到前項册籍後、就付審查、審查完竣就編製本市職業别之、選舉人名總册和該團體選舉人名册、定期公告、「錯誤遺漏時的辦法」在名册公告後、倘使有人以爲有錯誤遺漏時、可以在五天以内、取具憑證、呈請本市選舉監督核定、「退出選舉塲的規定」本市各團體選舉的塲所和日期、都是由本市選舉監督指定後公告、不過我們在選舉場内的時候應該遵守秩序、勿呆喧譁、倘使有下面的情形的、（一）冒替的、（二）在塲喧擾勸誘不服制止的、（三）携帶兇器入場的、（四）有坊害選舉　疑的、（五）有其他不正當行爲不服制止的、那末、這個選舉人就要被辦理選舉人員令其退出選舉場所、這是很可羞恥的一回事、「選舉票完全作廢」至於塡寫選舉票、應該十分當心、字跡也要清秀、不要草率、因爲選舉法施行法上面規定、凡是、一、寫不依式的、二、夾寫他字的、（但是記載被選舉人住所職業和他從事該職業年期的不在此限）三、不用所發投票紙的那末、這種選舉票就完全作廢、「選舉票完全作廢或一部份作廢」這有、凡是、一、字跡糢糊不能認識的、二、被選舉人爲選舉人名總册所没有的、三、被選舉人他所操的職業、並非屬於該界的、那末、道種選舉票、就有完全作廢或一部份作廢的可能、遥是不可不特别注意的、「天災或事變的辦法」遠有一點、可以附帶說明的、就是本市辦理選舉的時候、倘使遇有天災或其他事變發生、以致不能投票的時候、那末、投票管理員可以呈報本市選舉監督、要求改定投票日期和投票場所、改定之後、另行公告、「選舉完續畢繼開票」選舉場内、我們派有投票管理員、開票管理員、和選舉監察員、他們分别負起投票管理、開票管理、監察選舉的各種責任、在投票完畢之後、開票管理員、就開始開票、繼續開畢爲止「當選人須知」開票完畢後、凡是得票較多數的就是當選、假使你是當選了、本市選舉監督就給你一張當選證書、你收到了道張當選證書後、就應該在十天之内、以書面表示願　當選、如果逾期不表示的就作爲不願意應選另得票次多數的人遞補倘使你是願意應選的、那末、你就要預備一切行裝靜候國民政府的命令、道個命令、就是通知你到京日期、你應該遵限前去報到、並線騐當選證書、上而種種、可以說是對於這次選舉國民會議代表應有的幾點常議、至於詳　各點、　要請你們參閱本事務所所刊行的「選舉須知」、</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 蔡尚恩</p>
<p>▲初戀愛。欲速同居住。結婚後。欲速分離。靡不有初。鮮克有終。」在現代中。凡百皆然。</p>
<p>▲在學校時。常羡在社會任事之人。及入社會謀事後。又反追羨在學校時之前我。　　　▲正在理想時。無事不感覺快活。及實現後。始悟其不過如此。甚至反覺毫無趣味。</p>
<p>▲每見富家貴人所畜之小狐、被抱置於其主婦之懷中·而與之同乘汽車出門。即念貧賤同胞之遠出其下。</p>
<p>▲大概在大商埠之學校。其教職員往往商業化。若在政府所在地之首都。亦往往隨而官僚化。觀於上海與前之北平及今之南京等處之學校。即可證明此言之不虚。</p>
<p>▲過去旣己不滿意於現代。現代亦必不滿意於將來。眞如所謂「後之視今。亦猶今之視昔。又己攻擊前人。取而代之。後人亦將攻擊己。取而代之。於此亦可謂爲「人之視我。亦猶我之視人。」</p>
<p>▲世間所謂苦樂。其實只在一時。樂過即不覺其樂。苦過即不覺其苦。但猶未止於此。往往樂極生悲。是樂亦不足貴。又如未先受苦之人。則將無以見其後來所得之爲樂。故苦亦不可少。</p>
<h3>盧敎授之銅噐癖</h3>
<p>— 晚成</p>
<p>大夏大學教授前雲南教育廳廳長盧錫榮（晉侯）搏士、爲人誠樸。在大夏任教多年。從未輕意缺課。雖大風雨亦準時趕到。其循循善誘。夙爲學生所敬仰。</p>
<p>盧博士有嗜銅之癖。其所寓在孟德蘭路。寓中一切日常器皿。多係銅製。而書室内尤多銅質古器。若銅質花瓶。銅質筆筒。銅質書架。及各種銅製飛禽走獸。珍奇可愛。總之。雜列書室中者。觸目皆銅製品也。盧博士係雲南籍。雲南産銅。然則博士之有銅癖。亦地理使然歟。</p>
<h3>吳觀岱軼事</h3>
<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>吳觀岱。梁溪人。近代名畫家也。不幸於去歳逝世。聞者莫不惜之。客有述其軼事。謂君家本寒微。後此發揚。誠所謂犂牛之子抑亦醴泉無源。固不必論門第也。幼時。從塾師讀。一日。師他出。有友三人來訪。不晤而去。師歸。衆告以有客來訪。師詢客姓名。客固未言。衆亦未問。不能對。師愠。於是君進曰。客姓名旣不可知。生猶記其狀貎。今且爲師圖之。吮毫　墨。頃刻而就。其一人身癯。面削。鼻高。微有髭。又一人則肥而短。目小而輔滿。又一人則適中。御大靉靆。以呈師。師一見即呼曰。此吾故人林福昌劉其祥吕謙之也。胡爲乎來哉。又顧君曰。吾誠不知若懷此技。若幸勿自棄也。蓋君於畫。富於天才如此。君自此有志於畫矣。然當時從師學畫者、例須納贄二百金。米十石。筵二席。而館於師家。三年以爲期。君不能具。遂不得師。而古人眞蹟。又大都收藏於大家。深鐍密置。非至好者不得窺。君遂日趨於裝池之肆。而翫其筆法。日久。肆人厭之。屏不許入。肆之鄰。有丁某者。曾仕京師。聞其事。怒曰。畫被人終日看。寗落一毫髮耶。賤工何得自大如此。召肆人而責之。約縱觀無拒。君畫遂日進、爲人物仕女。佳絶。少與抗者。時同邑有張守彝者。治山水。與君相識。導君觀秦氏所藏宋元畫。秦氏之祖。即撰桐蔭論畫者也。所覽旣博。所作亦愈善。旋張教君爲山水。君教張爲人物。張爲人物不成。而君爲山水成。不數年。名遂掩守彝而上。然識者則以爲不及守彝。或謂晚年之作。多出門弟子手。君但修飾而己。君嘗隨廉南湖至北京。勾留頗久。故名動南北云。</p>
<h3>陳局長宣誓鎖記</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>上海市公安局長陳希曾氏。於本月二日上午十時舉行宣誓典體。先期東邀各界參加。到者頗衆。兹將見聞所及。錄述如下。</p>
<p>予十時半前往。至公安局門口。見駐足環視者。途爲之塞。由門崗索閱請柬後。導至二門口簽名處簽名。院内站有武裝游巡隊數十。排列成行。秩序并然。禮堂前。特建蘆席棚五大間。中懸「宣誓典禮」四大字。旁有「解除人民痛苦」。「保護民衆利益」。「完成模範警區」。「發揚大無畏精神」等四竹布横額。棚内中間。全市敬官排立於内。幾無隙地。兩旁各設長桌三。成川字形。覆以白毯。上供大西洋西菜社承辦之茶點。以及梅蘭芳香烟數罐。來賓分坐桌旁。時張市長正在訓話。因距離太遠。僅見其口講指畫。未聞其所說意義。旋見中央委員褚民誼。披黑色大氅。直立於警官隊内。招待員先未注意。及聞司儀員高呼請褚委員訓話。乃導之登堂。予之座後。環立異性同志十餘人。均穿皮領大衣。因其謙讓不坐。深以爲異。旋詢洪蘭祥。據云此輩均係女偵探。是屬員而非來賓。乃恍然大悟。余素樵請來賓演說時。無人應允。經張市長指推葉惠鈞。衆皆拍手贊成。葉君因有人棒塲。未更推却。遂即登堂。予因葉之演說莊諧雜出。不可不聽。故亦排衆入内。葉謂陳局長係革命同志。聞自任公安局長後。對於職務。異常努力。非特寄宿局内。并於深夜潛赴各區考查部下勤惰。此種局長。與日圖三餐。夜圖一𥈝者。不可同日而語。并因近來盜賊横行。華界雖較租界稍安。然亦間有發生此種案件。故以普通傷寒。與夾隂傷寒爲比擬。請陳局長防患未然。從速醫治。突梯滑稽。聞者捧腹。禮成後。各來賓相率登堂。與局長賀喜。人多堂窄。致將陳局長包圍在内。一一握手。約二十餘分鐘始竣事。予乘此參觀禮堂。見各界所贈紀念物品。均陳列於總理遺像下三桌上。中供二尺高之銀鼎二。其他銀爵銀盾。環繞左右。所刋文字。琳琅滿目。美不勝收。楊虎所送之長方形銀盾下。壓有六寸寛八寸長之白紙一。細視之。始知即陳局長今日宣誓之誓詞。文甚簡潔。字亦端正。下蓋小印。頗爲鄭重。旋同赴院内攝影。來賓分坐前行。警官環立於後。攝影師爲鄭重起見。攝至四張之多。旋即散會。歸而爲記。</p>
<h3>誌雙胎難産</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>日前吾邑南門外。鄉人有蔣姓者。某　　婦分娩。臨盆難於産下。稳婆輩以不嫺手術。致墮地時。胎兒受傷以死。其事甚奇。因泚筆志之。</p>
<p>初聞其婦覺腹中疼痛異常。頗爲憂慮。因唤接生者至。而歷時久之。未見動靜。闔室惶懼。恐其有變。乃不俟其瓜熟蒂落。而其禍遂肇。今産母猶在危險期中。</p>
<p>時胎兒始得其一。頭甚大。有若晬歳者然。似尤過之。唯因傷致眉目移於頂上。而下須若無。見者驚駭失措。不謂少頃。又得其一。而渺小無異胎貓。蓋雙生也。而皆係隂性。</p>
<p>舊習以怪胎爲不祥。傳至遠近。鄰里踵門爭觀。咸以爲宜暴露。不當隠匿。遂懸之電杆。嗣爲城中民教館所聞。飭人收之。并貯之於玻瓶。灌以酒精。以備研考。</p>
<p>不知者以一兒頭蓋骨過大。遂目之爲猴、並謂其耳生於脅下。實皆傳聞異辭。而其一因形體發育未能完成。以致相較不等。而遽謂人類而生一猴一貓。詫爲胎妖。眞少見多怪己。</p>
<p>或云。此兩胎兒初墮下時。背間互生皮肉連接。不能分離。後用刀割開。故今觀瓶中。背上各有血漬。猶隠約可覩。其小者兩耳邊緣下埀。有異恒態。此所異也。故余特志之。</p>
<h3>我的西遊記觀</h3>
<p>— 朱石僧</p>
<p>戲本來是假的。不過飾者不得不認眞做。不如此不足以使觀者爲之感動。所以編戲大非容易。而飾者亦未可草率。現今西遊記一劇。風行各無台。可稱爲西遊記熱。該劇中的重要人物。如唐僧。非平常僧人可比。確是道德高尚的。其次如孫行者之本領高强。他的舉動斷不會如今日的俗僧。就是猪八戒沙僧等。本領雖未及行者。其舉動也絶不至違背佛制。况且又爲唐僧之徒。一心一意。苦行隨師取經。其志向非凡。於此可見。不過唐僧尚有證據可考。其實行者八戒沙僧並無其人。今日各舞台旣要表演他們以爲穿挿。對於他們的舉動。就要愼重。倘以現代人的醜態加到他們身上去。未免失去他們的本來面目。豈不可惜。要知凡事從道德上靪利益。享受方可久長。否則。縱然發達。恐怕難於持久。雖然靑天白日之下行動自由。到底三民主義仍然是要保存我們中國的固有好道德。願各舞台主人劇界鉅子。對於戲劇上還是要從道德上入手。營業不難無發達的希望。前程也當然宏大了。</p>
<h3>猿染烟癖之趣聞</h3>
<p>— 傖父</p>
<p>曩年客壽春。時值直魯軍十三軍王翰鳴部駐壽。所部有騎兵兩營。以一猿教練之。猿上馬則前進下馬則後退。每遇出發。輒授猿以武裝前導。某日。聞黨軍岳相如佔正陽。王督隊出發。時己夜半。王先令所部旅長宋永安。率步兵兩團作先行。己則率騎兵尾其後。詎行至中途該猿忽從馬上跌下。羣騎見猿下馬。皆返奔。王疑發現敵軍。遂隨騎返壽春。事後。始悉該猿素有烟癖。而猿之烟癖。實因飼猿者爲一癮君子。每當一榻横陳。吞雲吐霧之際。猿輒坐視不去久遂成癖。每次出發。飼猿者必先噴以烟。猿始精神百倍此次因奉急令。未及噴烟。猿癮發。致有此失。亦趣聞也。</p>
<h3>南洋遊記（一三○）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>緬俗清晨飯熟。即先遣子或女以頭頂戴菜飯之佳者。入近廟中供養。僧乃自食。然其好布施也。或不經濟。友人有訪之者。某家數口。均不能衣食。問其故。則數年前有數十元。因布施以盡。今至於此。然亦不悔也。因人窮則可爲僧。爲僧後易得布施。亦不難富也。老子曰。常以爲人己愈有。常以與人己愈多。其緬人之謂乎。</p>
<p>印度人有賣藝者。於當街埋一竹竿。長可三四丈。一人持其竿之下。一男子着雞毛衣爲戲。緣竹上至頂。爲種種屈伸之戲。未之奇也。俄而下地。頭頂之數瓦盆。復緣竿而上。至項。更能作種種姿勢。蓋甚難矣。印人故俗。呑刀吐火。然則此亦末伎耳。</p>
<p>初九日。購一土産漆盒。略如吾閩之漆器。而稍遜其色澤。亦可玩也。臨行爲彭城書聨。語云。漢族光烈。堯胃文明。十二時。同宗以汽車二輛送上船回仰光。仍坐前次來勃生之船。二等九元。乃英語所謂弗理失。無冲凉所。又在船尾。尚不如並通艙在船面之有風。而價三倍因此間二等與三等舟車之價。均加三倍也。仍住前次來之房艙。甚熱。又無人招待。茶房呼唤不靈。昔託爾士太云。止有三等車可坐。我信之也。然中國遊行之客。至外國。有時爲體面計。仍坐二等。事實上在南洋各地勢帶。坐二等乃最吃虧事。因此地各處侍役。並不招待。且舖位窄隘。閉於斗室。遠不如在廣塲公衆之處。只要有席毯。可任意占據方丈之地也。在南洋船中坐二等艙。愚人也。我乃知而蹈之。奈何。</p>
<p>在船中。夜月明如畫。照江流甚美。惟小蟲尋光而來。不敢開電燈。</p>
<p>十日晨黎明。己抵仰光。同船之缅人。於早三刻即起。對鏡包其頭巾。約半點始就。西洋人有甚厭其領圍加拉之束縛。而願提倡中國衣服者。余尤惡領結之不便。西服男人。遠不如婦女之自由。今缅人之頭巾亦難打扮如此。眞可證明中國衣服之便利。冠於萬國。便利。即文明也。</p>
<p>返仰光。仍住安溪會館。是日雙十節殊熱鬧。各學生等以汽車遊行。</p>

<h3>標粉平庸色彩</h3>
<p>昨日紛市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面大致呈平疲盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、雖回好一二角不等、於合價上自不生巨大之影響、不過大廠家終以手中洋麥仍豐、依然抛售未絶、致遠期各月份、又帶疲軟、至近期則以標準現貨、喊價仍在二兩二錢半之間與標準未免距離　遠所以市氣尚見平穏也、結果本月份較前日好五厘、四月份小五厘五月份大五厘、六月份小五厘、七·八月份小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥由平趨軟</h3>

<h3>國際固定曆法</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>國際「固定」曆法是一種前此未有新曆法、自從發明到現在、己經經過許多專家的研究和改進、公認爲一種最適合於人羣生活的新曆法、研究這種新曆的人、都希望從一九三四年起、能夠施諸實行、國際聨盟對於這件事也很注意、定於本年十月中召集各國代表、開一個關於曆法的國際會議、去解决和改善那個曆法問題、</p>
<p>所謂國際固定曆法者、他的特點就是在「固定」兩個字、這種新曆規定每一年十三個月、每個月四星期、而每月中的四個星期日都有固定的日子、每年的六月二十九日稱之爲關日、年終的十二月二十九日八稱之爲年終日、規定是國際的休息日、這兩天總是在星期六後一日、然而不呌做星期日、一個月僅有二十八天、所有二十九日·三十日·和三十一日等、一概取消、他的方法就是把現行曆的六月和七月、一個取掉十三天、一個取掉十八天、一共二十八日、所以另外又多了一個月、耶穌復活節禮拜規在四月十五日、如此各個教會齋期節日也就有一定的日子、成爲永久不變了、</p>
<p>固定曆法顧名思義、就是固定不移的意思、所以每個月都是齊齊整整的二十八天、每個星期七天、一日星期日、二日星期一、三日星期二、四日星期三、五日星期四、六日星期五、七日星期六、八日又是星期日、以後永遠一日·八日·十五日·二十二日·爲星期日、星期一永遠是二·九·十六·二十三、星期二是三·十·十七·二十四、星期三是四·十一·十八·二十五、星期四是五·十二·十九·二十六、星期五是六·十三·二十·二十七、星期六是七·十四·二十一·二十八日、所以每個月都像今年｜一九三一年的二月一樣、祇有每年的六月和十二月加增一天成爲閏日、可是不算入星期七日之内、</p>
<p>照現在通行的日曆看起來、一個月或是三十天或是三十一天、還有二月二十九天、或是二十八天、所以一個月旣有五個星期、也有六個星期的、像今年的五月八日都有六個星期、五月的三日·十日·十七日·二十四日·爲星期日之外、三十一日也是星期日、八月中那末除了十·九·十六·二十三爲星期日外、更有三十日也是日曜日、此外正月·三月·四月·六月·七月·九月·十月·十一月及十二月五個禮拜、二月僅有四個星期日、至於耶穌復活節的日子、更是參差不齊、譬如一九三一年爲四月五日、一九三二年改早爲三月二十七日、到了一九三三年又改遲爲四月十六日了、其他的節日也莫非同樣、</p>
<p>旣有上述的種種變化、現行陽曆就有三個不可掩刷的短處、（一）每個月因日子有多少、不能平均、（二）一個月中的日期和星期（週日）常常改變不能劃一、（三）宗教節日像耶穌復活節等、每年變動、要補救這種缺憾有三種辦法、（一）把每個月的日子平均起來、（二）月份日子和週日都有一定、（三）復活節規定在四月十五日、第一個辦法、祇要將每年八月底三十一日移後、使二月成爲二十九日、這樣半年期就格外的平均了、第二個辦法每季三個月、成爲三十天、三十天·與三十一天、或者三十一天與三十天、他的長處是（一）半年或是一季都有足數的月份和星期、（二）每季中的日子和週期重複循環、（三）每個月有同樣天數的工作日子、（四）改變後的第一年比較統計等不必多所整理、第三個辦法就是這裏所講的國際固定曆法、每年十三個月、每月二十八天、成爲四個整個的星期、關於這種新曆法的利便、分項述之如次、</p>
<p>（一）每個月期都是平均的、一樣的爲二十八天四個星期、循環來往、永遠不失</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>平均月份的經濟價值、（二）星期中週日和月份日期互相對照、永遠不變、凡是鐘錶時計上都可恒久使用、（三）發薪日、市集日、定期市塲及會其等循環來往、每個月中日期相同絲毫不錯、（四）一個月份爲四星期、所以每一星期就是一月中的四分之一、因之星期付薪及房金賬欵等、日期整齊、不致參差、（五）節省時問經濟、免除日子錯亂的糾紛、（六）每個週日與一月中四個固定日子回返來往、確定不變、因之每週或每月的工作·出産·營業·付欵·收賬·及社會交際等種種事宜、日期方面格外的整齊、（七）賬單匯票等永不會在星期日到期、（八）公衆·家庭·商店·學校·機關等假期、都有一定不變的子日、（九）無論那個時候收入支出都能相等、或爲各個之幾倍、都能精確計算、（十）每個月底與週末的一日相符不變、對於營業及房金等、有莫大便利、（十一）公衆·商業·金融及家庭生活、都因後有星期及季末的零數日子而大感便利、（十二）凡是不平均月份中的第五個星期房金及工資等、不勞給付、可以節省費用、帮助進步、而統計上易於整理（十三）凡是兩個日期中的天數可以一算便知、付工資利息及計算等十分便利、警如正月十日到六月二十日中問共有幾天祇、要把廿八乘五等於一百四十日、再加上十便得一百五十天的答案、（十四）因爲每個月的距離是平均的、每月的週日又是相同、凡是政府機關·進出口行·科學·衞生·市政及家庭方面、做統計的時候、不但能得到正確的起伏指數、並能節省做註解或修正的寳貴光隂、而高級人員又能於月終得到正確的業務趨向、以决定下個月的行政方針、</p>
<p>固定曆對於婦女界亦有相當便利、（十五）一個月二十八天恰好四個星期、是很自然的、所以婦女們常用二十八天來計算她們體格上的變動、而且人類都是經過二百八十天始生産、人類的半數又是婦女、若用廿八天一個月的曆法、她們對於個人計算方面、能得到很大的利益、因爲有一個到十個月的正確日期、每天每月每星期她們於支配家務及賬目時、都很便利、對於公私及家庭的約會尤屬適當、她們母需用月規的經費或薪金、去採辦第五個星期的食料等物、像目今一樣、（十六）可以節省國家商業、及個人的時間和金錢、去找尋或述及日曆上的日期、以定適當的工作付欵及通訊開會等日期、像法律·規則·條例上常用的「第一個星期一後的星期二日」、及「第二和第四個星期五日」等句子、都能省去、那一筆印刷廣告等費也就節省不少、即照美國一國而論、這種費用常年可省三○·○○○·○○○元左右、（十七）如果用十三個月一年、每月二十八天的固定日曆、那末目下勞働·薪金·房租·津貼等等每月經濟價值、常年流通十二次的、每年可以流通十三次、所以每三十一元的流動資金、現在用爲每月流通的、祇要拿二十八元來代就夠了、因爲一年流通十三次、二十八元的數目可以做目下三十一元的工作、月中第五星期的付欵可以完全取消、照估計購起來、如果採用一月二十八天的固定日曆、在施行的最初三個月時期中、歐洲方面商業上所用的經濟價值、至少可以免除二·○○○·○○○·○○○元、若然各國都算在内、那數目就要逹五·○○○·○○○·○○○元、等於英金一·○○○·○○○·○○○鎊、（十八）目下每月平均的壞賬及未還賬欵、可永久减少百分之十、其比率爲三十一元與二十八元之比、（十九）能省却常年日曆印刷及分送之費用、（二十）日生及週年紀念日都有一定的日子、（二十一）耶穌復活節有一定的日子、聖誕日及新年休假都與週末假期相聨、（二十二）能帮助擇定「日光節省法」的日子、（二十三）能帮助農人耕種田務、（二十四）能帮助科學及衞生上的研究工作、</p>
<p>上面所講二十八天一月的固定曆法、他的便利之處共有二十四項、其中尤以（一）（四）（九）（十四）四條格外重要、不過年終日即十二月二十八日後一日必須加進去、否則不能有上述的許多長處、關於這一點、好像一星期七日之外又有了第八天、猶太人與七日降臨嚴守者恐怕要反對、不過全球百分之九十九的人民、都願意得到上面所講的各種利益益哩</p>
<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記（續）</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>我們在聖包羅的談話自然是關於聨軍的狀况和我們所紮到雷斯河的防寨、現在我們想把那防寨擴張到海邊、我告訴他我决定令士卒開掘戰壕抵抗敵人優越的軍備、以待我們也有同樣信力的設備、再行改取攻勢、因爲非此不足以制勝、後來勞合喬治君屢次呌我記　這次談話、就是他命名的「聖包羅計劃、」那個計劃他眼看着成功的、</p>
<p>歐戰中最重要的一役就在這情形之下發生、聨軍仍想先發制人、並且想利用馬爾内的勝利所給他們的行動的目由對敵人的進攻着一先鞭、並且想乘敵人没有利用安得渥普有勝利能調兵加入從德國開到的有力的後備隊之前就實行進攻、因此準備在此惟一的戰區運用戰略大舉進攻以解决西綫的戰事、</p>
<p>我所要自問的問題就是我們是否有時間足以結集分散複雜的三個聨軍、成爲充分的數目好好的編制恊力遏制敵人的計劃、取得我們應得的勝利、倘使我們不能有此奢望、我們至少也要使敵人計不得　、法蘭特之大戰不久就答覆這個問題、</p>
<p>這役包括兩個時期、</p>
<p>（一）沿海岸進攻或者呌頁石爾之戰｜十月十七日到十一月一日、</p>
<p>（二）頁普里斯之戰、頁普里斯就是法蘭特區域交通中心、｜十月二十一日到十一月十二日、</p>
<p>頁石爾之戰</p>
<p>但基克方面完全找不着高地、樹木、或者略可憑藉的地方、更没有鐵路或河流足供遏守、不過如其要阻止過分的退却、避免將來無窮的禍患、應當急不容緩的下一决策、我的意思就注意到紐埠和狄思莫特間的鐵路綫、這鐵路至少供給一條聨續綫、兵卒退到那裏必須跨過、可以呌他們停止、所以這就是重振陣容便利的根據地、</p>
<p>一條鐵路常常經過溝澗或　防、　使在平地沉木沙石也可藉作避免砲火的屏障、所以我採用這路綫爲其後面列陣的士卒的少許保護、况且鐵路的兩端穏穏的搭在牛埠和狄思莫特、所以牠可以成爲很有價值的防綫、</p>
<p>我的信仰是這樣、不過我與比軍參謀部交换意見｜這事我不甚了了｜並旦根據其結果决定比軍退却到路綫終止、並在路綫後面佈防、在北面的第四十二師的一旅固守著牛埠、中央的另一旅防禦到坡佛西、狄思莫特歸海軍陸戰隊防守、（未完）</p>

<h3>列强在中國之勢力</h3>
<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>李長傅著</p>
<p>我國在國際上的地位、表面上看來當然是一個全民族獨立的國家、實際上是完全相反、所受列强帝國主義者的支配己有悠久的歷史、這是稍具史學知識的人都能明瞭的、依據政治學說、大凡一個國家能自組織政府、統治其所屬的土地人民的、呌做獨立國、雖能組織政府、而一切重政、皆操在外國人的手裏的、呌做保護國、不能組織政府、純粹由其它國家</p>
<p>統治的、呌做屬地、保護國及屬地、主權不完、統稱它爲殖民地、我國雖有自組織的政府、而它的主權却不能完全行使於全國、故表面上雖然呌它爲獨立國、實際上是個半獨立國而無疑、帝國主義者壓迫我國、侵我主權、雖不能說它是殖民地、亦可算是半殖民地了、但據中山先生說、我國的地位、稱它爲半殖民地、尚不大妥切、應該稱它爲次殖民地、所謂殖民地的、是在一國帝國主義壓迫之下、即若我國、則處於國際帝國主義鐵蹄之下、其地位尚次於殖民地、這是最確鑿的話了、關於此、中山先生在民族主義一講裏、是講得很清楚的、現摘錄大要如下、</p>
<p>如安南爲法之殖民地、朝鮮爲日之殖民地、安南朝鮮僅爲一國之奴隸、僅有一主人、有義務、亦有權利、我國則凡締約國、皆爲我主人、我國對於主人、祇有義務、而無權利、如安南朝鮮歳有饑饉、法日必救濟之、行使其主人之責任、若我國北方旱荒、外人偶有賑欵、尚視爲莫大之恩惠也、故我國國際地位、尚亞於殖民地、名之曰次殖民地、</p>
<p>當然、我們要明瞭我國成爲次殖民地的眞象、就須研究國際帝國主義在我國的勢力、其最大者、列强用武力、或威脅的外交手腕、追我國締結不平等條約、擴充其勢力於我國、而以英美日法勢力爲最鉅、意葡西班牙荷蘭比利時次之、其它各國、在我國都有特殊的權利可享、這是多麽可恨亦復可痛的事、在我們、旣爲國民一份子、對於這列强勢力擴充於我國、是應該加以注意或切實研究的、</p>
<p>統計起來、我國條約國凡二十、如我·日·英·美·法·德·奥·義·瑞典·那威·瑞士·波斯·丹麥·荷蘭·日斯巴尼亞（即西班牙、）比利時·秘魯·巴西·葡萄牙·墨西哥等是、以日·英·美·法·義·荷蘭·比利時·日斯巴尼亞勢力最鉅、（英·美·日·法·尤甚、）俄·德·奥·歐戰前勢力甚鉅、戰後大衰、丹麥·葡萄牙·瑞典·勢力次之、至於巴西·秘魯·墨西哥其勢力則更形微末了、而各國在我國的勢力、多利用不平等條約以攫得之、一國取得了特殊權利於我國、其它各國、則藉口「利益均霑」或「最惠國條欵、」而擴張他們的勢力、即如巴西·秘魯·墨西哥等國、與我國關係極爲微末、但亦得有關稅協定、領事裁判權、派遣軍盤、擴張勢力於我國的權利、這都是極形顯明的事實、</p>
<p>列强在我國的勢力、據美國霍巨斯氏charleshogdes說、可分爲領土的、行政的、經濟的、軍事的、除這四者之外、據本書的作者的意見更可加文化的一項、這是確然的、這本書第一章緒論裏、作者將此列舉一表、使我們閱之一目瞭然、實值得我們加以注意的一點、現將此表略舉於下、以供研究者之一助、</p>
<p>一、領土的勢力、甲、割讓領土、（一）割讓地、（如香港臺灣等）（二）組借地、（如旅順威海衞等）乙、其他領土、（一）勢力範圍、（二）外人鐵路區域、（三）外人居留地、（即租界）、</p>
<p>二、行政的勢力、甲、外人設立的交通事業、（一）鐵道、（如南滿鐵道、）（二）郵局（滿洲日郵未撤廢）（三）電報局及無線電臺、乙、領事裁判權、丙、外國僱員、（一）海關外國職員、（二）郵局外國職員、（三）鹽務外國職員、（四）鐵道外國職員、（五）政府外國顧問、（六）各軍隊外國顧問、</p>
<p>三、經濟的勢力、甲、特許工商業、（一）私人企業、（二）公共企業、乙、借欵、（一）政治借欵、（二）實業借欵、丙、外國銀行、</p>
<p>四、軍事的勢力、甲、外人軍事根據地、乙、外國衞兵及軍警、丙、領海及内河的外國軍艦、</p>
<p>五、文化的勢力、甲、基督教的傳佈、乙、外人設立的學校、外人設立的報紙及通信社、</p>
<p>這表雖然很簡略、但是列强在我國所佔的勢力和特殊權却包括完全了、由此、也可以明白我國在國際上所處的地位、是屬於次殖民地而無有疑義的了、</p>
<p>第二章列强在華勢力擴張的歷史、在本書裏、這當然是非常重要的、作者是用極形簡潔的筆法、叙述列强在華勢力的擴張、但在我們讀了之後、至少可以得到一個深刻的概念、大都能夠曉得、自鴉片戰爭後、與英締結南京條約、爲外人利用不平等條約、發展其勢力於中國的起始、嗣後發生一次戰爭、則多結一次條約、旋行其國際帝國主義的侵略、遂步進展、八十餘年以來、乃造成今日的局勢、作者爲使讀者更進一步的明瞭起見、便將其勢力擴張的經過、大别之分爲五期叙述、一自鴉片戰爭至中日戰爭、二自中日戰爭至庚子聨軍之役、三自庚子聨軍之役、至歐戰開始、四自歐戰開始、至華府會議、五自華府會議至最近、概括的說、第一期爲列强初佔勢力時代、第二期爲列强在中國大肆侵略、擬瓜分中國時代、第三期爲列强放棄瓜分政策、而大張經濟勢力時代、第四期爲日本單獨在中國擴充勢力時代、第五期爲列强放棄單獨侵略而取協同步調、似擬共管中國時代、亦爲列强勢力摇動的初期、中國民衆在這時是應該覺悟、作政府外交上的後盾、以期消滅列强在我國勢力的擴張於永久、這有意義的運動、對於我國民族前途當然是有益的、</p>
<p>第三章列强在華領土的勢力、它在華領土的勢力、大約可分割讓地、租借地、强佔地、勢力範圍、以及租界等項、關於此、作者分别叙述、列有詳表、使我們看了、稍具愛護國家之心的人即能引起痛憤、因爲我國所有的領土、被英俄日法四國所佔領有的、計面積不下午餘萬方里、得全國面積三分之一、這是多麽令人閱之而引爲痛心的事呢、</p>
<p>第四章、列强在華行政的勢力、這是要首推領事裁判權、關稅管理權、次爲外人所設立的鐵道·郵局·電報局·及無線電臺、與我國主權妨害甚巨、它如我國各機關所僱用的洋員、亦佔有相當的勢力、這章裏、作者也採用歷史的方法來詳述、使我們讀者能得到系統的概念、這亦是本書唯一的特點、</p>
<p>第五章列强在華經濟的勢力、列强的勢力、在中國最巨的、實爲經濟的勢力、外人借行政的勢力而施行它經濟的侵略、勢力所及、更有籠罩全中國之勢、這很使我們驚駭的、不過叙述經濟方面、是很容易趨於那不正確的理論方面、但作者在這裏、却不加任何論斷、祇客觀地作歷史的叙述、故其在本章最後有這樣的說、「列强在我國經濟的勢力、皆借政治的優勢爲其引擎、不打消外國行政的勢力、我國實業無興盛的可能、外國勢力無消滅的希望、所以要拯救中國、非先取消列强在中國的特殊權利不可」、這確是含有充分的正確的眞理、</p>
<p>第六章列强在華軍事的勢力、列强在華的陸軍、有兩類、一根據條約的、一不根據條約的、前者爲北平至海口沿京奉路所駐的英·法·美·意各國軍隊、皆是根據辛丑條約、後者如日俄的駐兵滿洲、日本的駐兵靑島漢口、英國的駐兵上海、據最近調查、駐屯上海、北平的外兵約二萬人、南滿洲的日軍約二萬人、合計全國外兵。約四萬餘人、這是多麽駭人之數、獨立國家境内、萬無駐屯外兵之理、列强藉口保護僑民、駐兵我國境内、實際己侵我國的主權了、在這一章裏、作者所述是很有鼓醒我們民衆覺悟的力量的、</p>
<p>第七章列强在華文化的勢力、這可分三者、是教會、學校、和新聞事業、這麻醉的力量、實在超過軍事等等的侵略、我們應該加以深切的注意、</p>
<p>第八章爲結論、是綜上所述、使我們對於列强在中國勢力作進一步的瞭解、最重要的、當然是取消不平等條約、取締其政治上的特權、而其經濟上的勢力、當能不撤自退、作者言、「寗爲痛苦的自由民、勿爲安樂的亡國奴」、如果我們要明白這根本的意義、那麽我們非閱讀本書不可、而本書是以通俗簡要、易於明瞭爲主、足供一般人的閱讀的、</p>
<h3>英帝國主義與中國</h3>
<p>— 默之</p>
<p>唐文倩著</p>
<p>稍具有地理常識的、大都可以明瞭我國是處於東海之東、英吉利在西海之西、當然、東亞西歐、原來是「風馬牛不相及」的、但是遞演到現在、而成爲國際間不相容之勢、在這中間、所經過的事實、可引爲我們痛哭流涕的、實在「屈指難盡」、我國的國民革命、己久告成功、現今己走向積極建設的大道、這母須說是一種極好的現象、然而我們要曉得倘若企望國家的勢力日漸强盛、無疑地、是在乎政府方面努力地發展種種建設的事業、對外則採取有力的有利於國家的外交政策、在民衆方面、則更須和政府合作、爲政府有力的後盾、那麽、實爲我人發憤自强的大障礙物的「不平等條約、」始能使之撤消、因爲這不平等條約一日不取消、我國的國勢是永遠不會有所自强的、所以總理嘗說、「不平等條約爲中國人之賣身契、」又說、「要問外國能否廢除不平等條約、先要問我們是否有决心去爭、」當總理臨没的時候、尚諄諄以這爲最後的遺囑、其希望我民衆鼓勵我民衆、這一顆爲國奮鬥的心是多麽的眞切而誠摯呢、這是誰也曉得、英帝國主義者、爲不平等條約的發起人、這在國人腦筋中是印　極形深刻的影像、是銘之於心而永遠不能忘記的、其罪狀的申述當非三言兩語可能完結、就舉其大者、足自鴉片之戰、</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>於砲　南京、這種莫大的恥辱和最痛心最不幸的史實、大凡有志之士、聽之一定要引起無限的悲憤、同時、我們要研究中國國勢不能盛强的根本原因、以及不平等條件的前因後果、那麽這本「英國主義與中國」一書、是值得我們注意的、最低限度、是可作我們研究此項問題的一助、</p>
<p>全書計分十三章、第一章無條約時代的中英、（一）中英最初的通商、（二）英政府三次遣使來華、（三）英艦襲澳門、作者先述十五世紀之末、歐人發現新航路後、葡萄牙人與西班牙人、漸來中國經商、至明嘉靖十四年、葡萄牙人得澳門爲居留地、西班牙人亦據台灣、開市貿易、現在帝國主義執歐洲霸權之英吉利、這時己日臻强盛、於是先起染指之意、旣而遂生侵略我們中國之心了、作者在此、是根據中英通商的歷程、分年叙述、尤能使我們明白其侵略之野心與日俱進、其次、是述英政府三次遣使來華、那時他們尚不明瞭我國的國情、所以未敢施行其砲艦的威嚇、但希望中國與以平等待遇、稍保全他底國家禮面、及商人的利益而英政府交涉的第一次、自此之後、他們所提出要求的七條中以第五條爲最重要、是欲在中國得一島之地、以爲通商的根據地、自立碼頭、關稅及其他雜費皆可省少、因這未能使之如願、於是就發生兵艦襲澳門之一舉了、這爲本書中所述最爲詳細、亦可從中找出英帝國主義的眞面目來、</p>
<p>第二章鴉片戰爭、（一）戰爭的起因、這當然是很重要的、鴉片之入中國、己有千二百餘年的歷史、我國民衆受其之貽實、實至深且鉅、作者在此、將鴉片輸入額與銀兩輸出額列有詳表、作一種比較的研究、我們閱之、實能引起無限的悲恨、是促醒我們覺悟的唯一良機、（二）交戰的狀况這是當林則徐至廣東時、義律遣使同國、報告中國禁烟狀况、請求派軍艦援助、英政府接報後、主戰與非戰者皆有、最後是砲火相接、當我國失敗於是和議旣成、而不平等條約、因是而締結了、（三）南京條約、這都是束縛中國的繩索、使中國陷於不振的主因、但當時英政府的假託德義、野心勃勃地向我國侵略、實足使我們引爲痛恨的、</p>
<p>第三章英法聨軍之役、（一）起釁的原因、我國自鴉片戰爭之後、國力日頽、復罹洪秀全之變、調兵籌餉、政令紊亂、英人乘機擴充其貿易、利用奸商、與以護照或國旗、使得自由出入各海港、奸商則假英的勢力、販賣鴉片、麻醉我國國民、後巴夏禮率領軍艦、砲擊黄埔砲台、進陷廣州、那時奥民憤英的暴横、於英軍去後、爭起力戰將英·美·法·各國的兵館洋房、悉行焚燬、以爲報復、於是不僅爲對英的問題、而促成英法之聨軍了、（二）交戰的狀况、英政府以額爾金爲全權大使、法政府以羅爲全權大使、率領艦隊來華、額爾金先抵香港致書於葉名琛（廣東巡撫）、請約期會議賠償損失及重立約章之事、不然以砲火相見、法美領事亦致書要求賠償、並願居調停、結果是在天津議和、英使提出所擬新約五十六欵、法使亦提出四十二條、迫令簽字、清廷以戰守俱無把握、遂無談判而簽字承認、是爲天津條約、較之南京條約、尤爲酷烈、關於此項條約、其重要的作者摘錄於書後、使讀者能明其中的眞相、（三）　端再搆、這是一波未平、一波又起、那中英北平條約、在此時亦告成了英·法·聨軍之禍、到此才告一大結束、而條約上所貽禍患、至今猶未己呢、（四）條約上的損失、這當然是使我們驚駭的、自鴉片一戰、締結城下之盟的南京條約、吾國漸墮入不平等條約的法網、而這次天津條約、尤加酷烈、其最重要的有四點、（一）爲領事裁判權的許與、（二）爲開始恊定稅率、（三）爲開放内河、（四）爲最惠國條約的開端、這旣使我們失去獨立國的精神、尤足以制我國的死命、作者於此所述更爲詳盡、　堪加以注意、</p>
<p>第四章、馬加理事件　　甸的喪失、（一）馬加理的被殺與烟臺條約、（二）英滅缅甸的經過、（三）緬甸滅亡後的交涉、中英天津條約締結以後、英商業更得一重保障、貿易額逐年增加、於是英人更欲開陸上通商路、由印度而直至中國内地、其野心可見、馬加理（英公使的書記官）被殺後、便有烟台會議、締約四端、世稱烟台條約、亦稱芝罘條約、母須說是受其侵略、使中國愈趨不振、缅甸與印度毘連、而又爲吾國的屬國、負侵略野心的英國、垂涎己久、當中法搆釁彼此皆無暇顧及、英國即以迅雷不及掩耳的軍略、不及二週、而將它全部吞滅、在我國浙送了這屬國、亦祇飲恨呑聲而己、但我國雖不能、以武力與之爭論、然分境及一切其它事宜、自不免有一番交涉、其結果而片馬交涉種子、亦在這時發生了、在我國、旣撤屏藩、貽邊陲無限之憂、更使内部權利、喪失殆盡、言之實可爲之流涕、本章也不啻一頁痛心之史呢、</p>
<p>第五章、軍港的租借、（一）租借的口實（二）威海衞九龍的租約、第六章八國聨軍中的英國、（一）英國日本的出兵、（二）賠償金的波瀾、（三）英德恊約及英日聨盟、第七章中英西藏問題、（一）英國侵略西藏的事實、（二）清末的西藏交涉、（三）民國初的西藏交涉、（四）森姆拉草約的爭執、（五）最近的西藏問題、西藏爲我國西南的藩屏、面積約二百五十餘萬方里、東連川邊、北接靑海、新疆、西北兩面、則與英屬的印度毘連、自英人併吞印度後、勢力徧於西馬拉亞山之南、覬觎我國西藏己久、後駐印之英總督、即屢遣秘密使來西藏探險、然均未能深入内地、其後訂烟台條約、英人遂乘機更附加之另議專條、即是中國政府承認英藏的交通、他當然得步進步、中國的重要邊藩的西藏、就成爲印度之續了、關於這一章、作者有充分的述及、使凡我國國民能明瞭西藏邊防的重要、此實爲本書之特點、第八章中英片馬問題、（一）滇缅劃界的糾紛、（二）英人强佔片馬的事實、第九章收回威海衞交涉、第十章五卅慘案、（一）流漢沙面慘殺的眞相、（二）滬案交涉、（三）漢案及沙面案交涉、第十一章萬縣慘案、第十二章國民政府的對英交涉、（一）漢潯租界的收回、（二）英人出兵來華、（三）砲擊南京、第十三章結論、</p>
<p>我們讀了本書、能夠深切地明瞭英帝主義的眞面目、他對於中國所施與的侵略手段、方式如何、當然足以引起我們的悲憤、締結不平等的南京條約、先例旣開、於是各國不平等條約、直入是紛至沓來、大有以致我國於滅亡之勢、但在今日、吾國反帝國主義的聲浪、仍是日趨高烈、廢不平等條約的呼聲、亦是甚囂塵上、這實是使我國傳弱爲强的現兆、但是這不平等條約是首起於英、吾國受帝國主義的壓迫、是自鴉片戰爭之後、使我國之罹各國的不平等條約的法網、所以我們要消取一切不平等條約、須將英帝國主義在華的特權有相當的處置、爲今之計、凡我國民衆、須聨合一致、爲政府後盾、如中英間的一切懸案、西藏片馬都問題、均應有以澈底的解决、關於此、本書均述得非常詳細、而且作者是以三民主義的立塲來解剖英帝國主義在華的關係及其眞相、這是更值我們問讀者加以推薦的、</p>

<h3>Sino-British Legal Rights Negotiation</h3>
<p>British Minister Lampson Visits Wang Chonghui Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Minister Lampson, accompanied by counselors, visited Wang Chonghui at the Judicial Yuan on the afternoon of the 4th for discussions on legal rights issues. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London A semi-official statement published here states that British Minister to China Lampson arrived in Nanjing on Sunday to discuss the issue of consular jurisdiction with the Chinese government. Preliminary talks have now begun with Foreign Minister Wang. It is hoped that the entire issue can be resolved. British policy is based on the memorandum of December 1926, which recognizes that when China's political situation is stable, the consular jurisdiction that has been revised over the past thirty years cannot be maintained. The negotiations in 1929 were suspended due to the civil war, but with the civil war over and the Nanjing government firmly established, the time for resuming negotiations has clearly matured. Therefore, Minister Lampson sent a draft in September last year, and the Chinese government submitted a response in December. These documents have been carefully studied, leading to the current negotiations. The opening of negotiations is based on the determination that the Chinese government now controls the overall domestic situation. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>South Manchurian Telegraph Rights Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of recovering the South Manchurian telegraph rights in the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations, the State Council ordered the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Communications to prepare a plan for discussion.

<h3>US Bank Loan Stalled</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign banking circles, the US bank is not as enthusiastic about the US debt as it was a month ago. One reason is that silver mines are going bankrupt one after another, and silver production has greatly decreased. Second, the American capitalists are temperamental, and they make grand wishes when they are happy, but they are abandoned as soon as they are disappointed. Third, the Chinese side hopes to fully demonstrate that the new loan was initiated by the United States and accepted by China in order to seek understanding from the people of the country. The US side, on the other hand, hopes that it will originate from a request from the Chinese side, as they are in the position of a lender. As for the League of Nations gold loan, although someone is currently trying to bring it together, the procedures are cumbersome and it is difficult to complete in a short time. In short, borrowing from others requires considerable conditions regarding supervision, guarantee, and use, and cannot be as simple as previously rumored. Therefore, bankers from various countries expected that the US loan would be difficult to realize. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zou En Yuan Discusses the South Manchuria Railway Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zou En Yuan, the representative of the Northeast Transportation Committee, told reporters on the 4th that Kimura, the director of the South Manchuria Railway, is shrewd and capable, and his appointment for negotiations shows a certain intention. Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander, after reviewing the four points of the negotiation outline submitted, handed them over to the Northeast Transportation Committee for thorough research. The method of negotiation in the future and whether Gao Jiyi will be responsible have not been determined. I believe that negotiations should be based on two principles: (1) Japan should declare its abandonment of the interests it has obtained in China, whether legal or not. (2) Economic issues should not involve political scope. If Kimura does not follow these principles, there is no need to negotiate. Also, the Japanese construction of the Jilin-Huiyuan Railway is a large-scale economic aggression. After opposition from the people, it is proposed to rename it Dunhua-Huiyuan Railway in an attempt to deceive. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Parliament Endorses Briand's Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been two major crises in the world that have been regarded as leading to a re-emergence of the European war: one is the competition between Italy and France, and the other is the disagreement between Germany and France. The competition between Italy and France has been resolved through the mediation of the British Foreign Secretary, and the naval agreement has gained the consent of Italy and France, and there is hope for the implementation of disarmament. If this can proceed smoothly, the crisis of rupture between European countries can be reduced a lot. As for the disagreements between Germany and France, the German opposition to the Young Plan and the demand for a reduction in compensation has become more and more prominent, and the German Parliament has unanimously passed a proposal to the next League of Nations. People are generally worried that when the League of Nations opens, the European situation will be in turmoil. However, recently there have been signs that the opinions of Germany and France are gradually approaching, and the French government has said that it will understand Germany. Therefore, I previously argued that this is also an opportunity to reduce the risk of a re-emergence of the European war. Now, looking at the results of the French Parliament's vote on Briand's foreign policy, we know that this is not a false statement. According to a Paris telegram, Briand's foreign policy was discussed in the House of Deputies today. Although the right wing tried its best to oppose understanding with Germany, Briand strongly refuted the right wing's claim that it wanted to destroy the current policy and see another world war before it would be happy, and revealed that the French people did not want to see war again. In the end, the result was that the vast majority supported Briand's policy. This is a manifestation of the French government and people's respect for peace, and it is enough to sweep away the gloom that has always permeated Europe. Its signs have already been seen here, which is worthy of the attention of people around the world.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 3rd – A fierce debate erupted in the French Parliament today. The right-wing Poullain fiercely criticized Briand's foreign policy, strongly opposing any understanding with Germany. Briand countered strongly, accusing Poullain of wanting to destroy the foundation of current policies and longing to see another world war for his own gratification. He stated that the current foreign policy was consistent with the French people's determination to never see war again. In the final vote, Briand's policy was supported by a large majority of 551 to 14.</p>

<h3>Indian Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>Agreement Reached</p>
<p>Coastal Residents Allowed to Produce Salt</p>
<p>Confiscated Property Agreed to be Returned</p>
<p>Great Victory for the People's Party</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd – After several days of talks between Viceroy Irwin and Gandhi, negotiations concluded at 1:30 AM today, and an agreement was reached. The foundation for peace in India can be based on this. This agreement will be reviewed and approved today. At the end of the meeting, all parties involved in political matters actively cooperated to clear obstacles to understanding. It is reported that Gandhi and Finance Committee member Schuster of the Executive Council agreed on salt laws, stipulating that people living on the coast may be allowed to produce and sell salt as a natural right. The recognition of this principle does not hinder the salt monopoly. Most of the salt needed by India will still be supplied by the government. A temporary solution has also been reached regarding the issue of returning confiscated property to members of the All-India Congress. The Executive Council has agreed to the return of property, with slight modifications to define the scope of property that can be returned. There is great optimism in political circles that the results achieved so far are the prelude to the smooth progress of new policies.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 4th – The agreement between Viceroy Irwin and Gandhi has been approved by the All-India Congress to universal satisfaction. This afternoon, the All-India Congress Executive Committee met to abolish the non-violent resistance movement and recorded its gratitude to Irwin for linking British and Indian sentiments.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – This morning, all newspapers prominently featured the Irwin-Gandhi agreement, but their commentaries were divided into two factions. The News Chronicle's editorial was titled "The Best News So Far." The Manchester Guardian stated that all those concerned with the true welfare of India, both Indian and British, welcomed this agreement. However, the Morning Post and Daily Mail, among others, described it as Irwin's policy of surrender.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 4th – The Political News stated that the new agreement would be regarded as one of the greatest events of the second quarter of the twentieth century, with an impact on the world comparable to that of November 11th.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Bombay, 4th – After the news of the Irwin-Gandhi agreement spread, the business community was particularly pleased, expecting that India's industry and commerce would soon return to their former state.</p>
<h3>After the New Naval Agreement is Concluded</h3>
<p>Franco-Italian Enmity Removed</p>
<p>All Parties Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>Rumors of France Lending Italy a Huge Loan</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd – British Prime Minister MacDonald telegraphed French Prime Minister Laval and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, expressing satisfaction that the outstanding issues of the London Naval Conference had now been resolved by agreement and could be implemented after the other governments attending the London Naval Conference agreed. He also said that he regarded this result as a good omen for resolving various issues at the 1932 Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 3rd – French Foreign Minister Briand spoke on the naval agreement in the Chamber of Deputies today, very pleased, saying that this was a policy of give and take, leaving no trace of hatred, truly the best thing. Italy did its best for the sake of peace to achieve this satisfactory result. There had been conflicts of opinion between France and Italy, especially during debates, but there was no major grudge in the hearts of the people of the two countries. This agreement created a good atmosphere, enabling continued negotiations to achieve a complete agreement.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Rome, 3rd – After hearing the opinions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Haig regarding the naval agreement, the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party unanimously passed a motion recognizing that this agreement was satisfactory in all respects.</p>

<h3>A Happy Couple Turns into a Resentful One</h3>
<p>Italo-Belgian Marriage Ultimately Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Rumor that the Romanian Princess Will Marry a Military Officer</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Brussels, 3rd – The marriage between the Italian Crown Prince and the Belgian Princess has fallen into a tragic situation. The authorities of both countries initially tried to conceal it, but the facts ultimately could not be hidden. It is now known that Belgian Princess Marie has returned to her country many times, crying to her parents about her husband's misconduct. The Belgian King and Queen have always comforted her with kind words, but they have now reached the limit of their tolerance. It is said that the Belgian King and Queen have decided to ask the Pope to dissolve the marriage. The Italian Crown Prince and the Belgian Princess were married on January 8th last year, with the wedding ceremony held by the Pope. The Crown Prince is now 26 years old, and the Princess is 25 years old.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Rome, 2nd – The Queen of Romania, unable to reconcile with the King, intends to remarry a certain army colonel.</p>
<h3>British Boxer Indemnity Distribution Bill</h3>
<p>Third Reading Passed in the Upper House</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd – The China Boxer Indemnity Distribution Bill passed its third reading in the British House of Lords today. Conservative Dansford asked what kind of negotiations were currently taking place regarding China's obligations to railway creditors. Peng Senbi replied that the government inherited the policies of the previous government, so the indemnity issue was a tool to obtain satisfaction in other negotiations. Moreover, a portion of the returned indemnity would be used for Chinese railways. Once the railways were developed, the creditors would benefit. A conference was held in Nanjing last November to discuss bond matters. The Chinese government submitted some documents at that time, and the participants decided that these documents should be carefully studied by the governments of the participating countries, so the meeting adjourned soon.</p>
<h3>Political Situation in the Japanese House of Peers is Treacherous</h3>
<p>Tax Reduction Bill Finally Passed in the House of Representatives</p>
<p>▲Japanese Press, Tokyo, 3rd – The House of Representatives discussed the tax reduction bill yesterday. The Seiyukai Party advocated opposition. As a result of the vote, the opposition was rejected, and the original bill was passed. It was sent back to the Upper House today.</p>
<p>▲Electro-Communications, Tokyo, 4th – Since the opening of the Diet, the government has put great effort into the House of Peers, seeking understanding. However, the atmosphere in the House of Peers has not only shown no improvement, but recently, due to the instigation of the anti-government faction, the situation has become increasingly treacherous, leaving no room for optimism. The general situation can be seen from the attitude and situation of each faction in the House of Peers towards the budget bill and other important bills below. First, regarding the House of Peers' attitude towards the budget bill, the difficulty actually originated from the revival of the issue of the transfer fee for the Chungcheongnam-do provincial government building in Korea. It is inevitable that the revival proposal for the transfer fee of the provincial government building will be raised. If the House of Peers raises it, and the party stubbornly insists on deletion due to past claims, then the conference of the two houses will break down, and the special accounting budget bill will not be established at all. As a result, the government has no choice but to accept the claims of the House of Peers and recognize the revival of the transfer fee of the provincial government building. At this time, Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda's face will be lost, and the issue of the responsibility of the minister in charge will inevitably be raised. Secondly, regarding the House of Peers' attitude towards the tax reduction bill, the tax reduction bill is related to the second replenishment plan, and the atmosphere of opposition is very strong. As a result of the amendment to the special committee election method proposed by the Research Association, the special committee has over half of the members from the Research Association and the Koyu Club combined. Therefore, the two factions actually control the power of life and death of the tax reduction bill. In particular, since it has been decided that the chairman will be Mr. Maeda, which is even more unfavorable to the government, the fate of the tax reduction bill is also extremely worrying. Thirdly, regarding the women's suffrage bill, if the Research Association amends the election age to 23 years old or withdraws the amendment, there will inevitably be those who advocate amending the case of lowering the male election age in the amended municipal and village system to 23 years old. Therefore, the future is also not optimistic, and the government will be even more trapped.</p>
<h3>British Industrial Disputes Bill Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Beautifully All Lost Meaning After Being Amended by the Liberal Party</p>

<h3>Singapore Port Construction Issue</h3>

Naval Minister Alexander said that as of now, a total of £2,772,000 has been used, including the floating dock expenses. According to the engineering contract, the main project is scheduled to be completed in September 1935.</p>

<h3>Sun Lianzhong's Remarks When Passing Through Xuzhou</h3>
<p>▲Jiang Bocheng and Wen Susong Accompany Him</p>
<p>▲After Visiting Chairman Chiang, He Will Go to Jiangxi Again</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Sun Lianzhong's 26th Route Army is opening to Jiangxi from western Shandong. The 7th Division under Gao Shuxun has completed its departure. The 25th Division directly under Sun's command has also continued to depart. Sun himself, together with the various departments of the 26th Route Army Headquarters, and accompanied by Jiang Bocheng, the chief staff officer of the General Headquarters, and Wen Susong, a senior staff officer of the General Headquarters, took a special train on the morning of the 2nd from Jining to the south. The 26th Route Army arrived in Xuzhou at 6 pm. After receiving the railway news, Xuzhou was guarded by Mo Woruo's Central Gendarmerie Battalion on the platform overpass. The Tianjin-Pukou Garrison Headquarters sent staff officer Zhou Chuanduo, county magistrate Yang Wei, and Public Security Bureau Director Qiao Shizhao to the station to greet him. Sun wore a military uniform, a gray cloth cotton cloak, and black cloth shoes. According to the conversation, the entire army of this route is opening to Jiangxi. Although I have taken the position of Jiangxi Pacification Supervisor in Jining, the Supervisor's Office will not be organized until I arrive in Jiangxi. Approximately, it will be reorganized from the 26th Route Army Command. I will first go to Nanjing to visit Chairman Chiang to ask for instructions, and will stay in Nanjing for about one or two days before going to Jiangxi to visit Minister He. The establishment of the Supervisor's Office and the anti-communist strategy must be handled after receiving instructions. However, my plan for Jiangxi Pacification is to defeat the communists first, and then thoroughly pacify them, which will be easier to handle. For this southern transfer of our army, Chairman Chiang is very attentive in issuing pay and providing hospitality, and the soldiers are all grateful. We must strive to fulfill our duties to the party and the country. Jiang Bocheng said that I arrived in Jining from Jinan yesterday at Sun's invitation to accompany Sun to the south. Wen had been discussing everything with Sun earlier. After Jiang and Wen arrive in Nanjing with Sun, their actions still need to be instructed by Chairman Chiang. Approximately, Jiang will have to return to Jinan within a few days. Jiang and Wen expressed great appreciation for the discipline of Sun's troops. According to Zhao Bosheng, Sun's chief of staff, after the downsizing of the army, there are a total of three divisions. The 25th Infantry Division has three brigades and nine regiments in total. The 27th Infantry Division has three brigades and six regiments in total. The 4th Cavalry Division, with Guan Shuren as the division commander, has two brigades in total. Zhang Huatang's brigade has already opened to Jiangbei to suppress bandits. Zhu Changde's brigade will continue to depart and enter Jiangxi with the division. For this transport, approximately 50 trains will be used. The 27th Division will depart first, followed by the 25th Division, and the cavalry brigade will guard the rear. Starting from the 18th of last month, it is expected to be completed by the 5th of this month. Sun's special train loaded coal and water at Xuzhou Station and left southward at 7 pm. It is estimated that it will arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 3rd. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Wang Jinyu Arrives in Jiangxi from Hankou</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Wang Jinyu, Pacification Supervisor of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border Area and Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army, believes that in order to suppress bandits in the three provinces, Jiangxi must be cleared first, followed by Hunan and Hubei. Therefore, in addition to ordering the 43rd, 47th, and 54th divisions under his command to advance from the Hunan-Hubei border to northern and western Jiangxi to clear out the bandits and communists in Pingxiang, Wanzai, Tonggu, Xiushui, Anfu, Yongxin, Yuanzhou, and Shanggao, Wang will come to Jiangxi after the bandit suppression conference at the Wuhan camp is over, and will move the Fifth Route Army Headquarters and the three-province Supervisory Office to Nanchang to facilitate nearby command. After Nanchang received the news of Wang's arrival in Jiangxi, they had already arranged the three-province Supervisory Office for Wang at the Provincial Second Vocational School and prepared to welcome him. As for Wang's itinerary, he left Hankou on the 28th of last month and arrived in Xunyang on the 1st of this month. He then took an ordinary passenger car to the province. Minister He heard the news and immediately went to Wang's office to talk for a long time, discussing the military plan for bandit suppression. Wang then went to the General Headquarters' office to visit He and report on the bandit suppression situation in the three-province border area. Then he went to visit Chairman Lu at his private residence, also regarding military consultations. It is reported that Wang came this time with only a few staff and followers. The officials of the Fifth Route Army Headquarters and the three-province Supervisory Office will continue to arrive soon. (March 1st)</p>
<h3>Public Memorial for Zhang Huizan Held by Various Circles in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Last year, on New Year's Eve, during the Longgang Campaign, the 18th Division was encircled by bandits. They annihilated five or six thousand bandits, but besides the 52nd Brigade Deputy Commander Hong Hanjie and 105th Regiment Commander Zhu Xianzhi who died in battle, Division Commander Zhang Huizan, Brigade Commander Wang Jiejun, Acting Chief of Staff Zhou Wei, Huang and 103rd Regiment Commander Li Yuefeng were all captured by the bandits. They were coerced and tempted, but remained unyielding, and were executed one after another in Xiaobu, Longgang. Now, the Central National Government and the Provincial Government have given generous posthumous honors to Division Commander Zhang and others to recognize their loyalty and martyrdom. Various circles in Jiangxi have decided to hold a public memorial service from the 1st to the 3rd of this month, and on the 4th, the coffin will be transported back to Hunan for a state funeral. The 1st was the day of the public memorial by the Party and government circles. The entire city lowered flags to half-mast to express mourning. The memorial hall and coffin were located in the 18th Division headquarters of the Provincial Governor's Office in front of Zhangjiang Gate. From the front gate to the auditorium, six white cloth memorial arches were erected. On both sides of the甬道 (paved path), white cloth was used to form railings, with plain flowers interspersed in the middle, fresh flowers placed below, and Party and national flags and paper lanterns hung above. In the auditorium, a memorial hall was set up, with Zhang's portrait hanging above, offered with flowers and fruits. On both sides, more than a thousand mourning couplets and eulogies were hung. Dozens of wreaths were placed around the memorial hall, creating an extremely tragic scene. At 9:00 a.m., representatives from various agencies arrived to pay their respects. Those present included National Government Representative Peng Xinmin, Chairman Jiang’s Representative Lu Dipin, all members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, the President of the High Court, and more than a thousand representatives from various agencies subordinate to the Provincial Government, who paid their respects in order. Lu Dipin, despite his illness, personally attended the memorial service, weeping bitterly in extreme grief. The 2nd was the day of the public memorial by gentry, merchants, farmers, workers, and various groups. The 3rd was the day of the public memorial by the military police and their families.

<h3>Commander Xiang Confiscates Liang Wenkai's Weapons</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The remnants of Liang Hongkai's troops from the former Guangdong Army's Fourth Army were scattered along the West River and often obstructed merchants and travelers. Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, specially established methods to appease and recruit them, reorganizing them into the Sixth Special Service Battalion, appointing Liang Wenkai's younger brother, Wenkai, as the battalion commander. After being reorganized, this unit still failed to strictly adhere to revolutionary military discipline. On the 22nd, they were ordered to come to Shantou on the Da Sima merchant ship. Liang Wenkai did not come from the province and was led by Deputy Battalion Commander Liang Chengxun. The ship arrived in Shantou at 10:00 a.m. that morning and docked on the sea surface of the Chaojie Wharf, and they were not allowed to disembark. In the afternoon, Huang Yuan's troops from the Second Regiment of the First Independent Brigade, carried by the Fu'an warship, arrived in Shantou. Previously, the 62nd Division Headquarters in Shantou received a secret order from the provincial capital and immediately dispatched Adjutant Chief Wang Baoru, leading the First Company of Chen Runhua, to the Fu'an warship, instructing the soldiers on the ship to act according to the circumstances. Another artillery company, Zhu Jing, was dispatched to the Da Sima ship on a salt administration patrol boat to prepare. Furthermore, Li Xiangqing's company was ambushed on the coast in front of Deji, and temporary martial law was imposed, cutting off pedestrians. Then, the Dasheng ship was dispatched to tow five large sailboats to transport the soldiers on the Da Sima ship ashore. After the ship towed the soldiers, it berthed alongside the Fu'an warship. Adjutant Wang Baoru announced to the soldiers that he was ordered to confiscate their weapons, reading the original telegram aloud once. The soldiers knew that they could not resist and immediately abandoned their guns in the sailboats, disembarking the Fu'an warship barehanded. The confiscation was completed in less than half an hour. A total of more than three hundred rifles were confiscated, many of which were locally cast miscellaneous guns. They are now handed over to the 62nd Division Headquarters for safekeeping. The unarmed soldiers were transferred back to the Da Sima ship and will be transported to the province in a few days and sent back to their hometowns to return to farming. Deputy Battalion Commander Liang Chengxun and several company commanders were escorted to the division headquarters and telegraphed to the province for instructions. When they were escorted ashore, a company commander tried to escape and was shot by soldiers. Stray bullets killed two pedestrians, Zheng Haiquan and Zheng Jiquan. During the confiscation of weapons, the city was not affected in the slightest. Huang Yuan's regiment, transported by the Fu'an warship, is temporarily stationed in the Wu Family Ancestral Hall area of Qilu, Shantou. On the 23rd, Commander Xiang Hanping, accompanied by First Brigade Commander Zhang Ruigui, gave a lecture to Zhang Jingcheng's troops from the First Regiment of the Independent Brigade and held a joint memorial week. Zhang Jingcheng's troops departed for Dabu on the 24th to secure the Fujian-Guangdong border. Some say they will enter Fujian to assist Zhang Zhen in suppressing the bandits in western Fujian, but this has not yet been confirmed. (February 23rd)</p>

<p>1.  After arriving, they immediately went to the municipal government to visit and inquired about the measures taken by Shantou to prohibit the trafficking of women and children, and what laws were in place to prevent women and children from being driven and sold for export. The municipal government immediately informed them that the municipal government had a Women and Children Going Abroad Interview Office, which was very strict in preventing anomalies. Unless accompanied by their husbands or father and brothers, women and children were not allowed to go abroad alone. In recent years, no trafficking has occurred. On the 27th, the Shantou Women's Relief Association specially initiated a meeting to welcome them. The commission also visited the foreign consulates stationed in Shantou and decided to take the Hai Ning ship to Xiamen on the 28th, and then transfer to Fuzhou, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Liaoning, and other places for on-site investigations.

<h3>Details of the Counterfeit Money Case Cracked in Qingdao</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Counterfeiting Organizations Had Three Locations in Qingdao</p>
<p>▲ Over the Past Five Years, They Have Sold 2 Million Yuan Worth of Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>▲ Nine Principal Offenders Have Been Arrested in Various Locations</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Public Security Bureau cracked a major case last month involving the Japanese Yamazaki Tomisaburo (alias Chou Tian Jizhi Zhu), who was counterfeiting banknotes. The details of the crackdown are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Printing Organizations After Yamazaki Tomisaburo, who was using the alias "Chou Tian Jizhi Zhu," was arrested by the Public Security Bureau, and because the sellers of counterfeit money, Yin Songshan, Sun Rubin, and others, provided evidence, Yamazaki could not deny it and had to confess the truth. All the printing locations were provided by the offender, totaling three places: one at No. 60 Guanxian Road, one at a Russian residence on Hunan Road, and one behind the Dakang Yarn Factory in Dongzhen. According to his confession, all the counterfeit money was printed through eighteen overprinting plates, so it was manufactured in three places to avoid attracting attention. The chief printing technician was Nishijima Misaku, who used to run a printing shop in Tokyo, Japan, and was very skilled in printing technology. The authenticity of the printed banknotes was difficult to distinguish at a glance. Nishijima and Fujimoto were both old friends. In 1926, they invited him to Qingdao to serve as a printing technician. The Japanese Consulate has arrested Nishijima and, together with Yamazaki, is holding him in custody at the Japanese Consulate.</p>
<p>▲ Principal Offenders Arrested The discovery of this counterfeit money dates back to 1926. At that time, it was only known that there was this counterfeit money on the market, and it was known that it was made by the Japanese, but it was not yet expected that its manufacturing organization was nesting among the Japanese residents of Qingdao, who were shielded by consular jurisdiction. This matter originated with Fujisaki Caijiro, Hashimoto Susumu, Tsujita Harujiro, and others taking the initiative. At that time, after they invited the printing technician Nishijima to Qingdao, they organized step by step. Yamazaki Tomisaburo took on the job of sales. Over the years, they have sold 2 million yuan worth of counterfeit money along the Jiaoji Railway and in the Shanghai area. After this case occurred, Fujisaki Caijiro and Hashimoto Susumu both fled to Shanghai, and Tsujita Genjiro fled back to Kyoto, Japan. The Japanese Consulate has stated that Fujisaki and Hashimoto have been arrested in Shanghai, and Tsujita Genjiro has also been arrested in Kyoto and will be brought to justice. In addition, Yoshida Goro, Yamamoto Keishiro, Niimi Ryuichi, and others residing in this city are all important offenders in this case. They are currently being detained and held in custody by the Japanese Consulate.</p>
<p>▲ Seized Stolen Goods After this case was cracked, more than forty types of printing machines, more than 16,000 counterfeit ten-yuan banknotes, and thousands of counterfeit five-yuan and one-yuan banknotes were seized from the counterfeit printing organizations and the residences of the offenders. It can be seen that the Japanese and others were very well-organized. The counterfeit money they printed was not only the ten-yuan type, but also the five-yuan and one-yuan types were printed together to facilitate sales. This matter has a great impact on China's finances. Our banking industry must not take this case lightly. They should unite and petition the government to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese ambassador. Because this counterfeit money is scattered everywhere, society is harmed by it, and the banking industry is even more affected. (March 2nd)</p>
<h3>Trial of the Communist Party Case in Tianjin Concluded</h3>
<p>▲ Yu Xuezhong Has Telegraphed Zhang for Instructions</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: On the evening of the 10th of last month, Zhang Xueming, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, and Liu Butong, member of the Reorganization Committee, arrested Han Qingfu, Chairman of the Special Committee of the Communist Party in the Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan Special Districts, and Zheng Pilie, Chairman of the Military Committee of the Communist Party in the Northern District, and thirty-seven others at the Yuzhong Hotel in the French Concession. On the 16th, they were escorted to Beiping and sent by the Beiping Public Security Bureau to the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters. Commander Yu Xuezhong, considering the seriousness of the case, personally interrogated them for several days. By the 23rd, the entire case had been interrogated. On the 24th, the entire case was telegraphed to Deputy Commander Zhang for instructions. According to those who participated in this interrogation, Han Qingfu and Zheng Pilie were the main figures among the more than thirty people arrested. Han was originally an extremely poor student. After graduating from Peking University, he joined various activities that disrupted social order. In his childhood, he used to sell opium. Later, he joined the Communist Party. In 1924, when the Kuomintang was reorganized, he also joined the Kuomintang. He often used the pretext of luring one or two Mongols, claiming to be Mongolian revolutionary comrades, and swindled large sums of money from Kuomintang figures, using part of it for his personal extravagance and the rest as funding for Communist Party activities. In other words, Han was nominally a member of the Kuomintang, but secretly swindled money from the Kuomintang and worked for the Communist Party. After the Kuomintang's purge of the Communists in 1927, his nomination as a candidate for the Central Executive Committee was revoked. For a time, he joined the Third Party, but later betrayed the Third Party. When he arrived in Tianjin, he still worked for the Third Party. In 1928, when Zhang Zongchang was defeated and retreated to eastern Tianjin, Han, under the name of a Communist commander, collected many refugees and kidnapped the president of the Chamber of Commerce in Yahuangqiao Town, extorting thousands of dollars. Recently, he was extremely bored in Tianjin. It happened that a certain route commander sent his advisor, Du, to Tianjin to purchase weapons. Du was a Communist Party member and a fellow villager with Han. Han then instigated Du to abscond with 250,000 yuan for weapons, allocating part of it for private sharing and the rest as a working fund, recruiting refugees, and establishing his own banner outside the orthodox Communist Party. He used part of the embezzled funds to assign his younger brother, Han Zhizhong, to transport and sell opium in Chifeng, Chaoyang, Jinzhou, and Liaoning. He used another part of the funds to open a car dealership, traveling between Chifeng and Beipiao, ostensibly to transport passengers, but in reality, the purpose was to transport military supplies and support bandits. He also gave a portion of the funds to his relative, Lu Xiangxuan, for high-interest loans. All the remaining profits from selling opium, transporting military supplies, and lending at high interest were used as Han's party working expenses. His work plan was to use Beipiao as a base camp, because there were coal mines in the area, and all the miners were organized by Han into a group, waiting for the opportunity to act. He also colluded with Ma Hongtu and Zhang Chaobin, employees of the Chaoyang Temple Railway Station, and local bandit leaders Li Xiangxuan and Yao Guangxin, among others, to commit kidnapping and robbery in order to collect money. Han proclaimed himself the Zhu De and Mao Zedong of the Northwest and had long planned to take the opportunity to riot, first launching a guerrilla war in Rehe, and then expanding to the northern provinces. Han's ambitions were very great. Last spring, he sent Guo Gaoxuan's wife to Kulun to win over the Communist Party of Outer Mongolia and the Red Russians, planning to integrate all the areas outside the Great Wall with Russia and Mongolia, and then rise up. It is said that Guo's trip has achieved considerable success, but Russia and Mongolia regard Han as an undisciplined member outside the organization of the Chinese Communist Party, so they have not provided substantial assistance. Recently, since Han obtained funds from a certain commander, he recruited troops and horses, and his power has grown. The Communist Party then restored Han's party membership and appointed him as the chairman of the Special Committee of the three districts of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, to show their support. Zheng Pilie was Han's right-hand man, skilled in riding and shooting. All the killings committed by Han's party were done by Zheng. Han initiated the assassination of Wang Zaowen and Li Lanting, Tianjin Communist Party members, in 1928, and Zheng personally fired the shots. Recently, the robbery of a train on the Jin-Chao branch line of the Beiping-Liaoning Railway was also rumored to be related to Han and Zheng. The planning and strategies all came from these people. The bandits who fired the shots were only their pawns. The Rehe natives in Beiping believe that Han's actions are enough to endanger the stability and order of Rehe, and they have jointly petitioned Deputy Commander Zhang to severely punish him in order to eradicate the roots of communism (March 1st).

<p>Xiahengjing Robbery Case Quickly Solved Xiahengjing Town in Punan is a small market town about six li from Tinglin. The previous night (the 2nd), more than twenty bandits suddenly came to the town and searched and robbed all the larger stores before fleeing. Someone followed them and saw the bandits carrying their loot enter a certain village not far away. Knowing their whereabouts, they returned to report to the First Branch of the Tinglin Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to guide them in the search and arrest. Eight people were captured and taken back for investigation. Further arrests and research are pending.</p>
<p>Discussing Methods for Suppressing Bandits The banditry in Punan, within the borders of Songjiang and Jinshan counties, is currently being suppressed on a large scale. At a joint suppression meeting of Songjiang and Jinshan counties the other day, it was decided that all teahouse owners must sign a pledge with the district office. Those who do not comply will be sealed up by the county upon presentation by the district. The county government is responsible for ordering the public security bureaus to seal all opium dens by March 15th. These measures have been implemented separately. In addition, because local hidden spies are often afraid of the bandits' fierceness and fear retaliation, they dare not report them, which is a major obstacle to the suppression effort. The county government has specially instructed the district chiefs of the 12th District (Tinglin), 15th District (Caojing), and 16th District (Shanyang) to set up confidential report boxes and report the establishment and management methods before March 15th. The Construction Bureau is also ordered to expedite the installation of long-distance telephones within the above three districts in order to ensure timely communication.</p>

<p>Fang Baolong Kidnapping Case Bandits Demand Ransom a Second Time Fang Baolong, a resident of Si'an Township, Xiaojing Township, in the 11th District of this county, and his grandson were kidnapped by bandits on January 26. The first time, the bandits sent a letter demanding a price of 100,000 yuan, with the handover location being Liuhou Town in the jurisdiction of Taicang County. It is now known that the family received another letter from the bandits the other day, again demanding a price of 100,000 yuan, but requiring an advance payment of one or two thousand yuan for expenses during the handover. It is reported that the Fang family has not yet gone to redeem them due to time and financial constraints.</p>
<p>Gudeng Society Ordered to Dissolve Fang, a youth of this city, and others initiated the organization of the Gudeng Society in 1929 and published the Gudeng Newspaper. Initially, they gained the sympathy of the community, but by the 18th issue, they suddenly revealed literary propaganda that was close to proletarianism. The county party headquarters issued a serious warning to them. Last month, the society convened a general meeting of members without applying for approval from the party and government agencies. The county party headquarters ordered them to stop, but the society ignored it. The county party headquarters believed that it was not subject to the guidance of the party, so it reported the situation to the province for instructions. Soon, an order was received from the province stating that the society was not subject to the guidance of this party and should be dissolved. After receiving the order, the county party headquarters forwarded it to the county government to dissolve the society.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Lu Shiqiao Reactionary Case Opens Another Hearing Lu Shiqiao, a doctor from Beishang Township, Wuxi, and Lu Genhu, Guo Asi, Zhu A'da, and others were sentenced to imprisonment by the High Court for joining the Communist Party. Lu Shiqiao and others refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. In October of last year, the Supreme Court sent it back to the High Court for retrial. The Second Criminal Division of the High Court has held hearings several times, but it has not been concluded because the subpoenaed witnesses have not reported. Yesterday afternoon (the 4th), the Second Criminal Division held another hearing. Again, it was not concluded because none of the witnesses reported. It will be rescheduled for another hearing. The appeal case of Lu Shiqiao's murder case is scheduled to be heard on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>Another Robbery Case in the Urban Area At approximately 7:00 p.m. the other night, three bandits suddenly came to Yuyuan Rice Store at No. 81 Nanhahou Street outside Limen. One was wearing a black serge long gown, and the other two were wearing short blue cloth uniforms, resembling workers. They carried a pistol and declared that they wanted to borrow 500 yuan. When the shop owner resisted slightly, the bandits grabbed 90 yuan in cash and 40 yuan in banknotes from the cash register drawer and fled. Afterwards, the matter was reported to the Second Branch of the Third Sub-bureau in charge for investigation. That night, a suspect named Zhou Dequan was arrested on the road outside Li Gate and transferred to the bureau for verification. The real perpetrator has fled far away.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Hupu Public Security Bureau Chief Investigated for Embezzlement of Opium On July 28th of last year, the Sixth Branch of the Hupu Public Security Bureau received a report that the Jin Changyu seagoing ship was importing and smuggling opium. Shao Gengsheng, the director of the bureau, led several officers to inspect the ship. As a result, eleven packages of opium were seized and sent to the county. Later, a citizen named Shen Mumu filed a complaint with the county and the Central Anti-Opium Commission, alleging that Director Shao had seized 132.5 pounds of opium, which did not match the amount sent, and that he had obviously embezzled some of it. The Anti-Opium Commission ordered the Civil Affairs Department to transfer the case to the county for investigation. The county sent personnel to the countryside three times to investigate, but the investigation was not thorough. As a result, the Public Security Bureau Director Shao Gengsheng was only given a demerit as a formality. The Civil Affairs Department, after being informed, believed that since it was a case of embezzlement of opium, a demerit was not enough. They instructed the county to investigate further. The county government, after receiving the order, questioned the plaintiff and defendant on January 29th in the administrative section of the county government. The 2nd of this month was the date for the second round of questioning. This time, the defendant, the boatman Chen San, the director of the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, Shao Gengsheng, the plaintiff, Shen Mumu, and the witness, Hu Sheng, the district chief of the 15th District, were all subpoenaed. All except the witness reported on that day. At 2:00 p.m., the examining judge, Gu, opened the court for questioning. First, the defendant, Chen San, was questioned. He testified that he used to be a crew member and is now doing small business. At that time, a fellow crew member reported me for smuggling 2.5 pounds of opium. I was very shocked because Zhu Zhenhuan himself loaded opium in Dalian and brought it back, but instead reported me. So I told them what they said, and Director Shao came to investigate and take it away, totaling eleven packages. Next, the plaintiff, Shen Mumu, was questioned. She testified that when the opium was inspected, I went to see it myself. A sack, a bamboo basket, and a bamboo container were found at the boat wharf behind the district office. In addition, someone was holding 2.5 pounds. If it was not 132.5 pounds, then it was definitely more than eleven packages. There was obvious embezzlement, and there were several suspicious points: (1) Inspecting opium on a ship is within the scope of the water police. Why didn't Director Shao go with the water police to inspect the opium? (2) After it was seized, it was taken to the bureau. District Chief Hu Sheng requested to seal it together, but Shao refused. (3) In this case, the boatman Chen San was dismissed by the shipowner after the incident. Chen had nowhere to go, so Director Shao took him in and appointed him as an inspector. (4) Shao had rendered meritorious service by seizing the opium, so why was he given a demerit by the county government? (5) Shao is a dignified director, and I am a commoner. If it is not true, why doesn't he sue me for false accusation? All of the above are inexplicable questions. I have no feud with him. However, according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions, opium harms society. If anyone conquers opium, he is a public enemy of the people. That is why I stood up to report it. Finally, the defendant, Shao Gengsheng, the director of the Hupu Public Security Bureau, was questioned. He testified that someone reported on July 28th of last year that there was opium on the ship, so I went to inspect it. I opened it with an axe in the partition under the stove and found nine packages, plus two packages in the basket, totaling eleven packages, which were all sent to the county. There was no embezzlement. As for District Chief Hu and Assistant Ren Fei'an, they never came to seal it together, otherwise how could I have refused him? Chen San was also not appointed as an inspector, and the branch bureau does not have this authority, and even the general bureau does not have this title. These are all his words. Please investigate. As a result, the official instructed Shen Mumu to provide a guarantee. Shen said, "If it is not true, just nail me up and put me in prison," and then added a seal and retired. Then, it was ordered to summon the witnesses Hu Sheng and Ren Fei'an for a second hearing. The court adjourned immediately.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Defendant in Murder Case Files an Appeal Guo Zizhen, a resident of Dai Lane near Meirong Mountain in the Sixth District of this county (i.e., Tianxia City), was beaten to death by villagers two years ago. His wife, Mao, filed a petition with the county government to investigate. More than ten people were arrested. Those who were found to be irrelevant after interrogation by the county government were released on bail. However, Zhang Apan, Ni Apei, Ni Rongpei, Dai Chaosheng, and several others were sentenced to four, five, or eight years of imprisonment by the county. Recently, the county court was established, and the county government transferred the case files to the court. Zhang Apan and others were not satisfied with the county judgment and filed an appeal with the High Court. Yesterday, the court sent bailiffs to escort Zhang Apan and others to the High Court for questioning and verification.</p>
<p>County Public Security Bureau's Crackdown on Gambling Causes an Uproar Lu Tianfu, who runs a small teahouse in Daxuankou in the Fourth District, has been opening gambling dens in the countryside for days. Someone came to the city to report to the Supervision Office of the County Public Security Bureau, which dispatched Patrol Chief Chen to lead a squad of police to the scene. They found more than ten gamblers gambling inside and planned to arrest them. The gamblers immediately caused an uproar. Patrol Chief Chen immediately reported to the Ninth Branch of the District Security Bureau and the County Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to the scene one after another. All the gamblers had already escaped. The owner, Lu Tianfu, was arrested and sent to the city for verification. Sixty-Year-Old Man Drowns Himself Liu Wenlan, a resident of this county, was over sixty years old. He used to work for the Beitang Miscellaneous Goods Guild and is now retired at home. Due to economic pressure, he drowned himself under the Xinqiao Bridge inside the Guangfu Gate at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. He was spotted by someone, who pulled Liu out of the water and sent him to the Labor Hospital for treatment, but he died. His son, Da Bao, arrived at the scene to claim the body.</p>

<p>Financial Bureau Reports to the Department on Handover of Previous Magistrates The Financial Bureau received an order from the Department of Finance to submit a register of the handover of previous magistrates that had not been investigated within a time limit. Those that have been investigated but not yet scheduled for a joint accounting should be urged to schedule a joint accounting as soon as possible, or to conduct a joint monitoring and accounting, to conduct a fair accounting, and to submit a register for reporting. According to the investigation, the unfinished handovers of Jiangyin include the seven terms of the former magistrates Zhang Zongyi, Huang Yuzao, Wang Jiajin, Wu Peng, Liu Shou, Zeng Wangzuo, and Shen Bingyan. Except for the five terms of Zhang, Huang, Wu, Liu, and Shen, which have been registered and accounted for, the remaining two terms of Wang Jiajin and Wang Guozuo have also been registered and submitted long ago. Director Shen has repeatedly urged the two former magistrates to come to Cheng as soon as possible for a joint accounting, but there has been no response. The Department of Finance has approved the separate transfer of instructions to the native provinces and local authorities of the two former magistrates, ordering them to come to Cheng for a joint accounting. If there is still no response, the situation will be reported in accordance with the fourth item of the Measures, together with the monitoring and accounting. Yesterday, the handling situation was reported to the Department of Finance for review.</p>

Seeing that the idols in the City God Temple have been destroyed, they negotiated with the local authorities. Today (the 2nd) at 10:00 a.m., hundreds of Taoist priestesses from the city and the countryside, each holding small flag, force shops in the streets to close. Patrol Officer Liu from the Public Security Bureau led the police to stop them and was beaten up by the Taoist priestesses. With no other option, Liu returned to the Bureau.</p>

The headline on page 3 of the first section of your newspaper, under the dateline of Harbin, titled "Dispute at the Chinese Eastern Railway Council Meeting Regarding the Limits of the Director-General's Authority," is not factual.

<h3>Letter from Shen Xun Chu of Zhujiajiao</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: Having read the Qingpu correspondence in the Huang Bao on March 2nd, the section regarding the manager of Changyuan Farm in Zhujiajiao does not accord with the facts. Changyuan was established in the spring of the 18th year [of the Republic] when Xun Chu invited shareholders from Qingjiao to participate. After two years of operation, the profits totaled 12,000 yuan. A shareholders meeting was convened on February 19th of this year to announce the dissolution. All farm affairs have been inspected and handed over to the shareholders. As for Xun Chu's personal debts, they have been forgiven by the shareholders. I have never left Zhujiajiao during the farm's operations. How could I have absconded with the funds and abandoned my family? This matter concerns my reputation and should be corrected. Sincerely, Shen Xun Chu, former Manager of Changyuan Farm in Zhujiajiao, March 4th.</p>

<h3>He Jian Consults the Ministry of Education on Improving School Curricula</h3>
<p>▲Select and Diligently Teach the Maxims of Chinese and Foreign Philosophers</p>
<p>▲Select Individuals of Excellent Scholarship and Conduct to Manage Education</p>
<p>Changsha Communication, February 24th. He Jian, Chairman of the Provincial Government, has repeatedly consulted the Ministry of Education, in addition to pointing out the shortcomings of education and requesting improvements. Yesterday, he again acted upon the detailed report of the Dong'an County Magistrate, requesting improvements to school curricula. He believes that improving textbooks is the most urgent task at present and has consulted the Ministry of Education for verification and action. The original consultation is appended below.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of consultation: According to a statement by former Dong'an County Magistrate Tang Zhengyi, entitled "Improving School Curricula": Schools have been established for more than twenty years, but the majority of those who set up Communist organizations in the past were students, and the majority of those who joined the Communist Party's battle groups this time were also students. The effects of exhausting public and private resources to train these troublemakers are evident. Before the eighth year [of the Republic], the Chinese textbooks in various schools still had literary merit. Recently, the textbooks have been filled with dog-speak, pig-speak, duck-speak, and terms like "Miss Cat," "Elder Brother Dog," and "Old Man Ox," filling the lines. Animals can speak human language, honorifics are applied to animals, and the language is vulgar and bizarre beyond description. There is also a kind of absurd statement (such as "Dad, you help people build houses every day, but you don't have a house yourself"), and (phrases like "My fist is big, my arms are thick"), which are tantamount to promoting communism and inciting violence. Young people's character is not yet firm, and they are often confused by this. If such books are distributed in schools and listed as curricula, it is tantamount to eliminating visible Communists on one hand and creating a large number of invisible Communists on the other. Even if one speaks of eliminating the Communists daily, what benefit is there? Now heresies are rampant, and bandits are growing daily. Fortunately, there are still Confucian scholars in the wilderness who revere morality, and there are still generals in the country who uphold justice, who can contend in the realm of entering people and entering beasts, forming this half-governed, half-chaotic situation. If another few decades pass, humanity will perish, and all will be able to lead beasts to devour people, and people will devour each other. The massacres of Huang Chao, Li Zicheng, and Zhang Xianzhong will not be difficult to see again. I fear that there will be immeasurable and boundless catastrophes. For the present plan, all school textbooks that are difficult and inappropriate, and those with shallow theories that are not practical, should be burned. It is especially appropriate to select and diligently teach the maxims of Chinese and foreign philosophers, and it is necessary to select those with both excellent scholarship and conduct to manage education. This is also a method of dredging rivers to suppress floods and holding fire to drive away fierce beasts. The钧座 [honorific title] issued a telegram in the past year regarding carefully selecting teachers. If the previous proposal is brought up again and implemented, then the merit will be immortal. The house is collapsing, and what is pressed will be destroyed. The rhinoceros horn is not far away, and deep concern is felt. I offer my humble opinion for consideration. Is it appropriate? Please examine it, etc. The review of textbooks is the most urgent task at present. Based on the reasons stated earlier, in addition to the reply, a corresponding consultation is submitted to your department, requesting that it be verified and handled, and hoping to see a reply. This consultation.</p>
<h3>Jinan City Education Administrative Conference</h3>
<p>A Jinan express dispatch states that the Jinan City Education Bureau held the opening ceremony of the Municipal School Education Administrative Conference at the bureau at 8:00 AM today (the 1st). In addition to the bureau director, secretary, section chiefs, inspectors, and directors, the principals of all municipal elementary schools and the directors of various public schools all participated, totaling more than thirty people. The conference was chaired by Zhang Hongjian, Director of the bureau, with Zhang Anzhi as the master of ceremonies and Zhao Zhonglu as the recorder. After the ceremony, the chairman gave the opening speech, roughly stating: "Distinguished principals, distinguished directors, today's first administrative conference of municipal schools is of profound significance and extremely important mission. I will explain it in six points: 1. The Education Bureau has only been established for three months. Although there is an overall plan for how to improve and popularize education in Jinan, the plan may not be thorough due to limited talent and resources. I hope that you will gather together to discuss and assist in the implementation. 2. The highest principle of current education is the Three Principles of the People. How can we make the students and teachers' thoughts converge on the Three Principles of the People? I hope that you will discuss this in detail and formulate the moral education standards and implementation plans for each school based on the Three Principles of the People, in order to realize the Party-based education. 3. We know that under the same circumstances, the quality of teaching methods varies, and the educational efficiency obtained is vastly different. I hope that everyone will base their daily teaching experience and discuss the improvement of teaching methods in detail at this conference. 4. The city's schools are divided into provincial, municipal, and private. Provincial schools have more generous funding, private schools often worry about insufficient funding, and municipal schools have less funding than provincial schools, but are still more numerous than private schools. I hope you will work hard and strive for progress, so as not to fall behind. 5. The budget preparation for the 19th year [of the Republic] may not be suitable in some places. I hope everyone will deliberate and discuss and stipulate the standards for budget distribution in order to prepare the budget for the 20th year. 6. The current funding for each school is relatively difficult. Under these strained circumstances, we should break through the economic difficulties and strive to obtain the greatest effect with the smallest consumption, so that education will have new development. Furthermore, education is divided into social education and school education. School education cultivates talents, which is certainly important, but social education has the function of changing customs and habits and should also be given equal importance. In short, to run education in Jinan City, we must ensure that there are no dropouts in the urban area and that no citizen is illiterate, so that education will be considered a success. But education is a social undertaking, and it cannot be popularized by the efforts of a few people. I especially hope that the citizens of Jinan and the education authorities will work together to seek development," etc. Afterwards, elementary school principals Kong Manqing, Zhou Kejun, Xia Yuzhi, etc., spoke successively. Then Xia Yuxuan was elected as vice chairman, and Wang Guanchen and Zhou Kejun were elected as secretaries. Then the photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The general meeting continued at 2:00 PM and adjourned until 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Righteous Education Office Investigates the General Situation of Righteous Education in the 19th Year [of the Republic]</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education has specially formulated an investigation form (divided into items such as the number of schools, the number of grades, the number of teachers, the number of children, and the amount of funding) in order to investigate the general situation of compulsory education in various counties of the province in the 19th year [of the Republic], and sent a circular to the education bureaus of various counties, saying: "According to the investigation, the Jiangsu Province Compulsory Education Statistical Table prepared by our office has already been submitted to the Ministry of Education for distribution to the education halls and bureaus of various provinces and cities for reference and imitation, and has also been distributed by our office to the education bureaus of various counties in this province for reference. Now the first semester of the 19th year [of the Republic] has passed. The status of righteous education in various counties should continue to be statistically recorded for examination and comparison. Now one copy of the Investigation Form on the General Situation of Righteous Education in the 19th Year [of the Republic] is attached. I hope that your bureau will fill it out and send it to our office on a specified date. Once the statistics are compiled, a table will be prepared and sent. This matter concerns important compulsory education policies. I hope your bureau will earnestly promote it." In addition to the separate letters, a corresponding letter is sent to inquire about the matter.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Director Zhang Hosts Reporters</h3>
<p>Zhang Daoshen, Director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province, held a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 3rd in the conference room of the department to host reporters from various newspapers and news agencies because he had not yet spoken with news reporters since arriving in Zhejiang. More than a dozen reporters attended. Director Zhang chaired the meeting and reported on the administrative policy: (1) The department will immediately handle the registration and selection of all types of educational talents in order to make talents public. (2) Establish an audit committee of all types of educational economics in the province to achieve economic openness. The committee is divided into the following three types: 1. Provincial education economic audit committee, 2. County and municipal education economic audit committees, 3. Education tour and economic audit committees for education institutions, educational administrative institutions, and local educational economic institutions throughout the province. (3) Secondary education: The province currently has two high schools run by Zhejiang University, one provincial high school, three complete middle schools, eight junior high schools, one municipal middle school, four co-educational middle schools, twenty-two county middle schools, and twenty-five private middle schools that are allowed to be established. It is planned to determine administrative standards for improvement. (4) Higher education: In terms of specialized schools, the province only has one provincial specialized school. The Provincial Government has decided that the School of Medicine and Pharmacy must be closed in the 20th year [of the Republic]. There is Zhijiang Liberal Arts College, a private school, and it is planned to urge it to register. In terms of studying abroad, there are currently forty-eight people dispatched to Japan, six people in Europe, and seven people in the United States, for a total of fifty-seven people. There are also detailed reports and complete plans on local education, social education, and education funding. I will omit the lengthy words. Finally, Hu Jianzhong, a reporter from the Hangzhou Minguo Daily, gave a reply, expressing two points of hope: 1. Strictly prevent the National Socialist faction from engaging in activities in the education sector. 2. The hiring and firing of teachers in various schools must break the view of nepotism. The event ended in joy at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Righteous Education Office Publishes Timely Publications</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education has published the 22nd issue of the periodic local education, with fresh content and timeliness. For example, the lesson on the anniversary of the death of the Premier [Sun Yat-sen] is quite suitable for the needs of elementary schools in various places. In addition, the background of elementary school education, examples of children's activities, the experience of guiding elementary school students in keeping diaries, and a lesson on a speech contest are all practical. The second issue of Education and the Countryside, which is attached, contains a study on the establishment of nurseries in rural areas, which is also very important. In addition to subscriptions from the local elementary education sector in this province, educational administrative institutions in provinces such as Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, Zhejiang, Henan, Anhui, Jilin, Chahar, and Liaoning have also enthusiastically subscribed. The price is low, and the materials are practical. It is truly a rare publication in the current elementary school education publishing industry.</p>

<h3>Chinese Medical Association Petitions the Central Government to Revise the Medical Education System</h3>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Executive and Legislative Yuan, advocating that medical education should still adopt the two-tier system in order to be practical. The original petition stated: "The petition is to earnestly request the revision of the medical education system and the restoration of specialized medical schools in order to cultivate daily-use talents and benefit health construction. The establishment of scientific medical education in our country began at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Students were sent to study medicine abroad, and after returning to the country, they united with comrades to establish specialized medical schools in various provinces and cities. For more than ten years, although not many talents have been cultivated, they have opened clinics and established hospitals in major ports to relieve suffering, barely supporting the facade. During the Northern Expedition, tens of thousands of people were killed or injured in years of war. The medical assistance and subsequent treatment provided by these people for field operations was invaluable. Therefore, if our country wants to seek the universality of medicine among the people and the progress of health administration, it should pay attention to improving the quality and, more importantly, increasing the quantity. This is an immutable conclusion. However, in the 17th year [of the Republic], the education authorities forgot the transition and, in the name of vigorously implementing elite medical education, wanted to implement their policy of moving mountains and exceeding seas. They changed the school system and either ordered the immediate closure of specialized medical schools in various provinces that had achieved success, or limited the period for their completion. The number of medical colleges that they advocated was small and the number of students was countable. Except for the Peking and Guangzhou colleges, which replaced the old equipment of the specialized medical schools with a university signboard, the only one that was painstakingly operated was the Wusong Central University Medical College produced by Jiangsu Medical University. The total number of students, combined for all four grades, is less than one hundred. Together with the Peking and Guangzhou colleges, the total number of medical talents graduating each year is less than one hundred and fifty, causing society to sigh for the lack of doctors and youth to cut off people's access to medicine. This is nothing more than the natural and inevitable result of the current situation of lacking both money and talent, and pursuing vain fame. Men of insight in the medical field are worried about it. Therefore, at the first Central Health Conference in the 18th year [of the Republic], two resolutions, numbered 中字第十 and 十二十三, were passed. The main point is to restore the two-tier system in order to train practical talents for the future. The Medical Education System Committee of the former University Council also agreed in the first article of the general outline when formulating the medical school system, which stated that "this standard is divided into two types: specialized medicine and medical colleges or medical universities." Because medical experts are more concerned and know more details, after several careful considerations, everyone agreed that the two-tier system is the urgent need and must be restored. However, the former education authorities, under pressure from public opinion, were able to add an article on setting up a specialized medical department within the university regulations. However, the existing specialized medical schools were limited to closing in stages and were not allowed to exist independently. As a result, the principals of the specialized medical schools in Baoding, Nanchang, Hangzhou, and other places were busy traveling back and forth to the capital for consultations, but no agreement was reached. Some teachers and students were eagerly campaigning to protect the schools, running around calling for help, but without effect. Medical education was precarious, and the impact was that science lagged behind. This was all caused by the former education authorities' ignorance of the needs of the times and their adherence to outdated prejudices. Upon investigation, what is the difference between the equipment standards and professor qualifications of the future medical department attached to the medical college envisioned by the Ministry of Education and the existing specialized medical schools in various provinces? It is nothing more than being confined to narrow interests and engaging in empty talk. I, along with my colleagues, have some knowledge of medical education, and I have repeatedly failed to understand it. If we look at the reality, it is nothing more than destroying what has been accomplished and suspending what is planned. Overturning the rain and clouds is nothing more than the strategy of the monkey-raiser to give three in the morning and four in the evening, and the loss of national economy and talent is already immeasurable. How can this be tolerated? Therefore, I sincerely ask your department to cherish money and talent, measure the national conditions, and imitate the old method of controlling feudalism to create medical talent to help the emergency. Please ask the Ministry of Education to revise the medical education system and allow the restoration of specialized medical schools, so as to cultivate practical talents widely and promote health construction. Please consider and implement it, for the public convenience."</p>

<h3>Labor University's School of Social Sciences Emphasizes Physical Labor</h3>
<p>The School of Social Sciences of the National Labor University has always had a physical labor course. In the past, due to improper allocation of working hours, it hindered students' studies. This semester, Xiong Yunjia, director of the Nuclear Institute, specially discussed with the new President Zhang Yuanruo, re-determined the work plan, and shortened the working hours as appropriate. The school's students are now responsible for typesetting and printing the lecture notes required by the students in order to achieve practical results. It is reported that the school has also organized a technical committee, and there will be an overall plan for the physical labor of all students in the school.</p>

<h3>United Cup Tournament Crucial Match Saturday Guangdong vs. Youth League</h3>

<h3>Shandong to Survey and Determine North China Sports Field</h3>
<p>▲ Expanding the Public Sports Field</p>
<p>Jinan Newsletter: The 15th North China Games track and field events and baseball and tennis teams will be held in Jinan. The Provincial 15th North China Games Preparatory Committee considered that the old site of the Provincial Public Sports Field was insufficient for use, and decided to expand and renovate it. The Department of Construction, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and the Sports Field jointly surveyed the area. Details have been provided in previous correspondence. The survey has now been completed, and the design drawings will be made as soon as the valuation is completed and construction can begin. The original site of the sports field was 54 mu, and 11 mu have been newly purchased, for a total of 65 mu. The current design includes six tennis courts, four team ball courts, and an extended straight track to reduce the angle of the 400-meter track. The total area measures 295 meters long on the east side, 198 meters long on the west side, 180.5 meters long on the south side, and 167 meters long on the north side. A drainage ditch will be built around the entire field. The straight track will be 240 meters long and 12 meters wide. The silk ball court and team ball court will be located next to the east side of the field. The track and field area will include a football field and a baseball field. The baseball game of this conference will be held after the track and field events are completed. A shelter from the wind and rain will be located north of the tennis court, and an athlete registration area will be located south of the team ball court. To the west of the tennis and team ball courts and east of the straight track, a viewing shed will be built for important guests. Viewing platforms will be located to the north and south of the viewing shed. Viewing platforms will also be located to the north of the track and field area, outside the circular track, and to the east and west of the chairman's shed. Viewing platforms will also be located to the south and west of the circular track. The viewing platforms will be constructed of stone. The eastern viewing platform will have two sides, with a height of a dozen layers, and will be able to accommodate more than 30,000 people. Railings will be set up in front of the viewing platforms and inside the circular track. Only staff and athletes will be allowed to enter the field. Doors will be set up at appropriate locations in the railings to serve as entrances to the field. A total of six toilets will be set up throughout the field. A well will be opened in the original office building, and an additional office will be set up to the west. With this expansion and renovation, the field will be sufficient for the conference, and the road to Thousand Buddha Mountain will be to the west of the sports field, and the road to Kaiyuan Temple will be to the east. Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu ordered the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to build a flat road before the conference, which will further enhance the scenery.</p>

<p>▲ What Shanghai Citizens Should Know About the National Assembly "Why is the National Assembly convened this year?" The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was held from November 12th to 18th, 1930. During this meeting, it was decided to convene the National Assembly in the capital on May 5, 1931. Originally, the National Assembly was what the Premier hoped to see realized in the shortest possible time, but due to the successive disturbances and obstacles created by feudal warlords and other reactionary elements over the years, it has been delayed until now. If the Central Government had convened the National Assembly during that time of crisis, what would have been convened would have been a conference of warlords, politicians, and vagrants to divide the spoils, and it would certainly not have been the conference that the Premier wanted to convene and that the people hoped to see convened, a National Assembly in which the people could truly express their own opinions and views when the local areas were free from the oppression and coercion of the warlords. Therefore, the Central Government is only implementing the convening of the National Assembly this year, when the wars have been pacified and the country is in a stable state, which is truly in line with the Premier's legacy, which must be realized in the shortest possible time. "The significant difference between the National Assembly and the National Congress" Some people may not be very clear about the nature of the National Assembly and the National Congress and may easily misunderstand them. In fact, the National Assembly and the National Congress do have differences, the most significant of which are: 1. Different organizations; 2. Different powers. The organizational difference, first of all, in terms of organization, the National Assembly is organized by representatives of existing professional groups across the country, its content is determined by the Premier at that time as modern industrial groups, chambers of commerce, educational associations, universities, provincial student federations, labor unions, and farmers' associations, which together oppose Cao Wu's various armies, and political parties, while the National Congress is not. Article 14 of the Founding Outline states, "After the establishment of local autonomous governments in each county, one national representative shall be elected to form a representative assembly to participate in central political affairs." In this way, it is clear that the National Congress is organized by representatives elected by each autonomous county, which is very different from the organization of the National Assembly. The difference in powers, secondly, in terms of powers, the purpose of our party's advocacy of convening the National Assembly is to unify the minds and aspirations of the people across the country in order to seek the unification and construction of China, to solve the national livelihood problems internally, and to break the political and economic aggression of the great powers externally. This is just as the Premier said, "The destiny of the Republic of China lies in the self-determination of the people. If our party can obtain the assistance of the people, then the goals of China's independence, freedom, and unification will surely be achieved through struggle." Therefore, the National Assembly is a gathering to solve important issues in the current period of political tutelage. As for the National Congress, Article 23 of the Founding Outline states, "Then the National Congress shall be convened to determine the constitution and promulgate it." Article 24 also states, "Then the National Congress shall have the right to elect and recall officials of the central government, and shall have the right to initiate and veto central laws." According to this, the powers of the National Congress, in a negative sense, are to amend the constitution and laws and to punish government personnel for dereliction of duty. In other words, it is the highest authority for the people to exercise political power, which is significantly different from the National Assembly. "The important mission of the National Assembly" Since we have recognized the different characteristics of the National Assembly and the National Congress, we can now simply and affirmatively say that the National Congress is a gathering in a time of national prosperity, while the National Assembly is an important gathering to solve the life and death of the Chinese nation at present, and it is the only key to achieving peaceful unification and eternal freedom from war. The reason why China has not been able to unify and build in the past is really the result of the interaction between the people's suffering and the aggression of the great powers. We should take advantage of this unprecedented and unrepeatable National Assembly to gather the minds and aspirations of the people across the country and concentrate the abilities of the people across the country to make a proper solution in order to establish the foundation of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and to create a Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People. All Chinese citizens should pay full attention to this. "Stipulating a Provisional Constitution" The previous paragraph was about the important mission of the National Assembly. In fact, during this grand meeting, we should also do the most important and urgent thing, which is to have all the representatives in the meeting establish a provisional constitution that the Chinese Kuomintang and the people of the whole country jointly abide by within the scope of the political tutelage of the Three Principles of the People, in order to establish a grand plan for long-term peace and stability. Because the meaning of the word "provisional" is originally "economy" and "restraint", now we sincerely hope that all the representatives in the meeting will earnestly study all the Premier's teachings, extract the clauses, and use them as a restraint between the government and the people in order to establish the foundation of a political system for all the people. This is something that must be especially emphasized. "Number of National Representatives" Now the National Assembly Representative Election Law and the National Assembly Representative Election Law Enforcement Law have been promulgated by the National Government one after another. The total number of National Assembly representatives is 520. "Number of Representatives from this City" This city should elect five representatives. "Groups that Produce Representatives" These five representatives are elected by (1) farmers' associations elect two representatives; (2) labor unions elect one representative; (3) chambers of commerce and industrial groups elect one representative; (4) educational associations, national universities, universities registered with the Ministry of Education, and freelance professional groups elect one representative; (5) the Chinese Kuomintang elects one representative. However, the farmers' associations, labor unions, chambers of commerce, educational associations, and other groups mentioned above are limited to those established in accordance with the law. As for industrial groups, they should also meet the following two conditions: (1) their members are indeed engaged in various industries with capital or skills; (2) they have been registered with the competent authorities. The freelance professional groups mentioned above include professional groups organized by news reporters, lawyers, doctors, engineers, and accountants who have been registered with the competent authorities. "Scope of Representative Production" Because the number of people in each group is very large, the scope of representative production has to be stipulated. In the farmers' association, the representatives should be elected by the members of the district farmers' associations in this city who attend the municipal farmers' association. In the labor union, the representatives should be elected by the members of the district labor unions in this city. As for the representatives of the chambers of commerce and industrial groups, they should be elected by the members of the same trade associations and stores in this city who attend the municipal chamber of commerce and the members of the industrial groups. Regarding the fourth article, the representatives of the educational association, national universities, universities registered with the Ministry of Education, and freelance professional groups should be elected by the members of the district educational associations in this city who attend the municipal educational association, and the current faculty and staff and undergraduate students in national universities registered with the Ministry of Education, and the members in freelance professional groups. In addition, one representative of the Chinese Kuomintang is elected by all the members in this city in the district branch when they hold a party member congress from among the candidates proposed by the central government. The above is the scope of representative production. We will explain the standards and qualifications of the elected candidates below. "Standards of Elected Candidates" Since we know that the mission of this National Assembly is very important, the representatives who attend this meeting should of course be very perfect people. Therefore, we should not elect those who (1) have committed counter-revolutionary acts that have been determined by a judgment or are still wanted; (2) have been found guilty of corruption while serving in public office; (3) have been deprived of their civil rights and have not yet been restored; (4) have mental illness or bad habits; (5) have been members of the Chinese Kuomintang and have been expelled from the party or had their party rights suspended. "Qualifications of Elected Candidates" Not only that, but even if a person does not have the bad behaviors mentioned above, we still cannot consider him to have the qualifications to serve as a representative of the National Assembly. For example, if a person has only two or three years of experience in the righteous business, he certainly cannot thoroughly understand the rural living conditions and the rural economic conditions. How can he represent the general farmers to attend the National Assembly? Therefore, the central government has also stipulated considerable restrictions on the qualifications of representatives. This restriction is that regardless of which sector the elected candidate is, they must have been engaged in the business of that sector for the following number of years and have not yet changed careers: (1) engaged in agriculture for more than ten years; (2) engaged in industry or commerce for more than five years; (3) engaged in education for more than five years; (4) engaged in various freelance professions for more than five years. "Content of Compiling Registers" Before holding the election, each group should first compile a register for Star News to review. The following should be stated in this register: (1) the organizational charter, establishment procedures, and process; (2) the registration authority and the date of registration; (3) the names and brief biographies of the staff; (4) the names, ages, birthplaces, addresses, and the number of years they have been engaged in the profession of the members; (5) if a member is also a member of another group, then the name of the other group and the group selected by the member should be stated. When compiling the register, people with the same surname should be combined and written together to facilitate review. "Announcement of the General Register of Electors" After the election supervisor in this city receives the aforementioned register, he will submit it for review. After the review is completed, he will compile the general register of electors and the register of electors for each group in this city by occupation and announce them on a regular basis. "Methods for Errors and Omissions" After the register is announced, if anyone believes that there are errors or omissions, they can obtain evidence and submit it to the election supervisor in this city for verification within five days. "Regulations for Withdrawing from the Election Venue" The venues and dates for the elections of various groups in this city are designated and announced by the election supervisor in this city. However, we should maintain order when we are in the election venue and do not make noise. If there are the following circumstances: (1) impersonation; (2) making noise in the venue, persuading others, and refusing to obey orders; (3) carrying weapons into the venue; (4) suspected of interfering with the election; (5) other improper behavior and refusing to obey orders, then the election personnel will order the elector to withdraw from the election venue. This is a very shameful thing. "Election Tickets are Completely Invalid" As for filling out the election tickets, you should be very careful, and the handwriting should be clear and not sloppy, because the Election Law Enforcement Law stipulates that all of the following are completely invalid: 1. those that are not written in the prescribed format; 2. those that have other characters written on them (but the addresses, occupations, and years of engagement in the occupation of the elected candidates are not subject to this restriction); 3. those that do not use the ballot paper issued. "Election Tickets are Completely Invalid or Partially Invalid" This is because, all of the following have the possibility of being completely invalid or partially invalid: 1. the handwriting is blurred and cannot be recognized; 2. the elected candidate is not in the general register of electors; 3. the occupation of the elected candidate does not belong to that sector. These must be paid special attention to. "Methods for Natural Disasters or Accidents" There is one more point that can be mentioned in passing, that is, if a natural disaster or other accident occurs in this city when handling the election, so that voting cannot be carried out, then the voting administrator can report to the election supervisor in this city and request a change in the voting date and voting venue. After the change, another announcement will be made. "The Election is Completed and the Ballots are Counted" We have voting administrators, ballot counting administrators, and election supervisors in the election venue. They are responsible for the various responsibilities of voting administration, ballot counting administration, and election supervision, respectively. After the voting is completed, the ballot counting administrator will start counting the ballots and continue until it is completed. "Notes for Elected Candidates" After the ballot counting is completed, those who receive the most votes are elected. If you are elected, the election supervisor in this city will give you a certificate of election. After you receive the certificate of election, you should indicate in writing within ten days that you are willing to be elected. If you do not indicate within the deadline, it will be considered that you are unwilling to be elected, and the person with the next highest number of votes will be substituted. If you are willing to be elected, then you should prepare all your luggage and quietly wait for the order of the National Government. This order is to notify you of the date to go to the capital. You should go to report within the deadline and verify your certificate of election. The above can be said to be a few common points of discussion regarding this election of National Assembly representatives. As for the details of each point, we would like to ask you to refer to the "Election Guide" published by this office.</p>

<h3>Methods for Exemption of Customs Duties on Cotton Textiles Have Been Determined</h3>
<p>▲ Exchange Yarn Tax Bills for Fabric Shipping Bills</p>
<p>The textile industry is exempt from customs duties when cotton yarn that has been subject to the consolidated tax is made into dyed and woven products for export. This has been clearly stated in the regulations for the collection of the consolidated tax on cotton yarn promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. However, because the implementation procedures have not yet been determined, customs duties are still being collected as usual. This has become an important issue for the textile industry. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Zhu Wenqi, Chairman of the Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association, to inquire about the details. According to him, the industry has contacted the Consolidated Tax Office and the Jiangsu Consolidated Tax Bureau successively and has determined the following methods: All yarns that have been subject to the consolidated tax will not be subject to customs duties when they are made into woven products. However, when transporting and exporting, the yarn tax bills that have been subject to the consolidated tax must be submitted to the bureau in exchange for shipping bills, that is, the weight on the yarn tax bills will be used to offset the weight of the fabric (for example, each yarn tax bill is for 415 pounds of yarn, which can be exchanged for 415 pounds of fabric shipping bills). In order to facilitate the exchange of military supplies by various factories, the Consolidated Tax Bureau can send personnel to be stationed permanently in the Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association to handle this procedure. The above-mentioned methods have been submitted by the Jiangsu Consolidated Tax Bureau to the Consolidated Tax Bureau for approval and should be implemented in a few days.</p>
<h3>After Customs Brokers Cease Reporting Cotton Yarn Shipments</h3>
<p>▲The Yarn Manufacturers Association requests immediate compliance with reporting</p>
<p>▲Customs Brokers to hold a general meeting today to discuss the matter</p>
<p>The city's customs brokers, faced with increased complexities and the need to advance customs duties after cotton yarn and cloth factories paid consolidated taxes, have ceased copying the "black corner" permits from the Customs House. This cessation is to maintain their professional interests.  They ceased reporting cotton cloth, yarn, and other goods from the first of this month and notified the Chinese Cotton Yarn Manufacturers Association and the Cotton Cloth Traders Association. Yesterday, the Chinese Cotton Yarn Manufacturers Association replied, stating: "Regarding your letter of February 28th, stating that despite the imposition of consolidated taxes on yarn and cloth, the Jianghai Customs still requires inspection and tax payment, causing significant advances in funds and burdensome procedures, a temporary general meeting resolved that as of March 1st, they will not be able to transport yarn and cloth without permits. After investigating, it was found that the Customs still collects taxes on yarn and cloth that have already paid consolidated taxes.  The Association has repeatedly negotiated with the Consolidated Tax Office. According to their reply, the Customs' re-assessment of cotton yarn and cloth has been addressed by sending a letter to the Customs Administration to instruct the Customs to cease collection. The Director-General of Customs replied that this order was issued in mid-March and circulated to all customs offices on the 20th, stipulating that customs duties collected on cotton yarn and other goods after February 1st should be refunded upon presentation of consolidated tax certificates. Accordingly, all customs offices should comply with this order, and there should be no more instances of re-assessment obstructing transportation. As for the inspection issue, it is a necessary procedure for the Customs. It is indeed very cumbersome, time-consuming, and inconvenient. However, due to legal requirements, it is not possible to request exemption from inspection. Moreover, the Customs is still in the trial phase regarding cotton cloth and cotton yarn for which consolidated taxes have been collected. Even if we want to request accommodation, we must wait two months before we can calmly present the actual difficulties and seek their adoption. The Association is in the same position, with the same interests, and will assist in any way possible. Please urge your association to quickly discuss sending colleagues to resume transportation as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary significant losses to both parties. We are sending this message for your information." The Cotton Cloth Traders Association has also replied to the Association, requesting that it immediately resume reporting to avoid significant losses. After considering the situation, the Customs Brokers Association has decided to convene a general meeting of all members today to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegram Organizing a Business Tax Research Committee</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce sent a telegram stating: To the Provincial Federations of Commerce of Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, Rehe, Chahar, Fengtian, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Provinces; the Guangdong Merchant Organization Steering Committee; the General Chambers of Commerce of Guizhou, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Nanning; the Chambers of Commerce of Ningxia and Kangding Counties; and the Chambers of Commerce of Beijing, Nanjing, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Hankou: With the abolition of likin and the implementation of business taxes to compensate for the loss of likin revenue, the implementation has been carried out in order. However, the business tax collection regulations promulgated by the provincial governments may be inappropriate or flawed due to officials being unable to concurrently engage in commerce and therefore being unfamiliar with commercial situations. The tax rates and collection methods may be either too lenient or too harsh, resulting in many difficulties in implementation. Jiangsu Province has already initiated the process, with the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce convening all chambers of commerce in the province to discuss the classification of business taxes and tax rate issues, as well as to discuss the reorganization of the Provincial Federation of Commerce. With the implementation of the provincial business tax imminent, the classification of business taxes, tax rates, and collection methods should be studied by merchants in each province and presented to the respective provincial and municipal governments. This will hopefully ensure cooperation between officials and merchants and maximize the benefits of implementation. We are sending this telegram for your information, and we hope that each Federation of Commerce, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, General Chamber of Commerce in the provincial capital, and County Chamber of Commerce will immediately send a telegram convening all chambers of commerce in their respective provinces to send representatives to organize a Business Tax Research Committee. The Committee should appropriately devise methods, review the classification, tax rates, and methods, and submit them to the provincial and municipal governments for implementation, ensuring that the national treasury is enriched without exhausting the people and that the tax base is wealthy without imposing harsh rates. If the provincial and municipal governments do not adopt them, please have the respective Provincial Federations of Commerce and Municipal Chambers of Commerce telegram detailed information to this Federation. This Federation will immediately forward it to the Ministry of Finance to request approval for implementation and to discuss reorganization and the organization of the Provincial Federation of Commerce. We hope that the establishment will be completed within a limited time. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce; Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, Permanent Committee Members; Bowing respectfully.</p>

<p>Guomin She reports that the Municipal First District Agricultural Consolidation Association submitted a presentation to the Municipal Party Headquarters opposing the organizational law that uses the District Farmers Association as the basic organization and requesting the promulgation of the organizational system of the Municipal Farmers Association. A person in charge of the Civil Training Association of the Municipal Party Headquarters told a Guomin She reporter that the Association has not yet received the presentation. However, the Association believes that the proposal of the District Farmers Association to establish Township Farmers Associations under the District Farmers Associations is legally inconsistent and that the accusations of monopoly and control are absurd.

<h3>Election of Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Two Railway Party Headquarters</h3>

<h3>Jiang Dingwen Held a Funeral for His Ancestors in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Over a Thousand Important Figures from All Walks of Life Attended</p>
<p>Mr. Zilang, the respected father of the Ninth Division Commander Jiang Dingwen, passed away from illness in his native Zhuji on September 4th of last year. Soon after, Madam Yu, Jiang's stepmother, also passed away in her hometown on December 8th of the same year. At that time, Jiang was at the front participating in the anti-rebellion work and was deeply saddened by the news. Therefore, he specially established a funeral preparation office in Shanghai to hold a funeral for his ancestors. The hall was set up in the Xu Garden on Connaught Road. The Chengzhu ceremony was held the day before yesterday (3rd), and yesterday (4th), representatives of important figures from the Central Government and the National Government, representatives of various Party, government, military, and police agencies in the city, and well-known figures from the Shanghai business, industry, and academic circles, numbering about a thousand people, attended. There was heavy traffic in front of the Xu Garden, and the scene was extremely grand. The sacrificial banners and elegiac couplets were beautiful. The layout of the sacrificial hall was extremely solemn. After the representatives and guests offered their condolences, Jiang Dingwen personally returned the greetings one by one and provided vegetarian meals with utmost care. It is said that Jiang's family is a prominent clan in eastern Zhejiang, with a tradition of scholarship. When Jiang Dingwen was young, his father taught him the principles of filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, and righteousness as the foundation for life, as well as the world situation and the gains and losses of governance in ancient and modern times. He also repeatedly exhorted him to distinguish between right and wrong, understand obedience and rebellion, be public-spirited and forgetful of self, and be patriotic and forgetful of family. The achievements of Commander Jiang today are due to this excellent family education.</p>
<h3>Anqing Steamboat Strike: Authorities Mediate</h3>
<p>The entire workforce, led by Lu Shuangxi, Li Changsheng, etc., of the Anqing steamboat of the Taikoo Company, opposed the comprador Fan Chenghua's forced collection of meal money from the middle-cabin workers, resulting in a major labor strike. The Seamen's Union negotiated with the company without success and was forced to petition the Ministry of Industry for assistance. The Ministry has now notified the Municipal Government for verification. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Workers' Conditions: After learning that Zhu Shaobai had been detained by the police, all the workers were overly frightened and became mentally ill. They angrily sent the worker to Tongde Hospital for treatment. He has now been discharged from the hospital but has not fully recovered. They submitted four conditions to the company, requesting that the comprador comply: (1) Restore Zhu Shaobai's job; (2) Compensate Zhu Shaobai for medical expenses; (3) The comprador should voluntarily clear the case with the police; (4) Never force middle-cabin workers to pay meal money. The comprador insisted on refusing, and there was no way to resolve the matter. The Seamen's Union then petitioned the Ministry of Industry for assistance. Because the incident occurred in Shanghai, the Ministry immediately ordered the Municipal Government to handle it.</p>
<p>▲Comprador's Submission: After the incident, the comprador Fan Chenghua submitted a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to convene a mediation in order to prevent the strike from escalating. He stated that the tea room meal subsidy was the same on all Taikoo Company ships and was not something that Chenghua could change on his own. How could it be called extortion? Unexpectedly, the tea room foreman Zhu Shaobai asked to collect the meal subsidy every time the ship arrived. At first, he tried to negotiate, then he procrastinated, and finally, he refused to pay and even used harsh words and was about to use force. Chenghua is in his sixties and weak. How could he withstand this intimidation? For the sake of self-defense, he had to call the police for temporary custody to avoid harm. He was soon released on bail and there was no oppression. Therefore, he requested that the authorities thoroughly investigate and uphold justice and allow for prompt and public mediation.</p>
<p>▲Authorities' Mediation: After receiving the notification from the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Government immediately sent staff to negotiate with the French police and learned that the worker Zhu Shaobai had been released. The police agreed to pay special attention to similar incidents in the future. Because the matter concerned labor disputes, the Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to verify the matter and handle it. At the same time, the Secretariat sent a letter to the Seamen's Union. After receiving the instructions from the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Yuanlin to thoroughly investigate the matter in order to verify it.</p>
<h3>Continued News of the Gonghe Case</h3>
<p>Since the Seamen's Union took over the handling of the Gonghe Steamboat tea room dispute, Shen Huating has personally gone to Wuhu to surrender himself. The investigators sent to Wuhu by the Shanghai Seamen's Branch have returned to Shanghai and reported the truth to the General Union (the original report is very long, omitted). The murderers in this case are Hu Keming, Cheng Youbiao, Cao Wenzhi, Lao Chi, Song Weihua, Wan Xi, Jin Bangcai, and others, a total of nine people, who have been detained by the Wuhu Court. A notice was issued yesterday as follows: Notice regarding the fact that after the Dianan case on the Gonghe Steamboat occurred this year, it was rumored that Shen Huating had colluded with a number of illegal compradors and planned to use money to hire gangsters to disguise themselves as passengers on the ship, deliberately causing trouble in order to destroy the workers and disrupt the labor movement. After hearing this information, the Union believes that this conspiracy has a significant impact on the future of our seamen. Therefore, in addition to reporting the situation to the Central Government and the General Union for record, we hereby notify all workers to take note. In the future, all workers should treat people with courtesy and work carefully to show vigilance. This is important. This notice is issued on March 4, 2020, by He Zhenhuan, Lu Lezhi, and Tang Hesheng, Permanent Committee Members.</p>
<h3>News After Price Increases on Jianghai Steamboats</h3>
<p>▲Opposition and Handling</p>
<p>▲Hankou Passenger Gangs Oppose the Alliance of the Six Yangtze River Companies, Deciding to Increase Fares by 30% Starting March 16th: After this matter was announced, it aroused opposition from all the customs brokers in Hankou. Yesterday, the Hankou Customs Brokers Association sent a telegram to the Shanghai Chinese Steamboat Bureaus, stating that the alliance of the six companies, with Chinese and foreign joint management, was an act of national humiliation and should be stopped immediately. At the same time, they also telegraphed the Central Government, ordering the companies to stop increasing fees and forming alliances. Yesterday, China Merchants, Sanbei, Ning, and Shao held a meeting on this matter, believing that the Hankou customs brokers could not understand the steamboat bureaus' situation and replied to the association, stating that the fee increase could not be stopped.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai and Ningbo Decide to Increase Prices: Ningbo liners increased water footings due to the addition of escort teams, arousing opposition from the passenger gangs in Ningbo. After repeated negotiations, Sanbei, Ning, Shao, China Merchants, and others repeatedly decided to increase the freight rate for various goods by 12.5% and to treat passengers who declare goods with a discount of 95% according to the rates agreed upon in July of the 19th year in order to give preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Yin Ruli Requests Relief for Shaanxi Disaster</h3>
<p>Mr. Yin Ruli of Xi'an sent a telegram: To Mr. Zhang Shenzhi of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, and forwarded to Xu Junren, Zhuang Songfu, Wang Yiting, Yu Lunqing, Wu Zhihao, Wang Xiaolai, Chu Huiseng, Qu Wenliu, Zhou Shouliang, gentlemen, and all comrades: I came to Qin at the invitation of Chairman Yang Huchen to seek old travels, but I only increased my feelings of sadness. Everywhere I went, I saw disaster and famine. Villages were in ruins, and starving people were everywhere. Travelers coming from the west and going to the east can all testify to this, so I won't go into detail. After arriving in the province and contacting local people, I learned that the situation in the hardest-hit areas was even more tragic, with the old and weak dying and corpses exposed. The 8 million Shaanxi disaster relief bonds and the cigarette disaster relief surtax are two matters that you will surely be able to promote with your enthusiasm and determination. However, there are starving people everywhere here waiting to be fed. If the delay continues, more people will die. Please find a way to expedite the implementation so that spring relief can be organized in time. The barren fields can also be cultivated with the help of rain and snow. The people are waiting eagerly and urgently. If it is not possible to see the completion of the project immediately, please also find a way to advance several tens of thousands of yuan to alleviate the immediate crisis. I am making this request on behalf of the people and await good news. Yin Ruli bows. Winter.</p>

<h3>The Gaochang Temple Tram Can Be Restored Immediately</h3>
<p>▲Mayor Zhang Comes Forward to Mediate</p>
<p>The labor dispute between the workers of the Chinese Electric Tramway and the craftsmen of the naval aircraft field, resulting in the shortening of routes, has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper.

The union will then hold a committee meeting to make a decision before it can comply. Therefore, the results were not available until 6:00 p.m. yesterday. It is generally expected that the tramway in the Gaochang Temple area will be restored first within a day or two.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Board Discusses Purchasing the Dahua Hotel</h3>
<p>▲Directors Divided on the Issue</p>
<p>The proposal to purchase the Dahua Hotel by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been widely discussed recently. The initial price was rumored to be over 4.2 million taels.

<h3>Sand Fishing Boats Registered and Managed Like Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>▲Abolish the Sand Fishing Name</p>
<p>▲Increase Cargo Ship Grades</p>
<p>Sand fishing boats entering and leaving the Wusongkou in the city were previously registered by the Municipal Port Affairs Bureau. There was a sand fishing boat registration office in Wusong. At the end of the 19th year, the Port Affairs Bureau was abolished, and the relevant affairs were transferred to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. The Bureau then changed the sand fishing boat registration office to the Wu Port Shipping Office, and all sand fishing boats and cargo ships were registered, inspected, and issued licenses. Now, in order to classify sand fishing boats according to their nature as one of the types of cargo ships, the Municipal Government approved the abolition of the sand fishing boat name and managed them in the same way as other cargo ships in order to unify them. In addition, the cargo ships only have seven grades, but there are many sand fishing boats with an area above the seventh grade. The Finance Bureau also determined the grades of cargo ships and increased them to twelve. Generally, the eighth grade is for 100 square meters or more, and each additional 100 square meters increases by one grade, up to the twelfth grade for 500 square meters or more. It is reported that the registration of sand fishing boats according to cargo ships will soon be announced.</p>

<h3>The Intermittent Greyhound Racing Issue</h3>
<h3>Only Members Allowed to Enter</h3>
<h3>The Municipal Council Has Yet to Comment</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that since the Municipal Council limited the two parks to cease greyhound racing by the end of this month, news emerged from reliable sources yesterday afternoon that the Greyhound Racing Association, which operates the Ming Garden, is now planning to switch to member-only races, limiting entry to members only who can gamble on the outcomes, operating entirely as a club, hoping to continue greyhound racing and avoid interference from the Municipal Council. In order to verify the facts, the reporter tried to locate the association's secretary, Ke Ming, last night, but was unable to meet him. However, when questioned other staff members of the association, although they were unwilling to comment, they did not deny the news. Subsequently, a visit was made to Fessenden, the director-general of the Municipal Council, who stated that the association had not yet discussed this plan with the Municipal Council, so the Municipal Council's attitude could not be expressed at this time. However, it is heard that a few weeks ago, Fessenden stated that if greyhound racing and gambling were limited to members only, then the Municipal Council would likely not object.</p>
<h3>Ferry Overloaded, Capsizes, Drowning Five People</h3>
<h3>Bodies Not Yet Recovered</h3>
<h3>Authorities Should Pay Attention</h3>
<p>At 8:45 PM the night before last, thirteen dockworkers hired a Wusong sampan operated by a Suzhou woman named Xie at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou to cross to Pudong. The boat was small and there were too many people, making the situation quite dangerous. When the boat reached near the Xiangsheng Iron Factory in Pudong, it encountered a slightly larger wave, and the boat was unable to support the weight and sank in an instant. All the passengers on the boat, including Xie, fell into the water. However, due to thick clothing, most of them floated on the surface of the river, shouting for help. At that time, a Fuxing Company's Kang small steamship happened to pass by, heard the cries, and immediately stopped to attempt a rescue. The ship rescued passengers Ren Shigen, Zhang Honglu, Huang Fuqing, Chen Rongfu, Gao Renhua, Li Chenghua, Gui Chenglin, Xi Youlin, and the boat woman Xie, a total of nine people. Five other passengers could not be saved in time and drowned. Their bodies sank without a trace. The small steamship took the rescued people to the water police station, where they dried their wet clothes and were instructed to go ashore and return home. However, Xie was still responsible and was sent to the local court by Chinese detective Wu Rongsheng for disposition yesterday. The names, ages, and addresses of the deceased are recorded below: (1) Qian Fugen, 26 years old, from Pudong, residing at the east end of the Pudong Cao'an head; (2) Liang Linbao, 32 years old, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 22, Pudong Huayuan Stone Bridge; (3) Tang Gen, 31 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 7, west end of the Pudong Third District Police Station; (4) Sun Liugen, 26 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 24, Pudong 93rd Lane; (5) Gao Fubao, 30 years old, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 7, Pudong Huayuan Stone Bridge. It is heard that none of the bodies were found yesterday.</p>
<h3>Twelve Extortion Letters from One Person</h3>
<h3>Authenticated by Detective Mei Yu of the Police Station</h3>
<h3>All Written by Gu Wannian</h3>
<h3>Yu Qing Testifies in Court</h3>
<h3>The Court Must Summon Cheng Linsheng</h3>
<p>The home of Cheng Linsheng, a wealthy Anhui merchant residing at No. 1550 Jing'an Temple Road, received eight threatening letters delivered by mail last month, attempting to extort 30,000 dollars. The case was discovered by Chinese detectives Jin Yangwu, Liu Ronggen, and Bao detective Wang Daofu of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who arrested the suspects Gu Wannian, the apprentice chauffeur hired by the Cheng mansion, Zhang Changshan, the gatekeeper, Wang Rusong, the accountant, and Yang Zhenyuan, the bodyguard of Yu Qing of No. 161 Yu Garden Road, and sent them to the Special District Court. According to Gu Wannian's initial confession, the matter was a conspiracy between him and Zhang, Yang, and Wang to extort money. He then suddenly recanted and denied the charges, and the matter was adjourned to a later date to summon Cheng to court for verification.</p>
<h3>Mei Yu Authenticates - Yesterday morning, Judge Ge Zhitan reopened the trial. According to police lawyer Wang Yaotang, during the adjournment of the case, it was discovered that the defendants had also written four threatening letters in January of this year, delivered to the home of Yu Qing at No. 116 Yu Garden Road, attempting to extort a large sum of money. All the threatening letters in the two cases were sent to Mr. Mei Yu for authentication by the police station. Now that Mei has arrived in court, he can prove it.</h3>
<h3>One Person's Handwriting - Subsequently, Mei Yu testified that he works at the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. All the threatening letters, a total of twelve, were carefully enlarged and examined by me. I have determined that they were written by one person, the first defendant Gu Wannian. Because Gu had written several slips of paper at the police station, his handwriting was identical to the handwriting in the fourth letter received by Cheng Linsheng. The places where they are the same have been marked with an "X" next to the words.</h3>
<h3>You Are Rich, I Am Poor - Detective Jin also complained that all twelve letters were stamped with the post office date. According to my investigation, they were all issued by the Jing'an Temple Road Post Office. The victim Yu Qing also complained that he has been in the money business. At the end of the eleventh lunar month of last year, he suddenly received a threatening letter, which stated: "You are rich, I am poor, lend me 200 dollars. Although you have bodyguards, doormen, and Russian drivers, you only have three pistols. We have five pistols. If you do not agree, you must be careful of your life," etc.</h3>
<h3>Involving Bodyguards - Subsequently, he received a second letter demanding 60,000 dollars, with three locations for contact. He ignored all of them and did not report to the police station. When he received the third and fourth letters, the wording became even more intense and included words threatening to kidnap him, so he reported to the police. The third defendant, Yang Zhenyuan, has been my bodyguard since 1927, with a monthly salary of 54 dollars. His character has been good on weekdays. I did not know about Yang's arrest beforehand. When I saw it in the newspaper, I learned the reason for the arrest. Yesterday, a police detective came and told me to come to court today, so I am here. However, I do not know any of the defendants except Yang, etc.</h3>
<h3>Summon Cheng Linsheng - The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Chen Ying to appear in court on their behalf. When questioned, Gu Wannian confessed that he wrote the five letters to Cheng Linsheng and the four letters to Yu Qing. He also wrote the addresses on three letters to Cheng, and Wang Rusong wrote two of the letters, and the author of one letter remained unknown. The rest of his testimony was the same as his previous confession in court. When questioned, the remaining three defendants still denied the charges. After Judge Ge verified the confessions, he ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and summoned Cheng Linsheng to court for verification.</h3>
<h3>Zhen Dan University Student Li Shusheng Attempts Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<h3>Neither Due to Economic Hardship</h3>
<h3>Nor Due to Romantic Disappointment</h3>
<h3>Perhaps Due to Failing Exams</h3>
<h3>Or Due to Contracting Madness</h3>
<p>At 6:25 PM the day before yesterday, a handsome young man in a suit boarded the Longmao Zhan ferry from the Bund outside the Public Concession's Fourth Avenue to cross to Pudong. Just as it arrived at the Pudong dock, before it had docked, the young man, taking advantage of people's inattentiveness, jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. He sank in an instant, then floated up again. The ferry's sailors managed to rescue him and sent him to Police Chief Guo stationed at the wharf, who transferred him to the Third District. District Chief Zhang Mingqin ordered the police to take off his wet clothes. He was wearing a yellow woolen short overcoat, a serge suit, a wool undershirt, and a white linen undershirt. In his pockets, he had a total of 95 dollars in notes from the Bank of Communications and the Zhongnan Bank, 6 silver dollars, a watch, 18 cents in small silver coins, 22 copper coins, an order form from the National Clothing Company, a voucher from the Phoenix Men and Women's Hair Salon, a leather bag, and two complimentary tickets to the New World Company's rooftop garden. The young man's face was gray and he was shivering uncontrollably. He was ordered to change into an old police uniform. When asked his name, he refused to tell the truth. Late at night, he became slightly clearer and said his name was Li Shusheng, 19 years old, from Neijiang, Sichuan, and he was a student at Zhen Dan University in this city, residing at No. 30 Yongyi Lane, Jiangwan. He also had a younger brother named Xican, who was also studying at Datong School in Shanghai. When asked about the reason for his suicide attempt, he again stared blankly and did not answer. The district chief instructed the police to keep a close watch on him and investigated the school. It turned out that Li had asked the guard at the gate for a rifle that morning, intending to kill himself, but was unsuccessful. He also took a kitchen knife to cut his own throat, but it was also taken away, so surveillance was increased to prevent accidents. In the afternoon, his cousin Xie Xumu and classmate Wan Shi Wu brought a letter of certification from Zhen Dan University to the district and asked to take Li away. According to Xie, Li had a total of six brothers and a wealthy family. He was usually of upright character. It is difficult to believe that he suffered from economic pressure or romantic disappointment. The reasons for the suicide attempt were likely one of two: (1) Li failed the school's major exam last year, leading to thoughts of ending his life; (2) Li's father had suffered from madness for 16 years, or he was affected by hereditary influence. The district chief then allowed the two men to take Li away.</p>
<h3>Miao Liucheng Confesses to Kidnapping Liu Tongyun</h3>
<h3>Conspiring with Ji Taozi and Others</h3>
<h3>The Court Adjourns for Re-Trial</h3>
<p>Chinese detectives Shao Jingfan, Wang Youshan, Xu Decheng, etc., of the Gordon Road Police Station apprehended a bandit named Miao Liucheng (also known as A'er) from Jiangbei at No. 774 Taopeng Road the morning before yesterday and brought him to the police station. It was discovered that Miao was involved in the case of the kidnapping of Liu Tongyun, the manager of the Fuji Paper Shop in Chun Geng Lane, Ai Duo Ya Road, on the evening of September 19th last year, in which the perpetrators held weapons and demanded a huge ransom. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the police station sent Miao Liucheng to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, saying that the French Police had arrested a criminal named Ji Taozi (also known as Xiao Taozi) in the case of the kidnapping of Liu Tongyun. He was interrogated by the French Court and sentenced to five years of imprisonment, after which he will be sent to the Mainland authorities for trial. Liu Tongyun lives at No. 434 Pu Bo Road in the French Concession and opened the Fuji Paper Shop in Chun Geng Lane, Ai Duo Ya Road. He had previously received a threatening letter. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, Liu took his own car, driven by the chauffeur Yang Afu, to the World Bookstore. After finishing his business, he returned to the shop at 4:00 PM. The chauffeur was dozing in the car. At 8:15 PM, Liu wanted to go out again. Just as he was getting into the car, four kidnappers suddenly came, brandished pistols, and threatened to make a scene. They forced Liu into the car and sped away. How Liu escaped afterwards is unknown. Liu has not appeared in court today and requested an adjournment. The defendant Xi Kai of the defendant confessed that he and Ji Taozi and four others kidnapped Liu and hid him opposite the bathhouse on Minguo Road. I was also monitored by those people, so I guarded the hostage with A'san and others. After Judge Ge Zhitan verified the confession, he said that the incident occurred in the jurisdiction of the General Patrol, and according to the court's trial procedure, the case should be handed over by the General Patrol. However, the police lawyer said that there is no specific procedure for handing over the case. Now that this case has been solved by the Gordon Road Police Station, it may be necessary to jointly handle it with the Chief Inspector's Office in the future. Judge Ge then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and re-examined in a week.</p>

<h3>A Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Cai Shangen</p>
<p>▲ In first love, one rushes to live together. After marriage, one rushes to separate. "All have a beginning, but few an end." This is true in the modern age.</p>
<p>▲ When in school, one often envies those who work in society. But after entering society to seek work, one envies the former self in school.</p>
<p>▲ When one is pursuing an ideal, one feels happy about everything. But after realizing it, one realizes that it is nothing more than that, and even feels that it is of no interest.</p>
<p>▲ Every time I see a small fox kept by a wealthy and noble person, being held in the arms of its mistress and going out in a car with her, I think of the poor and lowly compatriots who are far below them.</p>
<p>▲ Generally, in schools in large commercial ports, the faculty and staff are often commercialized. In the capital where the government is located, they are often bureaucratized. This can be proven by observing the schools in Shanghai and the former Peiping and the current Nanjing.</p>
<p>▲ The past is already dissatisfied with the present, and the present will also be dissatisfied with the future. It is truly as the saying goes, "Later generations will view the present as the present views the past. They have already attacked their predecessors and replaced them. Later generations will also attack them and replace them." In this, it can also be said that "The way people view me is the way I view people."</p>
<p>▲ The so-called happiness and suffering in the world are actually only temporary. Once happiness has passed, one no longer feels the happiness. Once suffering has passed, one no longer feels the suffering. But it does not stop there. Often, extreme happiness breeds sorrow. Therefore, happiness is not worth cherishing. Moreover, if a person has not suffered first, he will not be able to see the joy of what he later obtains. Therefore, suffering is also indispensable.</p>
<h3>Professor Lu's Bronze Utensil Hobby</h3>
<p>— Wan Cheng</p>
<p>Professor Lu Xirong (Jin Hou), Ph.D., of Great China University and former Director of Education of Yunnan Province, is honest and simple. He has been teaching at Great China for many years and has never casually missed a class. Even in heavy wind and rain, he arrives on time. His patient and encouraging teaching has always been admired by students.</p>
<p>Professor Lu has a hobby for bronze. His residence is on Mendeland Road. All the daily utensils in his residence are mostly made of bronze. In particular, there are many bronze antique objects in his study, such as bronze vases, bronze pen holders, bronze bookshelves, and various bronze birds and animals, which are precious and lovely. In short, everything in his study is made of bronze. Professor Lu is from Yunnan Province, and Yunnan produces copper. Could it be that the professor's bronze hobby is also due to geography?</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Wu Guandai</h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Wu Guandai was a native of Liangxi and a famous modern painter. Unfortunately, he passed away last year, and everyone who heard of it regretted it. A visitor narrated his anecdotes, saying that his family was originally poor and humble, but later it flourished. Truly, he was "the son of a plowing ox" and "the sweet spring has no source," so there is no need to discuss family background. When he was young, he studied with a tutor. One day, the tutor went out, and three friends came to visit but did not meet him and left. When the tutor returned, everyone told him that guests had come to visit. The tutor asked for the guests' names. The guests did not say their names, and no one asked, so they could not answer. The tutor was annoyed. Then, Wu Guandai stepped forward and said, "Since the guests' names are unknown, I still remember their appearance. Now, I will draw them for the teacher." He dipped his brush in ink and finished the drawing in a short time. One of them was thin, with a gaunt face, a high nose, and a slight beard. Another was fat and short, with small eyes and full cheeks. The third was of medium build and wore sunglasses. He presented the drawings to the tutor. As soon as the tutor saw them, he exclaimed, "These are my old friends Lin Fuchang, Liu Qixiang, and Lü Qianzhi! Why have they come?" Then, he turned to Wu Guandai and said, "I truly did not know that you possessed this skill. I hope you will not abandon it." It can be seen that Wu Guandai was rich in artistic talent. From then on, Wu Guandai was determined to pursue painting. However, at that time, those who studied painting with a teacher were required to pay a fee of 200 taels of gold, 10 shi of rice, and two banquets, and to lodge in the teacher's home for a period of three years. Wu Guandai could not afford it, so he could not become a student. Moreover, the true works of ancient masters were mostly collected by wealthy families, locked away and kept secret, and only those who were close friends were allowed to see them. Therefore, Wu Guandai went to mounting shops every day to admire their brushwork. After a long time, the shopkeepers became annoyed and refused to let him in. A man named Ding, who lived next door to the shop and had served in the capital, heard about this and was angry, saying, "Paintings are looked at all day long; does it lose a single hair? How can lowly workers be so arrogant?" He summoned the shopkeepers and reprimanded them, agreeing to let Wu Guandai watch without objection. Wu Guandai's painting improved day by day, and his figures and ladies were excellent. Few could compete with him. At that time, a fellow villager named Zhang Shouyi, who specialized in landscape painting, knew Wu Guandai and guided him to view the Song and Yuan paintings collected by the Qin family. Qin's ancestor was the author of *Tongyin Lunhua* (Essays on Painting from the Paulownia Shade). Having seen a wide range of works, Wu Guandai's own works became even better. Then, Zhang taught Wu to paint landscapes, and Wu taught Zhang to paint figures. Zhang could not succeed in painting figures, but Wu succeeded in painting landscapes. In a few years, his fame surpassed Zhang Shouyi. However, connoisseurs believed that he was not as good as Zhang Shouyi. Some said that his late works were mostly done by his disciples, and Wu only made minor corrections. Wu once accompanied Lian Nanhuzhi to Beijing and stayed for a long time, so his name spread throughout the north and south.</p>
<h3>A Record of Director Chen's Oath Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Director Chen Xizeng held an oath ceremony at 10 AM on the 2nd of this month. He invited people from all walks of life to participate in advance, and many attended. Here is a record of what I saw and heard.</p>
<p>I went at half past ten. When I arrived at the entrance of the Public Security Bureau, I saw that the road was blocked by people standing and looking around. After being asked for an invitation card by the guard, I was led to the signing desk at the second entrance to sign my name. Several dozen armed patrol teams were standing in the courtyard, lined up in rows, in an orderly manner. In front of the auditorium, a large shed of five bays was specially built, with four large characters "Oath Ceremony" hanging in the middle. Beside it were four bamboo cloth banners with the words "Relieve the People's Suffering," "Protect the People's Interests," "Complete the Model Police District," and "Promote the Spirit of Fearlessness." Inside the shed, all the respectful officials of the city were standing in the middle, with hardly any space. On both sides, there were three long tables arranged in a river shape, covered with white tablecloths. On the tables were tea and snacks provided by the Atlantic Western Food Company, as well as several cans of Mei Lanfang cigarettes. The guests were seated on either side of the tables. At that time, Mayor Zhang was giving a speech. Because the distance was too far, I could only see him speaking and gesturing, but I could not hear the meaning of what he was saying. Soon, I saw Central Committee member Chu Minyi, wearing a black cloak, standing upright in the police officer team. The greeter did not pay attention at first. When the master of ceremonies called out loudly to invite Committee member Chu to give a speech, he was led to the stage and given a seat. More than ten people of the opposite sex, all wearing leather-collared coats, stood around him. Because they were humble and did not sit down, I found it very strange. I then asked Hong Lanxiang, who said that these people were all female detectives, who were subordinates rather than guests, and I suddenly understood. When Yu Suqiao asked the guests to speak, no one responded. Mayor Zhang pointed to Ye Huijun, and everyone applauded in agreement. Ye Huijun did not decline further because someone was supporting him, so he went to the stage. Because Ye's speech was both serious and humorous, I couldn't help but listen, so I pushed my way inside. Ye said that Director Chen was a revolutionary comrade. He heard that after taking office as the Director of the Public Security Bureau, he had worked extraordinarily hard. He not only stayed in the bureau but also secretly went to various districts in the late night to examine the diligence of his subordinates. This kind of director cannot be compared with those who only think about three meals a day and sleeping at night. He also compared the recent rampant thieves, where the Chinese concession was safer than the foreign concession, but there were still such cases, to ordinary typhoid fever and latent typhoid fever, and asked Director Chen to prevent problems before they happen and treat them as soon as possible. His speech was humorous and amusing, and those who heard it laughed. After the ceremony, the guests went to the stage to congratulate the director. There were many people and the hall was narrow, which caused Director Chen to be surrounded. They shook hands one by one, and it took about twenty minutes to finish. I took this opportunity to visit the auditorium and saw the souvenirs presented by various circles, all displayed on the three tables under the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. In the middle were two two-foot-high silver tripods. Other silver cups and shields surrounded them. The engraved characters were dazzling and beautiful. Under the rectangular silver shield sent by Yang Hu was a piece of white paper six inches wide and eight inches long. Looking closely, I realized that it was the oath that Director Chen took today. The text was very simple, the characters were upright, and it was sealed with a small seal, which was quite solemn. Then, we went to the courtyard to take photos. The guests sat in the front row, and the police officers stood around in the back. The photographer took four photos for the sake of solemnity. Then, the meeting adjourned. I returned and wrote this record.</p>
<h3>Record of a Difficult Birth of Twins</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>A few days ago, a man named Jiang from the countryside outside the South Gate of our county had a wife who was giving birth. The delivery was difficult. The midwives were not familiar with the operation, which caused the baby to be injured and die when it was born. The matter was very strange, so I write this record of it.</p>
<p>Initially, I heard that the woman felt unusually severe abdominal pain and was quite worried. She called the midwife to come, but after a long time, there was no movement. The whole family was frightened, fearing that something might happen. They did not wait for the melon to ripen and fall, and the disaster began. Now the mother is still in a critical period.</p>
<p>At that time, the baby came out first. The head was very large, like a baby over a year old, or even more. However, due to the injury, the eyebrows and eyes were moved to the top of the head, and there seemed to be no beard below. Those who saw it were shocked and at a loss. Unexpectedly, after a while, another one came out, which was tiny, no different from a fetal cat. They were twins, and both were female.</p>
<p>Old customs consider strange fetuses to be unlucky. The news spread far and wide, and neighbors came to visit and watch. They all thought it should be exposed, not hidden, so it was hung on a power pole. Later, the city's public education hall heard about it and ordered people to collect it and store it in a glass bottle, filled with alcohol, for research.</p>
<p>Those who do not know think that one baby's skull is too large, so they consider it a monkey, and say that its ears grow under its ribs. These are all rumors and different words. One fetus's body development was incomplete, resulting in unequal comparison. They hastily said that a human gave birth to a monkey and a cat, calling it a fetal demon. This is truly a case of being surprised by rare things.</p>
<p>Some say that when these two fetuses first fell down, their backs were connected by flesh and could not be separated. Later, they were cut open with a knife, so now in the bottle, there are bloodstains on each back, which are still vaguely visible. The small one's ears droop down on the edges, which is different from the usual state. This is what is different. So I especially recorded it.</p>
<h3>My View on *Journey to the West*</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shiseng</p>
<p>Plays are inherently fake, but the performers must act seriously. Otherwise, it is not enough to move the audience. Therefore, writing a play is not easy, and the performers cannot be sloppy. The current play *Journey to the West* is popular on various stages and can be called a *Journey to the West* craze. The important characters in the play, such as Tang Sanzang, are not comparable to ordinary monks. He is indeed morally noble. Secondly, Sun Wukong's skills are superb, and his actions will never be like those of today's vulgar monks. Even Zhu Bajie and Sha Seng, whose skills are not as good as Wukong's, will never violate Buddhist rules. Moreover, they are Tang Sanzang's disciples, wholeheartedly and diligently following their master on the journey to obtain the scriptures. Their aspirations are extraordinary. This can be seen here. However, there is still evidence to verify Tang Sanzang. In fact, Wukong, Bajie, and Sha Seng did not exist. Today, various stages want to perform them as interludes. They must be cautious about their actions. If they add the ugly behavior of modern people to them, they will inevitably lose their original appearance. Isn't that a pity? You must know that everything benefits from morality, and enjoyment can last long. Otherwise, even if it develops, I am afraid it will be difficult to last. Although there is freedom of action under the clear blue sky and white sun, the Three Principles of the People still want to preserve our inherent good Chinese morality. I hope that the owners of various stages and the giants of the theater industry will still start with morality in the theater. Business is not difficult to have the hope of development. The future will certainly be grand.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdote of an Ape Addicted to Smoking</h3>
<p>— Cangfu</p>
<p>Years ago, I was a guest in Shouchun. At that time, Wang Hanming's Thirteenth Army of the Zhilu Army was stationed in Shouchun. The army had two cavalry battalions, which were trained by an ape. When the ape mounted the horse, it would advance; when it dismounted, it would retreat. Whenever it was dispatched, the ape was always given weapons to lead the way. One day, it was heard that the Party Army Yue Xiangru occupied Zhengyang. Wang督队 set off. It was already midnight. Wang first ordered the旅长 Song Yong'an of his unit to lead two infantry regiments as the vanguard, and he led the cavalry to follow behind. Unexpectedly, the ape suddenly fell off the horse in the middle of the road. When the cavalry saw the ape dismount, they all ran back. Wang suspected that the enemy had been discovered and followed the cavalry back to Shouchun. Afterwards, it was learned that the ape had a smoking addiction, which was caused by the ape keeper being an opium addict. Whenever he lay on his bed and smoked, the ape would sit and watch for a long time, and eventually became addicted. Every time it set off, the ape keeper had to spray it with smoke first, and the ape would be full of energy. This time, due to the urgent order, it did not have time to spray the smoke, and the ape's addiction flared up, causing this loss. This is also an interesting anecdote.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (130)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>In Burmese custom, when the morning rice is cooked, they first send their son or daughter to wear the best dishes and rice on their heads to offer to the nearby temple. Then the monks eat by themselves. However, their love of giving may not be economical. A friend visited them. A family of several people could not afford food and clothing. When asked why, they said that they had dozens of yuan several years ago, which they gave all away, and now they have come to this. However, they do not regret it. Because if people are poor, they can become monks. After becoming a monk, it is easy to get alms, and it is not difficult to become rich. Lao Tzu said, "The more he does for others, the more he has himself. The more he gives to others, the more he has himself." Is this what the Burmese are talking about?</p>
<p>There are Indian performers who bury a bamboo pole on the street, which can be three or four zhang long. One person holds the bottom of the pole, and a man wearing chicken feathers performs. He climbs the bamboo to the top and performs various stretching exercises. It is not strange. After a while, he goes down to the ground, puts several tile pots on his head, and climbs the pole again. He can make various poses at the top, which is very difficult. It is an old Indian custom to swallow knives and spit fire. Therefore, this is just a minor skill.</p>
<p>On the 9th, I bought a local lacquer box, which is similar to the lacquerware of our Fujian, but slightly inferior in color. It can also be played with. Before leaving, I wrote a couplet for Pengcheng, saying, "The Han people are glorious, and Yao and Shun are civilized." At 12 o'clock, my clan sent me to the ship back to Yangon in two cars. I still took the boat that came to Bassein last time. Second class is nine yuan, which is what the English call "first class." There is no shower, and it is at the stern of the ship. It is not as good as the third class in the open on the boat, which has wind. And the price is three times as much. Therefore, the price of second-class and third-class boats and cars here is three times as much. I still live in the cabin that I came to last time. It is very hot, and there is no one to greet me. The tea room cannot be called. Tolstoy once said, "Only third-class cars can be ridden." I believe it. However, Chinese tourists go to foreign countries and sometimes take second class for the sake of face. In fact, in various regions of Southeast Asia, taking second class is the most disadvantageous thing. Because the waiters here do not entertain, and the berths are narrow and confined to a small room. It is far不如 being in a public place, as long as there is a mat, you can arbitrarily occupy the land of a square zhang. Taking a second-class cabin in a Southeast Asian ship is foolish. I know it and step into it. What to do?</p>
<p>On the ship, the moon at night is bright as a picture, illuminating the river is very beautiful. Only small insects come in search of light, so I dare not turn on the electric light.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 10th, I arrived in Yangon. The Burmese on the same ship got up a quarter of an hour earlier, and it took them about half a point to wrap their headscarves in front of the mirror. Westerners are very disgusted with the constraints of collar and tie and are willing to promote Chinese clothes. I especially hate the inconvenience of the tie. Men in Western suits are far inferior to women in terms of freedom. Now, the Burmese's headscarves are also difficult to dress up like this. It can truly prove the convenience of Chinese clothes, which are superior to all countries. Convenience is civilization.</p>
<p>Returning to Yangon, I still live in the Anxi Guild Hall. The Double Tenth Festival was very lively that day. The students paraded in cars.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Plummets</h3>
<p>▲ Cash Export Ban Rumors</p>
<p>▲ Gold Price Plummets Dramatically: Yesterday, March 4th, Plunged to 3.7 Taels</p>
<p>The market suddenly turned weak. It started calm in the morning but plummeted sharply at noon. The price fell by more than twenty taels, a rapid change that was unpredictable. The bid-ask spread was only a little over one tael to three or four taels, but the daily difference was as high as twenty-five taels. Foreign exchange rates also weakened. There were more sellers than buyers in the market. In the early market, companies such as Qian Changxiang, Cheng Feng, Yongxin, and Heng had sales, while Zhifeng, Yongtong, Taichang, and arbitrageurs were buying. The overseas silver market was calm, but there were buyers in both India and the United States, causing the gold price to open low. Later, there was a slight rebound, hovering around 770 taels. Around noon, rumors spread about a ban on cash exports and internal disputes in Japan, causing public panic. Overall, exchange rates eased, and major players actively sold off, creating an unfavorable environment. The market price declined sharply, falling twenty taels, and the outlook was weak. It suddenly broke through fifty taels, but still rebounded by five taels. Companies like Bingxing and Hanheng were selling, while Zhifeng Yong and retail investors were buying. On Wednesday, there was no market for exchange rates, and the final gold price was only 48 or 49 taels. This morning, it was predicted that large-scale short selling would increase by a quarter.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon Trading Plunge Gathers Momentum: The April gold market opened lower by 2.4 mace in the morning, at 770 taels and 5 candareens. Large-scale forward contracts fell slightly by one-sixteenth, while recent contracts and silver prices remained unchanged. However, private telegraphs showed a rise of one-sixteenth, causing market sentiment to weaken. The price then fell to 69.5 taels. Soon after, Fuyu and others bought in, and because the British gold market was stable, Shanghai Mitsui and others offered May contracts at 124,375. Some in the industry bought, causing the gold price to rebound by 3 taels, reaching 72 taels and 7 candareens. However, retail investors sold again, causing the price to fall by 2 taels. The initial announcement was unchanged, with the price at 70 taels and 5 candareens to 1 tael 3 or 4 candareens. Afterward, the market was flat, with fluctuations of only one or two taels. Trading was slow. At 9:50 AM, the price was 69.5 taels, and around 10:30 AM, it reached 71 taels 2 or 3 candareens. The foreign exchange market saw interbank trading between Chinese and Japanese banks for March and April Citibank contracts at 29.25 yuan. Mai Bank offered British gold at 12.5. Afterward, the market suddenly weakened, and there were many sellers, such as Hengxing and Yuanheng. Around 11:00 AM, the price was around 70 taels. Then, rumors spread, creating a chaotic and dangerous atmosphere. In just over forty minutes, the price plunged a huge 20 taels unexpectedly. British and American exchange rates suddenly weakened. British gold was quoted at 12.625, then 68.75, and American gold was purchased at 29.625 to 75 yuan. Many major players with floating profits rushed to sell, such as Chengfeng, Yongxin, Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Qianchangxiang. Zhifeng, Yongyuan, and Yongfu also competed to sell. By the closing, the price was 52 taels, then 52 taels and 5 candareens. The market closed slightly lower by one tael, with the official price still at 826 taels and 2 candareens, or 54 or 55 taels to 73 or 74 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Post-Market Increasingly Unsustainable: The post-market opened at 49 taels, then fell from 48 taels and 5 candareens to 51 taels, a residual effect of the afternoon's trading. Neixing and others tended to sell, causing the price to suddenly drop to 47 taels and 5 candareens. It then rebounded by more than 5 taels, as Zhifeng, Yongyuan, and Yongfu bought in. Around 2:20 PM, the price was 53 taels. Afterward, retail investors sold, causing the price to drop by more than 4 taels. At 3:15 PM, the price was 48 taels and 5 candareens, then immediately rose by 3 or 4 taels, reaching 52 taels 2 or 3 candareens. Because some short sellers covered their positions, Dadecheng, Hanheng, and others sold, leaving the market in a weak state. At 4:00 PM, the price was 48 taels, and soon after, it was pulled up to 50 taels. However, sellers continued to sell, and the price fell back to 47 taels and 5 candareens. By the 4:30 PM close, the price was 49 taels and 2 candareens, a sharp drop of 23 taels and 7 candareens compared to the previous day. The turbulence was difficult to manage, and many new long positions were visibly worried. After the closing, the price fell further to over 48 taels. The day's highest price was 72 taels and 7 candareens, and the lowest price was 47 taels and 5 candareens, a difference of 25 taels and 2 candareens. The spot price was 70 taels and 2 candareens in the morning, 53 taels at the noon close, and 49 taels and a half in the afternoon. The closing price was 49 taels, a decrease of 77 or 78 taels. The book prices were 46 taels and 53 taels, and the margin calls were 46 taels and 42 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Strong Selling Pressure: According to trading activity, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Yongfengcheng, and Shunli bought more than they sold. Wanxing, Yongfeng, Fuyu, and Yuanheng bought first and then sold. Tong Taichang, Yuantai, and the spot market all bought. Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, and Yu Da supplied more than they could sell. Chengfeng Yong, Xinxing, Yuansheng, and speculators with floating profits all sold. Futaiheng, Taifengcheng, and Hengxing had mixed buying and selling activity. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong, Yuantai, and Yuanmao Yong all bought. Spot arbitrageurs bought and sold quickly. Wanxing, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Yu Da, Bingxing, and Hanheng all sold. The Dalian gang traded a total of 1,200 to 1,300 contracts, with similar buying and selling activity. The Guangdong gang sold 100 to 200 contracts and bought 400 to 500 contracts.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Weak and Unsustainable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets were quite calm, but there were many buyers. British and American exchange rates fell by 0.0625 to 0.125. The market was calm. Yokohama and Kobe were very calm. The HSBC exchange rates in Shanghai did not fluctuate. However, the bank buying price for forward contracts increased by 0.125 for British gold, to 1 shilling and 3 pence and 0.25 to 0.5 pence. The French franc increased by 5 yuan, to 780 yuan. Domestically, the market was calm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon. The gold market was affected, and prices plummeted by more than 20 taels, breaking 750 taels. By the afternoon close, British gold was up 0.25 and American gold was up 0.05625 compared to the previous day, while Japanese gold was down 0.03. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was typically no market. Chinese gold companies initially bought and then sold, with weak trading activity. Yufa Xiang and others settled purchases, while Fuchang and others sold. About 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Banks such as Shanghai Mitsui and Mai Bank sold. Taiwan and Holland bought slightly. Several banks traded tens of thousands of pounds against each other, and $200,000 of American gold was traded. Platinum trading remained scarce, and the market trend was weak.</p>
<h3>Foreign Silver Market Quiet and Unchanged</h3>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Silk Markets Firm in the Morning, Weak in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market was firm in the morning but fell in the afternoon, mainly because of slow sales of spot yarn. Factories inevitably accumulated inventory, and market sentiment was weak. However, the price of Dongyang Three-Grade Yarn steadily increased, so the bulls were strong. In the afternoon, the gold price fell sharply, and there was talk of maintaining the silver price, so selling pressure increased, and the price fell by one or two taels.</p>
<p>▲ Humanity Marketers Finally Relax: The humanity marketers opened the morning market with flat sentiment, each dropping 3, 5 candareens to one or two taels. In the second or third rounds, profit-takers covered their positions, causing each to rebound by 4, 6, 7, 9 candareens. In the afternoon, the sudden fall in the gold market caused the general sentiment to become weak, and selling pressure was heavier, causing each to fall by one tael and 1.3 candareens. The total trading volume for the day was 21,250 bales. Gengfeng sold 900 bales, Ruidai 800 bales, Shenchang 950 bales, and Tongxing 800 bales. Rongxing bought 1,850 bales, Xincheng 700 bales, Yichang 800 bales, and Heshen 900 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>| Contract Month | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>

<p>| May | 1727 |  | 631,750 |</p>
<p>| June | 1730 |  | 50,400 |</p>
<p>| July | 1728 | -6 | 14,500 |</p>

<p>▲ No Major Progress in Yarn Sales: Spot yarn sales were relatively active. Total purchases for the day were only 740 bales. Traders bought 210 bales, and the market was flat. Traders from inland provinces bought 350 bales, Ningbo 60 bales, Xuzhou 15 bales, Yunnan 260 bales, Guangdong 20 bales, Nanjing 10 bales, Qinhuangdao 20 bales, and Shantou 5 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton market was very strong because buyers were bullish and unwilling to relax. However, the trend of foreign cotton was more moderate. However, the calculations had to be based on silver prices, so prices were still high. Therefore, buyers had a strong bullish sentiment. However, spot cotton trading was slow. Factories were increasingly reluctant to purchase because the yarn market was weak.</p>
<p>▲ Humanity Cotton Increases 3 Mace: The Humanity Cotton Market opened the morning session with flat sentiment due to the moderate foreign cotton market. However, there was a lack of sellers in the market, with each market increasing by 2, 3, and 4 mace. In the afternoon, news of the significant drop in the gold market caused each to drop by 3 to 4 mace. During the second and third sessions, it rebounded again. The result was a drop of 1 mace and 5 candareens for each session. The total transaction volume for the day was 46,000 dan. Yuda sold 2,300 dan, Zhenda 1,400 dan, Shenchang 2,300 dan, and Yuanda 2,400 dan. Rongxing bought 3,000 dan, Hengde 1,800 dan, Changfeng 2,500 dan, and Xiesheng 2,500 dan.

<p>Shaanxi Flower 47.00, 150 pieces of spot goods were delivered to the factory by Tongxing Factory.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Quiet and Strong, Three-Grade Products Again High</h3>
<p>▲ Fellow Traders Purchase: Yesterday, the American cotton market was initially quiet and firm due to a lack of administrators. Subsequently, the price rose as fellow traders and New Orleans traders purchased, resulting in gains and losses of 1 to 7 pounds of sound (a unit of measure). Spot goods remained unchanged. British cotton futures fell 1 point, while spot goods remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton futures fell 5 points. Japanese traders purchased Indian cotton, and brokers sold, resulting in a drop of 1 rupee for both near-term and forward deliveries of Pingguoer. Omula rose 1 rupee, forward deliveries remained unchanged, Bailuoxi remained unchanged, and forward deliveries fell 1 rupee. The original telegrams are recorded below (dated the 3rd):</p>
<p>| U.S. Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | Equivalent to Chinese Standards | British Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | Equivalent to Chinese Standards |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Markets Turn Downward Across the Board</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, there were many boats coming down the river, exceeding 50. Sales in all directions became stagnant, and the situation trended towards decline. White rice fell by half a jiao, and special-grade rice was scarce. Only high-quality rice was more plentiful. The sale of thin rice was slow and poor, and the market was slightly weak. Because the supply of Yangxian rice was scarce, the price remained stable and unchanged. Dujian rice was selling very few with limited trading. The overall price decreased by half a chi, becoming yin and stagnant with few transactions, and the price lacked strength.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South: Yesterday, there were more than ten boats arriving, and sales were unusually quiet. Chang and Su rice each fell by one or two jiao. Buyers were not interested due to sufficient inventory, with only a few small retail transactions. The arrival and sale of early thin rice by the Southern gang was sluggish and weak, falling slightly by one jiao. Although the supply of Yang Dujian rice was scarce, the market was mediocre, and the price was slightly discounted. The route for white yuan was unchanged, and the market waited and watched, with a tired market.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened with a flat and tired pattern for all months in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Although foreign wheat quotes improved by one or two jiao, they did not have a significant impact on the overall price. However, major manufacturers continued to sell off their large holdings of foreign wheat, causing the longer-dated months to remain weak. The price for standard spot goods in the near-term remained around 2 taels and 2.5 candareens, which was far from the standard, so the market remained stable. As a result, the current month improved by 0.005 compared to the previous day, April decreased slightly by 0.005, May increased significantly by 0.005, June decreased slightly by 0.005, and July/August decreased slightly by 0.0025.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Trend from Flat to Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in both the morning and afternoon sessions, each month's market showed an initial stabilization followed by a tired trend. Initially, foreign quotes improved slightly, and prices for each month were similar to the previous day. However, in the afternoon sessions, the flour market was flat, and Australian wheat was offered at around 4 taels and 2.5 candareens, still available for purchase. Manufacturers, however, were still asking for high prices and were unwilling to continue purchasing. Given this trend, if deals were indeed made later, the psychology of most traders would be severely impacted. As a result, the current month through June each fell by 0.02 compared to the previous day, July was unchanged, and August fell by 0.04.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Markets: Double Palace Cocoon Prices Rise Further</h3>
<p>Last year, the harvest of silkworm cocoons in the Jiangzhe provinces was poor. The domestic sales of Double Palace Silk were strong, and the supply of raw materials could not meet the demand. There were still several months before the new cocoons would be on the market. Domestic inventories of Double Palace Cocoons were limited, and the prices were rising further. Yesterday, Xinlun and others imported 230 dan of Shaoxing Double Palace Cocoons, opening at a price of 74 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Fall, Then Stabilize Slightly</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's sugar market reports from production areas, the price of Cuban spot sugar decreased slightly by 0.0625, while the prices of New York sugar futures and Javanese spot sugar remained unchanged. In the public market, the price of He Tang's 24th grade of raw and white sugar was flat, with bids at 10 taels and 9 candareens, but there was no interest. Although there were some transactions in Japanese sugar, the market gradually decreased. N Mark was 10 taels and 9 candareens, SH Mark was 10 taels and 7 candareens, TK Mark was 10 taels and 8.5 candareens, YT Mark was 10 taels and 8 candareens, YR0 Mark was 10 taels and 5 candareens, YR Mark was 11 taels and 2 candareens, and T Mark was 11 taels and 2 candareens. Transactions were very limited, and the market was flat. Given the sluggish actual sales and the rising foreign exchange rates, there was little reason to be optimistic about the future of the refined sugar market.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Sales Gradually Become Active</h3>
<p>Piece goods sales had been exceptionally quiet at the beginning of the abandoned calendar year. Yesterday, customer sales became slightly more active. Traders from Changsha, Jiangxi, and other provinces had arrived in Shanghai. There were more than 100 deals made yesterday. Moganshan Zhigong tweed, First Class Zhigong satin, and Huxinting biliji were all purchased. Qing's traders brought 40 to 50 pieces of Haichang cloth and Zhigong satin. Traders from Dalian, Tianjin, and other places were also making purchases. This street's demand for patterned goods was relatively strong. Dingfacai's printed feather silk was 2 yuan and 7.5 candareens, Dateli's printed seersucker was 2 yuan and 6.5 candareens, Ronghua Fugui's dark-colored seersucker was 2 yuan and 7 candareens, Shuangtonglu snowflake serge was 3 yuan and 7.5 candareens, and Sangong wool silk cloth was 2 taels and 8.5 candareens. All of these items were traded. Because the common goods market was affected by the falling gold market, there was still no good outlook. After observing the market, there was still hope for a rebound in spot goods after the sales, because the Osaka price was still higher than the spot market. Western goods, with the plain silk pongee being the most popular, sold over 30 pieces yesterday. Fengyu Qiaoyinyuan was 6 yuan and 7.5 candareens, and Haohua was 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware and Tinplate Prices Looser</h3>
<p>▲ 2,000 Boxes of Tinplate Arrive</p>
<p>Because recent tinplate arrivals have been frequent while sales have been weak, the market is very dull, so prices have been silently loosening. Dong iron 7-foot sheets sell for 1 tael and 2 yuan and 6.6 candareens, 6-foot sheets sell for 1 tael and 0.6 candareens, American goods sell for 22 to 19.5 taels, and British goods are priced at 19.5 to 17 taels.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,000 boxes of Pudong's new Taigu brand tinplate arrived. The market momentum was more moderate, but because the inventory of standard thin sheets was still low, they were firm. American goods sold for 18 taels, and British goods sold for 16 taels.</p>

<h3>Correspondence on Diagnosis</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanhe</p>
<p>To Mr. Ying Yongfeng,</p>
<p>The passing of your relative has been some time ago. Regarding this illness, leukorrhea, there are distinctions between white, yellow, red, cyan, black, yang, yin, qi deficiency and blood collapse, accumulated heat and blood collapse, deficient cold and blood collapse, weakened blood collapse, injury and blood collapse, blood stasis and blood collapse, pure deficiency and blood collapse, summer heat and blood collapse, wind strike and blood collapse, dampness strike and blood collapse, qi stagnation and blood collapse, phlegm accumulation and blood collapse, blood sea heat collapse, and sympathetic blood collapse. The causes of the disease include cold, heat, deficiency, excess, the inability of the Chong and Ren channels to control blood, the inability of the liver to store blood, the inability of the spleen to govern blood, heat in the lower burner forcing erratic blood flow, great deficiency of primordial qi, and internal obstruction of blood stasis. However, prolonged collapse becomes leakage, and consolidation and astringency should be combined, which is a definite method. But observe whether there are red hairs on the top of the patient's head; if there is one or more, pluck them out, burn them to ashes, and have the patient take them with wine on an empty stomach, along with taking medicine, which may eliminate the root and prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhang Shilian,</p>
<p>The symptoms of constipation are due to many causes, such as water deficiency and fire excess, insufficient body fluids, and dysfunction of the intestinal tract, which is the biggest cause. Arbitrary use of laxatives will inevitably injure the qi, deplete true yin, and make the dryness and constipation worse. This is why Western methods become more and more secretive. The treatment should cool the hot, warm the cold, replenish the deficient, and moisten the dry. Treat according to the syndrome to be effective. For common treatment, Five Kernel Pills can be used, fifty pills taken with rice water on an empty stomach every morning; long-term use may be effective.</p>

<h3>International Fixed Calendar</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The international "fixed" calendar is a new calendar that has never existed before. Since its invention, it has undergone research and improvement by many experts and is recognized as a new calendar that is most suitable for people's lives. Those who study this new calendar hope that it can be implemented from 1934. The League of Nations is also paying close attention to this matter and is scheduled to convene representatives from various countries in mid-October this year to hold an international conference on the calendar to solve and improve the calendar problem.</p>
<p>The so-called international fixed calendar, its characteristic is in the word "fixed". This new calendar stipulates that there are thirteen months in a year, four weeks in each month, and the four Sundays in each month have fixed dates. June 29th of each year is called Closure Day, and December 29th at the end of the year is called Year-End Day. It is stipulated as an international rest day. These two days are always the day after Saturday, but are not called Sunday. A month has only twenty-eight days, and all twenty-ninth, thirtieth, and thirty-first days are cancelled. The method is to take away thirteen days from June and eighteen days from July in the current calendar, a total of twenty-eight days, so there is another month. Easter Sunday is scheduled for April 15th, so the Lenten holidays of various churches will also have a fixed date and become permanent.</p>
<p>The fixed calendar, as the name suggests, means fixed and unchangeable, so every month is neatly twenty-eight days, seven days a week, the first day Sunday, the second day Monday, the third day Tuesday, the fourth day Wednesday, the fifth day Thursday, the sixth day Friday, the seventh day Saturday, and the eighth day is Sunday again. From then on, the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd will always be Sundays, Monday will always be the 2nd, 9th, 16th, and 23rd, Tuesday will be the 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th, Wednesday will be the 4th, 11th, 18th, and 25th, Thursday will be the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th, Friday will be the 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th, and Saturday will be the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th, so every month is like February of this year | 1931, only June and December of each year add one day to become a leap day, but it is not counted within the seven days of the week.</p>
<p>Looking at the current calendar, a month is either thirty days or thirty-one days, and February has twenty-nine days or twenty-eight days, so a month has either five weeks or six weeks. Like May of this year, the 8th has six weeks, and the 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th of May are Sundays, and the 31st is also Sunday. In August, in addition to the 10th, 9th, 16th, and 23rd being Sundays, the 30th is also Sunday. In addition, January, March, April, June, July, September, October, November, and December have five weeks, and February has only four Sundays. As for the date of Easter, it is even more uneven. For example, 1931 was April 5th, 1932 was changed earlier to March 27th, and in 1933 it was changed later to April 16th. The other holidays are the same.</p>
<p>With the above-mentioned changes, the current solar calendar has three unerasable shortcomings: (1) the number of days in each month cannot be averaged; (2) the dates and weeks (Sundays) in a month often change and cannot be unified; (3) religious holidays such as Easter change every year. There are three ways to remedy these shortcomings: (1) average the number of days in each month; (2) the dates and days of the week in the month are fixed; (3) Easter is scheduled for April 15th. The first method is to move the 31st of August to the end of each year, making February the 29th, so that the half-year period is exceptionally average. The second method is that each quarter has three months, becoming thirty days, thirty days, and thirty-one days, or thirty-one days and thirty days. Its advantages are (1) half a year or a quarter has a sufficient number of months and weeks; (2) the days and cycles in each quarter repeat cyclically; (3) each month has the same number of working days; (4) the first year after the change does not require much sorting for comparison statistics, etc. The third method is the international fixed calendar mentioned here, with thirteen months a year and twenty-eight days a month, becoming four whole weeks. The convenience of this new calendar is described below in separate items:</p>
<p>(1) Each month is average and the same as twenty-eight days and four weeks, circulating back and forth, never losing</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The economic value of the average month; (2) The correspondence between Sunday and the date of the month is permanent and unchanged. All clocks and watches can be used permanently; (3) Paydays, market days, regular markets, and meetings cycle back and forth, with the same date in each month without any mistakes; (4) A month is four weeks, so each week is a quarter of a month, so the dates of weekly pay, rent, and account payments are neat and consistent, without any discrepancies; (5) Save time and economy, and avoid disputes caused by date confusion; (6) Each Sunday and the four fixed days in a month return and forth, determined and unchanged. Therefore, various matters such as weekly or monthly work, production, business, payment, collection, and social interaction are exceptionally neat in terms of date; (7) Bills and drafts will never be due on Sundays; (8) Holidays for the public, families, shops, schools, and institutions all have fixed and unchangeable dates; (9) Income and expenditure can be equal at any time, or several times each, and can be accurately calculated; (10) The end of each month coincides with the last day of the week and remains unchanged, which is of great convenience for business and rent, etc.; (11) Public, commercial, financial, and family life are greatly facilitated by the zero days at the end of the week and quarter; (12) The fifth week's rent and wages in any uneven month can be saved without payment, which can save costs and help progress, and statistics are easy to organize; (13) The number of days between any two dates can be calculated at a glance, which is very convenient for paying wages, interest, and calculations. For example, to find out how many days there are from January 10th to June 20th, just multiply 28 by 5, which equals 140 days, and then add 10 to get the answer of 150 days; (14) Because the distance of each month is average and the Sundays of each month are the same, when doing statistics for government agencies, import and export companies, science, health, municipal administration, and families, not only can accurate ups and downs indices be obtained, but also valuable time for making annotations or revisions can be saved, and senior personnel can obtain accurate business trends at the end of the month to determine the administrative policy for the next month.</p>
<p>The fixed calendar also has considerable convenience for the women's world: (15) A month of twenty-eight days is exactly four weeks, which is very natural, so women often use twenty-eight days to calculate the changes in their body, and humans are produced after two hundred and eighty days, and half of humans are women, if a calendar of twenty-eight days a month is used, they can get great benefits in terms of personal calculation, because there is an accurate date from one to ten months, and they are very convenient in managing housework and accounts every day, every month, and every week, and especially suitable for public, private, and family appointments. They do not need to use monthly expenses or salaries to purchase food and other items for the fifth week, as they do now; (16) It can save the country, businesses, and individuals time and money to find or mention the dates on the calendar to determine the appropriate dates for work, payment, communication, and meetings, etc. Sentences such as "the Tuesday after the first Monday" and "the second and fourth Fridays" commonly used in laws, rules, and regulations can be omitted, and a lot of printing and advertising costs can be saved. Even in the United States alone, this cost can save about $30,000,000 per year; (17) If a fixed calendar of thirteen months a year and twenty-eight days a month is used, then the current economic value of labor, salary, rent, subsidies, etc., which circulates twelve times a year, can circulate thirteen times a year, so for every thirty-one yuan of circulating capital, only twenty-eight yuan is enough to replace it, because it circulates thirteen times a year, and the number of twenty-eight yuan can do the work of the current thirty-one yuan. The payment for the fifth week of the month can be completely cancelled. According to estimates, if a fixed calendar of one month and twenty-eight days is adopted, the economic value used in commerce in Europe during the initial three-month period of implementation can be reduced by at least 2,000,000,000 yuan. If all countries are included, the number will reach 5,000,000,000 yuan, equivalent to 1,000,000,000 pounds sterling; (18) The average bad debts and outstanding debts per month can be permanently reduced by 10%, with a ratio of 31 yuan to 28 yuan; (19) It can save the cost of printing and distributing the annual calendar; (20) Birthdays and anniversaries have fixed dates; (21) Easter has a fixed date, and Christmas and New Year holidays are linked to weekend holidays; (22) It can help select the dates for "Daylight Saving Time"; (23) It can help farmers cultivate fields; (24) It can help scientific and health research work.</p>
<p>The fixed calendar of twenty-eight days a month mentioned above has a total of twenty-four advantages, among which (1), (4), (9), and (14) are particularly important. However, the end-of-year day, that is, the day after December 28th, must be added, otherwise the above-mentioned many advantages cannot be obtained. Regarding this point, it seems that there is an eighth day in addition to the seven days of a week, and Jews and Seventh-day Adventists may object, but 99% of the people in the world are willing to obtain the various benefits mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Marshal Foch's European War Diary (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Our conversation in Saint-Pol was naturally about the situation of the Allied forces and the defensive line we had established on the Aisne River. Now we want to extend that defensive line to the coast. I told him that I had decided to have the soldiers dig trenches to resist the enemy's superior military equipment, and then take the offensive again when we also had the same reliable equipment, because this is the only way to win. Later, Mr. Lloyd George repeatedly asked me to remember this conversation, which he named "the Saint-Pol Plan." He watched that plan succeed.</p>
<p>The most important battle in the European War occurred under these circumstances. The Allied forces still wanted to strike first, and wanted to use the freedom of action given to them by the victory of the Marne to preempt the enemy's offensive, and wanted to take advantage of the enemy's victory in Antwerp before they could transfer troops to join the strong reserve forces arriving from Germany to launch a strategic offensive in this only theater of war to resolve the war on the Western Front.</p>
<p>The question I had to ask myself was whether we had enough time to gather the scattered and complex three Allied forces into a sufficient number to properly organize and cooperate to contain the enemy's plan and achieve the victory we deserved. If we could not have this expectation, we should at least prevent the enemy from succeeding. The great battle of Flanders soon answered this question.</p>
<p>This battle included two phases:</p>
<p>(1) The offensive along the coast, or the Battle of the Yser (October 17th to November 1st);</p>
<p>(2) The Battle of Ypres, Ypres is the transportation center of the Flanders region (October 21st to November 12th);</p>
<p>The Battle of the Yser</p>
<p>The area around Dunkirk was completely devoid of high ground, trees, or anything to rely on, and there were no railways or rivers to guard. However, if we were to prevent excessive retreat and avoid endless disasters in the future, a decision should be made without delay. I mean to pay attention to the railway line between Nieuport and Diksmuide. This railway at least provides a connecting line. Soldiers retreating there must cross it and can be told to stop. So this is a convenient base for reorganizing the ranks.</p>
<p>A railway often passes through ditches or fortifications, and even sunken wood and gravel on the plain can be used as a barrier to avoid artillery fire. So I adopted this route as a small protection for the soldiers lined up behind it. Moreover, the two ends of the railway are firmly attached to Nieuport and Diksmuide, so it can become a very valuable defensive line.</p>
<p>This was my belief, but I exchanged opinions with the Belgian General Staff (which I did not fully understand) and, based on the results, decided to have the Belgian army retreat to the end of the route and deploy defenses behind the route. A brigade of the 42nd Division in the north guarded Nieuport, another brigade in the center defended to Pervijze, and Diksmuide was defended by the Marine Corps. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>The Power of the Great Powers in China</h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Authored by Li Changfu</p>
<p>Superficially, our nation’s international status appears to be that of a fully independent nation. In reality, the opposite is true. We have been dominated by the imperialist powers for a long time. Anyone with a little historical knowledge understands this. According to political theory, a country that can organize its own government and rule the land and people under its jurisdiction is called an independent nation. A country that can organize a government, but where all major policies are controlled by foreigners, is called a protectorate. A country that cannot organize a government and is ruled entirely by another country is called a colony. Protectorates and colonies have incomplete sovereignty and are collectively referred to as colonies. Although our country has a self-organized government, its sovereignty cannot be fully exercised throughout the country. Therefore, although it is superficially called an independent nation, it is undoubtedly a semi-independent nation. The imperialists oppress our country and infringe upon our sovereignty. Although it cannot be said that it is a colony, it can be regarded as a semi-colony. However, according to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, it is not appropriate to call our country a semi-colony. It should be called a sub-colony. A colony is under the oppression of one imperialist power. Like our country, it is under the iron heel of international imperialism, and its status is even lower than that of a colony. This is the most accurate statement. Regarding this, Mr. Sun Yat-sen explained it very clearly in a lecture on nationalism. The main points are excerpted below:</p>
<p>For example, Annam is a French colony, and Korea is a Japanese colony. Annam and Korea are only slaves of one country, with only one master, with obligations, and also with rights. In our country, all treaty countries are our masters. Our country only has obligations to its masters and no rights. If Annam and Korea suffer famine, France and Japan will definitely provide relief, fulfilling their responsibilities as masters. If there is a drought in northern China, even occasional donations from foreigners are regarded as a great favor. Therefore, our country's international status is even lower than that of a colony, and it is called a sub-colony.</p>
<p>Of course, to understand the true nature of our country becoming a sub-colony, we must study the power of international imperialism in our country. The most significant aspect is that the great powers use force or threatening diplomatic means to force our country to conclude unequal treaties, expanding their power in our country. The power of Britain, the United States, Japan, and France is the greatest, followed by Italy, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Other countries all have special rights to enjoy in our country. This is how hateful and painful it is. As citizens, we should pay attention to or conduct thorough research on the expansion of the powers in our country.</p>
<p>Statistically, our treaty countries number twenty, such as China, Japan, Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Persia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Peru, Brazil, and Portugal, Mexico, etc. Among them, the power of Japan, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain is the greatest (especially Britain, the United States, Japan, and France). Russia, Germany, and Austria had great power before the European War, but greatly declined after the war. Denmark, Portugal, and Sweden have the next level of power. As for Brazil, Peru, and Mexico, their power is even weaker. The power of various countries in our country is mostly obtained by exploiting unequal treaties. When one country obtains special rights in our country, other countries expand their power by invoking "equal opportunity" or "most-favored-nation treatment." Even countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Mexico, which have very little relationship with our country, have the right to have tariff agreements, consular jurisdiction, and dispatch warships to expand their power in our country. These are all very obvious facts.</p>
<p>According to Charles Hodges, an American, the power of the great powers in our country can be divided into territorial, administrative, economic, and military power. In addition to these four, the author of this book believes that a cultural aspect can be added. This is definitely true. In the introduction of the first chapter, the author lists this in a table, making it easy for us to understand at a glance. This is something that deserves our attention. The table is briefly listed below to assist researchers:</p>
<p>1.  Territorial power: A. Ceded territory: (1) Ceded lands (e.g., Hong Kong, Taiwan); (2) Leased territories (e.g., Lushun, Weihaiwei); B. Other territory: (1) Spheres of influence; (2) Foreign railway zones; (3) Foreign settlements (i.e., concessions).</p>
<p>2.  Administrative power: A. Transportation enterprises established by foreigners: (1) Railways (e.g., South Manchuria Railway); (2) Post offices (Japanese post offices in Manchuria not yet abolished); (3) Telegraph offices and radio stations; B. Consular jurisdiction; C. Foreign employees: (1) Foreign customs officials; (2) Foreign postal officials; (3) Foreign salt administration officials; (4) Foreign railway officials; (5) Foreign government advisors; (6) Foreign military advisors in various armies.</p>
<p>3.  Economic power: A. Concessioned industries and commerce: (1) Private enterprises; (2) Public enterprises; B. Loans: (1) Political loans; (2) Industrial loans; C. Foreign banks.</p>
<p>4.  Military power: A. Foreign military bases; B. Foreign guards and military police; C. Foreign warships in territorial waters and inland rivers.</p>
<p>5.  Cultural power: A. Spread of Christianity; B. Schools established by foreigners; Newspapers and news agencies established by foreigners.</p>
<p>Although this table is very brief, it completely includes the power and special rights that the great powers occupy in our country. From this, it can also be understood that our country's international status is undoubtedly that of a sub-colony.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, "The History of the Expansion of the Powers in China," is of course very important in this book. The author uses a very concise style to describe the expansion of the powers in China, but after reading it, we can at least gain a deep understanding. Most people can understand that since the Opium War and the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanjing with Britain, foreigners have used unequal treaties to develop their power in China. Subsequently, after each war, another treaty was concluded, and international imperialism was carried out step by step. Over the past eighty years, the current situation has been created. In order to help readers understand further, the author divides the process of power expansion into five periods for description: 1. From the Opium War to the Sino-Japanese War; 2. From the Sino-Japanese War to the Boxer Rebellion; 3. From the Boxer Rebellion to the beginning of the European War; 4. From the beginning of the European War to the Washington Conference; 5. From the Washington Conference to the present. Generally speaking, the first period was the era when the powers initially occupied power; the second period was the era when the powers wantonly invaded China and attempted to divide China; the third period was the era when the powers abandoned the policy of dividing China and greatly expanded their economic power; the fourth period was the era when Japan alone expanded its power in China; the fifth period was the era when the powers abandoned individual aggression and adopted a coordinated approach, seemingly intending to jointly manage China. It is also the initial stage of the shaking of the powers. At this time, the Chinese people should be aware of this and act as a backup for the government's diplomacy, in order to eliminate the expansion of the powers in our country permanently. This meaningful movement will certainly benefit the future of our nation.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, "The Territorial Power of the Powers in China," divides their territorial power in China into ceded lands, leased territories, occupied territories, spheres of influence, and concessions. Regarding this, the author describes each item separately and provides detailed tables. When we look at them, anyone with a sense of national love will feel pain and indignation. Because the territory of our country occupied by Britain, Russia, Japan, and France amounts to no less than 500,000 square miles, which is one-third of the total area of ​​the country. How heartbreaking it is to read this.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, "The Administrative Power of the Powers in China," primarily concerns consular jurisdiction and customs administration rights, followed by railways, post offices, telegraph offices, and radio stations established by foreigners, which greatly hinder our country's sovereignty. Foreign employees hired by various agencies in our country also occupy considerable power. In this chapter, the author also uses a historical approach to describe in detail, so that our readers can obtain a systematic understanding. This is also the unique feature of this book.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, "The Economic Power of the Powers in China," states that the greatest power of the powers in China is actually economic power. Foreigners use administrative power to carry out their economic aggression, and its influence even tends to envelop the entire China. This is very alarming. However, in describing the economic aspect, it is easy to tend towards inaccurate theories. But the author here does not make any judgment, but objectively makes a historical description. Therefore, at the end of this chapter, he says, "The economic power of the powers in our country is driven by their political advantages. If the administrative power of foreign countries is not eliminated, our country's industry will not be able to prosper, and there is no hope for the elimination of foreign power. Therefore, to save China, the special rights of the powers in China must be abolished first." This certainly contains a full and correct truth.</p>
<p>Chapter Six, "The Military Power of the Powers in China," says that there are two types of foreign troops in China: one based on treaties and one not based on treaties. The former includes the troops of Britain, France, the United States, and Italy stationed along the Beijing-Fengtian Railway from Beijing to Haikou, all of which are based on the Boxer Protocol. The latter includes the troops of Japan and Russia stationed in Manchuria, the troops of Japan stationed in Qingdao and Hankou, and the troops of Britain stationed in Shanghai. According to recent surveys, there are about 20,000 foreign troops stationed in Shanghai and Beijing, and about 20,000 Japanese troops in southern Manchuria, totaling more than 40,000 foreign troops in the country. This is a very alarming number. There is no reason for foreign troops to be stationed in the territory of an independent country. The powers use the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to station troops in our country, but in fact, they have already infringed upon our country's sovereignty. In this chapter, the author's description has the power to awaken our people's awareness.</p>
<p>Chapter Seven, "The Cultural Power of the Powers in China," can be divided into three categories: churches, schools, and news media. The power of this anesthetic is indeed greater than military and other aggressions, and we should pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>Chapter Eight is the conclusion, which summarizes the above and allows us to further understand the power of the powers in China. The most important thing, of course, is to abolish unequal treaties and eliminate their political privileges, and their economic power will naturally retreat. The author says, "Better to be a free citizen in pain than a slave in comfort in a ruined country." If we want to understand this fundamental meaning, then we must read this book. This book is based on popular simplicity and easy to understand, and it is sufficient for general reading.</p>
<h3>British Imperialism and China</h3>
<p>— Mo Zhi</p>
<p>Authored by Tang Wenqian</p>
<p>Anyone with a little geographical knowledge can understand that our country is located east of the East Sea, and England is located west of the West Sea. Of course, East Asia and Western Europe were originally "as different as a horse and an ox," but now they have become an incompatible force in the international arena. The facts that have occurred in between can be cited as reasons for us to cry bitterly. It is really "difficult to count on one's fingers." Our national revolution has long been successful, and now we are moving towards the great road of active construction. This is undoubtedly an excellent phenomenon. However, we must know that if we expect the strength of the country to become increasingly stronger, it undoubtedly depends on the government's efforts to develop various construction undertakings, to adopt a strong foreign policy that is beneficial to the country, and for the people to cooperate with the government and act as a strong backup for the government. In that case, the "unequal treaties," which are a major obstacle to our people's determination to become stronger, can be abolished. Because if these unequal treaties are not abolished for a day, our country's national strength will never be able to become stronger. Therefore, Premier Sun Yat-sen once said, "Unequal treaties are the Chinese people's indenture," and also said, "To ask whether foreign countries can abolish unequal treaties, we must first ask whether we have the determination to fight for it." When Premier Sun Yat-sen was dying, he still repeatedly used this as his last will, how sincere and earnest his heart was in hoping that our people would encourage our people to fight for the country. This is something everyone knows. British imperialists are the initiators of unequal treaties. This is a very deep image imprinted in the minds of the Chinese people. It is engraved in our hearts and can never be forgotten. The statement of their crimes cannot be completed in just a few words. To cite the biggest, it is from the Opium War,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>to cannon fire at Nanjing. Such a great shame and the most painful and unfortunate historical fact must arouse infinite grief and anger in any person with ambition. At the same time, if we want to study the fundamental reasons why China's national strength cannot be strong, and the causes and consequences of unequal conditions, then this book "British Imperialism and China" is worthy of our attention. At the very least, it can serve as an aid to our research on this issue.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into thirteen chapters. Chapter One, "China and Britain in the Era Without Treaties," (1) "The Initial Trade Between China and Britain," (2) "The Three Missions Sent to China by the British Government," (3) "The British Warship Attacks Macao." The author first states that after Europeans discovered new sea routes at the end of the fifteenth century, the Portuguese and Spanish gradually came to China to trade. By the fourteenth year of the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty, the Portuguese obtained Macao as a place of residence, and the Spanish also occupied Taiwan to open markets for trade. England, which now holds the European hegemony of imperialism, was already becoming increasingly strong at this time. Therefore, it first had the intention of getting involved, and then gave birth to the heart of invading our China. Here, the author describes in chronological order based on the history of Sino-British trade, which especially allows us to understand that their ambition to invade is increasing day by day. Second, it describes the three missions sent to China by the British government. At that time, they still did not understand our country's national conditions, so they did not dare to use the threat of their warships, but hoped that China would give them equal treatment and slightly preserve the dignity of their country and the interests of their merchants. The first negotiation by the British government, from this time on, the fifth of the seven requirements they put forward was the most important, which was to obtain a piece of land in China as a base for trade, to establish a pier, and to reduce tariffs and other miscellaneous fees. Because this failed to satisfy their wishes, the attack on Macao by warships occurred. This is described in the most detail in this book, and we can also find out the true face of British imperialism from it.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, "The Opium War," (1) "The Cause of the War," This is of course very important. Opium has been entering China for more than 1,200 years, and the impact on our people is profound and significant. Here, the author lists detailed tables of opium import volume and silver export volume to make a comparative study. Reading it really arouses infinite sadness and hatred, which is the only good opportunity to awaken us. (2) "The State of the War," This is when Lin Zexu arrived in Guangdong, Yi Lyu sent a messenger to his country to report on the situation of China's opium ban, requesting the dispatch of warships to assist. After the British government received the report, there were those who advocated war and those who opposed war. In the end, cannon fire was exchanged. When our country failed, a peace agreement was reached, and unequal treaties were concluded as a result. (3) "The Treaty of Nanjing," These are all ropes that bind China and are the main reason why China is trapped and declining. But at that time, the British government's pretense of virtue and its ambitious aggression against our country is enough for us to hate.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, "The Anglo-French Allied Forces' Campaign," (1) "The Reasons for the Conflict," After the Opium War, our country's national strength declined day by day, and it was also afflicted by the change of Hong Xiuquan, the deployment of troops to raise funds, and the chaos of government orders. The British seized the opportunity to expand their trade, using treacherous merchants and giving them passports or national flags, allowing them to freely enter and exit various seaports. The treacherous merchants took advantage of the power of the British to sell opium and anesthetize our people. Later, Ba Xia Li led warships and bombarded the Huangpu Fort, and then captured Guangzhou. At that time, the Austrian people were indignant at the British tyranny. After the British army left, they competed to fight hard, destroying all the British, American, and French military buildings and foreign houses in revenge. As a result, it was not only a problem with Britain, but also promoted the Anglo-French Allied Forces' Campaign. (2) "The State of the War," The British government appointed Elgin as the plenipotentiary ambassador, and the French government appointed Luo as the plenipotentiary ambassador, leading fleets to China. Elgin first arrived in Hong Kong and wrote to Ye Mingchen (Governor of Guangdong), requesting an appointment to discuss compensation for losses and the establishment of a new treaty, otherwise they would meet with cannon fire. The French and American consuls also wrote letters requesting compensation and were willing to mediate. The result was peace talks in Tianjin. The British envoy put forward 56 articles of the proposed new treaty, and the French envoy also put forward 42 articles, forcing them to sign. The Qing court, because it had no confidence in either war or defense, signed and acknowledged without negotiation, which was the Treaty of Tianjin. It was even more severe than the Treaty of Nanjing. Regarding this treaty, the important points are excerpted by the author in the book, so that readers can understand the truth. (3) "The Disturbance Re-created," This is one wave not yet subsided, and another wave rises again. At this time, the Sino-British Beijing Treaty was also completed. The disaster of the Anglo-French Allied Forces' Campaign ended at this time, and the disasters left behind by the treaty have not yet ended. (4) "The Losses on the Treaty," This is of course shocking to us. Since the Opium War, the Treaty of Nanjing, the alliance of the city, was concluded, and our country gradually fell into the net of unequal treaties. This time, the Treaty of Tianjin was even more severe. The most important four points were: (1) the grant of consular jurisdiction; (2) the beginning of tariff rate negotiation; (3) the opening of inland rivers; (4) the beginning of the most-favored-nation treaty. This not only caused us to lose the spirit of an independent country, but also made it enough to control our country's death. The author's description here is even more detailed, and it is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, "The Margary Incident and the Loss of Burma," (1) "The Murder of Margary and the Yantai Treaty," (2) "The Process of Britain's Extinction of Burma," (3) "The Negotiations After the Extinction of Burma." After the conclusion of the Sino-British Treaty of Tianjin, British commerce gained another layer of protection, and the volume of trade increased year by year. Therefore, the British wanted to open up a land trade route, from India to the interior of China, and their ambitions can be seen. After Margary (the secretary of the British envoy) was killed, there was the Yantai Conference, and four points were agreed, commonly known as the Yantai Treaty, also known as the Zhifu Treaty. Needless to say, it was being invaded, making China even more depressed. Burma bordered India and was also a vassal state of our country. Britain, with its aggressive ambition, had been coveting it for a long time. When China and France had a conflict, and neither had time to take care of it, Britain used a military strategy as fast as lightning, and in less than two weeks, it swallowed it all. When our country lost this vassal state, it could only swallow its anger and say nothing. But although our country cannot argue with force, there must be negotiations on the division of boundaries and all other matters. As a result, the seeds of the Pianma negotiations also occurred at this time. In our country, not only was the barrier removed, leaving endless worries on the frontier, but also the internal rights were lost. It can be said that we are shedding tears for it. This chapter is also nothing less than a page of painful history.</p>

Tibet is the southwestern screen of our country, with an area of ​​about 2.5 million square miles, bordering Sichuan and Qinghai in the east, Xinjiang in the north, and British India in the northwest. Since the British annexed India, its power has spread to the south of the Himalayas, and it has long coveted our country's Tibet. Later, the British Governor in India repeatedly sent secret envoys to Tibet for exploration, but none of them could penetrate the interior. Later, when the Yantai Treaty was signed, the British took the opportunity to add another special clause, that is, the Chinese government recognized the traffic between Britain and Tibet. Of course, it had to progress step by step. Tibet, an important border region of China, became a continuation of India. Regarding this chapter, the author has fully described it, so that all our citizens can understand the importance of Tibet's border defense. This is really a feature of this book.

<p>After reading this book, we can deeply understand the true face of British imperialism, and how it has used various means and methods of aggression against China. Of course, it is enough to arouse our sadness and anger. The signing of the unequal Treaty of Nanjing set a precedent, and then the unequal treaties of various countries came one after another, with the intention of leading our country to destruction. But today, the anti-imperialist voice in our country is still rising, and the call to abolish unequal treaties is also very loud. This is really a sign that our country is turning from weak to strong. But these unequal treaties were first initiated by Britain. Our country was oppressed by imperialism after the Opium War, causing our country to be trapped in the net of unequal treaties of various countries. Therefore, if we want to eliminate all unequal treaties, we must properly deal with the special rights of British imperialism in China. For the present, all our people must unite as one and act as a backup for the government. All outstanding issues between China and Britain, the issues of Tibet and Pianma, should be thoroughly resolved. Regarding this, this book is described in great detail, and the author uses the position of the Three Principles of the People to dissect the relationship between British imperialism and China and its truth. This is even more worthy of our readers' recommendation.</p>
