<p>對鐵道問題主張强硬化</p>
<p>我國同胞應亟起注意之</p>
<p>瀋陽通信日本地狹民衆久思侵略中國以逹其殖民慾望現在我國對各國正進行修正不平等條約日本極意反對現已</p>
<p>聯合官憲民衆成立對外同志會并發出宣言用以反對我國廢約而其對於滿蒙鐵路問題主張尤屬强硬化該對外同志會列名發起人有日本朝野名士如公爵一條實孝·男爵并上清純·大并成元等三十二人贊助人爲男爵金子有道等一百十五人瀋垣近已接得該會自東京發出之宣言原文譯錄於下吾全國民衆愼勿以其虚張聲勢而忽視之也</p>
<p>滿蒙鐵路問題現在中國以（一）蔑視已往成例澈底從低减運費競爭與（二）包圍滿鐵計劃之兩個手段以壓迫滿鐵其意在减縮滿鐵經濟之價值冷殺我國民保持滿鐵之熱誠爲便於後日奪還之計至爲明暸在此時若不下一决心打破中國側之学夢彼必用一列壓迫手段并漸謀附屬地行政權守備后駐屯權之收回或更以政治方面之難題節向我逼進亦不難預想而知也蓋爭端滋長宜於未萌時剷除之乃爲正道爲擁護帝國之正當地位計於此應採一定態度以</p>

<p>法權問題依中國現在情形一舉而撤廢法權爲事實上所不能固無論矣雖英美亦採漸進撤廢主張若就利害共同關係上與帝國取協調步驟彼此共同拒絕此項不合理的要求總期勿爲讓步與迎合之醜態斯可矣再附屬地行政權本不屬於通商範圍乃基於明治三十八年我國接收清俄條約而來者現屆修約之時對於該約無修改可能性可以曉然矣</p>

<p>— 夢麟</p>
<p>最近紐約中部舉行了一次理髮比賽結果考脱蘭特村的暴兒逹塞把滑鐵路村的曼愁打敗了但是曼愁並不服氣因爲他已是六十六歲的老理髮師了所以最近又寫了一封信給三十九歲的暴兒逹塞勒要求和他作第二度比賽</p>
<p>條件是此次比賽定額三十頭十頭用電力修剪具比賽十頭用普通手用修剪具末十頭祗限用剪刀再在比賽時理髮椅六尺之内不許站人以免妨礙行動評判員須與比賽者雙方直接或間接無關係者始可</p>
<p>據曼愁自已説他上次的所以失敗完全因爲在剪第一頭時電力修剪具的不順手至於手用修剪具他用了已有四十八年當然是熟練不過的</p>
<p>大部份用剪刀修剪偶然換用手用修剪具結果曼曼愁剃十九頭費一小時五十一分另五秒給暴兒達塞的二十三頭僅杯了</p>
<p>講到紀錄曼愁對於男頭最快是二分鐘三十五秒暴兒達塞則是二分鐘五十秒至於女頭那他祗須三分鐘暴兒達塞最快要四分鐘十三秒無怪他老人家要不服氣了</p>

<p>嘗過吳門一尼庵見髫齡幼尼亦參法座鐘磬聲中頗生異感度必有難言之隱遂处投於寂滅之門也嗣老尼告余謂是實虞山大家女以一念之差爲狂且所誘歷盡艱辛終致墮落遂見逐於家庭見棄於鄉里來此間削髮以自懺耳老尼言時此幼尼亦微聞之及余回顧則淚盈於眶似激其悲怨之思潮余心良不忍急悵然行嗣後毎過是庵彷彿猶有一未完之悲劇斷續映現於腦海中戚然莫能自已</p>
<p>其後余來海一頗嗜電影曾不喜克拉拉鮑輩之以放蕩爲號召而獨傷梨琳甘煦之哀惋自頼婚）一片以至（復仇）無不深受其感動蓋梨琳所飾劇中人往</p>
<p>往爲薄命之女郎其起源則慘毒之（愛）其結果則凄清之（淚）因思吳下幼尼事苟爲編一劇本而令梨琳一演之者必將使天下多情人同聲一哭矣</p>
<p>在國産影片中其有力量之悲劇則殊不多覯惟最近見天一影片公司（空門紅淚）一片則深訝其感人之深蓋以情節之變幻與夫背景之離奇彷彿使人置身於北冰洋之雪海中雖心驚目怵而不能不有凄寂之嘆其主角陳玉梅表演尤卓絕珠淚點點宛轉欲絕我欲以東方之梨琳許之矣而片中所演則其結果固彷彿若余吳下尼庵中所見於是益感其情景之眞切而彌覺其感人之力量爲更深古人千金賣笑竊嗤其愚茫茫塵海惟眞摯之淚滴爲可貴耳</p>

<p>長江航業現在可謂衰落已極進出口貨缺乏華輪又休航昨日記者遇航界某要員承告以衰落眞相爰爲錄誌如次</p>
<p>江西貨阻斷　江西自共黨滋擾以來全省八十一縣中僅有二餘縣不受匪禍沿南潯路之貨物運輸近爲大軍剿匪致内江各地小輪與駁船等均供差用致贛中積貨無船轉運遂使最大出口之夏布瓷器紙頭雜糧等亦不能運出社會購買力弱上海去貨益少九江一埠向爲長江貨運之第一港今則來去船均無貨載矣</p>
<p>大庚鎢停頓　贛省大庚嶺鎢礦名聞全球英德各國毎年採辦此項礦砂出口之額恒有二三十萬噸毎噸值三四百元爲贛省極大利源自去年被匪停工後迄未恢復茲大庚已經國軍收復但礦工尙未集採以致今歲鎢砂竟無一袋裝出</p>
<p>湘鄂貨大缺　平漢路通行以來沿綫積貨以缺車與阻碍除許昌裝一部烟葉來滬其他大宗貨物均未能運來而陜甘貨則又改隴海路裝海州船矣湘省方面湘西航路至今仍完全不通致來貨全無上游航業可稱無望僅下游皖茶略有運滬</p>

<p>— 富蘭</p>
<p>著名世界的倫敦圖書館在上月初旬正是牠誕生九十年的紀念當一八四一年的當兒牠不過占據二間房子僅僅置備三千冊圖書九十年之後這個圖書館聳立瘀聖惹米斯方塲氣象萬千坐擁着四十五萬卷以上的圖書撫今思昔眞是値得紀念</p>
<p>拉德博士C.　T.　Hagbery　Wright自從一八九三年直到現在始終擔任該館館長經騐與資格之老在圖書館學者中首屈一指他最近對倫敦毎晨郵報發表談話舉出倫敦圖書館的二條金科玉律就是（一）决不買一本新小説和（二）决不售脱一本書</p>
<p>（我們不想去滿足讀者對於新小説的曇花般的需要他説（我們不願和那些商業性的貸借圖書館搶生意所以我們制定一條規則在一部小説出版未滿六月之久决不去買牠往後置備一本書也决不買同樣的三本以上</p>
<p>（如果閲覽者當一本書出版的日子就來要求閲覽而我們要想去滿足他們各位的需要時那末圖書館恐怕就要立脚不住例如幾年以前差不多有二千位以上的會員同時要求一部勞帛脱爵士的傳記如此我們非購置二千部不可豈有要遭大大的損失呢</p>
<p>（不論小説家的名望是那様大我們必須經過出版後六個月之久才去買他的書即使泰克來Thackeray及哈代T.　Hardy也不能逃此例外</p>
<p>（我又制定一個規則）他又説（决不售去或損毁一本書在某種情形之下當某種書籍的需要看上去是已斷絕就把這些書籍的副本放在（冷宮）讓牠們居留七年之久在這個期内如果依舊沒有需要然後送給西西里島的圖書館）</p>
<p>在過去九十年之間倫敦圖書館的特質始終如一沒有變動但閲覽的人却已起變化當一八四一年會員中婦女只占百分之三目下却占較大的比率了</p>
<p>在倫敦圖書館成立的第一年喀來爾Carlyle和麥臯來Macanley都全神灌注在圖書館裏喀來有一種不好的脾氣借了書往往不肯交還此外像格雷司頓Gladstone就在圖書館裏預備他的宗敎史的首步工作泰克來檢查圖書經二年之久都是有價値的記錄</p>
<p>倫敦圖書館成立至今所經過的最危險時期要推克里米戰役了那時在一短時期中會員數減至可驚的數目因此購買新書也暫時停止</p>
<p>目下牠有會員四千人以上牠再也不愁立脚不住現在正計劃新建築物的進行好使貯藏自一九三一年到二○八一年源源不絕的新書</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Problem of the Customs Tariff Standard <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Mei Lehe Explains the Difficulties of Changing "Liang" to "Yuan"</p>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the standard for levying import and export duties, Robert Maze, Inspector General of Customs, presented a report to the Ministry of Finance, outlining the difficulties of changing from "liang" to "yuan." The reasons are as follows: (1) The composition of silver dollars varies in different regions, making it difficult to levy taxes according to a standard rate. If taxes are levied by converting them according to the customary value of local silver dollars, the losses would be significant. (2) Levying taxes according to the Haikwan tael ensures fairness for both the taxpayer and the tax collector, and yuan also needs to be converted into silver for calculation, so it does not conflict with the unified yuan unit. He also stated that the system of changing from "liang" to "yuan" cannot be implemented until the composition of silver dollars is unified throughout the country. The Ministry of Finance has submitted the report to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: Regarding the recent interpretation of the National Assembly concerning whether the phrase "National Assembly" in Premier Sun Yat-sen's will should still be read, various levels of Party departments and mass organizations have requested the Central Government to provide an explanation.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>It is heard that the Central Government has decided that this sentence should still be read as is because Premier Sun Yat-sen's will is a permanent historical memorial of the revolution and cannot be altered. Although the National Assembly has been held in accordance with the will, it is necessary to reflect on the past and remember the future to maintain vigilance. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping: Ji Yiqiao stated that the production and sales tax is unique to Tianjin and Hebei, with two main issues: (1) Repeated taxation on one item; (2) Valuation inevitably exceeds the scope. This tax is related to the military and administrative expenses of North China, making it difficult to completely abolish. A compromise solution would be to reduce the higher tax rates and abolish the taxes that are repeatedly levied. This matter is not within his area of responsibility, but he had to assist due to requests from merchants. The Deputy Commander's illness is typhoid fever, and he saw him once the day before yesterday. He is sure he can recover in two weeks. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Proposal of the Conference for Suppressing Poisonous Drugs <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Today, the International Conference for Suppressing Poisonous Drugs in Geneva rejected the proposal to suppress the cultivation of opium poppies submitted by the Russian representative by a vote of four to two. This is because the will of the majority of the representatives is only to suppress the chemical products of poisonous drugs, not the raw materials of poisonous drugs, which is incomprehensible to the world. The raw materials of poisonous drugs that are cultivated have no other use except for manufacturing poisonous drugs, so the purpose is only to manufacture poisonous drugs. Now that the chemical products that are made are to be suppressed, the cultivation of raw materials should naturally be suppressed accordingly, but why do the majority oppose it? Among poisonous substances, only opium does not need to be chemically manufactured. Now that it is clearly admitted that the cultivation of raw materials will not be suppressed, it is clearly admitted that opium will not be suppressed. Although the harm of opium is slightly less than other chemically manufactured heroin, etc., it is equally capable of weakening the race, ruining careers, and leaving behind disasters. Is it that this kind of scourge is not worth worrying about? Although the Chinese representative has argued, the issue is still set aside. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Conference for Suppressing Poisonous Drugs, the reporter said that various countries may not have the sincerity to suppress them. If they really have the sincerity to suppress them, then the manufacture, transportation, and export of poisonous drugs in recent years have increased many times more than before, and they should have taken action to suppress them in their own countries first. Now they do not seek to suppress them themselves but must discuss them at an international conference, which is tantamount to expressing that they want to suppress them together, not individually. It is known that they have no determination to suppress them. Therefore, I say that it is hopeless to wait for the suppression of opium cultivation. The so-called suppression of chemical products of poisonous drugs must also be equal to empty words.</p>

<p>Revision of the Young Plan</p>
<p>Britain Considers the Timing Immature</p>
<p>Hesitation Regarding Three-Year Payment</p>
<p>Further Probing of American Intentions Required</p>
<p>The Conference Will Continue in Berlin</p>
<p>American Secretary of State Prepares to Visit Germany</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - According to reliable sources from the Mainichi Shimbun, the Anglo-German authorities' meeting resulted in the following four gains: (1) Regarding the issues of reparations and war debts, it is considered too early to convene a new international conference and a committee of experts. (2) A complete revision of the Young Plan is currently unnecessary. (3) Germany's request to implement a conditional payment of 50 million pounds annually over three years is being considered as a suitable method to alleviate the suffering of the German people and the economic difficulties. (4) If the United States does not reduce war debts for Britain, Britain cannot abandon German reparations. In other words, Germany's request to change the Young Plan is generally considered premature by Britain, but they are willing to consider delaying payments. The attitude of the United States towards this payment delay is a matter of great interest.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius paid homage to the British monarch this morning, then attended a luncheon at the Anglo-German Association. In the afternoon, they attended a reception hosted by the Institute of International Affairs. The German Chancellor, in his speech, mentioned the friendly talks at the Prime Minister's villa, stating that it has now been agreed to seek cooperation between all relevant countries to improve the current economic situation. He is confident that this spirit of understanding will receive the assistance of the world. Tonight, the German Embassy will host a banquet for the German Chancellor and others, with British Prime Minister MacDonald as the main guest.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 8th - The most important matter in political circles currently is the Anglo-German talks of Curtius, but the lack of accurate information has led to much speculation on the matter. What is known is that this meeting does not offer the hope of immediate results. Furthermore, it is widely believed that after these talks, Germany will continue to demand the suspension of certain reparations payments in the Young Plan, which will inevitably lead to a reconvening of the reparations conference. According to news from London, the Curtius talks may continue in Berlin, as British Foreign Secretary Henderson has accepted Brüning's invitation to visit Germany this summer. The German Chancellor and Foreign Minister plan to hold similar talks with certain other countries. As for the views of the newspapers, apart from a few communist and nationalist newspapers that specifically ridicule the government, the rest express satisfaction. The official announcements issued so far have not shown any significant effect, but it cannot be concluded that their effect is negligible. This is because when the matters discussed between Britain and Germany are announced, consideration should be given to the feelings and intentions of France and the United States, so the wording is naturally very cautious. Furthermore, the newspapers attach great importance to the visit of US Secretary of State Stimson, believing that British foreign newspapers say that Stimson's visit is very closely related to the future of reparations, because the United States must not want to see the complete failure of the reparations plan, so it must be maintained permanently by reducing the amount.</p>
<p>Soviet News Agency, Washington, 8th - US government officials are still unwilling to comment on the meeting of the Anglo-German authorities. However, various newspapers have published detailed London dispatches on the results of the meeting, with several newspapers indicating in their headlines that they now believe the Young Plan will be revised. National News Agency, Berlin, 9th - German news sources have confirmed that British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson have accepted Germany's invitation to visit Germany, and the date will be decided soon. In addition, the British newspaper Mainichi Shimbun's foreign correspondent reported that the British authorities' willingness to defer reparations payments depends on whether the United States is willing to defer war debt payments or provide new loans. Several newspapers expressed great surprise.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 8th - Republican Senator Pittman suggested suspending war debt payments for two or three years to alleviate the global economic decline. Pittman, a member of the Finance Committee, claimed not to be in favor of abolishing or amending war debts.</p>
<h3 id="e70">International Silver Conference Raises Questions <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Smoot Reiterates Previous Proposal</p>
<p>British Financiers Busy Lobbying</p>
<p>Reuters, Salt Lake City, 8th - Senate Finance Committee Chairman Smoot reiterated today that convening an informal international conference is the quickest way to solve the silver problem. Smoot criticized Senator Pittman's remarks in Shanghai, criticizing President Hoover for not convening a formal conference, saying that President Hoover followed common practice and, before formally convening, had to ascertain whether the foreign governments concerned could accept the invitation to convene the conference. As a result of the investigation, the British government and another relevant government are currently unwilling to accept this invitation. These two governments may change their attitude in the future, but an international conference is absolutely useless without the participation of these two countries. Pittman knows this well, so he has the proposal for an informal conference. He believes that this is the safest and quickest way to make the governments of all countries directly or indirectly related aware of the need for an international silver conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 8th - Darling, a director of the London Midland Bank and the originator of the Rucks currency system, visited President Hoover today, then had lunch with Senators Borah and King. He then departed for Canada without announcing the contents of his talks with the US President and Senators, but it is widely believed that the discussions were related to restoring the price of silver. Darling strongly advocates purchasing silver at low prices to mint coins. Senator King, after meeting with Darling, strongly urged the government to convene a silver conference. King argues that the conference should be initiated by the government and does not support Smoot's proposal for informal negotiations.</p>

<p>Dr. Wu Advocates Banning Production</p>
<p>Soviet Proposal to Restrict Planting Rejected</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 8th - Today, the International Opium Conference rejected the Soviet representative's proposal to ban the planting of opium poppies by a vote of 43 to 2. The majority of representatives believe that the conference should only focus on banning the chemical products of drugs and not the raw materials. Representatives from all countries with colonies strongly opposed the Soviet proposal, while Chinese representative Dr. Shih Chao-chi stated that banning raw materials and restricting the chemical products of drugs are inseparable. Chinese representative Wu Lien-te also expressed his opinion, stating that tens of kilograms of heroin are smuggled into China every year, causing unimaginable harm. Banning the production of this substance is extremely urgent. The Vienna issue has been shelved by the conference.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Round Table Conference Convened in September <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Composition Committee Remains the Same</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - Conservative Party leader Baldwin wrote to British Prime Minister MacDonald opposing the convening of the Indian Round Table Conference during the summer holidays in August and September. This letter was sent on May 24th and has only just been published. Baldwin believes that if the conference is held in the autumn, it will be more likely to succeed. Furthermore, there is doubt whether this conference will have good results at a time when the national atmosphere in India remains turbulent. Furthermore, this conference must proceed from where the previous conference left off, and problems that have already been resolved cannot be re-raised. On June 5th, MacDonald replied that the government was eager to proceed, but was prevented from convening the conference before September due to various reasons. The recent outbreak of ethnic strife is indeed a major obstacle to resolving the Indian problem, but he believes that another meeting of the Minority Committee in London may lead to a solution to this matter. Furthermore, this conference is not a popularly elected legislative assembly, and bills containing new constitutions must be submitted to the British Parliament. Reuters, London, 8th - British Secretary of State for India Benn stated in the House of Commons today that the members of the Indian Federal Structure Committee remain the same, but with some additions. It is still inconvenient to announce the formal invitation, which will be handled by the Indian Governor-General as before. Representatives from oppressed ethnic groups will participate in the conference. As for whether the Federal Structure Committee has representatives, this is currently under consideration. A member asked whether the delay in convening the second Round Table Conference was intended to proceed with the unresolved issues regarding the future of the provincial government. Benn replied that he was unaware of any fundamental issues regarding the provinces that were still awaiting discussion. He only knew of ethnic issues and issues related to the relationship between the central government and the provinces. A member inquired about the establishment of companies in India that purchase boycotted fabrics and transport them for sale abroad. Benn replied that this is a public company that has not solicited shares and has not yet purchased stockpiled fabrics.</p>

American rule in Puerto Rico has no achievements, and even tens of millions of people know that its failure has been prepared to witness the removal of the American flag and the replacement of the new flag of the Puerto Rican Republic. Only this island, where the sovereignty of the Spanish-American nation is controlled by others, is a shame to the people of the whole island.

Please also pay attention to the current economic panic, saying that the United States has no effective way to alleviate the suffering of the islanders.

<p>Mistaken for Robber and Shot Immediately</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Cruel Treatment of Mexican Immigrants by American Officials</p>
<p>National News Agency, Ardmore (Oklahoma), 8th - Last night, several guards here shot and killed two Mexican youths while patrolling the main road. It was later learned that one of them, named Ropiu, was the nephew of the Mexican President. It is now heard that the two guards who fired the shots have been detained for investigation. According to the Mexican youth in the same car, they were all studying in the United States and were returning to Mexico City by car for the summer vacation. Because the southwestern states they lived in in the United States were sparsely populated, they were afraid of encountering robbers on the way, so they all carried guns for self-defense. When the incident occurred, the car was moving slowly, and when they saw the guards blocking the car, they suspected that they had encountered robbers, so they increased their speed in an attempt to rush through. They did not expect that the guards would shoot immediately, so the fault lies with the American officials' recklessness.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Mexico City, 8th - The news that the Mexican President's nephew was shot and killed by American police officers was met with great indignation in Mexico City. The American Ambassador here immediately visited the Mexican President to apologize on behalf of the American government upon hearing the news. Mexican newspapers stated that this case shows the attitude of guards in the southwestern states of the United States towards Mexican immigrants. These people usually regard Mexicans as robbers. It is expected that they will know to be more cautious after this case.</p>

<p>Approved Zhejiang to Issue Debt Clearance Bonds</p>
<p>Hankou Municipality Reorganized Under Provincial Government</p>
<p>Appointment of Ma Hongkui as Chairman of Ningxia</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 25th State Council meeting on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Attendees: Chiang Kai-shek, Liu Juiheng, Wang Zhengting, Liu Shangqing, Kong Xiangxi, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Boqun. Observers: Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Li Shuhua. Chairman: Chiang Kai-shek. The resolutions were announced as follows: (1) The Zhejiang Provincial Government submitted a report stating that Zhejiang Province is experiencing financial difficulties and has significant arrears. It is proposed to issue Zhejiang Province Republic of China Year 20 Debt Clearance Bonds of 8 million yuan, specifically for clearing various arrears. The draft regulations have been prepared and submitted for review and approval. The resolution was passed and sent to the Legislative Yuan. (2) The Hubei Provincial Government telegraphed on the 31st of last month stating that the reorganization of the provincial and municipal governments is about to be completed. However, Hankou Municipality was originally planned to be changed from a special municipality to an ordinary municipality, but after soliciting opinions from all sectors in Wuhan, it was unanimously agreed that there is no need to establish a municipal government in Hankou. Those in charge of the business community are particularly firm. It is now proposed not to establish a municipality for the time being, but only to organize a municipal committee affiliated with the provincial government to specifically handle the municipal administration of Hankou. The establishment of a municipality will be considered when finances are sufficient and the municipal administration is developed. Please issue an order to cancel the current order to facilitate the completion of the process. Is this appropriate? Please telegraph instructions for compliance. The resolution was passed to change Hankou to a municipality affiliated with the provincial government and submitted to the National Government for promulgation. (3) Minister Kong proposed that there are many stone statues of Buddhas and figures in the caves of Tianlong Mountain in Taiyuan, Shanxi, which are carved into concave shapes on the stone walls and are massive creations from the prosperous period of the Northern Wei Tuoba clan. Recently, due to inadequate protection, there have been frequent cases of theft, sale, or damage. Even the stone roof of the cave has been seized by antique dealers with violence. It is proposed to order the local officials in Shanxi to provide effective protection to prevent further losses and to strictly investigate and order the return of those that have been stolen. Other provinces and cities also experience similar cases of damage to antiquities from time to time. It is also requested that the local governments of all provinces and cities be notified to take measures to preserve all antiquities within their borders and to strictly investigate and punish those who privately transport them, thereby maintaining the historical sites. Is this appropriate for resolution? The resolution was approved and submitted to the National Government to implement the promulgated Law on the Preservation of Antiquities from June 15th of this year and to order the Ministries of Interior and Education to properly formulate measures for implementation of preservation and return of antiquities and circulate them to the provincial and municipal governments for effective implementation. (4) The Ministry of Industry submitted the organization charter of the Commodity Inspection Bureau for review and record. The resolution was passed and submitted to the National Government for record. (5) The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance jointly reported that Article 9 of the Republic of China Year 20 Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bond Regulations contains the term "special tax". Now that the special consumption tax has been suspended, the name of this special tax should be revised. This is respectfully submitted for review and amendment. The resolution was passed and sent to the Legislative Yuan. (6) It was resolved to appoint Ma Hongkui as Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial Government. (7) Zhang Daofan, member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Education Department, submitted a request to resign. The resolution was to retain him. (8) It was resolved that Li Zhonggong, member of the Anhui Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Education Department, submitted a request to resign. The resolution was to retain him. Before he takes office, Commissioner Yu Enbo will be temporarily appointed as acting director. (9) It was discussed that the vacancy left by Jin Tao, Senior Engineer of the Ministry of Railways, being appointed to another position should be filled by promoting Zhu Baofen, Recommended Engineer.</p>
<h3 id="e80">A Declaration by Japan's Overseas Comrades Association, Truly Astonishing <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Deliberating on Emergency Countermeasures Against China</p>
<p>Advocating a Hardening of Stance on Railway Issues</p>
<p>Our Compatriots Should Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Japanese, due to their small land and large population, have long harbored desires to invade China to fulfill their colonial ambitions. Currently, as our nation engages with various countries to revise unequal treaties, Japan is vehemently opposing it.</p>
<p>They have now united officials and civilians to establish the Overseas Comrades Association, issuing a declaration to oppose our nation's treaty abolition. Their advocacy for a hardened stance on the Manchurian-Mongolian railway issue is particularly noteworthy. The named initiators of the Overseas Comrades Association include thirty-two prominent figures from Japanese political and social circles, such as Duke Sanetaka Ichijo, Baron Norikiyo Kami, and Narimoto Ohaba. The sponsors include one hundred and fifteen individuals such as Baron Kaneko Yudo. Shenyang has recently received the original text of the declaration issued by the association from Tokyo. We urge all compatriots not to dismiss it as mere bluster.</p>
<p>Regarding the Manchurian-Mongolian railway issue, China is currently employing two means to pressure the South Manchuria Railway (SMR): (1) disregarding past precedents and thoroughly engaging in low-price competition to reduce freight rates, and (2) implementing plans to encircle the SMR. Their intention is to diminish the economic value of the SMR and dampen our nation's enthusiasm for maintaining the SMR, as a clear strategy for reclaiming it in the future. At this juncture, if we do not make a resolute decision to shatter China's wishful thinking, they will undoubtedly employ oppressive measures and gradually attempt to reclaim administrative rights over affiliated territories and the right to garrison troops after stationing them. It is not difficult to foresee them also imposing difficulties on us through political means. It is a sound principle to eliminate disputes before they escalate. It goes without saying that to uphold the empire's rightful position, we should adopt a firm attitude to counter this. Regarding the aforementioned first point, China's unreasonable freight rate competition, our nation (Japan) should take a resolute stance in response, making them realize the futility of competition. If we do not inflict a severe blow, engaging in discussions of compromise under the guise of "coexistence and co-prosperity" will be tantamount to surrender. The empire should not take such a path at this time. Regarding the second point above, the SMR encirclement plan, the Japanese Empire should vow to resist based on the prohibition of parallel and competing lines stipulated in the Beijing Agreement of 1905 (Meiji 38). Any railway plan that infringes upon these rights should be resolutely denied. To uphold the interests of that agreement, the empire should, if deemed necessary, adopt self-defense measures, expressing its intention to shatter China's delusions. Furthermore, the Jilin-Hunchun Railway and the Taonan-Angangxi-Jidun Railway, constructed with loans from us (Japan) despite the empire's protests, currently violate the original contracts. To uphold our nation's rights and interests, it is appropriate to adopt suitable measures. Furthermore, according to the Gando Convention, we should, at this time, compel China to allow our nation to construct the Jilin-Hui Railway. If they reject this request, our nation should explicitly declare the termination of the Gando Convention and restore the state of the border between our two countries along the Tumen River to its condition before the convention's establishment. Our demand to construct that railway is the price for relinquishing our claim to the territory of former Korea in the Gando region. If China does not sincerely deliver this price, the empire should deem China to have voluntarily relinquished the substance of the convention and proceed to occupy Gando as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Regarding the Concession Issue, the return of concessions is a long-standing plan of the Chinese government. Their current request for the return of our Hankou concession is merely a manifestation of this plan. Our government should refuse, stating that the return of concessions should not be discussed until the issue of extraterritoriality is resolved, adhering to this policy without any alteration. The Chinese side's success in reclaiming the British concessions in Jiujiang and Hankou the year before was nothing short of a forceful seizure. We must ensure that such incidents are not repeated. We should use our strength to protect our concessions. The empire's position and rights in the Shanghai International Settlement are equal to those of Britain. Given that the number of our residents is several times greater than that of the British, we should uphold our nation's position in the Shanghai International Settlement. Furthermore, regarding the future fate of that settlement, the empire should always hold a significant position and rights.</p>
<p>Regarding the Issue of Extraterritoriality, abolishing extraterritoriality in one fell swoop is practically impossible given China's current circumstances. Even Britain and the United States advocate for a gradual abolition. If we can coordinate with the empire on matters of mutual interest and jointly reject this unreasonable demand, ensuring that we do not engage in unsightly concessions or appeasement, that would be ideal. Furthermore, administrative rights over affiliated territories do not fall within the scope of trade but derive from the treaty by which our nation received these territories from Qing Russia in 1905 (Meiji 38). As we approach treaty revision, it is clear that there is no possibility of modifying that treaty.</p>
<p>Regarding the Issue of Foreign Loans, since the establishment of the Nanjing government, there have been frequent reports of comprehensive plans for loans from foreign loan syndicates, particularly the Manchurian-Mongolian railway network loans that oppress the SMR, which are suspect. Japan should alert the four-nation loan syndicate with whom we have agreements to the dangers of recklessly investing in China and consider whether to study specific measures for making substantial revisions to existing loan regulations, consulting with the great powers.</p>
<p>Regarding the Normalization of Sino-Japanese Relations, we should urge China to reflect on the slogans of abolishing unequal treaties and overthrowing imperialism and crack down on anti-Japanese content in Chinese textbooks and materials that incite animosity in Chinese youth. We should seriously negotiate with China to ensure their elimination, preventing harm to the peace between the two countries. Furthermore, to maintain the overall situation in East Asia and enhance friendly relations with neighboring countries, Japan should establish appropriate propaganda organs in various parts of China to facilitate propaganda and enlighten the Chinese populace about the harmony of Sino-Japanese relations. Currently, it is generally acknowledged that our nation's diplomacy towards China is weak. For the fundamental interests of the empire, we should adhere to the following conditions: (1) respect treaties and ensure diplomatic prestige; (2) secure our nation's rights and interests in Manchuria; and (3) uphold the interests of Koreans in Manchuria. Since the Washington Conference, our country has demonstrated a spirit of international cooperation and made significant concessions in its diplomacy towards China. However, not only have we received no recompense, but we have also encouraged their recklessness. The disregard for treaties in Manchuria is a prime example. Is it not lamentable that this has led to our country's isolation in the world? If we continue to employ stopgap measures without a fundamental guarantee policy, I fear that the relinquishment of our rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia will occur over time, and we will only gain a reputation for "co-prosperity." This association, in deliberating on emergency countermeasures against China, transcends all policies and political factions, aiming for consistent spirit. It is our earnest hope that the SMR will be brought to a competitive victory. To overcome these difficulties, we hope that the nation will rouse its spirit, that the government and the people will unite, and that all sectors will foster a great-nation mentality. Then, the reach of our authority will not only enhance our national prestige. We hope you will appreciate this. (June 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Opposition to Production and Sales Taxes by the Business Community in Hebei Remains Fierce <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Businesses in All Sectors Halt the Shipment of Goods</p>
<p>A Final Decision to Continue the Strike</p>
<p>Chambers of Commerce in Various Cities and Counties Appeal to Zhang</p>
<p>Tianjin News: Regarding the production and sales taxes in Hebei Province, the Tianjin business community previously sent representatives to Ping (Beijing) to petition Zhang Xueliang for their abolition. However, due to Zhang's illness, Chief of Staff Ji Yi of the Deputy Commander's Headquarters received them. At that time, Ji responsibly stated to the petitioning representatives that the taxes would be levied more leniently. However, according to investigations, as of the afternoon of the 3rd, the Tianjin East Station Production and Sales Tax Bureau and the Sugar Production and Sales Tax Bureau had not yet received a formal order from the Financial Commissioner's Office. Furthermore, a notice was issued to all trade associations. Therefore, a meeting was convened to discuss measures to address the production and sales taxes. Chairman Yang Wancheng first reported that he had received a telephone call from Beijing from the petitioning representatives remaining in Ping, reporting that they had met with Ji Yi, who verbally promised that the production and sales taxes in Ping and Tianjin would be temporarily suspended. In reality, such a verbal promise is insufficient, and we should continue our efforts and not stop until the goal of abolishing the taxes is achieved. Next, tea merchant representative Geng Richu proposed that since we have received a telephone call from Beijing stating that the taxes will be temporarily suspended, what steps should various sectors take? It was unanimously decided that various sectors should persevere to the end and not resume shipments or transportation until a formal announcement abolishing the production and sales taxes is seen, in order to achieve final victory. Subsequently, representatives from various sectors spoke one after another with great fervor, generally agreeing that the production and sales taxes would lead to the merchants' demise. Therefore, no matter what sacrifices are necessary, they would not relent until the production and sales taxes are completely abolished. On the 4th, a meeting continued, at which the petitioning representatives who went to Ping, Chen Chuxiang and Li Kuotian, reported on the progress of their negotiations in Ping and elected Chen Chuxiang as chairman. According to Chen's report, the petitioners went to Ping entrusted by the various sectors, and the glimmer of hope they had obtained was that Jing Youyan indicated that the production and sales taxes could be temporarily suspended. However, after seeing Chief of Staff Ji Yi, they were told that Special Commissioner Jing had no authority to make such a decision regarding the tax, so a decision could only be made after the Deputy Commander recovered from his illness. Because the authorities' methods are ambiguous, we were ultimately unable to achieve our goal. Although Beijing is also temporarily suspending the taxes, there are still instances of extortion. Tianjin's situation is even more different from Beijing's. Most of the import and export of goods passes through here. If this is not thoroughly resolved, it is tantamount to placing the business community in a deadly situation. We should discuss measures to address this in order to achieve our wishes. After discussion, it was decided to send representatives to Ping again to work with the Beijing business community to strive for the immediate abolition of the production and sales taxes. If there is still no satisfactory result and the authorities respond with ambiguous measures, we should continue with the previous proposal to strike in order to resist, etc.</p>
<p>Eighty-eight organizations of chambers of commerce from various cities and counties in Hebei Province specially prepared a document to Zhang Xueliang requesting the cancellation of the production and sales taxes. The original text reads: "Submitting a document concerning the harsh and burdensome production and sales taxes, which harm businesses and the people. We earnestly request that you order a fundamental cancellation to alleviate the hardships of businesses and relieve the distress of the people. Since the years of continuous warfare, the losses of Hebei's merchants and people have been the heaviest. Fortunately, the central government, mindful of the people's suffering, resolutely abolished the likin tax, and the vitality was slightly restored, and the people were overjoyed. Unexpectedly, the customs tax was increased and implemented on June 1st. Then, the production and sales tax and the business tax were successively introduced, pressing in upon us. Abolishing one likin tax and replacing it with three taxes has already greatly deviated from the purpose of abolishing the likin tax. Moreover, what is not produced? What goods are not sold? The items listed encompass everything, including even the daily necessities of small-scale operations such as shoulder-pole carriers and vendors of rice, flour, oil, and firewood. None can escape the production, sales, and business taxes. Such heavy levies and indiscriminate exactions are not only a transformed likin tax but are also a hundredfold worse than the likin tax. How can we, the surviving remnants, endure this? We have long admired your kindness and compassion, your advocacy of peace, and your prioritizing of the people's livelihood. Therefore, the representatives have come from afar to prostrate themselves and plead for your decisive action to strictly order the cancellation of the production and sales taxes on goods that harm businesses and the people, in order to relieve the suffering of the 30 million merchants and people of Hebei. The situation is urgent, and we have presumptuously submitted this document. We humbly request your consideration and implementation, and we await your orders. Respectfully presented by Tian Zhuobin, Chairman of the Julu County Chamber of Commerce, Jia Huipu and Wang Enpu, representatives of the Tangshan County Chamber of Commerce, Liu Songting, Zong Hanbo, and Wei Jiuyan, representatives of the Tong County Chamber of Commerce, and a total of eighty-eight organizations (June 5th)."</p>

<p>Lu Xinming's Troops Recaptured Ruijin County</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the two contingents of Red bandits led by Zhu De and Peng Dehuai from Guangchang and Ningdu in eastern Jiangxi were defeated by the Sixth Route Army led by Zhu Shaoliang and the Twenty-sixth Route Army led by Sun Lianzhong, they regrouped with 5,000 to 6,000 men in Lichuan and Nanfeng and fled into Guangze and Jianning counties in northern Fujian. They were severely suppressed by the troops stationed in Guangze, led by Lin Bingzhou, and the troops stationed in Jianning, led by Liu Shang. They then fled from Guangze and Jianning into Shaowu and TaiNing, plotting to use Shaowu as a base to connect with the two contingents of Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping in Chong'an and Pucheng, vainly attempting to rise up again. The provincial government repeatedly received reports and telegraphed Liu Heding's division to encircle and suppress them, preventing them from creating disturbances. Liu's divisional troops have now concentrated in Shunchang and are advancing towards Shaowu. At the same time, Qian Yuguang and Lin Bingzhou's two brigades have concentrated in Chong'an and are advancing towards Guangze, attacking from both sides to put them in a situation of facing enemies on both their front and rear. A major battle is expected to occur between Shaowu and Guangze within a day or two. Another contingent of Red bandits invaded Fujian from Ruijin on the Jiangxi border, attempting to connect with the local Red bandits in western Fujian's military towns of Longyan, Shanghang, and Yongding. The First Detachment of the Western Fujian Bandit Suppression Forward Command, led by Lu Xinming, intercepted them head-on at Gucheng, a place on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi. The bandit forces were unable to withstand the attack and retreated back into Ruijin. Captain Lu then dispatched Regiment Commander Ma Hongxing to track and pursue them. The bandits collapsed upon seeing them. Regiment Commander Ma captured the county seat of Ruijin. The regiment is now coordinating with friendly forces to advance and thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits. (June 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Circumstances of Hu Zuyu's Death from Injuries <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Hunyuan Serves as Acting Commander of the Fifth Division</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Hu Zuyu, commander of the Fifth Division, was shot in the abdomen during a fierce battle with Red bandits in Guangchang on May 27. He was escorted to the provincial capital by the division headquarters and admitted to Nanchang Hospital on June 2 for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he passed away at 5:50 PM on the 3rd. The encoffining ceremony was held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 10:00 PM on the 4th. The Fifth Division's troops are currently under the command of Deputy Division Commander Zhou Hunyuan. The detailed circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Injury: At 5:00 AM on May 27, tens of thousands of Red bandits attacked Guangchang. The troops stationed in the city were the Fifth Division and the Twenty-fourth Division, under the command of Zhu Shaoliang. Hu Zuyu, commander of the Fifth Division, at that time personally supervised the troops and bravely suppressed the bandits on the front line. The bandits repeatedly launched fierce assaults, but they were all repelled. The casualties among the Red bandits were numerous. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented since the bandit suppression efforts in Jiangxi Province began. Later, Hu planned to send troops to outflank the bandits from the left wing and cut off their retreat route. He climbed to the highest point to observe with binoculars. Unfortunately, at 7:30 AM, he was shot in the abdomen, the bullet entering below the right costal margin and exiting below the left posterior costal margin, also wounding his left arm. Despite being injured, he refused to retreat and continued to encourage the officers and soldiers to bravely advance, directing all strategies. He endured until he could no longer sustain himself and descended the mountain. After reaching the division headquarters, he collapsed on a bed, drenched in sweat, bleeding profusely, and vomiting a coffee-colored substance. He gradually fell into a coma. Zheng, the chief medical officer of the division, immediately administered cardiac stimulants, which stabilized him somewhat, and he gradually regained consciousness. He even made a phone call to report to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and frequently inquired about the battle situation.</p>
<p>Treatment Process: That afternoon at 5:00 PM, the division dispatched personnel to escort him away from Guangchang. On the 29th, he arrived in Nanfeng. At 3:00 AM on June 2, he arrived safely in Nanchang and was admitted to Ward 212 of Nanchang Hospital. Along the way, his pulse was 96 and his temperature was 38 degrees Celsius. After entering the hospital, doctors diagnosed that his stomach, liver, spleen, and other abdominal organs were injured, posing a risk of peritonitis. An enema was administered, and he was fed nutrient juice through the anus. According to the doctors, his stomach was injured, and there was concern that food would spill out of the wound, causing peritonitis, which was quite dangerous. In the afternoon of the 2nd, Minister He visited the hospital to express his condolences, and Hu inquired about the situation in Guangdong. Minister He then provided 3,000 yuan for medical expenses and instructed him to rest and recuperate. On the morning of the 3rd, Doctors Niu Huilin and Niu Huisheng from Shanghai arrived by plane to examine him. They stated that his lungs were also injured, posing a risk of pneumonia. Cardiac stimulants and sedatives were administered, and nutrient juice was infused. They said that the lower lobe of his left lung was severely inflamed due to the injury and that it would take a week to reach a safe condition. On that day, his pulse and temperature were normal, and Hu himself felt comfortable. However, at 5:00 PM that afternoon, he suddenly began to sweat profusely and vomit fresh blood. He passed away suddenly in just fifteen minutes, without leaving any last words to his family.</p>
<p>Moving the Coffin to the Park: Guo Su, chief of staff of the division, and Yao Chun, commander of the Fourteenth Brigade, were taking care of him in Nanchang. At 11:00 PM on the 3rd, they consulted with Provincial Department Directors Jiang and Gong and moved Hu's remains to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Yuzhang Park. Zhang Muhan, director of the commander's office stationed in the province, was dispatched to report to Minister He. Minister He was extremely saddened by this tragic news and immediately instructed Director Zhang to handle Commander Hu's funeral generously. He also telegraphed the central government and Commander-in-Chief Jiang to offer generous compensation to console his heroic spirit.</p>
<p>The Encoffining Ceremony: Chairman Lu of the provincial government and all the committee members believed that Commander Hu had made outstanding contributions in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and issued a special order yesterday for all provincial agencies, organizations, and schools to mourn in unison and send representatives to participate in the encoffining ceremony. The encoffining ceremony was held at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 4th. In addition to Minister He, who was unable to attend in person due to official duties and specially sent his aide-de-camp as his representative to pay respects, Chairman Lu and leaders from party, government, military, and business circles went to pay their respects and view the remains. Hu's family members were all in Suzhou. Only his elder brother Laisheng and younger brother Peizhi were present to view the encoffining. Hu was dressed in his lieutenant general's uniform with his command saber at his waist. The coffin was made of Phoebe zhennan wood and was worth 1,200 yuan. After the encoffining, the spirit tablet was placed in the center of the coffin, draped with a party flag and a national flag. Two wreaths were placed on either side of the spirit tablet, inscribed with the words "His Noble Spirit Lives On Forever." The Fifth Division headquarters telegraphed the entire division yesterday, ordering all officers and soldiers to wear black armbands. The provincial government's provincial affairs meeting yesterday was also suspended for one day in mourning. Furthermore, Chairman Lu instructed that Commander Hu's funeral should be handled solemnly and initiated the joint organization of funeral affairs by party, government, and military agencies. A funeral committee of nine people was appointed, nominated by various agencies.</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Anhui Provincial Government Rectifies the Business Tax <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Ordering Various County Bureaus to Assist in Implementation</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Since the implementation of the business tax in Anhui Province, there have been repeated setbacks due to the hesitant attitudes of merchants. Yesterday, the provincial government issued an urgent telegram ordering various county governments and public security bureaus to assist in the implementation and stipulating six regulations, strictly ordering all commissioners to comply. Excerpts from the two telegrams are recorded below: (1) Telegram to various county governments and public security bureaus: "The delay and obstruction in the implementation of the business tax in various counties is due to the hesitant attitudes of merchants, but it is also largely due to the control and covert manipulation by chambers of commerce. Although commissioners have reported that more than twenty districts have begun collecting the tax, the estimated capital and business income are mostly inaccurate, resulting in a significant loss of tax revenue. The delays and excuses for failing to report and pay the tax are even more unacceptable. The deadline for the first installment of taxes this year is approaching, and further delays or leniency are no longer possible. In addition to stipulating six regulations and strictly ordering all commissioners to comply, this telegram instructs the county and bureau chiefs to earnestly take responsibility and assist in the implementation. If any merchants refuse to be investigated or arbitrarily resist the tax, the county and bureau chiefs should jointly compel them to pay the tax and impose fines according to the regulations. If anyone in the chamber of commerce instigates resistance, their names should be ascertained and reported to this government for verification and action. As this matter concerns the provincial finances, this government will use it as a basis for evaluating the performance of the county and bureau chiefs. Do not show favoritism or cause inconvenience." (2) Telegram to various commissioners: "The business tax in various districts has been implemented for half a year. Although most commissioners have reported that they have begun collecting the tax, the estimated capital and business income of various industries are often filled out freely by the merchants without any actual investigation, which is mostly perfunctory. The delays and excuses for failing to collect the tax are even more unacceptable. The following regulations are hereby stipulated: (1) If the capital and business income filled out by various merchants are deemed inappropriate, they should be investigated according to the regulations, and their registers should be earnestly estimated. (2) The first installment of taxes for this year must be collected in full by the end of June. (3) All businesses with capital of more than 500 yuan are not allowed to request tax exemption, except as otherwise stipulated in the previously issued regulations. The commissioner shall not request tax exemption on this basis. (4) If any merchants refuse to be investigated or resist paying the tax, the commissioner shall send a letter to the county government to compel them to pay the tax and impose penalties according to the regulations. (5) If any chamber of commerce instigates resistance, the names of the instigators should be ascertained and reported to this government for verification and action. (6) If any commissioner continues to be dilatory or perfunctory, the Department of Finance will impose penalties accordingly. In addition to separate telegrams, this commissioner is ordered to strictly comply (June 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Summary of Important News <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>A discussion on disaster relief led to the following resolutions: (1) Regarding the method of urging the central government to continue issuing relief funds, it was resolved to telegraph President Yu, the Shaanxi representatives in the National Assembly, and the relief association representatives to urge the central government to issue the funds. (2) Regarding how to dispose of the 100,000 yuan in relief funds that the central government has now issued, it was resolved to discuss it further after the funds arrive. (3) Regarding the severe shortage of draught cattle in the disaster areas, it was resolved to actively raise funds to purchase and transport them and to request that the provincial government strictly prohibit the slaughter of draught cattle, with severe penalties for those who slaughter and consume them. (4) Regarding how to regulate the agricultural implement pawn shops, which have been ordered to close, it was resolved to instruct the various pawn shops to notify farmers to redeem them without interest starting from June 1 to facilitate agricultural work. A temporary motion was made to establish rural cooperatives, and it was resolved to draft organizational methods or outlines separately. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaanxi Province is still severe, and the cries of hunger from various counties continue unabated. The disaster situation reported by various counties is as follows: (1) In Chengcheng County, there has been no rain or snow since last winter. Since the beginning of spring, there has been no rain from the first to the fourth rain period. It was not until May that there was a light shower. The wheat crops that had been hoed were so sparse that those that did not wither and die were almost non-existent. The amount of rainfall in Chengcheng County is particularly scarce compared to the eastern and western areas, only one or two tenths. The wheat is immature, and cotton has not been planted. Not only is there no clothing or food to survive the year, but even the current livelihood is difficult to maintain. In recent months, cases of suicide have been reported in the eastern, western, southern, and northern areas of the county. Therefore, we hope for prompt relief. (2) The disasters and banditry in Ningxia County over the years are countless. The floods in 1926 and 1927 and the droughts in 1929 and 1930 have turned the original mulberry fields into the sea. The waters of the Meridian Avenue are difficult to traverse. The rich are impoverished in an instant, and the dead are buried in the bellies of fish. The suffering of the entire county from the flood is unprecedented in Ningxia. Unexpectedly, waves of bandits entered the territory last winter, the large bandit gangs of Peng Zhengang and others and countless unnamed small gangs arrived one after another. The cruelty of their trampling is indescribable. Suffering within suffering, pain within pain. Such disasters and banditry have been prolonged for six years. Exiles await rescue, and they will not survive without relief. (3) In the three northeastern districts of Weinan County, the damage was most severe from April 17 to May 2 or 3. A strong wind rose, and flying sand and rocks filled the sky, obscuring the sun. Tiled roofs shook, and trees were destroyed. The leaves of plants were completely covered by sand and rocks. Wheat, beans, and other crops were also damaged and withered. Even more so, the wheat seedlings were in the flowering stage and were destroyed by the wind, resulting in insufficient fruit set and small, weak grains. Therefore, the price of wheat has increased, and people's lives are difficult. Currently, people are digging up grass roots and peeling tree bark to eat to fill their stomachs.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Fuzhou Seizes Foreign-Branded Opium Dens <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Taiwanese Who Opened Opium Dens Are Sent Back to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>However, the Taiwanese Still Secretly Sell Pure Opium Paste</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Taiwanese people have been opening opium dens and earth platforms in Fuzhou and Xiamen, undermining our country's opium prohibition. Recently, the provincial government telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese minister. The Japanese minister then ordered the Japanese consul stationed in Fujian to have local opium prohibition agencies notify the consulate by telephone whenever Taiwanese open foreign-branded opium dens in Fujian. The consulate would then dispatch police to jointly investigate and confiscate the foreign-branded signs and repatriate the Taiwanese, emphasizing opium prohibition and upholding national honor. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the provincial government to inform them of the matter and instructed them to handle it accordingly. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government immediately ordered the Opium Prohibition Committee to dispatch Commissioner Zhu Fuliang to the Japanese consulate to meet with Consul Tamura and request that the foreign-branded signs previously confiscated in joint operations by Chinese and Japanese police be sealed first. As for the repatriation of the Taiwanese, Consul initially evaded the issue, but after Commissioner Zhu's stern questioning, he finally agreed to comply. On May 27, he dispatched many Japanese and Taiwanese police officers from this office to various places, including Xiangxia Temple, Fanchuanpu, Fuxin Street, Zhoubian Street, Tudi Temple, Hechun Cheng, Nanmen Dou, Xiying Li, Xueyuan Qian, Macau Bridge, and Gaojie Li, to seal all 50-odd foreign-branded opium dens and earth platforms, including Yonglong, Gonghe, Yongtai, and Shiquan, which had been raided four to over ten times. The more than 100 Taiwanese who opened these shops were immediately repatriated. After this incident, the foreign firms that had not been sealed were greatly alarmed. Those with strong capital stopped operating to avoid losses, while those with smaller scale changed their tactics, stopped turning on the lights, and specialized in selling pure opium paste, shifting their business hours to after 5:00 PM (because the consulate has stopped working at this time) in an attempt to avoid the crackdown. The Opium Prohibition Committee is currently dispatching personnel to secretly investigate the brand names, locations, owners' names, and business hours in order to notify the Japanese consul and jointly crack down on them and pacify the opium atmosphere.</p>

<p>The case of Chen Fu, Director of the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital, being reported for alleged misconduct was addressed by the Control Yuan, which secretly telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting a thorough investigation for submission to the National Government for handling. Upon receiving the telegram, the Provincial Government forwarded the original telegram to the Department of Civil Affairs, and the reported content involves two charges: corruption and dereliction of duty.</p>

<p>A robbery occurred at Xianghua Bridge. An elderly woman named Nie, residing in Changqiao South, returned home disappointed. While walking across Xianghua Bridge, a young man, about twenty years old, dressed in a Western suit, ran up and told her that Mr. Zhang had returned, asking her to go back. As the woman turned around to go back, the young man snatched the gold hairpin from her hair and fled. At that time, the location was quiet and secluded, with no pedestrians on the road. The elderly woman shouted "Robbery!" and only then did pedestrians passing by hear the sound and begin to chase after the thief, but he had already disappeared. Subsequently, a patrol officer from the Second Precinct passed by and, according to the woman's report, immediately reported the incident by phone to the patrol supervisor, who dispatched police to various jewelry stores to inquire and sent plainclothes police to lie in wait for the thief. Unexpectedly, at Zerun Bridge, the Shicheng Silver Shop claimed that a young man in a Western suit had come to exchange a gold hairpin. He seemed unhappy with the value of one yuan and two and a half *jiao* and still kept it. The police chased westward but failed to catch him. However, when the woman reported to the patrol officer, she said that the gold hairpin weighed five *qian*, which was likely a false statement. The young man also seemed to realize that it was not real gold and was greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>British Consulate in Shanghai Inquires About the Case of a Killed Military Police Officer. A military police officer of the road protection squad, 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Regiment of the Military Police stationed in Suzhou, was shot and killed by someone on the railway in Zhengyi, Kunshan, several days ago, and two others were wounded by gunfire. Subsequently, a foreigner was captured by soldiers there and escorted to the Military Police Regiment headquarters in Suzhou, awaiting disposition. Yesterday (the 9th), the British Vice-Consul in Shanghai, Sakato, inquired at the county government about whether the foreigner captured was the British man, William Talbot (19 years old), who had gone missing from Shanghai at the time of the incident. County Magistrate Huang immediately stated that he had received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordering an investigation to determine whether the person was Russian or British. He had sent a letter to the Military Police Regiment but had not yet received a reply. Once he received a reply, he would immediately inform the Consul. Sakato then left and returned to Shanghai that evening.</p>
<p>The Dispute over Encroachment on Ancient Sites Remains Unresolved. The New Suzhou Farm planned to encroach on the remaining land of the Yishan Tantai Academy outside Fengmen Gate, where Yin Hejing studied, to build a farm. After several negotiations, the provincial government ordered that the ancient site of Yin Hejing's study place be demarcated and preserved, and the farm was allowed to claim the remaining land. Yesterday, County Magistrate Huang received an order from Governor Ye of the provincial government, stating that the New Suzhou Farm in the county had reported claiming a total of 18 *mu*, 5 *li*, and 2 *hao* of mountain land in Yishan, of which 6 *mu*, 9 *fen*, 6 *li*, and 6 *hao* were mountain land with four stone pillars and a stone tablet, which can be recorded as the site of Tantai Academy. It should be preserved. If only 2 *li* are demarcated for the preservation of ancient sites, it seems to be inconsistent with the original plan. He should be ordered to consult on a solution and submit it for review. The Shi family's gravesite was said to be demarcated by the New Suzhou Farm, together with the Shi family descendants and the gravesite preservation association, who independently divided the boundary markers. He should be ordered to draw a map of the agreed boundary and submit it for record. As for Mr. Yin Hejing's study place, the New Suzhou Farm also submitted that the records claimed that it was indeed in Tiger Hill, and the county should conduct a detailed investigation and reply for verification. He should be ordered to comply with the handling and first inform the New Suzhou Farm. The steles, records, photos, and drawings are all on file.</p>
<p>Wu County Establishes a Bandit Suppression Command Headquarters for Taihu Lake. The governors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, due to the instability caused by bandits in Taihu Lake, decided to thoroughly eliminate them. They specially appointed Zhu Mian, commander of the First Security Regiment of Jiangsu and commander of the Suzhou-Changzhou Pacification Area, as the temporary commander for coordinating the suppression of long-standing bandits in Taihu Lake, and Wang Zhiqi, commander of the Second Security Regiment of Zhejiang, as the deputy commander.

<p>Chamber of Commerce Telegrams to Request the Removal of Liyang County Magistrate. Liyang County Magistrate Li Jinfang, on the 30th of last month, suddenly used extraordinary means to surround the county's Chamber of Commerce with armed police. At the same time, four standing committee members of the chamber, including Shi Junsheng, Di Dechen, Hu Guoguang, and Sun Zuze, were detained and forced to confess late at night. Afterward, the chamber sent telegrams to various parties to appeal. As a result, the local county's Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Zhenjiang Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs for assistance and requested that Li Jinfang be removed from office and investigated to ensure compliance with the law. It is now heard that the chambers of commerce in Jiangsu Province are all outraged by this case and have already addressed Fang and Zhang, requesting that the county magistrate be severely punished.</p>
<p>Food Shops Disregard Hygiene; Police Bureau Punishes by Detention. Xu Jigui, director of the local Public Security Bureau, recently, with the arrival of summer, found that most food shops in the city did not cover their food with gauze, which was truly disregarding hygiene. He specially ordered health instructors to investigate the food shops. As a result of finding that some shops did not use gauze covers, the owners were detained and held by the bureau. There were over fifty cases. While each food shop recognized that the bureau was following proper procedures, they also said there had been no prior notice, and the detentions and punishments were too harsh. Therefore, they reported to the restaurant, meat, and other three trade associations, requesting assistance. The associations, upon receiving the reports, separately convened emergency meetings to discuss the results. They felt that this matter greatly hindered commercial order. Yesterday, the leaders of the associations, Ren Shuyin, Gu Ziyi, Wang Juting, and others, led over fifty members to the County Public Security Bureau to petition. Director Xu came out to meet the representatives, who stated their opinions in the petition. Director Xu stated that the bureau had repeatedly emphasized hygiene matters, but the shops had ignored them. Therefore, the bureau had to use decisive means to punish those who violated the rules. The intention was to punish one as a warning to a hundred. Since everyone had come to inquire today, the bureau would be lenient. The representatives felt that the results were quite satisfactory, so they bid farewell and left.</p>

<p>Silk Cocoon Store at Beigang Bridge Burns Down. In the western part of Wuyi County, only the Xinhua Silk Cocoon Store at Beigang Bridge was open this year, so the purchase of goods was quite strong. The store stopped purchasing goods on the 7th, having collected more than 300 *dan*. Unexpectedly, around 4 a.m. on the 8th, a fire suddenly broke out, spreading to the entire building. Although urgent efforts were made to put out the fire, it had already spread and the entire building and the collected cocoons were destroyed, with losses totaling approximately 20,000 yuan. Fortunately, there was fire insurance, so there is hope for compensation. A Torn Ransom Note Body Was Found at Chou City Bridge. Jiang Yinsheng, a bandit who was executed by firing squad in Jiangyin last year in August or September, kidnapped Xue Zhuchu, a resident of Xiqiao in the 5th district of the city, and demanded a ransom. Unable to obtain the ransom, Jiang tore up the ransom note and abandoned Xue's body. Xue's son was also killed by Jiang's gang and used as pig and dog feed. The means were cruel and shocking. After Jiang's execution, Xue's wife, remembering her husband's death a year prior and his bones still unburied, searched everywhere. Eventually, she went to Chou City Bridge in Wuyi and, on the 6th of this month, under the guidance of Hou Minggen (Jiang had paid Hou two silver dollars to help bury the body), discovered a body by the riverbank with its knees exposed. The body had not decayed, and the face was as it was in life, but the top of the head was covered in blood and the whole body was covered in dirt. Xue's wife recognized it as her husband's body. She immediately prepared a coffin, collected the body, and transported it back for burial. As for Hou Minggen, he was suspected of being an accomplice of the bandit and was summoned to the 4th District Office yesterday for questioning and supervision pending investigation.</p>

<p>The Sanxing Robbery Case in Shaji is Cracked. Chen Xuezhu, Director of the Third Public Security Bureau, previously received a tip that Wu Guisheng, Zhou A'gen, and other bandits who robbed Zhang Shengtang and Yan Guichun in Sanxing township were hiding near Datuan, on the border of Fengnan, inside a certain family's ancestral tomb. He immediately led police detectives to the area at night, captured the two bandits, and escorted them to the county.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>They confessed to the crimes during interrogation. However, Wu Guisheng confessed that he was already sixty-four years old and no longer had the strength to commit robbery. He only learned about the Zhang and Yan cases after the fact from someone who came to tell him, and he did not know if the pongee and other items given to him were stolen goods. In addition to ordering the summoning of the victims to identify and verify, the investigating officer Zhou ordered the police to apprehend all the fugitives involved in the case, both land and water police, yesterday.</p>

<p>The Intricate and Complex Liyang Corruption Case. Liyang County Magistrate Li Jinfang reported the second corruption case in Liyang County, alleging that the former Director of the Finance Bureau, Pan Keping, who has now been transferred to the Finance Bureau of Jiangning County, conspired with Shi Junsheng and others from the Standing Committee of the Liyang County Chamber of Commerce to embezzle public funds. Initially, Li arrested the four Standing Committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, but the Department of Civil Affairs reprimanded him for acting hastily. Li felt that he was being punished for official duties and telegraphed the province to resign. Upon hearing the news, the parks in the county telegraphed the province to request that he be retained. Pan Keping, who was reported, also telegraphed the provincial government yesterday to defend himself, saying that Li's accusations were completely false. The Supervisory Committee of the Liyang County Chamber of Commerce also sent an express telegram, stating that they were illegally detained and forced to confess by Li's abuse of power. The case is intricate and complex, and both the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance have sent personnel to investigate. The various news are described as follows:</p>
<p>Li Jinfang's Resignation Letter: To Ye, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Hu Jun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs: The county's Finance Bureau discovered a second major corruption case. I secretly telegraphed the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting the Jiangning County Magistrate to detain Director Pan Keping first to prevent him from escaping and requesting permission to send the case file to the province for review. It has been six days without instructions. In this case, the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce conspired to embezzle and solicit bribes, and the evidence is solid. A formal investigation is a proper procedure. Afterward, I only supervised them, did not abuse power, and did not detain them. However, Peng Jin, a Standing Committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, fled out of fear of punishment and fabricated accusations. The Director reprimanded me in a telegram on the day before yesterday, saying that County Magistrate Li of Liyang was accused by Peng Jin, a Standing Committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, of abuse of power and requested assistance. The County Magistrate acted hastily and should be reprimanded. The members of the Chamber of Commerce, including Shi Junsheng, Di Dechen, Hu Guoguang, and Sun Zuze, should be released first, pending investigation. Hu Zhiyin, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and others, obeyed the order. I was punished for official duties, and I have no complaints. However, I feel that I have failed to fulfill my duties and have caused the superiors to worry. It is useless to stay here, so I am resigning. In addition to sending the entire file of Pan Keping and the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce jointly committing corruption for review to the court for investigation, I respectfully request that personnel be sent to replace me as soon as possible. I await your orders. Li Jinfang, Acting County Magistrate of Liyang, respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Pan Keping's Defense Telegram: To Ye, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, and Hu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Chen, Director of the Department of Finance: I was shocked to read the oil-printed document of Liyang County Magistrate Li Jinfang's accusation of a second financial corruption in Liyang County. All new and old payments made by me during my tenure in Liyang Finance were made in accordance with legal procedures, and I have not made any mistakes. The allegations made by County Magistrate Li are completely false. In addition to submitting the details in a separate document, I respectfully request your review and verification. Pan Keping respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Supervisory Committee of the Liyang Chamber of Commerce also issued an express telegram to various newspapers and chambers of commerce, requesting justice, stating that Li had disagreements with Pan and wanted to make things difficult for him, inciting the Chamber of Commerce to fabricate false evidence. Initially, he used sweet words to deceive, then he used violence and coercion, and finally, he sent police to surround the Chamber of Commerce, search files and books, and arrest four Standing Committee members, detaining them in the police team headquarters and opening court late at night, forcing them to confess. They have now telegraphed the provincial government for a thorough investigation and punishment. Since the incident, the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance have sent personnel to conduct a secret investigation. The Department of Finance also sent inspector Ye Yongqing to investigate.</p>
<p>After investigating the accounts of the former Director of the Finance Bureau of Liyang, Pan Keping, the embezzlement of public funds was reported by the provincial government. County Magistrate Li was ordered to conduct a thorough investigation and, at the request of the local government, ordered Director Zhu to supervise the handover. It was later found that the Chamber of Commerce borrowed 35,000 yuan for purchasing guns, with a confirmed rebate of 5,000 yuan. County Magistrate Li felt that it was a matter of corruption and summoned the Standing Committee members of the Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the details. The members, fearing that they had committed bribery, hesitated and said that the accounts were handled by Peng Jin. County Magistrate Li only supervised them at the Dahua Hotel while awaiting Peng Jin's arrival and did not detain or imprison them. Unexpectedly, Peng, fearing punishment, fled to the province and fabricated facts, falsely accusing the government. In fact, the shops were very happy about this matter. Once the provincial government investigates and clarifies the matter, the truth will come out.</p>

At the same time, both families telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that the case be transferred to the court for handling. The news remained silent for many days. Yesterday, the county bureau received instructions from the provincial bureau to transfer the case to the Jiaxing branch court for interrogation. Therefore, on the 8th, the county bureau escorted Wang Zhongxing and Qian Yipeng, along with the case file, to the branch court's prosecutor's office for investigation.

<p>Middle School Party Education Begins Inspection</p>
<p>The Training Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters previously planned to conduct a Party Principles test for the highest grades of senior high and junior high schools in all municipal and registered private schools in the city in order to assess the general understanding of Party Principles among middle school students. Preparations have been underway, and the outline has been compiled. However, as the semester is coming to an end, the schools are also ending at different times. Rather than rushing, it is better to postpone the test to the first semester of the 20th year in order to allow for sufficient preparation and achieve better results. Therefore, it has been decided to postpone it to the first semester of the 20th year, which may be on a larger scale. The Party Principles Education Section will still send personnel to conduct the fourth inspection of Party Principles Education this semester.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Zheng Hongnian Discusses the Difficulty of Practice Versus Knowledge with Young People <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Guanghua University held its weekly memorial service in the morning, and President Zheng Hongnian delivered a speech. The ceremony was conducted as usual. Chairman Zhang Shouyong reported on university affairs and gave a speech introducing and highly praising Zheng's enthusiasm for education, saying that the subsidies for private universities were thanks to Zheng's planning of the additional tax on deed verification when he was in the Ministry of Finance. Mr. Zheng's son is also studying at this university, which shows his close relationship with the university. In the future, he is planning to invite him to be a school director to help Guanghua develop.</p>
<p>Zheng then elaborated on the theory of the difficulty of practice versus knowledge, saying that the Book of Documents says that "to know is not difficult, to practice is difficult." At that time, he was already worried about the creed because there were customs and ethics in the Three Dynasties. Ethics are nothing more than filial piety and brotherly respect. It seems easy to be filial to parents and respectful to elder brothers, but it is not possible to actually do it. Therefore, there is the saying that "to know is not difficult, to practice is difficult." Scholars in the Tang, Han, Song, and Yuan dynasties generally did not change this. It was not until Wang Yangming of the Ming dynasty advocated the unity of knowledge and action. Commentators said that Japan's strength was deeply rooted in Yangming's ideas. Dr. Sun Yat-sen completely proved the difficulty of practice and the ease of knowledge from a scientific perspective. In terms of time, it is moving forward. Modern young people have a great desire for knowledge, which is very good. In the future, the responsibility of society lies with the youth. Leaders are also to be made by the youth. Is it good or bad to have the idea of being a leader? Just ask whether it conforms to logic or not. There is a difference of a thousand miles. Young people should strive for true knowledge and true understanding. If they can have inventions and creations in academics and gain social belief, then they will be leaders without being asked to be leaders. Therefore, first seek true knowledge and then strive to practice, which is the way for young people to become leaders.</p>

<p>|German Sports Are Universally Developed|Many Talented Tennis Players Among Students Studying in Germany</p>
<p>In recent years, sports in China have gradually developed, and talents in various fields have emerged day by day. Overseas Chinese, influenced by what they see and hear, have also produced many special heroes, such as Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua, tennis players who are famous in China today. There have also been many cases of students studying abroad who have special sports talents and who have taken over in foreign sports circles, reversing the guest-host relationship and occupying important positions. The achievements of Mr. Tu Kaiyuan, described below, are one such example.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Successful in Studying Medicine in Germany <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tu Kaiyuan went to Germany in 1923 and entered the University of Berlin to major in medicine. He graduated in 1928 with outstanding results. He was then sent by the university to various famous specialized hospitals for three years of internship before returning to China on May 1 of this year. He has temporarily set up a clinic in the Jicheng Pharmacy on Nanjing Road. Mr. Tu lived in Germany for ten years. In addition to studying medicine, he often devoted himself to the sports world to show his天赋 talent. In a few years, his reputation rose greatly, and everyone in Berlin knew his name.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Mr. Tu Kaiyuan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>He is especially well-known in the soccer world. He also likes tennis, but he is not as good at it as he is at soccer. The reporter knew him ten years ago. Now, we meet again in our hometown. We had a long night of pleasant conversation, especially about sports matters. The following is a record of our conversation, which reads as if you are in the middle of it. It is full of interest and details the latest trends in German sports and the activities of students studying in Germany in the sports world. It is full of interest, as if you are on the scene. The following is a written account to introduce the great achievements of our students in the German sports world and to clarify one aspect of recent German sports.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Constant Struggle Leads to Fame <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>When Mr. Tu arrived in Berlin, Germany in 1922, there was a Chinese soccer team organized by students studying in Germany. Yu Bingquan was the captain, and Zhang Yulin and Tu Kaidi (Mr. Tu's elder brother) were important members of the team. Mr. Tu first showed his skills as a goalkeeper. In 1923, Zhang Yulin was the captain, and Tu served as an inside forward. In 1925, Tu was promoted to captain and also served as a center back. From that year until 1927, the team was at its peak and competed with local agricultural, industrial, commercial, and Berlin universities. Although there were wins and losses, the strength was strong and had become an undeniable fact. Unfortunately, in 1928, many of the team's strong players returned home one after another, and the team gradually stopped without support. In early 1923, Mr. Tu joined the SC Charlottenburg soccer team, which had more than 20 years of history. It was one of more than 20 sports associations in Berlin. Soccer was divided into adult, child, and student groups, each with seven teams, for a total of 21 teams. They competed once a week. The association also hired experts to provide training. The training methods were very adaptable, with one type focusing on endurance, such as cross-country running, and another type focusing on short-distance sprinting and various gymnastics. Training was held twice a week in the evening on the green field under electric light, regardless of wind or rain. Different countries have different tactics for soccer. England uses the M formation, the Soviet Union uses short passes, and Germany mostly adopts the English style, with offense and defense complementing each other, and the east, west, left, and right sides never stop for a moment. The center forward and the two wings are stationed in the enemy's camp, ready for impact. The German soccer season is popular all year round except for August. The daily expenses of the sports association rely on the income from soccer and track and field tickets in August. The treatment of players by the sports association is scientific, with no excessive or insufficient bias. After this legitimate training, Mr. Tu became strong and skillful. In 1924, Mr. Tu was promoted from the D team to the C and B teams. In 1925, he was selected to the A team as one of the forwards, opening a new record for Chinese people in the German soccer world. At that time, Mr. Tu also served as the center back of the A team in the school (University of Berlin). From 1926 to 1927, he won the Berlin University Championship for two consecutive years and the National University Championship for two years. In 1928, due to graduation examinations, he rarely participated. From 1929 to 1930, he also served the association in his spare time during his internship. This autumn, he plans to serve his country, and this gentleman's skills will be seen on the green field.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Many Talented People in the Tennis World <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Many students studying in Germany like tennis very much. There are large-scale competitions in spring and autumn, and the skills are improving and talented people are emerging. Mr. Tu is also one of the best among them. According to his account, there is Luo Guangcai from Sichuan, a giant in the German world. His left and right strokes are as he wishes. His high and low shots are powerful and unusual. His future achievements are immeasurable. He once defeated the first-class German talents Wolf and Yaeuicke. These two had defeated the Filipino Aragaon when he visited the country. From this, it can be seen that Luo's skills are superb. At the same time, there is also Liu Jing, whom the French call the Chinese Borotra, one of the four French musketeers. He is good at netsmanship. Liu's fame also comes from his constant activity on the net. Liu once lost to Luo by six to three, five to seven, and four to six. The skills of the two are very close. Last year, there was a Chinese tennis traveling team organized by students studying abroad. The team had six members: Luo Guangcai, Liu Jing, Tu Kaiyuan, Luo Guanggui, Xu Yuanyu, and Zhou Guanjun. They went through five or six cities and won every battle, returning with honors. Generally speaking, the tennis activities of students studying in Germany are on the rise.</p>
<h3 id="e123">German Sports Emphasize Universality <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>German sports emphasize universality. The goal is to develop all the people equally and not to focus on one or two special talents. Therefore, there is no exceptional treatment. Gymnastics has become an important part of every family. Among ball sports, soccer is the most developed, followed by tennis. Basketball and baseball are almost extinct. Track and field is strongly promoted. This is a national hobby that has been cultivated over decades, and there will probably be no major changes in the next ten years.</p>

<p>— Hu Furen</p>
<p>The music of the natural world, like the crowing of roosters, the barking of dogs, the chirping of birds, and the buzzing of insects, is something people in cities can never enjoy.</p>
<p>Humans are the most intelligent of all creatures, and therefore suffer the most pain. Is this the price of intelligence?</p>
<p>The joy of reunion after a long separation is as different from the pain of separation as heaven is from earth.</p>
<p>There is no truly beautiful and virtuous woman in this world, nor is there a truly ugly and evil woman.</p>
<p>In stubborn families, parents-in-law hope that their daughters will have harmonious relationships with their husbands after marriage, but they do not want their own sons to be too attached to their wives. Is this the reason why there are so many troubles in old-fashioned families?</p>
<p>The pain of separation by death is the same as the pain of separation by distance; there is no need to distinguish which is lighter or heavier.</p>
<p>To live is to serve, not to enjoy. If everyone understands this, they can reduce many troubles.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman's heart is not necessarily good, and an ugly woman's heart is not necessarily evil. It is a great mistake for people to judge by appearance.</p>
<p>The coldness and warmth of human relationships and the fickleness of the world are excellent lessons for young people.</p>
<p>People's hearts are different, each with its own face. It is always difficult to find someone who truly understands you among all people.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently wrong in the world; it is fools who create their own troubles. It can be seen that people in this world are the most ominous of all things.</p>
<h3 id="e125">A Record of National Martial Arts <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>When I was a child studying in the county elementary school, there was a tea server named Old Zhang. He was already approaching sixty, but his spirit was vigorous, and he looked like he was only in his forties. During his free time, he liked to tease the students, often instructing them to strike his limbs with bamboo and wooden sticks. Old Zhang would raise his hands to receive the blows without suffering any harm. When he saw us practicing gymnastics, he would say, "This is the new-style boxing technique. However, practitioners only focus on form and not on substance, far inferior to boxing." Occasionally, when asked to demonstrate his skills, he could invert himself and climb a pillar, then slowly curl his body, advancing and retreating like a snake. One night, a thief broke in. Old Zhang, upon awakening, leaped onto the roof, captured the thief, and descended. His body was as light as a swallow. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be his disciple. He scolded him, "I taught you a meager skill, and you use it to become a thief? I am poor and old, yet I am willing to end my days as a servant. You are too unworthy, ruining my reputation!" He then whipped him severely and let him go. Old Zhang soon passed away, and those who knew him mourned him.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaojiu of Huizhou was a famous boxing master, skilled in internal strength, with techniques such as bone contraction and light body, capable of walking on water without wetting his shoes. He had many disciples, all of whom possessed unique skills. His son and grandson were also skilled in martial arts. Unfortunately, his family rules were not strict, so many of his disciples became thieves and bandits. His son was particularly strong and powerful, once visiting various iron shops and bending each instrument with one finger, instilling fear in everyone. Later, he fought with a monk and was killed by the monk's pressure point technique. From then on, his disciples slightly restrained themselves. Those who continued to commit acts of violence were mostly arrested by the authorities. Now, Zhang has long passed away, and his grandson is also over ninety years old, but he is honest, simple, humble, and courteous, not inferior to ancient gentlemen. To practice martial arts is to strengthen the body, and to possess skills is to defend oneself. It is not something to rely on to run rampant in one's village. A single thought can make one a chivalrous hero, and a single thought can harm oneself. I hope those who practice this will take this warning to heart.</p>
<h3 id="e126">A Record of Boating on West Lake Under the Moon <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Die</p>
<p>With Xiao Jian Xunmei, we stepped out of West Lake and planned to buy a boat to float on the Three Pools Reflecting the Moon. The bright moon had just risen, and the water reflected the moonlight, creating a clear and bright expanse. Several small boats came and went in the moonlit water, where even the smallest details were visible. I heard a faint flute sound rising from a boat, then suddenly stopping. Someone called out, "Yang Ziqing's Qing!" So we boarded Qing's boat together. Gazing into the distance, North Mountain and the East Market seemed to sleep under a veil of green gauze. I couldn't see buildings, only the lights reflected on the water, and the lotus leaves were smaller than a goose's eye. A faint fragrance wafted in the wind. Leaning on the oars in the middle of the stream, I played with the bright moon, gazing at the dustless jade palace and leisurely drifting on the golden waves. It was as if I were in a small crystal box, and all worldly realms were gone. Qing said, "This is paintable!" I grabbed a brush to write, but felt that my thoughts were elusive, coming and going without a trace. I felt desolate and empty, wanting to leave but then stopping again. When I returned to record it, it still didn't seem right. For the scenery that everyone in the world can see, not everyone can see it in the moment. When I hold a brush to write this scenery, it is also not necessarily the same as the scenery I saw at that moment. As Gu Foying's poem says, "Looking at the mountain and writing poetry are actually unrelated. If you happen to get a good line, it's not necessarily the true essence of the mountain, but it has captured my heart."</p>

<p>— Wan Cheng</p>
<p>The other day, the Commercial Press held a joyful banquet at Yizhixiang for the delegation from the Eastern Provinces Special Zone and the principals and teachers of secondary schools from various regions who led students to Shanghai for a visit. During the banquet, Chairman He Bingsong invited Ms. Yu Shiru, the principal of Xuzhou Girls' Middle School, to speak.</p>
<p>Ms. Yu first described the general situation of girls' education in Xuzhou, then spoke about the character and physical appearance of Xuzhou women. She said that Xuzhou women were straightforward, loyal, and steadfast in character, but their physical appearance was rougher, darker, and fatter than that of southern women.</p>
<p>Ms. Yu's pronunciation was clear, and her words were concise and to the point. She is truly an outstanding talent in the women's world.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Exquisite Anecdotes of Jade Rice <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"Food is the first necessity of the people" is a famous saying of our ancestors. Steaming grains into rice began with the Yellow Emperor, as seen in the "Jijia Zhou Shu." Since then, it has been passed down to this day without interruption. Rice grains are divided into japonica and glutinous rice. Farmers sell them to shops, and the shops always grind, roll, and mix them with polishing powder, employing various outdated methods that cannot be broken. My friend, Mr. Zhang Erxin, a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Soochow University, has discovered through research that rice naturally contains acidity. The more external the layer, the stronger the acidic reaction, and the most abundant the vitamins. Grinding and rolling will lose its vitality and digestive aids, and mixing with polishing powder will make it impure and difficult to clean, which is harmful to the stomach and intestines. Therefore, Mr. Zhang has invented a kind of healthy rice using scientific methods. Under the guidance of Dr. Xue Wenyi, a medical doctor from the University, and Mr. Yuan Pilie, a Master of Engineering from Cornell University, who is responsible for the manufacturing, a shop has been established on Heng Street in Fengmen, Suzhou, with a sign that reads "Wanyuan," providing healthy rice to meet the needs of society. This rice retains its original color, and can be cooked and eaten without washing, and its swelling properties are extremely strong. It can also treat beriberi, stomach ailments, and physical weakness. Recently, a public demonstration was held at the Free Farmers' Market, where County Magistrate Huang Yunzhen personally delivered a wonderful speech, briefly stating that eating healthy rice simply means encouraging people to eat more bran and chaff, but it should not be misunderstood as teaching people to be pigs. Although healthy rice contains bran and chaff, it is not coarse and is very palatable. The listeners laughed heartily. Mr. Fei Shuwe, a famous pedantic recluse in Suzhou, never eats rice from the market and specially entrusts villagers to buy rice that is pounded using traditional methods, taking the unhusked grain. When eating, he mixes it with bran and cooks it. Now that he has obtained healthy rice and tried cooking and eating it, he praises it endlessly, saying that it has the merits of color, aroma, and taste all in one.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Barber Competition <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Lin</p>
<p>Recently, a barber competition was held in central New York. As a result, Bao'er Dase of Courtland Village defeated Manchu of Waterloo Village. However, Manchu was not convinced because he was already a sixty-six-year-old barber, so he recently wrote a letter to Bao'er Daseller, thirty-nine years old, requesting a second competition with him.</p>
<p>The conditions are that this competition will have a quota of thirty heads, ten heads will be cut using electric clippers, ten heads will be cut using ordinary hand-held clippers, and the last ten heads will be limited to using scissors. Furthermore, no one is allowed to stand within six feet of the barber chair during the competition to avoid hindering movement. The judges must be unrelated to the competitors either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>According to Manchu himself, the reason for his last failure was entirely because the electric clippers were not working smoothly when cutting the first head. As for the hand-held clippers, he has been using them for forty-eight years, so of course he is very skilled.</p>
<p>Manchu mostly used scissors to cut, occasionally switching to hand-held clippers. As a result, Manchu shaved nineteen heads in one hour, fifty-one minutes, and five seconds, while Bao'er Dase cut twenty-three heads.</p>
<p>Speaking of records, Manchu's fastest time for a male head is two minutes and thirty-five seconds, while Bao'er Dase's is two minutes and fifty seconds. As for a female head, he only needs three minutes, while Bao'er Dase's fastest time is four minutes and thirteen seconds. No wonder the old man refuses to accept defeat.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Tragedy <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>Once, I visited a nunnery in Wumen and saw a young nun participating in the Dharma seat. The sound of the bells and chimes evoked a strange feeling in me. I thought that she must have unspeakable hidden pain, so she sought the door of silence and extinction. Later, the old nun told me that she was actually the daughter of a prominent family in Yushan. Due to a momentary error, she was seduced by a wild man, and after experiencing hardship, she eventually fell into disgrace and was expelled from her family and rejected by her hometown. So she came here to shave her head and repent. When the old nun spoke, the young nun also faintly heard it, and tears filled her eyes, as if her sad and resentful thoughts were stirred up. I couldn't bear it and hurriedly left, feeling dejected. Afterwards, whenever I passed this nunnery, it seemed as if an unfinished tragedy was still intermittently reflected in my mind, causing me to feel sad and unable to stop myself.</p>
<p>Later, I came to Shanghai and became quite fond of movies. I never liked Clara Bow and others who advocated licentiousness, but I was particularly moved by Lilyan Tashman's sadness. From the film "Self-Made Wife" to "The Vengeance," I was deeply touched. The characters played by Lilyan were often ill-fated women. Their origins were bitter ("The Love Thief"), and their endings were desolate ("The Lone Wolf's Daughter"). I thought of the young nun in Wuxia. If I were to write a script and have Lilyan perform it, it would surely make all the sentimental people in the world cry together.</p>
<p>In domestic films, there are not many tragedies with power. However, I was deeply surprised by the depth of feeling in the Tianyi Film Company's "Tears of the Empty Door." The changes in the plot and the strangeness of the background seem to put the viewer in the snow and sea of the Arctic Ocean. Although frightened and horrified, one cannot help but feel a sense of desolation. Chen Yumei's performance as the protagonist is particularly outstanding. Her tears fall like pearls, and her sorrow is profound. I would like to call her the Lilyan Tashman of the East. The result of the film's events is reminiscent of what I saw in the nunnery in Wuxia, which makes me feel that the situation is real and the power to move people is even deeper. In ancient times, people who sold laughter for a thousand pieces of gold were foolish. In the vast world, only genuine tears are precious.</p>
<h3 id="e131">A Trip Around the Yellow Sea (26) <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>So, what should we do then? Let me offer some suggestions, but first, I want to clarify that my words are addressed to the average Chinese person, not to a specific person or group.</p>
<p>First, build up your physical fitness. This is the root of everything. I can honestly say that every time I return to my country from abroad, the biggest shock is the sight of our compatriots coming and going on the streets. Half of them look like ghosts! How can they be compared with the people of any other country? Living a life of peace for ten thousand days at most allows people to ridicule you, which is not a big deal. But when the country is in trouble and lives are at stake, those who have been trained and those who have not are vastly different. Thinking of this, I want to say that the greatest enemy of our country for ten thousand years is opium, and the greatest sinners are those who profit from opium from top to bottom. These people are not only the harbingers of national demise, but also the executioners of our race.</p>
<p>Speaking of building up physical fitness, how should we proceed? Everyone must practice individually, and every region must practice. The government must also establish a policy and formulate various laws and regulations to ensure that the whole country makes continuous efforts at the same time. This is not just about training a few athletes to show off at sports meets. We should focus on universal and basic physical training. Look at Japan, where every school has kendo and judo for their students, but absolutely none for Korean students. On the one hand, they emphasize basic training, and on the other hand, they don't want them to train. Which side do we Chinese people want to learn from? What kind of methods does our government use to treat our own young men and women?</p>
<p>Second, firmly believe in science. For more than a hundred years, the opening up of the mysteries of the universe, the expansion of the effectiveness of all things, and the improvement of human life have all been due to science. If the world had no ships, trains, airplanes, telegraphs, telephones, electricity, various machines, as well as guns, ammunition, submarines, tanks, etc., how much different would Europe and the United States be from us, and where would the great powers' strength lie? We must not think that other people's inventions and creations allow us to "sit back and enjoy the benefits." We can travel on other people's ships on the sea and communicate through other people's wires under the sea. We must know that for the past fifty years, tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed out of the country, leaving the people poor and the country depleted, all because of the idea of "sitting back and enjoying the benefits."</p>
<p>Speaking Society</p>
<h3 id="e132">Three Eras (1) <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(1) Under the Baton</p>
<p>Nongshangbu Street was a relatively neat alley. A row of tall locust trees with lush green foliage lined the stone-paved road, reflecting the white-plastered walls of the houses on both sides. The green was green, and the white was white, which was really pleasing to the eye. The sun was shining directly on the treetops, scattering a green shade all over the ground. A hawker selling sour plum soup was resting in the shade. In front was a wooden tray with many small bowls, supporting an enamel basin filled with ice cubes. Behind was a wooden bucket filled with a jar of sour plum soup. In the middle was a carrying pole. The hawker selling sour plum soup held it, first saying, "Drink it!" Then he started singing, "Osmanthus sugar is added a lot, sweet and delicious to drink!" After singing, he added, "Drink it!" Zhang Xiaosan, a rickshaw puller, had just pulled a long trip from the east city and earned fifty cents. He dragged the rickshaw with his right hand and used a blue cloth towel in his left hand to wipe the sweat from his head, slowly walking in the shade of the trees. He heard the hawker selling sour plum soup shouting and looked at the sparkling water blocks in the basin. He felt a coolness drill into his throat. He couldn't help but put down the rickshaw and asked, "One cent for two bowls? Give me a big scoop with more ice!" The hawker selling sour plum soup didn't say a word, took a small bowl, and opened the lid of the jar, using a wine scoop to scoop two scoops of sour plum soup. He grabbed a few pieces of crushed ice and put them in the bowl. Zhang Xiaosan said, "More, more!" The hawker selling sour plum soup glanced at him and smiled faintly, "More ice is also money, bought it." He put the bowl on the wooden tray. Zhang Xiaosan picked up the small bowl and gulped it down in two sounds without taking a breath, drinking the sour plum soup clean. Only a few small pieces of ice were left at the bottom of the bowl. He simply poured the ice into his mouth, chewing it like beans, and handed the bowl to the hawker selling sour plum soup to scoop again. He drank until the third bowl when a big red door opened on the south side of the road, and a boy of seven or eight years old and a lady in her twenties came out, probably to look at the street.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Financial and Gold Markets Confused and Uncertain <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Today's forward predictions are low. Yesterday's gold price fluctuated slightly, creating a confusing situation. The early market rose and fell by four or five taels, then hovered around 800 taels. The afternoon situation was also hesitant, with a difference of six or seven taels throughout. The result was a draw. The silver market continued to rise, opening low. There was no major glory or disgrace in the foreign exchange market. Brokers and speculators had no large-scale transactions. People's minds were confused, but the price would not fall sharply for a while, and there was still some room for maneuvering. This morning's forward predictions are low, etc.</p>
<p>Fluctuating around 800 taels. The July opening price in the morning fell by 2 taels to 797 taels, because the big bars rose again by one-sixteenth. The public and private telegrams showed an increase of one-eighth in the silver price. Later, Chunyuan Yong, Tong Taichang, Yongfeng, and Zailianbang all sold. Consequently, it fell from 98 taels to 95.6 qian. The exchange market was flat. Then, HSBC ate British gold at 3125, and Mitsui ate American gold at 29 yuan. Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Maoyong, Hengyu, Yuanchun, Yuan Xingyong, etc., bought, and suddenly a high image appeared. At 9:20 AM, it was 800 taels and 008 qian. Soon after, Yuanheng and others sold, suppressing it by 2 taels to 98.6 qian. The first bulletin showed no change at 99.2 qian. Then it was reduced by 1 tael and 12 qian. Then, Yuanheng, Wanxing, Chunyuan Yong, Shunli, etc., came in, and Mitsui bought 1.7 qian and 0.375 for July Dalian, so it rose by more than 4 taels to 802 taels and 3 qian at 10:00 AM. At 11:15 AM, there was another sign of weakness. The British gold could be settled at 25. Zailianbang, Hongli, Yuan Xingyong, Tianfeng Yong, etc., all sold, so the price gradually fell by more than 4 taels, breaking the 800 tael mark again, to 797 taels and 6 qian at 10:50 AM. At that time, Senchang Yong, Bingxing, etc., bought, pulling it up by 3 taels to 800 taels and 005 qian after more than 10 minutes. Suddenly, it fell by 2 or 3 taels. Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu, and Yuanchun came to sell at 11:30 AM for 97.78 qian. Then it rose slightly by more than 1 tael to the 800 tael mark, but Yuan Xingyong, Yuan Maoyong, goods, etc., sold, so the noon closing was 98.8 qian. The results were suppressed to about 8 taels, and the opening price was still 838 taels and 2 qian, which was about 40 taels.</p>
<p>After the market closed, it rose slightly. The after-market opened at 97.5 qian, the remaining momentum after noon, but it was small. Then, because the Indian exchange rate was reported to be small, it rose to 98.9 qian. At that time, it depreciated by 1 tael and 34 qian, and then turned upwards, probably because Chengfeng Yong, Fuyu, and Mr. Wu took action, so it was pushed up by 4 taels to 801 taels and 3 qian at 2:50 PM. However, the British gold, etc., was flat. There was profit and loss between Huabi. Next month, it will be 25 to 3125. After 3:00 PM, it stepped downward, because Yongheng, Yuan Xingyong, Qian Changxiang, Zhen Changxiang, Fu Taiheng, and Yuan Tai, etc., all sold, so it fell by more than 4 taels. British gold can be settled at 25 or 3125. People's hearts were frustrated, and it was heard that the Indian exchange rate returned to a big anna. It was 96.8 qian at 4:15 PM. After a while, Maoyong, Yuanheng, and Guangbang, etc., came to move in, and immediately pulled it up by 2 taels, but there was no large transaction. By the time the market closed at 4:30 PM, it was 98.7 qian, which was only a decrease of 3 qian compared to the previous day. However, after the market closed, it rose to more than 99 taels. According to the largest price of the day, 802 taels and 3 qian, and the smallest price, 795 taels and 6 qian, there was 6.7 qian. Looking back, the fluctuations were difficult to suppress. The goods were 7 taels in the morning market, 7 taels and 5 in the noon closing, 7 taels and 7 in the afternoon, and 8 taels and 8 qian in the closing market. The opening price was about 40 taels, and the final count was 39 taels. The account was 99 taels, and the water was 97 taels. In the afternoon,</p>
<p>Dalianbang's demand was greater than supply. The number of transactions for each number was Zhifeng Yong Cuichang Yong, Xinheng, Yuantai, and goods all came in. Wanxing Tong Taichang and Yuan Xingyong generally came in more than they went out. Wang Qian Changxiang, Shunli, Hongli, Yongfeng, Fuyu, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Kangxiang, and Yu Da generally came out. In the afternoon, Chengfeng Yong,</p>
<p>Bingxing, Fuyu, Yuanheng, Yuan Kangxiang, Yuan Maoyong, Shengda, and Zhifeng Yong all came in. Wanxing, Shunli, and Yuantai's ins and outs were chaotic. Fu Taiheng, Yuan Xingyong, and Yongfeng all came out. Daxing Yong, Hengyu, and Senchang Yong sometimes</p>
<p>Had deposits and withdrawals. Dalianbang had a total of 3,000 transactions. Generally, the demand was greater than the supply. Speculator Mr. Wu came in slightly. Guangbang only came in 200 or 300 transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Situation Becomes Isolated <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market situation presents an isolated state, with no distinction between honor and disgrace. The market atmosphere is extremely despondent, but the overseas cotton yarn situation is very weak, so most retail investors are selling short. However, due to the tightening of exchange rates and the still high silver parity calculated for foreign market prices, export transactions are still ongoing. Therefore, although the environment is harsh, there are fewer sellers, and the recent purchase of about 30,000 to 40,000 bales of base goods by various merchant groups can alleviate the situation somewhat. In summary, there is still a stock of coarse yarn, and the situation is still unsettled, so operators are relatively cautious, and there are temporary fears of not breaking free from the current situation.  There are no major changes in the Manchukuo Standard cotton market.  The opening price of the Manchukuo Standard cotton market in the morning saw a slight increase in US cotton and no drop in gold prices, so the market atmosphere was still calm. There were very few transactions in the market, with slight increases of one, two, or three cash units in each month. The afternoon market situation was very calm, with increases or decreases of one or two cash units. The total transaction volume for the day was only 8,300 bales. It was found that Da Changcheng sold 900 bales, Gengfeng 550 bales, and Heshen 450 bales. Dafu bought 500 bales, Yiyu 550 bales, and Deyi 700 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The current yarn sales are still stable. It was found that the total purchase by various merchant groups for the day was 1,400 bales, with 200 bales being traded among peers. The market was average. Among the customer groups, Guangdong purchased 800 bales, Xuzhou 60 bales, Shantou 210 bales, inland 100 bales, Wenzhou 25 bales, and miscellaneous groups 150 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Cotton Market is Relatively Stable <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is relatively firm due to a slight increase in US cotton and a stable exchange rate. Although sellers are bearish, there is a significant shortage of incoming goods from various sources, and there are few large-scale sellers. Therefore, the market situation presents a difficult situation of both rising and falling prices, with daily transaction volume decreasing. The future is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard cotton is slightly better by one or two cash units. The Hankou Standard cotton market opened in the morning with no increase in gold prices and a slight increase in foreign cotton prices. Each month increased by one or two cash units. The afternoon was average, with another increase of half a cash unit. The transaction volume was 16,000 dan. It was found that Gongtai sold 1,300 dan, Xie Sheng 1,300 dan, and Shenda 900 dan. Shen Ji bought 2,400 dan, Dafeng 700 dan, and Changfeng 600 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>U.S. Cotton Short Covering. Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to poor news from Liverpool, but later strengthened due to short covering and purchases by industry players. Futures rose 7-11 points, and spot prices rose 10 points. British cotton futures fell 10-11 points, and spot prices fell 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 30 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to many settlements required and sales by brokers, but later rebounded slightly due to some short covering and purchases by Japanese and European exporters. Ping Guo Er fell 3 rupees, Omu La fell 4 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi fell 5 rupees. Original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 8th).</p>

<p>A report from Bombay on the 6th stated that the cotton market during the week saw futures hedging transactions only decrease by 11 rupees, but Liverpool prices fell by 32 points. The quantity of cotton fields is expected to decrease, so new cotton is quite strong. If U.S. cotton can exceed its price ratio with Indian cotton, then local factories will take U.S. cotton instead. Currently, the remaining Indian cotton stocks are exhausted, and rolling stocks are even smaller. Bombay's raw cotton exports as of May 31 have increased by 80,000 bales compared to the same period last year. Spot transactions for the week ending May 29 totaled 16,000 bales sold to Japan.</p>

<p>At Xinzha yesterday, rice shipments from various groups in the northern Shanghai market were still surging, totaling thirty to forty ships. Sales in this street were extremely stagnant. Both high-quality and second-quality japonica rice fell by 0.2 yuan. Buying interest was extremely quiet. Market sentiment was generally loosening, so the situation was quite thin. Although there was not much early-season rice, its consumption was very sluggish, and prices also fell. Due to the abundance of japonica rice, imported round-grain rice was weak, falling by 0.1 yuan. Baopu round-grain rice was stagnant and did not move, with no distinction between honor and disgrace. For glutinous rice, the top grade from the old mortar was visibly weak but invisibly weakened. Discounts below the middle grade were significant enough. Liquor merchants' sales were unsatisfactory. There were about two hundred ships stored in the lower river area, totaling about thirty thousand stones of rice.</p>
<p>In the southern Shanghai rice market, the number of people at the early morning market was sparse. Top-grade rice from Changshu and Wuxi was stable. Ordinary middle-grade rice fell by 0.2 yuan. Sales of high-quality japonica rice from Suzhou, Tongzhou, Pinghu, and Lihai became even more sluggish, falling by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Shipments of early-season rice from Nangang, Qingjiao, Songjiang, Fengxian, etc., arrived in abundance, but sales were stagnant, and there was still inventory. Opening prices for each product were lower by one to two tenths of a yuan. Zero sales of imported round-grain rice from Ye Xie and Zhang Yan were still acceptable, with an average situation turning weak. Sales of parboiled rice were slightly brisk, with tea and snack shops showing slight movement and a stable situation. There were about thirty ships arriving on the inner road, with each cargo totaling three to four hundred dan.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Tapioca Market is Extremely Quiet in the After-hours Market <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the tapioca market in the morning, market prices for each month fell due to quotations for unmilled wheat also falling by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The weather was still good, so some people's sentiment was extremely weak. The lowest price for the current month was 2.0975 taels, and for July it was 2.0925 taels, continuing to fall by more than 0.01 tael compared to the previous day's closing price. However, after two rounds of trading, the market stabilized again due to urgent short covering by outside operators. By the time of the afternoon opening, trading was very quiet, and the market atmosphere for each month was also hovering. In terms of this year's new wheat, the market must fall a little bit, because the large harvest in the north will inevitably reduce demand thereafter. However, local sentiment will not immediately relax. As a result, the current month was down by 0.005 tael compared to the previous day, August was down by 0.0025 tael, September was unchanged, October was down by 0.0025 tael, and November was down by 0.025 tael.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Near-Term Wheat Futures Decline, Far-Term Slightly More Popular <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market in the morning, the market for each month showed a near-term decline and average performance. The market atmosphere for June and July was extremely sluggish due to the return of long positions, and once both were at the 4 tael mark. The far-term was relatively stable due to few buyers and sellers. By the time of the afternoon opening, the near-term was still weak, but then it was speculated that the time of high prices was approaching due to the foggy weather, so sentiment neglected the good and recovered by two or three points compared to the lowest price. As a result, the current month was down 0.01 tael compared to the previous day, while the other months were slightly better by 0.01 tael. The situation for new wheat is that the sources are gradually smooth, but factories are mutually rejecting and unwilling to rush to handle it, so although 4,000 bales of Nanjing wheat have been opened, they have not yet been allocated to factories.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Customer Xiang Rice Sales are Stagnant and Seen as Weak <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xiang rice market situation was unusually quiet. Because this garrison had shipments of rice from the lower river area, there was no intention to buy, and the owners were unwilling to lower prices for sale. Therefore, there were no transactions throughout the day. The foreign rice market also looked smaller, because a lot had arrived in recent days and had not yet been sold. There were still arrivals today, and people's hearts were looking at smaller prices. However, because gold prices were expensive, it was difficult to calculate, so the owners were also unwilling to easily sell.</p>

<p>An average of 600 catties is needed... cocoon cost is over 700 taels. This year, the spring silkworms in various cities and villages of Jiangning suffered from the damage of the weather. The early silkworms were completely lost, and the late silkworms also had a large crop failure due to the cold and rainy weather. The overall harvest is only about 30% of a normal year. Foreign variety cocoons are better, and local cocoons have thin skin and many defective cocoons. Newly dried cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai for baking, and the processing loss is 300 catties. The result of test reeling is that the maximum reeling loss is 650 catties (local cocoons) and the minimum is 550 catties (foreign cocoons). An average of 600 catties is needed. Silk factories get 58 yuan per dan of dried cocoons, and the net cost of the cocoons is 760-770 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port continued to be calm and firm because US sales were stagnant. Telegrams from New York factories showed no transfers to Shanghai. Actual sales in Lyon were also sluggish. Only British and French silk merchants slightly covered short positions yesterday. Only Taihe and others shipped 30 bales of white factory silk to Shanghai, and Kaili and others shipped 20 bales of yellow factory silk to Shanghai. Prices remain stable.</p>

<p>Tunxi Zhenmei black tea has suddenly become sluggish in recent days. Chinese tea merchants are firm and soft, and the situation is unusually chaotic. Yesterday, the Shanghai market price for ordinary Tun Zhuang Zhenmei black tea bought by Xie He Foreign Firm had already opened at 135 taels, a sharp drop of 50 to 60 taels compared to the average cargo price. At this critical moment for the launch of new tea, the sharp decline in tea prices has had a major impact on green teas from all over the country. Currently, the prices of raw tea in the producing areas are rising due to shortages, but sales in the Shanghai market are stagnant, and the sharp drop in market prices makes it difficult to see a positive future. British sales of Qixiao red tea and Yuhua Xiang were smooth, but the rest were also stagnant.</p>

<p>In addition to various firms competing to source the first batch of new tea in the four rural townships of Wuyuan, the second and third batches have also begun to be actively sourced because the tea quota has not been filled. In recent days, those opening scales in various villages include Yan Tian, Jia Dao, Ma Zha Pan, Chi Dong Keng, etc. in the western township, with prices ranging from 36 to 40 yuan; Qing Hua, Zheng Xi, Fu Xi Kou, Jia Cun, Wu Cun, Che Tian, Wang Ling Xia, Shui Lu, Yuan Kou, Gu Tan, etc. in the northern township, with prices ranging from 40 to 56 yuan; Cang Jia Tian, Hu Jia Yan, Sha Tan, etc. in the Hongyuan area, with prices ranging from 40 to 42-43 yuan; and prices ranging from 60 to 72 yuan in the eastern township, and from 35 to 42 yuan in the southern township along the Tai Bai Yu Tan area. According to tea merchants, about 80% of the tea opening scales in the four townships have been traded, and only about 20% have not been opened. With the urgent need for tea to meet the tastes of customers, the market situation is already in short supply. The firms that have not sourced much tea all hope that the seeds tea will be abundant in the new harvest to make up for the shortage.</p>

<p>The Market is Quiet and Firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegrams indicated that the current price of Cuban sugar was still unchanged compared to the previous telegram.

<h3 id="e155">The Huangpu Iron Bridge Problem <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The draft contract and explanatory statement have been submitted to the Municipal Government. The Huangpu Iron Bridge is being prepared by Yao Jizhong, Xu Qingwen, Gong Zhengfang, etc. to promote public welfare as a people-owned public undertaking, which will substantially assist the development of the Shanghai Municipal Government's transportation and commerce. Key central figures Zhang Jingjiang and Shanghai's business community Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Wang Binyan, Du Yuesheng, Yuan Ludeng, etc. have all provided support. However, the progress of the construction has not been active in recent months. In order to show concern for municipal construction, a reporter from the New Voice Society visited Yao Jizhong, one of the bridge's initiators. As Yao was out on business, the reporter instead visited Gong Zhengfang to inquire about the bridge's construction plans and progress. According to Gong, the reason for planning to build this bridge was purely for the purpose of municipal transportation to meet the needs of the development of the Pudong City. Therefore, Yao was extremely enthusiastic about this planning. He signed a draft contract with the German Meng Aen Bridge Company on February 27. As Yao considered this matter to be of great importance, he has not yet submitted this draft contract to the Municipal Government for approval. Now that the National Congress has resolved that the state has a policy to encourage people-owned public works, it has now been decided to actively proceed. Yesterday, the contract was submitted to the Municipal Government for review. The original document is as follows:</p>
<p>Draft Contract: This contract was signed on February 16, the 20th year of the Republic of China, in Shanghai. The two signing parties are Yao Jizhong, Xu Qingwen, Shen Yuren, hereinafter referred to as the conveners, and the China branch of the German Meng Aen Company, hereinafter referred to as the company. Now that the conveners intend to build a steel pontoon bridge across the Huangpu River, passing through Dongjiadu in Nantou, Shanghai City, to Dongjiadu in Pudong, the company is willing to build the bridge and provide all materials.

(3) The outstanding amount of this bridge price shall be subject to an annual interest rate of 8%, calculated from the date of handover of the bridge to the conveners. (4) The conveners shall fulfill the guarantee agreed upon in Article 2 of this clause by a bank approved by the company (Supplementary Items) If the company fails to complete the construction within the stipulated time in the contract, except for matters related to Article 1, Item 3, it shall compensate for the loss, and the conveners may reduce the price by 2%.

<h3 id="e156">The Yangtze River Shipping Industry is in a Slump <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Lack of Imports and Exports</p>
<p>The Yangtze River shipping industry can now be said to have declined to the extreme, with a lack of imports and exports and the suspension of Chinese steamships. Yesterday, a reporter met with a key figure in the shipping industry who told the truth about the decline. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi Goods Blocked: Since the Communist Party’s disturbances in Jiangxi, only two or so of the province’s eighty-one counties have been spared from the bandit disaster. The transportation of goods along the Nanxun Road has recently been commandeered by the army to suppress bandits, causing small boats and barges in the inland rivers to be used for official purposes. This has caused the accumulation of goods in Ganzhou without ships to transport them, which has prevented the largest exports of summer cloth, porcelain, paper, miscellaneous grains, etc. from being transported out. The purchasing power of society has weakened and there are fewer goods going to Shanghai. Jiujiang Port, which used to be the number one port for Yangtze River freight transport, now has no cargo on both incoming and outgoing ships.</p>
<p>Dageng Tungsten Halts: The Dagengling tungsten mine in Jiangxi Province is world-renowned. The amount of this mineral sand purchased and exported by Britain, Germany, and other countries each year is often 200,000 to 300,000 tons, with each ton worth 300 to 400 yuan, which is a great source of profit for Jiangxi Province. It has not been restored since it was suspended by bandits last year. Dageng has already been recovered by the National Army, but the miners have not yet been gathered to mine. As a result, not a single bag of tungsten ore has been shipped out this year.</p>
<p>Hunan and Hubei Goods are Severely Lacking: Since the Pinghan Railway has been opened to traffic, goods have accumulated along the line due to a lack of cars and obstructions. Other large commodities have not been able to be transported. Shaanxi and Gansu goods have been diverted to the Longhai Railway and shipped by Haizhou ships. In Hunan Province, the Xiangxi waterway is still completely impassable, resulting in no incoming goods. It can be said that the upstream shipping industry is hopeless. Only Anhui tea in the downstream is slightly transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Seagoing Vessels Travel the Yangtze River: Many Chinese river boats have been off duty since May 17. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company temporarily transferred the seagoing vessel "Fairness" to travel the Yangtze River to meet the needs of passengers. The vast ships that have been idle for a long time can be dispatched to travel the Yangtze River during this flood season to recover the lost freight. It can also resist the increase in foreign ships. The ship's workers will make a request.</p>
<p>British Merchants Increase New Ships: Two new Yangtze River ships ordered by Taikoo Dockyard last year are new types of fast ships with diesel engines. One is called Wuhu, which has already set sail, and the other is called Wuxue, which has also been completed. It has a deadweight of 2,938 tons. Taking advantage of the time when Chinese ships are all stopped, it has been telegraphed to Shanghai to formally</p>
<h3 id="e157">Yesterday Afternoon, National Products Emporium Sealed Off <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Amusement Section Issue</p>
<p>The Bureau of Works Considers it Disobedience</p>
<p>Gongshang She Says the China National Products United Emporium Shut Down After Relocating from Freedom City Hall to New World for Over Half a Month; Yesterday Afternoon, it Suddenly Ceased Operations, Leading to Various Rumors. A Reporter from Gongshang She Believing This Matter Greatly Impacts the Future of National Products, Personally Investigated and Learned the Facts Were Due to a Misunderstanding. The Interview Details Are Recorded Below:</p>
<p>Reason for Closure: After the emporium took over the entire New World building, it used a portion of Freedom Hall as the emporium, with the rest remaining as the amusement section. However, according to the Bureau of Works regulations, amusement venues require a license. Since the emporium had changed its name and management, the previous New World license was no longer valid, and the emporium was instructed to obtain a new license. The emporium complied, but due to certain internal facilities not meeting the regulations, personnel from the Bureau of Works' Engineering and Sanitation departments inspected the premises and informed the emporium manager that improvements must be made within one week. Only after a re-inspection confirming the improvements would the license be issued. After one week, inspectors found the improvements still incomplete and granted a final extension of forty-eight hours. Yesterday, three days past the forty-eight-hour deadline, the required improvements remained unfinished. The Bureau of Works considered this intentional defiance and ordered the responsible police station to send officers to enforce closure. This is the reason for the emporium's closure.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Closure: Around 2 PM yesterday, the responsible police station dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to execute the order. Manager Zhang Zilian and others were in Pudong participating in the Du Ancestral Hall ceremony, and no one was available to liaise. The detectives immediately ordered the iron gates closed, ceasing operations. Several hundred people had already purchased tickets and entered. To maintain credibility, the emporium continued with various amusements until 6 PM when it closed, and visitors were released through a side door. Some visitors inside were unaware the gates had been closed.</p>
<p>Merchants' Meeting: The participating merchants in the emporium originally had a united association. Upon witnessing the situation, they convened an emergency meeting. They collectively believed the emporium and amusement section were separate entities and questioned who would bear the responsibility for the emporium's losses due to the amusement section's lack of a license. A decision was made to send representatives to negotiate with the general office to minimize losses for the merchants.</p>
<p>Emporium Notice: Around 5 PM, a notice was posted at the emporium entrance, stating: "(This emporium is operating as usual but was unexpectedly sealed off by the police station this afternoon at 3 PM without cause. Serious negotiations are underway. Special announcement.)" As of the time of this report, the issue remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Emporium Announcement: China National Products United Emporium Urgent Announcement: Our emporium moved from Nanjing Road to No. 4 Jing'an Temple Road on May 5th and has been operating as usual. Unexpectedly, on June 9th at 3 PM, the British Concession police station sent officers to order a shutdown, sealing all doors of the emporium and deploying officers to monitor and prevent entry and exit. (Omission) Apart from separately telegraphing the Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiations, and telegraphing various provincial and municipal party headquarters, governments, chambers of commerce, and agricultural, labor, and student groups, taxpayer Chinese associations, etc., for united assistance, this is a special announcement.</p>

<p>Claims to Remain Optimistic About the International Silver Conference</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Pittman, after arriving in Shanghai, has been extremely busy for days, researching silver market issues with key figures in the Chinese government and bankers. Senator Pittman and his wife departed Shanghai for Beiping yesterday. Before leaving, he declared that he remains very optimistic about convening an international silver conference.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that U.S. Senator Pittman will depart for Beiping today (9th) to investigate the silver market in North China. Last night, he told someone that the hopes for an international silver conference remain good. The informal meeting proposed by Senator Smoot is definitely out of the question, as such a meeting would be no more effective than an international chamber of commerce. He received a private telegram from Washington stating that the possibility of an international silver conference has greatly increased in recent days. He believes that the U.S. President personally supports this initiative and that the need for this conference was publicly acknowledged in the decision on the 15th of last month. However, because certain countries with significant interests in the silver issue are unwilling to participate, the U.S. has declared its unwillingness to initiate it. Mr. Pittman visited the Shanghai Mint yesterday, calling it the best he has ever seen.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Land in the City Center Will Soon Be Available for Claiming <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Five Features of the Land Available for Claiming</p>
<p>To promote the prosperity of the city center area and encourage citizens to engage in construction in the area, the municipal government has decided to make available one of the most valuable parts of the land it has acquired. The area is bounded by Sanmin Road to the north, Xiangyin Road to the south, Songhu Road to the east, and the city center administrative area to the west, totaling approximately 800 mu. It will be offered at the original cost, without markup, only adding a proportionate share of the road construction and other construction costs. It is divided into two grades, Grade A at 2,500 yuan per mu and Grade B at 2,000 yuan. The location is quiet and convenient for transportation, making it very suitable for commercial and residential use. The Land Bureau has announced that the period from June 21st to July 20th will be the:</p>
<p>Priority return period for original landowners. After July 20th, the official claiming period will begin, and anyone can go to claim land. The procedures are extremely simple. Here are some of the features of this claiming offer: (1) Excellent Location: The center of this offering is a large park with an area of over 300 mu. The terrain is flat, and the air is fresh. Once landscaped, the surrounding area will easily become the most beautiful residential area in the city. To the east is the city center administrative area, where all agencies and public buildings are concentrated, adding to its appeal. (2) Convenient Transportation: Xiangyin Road is an important thoroughfare from Jungong Road to Jiangwan. The land available for claiming is located next to this road. Newly built roads include Qimei Road, Songhu Road, Sanmin Road, etc. Previously, travel from Shanghai mainly followed the West Sports Club Road. With the completion of Qimei Road, this is now the only shortcut. Currently, public buses run on both West Sports Club Road and Xiangyin Road, making transportation very convenient. People in Shanghai who are unfamiliar with the city center area believe it must be very far from the city. However, in reality, the distance from the Bund on Nanjing Road in the public concession to Fanwangdu Park is the same as the distance from the Bund to the city center area. Therefore, even in terms of distance from the current market, its location is exceptionally convenient. (3) Low Land Prices: Currently, land prices in the Jiangwan Xiangyin Road area average 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per mu, and the roads are still cinder roads, the drainage facilities are still incomplete, and the supply of water and electricity is the same. Now, the land price for the land that the municipal government is claiming includes the road and drainage construction costs. Grade A land costs only 2,500 yuan per mu, and Grade B land costs only 2,000 yuan per mu. The municipal government will use all the land prices collected in the shortest period of time to build the area's drainage system, asphalt roads, and other facilities. Consider that the price of land next to a cinder road with no facilities already requires 1,200 to 1,300 yuan. Now, the land price per mu next to a fully equipped asphalt road is only 2,000 to 2,500 yuan. Is this not extremely low? (4) Favorable Measures: The low land prices available for claiming have already been described. In addition, there are regulations to exempt house taxes and transfer taxes within three years. It is also well known that the general public mentality is largely unwilling to make large-scale investments in places where land prices are low. Therefore, 10% (residential area) to 20% (commercial area) is used to show flexibility. The City Works Bureau has also offered prizes to solicit house designs, selecting the best of several types and publishing them as a collection for citizens to use as a reference for construction. (5) Comprehensive Facilities: The roads within this claiming area are generally planned to be built with asphalt surfaces, with drainage ditches below to facilitate the discharge of rainwater and sewage. Maintaining quietness within the residential area is the top priority, reducing the passage of vehicles and planting more trees to make the entire area a park. Currently, there is an electric line set up by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company on Songhu Road, and there is also a water pipe of the company under the road. In the future, it will be very convenient to build roads in this area and connect the pipes. At the corner of Songhu Road and Xiangyin Road, the municipal government also plans to build a police station to maintain the area's security. As for post offices, schools, banks, and shops, they will all arise as needed.</p>

After the representatives expressed their opinions on the 4 million yuan for encouraging raw silk production and rescuing the silk industry, Shen Huachen proposed a distribution method: one bale of silk and two carts as a unit, with each unit receiving bonds with a face value of 160 yuan. This was approved by the majority. Then, the issue of fundamentally improving the silk industry and improving silkworm breeding and machinery for rescuing the silk industry was discussed. After a long discussion, it was unanimously agreed to ask silk industry experts Zhou Tingding, Ge Jingzhong, and Zheng Bijiang to draft a detailed plan for further discussion.</p>
<p>Resolutions Passed: The resolutions passed after yesterday's discussion are as follows: (1) It was resolved that the Jiang-Zhejiang Silk Industry Bond will encourage the export of raw silk and rescue the silk industry by distributing bonds based on one bale of silk and two carts as a unit, with each unit receiving bonds with a face value of 160 yuan, to be distributed by silk merchant representatives.

Besides ordering the Social Bureau to draft regulations for the fund management committee for approval, we hereby inform you for your reference."</p>
<h3 id="e167">Lawyers Association Requests Revocation of the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau's Notice Banning Rent Arrears <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Lawyers Association was notified of the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau's Notice No. 25 regarding banning rent arrears issued in October of the 19th year of the Republic of China, Commissioner Yu Zhongluo proposed a recommendation stating that this matter conflicts with the Civil Procedure Law and divides judicial power. The matter was already decided by the council to</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>submit a petition to the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval to order the revocation. A letter was sent to the municipal government, but there has been no response for months. Therefore, the association submitted the matter to the 80th Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees and resolved to submit another petition to the Executive Yuan, requesting the Shanghai municipal government to order the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau to revoke the notice banning rent arrears to uphold the rule of law. The original text is copied below. Petition for Ordering the Shanghai Municipal Government to Revoke the Public Safety Bureau's Notice Banning Rent Arrears to Uphold the Rule of Law. The temporary Civil Procedure Regulations approved by the National Government stipulate in Article 2, Paragraph 1 that disputes between landlords and tenants should be under the jurisdiction of the primary court. Article 1 of the Civil Procedure Law promulgated by the National Government states that civil litigation is under the jurisdiction of the court where the defendant's ordinary trial registration is located. When a tenant owes rent and the landlord requests payment, it is entirely a civil case that should naturally be under the jurisdiction of the court where the ordinary trial registration is located. Article 8 and Article 13 of the Municipal Organization Law state that the municipal government's handling of affairs and issuance of regulations must not conflict with central laws. In October of the 19th year of the Republic of China, because the association's Shanghai Public Safety Bureau issued Notice No. 25 regarding banning rent arrears, which stated that in the future, any rent arrears would be strictly dealt with without leniency once reported by the landlord. The council decided that rent disputes fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of the courts, and the Public Safety Bureau has no right to interfere. A letter was sent to the municipal government requesting a restraint. At the same time, a suggestion was made to the Judicial Yuan requesting the Shanghai District Court to vigorously implement provisional execution and other preservation procedures for rent arrears cases to prevent delays and escapes, and to allow rent recovery until the end of the execution to take both sides into consideration. Ministry of Justice No. 1002 replied that the suggestions have been notified to the Shanghai District Court. However, for several months, tenants have been subjected to police orders to pay or hand over rent due to rent arrears. On April 30th of this year, the association received a letter from a tenant in Yixing Lane on Guoqing Road seeking justice and decided to send a letter to the municipal government requesting detailed information on the specific measures for banning rent arrears. But both letters were not answered. Now, the association's 80th Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees has decided that the Civil Procedure Regulations and the Municipal Government Organization Law, the Public Safety Bureau's Notice No. 25 issued in the 19th year of the Republic of China is not legally effective. If the court's judgment on the same rent arrears case conflicts with the Public Safety Bureau's punishment or differs, the court's judgment should prevail. At the same time, to respect the municipal government's intention to protect the landlord, we request the court to vigorously implement provisional execution and other preservation procedures to reconcile judicial and political parties. In addition to sending another letter to the municipal government to quickly revoke the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau's Notice No. 25 banning rent arrears, we also notify all landlords to file a lawsuit with the court if they encounter rent arrears and not to make any requests to the Public Safety Bureau. Sincerely presenting this petition to the Executive Yuan for review and approval to order the Shanghai municipal government to revoke the Public Safety Bureau's Notice Banning Rent Arrears to uphold the rule of law. Respectfully submitted to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Shanghai Lawyers Association Standing Committee respectfully presents.</p>
<h3 id="e168">City Chamber of Commerce Cables Request to Stop Tax on Zhejiang Province Cocoon Industry <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "On the 8th of this month, we received a letter from the Silk Factory Association stating that the Association previously considered the proposed taxation of the silk cocoon industry in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei to be inconsistent with the taxation standards set by the ministry and requested the National Government's Ministry of Finance to quickly correct it. We also sent a letter to your association requesting your support and forwarding it to the case. On the 3rd of this month, we received your letter No. 1216, which copied the Ministry of Finance's letter No. 6414. We have already ordered the Finance Departments of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei to deliberate and respond. The Shanghai Silk Factory Association's request to exempt the cocoon industry from business tax, etc., has arrived at the Ministry, and we will order them to comply with the response after the Finance Department's response arrives. This reply, etc., is forwarded to your association. We also received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance with the same meaning. Although the translation of the telegram does not explicitly show rejection, it clearly recognizes that this request is reasonable. Unexpectedly, on the 4th of this month, we received the approval from the Zhejiang Finance Department, which misinterpreted the Ministry's text and disrupted the administrative system in violation of central regulations. Therefore, we wrote another article describing the Zhejiang Finance Department's approval and requested the Ministry of Finance to strictly prohibit it. Therefore, we copied the draft and sent it to your association for assistance and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to order the Zhejiang Finance Department to stop collecting taxes. The Zhejiang Finance Department's approval of the Silk Factory Association's document states that the business tax is taxed on business, and anyone who has a business transaction, whether buying or selling, must pay the business tax. Cocoon merchants collecting cocoons is a business, so they cannot be exempted from the obligation to pay taxes. The cocoon posting certificate issued by the cocoon firm is charged according to the stove and has a special permit nature and is different from the intermediary certificate, etc. The meaning of the approval is divided into two levels. The first level is that the business tax must be paid regardless of whether it is buying or selling. This level is completely contrary to the approval of the Ministry, which only buys and does not sell and has no business income. Villagers are not taxed for business. Regardless of the type of business, selling is the business, so only buying and not selling proves that the business has not been completed. According to the views of the Zhejiang Finance Department, if there is a tax on buying and a tax on selling, a business can collect two business taxes. This is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, this point alone is enough to prove that the cocoon collection of silk factories in the mainland is the nature of villagers, and there is no reason to pay taxes according to the previous approval of the Ministry. Its interpretation of the cocoon posting certificate as a special permit business and different from the intermediary certificate is even more a misinterpretation of the Ministry's text. In our country, before the general business tax was handled, the so-called intermediary tax, slaughter tax, etc. were taxed because they had a special business nature. This time, the tax on the special business tax that was charged in the past is changed to the newly set name, all to avoid miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, the shops that collect the special business tax will no longer collect the general business tax as a consistent principle of the Ministry. Moreover, Article 11 of the Supplementary Measures has the same taxes as other business taxes, whether it is charged according to the stove or not, the nature is the same as the business tax, and it should not be taxed repeatedly. The Zhejiang Finance Department's approval failed to appreciate the Ministry's regulations and should be ordered to stop collecting taxes. Sincerely, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau issued a reply to the City Chamber of Commerce regarding the Tax Reporting Industry Association, which has been suspended. The bureau stated that it had ordered the association to properly mediate and set a deadline for its establishment. However, the industry has still not reorganized and established itself in accordance with the regulations. The various customs offices have been ordered to be revoked by the central government, and the nature of the industry's business will inevitably change as a result. If the tax reporting is still used, it will be inappropriate. Therefore, you must inform the association to dissolve the association immediately and report the details of compliance.</p>

<p>At the China-Japan Modern Painting Exhibition held in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, artists from all over China participated, so there were many products. It is reported that the Japanese Empress Dowager visited the exhibition on the 16th of last month. She admired the ink bamboo painted by Yu Shaosong, saying it surpasses the masses, and paid a high price to purchase it for the inner government. The Tokyo art community believes that this is the glory of the Chinese art community. The newspapers and magazines have photographed and published Mr. Yu's works, and have telegraphed the Japanese Consulate in Hangzhou to inform Mr. Yu in memory of this event. This is not only the glory of Mr. Yu, but also the glory of the Chinese art community. Mr. Yu, named Yueyuan, is a native of Longyou, Zhejiang. He was formerly a well-reputed official in the Ministry of Justice. After returning to Hangzhou, he wrote and painted.

<p>After the Cantonese members of the Shanghai Chinese Seamen's Industrial United Association left, the Central Government telegraphed Member Miao Yongzhang and others to go to Beijing for talks. Now they have returned to Shanghai. A reporter from Xin Sheng She visited the association's member Miao and asked about the course of the talks and the Central Government's opinions. He said that after going to Beijing, Secretary Shi Weihuan of the Central Training Department received them and agreed to submit the matter to the Central Executive Committee for discussion and specific measures will be determined. The Central Executive Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 8th and Secretary Song Linhua of the Seamen's Union attended the meeting to report on the departure of Cantonese member Zhao Zhizhi and others. He requested: (1) Please punish Zhao, etc. (2) Please send someone to inspect the Seamen's Union and the status of the Seamen's work. (3) Please temporarily retain the Seamen's Union. (4) Please add committee members to the union to facilitate labor movement. Chairman Ding Weifen accepted the request and instructed him to return to Shanghai to work as usual and await orders from the Central Government. Therefore, the association has been working as usual since yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Decree from the Department Ordering the Organization of a Factory Supervision Committee <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs, stating that it was acting in accordance with Instruction No. 92, Min Zi, of the Ministry of Interior. The instruction stated that it had received a consultation from the Ministry of Industry regarding the transfer of documents from the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Ministry of Railways concerning the organization of a factory supervision committee to resolve labor-capital disputes. After a general meeting, it was decided that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with relevant ministries, should deliberate and handle the matter, and the record was kept on file. Labor-capital disputes are a major obstacle to the future of industry. If labor-capital problems are not resolved, there will be no hope for the revitalization of industry. In recent years, many factories in the country have been forced to shut down due to labor-capital disputes. If guidance and supervision are not provided, the consequences are unimaginable. The proposals in the case were pertinent and to the point. In order to promote cooperation between labor and capital and the development of industry, the Ministry has submitted for promulgation the Factory Law and the Factory Inspection Law, and is now preparing to implement them in order. At the beginning of implementation, it is essential to understand the management and economic situation of each factory, so that future measures will have a basis. The welfare of labor must be improved, but the funds for improving labor welfare mostly come from the increase in production rates, and the increase in production efficiency depends on the scientific management of factories. We are hereby copying the original case for your review. The first step is to investigate the management and economic situation of each factory, and then, based on economic principles and the best management methods, to formulate improvement standards. This is a matter of great importance, and you are requested to instruct your subordinates to fill in the attached form in detail and report back for verification and forwarding. The county magistrate is instructed to follow the instructions and instruct his subordinates to fill in the attached form in detail and report back for verification and forwarding. This decree now presents the original proposal for organizing a factory supervision committee to resolve labor disputes as follows: The country is flooded with foreign goods. All daily necessities such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, such as foreign cloth, felt, wool, rice, noodles, canned goods, foreign pine oil, paint, railway materials, cars, and gasoline, are imported from foreign countries, resulting in a daily decrease in cash and a difficult life for the people. If this is not changed, how can the country be built? The reason is that Chinese workers only know how to increase wages and do not seek to improve efficiency. Capital only knows how to exploit and hire low-wage workers in order to obtain more dividends, and fails to take into account the improvement of workers' lives and treatment. Therefore, although there are abundant raw materials, abundant capital, and a large number of workers, labor and capital cannot fully cooperate, and the future of industry is still without hope for development. In order to promote production and increase the national economy, it is proposed that the central government organize a factory supervision committee, and hire factory management experts, factory accounting experts, factory efficiency experts, and legal experts to guide and supervise all matters of each factory. The first step is to investigate the management and economic situation of each factory, and then, based on economic principles and the best management methods, to formulate improvement standards. The second step is to stipulate appropriate distribution of workers' living expenses, capital interest rates, and bonuses for both labor and capital. If the factory management is improper or the workers' treatment is poor, an immediate order should be issued to improve it. Labor should prioritize efficiency and should not arbitrarily demand extra conditions or threaten to strike. The principle of equality and mutual benefit between labor and capital should be sought to achieve cooperation. As a result, both parties can perform their duties and production will increase day by day, the economy will become more prosperous, and industrial development can compete with the great powers. Is it not only a passive resistance?</p>

<p>Work Stoppage Due to Beating of Manager</p>
<p>The Guanghua Machinery Dyeing Factory on Luban Road in this city is the leading dyeing factory in the city. Since Gu Yongquan became the factory manager, labor-capital disputes have occurred from time to time. Yesterday morning, the reinstatement of worker Zhu Linlin sparked mass anger, resulting in a major labor strike. The factory manager was beaten. General Manager Pu Shuhong, upon hearing this, immediately announced a temporary work stoppage and reported to the party and government authorities for investigation. The labor union, concerned about the work stoppage and the livelihood of the workers, also requested an investigation. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department, recognizing the seriousness of the matter, sent Zhu Guilin and Zhou Funong to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to verify and handle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Wage Increase Issue for Employees of British-Owned Gas Company Remains Unresolved <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Decision Awaits Board Meeting</p>
<p>The Chinese employees of the British-owned gas company in this city have requested a wage increase because the company has increased the wages of foreign employees by as much as 40 to 50 percent, while Chinese employees have not received any increase. However, the company has repeatedly made excuses to delay. Here is a summary of various reports heard yesterday:</p>
<p>Labor Negotiations: Over the past two days, the labor side sent Bao Yugen, Yao Liankun, and two others as plenipotentiary representatives to meet with Chief Engineer Baker at the factory's writing room for consultation. The initial meeting yielded no results because the capital side firmly refused to increase wages.</p>
<p>Further Negotiations: The two representatives, Bao and Yao, feeling that they had not achieved their goals, had no choice but to return to report. After further discussions, the labor side felt that both the Chinese and foreign departments were employees of the factory and should be treated equally without discrimination. How could they favor one over the other? This was truly unfair. Therefore, more than ten department heads from each department, including Zhu Deyu, Zhu Wenyao, Chai Bende, Lu Zhengrong, Wu Qigui, Zhou Maotou, Lu Afa, Lou Maosheng, Su Jinlin, and Dong Shunyi, accompanied Bao and Yao to negotiate again. After much hesitation, the factory finally replied that the issue of the wage increase would be decided at the board meeting on the 11th. This matter cannot be resolved for the time being and a response will be given after the meeting. The workers then withdrew. The outcome remains to be seen after the board meeting.</p>
<p>Factory's Explanation: According to the factory's statement to the Nichinichi Shimbun reporter, there are two reasons for the wage increase for foreign employees: (1) The price of gold has skyrocketed. Foreign employees in China convert their wages from Chinese currency to gold pounds, so the Chinese currency must be increased. However, although the increase is nominal, there is no actual increase when calculated in gold pounds. (2) Foreign employees have high expenses and their standard of living is higher than that of Chinese employees. Therefore, a small child economic assistance allowance is recently given as a child rearing fee. However, the labor side believes that both of these reasons are unreasonable. Regarding the first point, the impact of the rise in the price of gold not only affects foreign employees, but also affects Chinese employees. Regarding the second point, although the standard of living of foreigners is high, their salary level is already much higher than that of Chinese employees. Moreover, Chinese also have small children and should they not also receive small child economic assistance allowances? Therefore, the labor side still demands to achieve the goal of a wage increase.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Government and Court Demanding Strict Crackdown on Security Guards <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Guaranteeing Personal Freedom of Chinese</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ratepayers Association of Chinese residents yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Government and the Special District Court, requesting a strict crackdown on security guards arbitrarily detaining people. The letter stated, "Respectfully, according to a letter from Mr. Dai Chengxiang, it was reported on the 3rd of this month that Portuguese national Tersa claimed to be the director of the security guards and that the defendants were detectives investigating matters in the association. If someone is to be detained, he must issue a detention warrant. We are deeply shocked to read this. Personal freedom should be respected. Therefore, Article 8, Paragraph 1, of the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period of the Republic of China stipulates that people shall not be arrested, detained, interrogated, or punished except in accordance with the law. According to the current Criminal Procedure Law, except for current offenders who may be arrested without a warrant by anyone, other defendants may not be arrested by private individuals. Only prosecutors, presiding judges, or judges appointed by the court who believe that the conditions for legal detention are met may issue a detention warrant. The Shanghai Detective Security Association is organized by private individuals. How can they issue detention warrants to detain people? Now, Portuguese national Tersa openly claims in our country's court that he has the power to issue detention warrants, which is a contempt for our country's sovereignty. If this is not strictly prohibited, unscrupulous foreigners will arbitrarily issue detention warrants in the name of detective security associations to detain people, and our country's sovereignty will be completely destroyed. The freedom of our Chinese people will be trampled upon. The harm is even worse than consular jurisdiction. Therefore, we hereby request your association to quickly discuss with Chinese and foreign authorities to severely warn the Shanghai Detective Security Association not to issue detention warrants to detain people. If they dare to violate the law, the association will be dissolved and the perpetrators will be punished to the fullest extent of the law in order to protect national rights and respect freedom." The association believes that the issues raised in the letter regarding sovereignty and freedom are very important and should be forwarded to the relevant authorities. We respectfully request that you investigate, strictly crack down, and maintain national sovereignty and the freedom of the people. This is respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Special District Court.</p>

<p>Respectfully, to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry, Nanjing National Government. Our member, Shanghai Jincheng Paper Company, General Manager Wang Shuxian, reports that the Hangzhou Wulin Paper Mill leased by the company has a contract that has not yet expired. On March 25 of this year, the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department illegally seized and sealed the mill and published an advertisement for its sale. We have repeatedly filed appeals, and your ministry has issued a telegram ordering the provincial government to stop its improper disposal. However, according to reports from employees inside the mill, the Construction Department yesterday sent a large number of workers and police to expel all employees in the mill in preparation for transferring the mill's property. Please uphold justice. We have investigated and found that since your ministry has issued a telegram ordering the Zhejiang Provincial Government to stop the disposal, it should obey the order and wait for a resolution. However, the department is relying on its position to despise the law and damage the credibility of the central government. Therefore, we are reporting the situation by telegram and respectfully request that your ministry promptly provide legal relief and make a fair decision for the public good. Shanghai Paper Industry Association, Chairman Liu Minqi, respectfully.</p>

<p>Few Family Members Remain Untraced</p>
<p>Advertisements Published to Notify Them</p>
<p>The Xinkang Ship Disaster Victims Association held a committee meeting yesterday afternoon. First, Standing Committee member Mr. Zhu reported on the progress of all association affairs and the consultations with legal advisors Wu Jingxiong and Sheng Zhenwei. Then, the issue of the lawsuit was discussed. All procedures have been prepared by lawyers Wu and Sheng. It was pointed out that because there are many victims' families, their origins are different. After the disaster, because the case has not been resolved, some have returned to their hometowns, some are in remote villages, some have moved elsewhere, and some have sought a living elsewhere. While most of those who are still in or near Shanghai have sent letters requesting progress or have come in person to discuss association affairs, some victims' families remain untraced. The lawyers require individual letters of authorization from all victims' families to represent them in the lawsuit. Currently, while more than half of the families have signed letters of authorization, a small number of families have not yet completed this procedure due to relocation, so the lawyers have not submitted the lawsuit in order to protect the interests of all. However, the statutory period for the lawsuit is about to expire, so it is necessary to proceed as quickly as possible to avoid self-inflicted delays. After discussion, the committee decided to immediately publish advertisements in various newspapers, giving families living outside of Shanghai or who have relocated three weeks to come to the association to report and prepare to sign letters of authorization to the lawyers in order to achieve success and avoid unnecessary losses. Other procedural matters were discussed before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Anti-Drug Association Urges Smokers to Enter Hospitals for Addiction Treatment <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Prescribing Guarantee Measures</p>
<p>Requesting Introduction from Various Organizations</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association yesterday sent a letter to various organizations stating, "Respectfully, this association has investigated the situation of smokers and found that most of them smoke due to illness, especially those who are poor and helpless. If measures are not taken to quit as soon as possible, they will sink into the abyss and will never be able to extricate themselves. This association, based on its resources, has specially negotiated with appropriate hospitals to provide various semi-free and completely free methods in order to fundamentally treat and relieve the suffering of smokers. More than 260 smokers have been introduced to hospitals by this association, all of whom voluntarily quit their addiction and will never smoke again. However, recently, the hospitals have stated that after the smokers arrive at the hospital, the doctors treat them according to the severity of their addiction, prescribing the amount of medication and the length of treatment. While many follow the hospital rules and quit their addiction, quite a few are lazy and unmotivated, giving up halfway. This not only undoes the previous efforts but also wastes a considerable amount of medical expenses, which is very regrettable. They have requested that this association find a way to remedy the situation. Since the smokers have already resolved to quit their addiction, they should not give up halfway. If this lazy nature is not changed and measures are not taken to supervise them, not only will the hospitals be unwilling to continue to accept them, but this association will also find it difficult to introduce them again. Therefore, it is now stipulated that all smokers who are determined to quit smoking should be introduced by organizations or guaranteed by shops. Smokers can only enjoy free treatment if they enter the hospital to quit smoking and are willing to comply with hospital regulations until their addiction is completely cured. They must not give up halfway. With such meticulous restrictions and supervision, the results will be significant. Accordingly, we are sending this letter for your information. In the future, if there are smokers who request to quit smoking, we hope that your association will introduce them to this association and help them find a reliable guarantor so that the smokers will not give up halfway and waste their efforts. The smokers will be fortunate, and this association will be fortunate."</p>

<p>The Fei Xing Cao sold by Tianji Medical Room in this city is specially used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, hemoptysis, deficiency, and other diseases. The effect is miraculous. Despite the fact that counterfeit products have appeared on the market over the years, the sales of Fei Xing Cao have become more and more prosperous. In particular, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia often suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis due to the hot climate and the inability of the lungs to function properly. Once Fei Xing Cao is taken, it will immediately cure chronic diseases and restore health. Therefore, it is well-known for a time and is regarded as the best medicine for treating tuberculosis. Recently, there have been large batches of exports, which are still in short supply. This is truly a good phenomenon in the Chinese medicine industry. The publishing house is still located in Xinpuqingli, Shilu, to facilitate citizens to purchase and take it nearby.</p>

<h3 id="e183">A Record of Visiting the Du Ancestral Hall <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Parade</p>
<p>Today's Enshrinement</p>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng's family ancestral hall in Gaoqiao, Pudong, was completed yesterday with a parade. Today's enshrinement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Parade: Around 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the area around Rue Montauban and Rue Way Kong in the French Concession was filled with various ceremonial items, with large flags flying and umbrellas and signboards lining the streets. In addition, the weather was beautiful, with the rising sun shining brightly, adding to the brilliance of the fresh flowers and rare herbs. As the bells rang nine times, the entire political department of the French Concession led the way amidst the melodious sound of military music. The various ranks followed in order, proceeding south on Rue Way Kong to Avenue Li Mei, turning east onto Quai de Montigny, then south on Route Cardinal Mercier, and further east on Laobei Men Street, and finally on Xiaodong Men Street all the way to the Jinliyuan Wharf. The crowds of onlookers along the way were immense, praising it as unprecedented.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Inside the Du Ancestral Hall <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Wharf Scene: Several paifang (ceremonial gateways) were erected at Jinliyuan Wharf.</p>
<p>Members of the security regiment were stationed at the wharf to maintain order. From 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., cars arrived in an endless stream, and male and female guests flocked to the wharf to board the prepared steamships to await departure. At 11:30 a.m., the parade arrived at the wharf. A shout of joy and the sound of firecrackers echoed each other. The military police, regiments, and various school boy scouts boarded the ships one by one in an orderly manner. A special steamship was also prepared for female guests. As the ships were anchored one after another, the sound of firecrackers grew louder. The various military bands took turns playing in the ships, and the boy scouts also sang happily. The music and songs were magnificent, an unprecedented spectacle in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>The Scene at Gaoqiao: After an hour's voyage, the ships arrived at Gaoqiao, Pudong, where the clean wharf and lush trees were a refreshing sight. Male and female guests disembarked one after another and were guided by reception staff to the Du Ancestral Hall either by car or on foot, all feeling infinitely interested. Gaoqiao, bordering the river and the sea, is a strategic location with beautiful scenery along the way. The crowds of onlookers on the roadside were like a grand festival.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Du Ancestral Hall: A five-story, extremely large painted archway was erected in front of the Du Ancestral Hall. The ancestral hall has five rooms and three courtyards. The second courtyard is the main hall, and the third courtyard is the place where the ancestral tablet is enshrined. Two majestic stone lions stand in front of the gate, which is grand and spacious. Various gifts from all walks of life are displayed in each room, numbering in the thousands, a dazzling array of beauty. Due to the large number of guests, more than a hundred straw sheds were built around the ancestral hall. The hall's opera stage was also a straw shed to the west of the ancestral hall, which was unusually large and could accommodate more than two hundred tables. However, there were more than 10,000 guests yesterday afternoon, who could not all be accommodated at once, so they had to be accommodated in two or three shifts. The crowded and lively scene was truly rare. It is expected that there will be even more guests today, the main day of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Male and Female Guests: About 10,000 male and female guests arrived yesterday, including male guests such as Yang Xiaotian, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Qian Jieshen, and Yu Ziying, and female guests such as Zheng Yuxiu, Mrs. Wang Liangchou, and Mrs. Yang Zhaoyun.</p>
<p>Enshrinement: Yesterday was the procession across the river, while the enshrinement ceremony will be held at 5:00 a.m. today (the 10th). Most of the thousands of guests yesterday did not return to Shanghai, preparing to attend the above ceremony.</p>
<p>Commemorative Postmark: The Postal Administration of this city, in order to commemorate the completion ceremony of the Du Ancestral Hall, specially set up a temporary post office on the spot, giving away commemorative envelopes and adding a commemorative postmark.</p>
<p>Chairman Congratulates: The Secretariat of the National Government yesterday sent a telegram to Yang Xiaotian, asking him to represent the government in congratulating Du Yuesheng. The original telegram said: "To Army Counselor Yang Xiaotian, Shanghai, the 10th of this month is the completion of Mr. Du Yuesheng's new ancestral hall. Please represent the government in offering congratulations. By order. Secretariat of the National Government, Qing."</p>

<p>Congratulatory Telegrams from Various Parties (Telegram from Shao Lizi) Shao Lizi's wife sent a telegram from Beijing yesterday saying: "Urgent. To Mr. Qian Xumi, Shanghai, transfer to Mr. Du Yuesheng. Congratulations on the completion of the ancestral hall. Lizi has not yet returned south and cannot come to Shanghai. I am entrusted to send a telegram of congratulations and apologies. Shao Fu Zhanmei, respectfully." (He Yingqin) "The completion of the ancestral hall deserves congratulations. I am unable to attend as I am ordered to suppress bandits far away in Ganjiang, which is very regrettable (omitted below)." (Wang Zhengting) "The completion of the ancestral hall is a grand event. Filial piety is inexhaustible. I admire without end. I am unable to participate in person due to national affairs. I am hereby sending Secretary Liu to represent me and offer a congratulatory couplet." (Wu Peifu) "The new ancestral hall is magnificent and the clan is prosperous. Auspiciousness opens up a hundred generations. I am far away in Sichuan and unable to participate in the grand event. I entrust my brother Qianzhi to represent me in offering congratulations. I respectfully wish you prosperity." (He Chengjun) "I respectfully congratulate you on the completion of the ancestral hall. The ritual is the foundation, so the system of ancestral temples is extremely important. Filial piety is valued, so the sacrificial ceremonies are performed with utmost respect. This is the beautiful intention of uniting the clan and respecting the ancestors. The virtues of teaching filial piety and enriching customs are also appreciated. Ancient sages have all devoted themselves to this. I have long admired your dedication to your parents and your sincerity in caring for them. I have heard that you pursue the memory of your ancestors. May benevolence return and your home be blessed, and may the altar be new and the offerings be lavish, with ancestors in the east and west to bless your family forever. I gaze upon the beautiful and magnificent hall and offer the finest sacrificial utensils. Filial piety is inexhaustible and will always bless your descendants. The poets sang of this. Is it not magnificent? I am in charge of Han Gao, thinking of visiting but unable to do so. I am ashamed to be unable to attend the ceremonies. I can only offer my sincere wishes and pay my respects from afar. Please forgive me for my inadequacy." (Ma Fuxiang) "Managing the Ministry of Works, the ancestral hall and ancestral sacrifices report the foundation. Adorning Fanchuan, the flowers and trees are newly painted on the walls. May you chant the song of pepper and prolong the world, and may the melons and gourds be able to have the joy of having a home. The virtuous door is in sight and the distant road increases joy. I am honored to lead the birds and care for the etiquette and education. I am delighted to hear the magpie's song and am willing to learn. However, my duties are tied to my official post, which leads to longing. I sing and praise the great event in the Jade Building and the Qionglou in front of the wind. The Heavenly Hall plays the music and the Golden Zun plays the Dharma music. The distant congratulations are sincere."</p>

<p>To Be Sent to Hong Kong Today</p>
<p>The Changxing Company's ship "Empress of Canada" from Vancouver to Shanghai, when the ship arrived in Japan, a Philippine passenger named Bi Laisi went crazy inside the large rudder and entered the steerage cabin with a knife, slashing anyone he encountered. A total of twenty-nine people were injured on the spot by the madman, including twenty Chinese passengers. After this incident occurred, the ship had already sent the injured passengers to Japanese hospitals for treatment. The madman was locked up on the ship to restrict his movements. Last night, the "Empress of Canada" arrived in Shanghai and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. According to the company's staff, the perpetrator, the madman, is scheduled to be escorted back to Hong Kong on the "Empress of Canada" today and handed over to the Hong Kong authorities for trial. Many of the injured passengers were Chinese who were going to land at various ports and were Chinese living in the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Who is the Floating Corpse? <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Wang Ahua Goes Missing, Father Identifies the Body</p>
<p>Land Protector Collects the Body Without Reporting, Too Confused</p>
<p>Wang Ahua, a resident of Yuepu, Wusong, was helping out at Gao Yisheng's house and then went missing. Later, a male corpse floated up in Pudong and was collected by the land protector. Recently, Wang's father, Wang Fengzhou, came forward to accuse Gao Yisheng and others of beating his son to death and throwing him into the river to cover up their tracks. He claimed that the corpse was his son. The first precinct of the seventh district arrested Gao Yisheng and handed him over to the local court for detention. However, the defendant claimed that the corpse collected by the land protector was an unidentified floating corpse and that Wang Fengzhou was falsely claiming kinship. The court stated that since the land protector had retrieved the male corpse at the time, why did he not report it for identification? It was obvious that he was confused in his handling of the matter and that there were suspicious points. Therefore, he had ordered an investigation. However, the corpse had already decomposed and it would not be easy to identify it without exhuming the body. Who it is is truly a mystery.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Shanghai South Public Bus Disturbance Yesterday <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Soldiers Causing Trouble on the Bus</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a Route 3 circular bus of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company, traveling from Xiaodongmen to the Xinqiao Street station, was boarded by a soldier from the machine gun company of the 26th Regiment stationed in Longhua. The female ticket seller, Lu Dongmei, asked him to purchase a ticket. The soldier claimed he was on official duty and had never bought a ticket on any bus. The ticket seller stated that there were regulations for military personnel riding buses, and if on official assignment, she requested to see his official document to comply with the regulations. The soldier replied that he was carrying important documents and could not disclose confidential information to the public. The two sides argued, and the female ticket seller was slapped by the soldier. When the bus arrived at Laoximen, the soldier jumped off, intending to escape, but the ticket seller grabbed him and took him to the bus company. The company telegraphed the 26th Regiment, which instructed them to bring the soldier to the regiment for questioning. The company's investigator and the female ticket seller then escorted the soldier to the regiment. However, when they reached Huasheng Bridge, they were surrounded by many soldiers from the regiment. The patrol police in the area, upon hearing of this, reported to the Second District Public Security Bureau. Inspector Gao led several police officers to mediate. However, the soldiers were overbearing, refusing to listen to reason and even attempting to assault the police officers. Inspector Gao, outnumbered, was helpless. The Public Security Bureau telegraphed the 26th Regiment, requesting officers to come to the scene to suppress the situation. Deputy Officer Deng of the regiment then led several soldiers to the scene and took the soldier who had caused the disturbance on the bus away for investigation. The others dispersed in a rush. Deputy Officer Deng, fearing other soldiers would seek revenge, deployed armed soldiers on each bus for protection.</p>

<p>Riverside Shacks Already Dismantled Yesterday</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Civilian Housing Committee is making every effort to provide housing for the city's poor. Previously, several hundred civilian housing units were built in Zhabei to house nearby impoverished residents, which was widely praised by the public. Now, the Second Civilian Housing project on Xieshi Road has also been completed, and residents of the Dapu Bridge shantytown area have been designated to move in. There are over four hundred shacks along the riverside in that area, but due to habit, they have not yet moved. Yesterday, the committee dismantled about two hundred of the riverside shacks, ordering the residents to move. It is also reported that the committee recently purchased land at Kongjia Wooden Bridge in Zhabei and will begin construction of the Third Civilian Housing project immediately, benefiting the residents.</p>

<p>Municipal Council is Considering</p>
<p>Due to insufficient funds to maintain the Hongkou Swimming Pool, the Municipal Council of the Public Concession previously decided to temporarily suspend its operation. According to news from the Japanese community in this city, a majority of the merchants and residents in the Hongkou area are Japanese. Furthermore, the Japanese place great emphasis on swimming. The Municipal Council's decision to close the swimming pool has caused considerable inconvenience to the Japanese residents in Shanghai. Therefore, the Japanese residents have requested the Japanese Chamber of Commerce to petition the Municipal Council to rescind the decision and reopen the swimming pool. It is reported that the Municipal Council is currently considering the Japanese Chamber of Commerce's request but has not yet given a definitive response.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Chang Yunheng Sues Ling Bao and Zhi Zun Bao <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Damages of Seven Thousand Two Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Chang Yunheng, backstage manager of the Tianchan Stage, filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court accusing Gu Er Kang, manager of Ling Bao and Zhi Zun Bao located at 308 Ningbo Road, of defamation. The complaint stated that the plaintiff, as backstage manager of Tianchan Stage, never improperly took a single coin from the performers beyond his regular salary. However, Ling Bao and Zhi Zun Bao, for unknown reasons, fabricated false claims, publishing groundless stories that intentionally damaged the plaintiff's reputation. The articles alleged that the plaintiff received kickbacks from each performer's monthly salary. Specifically, it claimed that although Qilin Tong's salary was three thousand one hundred yuan, the plaintiff received the full amount each month and, dissatisfied with not receiving the odd hundred yuan as a reward, sought to vent his anger by creating difficulties and withholding the salary for the month, leading Zhou (Qilin Tong) to consider leaving Tianchan (as seen in Ling Bao issue 122 and Zhi Zun Bao issue 1). Gu Zhuxuan, owner of Tianchan Stage, believing the report to be true, became enraged, immediately suspended the plaintiff from his position as backstage manager, and ordered him to clear his accounts, return all kickbacks received from the performers over time, or he would not be allowed to go elsewhere. The plaintiff argued that the newspapers fabricated facts and spread rumors, damaging his reputation and causing him to be unjustly suspended, constituting a violation of Article 330 of the Criminal Code. As the backstage manager of Tianchan Stage, he received a monthly salary of six hundred yuan. Due to the impact of the false reports, he has lost his job and cannot expect to be hired elsewhere. Being unemployed for a year results in a loss of seven thousand two hundred yuan, and ten years would amount to seventy-two thousand yuan. He is therefore claiming damages of seven thousand two hundred yuan based on one year's loss. The trial was scheduled for yesterday, but the defendant could not be served as the summons was delivered by a Chinese constable who reported that the address on Ningbo Road did not exist. The plaintiff also failed to appear due to other matters. The case was adjourned to a later date.</p>

<p>Dong Changmin, warden of the Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing, recently stated that with the arrival of summer and the overcrowding of inmates in the prison, hygiene should be given more attention. To prevent the outbreak of epidemics, he requested the Municipal Health Bureau to send physicians Yang Yujie, Li Minsheng, and Zhang Wenkui to the prison on the 8th of this month to administer vaccinations. Over two thousand male and female inmates in the entire prison were universally vaccinated, a task that took a full day to complete.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Ju Runsheng Sued for Ignoring Advances Case <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Witness Testimony Already Heard</p>
<p>Re-scheduled for Further Arguments</p>
<p>Zhao Guanqing, previously having retained lawyers Zheng Yuxiu and Li Xinyang, sued Ju Runsheng and others in the Civil Division of the French Court for ignoring advances related to the Yi Sheng Zhuang. Yesterday, a witness was called to testify. Yu Qiaqing stated that during the takeover and sale of Yi Sheng Zhuang twenty-four years ago, merchants at the scene testified that Yi Sheng Zhuang had over one million in outstanding orders, which was precarious. Fearing that Rui Kang Hao would be affected, Zhao Yuting, the plaintiff's uncle, who was over sixty years old, took over the takeover and sale of Yi Sheng Zhuang to be run by the plaintiff to ensure the greater good. However, the internal situation was not entirely clear to the merchants. The plaintiff's lawyer asked if Zhao Runji was the same as Ju Runsheng. Yu replied that Zhao Runji was Zhao Shuangting. The plaintiff, Zhao Guanqing, claimed that the defendant, Ju Runsheng, was actually a shareholder of Yi Sheng Zhuang, attached to his uncle, Zhao Yuting, and thus Zhao Runji came forward to take over the operation and sales of the business to him. At the time, the merchants taking over the business were fully aware they would lose, and were even aware they could face imprisonment. Out of deference to his uncle, coupled with Yu Qiaqing's gentle persuasion, he was willing to endure the loss and agreed to find a way to compensate for it later. Unexpectedly, after the death of his uncle Zhao Shuangting, the defendant Ju Runsheng only provided compensation of over fifty thousand yuan, refusing to provide further compensation which was deliberately intended to be deceitful and excessively deceptive. Yu Qiaqing further stated that at that time, the merchants were indeed aware that Guanqing was incurring significant losses and had indeed agreed to compensate him later. Afterwards, Zhao Yuting transferred fifty thousand yuan to compensate Zhao Guanqing which was a fact. Ju Runsheng, represented by lawyer Lu Shaozong, argued that Yu Qiaqing had testified that Zhao Runji was Zhao Yuting, thus indicating that his client, Ju Runsheng, had no relationship with Yi Sheng Zhuang. He continued to argue that the plaintiff and defendant were relatives, the plaintiff Zhao Guanqing being the nephew of the defendant Ju Runsheng. Because Zhao Guanqing often asked Ju Runsheng for large sums of money, the plaintiff Zhao Guanqing had previously attempted to borrow one hundred thousand yuan from Ju Runsheng, and after being denied what he desired, insulted him. Afterwards, upon mediation, he eventually borrowed fifty thousand yuan, with the plaintiff sending a letter of apology. He now presents the letter for inspection. He claims that this suit is an attempt to blackmail and there are no other disputes, requesting that the case be dismissed. The plaintiff's lawyer then argued that the value of the case was a total of 459,000 taels, and the amount of damages</p>
<p>was estimated at over a million yuan. The defendant has limited real estate. The judge Gong ruled that the witness had already been heard and the case was adjourned to a later date for further arguments.</p>

<p>Stopped by the Shop Owner Outside</p>
<p>Sentenced to Four Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Li Ronggen, from Yixing, rented a bicycle from Liu Xingyu's bicycle shop at 2600 Yangshupu Road on the morning of the first of this month at 10:00 AM. He rode it to the front of the cigarette and paper shop at 816 Taopeng Road. Li got off the bicycle and entered the shop, claiming he wanted to exchange silver dollars. The shop owner, Wang Laifu, was out, so Wang's wife came forward to transact the business. Li, seeing that the woman was easily deceived, jumped into the shop and robbed thirty-six cents in coins from the counter. He did not have time to take any more. He then jumped on the original bicycle and fled. At that time, Wang Laifu, the shop owner, was returning from outside and saw Li fleeing from the shop. Hearing his wife shouting "thief," he immediately stopped Li and handed him over to the Chinese constable at 1944. The constable searched him and found the stolen goods. Yesterday morning, the plaintiff and Liu Xingyu were summoned and brought before the Special District Court. After questioning by Judge Xiao, Li was sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The bicycle was returned to Liu Xingyu.</p>

<p>Little Yangzi Suffers All Kinds of Hardship</p>
<p>Wang Gu's Family Arrested by Officials</p>
<p>Wang Lumeng, from Xinghua, lives on a boat at the Huiguan Wharf in the South City. He has a son who is currently fourteen years old. Seven years ago, a female fellow villager named Gu brought her daughter, Little Yangzi (now thirteen years old), to the Wang family to be a child bride due to hardship in their hometown. Wang's wife, Gu, is forty-nine years old and is inherently violent. Throughout the year, regardless of wind or snow, she forces Little Yangzi to go out and scavenge and even to steal. If Little Yangzi slightly displeases her, she is whipped,</p>
<p>leaving her covered in injuries and living in a hellish situation all day long. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, Gu again beat her arbitrarily on the wharf because she did not bring back valuable items from scavenging in the morning, and prevented her from crying out. A large crowd gathered to watch, and seeing this situation, they felt aggrieved and stepped forward to dissuade her. However, Gu instead cursed at them, saying it was none of their business, which aroused public anger. The crowd immediately reported the incident to Xiao Enpei, the watchman at the 15th post in the area. Xiao Enpei detained Gu and took her along with Little Yangzi to the First Section of the First District, where the section chief questioned her during a preliminary hearing. Wang Gu confessed that she had given twelve yuan</p>

<p>and one dou of white rice and six bolts of cloth to marry Little Yangzi as a daughter-in-law. Since she was the aunt, she was only giving slight discipline to Little Yangzi when she did not perform her duties properly. It was observed that Little Yangzi had injuries all over her body and a swollen face. The case involved injury, and an official report was prepared and submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Counterfeiting "White Lady" Brand Perfume <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Four Months Imprisonment and a Thousand Yuan Fine</p>
<p>Li Zhaofen Unhappy and Has Appealed</p>
<p>"White Lady" brand hair tonic manufactured by the British Atkinson Limited has been exclusively distributed by Lulin &amp; Co. on Jiangxi Road in this city for many years. Ladies from all walks of life enjoy purchasing this item as a cosmetic for its high quality and fragrant aroma. However, Li Zhaofen, a Cantonese shareholder and manager of Qichang Company, was seized by greed. He imitated and sold counterfeit products. The trademarks pasted on the bottles were especially similar. The drawing on the Lulin bottle is printed on green paper and shows a white-clothed maiden standing gracefully, with a long skirt trailing on the ground, her feet hidden and her head resembling a flying canopy, holding a violin and pretending to play it. The upper, lower, and middle sections of the drawing are printed in Western languages. The drawing on the Qichang bottle is also printed on green paper and shows a white-clothed maiden standing next to it, but her clothes only reach her knees and she is wearing leather shoes. This is slightly different, but other features such as her short, frizzy hair and the musical instrument she is holding are almost identical. If buyers do not examine the products carefully, it will be difficult to distinguish between the genuine and counterfeit products. Lulin &amp; Co. only recently discovered the counterfeit products on the market. If they are not strictly investigated, it will have a significant impact on their business. Furthermore, the hair tonic they distribute has already been registered and should be protected by the government. It is inappropriate for others to imitate it, so they specially reported the case to the police for a secret investigation. The Hui Division Police Department investigated and confirmed that the factory where Qichang Company was counterfeiting the cosmetic products was located at 239 to 241 Haining Road, and the distribution point was located in a certain room at 141 Tiantong Road. The police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to search both locations last Thursday. They seized over eighty large boxes of counterfeit hair tonic, printed trademark drawings, and empty bottles for filling the water. In addition, they also seized genuine drawings from Lulin &amp; Co., presumably used as models for the counterfeit products. Li Zhaofen was arrested and handed over to the Special District Court. Judge Luo Renji ordered him to be released on bail of four thousand yuan in cash pending trial. The day before yesterday, Judge Luo Renji held a court hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunji stated that the evidence in this case was sufficient and requested that he be punished for counterfeiting trademarks under Article 268 of the Criminal Code. Lulin &amp; Co. also retained lawyers Lu Congzu and Wheeler to appear in court and stated that they would like to reserve the private prosecution portion of the case. The defendant only admitted to imitating and claimed that it was not counterfeiting, and he retained a lawyer to defend him. Subsequently, the lawyers for both the plaintiff and the victim presented various legal arguments based on the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, proving that imitation was no different from counterfeiting. Judge Luo then repeatedly reviewed the genuine and counterfeit trademark drawings submitted as evidence and determined that the defendant's counterfeiting was indeed true. He immediately sentenced him to four months of imprisonment and imposed a fine of one thousand yuan as a warning. The defendant declared in court that he would appeal. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that if the defendant requested bail during the appeal period, the bail amount should be increased. The defendant increased the cash bail by three thousand yuan, totaling seven thousand yuan, and was allowed to be released on bail pending appeal review.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Requested the French Envoy to Stop Obstructing</p>
<p>Previous reports have noted the repeated delays by the French Court in the request by the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office to send officers to Shanghai to extradite the bandit leader Zhi Xiaotao.

<h3 id="e200">Pre-Arbitration Consultation on the Sinking of the Dachang <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Issues for the Arbitrators</p>
<p>Following the sinking of the Dachang vessel after being struck by the Dahua vessel, the matter of liability is to be submitted to arbitration. The Dahua and Pingan companies have jointly requested the Shanghai Shipping Association to establish the arbitration regulations and the arbitration committee. Now, Pingan Company asserts that the managers of both parties should be the arbitration representatives, with the Association appointing another representative. Dahua Company, however, contends that the managers are not shipping experts and that specialists should be appointed instead. The correspondence between the two parties is as follows:</p>
<p>Pingan Company Letter: In response to your company's letter of May 29th, which stated that both parties should send a responsible representative to the Shipping Association to discuss the terms of the arbitration agreement, we are in agreement and have been instructed by your company to promptly set a date. We must clarify that the so-called responsible representative refers to the managers of both companies. In addition to the managers of both parties discussing the terms in person, we also request that the Shipping Association send a representative to attend. No other person may participate. If there is no objection, please have the Shipping Association select a date and notify both parties one week in advance. Addressed to: Dahua Company, from Pingan Company, June 5th.</p>
<p>Dahua Company Letter: In response to your company's letter of the 5th of this month regarding the section that both parties should send a responsible representative to the Shipping Association to discuss the terms of the arbitration agreement. It mentioned that the so-called responsible representative refers to the managers of both companies. In addition to the managers of both parties discussing the terms in person, we also request that the Shipping Association send a representative to attend, and no other person may participate. We must say, that the responsible representative, while the managers of both parties have never not been an element that can be delegated, it must be viewed if a person is capable of fulfilling their role or not. If it must be the managers of both companies, it would be a limited view that they would be able to restrict one another and that this makes one suspicious of the narrow view, and how easily this is handled. Regarding this contract representative, it concerns the continuation of the arbitration to the point that it is of great importance, and the interest of the company in this situation has a intimate relationship. It is appropriate to choose who has the most outstanding and clear view of reason to take on this role. To handle the situation formally it would be free of any oversight that the internal transfer of workers of the company could deal with it to the sufficient extent. In this role, it does not necessarily need to be a company manager. If the company managers are competent, that will do, otherwise it would work to have other people be competent. The term responsible representative, entails to shoulder the responsibility for the whole situation. Should this person be someone whose qualifications are someone the company trusts they would already be appointed by the company freely. Therefore, the agreement of the other would not be necessary. So wherefore this limitation for the other party? In national regulations the court still works this way. We would think that your company would not be stubborn in their views and would generously include them. Thus, aside from saying that the representatives of both sides does not have to only be the company managers, to respect the issues surrounding this contract, and to better gather ideas and incorporate legal issues, there is a proposal: to designate two responsible representatives and one legal advisor/lawyer of legal representatives to be sent by each company. Again, this is to be assigned by the shipping association for one last representative to attend. If agreed, both sides can send a letter to the union to select a date a week in advance to notify the people to attend this conference, to facilitate both parties to arrange the handlings for the procedure, which is more thorough and the dispositions are fair. There will not be any more unexpected twists and turns. If your company is not of this opinion and awaits other conditions, then we may consider submitting this proposal to the Union in advance to resolve to avoid the delay that would hinder this affair of public interest. Addressed to Ping An Company, from Dahua Company</p>

<p>Since construction began, the northern part of Shanghai on Songhu Road has been largely completed and is now being paved with gravel, so the completion of the entire road is imminent. The Shanghai County Construction Bureau has now found that there is a Huibing Bridge located at the intersection of Songjiang and Shanghai on the road. It was destroyed in the Jiazi Rebellion, cutting off land traffic. Now that the northern part of the road in this county is about to be completed and Songjiang is also under construction, the construction of the Huibing Bridge is imperative. Furthermore, long-distance buses on the Songhu Road are preparing to operate. Director Wu, in accordance with the promulgated drawings, designed a concrete and steel bridge. However, the estimated cost is very large, and the construction funds in this county have been almost completely depleted, making fundraising difficult. Yesterday, Wu submitted a document to the county government along with the bridge drawings and budget, requesting that it be forwarded to the Jiangsu Construction Department for review and approval.</p>

<p>The chiefs and police officers of the second section of the third district of Yangjing Town have recently become more diligent in their duties. They patrol the old and new opium dens and gambling houses, disguised or waiting in ambush day and night. A few days ago, when searching Pan Axiang's and A Tong's opium dens, the dispatched chiefs and police officers fearlessly climbed onto the roof and broke down walls, as if facing a major enemy. None escaped. As a result, four opium dens and two gambling houses have been raided in recent days, and thirty to forty opium users and gamblers have been arrested. The town's atmosphere of drugs and gambling has been slightly curbed. However, cases of theft in the countryside are still frequent. If the chiefs and police officers paid more attention, the residents would be even more grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e212">The Ninetieth Birthday of the London Library <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Fu Lan</p>
<p>The world-famous London Library celebrated its ninetieth anniversary at the beginning of last month. In 1841, it occupied only two rooms and had only three thousand books. Ninety years later, the library stands majestically on St. James's Square, with over 450,000 books. Looking back on the past, it is truly worth commemorating.</p>
<p>Dr. C. T. Hagbery Wright has been the librarian of the library since 1893 and is the most experienced and qualified librarian. He recently gave an interview to the London Morning Post, stating the London Library's two golden rules: (1) never buy a new novel, and (2) never sell a book.</p>
<p>(We do not want to satisfy readers' fleeting needs for new novels, he said. (We do not want to compete with commercial lending libraries, so we have made a rule that we will not buy a novel until it has been published for less than six months, and we will never buy more than three copies of the same book in the future.</p>
<p>(If readers come to ask to read a book on the day it is published and we want to satisfy everyone's needs, then the library may not be able to stand firm. For example, several years ago, almost two thousand members simultaneously requested a biography of Lord Roberts. We would have had to purchase two thousand copies, which would have resulted in a huge loss.</p>
<p>(No matter how great the novelist's reputation is, we must wait six months after publication before we buy his books. Even Thackeray and T. Hardy cannot escape this exception.</p>
<p>(I have also made a rule), he said, (never sell or destroy a book. In certain circumstances, when the need for a certain book seems to have disappeared, we put these books in the (cold palace) and let them stay there for seven years. If there is still no need for them during this period, then we send them to the library in Sicily.)</p>
<p>In the past ninety years, the characteristics of the London Library have remained the same, but the people who read have changed. In 1841, women accounted for only three percent of the members, but now they account for a larger proportion.</p>
<p>In the first year of the London Library's establishment, Carlyle and Macanley were both fully engrossed in the library. Carlyle had a bad habit of borrowing books and often refusing to return them. In addition, Gladstone prepared the first step of his religious history in the library. Thackeray's inspection of the books for two years was a valuable record.</p>
<p>The most dangerous period in the history of the London Library was the Crimean War. At that time, the number of members decreased to an alarming number in a short period of time, so the purchase of new books was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>It currently has more than four thousand members and no longer worries about standing firm. It is now planning the construction of new buildings to store the steady stream of new books from 1931 to 2081.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Eastern News Records the Chinese Silk Industry <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shiohara lists the advantages and disadvantages of silkworm rearing and silk reeling. According to the Eastern News, Mr. Katsumi Shiohara, the director of the Suwa Silk Reeling Research Association in Japan, recently inspected the Chinese silk industry and visited the silk industry in Beijing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou before returning. He said that China has a vast land and mulberry trees grow very well, so there is great hope for it to become a silk country in the future. However, there are also many shortcomings due to the Chinese national character and national conditions. Japan is afraid of what it needs to be afraid of in the distant future. The shortcomings of China's silkworm rearing aspect are: (1) the structure of the silkworm rearing house is not suitable for breeding, and its transformation is difficult due to various circumstances; (2) no artificial prevention methods are used for the climate; (3) silkworm varieties are weak in resistance to low temperature and high humidity. Its advantages are: (1) mulberry trees grow very well; (2) silkworm varieties are still suitable for seriprene-based silk quality; (3) labor costs are low, about 1.1 to 1.5 yuan per day. The shortcomings of silk reeling are: (1) silk reeling methods are poor, and cocoon cooking is especially poor; (2) the construction and improvement of factories are about four times more expensive than the price of village wood. Its characteristics are: (1) compared to the poor cocoons, the raw silk fineness is fine and the annual knots are still good; (2) all expenses are borne by women, about 0.3 yuan or less to about 0.1 yuan; (3) the silk reeling machine, six or seven seats, is a French iron product, far superior to Japan. In addition, the facilities of public silk improvement farms are quite amazing, but the silkworm rearers and silk reelers in the private sector are deeply superstitious and quite naive.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Algerian Matches Beaten Down by Russian Goods <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Two factories closed, one reduced exports by 70 percent</p>
<p>Paris News: The dumping of Soviet industrial products abroad is all-encompassing. The European market has been greatly affected. The match industry in French Algeria has gradually become unable to stand firm in recent years due to the squeeze of Russian goods. The Algerian Chamber of Commerce recently requested the French government to take measures to protect it. Major newspapers in Paris, such as the Morning News, etc., strongly advocated taking strong actions to restrict the import of Soviet matches into Algeria and restrict the import of general Russian goods into France. Algeria has a large match factory, one of which has been closed and the other has also reduced shipments, barely maintaining it. In the past three years, the amount of Algerian matches exported to other French colonies has fallen by 70 percent, all due to the invasion of Russian goods. According to the Morning News, Russian matches are masquerading as Algerian matches in boxes with the Algerian label. Algerian consumers cannot distinguish them. Even the Algerian match manufacturers initially did not suspect their origin. It was only after a long time that they discovered that they were Russian goods. French newspapers also reported that the United States and Belgium impose heavy taxes on foreign matches, and the United Kingdom is also considering methods.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Marshal Foch's War Diary <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The German attack on March 21st wanted to cut off the British and French lines. The first step of our army was to quickly stop it. After success, the second step was to systematically arrange defense lines and compile reserve troops to consolidate the new positions. The important task after this was to recover the lost land to ensure that the supply of military and civilian food was not harmed by the enemy.</p>
<p>Therefore, on April 3rd, I ordered Commander-in-Chief Haig and General Pétain to set up a strong defense line north of the Somme River and take an offensive south of the Somme River to relieve the crisis in Amiens. In principle, April 12th was decided as the date of attack, but we expected that it would not be possible to implement it as scheduled.</p>
<p>On April 9th, another major battle broke out in Armentières. On that day, the German Fourth Army (led by Sixt von Armin) attacked the positions between Bixschoote and Armentières with nine divisions. The defending soldiers were three British divisions and one Portuguese division belonging to the British First Army (led by Horne).</p>
<p>While the troops were being transferred, they were suddenly attacked by the enemy. The Portuguese division was caught off guard and was defeated. The British defense line was cut off and the enemy directly forced their way to Laventie from the center. They were eventually attacked and progressed to the Lys River between Estaires and Sailly-sur-la-Lys. On the 10th, the enemy continued to attack and joined five new divisions. They developed north to Messines. Therefore, the enemy's attack range included the right wing of the British Second Army (led by Plumer), Armentières and Messines fell one after another. The enemy then crossed the Lys River. The battle line stretched for fifteen miles from Doulieu to Estaires, advancing westward towards Hazebrouck.</p>
