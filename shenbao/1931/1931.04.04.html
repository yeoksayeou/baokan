<p>梁君示余以陣亡將士紀念堂專陳壁畫室之木製模型室爲長方體兩端略作圓形屋頂一面受光室内兩端又建一高台距壁稍遠以便瀏覽蓋壁畫篇幅甚大不宜近視也其畫材爲革命戰役每次均取一激烈而重要之一幕以爲代表經蔣主席核定者有棉湖戰役惠州戰役丁泗橋戰役南昌戰役徐州戰役濟南戰役濟寗戰役等此外梁君之意尚須再作歸德戰役蘭封戰役二幅刻因畫布定貨未到故事徴集諸役吏實材料業已繪就草稿多幅</p>
<p>梁君於此大壁畫工作尚有一發明即透視線條器也因其製作大壁畫時每苦透視線條之不正確發明此器成功頗佳法以一小電燈泡之前横懸一黑線其下置一繪有黑線條方格之木板以此横黑線之影吻合於木板所繪之線則一端即已顯於畫布之上梁君云此法至便俟其大壁畫完成之後尚須將此透視畫的新工具供獻社會也惜吾人不及於夜間實騐之</p>

<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>但是我們在實行這個戰略之前我們不能忘記我們東綫的聯軍俄軍的積極參戰牽制了大部分的敵軍使我們能夠得着馬爾内的勝利我們在可能的範圍裏去援助他們是我們的責任這就是我們此後作戰的方針結果如何在所不計我們雖没有到取得勝利的地步我們至少可以牽制西綫的敵人無暇東調東綫的决戰可以成爲敵人全部的勝利先聲</p>
<p>但是東西兩線的作戰如何呼應我完全須視法軍總司令的訓令不像在北面我們的攻勢戰由我方動我現在的職務是遵循霞飛將軍的主張與英比聯軍切實合作指揮戰事……</p>
<p>我軍離開北面戰區調到後方休養或歸總司令分配的很多我乘機去看看他們我常是召集軍官在一起談話雖則在一冬天惡戰之後軍官和士卒仍是一樣的精神煥發不勝可嘉他們完全了解在頁普里和頁石爾河推翻敵人的計劃的重要戰績他們深信在他們目前的攻擊裏定能克敵制勝他們溢於眉宇的自信心很足動人</p>
<p>一月十七日震飛將軍因汽車互撞受傷很足以引起嚴重的結果我們同乘一輛汽車沿着從魯斯佈路治到但基克的路上行駛一輛重貨車指駛齒輪拆斷突然阻塞途中兩車相撞總司令受了重傷他不得不把巡閱放棄改乘火車回到羅密萊他的司令部我幸告無恙但是我很爲我的長官担憂我在但基克車站離開他之後此心尤切幸而隔了幾天他完全復原了</p>
<p>出事後我即寫信給陸軍部長我是總司令的助理這是應當的在信裏我問他倘使霞飛將軍因此不能繼續指揮戰事我應什樣辦假使這樣的情形果然發生前綫那一個軍官將負責籌劃應急之策因爲敵人隨時可以乘隙而動回信通知我不必爲偶然之事關心因爲政府對此早已有了準備了實則在八月裏加里尼將軍已内定爲總司令的繼人他雖則絶頂聰明才力過人在戰爭裏不過參與極小部分尤其在壕溝戰裏面政治家對於軍人决定意見太速品定軍官的唯一地方是在戰場上唯有他們的戰績是他們的能力的度量</p>
<p>十二月初英政府向法政府表示希望把法蘭特的英軍調遣到更北的戰區他們可在海岸附近防守一部分的聯軍陣線他們的左翼尤其可以海爲憑藉這樣的調動想來可使英國的輿論滿意</p>
<p>在比國海岸從亞司墩到齊佈魯治大不列顚常受敵人襲擊的危險以英軍沿海岸向亞司墩的海軍根據地攻擊最足以抵禦這種恐懼英海軍大臣邱吉爾君對這計劃尤爲重視英軍總司令法蘭樞約翰爵士次之法軍總司令霞飛將軍又次之</p>
<p>他們兩人看到英軍的主力專施於祇關海戰的目標而脫離對聯軍的勁敵｜德國陸軍｜的戰鬥頗屬不智這戰鬥在三個月内就將决定大戰的命運在這些情形之下從長討論之後决定在十二月後半月裏英軍一面把拉牌西的右翼維持一面利用本國開到的援軍與法國第八軍調防法軍把原有的軍隊留在紐埠不過逐步把頁普时凸角的軍隊撤退祇留一支隊在意爾佛丁揷在英軍的左翼與比軍的右翼之間</p>
<p>後來這調防計劃在實行上第一因爲英國援軍開到的遲緩遇着絶大躭擱陸軍大臣姬起納侯爵祇願把已經完全編成師或軍圑的隊伍開到大陸法蘭樞總指揮則很願他們編成營來軍火的缺乏也使總指揮在擴張陣線上頗感棘手英國製造軍火的進步遲緩尤其使他十分憂慮</p>
<p>其時英海軍大臣想把他的進攻亞司墩的計劃重新考慮願意以海軍陸戰隊三千援兵供給紐埠的法軍支隊霞飛將軍仍舊主張有陸地目標的戰爭更爲重要且謂拉牌西區域裏在我們第十軍的左翼英軍的兵力儘可善自指揮他因請法蘭樞約翰爵士贊同兩點就是英軍陣綫的擴張和在法軍攻擊裏切實合作</p>
<p>戰事的進展因聯軍火和戰爭材料析缺乏而阻滯前面已經說過戰爭停頓的延長和民間因此發生憂慮曾使某内閣參加指揮戰事悞入歧路因使最高軍司令工作更爲困難又因我們缺乏材料遂發生嚴重的影響</p>
<p>兵士設備和軍火供給成爲近世戰爭裏最重要的問題他們一定在最高軍司令的主見裏佔據卓越的地位非但關於迎敵方面且關於民心或政府震動的時候維持戰事</p>
<p>這種錯綜複雜的結果英軍到正月底祇更替法國第十六軍圑較互相同意的進行慢了不少法國第九和第二十軍圑還没有替代這種形勢直到三月中旬没有顯著的變更不過在那天英國第一軍在拉牌西區域裏進攻準備完畢進行中的談判就此中斷非到這種計劃有了結果不能恢復</p>
<p>海格將軍指揮英國第一軍奉令進攻軍隊在三月十日向前開拔起先他們略見得手以後幾天裏他們就不能進展甚至於不能完全支持了</p>
<p>三月十二｜十三夜間海格將軍下令停止攻擊但須固守十日佔領的陣地英國第一軍司令的决定據說是因爲恐怕軍火不濟和士卒損失太大</p>
<p>現在可以回到更替頁普里週圍的法軍圑的計劃了法蘭樞約翰爵士·姬起納候爵·霞飛將軍·和米羅蘭君在常鐵萊會議决定英國第二軍在四月二十日以前更替法國第九和第二十軍圑新編英軍兩師調到法國法軍四月底在亞篤亞舉行進攻進行甚速四月七日第九軍圑已從前綫撤退向第十軍戰區開拔四月十九日第二十軍圑隨之調防到了四月底聯軍在北面重新配置完畢</p>
<p>英軍從拉牌亞運河到頁普里路上的蒲卡堡佈防他們分成兩軍南面第一軍海格杜格拉斯爵士指揮北面第二軍史密斯多里安將軍指揮</p>
<p>法國第八軍已在四月四日潰散現由浦兹將軍率領比軍支隊更替該隊分兩支一支在意爾佛丁比英兩軍之間另一支在紐埠聯軍陣綫之極左翼</p>
<p>比軍經我的請求現已答允擴張陣幾從法軍防守的紐埠以至斯丁斯曲里比軍士氣自從開到頁石爾河之後續有進步比皇仍抱同樣的决心比軍雖則不能擔任大規模的戰鬥他們至少可助一臂之力他們自從三月初就是這樣做的自三月十一日到四月十一日在一個足月裏他們奉命作戰絶不停頓他們的攻擊雖没有多大成績他們至少能在比軍裏發展一種勇爲的精神證明他們有克盡厥職的志願况且這種動作一定能在敵人方面發生劇烈的反應</p>
<p>我們同比軍司令官和比國各級軍級發生了密切的關係其結果就使兩軍一德一心在緊要時候可有很好的影響</p>
<p>正月裏比軍總司令部因其地常受敵人的砲火猛烈的轟擊才退出佛爾内斯遷移到霍墩徧僻的地方皇上皇后以及皇子等駐節在拉朋納爲海邊的一個城鎭離開霍墩不遠他每天到總司令部駐節在雷墩的長老會裏他的幾個軍官也住在那裏（未完）</p>

<p>The National Government, on the 3rd, issued an order stating:  The abolishment of likin and all similar taxes has been a major national policy, and the relevant ministries and departments have already followed orders to implement this on schedule. If provincial governments are still found to be disobeying previous orders to abolish likin, or are cleverly establishing new names to collect various taxes similar to likin without authorization, the Supervisory Yuan should be instructed to dispatch personnel to investigate and submit reports for punishment, in order to emphasize the importance of orders and discipline. This order also states: The abolishment of likin and all similar taxes was previously ordered to be implemented before January 1st of this year, with the original intention of relieving the long-standing suffering of the people. Therefore, this corrupt practice must be thoroughly eliminated. However, the previous likin abolition conference had a resolution to implement a special consumption tax after the abolition of likin. Now, after careful consideration, there is still concern that the implementation of this new tax may follow old bad habits and become a disguised form of likin, which would violate the original intention. Therefore, it should be announced in a timely manner that the implementation will be waived to demonstrate the government's increased concern for the welfare of merchants and the people. This order also states: Zhang Zheng, Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Government, has been assigned to another position, and Zhang Zheng should be relieved of his current post. This order also states: Yin Chaozhen is appointed as the Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Government.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Liu Xiang Sends Troops to Quell the Rebellion <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang's Troops Occupy Hechuan and Bishan</p>
<p>The Two Lius Cooperate to Break the Defense Zone System</p>
<p>Chongqing:  Since the mediation of the Sichuan affairs was ineffective, Liu Xiang urgently telegraphed the Central Government to request instructions on whether to lead troops to quell the rebellion under the name of Post-War Rehabilitation Supervisor (2nd-day special telegram).</p>
<p>Chongqing:  Liu Xiang was ordered to use armed force to stop the Sichuan war. Division Commander Wang Zuanxu moved towards Wusheng and Tongnan, Pan Wenhua went to Hechuan, and Tang Shizun went to Tongliang and Dazu. They will wait for the Central Government's orders on whether to advance after reaching Shunqing and Suining (2nd-day special telegram).</p>
<p>Nanjing:  Military News (1) Liu Xiang's troops, Wang Zuanxu's division, occupied Hechuan on the 2nd, and Lan Wenbin's division occupied Bishan. Chen Dingxun's division of Deng Xihou's troops retreated to Dazhu. (2) Chen Guangzao's division of Liu Wenhui's troops occupied Suining, and Tian Songyao's troops occupied Xiqiang. (3) Li Qixiang retreated to Shunqing and Pengxi waiting for reinforcements. Their strength was not damaged. (4) Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou remained neutral, awaiting orders from the Central Government. Also, Liu Wenhui used the name of the Provincial Government to attack Li Qixiang. Liu Xiang sent troops to aid Li. On the surface, it seems like a conflict, but in reality, the two Lius are cooperating to take this opportunity to break the defense zone system to seek a thorough solution to the Sichuan issue (3rd-day Central News Agency telegram).</p>
<p>Chongqing: Deng Xihou's troops had internal strife. Deng and Tian Songyao agreed to send troops to attack Li Jiayu. Huayang, Jianyang, Lezhi, Suining, and Xiqiang were successively occupied by Tian and Deng. Liu Xiang repeatedly telegraphed to mediate because post-war demobilization was imminent, but it was ineffective. The Central Government ordered Liu to take responsibility for stopping it, so he sent Tang Shizun, Wang Zuanxu, Pan Wenhua, and Lan Wenbin to Wusheng, Hechuan, Bishan, and Tongliang respectively to conduct armed mediation. However, Chen Shunong violated the order and resisted. Liu Xiang persuaded him on the one hand and ordered the various troops to advance at full speed on the other. The vanguard has already passed Bishan. The people of Sichuan are eagerly hoping that Liu Xiang will send troops to quell the rebellion and unify Sichuan (2nd-day Central News Agency telegram).</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Headquarters received a telegram from Sichuan stating that Tian Songyao supports the Central Government extremely sincerely. The 29th Army has left Southern Shaanxi (3rd-day Central News Agency telegram).</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Nanjing: Li Qixiang telegraphed his representative in Beijing, Guo Yunlou, on the 1st, stating that his division near Lezhi, with two mixed brigades and seven battalions, defeated Li Yushu's troops commanded by Chen Guangzao. Near Tongxianchang, with one mixed brigade and two regiments, they repelled the Chen and Lin brigades. Near Pengxi, with three mixed brigades and one regiment from the Chen regiment, they repelled Tian Songyao's troops.

<p>Changsha: Minister He Yingqin telegraphed from the 30th, briefly stating that the Li bandit Mingrui had recently sneaked back into Chongyi and Suichuan.

<h3 id="e29">Re-discussing the Nicaraguan Disaster <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Since last year, the world has experienced a continuous series of irresistible natural disasters, is this a major catastrophe for humanity? The earthquake disaster in the capital of Nicaragua this time is especially tragic. Although the US Navy and aircraft have made efforts to provide relief, according to today's telegram, the relief efforts are also greatly difficult. There are dangers everywhere, and the presidential palace on the mountain peak is also tilted and about to collapse. Moreover, there were several more earthquakes this morning, and the fire has not been extinguished for three days. As a result, people are becoming more and more panicked. Although food and medicine are gradually being transported in, there are still concerns that they will not be enough. Clean water is also unavailable, and the number of deaths continues to increase as they are dug up, and has increased to more than 5,000. Among the more than 30,000 disaster victims who have taken refuge outside the city, many are poorly clothed, and sanitary facilities are completely gone. Corpses are exposed, and a stench fills the air. There is also fear of a sudden outbreak of epidemics. This is truly a tragic situation in the world. Helping those in need and having compassion for our neighbors is what the ancients valued. How much more so today, when the world is a global village with no distinction between ourselves and others. How will the people of all countries express their sympathy and provide assistance? What we are especially concerned about is that today's telegram from Nicaragua's capital stated that the investigation of the situation of overseas Chinese here has yielded no results, and after many visits, no overseas Chinese were encountered. It is speculated that those who were lucky enough to escape have moved elsewhere, and those who were buried in the fire and rubble were immediately buried by the rescue team without time to distinguish between nationalities and races, so it is not known the full extent of the disaster. There are also quite a few overseas Chinese in villages and towns outside the city, but their fate is still unknown due to traffic disruptions. The foreign telegram described it as such, then we know that the number of our compatriots residing in Nicaragua who have been affected by the disaster is unknown, and how many can be lucky enough to remain safe is still unknown. Our people have always been separated from overseas compatriots, and the number of our people residing in Nicaragua's capital is also unknown. Then today's alarm telegram makes us even more worried.</p>

Wu Tiecheng, on behalf of the central government, supervised the oath and delivered a training speech, the general idea of which was that although the Northeast Party Department has not yet been established, the Northeast comrades have been participating in the revolution for many years without interruption, which can be said to be that there are revolutionary facts first and then the establishment of the Party Department. The Northeast is the gateway to China, and Jilin Province should especially be at the forefront of the Russo-Japanese invasion. The work of the Northeast comrades is actually the frontline soldiers of China's conservation gateway, and they must unite to defend against the invasion of the red and white imperialism. Regarding the sabotage of our country's unification and division by Japan and the Russian Communist Party, our unity should instruct and lead the people of the whole province to resist to the greatest extent, and we must not have local views and fall into their tricks. Special attention should be paid to the Communist Party's deception of the masses and the seduction of young people, and strict prevention should be taken (3rd-day Central News Agency telegram).</p>

<p>Briand Will Abandon His Passive Attitude</p>
<p>Suggests Forming an Economic Alliance of Various Nations</p>
<p>Geneva, 2nd (Guomin News Agency): According to observations from various sources, the League of Nations Council meeting in May will have more significant events than discussing the German-Austrian customs union. According to highly reliable sources, French Foreign Minister Briand will abandon his passive attitude and adopt proactive measures to resist the German-Austrian customs union. Specifically, he will propose forming an economic alliance between Germany, Austria, France, and other nations. After careful consideration, the French Foreign Ministry believes that the German-Austrian customs union draft does not actually conflict with the peace treaty. Even if it undergoes review by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, it may not be found to violate the 1922 Geneva Treaty. Therefore, the French Foreign Minister feels that opposing the German-Austrian customs union is not as good as renewing efforts to realize the Pan-European Union.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Nicaraguan Capital Reduced to Ruins After Earthquake <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Deaths Number Around a Thousand</p>
<p>Scorching Sun Reigns Supreme, Earthquakes Occur Intermittently</p>
<p>Capital Will Be Moved to León</p>
<p>Rebel Party Declares Ceasefire</p>
<p>Managua, 2nd (Guomin News Agency): The earthquake and fire have reduced this place to ruins. The exact number of casualties is still difficult to ascertain. Reliable sources estimate the number of deaths to be between seven hundred and one thousand, but some speculate that it exceeds two thousand five hundred. It is estimated that there are about two thousand seriously injured and several thousand slightly injured. American women and children are being transported by planes and warships to Panama for transfer back to the United States, which should be completed by tomorrow evening. Weak earthquakes still occur here from time to time, and the scorching sun reigns supreme, with temperatures nearing one hundred degrees. Thick smoke fills the sky, and a foul smell is everywhere. The water is polluted and undrinkable, further hindering relief efforts. The fire has been burning for three consecutive days and is expected to be extinguished soon. The authorities have ordered all residents who can go to other cities to leave. Many corpses have not been buried in time and are piled up for cremation to prevent the spread of disease. American army and navy planes continue to carry medicine and food here, and warships are expected to arrive within the next day or two. Temporary shelters have been established in the more distant areas outside the city to house many disaster victims, while foreign nationals will be transported out of the country as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Managua, 2nd (Guomin News Agency): Today's investigation into the situation of the local overseas Chinese has yielded no results. After visiting for a long time, no overseas Chinese were encountered. It is expected that those who survived have moved elsewhere. As for those who perished in the fire and rubble this time, their limbs are incomplete and unrecognizable. After the rescue team retrieved the bodies, they were buried in a pile without distinguishing their nationality or race. Therefore, it is not known how many overseas Chinese there are. There are many overseas Chinese in the villages and towns outside the capital, but their fate is unknown due to the interruption of transportation.</p>
<p>Managua, 2nd (Reuters): The U.S. Navy Marines estimate that there are one thousand dead and one thousand injured in the earthquake. The President of Nicaragua estimates the material losses to be worth three million pounds. However, the loss of life and property is not as great as previously estimated. About 30,000 disaster victims are temporarily taking refuge outside the city, many of whom are scantily clad. Sanitary facilities have been destroyed, and corpses have been exposed for many days, raising concerns about the outbreak of an epidemic. Compulsory vaccination is now being enforced.</p>
<p>Managua, 2nd (Reuters): U.S. Army Medical Corpsman Balladman estimates that there are two thousand dead in the earthquake. Relief efforts are currently being handled by the U.S. Army Medical Corps. The task is difficult and extremely dangerous because there are dangerous walls everywhere that could collapse at any time. The presidential palace, built on a mountain peak, is now also tilted and in a very dangerous state. If there is another strong earthquake, it will collapse into the shallow lake at the foot of the mountain. It will take several years to rebuild Managua. It is said that the capital of Nicaragua will be moved to Granada. Food and medicine are gradually being transported in, and there is no shortage of doctors. However, clean drinking water is difficult to obtain, which could lead to disease. Beer is now being used as a beverage to replace water. There were several more earthquakes this morning, and many dangerous walls collapsed, increasing the fear of the disaster victims. Fires often break out everywhere, and the rumor that rebel General Liang Tieluo is leading troops to attack the city has made people even more uneasy.</p>
<p>New York, 2nd (Reuters): According to news from Mexico City, Nicaraguan rebel leader Liang Tieluo telegraphed his representative in Mexico, stating that he had issued an order to cease attacks in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Managua, 3rd (Reuters): Corpses are being excavated from the rubble and transported by trucks in an endless stream. Therefore, the estimated number of deaths has now increased to over five thousand, but this number has not been confirmed by officials. More than a thousand people died in the vegetable market alone.</p>

<p>French Ship Suffers More Damage</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Reuters): Regarding the incident in which the British aircraft carrier HMS Courageous sank the French merchant ship SS Florida outside Gibraltar yesterday, news from various sources conflicts regarding the number of casualties. The French shipping company sent a telegram from Marseille stating that although the ship was hit, there were no deaths. When the ship was towed to Malaga, it was found that the damage was not as severe as initially thought. A telegram from Malaga stated that only one person died on the British ship and no aircraft were lost. The damage to the French merchant ship was not light. However, the British Admiralty received a report from the British ship stating that 23 passengers in the lower hold of the French ship were missing. One Syrian died on the British ship. After the collision, four aircraft from the British ship fell into the sea, but the personnel were rescued. A subsequent telegram from Malaga stated that HMS Courageous arrived there at 6:00 AM, carrying 500 French ship passengers. It is estimated that about 30 passengers died, including 11 Italians, one Spaniard, and the rest are thought to be French or Portuguese. No British people died.</p>
<p>Malaga, 2nd (Reuters): During maneuvers by the British Mediterranean Fleet, an aircraft from a British ship fell into the sea. The aircraft carrier HMS Courageous sailed to rescue it at a speed of about 30 knots, unexpectedly colliding with the French ship SS Florida, which was traveling at a speed of 15 knots. The French ship's port side was mostly broken. The British ship's bow was slightly damaged. One crew member died on the spot, and several others were injured. Tonight, the British ship sailed back to Gibraltar, carrying two dead and seven injured because the climate here is unfavorable for landing.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Cracks Within the German National Socialist Party Become Increasingly Apparent <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Guomin News Agency): The split within the National Socialist Party is becoming increasingly apparent. The Munich headquarters of the party and the North German paramilitary group, the so-called Stormtroopers, have increasingly conflicting opinions. This afternoon, Sterdni, the leader of the defecting members, issued a declaration strongly attacking the Munich headquarters' collusion with the propertied class, saying that it had lost the original purpose of the National Socialist Party. After Sterdni's declaration was published, the leader of the Munich headquarters, Hitler, immediately announced that the party would not tolerate traitors and could not stand with the Bolsheviks. The northern political leader, Goebbels, has been ordered by Hitler to carry out a purge, but the results are currently difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Seiyukai Decides to Censure the Government <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Dentsu News Agency): The Seiyukai held an emergency general affairs meeting at Prime Minister Inukai's residence at 3:00 PM yesterday. First, President Inukai stated that the party's responsibility is extremely important in these turbulent times and should be handled well. Next, the meeting discussed the current situation and decided to thoroughly censure the government as follows: (1) Prime Minister Hamaguchi bears the heavy responsibility of assisting and advising, but it is difficult for him to fulfill his responsibilities in his current state of illness. He is still maintaining his power, causing national affairs to stagnate and sacrificing national politics for the sake of power. The people should pay close attention to this point. (2) The government has reduced the ten major policies to empty words and wants to set up three major investigation committees, which is deceiving the people too much. (3) The deficit in the fiscal year 1930 budget has exposed the flaws in its policies. It wants to avoid answering questions in the parliament and use the reconstruction bonds after the earthquake to make up for the deficit, which is contempt for parliamentary politics and betrayal of responsible politics.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Dentsu News Agency): The Seiyukai intends to question the government regarding its attempt to make up for the deficit in the fiscal year 1930 revenue with reconstruction bonds after the earthquake and negotiate with the government. General Secretary Kato notified Secretary-General Suzuki last night that he wanted to meet with Prime Minister Hamaguchi or Finance Minister Inoue. He was told that the Prime Minister was ill and could not receive guests, and the whereabouts of Finance Minister Inoue were unknown. Therefore, he was extremely angry. After further consultation, it was decided that since Prime Minister Hamaguchi could not meet guests, it was equivalent to admitting that he was ill and unable to carry out government affairs. Since this was the case, he had to meet with Finance Minister Inoue and notified Secretary-General Suzuki that he wanted to meet with the Finance Minister on the 4th.</p>

<p>Berlin, 2nd (Guomin News Agency): According to a press release from a news agency outside of Europe, although Germany has passed the European Tariff Truce Convention of last year in parliament, it has notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations that it will not ratify it, causing most of the countries that have already ratified the treaty to shelve it due to Germany's actions. Reliable sources now state that this news is completely fabricated. After the German trade union passed the treaty, it immediately notified the Geneva Conference, stating at the same time that Germany's final ratification would depend on the ratification of the treaty by Britain and France, because without the ratification of Britain and France, the scope would be very narrow and the momentum would be weak. Later, the French representative raised an objection, causing the conference to fail and declare its closure on March 18. At that time, a protocol was signed by the countries that had ratified the convention, stating that the convention could not be implemented on the scheduled date of April 1. Therefore, all ratifications declared are invalid. Now that the ratifications of all countries have been declared invalid, Germany has no reason to ratify it alone. Therefore, the news from a certain country's news agency is completely contrary to the facts.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Dentsu News Agency): Prime Minister Hamaguchi has recently been absolutely refusing to see guests and focusing on rest. However, fearing that this would lead to various rumors, his attending physician, Dr. Mizobuchi, released the Prime Minister's condition last night as follows: At the end of March, all three attending physicians were concerned about the Prime Minister's condition, and Dr. Shiota even advised the Prime Minister to be re-hospitalized. However, after examining the affected area with X-rays, no special abnormalities were seen. Only the intestines that had undergone surgery were either closely adhered to the abdominal wall or separated from the abdominal wall, causing a loss of appetite and increased fatigue. However, this phenomenon is often seen in the six months after major surgery, so there is no need to take it seriously. The Prime Minister has been lying down and resting quietly since the parliament closed, so he has been recovering day by day. It is hoped that there will be no more rumors.</p>

<p>Business Tax Rate Must Be the Same as Shanghai</p>
<p>The Date of Imposition Should Not Be Earlier Than Shanghai</p>
<p>The joint meeting of representatives of chambers of commerce from various counties in Jiangsu Province yesterday decided to elect representatives to go to the provincial government and various ministries to petition. Today (the 3rd) at 11:00 AM, the petition representatives Fang Weiyi, Xu Yao, Ren Yaofu, Wu Minyu, Yan Jingzhi, Cheng Ganqing, Li Shengbo, Zhou Zigeng, Cheng Chunyi, Zhu Runzhi, Tian Baolin, Lan Bohua, Dai Boqiu, Jiang Kesheng, Shen Zhiwan, Wang Jingting, Yang Jinxian, and Yu Xiaochuan carried a petition to the Provincial Government. Because Chairman Ye went to Beijing, Secretary-General Jin Tigan received them. After the representatives stated their petition intentions and strongly argued for the previous petition points, the representatives further explained in detail that the tax rate should not be higher than Shanghai and the date of imposition should not be earlier than Shanghai. Secretary-General Jin also considered it important and promised to forward it to the chairman. Regarding the amended regulations of the Ministry of Finance, although the provincial government has issued them to the provincial finance department for notification to the business tax bureaus of various counties, Secretary-General Jin believed that the provincial government has not announced the date of imposition. If the business tax collection agencies of various counties freely impose taxes, the provincial government can immediately stop them. It is said that the provincial government hopes that there will be a solution for the issue of various chambers of commerce taking on the matter. Secretary-General Jin also mentioned this matter during his conversation with the representatives. The petition is recorded as follows: "It is necessary to start a business tax in Jiangsu Province at the same time as Shanghai City, and its tax rate must be the same as Shanghai, otherwise the inland business will be even more depressed, and the income of the provincial treasury will inevitably be reduced. We have detailed everything in the previous presentation to amend the business tax regulations, and we hope that you will understand. Now that Shanghai City's business tax has just been investigated and registered, its regulations must be approved by the ministries and the Central Political Conference before they can be established. The implementation will take time. We have heard that the provincial government is very eager to get funds for the provincial treasury and has issued the original regulations and implementation details that the Ministry of Finance has amended in advance to various counties, hoping to collect them as soon as possible. The provincial government believes that the provincial expenses are needed and cannot be helped, but the province and the city are interdependent. If it is not fundamentally resolved, it will inevitably be obstructive and difficult to implement. Merchants regard the tax rate and collection date of Shanghai City as their own interests and have to urgently petition. We ask the provincial government to accommodate us and approve the request in the previous presentation to proceed in a consistent manner with Shanghai City. It is a matter of public convenience."</p>

<p>Cui Shijie's Conversation in Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan correspondent: Cui Shijie, the commissioner of the Jiaoji Railway, went to Beijing a few days ago to participate in the railway medical conference. The matter has now been completed. Yesterday (the 31st) at 6:10 PM, he took the Jinpu Railway No. 202 train to Jinan and then took the Jiaoji Railway No. 2 train back to Qingdao at 9:45 PM that night. I visited Mr. Cui at the Jiaoji Hotel. Mr. Cui gave the following speech: "This railway medical conference held in Beijing has had detailed discussions on all health facilities of each railway, but it must wait for the approval of the Ministry of Railways before it can be implemented. This conference is a concrete proposal for each railway, so the Jiaoji Railway has no special proposal. The extension problem of the Jiaoji Railway will first build the extension line of Boshan. We have now sent personnel to carry out the measurement and plan to extend it from Boshan to the coal mine area so that coal can be directly loaded and transported in the future. This plan has been approved by the Ministry of Railways, and work can begin after the measurement is completed. It is estimated that it will cost about one million yuan to build. As for extending it to Linqing, the project is larger and must wait for the approval of the Ministry of Railways before it can be implemented. The ministry also quite agrees with this matter, but the fundraising method still needs to be considered."</p>
<h3 id="e81">19th Route Army Recovers Longgang <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Gan River Transportation Flows Freely Without Obstruction</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Jiang Guangnai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, arrived in Ganzhou from Guangzhou on March 13th. He immediately convened a bandit suppression meeting at headquarters, determining the strategy for suppression and methods for contacting the 8th, 9th, and 6th Route Armies. After mobilization, counties such as Xinfeng, Yudu, and Xingguo were successively recovered. However, the communist bandits led by Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue still entrenched themselves in Longgang in Xingguo, Dongshao, Huangpi, Xiaobu, and Luokou in Ningdu, taking advantage of the dangerous terrain to resist stubbornly. Cai Tingkai's division in Xingguo immediately dispatched three regiments, advancing on Longgang in three routes. One regiment attacked the bandit's front, luring them out to fight, while the other two regiments attacked the bandit's left and right wings in an encircling maneuver. The bandits in Longgang, numbering over ten thousand, launched a fierce attack on the central route. That regiment lured the bandits to a suitable location, then counterattacked. The left and right wings also took the opportunity to come out together and encircle, arranging more than twenty machine guns and firing fiercely at the bandits, with bullets raining down. It is estimated that over three hundred bandits were killed, and many weapons were seized. The communist bandits fled in droves towards Guangchang, Ningdu, Ruijin, and Shicheng, abandoning countless spears and clubs. Thus, the rugged and treacherous Longgang was recovered. At this moment, each bandit group is surrounded on all sides and wants to break out of the encirclement through eastern Jiangxi and flee to the border of Fujian and Guangdong. However, Jiang Guangnai and He Yingqin have already telegraphed the 8th Route Army and the Liu and Zhang divisions in Fujian Province to intercept them. On one hand, the 19th Route Army is restoring transportation on the Xin River and Yu River in southern Jiangxi, and the Gan River from Ganzhou to Ji'an is also flowing freely without obstruction. The Gan River, which is over two thousand li long, will no longer be obstructed by bandits from now on. (April 1st)</p>

<p>First Assault Our Country's Police Arresting Bandits</p>
<p>Then Surround the Branch Office and Forcibly Seize Guns and Ammunition</p>
<p>Using the Excuse of Obstructing Field Exercises</p>
<p>Liaoyang Dispatch: At 8:30 PM on the 29th, police officers patrolling from the Shili Matou branch of the Commercial Port First Branch Bureau encountered about four or five bandits running northeast south of 13th Weilu. The police bravely chased and arrested them. The bandits resisted by firing guns. At that time, the police were outnumbered and it was late at night. Fearing that the bandits would escape, they chased and arrested them while telegraphing the Dama Road Branch. After receiving the telegram, Director Yang of the branch immediately led the police to arrest them. Unexpectedly, on the way, they suddenly encountered about one company from the 33rd Regiment of the Japanese garrison running from the southwest. The officers and soldiers, fully armed, surrounded our country's police without asking questions, assaulted them, and rushed to the Shili Matou branch, surrounding the branch and forcibly seizing guns and ammunition. At this time, the Public Security Bureau heard the news, and Inspector Xiong, Section Chief Chen of the Judicial Section, and others rushed to the branch to inquire about the cause. According to Second Lieutenant Sata Nakasuke of the Japanese garrison, they were leading a team on field exercises at night, and the Chinese police obstructed their exercises, so they assaulted the police and surrounded the branch. At that time, Inspector Xiong, etc., said that the Japanese garrison had not notified the Public Security Bureau of the night field exercises in advance. Moreover, assaulting the police who were attacking the bandits, causing the bandits to escape, was unreasonable. Also, the bandits were running northeast, and the police were shooting northeast, while the Japanese garrison was exercising in the southwest, and the bullets could not have gone backward. Only hearing the sound, they forcibly and unreasonably claimed obstruction of field exercises, which was completely unreasonable. The Japanese garrison officers and soldiers held guns to our country's negotiators and refused to allow them to enter. They did not talk about reason, were extremely barbaric, and finally forcibly seized thirteen guns and two hundred fifty-three bullets from the police at the Dama Road and Shili Matou branches. Fortunately, although the police officers were oppressed at that time, they remained calm and no accidents occurred. The police authorities are currently negotiating based on reason.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Liaoning Provincial Party Headquarters First Memorial Week <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Liaoning Provincial Party Headquarters held its first Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week on the 30th. The Northeast Five Provinces and Cities Steering Committee and special commissioners Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Zhang Jinghui, and Central Executive Committee member Wu Tiecheng, along with representatives from the Shenyang military, government, and various legal organizations, attended. There were over two hundred people. After Chairman Zhang Xueliang performed the ceremony, he briefly reported, "Comrades, today is the first memorial week we are holding at the Party Headquarters. There is no important report on work yet. I will just say a few simple words based on my personal thoughts. Before the Party affairs were made public, all the work was very orderly, and people generally admired it. Since the public opening, the power of running the Party has reached the political center, and all the work is not as good as before and has been criticized. The reason for this is that in the past, the work was very sincere, but now the work is regarded as casual, as if it is not an obligation that everyone must fulfill, and it is gradually becoming a bureaucratic life, which is very inappropriate. What I hope for has also been said at previous meetings, that all my comrades should work with the spirit of sincerity, because running the Party is not being an official, and the Party Headquarters is different from administrative agencies. Everyone should do their best to perform their duties, and recognize that running the Party is everyone's responsibility. Ordinary comrades should also have this kind of obligation, and cannot say that if they have not been assigned personal work, they will not work. In the future, everyone can encourage each other in both positive and</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>negative aspects. From a positive perspective, the general public's organizational strength on Party affairs in society is like scattered sand, and there are many places that need guidance. The Party Headquarters has the responsibility to lead. The government also has considerable responsibility. Comrades should do their best to guide things such as public health in society. In the past, comrades had some obstacles in the Party's secret work, and everything was difficult to carry out. Now that the Party and government are united, there is no problem with anything that cannot be done. I hope that the comrades in the five provinces and cities who run the Party will actively carry out the work so that perfect results can be obtained. From a negative perspective, we should not be angry at the criticisms of the opposing forces in society. Those who criticize properly should accept it, and those who criticize improperly can just laugh it off. In this way, all the bad places in the work can be improved. This is my opinion." Zhang also introduced the two chairmen of Jehol, Gai Yun恭 and Zhang Xiangtao, to take the oath of office, which was witnessed by Wu Tiecheng, who also delivered a speech. Then the ceremony was completed and dismissed. (March 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Bandit Troubles in Xuzhou Area Soon to Be Suppressed <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The Xuzhou area is located on the border of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan, and is easily frequented by bandits. Since the 7th Division was transferred to Xuzhou for garrison, the area has been relatively peaceful. The following is a brief description of the bandit situation on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui and the Xuzhou-Huai area, in order to inform those who are concerned about the security of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Border of Jiangsu and Anhui: Xiaoxian and Suxian counties are adjacent to each other. The number of bandits in Jiangsu and Anhui is the highest in each county. Zhang Lisheng's cavalry brigade was stationed here before. When the 45th Division was transferred to replace them, Gong Chaomei's group from the 7th Division concentrated in Fuliji, causing Suxian to be in a state of unrest. Wen De, the father of bandit Wang Kunlun from Huangshantou, was arrested. In recent days, it has been rumored that bandit Wang Kunlun will avenge his father and has summoned bandits to attack Suxian city. Recently, in Jiagou Town in the southern part of Xiaoxian County, which is adjacent to Suxian, a large group of bandits, about four to five hundred, suddenly appeared in the Wuliu Town area. It is said that the bandit leader is led by the nickname "Three Scars Monkey." Chen Xiaochen, the captain of the Suxian garrison, led three hundred people to garrison near Jiagou, and cooperated with more than one hundred members of the standing army in the area to fight fiercely. Finally, the bandits were defeated, dozens of bandits were killed, and several heads were cut off and hung on the gates of each fort in Jiagou to show the public. Two county police officers were captured by the bandits and died tragically. In recent days, the county police officers and the public have joined forces to encircle and suppress the bandits, which has been quite effective, and the bandit momentum has been slightly reduced. They have now fled to the Xishan Mountain area, and many hostages have been shot down. It is said that the huge bandit group is still the old department of Yang Xieyue from eastern Henan.</p>
<p>Xuzhou-Huai Situation: Suining, Suqian, and Huaian, Lingbi, and Siyang are adjacent to each other and are located in remote areas, which have always been a den of bandits. Since Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu Province, allocated Zhang Huatang and Zhang Zhankui's two cavalry divisions to defend Xuzhou and Haizhou, the bandit troubles have begun to subside slightly. However, the group led by He Yigang has not been eliminated. Zhang Huatang was appointed commander of bandit suppression in Xuzhou and Haizhou, so he sent Deputy Division Commander Xu Pengju to lead the Yin and Zhang regiments to fight fiercely in the Xiaodian Chou Chizi area in northern Suxian. Repeated victories have been achieved. As of the 29th, the bandits were chased to Nanjian Gully, and an ambush was set up to encircle the bandits. The officers and soldiers launched fierce attacks several times, and the fierce battle lasted for one day and one night. The bandits fled in panic. In this battle, more than 30 bandits were killed, including the two bandit leaders, Zhu San Mazi and Li Fengbiao. More than ten male and female bandits were captured alive, and dozens of rifles and five or six pistols were seized. Dozens of male and female hostages were shot down, and dozens of cattle and donkeys were captured. The remaining bandits fled in all directions. Zhang's troops are still searching and suppressing them. Although this has not been completely eliminated, the bandit momentum in Xuzhou and Huai has been slightly reduced.</p>
<p>Eastern Xuzhou Bandit Situation: In the Pizhou area of eastern Xuzhou, household registration has been strictly investigated in the past month, and there is no place for bandits to hide. Every time after dusk, they desperately use firearms. A few days ago, during a hurricane, more than a dozen bandits broke into the Nianzhuang case in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, robbed Cao Quantai's house, and kidnapped his daughter who was returning to Ning. Then they turned to Nanmen and robbed Cao Fengzhou's house, and kidnapped his young child. Then they went to the Chen widow's house in Xijingdun, west of Nianzhuang, and robbed it. Chen's family was quite poor, but they had a daughter who was twenty-eight years old and had a beautiful appearance. She was actually kidnapped. It is said that the authorities are now planning to suppress them. (April 1st)</p>

The Jin team attached a proposal for interrogation. According to the confession of the criminal Ma, he is 33 years old, a native of Hengmao in Jinshan. He has been farming the fields and making a living. Since he knew Zhu Luo Amei, Pan Xiaodi, Yu Fudi, Zhu Amei, Yang Meimei, Changsheng Erguan, Tailor Achun and others, he was called by Zhu Luo Amei to join the gang. From then on, he took a wrong step and became an eternal regret. In July of last year, more than 30 people joined the gang at the same time. I was the lookout and robbed Xu Wenfu's house in Hongqitang Nanducun and kidnapped Xu Wenfu, who was redeemed for 2,000 yuan. I received 30 yuan. Then I kidnapped A San Xiansheng and someone A who was a south goods merchant, and then robbed Zhang Xiaosha's house in Wangchuan, receiving 5 yuan. The third time, I robbed Zhang's family in Pinghu Guangren Town and kidnapped Zhang's family in Siliqiao, who were redeemed and also received 5 yuan. I also robbed</p>

<p>Wu Jiang Hostages Escape Danger in Fengxian: At about 10:00 am on the first day, the county public security bureau suddenly received three men and women (the man was about fifty years old and the woman was around thirty years old), including the hostages Lu Guanjin and Lu Zhang, who had just escaped from the bandit's den and were sent by the farmers' education center. According to them, they had been farming in their hometown of Wujiang and were kidnapped by bandits on the night of the seventeenth day of the old calendar. They were locked in a thatched house by the river and guarded very strictly. Last night (31st), they happened to see the bandits lying drunk and asleep, so they took the opportunity to escape. They lost their way in the dark and could not distinguish east from west. Fortunately, they met a Qing person who led the way and were introduced by a Lu family to the education center before they arrived here. After hearing this, Director Li Zhibin immediately sent personnel from the Supervision Office to investigate, and also sent a letter to the county government today (3rd) to ask the family members to wait for recognition.</p>

<p>Construction Bureau Staff Embezzlement Case Sent to Court: The former site of the old copper coin bureau in Panmen Inner City was originally rebuilt into the Jiangsu Anti-Corruption Court. The Construction Department sent Lin Zaojian to Suzhou to supervise the transfer. It was immediately discovered that more than 400 pieces of pine wood were lost.

The case was submitted to the hall for review, and Lin was still commissioned to come to Beijing to supervise Zhou Zuxi, Gu Wenhua, Yu Lianqing, Zhang Weisheng, Qian Meiyuan and other five people to be taken care of in the public security bureau to await review by the provincial government. Yesterday (3rd), the county government received an instruction from the Construction Department to the effect that Wei Zuma, the former director of the Construction Bureau, was negligent and should be dealt with by the hall. Zhou Zuxi and others should be sent to the Wuxian Local Court for interrogation and reported separately. After receiving the order, County Chief Huang immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to transfer Zhou Zuxi and others to the local court for review.</p>

Zhou Juxiang testified that I was raped by Hu Nianzu three times, etc. The two witnesses Chen Ajie and Liu Qinshi testified that we heard Juxiang shouting for help in the dining room, etc. The defendant Hu Nianzu did not admit any of the allegations made by Zhou Juxiang, etc. Later, the appointed lawyer Tang Ying defended the defendant. Then Yang, a concurrent judge, ordered Hu Nianzu to be returned to custody and ordered the rest to be returned, and the sentence was scheduled for April 7.</p>
<p>Two Silk Shops Closed at the Same Time: Mo Anzhi, a resident of Nanfangquan Town in this county, raised funds ten years ago to establish the Xinsheng Silk and Cloth Shop in the town, and the business was quite developed. The annual year-end surplus was very large. In order to expand the business, Mo also found a house in Zhouxin Town and opened a Xinchang Silk Shop. The business was still not bad. Recently, because the shop owner Mo Anzhi had no intention of managing the business, the turnover of the two silk shops became sluggish, and they closed at the same time on April 1. The two shops owed about 8,000 yuan in debt. The shop owner Mo Anzhi hid without a trace. Now the Xinsheng partner Hua has notified the creditors in Hangzhou, Shanghai and this county to find a way to liquidate. It is also heard that the creditors are scheduled to come to Wuxi on the 8th of this month to hold a meeting to discuss the plan. It is also learned that the existing inventory in the Xinsheng shop has been sealed and kept by the district office.</p>

<p>Incoming Letter</p>
<h3 id="e104">Letter from the General Association of Merchants of the Four Banks <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>To the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper: We recently sent a telegram to the National Government, which said, "We have recently seen reports that the Legislative Yuan has passed the new salt law, the main points of which are to collect taxes on the spot, allow people to buy and sell freely, prohibit monopolies, and abolish old systems such as license merchants, contract merchants, official transport, and official sales. These seven chapters and thirty-nine articles disregard the facts and hinder people's livelihoods, which has confused people. We dare to earnestly telegraph and respectfully request that you consider that our country has a vast territory and inconvenient transportation. The salt-producing areas are biased on one side. For the sake of people's livelihood, the first priority should be to focus on how to distribute salt universally and how to ensure supply and demand. If free buying and selling is allowed, the salt-selling area cannot be fixed. People will flock to where there is profit and abandon where there is harm. The remote areas will inevitably have to eat bland food all year round. Since the monopoly merchants who bear sole responsibility have been abolished, this is one problem. Our country has more than 7,000 miles of coastline. All areas with saline soil have ponds for salt production. Due to differences in climate and terrain, production prices vary greatly. Taking Fuxian in Fengtian and Changlu in Hebei as examples, the cost per dan is only one or two jiao, while the original price in Zhejiang and Huai is ten times that. If free buying and selling is allowed, people will flock to the north. The various salt fields in the south will inevitably be abandoned. It is not worth pitying the thousands of weak monopoly merchants who drink their regrets and swallow their voices, but what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of salt farmers who do not know the benefits and harms once their livelihoods are cut off and they take the risk of becoming bandits? This is the second problem. Currently, the salt tax revenue exceeds 20 million yuan per year. The tax rates vary, from a few jiao to more than ten yuan. The people's burden is uneven, and the tax system is not good. However, the people of the whole country have become accustomed to it. If the country does not hesitate to abandon the annual income of tens of millions of yuan to allow free buying and selling, what is the reason for this? This is the third problem. Under the current system, license merchants, contract merchants, and tax amounts have certain obligations. Transportation and sales have certain areas of responsibility. Since responsibility is specialized, avoidance is not allowed. Fixed prices have never been independently controlled for the benefit of free buying and selling, which can take advantage of the situation. What is the difference between the benefits and harms? This is the fourth problem. In addition, it is difficult to describe everything in detail. In short, the transport merchants and others have been engaged in this industry for many years. Even if the new law is implemented, they may not be willing to fall behind. They do not recognize the current system as absolutely good and cannot be criticized. The salt system seems to be a major policy related to the country's lifeline and people's lives, so it should not be rashly changed and fundamentally overturned. Therefore, we should earnestly request that the government issue a clear order to postpone the publication of the bill in order to appease the people and, on the other hand, convene experts to review the current system in order to gradually reform it, maintain the salt administration, and increase tax revenue. We are so anxious that we cannot express ourselves completely." The General Association of Merchants of the Four Banks of Huainan, Hunan, Hubei, and Western Anhui requests that this letter be published in your newspaper's incoming letters column to educate the public.</p>

<p>For Kicking Basketball Player Guo Zengwang</p>
<p>Labor University sent a letter to the Chinese National Sports Federation saying, "According to the report of Mr. Xu Yanzhi, the physical education director of our school, the basketball team of our school went to the Chinese Basketball Hall to compete with the Qingguang team the other day. Unexpectedly, at the end of the game, the Qingguang team member Zhang Jinxiang, disregarding the game rules and sportsmanship, kicked our team member Guo Zengwang in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground and cry out in pain. In addition to immediately sending him to the Tung Jen Hospital for treatment, our team also sent a letter to the Chinese Sports Federation to protest, requesting that Zhang Jinxiang's qualification as an athlete be permanently revoked, and that he be ordered to apologize to our team member in the newspaper. We should also advocate that this is to maintain sportsmanship. According to the rules of sports competitions, all civilized societies must abide by them. Zhang Jinxiang, a member of the Qingguang team, disregarded everything and kicked Guo Zengwang, a member of our school's basketball team, which is a disgrace to the personality of an athlete and a burden to the reputation of the Qingguang team. If he is not severely punished, then everyone who participates in sports competitions in the future will be in danger of physical life, which will have a great impact on the future of sports and the morality of the academic community. Accordingly, we are writing to you to investigate and quickly revoke the athletic qualification of Zhang Jinxiang, a member of the Qingguang team, and order him to apologize to our school's basketball team in the newspaper. Our school also hopes that the Qingguang team will automatically express an apology to the society for this unfortunate action in order to maintain the common sportsmanship. We hope to hear from you.

<h3 id="e119">The Death of a Drunken Beggar <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>It is a tragedy for literature when great figures pass away. After the deaths of Fan Shan Hanyun, we now hear of the passing of Zou Hanfei. Hanfei, a native of Liangxi, was uninhibited and loved to drink, hence the self-proclaimed title of "Drunken Beggar." He and other poets like Gao Taichi and Shu Wenmei formed the Xi Society, preserving and discussing old learning. The Drunken Beggar also excelled in parallel prose, his writings adorned with beautiful language. At times, he composed lyrics that were so captivating, filled with emotion, that they stirred the soul. I recall the celebration of Shu Wenmei's seventieth birthday held in a secluded temple outside Fengxi in Wu. Friends gathered to offer blessings, and I was among them. I heard that the Drunken Beggar had come all the way from Shanghai to congratulate him, and I admired him, hoping to deepen our acquaintance. Later, the Drunken Beggar arrived by rickshaw from Jinchang, directly to Fengxi. However, the rickshaw overturned halfway, and the Drunken Beggar injured his leg, causing severe pain. Wenmei, feeling apologetic, sent him to a nearby hospital for treatment. He groaned for several days before recovering, but his gait was stiff, as the tendons and bones were damaged beyond repair. The Drunken Beggar then said with a smile, "From now on, the Drunken Beggar should be renamed the Lame Beggar." He lived in Xujiahui, Shanghai, and due to old age and a bad leg, he named his residence "Waiting for Death Tower" and wrote "Waiting for Death Tower Record," which was widely circulated. However, living in Shanghai was difficult, so he had to return to his hometown and reside in the library, living on a meager salary. He died in poverty and hardship. It is a pity that he had many writings, mostly scattered in newspapers and the Xi Society journal. Last winter, his disciples and old friends raised funds to carve his works, but before they could be completed, he passed away. The death of the Drunken Beggar is deeply regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e120">By the Shores of Tai Lake <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Fen Lü</p>
<p>The day after my visit to Suzhou, I traveled with my companions Ping and Geng to Liangxi to visit many, arriving late at the foot of Wenxi Building. I then went to Plum Garden. Revisit this place, the changes in my life are as if in a dream. The flowing water beneath Sky Heart Terrace remains, and the ten thousand fragrant plum trees still bloom profusely. In the clear scenery, there is no one walking on the short fences and winding paths. I feel as if I have entered a painting. From Fragrant Snow Sea to Reciting Bin Hall, plum trees are planted everywhere, but Little Luofu is the best. The fine grass there is like a carpet. I lay down on the ground, thinking of the setting moon. Truly, I do not know what age it is. Beside Tai Lake, a newly built hotel is full of picturesque and poetic intent. It's a pity that the railings are unable to accommodate me leaning against them, so I skirt around Zongjing Villa. From the terrace, the distant trees fill my eyes, so vast. This is the best spot in the whole garden. Below the terrace, there is the sound of reading. A famous garden with scholarly recitation is a rare blessing in life. Now, people are sad about the past. After leaving Plum Garden, I walked about four miles to Little Ji Mountain. The mountain is by Tai Lake, facing Wanjing Hall and Yuantouzhu across the water. Tea sellers wave flags, inviting people to cross. Drifting along, I feel like a grain of rice in the vast world. After twenty minutes by boat, I reached Yuantouzhu. The magnificent pavilions and high buildings form a famous scenic area. The mountain is not very high, but the climate is refreshing and suitable for a secluded residence. Reading and painting, the sound of the waves enters the lake tower. The morning and evening light embraces one’s heart. Such rare pleasures are hard to find in the world. I then think of the warm thoughts that arise in the hearts of dusty, worldly people. For me, the mountains and rivers are truly delicious, even better than the first time I came. Circling around the mountain, I gradually entered a space of short pine trees and broken rocks. I heard people's voices, faintly indistinguishable. I finally saw workers carving stones, starting to build gardens anew. From here to Treasure Box, I knew it was not far. I planned to explore further, but my companions were lagging behind, and my strength was failing, so I returned. I found Lü Ping by the lake, sitting on a thin rock, leaning against a lone pine tree. The mountains and lakes remain unchanged since the last time I traveled here. When I reached Guangfu Temple and heard the sutras, I tried tea at Flying Cloud Pavilion. The cliff carvings of "Containing Wu and Yue" and the characters of "Horizontal Clouds" are still there. The waves on the lake and the setting sun have gathered the boats, and laughter is gradually diminishing. I made a dream of the empty mountain and waited for the ferry. When I returned by boat, I felt that this trip was not easy to obtain.</p>

<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Hanyun from Huanshang is known in Jilin for his calligraphy and writings. When corresponding with friends, he always signed with the three characters "Wen Dun Shou" (文頓首, "Respectfully bowing at the end"). His cursive writing was often connected like the number "二百" (two hundred). In his small works, he often signed "Hanyun" in the style of the "Seventeen Post Letter" (十七帖), resembling the name of Mr. Zhang Si from Nantong. He also often signed a single "Yun" (雲, "cloud") character in various forms, resembling the numbers "四二" (forty-two) or the character "了" (liao, "end"). Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away on the twenty-third of this month at the age of forty-two. In the past, people referred to death as "了" (liao, "end"). Hanyun's signature had already foreshadowed the year of his death. Alas! (Que Chou)</p>
<h3 id="e122">A Record of the Robot in the German Hygiene Museum <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>During the spring, I was dispatched by the Health Department of the League of Nations in Geneva to the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden to study the creation of medical models and the content equipment. After observing and studying, I would like to introduce to the countrymen what I saw.</p>
<p>Germany has always been known for its medical science. The innovation everywhere can show the spirit of science. Since 1911, the International Hygiene Exhibition has been held in Dresden to exchange medical knowledge internationally to promote public health. It was not able to continue because of the impact of the European War. Now it has been twenty years. Last summer, the Hygiene Exhibition was reopened. Twenty-four countries participated, covering an area of 400,000 square meters. At the same time, the great and profound Hygiene Museum was completed and officially established, becoming a unique feature in the world of medicine.</p>
<p>Among the most refined exhibits, there is only the robot Der durchsichting Kunstllche Mensch. The whole body is transparent, and all kinds of organs are equipped, which is extremely complex. It is placed in the central hall in a standing position with its head raised and hands outstretched. The internal device is equipped with electric lights and key activation. The brain of the robot glows vividly and is released simultaneously with text descriptions for about one or two minutes. Then, in turn, the audience can see clearly at a glance, which is extremely valuable in public health publicity. It is heard that the research and manufacture of the robot took ten years, and it took the efforts of dozens of medical scientists and technicians to complete it.</p>
<p>My country's science and medical skills are just beginning to sprout, and the voices of preserving old medicine are loud. People in the community often blame the inferior skills of doctors for the inadequacy of science and medicine. Will ignoring food because of choking be a chance to promote science? Looking at the creations and inventions of other countries, which are changing with each passing day, we should be more alert and work hard.</p>
<h3 id="e123">A Second Visit to See Paintings in Linggu <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Pengzhou</p>
<p>I visited the capital before and wrote "Visiting Linggu for Paintings," published in this newspaper for more than eight months. Now, I revisited Linggu with Yueqiu and others and met Mr. Liang Dingming in his newly built painting studio. At that time, Mr. Liang was painting two oil paintings for the National Government. They were both more than ten feet tall and wide, one being a portrait of Chairman Chiang in military uniform riding a horse, and the other being a scene of Mr. Chen Yingshi in prison.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang showed me a wooden model of a dedicated gallery for the memorial hall of martyred soldiers. The room was rectangular with slightly rounded ends. The roof was illuminated by a light. At both ends of the room, a high platform was built slightly away from the wall for easy viewing. The size of the murals was very large, and it was not appropriate to view them up close. The theme of the paintings was revolutionary battles, each taking a fierce and important scene as a representative. The battles approved by Chairman Chiang include the Mianhu Battle, the Huizhou Battle, the Dingsiqiao Battle, the Nanchang Battle, the Xuzhou Battle, the Jinan Battle, and the Jining Battle. In addition, Mr. Liang plans to make two more paintings, the Guide Battle and the Lanfeng Battle. Because the canvas order has not arrived, he has collected a lot of factual materials from the battles and has already drawn many drafts.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang also had an invention in this large mural project, namely a perspective line device. Because he suffered from inaccurate perspective lines when creating large murals, he invented this device, which has been quite successful. He used a small light bulb, suspending a black line horizontally in front of it, and placing a wooden board with black lines drawn on it below it. When the shadow of this horizontal black line coincides with the lines drawn on the wooden board, one end is displayed on the canvas. Mr. Liang said that this method is very convenient. After his large mural is completed, he will offer this new tool for perspective drawing to society. It is a pity that we did not get to test it at night.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Housing Shortage in the Capital <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Manyin</p>
<p>Everyone knows about the recent housing shortage in the capital. The root cause is the sharp increase in population, leading to an oversupply of housing demand. According to the population report investigated by the Capital Police Department, the population is more than 580,000, and the monthly statistics show that there is no decrease, but at least an increase of two or three thousand people per month. The old-fashioned houses in Nanjing are too unsuitable, and those that are slightly livable are very expensive. The rent is second only to Shanghai, and the labor and materials are rough and the buildings are inferior. In addition to the rent, a deposit is also required. The deposit is ten times the rent. If the deposit is three months' rent, it is still considered a lenient treatment for tenants. However, some people think that there is a lot of land in Nanjing. Why not engage in construction that benefits others and oneself? Why is the decision not made because there are few houses and many people? This is a mystery of the urban housing shortage. There is indeed a reason for this: landowners buy land and are lazy to engage in construction. The price of land in Nanjing has been rising day by day. Because of the housing shortage, the land price has increased even more. Therefore, landowners have a property that they bought last year, and they can sell it this year for double the profit, or they can wait until the second half of the year and the price will skyrocket. Why bother to work hard on construction, or suffer losses if they are not specialized in construction? In this way, they can profit from others' interests. The landowners all have this kind of thinking. Like the land in Shanghai, there is no need to produce all day long, and the land price is skyrocketing. A large piece of open space in Pingmen, Suzhou, was purchased by the Bei family, and there is still no construction to this day, but the land price has increased several times compared to when it was purchased. This is a kind of inert business method that is really unfair. Therefore, some people have proposed to imitate the Paris method in France, where the government buys a number of bases and builds medium-sized houses, dividing them into people and paying installments on time. This is enough to help alleviate the housing shortage.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Travels in India (XIII) <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>I got a treasure in the plantation, that is, the most famous bodhi tree. I only took two leaves, which said that there were bodhi trees everywhere in the countryside, but not many in the city. This tree is slightly like the banyan tree in Fujian and Guangdong, and the leaves are not very large, slightly like mulberry leaves, three inches in size and triangular in shape. It is heard that there are many bodhi trees in Bodh Gaya. I should return with a full load when I arrive there. The Bodhi tree Bodhi tree is also called the Ficus religiosa. The tree is mostly shaded, which can be an acre in size, and the circumference can be several meters. It is like the banyan tree in the south. The name Bodhi tree is because the Buddha sat under the tree and attained enlightenment. In fact, the Buddha is no different from all living beings. The Buddha tree is the tree for all living beings. The Bodhi tree is especially important in the Zen school, that is, the difference between the Southern School's Sixth Patriarch Huineng and the Northern School's Senior Monk Shenxiu's efforts and methods of enlightenment. The Sixth Patriarch's Platform Sutra details Shenxiu's verse: "The body is the bodhi tree," and the Sixth Ancestor's verse: "Bodhi is originally not a tree," using Prajna to break the emptiness to counteract it. Even "Dream of the Red Chamber" takes it to help the material of the beauty's Zen. It can be seen that the Bodhi tree is a major case in our ideological world. I am asking Indian friends for bodhi tree seeds to spread them widely in China, but it is also limited to the south. It is definitely impossible to transplant them to the north, because trees like bananas and banyans are almost all produced in the tropics. However, in every garden, they can be planted in greenhouses, that is, they can be cultivated as flowers and plants, and they can also be used as a great memorial for someone in the garden with a bodhi tree.</p>
<p>The sun sets in the west, and Indian men and women take their children and wait for the boat back to Calcutta. I am also coming back, the moon shines on the Ganges with rippling light. I write a poem to record it:</p>
<p>The holy water of the Ganges bathes the heart, and the continuous spiritual source flows for thousands of years. I wish to spread the seeds of the bodhi tree, and the green clouds will be widely covered in all directions.</p>
<p>On December 1, Master Daojie came to the Mahayana Buddhist Association to talk with Secretary Xin Han. I will translate as follows: Ask how many kinds of languages are commonly used in India? Which is the most widely used? Answer: There are many kinds of Indian languages. The characters used in the Buddhist scriptures are roughly divided into two types: One type that is popular in China and Japan is Sanskrit, which comes from northern India. The second type that is popular in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Siam is Pali, which comes from Sri Lanka. All the countries where Pali is popular are Theravada Buddhism. However, these two types of characters have become ancient texts, and they are no longer used now. They are all translated into modern languages so that they can be understood. Now, the language commonly used in the Calcutta area is Bengali because it is in the Bengal province. However, the birthplace of the Buddha is not in the Bengal province, but in the present-day country of Nepal. Although this country is small, it is still independent and guarded by high mountains and soldiers. It is about 400 miles away from Calcutta, and it takes three days by train. Ask what kind of version of the Buddhist scriptures exists? Answer: The oldest ones are all written on palm tree leaves, so-called "beiye" (貝葉), which still exist today. Ask whether Myanmar has completely translated these palm leaf scriptures? Answer: It should have been translated completely. Xin Han asked whether there is Pali in China? I replied that I seemed to have never heard of a specialized school. Xin Han said that there is also a Pali department in Japan. I thought that Chinese Buddhists generally do not use scientific methods. The old and new are both broken. I once saw in the Buddhist Library established by Chinese Zeng Guangweng in the Leopard Rabbit area of Yangon that the catalog of English-Chinese Tripitaka translated by Japanese scholars was very detailed, and the names of each scripture have been translated completely, which is gratifying. There are also many English Buddhist books in the Penang Buddhist Society. In total, there are some more. Chinese Buddhism must go to Europe to learn. According to what I have seen in various places, there are already many English Buddhist books. The lack of academic talent and backwardness in everything is shameful.</p>

<p>Last month (3rd), the total amount of interest on silver exchange bills was only 7 qian 5 fen, which was less than the fixed amount of 2 taels. The details were reported in the previous report. Yesterday, the standing committee of the Money Industry Association decided to set the interest rate for March at 2 taels 95, and the arrears of interest will still be added at a rate of 4 taels 5 qian. This is the lowest limit of the usual interest rate on exchange bills.</p>

<p>The market will be closed from today until next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prices remain fixed, with 2.7 million in transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for various bonds in this port was stable. There were a total of 5,000 yuan of spot transactions, and the futures trading was even more scarce than before. The market sentiment was very leisurely. The total daily transaction volume was only about 2.7 million yuan. Within this, the transaction volumes of the 20-year cigarette bonds and the disarmament bonds were only about 600,000 each. The transaction volume of the 1920s tariff bonds was even scarcer. As for the trend of various bond prices, the market will be closed for several days starting today, and various parties will wait and see. Therefore, transactions were scarce, and there were very few differences between supply and demand. The price fluctuation was also very small, with only a fluctuation of 1 or 2 qian compared to the previous day. Also, securities trading will be suspended today for three days and will reopen next Wednesday.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Cotton Yarn: Dull Yarn Market <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yarn trading suspended for three days for the Spring Festival.</p>
<p>Yarn market prices fluctuated wildly, with losses in the morning and gains in the afternoon. Overseas cotton yarn conditions were trending downward, so most retail investors tended to short sell, and the pressure was still heavy. Currently, Qingdao buyers are purchasing yarn because most of the yarn factories there have switched to spinning fine yarn of 16 counts and are short of yarn, so they are purchasing from Shanghai. As a result, coarse yarn trading has picked up. The standard cotton yarn market will be closed for three days starting today for the Spring Festival, and business will resume as usual on the 7th. According to inquiries from Guangdong brokers, the Guangdong traders reported that the previous inventory in Guangdong was about 10,000 bales, and a considerable amount has been sold. Now there are still more than 10,000 bales. If these traders start early, they can expect a rebound by the end of this month. In fact, if the market can be developed, there is hope for a price increase.</p>
<p>The People's Standard started low in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon. The People's Standard market opened with lower prices in the morning due to the decline in American cotton, which softened market sentiment. The sellers were pressing down, and the market was very weak, with near-term prices falling by 49 qian and distant prices remaining flat. When the afternoon market opened, the market atmosphere was still scattered. At the close, it was heard that spot sales were active, and each price rose by 2, 3, or 4 qian. The total daily transaction volume was 12,300 bales. According to investigations, Shen Ji sold 650 bales, Rongxing sold 850 bales, and Yiyu sold 400 bales. Changfeng bought 950 bales, Gongtai bought 950 bales, and Tianlong bought 600 bales. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>August | 1678 |   | 3561</p>
<p>September | 1641 |  | 2650</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Are Still Not Bad: The current yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, various traders purchased a total of 1,200 bales throughout the day. Traders within the same industry purchased 250 bales, the Gudi traders purchased 100 bales, Shantou purchased 100 bales, Guangdong purchased 230 bales, Gaoyang purchased 75 bales, Hankou purchased 45 bales, Tianjin purchased 40 bales, Qingdao purchased 200 bales, Jiangxi purchased 40 bales, Jinan purchased 175 bales, and miscellaneous traders purchased 120 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Cotton Market Slightly Weakens <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, and the trend is still firm because the bottom goods are depleted, and the inventory in various places is decreasing day by day. Therefore, there are few arrivals, so Japanese businessmen think the market is good and purchase. However, the overseas cotton market is not good and is trending downward, and market sentiment is flat. In short, the inventory is thin, and the gold market is difficult to fall, and new sellers are unwilling to go short to the end.</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard Weakly Declines, the Exchange Is Noisy: The Hankou Standard market opened with a slight decline of 1 or 2 qian due to the decline in foreign cotton. The afternoon was flat and long-term prices rose by 5 points. The total daily transaction volume was 19,400 dan. According to investigations, Rongxing sold 2,600 dan, Xincheng sold 1,400 dan, Yichang sold 900 dan, and Dachang sold 800 dan. Xincheng bought 800 dan, Taixing bought 800 dan, and Maoji bought 700 dan. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Open Interest:</p>

<p>July | 4110 | … | 154300</p>
<p>August | 4120 | Down 10 | 10300</p>
<p>Factory Demand Is Unmoved: There is still no movement in the current cotton market. However, the yarn market is depressed, and factory demand is unmoved. The atmosphere is very mediocre. 1,500 bales of Yao cotton and 100 pieces of wooden frame cotton arrived, but no transactions were heard.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the late Indica rice market was weak. In the morning, only Shantou merchants offered to purchase one hundred bags of Jiangxi Zhongguan machine-milled rice at eleven yuan and eight jiao each. There were almost no transactions for late Indica rice. In the afternoon, as merchants felt there were no outlets for both domestic and foreign rice, some were willing to lower prices to sell off their stock. Hankou merchants, seeing that rice prices in their area were high, took the opportunity to tentatively purchase four hundred bags of late Jiangxi machine-milled rice at eleven yuan and one or two jiao each. Although the quality of the goods was slightly lower, the price was still two or three jiao higher than the previous month's market price. After this transaction, the market became slightly more active, and there is hope for a turnaround if there are continued outlets.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Flour Market Advances Sharply <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in both the morning and afternoon, prices for all months rose in unison. Recently, a certain factory has been buying to cover its short positions in foreign flour, and scattered merchants have also been purchasing, causing prices to rise even more sharply. With new bullish investors and scattered factories continuing to buy, the market became increasingly active. The April price rose to two liang and seven fen due to the demand for spot flour and purchases by a certain factory. Prices for other months also generally rose to two liang and four or five fen. The final closing price was higher than the previous day's closing price: July, up five fen; April, May, and June, up four and a half fen each; September, up three and three-quarters fen; July and August, up three and a half fen each.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Wheat Prices Gradually Rise <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in both the morning and afternoon sessions of the wheat market, prices for both near-term and deferred contracts were on the rise. Deferred contracts rose because it was difficult to determine the price of foreign wheat, and speculators with insufficient capital had no choice but to lower prices to cover their positions. Near-term contracts did not rise as sharply as deferred contracts because a batch of foreign wheat was scheduled to arrive soon. However, both those selling on the float and new buyers purchased as much as possible, and prices rose steadily. The final closing price for September rose another nine fen, July rose eight fen, August rose seven fen, and April, May, and June each rose six fen.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's report mentioned the registration of foreign wheat purchases. According to a letter from the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, how to handle this matter has not yet been decided, and the relevant industries are still being surveyed. The previous report was not factual, and we hereby issue a correction.</p>

<p>Recently, the asking price for Xiamen tangerine cakes has increased due to rising land prices and a shortage of supply. Yesterday, Taikoo &amp; Co.'s Jinan wheel arrived from Xiamen with only thirty barrels. The quality of the goods was good, and the price rose to sixteen liang and two qian. However, considering the land prices, it is still difficult to make a profit. Future shipments are likely to be small.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Wang and Mayor Zhang Boarded the Ship to Welcome Him</p>
<p>The King of Siam and Queen Tour the Huangpu River for Two Hours</p>
<p>King Prajadhipok of Siam, accompanied by Queen Rambai Barni and his uncle Prince Svasti, along with a party of fourteen, arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 yesterday morning aboard the Japanese Empress liner. They toured the Huangpu River for two hours without disembarking. This morning at nine o'clock, they will depart on the same ship to travel east.</p>
<p>Grand Welcome: As the Japanese Empress steamed into the Wusongkou, Chinese warships fired salute cannons in respect. Shortly after, the ship docked at the Jardine Matheson Wharf in Pudong. The Chinese flag and the Siamese flag were raised high, fluttering in the wind. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters dispatched a company of infantry, and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau sent a company of police to stand guard. As the Siamese King's ship docked, they all fired their guns in salute. The Siamese King and Queen were on the deck, admiring the sights of Shanghai and taking pictures with a camera. First, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, representing National Government Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, representing Songhu Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui, along with Hu Shize, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Secretary Liu Yunfang, Section Chief Bi Mingyu, and Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, took a photograph when the Siamese King and Queen visited Shanghai. (Photographed by our newspaper)</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, accompanied by the Siamese Ambassador to Japan, Sombat Pichai, boarded the customs patrol boat Jinhui at the new customs pier around twelve o'clock to welcome the guests on the Huangpu River. After boarding the Japanese Empress, Ambassador Sombat Pichai invited the welcoming officials to lunch on the ship.</p>
<p>Wang and Zhang Pay Respects: At three o'clock in the afternoon, Ambassador Sombat Pichai led Foreign Minister Wang and Mayor Zhang into the Siamese King's cabin, number 137, to pay their respects to the King and Queen. Foreign Minister Wang immediately inquired about the health of the King and Queen, and the King also inquired about the health of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He also told Mayor Zhang that Shanghai was very developed. They talked for about ten minutes before leaving. Foreign Minister Wang and Mayor Zhang then spoke with Prince Svasti for another ten minutes in the living room. Foreign Minister Wang then instructed Secretary Liu to accompany Prince Svasti to Pudong to shop. Ambassador Sombat Pichai then presented Foreign Minister Wang with a photograph of the Siamese King and Queen to be given to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. At four o'clock, Foreign Minister Wang and Mayor Zhang, along with the welcoming officials, crossed the Huangpu River and returned. Director Hu remained to guide the Siamese King on a tour of the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>The Siamese King Tours the Huangpu River: At 4:20 p.m., the Siamese King, accompanied by the Queen and two attendants, left the Japanese Empress and boarded the Jinhui patrol boat to begin a tour of the Huangpu River. Director Hu and Ambassador Sombat Pichai accompanied them as guides. Customs water police dispatched another boat to guard behind them. The King was wearing a dark gray suit, was of small build, and had a short mustache on his upper lip. He spoke English fluently. The Queen wore a bright pink suit and had a radiant smile. The jade pendant given by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was hung on her chest. The Jinhui patrol boat sailed up the Huangpu River. Warships and merchant ships in the river all flew flags in welcome. As the Siamese King's boat passed, sailors on Chinese and foreign warships took turns blowing their horns and firing their guns in salute. The Siamese King toured as far as the Gaochang Temple and the Jiangnan Shipyard before returning. He returned to the Japanese Empress at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Prince Svasti's Remarks: Prince Svasti of Siam received a reporter from this newspaper on the Japanese Empress. He said that the King was thirty-five years old, had studied in England and France, and had studied artillery in England. He has been on the throne for five years and enjoys playing tennis and golf. Dancing is prohibited in the country because Siam follows Buddhism as the state religion and reveres the teachings of Confucius. Even now, men and women still do not touch each other when giving and receiving. The Queen is twenty-five years old. The King plans to stay in the United States for six months to treat an eye disease. He will return on the Japanese Empress by the same route, passing through Shanghai again. Prince Svasti himself is currently the Minister of Sanitation.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Chinese Children's Welfare Association Promotes Children's Day <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Background</p>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association, since its founding by Minister Kong Yongzhi and others three years ago, has been dedicated to "promoting and safeguarding children's rights and seeking happiness for children through all possible means." It has been working diligently and has achieved remarkable results. It has been actively promoting initiatives to benefit children whenever possible. It is now advocating for April 4th as Children's Day and has already submitted a report to the Chairman of the National Government, who has instructed the Executive Yuan to inform all relevant parties. As April 4th approaches, the association's efforts in promoting Children's Day are detailed below for the benefit of readers and to encourage further promotion. (The following is a transcript of the association's original text)</p>
<p>(1) The Origin of Promoting Children's Day: In China, it is customary to drink Tusu wine on New Year's Eve, with children drinking first to ward off disease. On the Shangsi Festival, children's faces are washed with peach blossoms, said to preserve their youth. On the Dragon Boat Festival, colored silk threads are tied to children's arms, said to ward off disasters. Children are always given priority on festive occasions, especially in spring. This is because spring is the beginning of the year, and children are the beginning of life. Therefore, warding off misfortune for children at this time shows that their well-being is carefully considered. However, the formal establishment of a Children's Day has never been heard of. Since Ellen Key advocated for the 20th century to be the century of the child, the world's attention has been focused on children. As a Western scholar said, "World culture is determined by the footsteps of children." In addition to engaging in children's welfare work, countries around the world have established Children's Day. Britain celebrates on July 14th, the United States on May 1st, and Japan even divides it into Girls' Day on March 3rd and Boys' Day on May 5th, which are observed nationwide. In the United States, the National Children's Welfare Conference has been held at the White House three times in the twenty years since 1909, demonstrating the attention paid to children's happiness.</p>
<p>(2) The Process of Promoting Children's Day: On March 7th, the association submitted a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating, "We hereby request permission to hold Children's Day and request that it be forwarded to promote the event. The strength of a nation depends on its people, and the strength of its people depends on its children. Children are the future masters of the nation and the center of cultural transmission. Countries around the world pay attention to children's welfare work, and there are children's laws, children's courts, children's affairs bureaus, and other facilities. The Geneva International Alliance has also issued a formal declaration on the protection of children's rights, and the United States celebrates Children's Day on May 1st. Japan celebrates Girls' Day on March 3rd and Boys' Day on May 5th, which are observed nationwide. According to our country's imperial system, there are provisions for caring for children, and ancient sages have taught us to cherish the young, indicating that we are not neglecting children's welfare. However, the country has faced many disasters, and although the state has established education officials and local areas have kindergartens and nurseries, many people regard them as insignificant. At a time when national education is not widespread and compulsory education is not implemented, a significant gesture is needed to awaken the people. We propose to select a date as Children's Day and follow the example of neighboring countries by requesting the National Government to issue an order for the entire country to observe it. On that day, lectures will be held on various measures to protect children's rights, arousing public attention and instilling in everyone the idea of caring for children and taking responsibility for their well-being. This will enable children to understand their position and expand the scope of children's welfare, laying the foundation for a strong nation and a strong race. If approved, we request that April 4th be designated as Children's Day and that all relevant authorities be ordered to hold celebrations to promote the event. This is because the date falls in spring and coincides with Arbor Day. In terms of climate, it is the same in the north and south, and it complements the previous "3/3," "5/5," "7/7," "9/9," and current "10/10" festivals without conflict. As the association is responsible for children's welfare, we dare to offer our humble suggestions (omitted below)." On the 13th, the Social Affairs Bureau issued Approval No. 7586, stating, "The submitted report has been read and found to be insightful. In addition to approving the submission of the report to the Municipal Government and then to the National Government for approval, a joint meeting of representatives from the Public Security, Education, and Health Bureaus, as well as the Shanghai Charity Federation, will be convened at 3 p.m. on the 16th of this month to solicit opinions. At that time, the association is requested to send a responsible representative to attend the meeting and present their views. This is the approval," etc. In compliance with this order, the association prepared materials and drafted a general outline of measures (temporarily omitted). At the joint meeting of representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau and other representatives, it was said that the matter concerned the entire country and had already been submitted to the Municipal Government and then to the National Government for approval. It should be handled after the National Government issues a clear order. On the 21st, the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order stating, "For notification: The association's request to designate Children's Day has been submitted and approved. The Municipal Government's Instruction No. 9469 states, "The submitted report has been read and should be forwarded for review and approval. This is the order," etc. In compliance with this order, the association collected materials and awaited the National Government's clear order. On April 2nd, the Social Affairs Bureau issued Instruction No. 8447, stating, "For notification: The association's request to designate Children's Day has been submitted and approved. The Municipal Government's Instruction No. 7779 states that the National Government's Civil Service Office has sent a letter stating that the Chairman has issued an order to the Municipal Government to forward the report from the Chinese Children's Welfare Association requesting that April 4th be designated as Children's Day to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. This is the order," etc. In compliance with this order, since the National Government has issued an order to the Executive Yuan for notification, the name of Children's Day has been obtained. However, due to the short timeframe, it is not possible to hold celebrations. Only the details of this case will be published for general knowledge as a prelude to next year's April 4th and as a decoration for this year's April 4th.</p>
<p>(3) Enthusiastic Support for Children's Day: Since the association initiated the promotion of Children's Day, it has received letters from all parties expressing their unanimous support. (1) Xiong Bing San, Director of the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute in Beiping, wrote, "I strongly support your association's proposal to promote April 4th as Children's Day, but I am not sure if it is confirmed. Please telegraph to confirm so that we can prepare for the celebration." (2) The Youth Section of the Taiyuan Youth Association wrote from Shanxi, "Your association's goal of promoting Children's Day on April 4th to seek happiness for children is admirable. Please send us the methods and procedures so that we can organize it." (3) A letter from Nantong stated, "Please inform us of the outline for the Children's Day publicity and celebration so that we can hold it in our area," etc. Many letters have been received in Shanghai inquiring about the methods, indicating that many places are expressing sympathy and support. This shows that the enthusiasm of our people for children's welfare is increasing daily, and the scope of children's welfare is expanding daily, which can be said to be a matter of great importance for the children of the whole country.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Significance of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association's Promotion of Children's Day <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Children! What a sweet, lovable term, full of all comfort and all hope! The future world belongs to the children of today. Although all our noble ideals cannot be realized at present, they will surely blossom into bright flowers in their brand-new paradise in the future. Then, all personal, social, national, and even global problems can be solved. From this, we can see that the problem of children is actually the key to all problems, the root of all problems. If the ancient Greek philosopher Archimedes was right in saying, "Give me the power and I can change the face of the world," then we can boldly say, "Give me the children and I can transform human life." Ellen Key was the first to reveal this message. Her famous saying, "The twentieth century is the century of the child," has been deeply engraved in the hearts of all people and has generated great power. In August 1925, the International Children's Welfare Association held its first international conference in Brussels, Belgium, with more than 700 representatives from 54 countries (including China) attending. Five principles for protecting children's rights were established and announced to all countries of the world for unified compliance. The Geneva International League of Nations, recognizing the importance of the issue of children, also established a Children's Protection Committee in May 1925 to focus on working for the happiness of children. Many governments have established "children's bureaus" to take charge of specific responsibilities. Numerous children's welfare organizations have been organized by the people of various countries. Children's laws, children's courts, children's research, children's literature, children's health, children's education, children's playgrounds, children's movie theaters, and children's libraries are all issues that thoughtful and insightful people are enthusiastically exploring and pondering today. In general,</p>
<p>The twentieth century will truly become the century of the child. The world of today will truly become the world of the child. In this tide of promoting children's happiness, there is a new system that is particularly noteworthy and deeply interesting to our country, and that is the so-called Children's Day. When this festival is held, people across the country concentrate their thoughts and enthusiastically explore children's welfare issues, and children in general receive a special welcome from adults on that day. They each hold their own small banquets, inviting their young friends, busy and happy. It is truly a new system full of poetry. When the United States held Children's Day on May 1st of last year, play days and public speeches were launched across the country. The American Children's Hygiene Association distributed hygiene slogans across the country and questioned mothers across the country on various issues. The New York City government took this opportunity to carry out a campaign to eradicate diphtheria and vaccinated one million children between the ages of nine months and ten years in the city that day to prevent diphtheria. Other cities and states also carried out the campaign with similar enthusiasm, but each had its own special issues and special focus. In addition to convening a White House conference to discuss children's happiness on that day, President Hoover also opened the White House all day, welcoming children from all over the country to tour freely and visit the President and First Lady. When they left, Mr. and Mrs. Hoover gave each child a bag of candy and a small book. When Britain held Children's Day on July 14th of last year, Lady Colville served as the National Chairman, and the Countess of Airlie and Lady Clementine served as Vice-Chairmen. Public speeches and infant health competitions were held in various places. Under the leadership of city mayors and county magistrates, people enthusiastically donated to support the national children's welfare cause. When it was held in London, the Mayor and Mayoress expressed special support. Slogans promoting children's happiness could be found everywhere on major streets in the city. Countless women wore badges and went to and fro in the crowds to raise money for children's welfare. The King and Queen personally visited the National Mother and Child Welfare Promotion Association and commended the association's work. In the evening, a play day was held with the Central Police Band playing music and speeches by Mrs. Lemon, Miss Spencer, Miss Dowie, and many other children singing, playing musical instruments, and dancing. It was quite a sight. Every year on March 3rd, Japan holds Girls' Day. On that day, girls across the country dress up in beautiful clothes and display dolls and toys at home, gather with young companions, and hold small banquets. After the banquet, they practice singing, playing games, and bowing. Every year on May 5th, Japan holds Boys' Day, which is simpler and more masculine than Girls' Day. On that day, people across the country eat rice cakes (covered with green leaves) to show that they do not forget this festival and to implicitly wish for health. Boys across the country traditionally hang the weapons and armor they usually play with in appropriate places, decorated with battle flags, and display rice wine and calamus below for offering. This symbolizes a spirit of courage and enterprise. At the same time, companions are gathered for a simple banquet for unrestrained laughter and talk. After the banquet, they enter the bathroom for a hot bath, with several calamus leaves placed in the water. The subtle warmth and fragrance surround the room, making people feel refreshed and happy. Alas, we have seen the grand occasion of other people's Children's Day. How can we not be very envious? Unfortunately, our childhood has passed in silence. It is our responsibility to prevent the next generation of citizens from having such regrets. The ancients once said, "The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade, and the stones of other mountains can be used to correct mistakes." We should certainly learn from other people's shortcomings, but we should also imitate and learn from their strengths. Looking at the Children's Day system as a whole, (1) it can awaken the public's awareness of children's welfare, (2) it can increase children's happiness, and (3) it can give the country an opportunity to carry out a special spiritual training for the next generation of citizens. This is certainly worth imitating and learning from us. The association is an organization in our country that coordinates all aspects of children's happiness. Because we feel that the issue of Children's Day is a very important issue, we submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau on March 7th of this year to be forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Government and then to the National Government, requesting that April 4th be designated as China's Children's Day. We have already received a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau on April 2nd stating that the Chairman of the National Government has instructed the Executive Yuan to forward the order to the association. From now on, in our country's history, in addition to Labor Day and Women's Day, a Children's Day will be added, which can be said to be an unprecedented event. Although there is not enough time to hold large-scale celebrations this time, I believe that by this day next year, all the people of our country, from the Chairman and committee members to the common people, will be able to work together to promote this new system with rich significance in a planned and organized way. The impact on the future fortunes of our Chinese nation can be said to be very great, and there is no need to say more. Men and women adults across the country, please do not neglect this festival and fail to live up to this festival! Boys and girls children across the country, please enjoy this festival as much as possible and make full use of this festival! Brilliant flowers and full fruits all depend on people's cultivation and care. Please remember to hold a children's welfare movement and promote the Children's Day on April 4th every year, and do not delay this great festival! Twenty-four three</p>
<h3 id="e144">Japanese Fishing Boats Rampant in Our Territorial Waters <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Fishing off Sheshan</p>
<p>Colliding with and Capsizing Our Fishing Boats</p>
<p>Japanese fishing boats previously sank our fishing boats in the waters off Dinghai, causing huge losses. Negotiations were initiated but have not yet been resolved. Recently, a large number of Japanese fishing boats have entered our territorial waters to fish wantonly, and have collided with and capsized our fishing boats. We are urgently reporting what we have heard as follows:</p>
<p>Colliding with and Capsizing Our Fishing Boats: Recently, the yellow croaker season has begun in the waters of eastern Zhejiang, and fishermen from eastern Zhejiang are launching their boats to fish. Most of them are fishing in the waters off Sheshan and the Langgang reefs. However, after our fishing boats set sail, a large fleet of Japanese fishing boats arrived and invaded our territorial waters, also to compete for fishing off Sheshan. Although there are many Chinese fishing boats, they are not as large as the Japanese boats. Seeing that our good rights are being taken away by the Japanese boats, we are unwilling to give up and go forward to compete. However, the Japanese boats wantonly rammed our fishing boats, and several fishing boats were sunk. Fortunately, the people who fell into the water were rescued by fellow fishermen. The waters of eastern Zhejiang have been carved into the sphere of influence of Japanese fishing boats.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Request to Send Warships to Intercept: After this tragedy occurred, the fishermen of eastern Zhejiang felt that their livelihood was about to be cut off and could not sit idly by while their national territorial waters were seized by foreigners. Therefore, all the fishermen jointly elected representatives Shi Renhang to telegraph to the Navy and Industry Departments, saying that recently Japanese fishing boats have again invaded our territorial waters and are densely distributed in the waters off Sheshan and Langgang reefs, using giant ships and large nets to fish exhaustively. There are only a limited number of fish in the world. If they do not enter there, they will enter here. Therefore, our fishing boats have almost no fish entering their nets from spring to winter, while Japanese fishing boats are rampant on the sea, hostilely provoking. As soon as our boats approach, they collide with them, causing both people and boats to sink. They also clap their hands and laugh, which is extremely inhuman. We urgently request the Navy Department to send multiple warships to drive the Japanese boats out of the country as soon as possible, so that the millions of fishermen in eastern Zhejiang can still be saved. Otherwise, their right to life will be lost and the livelihood of the fishermen will be cut off.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The French Marines Withdraw from Xujiahui <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Since the autumn of the 13th year of the Republic of China, when the Father of the Catholic Church in Xujiahui Town, west of Shanghai, petitioned the French Consul-General to dispatch more than 30 French marines to be stationed in the vicinity of the Catholic Church, nearly seven years have passed. Because of illegal martial law that obstructed traffic, drunkenness and causing trouble, molesting women, and other illegal acts, the various groups in the town repeatedly petitioned the authorities to negotiate with the French Consul for their withdrawal, but this was never carried out. On September 21, 1929, a truck carrying French marines ran over and killed Zhang Qingbao from Changshu. On November 8 of the same year, the French marines beat and injured two local citizens, Ding Jiaxun and Wang Youhai, at Tianyao Bridge. The gentry and merchants of the town could no longer tolerate it and organized the Xujiahui All Circles Support Association. Chairman Zhu Shiqi, together with Chen Junyi, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Department and the People's Training Association, demanded conditions from the French authorities such as punishing the perpetrators, compensation, apology, and withdrawal of troops. The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession negotiated on behalf of the Support Association and resolved the matter on November 23. Except for the issue of troop withdrawal, which was not within the scope of the case and would be negotiated separately, the French authorities fully recognized the other conditions of punishing the perpetrators, compensation, and apology. Now, Liu Yunfang, the head of the second branch of the sixth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has ordered the Father of the Catholic Church to withdraw the troops within a time limit because the Catholic Church is located in the Chinese territory and the French marines are not allowed to cross the border and garrison, which is a loss of national sovereignty. At the same time, he has submitted a request to the Public Security Bureau to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate seriously with the French Consul. It is said that the French marines have all been withdrawn by the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e146">China Merchants Bureau Sends a Letter Requesting a Halt to the Private Transfer of Sanxin <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Because the Bureau Once Invested a Large Number of Shares</p>
<p>After the sale of the Sanxin Cotton Mill, the China Merchants Bureau believed that the bureau had previously invested a large number of shares in the mill, and it was illegal for the Sheng family's descendants to sell the property without permission. Therefore, it sent a special letter to the municipal government requesting that the buying and selling parties and the workers of the mill be ordered to prohibit private transfer. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the original text of the letter is as follows (China Merchants Bureau's letter to the Municipal Government): We are writing to inform you that in recent days, various newspapers have repeatedly reported on the sale of the machinery of the Sanxin Cotton Mill by the Sheng brothers and the repeated mediation of labor disputes by your Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to stop the buyer from taking over. We were deeply surprised to read about the various processes. We learned that last year, your government, on the order of the National Government, thoroughly investigated the estate of Sheng Xuanhuai, a former official of the Qing Dynasty. You sent a letter to our bureau requesting that we conduct an investigation of the Sheng family's property. We submitted a detailed list in reply to your government, in which the Sanxin Cotton Mill was included. Our bureau therefore investigated the history of the mill in detail and discovered that the mill was not purely the private property of the Sheng family. Our bureau is actually the largest shareholder and has various relationships such as paying for the mill's foundation, purchasing boilers, and providing loans. Later, Sheng Xuanhuai renamed the mill, appropriating public property for private use. In the end, he even pretended to be a British merchant and registered in Hong Kong to escape domestic jurisdiction, relying on foreign forces to achieve his plan of encroachment and seizure. From the early years of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty to the 16th year of the Republic of China, our bureau was always managed and controlled by Sheng Xuanhuai and his descendants. No one dared to report such fraudulent events. As time went by, the actual facts of the mill's operation gradually became unknown to people. The Sheng family was able to safely regard it as private property. According to our bureau's records, the Sanxin Cotton Mill was actually the Weaving Bureau established in the eighth year of Guangxu, with a total capital of 400,000 taels. In the 17th year of Guangxu, our bureau invested 112,000 taels. In the 19th year of Guangxu, the bureau was destroyed by fire, and the boilers and machinery were mostly lost. Sheng Xuanhuai took this opportunity to reorganize and expand the mill, renaming it the Huasheng Textile Bureau and increasing the capital to 800,000 taels. Our bureau invested 320,000 taels. This share certificate of our bureau was kept by Sheng Xuanhuai and is recorded in a very reliable document. In addition, our bureau also allocated funds for the Weaving Bureau to fill the foundation (the current site of the Sanxin Mill) and purchase boilers. After the renaming to Huasheng, several tens of thousands of taels were borrowed. Although the name of the Huasheng Mill was changed again and again, the capital and property remained as a whole. Although it was registered with the Hong Kong government under the name of Sanxin with a declared capital of 1.5 million taels, the actual capital was still virtualized by the increase in the original capital of Huasheng on the land. It is exactly the same as the matter of our bureau's commercial management, from 2 million taels to 4 million taels to 8.4 million taels. The share certificates of our bureau in the mill have been concealed and held by the Sheng family's descendants, with no intention of returning them to our bureau. Our bureau has conclusive evidence for all the above points. Therefore, our bureau is definitely a shareholder of the Sanxin Cotton Mill and is also a creditor. It is absolutely clear that the Sheng family's descendants cannot sell the property without permission before all the rights of our bureau are legally resolved. Fortunately, the sale of the mill has not yet been completed, and your government is impartially reviewing the matter. We sincerely request that you order all parties involved in the buying and selling and the workers of the mill to absolutely prohibit private transfer until all the rights of our bureau have been effectively recovered. Otherwise, it will be considered invalid. We believe that your government values national navigation industry and will be happy to assist. We are writing to inform you of the relationship between our bureau and the Sanxin Cotton Mill and the reason for requesting the prohibition of transfer. Please investigate and handle accordingly. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Government, Mayor Zhang (China Merchants Bureau's letter to the Sanxin Cotton Mill Union): We are writing to inform you that we were shocked to read in the recent newspapers about the sale of the Sanxin Cotton Mill by the Sheng family. The Sanxin Cotton Mill was originally the Shanghai Machine Weaving Bureau. In the 17th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, our bureau allocated more than 100,000 taels of shares. Later, when it was renamed Huasheng, Sheng Xuanhuai, the former director of our bureau, allocated more than 300,000 taels of bureau funds to invest in new shares, and Sheng allocated bureau funds to purchase land and excavate and fill the mud along the river. However, because Sheng had been in charge of both our bureau and the Sanxin Mill for many years, he was able to use his position to engage in fraud and embezzlement, and privately held these shares without handing them over. Moreover, during the era of commercial management, the Sheng family's descendants were directly and indirectly in charge of bureau affairs, and these fraudulent events were concealed and not investigated. When the National Government sent personnel to take over our bureau, Zhao, the former general manager, mentioned the relationship between our bureau and the mill in a letter replying to the Municipal Government when the National Government was investigating Sheng's traitorous property. Now that our bureau has been taken over by the state, these property rights that were encroached upon by Sheng are waiting to be investigated and recovered. However, the Sheng brothers have no scruples and sell the mill's foundation privately, disregarding our bureau's property rights and ignoring the livelihood of thousands of workers. This is extremely inappropriate. Our bureau cannot abandon its sovereignty and navigation rights. In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Government based on the previous case to declare that it should prohibit its free sale, we are now sending a letter to the person in charge of the mill to come to the bureau to handle the matter. We also know that your association has the same purpose of loving the industry and loving the navigation industry and strongly opposes the sale of the mill. We are sending you a formal letter on the relationship between our bureau and the mill and hope that you will oppose anyone freely transferring it before the property rights issues between our bureau and the mill have been properly resolved. We hope that you will take note. Sincerely, Cotton Spinning Industry Union of the Third Special District</p>
<h3 id="e147">Conflict Between Shipyard Workers and Tram Conductors Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Workers Went on Strike for One Hour</p>
<p>The case of the fight between the ticket sellers of the China Merchants Tram Company and the craftsmen of the Naval Aviation Office has not yet been completely resolved. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, Zhou Xiaoliu, a craftsman from the Naval Jiangnan Shipyard, had another conflict with a conductor from the Tram Company, resulting in a one-hour strike by all the workers of the shipyard. Chen, the director of the shipyard, Shao Kuan, agreed to the conditions requested by the workers before they resumed work. The details of the conflict are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Conflict: At about 1:00 PM yesterday, just as the shipyard workers were going to work, more than ten craftsmen from the Naval Jiangnan Shipyard's bench department, including Zhou Xiaoliu, were riding the No. 4 China Merchants Tram from the entrance of the South District Fire Brigade to work at Gaochang Temple. When the tram arrived near the South Railway Station, Zhang Luansheng, conductor No. 18 of the Tram Company, boarded the tram and checked the passes of the craftsmen. The passes of the shipyard workers were issued by the Tram Company in the spring of the 18th year of the Republic of China. After more than a year, all the stamps and photos were blurred and indistinguishable. The passes used to be exchanged every quarter according to the regulations. Last year, the Tram Company notified the shipyard that it was not necessary to exchange the old passes for the convenience of procedures, and that the old passes were still valid. Therefore, they have not been exchanged until now. The conductor said that Zhou's pass was blurred and that the steel stamp and photo did not match, and that it was a fake. The two sides spoke rudely and a quarrel arose. At the same time, Lin Honghai and other craftsmen from the shipyard were also riding this tram and saw this situation. They mediated from the middle, but it turned into a brawl. When the tram arrived at the last stop of Gaochang Temple, the two sides got off the tram and turned into a fierce fight. The situation was very tense, with fists and feet flying. As a result, He Changshui, the ticket seller of Tram No. 12, was injured in the face.</p>
<p>Craftsmen Detained: At about 1:00 PM yesterday, Cao Jinyang, police officer No. 335 of the first team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, happened to be at Gaochang Temple. He, together with Liu Guiting, patrol officer No. 41 of the first district's headquarters, took both sides to the Gaochang Temple sub-station. Zhou Xiaoliu's boarding pass was taken to the company by the conductor. When all the workers of the shipyard heard the news, they were very angry. The Tram Company forcibly took back the pass without following the procedures, which caused the dispute. All the workers requested that the authorities seriously negotiate and went on strike for one hour. They all crowded to the Gaochang Temple sub-station in the second district to request their release. Ye Baoqi, the battalion commander of the Naval Guard Battalion, personally went to the second district sub-station and explained the situation. Patrol Officer Gao immediately handed Lin over to Ye and took him back. He also sent soldiers to maintain order. The ticket seller No. 12 was personally sent to the company by Patrol Officer Niu of the second district.</p>
<p>Workers' Strike: After this incident occurred, the shipyard workers went on strike for one hour. More than a hundred workers went to the shipyard's union to demand three conditions: (1) Issue new tram passes in the shortest possible time. (2) Order the company to publish an apology in the newspaper for the insulted workers. (3) The time for exchanging passes in the future must not exceed one year. Zhu Xiangkui and Hong Fushun and other members of the union's standing committee led all the workers to visit Chen, the director of the shipyard, Shao Kuan, and asked for instructions. Chen agreed to all the conditions one by one and issued a notice first asking the workers to resume work. All the workers were satisfied and immediately resumed work.</p>
<p>Chen's Statement: After mediating this incident, Chen ordered Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi to go to the Tram Company and ask General Manager Lu to come to the shipyard within one hour to discuss a solution. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau also heard the news and sent Zhu Jintao, an official from the third section, to the scene of the incident to conduct a detailed investigation and report it for verification. It is said that Mayor Zhang will be appointed as the mediator in the end.</p>
<h3 id="e148">More Than 40 Silk Factories in Zhabei Resumed Work Yesterday <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Wage Issues Awaiting Resolution</p>
<p>All Arrested Workers Completely Released</p>
<p>The female workers of all 40 silk factories in Zhabei, including Fuchangtai, demanded the restoration of their original wages. They did not report to the relevant authorities in advance and suddenly went on strike together one afternoon. The Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus believed that it was related to local peace and tranquility and immediately issued a notice and advised them to resume work first and wait for the higher authorities to review and handle it. They all entered the factory yesterday morning to resume work and the arrested workers have also been released. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation: At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the silk factories opened as usual. The various sub-stations and police stations of the fourth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the entire armed police officers of the third brigade were all on duty and patrolling. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Guilin to accompany the chiefs and patrol officers of the various districts to the factories to advise the workers to resume work. The union also sent directors Yuan Yunlong, Wu Suzhen, Yan Aizhu, Wu Xiubao, and other staff members such as Li Tonggai to the factories in groups to mobilize and guide them. At that time, all the female workers were waiting near the factory gates to watch. After repeated persuasion, the female workers of more than 50 silk factories in Tanjiabang, Taiyangqiao, and Tanzhiwan in Zhabei entered the factory to resume work at about 8:00 AM. However, the number of workers who went to work was less in several factories. Except for several factories such as Dalai and Tianlai, which were closed as usual, only the two factories of Ding Su and Mailun on Yutong Road were voluntarily closed by the factory owners. When work resumed at 12:30 PM, there were slight disturbances among the female workers of the factories such as Yuanyuan, Longji, Chunmao, Yongyuan on Changan Road, and Jinyuan on Meiyuan Road. After the authorities and the union sent personnel to explain separately, they all entered the factory to resume work immediately.</p>
<p>Number of Factories Resumed Work: The silk factories that have resumed work include Zhabei, Xinzha, Hujiu Da, Xie Xingchang, Wufeng, Xie Chang, Shunfeng Yong, Baisi Yi, Xie Feng, Hua Qingshun, Baisi Er, Heng Kang, Fuchangtai, Fumin, Ding Changshun, Heng Changxin, Yuanyuan, Longji, Chunmao, Yongyuan, Tailai, Qingfeng, Jinyuan, Ruifeng Yu, Fuchangrun, Yongan, Qichang, and other more than 30 factories. Dasheng, Shen Changchu, Xincheng, Jiusun, Hengda, Jiulun in Tanjiabang, and Fengtai and Yongchang in Taiyangqiao, a total of more than 40 factories.</p>
<p>Authorities' Notice: Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, issued Notice No. 8571 yesterday morning, which was posted at the gates of various silk factories, saying: "For the purpose of issuing a notice, it has been found that the entire strike by female workers of 18 silk factories including Fuchangtai in the Zhabei district was not known to the Zhabei District Silk Reeling Industry Union beforehand. It can be seen that there are troublemakers instigating it. In addition to strictly investigating and handling it, this notice is hereby issued to all female workers of the various silk factories in the district, who must all comply with it, resume work immediately, and wait for verification and handling. Do not wait and see and mislead yourself. Sincerely."</p>
<p>Notice to All Factories: Huang Jinfan, a committee member of the Silk Factory Association stationed in the Zhabei district, notified the factories two days ago, saying: "We are writing to inform you that this labor unrest is unreasonable. Today, the factories are checking the number of workers who have come to work, and it is expected that some of them are not there because they are afraid. This is also the scene after the labor unrest in the past. Tomorrow, we hope that your factory will open as usual to ensure work. Sincerely."</p>
<p>Union's Statement: The Zhabei District Silk Reeling Industry Union issued a notice to the workers yesterday, saying: "Dear friends, you must resume work quickly and do not listen to rumors. You must listen to our advice. You must know that a strike is the most unfortunate thing. If you want to restore your wages, you must of course submit it to the higher authorities through the union to resolve it. Now our union is actively handling it, and there will of course be a satisfactory result in the future. Dear workers, do not be used by others and resume work quickly! Only after resuming work can there be a solution. Workers, wake up! Obey the union's orders and resume work quickly!"</p>
<p>Order from the Social Affairs Bureau: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Silk Factory Association yesterday, saying: "For the purpose of issuing an order, it has been found that the labor dispute of the female workers of the silk factories such as Fuchangtai in the Zhabei district has been mediated by our bureau by sending personnel to work with the police officers of the Public Security Bureau. According to reports, the factories have gradually resumed work at about 8:00 AM this morning. However, when the workers of the four factories of Ding Kang, Bao Lun, etc. went to work, the factory owners claimed that the machines were damaged and refused to allow them to work. In reality, although there was some broken glass during yesterday's chaos, the machines were not damaged. Today, all the factories have resumed work, but the workers of the four factories are scattered outside. If there is another dispute, it will inevitably be impossible to control. This order is hereby issued to the association to quickly order the factory owners to start work immediately. When starting work, the police should be sent to maintain order and there is no need to worry too much. If the dispute is expanded due to delay, the factory will be held responsible. Sincerely."</p>
<p>Workers Released: After the female workers of the silk factories in the Zhabei district went on strike, Zhang Sanzi, a female worker aged 20 from Taizhou, who was arrested by the Tanjiabang police station the day before yesterday for instigating the strike, lived on Jinlu Road. Two people were arrested by the second branch of the fourth district: Lu Wengshi, a female worker aged 28 from Taizhou, who lived on Hanzhong Road and was a worker at the Jinyuan factory No. 190, and Zhao Huashi, a female worker aged 29 from Yancheng, who lived on Gonghe Road and was a worker at the Xiecheng factory. They were immediately sent to the fourth district headquarters that day. After Zhou, the district chief, interrogated them, they were temporarily detained. By last night, the female workers of the silk factories had all resumed work, and the three people had no other circumstances. They were ordered to sign a guarantee and released.</p>

<p>Guo Bingwen, the former member of the Industry and Commerce Committee, was appointed as the director of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and ordered to prepare for the establishment of the International Trade Bureau. Guo had repeatedly resigned from the position of director of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce due to his recent appointment as a representative of the China Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce to attend the Washington Conference, but he complied with the order and prepared the organizational regulations and budget draft of the International Trade Bureau for the ministry's selection due to the importance of international trade to the national economy. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, because the plan was under review, telegraphed and urged Guo to take office at the Bureau of Industry and Commerce immediately. Guo arrived at the bureau yesterday to take over the work. Zhao Jinqing sent personnel to hand over the work separately and introduced Guo to all the staff. Zhao said in his speech that Director Guo's knowledge and experience were well known to his colleagues and did not need to be introduced. He also had more than 30 years of friendship with him. He was deeply grateful to have him come to the bureau to take over. In the future, he would use his knowledge, experience, and spirit of sacrifice to strive to develop international trade, which would definitely make a considerable contribution to the national economy and people's livelihood. Guo then spoke, saying that he had been handling the China-America Association for the Promotion of Culture and Education and other national diplomacy affairs abroad in recent years. He represented the National Federation of Commerce to attend the International Chamber of Commerce Conference in The Hague last year, and he also went to Europe to inspect the post-war economic construction of various countries. He felt that China's international trade was backward compared to Europe and the United States, and its economic construction was even more so. He could not compete in the world business arena unless he actively struggled. This time, Minister Kong insisted on appointing him as the director of this bureau and ordered him to prepare for the establishment of the International Trade Bureau. He hoped that the national people should have the obligation to serve the public and did not dare to refuse. He reluctantly came to take the post. This bureau was reorganized from the Economic Discussion Office. The office was established in the 9th year of the Republic of China and has achieved great results. The National Government established the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and sent personnel to take over the group as this bureau to collect and publicize domestic and foreign industrial and commercial news for the reference of entrepreneurs and to promote international trade. The task was extremely important. Under the guidance of Minister Kong, Director Zhao and his colleagues have made considerable progress in the past three years. Now that Director Zhao has been transferred to the ministry to take on an important position, the minister ordered him to come and take over. In the future, he will certainly follow the administrative plan of the ministry and carry it out practically. The colleagues are well versed in industrial and commercial enterprises and international economic issues. If they have any opinions, they are welcome to inform him at any time and jointly plan improvements, so that the original business can be operated in the most economical way and achieve the most magnificent efficiency. As for the issue of developing international trade, he also hopes that the colleagues will conduct practical research and give more guidance, so that he can make a contribution to the government and society.</p>

<p>Five Robbers Visited the Silver Shop</p>
<p>Bought a Gold Thread Ring and Jumped into the Counter</p>
<p>Innocent Customers Suffered</p>
<p>Total Loss of Nearly 6,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Fei Wenyuan Silver Shop, in the prosperous area of Nanjing Road, was suddenly visited by five robbers in broad daylight yesterday afternoon. Each held a pistol and robbed banknotes, silver dollars, and gold jewelry worth more than 5,600 yuan.</p>
<p>The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Buying a Gold Thread Ring: Fei Wenyuan Silver Shop has been open for many years on the west side of Nanjing Road's Ball Field. At about 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, when customers were at their peak, a man with luxurious clothes, very much like a high-class person, came outside the counter and claimed that he wanted to buy a gold thread ring. The shop assistant asked how much silver dollars he wanted, and the customer replied that one worth more than ten yuan would be fine. The shop assistant immediately approached and entered the goods room to take out several gold thread rings weighing seven or eight points to let the customer choose. Who knew that at this time, there were three more people outside the counter, each with a pistol raised in their hands. They told the crowd not to make a sound. At the same time, they jumped into the counter and divided into two groups to invade. One robber specialized in robbing the banknotes and silver dollars on the account table, while the other two robbers invaded the goods room to rob gold jewelry such as rings and earrings. There were two other robbers outside the door who were responsible for keeping watch. If anyone was spying or causing trouble, they would use a pistol to command them. Their attitude was very calm.</p>
<p>Innocent Disaster for Customers: When the robbers were robbing, a Cantonese customer, A, brought gold ornaments to exchange for silver dollars, weighing a total of one tael and six points. After the shop assistant calculated it, the silver dollars were valued at 102 yuan. Both the gold and silver notes were placed on the counter. The robbers took everything without hesitation, and the customer left empty-handed, extremely frustrated. The total loss was more than 1,000 yuan in banknotes, 180 gold thread rings weighing 39 taels, and 36 pairs of earrings weighing 5 taels, totaling 44 taels. Including the aforementioned banknotes and silver dollars, the total value was more than 5,600 yuan. After the robbers had robbed to their fill, they swaggered away. The responsible police station was notified and immediately sent detectives to the scene to investigate in order to arrest the murderers and recover the stolen goods.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Tragedy of a German Merchant Ship Colliding with a Mud Boat <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>German Ship Escaped After Causing the Accident</p>
<p>Two Girls Suffocated in the Boat</p>
<p>The day before yesterday at noon, 11 mud boats of the Xideji Dredging Company were fully loaded with mud from dredging machines at the Yuhang Wharf on the Bund and transported to Yangshupu to dump. After the unloading, they were still driving upstream in a continuous stream. When they reached the vicinity of the Qichang Wharf on the Bund, an imported merchant ship was turning around in the middle of the river. At the same time, a German merchant ship was sailing rapidly downstream. In order to avoid the turning merchant ship, the helmsman was not careful and suddenly violently rammed into Zhu Zhaoyou's mud boat. The boat was immediately overturned. There were six people on the boat, including Zhu and his wife, three daughters, and a boatman. They all fell into the river at the same time and were rescued by other mud boats. Zhu and his wife, their six-year-old eldest daughter, and a boatman were rescued. Zhu's four-year-old second daughter and two-year-old youngest daughter were missing. The German ship sped away after causing the accident. Zhu and others did not remember the ship's number. Afterwards, other mud boats towed Zhu's boat to the mud beach and used manpower to turn the boat over. They saw that Zhu's second and youngest daughters had both suffocated in the cabin. The situation was extremely tragic. Afterwards, Zhu personally went to the water police station to cry and complain. The head of the police station sent detective Huang Songsheng to the scene of the accident and transported the bodies of the two children to the Nanshi Lifesaving Bureau for an autopsy. The local court appointed Wang Sixian, an inspector, to examine the bodies and confirm that they had died of suffocation after the boat capsized. He ordered the father of the deceased to temporarily collect the bodies for burial. It is said that Zhu went to the police station again yesterday to demand that the ship company responsible for the accident compensate for the loss of the boat and provide generous compensation for the two daughters. The head of the police station then ordered Hua detective Wang Haiquan to investigate the ship company and the name of the ship responsible for the accident in order to negotiate and sent Zhu to the local court to investigate and pursue the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Preliminary Hearing for Water Police Detective's Fatal Assault Case <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Grandmother of Deceased Claims Dependence on Grandson for Livelihood</p>
<p>Equivalent to Indirectly Killing Entire Family</p>
<p>｜Detective Also Accused of Extorting Thousands of Dollars｜</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Zhaoxiang, a detective chief of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Province Water Police Team, who assaulted boat dweller Lu A'gen, resulting in his death, was again brought before Prosecutor Yang yesterday for a preliminary hearing. The deceased's grandmother, Yang, filed a complaint, stating that her entire family relied on her grandson for their livelihood, and that this was equivalent to indirectly killing her entire family. The case not only has witness Lu Genxiang, who saw the incident, but also boatman Zhang A'dong, who personally witnessed Zhang assaulting her grandson to death for embezzling cotton. Therefore, she requests punishment for the murderer and compensation, among other things. Lu Genxiang testified that he was cooking on the boat when, on the 16th day of the lunar new year, Zhang seized the cargo. When the goods were handed over on March 28th of the Gregorian calendar, it was discovered that a significant amount was missing. Therefore, he asked Zhang to go to the Wing On Cotton Mill to provide proof. Zhang then slapped the deceased and punched him twice, resulting in his death. Zhang A'dong's testimony was similar. The official ordered them to leave and await legal punishment. However, Zhang denied the assault. The official, believing that the death was caused by injury to the ear, ordered the case to be temporarily adjourned. Subsequently, the case of merchant ship owner Guo Shixin accusing Zhang Zhaoxiang of extorting thousands of dollars was heard. Guo testified that Zhang falsely accused him of carrying contraband, seized his ship, and extorted money. This has already been proven to be a false accusation, and he requests prosecution. He also presented two witnesses, Wang Huaiquan and Cai Yiting. The official summoned the two witnesses to court for questioning. After they provided evidence, they were also instructed to leave, and both cases will be handled together.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Suspicious Powder <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Emitting a Strange Odor When Baked</p>
<p>Police Confiscated Twelve Ounces</p>
<p>Suspected of Containing Morphine</p>
<p>To Be Confirmed Before Further Action</p>
<p>Upstairs at number 570, Dexing Lane, Peng Road, lived a Wang family. Zheng Peijin, from Yong, Jiangsu, had recently lost his job and was lodging with the Wangs. The previous morning, Wang and his wife, Li, went out and did not return until night. Zheng was alone in his room, and the other residents of the house paid him no attention. After 9:00 PM, Su Qiaoyun, a woman from Nanjing who lived downstairs, suddenly smelled a strange odor. Upon closer inspection, she realized it was coming from upstairs. She went to investigate and saw Zheng facing the stove, baking a very fine powder. She asked him what the powder was and what it was used for. Zheng said it was glutinous rice flour. The woman, suspecting he was lying, did not press him further. She took a small amount of the powder and tried to leave, but Zheng tried to stop her in every way and demanded the powder back. The woman then cried for help and seized the opportunity to escape and report to the nearby police. The police went upstairs and searched, finding a bag of fine powder weighing twelve ounces under the bed. They took Zheng into custody and brought him to the Zhabei Police Station. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Special District Local Court. After a preliminary hearing by Judge Feng, the police lawyer stated that the powder was suspected of containing morphine and requested a postponement for testing. The judge agreed to postpone the hearing until the test results were clear. Zheng testified that Wang and Li had instructed him to bake the powder, saying it could cure toothaches and fevers. He did not know what medicinal ingredients were used in the preparation. Judge Feng then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing until the test results were clear.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Trial of Concubine Zhang Shi-ming's Lawsuit to Recognize Her Son <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Concubine Zhang Claims to Have Endured Hardship</p>
<p>Requests Confirmation of Mother-Son Relationship</p>
<p>Arguments Concluded, Verdict on the 9th</p>
<p>Zhang Shi-ming, a wealthy resident of Nanxun, formerly took Zhou Miaoying as a concubine, and she bore him a son named Qu'an. When Qu'an was five years old, Miaoying was dismissed from the household. Now that Qu'an is approaching adulthood, his primary wife, Xu, married him to a niece last year. Upon learning of this, Miaoying came out to obstruct the marriage, causing Xu to secretly complete the marriage for her son. This made Miaoying even more angry, and she hired lawyers Wu Jingxiong, Yuan Yang'an, and others to file a lawsuit against Zhang Qu'an and Zhang Xu to confirm the mother-son relationship. This case was previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong of the Special Court held a hearing to question the defendants, who also hired three lawyers: Zhu Sifu, Jiang Yiping, and Cai Ni Pei. According to Zhou Miaoying's testimony, she currently resides at number 15, Yongli Lane, Tongfu Road. She was formerly married to Zhang Shi-ming as a concubine and gave birth to a son, Qu'an. She left the Zhang family when Qu'an was five years old. Now, because Zhang's wife, Xu, has surrounded my son, preventing him from knowing that his biological mother is still alive and enduring hardship outside, and preventing me from seeing my son, I am specifically suing for a judgment confirming that Qu'an is my biological son. Judge Xu asked about the record established on September 17th of the seventeenth year, separating her from the defendants. Zhou replied that the document was entirely drafted by lawyers, and she did not understand its contents. The plaintiff's lawyer then added that the precedents of the Supreme Court clearly state that the mother-son relationship can never be severed. Even if the biological mother remarries, she still has a mother-son relationship with the son born to her former husband. The defendant's lawyer, Zhu Sifu, also stated that he was present when this document was drawn up because he represented the defendant. He witnessed the plaintiff signing and sealing the document. At that time, the defendant gave the plaintiff 40,000 yuan as lifelong alimony, and the plaintiff had no property or other relationship with the defendant forever. All of this is recorded in the document, and it also declares that the plaintiff acknowledges Qu'an as his biological mother. Now, the plaintiff is again requesting confirmation of her biological mother status, which is unnecessary. Therefore, this case does not require litigation. Lawyer Cai then continued, "After the plaintiff was dismissed from the household, her whereabouts were unknown for a long time. Later, it was heard that she had joined the prostitutes at Flower Stamen Garden in Leyu Lane. She had long since severed ties with the Zhang family. What relationship is there to speak of? Only the name of mother and son remains, and there should be no further claims." Lawyer Jiang Yiping added that when the plaintiff was dismissed from the household, why didn't she request custody of her son? It is only now, when her son has the power to manage property, that she suddenly brings up this claim, which is too late. Although her request appears to be a legal issue on the surface, she actually wants to exercise maternal power, but there is no legal basis for it. Moreover, she received 40,000 yuan in lifelong alimony many years ago." Therefore, the lawyers on both sides spoke and argued until half past noon before finishing. The official then adjourned the court, announcing that the verdict would be delivered on the morning of the 9th of this month.</p>

<p>Police Still Must Appeal</p>
<p>Cheng Linsheng, a wealthy merchant from Huizhou residing in Shanghai, received threatening letters demanding a large sum of money. The police investigated and found that Cheng's accountant, Wang Rusong; gatekeeper, Zhang Changshan; apprentice chauffeur, Gu Wannian; and Yang Zhenyuan, a bodyguard at Yu Yiqing's residence at number 116, Yu Garden Road, were all suspected. They were detained and brought before the Special District Local Court for questioning. The hearing concluded and a verdict was scheduled. This was previously reported. Yesterday afternoon was the date set for the verdict in this case. Zhang, Gu, and Yang were escorted to the court by the police. Wang Rusong, who had been released on bail, also surrendered himself. Judge Ge then ascended the bench and acquitted all four defendants. The police lawyer, Zhang Dayin, requested that Zhang, Gu, and Yang be detained during the appeal period. The court immediately granted the request, and Wang Rusong was instructed to remain on bail of 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Death Very Tragic</p>
<p>Ma Fuqing, Chinese constable number 1497 of the Hongkou Police Station, lived with his mistress at number 814 Kunming Road. Yesterday afternoon, around 1:00 PM, he suddenly used a sharp knife to commit suicide, cutting open his abdomen and slitting his throat. He died instantly. His mistress immediately took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment and reported to the Tilanqiao Police Station. Ma died after arriving at the hospital. The cause of suicide is unknown, but it is said that it was due to mental disorder.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that on the 31st of last month, Mr. McBain, the chairman of the Shanghai Greyhound Racing Club, sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council notifying them that the Ming Garden would still hold dog races this Saturday. However, if the Municipal Council could begin negotiations for a peaceful resolution within a few days, the club would be willing to postpone the dog races indefinitely and would also mention the issue of compensation. On the 1st of this month, the Municipal Council replied to McBain, stating that the Municipal Council could not consider the statements in the letter to be correct. The Municipal Council's attitude was already evident in the letter of March 19th and need not be repeated. It expressed the Municipal Council's determination to enforce the resolution that dog racing would not be allowed within the settlement after the end of March. If the Ming Garden still holds dog races tomorrow, there will be a considerable response. It is now widely rumored that the Municipal Council will withdraw its protection of the garden, send police to guard its entrance, cut off traffic on the road, and detain any Chinese who participate.</p>

<p>Suddenly Living Under the Dutch Heel</p>
<p>The China-Netherlands Foreign Relations Support Association believes that the Xin Dingxiang case in this port and the Dadong Guangdong wheel case in Shantou have been resolved one after another, but Xiao Xin'an has been defiled to this day and has not yet been cleared of her humiliation. This is truly a national shame. Therefore, yesterday, another telegram was sent to Xiao Xin'an urging her to return to China to continue her anti-Dutch exploration. The telegram reads as follows: Xiao Xin'an, Principal of Anbon Peide School: Having read your reply, we know that you are unwilling to be humiliated and are determined to wash away your shame, and you are willing to donate all the loss compensation proposed by all walks of life to the women's school. Your noble integrity and lofty style have moved people far and wide. Our association has no past grievances with the Netherlands. It is only because your defilement is not just your personal problem, but is related to the honor of the entire nation. The so-called "scholars can be killed but not humiliated" is the righteous spirit of our country's tradition, which cannot be dreamed of by the Dutch, who flatter the strong and bully the weak. At that time, the Zhava Company, due to resistance to Dutch ships in various ports, knew that public anger was difficult to violate and was willing to publish an apology to our nation in all Chinese and Western newspapers and overseas Chinese locations. Unexpectedly, pro-Dutch traitors undermined the resistance, leading to the Dutch having no fear and the apology has not yet been implemented. Thinking of the past, how can we not feel grief and indignation? Our association's support for foreign relations is unwavering. We hope that you will resolutely return to China to seek redress and not live under the insulting Dutch heel, which would be impossible to explain to the people of the country. China-Netherlands Foreign Relations Support Association, Jiang Seal</p>

<p>Termination of Contractual Obligations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the contract between the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Chinese authorities for out-of-settlement telephones has expired and a continuation has not yet been agreed upon. The company recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council requesting that the obligation to convert to automatic telephones stipulated in the contract with the Council be waived with regard to the out-of-settlement telephone portion. This was brought up for discussion at a meeting of the Public Utilities Committee of the previous Municipal Council. As it was outside the settlement, the Municipal Council had no right to interfere and could only accept the request. Therefore, it was decided to recommend that the Board of Directors approve the waiver of the contractual obligations.</p>

<p>The old house of the Asian Literary Society on the Museum Road has become dilapidated due to age and needs to be renovated. Recently, Wilson and others launched a fundraising campaign for 120,000 taels of silver to cover the cost of the new building. To date, donations and pledges total nearly 104,000 taels. However, due to the recent impact of the high price of gold and low price of silver, the construction cost has far exceeded the estimated amount.

After repeated consultations, yesterday afternoon, representatives Wu Chunyuan, Zhou Jingren, Chen Huisheng, and others went to the Taxpaying Chinese Association of the French Concession to request justice and reasonable assistance. Committee member Shang Mu Jiang specially invited Mr. Lu Tingjian to meet with Mr. White (translator), the manager of Terry &amp; Co. Mr. White refused.

They unanimously decided to vow to never move and publicly signed a contract to express their determination to oppose it to the end. They also prepared to petition various party and government agencies in the Chinese Concession at a set time to seek unanimous support from all walks of life.</p>

<p>Jianghai Customs has issued new rules for import ship manifests to strictly prevent tax evasion and has notified all shipping bureaus. The general rules are as follows: (1) All merchant ships entering Chinese territorial waters or sailing within Chinese territorial waters shall have a hatch manifest signed by the shipowner, detailing the cargo loaded, and shall be subject to customs inspection at any time. Failure to prepare this hatch manifest shall result in a fine of up to 500 taels of customs silver for the shipowner. (2) The hatch manifest shall include the ship's name, nationality, shipowner's name, and the number of pieces of cargo, as well as the numbers, marks, and packaging styles of each piece of cargo. (3) The designated port for loading and unloading goods. (4) Omitted. (5) If there are any goods (including transit goods) on board that are not listed on the hatch manifest or that do not match what is listed on the manifest, the shipowner shall request corrections from customs within 24 hours of reporting to customs, but only if the errors are due to oversight or clerical errors. However, corrections may not be requested for goods not listed on the hatch manifest that have already been discovered by customs. (6) If any goods not listed on the hatch manifest are discovered by customs officials, the shipowner and cargo owner shall each be fined up to 1,000 taels of customs silver, and the goods shall be confiscated. If the goods not listed on the manifest are hidden by special means and the customs officers confirm that the shipowner and shipowner have fulfilled their duties, paid close attention, and were unaware that private goods were hidden, the penalty may be reduced accordingly. If several packages are combined into one piece of cargo and the words "several packages combined" are not noted, it shall be treated as not listed on the hatch manifest. (7) If goods that have been listed on the hatch manifest are found by customs officials not to be among the goods carried by the ship, if the shipowner cannot provide conclusive proof that the missing goods were not loaded at the original port of departure or were mistakenly unloaded at a port along the way, the shipowner shall be fined up to 500 taels of customs silver for each missing piece of cargo. (8) If a merchant ship exports goods without customs approval, it will be fined 1,000 taels of customs silver. (9) Warships, yachts, and river patrol boats are not subject to these regulations.</p>

This is a regret of the general assembly. The association's past work has been to review and approve medical and pharmaceutical terms, etc., which has not contributed much to society. However, limited by the environment, it can only proceed gradually. In this time of disputes between old and new medicine, the association's members should uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, promote the spirit of scientific nation-building, and strive constantly.

First, Chen Fangzhi spoke on the subject of "Research on Blood Fluke Disease (commonly known as leech tumor), First Report," detailing the origin and investigation of the disease in great detail. Next, Yu Wangda spoke on the subject of "The Compilation Process of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia." After the lecture, a break was announced. Special lectures were held from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

On the Chinese side, the various medical appliances of Dahua Ironworks, the various good medicines of Fukang Pharmacy and Shoumin Public Company, and the various injectable drugs of Xinya Chemical Factory were all quite noteworthy. On the foreign side, pharmaceutical companies such as Schering, Kefa, Baibu, Yingrui, Celler, Shunfa, Kaili, Baoxian, Tiande Takeda, Shionogi, and Siemens displayed the latest medicines and therapeutic equipment of many kinds and gave out various gifts to the guests, who were all very pleased.

<p>The undertakings of the Shanghai Charity Group Tongren Fuyuantang are all practical and realistic. The provision of coffins is a perennial charitable act. The distribution of rice and clothing is held in winter. Last winter, under the rice distribution item, the grain ration was converted to 1 yuan per person, totaling 928 yuan. The rice tickets were exchanged for 172 shi, 3 dou, and 6 sheng of rice, with each shi priced at 10 yuan and 4 jiao, totaling 1,792 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 li. The 300 shi of rice originally prepared for porridge distribution was used to support the Cold Shelter expenses with 1,000 yuan due to the increasing number of fraudulent claims found in recent years. Under the clothing distribution item, 60 new cotton coats, 997 new sets of cotton clothes, and 318 sets of old cotton clothes were distributed. The number of coffins distributed in January and February has been reported previously.

<h3 id="e202">The Diary of Marshal Foch on the European War (Continued) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>But before we implement this strategy, we must not forget that the active participation of our allied Russian forces on the Eastern Front has pinned down the majority of the enemy forces, enabling us to achieve the victory at the Marne. It is our responsibility to assist them to the best of our ability. This is our subsequent operational policy, regardless of the outcome. Even if we do not reach the point of victory, we can at least pin down the enemy on the Western Front, leaving them no time to transfer troops to the east. The decisive battle on the Eastern Front may become the prelude to the enemy's complete victory.</p>
<p>However, how the operations on the Eastern and Western Fronts should coordinate completely depends on the instructions of the French Commander-in-Chief. Unlike our offensive in the north, which was initiated by us, my current duty is to follow General Joffre's instructions and cooperate closely with the British and Belgian allied forces to direct the war...</p>
<p>Many of our troops left the northern war zone to recuperate in the rear or were assigned by the Commander-in-Chief. I took the opportunity to visit them. I often gathered the officers together to talk. Even after a winter of fierce fighting, the officers and soldiers were still as spirited as ever, which was highly commendable. They fully understood the importance of the battle achievements in overturning the enemy's plans at Ypres and the Yser River. They firmly believed that they would be able to defeat the enemy in their current attacks. The confidence overflowing from their faces was very moving.</p>
<p>On January 17th, General Zhentian was injured in a car collision, which was serious enough to cause serious consequences. We were traveling in the same car along the road from Lusibuzhi to Dankek. A heavy truck, its steering gear broken, suddenly blocked the road, and the two vehicles collided. The Commander-in-Chief was seriously injured, and he had to abandon the inspection and return to Romilly, his headquarters, by train. I was fortunate to be unharmed, but I was very worried about my superior. After leaving him at Dankek Station, this feeling was even stronger. Fortunately, he fully recovered after a few days.</p>
<p>After the accident, I immediately wrote to the Minister of War, as I was the assistant to the Commander-in-Chief, which was appropriate. In the letter, I asked him what I should do if General Joffre was unable to continue commanding the war as a result. If such a situation did occur, which officer on the front line would be responsible for planning emergency measures, as the enemy could take advantage of the situation at any time. The reply informed me that I did not need to worry about accidental events, as the government had already made preparations for this. In fact, in August, General Gallieni had already been internally designated as the successor to the Commander-in-Chief. Although he was extremely intelligent and talented, he had only participated in a very small part of the war, especially in trench warfare. Politicians decide too quickly about military personnel. The only place to evaluate officers is on the battlefield. Only their battle achievements are the measure of their abilities.</p>
<p>At the beginning of December, the British government expressed to the French government the hope of transferring the British troops in Flanders to a more northerly war zone, where they could defend part of the allied front line near the coast. Their left wing could especially rely on the sea as a support. It was thought that such a movement would satisfy British public opinion.</p>
<p>On the Belgian coast, from Asdun to Zeebrugge, Great Britain was often exposed to the danger of enemy attacks. Attacking Asdun's naval base with British troops along the coast would be most effective in resisting this fear. The British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, attached particular importance to this plan, followed by Sir John French, the British Commander-in-Chief, and then General Joffre, the French Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p>The two of them saw that the main force of the British army was devoted to goals that only concerned naval warfare, and detached from the battle against the allied forces' powerful enemy – the German army – which was quite unwise. This battle would determine the fate of the great war within three months. Under these circumstances, after lengthy discussions, it was decided in the second half of December that the British army would maintain the right wing of La Bassée while using the reinforcements arriving from their own country to transfer defenses with the French Eighth Army. The French army would leave its original troops in Nieuport, but gradually withdraw the troops from the Ypres salient, leaving only a detachment in Ypres, inserted between the British army's left wing and the Belgian army's right wing.</p>
<p>Later, in the implementation of this troop transfer plan, firstly, because the arrival of British reinforcements was delayed, there was a great delay. Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, was only willing to send troops to the mainland that had already been fully organized into divisions or corps. General Commander French, however, wanted them to be formed into battalions. The lack of munitions also made the Commander-in-Chief feel quite constrained in expanding the front line. The slow progress of British munitions production especially worried him.</p>
<p>At that time, the British First Lord of the Admiralty wanted to reconsider his plan to attack Asdun, and was willing to supply the French detachment in Nieuport with 3,000 marine reinforcements. General Joffre still insisted that land-based warfare was more important, and said that in the La Bassée area, the British forces on the left wing of our Tenth Army could be well-commanded. He therefore asked Sir John French to agree on two points: the expansion of the British army's front line and close cooperation in the French army's attacks.</p>
<p>The progress of the war was hindered by the lack of allied firepower and war materials. As mentioned earlier, the prolongation of the stalemate and the resulting anxiety among the people misled a certain cabinet into participating in the command of the war, making the work of the supreme military commander even more difficult. Moreover, our lack of materials had serious consequences.</p>
<p>Troop equipment and munitions supply have become the most important issues in modern warfare. They must occupy a prominent position in the views of the supreme military commander, not only in terms of meeting the enemy, but also in maintaining the war when public opinion or the government wavers.</p>
<p>As a result of this complex situation, the British army only replaced the French 16th Army Corps by the end of January, much slower than the mutually agreed progress. The French 9th and 20th Army Corps had not yet been replaced. This situation did not change significantly until mid-March. However, on that day, the British First Army completed its preparations for an attack in the La Bassée area, and the ongoing negotiations were interrupted. They could not be resumed until this plan had yielded results.</p>
<p>General Haig, commanding the British First Army, was ordered to attack. The troops moved forward on March 10th. At first, they had some success. In the following days, they were unable to advance, and were even unable to fully hold their ground.</p>
<p>On the night of March 12-13, General Haig ordered the attack to be stopped, but the occupied positions must be held firmly for ten days. The decision of the commander of the British First Army was said to be due to fears of insufficient munitions and excessive casualties.</p>
<p>Now we can return to the plan to replace the French army corps around Ypres. Sir John French, Lord Kitchener, General Joffre, and Mr. Millerand decided at the Chantilly Conference that the British Second Army would replace the French 9th and 20th Army Corps by April 20th. Two newly formed British divisions were transferred to France. The French army launched an offensive in Artois at the end of April, making rapid progress. On April 7th, the 9th Army Corps had withdrawn from the front line and moved to the 10th Army's war zone. On April 19th, the 20th Army Corps followed suit. By the end of April, the allied forces in the north had been completely reconfigured.</p>
<p>The British army deployed from the La Bassée Canal to Boesinghe on the road to Ypres. They were divided into two armies: the First Army in the south, commanded by Sir Douglas Haig, and the Second Army in the north, commanded by General Smith-Dorrien.</p>
<p>The French Eighth Army had disintegrated on April 4th, and was now replaced by a Belgian detachment led by General Putz. The detachment was divided into two branches, one in Ypres between the British and Belgian armies, and the other in Nieuport, the extreme left wing of the allied front line.</p>
<p>At my request, the Belgian army has now agreed to expand its front from Nieuport, defended by the French army, to Steneskerke. The morale of the Belgian army has been improving continuously since arriving at the Yser River. The Belgian King still holds the same determination. Although the Belgian army cannot undertake large-scale battles, they can at least lend a helping hand. They have been doing so since the beginning of March. From March 11th to April 11th, for a full month, they were ordered to fight without stopping. Although their attacks did not achieve much, they were at least able to develop a spirit of courage in the Belgian army, proving that they had the will to do their duty. Moreover, this action must have a violent reaction on the enemy's side.</p>
<p>We have developed close relationships with the Belgian commander and all levels of the Belgian military, which has resulted in the two armies being of one mind and one heart, which can have a very good influence in critical times.</p>
<p>In January, the Belgian General Headquarters withdrew from Furnes and moved to Houtem, a more remote location, because its location was often subjected to heavy enemy artillery fire. The King, Queen, and Princes resided in La Panne, a seaside town not far from Houtem. He went to the General Headquarters in the Presbyterian Church in Reninge every day. Several of his officers also lived there. (To be continued)</p>
