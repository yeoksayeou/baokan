<h3>爲辦賑者進一言</h3>
<p>前日之颶風暴雨。各災區所遭受恐怖哀慘之景象。益見嚴重。則吾人之救濟工作。亦自覺自身之責任彌益加重。故今日負責辦理賑務人士。無論其爲官賑。或爲義賑。第一須精誠合作。通力共籌。庶能收事半功倍之效。不至精力枉費夫設會籌欵爲救災也奔走追呼亦爲救災也。官賑義賑。性質雖異。目的則一。賑災工作。但有義務。絕無權利但求有利災民絕不應存公私之畛域。若機關林立。各自爲政。各不相謀則力分利薄。耗費且鉅。而災民乃直接蒙受絕大之損失。揆諸救災初衷。詎能謂是。假如辦理賑務者。無論其爲官爲。義但使人人都確能具有救人自救助人自助之共信。則自有開誠佈公袒懐以示之互信。惟共信之不立互信乃無由而生。互信不生。行動乃各不相謀。國人做事。嚮多如此。於此迫不容緩之救命工作。倘未能以一致之步調。合力共籌此則眞足令吾人深爲流淚太息者矣。吾人以爲目前無論官賑義賑。宜親密聯絡。宜精誠合作。宜共同籌劃。以責人之心責己。信己之心信人。負責者本其至誠。努力於其所事。未負責者則嚴厲監督。鼓舞其精神。而責成其功。效負責者固有責。未直接負責者亦有責。出災黎於洪水而登之袵席。則我責已盡。我心亦慰。功與名我固不計也。</p>
<p>抑又有言者。急賑宜急全國災區。待賑皆急。已籌之欵及現存之欵。固宜提出急賑。即不敷之欵亦宜急由國庫或出金融機關設法暫墊。再籌欵付還。絕不能就目前籌得之欵數。爲放賑之標準至於賑濟之辦法。尤應注重急賑後之工賑與農。賑吾人以爲工賑工。作應由國内水利機關。切實研究。過去水利工程計劃。决之於會議。筆之於書牘。昭告於國人。非不洋大觀也。然而空有計劃。迄未實行。因循延宕。今已陷全國於慘刧。往者不咎。目前亟應商籌應急實踐之計劃。務期切實做到。以災民致力於工程。以賑充作經費。事半功倍。機不宜失責無旁貸水利機關素稱閑職。「養兵千日用在一朝」際茲急難。吾人亟盼全國水利機關有以自見於國人。次之農工作亦至重要災地生計。賴以恢復。災後民食。賴以補助。災後播種蔬菜小收。明春發給種籽農具。都宜預有精密之計。劃切實做去。全國農業機關及實業部中央農業研究所。於研究如何進行此種計。劃蓋亦責無旁貸。至於一切實施計劃。自應由専家集議决定。决非一般人所可懸擬臆度。故際此民族生死關頭。有財者固應輸其財。有力者固應出其力。有専能者則尤應窮其思。</p>
<h3>日本前任首相濱口雄幸逝世</h3>
<p>日本前任首揆民政黨前任總裁濱口雄幸氏。已於今日三時許逝世矣。氏生於一八七○年。（明治三年）於一九二九年七月二日膺命組閣。去年十一月以出席岡山陸軍特别大演習。被暴徒狙擊於東京車站。調養迄今。終以邁年受創。無法恢復其康健。而以殂謝聞。</p>
<p>在濱口遇剌之初。繼任代理首相問題。曾引起日本政局上絕大不安定之政潮。民政黨本身。亦以繼在總裁問題。引起極嚴重之動盪情勢。但自今年四月十三日若槻就任民政當總裁。并奉命組閣後。濱口乃漸爲世人所忘却。其未能忘却者。乃濱口個人之健康問題。而非其所關係於日本政治上之地位。綜計濱口内閣之政績。爲金解禁與財政緊縮。爲處置三大賄案。爲減稅。爲樹立國防新計劃。而其外交政策。則爲對美獲得諒解對蘇聯絡。對華緩和彼以堅固之操守。謙虚之衷懐耿忠心。以從事政治其個人人格。頗爲一般日人所崇讚。然而無如其政治生命。恰與世界經濟。一同走入蹇途。界經濟之普遍蕭寥。使日本爲空前之大不景氣所苦。失業人數激增。因之濱口内閣之金解禁與緊縮節約政策遂被在野敵黨所痛斥。爲造成不景象之大因而防不勝防救不勝救之失業羣衆。囂擾幾於不可終日。政友會提出嚴重之責難。。無產政黨復作打倒之狂呌。在責難紛至風雨飄搖之危局下。而濱口終於以被剌聞</p>
<p>濱口死矣。昨日吾人得英工黨内閣更迭之消息。今又聞濱口之噩耗。在世界經濟不景氣惡潮衝激之下。遂使全世界經濟家政治家同感束手無以應付。是則世界局勢之轉捩。或亦可隱若望見其前途乎。</p>

<h3>記侗五將軍</h3>
<p>— 祝融氏</p>
<p>溥西園將軍。名侗。行五。故皆稱之爲侗五將軍。别字紅豆觀主旗人。號至貝勒。生平最喜歌劇。天賦獨厚。嗓瀏亮而宏潤。武工卓絕。文武崑亂。生旦凈丑。無一不精。乃戲劇界中之奇才也。北平票友衆。莫不推五爲魁首。即譚派入室之言菊朋（時尙未下海亦一票友。）王君直二人。亦自嘆弗如。遜清皇室。喜平劇頗不乏人。如濤貝勒之能猴子。戲請進於兪菊笙。爲人稱道。然視五將軍。瞠乎其後矣。琴界耆宿陳彥衡君。對於戲劇。於譚英秀獨得其秘。其視内外行。鮮有贊許。即賢如余岩。寖寖乎執目下鬚生之牛耳。陳尙力指其疵。而對於侗五將軍則尊之不衰。且有勝過英秀之譽。其藝之進且博。自不待言。英秀中年。尙演武生。改鬚生後。常請益於侗。侗鑒於英秀之技。乃歷指大老（程長庚）余三勝張二奎汪大頭等之韻味腔字。英秀能集衆家所長。蔚成大觀。爲一代之宗匠。故英秀之藝。謂得之於侗。亦無不可。將軍幼即嗜歌。日惟觀劇爲樂。所有劇界名人。生如程長庚余三勝張二奎等凈。如金秀山何桂山等。旦如時小福楊朶雲余紫雲等。武生如兪潤仙（菊笙）黃胖（月山）楊月樓等。小生如徐小香王楞仙等。銅鎚如黃三穆麻子等。武丑如張黑。丑如劉趕三等。皆曾親灸。且能得其所長。以此將軍文武不擋。崑亂全才。較之英秀。有過無不及。時人謂内行有譚英秀。票肥有侗將軍。可稱雙絕。洵非虚語。北平戲院。每有票友會串之日。凡將軍登臺。萬人空巷。爭先恐後。座無空隙。雖譚英秀亦不能勝之。譚在日。聞侗漏臉。輒避之輟演。蓋兩雄不並立。恐損及盛譽也。其爲内外行傾倒者如此。且侗豋臺之時。非専演鬚生。興之所至。生旦凈丑。文武崑亂。隨心排演。可想見其藝之精矣。言菊朋之能得佳譽。上次至申。聲名斐然。亦皆將軍之力居多。以言爲將軍之弟子也。前日。將軍之申。海上名票。莫不以一見丰釆爲快。其爲人和藹可親。非似其他遜清皇室。陋習可增。談笑生風。令人解頣。葉君庸方。宴之於大雅樓上。即席作歌。淵淵作金石聲。韻味幽長。字名正確。洵不同凡響也。</p>
<h3>室人之謫</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>人生難免有不如意事。而家庭間室人交謫。尤感無量之隱痛。據英國華爾費耳特博士之研究。此種交謫之言。出乎妻室之口。大足影響其夫之健康。而無形中促短其壽命。同時關於女子方面。訾論紛紜。不稍諒解亦往失却精神上之調和。易成面色蒼老之現象。誠所謂兩敗俱傷也。</p>
<p>博士之意。以爲人之思想係造成强健體力之重要元素。故心平氣和。復得飲食與休息之調劑。庶能逐漸增進體力。若夫婦違言。雙方思想交受重大之感觸。體内各部。亦隨而大受影響。尤其在進餐時間。必四　空氣。充分愉快。然後所進食品。易於消化。否則人身細胞之分泌。因心事惡劣而不暢。結果即爲疾病之源云。博士所言如此。今之夫婦居室。好作無謂之爭者。思之或能知所返乎。</p>
<h3>節食助賑之我見</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>今有災民五六千萬之衆。佔全民什一之數而有奇。非以九人之力。扶助一人。殆無可使存活之方然而九人之中。老弱婦孺。必居過半八口人家。所賴不過一夫。其無餘力負擔。可斷言也。國家縱募一千萬元之公債。而供五六千萬人之食。每人平均不及銀元二角。是則朝不保暮。僅謀一飽而已。欲爲長治久安之策誠岌岌乎難之。上海人口近三百萬。若以什一之比。即當平增三十萬口。而民食爲天。但就食米而論。每日所需。平增五六千石。年需三千萬元。將自何處來耶。然吾深長思之。吾國人於仁義道德之心。秉數千載相沿之習。大多猶未淪亡。但使無損於己。而有益於人。無不肯爲其事。今如一人之食。曩非三大满碗不可。顧念嗷嗷待哺之。人改三满碗爲三淺。碗則其所節省者。適爲十分之一。以有餘而補不足。當無患乎米荒。或謂强飯爲佳。自昔但勸加。餐豈宜節食。殊不知强飯加餐。爲勉客中水土不服。食不下咽者言。而東坡養生之訣。其要旨只有八字。「已飢方食。未飽先止」正與食毋求飽之訓。同一作用。固無害於生理。而適合於衛生。惟其所省之錢。仍在囊中。所省之米。仍在市中。市中之米。非錢不賣。災民又何從得食。是在節食者。當發宏願。願以所節之食。移助災民。則推食之惠。始可見諸實際。例如八口之家。每用四升米者。當其炊時。自加限制。减其四合。並告家人。以食無求飽之旨。力關强飯加餐之謬。則無論老幼。自必動色而聽。得九分飽。亦不致於枵腹無疑也。所省四合。若行倉儲之制。則月儲一石者。必有一斗之剩餘。即於下月領儲米時。割捨一斗。以助災賑。宜爲當然可能之事。人民對於政府所辦慈善事業。自必信任逾恒。宜不待夫强而後可。然則上海一市人口。平增三十萬時。亦不致有走險之虞。可斷言也。夫人性本善。猶水就下儒者言仁。釋者言慈。皆不外乎明其明德。使本善之性。不爲物欲所蔽。正如拭鏡使明。去舊染之汚苟有其術。收效不過指顧問耳。是故循善誘責在先覺。假令學校軍隊。以及工商廠號。團體家庭。競倡節食助賑之議。姑無論其能否一律實行。但使以一傳十。同聲鼓吹。則自然而然。得其感化。一餐之飯有餘。即下餐之炊自减。水到而渠成。則民食問題已得解决。進而敎之。使謀生產。不使災民反爲坐食之人。則平治之道。其庶幾乎矣。（移酬助賑請由貴館彙登）</p>
<h3>太白樓漫談</h3>
<p>— 何鉏月</p>
<p>一昨。張炎君「記太白祠之遊」。謂祠在采石翠螺山麓。蓋誤樓爲祠。祠則别在謝家山也。又謂翠螺山下有衣冠墓。亦誤。按墓在蔡巷。與翠螺山。尙隔一衣帶水耳。</p>
<p>樓實爲彭雪琴所建。有明成化時重建之樓。早於陽一役。聞樓下四壁。昔有清初名畫家蕭尺木山水亦同時遭燬。彌復可惜。</p>
<p>今樓下石壁。存彭雪琴梅花四軸。疎枝側幹。古色古香。生動腕下。各題以一絕。佳句如「三生石上因緣在。結得梅花下用修」。風流佚宕。耐人尋思。</p>
<p>樓中昔庋五色香爐。斑斕可愛。爲千年希有物。本山產。經良工磨琢而成。一巨一小。巨者已爲馬甲武力搜去。小者尙存鎭紳魯叔貽家。可造謁索觀。</p>
<p>凭樓窗。俛瞰長江。破天門峽滾滾東來烟渡浩森。有時見孤帆遠影碧空盡也。而靑山送秀。白纻延爽。撲人眉宇間。輒思古人一生愛入名山遊矣。</p>
<p>樓後可幽栖。修竹成林。緑陰满地。有曲徑。迤邏通桃源。每至暮春三月。散花成綺。羣鶑亂飛。徘徊其下。無復知有塵世。佳絕勝絕。</p>
<p>更正　前日湖樓詩話（下）『小紅簾底一聲簫』誤「小」爲「水」又『一則徙倚窗舷』誤「徙倚」爲「從侍」又『被選雙圏』應改「雙圏」爲「相同」</p>
<h3>東北考察隨筆（三）</h3>
<p>— 劉穗九</p>
<p>正殿四週所鋪方磚。均係以金礦石爲之。亦稱風金石。俗傳皇帝金磚鋪地。此金礦石即取此意。正殿階下。刻石龍二條。俗名爲龍道。有清時無論何人。不准在此道行走。書稱皇帝爲「陛下」即指此處而言正殿後爲隧道。隧道後有照壁。相傳此壁之瓦所製之花。均有暗號。移動某瓦。瓰即可開啓。進入寳鼎。（埋骨處也）寳鼎以前之樓。爲大明樓。中爲漢满蒙三體文大碑碑文曰「太宗文皇帝之陵。」此碑係漢白玉所製成。高約二丈。隆恩門前有碑一座名爲「神功聖德碑」。此外有石象。石駝。石馬。石馬有二。一名大清。一名二清清太宗在遼陽被明總兵李成梁逮捕時。即得此馬之力逃出者。因傳前清國號大清。或源於此云。昭陵爲瀋陵二大皇陵之一。其他一陵曰福陵。</p>
<p>（四）清太祖得力於三國志與水滸傳</p>
<p>福陵建築方式。約如北陵而稍。遜爲清代開國第一皇帝努兒哈赤NURHACHU太祖高皇帝之陵寢努兒哈赤氏。於十七世紀初期併呑满洲諸小部落。建都瀋陽。（奉天）於一六四四年推翻明朝。侵入中原</p>
<p>努兒哈赤姓愛新覺羅氏。满語義爲「金族」。意即女眞之遺族幼年因繼母撫育寡恩常自食其力。採人參松之類往撫順市求售。萬曆末年。江南商賈多往來於撫順。努兒哈赤因得探悉漢族情形。頗愛讀三國演義及水滸傳。因模仿宋江劉玄德爲人。。其一生功業多得力於此二書</p>
<p>满清開國二大偉人。（太祖與太宗）一得力於三國志與水滸傳之陶冶。一得力於明臣洪承疇之擘畫。故明朝亡國。非满人取之。漢人自失之耳</p>
<p>满洲民族。崛起長白山。奠都瀋陽。其先代祖陵均在瀋陽近郊。故遷都北平後。。歷代皇帝屢有巡幸奉天。親謁祖陵之典禮。以示不忘其祖先。提三尺劍平定白山黑水。開三百年之帝業也。或考清代東巡謁陵之制。始自康熙皇帝。後遂成爲定典。迄雍正乾隆嘉慶道光。均遵守祖制。約百六十年間。鑾與巡幸東北。前後達十一次。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（九二）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>若照此說明。崇拜生殖器并非穢　。亦并非侮慢與戲弄乃神聖尊嚴高尙清凈以至太極無極。反乎先天大道。與吾道敎甚合。吾意道敎亦自西天來爲婆羅門之一派耳婆羅門名爲清凈。即印度敎也。印度不名印度。本名婆羅門回敎人加以印度敎之名耳至婆羅門敎之内容。高深廣遠。所謂四韋陀經典瑜伽倫等。皆與相通佛敎亦由此變化而出非吾人所能了解。全世界人無能了解者。此歐人著作中所常見也。如佛敎滅度後之稱識法相者皆應時而發生。變相之印度哲學。與佛法溝通而圓成者也。總之全印度爲神秘之民族文化無人能確切了解。如循環小數不可窮其首尾也。嗚呼。四五千年之歷史迄今有三萬二之民族（回敎七千萬除外）世界上任何第一等哲學家。無敢抗議。向印人講宗敎哲學者而其崇拜起源乃爲陰陽生殖器。不亦可怪乎。</p>
<p>過午。余到恒河。中河冬季已大半乾。水不甚清。然尙可浴則見水邊有木架懸鐘有人打鐘一打鐘則男女皆入河而浴。其法置一木牀於河中淺水凡來者可在木牀上浴穿脫衣服皆可沿河木牀百架。乃受洗者租借之用。入浴即受洗也。浴罷僧人爲畫額上五采以别誌之其怪狀難窮詰。博士律師等來此受畫者不少。然婦女點額法則不同男人點額怪奇百出如吾之唱戯女性則否。點額只輕淡一點。乃屬於清潔嬌美式。而帶一點聖靈之意逈巽雄性之醜怪性可代表雄性。嬌美可帶表女性。猶之　殺性可代表雄性。慈愛性可代表女性與母性也。即同此點額受洗之儀式。而性判若天淵矣。而一般所稱學者罕見及此。</p>

<p>市場槪况近日銀洋需求雖不瑣繁、而趨勢已入佳境故釐拆市價大都盤旋而上、至於金融界業務方面、當此水患頻仍、商貨窒滯之秋、欲求盛象、在理勢上似難有濟、不過滬埠爲貫澈中西之大都會、彼塞此通、一能一槪而論故大部份商貨依然有進出口者、惟連日颶風、商輪禁止出口略感停頓耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋釐）早市釐價因買氣微弱、遂而下洊較前午小去二毫半、爲七錢二分五厘半、午市忽然又挺、爲七錢二分五厘八毫七忽半結果較前日早市好起半厘、（銀拆）早市一錢七分、午市一錢九分、較前日亦好二三分、總之形勢步步見漲、故劃頭加水竟達二錢之巨、而銀行掛牌則有七分行市、</p>

<h3>證劵交割聲中之證券市</h3>
<p>今明兩日證交辦理交割停市　　今日證券交易所因辦理各債券八月期貨交割前結算、明日復爲辦理交割、均行停市、聞交割數超過上月份頗巨、昨日則爲八月期已停市、而十月期貨猶未開拍、遂僅有九月期一種交易因債市環象靜定、各方咸注意準備交割、故市况較清、市塲人心渙散、進出寥寥、關稅整六均無交易編遣亦祇下午略有開出其他進出亦稀、至各債市價亦呆滯如前全日祇數角上落、較前日略小二三角不等、祇裁兵二○關現貨稍漲計、全日現貨交易僅三千元、期貨共約一千四百四十萬元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市大疲</h3>
<p>本月份交貨者日見加多</p>
<p>紗市軟化、因實需漸清、而各路水災日趨嚴重往後對於銷失望、、而本月份交貨太多、收貨者較缺、且均係十支粗紗、所以人心又見十分恐慌</p>
<p>人標跌二兩弱交易所人標前市開盤以美棉微跌、而本月份市氣不振、跌一兩、遠月亦被牽動、各月跌一兩四五錢、午後聞現紗交易又清人心仍弱、各月跌三四五六錢成交計三萬包、查賣出廣豐七百五十包、長豐一千零五十包、同餘七百五十包、振大五百包、元德四百五十包愼記五百包、買進和愼六百包、愼昌四百五十包永昌五百五十包厚豐昌九百包茲將人標收盤價録左</p>

<h3>棉市跌風又起</h3>
<p>棉市大疲、實以天氣轉晴狂風暴雨業已告一段落、而美棉趨勢仍屬衰弱不振、終在過剩時代决無十分大反動金價亦平平、散多又現恐慌之狀、惟本埠多數以各路水災劇烈、拉進做多者不少外棉因貨物太多、亟謀出路價格仍願特别遷就、所以照世界大勢狀况論之、前途難入光明之路也、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市明定暗緊</h3>
<p>南市昨日到船計平湖二號、靑角帮一號、蘇同帮一號、城鄉去路不暢、且各路水災、人心惶惶嗣經社會局訓令限盤、常帮頂貨不得超過十七元外、近二日受大風雨之影響、故蘇常白粳及同里北　等貨、明定暗緊薄稻高貨定局、次色提起二尺洋杜尖及變陰元乏貨無市、</p>
<p>新閘昨日内地到頭稀少蘇州河下存積船戶一百餘號、約米一萬五千擔左右、各貨行盤喊起二尺、照此形勢貨少胃活、靑黃不接檔口市情難以捉摸、河下斛開二三千石、</p>
<h3>洋米逐漲四五角</h3>
<p>本市風災之影響···洋米新有成交　　昨日洋米市况因滬上已受風災人心一致向上、而河下白米已跳漲一元以上高洋米前天漲一二角昨天又漲二三角、共大有四五角矣、即普通貨亦較大二三角、夫胃以本街爲主、囤戶更爲活動、昨日漲風尤烈、但白粳被市當局限價高漲、昨日開一號西貢二百包、價十五元四角、香港米一百包價十四元、敏當二百包、價十三元七角二分、江西機元米一百七十包、價十四元八角、</p>
<p>洋米有洋行兜售、計新成交有安利料行轉准小絞二千噸、價六兩六錢、十月份裝船、祥茂則打出電報三千噸、係十一月份裝船小絞三千噸價爲六兩四錢半、價未過漲也、</p>
<h3>標粉竟見狂落</h3>
<p>昨晶粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均一致暴落下已因大批洋麥陸續成交、廠家之抛數、極形湧旺、大小廠之出檔者數達四十餘萬包、内地帮方面因水災如是重、粉銷始終不暢即天津一處之實銷、平均祇日銷二三萬包、申粉去化之不旺、此爲最大之主因人心旣夫望又經廠家之抛售、故跌勢甚狂、當此風災之後、市面反暴跌不已、殊爲一般人所意想不到也結果本月份較前日跌二分九月份跌二分半、十月份跌三分二厘半、十一月份跌三分、半十二月份跌三分七厘半、一月份跌三分云、</p>
<h3>麥市慘跌之主因</h3>
<p>廠家大訂澳麥···美麥賑華將成事實</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、均一致呈慘落之象以本埠雖曾風雨猛烈、一度引起人心之激昂、迨至昨日開價、則人心驟形大變因傳某人廠又有大兹澳洲二號麥定成初傳十五萬噸聞確實成交、係五萬噸價三兩八錢半、每蒲式耳五十五磅半、中小廠家亦定成一萬噸、其餘小批成交、不計其數、同時又傳美麥賑華、將成事實、因此人心大虚、急於賣出套頭之抛壓、亦異常湧暢故一瀉直下、大有不可收拾之勢、本月份因交割關係廠無問津跌厲亦銳觀此後如粉銷不起仍看疲象結果本月份比前日跌一錢一分、九月份跌一錢三分、十·十一月份跌一錢一分、十二月份跌一錢、一月份跌八分、現麥因廠家不動、全市未開云、</p>

<h3>政記公司廣利輪船沉没</h3>
<p>駛至靑島港外突遇颶風失事溺斃乘客十五</p>
<p>此次颶風、外海長江内河航輪、全部停阻水面交通斷絕者、歷四十八小時之久、而政記公司廣利輪船、竟至遇風沉没、溺斃旅客、茲將記者調查所得、分誌如下、</p>
<p>失事原因政記輪船公司之廣利號、係行駛靑島威海衛安東各埠此次自安東經劉公島至靑島、船上裝載客貨過多、已超越運貨限度、該輪雖裝有無線電報、但因電報員疏忽、未將颶風警電譯告船主、以致未能預防、及至二十五日、船至靑島港外、颶風發生、船主日人臨時倉皇、欲求駛入海岸避風、不料因儎脚過重、觸入暗礁、初僅擱淺、繼因船底破裂、風浪過大、、遂致沉没</p>
<p>旅客死亡廣利輪今次在安東威海衛各地、載有乘客八十五名、船身觸礁之後受大風急浪之衝打下沉甚速因各船均避風不開、故此際海面、殊無船行、雖經船主發S0S求救信、號並無一船來救、致全部乘落海、後經某商輪得訊到來、協同救護、聞救出旅客七十名、尙有十五名溺斃、又該輪船長大副爲日本人、船員水手爲中國人、該輪失事之後、亦均落海、有無喪亡滬行未得電告、但聞烟臺靑島各埠政記公司、已派船往救矣、</p>
<p>滬局電詢昨日記者往該局詢問、據該局金介福君言、廣利由安東至靑島、並非上海開去、故詳情未知、但滬局已去電往詢云「報載利觸礁確、否示復、」此電在午前發出、至午後確聞廣利已經沉没查該輪毛噸爲一千三百八十噸、吃水十三英尺、係一千八百九十七年所造船係鐵壳、政記買進後、派行華北各埠、今回失事、雖屬大風、誤於接電人及日船主之無應變才、船員下落、猶未明暸、滬局尙未得到詳細電告也、</p>
<p>按招商局亦有廣利輪已在厦門平安開出、日日社記者曾因此誤會、昨向招商局詢、問已由該局總辦郭外峯、切實聲明矣</p>
<h3>颶風息後航輪脫誤失事</h3>
<p>英輪擱淺太古公司之長江船鄱陽號今次由漢口下水來回、詎船過安慶、颶風即起、鄱陽輪欲抛泊暫避乃在南京之上安慶之下、地名FITZROG島即遇風擱淺船體陷入江灘、無法移動、當由該船長電告滬行乞援、昨日該公司立即轉電南京分行、派輪往失事地拖救矣、</p>
<p>無船進口昨日大風雖息、而在吳淞外阻停之輪船、僅麥狄遜一艘、開入浦江、其他若金華·澤生·定生·吳淞·湘潭·等輪、昨日應行進口者、亦均未到、祇日清之長江船襄陽丸到滬、其他各船、大約須於本日方克來滬也、</p>
<p>滬甬延期今次大風滬甬班輪已兩日未開、昨日仍未出口、招商局之新江天三北之寗興輪等、今日可以自寗波來滬滬、甬班本日可以照常通航、又溫台班輪大華、則在滬避風未開、舟山輪歲修入塢、穿山輪自上星期三離台州者、直至昨日始到海也、途中因避風誤期又益利達興兩船、迄無消息、大致在途中避風、</p>
<p>長江船開長江船已有兩天未開至昨日爲第三日矣、昨午風息以後、各江輪始續駛出吳淞、候今晨與瑞陽丸平和輪等同時赴上游、今日始方能恢復原狀也、通崇海及揚州之小長江輪、統統延期脫班、須本日方可排準開行也、</p>
<p>郵船延緩郵船出口、素來不許誤延時刻今回大風事出例外、日郵社之上海丸、昨已宣布、因脫班改緩兩天、至今日方始赴日、大來之麥狄遜輪、原擬昨赴西雅圖者、因風阻遲、到改緩一天、至今日往美、又有克里夫　者、亦以大風延滯、改後日開行、定今日赴小呂未香港、日郵之龍田丸亦改遲、一天進口郵船誤班、爲向所未有之事也、</p>

<p>自前日午後颶風到滬後、間以急雨風勢愈狂、雨亦愈驟、入晚風雨尤大爲勢之猛烈、一若排出倒海而來至夜問十時浦江大潮、爲狂風驅迫上岸、望平街一帶水深二尺、本館樓下、亦被水浸入、深約尺許、激盪有聲、至昨晨黎明、風勢稍殺、雨亦衰微、水始漸退去、惟大批報販於天明六時、至望平街時水猶没踝、其時報業已印畢、以爲可將前夜大風雨情狀本告之讀者矣、詎報販分報、向席地爲之、今以大水、竟不能分派、故昨日本報及其他各報、均未能送達、斯爲可惜耳至十時許、本館門前水始退盡、昨日午後、大風雨離此繁華之上海而去、街頭緑樹濃陰、凉風拂彿頗有秋意、而前夜恐怖之情狀、已隨風雨而惧逝、茲將全市各區大風雨所遭之損害、分誌於次、</p>
<h3>福州路巡房前之積水（本報攝）</h3>

<h3>租界方面</h3>
<p>英法兩租界各馬路自前晚起、積水没踝交通斷絕、南京路·福州路·漢口路·等繁盛街道、直至昨午水始續漸退去、及至夕陽西下、路上車塵馬足、、一返未雨前之景象矣</p>
<p>水浸銀庫大美晚報云九江路一號、花旗銀行庫内、昨（二十五）夜大潮上泛時、亦被侵入、積水自九呎至十二呎不等所有數白萬銀幣銀條、及鈔票等悉遭水浸、當今晨（二十六）開行時、門前馬路猶一片汪洋、行員皆以汽車黃包車臨時載渡、旋即通知救火會、派救火車到行、始將庫内積水抽出、庫中銀幣銀條、當然不受影響、惟大保險櫃内藏有未發行鈔票數百萬元倘被水灌入、恐將與已發行之巨額鈔票、同遭毀損、至該行今日營業所需欵項、係取諸另一庫、房故未虞匱乏亦未求助他行、</p>
<p>地層灌水又前夕大水時本埠中區各大厦之地底一層、浸水者至少有二十所、除花旗銀行外、如上海電力公司·上海電話公司·上海總會·大來洋行·北京戯院等均告灌水、今晨救火會派車前往、分别抽水甚形忙碌、</p>
<p>影響電話上海電話公司之電話線經颶風暴雨之襲擊、所有通往接線間之總電纜、與通往用户家中之分電纜現有十七根發生障、碍須俟馬路水退後、抽去入孔内之積水、始能修理、因此今日各接線間内接線非常擁擠、該公司已通告各用户、請暫時少打電話、冀可疏通電路、免致擁塞、</p>
<p>樹倒地鬆公共租界外灘自外白渡橋起、至四馬路口止路　所　之各樹　　全被風吹向西倒、亦有數棵連根起者、愛多亞路靜安寺路兩旁之樹、傾斜被拔者亦頗不少、英大馬路所舖之柏油木因水浸潤、迨水退時、鬆起浮於水面者有十餘處之多水去後、工部局即派大批工人、分叚舖築以維交通、</p>
<p>電車停駛公共租界之電車、至上午十時後、所有八九兩路係自外洋涇浜至楊樹浦者其他一路·二路·三路等車、直至午後三時半、始出廠、上午各電車站口乘客、守候者頗多、此去彼來、咸久候咨嗟而去、法租界電車以方斜路水深盈尺、呂班路亦有積水、電車不能出廠、至上午十一時許呂班路水宣泄電車始漸出廠、計第一路·第二路·第十路·先後出廠·第四路不能通、行·第三路·第六路·至下午二時始由呂班路·霞飛路·公館馬路·八仙橋街、小北門等處行道入軌照常開行、其十八路無軌電車係上午準時開出、</p>
<p>馬路浸水前晚風雨大作之時法租界新老界各馬路、如公館馬路中段、東西自來火街·菜市街·八仙橋·麥底安路·及馬浪路·辣斐德路均積水成河、一片汪洋而各處里弄積水尤深、浸人居家因此行駛各路電車提早進廠、惟各商店所懸牌招、被大風捲去者頗多、直至昨晨八時許、雨稍停止各馬路所積之水、始得漸漸退去、</p>
<p>電燈熄滅法租界公館馬路東西新橋街及八仙橋、曁鄭家木橋街等一帶所裝電燈、於前晚八時三十分大風緊張之際、將總線吹斷、頃刻之間、電燈即熄頓成黑暗世界、各商號因風雨大作之時、大部份均提早收、市電氣公司事後急派工匠往修、直至九時三十五分、始行修理竣工重放光明、</p>

<p>敵軍被攻各處動搖了、我軍亟應加緊痛擊、所有各師兵力統應趕快開入火線、所以貴第三軍的進攻前曾展期到八月廿一日、到期即應會同第一軍各師和第四軍全部協力猛攻、貴軍八九十三天大勝之後、各軍部隊如猶豫不前則未免坐失時機了、</p>

After Chen finished reporting, the committee members discussed the wording and then passed the bill on the third reading. The entire audience applauded unanimously. (August 26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Central Political Council Stipulates Donation Methods for Disaster Relief by Public Servants</h3>
<p>Nanjing - The Central Political Council held its 286th meeting this morning, chaired by Yu Youren. The resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The flood situation is serious throughout the country. All officials and employees of state-owned enterprises, teachers of public schools, employees of public education institutions, and comrades working in party headquarters should donate salaries for disaster relief. The regulations stipulate that those with a monthly salary of more than 100 yuan should donate 5 percent, those with more than 200 yuan should donate 10 percent, those with more than 400 yuan should donate 15 percent, and those with more than 600 yuan should donate 20 percent, for a period of three months. All agencies should deduct disaster relief donations first in September, October, and November of this year.</p>
<p>(2) All proposals and suggestions regarding raising funds for disaster relief will be submitted to Committee Member Shao Yuanchong for review.</p>
<p>(3) The Executive Yuan stated in a letter that, according to a report from the Hebei Provincial Government, the head of the Provincial Industry Department, He Yufang, proposed that labor-capital dispute matters be included in the duties of the Civil Affairs Department in accordance with Article 10, Clause 7 of the revised Provincial Government Organization Law. Also, Article 14, Clause 10 of the same law stipulates matters related to farmers' associations, labor unions, business associations, fishermen's associations, and other agricultural, industrial, commercial, fishing, and mining groups. Therefore, the registration and management of each group and whether its organization is sound and legal, as well as the group's own disputes that are not related to labor-capital disputes, are all handled by this office. However, it is found that all reform matters of each group are very easy to involve labor-capital disputes. Is the Labor and Industry Bureau to handle all issues between labor and capital when there is no dispute, and then transfer them to the Civil Affairs Department after a dispute occurs, or are all labor-capital incidents, regardless of whether there is a dispute, to be managed by the Civil Affairs Department? Please provide clear regulations to clarify the authority. The committee of this government decided that matters concerning labor-capital disputes should still be handled by the Industry Department for the time being. Please put it on record. The decision was made by the 35th State Council meeting of this Yuan, and it was sent to the Central Political Council for review. It was decided that matters concerning labor-capital disputes should be temporarily handled by the Industry Department. (August 26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Reports on the Diplomatic Situation</h3>

<p>(1) The investigation report on the Wang (Jingwei) Incident in Korea and the report from Consul General Zhang will be formally published today.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Word for Those Handling Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The hurricane and torrential rain the other day have made the terrible and tragic scenes suffered by the disaster areas even more serious. This makes us more aware of our own responsibility for the relief effort. Therefore, those who are currently responsible for handling relief affairs, whether it is official relief or voluntary relief, must first cooperate sincerely and work together to plan, so that we can achieve twice the result with half the effort and not waste our energy. Setting up a meeting to raise funds is for disaster relief, and running around calling for donations is also for disaster relief. Although official and voluntary relief differ in nature, their goals are the same. There are only obligations in disaster relief work, no rights. We only seek benefits for the disaster victims and should never harbor public or private boundaries. If agencies are set up everywhere, each acting on its own and not communicating with each other, then the effort will be divided and the benefits will be thin, and the consumption will be huge, while the disaster victims will directly suffer huge losses. How can we say that this is in line with the original intention of disaster relief? If those who handle relief affairs, whether they are officials or volunteers, can ensure that everyone truly has the common belief of saving people, saving themselves, helping others, and helping themselves, then there will naturally be open and honest mutual trust. Only when a common belief is established can mutual trust arise. If mutual trust does not arise, then actions will not be communicated to each other. The Chinese people tend to do things like this. In this urgent life-saving work, if we cannot work together with a consistent pace, then it is truly enough to make us weep and sigh deeply. We believe that at present, whether it is official relief or voluntary relief, we should be closely connected, cooperate sincerely, and plan together. Judge oneself with the heart of judging others, and believe in others with the heart of believing in oneself. Those who are responsible should work hard in their work with their utmost sincerity, and those who are not responsible should strictly supervise and encourage their spirit, and hold them accountable for their achievements. Those who are responsible have responsibilities, and those who are not directly responsible also have responsibilities. To bring the disaster victims out of the flood and put them on the mat, then our responsibilities have been fulfilled, and our hearts are also comforted. We do not care about fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some say that urgent relief should be urgent. All disaster areas across the country are in urgent need of relief. The funds that have been raised and the existing funds should be used for urgent relief. Even if the funds are insufficient, the state treasury or financial institutions should find ways to temporarily advance the funds and then raise funds to repay them. We must never use the amount of funds currently raised as the standard for relief. As for the method of relief, we should pay attention to labor relief and agricultural relief after the urgent relief. We believe that labor relief work should be thoroughly researched by domestic water conservancy agencies. Past water conservancy project plans have been decided in meetings, written in documents, and announced to the people. It is not that they are not grand. However, there are only plans and they have not been implemented. Delaying them has now plunged the country into a terrible disaster. We will not blame the past. At present, we should urgently discuss and plan practical plans to ensure that they are effectively implemented. The disaster victims will work on the projects, and the relief will be used as funds. We can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The opportunity should not be missed, and the responsibility is inescapable. Water conservancy agencies have always been known as idle positions. "Raising soldiers for a thousand days is for using them for one day." At this time of emergency, we urgently hope that water conservancy agencies across the country will show themselves to the people. Secondly, agricultural work is also very important for disaster areas to rely on to restore their livelihoods. Post-disaster food is used to subsidize them. We should have precise plans for planting vegetables and small harvests after the disaster, and for distributing seeds and agricultural tools next spring. The National Agricultural Agency and the Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry should also have the inescapable responsibility to study how to carry out these plans. As for the implementation of all plans, they should be decided by experts through collective discussion and should not be arbitrarily assumed by ordinary people. Therefore, at this critical moment of national life and death, those with wealth should contribute their wealth, those with strength should contribute their strength, and those with expertise should exhaust their thoughts.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi Passes Away</h3>
<p>Former Japanese Prime Minister, former President of the Minseitō, Hamaguchi Osachi, passed away at around 3:00 PM today. He was born in 1870 (Meiji 3) and was ordered to form a cabinet on July 2, 1929. Last November, he was attacked by thugs at Tokyo Station while attending the special army exercises in Okayama. He has been recuperating ever since, but ultimately succumbed to his injuries and passed away.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Hamaguchi's assassination, the issue of who would succeed him as acting prime minister caused a great deal of instability in the Japanese political situation. The Minseitō itself also caused a very serious turbulent situation due to the issue of who would succeed him as president. However, since Wakatsuki Reijirō assumed the presidency of the Minseitō on April 13 this year and was ordered to form a cabinet, Hamaguchi has gradually been forgotten by the world. Those who have not forgotten him are concerned about Hamaguchi's personal health, not his relationship with his position in Japanese politics. In summary, the achievements of the Hamaguchi Cabinet were the lifting of the gold embargo and fiscal austerity, the handling of the three major bribery cases, the tax cuts, and the establishment of a new national defense plan. Its foreign policy was to gain understanding with the United States, contact with the Soviet Union, and ease relations with China. He engaged in politics with firm integrity, humility, and loyalty. His personal character was highly praised by the general Japanese people. However, his political life happened to enter a difficult path along with the world economy. The universal desolation of the world economy has caused Japan to suffer from an unprecedented great depression. The number of unemployed people has increased sharply. As a result, the Hamaguchi Cabinet's policy of lifting the gold embargo and austerity has been severely criticized by the opposition parties as the main cause of the bleak situation. The unemployed masses, who could not be prevented or saved, were in an uproar almost every day. The Seiyūkai raised serious criticisms. The proletarian parties also made crazy calls to overthrow the government. Under the dangerous situation of criticism and turmoil, Hamaguchi was finally assassinated.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi is dead. Yesterday, we received the news of the change of the British Labour Party cabinet. Now, we hear the bad news of Hamaguchi's death. Under the impact of the world economic depression, economists and politicians all over the world feel helpless. Is it possible to see the future of the turning point in the world situation?</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 25th -- MacDonald, at 9:00 PM tonight, broadcasted a speech via radio, detailing recent political developments. It is estimated that no fewer than millions listened to his words. He stated: "I am speaking under extraordinary and very painful circumstances. At this time, I have not changed my beliefs. People say that what I am doing now has not been commissioned by the Labour Party. This is true. I did not say that it was. However, I firmly believe that for the sake of the Labour Party, I should be commissioned. I have received another commission, there is no authority higher than the Labour Party, and that is a commission of state responsibility as I believe it to be. I have obeyed the call and served, regardless of the consequences." MacDonald briefly described the causes of recent events, touching upon the global economic recession and the financial situation in Germany, continuing that the most important thing is that the outside world lacks information about the UK's budgetary status and worries too much. The British government has encountered a financial situation similar to appendicitis. The government intends to take swift, effective, and resolute action to make the world aware of the UK's ability to balance its budget. As for the claim that bankers are conspiring against the Labour government, it is simply not true. The bankers' attitude toward the new government will not differ in the slightest from their attitude toward the Labour government. The government intends to reduce unemployment benefits by 10%, which is extremely fair because the cost of living has already decreased by 11.5%. He asked the people of the country, whether rich or poor, employed or unemployed, to face these difficulties with the determination to overcome them.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th -- A London newspaper reported that American bankers demanded a reduction in benefit payments as a condition for borrowing money. Official circles have now denied this, stating that neither the Treasury Department nor the Bank of England is aware of American bankers having made such a demand.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th -- The Conservative Party is scheduled to hold a general assembly on the 28th of this month, at which members of both the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament will also be present. Party leader Baldwin will explain his decision to join the new government to implement the necessary emergency financial reforms. The Liberal Party will also convene a similar general assembly on the same day.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th -- After the formation of the new government, the whole country expressed optimism. All newspapers, except for the Labour Party's Daily Herald, supported the new cabinet and praised MacDonald's courage. Although the proposal to reduce unemployment benefits has aroused fierce opposition from labor organizations across the country, those within the Labour Party who support MacDonald may be stripped of their right to be elected. The first stage of the war will be seen today in a joint meeting of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress and the Labor Party Advisory Committee. Although MacDonald's supporters will try to defend him at this meeting, it is a foregone conclusion that the members will pass a resolution criticizing the government. MacDonald himself may not attend, and it is expected that he will resign from his position as leader of the Labor Party. The support that MacDonald has received within the party is less than expected, which can be seen from the fact that MacDonald was unable to recruit more Labour cabinet members. Most of the former Labour cabinet members are unwilling to serve under MacDonald, fearing that it would jeopardize their future political careers. The appointment of Hoare as the head of the India Office by the new government is quite significant. The Conservative Party is confident that it will be able to form a cabinet after the upcoming general election, and Hoare will remain the head of the India Office to handle Indian affairs.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th -- Labour Party members are flocking to Henderson and opposing MacDonald. This phenomenon is quite unexpected. It will not be until after the Labour Party Congress on August 28th that the number of Labor Party members who support the new government becomes questionable. However, it is expected that the number will be between 20 and 50. The government's financial proposals can be expected to be published later this week.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th -- This morning, the former members of the Labour government went to Buckingham Palace to surrender their seals of office to the King. Shortly thereafter, the members of the National Emergency Government arrived at the palace to take their oaths. Thousands of people stood outside the palace watching the new and old cabinet members come and go. The King has decided to travel to Balmoral Palace in Scotland at 6:30 PM tonight to continue his rest. MacDonald sent a private letter to the Labor Party members of the House of Commons, imploring them not to act on emotion or prejudice, and explaining his position and feelings, saying that a great disaster was imminent and that it was necessary to find a way to avoid it for the sake of the country's welfare. He also added that as for the bankers manipulating the market, there is no such issue. MacDonald also said that he recognizes that his actions today will inevitably hinder the Labor Party temporarily, but asked his comrades in the party to wait until he has made the facts clear in Parliament before passing judgment. The Labor Party Executive Committee will decide the political fate of MacDonald and Snowden from the party's perspective today.</p>
<h3>Death of Former Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi</h3>

<h3>German Government Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Regarding the Case of German Ships Shipping Arms to China</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 26th: The German government, having heard that German ships carrying arms were seized in Shanghai, issued a semi-official statement today to express its attitude. The statement claimed that in 1928, the German government issued an order prohibiting the sale of arms to China for a period of twelve months. The order was cancelled upon expiration. Although the German government repeatedly warned ships not to transport arms to China, it has no recourse under current laws to prevent private sales of arms. In this incident, the shipping company requested protection from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but was refused. The Ministry also informed the company that if any problems occurred, it would be responsible. The statement further claimed that the arms seized in Shanghai were all made in Czechoslovakia, not Germany. The aircraft, although of the Junkers type, were also made in Sweden. The statement considered the anti-German movement in southern China to be unfair, as the Nanjing government employed military advisors from all countries, not just Germany. Finally, the statement strongly denied that German chemical engineers were manufacturing poison gas for the Nanjing government.</p>

<h3>36th State Council Meeting of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 36th State Council meeting on the 25th, attended by Ma Fuxiang, Wang Zhengting, and Li Shuhua, and with Zhang Wenhua, Chen Shaokuan, Wei Yifu, and Zheng Hongnian present. Chairman Wang Zhengting discussed the following matters: (1) Vice President Song of this Yuan proposed that the current flood disaster is extremely severe, and relying solely on the 10 million yuan in public bonds is far from sufficient. In recent days, we have been in contact with the United States regarding the shipment of wheat, and it has been negotiated to purchase 7,560,000 dan of American wheat, with costs totaling approximately 40 million yuan in national currency, to be borne by the government, which amounts to 50 million yuan. At that time, the American wheat issue had no practical solution, so it was not announced. Now, the public bonds are still requested to be passed according to the original plan, so that fundraising can be carried out immediately according to the quota. As for whether to issue additional bonds in the future, a separate fund will be established, and a second plan will be made. Please decide whether to proceed in this manner.</p>
<p>Resolution: Approved to proceed with the purchase of American wheat. A formal communication should be sent to the Legislative Yuan requesting that the original plan of the Ministry of Finance to raise 10 million yuan in disaster relief public bonds be passed first. (2) A letter from the Civil Affairs Department of the National Government states that the Yuan's letter regarding the National Assembly's resolution to request the government to allocate 50,000 yuan to build a statue of the President in front of the Assembly Hall has been approved by the Ministry and funds have been allocated accordingly. Regarding whether to designate a responsible organization to handle the project, please forward this for approval. After being submitted to the Standing Committee of the National Government, it was resolved that the Executive Yuan should designate an organization to be responsible for handling the matter. This resolution should be recorded and communicated for reference. Resolution: The Ministry of Education should guide Central University to be responsible for handling the matter. (3) The Ministry of Interior presented a proposal to amend the organization law of the Capital Police Department, which seems feasible. After detailed review and revision, it has been drafted as an amendment and is submitted for approval and implementation. Resolution: To be sent to the Legislative Yuan. (4) The Ministry of Internal Affairs presented a draft of the Provisional Organization Regulations for the Seaport Quarantine Administration, requesting that it be forwarded to the National Government for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review. Resolution: To be sent to the Legislative Yuan. (5) Resolution: To request the special appointment of Sun Weidong as a member of the Relief Committee. (6) Resolution: To request the appointment of Hong Hui as the secretary of the Relief Committee. (7) Resolution: To request the appointment of Yi Min as the colonel warden of the Central Military Prison of the Ministry of Military Affairs.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Disaster Relief Bond Issuance</h3>

The "Regulations on Disaster Relief Bonds of the Ministry of Finance for the 20th Year of the Republic of China" were discussed. It was generally agreed that the disaster situation in various provinces this year is severe, and the government, in order to sympathize with the people's livelihood and provide relief to the victims, should urgently expand the bond amount to make it more universal. Therefore, the originally set bond amount of 10 million yuan was expanded to 80 million yuan. Next, the organizational aspects of the bond supervision and management were discussed, and there were strict regulations. The use of funds was also divided into three categories: emergency relief, work relief, and purchasing grain from overseas. As for the guarantee, it is proposed to use the cigarette tax as the first guarantee, and if it is insufficient, the tobacco and alcohol tax will be used to supplement it. The bond regulations were revised and passed one by one, and submitted to the temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 26th for final discussion.</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan held its 158th meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 26th, attended by 21 committee members, including Shi Weihuan. Chairman Shao Yuanchong discussed the report of the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan on the review of the "Regulations on Disaster Relief Bonds of the National Government for the 20th Year of the Republic of China" and the principal and interest repayment schedule. It was resolved that: (1) The "Regulations on Disaster Relief Bonds of the National Government for the 20th Year of the Republic of China" be amended and passed.

<h3>Qian and Lu Visit Xuzhou to Discuss Road Policy</h3>
<p>There is a Need for Joint Reorganization of the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways have been delayed due to military transport and the impact of floods. Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Administration, telegraphed Lu Zuo, Director of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Committee, to meet in Xuzhou on the 24th to discuss everything. Qian's special train arrived at the Xuzhou Bubei Station at 6:00 a.m. on the 24th, and he got off the train and went to the Longhai reception room to rest. Lu's special train also arrived in Xuzhou from Pukou at 7:00 a.m. and immediately went to the North Station. Qian and Lu then met in Room 1. Among those who came with Qian were Yu Shibin, Director of the General Affairs Department. Among those who came with Lu was Deputy Director Chen of the Transportation Department. The railway staff of the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways in Xuzhou and Zuo Maotang, Director of the Xuzhou Office of the Transportation Department, all went to pay their respects. The reporter visited at 1:00 p.m., just as Qian and Lu had finished their discussions. According to Qian, he and Director Lu had not met since taking office, and the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways need to be jointly reorganized due to their connection. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss with each other. Currently, freight transport on the two railways has resumed. The Transportation Department has returned most of the military transport trains and restored freight transport. Many of the Shibu trains have already been returned. Those that have been recently detained have also been seized and gathered on the Pinghan Railway, waiting to be distributed and returned to the various railways. There was a flood in the Heishiguan area on the western section of the Longhai Railway, and there was also a flood in the Xinan Town area on the eastern section, but they were not very serious and have been fully restored. However, business has been greatly reduced during the military transport period. Lu said that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway used to provide vehicles for military transport, which undoubtedly affected traffic, especially in flood-stricken areas. Fortunately, it has now been restored. All traffic on the southern section is back to normal and needs to be thoroughly repaired. After Qian and Lu talked, they went to the East Station with the staff of the two railways stationed at the station to inspect. At about 9:00 p.m., they returned to Zheng and Pukou by their original trains. According to railway personnel, Qian and Lu considered expanding the platform in Xuzhou and building a joint ticket office for the two railways, with a capital of 250,000 yuan. As there are no specific plans and drawings, it has not been publicly announced in detail. (August 24th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Weicheng Reports on the Handling of the Korean Incident</h3>
<p>From July 3rd to 11th</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The Korean Consulate has submitted a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the handling of the Korean Incident. The report states: "This consulate received a telephone report from the Incheon office at approximately 9:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, stating that around 2:00 AM on the same day, five or six stores, including the Qingyuntang barbershop, located outside Inshan Village, had their glass windows broken by Koreans, who also declared their intention to expel Chinese residents from Incheon. In addition to urgently requesting the Incheon police to provide effective protection, this is being reported accordingly."</p>
<p>"On the same day, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Seoul reported that a Chinese resident, Zhang Yuancheng, was beaten by Koreans outside Guangxi Gate in Seoul at 3:00 AM that day, and two of his assistants were seriously injured. At 11:00 AM, another Chinese resident, Sang Jichang, had his carrying pole and umbrella broken by Koreans at the Penglai-cho bridge in Seoul, and lost most of his three baskets of cucumbers and one cage of softened beans. Two of his assistants were also injured."</p>
<p>"In light of the anti-Chinese riots by Koreans in 1927, and the special edition of the Korean Daily News on the 2nd and 3rd, reporting on the Wanbaoshan Sanxingbao incident, with alarming statements about Chinese officials and civilians attacking Korean residents, which could incite emotions and lead to unforeseen events, this consulate, in addition to requesting various police stations to take measures to stop and prevent such incidents, also took advantage of the departure of Police Chief Wei, deputy consul, to Japan around 10:00 AM. The deputy consul met with the acting head of the foreign affairs section at the station, requesting that he inform all relevant authorities to pay attention to protection. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the deputy consul, accompanied by Secretary Li, personally went to the Korean Governor-General's office to negotiate for protection. At that time, the Governor-General, the Director of Political Affairs, the Director of Police Affairs, the Head of the Foreign Affairs Section, and the Head of the Security Section were all absent from Korea. The deputy consul only met with the acting Head of the Foreign Affairs Section, urging him to increase the number of police and military police and take effective measures to provide protection, stop such incidents, and assured that the authorities would do so immediately and requested that Chinese nationals be notified to be at ease. After an hour-long discussion, they left. Around 8:00 PM, the deputy consul, accompanied by Deputy Consul Ji, inspected the areas where Chinese residents lived, advising them to avoid conflicts. No incidents occurred. However, starting around 10:00 PM that evening, the consulate received a series of telephone reports from Chinese residents in Seoul that their doors and windows were being stoned by Koreans, and that Chinese people encountered on the streets were being beaten. The consulate immediately used the police emergency line to request the military police and various police stations to effectively take measures to stop and protect. By dawn on the 4th, Chinese merchants, farmers, and workers from both inside and outside Seoul were coming to the consulate to report incidents. At the same time, the Incheon office and various chambers of commerce in Seoul and Incheon were sending telegrams stating that the riots by Koreans inside and outside Seoul last night were quite severe, with more than a hundred Chinese residents being harmed. The situation in Incheon was even more dangerous, with Chinese residents successively seeking refuge in Chinatown, and more than ten thousand Koreans gathering to riot everywhere, causing significant losses."</p>
<p>"The consulate then led the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Seoul and the directors of various guilds, and accompanied Secretary Li to visit the acting Head of the Foreign Affairs Section again, emphasizing that the consulate had repeatedly requested attention to protection and prevention before the outbreak of the incident. However, the riots in various places intensified, and the consulate should be held responsible for such damages. The consulate also requested the immediate dispatch of armed military police to protect the lives and property of Chinese residents, to ensure safety and prevent escalation. On one hand, the consulate notified various consulates and branch consulates stationed in Korea, informing them of the anti-Chinese sentiment among Koreans. On the same day, which was the American Independence Day, the consulate met with the American Consul General and reported the facts of the anti-Chinese riots by Koreans, requesting that he uphold justice. As Incheon continued to send urgent appeals, the Consul General went to inspect in person in the afternoon. On his way back to Seoul at 9:30 PM, he saw groups of Koreans acting abnormally, narrowly escaping danger. After returning to the consulate, he inquired about the situation of Chinese residents in Seoul, which was also extremely frightening. There were also rumors circulating that Koreans were planning a larger riot tonight. In addition to requesting the urgent dispatch of an armed support team to Incheon to protect Chinese residents by telephone, representatives from the chamber of commerce and Chinese organizations visited various agencies, legal entities, and newspapers to ask them to ease the emotions of Koreans. More than a thousand people had come to the consulate to seek refuge that day. The consulate also sent a letter to the Korean Director of Political Affairs, requesting that he quickly devise comprehensive protective measures and dispatch armed military police to suppress and stop the riots. That night, all members of the consulate worked through the night, with telegrams flooding in and telephone lines constantly in use. The number of people seeking refuge continued to increase without end."</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 5th (Sunday), accompanied by Deputy Consul Wei, the consulate went to the residence of the acting Head of the Foreign Affairs Section, but learned that he had gone to the Governor-General's office. The consulate then went to the Governor-General's office to discuss the matter, presenting four emergency measures to the acting head, who agreed to contact the police authorities and respond by telephone. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the acting head informed the consulate by telephone that armed military police had been dispatched to Incheon, increasing the police force by three times compared to normal, ensuring safety. He also said that Chinese people in remote areas both inside and outside Seoul could be escorted to the consulate by various police stations for temporary shelter. Police in various areas had been ordered to be fully prepared, and that the areas with a higher concentration of Chinese people in Seoul had been instructed to provide effective on-site protection. At 7:00 PM that evening, the newly appointed Police Chief arrived in Seoul. The Consul General, accompanied by Deputy Consul Wei, went to welcome him and received him in the VIP room. After a brief greeting, the Consul General requested protection for Chinese residents and arranged to meet again the next day. However, that night, the massacre of Chinese residents in Pyongyang occurred, and riots also broke out in Wonsan."</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 6th, accompanied by Secretary Li, the consulate went to see the Police Chief, questioning him about the spread and cruelty of the riots, asking whether the Police Chief could be responsible for protecting all Chinese residents in Korea, and requesting that he order the police in various areas to immediately increase the number of armed military police to stop and prevent the riots. In the afternoon, the Police Chief came to the consulate to pay a return visit, apologize, and express condolences, stating that he had strictly ordered the police departments in various areas to order their subordinates to be vigilant and to reassure Chinese residents. However, that evening, riots broke out again in Gunsan, Mokpo, and other places."</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 7th, accompanied by Secretary Li, the consulate went to see the Police Chief again, questioning him why the riots were still occurring when he claimed that people could be reassured, and that the previous acting Head of the Foreign Affairs Section had repeatedly told people to be reassured, but the scope of the riots had expanded and the situation had become more severe. The Chinese residents could no longer trust the consulate's advice to remain calm and requested attention. At 7:00 PM that evening, the new Director of Political Affairs arrived, and the Head of the Foreign Affairs Section and the Head of the Security Section also came. The Consul General, accompanied by Deputy Consuls Ji and Wei, went to welcome them. The Head of the Foreign Affairs Section then brought a staff member to the consulate to sincerely apologize and express condolences to the Chinese residents."</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 8th, the consulate personally visited the Director of Political Affairs, and after a brief greeting, strongly protested and presented three emergency measures. After leaving, the consulate further discussed the matter with the Head of the Foreign Affairs Section. That evening, the consulate sent Secretary Li, accompanied by Zheng Weifen, a representative of the Kuomintang branch, and Bi Hanxu, a representative of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, to Pyongyang to express condolences to the refugees and investigate the truth of the damages. On the morning of the 9th, the consulate personally visited the Head of the Foreign Affairs Section, requesting that the various provincial and prefectural governments issue notices to reassure the people, which he agreed to relay and implement. On the same day, the consulate also sent a letter to the Director of Political Affairs, presenting four items. From the 5th onwards, the consulate visited the consular corps from time to time, informing them of the damages."</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 11th, the Head of the Foreign Affairs Section came to the consulate for a visit, stating that the situation was gradually returning to normal and that he accepted the Consul General's hope to do his best to handle the matter. It was found that the areas under the jurisdiction of this consulate that suffered the most were Pyongyang, followed by Incheon, Seoul, and Chinnampo. The number of refugees housed reached more than 13,000. Many refugees in Incheon and Pyongyang hoped to return to China, and about 2,000 people had already boarded the Litong ship to Yantai. The number of people returning to China via Andong by train could not be determined. The damages suffered by the Chinese residents under the jurisdiction of the consulate are currently being investigated. The damages suffered by Chinese residents under the jurisdiction of this consulate are being reported directly by various consulates. This consulate is submitting a report to Your Ministry on the handling of negotiations and the housing of refugees up to the 11th of this month, along with various attachments, requesting your review and implementation, as well as instructions."</p>
<p>"Respectfully presented to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Weicheng, Consul General stationed in Korea, July 13th."</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Damage to Cotton by Storms: Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been sunny and mild for days, and the cotton crops have been growing vigorously. However, a slight breeze suddenly appeared on the night of the 24th, followed by rain the next morning. The wind increased, and the storm raged all day long. The cotton in the rural areas, which was just about to bloom, was suddenly hit by the wind and rain, causing significant damage. Farmers, in general, are quite panicked.</p>
<p>Robbery and Assault in Zhalin Township: On the night of the 23rd, at around 12:00 AM, at the home of Wang Degen, a resident of Zha-1 Tu, Zhalin Township, in the 15th district of the county, six robbers suddenly arrived, speaking in a mix of local dialects. Each of them carried long guns and pistols. They broke down the main gate and had three people watch outside, while the other three went inside to search and rob. The victim, Wang Degen, tried to escape, but the robbers fired a shot, hitting him in the abdomen. He fell to the ground, injured. The robbers then fled with their loot. Neighbors immediately hired a boat to take the injured victim to Minhang, where he took a car to Shanghai and sought treatment at the Baolong Hospital. It is feared that his life is in danger. The district head has reported the incident to the county government, the court, and the Public Security Bureau, requesting that they order their subordinates to conduct a strict search and arrest.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Education Funding Cut Case: The Education Department had previously requested a reduction in the county's education budget, based on a report from an inspector. The reduction amounted to more than 37,000 yuan, or three-tenths of the entire county's education budget. This had been appealed by primary and secondary school teachers and staff, but with no hope of resolution. They had unanimously resolved that if the goal of restoration was not achieved, they would postpone the start of school. Their attitude was exceptionally firm. The heads of the Civil Affairs and Education Departments jointly summoned County Magistrate Shen and Education Director Ni to the provincial capital to meet with the Education Director. Director Ni explained that the current expenditures would not affect the education budget and that there were still revenues. He requested that the current situation be temporarily maintained, and that they would strictly comply with the department's orders from next year onwards. After much pleading, a resolution was finally reached. County Magistrate Shen and Education Director Ni have now returned to Songjiang after completing their official business. The postponement of the start of school should no longer be an issue.</p>
<p>Wanted Bandit Arrested in Shanghai: Yang A'gen, a member of the gang led by Tai Bao A'shu, who was wanted by the four-county bandit suppression headquarters, was arrested in Zha Jia Du, Shanghai, by Ma Anfu, an intelligence officer from the pacification sub-district headquarters. He has been taken back to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Local Court Hearing of the Jiangyin Embezzlement of Opium Case: Huang Ying and others from Jiangyin reported that Yang Bingwei, the former head of the detective team, and others had taken a large amount of opium seized at Sanquan Lake and released the suspects after taking bribes. This case involved former County Magistrate Li Leng and former Public Security Bureau Chief Li Zonggang. After several interrogations by the Wuxian Local Court, the bribery portion of the case involving Li Leng and others was deemed not to warrant prosecution. The case of embezzlement of seized opium and bribery by Yang Bingwei, Wu Shanbao, and others was prosecuted separately, with Judge Yang Yiguo presiding over the interrogation. On the 25th, summons were issued to Wang Sengru and Qian Yaojiang, reporters from the Jiang Sheng and Cheng Qing newspapers, for questioning. Wang and others did not appear. At 12:00 PM, the Fifth Criminal Court convened, and Wu Shanbao and Lu Longbao, who were in custody, were brought in for questioning. (Qian Abao had been returned to the original county of Jiangyin for interrogation.) According to Lu Longbao's testimony, the boat was his own. On the fifth day of the twelfth lunar month of last year, Qian Abao hired his boat because a Jiang-surnamed crew member on his boat was returning home. He said he had a Changshu guest going to 噳, with a quilt and a net basket, but he did not know what was inside. Later, he saw in a Changzhou newspaper that it was transporting opium. He heard that there were seventy-two packages. He did not secretly load opium. At Sanquan Lake, he encountered a motorboat with three plainclothes men on the bow who ordered him to stop. The guest on the boat went ashore and fled. He went ashore to chase but failed to catch him. When he returned, his boat was towed away by the motorboat. Wu Shanbao testified that he only knew Yang Bingwei after he became the head of the detective team. He was introduced by Wu Shuying, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to be a team member. He received his appointment order on the 20th. Yang was suppressing bandits at Sanguandian, and he (Wu) delivered the opium to the main bureau in the city on his behalf. Wang Sengru of Jiang Sheng testified that it was not true that he went to the newspaper office with Yang to bribe him with thirty yuan. This was because Zhu Zhaokui, the manager of Jiang Sheng, had asked former County Magistrate Li to detain him. While in custody, he was repeatedly ordered to say that Li Leng had received bribes of opium, but he refused. Wang Xian falsely claimed that Cheng Qing newspaper was ordered by Yang Bingwei to send advertising fees. Yang entrusted Secretary Chen Xisheng to forward the money to him after he came to this office. There was no bribery. They are a party newspaper, so who would dare to bribe them? After about half an hour of questioning, they were ordered to be returned to custody, awaiting the arrival of Qian Yaojiang, Wang Sengru, and Meng Hongchang for questioning before adjourning the court.</p>
<p>Philanthropists to Visit Northern Jiangsu for Disaster Relief: Prominent Suzhou philanthropists Cao Songqiao, Yuan Xiaogu, Xu Houru, Liu Xin'san, and others have been appointed as committee members by the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association to visit various counties in northern Jiangsu to distribute emergency relief. Cao Songqiao and Xu Houru are scheduled to visit Yangzhong, Yuan Xiaogu to visit Jiangdu, and Liu Xin'san to visit Yixing and Liyang. They will depart separately within three days to inspect the distribution of relief funds.</p>
<p>Bandit Zhu Yubo Executed by Firing Squad: Notorious bandit Zhu Yubo (also known as Zhu Yuebo) was a member of the gang of notorious pirates Sang Haishan and Pan Kaiqu. In Qidong County, he resisted the anti-Japanese bandit suppression forces, killed Public Security Bureau Chief Zhu Zhingeng, and plundered weapons from government police. He had committed numerous crimes over the years. In the winter of 1929, he was arrested in Shanghai by the first district of the Water Public Security Bureau and sent to Suzhou. The Wuxian Local Court sentenced him to death, which was approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Yesterday (the 26th) at 8:00 AM, the prisoner Zhu Yubo was tied up and taken to the Wangshudun execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Qingyang Boat Robbed in Wuxi: Robberies have been occurring frequently lately, almost daily. The boat that set sail from Qingyangzhen to Wuxi the other day was robbed again. While passing through the Baitang圩 area, three bandits in a small boat carrying handguns and bayonets ordered the boat to stop and extensively looted it for about an hour. Afterwards, the bandits jumped back into their original boat and sped away. After inspection, the loss was more than three hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Dispute over Site of Xizhong Middle School: This year, the Xizhong Society initiated the establishment of Xizhong Middle School. They purchased two mu and two fen and five li of Gu Aying's ash fertilizer field under the Tongyang Bridge outside the South Gate and donated three mu of field from Zhou Zhaofu, the owner of the Dingchang Silk Factory, to build the school buildings. The school is expected to be completed and open soon. However, Hou Shaoxian and others, the owners of Gu Aying's ash fertilizer field, claim that Gu Aying did not obtain the owner's approval and sold the ash fertilizer field without permission, believing that it would hinder property rights and fearing that it would be difficult to negotiate in the long run. They hired a lawyer to sue Gu Aying in the county court for the crime of theft and sale, and ordered to restore the original state. Because of this dispute, the school's future is facing obstacles. They have also hired Sun Zuhong and Zhao Yucang to handle the legal negotiations.</p>
<p>Bandits Send Letters of Extortion: Gu Fushou, a villager residing at No. 23, Sheqiao Head, Tonghui Road, has been farming for a living and is an extremely kind person. Last autumn, he built a building and rented it to the Public Education Institute this spring, opening a Sheqiao Public Education Hall, which was coveted by bandits. The other day, Gu Fushou suddenly received a threatening letter from bandits, demanding a loan of 3,000 silver dollars, limited to five days for delivery at Huang Gongsi in Huishan. If not paid, they will take measures such as kidnapping and arson within a short period of time, etc. After receiving the letter, Fushou was terrified and reported to Peng, the chief of the Fifth Public Security Bureau, the responsible jurisdiction, yesterday. According to the report, Patrol Chief Wang Huizheng was immediately sent to conduct a detailed investigation with several plainclothes police officers. At the same time, Chief Peng reported to the Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>
<p>Major Theft at Shaotang Bridge: Chen Genbao, a merchant at Shaotang Bridge in the 17th district (Fuan Township), runs a Chen Hengtai silk and cloth goods store. The business is doing well, so he has some savings on hand. The other night, several thieves broke into the store through a hole in the wall and stole all the silk cloth and scattered items in the store. The next morning when they realized it, it was already too late to pursue them. The loss is estimated at more than 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Burning and Looting in Xiaxi Village: At around 9:00 PM the other night, more than 30 armed bandits suddenly arrived at Chen Laoer's house in Miaojiatang, near Xiaxi, Wuyi (belonging to Gui Xian Township, Danyang, at the intersection of the Wu, Dan, and Tan counties). They broke into the house and looted it, tied up and beat Chen Laoer. When Chen's grandson escaped and rang the gong, he was shot and killed. When the bandits left, they set the house on fire, burning to death four boys and countless grains of rice. As of today (the 25th), news is that the victim has reported the case to the Danyang County Government.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Smuggled Japanese Goods: The inspection team of the Wuyi Merchants' Committee for Interruption of Relations with Japan began inspection work on the 24th and seized 41 pieces of Ding Shunxing foreign goods at the station, including 8 pieces of Japanese cloth with printed patterns. They were immediately taken to the meeting for processing. On the 25th, a special executive committee meeting was convened to discuss the measures. It was resolved that non-Japanese goods would be returned, and Japanese goods would be confiscated and reported to the county party headquarters for verification. On the 26th, two pieces of Zhong Juchang Japanese cloth were seized at the station, and several pieces of goods without transportation and sales permits being transported out of the Zhicheng Sugar Store in the city were found at Xinhetan and detained for decision.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Great Wind Causes Disaster: A strong wind has suddenly arisen in this county since yesterday. It became even worse at night. Telephone and power lines in the city and countryside were all broken. A section of the east gate wall collapsed. Several thousand-year-old cypresses in the Confucius Temple were broken. It is even more difficult to count the number of trees broken in the four rural areas. The house of the County Education Association was crushed by a falling tree. Cotton and soybeans in the fields were lying on the ground, and there was no hope for the autumn harvest. Ships and ferries were all suspended. The force of the wind has not been seen for many years.</p>
<p>Replacement of Prison Warden: Zhao, the warden of this county, has been ordered by the High Court to be transferred to Nantong as the warden. The vacancy will be filled by Zhu Jingbiao, the warden of Baoshan County. Warden Zhao has already left Jiading to take up his new post in Tong, and Warden Zhu has not yet arrived in Jiading. The duties of the warden are temporarily assumed by Gao Baochen, the police captain.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Wind and Rain Return to Zhenjiang: The northeast wind picked up last night (the 25th) around 7:00 PM, and it suddenly rained. After 10:00 PM, the wind and rain were fierce and intense. After this rain, the polder fields along the river were devastated again. The farmers who had already broken the dikes saw the water deepen even more, and those who had not broken the dikes were terrified. As of this morning when the reporter submitted the manuscript, the wind and rain had not subsided slightly. It is unknown how much more of the precarious river embankment will collapse.</p>
<p>All Businesses in Suqian Suspend Operations: The Suqian County Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations telegraphed the provincial government and the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments yesterday, stating that County Magistrate Zhang Zuochen and Disaster Relief Association Officer Wang Weiji went to the association on the morning of the 23rd and proposed to borrow 3,000 silver dollars. The standing committee member Zhang Diqing politely discussed the difficulties on one hand and intended to convene a meeting to raise funds on the other hand. However, Magistrate Zhang was impatient and left in a huff. He then sent the police to arrest Zhang Diqing, but failed. He then arrested Assistant Ji Junsan and released him again, but continued to send teams to search for Zhang Diqing everywhere. The merchants throughout the county were extremely frightened and suspended operations altogether. After several unsuccessful attempts to dissuade them, they pleaded for legal protection and telegraphed the county government to stop the illegal arrest.</p>
<p>Critical Situation of Dikes in Northern Jiangsu: Although the weather has been hot recently, fortunately there have been no storms. Residents along the northern Jiangsu coast have been able to eke out a living. Unexpectedly, a strong northeast wind picked up again suddenly yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Coastal residents, with the wind and waves picking up speed, saw that the main bank was eroding and in a precarious state, with Liuxu being even more dangerous. So they rang the gong and gathered more than a thousand people to rush to the dikes to prevent danger. The cries were unbearable. The Jingkou Lifesaving Bureau, Yidu Bureau, and Jiaoshan Lifesaving Bureau, upon hearing the news, sent all their red boats to Liuxu to prevent dike breaches and rescue people. Various charitable organizations purchased and prepared food to distribute in front of them and rented gasoline lamps to set up along the levee, so that those rushing to prevent danger could observe the water situation in the dark. However, with the heavy wind and rain last night, it was even more difficult for the dikes to escape danger. Because of the vast expanse of water, disaster victims generally used small boats for transportation. However, such boats are prone to capsizing, so disaster victims have fallen into the water and drowned every day.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Tragic Situation of the Disasters in the Four Rural Areas: Within the territory of Jiangdu, there have been many days of continuous rain in the past two months. Mountain floods erupted first, followed by a surge of water in the Huai and Yi rivers, and the Jiang tidal wave topped. The entire county's territory suffered an unusually heavy disaster. Statistics show that about seven-tenths of the fields in the four rural areas were submerged. Such as the eighty-three states in the southeast rural areas, the Shaobo townships in the northeast rural areas, the Yangshou Dam, Fangjiaxiang, Longweitian, Dazhuzhuang and other places in the northwest rural areas, the Chibei Anhu, Gongdao Bridge, Yugaobridge, and Shui Ba townships in the north, the Xuejialou, Jiangwangmiao's Nangaozhuang, Pushu East, and Shirentou in the south, etc., the rice paddies and homes were submerged and washed away. The deaths of people and livestock are countless. It has become a great disaster only seen in nearly a hundred years. Now disaster victims are everywhere, and the various tragic situations are beyond the description of pen and ink. It is hoped that philanthropists will soon provide relief.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Losses from the Storms: The weather in Hangzhou has suddenly cooled down since the other day (the 25th). The southeast wind picked up at 9:00 AM, and the wind became more intense and the rain poured down in the afternoon. The major streets and shops in the new city market and Baoyufang closed early before 6:00 PM. There were few pedestrians on the roads. Countless trees along the lake and on the roads were destroyed by the wind. The storm stopped at 2:00 AM yesterday (the 26th). After investigation, a woman was crushed to death by a collapsing wall in a certain lane in the upper city cloth market. A corner of the Zhen Dong Lou was blown away. Collapsed walls and overturned walls were everywhere in the streets and alleys. Many rice paddies in the villages were destroyed by the wind. The Qianjiang noon and midnight tides both rose more than doubled. A sailing boat from Zhuji to Hangzhou capsized. Long-distance telephone lines from Hangzhou to Huzhou, Haining, and other places were all blown off. Telegraph and telephone communications between Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo have been cut off. The respective bureaus are now sending workers to try to repair and restore them. The city's lights also went out for tens of minutes.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Hurricane Causes Disaster: In Xiaoshan, there was a sudden hurricane on the night of the 24th, which did not stop until noon on the 26th. Telephone and electric lines in the city were completely broken. Countless houses and boards in the countryside were collapsed. The most regrettable thing is that thousands of acres of cotton in the eastern township were blown down and completely overturned, and the tide rushed in and flooded everything. The loss is not small. Moreover, the wood and timber drifting along the Wenyan Yiqiao on the river filled the river. The water was rapid and the wind was strong, so there was no way to salvage them. The loss is also more than several thousand gold. In addition, there were also dozens of ships sunk and boatmen drowned. Also, the early rice in Neiban was about to be harvested, but all of it was poured into the fields, and it was likely that there would be no harvest. The loss is not known. This is indeed a great disaster that has not been seen in decades.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Water Police Fight Pirates: Li Zhiqin, a famous pirate leader in Taizhou, has been robbing ships in the waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang for many years. The Overseas Water Police Bureau has repeatedly planned designs to suppress them, but has not yet had a suitable opportunity. The other day, the bureau received a secret report that the pirates were hiding on Jiang'er'ao Island on the north bank of Haimen. Wang Wenhun, the director of the bureau, secretly ordered the fourth team of the second water patrol team, the second team of the third water patrol team, the seventh team of the sixth water patrol team, and the Yongping warship to go to the pirates' lair to arrest them. When the pirates saw the police, they fled. The police pursued them and the pirates opened fire to resist arrest. Both sides opened fire. As a result, more than ten pirates were killed on the spot. It is reported that the pirate leader Li Zhiqin was also injured. A total of six water police officers were injured. Afterwards, the injured police officers boarded the Xinhualun ship to Ningbo and were carried to the county central hospital for treatment yesterday. The new director of the hospital, Chen Weitang, and others performed surgery on them, and there is no danger to their lives.</p>
<p>Letters Received</p>
<h3>Telegram from Pi County</h3>
<p>To the Editors of Shen Bao: The Zhenjiang correspondence in your newspaper has a section on Pi County expelling Ma Zhenbang, saying that it was a telegram sent by a lower-level party department to the province, etc. Our department and the three district divisions under its jurisdiction are unaware of this matter. It is obviously a fabrication by a good person, confusing the public. The seventh standing committee meeting decided to send a telegram to clarify. Please correct this. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Second District Party Department of Pi County.</p>

<p>Important News of Educational Developments</p>
<h3>Record of the 14th Annual Conference of the Chinese Agricultural Society</h3>
<p>First Day: Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The 14th Annual Conference of the Chinese Agricultural Society opened yesterday (the 20th) at the Faculty of Law. The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. Attendees included Vice Commander Zhang, representing Dr. Wu Dieqian; Li Shizeng; (Pan En's representative) Zhu Qinglan; (Shang Yunting's representative) Zhou Weilian, representing the Ministry of Industry; Mayor Zhou Dawen; Shen Yinmo, President of Peking University; Bai Pengfei, Dean of the Faculty of Law; representatives from other organizations; and over a hundred members from various provinces, including Zou Bingwen. Chairman Xu Xuan presided over the ceremony.</p>
<p>The Chairman delivered an opening speech, stating: "Today marks the 14th Annual Conference of our society. I have certain feelings. Our society was established in 1916 with only fifty-odd members. Now we have ten thousand one hundred and twelve members. While a large increase in numbers is not necessarily a sign of the society's prosperity, our members are outstanding individuals from the agricultural sector across various provinces. The majority have joined, which can be considered progress. The location of our society was unresolved for many years, but last year it was finally established in Nanjing. From now on, the foundation of our society will gradually be solidified. However, in recent years, we have been hampered by economic difficulties, and our planned projects have not been implemented. Therefore, we have not made significant contributions to the country and society. We, the members of the society, are very ashamed.</p>
<p>Looking at countries around the world, the latter half of the 19th century was a time of booming industry and commerce, and declining agriculture. The 20th century, however, is an era of agricultural revival. Since the end of the European War, countries have learned from the food shortage issue and recognized the need to respect agriculture. Recent agricultural policies and facilities in countries like England, Germany, France, the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Italy prove this. Although China is an agricultural country, in recent decades, due to various reasons, it has not only failed to progress but has also regressed. Fortunately, since the success of the revolution, the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters have strongly promoted agriculture, so society has gradually begun to pay attention to agriculture.</p>
<p>Considering the current national situation, agriculture is the fundamental industry of China, and improving agriculture is the basic work for the construction of the Three Principles of the People. However, agricultural development cannot be achieved overnight. We must first study agricultural science and then promote it so that agriculture gradually revitalizes. Our society is an academic organization for Chinese agriculture and should bear the important mission of improving agriculture and reforming rural areas. I hope that our colleagues will make extra efforts in agricultural research and rural construction to create a new agriculture for China and thereby implement the Principle of People's Livelihood."</p>
<p>Following this, Vice Commander Zhang, representing Dr. Wu, Zhou Weilian representing the Ministry of Industry, Mayor Zhou Dawen, Shen Yinmo the President of Peking University, Bai Pengfei the Dean of the Faculty of Law, Lan Mengjiu representing the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, and Wang Yaochen a professor at the College of Agriculture, successively gave speeches. At 12:00 PM, a photograph was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the meeting reconvened, presided over by Dong Shijin, a professor at the College of Agriculture. The chairman first reported on the significance of the meeting, followed by Yu Hongzheng, a professor at the College of Agriculture, who reported on the overall situation of the society over the past year. At 8:00 PM in the evening, the College of Agriculture of Peking University hosted a banquet for the members at Laijin Yuxuan in Zhongshan Park. Xu Xuan, the Dean of the College, gave a welcome speech, followed by Zou Bingwen who delivered a response on behalf of all the members. The evening concluded at 10:00 PM with everyone in high spirits.</p>
<h3>Second Day: General Membership Meeting</h3>

<p>The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. All members went to a tea party at the Peking University Library, hosted by Deputy Director Yuan Tongli and others. At 7:00 PM, Peking University's Faculties of Law, Liberal Arts, Science, Engineering, Medicine, Russian Language, Political Science, and Art jointly hosted a banquet for the society members at Laijin Yuxuan. During the banquet, the members discussed the agricultural situation in various regions. Additionally, the College of Agriculture of Peking University hosted a banquet for all members of the Chinese Agricultural Society at Laijin Yuxuan in Zhongshan Park on the evening of the 20th. After some drinking, Xu Shuji delivered a welcome speech, followed by a response from member representative Zou Bingwen, who expressed his gratitude to the colleagues from the College of Agriculture for their efforts in preparing for the annual conference and for their hospitality. Afterwards, Zhou Weilian representing the Ministry of Industry gave a speech, hoping that the members would guide the farmers. Dr. Wu Dieqian gave a speech hoping that the next annual conference would be held in Liaoning, with a tour of the northeastern forestry. The evening concluded at 9:30 PM with everyone in high spirits.</p>
<h3>Third Day: Discussion of Proposals</h3>
<p>| Academic Reports and Election of Officers</p>
<p>The meeting continued on the morning of the 22nd with Cui Tingzan as chairman. First, academic reports were given: (1) "Progress Report on Agronomic Chemistry" (Zhou Jianhou); (2) "Progress Report on Entomology" (Zou Zhonglin); and (3) "Progress Report on Forestry in Anhui Province" (Bian Xiaoting).

<p>The meeting reconvened at 2:00 PM. Chairman Xu Xuan first discussed the society's affairs and explained the income and expenditure report. Next, Guo Baolin's proposal to organize a land reclamation investigation team was discussed and approved. Liu He, Guo Baolin, and Cui Tingzan were designated to draft a concrete plan to be submitted to the Executive Committee for handling. Next, the proposal from the Agricultural Extension Office of the Anhui Construction Department was discussed: (1) It was recommended that the National Government order all provinces to allocate funds to establish farmers' banks; (2) It was recommended that the National Government order all provinces to establish improved agricultural implement manufacturing plants to research and manufacture new-style agricultural implements at low cost to promote the increase of agricultural work efficiency. Both proposals were revised and approved.</p>
<p>Next, the proposal for rural flood relief measures was discussed with great enthusiasm. It was decided to send a telegram to the National Government's Executive Yuan to express their opinions. The text of the telegram is as follows: "To the National Government Executive Yuan: At the 14th Annual Conference, it was unanimously resolved to request that the Executive Yuan pay special attention to rural floods and promptly raise funds to purchase seeds, agricultural implements, and livestock to distribute to disaster-stricken farmers so that agriculture can be restored as soon as possible, and to purchase relief grain from within the country as much as possible for relief purposes." Detailed plans for flood relief will be drafted by experts later.</p>
<p>Next, the proposal from members in Beiping to establish a Beiping branch was discussed and approved. Finally, a vote was held to elect members of the election committee. The elected members were Xu Xuan, Wang Shanquan, Dong Shijin, Chen Zaijun, Yu Hongzhi, Liu He, Cui Tingzan, Zhou Zhen, and Guo Cizhang (Guo and Liang Xi received the same number of votes, and Guo was elected by drawing lots). Finally, Xu Xuan delivered the closing remarks, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The members then attended a tea party hosted by the Municipal Government. Mayor Zhou expressed his welcome and discussed various agricultural issues. Xu Xuan delivered a response, briefly stating that Mayor Zhou had drafted a precise plan for the prosperity of Beiping City, and that Beiping City would develop more and more in the future. However, rural areas should be built simultaneously with cities to avoid drawbacks. The phenomenon of urban expansion and rural decline in various countries around the world recently can serve as a warning. Mayor Zhou is very interested in agriculture and encourages agricultural studies. He hopes that while vigorously building Beiping City, he will also pay attention to rural construction. At 7:00 PM, the members in Beiping hosted a banquet for the visiting members. During the banquet, they discussed the agricultural situation in various regions and were very congenial.</p>
<h3>Record of the 16th Annual Conference of the Chinese Science Society (4)</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) Yesterday (the 25th) was the fourth day of the 16th Annual Conference of the Chinese Science Society held in Zhenjiang. The night before (the 24th), the members went to a banquet hosted by the Chamber of Commerce and then boarded a boat back to the meeting place in Jiaoshan. On the way, a strong wind suddenly arose, followed by a torrential downpour. Everyone on board was soaked. The water around Jiaoshan was flowing rapidly and the waves were surging, making it impossible to proceed. They turned back to the Zhenjiang shore and stayed in a hotel. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, they boarded a boat again.</p>
<p>In the morning, the Society Affairs Meeting held its second meeting at 10:00 AM in the Zhenjiang Pavilion. More than thirty members attended, and Wang Jin (Jiliang) chaired the meeting.

<p>The editorial department is divided into four sections: social sciences, physical sciences, biological sciences (including agriculture and forestry), and engineering. Originally, there were twelve editorial staff members, all of whom were re-elected by the annual conference. This year, the election method was changed. Eight people were elected by the annual conference, and the remaining four were recommended by the Editor-in-Chief in the area and submitted to the Board of Directors for appointment.</p>
<p>The locations for the next annual conference were discussed by the general assembly. There were three options: (1) Wuchang; (2) Xi'an; and (3) Shenyang. The Board of Directors will decide. Also, since the provincial government and the Chamber of Commerce have warmly received the society members at this meeting in Zhenjiang, it was resolved yesterday to send a special letter of thanks in the name of the general assembly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, papers were read at the Zhenjiang Pavilion, with Cheng Zhi (Nongshan) as the chairman. The members took turns reading their papers as follows: Luo He, from the Zhenjiang-Shanghai Railway Engineering Office, titled "Analysis of the Minimum Work Principle of Secondary Stress in Bridges"; Wang Jinwu, from the Nantong Agricultural Experiment Station, titled "Newly Discovered Chicken Foot Upland Cotton in China"; Ding Xubao, from Northeastern University, titled "Westward Deflection of an Upward Projectile at a Fixed Height and at the Same Height of Upward and Downward Trajectory on a Rotating Earth" and also titled "Experience in the Treatment of Beef Tapeworm with Effective Herbal Remedies and Mostly Ineffective Western Medicines"; Tang Zhenlong, from Central China University in Wuchang, titled "Overall Planning of Municipal Engineering in Wuchang."</p>

<h3>Increased Book Prices Require Payment of Additional Examination Fees</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to the Education Bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating: "According to Article 4 of the Ministry's Regulations for the Examination of Educational Books, 'When submitting a book for examination, an examination fee equal to ten times the book's price should be paid together with a sample.' Also, 'If the price is increased after approval, an additional examination fee should be paid according to the previous regulations.' This has already been communicated and should be followed. However, it has been found that some books that have already been approved for publication are arbitrarily increasing their prices without paying the additional examination fees, which is inappropriate. In addition to issuing separate orders, all bookstores within the jurisdiction of the province are hereby ordered that, for all books that have been approved and subsequently increase their prices, an examination fee equal to ten times the increased price must first be paid to the Ministry to comply with the regulations."</p>
<h3>Financial Difficulties of National Central University</h3>
<p>The funding sources for National Central University have always been divided into two parts: Central Education Funds and Jiangsu Education Funds. The Central Education Funds, amounting to 50,000 yuan per month, must be collected from the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office. However, the disbursement is often delayed, causing many difficulties in meeting expenses. In recent years, the scale of various colleges has gradually expanded, and all expenses have increased accordingly, leading to concerns about income not covering expenditures. It has recently been reported that the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office intends to reduce the Jiangsu Education Funds allocated to National Central University by one-third, and if this comes to pass, the future of the university will be unimaginable. In addition, this year's floods have caused disasters, and tax collection in various counties will inevitably be insufficient, which will greatly affect the education funds of National Central University. On the 25th, the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office held a meeting in Zhenjiang, and it is said that President Zhu personally attended to vigorously advocate for the university's funding issues.</p>
<h3>Private Colleges Approved for Establishment by the Ministry of Education in August</h3>
<p>The private colleges whose Board of Directors were approved for establishment by the Ministry of Education in August include: Shanghai Private Southeast Medical College, Hunan Private Qunzhi Law College, Shanxi Private Bingzhou College, and Beiping Private Ping College.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Principals Can Concurrently Serve as Deputy Township/Township Heads</h3>
<p>| Provided that Work Hours Do Not Hinder School Affairs</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether elementary school principals can concurrently serve as deputy township/township heads, the Ministry of Education, in addition to replying to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, also replied to the Ministry of Interior, stating: "With reference to the Ministry's inquiry, approving the Jiangsu Provincial Government's inquiry, based on the Education Department's request for interpretation on whether elementary school principals can concurrently serve as deputy township/township heads, a request for investigation and reply is hereby submitted to facilitate further consultation, etc., is approved. Upon review of the case, the Ministry recently approved the Jiangsu Provincial Government's request for interpretation, stating that the duties performed by deputy township/township heads fall within the scope of autonomy, which is different from general official duties. Elementary school principals may serve concurrently. Furthermore, there is a lack of talent in rural areas, and for the sake of selecting capable deputy township/township heads, it seems appropriate to approve elementary school principals to serve concurrently, provided that their working hours do not hinder school affairs. Since the provincial government has separately consulted the Ministry of Interior for interpretation, it is still requested to wait for the Ministry of Interior's review and reply before making a final decision. The Ministry of Education's interpretation is consistent with that of the Ministry of Interior, and we strongly agree with it. With reference to the previous inquiry, a corresponding reply is hereby made in the hope that it will be reviewed and followed."</p>

<p>All elementary schools in this city will be closed today, August 27th (i.e., today), in accordance with the regulations for Confucius' birthday. At the same time, each school will hold a memorial ceremony at 9:00 AM to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Elementary School Principals in County</h3>
<p>Zhu Shixiong, the principal of Qianxi Elementary School in the First District of Shanghai County, resigned last semester, and the Education Bureau approved the transfer of Zhang Runtian, the principal of Zizeng Elementary School, to fill the vacancy. Principal Zhang has served at Zizeng Elementary School for two years and has achieved excellent results, which have been praised by local residents. Now, he has been transferred to Hexi Elementary School, where he will surely eliminate long-standing habits and bring a new look. Cao Jinhuan, the principal of Lidong Elementary School, is scheduled to be transferred to Zizeng Elementary School. The vacancy is currently being sought by the Education Bureau. In addition, Wang Baijun will serve as the principal of D渡橋私立增新 Elementary School starting this semester.</p>
<h3>Schools in the First District of the County Have All Started</h3>
<p>The Central Elementary School and all junior elementary schools in the First District of the County have been on summer vacation for seven weeks since July 1st. In order to prevent students from neglecting their studies, the Central Elementary School has opened a supplementary class for twenty days, with one or two class hours per day. The results have been quite good. Now, all schools have officially started classes in the past few days.</p>
<h3>Relocation of the Municipal Science Laboratory</h3>
<p>The Municipal Science Laboratory of this city is run by the Municipal Education Bureau and is dedicated to providing Shanghai municipal or private registered middle and elementary schools with physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, mineralogical experiments, and the loan of instruments, specimens, and reagents for use as teaching aids. Since Fan Fengyuan took over this year, he has made every effort to expand equipment, purchase instruments, make wall charts, and divide the laboratory into six major sections: Animal Specimen Section, Plant Specimen Section, Mineral Specimen Section, Human Health Model Section, Physics Equipment Section, and Chemistry Experiment Section. Catalogs have been compiled and distributed to various schools so that the natural science teaching in various schools this year will have sufficient experimental assistance. However, because the original address was in Zhabei Zhiyuan, transportation was inconvenient and progress was difficult. A request was submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau and approved, so the entire laboratory was moved yesterday (the 24th) to the original site of Changshi Middle School at the intersection of Diswei Road and Tiantong Road, together with the Municipal Qimei Elementary School.</p>

<h3>Doubt About Germany's Participation in the World Games</h3>
<p>Suffering Economic Blows</p>
<p>Whether Germany will participate in the 10th World Games next year is now in question due to a severe economic blow. Funds donated by various parties for the German team's expenses at the Games were all deposited in the Rottler Bank, which suddenly declared liquidation. The portion obtained by each creditor is very small. Given the current period of national economic panic, the anticipated donations in the future are unlikely to be substantial. It is difficult to determine whether Germany will be able to participate.</p>
<h3>End of the Nanyang Summer School Basketball Games</h3>
<p>Won Lida by One Point / Won Industrial and Commercial School by Two Points</p>
<p>The other day, the Commercial Press held its 35th-anniversary celebration and specially invited the Nanyang Senior Commercial Middle School summer school basketball team to play an exhibition match with the Industrial and Commercial team at the Commercial Press's basketball court to entertain the guests. The match started at 7 p.m. that afternoon with bright lights, as if it were daytime, and was watched by about a thousand people. The two teams were evenly matched. The result was 23 to 21, with Nanyang winning by two points. It was also heard that the Lida basketball team had previously come to the Nanyang Commercial School's court to compete with the Nanyang team, and the result was 23 to 22, with Nanyang winning by only one point. Now that the Nanyang summer school is coming to an end and the exams are about to be held, the basketball games will also be temporarily suspended from now on, it is said.</p>

<h3>A Thought</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Women's attire in summer is bound to be more tempting than in other seasons.</p>
<p>Ardent spirit is mostly cultivated from hardship.</p>
<p>Dirty water breeds mosquitoes; fragrant flowers attract butterflies.</p>
<p>Serve to fulfill one's duty; read ancient books in one's leisure.</p>
<p>Talking in one's sleep is for fools; speaking the truth makes one a gentleman.</p>
<p>Fragrance is valued for its subtlety; color is valued for its elegance.</p>
<p>If you want to find high talents for the court, do not overlook those from humble backgrounds.</p>
<p>A miser's purse is often emptied by the charm of women.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "The wise find pleasure in water." Water flows downwards. No wonder those who fall are mostly intelligent people.</p>
<p>If your talent and skills are not as good as others, you should compete with yourself, not with others. Competing with others only leads to jealousy; competing with yourself may lead to achievement.</p>
<p>Film critics should not say that Chaplin's plays can bring tears in laughter. In fact, such performances can be seen when a policeman brutally beats a rickshaw puller. It is not surprising at all.</p>
<p>A benevolent person often lives in a humble dwelling, not in a wealthy family.</p>
<p>Confidence is essential and should be strong, but too little confidence is not advisable.</p>
<p>Mr. Time's swiftness can break the world record for race walking.</p>
<p>An ambitious person often cannot bear to tear off the pages of their calendar.</p>
<p>The sharpest weapon for stimulating romantic feelings is the novel.</p>
<h3>Remembering General Tong Wu</h3>
<p>— Zhurong Shi</p>
<p>General Pu Xiyuan, whose given name was Tong, was the fifth child in his family. Therefore, he was generally known as General Tong Wu. His courtesy name was Hongdou Guanzhu, and he was a Banner Man. He was also known as Prince Zhi. Throughout his life, he loved opera the most. He was uniquely gifted, with a voice that was clear, bright, and rich. He was also exceptionally skilled in martial arts, excelling in both civil and military matters. He was proficient in all roles—male, female, painted-face, and clown. He was a true theatrical genius. Among the opera enthusiasts in Beiping, none did not consider Tong Wu the leader. Even Yan Jupeng, a disciple of the Tan School (who had not yet become a professional performer and was also an amateur), and Mr. Wang Junzhi admitted their inferiority. The Qing imperial family had many who loved Peking Opera, such as Prince Tao, who was skilled at playing the Monkey King and was invited to perform for Yu Jusheng, earning him praise. However, compared to General Tong Wu, he paled in comparison. Chen Yanheng, a respected figure in the qin world, had mastered the secrets of Tan Yingxiu's opera. He rarely praised either insiders or outsiders. Even Yu Yan, who was gradually becoming the leading performer of male roles with beards, was still criticized by Chen. However, Chen always respected Tong Wu and praised him even more than Yingxiu. It goes without saying that his artistry was advanced and extensive. In middle age, Yingxiu still performed martial roles. After switching to male roles with beards, he often sought advice from Tong. Based on Yingxiu's skills, Tong pointed out the essence of the old masters (Cheng Changgeng), Yu Sansheng, Zhang Erkui, and Wang Datou in terms of rhythm, tone, and diction. Yingxiu was able to combine the strengths of various schools and become a master of his generation. Therefore, it can be said that Yingxiu's artistry was derived from Tong. Since childhood, the general loved singing and only found pleasure in watching operas. He had personally witnessed all the famous figures in the opera world, such as Cheng Changgeng, Yu Sansheng, and Zhang Erkui for male roles; Jin Xiushan and He Guishan for painted-face roles; Shi Xiaofu, Yang Duoyun, and Yu Ziyun for female roles; Yu Runxian (Jusheng) and Huang Pang (Yueshan) and Yang Yuelou for martial male roles; Xu Xiaoxiang and Wang Lengxian for young male roles; Huang Sanmu and Ma Zi for copper hammer roles; and Zhang Hei for martial clown roles; and Liu Gansan for clown roles. Moreover, he was able to acquire their strengths. Therefore, the general was proficient in both civil and military roles and was a versatile performer of Kunqu and miscellaneous operas. Compared to Yingxiu, he was even better. People at the time said that Tan Yingxiu was the expert among professionals, and General Tong was the expert among amateurs, making them a perfect pair. This was by no means an exaggeration. Whenever there were amateur opera performances in Beiping's theaters, the streets would be empty when the general took the stage, and people would rush to get a seat. Even Tan Yingxiu could not surpass him. When Tan heard that Tong was performing, he would avoid it and stop performing, fearing that two heroes could not stand together and that his reputation would be damaged. This was how admired he was by both insiders and outsiders. Moreover, when Tong took the stage, he did not only perform male roles with beards. Whenever the mood struck him, he would perform male, female, painted-face, and clown roles, as well as civil and military roles, and Kunqu and miscellaneous operas, demonstrating his exquisite artistry. Yan Jupeng was able to gain a good reputation and was highly regarded when he came to Shanghai last time, largely due to the general's efforts, as Yan was the general's disciple. The other day, when the general came to Shanghai, the famous amateur opera singers by the sea were eager to meet him and admire his elegant demeanor. He was amiable and approachable, unlike other members of the deposed Qing imperial family who had bad habits. His lively conversations were delightful. Mr. Ye Yongfang hosted a banquet for him at the Daya Restaurant, where he sang on the spot, producing the sound of metal and stone. His rhythm was deep and long, and his diction was accurate, truly extraordinary.</p>
<h3>A Wife's Reproach</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Life is inevitably filled with disappointments, but the reproaches between husband and wife in the family bring immeasurable pain. According to the research of British Doctor Walter Fairfield, such reproaches from a wife can greatly affect her husband's health and, imperceptibly, shorten his life. At the same time, regarding women, there is much criticism and misunderstanding, which also leads to a loss of mental harmony and easily results in a pale complexion. It is truly a case of both sides being harmed.</p>
<p>The doctor believes that one's thoughts are an important element in creating a strong physique. Therefore, a peaceful mind, combined with proper diet and rest, can gradually improve physical strength. If a husband and wife disagree, both parties' thoughts are deeply affected, and the various parts of the body are also greatly impacted. Especially during mealtimes, the atmosphere must be pleasant and cheerful so that the food can be easily digested. Otherwise, the secretion of cells in the body will be disrupted due to negative emotions, leading to illness. This is what the doctor says. Husbands and wives who often engage in unnecessary arguments should reflect on this and perhaps know how to change.</p>
<h3>My Views on Saving Food to Help Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Currently, there are fifty to sixty million disaster victims, accounting for more than one-tenth of the entire population. Unless nine people help one person, there is almost no way for them to survive. However, among the nine people, the elderly, the weak, women, and children must account for more than half. In a family of eight, only one person is relied upon. It can be asserted that they have no surplus capacity to bear the burden. Even if the government raises a public debt of ten million yuan, it will only provide each of the fifty to sixty million people with less than two jiao in silver. This is not enough to ensure survival and only seeks to provide one meal. It is truly difficult to devise a long-term solution. Shanghai has a population of nearly three million. If we apply the one-tenth ratio, we should expect an increase of three hundred thousand people. Food is of utmost importance to the people, but if we only consider rice, the daily requirement will increase by five to six thousand shi (a unit of dry volume), and the annual requirement will be thirty million yuan. Where will this come from? However, after deep consideration, I believe that the Chinese people still largely retain the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, morality, and ethics that have been passed down for thousands of years. As long as it does not harm themselves and benefits others, they are willing to do it. For example, a person who used to need three large bowls of food can, out of concern for those who are crying out for food, change three large bowls to three shallow bowls. The amount saved is precisely one-tenth. By using the surplus to make up for the deficiency, there will be no fear of a rice shortage. Some may say that eating heartily is good, and since ancient times, people have only been encouraged to add more food. Why should we save food? However, eating heartily and adding more food is meant for guests who are unaccustomed to the local climate and have a poor appetite. The key to Dongpo's (Su Shi's) health regimen is only eight words: "Eat when hungry, stop before full." This is the same as the teaching to not seek to eat one's fill. It is not harmful to physiology and is suitable for hygiene. However, the money saved is still in the pocket, and the rice saved is still in the market. The rice in the market is not sold without money. How can the disaster victims obtain food? Therefore, those who save food should make a great vow to use the food saved to help the disaster victims. Only then can the benefit of sharing food be seen in practice. For example, a family of eight that uses four sheng (a unit of dry volume) of rice per meal should limit themselves when cooking and reduce it by four he (a unit of dry volume). They should also inform their family members of the principle of not seeking to eat one's fill and correct the misconception of forcing food. Then, whether young or old, they will surely be moved and listen. Getting nine-tenths full will not lead to starvation. If the four he saved are stored in a warehouse system, those who store one shi per month will have a surplus of one dou (a unit of dry volume). It is appropriate and feasible to donate one dou when receiving the stored rice next month to help disaster relief. The people will surely have unwavering trust in the charitable undertakings of the government. It should not require coercion to be done willingly. Therefore, even if the population of Shanghai increases by three hundred thousand, there will be no risk of people resorting to desperate measures. This can be asserted. Human nature is inherently good, like water flowing downwards. Confucianists speak of benevolence, and Buddhists speak of compassion, all of which aim to manifest one's inherent virtue and prevent the original goodness from being obscured by material desires, just like wiping a mirror to make it clear and removing the dirt of old stains. If there is a method for this, the effect will be immediate. Therefore, the responsibility for guiding and persuading lies with the enlightened. Suppose schools, armies, industrial and commercial factories, groups, and families compete to advocate saving food to help disaster relief. Regardless of whether it can be universally implemented, as long as one tells ten and all voices promote it, then naturally, through influence, people will reduce their consumption of food for the next meal when they have a surplus of food for one meal. When water flows, a channel is formed. The food problem will have been resolved. Furthermore, teach them to engage in production and not allow the disaster victims to become people who sit idle and eat. Then the way to bring peace will be near.

<h3>Random Talk at Taibai Tower</h3>
<p>— He Chuyue</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zhang Yan's "Record of a Visit to Taibai Shrine" mistakenly stated that the shrine was located at the foot of Cuiluo Mountain in Caishi. It was actually the tower that was mistaken for the shrine. The shrine is located on Xiejiashan Mountain. It also mistakenly stated that there was a tomb with clothing and headgear at the foot of Cuiluo Mountain. Actually, the tomb is located in Caixiang, which is separated from Cuiluo Mountain by only a narrow strip of water.</p>
<p>The tower was actually built by Peng Xueqin. There was a tower rebuilt during the Chenghua period of the Ming Dynasty, which was earlier than the Yang Yi campaign. It is said that the landscape paintings by Xiao Chimu, a famous painter from the early Qing Dynasty, which were on the four walls of the tower, were also destroyed at the same time, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Today, on the stone wall below the tower, there are still four plum blossom paintings by Peng Xueqin. The sparse branches and inclined trunks are antique and vivid. Each is inscribed with a quatrain. The beautiful lines, such as "The predestined relationship on the San Sheng Stone remains. It is intertwined with plum blossoms for downstream cultivation", are unrestrained and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Inside the tower, there used to be five-colored incense burners, which were colorful and lovely. They were rare objects that were thousands of years old. They were produced in this mountain and were crafted by skilled artisans. There was one large and one small. The large one has already been forcefully taken away by Ma Jia's troops. The small one is still in the possession of Zhen Shen Lu Shuyi's family. One can visit and ask to see it.</p>
<p>Leaning on the tower window, one can look down at the Yangtze River. The Tianmen Gorge rushes eastward, and the smoke and ferries are vast. Sometimes, one can see the distant silhouette of a solitary sail disappearing into the blue sky. The green mountains send forth their beauty, and the white silk extends its coolness, filling one's face. One often thinks of the ancients who loved to travel to famous mountains throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Behind the tower is a secluded place to live. Slender bamboos form a forest, and green shade covers the ground. There is a winding path that leads to Taoyuan. Every year in the third month of late spring, the scattered flowers form a brocade, and groups of orioles fly around. Wandering there, one no longer knows there is a mortal world. It is extremely wonderful and surpasses all others.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's Lake Tower Poetry Talk (Part 2), "A sound of Xiao beneath the small red curtain" should be "water" instead of "small". Also, "A rule for sitting from servants on the side of a ship" should be "Leaning" instead of "From Servants". Also, "Selected Double Circles" should be changed from "Double Circle" to "Same".</p>
<h3>Random Notes from a Trip to the Northeast (3)</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui Jiu</p>
<p>The square bricks paved around the main hall were all made of gold ore, also known as Fengjin Stone. It is commonly said that the emperor used gold bricks to pave the ground. This gold ore was taken with this meaning. Under the steps of the main hall, two stone dragons were carved, commonly known as Dragon Roads. During the Qing Dynasty, no one was allowed to walk on this road. The book called the emperor "Your Majesty", referring to this place. Behind the main hall is a tunnel. Behind the tunnel is a screen wall. It is said that the flowers made of tiles on this wall all have secret codes. Moving a certain tile can open the 瓰 and enter the Baoding (the burial place). Before the Baoding is the Great Ming Tower. In the middle is a stele with inscriptions in three languages: Chinese, Manchu, and Mongolian. The inscription reads, "The Mausoleum of Emperor Taizong Wen." This stele is made of white marble and is about two zhang (a unit of length) tall. In front of Long'en Gate is a stele called "Stele of Divine Merit and Holy Virtue." In addition, there are stone elephants, stone camels, and stone horses. There are two stone horses, one named Daqing and the other named Erqing. It is said that when Qing Taizong was arrested by Li Chengliang, the general of the Ming Dynasty, in Liaoyang, he escaped with the help of this horse. Therefore, it is rumored that the Qing Dynasty's name, Daqing, may have originated from this. Zhaoling is one of the two great imperial mausoleums of Shenyang. The other mausoleum is called Fuling.</p>
<p>(IV) Qing Taizu Benefited from Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin</p>
<p>The architectural style of Fuling is similar to that of Beiling but slightly inferior. It is the mausoleum of Nurhaci, the first emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Taizu Gao Emperor. In the early 17th century, Nurhaci annexed the small Manchu tribes and established the capital in Shenyang (Fengtian). In 1644, he overthrew the Ming Dynasty and invaded the Central Plains.</p>
<p>Nurhaci's surname was Aisin Gioro, which means "Golden Clan" in Manchu, meaning the descendants of the Jurchen. In his childhood, he was often self-reliant due to his stepmother's lack of kindness. He would gather ginseng and pine nuts to sell in Fushun City. In the late Wanli period, many merchants from Jiangnan traveled to Fushun. Nurhaci learned about the situation of the Han people and loved to read Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin. He imitated Song Jiang and Liu Xuande in his character. His life's achievements were largely due to these two books.</p>
<p>The two great heroes of the founding of the Manchu Dynasty (Taizu and Taizong) benefited from the cultivation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin, and the other benefited from the planning of Hong Chengchou, a minister of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, the Ming Dynasty was not taken by the Manchus, but lost by the Han people themselves.</p>
<p>The Manchu people rose from Changbai Mountain and established their capital in Shenyang. The ancestral mausoleums of their ancestors were all located in the suburbs of Shenyang. Therefore, after moving the capital to Beiping, the emperors of successive dynasties repeatedly made inspection tours to Fengtian to pay homage to the ancestral mausoleums to show that they did not forget their ancestors, who pacified the white mountains and black waters with a three-foot sword and opened up a three-hundred-year imperial career. It is said that the system of the Qing Dynasty's eastern inspection tours to the mausoleums began with Emperor Kangxi. Later, it became a fixed custom. Until Yongzheng, Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Daoguang, they all followed the ancestral system. For about one hundred and sixty years, the imperial carriages toured the Northeast eleven times.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of India (92)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>According to this explanation, the worship of reproductive organs is not filthy, nor is it an insult or a mockery. It is sacred, dignified, noble, and pure, even to the point of the Taiji and Wuji, which are contrary to the innate Dao. It is very consistent with our Daoism. I believe that Daoism also came from the Western Heavens and is a branch of Brahmanism. The name Brahmanism means purity and is also Hinduism. India is not called India. It was originally called Brahmanism, and the Muslims gave it the name Hinduism. The content of Brahmanism is profound and far-reaching. The so-called four Vedas classics and Yoga are all interconnected. Buddhism also evolved from this, which we cannot understand. This is commonly seen in the writings of Europeans. For example, the teachings of Dharma characteristics after the extinction of Buddhism all arise in response to the times. It is a transformed Indian philosophy that communicates with and completes Buddhism. In short, all of India is a mysterious ethnic culture that no one can accurately understand, like a repeating decimal that cannot be fully exhausted. Alas, with four or five thousand years of history and thirty-two thousand ethnic groups (excluding the seventy million Muslims), no top philosopher in the world dares to protest or lecture the Indians on religion and philosophy, yet their worship originates from the Yin and Yang reproductive organs. Isn't that strange?</p>
<p>After noon, I went to the Ganges River. In winter, most of the river is dry, and the water is not very clear. However, it is still possible to bathe. I saw a wooden frame with a bell hanging by the water. Someone was ringing the bell. When the bell rang, men and women all entered the river to bathe. The method is to place a wooden bed in the shallow water of the river. Anyone who comes can bathe on the wooden bed. They can take off and put on clothes. There are hundreds of wooden beds along the river, which are rented by those who are baptized. Entering the bath is equivalent to being baptized. After bathing, the monks paint five colors on the foreheads to distinguish them. The strange shapes are difficult to describe. Many doctors and lawyers come here to receive paintings. However, the rules for women to paint their foreheads are different. Men's forehead paintings are strange and varied, like the actresses in our operas, while women's are not. Forehead paintings are light and simple, belonging to the clean and delicate style, with a hint of sacredness. The ugliness of the male style can represent masculinity, and the delicateness can represent femininity, just as the killing nature can represent masculinity, and the compassionate nature can represent femininity and motherhood. Even with the same ceremony of forehead painting and baptism, the nature is as different as heaven and earth. However, scholars generally do not mention this.</p>

<h3>Financial Standard Gold Slightly Weakened</h3>
<p>Fell Another Two Taels. Yesterday, the 26th, the standard gold slightly declined. Although the waves were calm, the changes were still significant. A total of seven taels of returned money were reviewed. As a result, it fell more than two taels again. People were uneasy and there were few transactions. Indeed, there were quite a few people who had not yet arrived. The silver market declined and opened lower. Soon after, it was rumored that a certain bank was purchasing, and the foreign exchange rate was reduced by half a grade. Therefore, it tended higher. Later, large households competed to sell, and it fell downwards. However, there were slight fluctuations in between. The market was mild. Because it was Wednesday, there was no foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in the Morning Market. The October opening fell two taels to 774 taels and eight qian. The large bars only fell by one-sixteenth to one-eighth. The silver price fell by one-quarter. Private telegraphs only shrank by one-eighth. US stocks fluctuated little. Soon after, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Da Xing Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Qian Chang Xiang and others all bought in. It was rumored that a certain bank was starting to purchase, so it added more than one tael. When the British gold was revealed, the listing price was seventy-six taels, and the listing price was reduced by one-two-five, the US dollar by two-five, and the Japanese gold added one and a half fen, and the price continued to rise by three taels, reaching seventy-nine taels and one qian. The transaction of each exchange was smooth, only the bank traded against the October US dollar at twenty-nine yuan eight seven five, and the September British gold at one three seven five. Soon after, Da Feng Yong, Da Xing Yong, Bing Xing and the Dalian Gang all had sales, so they leaked out more than four taels. At about half past ten, it was seventy-four taels and six qian. In an instant, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Da Yong, Da De Cheng, and others all entered, immediately adding more than two taels. At ten forty-five, it was seventy-seven taels, but the selling wind did not stop, and Fu Yu Hong Li Nei Xing sold it again, and it went down a little more than three taels. However, there was an advance and retreat of one or two taels in between. At eleven thirty, it was seventy-three taels and six qian. At that time, it was added more than one tael, to five taels two three qian, but the items and Qian Chang Xiang bought in, and they used the standard gold to eat the November British gold at eight one two five. In the future, Yi Feng Yong Hong Li and others sold it. The British gold can be settled at seven five to eight one two five. The good news is that the Indian exchange rate has increased by four annas. At noon, it was seventy-two taels and eight qian. Then, it closed at three taels and one qian. The revealed price was changed to eight hundred and eleven taels and eight qian, which was thirty-six taels to thirty-three taels, and noon closed at thirty-nine taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Clear. The market opened at seventy-three taels in the afternoon. Due to the Indian exchange rate increasing by two annas, Yuan Mao Yong and others bought in. It was increased from two and a half taels to four taels. The transaction was only a few qian up and down, and there were no large tickets. Until after three o'clock, it was rumored that a certain country's cabinet had died, so the market shook and fell more than two taels. At three thirty, it was seventy-one taels and a half. After this, the buying atmosphere seemed strong, and Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Yong Heng, and Yong Feng competed to purchase, planning to raise three taels upstream.

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, although the demand for silver dollars has not been exceptionally high, the trend has been positive, so the exchange rate has mostly fluctuated upwards. As for the business of the financial sector, given the frequent flooding and stagnation of commerce and goods, it seems difficult to achieve prosperity. However, Shanghai is a large metropolis connecting China and the West. Obstructions in one area are compensated in another, so most goods still have import and export activity. However, the continuous hurricanes and the ban on merchant ships leaving the port have caused a slight pause.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates (Silver Exchange): The morning exchange rate weakened due to weak buying interest, falling slightly by 0.025 yuan from the previous afternoon to 0.7255 yuan. The afternoon market suddenly rebounded to 0.725875 yuan, resulting in a 0.005 yuan increase compared to the previous morning. (Silver Discount) The morning rate was 0.17 yuan, and the afternoon rate was 0.19 yuan, also up 0.02-0.03 yuan from the previous day. In general, the situation showed a step-by-step rise, so speculation reached as high as 0.20 yuan, while bank quotations were at 0.07 yuan.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver coins were at 0.65425 yuan in the morning and 0.6545 yuan in the afternoon, a slight increase of 0.005 yuan from the previous day.

The morning trading volume was 160,000 jiao, and the afternoon volume was 45,000 jiao. Copper coins further decreased by 2,000 to 372,500 wen. Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): Banks have seen less vigorous collection and remittance business recently due to the sluggishness of commerce and goods. Chinese merchants' collection and remittance of draft funds amounted to over 1.9 million yuan, foreign merchants' collection and remittance of draft funds totaled 1.67 million yuan, and various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds collected and remitted totaled 7.89 million yuan, with 1.1 million yuan going into storage. Japanese banks collected and remitted various funds amounting to over 3.4 million yuan, with 400,000 yuan going into storage.

<h3>Securities Market in the Midst of Settlement</h3>
<p>The Stock Exchange is Closed Today and Tomorrow for Settlement: Today, the stock exchange will be closed for pre-settlement calculations for the August futures delivery of various bonds, and tomorrow it will be closed for settlement. It is said that the settlement volume greatly exceeds that of the previous month. Yesterday, the August futures were already closed, and the October futures had not yet opened, so only the September futures were traded. Due to the quiet and stable bond market environment, all parties were focused on preparing for settlement, so the market was relatively calm. Market sentiment was scattered, and trading volume was low. There were no transactions for Customs Consolidated 6, and there was only slight activity in Disbandment in the afternoon. Other activity was also scarce. The prices of various bonds were also stagnant, fluctuating by only a few jiao throughout the day, slightly less than the 0.02-0.03 yuan of the previous day. Only the spot prices of Demobilization 20 and Customs rose slightly. The total spot transaction volume for the day was only 3,000 yuan, and the futures volume was approximately 14.4 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Market Greatly Depressed</h3>
<p>More Deliveries This Month</p>
<p>The yarn market is softening because real demand is gradually clearing and the floods in various areas are becoming more serious, leading to despair regarding future sales. Too many deliveries are occurring this month, and receivers are scarce, and they are mostly 10-count coarse yarns, so people are very worried.</p>
<p>People's Standard Down Two Taels Weak: At the exchange, People's Standard opened with a slight drop in American cotton, and the market sentiment for this month was poor, dropping one tael. Distant months were also affected, dropping 1.45 taels. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were also weak, and market sentiment remained weak. Each month dropped 0.03-0.06 yuan. The traded volume was 30,000 bales. It was found that Guangfeng sold 750 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, Tongyu 750 bales, Zhenda 500 bales, Yuande 450 bales, and Shenji 500 bales. He Shen bought 600 bales, Shenchang 450 bales, Yongchang 550 bales, and Houfengchang 900 bales. The People's Standard closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Price Change in Balance People's Standard Closing Price Change in Balance</p>

<p>October 151.8 169240 January 152.1 1871050</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Transactions Not Active: Spot yarn sales are relatively flat. It was found that the total purchase of various gangs throughout the day was 1,250 bales, and 150 bales were taken in by colleagues. The market was slightly down. Customer gangs brought in 1,125 bales from Sichuan, 60 bales from Tianjin, 50 bales from Yunnan, 70 bales from Shantou, and 20 bales from the mainland.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Plunges Again</h3>
<p>The cotton market is greatly depressed. The weather has cleared, and the strong winds and torrential rains have ended. The trend of American cotton is still weak and sluggish. In this era of oversupply, there will be no major rebounds. Gold prices are also flat, and scattered selling has created a state of panic. However, many in this port are increasing their positions due to the severe floods in various areas. Foreign cotton has too much inventory and is urgently seeking a way out, so prices are still willing to make special concessions. Therefore, judging from the global situation, the future is unlikely to be bright.</p>
<p>Distant Months New Cotton Down Half a Tael: At the exchange, Han Standard opened with another drop in American cotton and poor performance in Indian cotton. Market sentiment was weak again, and the weather turned good again, so selling started again, dropping 0.03-0.04 yuan in each month. The afternoon market remained weak, but this month, being the last day, rose by 0.045 yuan alone. Distant month futures dropped 0.005 to 0.015 yuan. The traded volume was 122,100 dan. It was found that Yichang sold 12,100 dan, Dachang 2,500 dan, Tongxing 2,100 dan, Taixing 4,900 dan, Gongtai 2,700 dan, and Yuanda 1,200 dan. Feng bought 5,100 dan, Daji 2,100 dan, Yuande 5,200 dan, Changhe 3,100 dan, and Shenda 2,000 dan. The Han Standard closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>October 337045 157300</p>
<p>January 338045 213800</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Arrival and Sales Both Quiet: Spot cotton transactions have disappeared. Factories are hesitant due to the sluggishness of the global cotton market.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flower and Yarn, More Decreases than Increases</h3>
<p>American Cotton Lacks Buyers: Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to a lack of major buyers and good weather. Later, it rebounded slightly due to some short covering. Futures fell 0.07-0.10 pounds, and spot prices fell 0.05 pounds. British cotton futures fell 11-12 points, and spot prices fell 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 5 points. Indian cotton softened due to weak Liverpool market prices and export sales. Pingguoer fell 1.75, Robi Aomu La fell 1.75, and Robi Bailuoxi rose 1.5 Robi.

<h3>Food Rice Market Tightly Controlled</h3>
<p>The rice market in the south saw the arrival of ships, including two from Pinghu, one from Qingjiao Gang, and one from Su Tong Gang. Rural roads are blocked, and floods are occurring in various areas, causing panic. Following the order from the Social Affairs Bureau to limit prices, the top price for Chang Gang rice should not exceed 17 yuan. Due to the impact of recent strong winds and rains, Su Chang white glutinous rice and Tongli Bei et al. are subject to price controls. Second-grade Two-Foot Yangdujian and Bianyin Yuan are scarce and have no market.</p>
<p>The arrival of inland rice at Xinzha yesterday was scarce. More than one hundred shipowners are stockpiling in the Suzhou River, with about 15,000 dan of rice. Each rice firm is calling for a 2-foot increase. Given the scarcity of goods, demand is active. With the old harvest depleted and the new harvest not yet arrived, the market situation is difficult to grasp. The rice market near the river saw 2,000-3,000 shi being opened.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Rising Four to Five Jiao</h3>
<p>The Impact of the Typhoon in This City...New Transactions in Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation was such that, because Shanghai had already suffered a typhoon, there was a unanimous upward trend. River white rice has jumped up more than one yuan. High-priced foreign rice rose by one or two jiao the day before yesterday and rose again by two or three jiao yesterday, for a total increase of four or five jiao. Even ordinary goods have risen by two or three jiao. The market is mainly focused on this street, and hoarders are even more active. Yesterday's price increase was particularly strong, but the price of white glutinous rice was limited by the municipal authorities. Yesterday, 200 bags of No. 1 Saigon were opened at a price of 15.4 yuan, 100 bags of Hong Kong rice at 14 yuan, 200 bags of Min Dang at 13.72 yuan, and 170 bags of Jiangxi Ji Yuan rice at 14.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is being sold by foreign firms. New transactions include Anli Material Company's transfer of 2,000 tons of Xiaojiao rice at a price of 6.6 taels, to be shipped in October. Xiang Mao sent a telegram for 3,000 tons of Xiaojiao rice to be shipped in November at a price of 6.45 taels. The price increase has not passed.</p>
<h3>Tapioca Flour Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tapioca flour market saw prices plummeting in all months in the morning and afternoon after the opening. Large quantities of foreign wheat have been successively traded, and manufacturers are dumping stock extremely vigorously. The number of sellers from large and small factories has reached more than 400,000 bags. Due to the severe floods in the mainland, flour sales remain sluggish. The actual sales in Tianjin alone average only 20,000 to 30,000 bags per day. The sluggishness of Shanghai flour sales is the biggest reason. With hope gone and facing manufacturer dumping, the decline is extremely severe. After the typhoon, the market has plunged, which is unexpected by most people. As a result, this month is down 0.02 yuan from the previous day, September is down 0.025 yuan, October is down 0.0325 yuan, November is down 0.03 yuan and a half, December is down 0.0375 yuan, and January is down 0.03 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Main Reason for the Sharp Decline in the Wheat Market</h3>
<p>Manufacturers Are Ordering Large Quantities of Australian Wheat...American Wheat Relief to China Will Become a Reality</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market presented a consistently bleak picture after opening in the morning and afternoon. Although the heavy winds and rains in this port had once aroused excitement, the market changed drastically yesterday after the opening price. It was rumored that a factory had ordered another large quantity of Australian No. 2 wheat, initially reported as 150,000 tons. It was confirmed that 50,000 tons had been traded at a price of 3.85 taels, 55.5 pounds per bushel. Small and medium-sized factories also ordered 10,000 tons, and countless other small batches were traded. At the same time, it was rumored that American wheat relief to China would become a reality. Therefore, people became very apprehensive and rushed to sell to hedge, causing an unusually smooth and direct decline that was difficult to contain. The market sentiment is unlikely to recover after this, and the outlook remains bleak. As a result, this month is down 0.11 yuan from the previous day, September is down 0.13 yuan, October and November are down 0.11 yuan, December is down 0.10 yuan, and January is down 0.08 yuan. Spot wheat remained untraded because factories remained inactive.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Quiet with Speculative Trading</h3>
<p>Xiao Lüqing Opens Quite Well</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market telegrams: The price of Cuban spot sugar is 1.875, continuing to rise 0.0625 compared to the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures for September is 1.38, sharply up 0.08; December is 1.36, up 0.06. The prices for March and May of the next year are 1.39 and 1.44, respectively, also up 0.04 each. The price of Java spot sugar is 7.75, and the price of October futures is 7.625, remaining unchanged. The association's market speculation and trading are both sparse, and the market forms are generally stable. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse grain white is 11.6 taels, and No. 20 medium grain white is 11.1 taels. Trading is sluggish. Taikoo Sugar H Mark is 11.85 taels, HN Mark is 1.4 taels less, and B Mark is 11.05 taels. Inquiries are also sparse, and the trend is still weak. Due to frequent floods in various places, sales are particularly stagnant. At the quotation, Jvdelong opened a new shipment of 2,600 bags of No. 2 Xiaolüqing at a price of 10.04 taels per yuan, and the traders' intentions were quite strong. The market form was quite attractive.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods Sieve Village Longan Gradually Increases</h3>
<p>Due to the winds and rains in various producing areas recently, this year's harvest is inevitably reduced again. Therefore, both new and old market prices tend to be high. In order to take care of the cost of goods, the industry association decided at the 41st Executive Committee meeting yesterday afternoon to increase the prices of Longan in various village stores. The market prices are as follows: Top Grade 40 taels, Heavenly Grade 30 taels, Tianhong 24 taels, and Office Delivery 16 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Ruzhuang Replenishes Grey Silk and Jing Que Huo</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port became even more silent. Overseas markets continued to sell Japanese silk at low prices. Chinese silk telegrams were not forwarded. Only Ruzhuang replenished grey silk and jing que huo. Lianna imported 10 bales of Shanghai White Factory Jing, and Sanbing imported 50 bales of Grey Silk, and the price remained stable.</p>
<h3>New York's Imports of Japanese Silk are Increasing</h3>
<p>The Volume Has Reached More Than 30,000 Bales This Month.</p>
<p>Since the New York Silk Exchange adopted Japanese silk as the standard for auctions, the increase in sales of Japanese silk has been rapid. Silk merchants in the silk market believe that Japanese silk is cheaper. Most silk merchants use Japanese silk. Japanese imports are increasing. According to the New York Silk Association, the volume of imports of Japanese silk has gradually increased this month. As of the 24th, it has reached 32,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Luzhuang Zhenmei's European Sales Are Recovering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market of this port, Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other places, sold by Jinlong, Tongfu, Dude, Yongxing and other firms, was activated. The traders' intentions were strong, and the market has recovered to be active. The Russian Aid Association has invited various tea merchants to negotiate, given that there are many Chinese and foreign tea merchants who need them. The general trend of the tea market is quite stable.</p>

<h3>Shenji Company's Guangli Steamer Sinks</h3>
<p>Encountered a Hurricane Outside Qingdao Port, Resulting in an Accident and Drowning of Fifteen Passengers</p>
<p>During this hurricane, maritime vessels navigating the outer seas, the Yangtze River, and inland rivers were all forced to halt, disrupting water transportation for as long as forty-eight hours. However, the Guangli steamer of the Zhengji Company encountered the storm and sank, resulting in the drowning of passengers. The details obtained by our reporter's investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident:</p>
<p>The Guangli, owned by Zhengji Shipping Company, served routes between Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Antong. This time, sailing from Antong via Liugong Island to Qingdao, the ship was overloaded with passengers and cargo, exceeding its transportation limit. Although the vessel was equipped with wireless telegraph, the telegraph operator was negligent and failed to translate and inform the shipowner about the hurricane warning, preventing any precautions. On the 25th, as the ship reached the vicinity of Qingdao Port, a hurricane struck. The Japanese shipowner, in a state of panic, attempted to steer the ship towards the coast to seek shelter. Unfortunately, due to the excessive load, the ship struck a hidden reef. Initially, it only ran aground, but subsequently, due to the rupture of the ship's hull and the excessive force of the wind and waves, it sank.</p>
<p>Passenger Deaths:</p>
<p>The Guangli was carrying eighty-five passengers from Antong, Weihaiwei, and other locations. After the ship struck the reef, it rapidly sank under the impact of the strong winds and waves. Since all other ships were sheltering from the storm and not sailing, there were no vessels at sea to provide assistance. Although the shipowner sent out an SOS signal for help, no ship came to the rescue. As a result, all passengers were forced into the sea. Later, a merchant vessel received the distress call and arrived to assist in the rescue. It is reported that seventy passengers were rescued, but fifteen drowned. Additionally, the ship's captain and first mate were Japanese, while the crew and sailors were Chinese. After the ship's accident, they all went overboard. Whether there were any casualties has not been reported to Shanghai. However, it is reported that the Zhengji Company branches in Yantai and Qingdao have dispatched ships to assist in the rescue.</p>
<p>Shanghai Office Inquires by Telegram:</p>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter visited the company's Shanghai office to inquire. According to Mr. Jin Jiefu of the office, the Guangli was sailing from Antong to Qingdao and did not depart from Shanghai, so the details were unknown. However, the Shanghai office had sent a telegram to inquire, stating, "Is the report of the Guangli striking a reef accurate? Please reply." This telegram was sent in the morning. By the afternoon, it was confirmed that the Guangli had sunk. The ship's gross tonnage was 1,380 tons, with a draft of 13 feet. It was built in 1897 and had an iron hull. After Zhengji purchased it, it was assigned to operate routes in northern China. Although the accident was due to a major storm, it was also due to the negligence of the person receiving the telegram and the lack of responsiveness of the Japanese shipowner. The whereabouts of the crew members are still unclear, and the Shanghai office has not yet received a detailed telegram report.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau also has a Guangli steamer that has safely departed from Xiamen. A reporter from the Daily News mistakenly inquired with China Merchants Bureau about this. However, the General Manager of the Bureau, Guo Waifeng, explicitly clarified this.</p>
<h3>Ships Aground After the Hurricane Subsided</h3>
<p>British Ship Aground:</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Yangtze River vessel, the Poyang, was sailing downstream from Hankou this time. However, as the ship passed Anqing, the hurricane struck. The Poyang attempted to anchor temporarily for shelter, but near Fitzroy Island, located above Nanjing and below Anqing, it ran aground. The hull became stuck in the riverbed and could not be moved. The captain telegraphed the Shanghai office for assistance. Yesterday, the company immediately relayed the telegram to the Nanjing branch, ordering them to dispatch a vessel to the accident site for towing and rescue.</p>
<p>No Ships Arrived:</p>
<p>Although the strong winds had subsided yesterday, only one ship, the麦狄逊, which had been stopped outside Wusong, entered the Huangpu River. Other ships, such as the 金华, 泽生, 定生, 吴淞, and 湘潭, which were scheduled to arrive yesterday, had not yet arrived. Only Nisshin's Yangtze River vessel, the Xiangyang Maru, arrived in Shanghai. It is expected that the other ships will arrive today.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Delay:</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo passenger ships have not sailed for two days due to the storm. They did not depart yesterday either. China Merchants Bureau's Xinjingtian and Sanbei's Ningxing, etc., are expected to arrive in Shanghai from Ningbo today. The Shanghai-Ningbo routes will resume normal operations today. Additionally, the Wenzhou-Taizhou passenger ship Dahua is sheltering from the storm in Shanghai and has not departed. The Zhoushan ship has entered the dock for annual repairs. The Chuanshan, which departed from Taizhou last Wednesday, only arrived at sea yesterday. The voyage was delayed due to sheltering from the storm. Furthermore, there is no news about the Yili and Daxing ships. It is likely that they are sheltering from the storm en route.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Ship Departures:</p>
<p>Yangtze River ships have not sailed for two days, and yesterday was the third day. After the wind subsided yesterday afternoon, the Yangtze River ships began to sail out of Wusong one after another. They will wait until this morning to depart upstream with the瑞阳丸 and 平和 ships, etc. Normal operations will only be restored today. Small Yangtze River ships to Tongchonghai and Yangzhou have all been delayed and canceled. Departures will only be arranged today.</p>
<p>Mail Ships Delayed:</p>
<p>Mail ship departures have always been strictly on schedule, but this time, due to the storm, an exception was made. Nisshin Yusen's Shanghai Maru announced yesterday that due to the delayed schedule, it has been postponed by two days and will depart for Japan today. Da Lai's麦狄逊 ship, which was originally scheduled to depart for Seattle yesterday, was delayed due to the storm and has been postponed by one day, departing for America today. Furthermore, the克里夫 ship has also been delayed due to the storm and will depart for Xiaolü and Hong Kong the day after tomorrow. Nisshin Yusen's Longtian Maru has also been delayed. It is unheard of for an incoming mail ship to be delayed.</p>

<p>Recent News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association has been very busy working in recent days. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Relief Workers Depart Qiao Baoyuan, the commissioner of the association for surveying disasters in Ning and Xu prefectures, returned to Zhenjiang Hospital for treatment due to illness. He has gradually recovered and will depart again soon to inspect the counties under the jurisdiction of the Xu prefecture. Mr. Qiao has assigned relief workers, Qiu Xiang, to various counties under the jurisdiction of the Xu prefecture, who departed on the 24th to conduct the survey. Mr. Hua Fuxian, who was recently hired, is unable to spare time due to the ongoing emergency rescue efforts in Sishui. It is reported that the eastern embankment in Gaobao and other areas is in grave danger due to continuous storms and heavy rainfall.</p>
<p>Determining Emergency Relief Counties The areas most severely affected by the Jiangsu disaster are in dire need of emergency relief to save the dying victims. The association has decided to implement emergency relief in twelve counties, including Jiangpu, Tongshan, Gaoyou, Baoying, Lianshui, Dongtai, Jiangdu, Yangzhong, Liyang, Jintan, Gan, Jian, and Liuhe. Experienced gentry who are familiar with relief work have been appointed to take charge of the inspection and distribution in different locations. The four counties of Xinghua, Huaiyin, Huaian, and Siyang are also among the most severely affected, but they are being handled by the Red Cross Society and the Huisheng Society, so they are not included in this list.</p>
<p>Forwarding Letters of Appointment from the Provincial Government The Jiangsu Provincial Government Relief Association is jointly organizing this year's relief efforts with the association, using a combination of official fundraising and charitable distribution methods. It has specially appointed Wang Zhen, Huang Qinglan, and Cheng Jingsheng as fundraising directors and formed a separate Flood Relief Association to oversee the inspection and distribution efforts and raise charitable funds. All donation registers were sent out a few days ago, and the association is using these registers to send out letters to request donations. The provincial government has also sent letters of appointment to prominent figures from all walks of life, such as Niu Tisheng, Zhang Yuejun, Zhang Gongquan, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Renzhi, Zhang Zhongren, Gu Xinyi, Wei Meisun, Cai Ziping, Li Tiaosheng, Li Yinquan, Yao Ziruo, Shi Liangcai, Huang Jinrong, Cao Guobo, Gao Lingbo, Tang Shoumin, Zhu Zhongwen, Lu Xiaobo, and Leng Yuqiu, totaling ninety people, as fundraising committee members. The appointment letters have been sent through the association.</p>
<h3>Huaian Representative Appeals for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The flood in northern Jiangsu today is even more severe than the one in the tenth year of the Republic (1921). In Huaian County, the area west of the Grand Canal to the Hongze Lake dike has been submerged for over a month, with water depths exceeding one zhang for over a hundred miles. The autumn harvest is completely lost, and all houses have been flooded. It is estimated that there are approximately 250,000 disaster victims without food or shelter, with losses exceeding 50 million yuan. Local governments, public organizations, and local figures have jointly established a flood relief association to organize emergency relief, but local financial resources are limited, with only 10,000 yuan raised, which is a drop in the bucket and difficult to continue. The Jiangsu Provincial Second Provincial Representatives' Conference in Huaian urgently requested the Huaian representatives, Yao Renshou and Zhu Tianming, to petition the provincial government in Zhenjiang. It is reported that the provincial government has agreed to provide emergency relief. Yao and Zhu also brought dozens of photographs of the disaster area to Shanghai to appeal to various charitable organizations. The tragic situation of the county's disaster victims sleeping in the open on riverbanks or high ground, crying out for food, and the vast expanse of water, reflecting the transformation of fertile fields into a sea, are all vividly depicted in the photographs, enough to move people to tears. It is also reported that the photographs will be made into copper plates and printed into booklets to solicit donations from various places.</p>
<h3>Report on Achievements of the Ningbo-Shaoxing Emergency Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Ningbo-Shaoxing Emergency Relief Association for Hankou Disaster has been devising plans to provide relief to fellow Ningbo-Shaoxing natives who are affected by the disaster in Hankou, in addition to dispatching special ships and purchasing food and medicine, which are continuously being transported to Hankou. Recently, there has been a large number of Ningbo-Shaoxing natives seeking refuge in Shanghai from Hankou. Some are suffering from poverty and illness, while others are unfamiliar with the area and find it very inconvenient. The association sent letters to the Sanbei Merchants, Ningbo-Shaoxing Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin shipping companies, requesting them to notify the association one day in advance when ships arrive in Shanghai from Hankou, so that they can send staff to receive them. Zhu Gongyu was appointed to oversee this matter. The method of receiving fellow natives is to first provide shelter upon arrival and then send them off separately. It is reported that the association received a telegram from Mao Heyuan, Lu Zhinan, and Hong Xuefan, the directors of the relief team in Hankou, stating that they have established an office in Hankou on the Erxing ship. The water level in the Han River has receded slightly, measuring 52.9 feet, which is seven inches lower than the highest level. The city's water and electricity supply is stable, and people's morale is stable. Approximately 1,000 fellow natives who have been affected by the disaster wish to return to their hometowns and are scheduled to depart tonight on the Xin Ningxing ship, which will sail directly to Ningbo. The entire team will depart again tomorrow to provide relief in various places. The situation will be reported again later. The wind is strong in the Hankou area, and the houses along the river are in danger. This is specially reported.</p>
<p>The Ningbo-Shaoxing Emergency Relief Association for Hankou Disaster relief team, led by directors Mao Heyuan, Lu Zhinan, and others, carrying medicine and food, departed on the Longhe ship on the 22nd of the month. A quick letter was received from Wuhu reporting that the fields along both banks of the Yangtze River above Nanjing were completely submerged, and the thatched houses were submerged up to the eaves. The farmers have mostly moved to higher ground. Some are waiting, also prepared with small boats. The Hongda ship ran aground on a shoal about ten miles upstream of the Three Mountains due to the flooding. The organization of the team is as follows: Hygiene Section: Xie Qigang, Yu Futian, Gu Zhimin, Hong Fusheng, Hua Bosen; General Affairs Section: Mao Heyuan, Hong Xuefan; Documentation Section: Lu Zhinan; Accounting Section: Chen Yuansheng; Public Relations Section: Zhang Yanling, Yin Huichang; Discipline and Transportation Section: Yao Youbang, Xu XiongGuan, Cheng Yiqing; Reception Section: Dong Xinqin, Qiu Changfu, Weng Yunhe, Ni Quanlin, Zhu Ruisheng; Food Supply Section: Sun Shirong, Wang Liqing; General Affairs Section: Bao Jinghan.</p>

<h3>Henan Province Sends Representatives to Shanghai for Relief</h3>
<p>The disaster in Henan Province is extremely severe and in urgent need of relief. When Zhang Fang, the director of the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the commander of the 20th Route Army, went to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, he originally intended to come to Shanghai for fundraising. However, Chairman Chiang ordered him to go to Peiping (Beijing) to discuss important matters. Zhang then sent Yu Weiren, a counselor of the 20th Route Army Headquarters, as a representative to Shanghai. Mr. Yu arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he visited Mr. Fan _, a Henanese in Shanghai, to ask for an introduction. Mr. Fan accompanied Counselor Yu to meet with Mayor Zhang, Wang Yiting, and others, who all agreed to do their best to raise funds and first allocate 130,000 to Kaifeng for relief. It is reported that Mr. Yu's trip to Shanghai to request relief was very successful. In addition to telegraphing Mr. Zhang, he has decided to return to Kaifeng within a few days.</p>
<h3>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Held an Emergency Relief Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association held a board meeting on the 25th. Song Hanzhang, Bannatto (manager of Citibank), Rao Jiaju, Father Wang Yiting, Gu Jisheng, Zhu Yinjiang, and others were present. They had a precise discussion on various emergency relief methods, but they felt that it was difficult due to the wide disaster area and insufficient funds. It was decided to hold another flood emergency relief meeting at 5 pm on the 27th. The association believes that the disaster victims in various places are currently suffering from the heat and lack of food. In a blink of an eye, the golden wind will gradually rise, which will inevitably lead to hunger and cold. The suffering will be even greater than now, and various groups are starting to work on emergency relief, but they do not have time to pay attention to this. Therefore, 10,000 sets of cotton clothes will be rushed to make and sent to the severely affected areas as soon as they are made. Yesterday, the association received the following relief funds: (1) The Rice Merchants Association of Kuala Lumpur, Malaya, wired 5,000 yuan. (2) Overseas Chinese in Manila, Malaya, remitted 1,000 yuan. (3) Gengyitang 5,000 yuan, which was raised by reading the association's thanks to Mr. Hu Wenhu for donating a large sum of balm. (4) Lida Foreign Firm 2,000 yuan, and the manager of the firm personally donated 500 yuan. In addition, people from all walks of life have also sent donations to the association, in various amounts, which will not be listed.</p>

<h3>Passengers Traveling to Japan to be Tested for Epidemics Immediately Implemented</h3>
<p>Nippon Yusen Kaisha received a telegram from its head office stating that Shanghai is a port with epidemics. All passengers traveling from Shanghai to Japan by ship must be tested for epidemics. The testing method involves the shipping company issuing a paper container for storing feces to passengers boarding the ship. After passengers disembark, they must hand over their excreted feces to the doctor designated by the ship for testing. If they are found to have epidemic symptoms, they will be prohibited from traveling to Japan. This matter will be implemented immediately. Yesterday, the company issued an epidemic testing notice stating: We have recently received the Japanese quarantine regulations stating that this port is at risk of cholera. In compliance with the Japanese quarantine regulations, passengers must store a small amount of fecal sample before 12 noon on the day the ship departs. Bedpans will be provided by the ship's purser for transfer to the ship's doctor for joint examination by the official doctor for hygiene purposes. Passengers are requested to pay attention. This is hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Representatives Meeting</h3>
<p>Public Silk Bonds to be Issued on August 31st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association convened a temporary general meeting of representatives of silk factories throughout the city yesterday (26th) at 3:00 PM. Shen Yichen, Zhu Jing'an, Huang Jinfan, and representatives from approximately 90 other factories attended. Chairman Shen Yichen reported on the progress of issuing the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds, stating that the procedures for issuing the bonds had been discussed with both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, and with both Minister Song and Minister Kong. Traveling back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai had taken time, delaying the issuance until today. The procedures for manufacturers to claim the bonds have also been discussed and agreed upon with Mr. Liu Manruo of the Fund Custody Committee. Manufacturers should first go to their respective local silk factory trade association (i.e., the silk factory trade associations in the three cities of Shanghai, Wuxi, and Zhejiang) and obtain a certificate from the Silk Public Bond Executive Committee (i.e., Shen Yichen in Shanghai, Qian Fenghao in Wuxi, and the three monks in Zhejiang). They should then take the certificate to the Fund Custody Committee to collect the bond certificates according to the number of machines they own. They must also sign a written pledge stating that after receiving the bonds, they will make every effort to resume production in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, maintain workers' jobs, improve product quality, and develop foreign trade. The issuance date is set to begin next Monday (i.e., the 31st). Our fellow traders should follow the aforementioned procedures. However, our responsibility will be even greater from now on. We should strive to revitalize and reorganize our businesses to develop foreign trade and compete with Japanese silk. Next, Standing Committee member Zhu Jing'an stood up and solemnly declared to the representatives of the factories present that the total amount of the public bonds is 8 million yuan. 4 million yuan will be used for treating the symptoms and rewarding the silk industry, and 4 million yuan will be used for treating the root causes and improving mulberry machines. All measures for treating the root causes have been discussed and formulated by silk experts and will be implemented in sequence. Our fellow traders should unanimously support the plan formulated by the experts and implement it carefully without changing the plan. The responsibility of the Public Bond Executive Committee is particularly heavy, and our fellow traders should also unanimously protect it. Only after the plan for treating the root causes proposed by the experts has been fully implemented, and the principal and interest of the public bonds borrowed by our fellow traders have been paid off on time, can they be allowed to resign. However, after our fellow traders receive the public bonds, the burden becomes heavier. Now that the European and American silk markets are so sluggish, and Japanese silk is being sold tirelessly, the future of Chinese silk is very difficult. We sincerely hope that the plan for treating the root causes proposed by the experts will be implemented in sequence. Although we have lost the Eastern corner of the silk market, we may be able to recover our original foothold. In short, our fellow traders are in a time of economic decline and should strive for unity and urgently carry out reforms to compete with Japanese silk and regain the inherent position of our Chinese silk in the overseas market. All the representatives unanimously stood up and agreed. The next item was the Factory Regulations. Chairman Shen reported that the consultations with the Social Affairs Bureau had been ineffective. After the representatives engaged in detailed discussions, they all believed that it would be extremely difficult for our silk factories to comply with the eight-hour workday and the elimination of child labor. Now that the silk market has plummeted, prices are low and costs are high, and our fellow traders are supporting it at a loss. If the regulations are implemented again, the output of each factory will be reduced, and the burden will be increased, making it difficult to maintain operations, which would be self-defeating. It was requested that the chairman submit another letter to the Social Affairs Bureau based on the situation, seeking understanding of the current difficulties and the precarious situation of the silk industry, and providing assistance beyond the ordinary. Once the European and American silk markets improve slightly, the matter can be discussed at length at a later date. The decision was approved. Finally, Chairman Shen reported that the Qianshuang Palace Silk Factory had also been approved to enjoy the rights of public bonds. The Customs has been collecting additional taxes on it since the 19th of this month, along with White Silk. However, for the export of Shuang Palace Silk that has not yet paid the additional tax, each factory should obtain a certificate from the Commodity Inspection Bureau according to the export quantity, go to the Jianghai Customs to pay the additional tax, and then take the receipt to the Custody Committee to collect the public bonds. The meeting adjourned at over 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Organizes a Factory Management Review Committee</h3>

If another committee is formed, the division of powers will lead to many obstacles. Therefore, the original Factory Management Research Committee has been expanded and reorganized and renamed the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Factory Management Review Committee. The regulations of the committee have been approved and filed by the Municipal Government. The original text is recorded below.</p>

The management representatives, Shen Wangheng and Xu Weinan, and the labor representatives, Ni Guangming and Hong Zhonghua, sincerely resolved all matters completely within six days.

<h3>Shanghai's Situation in the Great Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>All Districts of the City Suffered Damage, Roads Quickly Recovered After the Water Receded</p>
<p>Since the hurricane arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, with intermittent heavy rain, the wind intensified and the rain became heavier. The wind and rain were even greater in the evening, with a force so fierce as if it were overturning mountains and seas. At 10:00 PM, the tide of the Huangpu River, driven by the raging wind, surged ashore. The water depth in the Wangping Street area was two feet. The downstairs of this newspaper was also flooded, with a depth of about one foot, and the water was surging. By dawn yesterday, the wind had weakened slightly, and the rain had also subsided. The water began to gradually recede. However, a large number of newspaper vendors arrived at Wangping Street at 6:00 AM when the water was still ankle-deep. At that time, the newspapers had already been printed, thinking that they could inform readers of the great wind and rain situation the night before. However, the newspaper vendors distributed the newspapers while sitting on the ground, but now they could not distribute them due to the flood. Therefore, yesterday's newspapers, including this newspaper and other newspapers, could not be delivered, which is a pity. Around 10:00 AM, the water in front of this newspaper began to recede completely. Yesterday afternoon, the great wind and rain left this prosperous Shanghai. The green trees on the streets provided dense shade, and the cool breeze was pleasant, with a hint of autumn. The terrifying situation of the previous night had faded away with the wind and rain. The damages suffered by the great wind and rain in various districts of the city are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Accumulated Water in Front of the Fuzhou Road Patrol Station (Photo by This Newspaper)</h3>
<h3>Many Large Trees Along the Bund Were Broken by the Wind (Photo by This Newspaper)</h3>
<h3>Concession Area</h3>
<p>In the British and French concessions, the roads were flooded above ankle depth since the night before last, disrupting traffic. The prosperous streets of Nanjing Road, Fuzhou Road, Hankou Road, etc., only began to recede gradually yesterday afternoon. By sunset, the roads were filled with vehicles and pedestrians, returning to the scene before the rain.</p>
<p>Water Floods Bank Vaults The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that during the high tide last night (the 25th), the vault of Citibank at No. 1 Jiujiang Road was also flooded. The water level ranged from nine to twelve feet, and millions of silver coins, silver bars, and banknotes were flooded. When the bank opened this morning (the 26th), the road in front of the bank was still a vast expanse of water, and employees were temporarily ferried by automobiles and rickshaws. The fire brigade was immediately notified, and fire engines were dispatched to pump out the water from the vault. The silver coins and silver bars in the vault were naturally unaffected. However, it is feared that hundreds of millions of dollars in unissued banknotes stored in the large safe may be damaged if they are flooded, just like the huge amount of issued banknotes. The bank obtained the funds needed for today's business from another vault, so there was no shortage and no need to ask for help from other banks.</p>
<p>Water Seeps into Basements During the heavy rain the night before last, at least twenty buildings in the central area of ​​the city had their basements flooded. In addition to Citibank, companies like the Shanghai Power Company, Shanghai Telephone Company, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and the Beijing Theater were also flooded. This morning, the fire brigade dispatched vehicles to pump water from each location, and they were very busy.</p>
<p>Impact on Telephones The telephone lines of the Shanghai Telephone Company were attacked by the hurricane and rainstorm. Seventeen main cables leading to the switchboards and branch cables leading to users' homes were damaged. Repairs could only be carried out after the water on the roads receded and the accumulated water in the manholes was drained. Therefore, the lines in each switchboard were very congested today. The company has notified users to temporarily reduce the number of calls in the hopes of clearing the circuits and avoiding congestion.</p>
<p>Trees Fall and Ground Loosens All the trees along the Bund in the public concession, from the Garden Bridge to the intersection of Sima Road, were blown to the west by the wind. Some trees were even uprooted. Many trees on both sides of Avenue Edward VII and Jing'an Temple Road were also tilted or uprooted. More than a dozen sections of asphalt pavement on Great British Road were soaked by water and loosened, floating on the surface when the water receded. After the water receded, the Public Works Department immediately dispatched a large number of workers to pave the road in sections to maintain traffic.</p>
<p>Trams Stop Running The trams in the public concession, after 10 a.m., all the routes 8 and 9 running from the outer Yangjingbang to Yangshupu. Other routes 1, 2 and 3, etc., didn’t leave the depot until 3:30 p.m. In the morning, many passengers waited at each tram station. They came and went, sighing after waiting for a long time. The French Concession trams could not leave the depot because the water depth at Fangxie Road was more than a foot deep, and there was also accumulated water at Rue Luyaban. Around 11 a.m., after the water at Rue Luyaban was discharged, the trams gradually left the depot. It is estimated that the first, second, and tenth routes left the depot one after another. The fourth route was impassable. The third and sixth routes started to operate as usual from 2 p.m., running on Rue Luyaban, Avenue Joffre, Avenue de la Cascade, Rue Massenet, Xiaobeimen and other places. The trolleybus on route 18 departed on time in the morning.</p>
<p>Roads Flooded When the wind and rain were heavy the night before last, roads in the new and old districts of the French Concession, such as the middle section of Avenue de la Cascade, the east and west Zilaihuo Street, Caishi Street, Rue Massenet, Avenue MacMahon, and Avenue Lafayette were all flooded. The alleys were especially flooded, inundating people's homes. As a result, trams on all routes returned to the depot early. However, many signboards hung by shops were blown away by the strong wind. The accumulated water on the roads only began to recede gradually after 8 a.m. yesterday, when the rain stopped slightly.</p>
<p>Lights Go Out The streetlights on Avenue de la Cascade, Dongxi Xinqiao Street, Rue Massenet, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, and other areas in the French Concession were blown out when the main lines were cut off during the strong wind at 8:30 p.m. the night before last. In an instant, the streetlights went out, creating a dark world. Most businesses closed early due to the heavy wind and rain. The municipal electricity company urgently dispatched workers to repair the lines and only completed the repairs and restored the lights at 9:35 p.m.</p>
<p>Houses Collapse The four-story windows at No. 4 Zhizhong Lane, West Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, were blown off by the strong wind the night before last, falling from the fourth floor into Renmei Lane. Fortunately, no one was injured. In addition, a house also collapsed on Wende Lane, Yangshupu Road, injuring people, but there were no serious injuries.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>Water Accumulates into Ditches After the strong wind and rain the day before yesterday, various places on Jisifei’er Road, Connaught Road, Robison Road, Brenan Road, and the north bank of the creek were unable to drain the water in time. Moreover, the tide rose, turning the road into a swamp. The deepest water was more than a foot deep. Residents in low-lying areas also had several inches of water in their homes. Appliances and sundries floated on the water surface, which was shocking. Pedestrians were cut off, and vehicles splashed water everywhere. Public buses were, of course, suspended due to the strike. Route 16 trolleybuses were also suspended from the night before last due to the accumulated water on the road, cutting off traffic.</p>
<p>Shacks Collapse The shacks built by poor Jiangbei people in Xiaoshadu, Shihuiyao, Tanjia Du, Tanzi Wan, and Robison Road on the north bank of the creek were destroyed the day before yesterday. Some had their roofs blown off, some had their walls collapsed, and some were crushed while sleeping. The ground was flooded with water, and the cries of the elderly, women, and children being rained on were deafening, and the situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Large Trees Blown Down Most of the trees planted on the sidewalks along Jing'an Temple Road, Yuyuan Road, Connaught Road, and other places in West Shanghai were blown down by the wind. Many were also tilted. Several large trees in the Zhaofeng Garden on Brenan Road, which had been growing for decades and had a circumference of several arms, were also blown down. Countless other small trees were tilted. Bamboo gardens in various villages west of Chengjiaqiao were all blown down and broken. At least half of the electric poles along the railway on Hongqiao Road and Fanhuangdu were broken, and many electric wires fell to the ground. Large trees were blown down or broken everywhere in various villages.</p>
<p>Airport Suffers Losses The China National Aviation Corporation's airport on Sheshan Road in West Shanghai is located in a very empty and desolate area. It suffered considerable losses from the hurricane the day before yesterday. All the hangars for parking airplanes were blown down, and the wooden frames fell to the ground, damaging several wings. The reed mats covering the hangars were completely blown away by the wind, and it is not known where they flew. The surrounding fences and trees were also damaged.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Repairing Nanjing Road Damaged by the Flood Yesterday Morning (Photo Provided by Liguang)</h3>
<p>Fahua Water Situation Once it rains in the Fahua area of ​​West Shanghai, it is easy to flood the roads, fields, and houses because there is no way to drain the accumulated water. The night before last, the wind and rain were heavy, and the accumulated water in various places in the area was very deep. The water in residents' yards could reach their knees. The water in various places only began to recede slightly yesterday.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Area</h3>
<p>The Bund is Flooded During the heavy wind and rain the day before yesterday, the Bund was completely flooded, and the shops and homes along the river were also flooded. Around 2 a.m. yesterday, the water was above knee-deep. The Deda Wharf in Sixteen Pupu, which is being built by the Municipal Engineering Bureau, had its bamboo fences surrounding the embankment blown down by the strong wind. Police officers were on duty in the water. A kitchen boat next to the office boat of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team sank to the bottom of the river due to its dilapidated condition after being hit by the wind and waves. The office boat itself was also old and in disrepair, and it was in danger. It was almost sunk after being flooded by the heavy wind and rain, but fortunately, the officers and police on board managed to rescue it.</p>
<p>Walls and Buildings Collapse One After Another The rear wall of Qiu Haoran's house at No. 13 Qiaojia Shed, Xiaonanmen, also collapsed after being blown by the strong wind. The gable on the north side of the roof of Xu Shengfang's house at No. 58 Yaogu also collapsed due to the strong wind, falling directly on the flat roof of his neighbor Wu Jintao. The house was already old and in disrepair, and it collapsed immediately after being hit suddenly. The east gable of Liao Guoyu's house at No. 397 Zhonghua Road collapsed. The trees planted along the road on Lujiabang Road were all uprooted by the strong wind. At 10:30 p.m. the night before last, the front wall of the house of Zhou Yungong, a resident at No. 146 Qinglian Road, Chengnan, suddenly collapsed after being eroded by the wind and rain, along with the stone arch and stone pillars of the Shikumen. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<p>Water and Electricity Temporarily Cut Off The engine room main engine of the Huashang Electric Company was damaged by water from 2 a.m. yesterday, so it could not generate electricity, and the lights were all off and the trams were all stopped. Starting at 7 a.m. yesterday, the company sent many workers to rush to drain the accumulated water from the engine room, and then took out the three motors that were submerged in water and installed three new motors for application. It was not until 5:30 p.m. that the motors in the engine room were reinstalled, and the lights were turned on. The water pipes installed by the Nanshi Water Company were submerged by the tide from 2 a.m. yesterday because the motors of the electric company and the company's own power-passing motors were flooded, causing the motors to be damaged and unable to pump water. The shops and homes in the Nanshi area were completely without water. At that time, the residents were about to prepare lunch, and they panicked and went to the self-flowing wells to fetch water. Later, the company borrowed a power-passing motor from the French Concession Water Plant to pump water, and continued to supply water at about 11 a.m. All the damaged suction motors have been assigned workers to repair them, and it is expected that they will be completely restored to their original condition this morning.</p>
<p>Trams Cannot Operate Because the motor room of the Huashang Electric Company was flooded and the engine could not be started, not only could external current not be supplied, but also the trams in the factory could not operate. In addition to trying to drain the water from the motor room and trying to dry it for application, the company also planned to borrow electricity from outside to supply electricity for the lights at night. The buses in the Chinese area operated as usual, but they drove more slowly in low-lying and flooded areas. All the trams on Routes 1, 2, and Nanshi, and Routes 4, 3, and Yuan were dispatched from the factory at 6 p.m. yesterday. However, the branch lines of the electric lights at Fangbang Bridge and Wengjia Lane could not be repaired for a while, and they were not fully restored until about 7 p.m.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Area</h3>
<p>Four People Electrocuted to Death (1) At the intersection of Zhonghua Xin Road in Zhabei, an electric wire fell to the ground around 9 p.m. the night before last. Two pedestrians were electrocuted to death at the time. One was Xu Dongyuan, 43 years old, from Pudong, living at No. 1, Lane 126, Zhonghua Xin Road, working as a carpenter. The other was Lu Shugou, 24 years old, from Haimen, living in a flat in Tiantong'an, working as a rickshaw puller. (2) In front of the Fang Yuxing Wire Factory on Yokohama Road, Yang Rongchun, a Changzhou native who made and sold Cifan, was electrocuted to death. The deceased lived at No. 484 Yokohama Road, and was 42 years old. (3) In front of the door of No. 17 Hengkang Lane, Zhongzhou Road, a ragpicker child was electrocuted to death on the ground, about 17 years old. The above were all reported to the court by the Fifth District and the Fifth District Police Station for verification. (4) Wu Lu, 24 years old, a leather craftsman, the nephew of Xu Chen, who lived at No. 15 Shunxing Lane, Datong Road, went to dig vegetables in the vegetable field around 4:15 p.m. yesterday. Because the water was very deep in the field after the heavy wind and rain, Lu was swimming in the field. Unexpectedly, he accidentally drowned.</p>
<p>The Police Station Wall Collapsed During the heavy wind and rain at 9:30 p.m. the night before last, about five feet of the north wall of the house where the chief of the Sun Temple Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei lived collapsed. At the time, Zhang Lianfeng, a household registration police officer, was injured in both feet, and Zhang Liankui, a police officer in Class B, was injured in the leg. Both were sent to the hospital for treatment. The police station has temporarily moved to the Sun Temple starting yesterday.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Various Districts in Zhabei In the heavy wind and rain, many electric light wires were blown off in Zhabei. Although the water and electricity company sent workers to rush to repair them, they could not be repaired in time. Therefore, the lights only came on around 7 p.m. The wind and rain were even heavier in the evening. Because the water could not be discharged in time, various roads such as the west end of Zhejiang Road, the north section of Datong Road, and the Han Zhabei Jiaotong Road became rivers. Most of the trees planted on both sides of Zhongxing Road were blown down by the wind. The fences on the west side of the Quanwan Guild Hall, the corner of Datong Road and Zhongxing Road, and the west side of the Huta Motor Company were completely blown down. Even the sunshade of the motor company was destroyed. The rear wall of the building at No. 7 Chengren Lane also collapsed around 9 p.m. the night before last. Fortunately, no one was injured. The grass sheds in the Pushan Road area, both sides of Gonghe Xin Road, and both sides of Tanzi Wan Tanzi Port were too numerous to count. The back of Taiyuanfang North Zhonghua Xin Road, the end of Datong Road, the rear of Jiajun Guild Hall, in front of Sun Temple, east of Maigen Road Station, behind the Yong'an Company warehouse, and empty land and cemeteries were all flooded. The accumulated water in the lower parts of various roads, such as the alleys on both sides of Qiujiang Road Zishou Lane, did not recede until last night. The water and electricity company dispatched more than 300 electricians and small workers to repair various roads all day long. It was still unable to complete the work for a while, and it will continue to be repaired today. Many telephone lines of the telephone bureau were also damaged and are being repaired.</p>
<h3>Pudong Area</h3>
<p>Electricity and Telephone Cut Off The electricity in Pudong was cut off at 7 p.m. the night before last because the main power line was blown off by the wind. The lights went out at the same time, creating a dark world and causing panic. The lights came on and went out again at 9 p.m., and they did not come on again until dawn. The telephone lines were also completely out of service, cutting off communication to and from Pudong. The telephone line was still unable to be answered until last night.</p>
<p>Cargo Suffers Heavy Losses The tide rose sharply in Pu the night before last around 9 p.m. The Pudong area was flooded for three or four miles. The water was above knee-deep for those with low foundations, and they could not sleep in their homes. Water flowed on the roads, and the water depth in low-lying areas reached the waist. Fortunately, the water gradually receded until 12:30 a.m. Those farther away from Pu had not receded until dawn. The widest Dongchang Road still had more than a foot of water. The workers of the Public Works Bureau worked hard to drain it, and it was drained by 10 a.m. In addition, the Huachang Match Stick Factory in Dongjiadu, Pudong, had a large number of match sticks soaked, which turned completely black and became useless, with a loss of more than 2,000 taels of gold. The mud wall surrounding the Ruihe Match Stick Factory also had a lot of match sticks soaked, with a loss of about 800 taels of gold. Other cargo warehouses along Pu also had a lot of water damage. The terrain in the Tangqiao area is low, so the coffins in the fields were floated by the water and drifted on the water surface. After the water receded, they were far away from their original locations.</p>
<p>Houses Collapsed Everywhere When the wind was at its strongest the night before last, many houses in Pudong had walls that were not strong. Because they were wet by the rain, they fell down after being blown by the wind. Fortunately, no one was injured. The mountain head of the flat in the first ridge of Taiping Lane, Dongchang Road, collapsed. The wall of the flat at No. 10 Huaxing Lane, New Street, collapsed. The walls and chimneys of the oil cart teahouse at Lanni Ferry collapsed. Other collapsed walls were numerous, and many trees were uprooted. The straw roofs of the two ice houses of the Meicheng Ice Factory, Hujia Muqiao, Pudong, were completely blown away by the wind. The ice factories on both sides of Bailianjing also had their roofs blown off by the wind at 8 o'clock, and the ice inside was completely exposed to the sky. However, the weather cleared up in the afternoon yesterday, causing the ice to gradually melt, and there was nowhere to move and avoid the sunlight for a while, and the factory owners looked despairing.</p>
<p>Two Men Crushed to Death In the south head of Pudong Bailianjing Mei Da Lai Company, north of Zhoujiadu, there was a place of straw sheds built by dock workers, about fifteen or sixteen rooms. The night before last, the sheds were completely swept away by the wind. All the poor people from Jiangbei living inside were unable to escape in time, resulting in two men being crushed to death on the spot and seven men being injured. The family members of the deceased were still unable to buy coffins for burial yesterday, so they were crying with the bodies in their arms. The seven injured were sent to the hospital for treatment by others yesterday. It is said that one or two of them were seriously injured and may also be in danger of life. It is said that Ruo were all from Yangzhou and relied on working on the dock to make a living, but the names have not yet been verified.</p>

<h3>Huangpu River Situation</h3>
<p>Ferries Stop Carrying Passengers During the heavy wind and rain the day before yesterday, there were still small ferry boats and ferries traveling to and from Pu in the morning, carrying passengers to and from the west. By the afternoon, the wind became stronger, and the angry waves were surging, making it extremely dangerous to sail in the river. Therefore, all small ferries and ferries were closed to the port. Even the Taikoo Company's ferryboats, which carried the most passengers, were moored at the Pudong Wharf and stopped running, completely cutting off traffic to and from the Pu. The general ferry passengers did not know in advance, and gathered at the ferry wharves on both sides of the east and west to wait for the boat. Some daring Sampanmen even asked for a fare of two yuan per person to cross the river, but after the afternoon, no one dared to risk carrying passengers again.</p>
<p>Sampans Almost Overturned The force of this hurricane passing through Shanghai was unprecedented in recent ten years. Large and small ships in the Huangpu River were warned earlier by the customs, so they were fully prepared in advance and did not suffer any losses. The No. 122 sampan of the River Patrol Room was rocked out of the Suzhou River alone by Sampanman Xin Guiru at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. As soon as he entered the Huangpu River, he was swept away by the strong wind. Xin fell into the water and floated to the Nanjing Road Wharf, where he was rescued by the Xinshunxing Ferry and escaped drowning. Other civilian ships and water patrol agencies have not reported, and they are generally safe and sound.</p>
<p>Permitted Ships to Exit the Port After the customs received the news on the 24th that a hurricane was about to arrive in Shanghai, it urgently notified all ships to raise a black storm signal on the flagpole at Lujiazui, Pudong, at 4:30 p.m. on the same day, warning all ships not to leave the port. The whole day before yesterday was stormy and rainy. Until yesterday, the wind suddenly turned to the southeast, and the wind subsided in the afternoon. At 2:30 p.m., the weather cleared. The customs considered that the hurricane had passed and there was no danger to navigation, so it ordered the flagpole to lower the storm signal at 3 p.m. and allowed the ships to leave the port. In total, the storm signal was raised and lowered for a total of 46 and a half hours.</p>
<p>Boatman Drowned The Yongheng cargo barge of Puzhonghua was loaded with more than 200 pieces of foreign yarn and cloth and transported to Huzhou. At about 7 p.m. the night before last, it was blown by a hurricane near Nanpu Yexie. There was no place to avoid it for a while, and it was hit by wind and waves, causing the entire ship to capsize and the cargo to sink. All four boatmen fell into the water. Only one Wang Sanzi swam to safety, and the rest drowned. The boatman came to Shanghai to report to the shipowner and went to salvage the boat. There was also the barge No. 22949, which was destroyed by wind and waves at the Taikoo Wharf in the Huangpu River. The hull is now extant on the left side of the wharf.</p>
<h3>Wusong Area</h3>
<p>Shoreline Disaster When the autumn tide rose sharply, all the sand islands were flooded. The houses near the sand bank completely collapsed, and about forty or fifty residents, both men and women, went missing. Yesterday, more than a dozen bodies were recovered and temporarily collected in coffins by the Wusong Jisheng Association, but the exact number of deaths has not been ascertained. The disasters on various sand islands such as Dingxing Changxing Yadu and Stone have not been reported. Many power poles were blown down on the Wusong Town Wai Ma Road. All the large advertisement signs erected on Yizhou Tang and other places were swept away. Dozens of thatched houses collapsed. The wooden rafts parked in the Yunzao Creek were scattered by the huge waves, and the wooden shops suffered considerable losses. After the dams of all the fresh fish shops in Pubin were washed away, the fish, white fish, etc. raised in the ponds completely escaped, with a loss of several thousand yuan. Yesterday, the Songhu train only arrived at Zhang Huabang from Shanghai. After 11 a.m., it was restored to its original condition and could directly reach Paotai Wan.</p>
<p>Ship Accident The ships that were in trouble in the huge waves are as follows: Huang Dalin's pig boat was sunk by wind and waves in Paotai Wan. The crew was not injured. 111 live pigs were loaded, and the ship drifted into the sea. The whereabouts of the ship were unknown. Wang Changshun was loaded with 119 pigs, and the ship and cargo were unknown. The eight boatmen were rescued by an inbound steamer. Jin Changxing's fishing boat was wrecked, and a crew member, Zhu Linjiang, died. The corpse was recovered by the lifeboat yesterday. Jin Yongchun's wooden pole boat was overturned on the river bank. There were those who took advantage of the wind to loot, smashing the bottom of the boat and stealing the items. Chen Xingyong and Hu Zhangfu were arrested yesterday, and the stolen goods were searched and temporarily detained in the water patrol team. Yu Yongli's sand and mud boat was missing. Jin Yuanxing's pig boat was stranded on Yizhou Tang. A small steamer sunk by a Japanese salvage company in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Railway Flooded The section of the Wusong Yunzao Creek Station from the south to the Nanfen Road is located in a low-lying area, and the railway tracks are submerged in water, causing damage to the tracks. During the heavy wind and rain, the first two passenger trains on the Songhu Line could not pass and had to stop at Zhang Huabang Station. The passengers walked to Song, and then the stationmaster reported to the Shanghai Main Station by telephone and sent workers to Song to repair it. The 120th train from Shanghai could not reach Song directly until noon at 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>Woman Drowned Kang Xingxi, a husbandman from Anhui Province, and his wife, Cui, 18 years old, from Anhui Province, were hired from the Nanfen Road of the Wusong Yunzao Creek Station. The house of Yangjiazhai, where they lived, was quite low-lying. At 11 o'clock the night before last, the tide suddenly rose, and Yangjiazhai suddenly became a swamp. Cui, a young woman, was frightened when she saw it, and immediately planned to go to the station to take temporary shelter. Unexpectedly, the middle of the small road she was passing had been broken by the tide, causing her to fall into the water and drown. However, her body was not far away. Yesterday morning, her husband recovered her and put it under the Pengtai sidewalk until the afternoon when her husband prepared a coffin for burial. Wu Amao was also a husbandman from the Banfen Road. At the time of Cui's disaster, he was also passing by. Since then, his whereabouts have been unknown, and there has been no news of Wu Amao until the afternoon yesterday.</p>
<p>Dyke Breaks and Water Enters The embankment of the Yunzao Creek Bridge suddenly collapsed by a Zhang Xu the night before last. The water rushed in and flooded the Yangjiazhai and Ganqiao and other places inside the embankment and the Songhu Road Line, with a water depth of six or seven feet. Because it was late at night, the residents were all panicked, and the sounds of shouting and calling became a mess. At that time, the Songhu Railway's 10:05 p.m. downstream train arrived at Zhang Huabang Station. Because the road line was submerged, the driver dared not move forward and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Electricity Cut Off The wires of the Wusong Baoming Electric Light Company in the town were damaged by the storm. The lines were damaged, and the lights were off and on from the night before last to yesterday. The current was completely cut off from this morning. Most of the power poles in Paotai Wan and Baoshan were blown down. The poles and wires of the Songyang Telephone Company along the coast and in Paotai Wan, Baoshan and other places were also destroyed. Users in the town could not make calls, and long-distance telephone and telegraph traffic between Song and Shanghai was cut off.</p>
<p>Authorities Survey Yesterday morning, Zhao Zezhou, the chief of the Seventh District of the Wusong Public Security Bureau, Zhang Jiguang, the director, Tang Zuanzhi, and Liu Youxiang, the municipal members, went to survey the disaster areas and direct the relief work. In the afternoon, Wang Kezhi, a section member of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau, led more than 100 workers to Song to survey the sea dike and carry out emergency repairs. It is heard that the sea dike in Baoshan is extremely dangerous after being destroyed by this surge. If it collapses, it will affect the lives and production of the people in the upper Baoshan County. Zhao, the county magistrate of Baoshan, has urgently telegraphed the province to allocate funds as soon as possible for construction and defense.</p>
<p>###殷文龍坐飛機慘死其妻訴請賠償</p>
<p>Wife Sues for Compensation in the Tragic Airplane Death of Yin Wenlong</p>
<p>Seeking Over 103,000 Yuan in Damages</p>
<p>Judge Li Upholds Justice, Hopes for Amicable Settlement Between Both Parties</p>
<p>On December 9th of last year, the China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai airplane took off from Shanghai bound for Wuhan, but upon ascent, it collided with the massive mast of a civilian ship docked in the Huangpu River. The plane crashed, and the pilot and passengers suffered injuries. Yin Wenlong, who was employed by the British trading firm Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. in Hankou and was returning to Hankou on that flight, also met with this misfortune. His wife, Sun, is only twenty-six years old and has been left with a son, Benrong, who is still in his infancy. Afterwards, she requested a substantial sum in compensation for damages from the airline company, but the company refused. Ms. Sun then hired a lawyer and sued the First Special District Court. A hearing was once held, but it was not completed before the presiding judge was changed. Therefore, yesterday morning, Judge Li Mo took the seat in the ninth courtroom to conduct a new trial. According to the plaintiff, Yin Sun, the amount of damages she is seeking is 103,036.49 yuan, categorized as follows: (1) Funeral expenses: 2,287 yuan; (2) Future burial expenses: 2,500 yuan; (3) Education expenses for her son, Benrong: 10,000 yuan; (4) Solatium for herself: 10,000 yuan; (5) Loss of the deceased's annual income: 78,249 yuan. This amount was calculated by an insurance company. Regarding the grounds for the lawsuit, her lawyer will present them. The plaintiff's attorney then stated that the case is based on Article 654 of the Civil Code because the plane crash was neither due to an irresistible force nor to the passenger's negligence, and the company should be held liable for compensation. Next, the lawyer representing the defendant, Shanghai Airlines, argued that the amount requested by the plaintiff is inappropriate. Seeking both alimony and solatium is superfluous and without basis. Furthermore, the plane crash on that day was not due to the pilot's misconduct but was indeed caused by an irresistible force. The airline company was previously decided by the central government to be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Military Affairs, with only the postal transport section under the Ministry of Communications. This shows that it cannot be compared with shipping lines and railways. The plaintiff's reference to Article 654 of the Civil Code is also inapplicable. The contract signed between China and the United States stipulates that the company does not aim to transport passengers. The passenger ticket also stated, "The company is not liable for danger to passengers and luggage." Yin Wenlong had taken the Shanghai-Wuhan flight three times. When he signed the ticket, he acknowledged these regulations. Although he did not sign the last ticket, the ticket seller, Yao Shi, told him to sign, but he said that he had taken the flight many times and acknowledged all the regulations, so there was no need to sign. This point can be proven by summoning Yao to testify in the future. In short, the preliminary issue in this case is who is responsible. If the company does not have to bear this liability for negligence, then the plaintiff's request for damages is not valid. Therefore, he requested the court to make an intermediate judgment on the issue of responsibility. Judge Li said that the plane crash was an unfortunate incident and could not be considered an unlawful killing. The plaintiff should not make excessive demands, while the defendant should show compassion for the deceased. If both sides stick to their own opinions, even if the judgment is made by law, it may be difficult to achieve fairness. Therefore, he ordered the case to be rescheduled, asking both parties to go outside to seek a settlement. If it is still difficult to reach a peaceful resolution, another hearing will be scheduled.</p>

The Second Special District Court was instructed to reschedule the hearing. Yesterday was the scheduled date, and the Criminal Court President Ge Zhitan opened the trial at 2 PM. The police lawyer briefly explained the case. Zhang Aliu testified that he worked as a servant at 18 Avenue Albert and became acquainted with Wu Jinsheng. On the 5th of this month, Wu called him to Mei Chunquan's place at 6 Changsha Merchants in Dianzi Street to play mahjong. After finishing, Mei gave Wu a 5-yuan banknote and asked him to buy toothpaste for one yuan at a foreign store at 655 Avenue Joffre and return the four yuan. Later, on the 9th, he met Wu and Mei at the Great World, and they gave him another 5-yuan banknote to buy soap for one yuan at 655 Avenue Joffre, but the store owner noticed and arrested him. Before this, he didn't know it was counterfeit money. Gu Jinchun testified that he lived at 46 Jianye Lane, and the house was rented by Zhang Wenpu on the 3rd day of the fifth lunar month, with a monthly rent of 30 yuan and a deposit of 30 yuan. Zhang came forward to rent the house, and after the rent was settled, Zhang gave him 32 silver dollars, asking him to pay the 28 yuan. After ten days, Zhang moved in. After another week, he went to ask for the money he paid, but he didn't know anything about the counterfeit money or the machines. He had previously been involved in a counterfeit money case in the Public Concession for one year and two months and now dares not ask about it. Li Tiedan had previously known Zhang Wenpu at a place. Wu Jinsheng testified that Mei Chunquan was his friend. On the 5th of this month, Zhang Aliu played mahjong at Mei's place and saw Mei sell two banknotes to him for three silver dollars. The next day, Zhang brought two more silver dollars to buy counterfeit banknotes from Mei. Yao Yixin testified that Mei Chunquan was his uncle and lived in the Changsha Merchants. Mei had previously told him about counterfeit money on Sixth Avenue. He is now living at Mei's place due to a family division. One day, he, Mei, and a villager went to Chen's house on Huacheng Road and saw an old man give Mei four banknotes, which Mei then gave to the villager. He didn't know anything about this matter. Gu Wangshi testified that she was a widow and had known Gu Jinchun since last year May. She did not know Zhang Wenpu. On the 1st of this month, Zhang called her to Jianye Lane to pay the rent. She did not know about the counterfeit money. Gu Genlin testified that he came to Shanghai last year in January and was recommended by his uncle Jinchun to work at Afu Beef Restaurant in the Sun Temple. He had diarrhea and went to his uncle's house to recuperate on the 27th day of the sixth lunar month. He did not know about the counterfeit money. Wang Rongsheng testified that Zhang Wenpu brought the counterfeit banknotes on the afternoon of July 27th, saying that Gu Jinchun would come to pick them up the day after tomorrow. That night, Ye Chenshi returned him 1.2 yuan for mahjong money and saw that it was counterfeit, so she took away two banknotes. He did not know about this matter. Ye Chenshi testified that the old man from someone else's family was her daughter's adoptive grandfather, Mei Chunquan. He lost money gambling and came to borrow money from her. She had no money, so he took away two counterfeit banknotes. There were six or seven counterfeit banknotes that a Wenzhou person named A Chang had sent to her house. Cai Gefei testified that he was an adjutant in the First Brigade of the newly formed 24th Division of the Army. The troops were in Shoumaji. He came to Shanghai for medical treatment due to illness. He had met Gu Jinchun twice. On the 29th of last month, Gu asked him for Cao's address at his door. He had a barbaric quarrel and was bitten, holding a grudge. He was involved in a counterfeit money case in the Public Concession for three years in 1926. He does not know about the current counterfeit money case. Li Tiedan testified that he knew Gu Jinchun at a friend's place last year. He did not know about the counterfeit money case. The witness Song A'er testified that he managed the gate in Jianye Lane. The house at 46 was rented in May. He saw Gu Jinchun and Gu Wangshi living inside. He sealed the window because the house was in the back lane, so he couldn't see anything. Xue Dejin testified that he was a guard in Jianye Lane, alternating day and night shifts. Besides seeing Gu Jinchun and Gu Wangshi entering and exiting 46, someone came in and out at night. He did not see or hear the sound of machines. The machines were moved in when they moved in. After hearing the testimonies, Judge Ge announced that the hearing would be adjourned to continue on the afternoon of September 9th. He also ordered that Cai Gefei's status as an active duty soldier be verified and that all the seized counterfeit banknotes and equipment be sent to the court's property storage to be inventoried.</p>

<h3>郵務工會再呈錢局長</h3>
<p>Postal Workers Union Submits Another Petition to Director Qian</p>
<p>Also Admonishes the Chief Secretary and Secretary</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers Union and Trade Union have repeatedly petitioned the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications regarding the new Postal Administration Organization Law, which undermines the foundation of the postal service, in order to safeguard the postal service, and requested a review and amendment. However, even while the request for reconsideration was pending, Director Qian of the Postal Administration hastily eliminated key positions such as the General Bureau's examination, auditing, and secretarial positions, and appointed Xu Shifang as the Chief Secretary and three other people as secretaries outside the provisions of the Organization Law. The union is currently lobbying the Director, and the petition to Director Qian and the letter admonishing the secretaries are recorded below: (1) Petition: Submitted to report that the personnel used outside the bureau after the promulgation of the Postal Administration Organization Law lack postal experience and affect the transportation business. It is sincerely requested that the personnel used be suspended within a week and that experienced postal personnel be re-appointed to benefit the postal service and facilitate transportation. Since the promulgation of the Organization Law, it has been difficult to implement, and the unions have submitted to Your Excellency and forwarded to the ministry, requesting that the principles proposed by the unions be transferred to the Legislative Yuan for approval and amendment. The unions believe that the law not only disrupts the existing postal system but also shakes the foundation of the postal service. The day of its subversion is very much today. The unions love and protects the postal service with Your Excellency's heart. It is difficult to remain silent in times of crisis. In addition to urgently submitting to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications to appeal for amendments, Your Excellency is also sincerely requested to consider the difficulty of creating the postal service and the fear of its subversion. The personnel used outside the bureau after the promulgation of the Organization Law should be suspended within a week and re-appointed with experienced postal personnel to show a selfless determination to protect the postal service. In the future, the postal service that our country has painstakingly managed for more than thirty years will not be in danger, all thanks to Your Excellency, and the illustrious achievements will be immortalized forever. Your Excellency is sincerely requested to consider this. The future of the postal service is fortunate. The unions have a noble desire to save the postal service but no power to interfere in politics. However, we cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the postal service decline without saving it, and we will unite our 36,000 postal workers to fight for it. We are anxious and respectful in submitting this. (2) Admonition: Dear Sir/Madam, since the promulgation of the Postal Administration Organization Law, it has been difficult to implement. The council believes that it has a profound impact on the future of the postal service and has already petitioned the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Postal Administration for approval of review and amendment. However, Your Excellency took the opportunity to enter the bureau after the promulgation of the law, lacking postal experience and knowledge of postal conventions, consuming national currency without benefiting the postal service. Can you not be ashamed of enjoying a high salary? In addition to petitioning Director Qian to suspend Your Excellency's position within a week, this letter is specially delivered. It is hoped that Your Excellency will leave the bureau and retire cleanly within a week. It is still not too late to turn back. Otherwise, the public sentiment will be resentful, and Your Excellency will only abandon yourself.</p>

<h3>Youth Forum: In Memory of My Deceased Friend, Mr. Chen Xingshu, and an Introduction to His Thoughts (Sent from Paris by Heting)</h3>
<p>On the path of life, where can one find a friend who truly understands and sympathizes? People are often separated by walls of copper and iron. But in this society filled with alienation, in this society filled with coldness, in this society filled with mutual jealousy, if one can encounter a kindred spirit, it is such a precious consolation on our life's journey.</p>
<p>I knew Xingshu. My friendship with Xingshu was not long, only a year or two. But his clear thinking, his pure heart, his transcendent insights, made people both respect and love him. In a short period of time, he quickly left a very deep impression on my mind, an indelible image.</p>
<p>But, he couldn't escape the attack of his tragic fate. A life in its prime was afflicted with an incurable disease and cut short. All the friends who knew Xingshu, all the friends who understood Xingshu, who could not feel惋惜? Who could not weep in pain?</p>
<p>All the memories of a deceased friend are inherently painful. Why should people constantly remember such miserable scenes, causing our fragile nerves, the nerves that are everywhere under pressure, to leave lifelong unhealing wounds? But should Xingshu's many ideas, many virtues, be forever buried with his physical body? I cannot believe it. I absolutely cannot believe it. Although life is painful, it is not so meaningless. Individual efforts and struggles, life and death, survival and demise, in the evolutionary history of mankind, are like - sometimes even less than - a tiny wave in the vast ocean. But the power of even a tiny wave, though small and weak, does not disappear forever... However, what permanent and indestructible place does a single element occupy in nature? Human intellect has not yet been able to measure this, and it is not known to say dogmatically that there is none. This is merely a clever trick of self-consolation and self-deception. In reality, the universe and life are not as simple as the human mind. The self-proclaimed and arrogant heroes and seemingly invincible scholars, what do they ultimately know? I believe that all of Xingshu's virtues and all of his ideas have indirectly and directly left behind seeds that will not perish from society, seeds that will survive forever...</p>
<p>These words commemorating Xingshu that I am about to write are an expression of my foolish belief.</p>
<p>I am not here to sing the praises of the dead. Once a person dies, they are all good people, all sages and virtuous men; this has become a fixed rule in Chinese society. But the most precious thing in society is still the single word "truth." Why should people haphazardly exaggerate for dead or living friends, creating many confusing and misleading "slogans" and "advertisements" in society?</p>
<p>Xingshu, like anyone else, had many innate and acquired shortcomings. Man is not a god. I don't say he had superior wisdom or talent. Humanity has ten thousand different kinds of intelligence, ten thousand different kinds of abilities. Since everyone's intelligence and talents are different, bamboo heads have their uses, wood shavings have their uses. How can knowledge, ignorance, high and low, be a simple matter that can be easily assessed? Social progress is accumulated from the different advantages of many people. Who is truly a hero, who is truly a great man? I contain my bitterness as I recall and describe Xingshu's character and thoughts precisely because I cannot bear to let all of Xingshu's special qualities – just as each person has their own special qualities – be buried from this point forward, no longer existing in the world.</p>
<p>Xingshu studied economics, but he was not what is called a "specialist" in present-day society. He was indifferent to nothing. He was always concerned with and studied famous works of literature, politics, history, etc., and had considerable insights. In China, where the tradition of the "imperial examination" is deeply rooted, in the atmosphere among students studying abroad - the good students - who only know how to memorize lecture notes and take degrees, how often could one see Xingshu's attitude of research, his attitude of broad learning?</p>
<p>He was by nature quiet and did not speak much. In his presence, the air seemed especially calm. Once, I jokingly said to him, "You are so quiet that when I see you, my breathing also becomes slower than usual, and speaking is even more... necessary." His spirit of analysis and research was expressed in this silence. Everywhere, between the lines of text, and at all times, beneath the surface of things, he raised questions and pursued truth. Therefore, knowing through stillness, he often had insights that were different from others. We know that the truth of things in the world is often hidden, concealed in extremely subtle and uncommon phenomena. How could this be observed and comprehended by those clever people who are impetuous and restless, who supposedly read books without seeking thorough understanding?</p>
<p>Whenever he encountered a famous work, he often read it through in one go, as if the book was about to "spoil" or "rot." But no work could make him infatuated. He was not like many people who, if they did not admire a certain author's work, would praise a certain school of thought. When people talk about famous works, they often admire them to the point of ecstasy, worshiping them until they are smug. However, like actors performing in a play, when they perform with vivid perfection, they are no longer themselves - they are merely skilled and adept at imitating actors.</p>
<p>Xingshu, however, never did that. He was constantly criticizing, constantly analyzing any object, any famous work. They were merely the material of his thoughts. He only extracted a point or half a point from them. When "learning," he was constantly "thinking." He never became a slave to books. He was never infatuated. Therefore, in his mind, there was not a single thing that had not been digested. He was not a bookshelf, not a...... dictionary or encyclopedia. He was a person who studied independently.</p>
<p>Many friends believed that Xingshu could only criticize and analyze, and had no ideas or self. According to their views, it seemed that those who were resolute in their ideas, after reading three famous books on individualism, would become followers of individualism; after reading a few volumes of works on collectivism, they would advocate collectivism; after listening to a few lectures on socialism, they could become leaders of socialism. This is simply taking blind faith as belief, and stubbornness as will. This is a childish disease, a slavish nature, of the Chinese people. Whether they are "infatuated with the new" or "infatuated with the old," their foolishness is ultimately the same. How do they know that a person with a truly strong and truly great personality must be most critical and analyze in the most detail, and his tolerance is also the greatest? In fact, everything in the world, every truth, contains some degree of doubt, except for a few scientific laws. Therefore, Xingshu's fondness for criticism and analysis precisely reveals the strength of his personality.</p>
<p>One day, a friend said to Xingshu, "When we do things in society, we should always carry some degree of 'infatuation,' believing in a certain doctrine, a certain thought, and we should believe in it to the end." Needless to say, this is a fashionable saying popular in Chinese society. Xingshu heard this and greatly disagreed. He believed this was a step backward. He believed that the spirit of criticism and the attitude of doubt were a great gift of modern civilization after the Renaissance. If we lose this spirit, we will still return to the Middle Ages, and we will still be mired in darkness and superstition.</p>
<p>Criticism and analysis are not only the main spirit of Xingshu's learning, but also the essence of his being. In present-day China, everyone uses their ears and eyes to replace their thoughts; everyone "takes the thoughts of society as their thoughts," "takes the will of society as their will." They have become the echo of society, and they don't even know it themselves. Who still knows the value of criticism and analysis, and who knows even more that only in criticism and analysis can one find the "self," can one cultivate a great self?</p>
<p>Now I will introduce his thoughts, his collectivism.</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of capitalism, individualism has dominated everything in economics, politics, and morality... Most European people have become extreme egoists. They regard making friends, discussing doctrines, and studying knowledge as the same as eating and wearing clothes, all for the sake of "me." They deny all "values that transcend the self" in the world. In their logic, having money is naturally being a capitalist, and being without property is naturally joining the Communist Party. Of course, on the one hand, mankind has progressed and become smarter; people already know that there is a "me," and are no longer willing to be oxen and horses who are willing to be human slaves. However, the greatest malady of individualism lies in becoming narrow and blindly selfish, especially in China, because any doctrine that is imported to China invariably becomes even more extreme.</p>
<p>Xingshu extremely opposed individualism. He denied the existence of the individual. He believed that only society has a real existence; the existence of the individual is unreliable and illusory. People believe that they can think, but according to his meaning, how can people truly think? Individual thoughts are entirely the product of the social environment. When society evolves to a certain degree and a certain phenomenon occurs, a certain doctrine and theory are produced. Individual consciousness, the consciousness that it can think and create, is entirely an illusion. This and the illusions theory of historical materialism and modern French sociology are largely in agreement. However, Xingshu did not believe in historical materialism, nor did he believe in sociological theories. This was his own conclusion from observing and studying society; he did not copy them.</p>
<p>He believed that modern Western individualism and atomism—applied to society, regarding society as merely a collection of individual elements, where individual elements are real—have already caused no small amount of disorder and error in society. The lessons of the past can serve as a warning. How can I repeat its mistakes? Separated from society, who can exist as an individual?</p>
<p>My and his opinions are largely the same in this regard. The ability of a society or group to survive and develop depends entirely on whether its members can take the happiness of the group as a prerequisite. In the two months before his illness, he wanted to invite many friends to openly and honestly discuss social issues. He believed that if everyone could forget their own private interests and stand on the standpoint of society to analyze, discuss, and study, they would surely be able to arrive at a common proposition and an objective conclusion, to serve as a standard for individuals to do things in society. What he most hated, according to him, was to discuss doctrines and loudly proclaim revolution while harboring selfish motives.</p>
<p>We were about to agree with our comrades to begin the discussion in the shortest possible time, but soon, the demon of illness had seized him. He began to feel mentally exhausted. He became ill. He abandoned this world and left. Is life really so fragile, so meaningless? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The left wing, the British Third Army commanded by General Byng, participated in the war in succession. Because several armies arrived late - Marshal Haig had reported this - the attack was also delayed until the 21st. In order to avoid repeated delays, after the victory of the Tenth Army on the 19th, I sent the following urgent military letter to Marshal Haig:</p>
<p>The enemy forces have been shaken in various places where they have been attacked. Our army should intensify its attacks. All divisions should quickly enter the front line. Therefore, the advance of your Third Army was previously postponed to August 21st. When that date arrives, it should cooperate with all the divisions of the First Army and the entire Fourth Army to launch a fierce attack. After the great victory of your army in the last eight or ninety-three days, it would be a missed opportunity if the troops of each army hesitated and failed to advance.</p>
<p>The invincible British Third Army, after invading the German defense line on August 21st, repelled the enemy forces between Mayenne and Bapaume, crossing the Arras-Bapaume railway line. On the 23rd, it continued to advance, and on the 25th, it pursued to the outskirts of Croisilles and Bapaume.</p>
<p>The British Fourth Army, taking advantage of the opportunity, advanced north of the Somme, reaching the Mametz Plateau and the Pozières Heights.</p>
<p>Although the attacks on both wings north of the Somme River and in the area of the Avre River were completely victorious, the central British and French armies engaged in fierce battles towards Roye between the Somme River and the Avre River, without any significant success.</p>
<p>It is now increasingly certain that the resistance of the German central army can only be encircled and defeated by the forces on both wings of our army. I had no difficulty in persuading the British Commander-in-Chief to agree with this point. As early as August 22nd, Marshal Haig, with accurate observation and excellent enthusiasm, told me during the meeting at the Moreuil villa that the attack of the British Third Army, with the assistance of the British Fourth Army north of the Somme River, was determined to be carried out with all its strength, and had ordered Generals Byng and Rawlinson to quickly advance along the line of Gouzeaucourt-Épehy-Ronssoy. At the same time, the British First Army would successively attack and break through the line of Thélus-Gouzeaucourt on the other side of the Scarpe River around the 26th.</p>
<p>These arrangements are detailed in the British Army Headquarters' general order of August 24th, which coincides with my plan. Therefore, on August 26th, I wrote a letter to Marshal Haig expressing my admiration and stating that Commander Pétain's troops were also prepared to attack with the same plan.</p>
<p>On August 27th, Marshal Haig wrote to me hoping that the American army would participate in this battle and proposed that the deployment of the American army should be aimed at attacking Cambrai and from Mézières.</p>
<p>Thus, the "major offensive battle" that I had considered in my plan of July 24th was approaching the time of its implementation. (To be continued)</p>
