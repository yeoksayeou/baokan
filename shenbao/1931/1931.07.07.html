<p>時評</p>
<h3>再論萬寳山案</h3>
<p>萬寳山案釀成如此重大之形勢。將來如何交涉。爲我國人極端注意之事。查此次韓民旣挾一未經批准備案未得多數地主同意。僅勾結少數人私訂之一種廢約而來。强挖水田。華農爲自衛權利。起而自動塡平。則肇事之責任。已顯然有屬。此爲亟應注意之第一點。日武警旣藉保護之名。以助韓農非法墾挖於前。復聯合日軍以攻擊我華農於後。我方武警馳往排解。亦被圍擊。致我農警受重大損失。此其責任所屬。又甚明顯。應爲我國人注意之第二點。朝鮮全境各地。借援助萬寳山爲名。隨處發現排華風潮。平壤仁川開城等處華人家族。幾乎全校毁壞。死傷不計其數。形勢現尙險惡。保護華僑溺職之責任。非屬其政府而又將誰屬。華僑受此極慘重之損害。又將何法取償。此爲我國人亟應注意之第三點。</p>
<p>萬寳山案與韓人排華事件。雖爲一問題。而實係兩事。主因各有所在。而皆爲其政府縱容而成。韓民移殖我東省。實爲日本殖民政策之先鋒隊。故數年來韓民之來東墾種水田者。一方由韓人組織利農公司。一方則由日人設貸欵局。借給韓農資本。由是韓農勾結當地莠民。或竊賣他人田畝。或先誘租而後强佔。因此種非法手段。而引起地方上鬭毆與訴訟之糾紛。不知凡幾。韓人有恃無恐。膽乃愈大。遂成此次萬寳山之鉅案。再就朝鮮言之。韓人嫉妬我華僑奪其工商生計。蓄心驅逐我華僑已久。而其政府復設種種苛例。以壓迫我華僑。或藉口居留證手續之不完而扣留。或藉口稅未納足而勒令出境。華僑早處於進退維谷之境。韓人恃有政府主持。乃益放膽橫行。屢次躍躍欲試。今之暴動。雖借名援助萬寳山韓民。實不過欲自達其驅逐我僑之目的。故此兩問題。表面固有牽連關係。而其實際。根本上各有醖釀之主因。而又皆非一時突起之問題故此次交涉。非就其徵結所在而解决之。恐風潮不易平息也。</p>

<p>自由談外國人所說的外國話  徐午生　　身上生毛　在一個夏日炎炎的時候。一位外國人對着中國人說。「你們中國人。眞是有一副天生的福氣。到了酷暑的時候。也不覺得十分熱。平平安安的過去這暑天了。我們外國人在暑天的時候。眞是一度難關呢。因爲我們身上生的渾身是毛。好像在一百度的氣候中。加穿了一件純羊毛衫。你想熱不熱呢。所以現在外國中暑死的人近千了。但是我到了貴國好幾年。過一年。那毛脫一次我覺得比較我新到的時候少得多了。這種是得着貴國的天然淘汰。所以我還活着呢。　　手心紅了　在每年七月四日那一天。是一個美國獨立紀念日。有幾位美國人。想學林肯對待黑人的平等主義。趁這獨立紀念日的機會。找到了幾位面熟人不熟的菲洲黑人共飲。酒至半酣。那白人勸黑人再乾一杯。機會難逢。黑人表示醉了。白人說你的面上紅。也不紅怎麽醉了呢。黑人說你們的醉醉在面上。但是我們的醉醉在手心中。你看的手心紅了。　　無抵抗力　有二位西方的旅行家。住在西湖裹的西泠飯店。到了第二天。已經住在上海的公濟醫院了。醫生問他什麽病及起病的原因。他回答說我在西湖游玩的時候。飲了一杯湖裹的冷水。就生痢疾了。還有一位接連的說。我連水都沒有上口。不過早上起來用冷水盥口一次。也有同樣的毛病了。醫生對這二位旅行家說。這是缺乏抵抗力的大原因。去年也有一位中國的貴族來。聽說是位部長。因爲南京水不淸潔。所以他們飲杭州的虎跑泉了。是用火車裝去的。要是你們再去遊玩。最好是用虎跑泉在電爐上燒滾之後。再用機器冰。冰過六小時以上。再用電爐將水燒開。冲茶。冲咖啡。這樣的辦法。一千西西水量中的微生蟲。可以不到一千隻了。二位旅行家回到杭州。如法泡製。　　還是上海　有一位外洋輪船公司的總理。生平喜歡用硬領。他告訴朋友說。我的硬領是在東京長崎地方洗來的。所以你看我的硬領多光澤潔白啊。他又說。我從前在日本做總理的時候。我的硬領寄到美國舊金山去洗的。那是比現在的美觀呢。後來這位總理調到漢口去了。有人問他現在你的硬領在什麽地方洗呢。他低聲的回答說。現在路途太遠了。沒有法子。還是寄到上海去洗罷。終比較漢口好一點呢。湖樓詩課  天虚我生　　近爲小兒女課诗。所讀不過千家詩絶句三十餘首。已能塡詞於左列空格中。各自不同。頗饒興味。錄供自由談讀者。以助消夏資料何如。（附例）○應平□應仄▲則平仄不拘●須協韵　　過了○○日漸●畫擔低處□○●▲○▲□微風起▲□滿○人影●（其一）　　夜來▲□透窗紗銀漢○○□半斜誰泛扁舟○□□▲○橋畔□○●（其二）　　雨後○○放嫩睛▲○陰裹聽○●▲○一帶○○路▲□倪黃畫□●（其三）　　▲○橋外水○●山色○○□似●獨坐○○誰□□▲○簾底一聲●（其四）　　右如塡寄本報自由談編輯部。當擇尤披露。備嶒薄采。以助雅興。藉當切磋。學詩捷徑。似無過於此也。誌王梅癯夫人之喪  劉嘯仙　　王梅癯先生病中。其少君禱於西湖某寺。得籤曰。雖然異曲不同工。折梅摧柳一般同。當時未識何解。先生沒後數月。其德配楊太夫人。在滬爲電車輾斷雙足。醫治罔效。相繼逝世。方悟籤意。夫人工詩詞。以老年而死於非命。聞者莫不悲悼。余因作聯輓之。　　摧柳折梅。靈籤成讖語。淸才淑德。巾幗失宗師。　　誌謝　屯溪黎陽汪經餘堂所製之黃山白藕粉。有淸肺潤脾之功。逈異尋常品。昨承友人見惠二斤。特此道謝。並爲紹介。代售處無錫工運橋堍大有絲繭堆棧。　　短訊　本月十一日。爲甬紳虞洽卿先生旅滬五十年紀念。天一影片公司適於斯時。向美國購運到攝製有聲影片之慕維通機器全部。該公司經理邵醉翁君。届時將偕同攝影師等前往攝收新聞紀念片云。梵王渡考  煙雨　　梵王渡與聖約翰二名辭。因地理上之關係。轉相沿用。牢不可破。蓋滬人以聖約翰書院鄰近梵王渡畔。因稱呼上便利故。遂假渡名以名校。年代積久。梵王渡之名乃隨聖約翰與時俱顯矣。　　梵王渡之解說。可分兩種。嚴格言之。應作法華鄉中。蘇州河畔之津渡解。就習慣之意義解釋。則爲聖約翰書院之别名。此種解釋理由。前已言之。今請論嚴格之解說。明嘉靖二年。知縣鄭洛書。沿吳淞江即今蘇州河設官渡六。給舟十四。民甚便之。是爲津渡之始。明嘉靖間以迄有淸同治。相距逾二百年。津子逐利。擅自增設渡頭。隨在定名。其可考者。減水河渡等十四渡而已。梵王渡其一也。考梵王乃大梵天王之别稱。名尸棄。與梵衆。梵輔同爲色界初禪三天者云。印度遊記（六二）　　大學之西。有磚塔。不可登。高六七丈。周數十步。云是阿輪加王所造。中有佛骨。又西一院落中。亦皆石像。有象缺長鼻矣。印度人思想高遠幽深。惟賴斷碑石碣以表之。龍象凋零。可爲慨歎。然可證明印人之魄力不小也。吾不解中國人好塑泥像。而石造像不多。惟河南等處有二。南方各山甚少。何其魄力永久思想不如印人也。但印人又不如埃及人尖塔矣。比較民族心力。亦要事。　　鹿野苑有各種綵色鳥。飛來窗外。大如鴿。甚馴。常聞鳴聲極美。殆即此鳥歟。此鳥是否爲佛所化身。以悲喜音化衆生。則不可知也。　　又西爲一井。其井甚大。製造亦好。余見有四白牛曳其機輪。而未知其用。近視之。飲其水。有一男子二婦人管理之。每次兩牛輪流曳之。蓋此井用滑車。釣皮帶以上水。水流入溝中。由暗溝流入古物院中。彼以牛力代自來水之用也。印度各地均有此大井。用水門汀爲之。用滑車上水。甚可爲法。余問之印度古時亦有此井。抑近代爲之。答古有此井。惟以水門汀乃新法耳。余按佛經。佛曾說於道旁造井。爲修德之一。可見印人古時已注意於此。故佛說之。而我中國各地好井不多也。中國人缺乏公共組織。八口主義太盛。利家念切。不知合羣造好井。殊可歎也。　　又向西數十步。爲一荒原。有大樹甚美。有牧童與黑羊。余坐息片時。自此北行數十步。一片石基。約方半里。盡爲舊時廟址。石磚爲紅色。有阿輪迦王石柱。此間若蓋大學宿舍甚好。我甚望中國人努力爲之也。印人視華人十分親密。望中國之强之熱心。不亞華人。並甚望其來此收拾固有産業。嗚呼。中國佛徒苟知報恩者。此汝故家物也。余書至此。不覺涙下。成偈一首。太子出家成法王。至今斷碣立荒岡。摩娑遺址空憑弔。石象嘶風映夕陽。說部扶輪會？？？（一四）徐卓呆　　子良把一碗黃豆芽，移在桌子邊上，不打算吃了，夫人只管笑着：「黃豆芽，什麽不好？又是鮮美，又是極滋養，價錢也便宜，眞是一種理想的飯菜，」　　子良見一碗自己點的百葉炒肉絲之外當眞有一碗湯，這是夫人今天特别討好。一看這碗湯。顏色倒很鮮艷。　　「這是什麽湯？」　　「菠菜豆腐番茄做的湯。是我發明的。」　　夫人得意洋洋的說。　　「箥菜豆腐番茄。呌什麽湯？」　　「本來。箥菜和豆腐。做成的湯。呌做靑龍白虎湯。現在我加了一樣番茄，可以呌革命湯。」　　「革命湯？」　　「又可以呌靑天白日滿地紅！」　　子良暗想：伊無非鬧着玩。弄菜。怎麽可以如此？怕弄得不倫不類，一定不好吃的，所以也不再問伊，就此吃飯了，自己點的百葉炒肉絲，倒先要嘗嘗，他吃了一筷，覺得滋味很酸，幾乎咽不下去。　　「爲什麽這百葉炒肉絲，有此發酸？」　　「當然！」　　「當然？我從來沒有吃過酸的百葉炒肉絲！」　　「放了醋下去不酸，倒是放了糖會酸麽？」　　「誰呌你放什麽醋？用不着的啊！」　　「有書爲證。你點了百葉炒肉絲，我就去把我從前烹調傳習所的講義，拿出來一看，才曉得要用些什麽材料，醋，用一兩，講義上有的。」　　子良聽了，那裹肯信？現在不能下咽，就足以證明講義的荒謬。　　「我不信！」　　「不信，給你看講義。」　　夫人不肯軟化，伊放了筷，特地到灶間裹去，拿出一册伊視爲金科玉律的烹調講義來，尋到百葉炒肉絲的地方，便放在桌上，給子良看。</p>

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3>Koreans Run Rampant, Overseas Chinese in Pyongyang Massacred</h3>
<p>Thousands of Rioters Gather in More Than Ten Teams to Attack Chinese People. Every Chinese House in the City is Destroyed, with Countless Deaths and Injuries. Intense Anti-Chinese Sentiment Sweeps Through All Major Towns. Zhang Weicheng Cables the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Reporting that the Situation is Serious.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying close attention to the case of Japanese police shooting Chinese farmers in Wanbaoshan and has urgently telegraphed the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to inquire about the truth of the case, and after receiving a reply, it will determine the appropriate measures to take. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the Wanbaoshan case, a certain country instructed the Koreans to reject the Chinese; all unruly Koreans in Seoul, Incheon, Zhennampo, Wonsan, and Busan rose up to attack overseas Chinese shops and residences, and the Chinese district in Seoul was even set on fire. The Japanese police knew that they could not control the situation and suppressed it, with hundreds being reported but not arrested. Overseas Chinese shops in Kaesong were also destroyed, with twenty Koreans being reported but not arrested. Our Consul General in Seoul, Zhang Weicheng, has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, believing the matter to be serious and requesting the government to preside over it. The telegram may be made public this evening. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The British and American sides learned that hundreds of overseas Chinese in Seoul were seriously or lightly injured, several died, and more than twenty were missing. The trend is still spreading, and they are deeply concerned that this problem will expand and become a problem of free cohabitation between Manchuria and Korea. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shenyang telegram: The Northeast Diplomatic Association resolved on the Wanbaoshan case: (1) Issue a declaration to awaken the public; (2) Petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiations; (3) Compensate the lives and property of the farmers who were shot. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Jilin) Kwantung Governor Tsukamoto has completed consultations with the authorities and left Jilin this morning for Liaoning. He will briefly stay and then return to Ryojun to assume his next position. Regarding the Wanbaoshan case, we are maintaining a calm attitude, but Japanese newspapers are carrying out vicious propaganda. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Wanbaoshan incident occurred, the whole country was filled with indignation, and the Japanese not only did not repent, but instead intensified their actions, aiding the Koreans in atrocities and shooting Chinese people. The Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters telegraphed the Central Government on the 6th, requesting a serious protest and issuing a circular to the whole country to rise up in unison. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) All Chinese newspapers here have expressed indignation regarding the Wanbaoshan case and the Korean anti-Chinese riots, saying that this may stem from Japan's policy of armed aggression in the three northeastern provinces, and the future of the three northeastern provinces is now in great danger. The Tianjin and Beiping Party Headquarters have telegraphed the Central Government, requesting a protest to Japan. The public has not yet shown signs of intense anger regarding this matter. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The conflict between Korean farmers in Wanbaoshan, Jilin, is serious. The Japanese consul stationed in Jilin went to the provincial government on the 5th, demanding compensation for the losses of the Korean farmers and immediate reconciliation, which was rejected. We demanded the withdrawal of the police and punishment of the perpetrators, as the Japanese police opened fire first. More than 100 Japanese soldiers in Wanbaoshan occupied civilian residences, all ferries on the Yitong River were seized, trenches were dug for several miles, and landmines were buried, filled with an atmosphere of war. (Central News Agency Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A riot occurred in Pyongyang, northwestern Korea, at night, with 29 Chinese dead and 130 seriously injured. Three Japanese police officers were also seriously injured. The chaos began at 9 p.m. last night and ended at 4 a.m. this morning. Koreans destroyed more than 100 Chinese houses, dragged unfortunate Chinese people into the streets, and massacred 30 people and seriously injured 130. Only those who sought refuge in the police station during the chaos were spared injury. After the riot broke out, the police and firefighters were dispatched to restore order, and more than 100 Koreans were arrested, but 5,000 Koreans continued to attack Chinese people. It was not until seven hours later that the situation gradually calmed down. It is heard that the military authorities, to prevent the recurrence of riots, have ordered the army to prepare to assist the police when necessary. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The headquarters of the Military Police received a telegram from the Korean government, confirming that 20 Chinese people died and more than 300 were injured in the Pyongyang riot. (Korean military authorities are currently discussing with the civilian authorities on ways to protect overseas Chinese within the territory. Jemulpo is now peaceful, but 200 Koreans in Inzan attacked overseas Chinese last night. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news obtained by the newspaper, anti-Chinese riots have occurred in major cities and towns in Korea, and people's hearts are greatly disturbed. Commercial activities in Seoul and Pyongyang have completely stopped because the checks and drafts between China and Korea have all been stopped. The Chinese consulate in Seoul is now sheltering more than 4,000 Chinese people who have taken refuge. The Chinese ambassador to Japan went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning to request measures to protect overseas Chinese in Korea. According to official reports, a total of 37 Chinese people died and 93 were injured in the Pyongyang riot. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Political circles here are deeply saddened by the anti-Chinese riots in Korea and fear that they will cause a major disaster. It is estimated that more than 500,000 Koreans are scattered throughout Manchuria and Mongolia. If the Chinese public is angered and takes retaliatory action, the Chinese authorities will find it difficult to protect them, and the Japanese side will have no way to cover them, which may lead to a major incident. According to recent news, the anti-Chinese actions of the Koreans in Pyongyang were very well planned. Their leaders had detailed maps marking the residences of Chinese people, and they followed the maps to carry out attacks. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Pyongyang: Due to the Wanbaoshan incident, the attitude of Koreans towards Chinese people has gradually deteriorated. The situation became dangerous on the night of the 4th. Although the police made every effort to be vigilant, at 5 p.m. on the 5th, groups of 200 to 300 Koreans gathered in various places to attack Chinese shops, large and small, in Pyongyang, destroying everything they encountered. By 9 p.m., the rioters had gathered 5,000 to 6,000 people, and their actions had completely turned into a riot. Divided into more than ten teams, all Chinese houses in Pyongyang were destroyed, and the situation became increasingly dangerous. Although the police department was fully mobilized and worked hard to be vigilant, the riot area was too wide and there was nothing they could do. Except for those who took refuge in the police station, all Chinese people were brutally killed or seriously injured. As of 4 a.m. this morning, according to the police station's investigation, 28 Chinese men and one woman have been identified as dead, and 150 have been injured. More than 100 rioters have also been reported. The rioters gradually dispersed at 5 a.m. this morning, but the city looked like a battlefield, and people's hearts were very shaken. When the riot occurred in the city, more than 1,000 Korean rioters also invaded Chinese rural villages in the suburbs. Many Chinese people were killed or injured. Because the investigation has not been completed, the details are unknown. (Dentsu Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Pyongyang: At 2 p.m. today, 300 Koreans gathered at the Taian Foreign Company, a Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Ximen, Pyongyang, and set fire to it, causing a major conflict with the police and firefighters who were suppressing them. (Dentsu Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Pyongyang: The Korean riots against overseas Chinese are still expanding. The Japanese authorities initially decided not to mobilize troops, but now they have changed their policy. At 10 a.m. this morning, five platoons of the 77th Infantry Regiment stationed in Pyongyang were deployed to various locations to be on guard. If the riots continue, martial law may be imposed. (Dentsu Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Seoul: According to investigations as of 6 a.m. this morning, 37 Chinese people died, 57 were seriously injured, and 141 were slightly injured in the Pyongyang incident. 800 people have been taken into the police station. The barracks of the 77th Infantry Regiment have been used as shelters. Officials are now doing their best to protect Chinese people and prevent the recurrence of violence. (Dentsu Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Seoul: Although the police station in Gyeongseong is seriously guarded, the atmosphere between Chinese and Koreans is becoming increasingly dangerous. The authorities have begun to notify representatives of various streets that, starting from dusk on the 5th, citizens are not allowed to go out unless absolutely necessary. At the same time, ropes have been used to enclose the entrances to Huajie and Xixiaomen Street, prohibiting Koreans from passing through. The police are working hard to protect Chinese people, so it is currently stable and there will be no recurrence of the events of the night of the 4th. (Dentsu Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Kaiyuan: The conflict between Chinese and Koreans that occurred in Gyeongseong and Incheon on the night of the 4th has spread to Kaiyuan. In the late night of the 4th and the early morning of the 5th, dozens of Korean people attacked Chinese villages, and both sides suffered casualties. 30 Chinese people are still being protected by the Kaiyuan Police Station. (Dentsu Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Wang Rongbao visited Mr. Tani, Director of the Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at noon today, regarding the atrocities of Koreans in Pyongyang and other parts of Korea, and requested that they be suppressed as soon as possible. Mr. Tani replied that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instructed the Governor-General of Korea to quickly stop the Korean riots and asked to wait patiently for a few days. Ambassador Wang left at 12:30 p.m. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will wait to receive detailed news and discuss follow-up matters with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Dentsu Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ugaki, the new Governor-General of Korea, said regarding the current anti-Chinese trend in Korea, "I am extremely regretful about the occurrence of the Pyongyang incident. Recently, Sino-Japanese relations have deteriorated slightly, so the Wanbaoshan incident was the motivation for it to break out, thus tending to emotional behavior, which is very inappropriate for Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. I hope to deal with it calmly. Chief Administrator Imai and Police Bureau Director Ikeda will arrive tomorrow, and they will surely take appropriate measures." (Dentsu Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>Meeting of the Standing Committee and Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Group of the Political Council Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Standing Committee held a discussion meeting at 3 p.m. on the afternoon of the 6th in the Central Conference Hall. Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong, and the ministers and secretaries of the various central departments attended, and it was decided to convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the National Congress Review Meeting at 3 p.m. on the 7th, among other matters. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The meeting of the Foreign Affairs Group of the Political Council last week was not held because many members were not in the capital. It is now scheduled to be held at the Central Party Headquarters at 5 p.m. on the 7th, and notices have been issued. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>The Political Council Will Establish an Administrative Regulations Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Yongbin said that Dai Jitao and Shao Yuanchong originally intended to establish an Administrative Regulations Committee in the Examination Yuan to organize the regulations of previous years. After being passed by the Yuan Affairs Conference, it was submitted to the Central Political Council for review.

<h3>Re-discussing the Wanbaoshan Case</h3>
<p>The Wanbaoshan case has developed into such a major situation. How to negotiate in the future is a matter of extreme concern to our people. Upon investigation, the Korean people came here with a waste contract that had not been approved or filed, and had not obtained the consent of most landowners, and only colluded with a few people to privately agree. They forcibly dug up paddy fields. The Chinese farmers, in their right of self-defense, rose up and automatically filled them. The responsibility for causing the incident is clearly attributed. This is the first point that should be paid close attention to. The Japanese police used the name of protection to help the Korean farmers illegally reclaim and dig in the front, and then united with the Japanese army to attack our Chinese farmers in the back. Our armed police rushed to mediate and were also besieged, causing significant losses to our farmers and police. The attribution of this responsibility is also very clear. This is the second point that should be paid attention to by our people. Throughout Korea, under the name of assisting Wanbaoshan, anti-Chinese trends have been discovered everywhere. Chinese families in Pyongyang, Incheon, Kaesong, and other places have been almost completely destroyed, with countless deaths and injuries. The situation is still dangerous. Who is responsible for dereliction of duty in protecting overseas Chinese if not its government? The overseas Chinese have suffered such heavy losses. How can they be compensated? This is the third point that should be paid close attention to by our people.</p>
<p>The Wanbaoshan case and the Korean anti-Chinese incident are one issue, but they are actually two separate matters. The main causes are in different places, and they were all caused by the government's connivance. The Korean people's migration to our eastern provinces is actually the vanguard of Japan's colonial policy. Therefore, in recent years, the Korean people who have come to the East to reclaim and plant paddy fields have been organized by Korean people to form agricultural companies on the one hand, and Japanese people have established loan bureaus to lend capital to Korean farmers on the other hand. As a result, Korean farmers collude with local villains, or steal and sell other people's fields, or first induce leases and then forcibly occupy them. I do not know how many disputes, brawls, and lawsuits have been caused by such illegal means. The Korean people are fearless and their courage is growing. This has led to the major case of Wanbaoshan. Furthermore, from the perspective of Korea, the Korean people are jealous of our overseas Chinese for taking away their industrial and commercial livelihoods, and they have long harbored the intention of expelling our overseas Chinese. Their government has also set various harsh precedents to oppress our overseas Chinese, or detained them on the pretext of incomplete residence permit procedures, or ordered them to leave the country on the pretext of unpaid taxes. The overseas Chinese have long been in a dilemma. The Korean people, relying on the support of the government, have become more and more emboldened and have repeatedly been eager to try. Today's riot, although under the name of assisting the Korean people of Wanbaoshan, is actually just to achieve their goal of expelling our overseas Chinese. Therefore, these two problems have a superficial connection, but in reality, they each have a fundamental cause that has been brewing, and they are not sudden problems. Therefore, in this negotiation, if it is not resolved at the location of its symptoms, I am afraid that the storm will not be easy to quell.</p>

(Special dispatch, 6th) Important Foreign Telegraphs Contents of the Temporary Agreement on US-France Debt Suspension Negotiations The US Secretary of the Treasury Telegraphed to Have Buddhist Reports Using Goods to Pay Compensation Violates the Original Agreement The US Government Responds to Mellon's Instructions to Continue Negotiations Germany Declares It Will Never Use War Debts for Armaments Reuters, Paris, 5th The final agreement between France and the United States regarding President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debt payments is expected to be reached on July 6. Last night, representatives from both sides met at the Ministry of Interior and reached a temporary agreement. This morning, a telegraph was sent to President Hoover reporting the contents. The temporary agreement is as follows: (1) Germany must make up the payment within ten years; (2) Central and Eastern European countries may be assisted by banks if necessary; (3) The temporary continuation of using goods to offset compensation will be discussed by Germany and its European creditors; (4) The issue of guarantee funds will be resolved by France and other European creditors; (5) France's request for Germany to provide political guarantees is a matter for France to handle directly with Germany. Based on the above points, it seems that the points raised by US Treasury Secretary Mellon in the memorandum submitted to French Prime Minister Laval before the French Cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon have been fully resolved through the meeting last night. Since the principle has been decided, a meeting must be convened to discuss the necessary revisions to the Young Plan, especially the issue of guarantee funds. There are two possible forms for the meeting: an intergovernmental meeting held in London or a meeting of experts held in Paris. The latter is more likely to be realized. It is expected that this matter can be clearly resolved. Reuters, Washington, 5th According to reliable sources, the US government has instructed Mellon, who is currently in Paris discussing President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debt payments with France, to declare to France that its position regarding Germany's continued payment of goods to offset compensation is unsatisfactory. President Hoover's original proposal included compensation in goods, so experts cannot be given free rein to handle this matter. Reuters, Baltimore, 5th Maryland Governor Ritchie delivered a speech on Independence Day, broadcast nationwide via radio, stating that if President Hoover's proposal is accepted, the foreign debt payments under the Young Plan will never be restored. One year is insufficient, and the suspension will inevitably be extended. After that, the war debt issue will be thoroughly reorganized. Reuters, Washington, 5th The US government has received a promise from Germany that it will not use the opportunity of suspending war debt payments to increase armaments. Reuters, Berlin, 5th As a result of the inconclusive negotiations in Paris, Germany now faces a greater fear of bankruptcy than when President Hoover first proposed the suspension of payments. The administrative council of the German National Bank held a special meeting today to discuss reserves. The current amount is not far from the statutory 40% and the minimum limit. A message was then issued stating that the National Bank can reduce its reserves below 40% in special circumstances and restrict lending. This is likely a trial balloon, and the resolution has not yet been officially announced. Soviet Industrial Development Production Increases by 45% Six Major New Changes in Industry Elimination of Domestic Unemployment Increased Worker Knowledge Advancement of Work Organization Training of Industrial Talents Correction of Obsolete Elements Self-Sufficiency in Various Industries National News Agency, Moscow, 5th Today, leading figures in Soviet industrial development gathered here for a meeting. Stalin gave a speech, stating that in the first five months of this year, the production of various industries in the country has increased by 40% to 50%, while some have increased by 20% to 30%. However, the production of coal and iron has not increased significantly, with coal increasing by 6% and iron by 10%. The reason is that the state of Soviet industrial development last year has undergone fundamental changes, and the new methods required have not yet been adopted by industrial leaders, which is a major reason for the failure to fully develop. Regarding various new changes, Stalin said they can be divided into six categories: First, the elimination of domestic unemployment. Workers no longer need to request work from factories, and rural poverty has also been reduced. Villagers no longer need to flock to cities to find food. Therefore, factories can no longer allow workers to join freely and must recruit workers in an organized manner, and heavy work must be mechanized. Second, factory workers should not be transferred excessively, and the roughness, lightness, and heaviness of work should not be given the same wages. Wages should be based on the quality of work, not the need for work. Therefore, efforts should be made to improve the quality and knowledge of workers. Third, the organization of work must be reformed. Each worker should be assigned to a fixed machine, and one person should be fully responsible for the function and production of that machine. Fourth, more engineering technicians and industrial leaders should be trained to guide and supervise the progress of various industries. This is not only true in Moscow and Leningrad but should be made universal throughout the country. Fifth, the attitude towards the old knowledge class in industry should be corrected. In the past, these workers were bent on sabotage. Later, various methods were used to punish their sabotage and reward their effectiveness. Therefore, they have gradually become virtuous and fearful, changing their past faces. Therefore, today's new attitude is to encourage their work and meet their needs. Sixth, all work should be thoroughly commercialized. In the past, the state spent tens of millions of rubles to build various large industries in the country. Now the situation is completely different, and various industries must be self-sufficient and able to accumulate funds. Spanish Strike Wave Communists Seize the Opportunity to Incite Revolution National Panic Reuters, Madrid, 6th The fervor of strikes is now spreading throughout Spain. This is due to the nationwide trade union of the Communist Party inciting labor unrest in the hope of starting a revolution. Telephone workers across the country went on strike today, and there were general strikes in Cordoba and Corunna. The cause of the general strike in Corunna was simply that the masses opposed the police preventing them from setting fire to a monastery. In Barcelona, many unemployed people broke into hotels demanding food. The hotel owners provided food and drink while telegraphing the police for protection. A lottery shop was attacked by the mob, who robbed 10,000 pesetas. Farmers in Andalusia are forced to hire people they do not want at three times the price and are not allowed to use machines for farming in order to accommodate the unemployed. Therefore, farmers will be unable to sustain themselves. The people of the country are in a state of panic. However, Republican mayors are now urgently correcting street names that contain imperialistic sentiments. The International Work Handled Over the Past Year Ready to Be Submitted to the September League of Nations General Assembly National News Agency, Geneva, 5th Today, the Secretariat of the League of Nations announced that the international work of the past year will be completed between July and August to be submitted to the General Assembly in September. It is expected that several of the most important tasks can be completed within this month. One is an international conference to restrict the manufacture of poisons, aiming to meet the actual needs of the world's medical science. Although there are conflicts of interest among the countries concerned, the League of Nations still expects to negotiate concrete results and draft an international convention. Another is the International Women's Committee conference discussing the nationality of women who marry foreigners, which is expected to be completed this month. The committee is entirely organized by women, which is a first in the history of the League of Nations. The third is the plenary adjustment committee meeting of the preparatory committee for the European Federation plan. This meeting is even more important than the previous two meetings and is expected to reach a final result in August, which will be submitted to the League of Nations Council and the General Assembly of the European Federation Plan preparatory committee in September. The discussions will all be about various plans to save the European economic crisis. The Rift Between Italy's Government and the Church Becomes More Apparent The Pope Issues a Circular to the Outside World Accusing the Fascist Party of Violating Faith Reuters, Rome, 6th On Saturday and Sunday, the Pope issued a circular. Although it did not mention Mussolini by name, it referred entirely to the Italian Prime Minister and accused the Fascist Party's oath of violating faith and fairness. From a religious and humanitarian standpoint, it is illegal. The circular defended in detail the Catholic action agencies that Mussolini had recently cracked down on, stating that the Italian authorities' accusations against these agencies were purely a pretext to alienate young people from the Church. The Fascist Party took a cold view of the contents of the circular, but the Pope's method of issuing this circular has deepened the rift between the government and the church. It is expected that if Italian Prime Minister Mussolini issues a response, the split will become even more apparent. It has been reported that the Pope's circular was handed to an American clergyman the day before its publication, who took it to Paris and handed it to the American news agency for publication. The German Foreign Minister's Monument Unveiled National News Agency, Mainz, 6th The monument to the late German Foreign Minister Stresemann was unveiled today. People from all over the country came to attend the ceremony, and the roads were filled with traffic. Special trains carrying guests arrived throughout the night. In addition, there were tens of thousands of people arriving by water and land, including representatives from foreign heads of state and foreign ministers, as well as representatives from various German states and political parties. Even leaders who disagreed with Stresemann's political views attended the ceremony to pay their final respects. The Future of Japan's New Proletarian Party Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 6th The National Labor-Farmer Masses Party has completed its formation ceremony after great waves, but it still faces many difficulties in the future: (1) The problem of the far-right Japan Labor Club; (2) The frontal conflict between the National Labor Union Federation and the General Council of Trade Unions; (3) Differences of opinion between the National Labor Union Federation and the Party Headquarters. The attitude that the National Labor Union Federation, which has the greatest influence in the new party, will take towards the headquarters in the future will have a significant impact on the future of the new party. In addition, because the General Council of Trade Unions was absent from the joint conference, the labor union relationship has not been obtained at all, which has cast a shadow on the future of the new party. Biderman Talks About His Impressions of Touring China Reuters, Manila, 6th Biderman arrived here today and spoke about the assistance and preferential treatment he received and the talent of Finance Minister Song. He then described the current situation in China, saying that it is currently in a very difficult situation. There are three things that hinder China's progress: (1) political unrest; (2) inconvenient transportation; (3) a flawed monetary system. However, once the monetary system is reformed, the other two problems can be easily solved. Its internal strife is mostly due to economic disorder, and inconvenient transportation is the main reason, which affects the lives of people throughout the country. A flawed monetary system makes it impossible to carry out and effectively manage various projects. Therefore, China's future development lies in improving the monetary system, which will increase tax revenue and stabilize investment. If there are adequate guarantees, many foreigners are willing to invest in China. Biderman plans to stay in the Philippines for two weeks to investigate everything. A Special Discussion on the Review and Prospects of the Pacific International Academic Conference (Continued) Bin Naval competition. Depends entirely on naval armaments. Thus, England, the United States, Japan, Italy, and France are all actively manufacturing warships and expanding naval armaments, creating a situation of naval competition. Currently, the English and Japanese Asian fleets stationed in the Pacific Ocean in India have one 10,000-ton new cruiser and two 7,700-ton new cruisers, as well as several gunboats. Those stationed in Singapore, Hong Kong, and China have a total of five of the latest 50,000-ton armored cruisers and one slightly older ship in addition to gunboats. Counting 3,800 tons, there is also a small fleet flagship of 1,800 tons, eight destroyers of 1,100 tons, six submarines of 1,600 tons newly built in 1929, one mine search boat, and one aircraft carrier carrying 20 aircraft. Due to Japan's opposition, the United States has a small fleet stationed in the Far East. In addition to a very small number of gunboats stationed on the inland rivers of China, it only has one old cruiser with weak combat power stationed in Asia. As for Japan, the warships currently serving in the military that can be dispatched at any time include seven large battleships, three aircraft carriers, four 7,200-ton armored cruisers, five 5,700-ton cruisers, one 3,500-ton cruiser, 70 to 80 destroyers, and 30 to 40 submarines. Among them, except for the large battleships, the rest are the latest warships. Judging from this situation alone, the preparations of England, the United States, and Japan to compete for the Pacific with their navies can be seen at a glance. In the current situation, the division of spheres of influence in the Pacific roughly belongs to England in the southwest, the United States in the northeast, Japan in the north of the equator along the Sea of Japan, and no one in the southeast. However, this balance of power is difficult to maintain forever. The China problem is the core of the Pacific problem. Any local change in China will be followed by disturbances in the Pacific. Even a slight trigger is enough to shake the entire situation. Today, the Pacific is not just a simple geographical term. It is the center of gravity for the mutual chains and mutual attacks of the imperialist powers in modern times. This is why the Pacific will be the greatest era in ancient and modern times. In order to ease the competitive situation in the Pacific, the imperialists have also put on a mask of peace, using their own national interests as a background to hold various conferences and make various compromises in the style of sharing spoils. Thus, the so-called Three-Nation Naval Conference, the Non-War Pact, the London Naval Conference, and the International Arms Reduction Preparatory Conference came into being. At the same time, the Pacific International Academic Conference described in this article was also produced because people from various countries realized the seriousness of the situation in the Pacific and sought mutual understanding among countries, thereby reducing the risk of a second world war from a passive perspective. (To be continued) Senior Examination Officials Take Office Dai, Chen, Shao, and Others Take the Oath Simultaneously Lian, Qian, and Others Also Take the Oath of Office Dai Chuanxian, Chief Examiner and Chairman of the Senior Examination, Chen Daqi, Secretary-General of the Senior Examination Committee, and Senior Examination Committee Members Dai Xiujun, Chen Changheng, Zhang Mojun, Huang Musong, Chen Daqi, Xie Jian, Rao Yan, Hu Cishan, Huang Xuyuan, Jiao Yitang, Huang Zhenqing, Liu Guanghua, Mao Guangsheng, Senior Examination Supervising Committee Members Liu Jiping, Zhou Lisheng, Yu Hongqi, Gao Yihan, Yao Yuping, Tian Jiongjin, Luo Jiefu, Yue Jingtao, Director of the Senior Examination Assistance Office Shao Yuan Chong, Deputy Director Wang Yongbin, Secretary-General Shen Shiyuan, Guard Commander Wu Siyu, Health Officer Hu Ding, Acting Railway Minister Lian Sheng Hai, Political Deputy Minister Qian Zongze, Director of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Office Xu Jingzhi, and others held an oath-taking ceremony at the National Government Premier Memorial Week on the morning of the 6th. Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Shao Lizi, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Zhengting, Liu Shangqing, and representatives from various agencies, numbering hundreds of people, attended. Chairman Yu Youren presided over the ceremony. First, the seal-giving ceremony was held. Chairman Yu Youren presented the seals, and Dai Chuanxian, Shao Yuan Chong, and Lian Sheng Hai received the seals in turn. Member of the Central Committee Ding Weifen supervised the oath-taking, and all oath-takers raised their right hands to take the oath. After the oath, supervisor Ding Weifen delivered a speech, stating that since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the first senior examination, based on the Premier's teachings, formulated examination regulations, selected true talents, and prepared them for national use. Comrade Dai and other committee members have excellent academic knowledge and experience and will surely achieve good results. Comrade Lian has rich experience in railway construction and will be able to follow the resolutions of the National Assembly after taking office and complete the projects of the Yuehan, Longhai, and Pingsui lines in order to satisfy the wishes of the people. Next, Chairman Yu Youren delivered a speech, stating that Dean Dai is a well-known scholar, and his spirit of not shirking hard work can serve as a model for administrative personnel. He hopes that he can use his own experience to achieve good results, so that scholars across the country can embark on a bright and upright path and devote themselves to the country and society. Next, Dai Chuanxian replied, saying that he feels that his academic knowledge and experience are insufficient, but he will strive to follow the Premier's teachings, strictly adhere to the oath, and diligently work hard to live up to his duties, as instructed by the Central Committee representative chairman. Finally, Shao Yuan Chong, Lian Sheng Hai, Qian Zongze, and Xu Jingzhi gave their replies in succession. The ceremony concluded with music and photography. Central and National Government Memorial Week Shao Lizi Reports on the Significance of the Fourth National Congress Dai Chuanxian Lectures on the Examination System Problem Central Party Headquarters At 9:00 AM on the 6th, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week. Members Ding Weifen, Shao Lizi, Fang Juehui, Miao Peicheng, and others, as well as all staff and guests, numbering about 600 people, attended. Ding Weifen presided over the ceremony, and Shao Lizi reported that the Fourth National Congress has been decided by the Central Committee to be held on October 10th. The important work is, on the one hand, to implement the resolutions of the National Assembly, and on the other hand, to prepare for the work that should be done after the Fourth National Congress. There are many important resolutions in the National Assembly resolutions. The most important ones are the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China During the Period of Political Tutelage, the Plan for the Procedures for Industrial Construction and the New Trends in Educational Facilities, and the Plan for the Suppression of the Red Bandits. The Provisional Constitution is to be jointly observed by all party members and the people. The new trends in industrial construction and educational facilities are also to be jointly implemented by all party members and the people. Regarding the suppression of the Red Bandits, all party members and the people must work together. Commander-in-Chief Chiang has already gone to the front to urge the suppression of the Red Army. Before leaving, he issued a declaration, saying very solemnly that he and the soldiers will live and die together and fight the Red Bandits for survival. Everyone is paying close attention to the situation of suppressing the bandits in Jiangxi. Commander-in-Chief Chiang has made thorough preparations and meticulous plans for this bandit suppression. I believe that the Red Bandits can definitely be eliminated. Although the good news is a bit late, there will definitely be better news. Even the Guangdong side, which is undermining unification, will not dare to commit such a great wrong to the world when we are working hard to suppress the bandits. What we need to pay attention to now is what Comrade Yu Youren said at the National Government Memorial Week last time: "When comrades in the front are working hard to suppress the bandits, comrades in the rear must not create opportunities for the Red Bandits." The original intention of this sentence is that if the comrades in the rear do not work hard, it is tantamount to creating opportunities for the Communist bandits. Comrades, you should especially understand this sentence. To go a step further, even if the Red Bandits are completely eliminated, comrades cannot say that our party has succeeded. Comrade Cheng Tianfang said in a speech in Jiangxi, "Ten years ago, there were no Red Bandits. Why did our party have to reorganize?" We must always recognize whether the people are sincerely convinced and believe in us. This is what we should always strive for. As for the direction of our efforts, I think the first is to work sincerely, and the second is to endure hardship and be able to endure hard work. However, we should not show a special face, harbor a special mentality, or think that we have a special position. We must show a kind and humble spirit to the people. If we can do this, then we can believe that the suppression of the Red Bandits will not be a problem, and the completion of the National Revolution will not be a problem. According to the regulations, the Party Congress is supposed to be convened every two years. If there are special circumstances, it can be extended. Now, the Fifth Plenary Session has decided to hold the Fourth National Congress on October 10th of this year and will not postpone it. This is enough to show the significance of the Central Committee convening the Fourth National Congress. However, the future of the Fourth National Congress depends on the joint efforts of comrades. How to prepare for important work and how to complete the new concrete plan resolved by the National Assembly all depend on the efforts of comrades. Everyone must recognize that the Fourth National Congress is a major turning point for our party to carry on the past and open up the future. In the future, uniting our party's historical comrades, concentrating the talents of the entire party, and unifying the strength of our party all require comrades to pay special attention before the meeting. Secondly, there is a smaller issue, which is the corruption incident in the election of executive and supervisory committee members of the Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters. It was raised for discussion in the last Standing Committee meeting and has now been handed over to the Supervisory Committee for handling. I now have a point of view on this matter and do not hope that the Supervisory Committee will be affected by my views. I do not feel any hatred for this matter. Generally speaking, those who commit crimes in society are either uneducated or under economic pressure. However, the people who committed the crime of electoral corruption this time did not have this general cause of crime. Party work is originally an obligation and not a right, but those who engaged in corruption at that time may have mistakenly believed that party work is a right and hoped to reflect on it. The election of our party should not have the drawbacks of parliamentary elections. Even if it cannot be avoided, we should think of ways to eliminate it. Fundamentally, it is necessary for our party comrades to recognize that party work is an obligation and not a right, etc. The meeting adjourned at about 10:00 AM. National Government On the morning of the same day at 10:00 AM, the National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week. Heads of various Yuan, Ministries, and Committees Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuan Chong, Wang Zhengting, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Shangqing, Ru Yuli, Lian Sheng Hai, etc., and more than 300 staff and guests attended. Dean Dai led the ceremony and gave a lecture on the theory and implementation of the examination system, stating that the examination is the foundation of the Five-Power Constitution. Ancient politics had only one administrative power, and all government affairs were promoted by this one force. Later, due to cultural progress, there was a gradual trend of division. In China, because of the importance of employing people, the examination and supervision powers were separated from the administrative power. The examination manages the employment of personnel, and the supervision manages the personnel after employment. In the West, because of the importance of the rule of law, the legislative and judicial powers were derived from the administrative power. The legislature formulates laws, and the judiciary exercises them. However, both have their shortcomings and are not perfect systems. Our Five-Power Constitution is a perfect system created by the Premier by combining the strengths of both. When the National Government was first established in Guangdong, because the jurisdiction was not wide, it focused its full efforts on military affairs and failed to fully implement it. Since establishing the capital in Nanjing, we have fully complied with the Five-Power Constitution and organized the National Government. The examination system was formally established. The Premier's theory on the examination is that the examination can make up for the deficiencies of elections and relieve the poverty of elections. Secondly, all personnel must be employed after passing the central examination, and it is also stipulated that personnel who have passed the examination by the government shall be appointed to prepare for local autonomy. These are all seen in the Outline of National Construction and should be stipulated in the system. Most European and Western countries used to have restricted elections, but now they have progressed to universal suffrage. The so-called restricted election means that there are property or intellectual restrictions on the electorate. There are no restrictions on the candidates. The Premier believes that the methods in Europe in the past and present are not good. He advocates universal suffrage, but there must be restrictions on the candidates, who must pass the examination. Because according to the theory of dividing powers and abilities, only in this way can the purpose of national consolidation and people's well-being be achieved. The National Government is based on the Premier's theory in everything, and the implementation of the examination system is of course no exception. However, if we only focus on the examination itself, the results will be minimal, because the examination is related to education and all kinds of government affairs. If education is good, there will be no wasted talents. If encouragement is given in the right way, there will be no depressed scholars. If appointments are made properly, there will be no lucky opportunists. This is an explanation of the relationship between the examination and other parties. On the other hand, the examination can also promote the progress of various government affairs and the development of education and academics. The theory and methods of the examination system, whether Chinese or foreign, are not perfect and can only be used as a reference for us and cannot be fully adopted. We can only adopt the strengths of both and formulate methods. Although this work is difficult, we must do our best. The Premier once said that the best method is to find it from the facts. I hope that the entire Party and government will help us in all aspects so that this first examination will not only achieve good results but also obtain good methods to complete the operation of our Five-Power Constitution. The ceremony adjourned shortly afterward. The Sino-French Expedition Team Continues to Move Forward A Review of the Formation of the Team The French Call It the Yellow Race Patrol Team Chu Telegraphed That Buan Was Extremely Cordial The French Embassy Sent a Letter Stating That China and France Are Harmonious The Sino-French Northwest Expedition Team dispute, the French side's barbarous and violent acts, aroused national indignation. A reporter from the Daily News learned from a certain gentleman yesterday the process of the formation of the team, which is mostly unknown to the outside world. Tracing the reasons, there is much room for research. Here, we specially trace and record the French side's intentions. That gentleman said that the Sino-French Northwest Expedition Team was proposed by the French side to the Ministry of Education in early (18th year). At that time, the Ministry of Education believed that this matter was of great importance and invited the military, political, staff, internal affairs, foreign affairs, and other departments, as well as the Academia Sinica, to discuss whether to cooperate. At that time, the representatives argued that our country was currently conducting inspections in the Northwest with other countries in the same</h3>

<p>Business News</p>
<p>Financial Tides and Waves, Highly Dramatic</p>
<p>A Surge of Ten Taels and Seven Mace</p>
<p>Heavy Breakout Above Seven Hundred and Ten Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold price experienced both sharp declines and subsequent rises, exhibiting unpredictable changes, with potential dangers lurking within. The fluctuations were notably intense, with a total turnover of fifteen or sixteen taels from beginning to end. Ultimately, a significant surge of over ten taels occurred, stabilizing public sentiment. This was likely due to the slight dip in the silver market, which was not affected by the news that France might reach an amicable agreement regarding German debts. This led to a low opening, briefly breaching the 700-tael mark. However, strong buying interest then emerged, coupled with tension in both domestic and international foreign exchange markets. Consequently, the price rapidly climbed, swiftly surpassing 710 taels. Banks demonstrated strong interest in purchasing British gold. At noon, due to active selling positions on the trading floor, a sharp decline was observed. The market initially remained stable, but trading was sluggish. It was reported that new wooden railings were installed in the market, and non-professional personnel were hired as inspectors. Those without trading permits were not allowed to enter, sparking strong opposition from brokers, who questioned a certain director, leading to disputes and temporary disruption of order. This inevitably affected trading. Towards the end, rising exchange rates and aggressive buying interest led to a bullish sentiment, pushing the price above 710 taels once again. It is anticipated that there will be a further decline in major transactions this morning.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Sees a Fall Below the 700-Tael Mark</p>
<p>Starting from the opening of trading in August, a decline of five taels was immediately observed, settling at 698.5 taels. According to telegraphic news from the previous day, major transactions only experienced a decline of one-sixteenth, with little market for silver prices. Additionally, large investors engaged in selling activities. However, buying interest surged momentarily, with companies like Qian Changxiang, Bing Xing, Tong Taichang, and Yuan Xingyong actively purchasing. This was due to exchange rates consuming British gold from 1425 to 125, resulting in a surge of over twelve taels, reaching 711 taels. Even then, many sellers remained, causing a retreat to 706 taels. When the prime rate was announced, it stood at 97.5 taels, with the listed price shrinking by 25, American dollars by 50 cents, and Japanese gold increasing by 2.5 fen, then rising to 9.5 taels, with fluctuations of two taels up or down. The price retreated to 707 taels. Suddenly, companies like Fuyu, Yuantai, and Zhifengyong entered the market again, with Cuichangyong also purchasing. Within just over twenty minutes, the price rose by three taels, reaching 710 taels at 10:00 AM. Subsequently, Yuan Maoyong, Da Xingyong, Yongfeng, and the Dalian gang engaged in selling, leading to a five-tael plunge, reaching 705 taels at 10:50 AM. However, there were occasional fluctuations of over two taels. After intervals of five to six minutes, the price rose again to 709.5 taels, with Zhifengyong and Wanxing purchasing. Thereafter, the price fluctuated up and down irregularly, reaching from 706 taels to 708.5 taels. The price began to decline at 11:30 AM, as Hengxing maintained strong selling intentions. Public sentiment faltered, leading to a three-tael decline, settling at 705.5 taels. The market closed at 705.8 mace at noon, then further declined to over four taels. It was rumored that Indian exchange rates were low, and banks continued to consume 125, causing the prime rate to soar. The calculation was 708 taels, with the announced price revised to 739.8 mace, a difference of about 30 taels.</p>
<p>Various Firms Compete to Purchase, Entering a Favorable Situation</p>
<p>The aftermarket opened at 707.5 taels, with retail investors buying, pushing the price to 709 taels. Subsequently, it declined by two taels, settling at 707 taels. Generally, retail investors were selling off. However, the telegraphic news from India was mediocre. Later, Dadecheng and Yuan Maoyong engaged in buying activities, leading to a price of 709.7 mace at 3:20 PM. However, the trading volume was limited, primarily due to disputes arising from the use of market certificates. Shortly after, there was a slight decrease of over one tael, until around 4:00 PM, when exchange rate trends became particularly tight. Fellow traders intended to cover their short positions. It was estimated that British gold only settled at 14, while 13.9375 was the rate. Companies like Bingxing, Xuchang, and Zhifengyong competed to purchase bonds, greatly invigorating the market. There was a sense of an imminent leap of a thousand zhang (Chinese unit of measurement), with a sharp increase of six taels. The market closed at 714.2 mace at 4:30 PM, a surge of 10.7 mace compared to the end of last week. Later, transactions were made at 714-715 taels. The highest price throughout the day was 714.2 taels, and the lowest was 698.5 taels (according to the listed price), a total swing of 15.7 mace. The opening price for physical goods was 98 taels, closing at 708 taels in the morning and 708 taels in the afternoon, with the market closing at 714.5 taels. The disclosed price shrank by 31-32 taels to 25-26 taels. Before logging, the opening prices were 709 taels and 706 taels, and the closing prices were 717 taels and 714 taels. Before water compensation, the opening price was 709 taels, and the closing price was 717 taels.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Gang Absorbed Over a Thousand Ingots</p>
<p>Regarding physical goods, the Tianjin gang purchased over a thousand taels of bullion from Yingfengheng and others, at a premium of 15 taels compared to the benchmark price. However, inventory levels were low. If large investors engage in purchasing, prices might rise without falling. Trading volume for each firm was: Cuichangyong, Qianchangxiang - initial selling followed by buying. Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Yuanxiang, Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Yuantai, Dakang - all buyers. Yongfeng, Hengyu, Daxingyong, Futaixiang, Yuancheng Yong, Dingchang, etc. - frequent buying and selling. Yuan Maoyong - more selling than buying. Hengxing sold one thousand ingots. Yu Da, Yuan Xingyong, Shunli, and Wanxing all sold. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, and Yuan Maoyong sought more than they supplied. Tong Taichang, Bingxing, and Juchang all bought. Wanxing, Shunli, and Yuantai all sold. Futaiheng, Hengyu, Huixiang, and Senchangyong had occasional buying and selling. Speculative firms all sold, seeking to acquire British gold. The Dalian gang sold a total of three thousand ingots and bought back one thousand several hundred ingots. The Guangdong gang sold a total of one thousand ingots, according to reports.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Markets Tight, Both Openly and Covertly</p>

British gold shrank by 25, now standing at one shilling three pence eight seven five. American dollars by 50 cents, now standing at 32 yuan 125. Japanese gold increased by 2.5 fen, now standing at one tael five mace three fen five. Other exchange rates, except for Hong Kong which remained unchanged at 80 taels, were all lowered.

Consequently, compared to last Saturday, British exchange rates shrank by 1875, American dollars by 375, and Japanese gold increased by 2 fen. Chinese merchants initially sold off in the morning but shifted to covering short positions in the afternoon. The Dalian gang engaged in purchasing from early morning, with British gold being the most active, with approximately 300,000 pounds changing hands. Foreign merchants also settled accounts for imported goods, leading to strong bank demand in the morning. Gold firms were generally speculative.

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Market Sentiment Rebounds</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was closed due to a holiday. Indian cotton prices fluctuated by 1.3 rupees. Prices for three-grade yarn saw mixed gains and losses in the morning and afternoon. Local standard yarn prices rose by one tael for near-term deliveries and fell by 6-9 mace for distant-term deliveries in the morning. In the afternoon, prices continued to rise by 3 mace to one tael. It was noted that prices had fallen by 10 taels over the past two weeks, dropping below the 60-tael mark. The market should stabilize slightly. Additionally, current sales improved, with the Sichuan gang showing strong buying interest. Combined with the upward trend in the gold market, sentiment shifted from observation to excitement. A major investor continued to purchase, and there were general expectations for positive news from the US cotton market tomorrow. Consequently, the yarn market improved by over two taels. Current yarn sales remained good, with approximately 2,800 bales changing hands. The cotton market stabilized, and yarn sales became more active. This helped to restore some of the lost confidence. Yesterday's benchmark cotton price rose by 1.5-3 mace in the morning and further rose by 5 fen to 1 mace 5 in the afternoon. Current demand was slightly active. 119 bales of Yao cotton arrived at the docks. The sales listings are recorded below: Yongyu Factory purchased Yao Cotton 300 bales, price 38.00 for immediate delivery to the factory. Yokohama gang purchased Yao Cotton 400 bales, price 37.00 for immediate delivery from the warehouse. Zhenhuan Factory purchased Brazilian cotton 200 bales, price 43.00 for immediate delivery from the warehouse.</p>

<p>British and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly Report</p>
<p>Bombay</p>
<p>Last week, the cotton market fluctuated due to the unresolved US-French negotiations. Prices were relatively high, and speculators engaged in selling. Many long positions were liquidated due to political reasons. In the spot market, Pilal and Gandhi cotton saw strong demand. Japanese merchants were particularly active in purchasing high-grade cotton. White Luo Creek and Taoleila cotton were shipped to Shanghai. Local factories only purchased the cotton they needed. The weather was favorable. The attached weekly statistics are as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts Since September 1 3,366 3,237</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 1,148 860</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports Since September 1 2,215 2,143</p>
<p>To Europe 780 550</p>

<p>To Japan 1,019 1,202</p>
<p>To Other Locations 58 24</p>
<p>Liverpool</p>
<p>Spot demand was stable last week. Although futures prices rose, the statistical situation remained favorable for short positions. Market activity was primarily transactional. There seemed to be a widespread anticipation of the US cotton report on Wednesday. Egyptian cotton prices closely followed US cotton prices.</p>
<p>Grain and Rice Market Prices Rose Due to Mold and Rain</p>
<p>Xinzha</p>
<p>Yesterday, 20-30 ships arrived along the Suzhou Creek. Due to rain in the morning, prices were raised. The market was clear during midday, and rice prices stabilized. The price of Changxi Thick Japonica Rice with the largest volume was similar to the original price. Initially, Jiangyin, Liyang and other Japonica Rice varieties were weak, with prices falling slightly. Stoneport Green Glutinous Rice and village rice saw slight activity in shop sales, but wholesale prices were tight. According to letters from Dufu, the trend of Short-Grain Rice was firm, but limited Shanghai sales prevented excessive weakness. As foreign Short-Grain Rice buying interest eased, prices were adjusted. Glutinous rice saw limited activity from alcohol merchants, with prices expected to loosen.</p>
<p>South Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, rain continued, and supplies were scarce. There were very few people at the market in the morning. Thick Japonica rice prices remained stable. Thin Japonica rice arrivals and inventory were both scarce. Demand from Ningbo and street vendors was active but not smooth. Due to the scarcity of goods, prices were expected to rise significantly. Arrivals of Luyang Short-Grain Rice were more frequent, with varying demand and no significant price changes. Early-season rice arrivals and sales at Nanqiao were even, and the market remained stable. Black rice sold well, with prices rising and quality declining. Approximately 600-700 dan of rice arrived by boat from Pujiang.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain Pushed Up Flour Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a sudden rise in prices across all months after the morning opening. Although foreign wheat prices were down by 2-3 cents in Chicago, the excessive mold and rain, with reports of disasters in Pinghan and Fujian, and the heavy rain in Shanghai the night before, led to the belief that the weather would impact rice rather than wheat. As a result, buying interest from inland merchants surged again, with a renewed push. Half of these factors were likely credible, but the ultimate key was the price ratio with foreign markets. Local price increases were inevitably based on limited information. Prices in the afternoon stabilized with minimal fluctuations. The price of current-month contracts rose by 1.25 fen compared to the previous weekend. August contracts rose by 1.75 fen, September contracts rose by 2 fen, October contracts rose by 1.25 fen, and November/December contracts rose by 1.75 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat Market Continued to Rise</p>
<p>Strong Support from Inland Merchants</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw a general upward trend in prices across all months after the morning and afternoon openings. Although spot wheat was abundant for current-month contracts, shorts from inland merchants were eager to cover due to the heavy rain. The large number of shorts led to tightening pressure. Distant-month contracts also saw rising prices due to aggressive buying from inland merchants. It was reported that merchants from Shanghai and Ningbo were either reversing short positions to long positions or aggressively buying if they were not short. Under these circumstances, prices could potentially rise further by several fen. Prices for contracts up to October generally rose by 1-2 fen, while November/December contracts rose by 2 fen. Major factories still showed little interest in the spot wheat market due to abundant foreign wheat inventory, which could not be used immediately. These were the current facts.</p>
<p>2100+ bags of wheat from Shuangfeng, Taicang, Anting, Wangxianqiao, Bacheng, Wusong, and Huojiaqiao were shipped by Xinda Xiangxin, according to reports.</p>
<p>Raw Silk and Tea Prices Were Flat with Clear Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai foreign firm raw silk market remained sluggish. Reports of overseas silk prices from Shanghai white silk factories did not change. Buying interest in raw silk from England and India waned. The market was quiet. Only Dachang and others purchased 30 bales of medium-to-low-grade white silk at flat prices. Arrivals of summer cocoons from Haining were increasingly scarce.</p>
<p>Continuous Mold and Rain</p>
<p>Cocoon Prices Trending Upward</p>
<p>Farmers in Haining and other cities and villages suffered losses in the first batch of summer silkworms due to weather damage, abandoning 80% of their production. The second batch of silkworm cocoons also saw reduced yields, with at most 50% harvested. Cocoon firms have been open for several days and have been competing to purchase high-quality cocoons, pushing prices up to 50 yuan. Continuous mold and rain in the past two days have further reduced cocoon arrivals, pushing cocoon prices even higher. Prices for improved varieties of high-quality cocoons are expected to rise to 54 yuan.</p>
<p>Needle-like Bud Tea Sales to France Slightly Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai foreign firm tea market saw activity from Peace Road and other firms for needle-like bud tea. Transactions were not quiet, but the sales price was down by approximately 4-5 taels compared to the past. Zhenmei tea sales were sluggish. Only low-grade goods from Wenzhou and Yushan saw some transactions. Other varieties such as Zhenmei and Xiumei tea saw limited sales.</p>
<p>Piece Goods Sales Were Relatively Active</p>
<p>Local Factory Cloth</p>
<p>The trend was slightly soft due to increasing spot inventory and reduced demand. Sentiment was weakening. Thin twill fell by approximately 5 fen, with Yanghe at 7 taels 5 qian 2.5 fen, Blue Double Fish at 7 taels 4 qian 7.5 fen, and Squirrel falling back below 7 taels. Among thin cloths, Yanghe was the weakest, selling at 7 taels 5 qian 7.5 fen. Trumpet Boy prices remained at 7 taels 6 qian 5 fen due to low spot inventory. Blue Flying Fish was at 7 taels 9 qian 5 fen, and Blue Chicken remained at approximately 7 taels 5 qian. Rough twill saw a strong price decline, with Three Fish falling to 5 taels 9 qian 5 fen, Cat Owl at 5 taels 7 qian 5 fen, and Human Tower at 7 taels 2 qian 5 fen. Among rough cloths, 13-pound goods were generally soft. 9-pound cloth saw active street sales, with over 100 pieces changing hands. Jubao Basin was at 4 taels 8 qian 5 fen, and Cat Owl was at 4 taels 9 qian 5 fen.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods</p>
<p>East goods Yuehua saw strong demand, with 300-400 pieces changing hands. Yang Guifei large pattern was at 2 qian 4 fen 7.5 li, Circus medium pattern was at 2 qian 3 fen 7.5 li, and Awo black flower was at 2 qian 3 fen 5 li, mostly purchased by the Chengdu gang. Chongqing, Jiangxi, and Xuzhou gangs were also active. Zhigong cloth sales were strong after the price decline, with Moganshan at 3 qian 6 fen 5 li and Hui at 3 qian 6 fen 7.5 li, with significant purchases by the Xuzhou and Chengdu gangs. Yuan Yu silk fell by 5 fen, Zhulin was at 12 taels 0 fen 5 li, Qingguan Mirror was at 12 taels 1 qian 5 li. Street sales were slightly active.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Saw Price Declines and Weakness in Coarse Sugar and White Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a lack of telegraphic reports from production areas. Trading was sluggish in the guild market. Dutch sugar #24 coarse sugar white high-grade was at 10 taels 08 qian, with limited interest. Regular grade was at 10 taels 07 qian, with even less interest. #20 medium sugar white was quoted at 10 taels 04 qian, #18 at 10 taels 03 qian, #8 Dutch red sugar at 9 taels 1 qian, #10 grade at 9 taels 3 qian, but demand was scarce. Market conditions were generally weak. Imports and exports of Japanese sugar were also sluggish. Z mark was at 10 taels 07 qian, SH mark was at 10 taels 05 qian 2.5 fen, #1 mark was at 11 taels 1 qian, YT mark was at 10 taels 06 qian 5 fen, YP mark was at 11 taels, YR mark was at 10 taels 05 qian to 4 qian 7.5 fen, TX mark was at 10 taels 09 qian, TK mark was at 10 taels 07 qian, TM mark was at 10 taels 06 qian to 5 qian 5 fen. Market sentiment was also weak. The trade board was also quiet. Taiyuan Company ice sugar has opened, and demand saw a slight increase. The market became slightly bullish. Local factory ice sugar #1 grade was at 13 taels 9 qian, with a lack of interest and prices expected to decline.</p>
<p>Northern and Southern Goods: New Zhengzhou Vegetables Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>New Lanzhou Branches Prices Were High</p>
<p>The first batch of new Zhengzhou vegetables arrived in Hankou and were directly purchased by the Guangdong gang. A small quantity was also transported here and purchased by local traders, totaling only 6 pieces. Samples were seen yesterday, and the color, texture, and quality were deemed good. They were quickly purchased by Nanyang and Guangdong gangs, but the price had not yet been finalized, likely around 32 taels per piece. This was a trial run. Later shipments would be delayed due to transportation difficulties.</p>
<p>According to reports from the source, new Lanzhou branches saw high prices as traders from this region went to Zhangzhou to purchase them, pushing the cost to nearly 45-46 taels. As the market price was too high, sales might be affected, and some traders were waiting to see.</p>
<p>2000 Bundles of Hardware Garden Lead Wire Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Hardware trading remained quiet yesterday. Apart from decorative items, large transactions were scarce. However, 2000 bundles of Hardware Garden lead wire arrived at the Mitsubishi Company warehouse, boosting prices. Standard prices weakened. The current market price was 4 taels 7 qian per bundle, down 1 qian 5 fen from before. British copper plates and new foreign yuan saw a price decline of 1 qian due to increased arrivals. Spot sales of tinplate remained strong, but large transactions remained sluggish. Price trends were stable as there were no major fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.</p>
