<p>聲明尊重中國主權與獨立</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　昨日日大使廣田訪蘇俄外交副委員加拉罕面致警告、倘外間所傳蘇俄在滿軍事活動果屬確實、則日本勢將被迫擴大糾紛範圍、由南滿而入北滿、今日加拉罕延廣田至外部親予答復、竭力否認蘇俄派兵至滿、及供給敎練官及軍火之說、據俄政府本日發表、略謂廣田大使昨日訪加拉罕、代表日政府聲明邇來滿洲方面傳說甚盛、　蘇維埃政府援助馬占山將軍、供給軍隊敎練官及軍火等、并請蘇俄政府注意外間傳說馬占　山親自宣稱、刻有俄兵二萬至三萬人、正向大烏里站集中、擬開入滿境等語、此皆足以激惹日本輿論及滿洲日軍當道之煩惱、最後并稱、倘蘇俄派兵至中東路、日本亦將派兵至日欵建造之洮昻鐵路、果若是、衝突範圍將見擴大云云、今日加拉罕乃邀廣田至外部、代表俄政府聲明、略謂蘇聯政府對於廣田大使十月二十八日代表日政府聲明、不能不驚異、該項聲明根據於絶對無稽之謠言、全由日人與華人不負責方面者所揑造、若輩有意布散流言、挑撥雙方、於中取利、日政府當不能不知龍江駐軍或滿境其他軍隊中、并無蘇聯敎練官在内、日政府亦不能不知此項軍隊、向未接受蘇俄軍械子彈之接濟、此時亦并無此種接濟、日政府亦不能不知蘇聯政府對於滿洲爭執之兩造　并不援助任何一造、蘇俄政府嚴守不干涉政策、并非欲見好於人、純因尊重蘇俄與中國簽訂之國際條約、及尊重他國之主權與獨立、故蘇俄政府深信軍事佔領政策、縱可假借援助爲藉口、但於蘇俄之和平政策及保持世界之和平不能相容、希望此項答復、已可包容廣田大使廿八日聲明中所述一切問題云云、（廿九日國民電）</p>

<p>告、頗爲惶慮、今日特因此事向俄政府切實交涉、駐俄日大使廣田正式訪問俄外長加拉罕、陳說蘇俄在滿活動之謠、刻在日本發生擾亂影響情事、奉外相幣原訓令、請蘇俄停止可引起軍恐慌之活動、據俄國太斯通信社消息、日大使聲稱、滿洲境内近有種種謠言、謂俄政府在軍事上扶助黑省政府馬主席、供以彈械等物、馬主席自稱有俄兵二萬至四萬、集於大烏里站附近、準備入滿、此種謠言、使日本之輿情及滿洲之日軍當道咸爲之擾動、如俄軍果遣往中東鐵路、則日本亦將派兵至用日欵築成之洮齊鐵路、若是則衝突範圍、將愈擴大云、加拉罕答詞否認此種傳言之確實、謂此謠言全無根據、係不負責任者所杜造、欲散布關於滿洲時局之挑釁的傳說、實則齊哈爾、或滿洲他省任何軍隊中並無蘇俄敎練員在内、而該處軍隊亦從未接到由俄國運去之軍械彈藥、蘇俄政府絶未扶助滿洲對敵軍隊之行何方面、不僅如是、蘇俄且守嚴格不干涉之政策、因蘇俄尊重與中國簽定之國際條約也、太斯通信社末稱、俄政府希望加拉罕之答詞、已概括日大使所提出之各項問題云、（三十日路透社電）</p>

<h3>美報力闢日人宣言謬妄</h3>
<p>爭點乃在非戰公約</p>
<p>紐約　日前日本大阪每日新聞載本山所著一文、對於日軍强佔遼吉一舉、力爲曲辯、一方謂日本在滿抱門户開放政策、一方要求日本在遠東有援用門羅主義之權利、并力辯日本並未違犯非戰公約、當時紐約世界電聞及史克里浦何沃德系其他廿四家報紙、均載此項消息、今日紐約世界電聞報特著長論立力闢其妄、謂苟有人能爲日本在滿行動辯護、則每日新聞主筆當然亦優爲之、不幸其坦白之言辭、或能使若干讀者信日本行動之不愚、但不能使吾輩信服也、本山所稱日本在滿之條約權利、乃自戰敗俄國中得來、而中國屢圖破壞日本在滿利益之一節、要知文中所舉之事實、全由日人擇利己者而表白之、匪特中國不能接受、即美國之專家恐必將加以擯絶、至謂美國對拉丁美利堅旣施行門羅主義、日本對滿出此、亦無不可云云、此誠不値答復、縱使日本此次行動、確由中國挑釁而成、然本不應拒絶中立國之調查、及中立國之調解也、凱洛格白里安非戰公約斷不能　僅以此乃施諸戰爭者、日本今未與中國開戰、不能援用該約之飾詞、而恝然置之也、故日本之軍事行動、斷不能視爲與中國解决爭端之和平方法、本山又謂日本對滿之主義、實屬正當云云、要知今日之爭點、并不在此、乃在非戰條約、該報末謂如因非戰條約之故、而使世界團結以共抗日本、則日本圖得滿洲、亦何利之有乎、（二十九日國民電）</p>

<p>英國國選舉之結果。今已昭示於世界。其最足以使人欽佩感嘆之點。即爲此次選舉。政府派佔絶對之多數。各黨之領袖與黨員。都甘願犧牲其黨的立塲。與政治的成見。表示絶對信任政。府擁護政府。以打破彼國國家目前之艱難。而鞏固國民政府之地位。選舉結果揭出之後。麥唐納曾發出一文通告全國。謂「政府獲此令人心感之空前多數。定可使世界咸知英國人民於國家請求援助時輒一心一德以應赴之也。」史諾登亦謂「英國在世界中之地位。因此屆選舉而大爲鞏固。擁護國民政府之大多數。非是一黨的。但爲國民的勝利。」保守黨包爾温謂「國家已大獲勝利。此非黨的勝利吾國人之愛國根性。今已揭示於外國人於投票時。已以明白之聲音宣佈黨爭主義。决不能在國家緊急時與國民合作之一般的願望相抗」國民自由黨薩繆爾亦。謂「國會大權現操於保守黨領袖之掌握中但此大權付與國民政府之閣員。用以辦理一致協定之事業。而非任何一黨之事業」凡此各黨領袖之發言。都抛却其一黨之利益。而以國家之利益。爲前提以鞏固新建之國民政府爲前提。吾人猶憶十月七日英皇簽署解散國會令後。詔諭人民有云。「朕深信人民本匹夫有責之義對於恢復本國之繁榮。應竭力之所及。以應付之」今日選舉結果之事實竟能有以無負英皇之期望。此誠足以表示英國人民政治訓練之健全及其愛國思想之發達。而其政治組織與選舉制度之高尙健全則尤足使全世界嘖嘖稱道者也。</p>
<p>英國自近年以來。國運日落。工業凋敝。貿易衰退。財政窘迫。失業增重。國内軍隊時呈不穩情勢。國外則殖民地亦時作自治獨立之抗爭。國勢已日趨衰微。「衰老之英國。夕陽西下之英國」全世界對資本主義先進國之英國。都作如是之觀察。然而證諸英國今日黨派犧牲黨見。誠意合作之精神。以及英國人民對國是之監督。與積極負責。正顯示英國之國際地位。非常鞏固其國家前途方興未艾。</p>
<p>於此誠令吾人不得不深致慨嘆之忱於我國之當前現狀。我國今日。内困洪水。外迫强鄰。國脈危殆不絶如縷國民黨以一黨主政無他黨掣肘。然而連年以來糾紛百出。禍亂相尋。致亂之源。與其謂爲黨見政見。無寗謂爲個人之私見。今際此空前危難。而所謂和平統一之局。迄難産生。寗粤雙方。猶相對峙。豈英國各黨領袖能輕黨重國。犧牲黨的立塲以共赴國難。而謂中國國民黨之諸領袖。竟不能犧牲個人私見。以救危如纍卵之。黨并以救生死綫上之國耶。嗚呼。</p>

<p>路透二十九日倫敦電　今日午後閣員復集於唐寗街、此爲選舉後之第一集會、與會者皆興致極佳、面有笑容、不似國民政府最初集會時之咸有憂色矣、自由黨薩繆爾在集會前與麥唐納晤談半小時、</p>

<h3>張海鵬失敗後</h3>
<p>日人利用蒙匪與朝鮮浪人搗亂</p>
<p>哈爾濱通信、日人此次進兵目的、在欲造成東三省之新割據政府、以爲其帝國主義之工具、在國聨提出勸告之前、已造成熙洽之吉林長官公署及鬫朝璽等等之維持會、該兩機關雖無甚大勢力、亦可以驢苎虎皮、將東北良民威嚇一下、唯黑龍江省有萬福麟之子萬國賓坐鎭、依然未動、東省特别區又有蘇俄關係、未能遂所欲爲、於是乃假借把持四洮洮昂兩路之機會、以造成一種新的惡勢力、洮南鎭守使張海鵬遂爲所愚弄矣、</p>
<p>張海鵬在先、本與張作霖張作相張景惠輩爲同儕、入民國以後、張作霖任大元帥、張作相張景惠、皆已官達最高級、而自己仍不過爲一僻地之鎭守使、實不甘心、昔年改編黄顯聲之部下彭徐二團、以厚兵力、已有不甘伏櫪之意、然當時張作霖之勢力、尙是鐵桶江山、其後鄒作華部屯墾興安、權位皆在己上、更予張海鵬不快、此次日本出兵、張氏以爲天假之緣、日人更秋波频送、遂不得不爲失節之漢奸矣、</p>
<p>日人方面初亦以爲大有把握、蓋其尙憶及昔日日俄戰爭時東三省紅鬍子爲其助力之好夢也、日俄之役、日人曾得鬍匪助力、故今次日本於出兵之先、日人耗費二十餘萬日金、鼓動鬍子、但鬍匪中不乏豪俠好漢、近如桿子首蓋三省等所發爲國捐軀傳單、即其一證也、此次日人利用張海鵬、以爲張本係舊日綠林人物、當易利用、張氏則除受日人之蠱惑外、又被亡清餘黨恭親王溥偉等朦蔽、溥偉等在瀋陽活動後、預先册封張爲黑龍江將軍、於是張食指大動、日人之軍械兩火車、乃於本月十日十一日深夜、運往洮南交張、</p>
<p>張海鵬旣得軍實及蒙匪（善騎者）之接濟、乃授意其所部彭徐兩團長俾作準備、兩團長猶疑不决、至本月十二日、日兵三百餘名、自南開到、對張極力壓迫、令其動員、張不得已、乃明令彭徐兩團長動員、兩團長對稱、鎭守使命令弗敢違、惟職等此去、若再見鎭使、恐不能耳、兩團長出、而兵仍遲遲不進、（後終倒張之戈）日兵慮夜長夢多、復强迫張及其親信登車北進、詎其時黑軍早已見機準備、駐嫩江畔之于兆麟旅、即退江左、燬橋而守、見敵至、即鳴砲抵禦、張部平日難曾受訓練、但見今度係爲日寇而戰、故均無鬥志、聞槍聲一哄而散、日兵鞭策無效、又恐屯墾軍（鄒作華部）抄其後路、乃押殘餘兵卒直退鎭東、（距洮南北百餘里）而來哈之東特長官公署顧問日人　亦於是虚此一行矣、</p>
<p>二十日晚新任黑省代理主席原黑河鎭守使馬占山氏、微服自黑河搭船、中途在對青山換車往龍沙、已於二十一日上午就職、其軍隊亦已有一旅左右到黑垣、黑軍蘇炳文海滿護路旅、亦已趕到、添此兩生力軍、張海鵬遂一蹶不能再起、日人方面見張失敗、深恐其分化手續、從此難以着手、乃一方先極力援助蒙匪、擾亂地方、破壞打通路、塞斷錦州與黑龍江省之聯絡、並以爲把持之借口、一方又宣傳洮南流行柏斯篤疫、以免外人前往調查眞相、另一方面復在朝鮮募集浪人數萬、於十二三等日之夜九時許、以軍艦護送至大連登陸、其時大連全市滅燈數十分鐘、以免人民知覺、目下此等朝鮮浪人、已全部武裝、一部份散在北寗沿線、使之擾亂、爲將來借口、一部份則爲補充張海鵬部之用、已於十五六等日分次運往洮南矣、張部實力補足後、洮昻路上恐仍不免發生糾紛耳、（二十二日）</p>
<h3>日人之所謂懸案者如是</h3>
<p>彼方稱我侵犯條約處</p>
<p>全係日人片面之理由</p>
<p>北平通信、日軍於佔據遼吉後、對外揚言、謂中日懸案三百餘件、中國無視條約、有意拖延、以致激起日本全國人民之憤怒、而有佔據遼吉之事實、今欲解决一切懸案、必須保障佔領、喚醒華方、期早解决等語、彼時吾人即懷疑於日政府此言、未免過於誇大、所謂懸案、决無三百餘件之多、且亦未嘗有侵犯條約之處、曾經多方搜索、四處調查、期獲得其確數、錄而告之讀者、俾證明日人之善於誇大、更可作爲將來交涉之一種資料、顧奔走匝月、不易尋覓雖略知其若干、却嫌並非全豹、遷延至今、無以饜讀者之望、今乃於可靠之日人方面探得、其所謂中國侵害日本滿蒙權益之實例者、併中村事件計之、亦僅五十四件、且其中或事屬輕微、或無理取鬧、或根據我全國所否認之二十一條、或藉口於滿期之旅大條約、又如南滿路駐兵、日本係繼承中俄條約而取得之權利、滿洲善後協約、明明規定如俄國將中東路守備隊撤銷、日本亦應照辦、後中俄舊約廢棄、日本不但未曾遵行條約上之義務、反憑藉該約、責我違背、諸如此類、不勝枚舉、茲將日人所謂中國侵害茯利益之五十四件、完全錄出、閱者讀之、當亦知日人之居心如何、并應速加研究而痛駁之也、</p>

<p>七·於通遼打通關於四洮連絡設備之件、打通線路不顧日方抗議而建設、成爲滿鐵併行線、日本　於就自通遼敷設延　線有三大之利害關係、而四洮打通之連絡設備工事、亦與延　線有密接關係、日方據與中國於昭和五年十二月在天津舉行北寜（打通）四洮兩鐵道之會議、將連　設備之實施决定、因屢次喚起中國方面之注意殊於鐵道開始交涉後、右問題及他之諸問題交涉題目一律妥當之旨已明、連絡設備商請等候、而中國置之不顧、並不通知而完成連絡設備八·否認滿鐵四洮連絡協定滿鐵與四洮鐵路局間之連絡運輪契約、已於昭和三年九月調印該契約有不可分之關係立關於南滿經由鮮鐵四洮貨物聯絡運輸契約之改訂、未得交通委員會之諒解至今兩契约擱置、日尙未改訂、</p>
<p>九·吉敦線及洮昂線工事　清　苦衷、對於吉敦線（昭和三年十月完成）工事費金三千四百萬元、洮昻線（昭和二年六月完成）工事費金一千二百九十二萬元、中國訴說苦情、至今尙未能確定</p>
<p>十·妨害滿鐵行一年約九十件、因中國官憲取締不周之結果、於昭和四五年在滿鐵及州外所蒙妨害如左（五年度件數减少、係因日方特别努力預防之故）</p>

<h3>法拉第</h3>
<p>一位小朋友看了愛迪生之死之一篇談話中提及法拉第ＭicbaelＦaraday是發電機之發明者，便要我多告訴他一些關於法拉第之事迹。這是我所願意答復的，比看活動影戲還願意。</p>
<p>法拉第生於公元七九一年死於一八六七年，活了七十六歲。他在四十歲的時候（一八三一年十月十七日）發明了發電機的原理。有了發電機之原理之發明，愛迪生這些人纔能運用來創造電燈，電車，電話，種種電力之機械。世界上的人是知道愛迪生的多，知道法拉第的少。法拉第以前，電這樣東西只可算是一個科學的把戲。自從法拉第發明發電機以後，這世界的顔色爲之一變。法拉第無疑的電化世紀之開山祖師。</p>
<p>法拉第的父親是一位鐵匠，　以爲上學不上學與打鐵無關，始終没有給法拉第進學校。在十三歲的時候法拉第開始跟着利波Ｒiebau做徒弟學訂書。這個工作他學了七年。徒弟中要算他奇怪。他是面訂書，一面讀書，書訂好了，他也讀好了。利波是一位有見識的師傅，從來不阻止徒弟看書。這時期裏他裝訂過一部百平全書，書裏有一篇論文，題目是電，他一口就把它吞下肚了。他說這奇怪的電，用不着多少時間去讀，因爲電的道理不知道還多着咧。他從此便抱了一個宏願要向電進攻。他還遇了一本化學的實騐也被他吃了。他把省吃儉用餘下來的錢一起買了儀器藥品，幹那化學的把戲。一天，他聽說皇家學會享有盛名的化學家戴斐Ｄavy要在倫敦公開演講，適有一位顧客來，他問這位顧客可否做個東請他到倫敦去聽演講。這位顧客滿口允許，買了四張入塲劵送他。法拉第便進城聽講，一面聽，一面記下來。回店後，他宛了一封長信給戴斐，將筆記附去給他看，要求一見。戴斐回信請他去談，他大膽要求戴斐在皇家學會給他一些工作做便他可以學科學。這大膽的請求，在一個月後是慷慨的允許了。從此法拉第便以每星期二十五先令之工資做戴斐的助手。這是法拉第一生的大關鍵，也是世界學術上一個大關鍵。</p>
<p>法拉第，發電機，電化世界，統統都是從一個手腦雙用的訂書徒弟那兒來的</p>
<h3>日本人與南京蟲</h3>
<p>— 風舞</p>
<p>日本人呌臭蟲爲「南京蟲」其歷史是這樣的。自從中日通商起。日人一南京經商。返國後就發現這個討厭的東西後來在日本就繁殖起來了。以是日人就呌它爲「南京蟲」。這就是表示日本没有這種汚穢討厭的小動物。惟有髒得不堪的中國人才具備的臭蟲推其意就是訕笑中國人欠清潔而汚穢就是了</p>
<p>當在下在東京求學的時候。日藉同學也認識了好幾個。其中有一個很足以代表日本浪人丨或是日本人的本來眞面目。有一天他拿了一個小黑豆般的東西給我看。臉孔上現出獰笑對我說。「看着。這小東西一他格格地笑笑又說。「支那的特産你呌它什麽」。我提神睜開了眼睛一看是個臭蟲。我明知他們來譏笑中華大國民。馬上應聲說。「這是東京蟲呵。」他們三人彼此相視現出驚惶的狀態後來我自作聰明。把日本的南京蟲的傳說。改爲「東京蟲」的歷史。四人相視而笑就散去了</p>
<p>區區的臭蟲。豈中國獨有。而日人竟引以訕笑我們中國人。眞可惡極了。</p>
<h3>温州因果錄</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>客有自温州來者。爲述二因果事。均係該地近代所證實者。念其足爲危世挽頽風之一助也爰筆錄如次。</p>
<p>富翁某甲。温州之名秀才也。無兒女。積財千萬。但視錢如命。一毛不拔對於貧苦之人。不惟不加憐恤。甚且重利盤剥。無稍寛假其鄰某因負翁債巷重無法償還。富翁迫之無奈將其有孕之婦變價消還鄰人大慟。於婦出之日之晚間。懸樑自盡。絶命前曾切齒曰。死後誓有以報復。當鄰人自盡之時即富翁愛妾得子之候。故舉家雖歡喜若狂。親友皆道賀稱觴而翁心終不懌。及其子長大。驕奢淫佚。將所有財産揮霍殆盡未幾良田萬頃。夏屋雲連之富家。竟一貧如洗矣。翁乃悔恨而太息曰一人謂無兒窮到老。我今到老爲兒窮」。不久即死去。人咸以爲拆散人父子夫婦曁利用其優越之經濟力壓迫無産者之現報也</p>
<p>又有某乙者。居温州城亦富家也。因誣證其鄰人子爲非。致鄰人子寃難昭雪。一日。憤而投塘水以死。某乙眠後。輒見鄰人子披髮含血戟指而駡曰。（此怨必報。報在淺塘」富翁乙自是終身諱不敢赴錢塘江一帶某年其子升學杭州某大學於暑天酷熱之際。入淺塘水中冲凉。竟淹斃。人咸怪之。而翁則心知其故。後述於其媪。輾轉相傳。一縣家喻户曉。莫不稱决而悚於因果報應云。</p>
<p>嗚呼。人生即幻即眞。亦是亦非。愚以爲無生、死、榮辱、富貴、貧、賤、之可言。或云人定可以勝天。但究有數在。有之者何得便謂之有。無之者何得便謂之無。然則昧於人生眞義而相剥削相殘殺。不惜大種惡因而令百千萬年後之人類唾駡者。抑又何耶。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>火車站中的新設備　德國古朗Ｃologne地方的鐵路當局。爲使等候火車的旅客們便利起見。特在車站中添設一間寫字間。備有打字機。與打字員給人服務。祗須略略納费。便可寫信拍電得到便利不少。法蘭克福Ｆrankfort地方的火車站。因鑒於這種設備之受人歡迎。所以也照樣的添設了一間寫字間了。</p>
<p>美國人的消費　美國是全世界最富之國。所以美國人的消費。也過於别國的人民。據最近統計。他們消費於零賣的吃食店中的。平均每人爲十八金鎊八先令。消費於汽車與一切車件上的。每人平均爲十五金鎊十二先令。在這兩點上看來。可知美國人之愛吃零食與喜坐汽車</p>
<p>法國香白米鎭的禁例　法國香白米鎭。Ｃhambery由市長訂定一個禁例。每天午後十時至午前八時之間。所有旅館與公　塲中不許開留聲機奏鋼琴。以及使用無綫電等各種發聲的東西。并通知人家。不得使他們的狗呌。街道中的汽車也不許撳捺喇叭。以便鎭中的人都可安睡</p>
<h3>國難聲中之工商界服務同人聽者</h3>
<p>— 心水</p>
<p>上海職業指導所爲鼓勵該所介紹成就之工商界服務同人起見。時常舉行服務談話會。此次談話會適値國難之中。該所主　潘仰堯先生。因撰國難中對於工商界服務同人之貢獻一文。謹錄如次。</p>
<p>歲月不居。流光如駛。又値第二次舉行服務談話會之期。距上次之會。僅一月耳。此一月中。暴目肆虐。國難臨頭。嗟外侮之憑陵。悲國家之凌亂。我知諸君痛心切齒。悲憤至於無極。俱欲急起救國。以爲禦暴圖存計。救國工作。萬緒千端。就同人之見。認爲無過於下述三端。</p>
<p>（一）準備體力學力　我國人身體之柔弱。精神之不振。毋庸諱言。而吾服務職業界同人爲尤甚。平日旣無鍛練之機。臨事又存畏縮之態。今日職業界領袖最不滿意於青年店員者。無過於身體太弱。從今以後。我人第一應注意體育。勞爾筋骨。振爾精神。磨厲以須。以準備共赴國難之體力。寇深矣。苟今日萎靡不振。不作如是之準備。請延頸以待强暴之宰割。救國根本。厥在科學。今日中國之不足以與暴日競者。豈兵數之不如。糧食之不足。無他。人與人戰。可操勝算。科學與科學戰。當然不如。不但有形之戰。相形見絀。即無形之戰之經濟絶交。自不用仇貨以後。隨處感到困難。原料之缺乏。尤爲科學幼稚之鐵證。故今日我人應刻苦勵學。鑽研於科學中。始能禦暴圖存。胡適之言。「救國應内心鞭辟。自能久而彌堅。」準使學力。即内心鞭辟工夫也。</p>
<p>（二）努力本位工作國是糜爛如此。在人人不負責。不努力。而專以責人爲事。我人須自知國家横　暴日踴躪至此。對祖宗。對子孫。人人爲莫大之罪人。故責難一切之前。還應自責。不肯自責。不能救國。故我人今日惟一責任。在努力本位之工作。多一分工作。增一分抗日力量。多一分事業。增一分救國成效多製造一份出品。便爲多抵制一分仇貨。我工商界同人。在自己職務上。多作一分努力便是在經濟戰塲上。軍事戰塲上。多增一分力量。九二老人馬相伯先生言。今後國民各抱决心「痛改前非。自贖自救。羣策羣力。共赴國難。則十年生聚。十年敎訓。終必有自强振作之一日。」老人之言。自當奉爲圭臬。</p>
<p>（三）節制欲望我人在内憂外患天災人禍之中。外侮至於此極辱没祖宗。遺禍子孫。滿口血。滿眶涙。祗有咽下肚皮。作臥薪嘗胆之資料。我人今日無他方法足以自救。祗有節衣節食節行節柱。始可自救中國。從今以後。我人應咬緊牙關。下一决心。停止種種娱樂。節約種種浪費。將一切無謂不急之費用。慨予免除。以爲救國禦暴之準備。况値生活程度日高之際。尤當凛然於維持生活之難。量入爲出。克儉克勤。此八字尤爲我人之金科玉律。諸君乎。禍急矣。寇深矣。國將亡。族將滅。常此因循苟目。此後欲求服務之機會。恐亦不可得。此後欲求如今日一堂之聚談。恐亦不可得。諸君諸君。試思門外之欲得業而未得業者幾何人。無家可歸者幾何人。自日商中退出而失業者幾何人。賦閒日久瀕於絶境者幾何人。此皆吾同胞也。一夫不獲共其所。我人之責也。諸君有何方法來援救此垂死之同胞乎。請諸君念此三語。一。準備體力學力。二。努力本位工作。三。節制欲望。</p>
<p>來函　逕啟者。頃閱本月二十九日貴刋抗日之聲欄。載有本台和日本私通消息主角係本台報務主任魏人銘等三人業已撤職查辦等語。查本台報務主任魏大銘因故停職。確係事實。至所云與日本私通消息一節。全屬無根之談。本台自瀋案發生以後。以自稔所負國際通信之責任重人。經督飭所屬加倍努力工作。期利外交事機。國難正殷。凡有血氣之倫。罔不圖自奮救國。庸有逆施倒行與敵人私通消息之妄舉。相應函請台端迅行設法更正。俾免混淆是非。紉感無旣。此致申報館大主筆。交通部國際電台啟。十月二十九日。</p>

<h3>鄉下人又到上海（二）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄉下人那天動身了。他居然有了坐火車的經騐。他知道四面關得悶緊的是貨車，開了一半鐵窗的是牛車，凡是人類，至少也要坐一個四等車。他聽得人講：坐火車就分出人的等級來。坐頭等車的是頭等人，坐二等車的是二等人，坐三四等車的自然是三四等人了。鄉下人應當坐四等車，但是他上一次坐了四等車，受了賣五香茶葉蛋的氣，此番闊氣一點，要坐三等車出出風頭的了。</p>
<p>上次從上海回來，在車裏肚子餓了，恰岇賣五香茶葉蛋的人，從他身邊擠過去，他被五香茶葉蛋的茴香味兒，引動了口中　唾。</p>
<p>「茶葉蛋賣幾個錢一個？」他裝出老吃客的樣子。</p>
<p>「兩角洋錢買四個。」</p>
<p>一那裏有這樣貴的雞蛋？我們鄉下，雞蛋不過八個銅板一個，兩角洋錢可以買六個。」鄉下人背他的物價論。</p>
<p>「那末你聞聞香味吧，一個銅板也不要你出。」賣茶葉蛋的放出惡毒的言語。鄉下人雖然肚子在咕囉咕羅的響，也不敢請敎他了。偏偏這五香茶葉蛋的香味直剌鼻觀，故意的給他爲難。</p>
<p>他恨極了。以爲坐了四等車，敎賣茶葉蛋的人也瞧不起，因此這一回，發憤的非坐三等車不可。</p>
<p>他得意洋洋的跑到售票處的窗洞口，却有一個人，站在那裏，所　他的身體一推，喝道：</p>
<p>「你買票子在那邊。」</p>
<p>他抬起頭來一看：却見一個人，戴了黄帽子，穿了黄衣褲，着了黄皮鞋，外加一隻黄面孔。</p>
<p>鄉下人暗暗地想：小時節聽得吾媽講，皇帝就是那樣打扮，從頭上一直黄到脚上，所以喚做皇帝。現在不是已經没有皇帝了嗎？但是他的氣派，他的威風，還好像是皇帝。</p>
<p>一我是來買票的。鄉下人放大了膽子說。</p>
<p>「你不瞧瞧清楚，這裏是賣頭二等票的。」那個穿黄衣服的人，對鄉下人瞪了一眼。</p>

<h3>美棉市况參差</h3>
<p>昨日美棉恐有反動、市况參差不定、先因廠商購進遠期而堅、後因南方抛售而疲、計期貨跌二至五磅音、現貨不動、英棉期貨漲八點、現貨跌六點、埃及棉現貨不動、印棉歐洲出口商及日商略有賣出投機家因匯兌　低而買進、計平果　跌　·七五羅比、奥姆辣跌一·七五羅比、白羅溪</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市一致趨定</h3>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源不多、然浦存漸薄、城鄉店銷不暢又屆國歷十月底關係、行號雙方結束賬欵、故行情亦形不振、新粳盤面暫告定局、窰種白哥到積無多寗胃轉活、零碎有限　價昻近角、白稻野稻來貨逐稀、本城雖動不爽、惟價稍漲一二角新洋杜尖到銷均平、市面穩定、變陰元　交栗碌酒户尙未開作、故暫居定局</p>
<p>新閘　昨日米市斛胃零多蠆少、開盤上落近角、新更頂貨價與昨相仿、中關貨喊起角、窰種白稻尙穩定、蘆埠尖去路微細洋尖到旺銷呆、價跌五分、糯米胃口寥寥、價稍見削、内地來源念四五號、河廠各貨解開四千二三百石之譜、</p>
<h3>洋米續有新交易</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、因洋行之一再抛售、人心與市面均爲步落、現洋米客帮停噸、到頭不絶、本街胃口有限、昨日祗由振興售出五百包、價十元○三角、期米回籠交易不多、開出小絞十一月份一百噸、價五兩一錢、又四月份一百噸、價五兩三錢新交易則有捷成洋行抛出二千噸、價祇五兩二錢二分、係三四月份云、</p>
<h3>標粉健而復弱</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、因洋麥報價、互有出人、芝加哥　小一角左右、坎拿大好三四角、故初開時人心平平、本月份究非缺貨、一時之狂熱、巳經軟化、惟違期各月份、因業外補空頗急、及一般臨時多頭、買氣頗暢、故又逐好、計有一分半之好勢、迨至下午開盤初亦穩俏、旋以廠家又逐有出檔、致業外人心又漸低疲、較最高時、回跌一分外、觀出月份市况、如果粉銷轉暢、當看穩住也、結果本月份反跌二分、十月份小七厘半、十二月一月份小五厘二三月份各小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥市結局良好</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、呈初疲繼俏之象、上午因洋麥報價、旣互有上落、且以前日之漲勢太狂、業内外之買賣、不免觀望、惟以現貨旣經抽出、大部分人心、終屬堅定、故漸即回振、迨至下午開盤、氣勢又佳、十一月份最高曾至三兩八錢、較上市又漲一分、惟漲度太銳、多頭續有回出、遠期各月份、大致穩定、結果十一月份較　日好三分、十二月份好五分、一二月份各好四分、三月份好一分云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白抛貨成交頗盛</h3>
<p>太古糖亦開五千包</p>
<p>劃市各糖一致步昻</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價仍一·三四二七五、紐約　糖十二月份價一·三二、比前電續升三分、明年度三月份價一·二七、比升二分、五月份一·三一、比升一分、九月份一·四○、未有升降、爪哇現期糖亦仍乏起伏、公會市場劃盤買氣俱盛、市價皆見步昻、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價自十一兩二錢至二錢半、中砂白十兩○八錢、棉荷白十一兩至十一兩○五分、市氣均挺太古糖Ｂ嘜十一兩二錢至二錢半、ＤＹ嘜十一兩一錢、ＨＸ嘜十二兩至○五分、ＨＭ嘜十一兩五錢半、交易頗勇、市形俱俏尙具逐升之象、抛貨粗砂白交易　盛、俱係十一月份前交貨總額共有四千餘噸計天祥洋行售開五百噸、源記一千噸、華新一千餘噸、價荷幣　元五角七分半、順全隆開出七百五十噸、禪臣立基二洋行及炳昌等號亦各開出三五百噸不等價荷幣五元五角半、均新規加稅、行方因鑒於十二月份起有關稅附加一成之說、故受手頗盛、</p>
<h3>南北貨黑瓜子逐步轉漲</h3>
<p>黑瓜子邇來以地價逐步轉緊到貨甚稀、查市上存底亦屬不多故申市上下檔貨無不見漲、最近中牟子開過十七兩、而天津子以各行均有採辦、價已漲起二三兩、昨市行盤上檔如濟魁子須二十四兩、濟中子二十二兩、徐魁子廿兩、以次自十九兩至十二兩不　各行手存單薄者、均觀望不售後市非有大批到貨、絶少鬆望云、</p>
<h3>絲茶浙湖白廠經運滬五十件</h3>
<p>預備本月底交解歐莊之期絲</p>
<p>浙湖模範絲廠、改良白廠經條份、色澤匀潔、頗爲歐美各莊所　購、本月份承抛絲額有限、除已交解外、前日又裝到大通橋等牌白廠經五十件、預備今日交解洋莊之本月份期絲、業由該廠申莊提回整理以便今日交解云、</p>
<h3>歐美絲銷續靜</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、續呈疲靜、查里昻白廠經電報雖有少數轉滬、而來價反跌、紐約復電未至、市氣沉寂、昨祇　孚等進川黄廠經十五包、三星進棉搖經三包、克昌等進組黄絲十三包、價仍不振云、</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶歐銷暢達</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、路莊土莊等路之針眉綠茶、錦隆怡和協和源生等行、均起搜買、交易頗形暢旺婺源人帮、美銷呆滯已久、日來華茶錦降等行、亦有零星拆進、惟市價均跌六七兩至十餘兩不等、貢熙一項、存底亦已枯薄、僅珍眉綠茶、尙有萬餘箱、去路依然呆滯云、</p>
<h3>五金法西釘新貨有到</h3>
<p>法西釘自四川帮狂辦後底存即告寥落、故在後之欲添辦者、幾有無貨又購之概、昨日浦東新太古棧裝到新貨有四千餘桶、致市場前途又呈活潑氣象矣、開價統花色估八兩七錢半、單吊行情則開　二三錢不等云、</p>
<h3>青鉛久疲不振</h3>
<p>青鉛市面、自出口帮停辦後、市晚　久寂、最近雖各同業竭力兜銷、但終以去路不暢、况土鉛又頻疊面來、海外定價又復萎靡、故市情殊覺有疲軟、計每張價估十四兩七錢半、土鉛估十四兩五錢云、</p>
<h3>煤炭大同煤到貨大减</h3>
<p>在同烟煤塊屑各貨、自日煤抵制以來、本埠銷路頗暢、詎近兩週來此問到貨驟减致各棧存煤大缺、究其原因、蓋目下天津水小、裝盤頗感不便之故、而日來售開市價、遂亦堅俏異常、昨日市塲盤價、計篩塊煤每噸十六兩七錢半、統煤十六兩二錢半、煤屑十三兩七錢半云、</p>

<h3>火的秋晨</h3>
<p>— 絡芒</p>
<p>朦朧間把被頭扯開、從窗際送進來銀白的曙色、帶着一陣爽利的寒風、身體跟着起了一陣寒戰、於是神志也清爽了、</p>
<p>掀開温暖的被、穿好衣服、外面的風在呼呼地吼着、這是秋秩的早晨、</p>
<p>走到窗邊、向廣大的操塲看去、那裏的人已很多了、就在這時候、剌耳的一聲忽哨在呌着、他急忙走出宿舍、向操塲跑去、</p>
<p>空氣是刺骨的冷、同學們都有點冷縮的樣子、口唇有點發黑、他伸手拿起木槍、一陣風吹過、統身不禁起了一層雞皮、丨丨然而、冷有何足怕呢、他有的是一顆火樣的心、任是外面怎樣的冷、越冷、他的内裏是越像火樣的熾熱、</p>
<p>敎官高聲地把號令喝着、</p>
<p>他的熾熱的心在體内劇烈跳躍着、整副的血管都在有力地伸張着、整個的軀體像藏有無限的力量、即刻就要暴發出來、他張開口、吐出一陣陣的熱氣、像要把這個冷的周遭都弄成火樣的熾熱、</p>
<p>他立正、雙足挺直着挺直、全身的力量立刻像向下面伸張、灌注到足跟、灌注到趾尖、下面没有再伸張的餘地了、就像要把這地壳踹陷下去、</p>
<p>風把樹打得沙沙地呌着、葉從枝上飄飄地跌到地上來、草瑟　地抖着、枯枝、那权枒的枯枝就像是敵人的爪、在他眼前飛舞着、要向他撲來的樣子、他憤恨地、熱血塡胸地拿起木槍、像是敵人稍一走近他、他就非把他們殺盡不可、他的手指凍得有的僵了、然而、他有的是一顆火樣的心、冷、冷能夠使他退縮不前麽、</p>
<p>敎官高聲地把號令喝着、</p>
<p>濃雲密罩着整個的天空、太陽失却了他的光與熱、周遭更見得陰沉、冷寂、可是、在這廣大的操塲、這操場上的他們、自有他們的光、自有他們的熱、他們要仗他們的光與熱、來衝破這周遭的陰沉、冷寂、渲染成一個有生氣的景色、</p>
<p>他們托槍、他們瞄準、他把槍口對着前面遠遠的一支電燈桿、好像這電燈桿就是敵人、他眼裏冒着火星、恨不得走前去、把剌刀剮穿敵人的胸瞠、戮碎敵人的心膽、把敵人的血來洗凈祖國的恥辱、來澆熄懷中的怒火、假如他手中的槍不是假的的話、那末、他便要讓一顆顆的子彈飛過去、把敵人前仆後繼的殺個不留、</p>
<p>他們演習衝鋒、</p>
<p>他回視他的伙伴丨丨他的同學、中華民國的國民、一個個的顔面都耀着雪恥的光輝、一個個的心房都煽着殺敵的火燄他心裏說、一伙伴、我們一齊殺上去罷、從敵人的手裏、奪回我們的生存、奪回我們的幸福、奪回我們的光榮、一切一切、都不能讓牠失掉、最少、我們也要把白骨堆成高大的堡壘、要把赤血流成深闊的濠河、來阻住敵人的進路、一切一切、我們都不能讓他失掉、」</p>
<p>這前面的一列矮樹、好像是適人的陣地、這飄搖擺動的枝葉、好像是躍躍欲動的敵人、「伙伴、我們殺過去、把敵人的營陣踹成平地、我們忘了自已、忘了一切殺過去、殺過去從敵人手裏奪回祖國的光榮、」一個個的血潮高漲着、混着衝破沉寂的喊殺聲、如春潮的一片、向敵人的陣地溢過去、</p>
<p>敎官高聲地把號令喝着、</p>
<h3>風塵</h3>
<p>— 透眞</p>
<p>她手中抱着那肥嫩的小孩、在淡黄色的日光剛普照着大地的時候、到我的家裏來、我手中正握着那按時送來的報紙、用很急切的眼光、注視着那展開的報紙、觸目驚心的文字一個一個很明晣地映入我底眼簾、當我一行一行的看下去、熱血不住的沸騰着、她突然地來了、截住了那報紙給我的印象、不由得不使我用驚奇的眼光望着她、</p>
<p>她不久從廣州到上海、由上海到南京還没有十天呢、我知道她在南京方將新租的房屋佈置就緒咧、</p>
<p>「蓉、你來上海玩嗎、我很歡迎你、」我用一種上海的普通許問她、一面讓坐、</p>
<p>「今天到的嗎、」我繼續着問、</p>
<p>「不、」她一面坐下一面回答我、</p>
<p>「我是昨晚五時到的、住在公寓裏、我不是來玩的、我是來……」她囁嚅着、「他一定要我來、因爲她們丨丨同事的家眷丨丨都已來上海了、」</p>
<p>我就立刻知道她來的原因、大概恐怕有類似東三省的事情發生在南京罷、所以不避辛苦帶着那未滿週歲的小孩來上海、獨自住在公寓裏、我的住屋是在南市、是危險所及的地方、當然是她不願意住的了、我也不便留她住了、</p>
<p>她在旅館裏住不到十天、僅僅七天丨丨一星期丨丨她想回去了、她因爲不能再忍受那每晚的囂擾、尤其是那拍拍的牌聲、可以說是澈夜不息的、不時的使她懷中的小孩驚跳而哭、她再不能忍受下去了、於是在第八天的早晨、搭着九時半的特别快車到南京去了、南京依然如故、倒可憐了她的僕僕風塵、</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Assist Zhang HaiPeng in Plotting Against Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>Zhang HaiPeng Sneaks Back to Taonan to Expand His Forces</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Declares Strict Adherence to a Policy of Non-Interference</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway (SMR) to Sign Secret Agreement with the Puppet Committee</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Use the Pretext of Suppressing Bandits to Secretly Assist Zhang HaiPeng's Troops</h3>
<p>Zhang HaiPeng Sneaks Back to Taonan</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Circle Over Tailai</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japan, under the guise of bandit suppression, has dispatched a large detachment of troops from Zhengjiatun to Taonan to secretly assist Zhang HaiPeng in attacking Heilongjiang province again. Honjo has sent two individuals to Heilongjiang to pressure Ma Zhanshan to hand over political power to Zhang HaiPeng, but Ma has refused. These two individuals are still awaiting a reply at the Japanese consulate. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Harbin, Zhang HaiPeng has secretly returned to Taonan and is gathering defeated troops to form the General Headquarters of the Jilin-Heilongjiang Border Defense Army. Zhang also plans to establish an administrative office of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government in Taonan, scheduled to be established on the 1st. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Heilongjiang province is experiencing severe wind and rain, extremely cold weather, and soaring prices. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese side will use the excuse of repairing the Taonan-Angangxi Railway Jiangqiao bridge to send troops along the railway to protect Zhang HaiPeng's army and occupy Heilongjiang. A portion of He Duomen's division, along with 600 men from the Gongzhuling Mori garrison, has been transferred from the Siping-Taonan Railway. The situation in Heilongjiang remains critical. Zhang HaiPeng is actively preparing for war and has recruited a large number of Mongolian bandits, who will be organized into three brigades, intending to weaken Heilongjiang's military preparedness. On the 28th, he telegraphed Ma Zhanshan, stating that he had decided not to attack Heilongjiang again. The Chief of Staff of the Heilongjiang National Defense Department returned to Heilongjiang on the 28th, reporting that Zhang HaiPeng was recruiting various Mongolian and Han bandits and planned to attack Heilongjiang along two routes once the Nenjiang River froze. The Japanese Consul in Heilongjiang issued a protest on the 28th, stating that the Taonan-Angangxi Railway is a South Manchuria Railway loan railway and has significant implications for transportation and economic matters. If this situation is allowed to continue, the Chinese side's independent repair of the bridges is considered absolutely impossible. Therefore, the South Manchuria Railway, which has a close relationship, has decided to immediately dispatch personnel to begin repair work and hopes that the Jiangxi Provincial Army will not obstruct it and will provide appropriate protection. If this repair work is obstructed, the Japanese side will take appropriate measures. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese Consul in Heilongjiang, Shimizu, lodged a protest on the 29th because the Heilongjiang Provincial Government refused the South Manchuria Railway's dispatch of workers to repair the Taonan-Angangxi Railway bridge. On the afternoon of the 27th, two Japanese planes flew over Tailai Town, circling over Wu's troop barracks for a long time, conducting reconnaissance, but did not drop any bombs before leaving. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang HaiPeng is expanding his forces into three brigades, but the number of personnel is insufficient, so they are being supplemented with newly recruited bandits. Zhang and his son, Zhi Ming, have each had an infantry brigade, and Jing Guofen, the cavalry regiment commander, has been promoted to cavalry brigade commander. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Wan Guobin, a commissioner from the Heilongjiang province, has arrived in Harbin. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xinmin: Personnel returning from an inspection of Sipingjie reported that at least thirteen train cars of military equipment and ammunition, as well as five cars of military uniforms, have been unloaded within Taonan territory for Zhang HaiPeng's troops. Zhang Dening declared independence on the Mongolian border and sent troops to invade Qiqihar. The official also stated that the above-mentioned military equipment was transported by the Japanese and that the ammunition was manufactured by the Shenyang Arsenal and the uniforms by the Shenyang Military Uniform Factory. It is reported that Fei Laihuo, a famous bandit leader on the Mongolian border, has received a large supply of military equipment and has attacked Mongolians within the border, defeating them west of Zhengjiatun. Zhang HaiPeng's intentions are unclear, but his son is inclined to be pro-Japanese. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Uses the Puppet Committee on Communications to Resolve Railway Issues</h3>
<p>South Manchuria Railway to Sign Secret Agreement with the Committee on Communications</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Northeast Committee on Communications, instigated by Japan and composed of Ding Jianxiu, Kan Duo, Jin Bi Dong, Wan Chengzhang, and Zhao Xinbo, has been established. Japan will use this organization to fundamentally resolve all railway issues between China and Japan. The South Manchuria Railway Company is extremely satisfied as a result. Uchida and Eguchi will soon return from Japan to Dalian and then come to Shenyang to sign various secret agreements with the committee. The South Manchuria Railway's base of operations will be moved to Shenyang, and several directors will be stationed in Shenyang alternately. Yuan Jinkai's Committee on Communications, in addition to the South Manchuria Railway, the Beining Railway, and the Chinese Eastern Railway, will have jurisdiction over all railways in the Northeast. The committee is taking a clearly cooperative attitude toward the South Manchuria Railway. The highest advisor to the committee will be selected by the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, all loan railways will be registered with the South Manchuria Railway and will be managed using either a joint operation or a entrusted operation method. The so-called "South Manchuria Railway encirclement" problem can be resolved as a result. Our Northeast railway problem will be completely betrayed by three or four traitors. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Unable to Maintain Security in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Military Deployment is Actively Underway</p>
<p>Travelers Still Subject to Strict Inspection</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from foreigners in Shenyang, robberies are occurring frequently in Shenyang, and gunfire continues unabated at night. Japanese authorities are unable to maintain security. The market is increasingly depressed. Although the Japanese are vigorously promoting an independent government, and Prince Gong is extremely active, it is feared that it will not be easily established. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army in Shenyang is actively carrying out military deployments and defensive works. Travelers to and from the Juluhe to Huanggu Tun section are still subjected to strict inspections. Anyone carrying a business card with a title or an envelope is liable to be killed by the Japanese army. The Xinmin Railway Station, after negotiations between the Railway Bureau and the Japanese army, has been approved to have our railway police stationed there. However, apart from the Japanese consulate and the Japanese army, there are no military or police personnel in the county streets, and bandits are looting wantonly. About one company of Japanese artillery is stationed in Juluhe, building barracks and digging trenches. One company of Japanese cavalry is stationed in Masanjiazi. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army in Shenyang continues to inspect pedestrians as usual. A few days ago, the Japanese army searched various letters and books in the Northeast Printing Bureau. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to today's public announcement by the Japanese, the Japanese army is currently encountering difficulties in its bandit suppression work. The Japanese military headquarters today decided to find ways to restore the safety of the Zhengjiatun-Tongliao railway traffic. It is reported that yesterday morning, 900 Koreans fled from Tongliao to Zhengjiatun, reporting large-scale looting by bandits. General Huang, the former police chief of Shenyang, is currently in Jinzhou, reorganizing scattered soldiers into a public security team for the purpose of suppressing bandits. Last night, bandits and Japanese soldiers fought near the Shenyang Arsenal, with one Japanese soldier injured and three bandits killed. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Karakhan Denies Russian Military Activity</h3>
<p>Replying to Questions from Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Hirota</p>
<p>Declares Respect for Chinese Sovereignty and Independence</p>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, Japanese Ambassador Hirota visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan and delivered a warning, stating that if reports of Soviet Russian military activity in Manchuria were indeed true, Japan would be forced to expand the scope of the dispute from South Manchuria to North Manchuria. Today, Karakhan invited Hirota to the Foreign Ministry to personally reply, strongly denying reports of Soviet Russia sending troops to Manchuria and providing instructors and ammunition. According to a statement released by the Russian government today, Ambassador Hirota visited Karakhan yesterday, representing the Japanese government, and stated that recent rumors in Manchuria were rampant, alleging that the Soviet government was assisting General Ma Zhanshan, providing military instructors and ammunition, and requested that the Soviet Russian government pay attention to external rumors that Ma Zhanshan himself had declared that 20,000 to 30,000 Russian soldiers were concentrating at Dauri Station, intending to enter Manchuria, which was enough to provoke the Japanese public and the authorities of the Japanese army in Manchuria. Finally, he stated that if Soviet Russia sent troops to the Chinese Eastern Railway, Japan would also send troops to the Taonan-Angangxi Railway, which was built with Japanese funds, and that if this were the case, the scope of the conflict would be expanded. Today, Karakhan invited Hirota to the Foreign Ministry and, representing the Russian government, stated that the Soviet government could not but be surprised by Ambassador Hirota's statement of October 28 on behalf of the Japanese government. This statement was based on absolutely unfounded rumors, fabricated entirely by irresponsible Japanese and Chinese parties, who intentionally spread rumors, provoked both sides, and profited from it. The Japanese government could not but know that there were no Soviet instructors in the Longjiang garrison or any other troops in Manchuria, and the Japanese government could not but know that these troops had not received any Soviet Russian military equipment or ammunition, nor was there any such supply at this time. The Japanese government also could not but know that the Soviet government did not assist any of the parties to the Manchurian dispute. The Soviet government strictly adhered to a policy of non-interference, not to curry favor with anyone, but purely out of respect for the international treaties signed between the Soviet Russia and China, and respect for the sovereignty and independence of other countries. Therefore, the Soviet Russian government deeply believed that a policy of military occupation, even if it could be justified by the pretext of assistance, was incompatible with the Soviet Russia's peace policy and the maintenance of world peace. It was hoped that this reply would cover all the issues mentioned in Ambassador Hirota's statement of October 28. (29th Kuomintang Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Japan received reports of Russian military activity on the Manchurian border. Japan sent troops to Taonan to secretly assist Zhang HaiPeng's troops. ⊙ Soviet Russia denied Russian military activity on the Manchurian border ⊙ (See Domestic Important Telegrams) Tensions between Poland and Lithuania ⊙ The United States Accepts the Suggestion of a One-Year Military Reduction Rest ⊙ (See Foreign Important Telegrams) The Preparatory Meeting of Representatives from Beijing and Guangdong Passed the Principles of Reforming the Central Political System ⊙ (See Local News)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>...was quite apprehensive. Today, he specially made a serious representation to the Russian government on this matter. Hirota, the Japanese ambassador to Russia, formally visited Karakhan, the Russian Foreign Minister, and stated that rumors of Soviet Russian activity in Manchuria were causing disturbing effects in Japan. Following instructions from Foreign Minister Shidehara, he requested that Soviet Russia cease activities that could cause military panic. According to a TASS communication, the Japanese ambassador stated that various rumors were rampant within Manchuria, alleging that the Russian government was providing military assistance to Chairman Ma of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, supplying ammunition and other materials, and that Chairman Ma himself had claimed that 20,000 to 40,000 Russian soldiers were gathering near Dauri Station, preparing to enter Manchuria. Such rumors were causing unrest among the Japanese public and the Japanese military authorities in Manchuria. If Russian troops were indeed sent to the Chinese Eastern Railway, Japan would also send troops to the Taoqi Railway, which was built with Japanese funds, and that if this were the case, the scope of the conflict would be further expanded. Karakhan replied that these reports were not true, that the rumors were completely unfounded, fabricated by irresponsible parties who wanted to spread provocative rumors about the situation in Manchuria. In fact, there were no Soviet instructors in any army in Qiqihar or other provinces in Manchuria, and that troops there had never received any military equipment or ammunition shipped from Russia. The Soviet Russian government had never assisted any aspect of the military forces opposing Manchuria, not only that, but the Soviet Russia also maintained a strict policy of non-interference, because the Soviet Russia respected the international treaties signed with China. At the end of the TASS communication, it was stated that the Russian government hoped that Karakhan's reply had covered all the issues raised by the Japanese ambassador. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The remarks made by Russian Foreign Minister Karakhan to the Japanese ambassador to Russia that Soviet Russia intended to adhere to a strict policy of non-interference had made Japan relieved. The Japanese Foreign Ministry had not immediately believed that rumors of Soviet Russian military activity and Sino-Russian agreements were true, but Karakhan's definitive statement that these rumors were completely unfounded was particularly welcome, as it provided an additional layer of assurance. Disturbing rumors continued to circulate, but the Foreign Ministry, based on statements received from Moscow, clearly believed that Soviet Russia sincerely intended to maintain a neutral attitude, as long as its interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway were not infringed upon. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Criticizes Japan</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Communist Party's newspaper Pravda launched a scathing attack on Japanese Prime Minister Wakatsuki, stating that Wakatsuki's remarks to American journalists, pointing out that the Manchurian Incident was triggered by China's aggression against Japan and complaining about China's economic boycott of Japan, were intended to distort the situation, as if China was the initiator of the occupation of Manchuria. The entire working class of the world witnessed the shameless plunder of China by Japanese imperialists, and Wakatsuki's complaints were no less than a solemn expression of his desire to annex the territory of other countries, so that no one would dare to resist or interfere. Wakatsuki claimed that Japan had preserved Manchuria from Imperial Russia for China in 1905, which was the most incredible statement in the world. It was necessary to know that Japan immediately colonized South Manchuria after expelling Imperial Russia, and the Japanese imperialists' control of South Manchuria created today's actions, with the aim of expanding the sphere of activity of Japanese imperialists.

<h3>Russian Consul in Harbin Asks the Japanese Side to Pay Attention to Harbin-Manchuria Transportation</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Russian Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been summoned back to his country. The Russian Consul in Harbin, Ye Shi, visited the Japanese Consul in Harbin today, asking them to pay attention to transportation on the Harbin-Manchuria line. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Boxes Stored in Japanese Barracks in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) 317 boxes of the private property of Deputy Zhang, which were transported by the Japanese army to Tanggu, were transported to the Japanese barracks at the Tianjin Haiguang Temple for storage yesterday because Zhang refused to receive them. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) 417 boxes of Zhang Xueliang's private property, confiscated by the Japanese army in Shenyang, were transported to Tanggu last week. 100 boxes were transported to Beiping, but Zhang refused to accept them. The remaining 317 boxes were transported to Tianjin by barge on the afternoon of the 29th and temporarily stored in the Haiguang Temple Japanese barracks. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Occupy Emu County</h3>
<p>(Harbin) On the 28th, more than 20 train cars of Japanese troops arrived at Emu County on the Jidun Line and occupied the county. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Cables Gilchrist to Inquire</h3>
<p>Regarding the Non-Aggression Pact Obligations Note</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. State Department cabled Gilchrist, the U.S. Consul in Geneva, who was attending the League of Nations as an observer, to inquire about the reasons why the replies of China and Japan to the European countries regarding the note reminding them of their obligations under the Non-Aggression Pact had not been published. (29th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Our Country Expresses Gratitude to Lerroux</h3>
<p>Spain, Capital - This morning, when the radical faction of the Spanish parliament was meeting in the House of Representatives, they spoke about the Sino-Japanese negotiations. The Chinese envoy to Spain, representing the Chinese government, expressed gratitude to the Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux for intervening in the Manchurian Incident during Lerroux's presidency of the League of Nations' Administrative Council. Lerroux replied with a brief speech. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Prepares to Intercept Salt Taxes from Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japan wants to establish a new regime in the Northeast, and the current active efforts are in Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces. Liaoning is under its control, while Heilongjiang still awaits military conquest. Its increase in troops in Taonan is intended for this purpose. The establishment of a new government is crucial to finance. Therefore, Japan has decided to move the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office of the three eastern provinces from Yingkou to Shenyang, and all salt tax revenues, after repaying foreign debts, will be handed over to the new provincial government under the protection of Japan, as a source of political expenses. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ling Yinqing's Bandit Troops Attempt to Attack Jinxi Counties</h3>
<p>The Number of Bandits Reaches Over 50,000</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Gifts Two Airplanes</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese are instigating Ling Yinqing to recruit bandits in various places in the Northeast, with the number reaching over 50,000. They currently occupy the area east of the South Manchuria Railway, including Liaoyang, Haicheng, Xiuyan, and Gaiping, and have established a puppet headquarters in Panshan. Recently, they have received a gift of two airplanes and a large number of guns and artillery from the Japanese army. They will soon attack the Jinxi counties to the west. Because the South Manchuria Railway runs through the middle, it is extremely difficult for the Chinese army to suppress them. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Vigorously Refutes the Japanese Declaration's Fallacies</h3>
<p>The Point of Contention Lies in the Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>New York - A few days ago, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun in Japan published an article by Motoyama, vigorously defending the Japanese army's occupation of Liaoning and Jilin. On the one hand, it claimed that Japan held an open-door policy in Manchuria, and on the other hand, it demanded that Japan have the right to invoke the Monroe Doctrine in the Far East, and strongly argued that Japan had not violated the Non-Aggression Pact. At that time, the New York World News and other 24 newspapers of the Scripps Howard system carried this news. Today, the New York World News specifically published a long article to vigorously refute its fallacies, saying that if anyone could defend Japan's actions in Manchuria, the editor of the Mainichi Shimbun would of course be excellent at it. Unfortunately, its frank words may convince some readers that Japan's actions are not foolish, but they cannot convince us. The treaty rights in Manchuria that Motoyama claimed Japan had obtained from a defeated Russia, and the fact that China had repeatedly attempted to undermine Japan's interests in Manchuria, must know that the facts cited in the article were all expressed by the Japanese in a way that benefited them. Not only could China not accept it, but American experts would probably reject it. As for saying that since the United States had implemented the Monroe Doctrine in Latin America, there was nothing wrong with Japan doing the same in Manchuria, this was not worth answering. Even if Japan's actions this time were indeed provoked by China, it should not have refused neutral countries to investigate and mediate. The Kellogg-Briand Pact could not be limited to those who waged war. Japan had not declared war on China and could not invoke the Pact's rhetoric and disregard it. Therefore, Japan's military actions could not be regarded as a peaceful way to resolve disputes with China. Motoyama also said that Japan's doctrine on Manchuria was just, and it was necessary to know that the point of contention today was not here, but on the Non-Aggression Treaty. The newspaper concluded by saying that if the world united to resist Japan because of the Non-Aggression Treaty, what would be the benefit of Japan's attempt to obtain Manchuria?

<h3>The Government Will Issue a Declaration to Correct the Japanese Statement</h3>

<h3>Xi Qia's Public Telegram of Self-Confession</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Xi Qia, knowing that he is not tolerated by the Chinese people, specially issued a public telegram of self-confession, saying, in brief, that he was forced by the circumstances to temporarily organize a Chief Executive Office, hoping for the unity of the entire province and awaiting future resolutions. He believed that his talent was meager, but he dared to take on a difficult task. However, because local people entrusted him with righteousness, and there was no one to take responsibility at that time, he had no choice but to reluctantly take on the task. All of this was truly unavoidable, and his heart could be understood by all. The leaders of all agencies and the county magistrates of all counties, as well as the directors of all tax bureaus, have all worked together for many years. In this precarious situation, they should prioritize the local people, respectfully perform their duties, and overcome difficulties together. This is what he deeply hoped for. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>British Political Party Leaders' Prioritization of Country Over Party</h3>
<p>The results of the British general election have now been revealed to the world. The most admirable and remarkable aspect of this is that in this election, the government faction occupied an overwhelming majority. The leaders and members of all parties were willing to sacrifice their party's position and political prejudices, express absolute trust in the government, and support the government in order to overcome the country's current difficulties and consolidate the position of the national government. After the election results were revealed, MacDonald issued a statement to the whole country, saying, "The government's unprecedented majority should make the world know that the British people are always united in responding to the country's request for assistance." Snowden also said, "Britain's position in the world has been greatly consolidated by this election. The majority supporting the national government is not a party's, but a national victory." Conservative Party leader Baldwin said, "The country has won a great victory. This is not a party victory. Our people's patriotism has now been revealed to foreigners. When voting, they have declared in a clear voice that partisanship cannot withstand the general desire for national cooperation in times of national emergency." Samuel of the National Liberal Party also said, "Great power in Parliament is now in the hands of the leaders of the Conservative Party, but this great power is given to the members of the national government to handle unanimously agreed-upon affairs, not any one party's affairs." All of the speeches of the leaders of the parties abandoned their party's interests and took the country's interests as a prerequisite for consolidating the newly established national government. We still remember that after the British Emperor signed the order to dissolve Parliament on October 7, he issued a decree to the people, saying, "I deeply believe that the people have a responsibility to do their best to cope with the restoration of their country's prosperity." Today, the fact that the election results have lived up to the Emperor's expectations is enough to show the sound political training of the British people and the development of their patriotic ideas, and the nobility and soundness of their political organization and election system are especially worthy of praise from the world.</p>
<p>Since recent years, Britain's national fortunes have been declining, industry has been withering, trade has been declining, finances have been tight, unemployment has been increasing, and domestic troops have shown instability from time to time. Abroad, colonies have also been resisting for self-government and independence from time to time. The national situation has been declining. "Aging Britain, the setting sun of Britain" The whole world has made such observations on the advanced capitalist country of Britain. However, judging from the spirit of British parties sacrificing party views and cooperating sincerely today, as well as the British people's supervision and active responsibility for national affairs, it shows that Britain's international position is very solid and its national future is just beginning.</p>
<p>Here, we cannot help but deeply sigh about the current situation in our country. Today, our country is facing internal difficulties in floods and external pressure from strong neighbors. The national lifeline is in danger. The Kuomintang is in power with one party and no other party checks and balances. However, for many years, disputes have been rife and chaos has followed one after another. The source of the chaos, if it is said to be party views and political views, is undoubtedly the personal prejudices. Now, in this unprecedented crisis, the so-called situation of peace and unification is still difficult to produce. The Ning and Guangdong parties are still facing each other. Could it be that the leaders of the British parties can prioritize the country over the party, sacrifice the party's position to face the national crisis together, but the leaders of the Chinese Kuomintang cannot sacrifice personal prejudices to save the party, which is as dangerous as piled-up eggs, and to save the country on the line of life and death? Alas.</p>

<h3>Proposals for Party and Government Reform Drafted by Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Central Government Believes They Violate the Party Constitution</p>
<p>Should Not Be Discussed at This Time</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Central News Agency, on the morning of the 28th, the Guangdong representatives submitted a proposal for party and government reform before the meeting. Cai Yuanpei and others considered this matter to be of great importance and did not allow it to be discussed. The original proposal was telegraphed to the Central Government. The Central Government replied in a telegram, stating, in essence, that regardless of the content of the proposal for party and government reform, its spirit was not in line with the main purpose of uniting against foreign aggression. At this time, for the sake of the party and the country, the only thing to do is to gather in the capital and jointly overcome the national crisis. As for the fundamental issues of party and government, they should be discussed and resolved by a majority of the party. There is no reason to decide on major national plans for the whole party and the whole country through discussions by a dozen people in Shanghai. Since people are already party members, they must abide by the party constitution together. As fellow citizens, they should respond to the national crisis. If loving the party and saving the country comes from sincerity and is not for the purpose of dividing up power and wealth as rumored outside, such proposals that violate the party constitution and disregard the national crisis should not be put forward for discussion, so as not to betray the hopes of the people. The proposals drafted by Guangdong are recorded below:</p>
<p>Proposals for Party and Government Reform drafted by Guangdong: (1) Regarding the unified conference and the conference of the unified government: A.

Schedule: To be held immediately after the conclusion of the unified government conference. (2) Regarding political matters: 1.

The National Government shall establish a National Defense Committee, with a number of members appointed by the National Government and designating 3 to 7 standing committee members. 2. The National Defense Committee does not directly issue orders. All military orders are issued by the National Government. 3.

(5) Regarding the local system: 1.

<h3>The Central Government Announces the Peace Process with Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The arrival of the Guangdong representatives in Shanghai to discuss peace and unity has attracted much attention from the people. Regarding this matter, in late September, the Central Government, considering the urgency of the national crisis and the need for unity against foreign aggression, Chiang Kai-shek personally sent a letter to Wang Jingwei, Gu Mengyu, and Sun Ke, entrusting Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Puquan, and Chen Zhenru to bring it to Guangzhou, asking them to work together to save the country from danger, and orally conveyed three principles. After Cai and others arrived in Hong Kong, they sent a telegram on the 29th, reporting on two agreed-upon measures: (1) Chiang Kai-shek issues a circular telegram stating his resignation due to the agreement on unified government measures, and the Guangdong side also issues a circular telegram expressing its willingness to go to Beijing for a meeting, cancel the Guangzhou government, and not make Chiang Kai-shek's resignation a condition; (2) Change the garrison organization of Nanjing and Shanghai. They then sent another telegram hoping that Chen Mingshu would be responsible for the garrison of Nanjing and Shanghai. After receiving the telegram, the Central Government immediately made the appointment and sent a telegram to report it. On October 1st, Cai and others sent another telegram stating that the circular telegrams must be published on the 5th. Chiang Kai-shek replied on the 2nd, reiterating the three principles and hoping to invite them to come quickly. Afterwards, there were several exchanges and consultations. The Guangdong representatives arrived in Shanghai on the 21st of this month. However, the Central Government is eager for them to come to Beijing as soon as possible to jointly overcome the national crisis. The letters and telegrams sent by Cai and others to Hong Kong a month ago are excerpted below to show the initial consultation process.</p>
<p>(1) Chiang Kai-shek's letter to Wang Jingwei, Gu Mengyu, Sun Ke, etc., forwarded to all comrades by Jingwei, Xiangqin, Zhesheng, and others: Unfortunately, the party and the country are facing successive natural and man-made disasters. Recently, the Northeast has been invaded and plundered, the army has been defeated, and the country is in imminent danger. Our party, inheriting the teachings of Sun Yat-sen and entrusted by the people, has led the country into deep water and fire, and the fate of the nation is about to be lost. The guilt is severe, and how can we face Sun Yat-sen and the people? Looking around the party, we are aroused by emotional disputes and mistakes, each going to extremes, resulting in today's tragic disaster of national hatred. The grief is extreme. Today, fellow countrymen are weeping and telling each other that there is no way to save the country from danger without the whole country working together. Moreover, we share the revolutionary mission, so what cannot be sacrificed? Let us all overcome the national crisis. As a country for three years, the sins have accumulated. The rights and wrongs of the past, I am willing to bear them alone. What more can I ask for? I only hope that all comrades will put the party first, think of the imminent danger, reflect on themselves, meet each other with sincerity, and not let past grudges become obstacles. Let us save this tragic disaster of a leaking boat and a collapsing nest, lest the thousands of years of the divine race be cut off from us, and the tragedy of national subjugation be attributed to Sun Yat-sen's disregard for internal strife and the neglect of the national crisis. Then I will regard humiliation as a special honor. I specially entrust comrades Cai, Zhang, and Chen to go to Hong Kong to discuss everything. This paper cannot exhaust my sincere blood in the slightest. Zhenru must convey the requests of all comrades here in a roundabout way, and fully represent them. (This letter was handed over to the three representatives Cai, Zhang, and Chen to carry.)</p>
<p>(2) Telegram from Zhang, Cai, and Chen after arriving in Hong Kong: To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Shu and others arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. Comrade Fu Bingchang came to the ship to greet us and informed us that comrades Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, and Li Wenfan would arrive in Hong Kong at 5:00 PM. The three comrades arrived as scheduled. We started discussing at 6:00 PM, handed over your handwritten letter, and the three comrades felt your sincerity and exchanged opinions sincerely until 11:00 PM. Although the outline is already available, there are still a few points that are not very well agreed upon. It was agreed to continue the discussion at 9:00 AM this morning. We reconvened at the appointed time and reached an agreement at 11:30 AM: (1) You will issue a circular telegram, citing the urgency of the situation, taking the blame, and stating that you will immediately step down when the unified government measures are agreed upon. The Guangdong side will also issue a circular telegram, also apologizing to the people and saying that only unification can save the country, going to Beijing for a meeting, and canceling the Guangzhou government, and not making your resignation a condition. The two telegrams must be published simultaneously. The drafts of the telegrams are being drafted and will be telegraphed immediately. At present, both parties have instructed party departments and newspapers at all levels to stop mutual attacks. (2) The garrison and guard organization of Nanjing and Shanghai must be changed immediately so that comrades from Guangdong can come to Beijing with peace of mind, take an oath at Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum to hold a meeting, and decide on unified government measures. Is this appropriate? Waiting for instructions. Pei Jishu bows respectfully at noon.</p>
<p>(3) Chiang's telegram to Cai, Zhang, and Chen: To General Commander Chen of Guangzhou, Brother Zhenru, and forwarded to the two gentlemen Cai and Zhang, China has only one government. Only by unifying China can we save the country from foreign aggression. At this time of national survival, we must seek a satisfactory solution in terms of reason and morality. Therefore, I have specially agreed with you on the following three principles: (1) If Guangdong can take full responsibility, then the central comrades can give way completely. Please ask the comrades in Guangdong to move to the capital as a whole and reorganize the government. As for my personal resignation, there is no problem. As long as Guangdong can reliably take over, I can send a telegram to resign. This is the first one. (2) If Guangdong cannot take responsibility, then the Central Government should be responsible for presiding over it, and the Guangdong government should be canceled. The Guangdong comrades should gather in the capital to jointly overcome the national crisis. This is the second one. (3) If all parties want to cooperate, then I would be even more welcome, but they must come to Beijing to discuss it in person. This is the way to be sincere and help each other in the same boat. Apart from these three, if we must make conditional demands, then it is unreasonable, immoral, and contrary to public and private interests. This is not what I want to hear. You have forgotten these three principles and the three words "unconditionally," and you have sent this telegram with no room for negotiation. I don't know what it means, which is really puzzling. Moreover, after the Central Government received your telegram, considering it was beneficial to the party and the country and the basis for cooperation, it immediately appointed Brother Zhen as the garrison commander. This is why we are unwilling to have conditions and eager to cooperate sincerely. Now, if the comrades in Guangdong do not seek a solution in reason, morality, and national crisis, and cannot come here to discuss it in person, then sending a telegram first will only cause more disputes and will not help. I hope you will sincerely discuss this with the comrades based on the above intentions so that it can be resolved completely. Chiang Kai-shek, winter army. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Yan's Telegram Urges Representatives to the Peace Conference to Embrace the Doctrine of Sacrifice</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yan sent a telegram on the 28th to Wang Jingwei, Li Shizeng, Sun Ke, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Dongyun, Zhang Puquan, Li Junpei, Cai Yuanpei, Zou Haibin, Chen Zhenru, Chen Youren, and others, stating, "This peace conference is a critical moment for the survival of the party and the country. If the party remains fragmented and the country remains divided, the party will inevitably cease to be a party, and the country will cease to be a country. I am deeply concerned about this. I sincerely hope that you will both embrace the doctrine of sacrifice, strive to complete the party as a whole, the unified country, and work together to resist foreign aggression to save the country from danger."

<h3>British Cabinet Prepares for Reorganization</h3>
<p>Cabinet Members to Increase to Twenty</p>
<p>A Shift Possible in the Foreign Affairs Portfolio</p>
<p>Industrial Activity Showing Signs of Life</p>
<p>Tariff Policy Determined to Proceed</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - After returning from Buckingham Palace, Prime Minister MacDonald immediately consulted with Lord Sankey, the Lord Chancellor, and Sir William Jowitt, the Attorney General, on procedural matters. Today, he will meet with cabinet members Snowden, Thomas, Baldwin, and Samuel. It is reported that MacDonald is determined to make the new cabinet a completely national one, as the election was a mandate for the National Government, not for any particular party. Therefore, he believes that labor should have adequate representation in the cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - This afternoon, cabinet members reconvened on Downing Street, the first gathering after the election. All attendees were in high spirits and smiling, unlike the initial gatherings of the National Government, which were filled with concern. Samuel of the Liberal Party met with MacDonald for half an hour before the gathering.</p>
<p>It is widely expected that the government's first task will be the reorganization of the cabinet. The pre-election National Cabinet, limited to ten members, was considered insufficient in number. It will now be increased to twenty. Snowden, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had previously stated that he should not be selected, will likely be ennobled as a member of the House of Lords so that he can continue to serve as a cabinet member and assist the government, but he will no longer serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Who will succeed him as Chancellor is yet to be determined. Neville Chamberlain and Sir John Reith are the two most talked about candidates. The former is an important figure in the Conservative Party, and the latter is a shipping magnate, but Neville Chamberlain is considered more likely. There are many rumors circulating, but nothing has been finalized. However, Sir John Simon of the Liberal Party will likely occupy a position in the new cabinet. Newspapers speculate about the cabinet reshuffle, predicting that Baldwin will remain Lord President of the Council, Lister will be President of the Board of Trade, and Snowden, after being ennobled, will be Lord Privy Seal. A shift may also occur in the Foreign Affairs portfolio, currently held by Lord Reading. Lord Hailsham will likely regain his old position, replacing Sankey as Lord Chancellor. As for Secretary of State for War Crew and First Lord of the Admiralty Austen Chamberlain, they may retire to make way for younger people. Prime Minister MacDonald's first public remarks since the reopening of Parliament are likely to be delivered at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London on November 11th. It is anticipated that his words will be highly significant. After the National Government's victory, there is hope for industrial recovery. There are signs of activity in various places. Many British manufacturers are now planning to reorganize their factories to accept new orders, while foreign manufacturers, anticipating a tariff policy, are urgently preparing to establish factories in Britain. Many agents are currently seeking suitable sites. At the same time, it is expected that before restrictions are placed on imported goods, a large number of foreign goods will be dumped into the country. The government must organize a special committee to study economic matters so that it can submit legislation on imported goods as early as possible after the new Parliament opens. However, the real work is likely to be implemented only in late January. Therefore, the government may propose urgent legislation to give it the power to stop dumping.</p>
<h3>Tensions Between Poland and Lithuania</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 29th - Large-scale anti-Lithuanian demonstrations were held simultaneously today in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, and Vilna. The reason is that Lithuania is oppressing the Polish minority within Lithuania. Since these unfortunate events occurred, the Polish and Lithuanian government authorities have repeatedly argued with each other. Now that anti-Lithuanian demonstrations have occurred throughout Poland, Lithuania has requested that they be suppressed, but this request has now been sternly rejected by the Polish government. Therefore, tensions between Poland and Lithuania have greatly increased again.</p>
<h3>United States Accepts One-Year Arms Stoppage Proposal</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th - The United States has accepted the League of Nations proposal for a one-year suspension of arms construction. Today, the US government telegraphed its approval of this plan to Geneva.</p>
<h3>Establishment of German Economic Advisory Council</h3>
<p>Parliament Approves Minting of New Silver Coins</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 29th - Today, the advisory council of the German President's Office held its first meeting. President Hindenburg delivered a very sincere speech, urging the nation to unite. Hindenburg said that the hope for Germany's future is closely related to changes in the international community. The global political and economic situation is the foundation of Germany's political and economic situation. Therefore, Germany's diplomatic policy focuses on this point. However, diplomatic policy alone cannot place the nation on a solid foundation. The responsibility of the people is not reduced as a result. Therefore, regardless of the international situation or the state of the country, domestic unity is paramount. Everyone must exert their efforts, overcome differences, and cooperate internationally, starting domestically. Only in this way can we hope for the restoration of the motherland. After Hindenburg's speech, Prime Minister Brüning outlined the winter defense plan. Finance Minister Warmbold and the President of the German National Bank, Luther, also expressed their sincere views on the current situation. The Presidential Advisory Council was recently established and will subsequently meet once a day in a closed-door format.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 30th - The German Parliament has approved the minting of new silver coins up to a value of 120 million marks in order to assist the National Bank in managing the gold standard and reducing the amount of paper currency. This measure is in accordance with a policy that has been in progress for some time. Since the implementation of this policy, the import of silver bars has increased greatly.</p>
<h3>Pilsudski Suddenly Returns Home</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 30th - General Pilsudski of Poland suddenly returned home today after visiting Romania for two weeks to continue the Polish-Romanian military alliance. He had originally planned to stay in the Romanian capital for at least three weeks and then travel to Egypt. The sudden return caused widespread surprise and suspicion. Some said that the government, in light of the widespread strikes, feared that they would cause domestic political unrest and asked Pilsudski to return to restore order. Others said that Pilsudski had to return to the capital due to the results of the British general election.</p>

<h3>After Zhang Haipeng's Failure</h3>
<p>The Japanese Use Mongolian Bandits and Korean Ruffians to Cause Trouble</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The purpose of the Japanese military advance this time is to create a new separatist government in the three northeastern provinces to serve as a tool of their imperialism. Before the League of Nations issued its recommendations, they had already created the Jilin Chief Executive Office of Xi Qia and the maintenance associations of 鬫朝璽 (Kan Chao-hsi) and others. Although these two organizations do not have much power, they can still use a donkey to scare the Northeastern people with a tiger skin. However, Heilongjiang Province has Wan Guobin, the son of Wan Fulin, sitting in charge, and it has remained unmoved. The Special District of Eastern Province also has relations with Soviet Russia, so they have been unable to do as they wish. Therefore, they took the opportunity to control the Siping-Taonan and Taonan-Ang'angxi railways to create a new evil force. Zhang Haipeng, the garrison commander of Taonan, was deceived by them.</p>
<p>Zhang Haipeng was originally on the same level as Zhang Zuolin, Zhang Zuoxiang, and Zhang Jinghui. After the founding of the Republic of China, Zhang Zuolin became the Grand Marshal, and Zhang Zuoxiang and Zhang Jinghui had reached the highest ranks, but he was still only a garrison commander in a remote area. He was truly unwilling to accept this. In the past, he reorganized the Peng and Xu regiments under Huang Xiansheng to strengthen his forces, indicating his unwillingness to remain a lowly official. However, at that time, Zhang Zuolin's power was like an iron bucket. Later, Zou Zuohua's troops were stationed in Xing'an for land reclamation, and their power was above his, which made Zhang Haipeng even more unhappy. This time, when the Japanese sent troops, Zhang believed it was a heaven-sent opportunity, and the Japanese were constantly sending him signals of affection. Therefore, he had to become a disloyal traitor.</p>
<p>Initially, the Japanese also thought they had a great chance of success, as they still remembered the good dream of the Eastern Three Provinces red beards helping them during the Russo-Japanese War. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese had received assistance from bandits. Therefore, this time, before sending troops, the Japanese spent more than 200,000 Japanese yen to incite bandits. However, there are many heroes among the bandits, such as the proclamations issued by gang leaders such as Gai Sansheng to sacrifice themselves for the country, which is proof of this. This time, the Japanese used Zhang Haipeng because they thought that Zhang was originally a figure from the old Green Forest and would be easy to use. Zhang, in addition to being misled by the Japanese, was also deceived by the remnants of the fallen Qing Dynasty, such as Prince Gong Puwei. After Puwei and others were active in Shenyang, they preemptively appointed Zhang as the general of Heilongjiang. Therefore, Zhang's index finger moved greatly. Two trainloads of Japanese military supplies were transported to Taonan in the late night of the 10th and 11th of this month and handed over to Zhang.</p>
<p>After Zhang Haipeng obtained military supplies and the assistance of Mongolian bandits (skilled riders), he instructed Peng and Xu, the commanders of his two regiments, to prepare. The two regimental commanders were still hesitant. On the 12th of this month, 300 Japanese soldiers arrived from Nankai and exerted great pressure on Zhang, ordering him to mobilize. Zhang had no choice but to order Peng and Xu to mobilize. The two regimental commanders replied that they dared not disobey the orders of the garrison commander, but they feared that if they saw the garrison commander again after this trip, they would not be able to speak. The two regimental commanders left, but the troops were still slow to advance (later turning their weapons against Zhang). The Japanese soldiers were worried that the delay would cause problems, so they forced Zhang and his confidants to board the train and head north. However, the Black Army had already prepared for the opportunity. The Yu Zhaolin brigade stationed on the banks of the Nen River retreated to the left bank of the river, destroyed the bridge, and defended it. Upon seeing the enemy, they immediately fired artillery to resist. Zhang's troops had never received training and saw that they were fighting for the Japanese invaders, so they had no fighting spirit. At the sound of gunfire, they scattered. The Japanese soldiers' encouragement was ineffective, and they were also afraid that the reclamation army (Zou Zuohua's troops) would cut off their rear, so they escorted the remaining soldiers straight back to Zhendong (more than 100 li away from Taonan). 　　, a Japanese advisor to the East Special Chief Executive Office in Harbin, made this trip in vain.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 20th, Ma Zhanshan, the newly appointed acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province and the former garrison commander of Heihe, disguised himself and took a boat from Heihe. He changed trains at Duiqingshan on the way to Longsha and took office on the morning of the 21st. About a brigade of his troops had also arrived in Heihe. The Black Army's Su Bingwen's Hailun-Manchuria Railway Protection Brigade had also arrived. With the addition of these two fresh forces, Zhang Haipeng fell and could not rise again. The Japanese, seeing Zhang's failure, were deeply afraid that their process of division would be difficult to implement from then on. Therefore, on the one hand, they tried their best to help the Mongolian bandits to disturb the local area, destroy the Datong Road, and sever the connection between Jinzhou and Heilongjiang Province, using it as an excuse to control. On the other hand, they also spread rumors that the Taonan was suffering from a *pestis minor* epidemic to prevent foreigners from going to investigate the truth. On the other hand, they recruited tens of thousands of ruffians in Korea and escorted them to Dalian by warship on the night of the 12th and 13th. At that time, the entire city of Dalian was blacked out for tens of minutes to prevent the people from noticing. Currently, these Korean ruffians are all armed. Some of them are scattered along the Beining Railway to cause trouble and provide an excuse for the future. A part of them are used to replenish Zhang Haipeng's troops and were transported to Taonan in batches on the 15th and 16th. After Zhang's troops are replenished, conflicts are still likely to occur on the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway. (22nd)</p>

<p>All Based on the Japanese Side's One-Sided Reasoning</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that after occupying Liaoning and Jilin, the Japanese army publicly proclaimed that there were over three hundred pending issues between China and Japan, and that China had disregarded treaties and intentionally delayed resolution, inciting the anger of the entire Japanese population and leading to the occupation of Liaoning and Jilin. They claimed that to resolve all pending issues, they had to guarantee their occupation, awaken the Chinese side, and hope for an early resolution. At the time, we suspected that the Japanese government's statement was an exaggeration, and that there were not three hundred pending issues. Furthermore, we had never violated any treaties. We searched and investigated extensively, hoping to obtain the exact number and report it to our readers, to demonstrate the Japanese talent for exaggeration and as a reference for future negotiations. However, after a month of effort, it was difficult to find. Although we knew some of the issues, we felt we did not have the whole picture. The delay continued until today, failing to satisfy our readers' expectations. Now, we have learned from reliable Japanese sources that the so-called instances of China infringing upon Japan's rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia, including the Nakamura Incident, amount to only fifty-four cases. Among them, some are minor, some are unreasonable, some are based on the Twenty-One Demands, which our entire nation has rejected, or they are based on the expired Sino-Japanese Treaty Concerning Manchuria. For example, regarding the stationing of troops along the South Manchurian Railway, Japan inherited this right from the Sino-Russian Treaty. The Sino-Japanese Agreement on Manchuria clearly stipulated that if Russia withdrew its troops from the Chinese Eastern Railway, Japan should follow suit. After the old Sino-Russian Treaty was abolished, Japan not only failed to fulfill its treaty obligations but also used the treaty to accuse us of violating it. Such examples are numerous. We now present the complete list of the fifty-four instances of China infringing upon Japan's interests, as claimed by the Japanese. Readers should understand the intentions of the Japanese and quickly study and refute them.</p>
<p>1.  Construction of the parallel lines of the Datong and Xifeng (Xi'an to Dongfeng) Railways: (A) China began construction on the Datong line in August of the fifteenth year of Taisho (August of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China), disregarding the South Manchurian Railway's repeated protests, and continued the construction, starting provisional operations on November 15th of the second year of Showa (sixteenth year of the Republic of China). (B) In January of the first year of Showa (fifteenth year of the Republic of China), construction began on the Jihai branch line, approximately 40 miles from Beishanchengzi to Dongfeng, disregarding the protest of the Fengtian Consul-General and completing the construction by the end of the same year.</p>
<p>2.  Disregard of the agreement regarding the extension of the Beining Railway. Regarding the violation of Article 6 of the agreement on the extension of the Beining Railway, the connecting trains between the Beining Line and the South Manchurian Railway first stopped at Shenyang Station and then proceeded to the South Manchurian Railway's Fengtian Station.</p>
<p>3.  The construction of the Jihai Line is a one-sided trampling of the provisions of the preliminary contract for loans for the four railways of Manchuria and Mongolia. China arbitrarily constructed the Jihai Line, which was completed in May of the fourth year of Showa (eighteenth year of the Republic of China).</p>
<p>4.  The Changda Line and trampling of the construction contracts for the Jihui Line, etc. Regarding the Changda Line (Changchun to Daliao) and Dunhui Line (Dunhua to Haining), which were concluded in May of the third year of Showa (seventeenth year of the Republic of China) with the Ministry of Communications, the South Manchurian Railway intended to begin work in reality, but China blocked it at an inopportune time, preventing the start of construction.</p>
<p>5.  Illegal restriction of the authority of the T'ao-Ang Railway advisor. In violation of the attached exchange of letters to the T'ao-Ang Railway loan contract, China did not grant the advisor dispatched by the South Manchurian Railway to the T'ao-Ang Railway the authority stipulated.</p>
<p>6.  Failure to hire a chief accountant for the Jidun Railway. China violated the Jidun Construction Contract, failing to hire a Japanese chief accountant for the Jidun Railway, and appointing a Chinese accountant to this day.</p>
<p>7.  Regarding the connection equipment between Tongliao and Datong on the Siping-Taonan Railway: The Datong Line was constructed regardless of Japanese protests and became a parallel line to the South Manchurian Railway. Japan has a major interest in the extension line from Tongliao, and the connection equipment construction between the Siping-Taonan and Datong lines is closely related to the extension line. According to the meeting held in Tianjin in December of the fifth year of Showa between Japan and China regarding the Beining (Datong) and Siping-Taonan Railways, it was decided to implement the connection equipment. Because of repeated reminders from the Chinese side after the railway began negotiations, it was clear that the issue of the connection equipment and other issues should be properly addressed. The request for connection equipment was to be put on hold, but China disregarded this and completed the connection equipment without notification.</p>
<p>8.  Denial of the South Manchurian Railway-Siping-Taonan Railway connection agreement. The connection transportation contract between the South Manchurian Railway and the Siping-Taonan Railway Bureau was signed in September of the third year of Showa. The revision of the South Manchurian Railway's contract for connecting cargo transport via the Korean Railway and the Siping-Taonan Railway is inseparably related to this contract. The approval of the Communications Committee has not been obtained to this day, and the two contracts remain shelved, and Japan has not yet revised them.</p>
<p>9.  The hardships of the Jidun Line and Tao'an Line construction: Regarding the construction costs of 34 million yuan for the Jidun Line (completed in October of the third year of Showa) and 12.92 million yuan for the Tao'an Line (completed in June of the second year of Showa), China pleaded hardship and has not yet been able to determine the amounts.</p>
<p>10. Obstructing the South Manchurian Railway, approximately 90 incidents per year: As a result of the Chinese authorities' inadequate enforcement, the South Manchurian Railway suffered the following obstructions in Manchuria and outside the prefecture in the fourth and fifth years of Showa (the number of incidents decreased in the fifth year due to special efforts by the Japanese to prevent them):</p>
<p>Year Obstructions Number of Transport Obstructions Thefts of Railway Supplies Theft of Electric Wires</p>
<p>Damage Incidents Property Stolen Number of Items Times</p>
<p>Showa 4 87 114 17 13</p>
<p>Showa 5 84 75 5 15</p>
<p>11. Improper taxation of South Manchurian Railway materials: In violation of Article 8 of the attached agreement to the South Manchurian Railway Treaty, since February of the second year of Showa, half of the wood tax has been levied on the Chinese sellers of Jilin-produced sleepers used by the South Manchurian Railway.</p>
<p>12. Illegal restrictions on the purchase of South Manchurian Railway materials: In the third year of Showa, the South Manchurian Railway Company purchased hundreds of thousands of sleepers. China considered this amount excessive and did not issue the necessary number of tax-exempt passports. It took a year of protest and negotiation to issue them all.</p>
<p>13. Obstructing the South Manchurian Railway's use of stone materials: According to Article 6 of the "Contract for the Construction and Management of the Chinese Eastern Railway," regarding the quarrying sites for railway stones, the Japanese right to lease land has been comprehensively agreed upon. Recently, the Chinese side has obstructed it by all means. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shenyang Financial and Industrial Bureaus Established Under Japanese Influence</h3>
<p>Both Bureaus Form Reorganization Committees</p>
<p>Real Power Entirely in Japanese Hands</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin states that the previous dispatch detailed the restoration of the Shenyang Financial and Industrial Bureaus. Here are the regulations of the two bureaus:</p>
<p>(A) Industrial Bureau, Chapter 1: General Principles (1) The Local Maintenance Committee, to guide and control the various industries necessary for maintaining the people's livelihood, will establish temporary measures as an emergency plan until the new regime is firmly established, to allow the Industrial Bureau to open.

Chapter 3: Control of Industry (1) The Local Maintenance Committee will establish an Industrial Planning Committee to formulate implementation plans for various industrial guidance and controls. The organization is as follows: Japanese representatives, representatives of the Local Maintenance Committee, the Director of the Financial Bureau, the Financial Bureau's advisors, the Director of the Industrial Bureau, the heads of each department, advisors, representatives of the Municipal Public Office, representatives of the Provincial Farmers' Association, and representatives of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce. Supplementary Provisions (1) The Director of the Industrial Bureau, in order to achieve its objectives, may consult the Local Maintenance Committee and promptly issue necessary announcements. However, in its implementation, it must first receive the approval of the Japanese army. (2) The Local Maintenance Committee will stipulate temporary measures for the Industrial Bureau, and based on this, petition the Japanese army in advance to open the Industrial Bureau.

Article 8: If tax officials from the old regime deliver various tax payments, the Maintenance Committee, through its resolution, will request the Japanese military authorities to severely punish them. Observing these two regulations, it is known that the Japanese army is intensifying its management in Shenyang step by step and embarking on a permanent plan. Although the League of Nations has limited its troop withdrawal to three weeks, it is feared that it is just an empty statement, and the Japanese side is still ignoring it. What will become of China?

<h3>Guangzhou Registers Shops Selling Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Thoroughly Cutting Off Imports of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou states that since the Japanese invasion of the East, the people of Guangdong have been extremely indignant. Various counties and cities have launched anti-Japanese movements, implementing economic severance with Japan. The academic community has also organized anti-Japanese volunteer armies. The people's spirit is flourishing like wildfire. Since the establishment of the All Circles Anti-Japanese Association in Guangzhou, the anti-Japanese salvation associations previously organized by various groups have successively ended and unanimously joined the All Circles Anti-Japanese Association to achieve unity. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently, in order to cut off imports of Japanese goods,</p>

<p>specially drafted measures for registering shops selling enemy goods and submitted them to the All Circles Anti-Japanese Conference for resolution and implementation. After the conference passed them, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce printed and distributed the registration forms for enemy goods, requiring all shops to register their existing Japanese goods from November 1st to the 5th. Those who register falsely or incompletely, or who fail to report within the deadline, will be investigated for smuggling Japanese goods. Here are the registration measures for enemy goods of the association: (1) The period from November 1st to November 5th is the period for all shops in Guangzhou to register their existing Japanese goods.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Belgium Form Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>Propagating to Various Countries in French, English, and German</p>
<p>Hosting Belgian Celebrities and the Press</p>
<p>A dispatch from Brussels states that upon hearing the bad news of Japan's military deployment in the Northeast, the overseas Chinese in Belgium were all indignant. The Chinese Students Association in Leuven convened an emergency meeting to discuss coordinating with student associations across Belgium to resist Japan unitedly. On September 25th, a delegate conference was held at the Leuven YMCA. Delegates from Brussels, Zhang Zuoren, Tong Dizhou, and Zhang Weihan; delegates from Leuven, Lu Shidao, Lu Bingxiong, and He Xie; delegates from Liege, An Zhongyi and Wang Yuanzhang; delegates from Ghent, Shen Chenglin; and delegates from Charleroi, Zhang Anya, and others, twenty-five people in total, attended. The atmosphere was solemn and tense. The meeting started at 2 PM, enduring hunger and cold, until it adjourned at 6 AM the next morning. It was decided to organize the Belgium Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation General Association. Zhang Zuoren, representing Brussels, Lu Bingxiong, representing Leuven, Shen Chenglin, representing Ghent, An Zhongyi, representing Liege, and Zhang Anya, representing Charleroi, were elected as executive committee members, responsible for handling all motions of the delegate conference. The executive committee members are working enthusiastically. The important things that have been done in the past two weeks are recorded as follows: (1) A telegram was sent to the National Government hoping to declare war on Japan and that the Chinese students in Belgium were fully armed and awaiting orders. (2) Telegrams were sent to the military and political leaders hoping to eliminate differences and unite against foreign aggression. (3) A request was sent to the League of Nations to uphold justice. (4) A telegram was sent to our country's representative in Geneva asking him to argue on the basis of reason. (5) The International Propaganda Department uses the English, French, and German languages to promote Japan's ambition to invade our country and the barbarity of the Japanese soldiers' actions to European and American countries. (6) A "Letter to Compatriots at Home and Abroad" was issued urging the people to strive for self-improvement. On October 6th, the Executive Committee also held a reception at the Central Hotel in Brussels, inviting Belgian celebrities and journalists. The attendees included Mr. and Mrs. Fan Wen, leaders of the Second International; Professor and Mrs. Qi Er, renowned professor at the Belgian Advanced Research Institute; President Otter of the World Society; Professor Maoqi of the Advanced Research Institute; Ms. Feng Taina, President of the International Women's Sports Association; and reporters from the eight major newspapers, forty-two people in total. The executive committee members and public relations officers were responsible for the reception. After the chairman announced the opening speech, Ma Guangchen and Tang Xin'sun gave speeches based on legal facts, exposing the Japanese side's atrocities, which won the sympathy of the celebrities and journalists. Professor Maoqi then stood up and gave a speech, saying that he had stayed in China for more than ten years, read many Chinese books, such as Laozi, Zhuangzi, Confucius, and Mencius, and that Chinese philosophy is based purely on peace and justice, with customs that are honest and kind, and people who are benevolent and patient. China is indeed the center of Eastern civilization and the source of world culture. This time, the incident in the Northeast proves that Japan harbors aggressive ambitions, which is extremely obvious. We express our deep sympathy to China and are willing to fight against the tyrannical to realize world peace and happiness. President Otter then gave a speech, saying that the incident in the Northeast gave us a profound impression. The world should intervene in Japan's violent behavior. We first hope that the League of Nations can suppress this behavior that harms humanity based on justice. Secondly, we further imagine using this opportunity to unite all the people of the world and organize an international institution to solve the events that the League of Nations cannot solve. If everything is made public, peace will be realized. Finally, the chairman shouted "Long live Belgium, long live the Republic of China, long live the people of the world!" and the event ended happily.</p>

<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Takes Over National Tax Agencies</h3>
<p>People Assigned by the Provincial Government to Handle Them</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that the various national tax agencies in Shandong Province, including the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, the Consolidated Tax Administration Office, and the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau, have all been taken over by the provincial government and will be managed by people assigned by the provincial government. Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong provincial government, appointed Li Wuchen (Chief of the Military Law Department of the Third Route Army Headquarters) as Acting Shandong Salt Transport Commissioner, Meng Zhaokong (Chief of the Military Supply Section of the Third Route Army Headquarters) as Acting Director of the Shandong Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, Hou Xitian (Chief Accounting Officer of the Provincial Government) as Acting Director of the Consolidated Tax Administration Office, and Tian Lianzhong (Deputy Chief of the Military Supply Section of the Third Route Army Headquarters) as Acting Director of the Shandong Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau this morning (28th). They are also responsible for taking over the tax payments and tax tickets stored in each office and bureau, preparing a detailed list of four columns, and submitting it for verification. After receiving the orders, the acting personnel went to take over their respective offices, and the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Salt Transport Commissioner's Office: The former Salt Transport Commissioner Yuan Timing went to Beijing before the Mid-Autumn Festival and has not returned. His section chief was responsible for the handover. Yuan's personal belongings stored in the office have all been transported to Nanjing. The newly appointed Acting Salt Transport Commissioner Li Wuchen will officially take office tomorrow morning (29th).</p>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau: The former Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, Xiang Jieren, went to Beijing with Jiang Bocheng earlier and has not returned. His section chief was responsible for the handover. The newly appointed Acting Director Meng Zhaokong took over the seal and took office at 12:00 AM today (28th), and posted a notice of assumption of office saying, "According to the instructions of the Shandong Provincial Government, it is ordered to comply. The position of Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau has been entrusted to the said official to act. All payments for various types of stamps, tobacco, and alcohol stored in the bureau, as well as tax tickets, must be thoroughly investigated. For this reason, the Director of the Bureau is ordered to quickly list the items received separately in a detailed list of four columns and submit it for verification, and first report the date of arrival. Do not delay this order. In addition to submitting a separate report and holding an oath-taking ceremony to assume office, the merchants and residents are hereby notified."</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax Administration Office: The former Director of the Consolidated Tax Administration Office, Xu Tieshan, handed over the office today (28th). The new Director, Hou Xitian, visited the office in the morning and decided to officially go to the office tomorrow morning (29th).</p>
<p>Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau: The former Director, Ren Wenhan, handed over the office today (28th). The new Director, Tian Lianzhong, took over the office at noon and decided to officially work tomorrow (29th).</p>
<p>Regarding the reason why Shandong Province took over the national tax agencies, according to Han Fuju, the military pay of the headquarters has not been received for several months, and only a few hundred thousand were received in September, which is far from enough to maintain operations. Therefore, people were first sent to take over the various tax revenue agencies in order to maintain military pay. (28th)</p>

<p>Jiangdu County Court Renamed as District Court: The expansion of the Jiangdu County Court into the Zhenjiang District Court and the Jiangdu Branch has been approved by the Ministry's order and is scheduled to be established on November 20th. Chen Ruizhen is still appointed as the President of the Branch Court.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Joint Suppression of Bandits in Yangcheng Lake: A major robbery occurred in Mocheng Town, and 28 people were kidnapped. Except for 25 people who have been rescued from danger, the remaining three people are still in the hands of the bandits. The Department of Civilian Affairs considered this to be an unprecedented major case in Changshu and specially instructed Shen Weikuai, the third district chief of the Water Police Team, to rescue the remaining three hostages within three days. District Chief Shen recently learned that the gang of lake bandits had recently gathered again in Yangcheng Lake at the junction of Suzhou, Changshu, and Kunshan, and immediately telegraphed Yang Qingjiu, the thirteenth team leader of this county, to quickly lead his team from Kunshan. Then, he personally led the eleventh, fourteenth, and fifteenth teams from Suzhou to pursue the lake, converge with Yang's team, and take a surrounding posture to capture the bandits in one fell swoop. The thirteenth team set off on the morning of the 30th to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Provincial Order to Collect Land Tax for Road Construction: The Kunshan County Government has repeatedly received provincial orders to allocate the land tax collected for road construction to the purchase of government bonds for river management and transportation. Both the Finance and Construction Departments have sent representatives to Kunshan to oversee the collection. However, the county had already decided to use the road construction land tax to repair embankments as a form of work relief. If the province takes the funds, there will be no money for embankment repairs, which is extremely dangerous. After hearing the news, various agencies held meetings to discuss requesting the provincial committee to postpone the withdrawal. Representatives were sent to the province along with County Magistrate Pang to personally plead with Chairman Ye to allow the funds to be used for embankment repairs. The representatives have not yet returned to Kunshan, and the provincial government has sent an urgent telegram urging the withdrawal, stating that the payment of the government bonds for river management and transportation is important, and demanding that the land tax for road construction be quickly sent to the province.</p>
<p>Follow-up on Embezzlement of National Taxes Case: Hou Yiru, a tax collection officer in Kunshan, falsely listed a portion of the national taxes paid by various businesses over the years as owed by the people and embezzled the funds. This caused an uproar in society. A member of a certain party submitted a request to the party headquarters for a thorough investigation. The Executive Committee, considering the seriousness of the case, issued a public notice throughout the county, stating that if any business owner had paid national taxes and possessed receipts but could not find the corresponding grain receipts, they should submit the receipts to the committee for verification. The committee also requested the Finance Bureau to provide Hou's account books. On the 27th, an audit began. It was discovered that six households, including Tao Bohe, owed over 700 yuan in silver dollars from the Republic year 8. Tao and others were summoned to the meeting and stated that they had already paid in full and possessed receipts, but the receipts could not be matched. The committee members believed that the evidence of Hou's embezzlement of national taxes was conclusive. However, there were thousands of business owners in the county, and the embezzlement of over 700 yuan from six households in one year was alarming. It would take two or three months to settle these accounts. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the county government requesting that Hou be transferred to the judiciary for punishment and that the amount of embezzlement be clearly announced.</p>
<h3>Chongming</h3>
<p>Chongming and Qidong Counties Telegraph Request for Merger: The counties of Chongming and Qidong have recently faced massive administrative expenses, leading to a tenfold increase in national taxes. Furthermore, bandits and communists are everywhere, and the people are struggling to survive. Elders such as Ni Qinghe and Wang Qingmu from the two counties, seeking to reduce administrative expenses and lighten the burden on the people, had previously telegraphed the provincial government requesting a merger of the two counties, but without result. They now telegram again, stating that the separation of Chongming and Qidong was originally intended to unify county administration and reduce burdens. Now, a small number of people in Qidong have incited the people to surround the county magistrate and force him to send telegrams, seemingly willing to endure suffering rather than agree to a merger. The situation is incomprehensible, and it is hoped that this will be recognized. Local tyrants are behaving so rampantly that the people's happiness is being completely deprived. Wang Qingmu has been publicly nominated as a representative to present their views to the province. [Signed] Ni Qinghe and others.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Promptly Establish Temporary Courts to Try Crimes Endangering the Republic: The Jiangsu Higher Court had previously inquired with the Ministry of Justice, through the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Jiangsu Province, whether the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic should be implemented in various counties according to bandit suppression areas. The reply stated that during the pacification period, bandit suppression and village cleansing were carried out simultaneously, and all pacification areas should be handled according to bandit suppression areas. An order was issued to various counties to comply. However, it has recently been found that many counties have delayed compliance, causing those accused of the above crimes to be detained without trial. This not only violates the purpose of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes but also greatly hinders the progress of cleaning up the officialdom. Yesterday, a special order was issued to various counties, reiterating the previous order that anyone who commits any of the crimes stipulated as endangering the Republic must be tried by a temporary court organized by the county magistrate and two judicial officials, according to Article 7 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes. The temporary court is to be located in the county government, with the county magistrate as the presiding judge. The counties were ordered to present a request to the court within seven days of receiving the document to dispatch personnel to organize the temporary court and quickly conclude the trials without delay.</p>
<p>Implement General Inspection of Anti-Japanese Activities: The Wuxi Party Headquarters and various anti-Japanese national salvation associations had previously received requests from various industries, including silk, cloth, foreign goods, sundries, paper, hardware, etc., to allow a grace period for registering any remaining enemy goods in their stores that had not been fully registered. The committee decided to allow registration within five days, with a national salvation donation of 4% of the value of the goods. The deadline was the 28th. On the 29th, various industries submitted their registration forms through the Chamber of Commerce to the County Party Headquarters and the National Salvation Association for record-keeping. The Anti-Japanese Association's inspection department convened over 150 inspectors, assigned tasks, and launched a general mobilization on the afternoon of the 29th to conduct a general inspection simultaneously. In two days, a large quantity of cotton cloth, paper goods, and foreign goods were discovered. The goods will be dealt with according to the punishment rules after identification.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Two Robbery Cases: The Chen family in Xizhanjia Village, Huangtang, was robbed of over 200 yuan on the night of their daughter's wedding. On the night of the 27th, the Xu BingSheng and Xu Juncai families in Qingci Xujia Village were also robbed. Three or four tailors working in the house were stripped and tied up. BingSheng, his brother, and their mother were severely beaten by the robbers, who stole over 300 yuan. Because they were afraid of the robbers, neither of the robberies was reported to the county.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Ma Scheduled to Take Office: County Magistrate Peng was ordered by the province to exchange positions with County Magistrate Ma Zhenbang of Pi County. Local people repeatedly pleaded with him to stay, but without success. County Magistrate Ma is now scheduled to take office in Cheng [Jiangyin] on the first day of next month.</p>
<p>5,000 Yuan for the Huacheng Japanese Yarn Case: The Liangjing Student Association discovered 1,369 bales of Huacheng Japanese yarn during the Double Tenth Festival, but the case has been difficult to resolve. Yesterday (29th), the Anti-Japanese Association held a meeting and decided on the following matters: (1) Send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to forward to various merchants, requesting them to submit a list of all Japanese goods by November 3rd. From the 4th to the 8th, the association will dispatch inspectors to verify the lists. On the 9th, the remaining goods will be auctioned off. (2) For the Huacheng Japanese yarn case, the factory will pay 5,000 yuan, with 2,000 yuan going to the national salvation fund, 2,000 yuan to the volunteer army, and 1,000 yuan to the Anti-Japanese Association for publicity. The Japanese yarn will be returned.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Allocation of Personnel Passing the Higher Examination for Internship: The Ministry of Personnel has allocated personnel who passed the Higher Examination to various places for internship. Nine people have been assigned to Zhenjiang, including four general administrative personnel, two in education, two in police, and one in finance. Three of the general administrative personnel, Wu Bin and Shen Jiantu, and the police officer Hua Yunqi, have already reported for duty. The rest will arrive in the province successively in the coming days.</p>
<p>Attention to Fishery Administration: Jiangsu's fishery industry is largely run by chance, hindering its development. The Department of Agriculture, in order to promote development, is conducting a basic survey. Based on the principles of physical chemistry and biology, it is studying the movement and aggregation of fish to explore the location of fishing grounds and predict the prosperity or decline of the fishery. Fishermen's education is considered a key to rescuing fishermen and developing the fishery, so marine observation is being trialed, fishing experiments are being conducted continuously, and the Department of Education is collaborating to plan fishermen's education. Furthermore, the cotton woven netting used by fishermen is purchased from Japan, amounting to over a million yuan annually. In the midst of promoting domestic goods, all fishing boats are facing a standstill in going out to sea to fish due to a lack of netting. This has a major impact on the fishery. Special Envoy Hou Chaohai has been dispatched to liaise with Principal Jin of the Zhejiang Provincial Vocational School of Fisheries and General Manager Rong of the Sanxin Company to entrust the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Factory with manufacturing the netting. However, due to the small quantity and the large machinery, manufacturing is difficult, so the Shanghai Electric Weaving Factory has been contracted to produce the netting. After inspection and testing, it is found to be usable.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Bandit Monk Daogen Executed by Firing Squad in Tianchang: The Anhui opera-singing bandit monk Daogen, who had previously operated in Gaomiao Town on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui, was captured by Li Changming, the captain of the copper guard police team under Tianchang County. He was then handed over to the Tianchang County government. More than twenty of Daogen's followers were arrested at the same time. After interrogation by the county magistrate, the evidence was conclusive, and he was immediately executed by firing squad in accordance with the Bandit Suppression and Punishment Law.</p>
<p>Department Committee Member Arrives in You [Gaoyou] to Investigate Case: The education community in the county previously misappropriated 13,000 yuan of education funds to assist the dike defense committee, and the finance bureau misappropriated 8,000 yuan of education funds. Furthermore, due to the county party headquarters' recommendation of party members Wang Tingfan as the chief of the third section of the county government and Wang Tian'an as a staff member of the third section, the entire education community opposed it and filed a complaint with the education department and the provincial party headquarters against Huang Songwan, a standing committee member of the party, for surrounding the county magistrate and interfering with education. They requested the department to send personnel to You to order the dike defense committee and the finance bureau to repay the education funds in order to maintain education. The department has now sent Jin Jiesan to You to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Continued News of Bandit Alert in Bajiang Port: A bandit alert occurred in Bajiang Port the night before last. The militiaman Zhou Xingfu and two rifles, as well as a boat, were all taken away. On the 25th, a bandit corpse was found in the reeds by the river, with a box gun and fourteen rows of bullets on its body. After an examination by the county government, the body was claimed. Yesterday, another corpse was found by the river, confirmed to be the militiaman Zhou Xingfu, who was also shot and killed by bandits and his body thrown on the riverbank. The stolen boat has been found in Zhangjiagang, Jiangyin.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Difficulty of Xiaoyi [Xiaoshan] Autonomy: Since the previous County Magistrate Du Shihua handled the land declaration, the local area has spent tens of thousands of yuan. Land disputes among the people have led to lawsuits and bankruptcy. The land declaration still has no effect. Since last year, an autonomous household tax has been created, assessed according to household, ranging from one yuan to ten yuan per year. Xiaoyi has suffered from repeated years of famine, and the people's strength is truly insufficient. This time, in order to establish a defense corps, ten yuan is assessed for every hundred households, forcibly apportioned to various townships, and the people are already complaining. Furthermore, 25% of every ten thousand yuan collected from the autonomy tax is used for district expenses, and 30% is used for education expenses. As a result, the township office only has an income of over a hundred yuan and cannot even open for business. The difficulty of autonomy is evident.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>The First Step in the Party and Government Organs' Handling of Disputes in the Education Community: The education community in Anhui Province has recently experienced a major dispute, involving a wide range and difficult to resolve. The cause of the dispute is the attack on education inspectors in the "Education New Publication" (a new publication of the Anhui education community). The Department of Education had previously sent Yang Zhongming and five others to study abroad. Yang and others took the money but did not go abroad. The "Education New Publication" first wrote articles urging them, then wrote articles scolding them. Cao Juesheng, the editor of the publication, then published advertisements questioning why Yang and others did not go abroad. Yang and others considered this an insult and sued Cao in court. Cao also gathered many people and sued Yang with the provincial government. Advertisements in the newspapers appeared repeatedly. The "Education New Publication" is Cao's stronghold, and the School Federation is Yang's protector. The conflict has become intense. The provincial party headquarters, believing that both sides are wrong, first submitted a request to the provincial government to cancel the provincial school federation, saying that it was organized without permission and violated the law. At the same time, it also rejected the registration of the "Education New Publication," saying that it incited student unrest. This is the first step in handling disputes in the education community. There is currently no definite news on how to proceed with the second step. Cao and Yang are currently evenly matched and at a standstill. A thorough resolution is expected soon.</p>
<p>Problems Arise with Anhui University School Buildings: Anhui Provincial University has been established for three years but still has no fixed school buildings. The agricultural school buildings at Wulimiao outside the East Gate are small and dilapidated and insufficient. Therefore, the school buildings of St. Paul's Middle School have been rented repeatedly, but have not been vacated. Now that St. Paul's Middle School has been restored, it has informed the provincial government, the Department of Education, and Anhui University that the lease will expire in February of next year, and the school buildings must be fully recovered and will not be re-leased. The school is currently trying to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Important Education News</p>
<h3>Ministries Jointly Submit Measures for Establishing Secondary Schools in Various Leagues and Banners of Mongolia</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission have drafted an outline of measures for establishing secondary schools in various leagues and banners of Mongolia (listing more than a dozen areas, each to establish secondary schools, vocational schools, and rural normal schools. Two or three secondary schools should be fully established before the 26th year of the Republic and rural normal schools and vocational schools must be established first). The submission to the Executive Yuan states that the allocation of Mongolian and Tibetan education funds for the 20th year is: 90,000 yuan for the regular expenses of the National Mongolian and Tibetan School, 300,000 yuan for subsidies for secondary schools established in areas densely populated by Mongolians, Tibetans, and Xinjiang Hui people, 30,000 yuan for subsidies for Mongolian, Tibetan, and Xinjiang Hui students studying in secondary schools and above in the interior, 20,000 yuan for scholarships for those studying abroad, 30,000 yuan for printing textbooks suitable for Mongolian and Tibetan secondary and lower schools, 10,000 yuan for textbook and popular reading material translation awards, 10,000 yuan for academic investigation team subsidies, and 10,000 yuan for special expenses. The budget book has already been submitted separately for review. These funds are primarily intended to develop local education in Mongolia and Tibet. Once the allocation methods and budget are finalized, they should be actively implemented according to the Mongolian and Tibetan education implementation plan. However, the political organization and social conditions of Mongolia and Tibet are different from those of the interior. If separate, practical, and unified measures are not formulated, there is a risk of disputes or no one being responsible for planning once the funds are released. According to the original plan, the secondary schools established in various leagues and banners of Mongolia, except for the four special banners that are attached to nearby leagues and banners, will use the original administrative areas of each league and banner as the enrollment area. The schools are not all in one place and cannot all be located in the offices of the league and banner chiefs. If the league and banner chiefs are solely responsible for running the schools, the current actual situation suggests that it may not be done perfectly or may lead to neglect. If the officials of the banner where each school is located are responsible for running the schools, the school's interests may be exclusively for that banner, or other banners may not be responsible for sending students or sharing expenses. The central government's subsidies for these schools are limited. If the central government directly sends people to run the schools, there may be communication problems and more obstacles to progress. Furthermore, the existing educational foundation in various leagues and banners of Mongolia is uneven. Some have already established secondary schools, while others have not even established primary schools. All these practical situations should be planned in advance so that education in various leagues and banners of Mongolia can progress in an orderly and balanced manner. The ministry and commission have discussed in detail and unanimously agree to first draft a twelve-article outline of measures for establishing secondary schools in various leagues and banners of Mongolia, covering the nature, number, location, time limit, order of establishment, enrollment area, administrative organization methods and procedures, educational policy, and fundraising, with the goal of making clear and consistent progress without obstruction. Is this appropriate? A joint submission is made for review and approval for instruction and implementation.</p>
<h3>Order from the Jiangsu Department of Education</h3>
<p>No Explicit Regulations for School Badges Outside the Capital: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instructs Zhang Haicheng, the principal of the Provincial Nantong Middle School, stating that the department had previously forwarded the school principal's request for the design of school badges to the Ministry of Education for review. The instruction No. 3999 states, "Received and noted. The Executive Yuan has issued an order specifying the design of badges for various agencies in the capital: 'Educational organizations use an equilateral triangle of Sanmin Zhuyi.' There are no explicit regulations for the design of school badges outside the capital. Please inform accordingly." Therefore, an order is issued for your information.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Social Education Organizations</h3>
<p>Submit Relief Measures for Provincial Education Funds: The directors of provincial social education organizations, due to the heavy floods this year and the shortage of provincial revenue, leading to long-standing arrears in the funding of various organizations and economic hardship that is difficult to support, held a meeting in the province the other day and decided to jointly send letters to the Education Funding Committee, the provincial government, and the Ministry of Education, proposing relief measures for education funds in the province. The relevant official documents are recorded below:</p>
<p>A submission regarding the increasingly tight Jiangsu education funding, respectfully submitting remedial measures for review and implementation. It is found that the main reason for the Jiangsu education funding shortfall is the under-collection of the annual land tax allocation and the impact of the floods on the reliable revenue for the 20th year, which is only about 2 million yuan. After deducting the over 900,000 yuan of arrears from previous years, the net income for the 20th year is only about 1.3 million yuan. This is insufficient to cover the 3.3 million yuan in expenditure. Now that the fiscal year has begun for four months, the education institutions have received less than a month's worth of funding, with arrears of more than three months. If remedial measures are not planned early, there is a risk of schools being suspended soon. The undersigned are currently serving in Jiangsu provincial education institutions and have witnessed the difficulties in education funding. We dare not remain silent and respectfully submit three remedial measures as follows, respectfully requesting your consideration:</p>
<p>1.  It is necessary to firmly request the Ministry of Finance to fulfill its commitment to make up the shortfall in land tax revenue for the four years prior to the 19th year. The biggest reason for the shortage of Jiangsu education funding is that the cigarette tax revenue was transferred to the Ministry of Finance in the 16th year of the Republic, and a land tax allocation of 1.8 million yuan was used to offset it. Although it was agreed at the time that the Ministry of Finance would make up for any shortfall, since the 16th year, the annual shortfall has been about 600,000 yuan, and the total shortfall for four years is over 2.5 million yuan. Although repeated requests have been made to the Ministry of Finance for compensation, not a single penny has been allocated. On July 23 of this year, the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Executive Yuan Secretariat regarding Jiangsu education funding, stating that the Jiangsu education funding has been approved under the province's land tax item, with a monthly allocation of 150,000 yuan. All shortfalls under the land tax item should be the responsibility of the provincial government to effectively reorganize the land tax to make up for it. Previous letters from your office and the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office have been replied to accordingly, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government has been consulted to urge the Finance Department to earnestly reorganize the province's land tax to prevent any shortfall in special education funds. A detailed analysis of this letter shows that it does not deny the agreement that the Ministry of Finance would make up for any shortfall in the land tax allocation of the 16th year. The advice to the provincial government to urge the Finance Department to earnestly reorganize the land tax to prevent any shortfall in special education funds shows that the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to special education funds. However, this can only be done for this year and beyond. The 2.5 million yuan of significant funds that have already been collected in the previous four years should still be fulfilled by the Ministry of Finance according to the agreement. There are three reasons for this: Since the land tax allocated from the 16th year has had an annual shortfall of about 600,000 yuan, while the cigarette tax collected by the Ministry of Finance has been increasing year by year and is a large sum, making up for the shortfall is not unfair (Reason 1). Assuming that from the 20th year, the Jiangsu provincial land tax is reorganized by the Finance Department, and the annual special education funds of 1.8 million yuan are fortunately no longer in short supply, the funds already short-collected before the 19th year will still be unavailable. Moreover, the disaster in Jiangsu province this year is extremely severe, and the existing revenue is still uncertain. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance should fulfill its commitment and fully compensate for the 2.5 million yuan in short land tax allocations for the four years before the 19th year to alleviate the current difficulties in Jiangsu education funding (Reason 2). Furthermore, after the promulgation of the Regulations on Trial Implementation of the Budget for the 19th Year of the Republic of China and the Standards for Dividing National and Local Revenue and Expenditure, since the 19th year, land tax has been completely allocated to local revenue. Even if revenue increases due to earnest reorganization, it will not be possible to withdraw any amount to offset the shortfall in land tax allocations under education funding in previous years. This is extremely clear (Reason 3). In summary, education is a fundamental national policy, and the central and local financial authorities should have the responsibility to maintain it. Since Jiangsu education funding has been in a shortfall since the cigarette tax revenue was transferred to the Ministry of Finance in the 10th year of the Republic, with the accumulated arrears reaching a huge 2.5 million yuan, making ends meet is extremely difficult. The Ministry of Finance should, based on the old agreement, the Regulations on Trial Implementation of the Budget for the 19th Year, and the current practical difficulties in Jiangsu, share the difficulties and enthusiastically maintain it, allocating the accumulated arrears in one lump sum or in installments in cash, or using treasury bills to offset the entire amount, so as to alleviate the current difficulties in Jiangsu education funding.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yiyan Takes Office as Principal of Nanching</h3>
<p>The position of Principal of Jiangyin Nanching Middle School has been vacant for a long time since Zhang Zhongyou left the school. The Department of Education has now appointed Zhang Yiyan, the director of academic affairs of Nantong Middle School, as acting principal. After receiving the appointment, Zhang came to Jiangyin the day before yesterday and took office on the 28th, convening a meeting of faculty, staff, and all students. Principal Zhang stated that he received a telegram from the department on the 18th and went to the Department of Education on the 21st to strongly decline the appointment, stating the reasons why he could not be the principal of Nanching: (1) weak ability, (2) unfamiliar with the school and local area, and (3) the school's financial difficulties. The department insisted that he must act as a short-term acting principal no matter what. There are still over 3,000 yuan in the school's account, which can only last for one month. After arriving at the school, he could not talk about a fundamental solution to the school's policy at the moment. (1) Supplementing the curriculum, (2) financial management, (3) teachers and students must be united in sincerity. The meeting ended.</p>

<h3>Today's Sko-Tor Cup Preliminary Round: Donghua vs. Northam</h3>
<p>3:00 p.m. at the Baseball Field</p>
<p>Tomorrow: Jinan vs. British Navy</p>
<p>The Sko-Tor Cup football tournament begins today. The Donghua football team will be the first to face a strong enemy, Northam. Last week, Donghua's Group A game unfortunately fell victim to their poisonous hands in the last five minutes. Today, they are determined to win and annihilate this enemy to avenge their defeat, so it is worth watching. Starting at 3:00 p.m. at the China Baseball Field.</p>
<h3>Donghua's Life-or-Death Moment</h3>
<p>From an order perspective, if Donghua defeats the Northam army, they will meet Jinan. In the semi-finals, they will meet one of the three teams: Portugal, France, or Lehua. In the finals, they will face the winner of the game between Sko-Tor and West Point. Portugal, France, and Lehua should not be their opponents. Jinan has unspeakable advantages. In short, if they defeat the Northam army today, they can fight Jinan in the finals and reach the finals directly. With smooth sailing, they can defeat West Point Sko-Tor and win the championship. Therefore, today's battle, at least, contains some of the nature of a semi-final and is Donghua's life-or-death moment in the Sko-Tor Cup. In short, it is disappointing that the two strongest teams do not meet in the semi-finals but in the preliminary round.</p>

<h3>A Chinese Initiative to Participate in a Charity Western Boxing Tournament</h3>
<p>Guo Huide and Two Others to Dedicate Their Skills on the 5th and 6th of Next Month</p>
<p>At the Wanguo Shangtuan Hall on Fuzhou Road</p>
<p>Western sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and track and field, have been practiced by Chinese people for a considerable period of time. They compete with Europeans and Americans every year, and the results are not weak. However, Western boxing is still unprecedented. Now, three Chinese people, Guo Huide, Zeng Miancai, and Pang Panfang, are scheduled to compete against three Westerners in a charity boxing match at the Wanguo Shangtuan Hall on Fuzhou Road on November 5th and 6th. It is a Shanghai initiative for Chinese to step into the ring. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at the time.</p>
<h3>Guo Huide's Boxing History</h3>
<p>Guo Huide learned this skill in the United States. When he was studying in the United States, he served as the captain of the school's boxing team. After returning to China, due to his father's opposition, he has not worn gloves for four years. Recently, seeing the launch of a charity boxing competition in Shanghai, he obtained his father's consent and opened a class in the John's school to practice, inviting Ding Gelianding as a coach (Ding was the former Australian national intermediate champion). Up to 50 people joined, which was quite enthusiastic. This was only two months ago.</p>
<h3>Pang Panfang and Zeng Miancai</h3>
<p>Pang and Zeng are the best in the class, each weighing 116 pounds. They will compete with two amateur boxers (Westerners). Guo weighs 130 pounds and will fight against a boxer from the British Army. This is the first time that Chinese people have participated in boxing matches. It is hoped that compatriots will come to the venue to watch and cheer.</p>
<h3>The Difference Between Chinese and Western Boxing</h3>
<p>It should be noted that Western boxing is different from Chinese boxing. In terms of advantages and disadvantages, this technique has been studied by scientific methods. It does not require years of practice. Due to the restrictions of the rules during the competition, both sides can strike hard without the risk of injury. With two or three months of practice, one can learn various fighting skills and can prepare for self-defense at ordinary times, which is a useful sport.</p>
<h3>The Competition is Scheduled for the 5th and 6th</h3>
<p>The competition is scheduled to be held on November 5th and 6th at the Wanguo Shangtuan Hall. Tickets are priced at 20 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 3 yuan, and 1 yuan. All proceeds will be used for flood relief. Ticket sales locations: (1) National Sports Association, (2) Shixiang Trading Company, (3) Huadong Sports Equipment Company.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Voice</p>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>Eating Japanese seafood is like drinking poison; eating Japanese white sugar is like taking arsenic. Absolutely untouchable.</p>
<p>Japanese bandits throw bombs. If our 400 million compatriots unite and use our bodies as shields, sacrificing our lives, how can we not defeat the enemy?</p>
<p>Japanese warships are at coastal ports, more every day. If only Zhou Yu were reborn, like Cao Cao's defeat at Red Cliff, he could burn them to the ground, leaving not a single piece of armor.</p>
<p>Violent Japan acts wildly, slaughtering our people. Let everyone vent their anger, turn it into poisonous gas, and poison them to death one by one.</p>
<p>If you don't remove the grass in the courtyard, you will never learn anything.</p>
<h3>Faraday</h3>
<p>A young friend read "The Death of Edison" and asked me to tell him more about Faraday, Michael Faraday, the inventor of the generator. I am happy to answer this, even more than watching a movie.</p>
<p>Faraday was born in 1791 and died in 1867, living to the age of 76. He invented the principle of the generator at the age of forty (October 17, 1831). With the invention of the principle of the generator, people like Edison were able to use it to create electric lights, streetcars, telephones, and various electrical machines. More people in the world know Edison than Faraday. Before Faraday, electricity could only be considered a scientific trick. Since Faraday invented the generator, the world has changed. Faraday is undoubtedly the founder of the electrified century.</p>
<p>Faraday's father was a blacksmith. He thought that schooling had nothing to do with blacksmithing, so he never sent Faraday to school. At the age of thirteen, Faraday began working as an apprentice to Riebau to learn bookbinding. He learned this job for seven years. He was considered a strange apprentice. He bound books while reading. When the books were bound, he had also finished reading them. Riebau was a knowledgeable master and never stopped his apprentice from reading. During this period, he bound an encyclopedia, which contained an article on electricity. He devoured it at once. He said that this strange electricity did not take much time to read, because there was still much to be known about the principles of electricity. From then on, he had a grand ambition to attack electricity. He also encountered a chemistry experiment book, which he also devoured. He saved money and bought instruments and chemicals to do chemistry tricks. One day, he heard that Davy, a famous chemist at the Royal Society, was going to give a public lecture in London. There was a customer who asked this customer if he could do him a favor and invite him to London to listen to the lecture. This customer readily agreed and bought four admission tickets for him. Faraday went to the city to listen to the lecture, taking notes while listening. After returning to the store, he wrote a long letter to Davy, attaching the notes for him to see, and asked for a meeting. Davy replied and asked him to talk. He boldly asked Davy to give him some work at the Royal Society so that he could learn science. This bold request was generously granted a month later. From then on, Faraday worked as Davy's assistant for a salary of twenty-five shillings a week. This was a major turning point in Faraday's life and a major turning point in the world of learning.</p>
<p>Faraday, generators, the electrified world, all came from a bookbinding apprentice who used both his hands and brain.</p>
<h3>Japanese People and Bedbugs</h3>
<p>— Feng Wu</p>
<p>The Japanese call bedbugs "Nanjing bugs." The history is like this. Since the beginning of Sino-Japanese trade, Japanese people went to Nanjing to do business. After returning to their country, they found this annoying thing, which later multiplied in Japan. Therefore, the Japanese call it "Nanjing bugs." This shows that Japan does not have this dirty and annoying little animal. Only dirty Chinese people have bedbugs. The implication is to ridicule the Chinese for being unclean and dirty.</p>
<p>When I was studying in Tokyo, I met several Japanese classmates. Among them, one was very representative of Japanese ronin, or the original true face of the Japanese. One day, he took something like a small black bean and showed it to me. With a ferocious smile on his face, he said to me, "Look at this little thing." He giggled and said, "A specialty of China, what do you call it?" I perked up and opened my eyes to see a bedbug. I knew they were here to ridicule the Chinese, so I immediately replied, "This is a Tokyo bug." The three of them looked at each other in a state of panic. Later, I cleverly changed the legend of Nanjing bugs in Japan to the history of "Tokyo bugs." The four of us looked at each other and laughed and dispersed.</p>
<p>How can China alone have mere bedbugs? But the Japanese actually use it to ridicule us Chinese people. It's really hateful.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Karma Records</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>A guest came from Wenzhou and told me two karma stories, both of which have been confirmed in modern times in the area. I believe that they can help save the world and reverse the declining trend, so I record them as follows.</p>
<p>A wealthy man, someone named Jia, was a famous scholar in Wenzhou. He had no children and accumulated millions of wealth, but he regarded money as his life. He was stingy and did not show any pity for the poor. He even levied heavy interest, without any leniency. His neighbor was heavily in debt and had no way to repay it. The wealthy man forced him to sell his pregnant wife to pay off the debt. The neighbors were greatly saddened. On the evening of the wife's departure, she hanged herself. Before she died, she gritted her teeth and said, "After death, I swear to take revenge." When the neighbor committed suicide, it was when the wealthy man's beloved concubine gave birth to a son. Therefore, although the whole family was ecstatic and friends congratulated him, the wealthy man's heart was not happy. When his son grew up, he was arrogant, extravagant, and dissolute, squandering all his property. Before long, the rich family with tens of thousands of acres of fertile land and summer houses was penniless. The wealthy man then regretted and sighed, saying, "People say that if you don't have children, you will be poor in old age. Now I am poor in old age because of my son." He soon died. People thought that he was being punished for breaking up other people's families and couples and for using his superior economic power to oppress the propertyless.</p>
<p>There was also someone named Yi who lived in Wenzhou City and was also a wealthy family. He falsely accused his neighbor's son of a crime, causing the neighbor's son to be wrongly accused. One day, he angrily threw himself into the pond to die. After sleeping, Yi often saw his neighbor's son with disheveled hair, bloody face, and pointing and scolding him with a halberd, saying, "This resentment must be avenged. The revenge is in the shallow pond." The wealthy man Yi was afraid to go to the Qiantang River for the rest of his life. One year, his son went to a university in Hangzhou. During the hot summer, he went into the shallow pond to cool off and drowned. People were surprised, but the wealthy man knew the reason. Later, he told his wife, and the story was passed on, and the whole county knew about it, and they were all frightened by the retribution of karma.</p>
<p>Alas, life is both illusion and reality, both right and wrong. I think there is nothing to say about birth, death, honor, disgrace, wealth, nobility, poverty, or lowliness. Some say that people can conquer nature, but ultimately there is a number. What is there, why should it be said that it is there? What is not there, why should it be said that it is not there? So, those who are ignorant of the true meaning of life and exploit and kill each other, not hesitating to sow evil causes, causing future generations to scold them for hundreds of millions of years, what else is there to say?</p>
<h3>World News Notes</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>New Equipment in Train Stations The railway authorities in Cologne, Germany, have added a writing room to the station to make it easier for passengers waiting for trains. It is equipped with typewriters and typists to serve people. For a small fee, you can write letters and send telegrams, which is very convenient. The train station in Frankfurt, Germany, has also added a writing room in the same way because it has seen the popularity of this equipment.</p>
<p>American Consumption The United States is the richest country in the world, so the consumption of Americans is also higher than that of people in other countries. According to recent statistics, they spend an average of 18 pounds and 8 shillings per person in retail food stores and an average of 15 pounds and 12 shillings per person on cars and all car parts. From these two points, it can be seen that Americans love to eat snacks and enjoy sitting in cars.</p>
<p>Prohibition in Chambéry, France The mayor of Chambéry, France, has issued a prohibition that between 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. every day, no gramophones, pianos, or various sound-producing devices such as radios are allowed in all hotels and public places. People are also notified not to let their dogs bark, and cars in the streets are not allowed to honk their horns, so that everyone in the town can sleep peacefully.</p>
<h3>To Fellow Industrial and Commercial Service Workers Amidst National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Xin Shui</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, to encourage its successfully placed industrial and commercial service workers, regularly holds service discussion meetings. This meeting coincided with the national crisis. Mr. Pan Yangyao, the head of the center, therefore wrote an article on the contributions of industrial and commercial service workers during the national crisis. The following is a record of the text.</p>
<p>Time flies, and another service discussion meeting is held, only a month after the last one. In this month, violence rages and national disaster looms. Alas, foreign insults increase, and the nation is in turmoil. I know that you all feel pained and resentful to the extreme, and want to rise up to save the country and devise plans to resist violence and ensure survival. There are myriad aspects to saving the country, but in my opinion, there are no more important three points than the following:</p>
<p>(1) Prepare Physical and Academic Strength Our people's physical weakness and lack of spirit are undeniable, and this is especially true for our service industry workers. Usually, there is no opportunity for exercise, and when facing issues, there is a state of timidity. Today, the leaders of the service industry are most dissatisfied with young shop assistants because they are too weak. From now on, we must first pay attention to physical education, exercise our muscles and bones, invigorate our spirits, and sharpen our resolve to prepare our physical strength to jointly face the national crisis. The invaders are deep. If we remain listless today and do not make such preparations, we will only stretch our necks and await the violent slaughter. The foundation of saving the country lies in science. Today, China is not strong enough to compete with violent Japan. Is it because our soldiers are fewer or our food is insufficient? No. When people fight people, victory can be secured. But when science fights science, it is naturally inferior. Not only is visible warfare inferior, but also invisible warfare, such as economic severance. Since boycotting enemy goods, difficulties have been felt everywhere. The lack of raw materials is further ironclad proof of the immaturity of our science. Therefore, today, we must study diligently and delve into science to resist violence and ensure survival. Hu Shi said, "Saving the country should be a penetrating introspection, which can be sustained and strengthened over time." Academic strength is the effort of penetrating introspection.</p>
<p>(2) Strive in One's Respective Position The country is in such a state of decay because everyone is irresponsible, does not strive, and only blames others. We must realize that the country is trampled upon by violent Japan. To our ancestors and descendants, everyone is a great sinner. Therefore, before blaming everything, we should first blame ourselves. Without self-reproach, we cannot save the country. Therefore, our only responsibility today is to strive in our respective positions. More work means more power to resist Japan. More business means more success in saving the country. Producing one more product means resisting enemy goods by one more unit. If we in the industrial and commercial sectors make one more effort in our duties, we will increase our strength in the economic and military battlefields. Mr. Ma Xiangbo, an old man of ninety-two, said, "From now on, the people should each be determined to 'repent of past mistakes, redeem and save ourselves, pool our wisdom and efforts, and jointly face the national crisis. Then, after ten years of recuperation and ten years of education, we will eventually have a day of self-strengthening and revitalization.'" The old man's words should be taken as the standard.</p>
<p>(3) Restrain Desires In the midst of domestic and foreign troubles, natural disasters and man-made calamities, foreign insults have reached this extreme, disgracing our ancestors and harming our descendants. With a mouthful of blood and eyes full of tears, we can only swallow them into our bellies as material for enduring hardship. We have no other way to save ourselves today than to economize on clothing, food, travel, and housing to save China. From now on, we should grit our teeth, make a resolution, stop all kinds of entertainment, and save on all kinds of waste. All unnecessary and non-urgent expenses should be eliminated to prepare for saving the country and resisting violence. Moreover, at a time when the cost of living is rising, we should be keenly aware of the difficulty of maintaining our livelihood, live within our means, and be thrifty and diligent. These eight characters are our golden rule. Gentlemen, the disaster is urgent, the invaders are deep, the country is about to perish, and the race is about to be destroyed. If we continue to be complacent, we may not even have the opportunity to serve in the future. We may not even have the opportunity to gather in a hall like this today. Gentlemen, think about how many people outside the door want to find work but cannot. How many people have no home to return to? How many people have lost their jobs after withdrawing from Japanese businesses? How many people have been unemployed for a long time and are on the verge of desperation? These are all our compatriots. If one person is not able to obtain what he needs, it is our responsibility. What methods do you have to rescue these dying compatriots? Please remember these three words: 1. Prepare physical and academic strength. 2. Strive in one's respective position. 3. Restrain desires.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor Respectfully, I am writing to you. I recently read in your newspaper's "Voice of Resistance Against Japan" column on the 29th of this month that the main culprits of the alleged collusion between this station and Japan, namely Wei Renming, the director of the reporting department of this station, and two others, have already been dismissed and are under investigation. It is true that Wei Daming, the director of the reporting department of this station, has been suspended from his duties due to certain reasons. However, the alleged collusion with Japan is completely unfounded. Since the Shenyang Incident, this station has recognized the heavy responsibility it bears for international communications and has instructed its subordinates to redouble their efforts to work for the benefit of diplomatic opportunities. The nation is facing a crisis, and everyone with a sense of righteousness is trying to save the country. How could there be such a perverse and reckless act of colluding with the enemy? I am writing to request that your newspaper take immediate steps to correct this information to avoid confusion and to express my sincere gratitude. Respectfully, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications. October 29th.</p>
<p>Yesterday's "Talking About" column by Tingcao Zhai Fu in the "Industrial Civilization" section, on page 12, the character "如" (ru, as) in "如此人間" (ru ci ren jian, such a world) was mistakenly written as "加" (jia, add). This is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3>A Country Bumpkin Goes to Shanghai Again (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The country bumpkin set off that day. He actually had experience taking the train. He knew that the ones that were tightly closed on all sides were freight cars, the ones with half of the iron windows open were cattle cars, and that any human being should at least ride in a fourth-class car. He heard people say: taking the train divides people into different classes. Those who ride in first-class cars are first-class people, those who ride in second-class cars are second-class people, and those who ride in third and fourth-class cars are naturally third and fourth-class people. The country bumpkin should ride in a fourth-class car, but the last time he rode in a fourth-class car, he was angered by the vendor of spiced tea eggs. This time, he would be extravagant and ride in a third-class car to show off.</p>
<p>The last time he came back from Shanghai, he was hungry on the train. Just as the spiced tea egg vendor squeezed past him, the aroma of the star anise in the spiced tea eggs tempted him.</p>
<p>"How much does one spiced tea egg cost?" he asked, pretending to be a seasoned gourmet.</p>
<p>"Four for two dimes."</p>
<p>"How can eggs be so expensive? In our village, eggs are only eight copper coins each. Two dimes can buy six." The country bumpkin argued based on his local prices.</p>
<p>"Then smell the aroma. I won't charge you even one copper coin." The spiced tea egg vendor said venomously. Although the country bumpkin's stomach was rumbling, he dared not ask him any more questions. However, the aroma of the spiced tea eggs was deliberately teasing him.</p>
<p>He hated it. He thought that because he was riding in a fourth-class car, even the tea egg vendor looked down on him. Therefore, this time, he was determined to ride in a third-class car.</p>
<p>He strutted to the ticket window, but a person stood there and pushed him, shouting:</p>
<p>"Buy your ticket over there."</p>
<p>He looked up and saw a person wearing a yellow hat, yellow clothes and pants, yellow leather shoes, and a yellow face.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin thought to himself: When I was little, I heard my mother say that the emperor dressed like that, yellow from head to toe, so he was called the emperor. Isn't there no emperor anymore? But his manner and his majesty still seem like an emperor.</p>
<p>"I'm here to buy a ticket," the country bumpkin said boldly.</p>
<p>"Can't you see clearly? This is where first- and second-class tickets are sold." The person in yellow clothes glared at the country bumpkin.</p>

<h3>Financial News: Gold Price Drops 9.7 Taels</h3>
<p>Treacherous Waters Yesterday, the 20th, the benchmark gold price repeatedly declined, with turbulent waves. At noon, it hovered around 705 taels. In the afternoon, it suddenly broke through the 700-tael mark. The total turnover for the day was 16 taels, which was also substantial. As a result, it plunged by 10 taels. Due to a slight rise in the opening price, the exchange rate rebounded slightly. Subsequently, it stabilized slightly, but as the exchange rate trended towards relaxation, it turned weak again. However, there were occasional underlying currents. The market felt that the exchange rate was particularly loose, and various parties in the market were eager to sell. As the atmosphere deteriorated and the Indian exchange rate rose, the market fell into a weak state. In the face of a sudden storm, the price plummeted by more than 10 taels, from 702.4 taels to within 692 taels. The market was extremely fearful. Later, the Dalian gang and Tongtaichang and others covered their short positions, causing the price to rebound by three or four taels.</p>
<p>The market fluctuated intermittently. It opened in the morning with a drop of 1 tael and 3 mace, at 704.5 taels, with a large bar at another 1/16. The silver price did not move. Subsequently, due to purchases by Hongkangyong, Qianchangxiang, and Tongtaichang, it rose to 07.8 taels. The exchange rate was still loose. HSBC bought £1,756.25 in English gold, $32 in U.S. dollars, and $31.9375 for January delivery. Subsequently, the gold price fluctuated by more than 2 taels, from 05.23 to 06.23. The English gold price was up by 125, but the U.S. dollar price did not change, due to the small exchange rate difference. At this time, the gold price was around 06 taels. HSBC, Yongyu Da, and others sold. HSBC also released £1,775 in English gold for December delivery, causing the price to fall to 03 taels at 9:30 a.m. After that, it seemed to rise again, with fluctuations of just over 1 tael. Around 10 a.m., it had risen by more than 3 taels, due to purchases by Qianchangxiang, Chunyuan Yong, HSBC, Yongjuchang, and others. The English gold banks were mutually trading £1,781.25 to £1,775 for December and January delivery. Fellow traders also closed positions in $32 to $31.9375 in U.S. dollars for December delivery. It rose to 6.7 mace until 11 a.m., but soon retreated to 4.5 mace, then added half to 5.6 mace. However, the buying and selling prices of various firms varied. Shanghai absorbed £775 in English gold for January delivery. After 11:15 a.m., it gradually moved downward. Yuanmao, Hengchang Yong, and others all sold. The Indian exchange rate was up to 2 annas. By noon, the rate was 03.7 mace, with a posted price of 700 taels, 67 or 68 taels, for a discount of 63 to 64 taels.</p>
<p>The atmosphere deteriorated in the afternoon. The afternoon market opened flat at 03.8 mace. Subsequently, it retreated to 700 taels and 05 mace due to sales by Cuichangyong, Yuanmaoyong. Zhifengyong and Dadecheng bought, and at 2:10 p.m. it was 02.3 mace. Later, the market turned stormy, and sellers were eager. Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, Yuanheng Fuchang, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanrenyong, Yuanyongsheng, Yongfeng, and others all rushed to sell. The English gold companies, HSBC and Maihang, initially absorbed £1,793.75 for February and March delivery. Later, Japanese banks traded mutually at 8.1875. $32.50 U.S. dollars could be settled. The market was filled with a bleak and rainy atmosphere, with a tendency to fall sharply. The price plunged by more than 10 taels, breaking through 700 taels at 3 p.m. It was also heard that the Indian exchange rate had soared by 16 annas. At 3:30 p.m., the price was 691.8 taels. Qianchangxiang, Yongde, Tongtaichang, Danyyu, and others followed up, and Shunli and Wanxing also bought tirelessly. The banks also mutually traded £1,806.25 in English gold, so the market showed a moderate atmosphere. At 4:20 p.m., it was 96.2 mace. At the close of the market at 4:20 p.m., it was 96.1 mace, and it was suppressed again to within 6 mace. Compared to the posted price, it was down by 9.7 taels. It had fallen for three consecutive days, for a total of 14 taels and some odd cents. The highest gold price in the early market was 707.8 taels, and the lowest was 691.8 taels, a difference of more than 16 taels. The goods in the early market were 05 taels, 03.8 mace at noon, and 03.9 mace in the afternoon. The closing price was 95.5. The posted price was discounted by 64 to 65 taels, and 70 taels. The early market ledger rate for the replenishment water was 04 taels, and the afternoon rate was 96 taels. The net rate increased by 8.5 taels.</p>
<p>The selling pressure was particularly strong. According to the statistics on the table, Yuanmaoyong, Tongtaichang, Yongdexuchang, and Futaiheng all entered the market. Hongkangyong and Qianchangxiang entered and exited the market. Wanxing, Shunli, Yifengyong, Yuantai, and Yuhe had varying degrees of buying and selling. Fuchang, Yuren, and Hengchangyong sold more than they bought. In the afternoon, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Bingxing, Yifeng, Yongde, Hengyu, and Hengxing all entered the market. Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, and Daxingyong had a large number of buyers and sellers. Futaiheng, Chunyuanyong, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuanxingyong, Yuandayong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuankang, Yuansheng, and Shengfeng all sold. Cuichangyong and Hengchangyong sold first and then bought. The Dalian gang sold 600 to 700 bars and bought more than 1,500 bars. The Guang gang bought slightly more than 200 bars.</p>
<p>The futures market will be closed for three days after the horse racing (November 2, 3, and 4, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). During these days, due to the Autumn Horse Racing season, the banks and gold exchange will be open for half a day in the morning and will be closed in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Plummets</h3>
<p>Posted Rates Increase by Half a Point</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bank of England rose slightly, while the Bank of America remained unchanged. The market situation was flat. However, the English and American exchange rates suddenly plummeted, so HSBC increased the posted rates by half a point. The English gold rate was 125, at 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 375 cents. The Indian exchange rate increased by 1 yuan, the Japanese exchange rate by half a yuan, the Singapore exchange rate decreased by a small anna, and the Hong Kong exchange rate increased by 125, at 77 taels and 875 cents. However, the French and German exchange rates remained unchanged. The U.S. dollar also remained unchanged due to the small exchange rate difference, still at 31 yuan and 25 cents. The price of bank transactions was initially flat, then loose, and increasingly weak in the afternoon. The English gold rate was particularly depressed. As a result, it increased by 5,625 cents compared to the previous day. The U.S. dollar increased by only 375 cents. The benchmark gold price plummeted by 10 taels, breaking through the 700-tael mark. The Chinese merchant transactions were quite lively, with English gold transactions of approximately £200,000. Most transactions were short sales. Bombay also came to sell.

<h3>The Bank of China is Busy with Foreign Currencies During the End-of-October Competition Period</h3>
<p>Due to the current situation and various relationships in the business world, this year's end-of-October competition period was slightly less active in terms of new and transferred transactions compared to the previous period. However, the procedures were still too numerous and had to be streamlined. Yesterday was the day before the competition period, so everything that needed to be done was prepared and completed. As a result, the inflow and outflow of silver and money in the silver and money industries was particularly high, and the handling of procedures was also particularly busy. It was impossible to investigate the usual daily collection and settlement news. As for the trading of foreign currency in the market, it was particularly active in terms of securities settlement and supply and demand. The foreign currency price in the early market was 7 mace, 2 fen, 6 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu and a half. The price in the afternoon market was 7 mace, 2 fen, 6 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu and a half. The difference between the two markets was only 2 hao and a half. The early market volume of remittances was 3.66 million, and the afternoon market volume was 2.11 million, for a total of 5.78 million in the two markets. There was also a large amount of banknotes, with 155,000 in the early market and 120,000 in the afternoon market. Off-market banknotes totaled 230,000 in the early market and 190,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions in the early market totaled 1.6 million, and 1.3 million in the afternoon market. The exchange of foreign accounts and silver by the banks was huge, making it impossible to investigate. The interbank lending rate was 2 mace and 9 fen in the early market and 2 mace and 8 fen in the afternoon market, with a premium of 1 mace and 2 to 3 fen for checks and a posted rate of 1 mace and 2 fen for banks. The volume of foreign currency settlement and exchange by the money shops was also excessive. Due to time constraints, it was not possible to explore it in detail. Small money shops traded more than 1 million. The early market price for Jiangnan small silver was 6 mace, 5 fen, and 5 li, and the afternoon market price was 6 mace, 5 fen, and 6 li.

<h3>Securities Futures Delivery Process</h3>
<p>The total value of delivered bonds was 46,030,000</p>
<p>Today, the delivery of distant-month futures has been discontinued and physical delivery has been abolished.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange has suspended trading for three days in order to handle the delivery of bonds and futures. This is because the number of deliveries for October futures contracts for various bonds is still quite large, and the accounting is not as simple as before due to the various related factors such as physical delivery and delivery margin. The total number of deliveries was 46,030,000, of which consolidated tax accounted for the largest share, and the volume of 20-year customs duties, salt tax, and others was also large. The clearing of accounts was handled on Wednesday, and the amount cleared was 6,610,000 yuan. The amount actually delivered was still 39,420,000. However, the amount delivered in advance the day before had reached 22,800,000, so the amount delivered yesterday was actually only about 18,000,000. The delivery process was smooth. There was also a considerable amount of bank custody receipts. Trading will resume at the Securities Exchange today, and new trading in December futures will begin. The restriction on providing physical products for futures selling has been abolished. It is expected that futures contracts for important bonds will be opened. The following table shows the number of October futures contracts delivered and cleared (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Bond Category Clearing Amount Delivery Amount Total Delivery</p>
<p>Entire Sixes 10,000 1,300,000 1,520,000</p>
<p>Customs Duties 4,000 820,000 865,000</p>

<h3>The Stability of Raw Cotton and Cotton Yarn on the Cotton Yarn Delivery Day</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn Yesterday the situation stabilized, and there were no significant changes. The situation in the American cotton industry was also softened. The people's hearts are dim and listless. Therefore, each gang has no excitement. There were very few transactions because money is tight, financial activity is not alive, and the business cannot be developed. Fortunately, the underlying inventory is thin, and the market price can still insist on not moving. The stop-market one day is to arrange the end of this month's delivery. Statistical customer gangs bought 400 packages of the current product, the trade in the industry's 110 packages, the Mainland 80 packages, Shantou 100 packages, Guangdong 70 packages, Jiangxi 60 packages, Sichuan 50 packages, the market is average.</p>
<p>Cotton Yesterday's market was weak and the foreign cotton situation also felt weak, and the price of gold dropped, so the people's hearts are average. The foreign cotton business is still prosperous, and the sources account for 790 packages of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Shi Qu Mitt Order 35 75 Shinshin Factory entered 3,000 pieces that is installed for delivery to the factory, Lumit Order 34.10 Profit Factory entered 1,000 pieces and again</p>
<p>Bai Luoqu 32.25 Yong'an Factory entered 1,000 pieces in November and again</p>
<h3>Small Volume of Yarn Deliveries This Month</h3>
<p>The bidding for yarn in October started with a strong market sentiment at the beginning of the month. Due to the intense anti-Japanese movement, Japanese yarn was widely rejected, leading to insufficient supply of domestic yarn. This situation intensified, attracting a flood of speculative buyers. Sellers initially felt short, with prices reaching a high of 167 taels. However, some manufacturers engaged in hedging sales, slightly easing the market, which then hovered between 163 and 164 taels. Subsequently, due to the unstable political situation and tight credit conditions, some money shops sold, causing the market to weaken abruptly and fall by two or three taels. Although there was a shortage of buyers for deliveries at the end of the month, recipients were reluctant to take delivery due to high silver exchange rates, leading to a drop below the 158 taels mark. The opening price in the morning was 158 taels and two mace, and the final settlement price was 160 taels, totaling 6,200 bales. However, only ten shares of actual deliveries took place, along with 50 bales of Cai Kui Xing yarn. The remaining quantities were settled privately. The names and bale amounts of the brokers for both delivery and receipt are listed below:</p>

<h3>Brief Account of Cotton Deliveries This Month</h3>
<p>Delivered Goods: Huoji Cotton</p>
<p>The price of cotton for October delivery started between 33 taels and 4 mace 5 candareens. Both the Shanghai merchant guilds and some bulls had strong intentions to squeeze short sellers, believing that the domestic harvest would be poor and that supplies from various sources would be scarce. However, the global cotton industry was weak, and American cotton prices fell. The lowest price reached five and a half points. Although the Shanghai cotton market tried to maintain its position, it was unable to sustain it alone and fell to a low of 30 taels and 8.5 candareens. Later, as American cotton prices rebounded, the market followed suit. Towards the end of the month, two manufacturers withdrew their goods intended for delivery, indicating no intention to deliver. The Shanghai merchant guilds took delivery, causing the market price to rise sharply to 33 taels. The final settlement price was 32 taels and 5 candareens, totaling 18,200 piculs. Only two to three thousand piculs were actually delivered, all of which was Huoji cotton. The remaining quantities were settled privately. The names and bale amounts of the brokers for both delivery and receipt are listed below:</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in the American Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market showed signs of reaction, with fluctuating prices. Initially, the market was firm due to manufacturers purchasing forward contracts, but later weakened due to selling pressure from the South. Futures prices fell by two to five points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by eight points, while spot prices fell by six points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton saw slight selling from European exporters and Japanese traders. Speculators bought due to low exchange rates. Pingguoer fell by 0.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.75 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated 29th):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day (Shanghai Standard) British Cotton Compared to Previous Day (Shanghai Standard)</p>
<p>December: 6.660 (Flat), 27.80 January: 4.466 (Up 8), 32.00</p>

<p>Bairuoxi: 18,210 (Up 0.75), 29.80</p>
<h3>Stabilized Grain Prices in the River Rice Market</h3>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, supplies from various sources to Shanghai South were limited, but inventory in Pootung gradually thinned out, and sales in both urban and rural stores were sluggish. Moreover, it was near the end of October in the Gregorian calendar, so firms on both sides were settling accounts, which dampened market sentiment. The price of new japonica rice temporarily stabilized. There was little old kiln-dried Baige rice available, and demand was active, but the limited quantities fetched high prices close to the corner. Supplies of white and wild paddy rice gradually decreased. Although movement in this city was not smooth, prices rose slightly by one or two candareens. Both new imported Du Jian rice were selling at stable prices, and the market was stable. Bian Yin Yuan wine merchants had not yet started operations, so the situation remained stable.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Yesterday, the rice market in Xin Zha saw more sellers than buyers. Opening prices fluctuated by close to one candareen. The price of top-grade new japonica rice was similar to yesterday. The price of medium-grade rice rose by one candareen. Kiln-dried white paddy rice remained stable. The route for Lu Bu Jian rice was limited. Imported Jian rice was selling quickly, and the price fell by five cents. Demand for glutinous rice was scarce, and the price slightly decreased. Supplies from the interior, including the 24th and 5th varieties and various river factory goods, totaled 4,230 piculs.</p>
<h3>Continued New Transactions in Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw falling prices and sentiment due to repeated selling by foreign firms. Foreign rice continued to arrive, while demand in this area was limited. Zhen Xing only sold 500 bags yesterday at a price of $10.30. There were few return transactions in forward rice. The opening price for 100 tons of November delivery was 5.1 taels, and the price for 100 tons of April delivery was 5.3 taels. New transactions included Jardine Matheson selling 2,000 tons at only 5.22 taels, for delivery in March and April.</p>
<h3>Market for Wheat Flour Strengthens and Then Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat flour market opened with mixed reports of the prices of foreign wheat. Chicago wheat was down about one candareen, while Canadian wheat was up three or four candareens. As a result, initial market sentiment was flat. The market was not actually short of supplies this month, and the initial frenzy had softened. However, deferred delivery months saw active buying due to hurried short covering and general temporary bullishness, causing prices to rise. The market rose by 1.5 cents. In the afternoon, the market opened steadily, but then factories gradually offered to sell, causing external sentiment to gradually weaken. The market fell back by one cent from its highest point. Looking at the market for future months, if flour sales improve, the market should remain stable. As a result, the current month fell by two cents, October fell by 0.75 candareens, December and January each fell by 0.5 candareens, and February and March each fell by 0.25 candareens.</p>
<h3>Good Conclusion to the Wheat Futures Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed an initial sign of weakness, followed by a strengthening trend. In the morning, foreign wheat prices were mixed, and due to the previous day's excessive gains, both inside and outside traders were hesitant. However, since spot goods had already been withdrawn, the majority of people remained firm, and the market gradually rebounded. By the afternoon, the momentum was even better. The price for November delivery reached a high of 3.8 taels, rising another cent compared to the previous listing. However, the increase was too sharp, and bulls continued to sell. Deferred delivery months were generally stable. As a result, November delivery was up 3 cents from the previous day, December was up 5 cents, January and February were each up 4 cents, and March was up 1 cent.</p>
<h3>Active Trading in Raw and White Sugar</h3>
<p>Taikoo Sugar Also Opened with 5,000 Bags</p>
<p>Sugar Prices Rose Consistently in the Designated Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's news from the producing regions showed that the current price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.34275, and the price of New York sugar for December was 1.32, up three cents from the previous telegram. The price for March of the following year was 1.27, up two cents, the price for May was 1.31, up one cent, and the price for September was 1.40, with no change. The current and futures prices of Javanese sugar also remained stable. Both the association market and the designated market saw active buying, and prices rose steadily. The transaction price of Dutch 24th grade raw and white sugar ranged from 11.22 to 11.25 taels; medium white sugar was 10.08 taels; Dutch cotton white sugar ranged from 11 to 11.05 taels. Market sentiment was strong, and Taikoo sugar B mark was traded at 11.22 to 11.25 taels, DY mark at 11.1 taels, HX mark at 12 to 12.05 taels, and HM mark at 11.55 taels. Trading was brisk, and the market was generally strong with potential for further gains. There was active trading in spot raw and white sugar, all for delivery before November, totaling over 4,000 tons. Jardine Matheson sold 500 tons, Yuan Ji sold 1,000 tons, and Hua Xin sold over 1,000 tons, priced at [Dutch currency] 5.575 yuan. Shun Quan Long offered 750 tons, and Jardine Skinner and Bing Chang also offered 300 to 500 tons each, priced at Dutch currency 5.55 yuan, all new regulations plus tax. The firms were taking action due to the expectation that starting in December, there would be a 10% additional tariff, so there were many buyers.</p>
<h3>Gradual Price Increase in Black Melon Seeds for Northern and Southern Goods</h3>
<p>The price of black melon seeds has been gradually increasing due to tight land prices and scarce arrivals. Market inventory is also low, so prices for both top and bottom grade goods in Shanghai have risen. Recently, Zhongmou seeds were offered at over 17 taels, and the price of Tianjin seeds has risen by two or three taels due to purchases by various firms. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade goods such as Jikui seeds was 24 taels, medium-grade Jizi was 22 taels, and Xukui seeds were 20 taels, ranging down to 19 to 12 taels. Firms with low inventory were watching the market and not selling, with little hope of easing until a large batch of goods arrives.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang and Hubei White Filature Silk: 50 Bales Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Preparing to Deliver Period Silk to European Firms at the End of This Month</p>
<p>Zhejiang and Hubei Model Silk Factory's improved white filature silk, with its even color and clean strands, is favored by European and American firms. The amount of silk offered this month is limited. In addition to the silk already delivered, another 50 bales of Datong Bridge and other brands of white filature silk arrived yesterday, preparing for today's delivery of this month's term silk to foreign firms. The factory has already picked up the silk from the Shanghai office for sorting and preparation for today's delivery.</p>
<h3>Continued Quiet Sales of European and American Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firms' silk market continued to be quiet. Although there were a few Shanghai-bound telegrams for Lyon white filature silk, the offered price actually fell. There was no reply telegram from New York, and the market atmosphere was calm. Yesterday, only [unclear character] Fu and others imported 15 bales of Sichuan yellow filature silk, Samsung imported 3 bales of cotton-spun reeling silk, and Ke Chang and others imported 13 bales of yellow Zusi silk. Prices remained weak.</p>
<h3>European Sales of Zhenmei Green Tea are Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' tea market in Shanghai saw firms such as Lu Zhuang Tu Zhuang, Jin Long, Yihe, Xiehe, and Yuansheng purchasing Zhenmei green tea, and trading was quite active. Sales of Wu Yuan tea to the US have been sluggish for a long time. Recently, firms such as Hua Cha Jin Jiang have also been purchasing small quantities, but prices have fallen by six or seven to over ten taels. Inventory of Gong Xi tea is also low. Only Zhenmei green tea still has over 10,000 cases in stock, but the route for sales remains sluggish.</p>
<h3>Arrival of New Stock of French Wire Nails</h3>
<p>Since Sichuan merchants frantically purchased French wire nails, inventory has been depleted. Therefore, those who wanted to replenish their stocks later could hardly find any goods to buy. Yesterday, a new stock of over 4,000 barrels arrived at Pootung's New Taikoo Warehouse, revitalizing the market. The asking price for all types is estimated at 8.75 taels, while the price for a single bundle is 2 or 3 mace higher.</p>
<h3>Prolonged Slump in Pig Lead</h3>
<p>Since the export merchants stopped purchasing pig lead, the market has been quiet for a long time. Although various colleagues have been trying hard to sell, the sales route is not smooth. Furthermore, domestic lead is frequently arriving, and overseas prices have weakened, making the market particularly weak. The estimated price is 14.75 taels per sheet, and the price of domestic lead is estimated at 14.5 taels.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decrease in Datong Coal Arrivals</h3>
<p>Since the boycott of Japanese coal, sales of Datong briquette and flake coal in Shanghai have been quite brisk. However, in the past two weeks, arrivals have decreased sharply, leading to a severe shortage of coal in various warehouses. The reason for this is that the water level in Tianjin is currently low, making loading difficult. As a result, the market price for sales has also been unusually firm. Yesterday, the market price was 16.75 taels per ton for screened briquette coal, 16.25 taels for standard coal, and 13.75 taels for coal flakes.</p>

<p>Discussion Continues Today</p>
<p>Representatives of Both Sides Telegraph Central Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Fourth National Congress Postponed</p>
<p>Representatives from Beijing and Guangdong held their fourth preparatory meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM in the same location. Li Shizeng and Zou Lu were absent due to illness. The principles of the central political system reform plan have been completely passed. Detailed methods will be further discussed in today's fifth preparatory meeting. A summary of yesterday's proceedings is recorded below:　　Minutes of the Fourth Meeting　The general assembly released the minutes of the fourth meeting yesterday as follows: Representatives present: Wu Chaochu, Zhang Jingjiang, Cai Yuanpei, Li Wenfan, Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Zhang Ji, Chen Mingshu; Chairman: Wu Chaochu; Recording Secretaries: Zhong Tianxin, Qiu Jinxian, Yang Zongjiong, Cheng Zhonghang. Proceedings were conducted as usual. Resolutions: (1) All news released by this meeting must be agreed upon by all representatives, signed by the chairman of the day's meeting, and handed over to the journalists for publication. The external reports of the meeting's discussion process differ greatly from the facts, which inevitably leads to misunderstandings. A statement should be made. (2) Representatives from both sides should telegraph their respective central party headquarters to request a temporary postponement of the Fourth National Congress, and the date should be set after both sides have reached an agreement. (3) The principles of central political system reform have been passed (Principles): (A) To enable the five Yuans to be independent and responsible and to exercise their powers to realize the spirit of the five-power constitution; (B) To simplify the political system and organization to increase political efficiency and avoid the problems of duplication, circuitousness, and dispersed responsibility; (C) To make political democratization practical, the central political organs should add elected members to make the relationship between the government and the people increasingly intimate and to jointly bear the goal of establishing constitutional government. (4) It was decided to hold the fifth meeting at 9:00 AM on October 31 to continue the discussion of the central political reform plan.</p>
<p>Situation During the Meeting　Of the eleven representatives from Beijing and Guangdong, all attended except Li Shizeng and Zou Lu, who were still absent due to illness. The meeting officially began at approximately 10:00 AM. Before the meeting, the representatives saw the remarks made by a certain Central Committee member from Nanjing in the newspapers, which they believed differed from the facts and could cause misunderstandings. For the sake of a peaceful future, the representatives from both sides carefully studied the matter and drafted a joint statement to be released at the adjournment of the meeting (the statement is recorded separately). The discussion then began and lasted until 12:30 PM. As a result, three items regarding the political system reform plan have been passed in principle. It is said that several detailed methods have also been passed and will be released together after the entire meeting approves them today.</p>
<p>Jointly Issued Statement　Zhang Ji and Cai Yuanpei, representatives of the Central Government to Guangdong for peace negotiations, together with Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, Li Wenfan, and others, issued a joint statement saying: "Recently, we saw in the newspapers that a certain Central Committee member from Nanjing said that the telegram to retire from office was based on the original proposal from Hong Kong at the time, and that it was originally agreed to abolish the Guangdong government after the agreement was reached. It was originally set before the agreement was reached, and then changed to after the agreement was reached in Shanghai, etc. After checking the draft telegrams of both parties that were drafted at that time, we saw that there was no mention of 'before the agreement' or 'after the agreement' in the newspapers, and both parties agreed to release them at the same time. The formal release date has not yet arrived, and whether there will be any revisions in the wording when it is released in the future is another question. Based on the facts at the time, we jointly and responsibly declare this to avoid misunderstandings." Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Li Wenfan, October 30.</p>
<p>Guangdong Representatives' Telegram　Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and others jointly issued a telegram yesterday, saying: "To all national organizations, party departments at all levels, and comrades: Since Zhao Ming (Wang Jingwei) and others arrived in Shanghai, we have received telegrams from some organizations and comrades, saying that we should be united against foreign enemies and go to Nanjing as soon as possible. We came here with the utmost sincerity to seek party and government unity and national unity. In recent days of meetings, we have made decisions on the guidelines for diplomatic progress, and we have also formally begun to discuss various difficult issues of the party and the country. Why has the party not been united for several years? It is because the democratic centralization system has not yet been restored. Why has the country not been unified? It is because we have not been able to follow the National Reconstruction Program and implement political tutelage to complete democratic politics. All these problems need to be resolved. Only by strengthening the foundation of the country internally can we resist powerful countries externally. In December of the sixteenth year, the preparatory meeting for the Fourth Central Committee Plenary Session was held in Shanghai. The current situation is the same, so the meeting is also being held in Shanghai. In short, the important task of this meeting is to allow free will to be fully expressed and to fundamentally resolve the various difficult issues of the party and the country. We hereby send a special telegram in reply, hoping that you will understand." Wang, Sun, Wu, Li, Zou, Chen, 30th.</p>
<p>Fourth National Congress Postponed　The Guangdong representatives sent a telegram yesterday regarding the postponement of the Fourth National Congress, saying: "To the Extraordinary Meeting of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees in Guangzhou: It was resolved at today's meeting that representatives from both sides should telegraph their respective central party headquarters to set the date for the Fourth National Congress after both sides have reached an agreement. We hereby report." Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, Chen Youren, 30th.</p>
<p>Conversation Meeting at Mr. Hu's Residence　Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, Guangdong representatives Sun Ke, Wang Jingwei, Chen Youren, and others drove to Mr. Hu's residence on Ma'erxi'ai Road to hold a conversation meeting. It had been arranged in advance that Mr. Wu Chaochu would arrive before Mr. Sun and the others. Li Wenfan was also present. After everyone gathered, they had a secret conversation with Mr. Hu Zhantang. It is said that they discussed matters related to the peace conference to promote its early success. They talked for a long time. Mr. Wu left at approximately 6:00 PM, and Wang, Sun, Chen, and others left at approximately 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's Conversation　Yesterday's newspapers reported that a certain Central Committee member in Nanjing advocated that all state affairs should be resolved by the Fourth National Congress and that the Central Committee could designate representatives from the first and second sessions to hold the Fourth National Congress to discuss and decide on state affairs. Reporters specially visited Mr. Hu Zhantang, who has been most active in promoting peace, to inquire about his opinions on this matter. Mr. Hu gave the following remarks: "Seeing that the party and the country are disintegrating and diplomacy is losing its power and humiliating the country, I came to Shanghai with great grief and indignation at the request of both Guangdong and Ningxia to conduct peace talks, hoping to use the unified strength of the whole country as a backing for diplomacy with Japan. After arriving in Shanghai, I immediately sent a telegram urging Guangdong to elect representatives to come north to hold a meeting. After receiving the telegram, Guangdong immediately appointed Mr. Wang, Sun, Wu, and Li as representatives and arrived in Shanghai on October 21. I also agreed in person to hold a meeting in Shanghai and promised to send representatives to Shanghai immediately after the telegram was sent. Later, Mr. Jiang returned to Nanjing first, and the Guangdong representatives sent a letter on that day's meeting results. Mr. Jiang also replied on the 24th, entrusting Mr. Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, Zhang Puquan, Cai Jiemin, and Chen Zhenru as representatives to meet with the Guangdong representatives. This is the process of opening the peace conference, which should be known to the people of the country. I hope that everyone can be sincere, discuss everything, and decide on two draft telegrams based on the results of the discussion in Hong Kong between Mr. Cai, Zhang, Chen, and Mr. Jingwei and Zhesheng and Mr. Pei San. One is Mr. Jiang's telegram, and the other is the Guangdong government's telegram, advocating that the peace and unity conference should resolve to reorganize the unified government. After the unified government is established, Mr. Jiang will be dismissed, and the Guangdong government will be abolished. The resolution details are based on the plan to organize the unified government to achieve consistency between the north and the south and to seek reform of internal and external affairs and to open up a new path for future politics to comfort the longings of the national masses. However, today, the so-called Central Committee member from the Beijing side suddenly made a statement, advocating that all state affairs should be resolved by the Fourth National Congress and that representatives from the first and second sessions should be designated as representatives to the Fourth National Congress as much as possible. Then, there is almost no need for empty discussions, and we can wait until we are sitting in the National Congress to speak. At the same time, the Nanjing Central News Agency also released news, saying that the negotiation process released in Shanghai differs greatly from the facts and that the original meaning of the past is erased. Chairman Jiang seems to advocate seeking perfection and states that he will listen to the public opinion of the Central Committee and that he will never lightly abandon his responsibility when the country is in trouble. I will not discuss whether the so-called public opinion of the Central Committee and Mr. Jiang's personal advocacy are true. However, based on my speculation, Mr. Jiang should not be untrustworthy because he respects the resolution of this peace conference, which is expected by the whole country, and his personal promises. However, the so-called Central Committee member, I don't know who he is, his destruction of the progress of the peace and unity conference can be said to be meticulous. Since the representatives of Ningxia and Guangdong gathered in Shanghai, the Beijing side first used the name of diplomatic urgency to send a telegram urging me to enter Beijing that night and at the same time issued a declaration supporting the League of Nations to take the Japanese army to withdraw on the 16th of next month. At this time, it is suddenly said that diplomacy is urgent, and urging people to enter Beijing cannot but make people ask questions. Later, the party departments at all levels belonging to the Beijing side sent thousands of identical telegrams urging me to enter Beijing, and when the peace conference discussed and released the telegrams of both parties, some domestic generals planned to send telegrams saying that the head of state should not be easily telegrammed, etc., which made people wonder whether the Beijing side was sincerely negotiating peace. However, the party department is not to blame, because some people may have urged it to do so, so it cannot but obey orders. The military is also not to blame, because in China, where politics and party affairs are controlled by guns and bullets, this kind of article is commonplace. Only the so-called Central Committee member also published this discussion that destroys the peace and unity conference to delay the unity of the country, which cannot but make people horrified. Whether the peace and unity conference will continue to be held in the future, I am not involved in this peace conference, so I am not in a position to speculate. However, my personal opinion is that I hope that both Ningxia and Guangdong can still abide by their promises so that the peace conference can proceed smoothly. At the same time, I hope that they can also make great determination in the reform of diplomacy and internal affairs in the future so that they can achieve success. As for the opinions on convening the Fourth National Congress, I have already expressed them some time ago and will not go into details now."</p>
<p>Zou Lu's Illness Has Slightly Improved　Guangdong representative Zou Lu's illness has slightly improved after being diagnosed and treated by Chinese and Western medicine yesterday. The doctor said that Mr. Zou had a slight fever and a slight pain in his throat, but there was no major problem. He closed his doors to visitors for the past two days. Mr. Zou was unable to attend yesterday morning's fourth preparatory meeting, and he was also unable to attend the conversation meeting at Mr. Hu's residence that night. He will probably recover within a few days.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's Telegram of Condolences for Mr. Gu's Death　Hu Zhantang sent a telegram of condolences for Mr. Gu Xiangdong yesterday, saying: "To the Extraordinary Meeting of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Guangzhou National Government: I received a telegram and was shocked to learn that Mr. Gu Xiangdong passed away at 6:00 PM on the evening of Jian. The country is in trouble, and the old man has suddenly passed away. Both public and private relations are extremely painful. We can only work hard to continue Mr. Gu's legacy and comfort his spirit. I am writing this telegram with great sorrow, and I beg you to send condolences to Mr. Gu's family on my behalf." Hu Hanmin kowtows.</p>
<p>Telegrams from Three District Party Departments　The National Society said that the third, fourth, and seventh district party departments of this city jointly sent a telegram regarding the recent situation yesterday, saying (the title is omitted): "Alas, what day is today? Tens of millions of disaster victims in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins are waiting to be fed. Tens of millions of people in the Northeast are being trampled under the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism. The survival of the nation hangs by a thread, and the people's resentment is accumulating, and our party is almost the target of arrows. The rise and fall of the Chinese nation also depends on whether our party's seniors can unite in good faith and shoulder this arduous mission. Today is the time when our party comrades will be judged for their merits and demerits to the country and the nation. Who can not repent of the mistakes they have made and the fear of disintegration? Since the Guangdong Committee came to Shanghai to make peace and unity, a glimmer of light has appeared. All party comrades hope that the seniors will unite in good faith from now on and that all past grievances will disappear. The people of the country especially hope that the party's disputes will be eliminated from now on and that saving the party and reviving the country will be effective. Therefore, today is definitely not the time to discuss personal advancement and retreat and partial interests. It is time to gather all the talents of the party to save the country's difficulties, respect public opinion, and unite against foreign enemies. We cannot delay any longer. The central and Guangdong committees are all seniors of our party. Since they are keenly aware of the interests of the nation, they should immediately take a trip to Beijing, enrich the central government, and contribute to the great cause. If the Japanese army does not comply with the League of Nations resolution and delays the withdrawal of troops, then how should we prepare? If they comply with the resolution and withdraw troops, then how should we prepare? How to raise food and clothing for tens of millions of disaster victims in the cold winter? How to eliminate the banditry in the disaster areas? These are all urgent tasks, and it is not appropriate for the seniors to stay in the concession and discuss the Tao leisurely to seize the opportunity. The issue of the political system is related to the foundation of the country. We can seek guidance from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and do not need to waste time arguing. The party's system of law should not be changed rashly due to the disputes of a few people, which would lead the party and the country into a state of conflict. The survival of the party and the country and the merits and demerits depend on whether the seniors can sacrifice their personal prejudices to make a decision. I hope that all comrades in the country will rise up and appeal so that the great cause of peace and unity can be completed. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. Jointly kowtowing from the third, fourth, and seventh district party departments of Shanghai."</p>
<p>Declaration of Various Trade Unions　The Zheng Declaration of Various Trade Unions in the City Supporting the Peace and Unity Conference states: "To Mr. Jiang Jieshi in Nanjing, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Sun Zhesheng in Shanghai, and all newspapers in provinces, cities, and counties, and to the public of compatriots at home and abroad: Since the Kuomintang has been in power (omitted in the middle), this year, the unprecedented natural disasters in history and the unique foreign troubles in the world have come together. The suffering of the people and the danger of the country's position are more shocking than those of China today. At this critical moment, it is time for the public to seek to save the country, and the most important way is true peace. Fortunately, both Ningxia and Guangdong have sent representatives to Shanghai with the intention of saving the country to hold a peace and unity conference to seek the great plan of establishing and saving the country and establishing the foundation of governance. Our people, who are in deep water and scorching fire, have heard of this auspicious and peaceful move, pray with incense and thunderous cheers. Our association has briefly expressed its sincerity in urging the convocation of the Peace and Unity Conference amid the public's desire for governance. Now the conference has been convened as scheduled, and we are fortunate that all parties can deeply understand public opinion and cooperate with each other in fact. How can we imagine that the words of speculation are suddenly spreading in the streets when the formal meeting is about to open? Alas, the day of seeking to save the country is definitely not the time for heroes to compete for the throne. If anyone still harbors selfish intentions of suspicion and suspicion of each other or uses violence and fraud to control everything, obstruct and resist the progress of peace and unity, then the responsibility for destruction will lie with him. Our association swears to lead more than 800,000 workers in the city who have no weapons to use their responsibility as citizens to save the country in the spirit of peace and saving the country. We will not hesitate to paint our brains and return and remove all the treacherous villains who destroy peace. Then we will use all our strength to support the realization of peace and unity and exhaust the country to resist Japan. What our association loves is the country, and what we hold is the doctrine. This ambition and this heart will never change until we die. Being in the center of the national revolutionary labor movement, we cannot bear to see the fall of China without saving it. Therefore, we do not avoid hardships and dangers and use our silent voice to exhort all parties to repent. If, after the unification is achieved, the unified government should be awakened to the inappropriateness of armed heroes and make all political and military affairs bow to public opinion and party rule, so as to restore the spirit of good governance and revive the great cause of revolution. As for the important strategies for saving the country and the new reforms of the party and government, we will follow the people of the country and contribute to the conference in detail. We hope that the public officials of the party and the country will be virtuous people of the time and will resolutely give the national will the opportunity to express itself freely and work together to practice the grand rules of the republic. I sincerely hope that this declaration will be accepted.

<p>Anti-Japanese Association of Shanghai County's Telegram　The Anti-Japanese Association of Shanghai County sent a telegram to the nation, saying: "To all newspapers and compatriots across the country: The destruction of our country is imminent. All those who are not born traitors are striving for domestic peace and unity to deal with foreign countries so that the Republic of China can reform its internal affairs to achieve the Three Principles of the People. Recently, representatives from both Ningxia and Guangdong have resolved their prejudices, gathered in Shanghai, and are conducting peace talks. This is truly a fortunate event for our country and what the people of the country earnestly hope for. However, Japanese nature is difficult to tame, and its methods are vicious. Since it can occupy our eastern provinces in a few hours, how difficult is it to occupy our entire country in a few months? Therefore, peace and unity should be expedited in the shortest possible time so that we will not be unprepared and there will be no hope for national salvation. If there are madmen who sacrifice the overall interests of the country for personal gain amid the sounds of peace and unity, making peace and unity on the verge of extinction, then the people of the country should deal with them unanimously and strictly punish them. This is the responsibility that a republican citizen should have. I hope that our people will take it together and not be greedy for life and sit idly by while the country perishes. I am extremely anxious." Seal of the Anti-Japanese Association of Shanghai County.</p>
<p>Opinions of the All-Zhejiang Public Association　The All-Zhejiang Public Association's telegram states: "To all organizations: After reading the newspaper reports of the proposals of Mr. Li, Xu, Cheng, Zhang, and Chen, their sincerity in loving the people, their loyalty to planning for the party, and the far-reaching diplomatic planning and the precise investigation of political principles, although only a few points are mentioned, they are truly grasping the essential points. Our association's members have long been concerned about the people and the sky, and Confucius has been thinking about politics. After repeated discussions and inquiries, they all agree that this is truly a crucial plan to save the country. If it can be implemented, it will surely help the times and benefit the country. Therefore, we will use our meager knowledge to add supplementary opinions, which are listed as follows: (1) Since association and assembly are completely free rights of citizens, they should not need to be approved by the party department again. Newspapers represent public opinion, and except for military affairs, strict prohibition, absolute censorship should not be carried out in peacetime to protect the people's right to obtain true freedom. (2) Before the National Assembly is convened, the Legislative Yuan should increase the number of legislative members, who should be allocated and elected by people's organizations according to the quota to allow the people to participate in legislative power as soon as possible. (3) The people must have the strength to defend against foreign insults. The central government should immediately formulate and implement the compulsory militia system throughout the country and order all provinces and cities to send personnel to various townships to train them uniformly to establish a foundation for the people to strengthen themselves and defend the country. If these humble suggestions are approved, we hope that everyone will agree and express their great opinions to pray for the welfare of the people of the country. In writing this, I cannot help but be apprehensive." Sincerely from the All-Zhejiang Public Association.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Party Departments of Two Railways Telegraph Shi Zhaoji</p>
<p>Strive to Force the Violent Sun to Withdraw Its Troops</p>
<p>The telegram from the party departments of the two railways to Shi Zhaoji states: "The country is in a crisis. To His Excellency Shi Zhaoji, Chinese Minister to London, England, and the delegation: This time, the violent Sun abruptly sent troops to occupy our Liaoning and Jilin, defile our national rights, trample on our people, violate international integrity, and destroy world peace. All mankind is indignant. Comrades, representing the government, attended the League of Nations meeting and argued with reason. Finally, they won the sympathy of various countries and ordered Japan to withdraw its troops unconditionally. Your fighting spirit is admirable. However, Japan is cunning and still hopes for the understanding of the League of Nations to satisfy its desire for plunder. Please continue to work hard and fight to the end, and justice will be in the hearts of the people, and you will surely achieve the final victory. In writing this telegram, I am filled with gratitude." Executive Committee of the Special Party Department of the Kuomintang on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways.</p>
<h3>Party Members Swear to Resist Japan and Save the Country</h3>
<p>Strive to Advocate and Be a Vanguard for the People</p>
<p>Never Buy or Sell Japanese Goods for Life</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of this city issued an order yesterday to the party departments of each district to instruct the subordinate branches to hold an oath-taking ceremony for resisting Japan and saving the country when convening the party member congress. The order and oath are recorded below:</p>
<p>Order: "For the purpose of issuing an order, since the violent Sun invaded and occupied Liaoning and Jilin, the people of the country have hated it with a passion. They are filled with indignation and are rising up to save the country. There is more than one way to save the country, but at present, the most important way to curb the violent Sun's fierce flames is economic severance. All parts of the country have risen up like a storm and are proceeding separately. We, as party members, have the responsibility to set an example and lead the people. For this economic severance with Japan, we should be a vanguard for the people and strive to advocate it. This association has formulated a 'Oath to Resist Japan and Save the Country for Party Members of the Kuomintang Special Municipality of Shanghai,' and hereby informs all associations to immediately instruct their subordinate branches to hold an oath-taking ceremony when convening the party member congress to be vigilant. If the country is not there, what is the party? I hope that all comrades will, after taking the oath, use their perseverance and courage to encourage themselves and others to never forget so that we can curb the fierce flames and benefit the party and the country. This is of utmost importance. The relevant oath will be brought and used by the members of this association who attend. It will not be distributed in advance. After the oath is taken, it will be kept by each branch for inspection. Please also be informed. This order."</p>
<p>Oath: "I swear that I recognize Japanese imperialism as the greatest enemy of our party and country and swear to fight it to the end. From now on, I swear that I will never buy or sell Japanese goods for life, and I will not cooperate with the Japanese, and I will persuade my relatives and friends to implement it together. If I violate the oath, I am willing to be expelled from the party. I solemnly swear."</p>
<h3>Committee Meeting to Implement Severance of Relations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's committee to implement the severance of economic relations with Japan held its second standing committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Ye Jia and the following resolutions were passed: (1) A letter from the Iron Industry Association stated that Yongji Iron Shop's account books were taken away by the Anti-Japanese Association. They requested intervention for their return. Furthermore, the association's inspectors did not cooperate with the inspection teams and inspected shops of the same trade independently. They requested a letter to correct this. As for whether the inspection teams can collect the Japanese goods sold and stored by businesses in the same trade and report to request disposal, they also requested instructions. Resolved: (1) Send a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association to promptly investigate and</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>return the account books and records. (2) Send a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association, requiring future inspections of businesses in various industries to be carried out in close cooperation with the inspection teams of each industry. (3) Sealing up Japanese goods is permitted for storage in public warehouses, but the quantity and date of import must be promptly reported. (2) A letter from Xin Kang Coal Shop stated that the Charcoal Industry Association reported that the shop would resume sales with Sanxing, which was not true. They requested verification. Resolved: Forward to the Investigation Section. (3) Regarding the sealing up of Japanese goods in various industries, the deadline to report the import date and quantity within three weeks has passed, but many have not complied. A resolution was passed on how to handle this: Notify the inspection teams of each industry to promptly report the Japanese goods that have already been sealed up. Those that have not been sealed up must be sealed up immediately, pending review. (4) Regarding the solicitation of goods samples from various industries, it was resolved to send personnel to collect them from the Dongzhuang Public Office. (5) The Silk and Satin Industry Association stated that Japanese goods from non-member businesses that have not been reported for inspection cannot be dealt with. A resolution was passed to send a letter to the association requesting a list of names and addresses of non-member businesses so that personnel can be sent to cooperate in the inspection. (6) The Metal Industry Association stated that old Japanese goods stored by businesses in the same trade have already been sealed up voluntarily. It is scheduled to be sealed again by the association on November 1st. They requested personnel to be sent to cooperate with the inspection team to ensure prudence.

(7) Feng Zhongxiang proposed to send letters to the Freight Trucking Industry Association and the Rental Car Industry Association, informing their members that they must not transport goods for the Japanese in the future, otherwise the vehicles will be detained, and to report on the handling situation. (8) Mao Chunpu proposed that the inspection teams of each industry be notified that if any non-member business refuses inspection, they should report to the association immediately so that personnel can be sent to cooperate in the inspection. Resolved: Passed.</p>
<h3>Encouraging the Acceptance of Chinese Workers from Japanese Factories</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the industry associations yesterday, stating: "Received Instruction No. 327 from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, which states: 'For your information, the Third District Party Headquarters submitted a report, requesting the establishment of a domestic goods factory to accommodate Chinese workers from Japanese factories. Please adopt and implement this suggestion.' Accordingly, we are enclosing a copy of the submittal and instruct your association to persuade merchants to invest in the factory at any time in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers and benefit the anti-Japanese campaign. This is of utmost importance.'" Attached was a copy of the submittal to the association. In view of this, and that the severance of economic relations with Japan has been unified nationwide, and that establishing domestic goods factories to accommodate Chinese workers from Japanese factories is a crucial part of the anti-Japanese work, the instruction was recorded along with the original submittal and forwarded to you. It is hoped that your association will take this into account, vigorously promote and widely advise accordingly.</p>
<h3>Request to Remove Japanese Merchants' Advertisements from Railways</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to a certain advertising company, stating: "We are writing to inform you that according to reports, countless advertisements for Japanese goods are planted along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, all of which are handled by a certain advertising company in Shanghai. The company's trademark is painted at the bottom of each sign, which is astonishing. It has been found that the person in charge of the company also has the obligation and mission to investigate Japanese goods in the same industry. We hereby expose this and request that your association remove them within a limited time and severely punish them as a warning to those who use public office for private gain." Upon receipt, the association stated, "To resist Japan and save the country, it is especially important to lead by example. As a representative of the same industry, you should first earnestly implement this to set an example for the public. In view of the aforementioned situation, we hereby send a special letter to inform you that all advertisements for Japanese goods along the railways must be removed immediately to show your patriotic enthusiasm and anti-Japanese determination. Please investigate and handle this matter and reply as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Work in Various Circles</h3>
<p>The National Medicine Association Actively Resists Japan: The National Medicine Association held its second propaganda committee meeting at 8 PM the night before last. Yang Bofan, He Yunsheng, Ni Hengfu, Zhang Ruwei, and others attended and resolved to address the issue of Japanese goods being disguised as domestic medicine. The measures included: (1) Informing the National Medicine Industry Association to explain that Japanese goods disguised as domestic medicine not only harm the economy but also endanger lives, and requesting them to relay this to pharmacies to ensure that they do not disguise Japanese goods. (2) Notifying all members to never cooperate with the Japanese and to cease all relations and dealings. (3) Notifying all members to add a wooden stamp of "Severance of Economic Relations with Japan" to prescriptions. They also resolved several other important issues and adjourned at 10 PM.</p>
<p>Doctors Association Issues Survey Forms: The Shanghai Doctors Association, in view of the rampant behavior of the violent Japanese, is sparing no effort in planning anti-Japanese work. So far, in addition to compiling a reference list of Japanese medicines, which was sent to members and doctors across the country to use alternatives to unanimously sever economic relations with Japan, it has also organized crash courses in battlefield rescue for the needs of volunteer troops from all walks of life. Now, a survey form for voluntary mobilization for enemy defense and self-defense has been compiled, which was approved by the 13th executive committee meeting of the 5th session and sent to members yesterday. The notice stated: "We are writing to inform you that with foreign insults imminent and national crisis urgent, although our people deeply love peace and trust the League of Nations with utmost sincerity, we must make adequate preparations for enemy defense and self-defense. In addition to military mobilization, which should be prepared and handled by the government, other work related to military affairs should be prepared by relevant groups themselves to assist government agencies in investigating what is lacking and preparing for emergencies. In view of this, our association, in addition to compiling a reference list of Japanese medicines and sending it to members, and organizing crash courses in battlefield rescue, has decided at the 12th executive committee meeting of the 5th session on October 25 to print voluntary mobilization forms for enemy defense and self-defense and send them to members to fill out and send back to the association so that they can serve the country in the event of an unfortunate war. This matter concerns the national salvation movement, so please investigate and handle it accordingly." Attached is a voluntary mobilization survey form with sections for: (1) Name, (2) Gender, (3) Age, (4) Fixed Correspondence Address, (5) Physical Defects, (6) Specialization, (7) Current Position, (8) (A) Willing to go to the front line for rescue work, (B) Willing to serve in military hospitals and Red Cross hospitals, (C) Willing to undertake social rescue work in the rear, (9) In addition to specialized skills, what kind of work are you willing to undertake during the war?</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchant Trams Resume This Morning</h3>
<p>Treatment Conditions Completely Resolved</p>
<p>Wu Quesheng Agrees to Resign Voluntarily</p>
<p>All Company Employees Return to Work</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchant Electrical Company in this city experienced a strike by all employees, resulting in tram service without ticket sales. After the City Party Department intervened to mediate, a concrete solution was reached. However, it was not approved by the employees' meeting. Yesterday, the Party and government agencies mediated again and decided to follow the instructions. The employees' meeting approved it, considering it satisfactory. They all returned to work at 4:30 PM last night, and tram service has fully resumed this morning. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Process: Wu Kaixian, Standing Committee Member of the City Party Department, and Xu Yefu, Head of the Civil Training Section, convened representatives of all employees and representatives of the company the day before yesterday. As a result of the mediation, a solution was reached based on the impartial decision of the Social Affairs Bureau, as follows: Employee salary increase plan (1) Those above 90 yuan will receive an increase of 10%. (2) Those between 50 yuan and 90 yuan will receive an increase of 25%. (3) Those between 36 yuan and 50 yuan will receive an increase of 10%. (4) Those between 12 yuan and 25 yuan will receive an increase of 40%. (5) Those below 21 yuan will receive an increase of 55%. (6) Trainees will be increased proportionally. They also persuaded them to return to work immediately. Later, the employees' meeting discussed that the purpose of the strike, to expel Wu Quesheng, head of the General Affairs Section, had not been achieved, and the meeting adjourned without a result.</p>
<p>Traffic Situation: The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union (i.e., the Chinese Merchant Workers' Organization) and employee representatives held a joint meeting the night before last to discuss measures. Yesterday morning, the union sent all directors and supervisors, Tang Junsheng, Zhou Guangrong, etc., to the company to try to maintain the tram departure. A total of nine trams on Route 1, four trams on Route 2, eight trams on Route 3, and six trams on Route 4. However, because employees continued to strike, ticket sales were suspended. Therefore, the previous day's method of tram service without ticket sales was still followed.</p>
<p>Solution: Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Wu Kaixian, Standing Committee Member of the City Party Department, convened representatives of all employees and representatives of the company again at the City Party Department yesterday morning to mediate again. As a result, both parties agreed and decided on the following: (1) Wu Quesheng, Head of the General Affairs Section of the Chinese Merchant Electrical Company, will resign voluntarily. (2) Employee treatment conditions: (A) Those above 90 yuan will receive an increase of 10%. (B) Those between 50 yuan and 90 yuan will receive an increase of 25%. (C) The City Government's instruction to cancel the 30% increase for those between 26 yuan and 50 yuan will be revoked and changed to a 40% increase for those between 21 yuan and 50 yuan. (D) Those below 21 yuan will receive an increase of 55%. (E) Trainees will be increased according to this example, effective from October 20. (3) Ding Ren will be responsible for fulfilling the treatment conditions. At that time, employee representatives stated that the above decisions must be approved by the employees' meeting.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Instructions: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received instructions from the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of the Chinese Merchant Electrical Employees' treatment conditions and salary increase plan, the 30% increase for those above 36 yuan is canceled, and they are instructed to resume work as usual." The bureau instructed all employee representatives, Deng Shuping, etc., stating: "To comply with the matter, it was found that the employees jointly requested to improve their treatment. After the bureau decided to instruct them to comply, it was reported that the employees expressed dissatisfaction and suddenly went on strike. We have submitted a report to the Municipal Government for review and adjudication. Now, we have received Instruction No. 12464 from the Municipal Government, reviewing the handling method, etc. Therefore, we are enclosing a copy of the original instruction and sending personnel from the City Party Department to persuade the employees to go to the company to resume work immediately. Please comply strictly." It also instructed the Chinese Merchant Electrical Company, with similar content as above.</p>
<p>Employees' Meeting: At 2 PM yesterday, all employees held an employees' meeting at the Lianyi Society on Guohuo Road. Chairman Shen Yuping, Xu Yefu from the City Party Department, Zhang Shouchun, a clerk from the Public Security Bureau, and Guo Yongxi, a clerk from the Social Affairs Bureau, attended to provide guidance. The chairman first reported on the process, followed by reports from representatives of the Party and government agencies on the mediated solution, and then began discussions after persuading them to return to work.

<p>Full Resumption of Work: All employees of the Chinese Merchant Electrical Company's lighting, transportation, general affairs, clerical affairs, materials, technology, engineering, accounting, and document sections resumed work at the company at 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon after the meeting. However, due to time constraints, tram service on each route did not have time to issue tickets and will remain temporarily without ticket sales. All tram services on each route will resume issuing tickets tomorrow.</p>
<p>Workers' Meeting: All workers of the Chinese Merchant Electrical Company held a representative meeting at the union on Guohuo Road at 9 PM yesterday to discuss measures. All directors and supervisors explained everything and persuaded them to work with peace of mind. It was heard that the company has not yet fulfilled some of the worker treatment conditions that have been signed by both labor and management, such as the 3,000 yuan out of the 5,000 yuan case that the company has not yet issued. Although the company has agreed, it insists that the union send a letter stating.</p>
<h3>Addressing the Coal Shortage Problem</h3>
<p>Telegraphing the Jiaoji Railway to Retain Price Increases</p>
<p>Telegrams from Commercial Organizations: Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Shipping Association, Chinese Cotton Mill Owners' Association, Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association, Chinese Seamen's Union Reorganization Committee, Shanghai Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association, Shanghai Oil Mill Industry Association, Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Industry Association, Chinese Marine Engineers' Federation, Chinese Merchant Marine Officers' Association, etc., sent a telegram to the Boshan Mining Industry Association yesterday, stating: "To the Boshan Mining Industry Association, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau plans to increase prices starting tomorrow. Your association has resolved to strike and make a final appeal. Upon hearing this news, our associations are extremely anxious. Shanghai's coal reserves are less than a month. If Lu coal stops, it will open the door for foreign coal to invade and hinder the development of domestic coal, endangering social tranquility and the people's economy. We have now jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shandong Chairman Han to instruct the Jiaoji Railway to temporarily retain the price increase plan and for the central government to convene representatives from various railways and mine owners to conduct a detailed discussion, so that the freight rates of each railway are equally treated, ensuring that the state benefits, the mine owners bear the burden, and both parties can take care of their own interests. In addition to sending separate telegrams, please do not strike before receiving the government's written order to avoid a coal shortage. This is of utmost importance." (Telegrams to the Beijing-Shandong authorities were reported in yesterday's newspaper.)</p>
<p>Telegram from the National Coal Production and Sales Association: "To the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways, we respectfully acknowledge the telegram from the Ministry of Railways yesterday. We have forwarded it to the Shandong Zibo Propaganda Coal Mine Association. We have now received a reply stating: 'The Jiaoji Railway's freight rates are the highest compared to other state-owned railways. For example, the Jinpu Railway charges 5 li per ton-mile to Zhongxing, the Ruoning Railway charges 6 li to Beipiao, and the Pinghan Railway charges 6.825 li to Liuhegou, regardless of exports or domestic. The Jiaolu Railway originally charged 7.3 li for exports, and after the increase, it will be more than 8.1 li. The domestic rate is 1.6 li, averaging more than 1.2 li, which is already more than double that of other railways. The Ministry of Railways' telegram stated that the railway's freight rates are the lowest, which is completely untrue. Coal merchants have repeatedly requested a reduction, but have not been granted it. Previously, in June of this year, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry, approving the Ministry of Railways' statement that it had ordered the railway to negotiate fair measures with various coal merchant associations. The coal merchants have repeatedly requested consultations but have not been fulfilled. Now, the price increase is being made unilaterally, which cannot be trusted by the coal merchants. As for the 20% summer rebate, the railway bureau's announcement only stated that the 20% rebate would be implemented, but it was still collected at the original price of 2 yuan and 5 jiao and 2 fen per ton. If calculated according to the 20% rebate method, it should only collect 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and several fen per ton. Now it is still collected at the original price. In fact, the railway bureau has clearly admitted to canceling the price increase, so coal merchants can only comply with the orders of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Railways and negotiate a fair freight rate with the railway. The Ministry of Railways already knows that the cost of coal mines on the Jiaolu Railway is higher, so state-owned railways should primarily develop industries and should reduce freight rates to show extra preferential treatment. Why do you want to increase prices above the already high freight rates of other railways? Coal merchants are struggling to maintain their business and livelihood. How dare they make things difficult for the railway bureau on purpose? We hereby telegram your government and ministries again, earnestly requesting that you promptly order the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to cancel the price increase to maintain the lack of fuel and benefit the resistance work. Thank you.'" Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Chinese National Coal Production and Sales Association, and Standing Committee Members Fang Jiaobo, Hong Gubin, Sheng Pihua, and Liu Yumen respectfully bow. (Seal)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Replied Yesterday: "To the Shanghai Chinese National Coal Production and Sales Association, we have received your telegram. In May of this year, the coal merchants of Shandong Zibo and Weifang counties suspended operations due to the Jiaoji Railway's cancellation of the summer rebate. After repeated consultations between our ministry and the Ministry of Railways, we approved the reduction according to the existing summer price reduction method, limited to four months. During this period, both parties should negotiate fair freight rates. Later, due to summer rain disasters and excessive coal costs, we approved the Ministry of Railways' extension of the aforementioned period to the end of October. As the deadline approaches, we are scheduled to transfer the price. On the day of the month, the Shanghai Coal Industry Association telegraphed that the Jiaoji Railway Bureau announced that the coal price</p>
<p>would be increased. The domestic price will be increased by 20%, and the export price will be set at 2 yuan and 8 jiao, effective from November of this year. This move is tantamount to suicide. We telegraphed to order the cancellation of the agreement and to re-negotiate a special price, etc. We have also consulted the Ministry of Railways for verification and handling. We are now reporting to you that the allegations made in the telegram are true. At this time, when we are promoting domestic products, we should eliminate obstacles and vigorously maintain them to promote development. The coal reserves of each ministry are now low and urgently need to be supplemented by domestic coal. Increasing freight rates at this time seems inappropriate. The allegations made in the association's telegram are mostly true. Can you immediately telegraph the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to withdraw the order? Please preside over the handling of this matter. Please be informed."</p>

<h3>News of Disaster Relief for Victims</h3>
<p>Italy Agrees to Allocate Boxer Indemnity Funds for Disaster Relief: Chairman Song of the National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee announced that a contract has been signed with the Italian government to allocate US$200,000 from the Italian Boxer Indemnity funds for the purchase of disaster relief equipment and other materials. These equipment and materials will be purchased from Italy by the managers of the China-Italy Bank and the Italian Bank. The procurement contract will be negotiated and finalized by representatives appointed by the National Government and the Italian representatives. This allocation of Boxer Indemnity funds is considered a special measure of a charitable nature for disaster relief and should not be taken as a precedent for future allocations. Chairman Song expressed great satisfaction with the Italian government's concern for the disaster situation and its ready agreement to the National Government's proposal to use Boxer Indemnity funds for relief efforts. He also expressed deep appreciation for the efforts of the Italian Chargé d'Affaires in China, Count Ciano, in completing this matter. The Chinese side has appointed Mr. Wang Jingchun, who is currently handling matters related to the British Boxer Indemnity in London, as its representative to liaise with the Italian representative, Mr. Shexi, regarding the required equipment and materials. It is reported that inquiries have already been made to Italy to facilitate consideration and procurement.</p>
<p>Champagne Winner Donates 50,000 Yuan: The Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Emergency Relief for Water Disasters in Various Provinces received the following donations yesterday: (1) Mr. Tang Baoshu, the first prize winner of the recent charity champagne draw, wrote to Mr. Xu Jingren, the standing committee member of the committee, stating that the winning ticket for the grand champagne draw was handled by Mr. Xu Wenliang, with the prize being equally divided among Xu Wenji, Huang Changji, Tang Guoji, Huang Yingji (Ms.), and Jisheng Hall, totaling five shares. Mr. Xu, with his charitable heart, requested that each of the five parties donate 10,000 yuan, totaling 50,000 yuan, for disaster relief. Enclosed with the letter was 50,000 yuan, hoping that the committee would accept it and distribute it to the affected areas, ensuring that the disaster victims receive tangible benefits, and not disappointing Mr. Xu's enthusiasm for relief. (2) Lawyer Yao Da donated 100 yuan himself and raised 230 yuan, totaling 330 yuan. (3) The Shanghai Bar Association continued to submit 230 yuan and two donation registers. (4) A telegram from Funing County (29th) stated that the county had established 18 porridge kitchens, with a large number of disaster victims, and had received 5,000 bags of flour, which had not yet arrived, leaving the victims in dire need of food. (5) A letter from Mr. Ye Yizhou stated: "Greetings to the standing committee members. During the peak of fundraising for the recent water disaster, the Northeast Incident suddenly occurred, shifting the nation's attention. Coupled with the extremely tight monetary situation, the committee's income plummeted, which is deeply regrettable. Many provinces are currently distributing relief, but due to the widespread disaster and limited funds, they are requesting additional allocations. Relief efforts in the disaster areas cannot be stopped. Furthermore, the commissioners of relief from various provinces are requesting to take over winter relief, work relief, and agricultural relief. The telegrams are flying in like snowflakes, and the reports are too tragic to bear. The floodwaters are gradually receding in various places, but the disaster victims, who fled for their lives during the floods, have been separated from their families. To this day, they do not know the whereabouts of their parents, siblings, wives, and children, and their reunion is uncertain. Even if they return home, their houses are gone, and the ruined wells and desolate walls present a scene of desolation. Moreover, they have no seeds left and are still exposed to the elements without clothing or shelter. They are at risk of freezing to death as the north wind howls and chills their bones, causing tears to fall. I, Yizhou, have no other hobbies in my life except smoking cigarettes. Deeply moved by the sight of the disaster, I am now saving my cigarette money for ten days, totaling three yuan, and submitting it to the committee to be distributed to the disaster areas. I know that this is just a drop in the bucket, but Shanghai is the largest commercial port in the country, with a population of no less than three million people. The city is extremely prosperous, with wealthy merchants, foreign firms, and prominent overseas Chinese. It is as if they are in heaven looking down on the disaster areas, which are like hell. I hope that the elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots of this city will all have a kind heart and make a great wish to contribute their luxury goods or non-essential expenses for this winter, such as entertainment, gambling, food, pursuit, singing and dancing halls, movies, ballparks, and cosmetics for famous ladies and stars, each person reducing their entertainment once or buying two fewer items. The cost is not much, and the pain is limited. I propose that all citizens of the city make two wishes: to donate to this committee once within the next month, averaging three yuan per person. With a population of two million people in the city, this would generate an income of six million yuan, which can be used for winter relief, setting up porridge kitchens and warming centers, and providing cotton clothing and bedding. Small contributions make a large sum, and grains of sand build a tower. This is my humble wish." The Shanghai Anhui Water Disaster Relief Association, regarding the closure of the Shanghai Municipal Disaster Victim Reception Center, considers this matter to be of great importance and has sent separate letters to the National Government Relief Committee, the Fundraising Committee for Emergency Relief in Various Provinces, the Relief Committee, the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, the Jisheng Association, and the Zhabei Charity Group, stating: "We are writing to you regarding the news reported recently that the Shanghai Municipal Disaster Victim Reception Center has been ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to close at the end of November. We have also received a letter from the center stating that it has now stopped receiving disaster victims and that no more victims should be sent to the center. The disaster situation in the Jianghuai region is the most severe. The number of victims who have been submerged is countless, and those who have survived until now due to incomplete relief efforts continue to suffer. As the floodwaters gradually recede and transportation becomes more convenient, the number of people fleeing to Shanghai for their lives has actually doubled compared to before. They are supporting the old and carrying the young, appearing emaciated and haggard, wandering the streets and markets, unable to find help. Having been displaced for a long time, they will eventually starve and freeze to death. According to the reports from the six staff members stationed at the reception center by our association, including Mr. Zhu Runbin, every night, dozens or hundreds of disaster victims fleeing from the Yangtze River coast, such as Wuwei and other areas, as well as Jiangbei and Huaibei, arrive at the center, appealing for help at the door. However, they are refused admission and are forced to be dispersed by the police, leaving them exposed to the elements and their cries unanswered. Upon receiving this information, our association immediately dispatched Mr. E Runzhi by car late at night on the 25th of this month to negotiate repeatedly and strongly urge the center to take them in and provide them with porridge, which finally allowed them to settle down. However, they had no blankets to sleep on and were shivering with cold. Moreover, the Second Reception Center still has 40 to 50 empty rooms, and the 450 shi of rice donated by the Jiangbei rickshaw pullers' union is temporarily not lacking. Messrs. Zhu and E reported to Mr. Wang Yiting, Mr. Qu Wenliu, Mr. Wang Binyan, and other gentlemen at the Renji Hall and the Zhabei Charity Group, who all disapproved of the situation. The Jiangsu Charity Association immediately allocated 5,000 yuan, and other charitable groups continued to provide assistance, so there is no need to worry about food. However, the director of the center is strictly following orders and not completing the task of doing good, which is truly incomprehensible. Receiving disaster victims is essential for disaster relief. The center has already received more than 6,000 people, and more than 2,000 people have been sent away. There are also many people who have left the center voluntarily. Now, new people are arriving in Shanghai from various places, all seeking a way to make a living. Since a large number of them have already arrived, they should all be taken in. If the government is facing difficulties, it should consult with various charitable groups to discuss solutions. How can they be refused admission? If there is no proper resettlement, the hunger and cold of the disaster victims will affect local public order, and it would be unbearable for us to let them be left to die after seeking refuge. Therefore, we have sent Messrs. Zhu and E to your association with this letter to request a consultation on the proper way to receive and resettle the victims, saving lives and providing thorough relief, which would be a great act of merit. The Shanghai Anhui Water Disaster Relief Association."</p>
<p>Clothing Association Distributes a Large Batch of Relief Clothing: The Clothing and Bedding Aid Association at 207 Ximengdelan Road, Racecourse, has received over 35,000 pieces of clothing and bedding and over 500 quilts from various sectors since its establishment. In addition to the 19,500 pieces of clothing and 190 quilts that have been sent to various disaster relief associations, yesterday, Mr. Huang Chunzhou, the director of the association, delivered 14,000 pieces of new and used single-layer and cotton-padded clothing and trousers and 300 quilts to the National Government Water Disaster Relief Committee, requesting them to be distributed to various disaster areas.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers Executed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Zhenshi Case: Zhu Xiangsheng</p>
<p>Deng Zhonghe Case: Weng Zisheng</p>
<p>Kidnapper Zhu Xiangsheng (also known as Zhu Amao), a native of Chuansha, 44 years old, colluded with accomplices on March 27th of this year to kidnap Dr. Wang Zhenshi from No. 2, Xinghe Lane, 411 Jing'an Temple Road, and hide him at No. 264, Xieping Lane, Beile Road. Later, Wang was redeemed with a huge sum of money. Subsequently, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and Detective Wang Chengying of the General Inspectorate arrested Zhu and sent him to the First Special Court, which sentenced him to death. The sentence was approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government for execution. Kidnapper Weng Zisheng (also known as Weng Azhi), a native of Ningbo, 33 years old, kidnapped Deng Zhonghe, the owner of the Daqing Cotton Cloth Store, on Ningbo Road on April 3rd of the previous year and took him to Pudong. Later, Chief Detective Wang Changgen and Su Changsheng arrested Weng and sent him to the former Provisional Court, which, after investigation, sentenced him to death. The sentence was approved by the Provincial Government for execution. Yesterday afternoon was the execution date. The police escorted the two criminals, Zhu and Weng, to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court. Judge Cheng Shangfeng took the bench and asked the two criminals if they had any last words. Zhu stated, "Please send a letter to Xu Xiechang South Goods Store at the entrance of Caojia Road, Pudong, to be forwarded to my father, Wei Zhaoying, telling him that I died of illness so that he will not be too sad. If he has money, he can come to collect my body. If he doesn't have money, he can forget about it. Also, there were three yuan that were confiscated. Please ask the police to buy long ingots to burn for me so that I can use them in the underworld." Weng stated, "Please write a letter to my mother at No. 1, Jiaotong Lane, Qiujiang Road, telling her not to be sad. At that time, I was defrauded of more than 1,000 yuan by Yang Jitang while working at the Nisshin Company. Please ask my mother to go and get it back. Also, when I was arrested, many of my clothes and other items were confiscated. When I was in the Western Prison, I asked the head of the prison, who said that the police had not sent them. Please investigate." Judge Cheng Shangfeng then inquired with lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police, who agreed to investigate with the police and report back. Judge Cheng then ordered the two criminals to be taken down. The guards put them in a car and drove to the Caohejing execution ground. Officials from the Local Court were dispatched to supervise the execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Zhu Chengzhang Case: Kidnappers Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Yuan Awei and Zhang Shiming Both Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Chen Xing Acquitted and Released Immediately</p>
<p>Chief Detective Wang Changgen of the General Inspectorate of the General Patrol Room and Chief Detective (surname missing) of the Zhabei Patrol Room previously arrested three kidnappers: Yuan Awei (also known as Awei De Yuan Xiaomao), a native of Ningbo; Zhang Shiming (also known as Zhang Jinsheng Xiaojinsheng), a native of Suzhou; and Chen Xing, a native of Changzhou. It was found that Yuan and others kidnapped Zhu Chengzhang, the president of the National Goods Bank, at 9:00 AM on December 23rd of last year, and shot and killed Zhu, wounding Zhu's daughter Chengxiu and the nurse Deng Changcai. They also shot and killed Heersi, No. 247 of the Third Team of the Zhabei Patrol Room, and the Chinese assistant A'er near the New Company at 12:40 AM on March 4th of the previous year. They also kidnapped Lou Kenzai, the son of Lou Xunru, the president of the Quangong Bank, on Wenzhi Road at 9:00 AM on November 4th of the previous year. They also robbed 46,000 yuan of silver from the Four Banks' reserve warehouse in a small alley on Guangdong Road and Fuzhou Road at 2:15 PM on March 13th of last year. Lawyer Ru Baoyi, representing the patrol room, prosecuted them in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Punishing Kidnapping Law and the crimes of robbery and murder under the Criminal Law. After several summons and interrogations, the case was concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Han, the chief of the Criminal Court, took the bench in the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict stated that Yuan Awei was sentenced to life imprisonment for two counts of joint murder, Zhang Shiming was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for the crime of joint robbery with three or more people carrying weapons, and Yuan Awei and Chen Shiming were each sentenced to death for the crime of joint kidnapping for ransom, with the death penalty to be executed.

Upon hearing the verdict, lawyer Ru of the patrol room rose and declared that he would waive the appeal for Chen Xing's acquittal and requested that he be released immediately. The court granted the request.</p>
<h3>Tang Wenfu Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Tang is the Deputy Accountant of Guangxing Store</p>
<p>The Owner of the Store, Mr. Chen, Was Also Kidnapped</p>
<p>Tang Wenfu, a Cantonese man and the deputy accountant of Guangxing Store, which specializes in warehousing, located at No. 180, Xingye Lane, Miller Road, Hongkou, 22 years old, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits at around 8:45 AM yesterday morning. He was taken away in a car with the license plate number 6141. The Hongkou Patrol Room immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate the matter. It was reported that Tang Wenfu was traveling in his own chartered car to Xiangmao Store on the Bund to discuss business when he was suddenly met by a kidnapper's car about 40 yards away from the Hanbi Luli Bridge on Xizang Road. Three bandits, one of whom was holding a pistol, dragged Tang from the chartered car and put him in their car, which sped away. After learning of the incident, the patrol room immediately launched an investigation and discovered that the license plate number 6141 was fake. It was also reported that Mr. Chen, the owner of Guangxing Store, was kidnapped in the Morrison area this spring. After escaping, he went to Hong Kong, and his son is also not currently in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Where Did the Two Boys Come From?</h3>
<p>Hidden in a Quilt, Suspicious Doubts</p>
<p>Claiming Mr. Lin is Just an Excuse</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM yesterday, Chen Songshan and Li Fengqi, officers of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, were patrolling the river near the Ning-Shao Wharf at the Sixteenth Pier when they saw that the Ningxing steamboat was still moored. They immediately went aboard to inspect it. They found a woman in the cabin forcing a boy dressed in a Zhongshan suit to sleep under a quilt. The boy was crying and refused, sticking his head out from under the quilt. The woman forced him back under the quilt, but the boy still refused, sticking his head out. The officers found this very strange and immediately interrogated her about her background and asked who the boy under the quilt was. The woman said that the boy was her son. When they asked her what the boy's name was, the woman could not answer. At that moment, the officers noticed that something seemed to be bulging inside the quilt and moving. They became even more suspicious and immediately lifted the quilt, revealing another lively and lovely boy dressed in a cotton robe curled up on the bed. They questioned the woman again, asking what her relationship was with the boy. The woman claimed that he was her grandson. The officers observed that the two boys were both around three years old and did not resemble the woman. They suspected that they were not her children or grandchildren and that their backgrounds were unknown. They took the woman and the two boys to the team. During the preliminary interrogation by Director Xu, after questioning the woman repeatedly, she confessed that she was Ge Xu, 46 years old, from Suzhou, living on Hulong Street in Suzhou. The boy in the cotton robe, named Jin-er, was three years old this year. He was given to her by a Mr. Lin she knew at a hotel at the Zhangmenkou in Suzhou and asked to take him to Shanghai to transfer to a boat to Fujian. Mr. Lin promised to give her a reward of ten yuan. The boy in the Zhongshan suit was given to her by Mr. Lin in Shanghai, so she did not know his name. She said that she was confused for a moment and greedy for the small profit, so she did not ask Mr. Lin about the background of the two boys. She then began to weep, regretting what she had done. The officers observed that the clothes worn by the two boys were newly made and that they were innocent and naive. They suspected that they had been abducted by bandits, disguised, and trafficked to Fujian to be sold. They ordered a document to be prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Electricity Company's New Office Building</h3>
<p>Moving in for Office Work on the Second of Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company announced that it will be relocating all offices from the old site in the Public Works Department building to its newly built building at 95 Nanjing Road, near the corner of Jiangxi Road, on Monday, November 2nd. The new building began construction in 1930, but due to various delays in the construction project, it was unable to move in as scheduled. However, most of it is now ready, so it will be moved in immediately. The company hopes that customers will understand any inconvenience caused by this. All offices will be moved to the new location. As for the sample rooms in the Sassoon House, it will have to wait until the middle of next month, so the service to the public at that location will remain the same. The purpose of each floor of the new building is as follows: The first floor is for sample rooms and will be reported in detail later. All departments that were previously in the Sassoon House sample rooms and collection office and are related to the public will also be concentrated here to avoid inconvenience for customers. The second floor is dedicated to the customer accounting room and the company's preferred stock office, which is fully equipped for transactions with the public. The third floor is for the accounting room and material room. The fourth floor is for the power feed engineer's office. The fifth floor is for the deputy manager, chief engineer, secretary, and customer engineer's office. The motor rental department, archives, and communications room are also located on this floor. The sixth floor is for the president's office, vice president and general manager's office, board room, meeting room, and future expansion areas for various departments. Transportation between floors is facilitated by two new-style elevators that have never been seen in Shanghai. As for the company's telephone number, it will be changed to 11010 from the date of moving into the new building, which is easy to remember. The postal address will remain the old mailbox number 404.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Rice Prices Falling</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the arrival of new grains and the abundant supply, the rice prices in this port have fallen. In the Zhabei area, more than 40 rice boats arrived yesterday, and the market sales were sluggish. Therefore, the prices of various types of rice were more than three yuan lower per shi than the original limited price of seventeen yuan.

According to people in the rice industry, if the weather clears up, there will be more goods coming in from various places in the future, and the prices will have to fall again.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of a Small Boat Colliding with a Rowboat</h3>
<p>Seven People Drowned Together</p>
<p>At 6:15 PM the night before last, eight passengers boarded rowboat No. 150 from the Zhaofeng Road Wharf in Hongkou to cross to Pudong. When they arrived near the Xiaonanyang Wharf in Pudong, a small boat belonging to the Asia Company arrived from the Xinguang Wharf. Because it was dark and both sides had lights on, they were careless in identifying the direction, causing the bow of the small boat to crash into the rowboat. The rowboat could not withstand the impact and was overturned. All eight passengers and the boatman Ding Xilong and his wife fell into the water. The small boat quickly tried to rescue them, but only two passengers and the boatman Ding Xilong were rescued. Six passengers and Ding's wife drowned and disappeared. Although Ding was rescued, his face, hands, and feet were injured, but not seriously. Afterwards, Yang Wanying, the captain of the small boat, and Ding reported the incident to the Yangshupu Water Patrol Room. The captain, based on the statements of both parties, each with their own reasons, ordered them to stay in the patrol room overnight. Yesterday afternoon, detectives Hu Changqing and Shen Changshan escorted the plaintiff and defendant to the local court for investigation. The bodies of Ding's wife and the six passengers who died have not yet been found. It is likely that the families of the deceased passengers have not yet received the news of the tragedy, so they have not reported it to the patrol room. The patrol room detectives are currently investigating and sending people to search for the bodies.</p>
<h3>Two Suicides</h3>

<p>Military Officer: A man resembling a junior military officer, claiming to be Huang Ju, checked into Room 15 of the Huarui Xing Hotel on North Zhejiang Road at around 11:00 PM the night before last. Yesterday morning, he was found dead in his room after committing suicide. He left behind a suicide note addressed to a female friend, stating that he was worried about national affairs and economic oppression, and therefore took this course of action.</p>
<h3>Another Accomplice in the Zhang Xilin Kidnapping Case Arrested</h3>
<p>After Zhang Xilin, the owner of the Lishengchang Silk Thread Store on Shandong Road, was kidnapped, the General Patrol Room dispatched all Chinese and foreign detectives to rescue him and arrest more than 20 kidnappers, who were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in detail in this newspaper. In this case, the kidnapper Miao Xingyuan suddenly confessed that after the kidnapping, he stayed overnight in Room 211 of the Far East Hotel and met two people named Liu and Chen. The day before yesterday, he led Chinese detectives Huang Fusen and Jiang Shangpei to the hotel and arrested a man named Liu and took him to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the patrol room stated the facts of the case, requesting permission to detain him for further investigation and to be tried together with Miao Xingyuan and others. Judge Zhou Han briefly interrogated Liu and ordered him to be detained and tried together in the case.</p>
<h3>Methods for Certifying National Products</h3>
<p>To be handled by the National Products Exhibition Hall</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Social Bureau's National Products Exhibition Hall was approved by the Municipal Government to handle the certification of national products, hundreds of manufacturers in the city have applied for certification. The hall has been dispatching personnel to various factories for detailed investigations, keeping them very busy. It is understood that, to facilitate the application procedures for manufacturers, an application form has been printed. Any applicant for registration and certification can obtain the form at the hall. It is also understood that the hall's standard methods for certifying national products are based entirely on the national product standards promulgated by the Ministry of Industry. Therefore, applicants for certification at the hall can have the hall forward their applications to the Ministry of Industry for the issuance of certificates. During this period of the boycott movement, the certification of national products is of great importance. A reporter from the Wuchen News Agency has specially obtained the certification regulations, the national product grade standards promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, and the products of various factories that have been certified by the hall, as follows:</p>
<p>Certification Methods: (1) Any manufacturer in the city who wishes to apply to this hall for certification that their products are indeed national products shall comply with these methods. (2) The applicant shall submit an application form, along with samples of the products for which certification is requested, together with drawings, specifications, and trademarks, three copies each, for review. (3) The application form shall specify the following items and be signed and sealed by the applicant or their agent: (1) Product name; (2) Trademark; (3) Producer; (4) Place of production; (5) Capital; (6) Factory or company name; (7) Raw materials; (8) Labor. (4) Each certificate is limited to one type of product. (5) Certification fees are temporarily waived; only a handling fee of two yuan per item is collected, to be submitted with the application. However, if the same manufacturer applies for certification for two or more products at the same time, the handling fee will only be charged once. (6) If, after on-site investigation by personnel from this hall, the products submitted for certification are found to meet the national product standards stipulated by the Ministry of Industry, a certificate will be issued according to the grade. (7) In case of any doubt, certification will be suspended, and the handling fee will not be refunded. However, if there are special reasons, the producer may apply for a re-examination. (8) All national products certified by this hall shall be entitled to the rights under various national product preferential treatment regulations in this city and may request to be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for the issuance of national product certificates promulgated by the Ministry. (9) If there are any matters not covered in these methods, they may be revised at any time and reported to the competent authorities for filing with the Municipal Government. (10) These methods shall be implemented from the date they are submitted to the Social Bureau and forwarded to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>

<h3>Workers at the Minzhi Bookstore Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Worker Jin Shifa Still Denied Re-employment</p>
<p>Municipal Government to Arbitrate Conditions for Zhonghua Today</p>
<p>Following the strike by all employees of the Zhonghua and Minzhi Bookstores in this city, Zhonghua first resumed work in compliance with the order. However, Li Hongbin was still passively denied re-employment and had no work to do. The Municipal Government is scheduled to arbitrate the terms of employment today. Minzhi also resumed work uniformly yesterday, but Jin Shifa was also denied re-employment. The details of each situation are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Minzhi Resumes Work: The Publishing Industry Labor Union, having received instructions from the Social Bureau to order all workers at Minzhi to resume work as usual, held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 5:00 PM the night before. In order to comply with the order, it was decided to resume work with forbearance. Yesterday morning, Gu Rongsheng, Wang Bin, and others accompanied worker Jin Shifa to the factory to resume work and persuaded the workers to work as usual. Thus, at about 9:00 AM, the strike was stopped and work resumed as usual. However, Associate Manager Qiu Shaoqi stated that the issue of Jin Shifa's re-employment would have to wait until the board of directors meeting at 11:00 AM today for a decision, and a response would be given around 3:00 PM. When the time came, he used the excuse that the board of directors had decided to deny re-employment. All the workers were very indignant upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Li Hongbin Has No Work: After all the employees of the Zhonghua Bookstore's main factory and distribution office resumed work in compliance with the order, worker Li Hongbin went to resume work. However, the employer passively refused, ordering the foreman of the lead printing department not to give him work. Therefore, although the worker had reported for work, in fact, it was the same as not having resumed work. All the employees believed that the employer's oppression was too much and were prepared to take further action to prompt the employer to realize their mistake. Fortunately, the Publishing Industry Labor Union strongly advised them to postpone the action and wait for instructions from the Social Bureau before making a decision.</p>
<p>Municipal Government to Arbitrate Today: The Municipal Government Labor-Management Arbitration Committee is scheduled to arbitrate the Zhonghua Bookstore employees' terms of employment at 1:00 PM this afternoon. The Publishing Industry Labor Union has designated Yang Youren and Wang Wenhua as representatives to attend the arbitration meeting.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Pilotage Examination</h3>
<p>Foreigners Attempt to Protract Control</p>
<p>Organizing an Examination Committee</p>
<p>Our country's recovery of pilotage rights is in its preliminary stages, first by holding examinations and then establishing a management committee to gradually proceed. The Ministries of Finance, Communications, and Navy have drafted measures for the recovery of pilotage rights, which have been approved by the Executive Yuan. On one hand, preparations are being made for the examination, originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on October 1st, but later postponed by one month due to insufficient time. Now, with the date of the examination approaching, the Shanghai Pilots' Association, having learned that the examination regulations stipulated by the central government allow foreigners to take the same exam, and that the organized pilotage management committee will be mostly composed of foreigners, meaning that the power to select pilots in the future will still be controlled by foreigners, which is far from the goal of recovering pilotage rights, submitted a report to the Ministry of Navy on the 12th of last month expressing their opposition. Now, they have submitted another report to the Examination Yuan, detailing the foreigners' conspiracy to control pilotage. The details of this matter are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Report to the Examination Yuan: The Shanghai Merchant Marine Masters Association's report to the Examination Yuan states, "Upon investigation, the foreigners' conspiracy to seize pilotage is entirely systematic, as can be seen in the report submitted to the Ministries of Finance, Navy, and Communications on June 27th of this year. We hereby present a summary: The foreigners want to continue to control and prolong the life of the South Mouth Pilots' Association, so the president of the association lobbied powerful foreigners to exert some kind of influence, implicitly forcing our country, under certain circumstances, to recognize the necessity of the foreigners' continued existence, or at least as a kind of exchange, and to use certain situations to give foreign pilots a stronger guarantee under our country's laws. They also spread various rumors, trying to distort the truth and confuse the public, even going so far as to attack, as seen in publications like the "Shipping Weekly," which often contain fallacies such as "Chinese pilots, even if established, can only pilot Chinese ships; foreign ships are led by foreign pilots," and claims that "Chinese pilots cause foreign ships to hesitate, affecting tax revenue," disregarding our country's sovereign rights and the abilities of our citizens. However, clever words can only deceive for a time, and will not withstand the facts. For example, in July of this year, foreign pilots at South Mouth threatened to strike, and after seven days of stalemate, what percentage of tax revenue was actually affected? Does the Customs have accurate statistics, or are the speakers just making unfounded statements? The speakers and listeners all have their own intentions, which should be specially noted by those in the know. Currently, the number of Chinese people serving as pilots in the South Mouth section is indeed small, but it should be known that seventy years ago, whether in the South Mouth section or in various ports in China, the pioneering founders of pilotage were all Chinese. Only because Hart deceived the Qing court and presented the management rights to foreigners, did they gradually seize them through cunning and coercion. This is truly a painful history for our Chinese people. Looking at more recent events, in 1928, a Chinese man named Li Gaochang served as a pilot in the South Mouth section and achieved excellent results. Unfortunately, he resigned due to illness. Li was succeeded by Lin Guojie, whose performance was also very good, which caused the foreigners to be wary. They incited foreign shipping companies to oppose him, but because Lin's skills were excellent and there was no excuse to be found, the opposition scheme turned into various slanders, falsely accusing our pilots, hoping to prolong their control. Even more despicable, our association member Yang Ying, when serving in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, discovered that among the Western captains and crew members, some had no diplomas but pretended to have positions, and others had diplomas but were incompetent. He did his best to remove these people, and within six months, he employed more than 120 Chinese people. For four years, no accidents occurred. At the same time, the company's foreign employees, in November 1928, sank the "New Ji," in January 1929, sank the "New Hua," in July sank the "New Kangjiangqing," and in the upstream, rammed and sank the ferry "New Chang." The axle broke in 1928, and in March 1931, the "New Chang" sank. Each time an accident occurred, several to hundreds of Chinese people died, with no recourse. Chinese lives were as cheap as chickens. Today, competent Chinese crew members have no guarantee, and incompetent foreign crew members cannot be punished. Yet those foreigners still arrogantly claim that the level of Chinese pilots is immature. If their words are indeed true, how can they explain the superiority of the performance of Chinese crew members in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company? Alas, the foreigners' manipulation of us Chinese people did not begin today, nor is it limited to the matter of pilotage alone. It has been going on for a long time. It is a pity that the Chinese people lack the skills, perseverance, and courage to respect and love themselves, and have been so trained as to take self-deprecation as humility and timidity as prudence, allowing the foreigners' upside-down and insulting remarks to flourish, anesthetizing people's hearts and weakening national spirit. Looking at the world today, how many can resist foreign invasion with real strength? Why not encourage and strive for progress in this area? I fear that in ten years, it will not only be a matter of the gains and losses of pilotage. Our association exposed the foreigners' conspiracy to control pilotage four months ago, and now their plans are being realized step by step. We urge you to uphold the spirit of fearlessness, to understand the crux of the matter, to safeguard the dignity of the examination, to give real benefits to the Chinese people, not to be confused by the foreigners' frivolous words, and not to be swayed by foreign forces, so that sovereign rights can be recovered and aggression can be broken."</p>
<p>Organizing Committee: With the pilot examination approaching, Examination Yuan Chairman Bu Yuan Chong specifically sent a letter to the Ministry of Navy, detailing that pilotage examinations should be prepared in advance, and that the Ministries of Finance, Navy, and Communications should jointly form a committee to thoroughly investigate the qualifications and academic requirements of pilotage candidates, as well as the areas of service, etc., so that there will be a basis for decision-making at the time of the examination. The letter also stated that foreigners who are allowed to take the exam should be lenient in their past but strict in their future, so that pilotage rights can be recovered after the expiration of the time limit in March 1934.</p>
<h3>Small Workers Wounded by Japanese Sailors</h3>
<p>Seven People</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Japanese sailors landing armed at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, seizing confiscated Japanese red bricks, and wounding several small workers, details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Mayor Zhang of the Municipal Government paid great attention to the report. Yesterday, he ordered the Public Security Bureau to send a section chief to Pudong to investigate the injured small workers together with Section Chief Zhang of the Third District and the Pudong Inspection Office of the Anti-Japanese Association. The names of the seven people were found to be as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Jiang Bogen, 56 years old, from Changzhou, head and forehead stabbed with a bayonet; (2) Chen Zhiyuan, 39 years old, from Hubei; (3) Pan Hairu, 31 years old; (4) Li Qingshan, 36 years old, residing on Haixing Road; (5) Huang Mingzhao, 28 years old, residing in Ruixiang Lane; (6) Shen Ziwu, 50 years old, from Hubei, residing at No. 7 Tongfu Lane; (7) Huang Mingsheng, 35 years old, from Hubei, residing at No. 13 Xiexing Lane, Haixing Road. Of the above seven people, in addition to Jiang Bogen, whose injuries were more serious, the other six, including Chen Zhiyuan, were all beaten on their hands, feet, shoulders, and backs with rifle butts, causing broken skin, bruises, and swelling to varying degrees. Section Chief Zhang sent a letter to the Pudong Hospital for examination of the injuries and issuance of medical certificates to be reported to the bureau for review. He also sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association to give Jiang and others temporary living expenses of one yuan each to show compassion.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Active Again in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hoping the Anti-Japanese Association will Pay Attention Promptly</p>
<p>Last year's incidents of Japanese fishing boats invading and fishing in Shanghai waters caused a stir for years and aroused the attention of Chinese people. Since the Customs implemented the new tariff, imported fresh fish are subject to an import tax of four and a half yuan per picul, with the original intention of protecting the domestic fishing industry. Limited by the tariff, Japanese fishing boats could not import. Later, they used Chinese merchants as traitors to transship on ice-fresh boats outside Wusongkou and import them as domestic products. However, with the cooperation of various fisheries organizations, the Navy's Coastal Defense Office and the Ministry of Industry's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration dispatched ships to patrol outside Wusongkou, and the Shanghai Fisheries Guidance Station set up an office in Songkou to conduct inspections. Thus, the tricks of Japanese fishing boats were thwarted again. The Japanese, with their cunning plans, now transport the catches from Japanese fishing boats that invade and fish in our country's East China Sea and Yellow Sea to Dalian first, because Dalian Customs is still in the hands of the Japanese. Then, they transport them to Shanghai using Chinese ships, and no one can detect their fraud. As a result, Japanese fishing boats make huge profits, Chinese fish merchants make small profits, and the local Shanghai Chinese-owned fishing companies suffer losses. Because every time Japanese fish are imported from Dalian, the Shanghai fish market plummets, and Chinese fishing boats are greatly affected. Local fisheries organizations have reported that they are closely monitoring this matter. Please, Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, do not forget your own responsibility and investigate immediately, and notify the Shanghai Ice-Fresh Fish Industry Association to strictly order the fish shops at 16th Pier not to sell fish products imported from Dalian again. It is said that yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ship Yushun and others imported two or three hundred barrels of small yellow croakers, eels, sharks, etc., causing panic among Chinese fishing boats. Please, Anti-Japanese Association, stop this quickly.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Overseas Chinese Returning from Mexico</h3>
<p>Due to the second anti-Chinese incident in Mexico, overseas Chinese in South America and Mexico, as well as overseas Chinese in Panama and Cuba, were unable to stay in these places and had to abandon their businesses abroad and return home with grief. The second group of overseas Chinese who withdrew from Mexico and Panama totaled more than 570 people, all of whom have boarded the President Taft of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Shanghai. Yesterday, a telegram arrived in Shanghai stating that the group of overseas Chinese will arrive in Yokohama, Japan, today and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on November 3rd. Some will disembark in Shanghai, and others will take the original ship to Hong Kong to return to their ancestral homes in Fujian and Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Request to Rescue Distressed Overseas Chinese in Mexico</h3>
<p>Nanjing Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to the Gentlemen of the National Government: The overseas Chinese in Mexico have been devastated by the anti-Chinese party, bankrupted, and unemployed. Now they are being expelled back to China. Please find a way to rescue the distressed overseas Chinese in Mexico and compensate them for their losses. This urgent telegram expresses our boundless grief and earnest hope. Representing 97 distressed overseas Chinese in Mexico, Miao Juefei, Peng Molin, etc., bow in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>International Telegrams to be Reduced in Price Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>At Nine Jiao in Chinese Currency per Gold Franc</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Jin Lost After Japanese Occupied Northeast Radio Station</p>
<p>International telegrams at the International Radio Station have always been calculated in gold francs, with each franc worth nine jiao and five fen in Chinese currency. Recently, the International Telecommunications Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications that, due to the depreciation of gold, each franc should be converted to nine jiao in Chinese currency, a reduction of five fen from before. The International Bureau has relayed this order to the radio stations to comply. Starting tomorrow, anyone sending telegrams will be charged five fen less per franc. Furthermore, according to Lu Guixiang, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, speaking to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, since the Japanese army began invading the three northeastern provinces on the night of September 18th, the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin have fallen one after another, and the northeastern radio stations have been almost entirely occupied. Currently, only Harbin remains in the northeast. Therefore, from September 18th to today, the estimated loss of business for wireless telegraphs in the northeast will reach ten thousand jin. As for the loss of seized and destroyed equipment, the amount is even greater and almost incalculable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents to Deal with Chinese Anti-Japanese Movement</h3>
<p>Assembly on November 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Japanese residents in this city are scheduled to convene a general assembly at 2:00 PM on November 1st to discuss methods for dealing with the Chinese anti-Japanese movement. Japanese residents who have recently moved to Shanghai from various locations along the Yangtze River will also attend to report on the situation in their respective areas. A preparatory committee of 14 people has been appointed, and Japanese residents in Nanjing, Suzhou, and other places have been invited to send representatives to attend. According to the Shanghai Mainichi Shinbun, Municipal Councilman Fukushima has been tasked with investigating films related to the Manchurian Incident being shown in local cinemas.</p>
<h3>German New Envoy Todtmann to Visit Capital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that Dr. Todtmann, the newly appointed German envoy to China, arrived in Shanghai from the capital on Monday. After a short stay of several days, he is scheduled to return to the capital by night express train tonight (30th). Afterwards, he will proceed directly to the German legation in Beijing. The German Consul-General in this city, Baron Collenberg, will host a banquet at noon today, inviting Chinese and foreign officials and gentry to accompany him.</p>
<h3>Two Organizations to Hold Certification of National Products</h3>
<p>Machine Joint Association Replies to Baoxing Factory Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine Joint Association replied to the Baoxing Factory's letter requesting instructions on how to hold certification of national products, "Regarding your respectful letter, we have already heard everything in the newspapers yesterday. Now we have received your letter, which states (the original letter can be found in the local news column of the Shen Bao on October 25th, omitted), etc. Upon investigation, this association has obtained permission from the government to organize a group of machine-made national product factories. It has been established for five years. We have done our best to develop and protect the interests of the association and its members. Although our capabilities are weak and we cannot fully satisfy the hopes of the association's workers and factories, we have done our best within our power. This time, with the outbreak of the Wanxian Incident and the occupation of the Northeast, all those with blood and energy are determined to cut off the enemy, either through boycotting or seeking alternative methods. The whole country is united and of one mind. In order to ensure the convenience of transportation for its members, this association first organized a national product certification advertisement, which was published in the Shen Bao and the Xin Bao for the first time on August 7th. Reduced-size leaflets were shipped with the goods. This was originally permitted by the government and allowed by law. If misunderstandings occur in various places, this association, as an organization of machine-made national products, will not stand idly by. If there are concerns in your letter, or even deliberate difficulties, and various destructions of national products, this is a public enemy of the factory and a reef of national products. Even if it is mistakenly detained for a time, it will certainly be clarified on another day. We are deeply grateful for your factory's care for this association. We are responding to the reasons stated in your letter. We hope you will take this into consideration." Addressed to Baoxing Mineral Powder Factory.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Board Meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council released the minutes of the board meeting held on the 28th, discussing various cases: (1) New building for the General Inspectorate, after the directors reviewed the engineering quarterly meeting minutes and discussed them, it was decided to build it on the west half of the vacant land at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, along the north side of Fuzhou Road, and to sell the remaining land, and to allocate a strip of open space on the west side to the American Club to purchase. In addition, it was also agreed in principle that if a new city hall is to be built in the future, it will be built on the existing site of the Municipal Council, without seeking another location. (2) The French Municipal Council notified that it intends to increase the bicycle registration fee from three yuan to four yuan starting next year, and asked if the Municipal Council is prepared to take consistent action. After discussion, it was considered that the purpose of bicycle registration was to facilitate police management and not for tax revenue. It was increased once last year, and if it is increased again next year, some people may find it difficult. Therefore, it was decided to notify the French Municipal Council that it has no intention to increase the fee. (3) Health Commissioner Dr. Marsh resigned, and Dr. Murray was appointed as his successor. (4) Due to overcrowding on public buses, it was decided that the Transportation and Public Utilities Committees would hold a joint meeting to discuss remedies. (5) Director Bland will leave Shanghai on November 10th and requested to resign immediately. The Director-General, on behalf of the entire board, expressed his regrets to Bland and wished him well in the future. (6) Someone contacted the bureau to ask if it would be willing to buy the Jiangbin Kaufman General Association property and open it as a park. It was considered that the land is located outside the concession and must be considered in cooperation with the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Regulations for the Management of Proprietary Medicines</h3>
<p>Effective from October 26th</p>
<p>The regulations for the management of proprietary medicines, regarding the provision for a time limit to apply for verification, have been extended by the former Ministry of Health on October 1, 1930, and by the Ministry of Interior on June 4 of this year, for six months each, until October 26 of this year. It has now expired.

<h3>Report on Children's Cases by the Child Welfare Association</h3>
<p>Total of 1,645 Cases in the Nineteenth Year</p>
<p>1,007 Cases Already Reached in the First Six Months of This Year</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association, in order to thoroughly seek child protection and reduce social evils, specially collects information on child cases from newspapers, whether factual or rumored. This is done to accumulate daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual quantities, to investigate and compare the causes and effects based on temporality, locality, economic relations, customs relations, status, and gender, and to analyze and summarize them to create statistics and charts. Last year, from the beginning of January to the end of December, there were a total of 1,645 cases, averaging about 137 cases per month and slightly less than five cases per day. Lost children accounted for more than one-third, abducted children for more than one-tenth, kidnapped children for more than six percent, and children run over by vehicles, girls raped, and abandoned children each accounted for about four percent. There were even three cases of children being buried alive, two of children being boiled, and six of boys being sodomized. The association's statistics for the twentieth year, covering the six months from January to the end of June, have already reached 1,007 cases, an increase of slightly less than 200 cases compared to the same period last year. Lost children totaled 459, and abducted children totaled 156, both figures being similar to the total numbers for each category last year. Other cases included seven cases of abused maids, sixteen cases of apprentices suffering harm, eighteen cases of kidnapped children, three cases of women selling fetuses, thirty-four cases of girls being raped, two cases of child marriages, forty-two cases of children run over by vehicles, two cases of disputes over children, four cases of child suicides, four cases of abused adopted daughters-in-law, five cases of children forced into prostitution, one hundred and eleven cases of children being drowned, four cases of abandoned infant corpses, nine cases of child criminals, two cases of pregnant women being hit, two cases of children buried alive, twenty-eight cases of children burned to death, seven cases of abandoned children, four cases of boys being sodomized, twenty-six cases of children crushed to death by collapsing houses, three cases of parents killing their children, and fifty-nine cases of unclassified incidents. Although the association feels that it has exhausted all sources in collecting information and has strived for accuracy in its statistics, the number of cases that are actually lost, unheard of, concealed, or hidden is far more than this. However, the association's purpose is not in the quantity, but in the classification; not in the facts, but in the research; and not in the records, but in the publicity.</p>

<p>Reader's Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from Fuliang Lin: Suicide is Not Loving the Country (Insufficient)</h3>
<p>Recently, I saw in your newspaper that a few patriotic compatriots, out of anger and concern for the country in the face of Japanese aggression, have resorted to suicide. Their patriotic zeal is certainly commendable, but I do not approve of their actions. Suicide is the most cowardly expression of mankind. I consider people who commit suicide to be foolish at best. For example, in this case of committing suicide out of worry for the country and anger at Japan, I ask: after death, can you revive China? I believe that dying to love the country is not as good as living to save the country. Some say that suicide can arouse the patriotic fervor of the people, but I don't think so. The fervor of the people in resisting Japan depends entirely on the actual gains that the invading Japanese give us and the honest propaganda of the educated class. Even if you want to express your personal intensity and awaken the people, you can make enlarged publicity writings, you can cut off your finger and write a blood letter, why do you need to commit suicide lightly? If 400 million compatriots all commit suicide one by one, then the Republic of China will perish by itself. Some say that suicide is a positive expression of resisting Japan and saving the country, but that is even more wrong. If you want to actively die for China, you can petition the government to go to the front line to fight the Japanese bandits. Even death would be a happy one, at least more glorious, and it would also shock the Japanese's view of the Chinese national character. In short, I believe that in this critical period of resisting Japan, we should all do our best to engage in the movement of resisting Japan and saving the country, such as students working hard to publicize the return to double the effort to study, as a fundamental plan to save the country, or joining the volunteer army, the people's absolute boycott of Japanese goods, the people's absolute economic severance with Japan, the government's absolute non-compromise with the military, and the politicians' quick search for a livelihood, do not be political moths, and even more absolutely do not do traitorous acts... Then, the Republic of China, with thousands of years of history, will definitely not be burned down overnight. Patriotic compatriots, while we resist the bandits from outside, we must also strictly guard against the thieves inside the house!</p>

<h3>Letters Received</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In the October 28th issue of your newspaper, in the "Local News" section, it was reported that a freight train collided with the 10th passenger train on the Beijing-Shanghai line at Zhenru Xiyangqi, confirming that the 207th freight train did not reduce its speed when entering the station, causing it to rush out of the switch and reach the outer Yangqi, colliding with the 10th passenger train from Beijing. The location of the accident was originally at the station's Yangqi, which is a major responsibility for the responsible officers of this railway. According to the original report, the entire responsibility would be borne by me. The Ministry of Railways is in the capital, and the Management Bureau is in Shanghai, both nearby, making the matter very important to my position and status. Fortunately, the stationmaster of Zhenru Station admitted his fault. I hope that your reporter will re-inquire and publish the true situation. I am making this statement and requesting a correction in the "Letters to the Editor" column. With best regards to the editorial staff of the Local News section of Shenbao. From Lin Gangrui, train conductor of the 207th freight train. October 29th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I was shocked to read in your newspaper today about the hiring of foreign sailors by Chinese shipping companies in Shanghai. Regarding the Haiphong Company's Jing Shun vessel's replacement of the chief officer, first mate, second mate, and helmsman on the 17th of this month, member He Shengcai reported to our association and requested our assistance in finding a replacement. As a united organization of Chinese marine engineers, we should provide protection. We sent a letter to the company recommending He Shengcai as the new helmsman. On the 27th, member Huang Duncai came to the association and forced us to send a letter. We had already made arrangements and could not send another letter. Moreover, He Shengcai and Cai Xingyi were registered earlier than Huang Duncai in the unemployment registration list. According to our association's regulations, unemployment registrations are processed in order and cannot be disrupted. Chen Rongsheng is not a member of our association and did not register. Huang Duncai and Chen Rongsheng campaigned privately. Our association is following the regulations, so there is nothing improper. The statement that Huang et al. were not allowed to serve as the first or second mate, and that the association had to send someone to fill the position, while Huang and Chen claimed that they were appointed by Haiphong and approved by the Maritime Administration, and that both sides refused to yield, and the engine room was even attempting to resolve the matter by force, is completely untrue. Our association is a general organization of marine engineers and should bear the responsibility. If the person who posted the notice has any objections, they should come to the association directly and not conspire to incite others. I am writing this letter to request a quick correction. I hope you will not see it as impolite. To the Chief Editor of Shenbao. Chinese Marine Engineers Association. October 30th.</p>

<h3>A Fiery Autumn Morning</h3>
<p>— Luo Mang</p>
<p>In a daze, I pulled back the quilt. Silvery-white dawn streamed in from the window, carrying a brisk chill. My body shivered, and my mind cleared up.</p>
<p>I threw off the warm covers, got dressed, and heard the wind howling outside. This was an autumn morning.</p>
<p>I walked to the window and looked out at the vast parade ground, where many people had already gathered. At that moment, the shrill sound of a whistle pierced the air. He rushed out of the dormitory and ran towards the parade ground.</p>
<p>The air was bone-chillingly cold, and the students looked a little shrunken with the cold, their lips slightly blue. He reached out and picked up a wooden rifle. A gust of wind blew past, and goosebumps broke out all over his body. However, what was the cold to be afraid of? He had a fiery heart. No matter how cold it was outside, the colder it was, the more fiery and fervent it became inside him.</p>
<p>The instructor shouted the commands loudly.</p>
<p>His fervent heart beat wildly inside him. All of his blood vessels were powerfully stretched. His whole body seemed to contain boundless strength, ready to burst forth at any moment. He opened his mouth and exhaled bursts of hot air, as if to turn this cold surroundings into a fiery heat.</p>
<p>He stood at attention, his feet straight, all the strength of his body pouring down, flowing into his heels, into his toes. There was no more room for expansion below, as if he wanted to smash through the earth's crust.</p>
<p>The wind whipped the trees, causing them to rustle. Leaves fell from the branches and landed on the ground. The grass quivered. The withered branches, those gnarled, skeletal branches, were like the claws of the enemy, dancing before his eyes, about to pounce on him. He grabbed the wooden rifle with hatred, his chest filled with hot blood, as if he had to kill them all if they came any closer. His fingers were numb with the cold. However, he had a fiery heart. Could the cold make him retreat?</p>
<p>The instructor shouted the commands loudly.</p>
<p>Thick clouds covered the entire sky. The sun had lost its light and heat, making the surroundings even more gloomy and desolate. However, on this vast parade ground, these people on the parade ground had their own light and their own heat. They would use their light and heat to break through this surrounding gloom and desolation, and paint a vibrant scene.</p>
<p>They shouldered their rifles, they aimed. He pointed his rifle at a distant telephone pole, as if that telephone pole was the enemy. Sparks flew from his eyes. He wished he could go forward and pierce the enemy's chest with a bayonet, crush the enemy's heart and guts, wash away the shame of the motherland with the enemy's blood, and extinguish the fire in his heart. If the rifle in his hand was not a fake, then he would let bullets fly, killing the enemy one after another without leaving a single one.</p>
<p>They practiced charging.</p>
<p>He looked back at his comrades – his classmates, the citizens of the Republic of China. Each face shone with the light of revenge, each heart was fanned by the flames of killing the enemy. He thought in his heart, "Comrades, let us all charge forward, snatching back our existence, our happiness, and our glory from the hands of the enemy. We cannot let anything be lost. At the very least, we must pile up white bones into a tall fortress, and let red blood flow into a deep moat to block the enemy's advance. We cannot let anything be lost!"</p>
<p>The row of low trees in front seemed to be the enemy's position. The swaying branches seemed to be the enemies eager to move. "Comrades, let us charge over, trampling the enemy's camp into flat ground. We forget ourselves, forget everything, charge over, charge over, snatching back the glory of the motherland from the hands of the enemy!" Waves of blood surged high, mixing with the shouts of killing that broke the silence, like a tide, overflowing towards the enemy's position.</p>
<p>The instructor shouted the commands loudly.</p>
<h3>Dust of the Road</h3>
<p>— Tou Zhen</p>
<p>She arrived at my house with that plump baby in her arms, just as the pale yellow sunlight was beginning to illuminate the earth. I was holding the newspaper that had just been delivered, staring at it with intense eyes. Startling words were clearly imprinted on my eyes, one by one. As I read line by line, hot blood boiled. Her sudden arrival interrupted the impression the newspaper had given me, and I couldn't help but look at her in surprise.</p>
<p>It hadn't been ten days since she'd come to Shanghai from Guangzhou, and from Shanghai to Nanjing. I knew she was arranging the newly rented house in Nanjing.</p>
<p>"Rong, are you here in Shanghai for fun? I welcome you," I asked her in a typical Shanghai greeting, while offering her a seat.</p>
<p>"Did you arrive today?" I continued to ask.</p>
<p>"No," she replied as she sat down.</p>
<p>"I arrived last night at 5:00. I'm staying in an apartment. I didn't come to play, I came..." She hesitated, "He insisted I come, because their—their colleagues' families—have all come to Shanghai."</p>
<p>I immediately knew the reason she came. She was probably afraid that something similar to what happened in the three northeastern provinces would happen in Nanjing, so she braved the hardship of bringing her baby, who was less than a year old, to Shanghai and staying alone in an apartment. My house was in Nanshi, a dangerous area, so of course she didn't want to stay there. I didn't want to leave her either.</p>
<p>She didn't stay in the hotel for ten days, only seven days—a week—she wanted to go back. She couldn't stand the noise every night, especially the constant sound of mahjong tiles clacking, which never seemed to stop, constantly startling the baby in her arms and making it cry. She couldn't stand it anymore, so on the morning of the eighth day, she took the 9:30 express train back to Nanjing. Nanjing was still the same as before, and she was just pitifully caught in the dust of the road.</p>

<h3>Her Letter</h3>
<p>— Qingzhi</p>
<p>Here is a letter from a friend of mine. I feel it is filled with the common pain and troubles of modern young women. I have specially copied it out, hoping that the readers can offer a solution.</p>
<p>Qingzhi</p>
<p>I originally didn’t want to write you such a letter, but there’s no way. My stomach feels like it’s about to burst. This bellyful of complaints or grievances is overflowing. How can I not find a way to let it out? If you cannot sympathize with me and get angry at me, then I can only ask you to forgive me for the sake of our friendship.</p>
<p>This morning, I wrote letters to several friends with great enthusiasm, making a bellyful of complaints that I couldn’t contain. As the old saying goes, "Think thrice before you act." Yes, especially for a chatterbox like me, complaining excessively can get you shot. I am unworthy of doing such a thing as complaining recently. Saving a few copper coins on postage to buy food can make my stomach feel better for a while. I will no longer bother with this letter-writing business. Let any thoughts or theories be expressed in dreams.</p>
<p>My heart is now filled with unspeakable sadness. Yesterday, I received a letter from my mother, showing how much she cares for me. The road is so far, and she is so old, yet she wants to come and see me because of my poor situation. My heart is truly uneasy. Alas, the elders only hope that I can create happiness for myself. Alas, powerless as I am, I am going to disappoint her wish. How could I not want to seek a little happiness for myself? But it is as difficult as walking from the sea to an island. I have failed her hopes, only causing her to worry about my life. I am truly sorry for her. My heart is constantly repenting to her. I, who am burdening her so much, wish she would remember my sins and be able to cast me aside from her loving embrace and forget me. That would make me feel better. But a mother's heart, her thoughts are not as simple as I say.</p>
<p>I want to abandon my mother's love to seek human sympathy and understanding, but in this world, where is there sympathy? Who can understand me? In this society, it is filled with only scolding, ridicule, cold stares, jealousy, and resentment. All sins are behaviors between you and me, but don't say I am exaggerating. In reality, we are still begging for pity and seeking sympathy. We are each other's only ray of light behind the black curtain in broad daylight. Perhaps the only thing is a little mutual self-interest.</p>
<p>Of course, love can intoxicate us, but, Qingzhi, do you know? Love, like the rays of the sun, makes you unfathomable. It is constantly obscured by dark clouds, and only for a few minutes can it shine on you. These few minutes of its power will wither your precious youth. At this time, don't examine it too closely, as too close an examination will make you feel there is no room for survival.</p>
<p>Dream on. In dreams, you can find a lover's embrace, that passionate kiss, a heart beating for you. It is entirely yours. It is not subject to any conditions, nor is it driven by any self-interest. Break through your iron shoes and sacrifice everything to find your lover. Friend, it is carefree and sound asleep in your dreams. Seek my happiness in dreams. Ah, are you busy pursuing happiness? Happiness is so abstract, so empty. Be as busy as you can, until a pile of yellow earth covers you completely, leaving nothing untouched.</p>
<p>Friend, how could you know my current situation? I will tell you and it will shock you. Because of a physical condition unsuitable for childbearing, I am at a certain hospital on Shanhaiguan Road in Shanghai... In my current environment, I am desperately poor. How can I afford to spend more money to pay respects to those so-called PhD doctors? I have been bedridden for over a month. Randomly seeking doctors is like knocking on the gates of hell, especially for poor people seeking doctors. Asking for their sympathy is like bargaining with ghosts. Chinese Western doctors are as cruel as imperialism. Naturally, seeking [doctors] is not opposed under this monetary system, where there is no pay without work. But the Western doctors who are profit-mongering imperialists are exploiting [patients] a bit too excessively. I am still sick, for over a month now. Because the surgery was not done well, I may have to suffer from uterine disease in the future. These sufferings are the result of me, a poor wretch, pursuing love and happiness in this unsuitable environment.</p>
<p>Although my own situation is so bad, I still want to act as a mediator when I see the two of you quarreling. Friend, take it easy. Pain is unavoidable in life. Changes in love can sometimes make you feel very sweet, and sometimes they can make you feel very painful. Things like love, marriage, the pains of life, and the period from childhood to adulthood that must be unconsciously passed through, are just as natural. Don't think that life is always happy. We receive a seed of suffering from the time we are in the womb. This suffering shares our life and death, and no one can escape it. Friend, be optimistic. Quarrels between two lovers are unavoidable. There is nothing worth suffering about. If you want to suffer over these small things, then you are really too foolish. Finally, I wish you less idealism, more practical effort, to reduce mental suffering. Your friend, Jianfei, October 23rd.</p>
