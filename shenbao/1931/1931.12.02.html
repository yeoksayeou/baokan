<p>施肇基步步退讓</p>
<p>不再堅持明定撤兵限期</p>
<p>（巴黎）　昨夜中日代表所發聲明書、已表示東三省事件、有基於理事會行將採用之决議案早日解决之可能性、故國聯中人復呈樂觀、料理事會不久即可一致通過一决議案、規定日軍不斷的撤退、及派遣中立調查團調查此案、并料星期三或星期四即可舉行公開會議、星期二將由起草委員終日草擬新决議案、即十二理事之秘密會議亦擬停開、以期决議案之早見完成、嗣於深夜中代表團發表聲明書聲稱、日本開向錦州軍隊撤退苟有確實之報告、則中國在此環境下、將準備贊同理事會目下不特别規定日兵撤盡期限之决議案之大部份、又日代表伊藤亦發聲明書聲稱、日本準備接受理事會所擬决議案、祗須案内包含預防條文、允日軍對於土匪與不法份子之自衛可矣、理事會起草委員會旋於今日下午四時十五分重開會議、聽取伊藤對於日本所提修改點之陳述、按星期日委員會雖勸日本放棄勦匪條文、今日下午委員會又接日代表函、重申此項要求、并派伊藤到會陳述理由、堅持日統兵長官在安全之必要上、有軍事行動之權利、當起草委員會開會前、中國施總代表曾訪白里安、聞所談係關於法國駐日大使日前在東京與日外相幣原之談話迨起草委員會閉會、十二理事即於五時四十分開秘密會議、至六時五十分休會、討論起草委員會在草議决議案上所得之進步、今日國聯秘書廳又接東三省中立視察員報告、日軍已退至遼河以東、現國聯中人對前途極有希望、以爲本莊將可停止軍事行動、俾理事會得以進行其决議案、（三十日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>迷惘中之憂懼</h3>
<p>一昨本評已指陳當前國際情勢之迷離恍惚。更已指陳在此迷離恍惚之情勢中。我國家已臨到一新的嚴重關頭。聲請國人予以嚴密之注意。綜合當前各方面之事實而分析推斷。吾人認爲此迷離之局勢。刻正日益向嚴重之前途推進。同時吾人摸索於此迷離局勢之下。更感到非常之疑慮與憂懼。　　國際以建說中立區域防遏日本勢力之繼續西進。并藉此以緩和中日兩國間之空氣。而遂早日撒手。但使日軍不超越錦州而繼續西進。則東北問題可一任中日直接交涉此一情勢可於三十日華盛頓路透電訊美政府信任滿洲問題之解决。仍須依賴中日直接交涉之聲明。以及白里安致芳澤覆函。聲明派遣調查團及建立中立區域之非常手段。當可不至妨礙日本政府欲向中國政府提出之較大提案。且此議並不成爲第三者之干涉諸事實中體認把握。日本自强佔我東北以後。以爲此爲千載一時之機。趾高氣揚猶不自足。更欲伸長其鎭腕。透過山海關而伸入我國北部。但同時對於當前之國際情勢。未容毫無顧忌。故態度極爲矛盾充分暴露其外交上兩重外交之分歧。時而表示和緩。且撤退一部分軍隊。時而突變强硬。甚且主張在我河北設立中立區。并否認中日視察員。權力堅持中國軍隊須掃數撤至關内。要求日軍在中國軍隊撤退區域。得有所謂防匪之軍事行動。此種事實。亦無非欲以變化無常之態度疲勞國際之心理。同時更瞷伺國際情勢。於佔據東北之外。更威脅我國以西向推進其勢力。以入我國北部。而穩固其二期大陸政策之基礎。此一情勢。固亦極爲顯明。</p>
<p>吾人認爲無論如何今日國際之調停與日本態度之變幻。於我總絕無利益。吾人試迴首自國聯集會以來。日本着着爭先。毫無顧忌。有所主張。國聯無不曲意順從。而我國則着着失敗。着着退讓。有所申訴。國聯都置若罔聞。此日中立區域之設立。或即東北半壁山河從茲易色之確定。所謂調查。不過一借此下臺。并欺騙世人耳目之手段耳。</p>
<p>獨是吾人今日之所深爲迷惘憂惑者。則爲我國今日對此一嚴重之情勢。</p>
<p>究如何應付。中立區域旣由我建議而爲國聯所接受。最近期内。或且將成爲事實日軍之西進或遂亦可藉此緩衝地帶而防遏但錦州以東之問題。究將如何。將以設立中立區域爲解决東北問題之手段耶。抑以防遏日軍西進爲目的耶。據三十日巴黎方面哈瓦斯社之電訊。謂　般人士。都相信中國代表終將贊成决議草案。因撤兵問題。原屬最大難關。迄至此際已不十分重要而目前大衆所注意者。厥惟長城左近設置中立區域一事。然耶否耶。撤退東北日軍之主張。其遂就此放棄耶。此爲吾人所深爲迷惘憂懼者一。</p>
<p>重光葵三十日由滬到京。與顧外長討論滿洲中立區域問題。據路透電訊。謂東京方面希望此項討論。可啓中日直接談判滿洲問題之途徑。而同時在北平方面。日代表已在北平與張學良氏直接通文接洽。東京政界對於大局前途極爲樂觀。以爲不久可大有進步。此種事實之表現。其爲我政府已有直接交涉之準備耶。抑爲外交上别種事情之接洽耶。如其已有直接交涉之準備。則交涉之方針如何。交涉之目的又如何。失地是否堅持收回。任何新條件新要求是否堅决拒絕。此爲吾人所深爲迷惘憂懼者二。</p>
<p>吾人認目前之迷離局勢。深足以使國人日即於極危殆之悲境而不自覺。更足以使我國家日即於危殆。之悲境而無以自拔。新的噩耗。新的不幸事情。或將遂在此迷離局勢之下。突然出現。吾人於此實不勝其憂懼焉。</p>

<p>又電、關於歲入塡補案、與黨要人皆主張改正關稅、中止增稅、但井上以爲改正關稅、收入未定、不能認爲恒久的財源、表示反對、祇可就棟類細目上加减增删而已、</p>
<p>又電、與黨内對於藏相之增稅案、主張提高小麥等關稅、以塡補赤字中止增稅案、感於增稅案中包含改正關稅案、俾輕減國民之負擔、如尙不敷、則復在减債基金方面補救　雙方意見懸殊　若槻首相於今日上午、邀請富田顧問賴母木總務說明豫算編製上所以起債與增稅之不得已情形、並謂因募債而引起黨内之傾軋、頗抱遺憾、政府將參酌與黨之意見、而爲部分的修正、但對於大藏省原案、仍冀維持云、</p>

<h3>日軍</h3>
<p>鐵蹄下之吉長</p>
<p>日人積極擴張政治經濟勢力</p>
<p>北平通信、自日軍竊據我遼吉兩省以後、凡所設施　極爲殘暴、茲有由長春來平之某君、據談吉長情况　乃知吉林現已被日人封鎖、不獨省内消息不能外達、即外間情形、亦無自而入、緣略述其言如次、</p>
<p>封鎖新聞　長春出版之報紙　僅大東日報一家　平日常持反日態度、萬案起時、攻訐尤烈、日人恨之刺骨、此次日軍入城、其憲兵隊首將該報經理傳去、施以恫嚇、該經理尙能通權達樂、立反其平昔之態度、幸得保全、目下仍照常出版、惟稿件須經檢查後、方能付印、每日例有歌功頌德之文章、蓋已與瀋陽之東三省民報相同、而供日人之驅策　撻矣、吉林省垣、有吉長日報、受熙洽之津貼　聽日人之指揮、平津滬駐長春記者、初尙能偶然通信、報告日軍之殘暴行爲、乃其後因郵局檢查極嚴、不但將函件没收、且憲兵部尙按圖索驥、予通訊員嚴重之警告、及十一月制初旬天津益世報通訊員白曉峯、被憲兵部拘捕而去、毒打之後、至今未釋、平津滬各報一到長春、即被日軍扣留、數十報夫、因之失業而　埠消息之輸入、亦告斷絕、於是日人封鎖新聞、乃大功告成、</p>
<p>充實軍備　自南嶺兵營被告軍佔據後、即由其出資五十萬金、鳩工興修、已於十一月初旬完竣、駐步砲兵各一聯隊、劃其餘房賃與日商、開設料理店、又設立警察署及日憲兵分駐所、并將附近街道更名爲南嶺町及一丁目二丁名等名稱、一切設施、與滿鐵佔用地舞少異、復於距長　城西北十里地方李家油坊一帶、强購民田三千八百畝、建築飛行塲飛機庫、均已竣工、置飛機十二架、所儲石油、足敷百餘架飛機一年之用、滿鐵佔用地内之日兵營、自十月初旬起、常由旅大運到整車軍用品、聞其地下庫所存軍械、足敷五萬人作戰五年之用、蓋用以警備北滿方面之俄人勢力南侵也、</p>
<p>合併兩路　吉敦吉長二路、經金壁東（前淸肅觀王之子）與日人中川增藏（前滿鐵所派之吉長路代表）訂立密約、實行合併、定自十二月一日起、開駛直達通車、並易名爲長敦路、長春滿鐵車站前名長春站、吉長站前名頭道溝站、今則吉長車站名爲長春站、滿鐵車站則更名東站、據聞合併之密約、係十月二十八日所簽訂　當事者除日方代表外、華方爲熙洽金璧東二人、日方以合併實行、特送致熙洽金璧東各日金一百萬元、作爲酬勞費、</p>
<p>攫取電業　長春電燈廠、乃吉林省銀號商辦者、九月底日軍即派兵扼守、由南滿電氣會社派橋充該廠顧問、嗣日軍司令部將該廠廠長高吳子修召去、追令簽訂租用五十年之合同、吳不肯、與多門理論、理直氣壯、誓死不簽、多門見計劃不行、遂赴吉林、令熙洽將吳撤換、熙洽奉命唯謹、遂於十一月二十四日將吳免職、另委吳仁普接任、租電合同、預料不久即可簽訂、長春電業、從此斷送於人矣、據聞租用之内容、係謂長春中國電燈廠爲充足電力、向南滿電業會社租用電氣、每用一字、納費日金三分、以五十年爲期、該廠并須常久聘任日人充監督、管理一切財政事宜、全文計十條、此其大略也、</p>
<p>商業凋零　長春商埠地、本爲熱閙之所、近兩月來、路靜人稀、商店閉門、空門出租與舖墊出兌之紅紙招貼、屬目皆是、商會方面、近二個月據報歇業者、已二百餘家、城内最大百貨店協和商塲、從前每日可售二千元、現則二百元不及、其他洋雜貨店、從前日售四五百元者、今則二三十元猶不到、肅條景象、可見一斑、且市商會内、日軍亦正交涉安置日顧問二人、行見長春商業、盡爲日人操縱矣、</p>
<p>日軍示威　日軍於九月十九日佔據長春後所有電燈廠·電報電話局·公安局·市政處等機關、均派兵把守、至今未撤、其武裝大隊、則逐日在各馬路游行、近因第二師團開赴洮昂路綫攻略黑省、長堾警備單薄、乃由日商業學校生組、織義勇軍、帮同維持、該校學生多係幼童、大都不過十餘歲、亦復荷槍實彈、日日至城内示威、滿鐵守備隊、亦時時游行、海城砲兵隊、有時拖載十餘倆大砲及鐵甲車、緩步各馬路之上、因是各馬路每隔半句鐘、必有日軍經過、日軍又曾在</p>

<h3>日内閣動搖的前奏曲</h3>
<p>聯立内閣仍在醖釀中</p>
<p>東京通信、日本政局前幕已在慢慢的掀動、雖町田農相·櫻内首相·渡邊法相·小泉遞相·井上藏相等、連日以時局問題爲中心、極力激勵若槻首相趨於硬化、但在安達内相未歸京以前、前途總尙渺茫、二十一日安達自陸軍演習地歸京、征塵僕僕、於行裝甫卸之際、即以談話的形式、發表一篇聲明書、其要語「時局已經到重大的地步了、所以假若在國民之信念與决意上、承認有產生「以政黨協力爲基礎的國民内閣」時、那末無論在任何時候都可以、在這裏、並不需要若干的躊躇」、安達内相在發表聲明書的同時、决定避去各種不表面化的暗躍、打算公然與政友會直接交涉、</p>
<p>平地一聲雷、與黨政府全部動搖、二十二日若槻安達兩巨頭會見的結果、更呈現了極大的破綻、若槻說、「協力内閣的理想很贊成、可以實現時固然極好、但現在是實現不可能、所以還不如不談爲妙」、安達說、「實現是困難、但不能就斷定爲不可能、倘將來眞不可能、那就依不可能時的現狀幹能」、這兩個意見、是絕然水火、對於現内閣的運命、似乎加上了一層重重的灰色、同時若槻首相與安達内相間、顯然的發生了一直面的衝突、而引起了　閣　　　　　、　對立的　　、</p>
<p>瀋陽僞政府建設研究會之大門</p>
<p>若　首相力主維持現狀、安達内相極端贊成内閣聯立、在這裏面、野黨政友會的言動、大有値得注意的必要、最近政友會久原幹事長訪西園寺公時、陳述政友會的抱懷、大意說、「聯立内閣是違反憲政常道的、同時與我黨主張、絕然不相容、政策完全相異的朝野兩政黨、一旦突然提携同行、這是政黨的自殺、例如金再禁及外交問題等、政友會與現内閣斷　没有合作的可能、在這時候、政友會决定排除一切誘惑、努力於新單獨内閣的組成一這一篇言論、無論從事實上看或是從理論上看、似乎都具有棺當存在的餘地、同時顯然表示了政友會的不合作主義、而於聯立内閣組成上、加重了一重暗影、在今日重大難局之前、的確感到有產生舉國一致聯立内閣的必要、在今日有超黨派愛國心的國民、他决不至會反對聯立内閣之出現、換言之、反對聯立内閣的、可以說他就是非愛國國民」、這是二十三日安達内相與民政黨幹部會談時所發的聲明、在目前情勢之下、政友會已高蹈遠颺、反對聯立内閣、而若槻又絕力主張維持現狀、安達處於這兩大難的塲面之中、自不能不有這較露骨的聲明、同時爲要滿足「安達系」人物的追求起見、更不能不有這較露骨的聲明、這聲明不僅可以鞏固安達自己的政治立塲、並且給與了聯立内閣運動以若干之Ｓensation、民政黨在議會之中、本來把握了極對多數、這次安達的斷然脫頴而出、實不啻自翻場而、然在安達内相自身而言、到最近已萬無與若槻重行携手抛棄脫立内閣的主張、而陷自身政治於自殺之境的可能、安達旣不能邀若槻妥協、又不克與政友會提携　更不肯自毁前議、最後是否打算拉攏政民之一部、而另樹新黨、在目前尙不能論斷、</p>
<p>總之、聯立内閣倘能成立、「若槻内閣」必然崩潰、反之若聯立内閣不能成立、則安達爲自身政治立塲打算起見、祇能出之於辭職之一途、然安達内相的辭職、結局亦仍然可以誘發現内閣倒壞的工作、</p>
<p>前狼後虎、進退維谷、而若槻内閣的壽命、也許就會葬送在這裏聯立内閣的前奏曲中、（十一月二十四日壽發）</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>日本聶爾三島。常抱野郎自大之心。國人尙武。自稱爲大和　。隱然以武士道立國。欲執東方技擊之牛耳。其實於拳術一門。祇具皮毛。少林武當兩派。均所不精。罔論其吐納練氣之内功哉。惟彼邦所出品之倭刀。却有削鐵如泥之鋒利。然遠不如苗刀之柔能繞紙也。二十年前燕人霍元甲蒞滬演藝獻技時。勇名震中外。日本武士某甲。爲彼邦自命爲第一好身手。欲與霍登檯比武　霍恐傷甲後閙出外交。堅却之。甲疑霍之怯。大張其辭於東西各報。竟指霍爲徒負虚名者、霍門下士頗夥。少年尙氣者憤不能平。潛與甲較藝。竟爲所敗。於是甲之氣更張。親叩霍門。堅欲一試。霍笑曰。實逼處此。莫怪僕之魯莽也。盍先試手勁何如。甲　應曰。一切惟命。雄糾糾氣昂昂。伸雙手力撲霍。霍舉雙掌迎之。甫一交手。甲即跌出數丈外。霍趨前笑慰之。甲愧極汗流。自知力所不敵。乃改容謝霍。願拜爲師。厥狀頗恭。霍天性豪俠。不以爲意。殊不知甲早存殺霍之心矣。甲自執弟子禮。霍悉心指授。藝事猛進。翌歲甲邀霍赴東。與彼邦武士道往來酬酢。暗置慢性毒藥於酒中。霍不察狂飲之。未幾病發。甲故作抇憂狀。即爲送人醫院。醫生亦受甲之運動者。愈醫愈沉重。比及回國。病已不可治矣。大好英雄。乃竟遭倭奴之算。書至此不禁熱涙盈睫。擲筆而放聲一慟矣。哀哉霍元甲。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>戰神前之對話（三）</h3>
<p>「成敗雖然可以不論，存亡那裏可以不管？亡了國便要做亡國奴，這是應當考慮的。」</p>
<p>「亡國的人也有分别。不戰而亡國的人呌做亡國奴。屢敗屢戰，屢戰而還不免亡國於人，便是義人，義人之國呌做義國。義氣長留天地間，誰能亡他呢？誰能奴他呢？歐戰時，比利時不是一度亡了嗎？但絕無一人稱比利時人爲亡國奴。何以呢？比利時人已經拚了死命衛護中立，保持國格。美國白人以外，還有黑人與紅人。黑人從前稱爲黑奴，身體可以拿來做買賣，没有奮鬥精神。紅人是威武不能屈之民族，寗死不投降。紅種雖漸少，絕無一個紅奴。白人中有黑色祖宗的每爲人輕視，有紅色祖宗的却爲人敬重。我們不必怕亡國！不戰而亡纔是人間最大之恥辱咧。」</p>
<p>「話雖不錯，無奈中國内部不能統一，我總有些心虚。」</p>
<p>「中國人民何嘗不統一？何嘗不是一致對外？不統一的只是政客與軍閥。統一不是空談所能奏效的。爲公理人道對暴日宣起戰來便自然而然的統一了。」</p>
<h3>臺南决心抗日之小民族</h3>
<p>— 鷄冠</p>
<p>舊友王君雅南。曾東渡扶桑。並遊歷南洋各島。前於席上談及臺灣島中有光村者。處於山嶺中。居在村内之土民。與日人不相往還。其抗日性之遺傳。世代堅守。迄今未變。斯亦事之値得注意者矣。</p>
<p>所謂光村者。乃土人之音。該地處臺南萬山叢中。爲一種臺島番民聚居之所。人口祇數十家。自爲婚嫁。不與外人交接。性多習武。爬山越嶺。視爲常技。即女子亦多能與飛鳥相逐。健壯殊不遜於男子也。現在此種土人。仍自種自織。絕不受日人之同化　其抗日精神。殊可欽佩。</p>
<p>據述十餘年前。日本守將有名福島者軍事之暇。輒喜作探險遊。其日行抵該村。竟爲土番所圍擊。衛兵死三人焉。福島逸而奔。繼率兵往剿。至則叢山空虚。查無人跡。以無從搜索。廢然而返。嗣後屢往偵察。迄鮮消息。實則土番遷徙。行無定踪。倭人固亦無如之何也。近年來日人口稀少。不足爲患。遂任其自生自滅。不加干涉。因此臺南人民。語及光村。亦視同化外矣。</p>
<p>又據人談。光村居民確屬臺南土著中最古之一種。日人奪我臺島時。其酋長某氏。曾立誓抗日。以不敵被戮。今其孑遺。遂以山林爲棲身之所。仇日之志。迄不稍减。小民族固未嘗無志氣。殊可風矣。</p>
<p>世界小事記</p>
<p>不用金錢而以貨物作交易。近很流行於美國。鄕間的醫生爲人醫病。不取醫費。而以雞和雞蛋爲代。種田的用具　也可不用錢購買。而以麥作抵。有一家學校中。不收學生的學費。代之以麥。</p>
<p>普魯士雪勒西亞Silesia　省的薩加Saga　鎭中。產貓極多。因此豢貓之家　都須納稅。每家倘有了一頭貓。納稅一金鎊。有了第二頭。納稅三金鎊。若有四頭。納稅四金鎊。</p>
<p>坎那大的皮貨。現已成爲偉大的實業。每年達六百萬金鎊。那邊有五千五百十三家皮貨廠。專出貂·狐·𧲹·麝·鼠·水貂等皮。以供人們禦寒之用。</p>
<p>英國故大時人彭揚Bunyan　的不朽的名作「香客的進行。」“Pilgrim's　Progress”至今銷數極暢。曾譯成一百二十六種文字。打破一切文學的紀錄。</p>
<p>法國萊士　Rheims　區域中。產葡萄最多　今年因害蟲爲害　天氣惡劣。收穫極少。據說釀香檳酒都没有一九三一年的新原料。</p>
<h3>一隻白麻雀</h3>
<p>— 淺</p>
<p>友人潘子安。昨述伊家附近發現奇雀一頭。其狀與普通麻雀無異。惟遍身羽毛雪白。性詭譎。不易捕捉。費却二十餘日之心力。始克置之籠中。曾一度檢諸本草綱目。未見載有何用。但云爲祥瑞之兆。未知該鳥果堪珍奇歟。抑係遼東白豕耶。因登之報端。一詢世之博雅者。</p>
<h3>初冬話牛乳</h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>人類因飲食不得法。所受之痛苦。迄今始漸解决。十九世紀末。有機化學智識露曙光。食料乃分析爲簡單之化合物。最近二十年。滋養原理發明。牛奶遂身價十倍。於是牛乳業由家庭經營而蛻變爲一二千萬元資本之實業。售賣乳產品之商業亦應運而生。問題益趨複雜。茲與我人有關係者。筆之於左。</p>
<p>乳牛與牛乳　凡牛能長期產乳。乳之代價較身肉昻者謂之乳牛。其始祖爲博司。Ｂos　族與他牛同。以育種改進成乳牛。牛族有二。曰博司印第加。曰博司陶爾司。旋用人工蕃殖法。種益繁。乳牛之優良者。推脫西Ｔersey　格爾西Ｇuernsey何爾司丁Holstein　三種、脫西色自淡灰至灰深棗紅茶。每頭平均重量九百磅。日產乳十九磅左右。富牛油。油球甚大。格爾西間具白黃紅各色。輕者一千磅。重者一千三百磅。每日可產二十二磅乳奶。色素獨濃　他牛不能望其項背。能誘主顧。乳場樂用之。何爾斯丁產乳爲各牛中首屈一指。含油少。色較白。多蛋白質。喂孩最宜。是牛身帶黑白。體重一千七百磅。牛類中之碩大者。吾人飲乳。於此應三注意焉。</p>
<p>微菌與牛乳　牛乳能養人。又能養微菌。健康之牛。每立方生的米達乳汁。多則一二百微菌。少則十餘而已。哈丁於一二三○樣子牛中發現平均每立生的米達有四二八微菌。温度尤高。菌生產力尤速。乳酸化時　菌占百分之九十。乳硬化後。菌達百分之九十九。肺勞手足腫傷寒</p>
<h3>臺灣記者亡國恨（下）</h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>消息壟斷　台灣自入日人之手。即與世隔絕。函電不得自由通發。報紙國外消息唯一來源。一爲日本電通社。一爲聯合通訊社。前者日本獨資經營。後者日美合辦。舍此無其他機關。即路透社稿。亦在被禁之列。是所以蒙蔽台人。世界大勢。人類生活。非彼輩所能夢想。此次日軍在華暴行。台報都受指使。滿紙宣傳中國士兵盡屬土匪。欺侮弱小民族。傷害正義日軍。毁壞日本旣得東省權利。經視國際道德等含血噴人之詞。是非顚倒。黑白淆亂。有識台人。心知受騙。然身入五里霧中。眞相莫明。</p>
<p>檢查痛苦　日人旣掌握台灣報紙。猶恐新聞政策之或失。復行嚴勵監視。各報大樣。未付梓前。戀送警察局檢查。名曰「檢閱」。開天窗平均二三日一見。暫時停刋及延遲印行者。月必數起。報人被罰逮捕放逐失踪。時有所聞。記者一有反日嫌疑。便衣警察到處追踪。茶館酒肆。街頭巷角。須臾不離。隨時隨地有家破身亡之虞。較諸聞名世界之俄國訖卡意國黑衫黨暗探。尤暴戾恣誰萬萬也。張君言此。聲涙俱下焉。</p>
<p>白喉紅疹熱喉痛以及腸胃病。往往由乳菌媒介。可不懼哉。防禦法除清潔奶房。採用小口奶桶。洗濯擠乳器外。應用巴斯德法之消毒。該法提高牛乳熱度至華氏一百六十度以上。歷時半分。急降温度使乳冷。上法海上大乳塲多用之。年來有瓶内消毒法。俾乳消毒後。不再與空間接觸復滋微菌也。罐頭乳一八五三年波頓發明。代乳粉爲架司特。康帕爾。三克伯發明。亦經消毒矣。</p>
<h3>捐畫助黑記</h3>
<p>— 馬孟容</p>
<p>倭寇日深。東隅已失。而當局諸公。鎭靜不抗。坐視辱師失地。莫可如何。獨吾馬占山將軍。以一旅之衆。抗數萬之師爲國干城。撑持半壁。浴血奮戰。屢挫敵鋒卒以彈盡援絶。暫退海倫。警報傳來。此間人士無不熱憤塡膺。爭相輸欵。以勞其師。誠義舉也。茲者許君溪西。爲石門吳待秋先生之快婿。雅擅書畫。冰清玉潤早已譽滿藝林。適從鴛湖來滬。吳君振平。張君宜生。訪之于其旅邸。許君慨然曰。國難方殷。吾輩書生。旣不能投筆以從戎。上馬而殺賊。愧煞鬚眉。我久事筆硯。篋中藏有畫百幅。願悉粥值。捐助黑軍餉。兩君聞其主而壯之。張君亦捐其近作數十件。吳君爲籌備其事。即于廿七日起在新世界飯店禮堂舉行展覽三日。予適在冗次承待秋翁之柬邀。重以振平君之請屬。遂冐雨往觀。由許君導讀諸作品。見其山水渾厚古質。有前賢法充。無時史習氣。雅似其丈人筆法。其題字亦極肖。知其得力於待翁深矣。其仿唐六如沈石田諸幀。亦沈雄挺秀。允爲合作。花卉亦筆墨超拔。而丰致翩翩。奄有撝叔夢廬子祥之長。溪西蓋私淑於鴛湖諸老歟。宜生工圖案畫近亦致力國畫曾游待翁之門。故其畫亦有待翁之風。待翁山水精妙。價重雞林。社會已有定評。予尤愛其花卉之古樸。予久不作山水。年來雅喜寫生以自娱。待翁許爲有古法。而富新趣。爲天妥工力兼到之作。并慫恿作花鳥草蟲册以爲習畫者範。予滋愧焉。（移酬助黑）</p>

<h3>鄉下人又到上海（三十四）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>這時鄉下人好像是發了狂了。人家不知道他爲了什麽事？拉也拉不住他。以爲是一個喝醉了的醉漢，但是鄉下人剛纔的確没有喝過什麽酒。以爲是一個發神經病的痴子，但是鄉下人的確没有神經病。路人都覺得莫名其妙，恐怕他闖了什麽禍，大家都圍住了他，問他到底爲了什麽事？</p>
<p>「你們没有看見他的電光燈上是兩個什麽字嗎？」</p>
<p>路上行人，被鄉下人這樣一指點，果然大家都昂起了頭，睜大了眼睛，觀瞧上面的電光燈，也一點没有什麽可異之點，却不知道他的心中，是懐着什麽意思？大家只是痴望着他，望他更有詳細的說明。</p>
<p>「你們知道當世的吾國英雄，是什麽人？」鄉下人很慷慨激昻的，在許多羣衆中，這樣說了。</p>
<p>大家聽了他這話，益覺愕然。因想這個鄉下土老兒，難道眞個有神經病的嗎？不然，就是中了現在新流行的那種武俠小說的毒，什麽英雄？什麽豪傑？閙個不清。大概瘋人的口中，都是說出那種神怪豪傑的話，崇拜古英雄。有如那班患色情狂的人，都是熱慕着西廂記崔鷺鶯，紅樓夢的林黛玉一般。　　大家對於鄉下人所問的英雄，也想置諸不理。而且一時回答不出當世誰是英雄？</p>
<p>「現在時代中，那個在絶塞苦戰的黑龍江主席馬占山將軍，算不得吾國一位當世英雄嗎？」</p>
<p>鄉下人這句話一說出來，大家都贊成，贊成中，還有拍手的，還有歡呼的，都說：</p>
<p>「英雄！英雄！確是一位當世英雄！」大家再也想不到這個鄉下人，却是一位愛國主義者，都一致贊成他的話不差。</p>
<p>「那末你們都擁護馬占山將軍嗎？」鄉下人大有領導羣衆的態度。</p>
<p>「擁護馬占山將軍！」「擁護絶塞苦戰的馬占山將軍！」</p>
<p>這時一般羣衆，都喊起口號來了。那種壯烈的情形，激動了許多行人，漸漸的加入很多。</p>
<p>「旣然我們都擁護馬占山將軍，那末倘有人反對馬占山將軍，我們不應該打倒他嗎？你們瞧！爲什麽這裏的電光燈，標明了「反占」兩字，這不是明明反對馬占山，反對馬占山，我們不應該一致抗爭的嗎？」</p>

<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市洋厘市價　開盤人心鬆軟、、因而下游、爲七錢二分四厘三毫七忽半、午市又跌半厘許、爲七錢二分三厘七毫半、結果較前日早市共跌二厘、（銀拆）早午市依舊開出四錢　而劃頭加水亦仍有三錢强弱　銀行掛牌一錢六分、銀根形勢未有見和穩希望、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋、早午兩市同爲六錢四分七厘半　較前日午市回昂一厘、做出交易、早市三千角、午市二千五百角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢五分○二毫半、午市爲六錢五分一厘、做出交易、早市二十一萬角、午市九萬五千角、銅元仍照舊章、爲三百七十八千五百文、交易三萬○二百餘串、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　（銀欵）昨日銀行收解、因月底甫過、比較簡略、然補理結欵不少、計華商收解票欵二百四十餘萬、外商收解票欵二百餘萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解八百五六十萬、結欵補理二百八九十萬　進倉六十萬、出倉四十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千九百餘萬劃頭欵收解四百十餘萬、各路匯欵收解四十餘萬、解現五十餘萬（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出一百三十三萬、午市做出一百萬、鈔票早市十四萬、午市三萬五千、場外鈔票、早市九萬、午市七萬、銀行交易、早市互市八十萬、午市五十餘萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百四十餘萬、鈔票進出二百十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解五百四十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百八十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百三十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、客路來源三十餘萬、</p>
<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>公債續漲二元左右</p>
<p>趨勢略平市面路旺</p>
<p>昨（十二月一日）華商證劵交易所各債市况、現貨開出多種、賣買尚稱活潑、期市雖旺、然爲賣出交易受有限制、各債劵仍少鉅額成交、晨初開出時、以市場人心猶佳、各方零星收進暢旺各債劵比停拍時躍漲甚鉅、即較前日暗盤亦無大出入、惟收盤市場人心轉鬆、買方情况、已非如前之興奮、蓋外交局勢、非如前日之樂觀、日方實未悔禍、陰謀擾亂、仍在進行、而國聯束手觀望、調處猶無術也、以是買氣漸衰、各價紛紛回疲、後市一盤、趨勢穩定、盤旋而無大上落、然收市形勢、市場人心、大致尙稱良好、結果較前現貨惟一九善比上月中旬跌逾三元、其他上漲甚鉅、期貨祇編遣九六回跌、餘各續漲一元數角至二元餘不等、計全日現貨交易二萬五千元、期貨上午三百六十六萬五千元、後市一百二十一萬五千元、合計四百八十八萬、内統鹽稅·二○關捲均計七八十萬元、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>河下米市大跌小回</p>
<p>南頭　昨浦江來貨二十餘號、本城市銷極淡、常錫中關貨跌勢益熾、須小二角、薄稻存貨不弱、銷場本街平淡、寗胃亦然、市價高修角許、中段之貨亦低二尺、杜洋尖貨稀胃呆、形亦跟疲、變陰元酒作坊需要尙殷　陳破受新貨影響、開盤降低一角、浦江斛脚一千石之譜、</p>
<p>新閘　　昨米情仍在呆懈狀態中、早間開盤未見轉好、買方趨勢步跌、鄉莊帮全無胃口、崑山江陰米存積尙厚、大盤回落一二角、常錫西新及靑浦練塘等早晚稻來貨雖缺、但本城店胃異常淸淡、行情各短一角、糯米貨色有限、價無上落、洋盧尖提高殺次、</p>
<h3>期小絞洋行抛出一千噸</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、暫居平站之局、因一般人以爲東北與天津日軍撤退後、該地客帮必將暢辦糧食、洋米一經客辦、市面必須上展、但實際上客帮尙無問津、本街意存觀望、交易淸淡、行情未克即見上展也、統市只開小絞米百餘包、價十元○一角半、期貨回籠未開、新交易則有禪臣洋行抛出小絞五月份一千噸、價五兩、均爲本街收進、行情則與前開無大出入云、</p>
<h3>粉價俏後回平</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面曾一度呈俏俐之象、以洋麥報價旣漲六七角、時局形勢又似轉機、而前月之棧單交割、亦未甚豐、一般人有此想象、市氣遂佳　開盤後近遠期均較前月底漲二三分左右不等、五月份循例開拍、初開二兩一錢一分、後隨各月份回鬆、迨至下午開盤、以金價仍回至七百兩關内、時局情形、又不若預期之樂觀　人心遂又不振、觀後步終須實銷有力、方能穩住也、結果本月份較前月底好五厘、一月份好二厘半、二月份好五厘、三月份好二厘半、四月份好七厘半、五月份較開價亦小一分半</p>
<h3>麥市午後轉懈</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面大致呈穩定之象、以洋麥報價、回漲六七角左右、兼之時局形勢、稍見緩和、故開價後、近遠期較前月收價、均回高五六分不等、惟至下午各盤、各月份市勢又呈懈檔、以日本撤兵、一般人均認爲問題、况所撤者係一部份、天津與黑省反見增如、有此原因、前途粉銷、尙無巨大之希望、麥之不振、似又不免矣、結果本月份較前日好二分、一月份好三分、二月份好二分、三月份好四分、四月份好四分、五月份未開云、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>粗砂白交盛亦挺</p>
<p>昨糖市產區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一三五、比較前電續跌一二五、紐約粗糖十二月份價一·○九、比升一分、明年度三月份一·○八、比跌二分、五月份一·一三、比跌五分、九月份一·二六、亦跌二分、爪哇現期糖仍乏升沉、公會市場劃盤、荷糖交易略盛、廿四號粗砂白成交價至十兩○二錢、高貨十兩○三錢　二十號中砂白十兩、十八號九兩九錢、磨細砂白十兩○二錢半、綿荷白十一兩三錢半、八號荷赤八兩四錢、十號貨八兩七錢半、市形均皆堅挺、太古糖交易略寂、Ｂ嘜十一兩八錢、ＣＷ嘜十一兩七錢、ＨＸ嘜十一兩六錢半、ＨＭ嘜十一兩四錢、需要殊寥　趨勢平而不奇、惟Ｂ嘜則以出户較缺、市氣較爲挺秀云</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>廠經絲商虧本抛售</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無漲勢、查海外絲銷、依然疲滯　廠經電轉價小、廠方本重難售、而回胃仍濃、各廠商因周轉需欵　押貨困難、祇得忍痛讓價抛售、昨由信孚等進中身現貨白廠經八十包、川黃廠經三十包　價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶歐銷暢達</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、路莊土莊兩路之珍眉綠茶、英莊恰和錦隆同孚協和等行　進意濃厚、中低莊貨、去路尤爲活潑、全市成交共達八百餘箱、售盤均無變動、惟貢熙一項、俄國協助會仍未開辦、白頭莊亦在停頓中　並無續交易云、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>靑鉛開價十四兩進關</p>
<p>靑鉛交易、邇來異常蕭條、雖各同業盡力兜售、但環境險惡、結果實交無多、故邇來趨勢頗不樂觀、因此開價一層、亦異常不振、昨每擔祇估十三兩九錢　比上日又跌進一錢、查交易除門市及本街開出三四百條外、出口帮依然無問　者、據熱悉者云、欲靑鉛前途之發展、恐年内無大希望云、</p>

<h3>專論</h3>
<p>閩省築路之成績·學·遷</p>
<p>閩省自民國十七年許顯時就建設廳長後即計劃建築閩省幹路五綫。並募集公路公債四千萬元。以爲建築公路費用。此項公債分爲五年募集。每年募集八百萬元。案經省府通過。惟年來閩省疊經政變及匪禍天災。募集公路公債之舉　因之遲延日久。未能實行。本年度數月前楊樹莊提議實行開始募集第一期公路公債八百萬元。雖又經省府會議通過。而兩月來又災禍頻仍。此舉自又無形擱置。惟公路公債雖因故未能募集。而建設廳分設各叚公路工程處。按段分派民工　並以公路附加捐之收入　爲各叚工程處經費之補助。故照前所築成之幹路。已達一千零八十五里。將告完成者。達四百七十五里。尙待建築者爲二千四百六十里。（幹綫五條統計四千零二十里）茲分述之如下。</p>
<p>（一）閩淅第一幹線。此線係由關侯經連江羅源寗德霞浦福鼎等縣入浙。全線長一百里。現此線僅有閩侯連江一叚計四十里已興工。不久此叚便可完成。（二）閩浙第二幹線。此線係由南平經建。甌浦城入浙。全線長五百四十里。現南平至建甌間有六十里已完成。又浦城至仙陽鎭間五里亦已完成。其餘各叚將興工。（三）閩粤幹線。此線由閩侯經福淸莆田晉江同安龍溪漳浦雲霄詔安入粤。全線長一干一百二十八里。現已築成通車者。爲閩侯至常思嶺叚計四十里。常思嶺至江口叚已成八十里。江口至楓亭叚全部一百二十六里。楓亭至洛陽叚全部九十二里。洛陽至同安叚全部一百五十五里。同安至角尾叚全部九十二里。角尾至漳州叚全部六十八里。尙餘六十二里。年内可完成。漳浦至雲霄叚已成五十八里。尙有七十里。亦已着手建築。此外有雲霄至詔安叚一百三十六里。尙未興工。建設廳已派員首往等備。（四）閩贛第一幹線。此線由閩侯經南平順昌邵武光澈入贛。全線長九百八十二里。其中已完成者。爲閩侯至穆源叚十五里。九里灘至南平叚三十五里。邵武至光澤叚二十里。尙有三十五里。年内可通車。（五）閩贛第二幹綫。此線由龍溪經南靖龍巖靖長汀入贛。全線長六百六十里。現已完成者。爲漳州至水潮叚八十過。尙有六十里年内可通車。水潮至龍巖叚七十里尙有六十八里已測量完竣將興工。汀州至古城叚十六里。尙有四十里在建築中。以上各線中。閩粤幹線全部殆將完成。惟其中有洛陽橋五里橋等處。尙須改建新式橋樑。需費頗鉅。全省公路局對此已計劃中。想全線通車之期。當已不遠。此外龍溪惠安思明東山長泰龍巖漳浦南靖等縣最近築成之支線里數。計五百里左右。其餘各縣支路之正在測量建築中者。亦不下四五百里。在此災禍頻仍。外患正亟。凡百諸端。皆在停頓之中。則閩省公路進行。有此成績。亦可謂難能可貴。至於兩年前已經完成之該省各公路。如靖林路·漳九路·漳靖路·漳南路·漳阪路·漳莊路·漳經路·漳烏路·泰浦路·泉園路·泉永路·山平路·江角路·泰巖路·琯洪路·靖山路·等。計約六七百里。尙不計在内。故在日前。閩省已經通車之幹路支路及各縣里數。統計已達二千餘里云。</p>
<h3>一九三二年式</h3>
<p>各牌新車一瞥·虞</p>
<p>一年容易。又是歲尾。光陰迅速。無異汽車之駛行。轉眼便去。稍縱即逝也。歐美各國之汽車製造家。因此歲肇更易之季。早將新車計劃安排停當。駕駛者只須隨心所欲採購選擇可耳。茲將一九三二年各家新車概况彙誌如次。藉供選購者之一助焉。</p>
<p>馬律斯車　英製著名汽車馬律斯牌新車。業已裝運來滬。不日即能與各界仕女相見於陳列室中。馬律斯車之聲譽。向頗籍籍。新車之爲馬律斯廠精心出品。殆無用疑。談及式樣外形。自是超人一等。至於改革及進步之處。又難勝述。馬律斯車製造於英國奥克斯福考萊地方。其所造之汽車向分四大類。即馬律斯小車·馬律斯大車·馬律斯考萊及馬律斯奥克斯福是也。每類又分爲六種模型。故綜計之式樣亦殊衆多。據銷售此牌之經售人稱。來滬之新車爲數當不甚多。頗有求過於供之虞云。至其理由。則據稱。第一爲新車登塲。開頭運來之種類並不甚多。而需要新車者爲數必衆。於是不敷分配。且美國所造之汽車。其新樣往往須待正月中舉行之紐約汽車展覽會閉幕後。方將新車開始發售。在此期内購買者自亦較爲殷需矣。第二爲銀價高漲。售價削低。購買者當更踴躍。且馬律斯久著盛名。購者自多。至於廠方出品先銷國内。然後始運往海外。故一時不致有大宗輸出也。新車式樣衆多。如兩人坐跑車。四門轎車。其尤著者也。關於式樣方面者。一九三二年式之馬律斯車散熱器具用絡製。光耀悅目。形式優美。凡六缸式者具有鉻製之自動窗板。安全方面新車亦極顧到。風屏及車窗。具用三部合式安全玻璃裝置。汽油櫃裝於車架之後下部。不與車廂部份接觸。馬律斯新式轎車之前部爲「避風」式。不但增進美觀。且能隔離風息及保持引擎之力量。</p>
<p>標準牌車　標準牌汽車亦爲英製中之佼佼者。該廠具有二十八年之造車經騐。故其出品卓越。大爲購用者所稱賞也。一九三二年式之新車現已首途來滬。不久即可抵此。新車於機械方面改進甚多。極合於現代經濟潮流之用。至其舒適美觀。售價低廉。尤其餘事耳。一九三二年之標準牌車。計有標準「二十。」標準「十六。」標準「大九。」及標準「小九」等四種。此種汽車之特色。前祇大車及高價車所獨有者。標準牌均羅而致之。譬如以油櫃一項而論。裝置於車架之下。絕對安全。車身前後均裝避震品。此外如輪線風屏等咸均革新。至於用油之省。售價之低。又爲其他具有同等舒適之車所不及。此車駕駛管理均極便捷。故婦女尤喜用之。煞車亦具力甚大。使用之時祇須一觸便有奇效也。標準牌新車車廂製造特佳。地位寬暢。進出便利。光線甚爲充足。車具四門。美觀而舒適。車身髹漆尤爲奪目。新車散熱器式樣甚爲美觀。而最稱便利者爲車頂之裝置。此種車頂名爲司坦拉愛脫式。祇須稍撥機紐即能張卸自如。雖在行車之時亦能安然動作也。</p>
<p>搿萊哈姆　據地屈立屋傳出之消息。一九三二年式之搿萊哈姆新車爲六缸式。而其售價則甚爲低廉者。新車優點甚多。一時未能盡述。姑舉其犖犖大者言之。此車爲六只汽缸式。行動之時平穩快速。絕無震顫之苦。車上又裝置自由輪。輪基加放。車身寬大。故駕駛者在在得有舒適之感也。至於車身式樣之美觀。引擎之改革。尤能令使用者滿意云。</p>
<p>威萊士車　威萊士六缸新公共汽車及Ｃ一五七號商用汽車。具有一百五十七英寸之輪基。咸爲威以士哇浮蘭之新出品。此外尙有載重一噸半之Ｃ一三一號。及載重半噸之Ｃ一一三號。凡茲各種新車車身式樣莫不適用於實業及商用。且其使用之時又極經濟。新車爲六缸式。具有最新式之六十五匹馬力引擎。油壓之裝置尤爲特色。半噸及一噸半載重之車上。均裝有四種調速器。及内漲式之四輪煞車。新車使用上甚爲耐久云。</p>
<p>赫特森車　赫特森愛山克水牌汽車。流行頗廣。自斯潑林氏被任爲引擎計劃師後。其一九三二年式之新車。特色甚多。斯氏於計劃造車具有多年之經騐。不但有聲於美。即歐洲各地亦慕其名也。職是之故一九三二年式之赫特森新車。一經斯氏指點煥然動人。式樣美觀。行動平穩。均意中事耳。近數年來斯潑林氏曾爲世界各地名人計劃汽車之製造。最著名者若西班牙王阿爾芳沙。紐約市長「其美」華克。依利沙白士阿登。羅傑華爾夫甘。曼麗辟克馥。洛克舍。湯姆密克斯。白耐哇爾特飛。寳林佛萊特立克。康拉那傑兒。陶格拉司范朋克。卓别林。夏萊哇尼爾等是也。</p>
<p>順風派克　克雷斯勒所出之順風牌汽車。頗爲人所樂用。市上流行亦甚廣泛。據最近所得消息　滬上將有五十五輛順風新車發售。第二批之來滬期爲時亦將不遠。新車特色頗多。並均裝用自由輪。預料因需求者殷·一經抵滬定能不踁而走也。又有第沙多六缸之一九三二年式新車亦已開始陳列。第沙多新車中亦裝用自由輪。至八缸之第沙多不日亦將與滬人士相見。派克車爲聲譽極佳之車。一九三二年式者精益求精。令人括目相視。樣車業已陳列。一經察閱。當知其華麗舒適安全之三要素。爲非虚語也。派克新車之最大特色爲其駕駛及管理上之輕便靈活。不論路面作何情形。車中乘客若干。氣候如何變更。派克車必能令人獲到意外之舒適平穩。因其避震之裝置。在在勝人一籌也。克雷斯勒一九三二年新車車樣亦已抵滬。惟所有者爲六缸式。八缸式者則一時尙未能運來云。</p>
<p>道琪新車　道琪牌汽車爲道琪兄弟所計劃製造。行暢甚廣。極獲佳譽。一九三二年式新車。亦已出世。據稱爲道琪歷年造車成績中之最佳者。其中尤以八缸新車爲最。具有七十六匹之馬力。故力量彌巨。行動平穩。引擎作Ｌ頭式。汽缸則排比而列。使用之時燃料甚屬經濟。至於形式美觀更無庸言。</p>
<h3>夏令配亞</h3>
<p>萬國汽車展覽詳記·影·呆</p>
<p>轟傳一時之英國夏令配亞汽車展覽會。已於十一月五日正式開幕。當此英國各地。經濟萬分恐慌時期。各種實業。均有衰落之象。而汽車事業。則由此次萬國汽展之證明。顯然有極大之發展。茲將種種盛况。錄之以實本刋。想亦爲關心汽車事業者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>成功的表露　在過去一年之中。英國各種商業。日見衰落。然英國之汽車事業。適與其他實業相反。竟有極大之成功。此誠出於我人意料者也。今日英國之汽車事業。在全國各種大企業中。已佔第四位矣。且從最近國内之銷路。及海外貿易之證明。顯然前途尙有重大之發展。蓋今</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>日交通事業。日見發展。而汽車之需要。自在意料。最近英國汽車之出口數量。較之歷年。大有進展。是以在過去二年之中。汽車事業。已顯然可保證將來的發展。即以最近六個月中而言。澳大利亞。新西蘭。南非洲各地。所進口之汽車。爲英國所製造者。已佔百分之二十九。然我人設回顧二年前之情形。則上述各地。所進口者。英國汽車。尙不滿百分之十二也。</p>
<p>努力於經濟　此次倫敦所舉行之萬國汽展。已予我人以極大之滿意。蓋否則不拘英國内外。參觀諸人。將受深印之不良印象。且由事實之證明。此次汽車展覽會中。英國各車廠之出品。不拘任何種類。均有成功之表示。而主要問題。即適合社會之環境。申言之。即在合乎經濟原理是也。蓋在夏令配亞汽車展覽會中。我人已深知各廠汽車。均能合乎經濟原理。且各種新車。改良之處。不勝枚舉。車岙旣較車寬放。而售價反較舊車爲低。已盡價廉物美之能事。實爲各國出品所望塵莫及也。</p>
<p>安全之注意　晚近都市之中。來往車輛。日見增加。而汽車之速率。又因引擎製造之進步。而日見演進。於是行車之時。能否安全。遂成爲主要問題矣。蓋即屬最小之車輛。當其行駛之時。亦異常神速。（未完）</p>

<h3>最近意大利文壇</h3>
<p>— 莫京</p>
<p>意大利六小說</p>
<p>第一本我們要介紹的是卡爾達萊利（Di　Vincenzo　Cardardll）「Il　Sob　A　Picco、」是一篇回憶的小說、卡氏文律之可愛簡樸、令人讀了爲之不忍放釋、他這本書是這樣的開頭、「我所生的村莊、我所消磨我童年、我一部分靑春時代的村莊、我所初識戀愛的村莊是曾經呌做科耐托、塔幾尼亞、倘如我閉上了我的眼睛、我第一個回憶就是那所故屋、那屋子的四週是一座花園、在那花園的角落裏是············木蘭花、」個人的回憶常是文學中最美妙的題材、尤其在意大利文學中、書是這樣開頭的、讀者一定有把握、這書是値得一讀的、因爲一個意大利作家當他懷念到他故鄕的城鎭或他童年時代的家的時候、總常常寫出他最好的東西來的、</p>
<p>這木書多半是描寫科耐托、它是在一座位于麥萊普地的山上、我們在這書中可以如畫的看到這村的四周的光赤灰濛的景色、悅人視線的圾上、花園樹木之參差、村中聖安東尼節日的熱閙丨丨有看騾子比賽、我們還可以聽得它唯一的歌曲底凄凉的單調、我們更悅似目覩每年每季有許多闖入者到這科耐托來、丨有了穿藍衣的收穗人、阿幾侖的掘土的和收拾淸潔的人、有七月中來的收穫的人、于是有燒炭的人、最後是牧人、有二幅非常美妙的畫像、一是一羣遊蕩的工人的經理、阿爾生特龍、一個矮小、自負的人、一是衰敗的地主、勒戴幾尼亞、全地方上的忠心的伴侣、和講述故事的人、在這種地方、并在他父親所開的車站點心店的故事中、或在索爾阿都塞提搿那諾地的老石匠之畫像裏、卡爾達萊利給與我們那眞的、永久的意大利、那是多半的外國人永不看到、或者、就是他們觀到、也要忘記的意大利、這一本書曾經在一九三○年被頒給過、Prencio　Bogutta的奬金、</p>
<p>第二本是加洛典（Di　Alberto　Cacocci）的「Il　Pardiso　Perduto、」當加氏冩得最簡樸而不舖張揚厲的時候就是他寫得最好的時候、譬如、怎樣好、他描寫他童年時候的一個六月的黃昏、其時夜飯吃好了、他的一家人都坐在花園裏談着一天來的家事、在他不可避免的「回家」之喚起中、有一些過于舖張的痕跡、但婢女琪夏凡娜、佛萊賽斯卡和她瘋狂的叔叔之畫像是以極强的鮮活描繪了的、最後的一章是一段大戰中軍官們和女郎們的回憶、那又是另一種典型意大利的、</p>
<p>第三本是彭桑提（Di　AlbessandroBonsanti）的小說集La　Serue　Amorasa」是叙述上一世紀開頭的時候、其時、在弗洛侖斯依舊有一個大公爵、其時、給貴族的兒子敎英文的家庭敎師總必然地痛駡拜倫、故事是或則禽山林盜賊的生活、或則寫良家子弟的經歷、雖然有一些拖黏的味道、然而近來很少意大利小說讀來有像這本樣令人愉快的、因爲彭桑提用了一種流利、不做作、但却永不平凡無味的文體、是有一種非常的能同來喚起情景、表現個性的書中他描寫二處山賊友誼的會晤、一家弗洛侖斯貴族的生活是同樣的好、他表達那種我們許稱做四輪馬車時代正幅的人生之圖畫、有一種英國小說家舒徐悠閒之風、</p>
<p>第四本是加達（Di　Piero　Godpa）的「Mozzo」這本不見以前獲得Fiere　Letteraria奬的可愛簡短的小說、是寫一個生在辣欠羅和斯欠齊亞間、一條多隧道的鐵路邊上之小屋中的小孩底故事、從辣欠羅和卜爾都費諾來的遊歷的人很少深入這種所謂「五村」的荒野但都可愛的地方的、那裏的人尼或以航海捕魚爲生、或以裁種葡萄爲生、這本書裏加達是安置了他自己對於這一帶列搿侖海岸所抱的深深的愛的、</p>
<p>莫善是這書的主人公、是一個鐵路上掌理制火車動機的兒子、他的特别戀慕着海、縱然他守寡的母親種種操心也無改他的對於海之愛好、他母親送他到鄕間一個親戚、牧師那裏去受敎、是無效、送他去做理髮師的徒弟也無效、海是不可抵拒地呌喚他、這首牧歌的調子是一種歡快的簡樸底調子、是以生動的鮮明描現出了一個意大利孩子的果敢精神、尤其在日描寫莫善同了　另外幾個孩子划莫差的母親、她的嬰孩和一家的東西從岡束尼辣到披埃夫去的一章最爲出色、一陣風起、他們不能夠繞過岩石岬、於是冒了險進入一個小小的海灣、在那裏他們上了岸、同了一些採石匠度過一夜。在全個海行中莫善是以一種敏感當了指揮的人、</p>
<p>第五本是珂爾伐羅（Di　Corrado　Alvaro）的小說集「L'Dmata　Alla　Finestsa」</p>
<p>這是部大都追憶卡拉勃列亞地燃燒去了的風景和族長的（Ｐatrlarc）温厚誠樸的小說、尤以第一篇爲最好、那是描寫一個畫家畫了一個農家姑娘的肖像而因此所生在她身上的影響這麽一回事、畫家的畫畫成了、他就不睬一眼的去了、那個姑娘却沉醉於他而爲之凄凉悲愁、作書描寫此點生動有色、</p>
<p>第六本是斯都伯列許（Di　Giani　Stuparich）的小說集（Racconti」這部小說集以最後一篇爲最佳、是一篇一個失敗的一生之精細的研究、一個脫列斯脫商人、死於癌症的安東尼、列浮的一生於當他死時、他才恍然悟到他的没有了解過任何一些什麽、即是他自己的妻子的心理他也從没有了解過、</p>
<h3>最近法國文壇</h3>
<p>— 从仌</p>
<p>奥爾茀萊·約里佛（Ａlfred　Ｊolivet）</p>
<p>是巴黎大學的斯干地那維亞文學和語言的敎授、他得到那本從未印行的斯德林堡的書信、就把這本書信全然應用於他的關於「斯德林堡的戲劇」的書中、在最近年來出版的研究北歐文學的書中、這本書的確要算是包羅最廣、最重要的一本了、約氏雖是個大學敎授、可是他這本書却並不是那些寫給學生讀的什麽入門之類的書、也不是大學敎授常做的論文、他這本書在各方面看來都可說是一本最新的斯德林堡的傳記、他深入這位瑞典的偉大作家的心靈上的迷宫之深處、在這迷宫中、他小心而堅忍地循途而進、有時也有直覺的見解和應有的嚴肅、他的許多發見中、有一個最足使我們注意、他說斯德林堡的腦子是女性的、這就是說斯氏没有外國的徼動或外界的搖震來促他、是不會寫作品的、斯氏寫作要個「原動力」、而這種「原動力」又常從法國文學中找出來的、這樣話不是很値得我們注决的嗎、所以約里佛筆下的斯德林堡樈給約氏以國際的批評家的地位、</p>

<p>格勞薩叢書「世界漫游」（Le　Tourdu　Monde）。中有三本是保爾·穆杭作的、三本是克勞特·恩納的、二本是安得列·馬羅的、三本是亞郎·日包爾的、這些書都並不比　克·特·拉克萊退的「半神或希臘航程」（Deml　Dieu,　ou　le　VoyageenGrece）更好、</p>
<p>○　　○</p>
<p>馬賽爾·亞美曾出過La　Table　auxCreves　Brulebois爾書、近來又出了一本Un　Varien、可惜現在這一本却反不及前兩本、這本書只是給神學家看的、裏面滿是愚笨的殘酷和粗劣的東西、</p>

<p>愛瀰爾·恩華是時報的文學新聞編輯、又是個有相當名望的小說家、幾年前、他的Aricie　Burn　曾得到法國學院小說奬金、近來他出了一本、「失去了的機會」（Occasions　Perdues）、這是一篇巴雷</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>（Ｂarre'o）的門徒的那些法國靑年的故事、他們這些人是被戰爭所滅絕的、他們都很磊落不覊、思想深遠、又有些浪漫的、反對他們父董的那種安逸的快樂主義、可是他們於潛伺着在等比他們的年幼輕的人的那些野蠻的爭鬥（無論是道德的或是物質的）都無所預備、生於八十年代末年、與九十年代開始時的流產兒、便和他們同歸於盡了、「損去了的機會」這本書、即使没有作文件的價値、單就牠裏面的兩個女主角約翰·海萊司Jeanne　Heylesse）和推雷司·奥皮爾（Theuese　Aubier）</p>
<p>也已有存在的價値了</p>
<p>○　　○</p>
<p>大家聽到過雷納·彭極門的「巴雷與霞飛」（Berres　et　Joffre）嗎、在霞飛的身前死後已出了許多關於他的書了、我們總以爲不會再有這一種書出版的、可是現在彭極門的簡潔健勁的一篇「將軍的七篇演講」出來了、這篇東西雖只短短的四十多頁、却呌其餘那些「霞飛伯伯」的摘錄退避三舍哩、還有一篇「巴雷論」、篇幅較長、但極其生動美妙、彭極門的筆下出來的東西原是很不錯的、</p>
<p>○　　○</p>
<p>安特萊·拉文宋的「陀斯托衣夫斯基的傷心史」一書、頗能引人注意的、因爲裏面的許多至今尙未譯成法文的亲的俄國文件、尤其是莫斯科的國家版本裏的二卷「書信」、</p>

<p>與八月間在巴黎開的殖民展覽會有關係的書中我們可以提出一本比愛爾·米爾的Les　Fils　de　L'Ombre　et　Soliel這書剛由費爾門·提多出版、比愛爾·米爾是法國的殖民文學的首創者、他是法國的吉卜林、並下在某種意義上說來、也是法國的迭更斯、因爲就是側面影和諷剌畫一經他帶到一筆便會各具他們自己的生命的、</p>
<h3>最近上海的音樂會</h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>以前在上海南京路市政廳内、每星期由工部局管絃樂隊舉行交響樂會、自本年冬季起、改假座卡爾登影戲院内奏演、時間爲每星期夜九時起、至十一時止本年份已開過七次樂會、我們雖不知道在這一個音樂季内、除了最近在新光大戲院海飛次的個人提琴獨奏會外、還有什麽可以突破記錄的驚人奏演、但在我個人、對於上一個星期日的音樂會節目却表示很滿意而且得着很好的印像、</p>
<p>我們對於支配那一次音樂會節目兼指揮的哀利熱Kryger先生、和鋼琴師斐利倫　Berliulin先生、都應該表示慶祝他們的成功、</p>
<p>從這一次音樂會上、我們可以說是聽到了音樂、眞正聽到了正式的音樂、我們陶醉於這許多美麗的樂曲中、從貝利奥Berltoz的「羅馬歡舞節」起、一直到查意柯夫斯基Tcchaikowsky的「Ｂ短調司伴曲」止、都能使聽衆的靈魂隨了那管弦樂的奏演、昇華到音樂的天國裏去、</p>
<p>莫查德的「小玩意兒」、眞是一首絕好的傑作、指揮長克利熱先生的確了解原作的精神、他很細心地指揮着一羣樂師、把原曲的趣充分表現出來、而且能夠捉住原作的要點和分析各種細纖的地方、眞是難能可貴、得到了一個很光榮的成功、</p>
<p>至於葛里格的「貝爾琴德組曲」是一首很普遍的作品、在音樂會中好像是家常便飯一樣、不用我再來饒舌了、</p>
<p>斐利倫先生决不是一個尋常的鋼琴名手、他是一個有修養的藝術家、他奏演查意柯夫基的「口伴曲」、便可以當做一種有力的保證、我們希望他的進步無彊、能保持他在藝術上的成功和光榮、</p>
<p>第六次交響樂會</p>
<p>在這一次音樂夜樂會中、最使全會生色的、是于司登Ullstein先生的Violoncelle的獨奏、他奏演聖霜Saint　Saens的「第一首司伴曲」、的確表現出了他的偉大天才、</p>
<p>許曼Ｓhumun的「曼弗蘭」、是一首世界名作、這是山嶺中的一個孤獨隱士的祈禱、一種凄絕憂鬰的音調、會使富於感傷性的聽客、泣下沾襟、</p>
<p>至於葛拉索諾夫Glozounov的「華爾資舞曲」、這是流行於逸園及其他幾家高尙的跳舞塲中的作品、現在居然會在正式的音樂會塲重新聽見、也可以算是一種創見、一般的聚衆、對於這一首流行的舞曲、都表示滿意、他們一再熱烈的鼓掌、但我不知道他們是眞正了解藝術而表示欣賞呢、還是只爲了要表示好感於樂台上的指揮Foa先生和一切的樂師、</p>
<p>在下半段的節目中、有孟擅爾霜、Mendelssohn的「第四首交響曲」、指揮者雖很賣力、但是並不見得有什麽特殊的精彩、而且有許多可以訾議的地方、但在大體上、這一的音樂會、却給我們以相當的滿足、</p>
<p>第七次交響樂會</p>
<p>本年音樂季的第七次交響樂會、純粹是意大利的音樂會、歌唱者爲意大利女人、指揮者爲意大利人、在座的聽衆、大半也都是意大利的旅滬僑民、</p>
<p>費拉麗Ferrari女士的歌唱、是這一夜音樂會中最有精彩的一種表演、她唱的歌曲、都是歌劇中的名作、如「濕郎」「波希米亞人」「蝴蝶夫人」等的咏嘆曲和短歌等、我們對於這一位女藝術家的藝術、只有表示頂禮、不過覺得她的嗓子似欠柔和、有許假借嬌揉的地方、她唱到尖銳的歌句、竟有些剌戟耳官、但大體上、她不失爲第一流的名歌家、</p>
<p>羅西尼Rossini的「從意大利出版序曲」、仍舊像老樣地得到很好的成功、</p>
<p>上半段節目完後、休息片刻、接着便奏演費笪弟尼Vittadini的「夜之諧和」和聖多利基陶Santoliguido的「水彩畫」、</p>
<p>「夜之諧和」在上海還是初次公開奏演、表現着自然界的種種籟聲、非常逼眞、但這不像是意大利的作品却彷彿出於德國音樂家的手筆、</p>
<p>指揮長意大利樂師Ros先生、這一夜好像有些疲倦的樣子、他很能守盡職務、一般的聽客、尤其是意大的僑民、都表示滿意而散、</p>
<p>在最近一個星期内、還有幾個値得我們注意的音樂會、第一個是世界提琴名家哈飛次的獨奏會、其次是中國國立音樂院的音樂會、可惜我私人因爲有病、纒綿醫院多日、不能出席傾聽、所以也無法表示我的感想、我只能報告三次過去的交響樂會一些印像、至於我個人錯過了海飛次提琴獨奏會、至今猶引爲一件莫大損失、希望聽過這一位世界名樂家奏演的人、能夠寫一些報告給我們、</p>

<p>Rushing to Draft New Resolution</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Pressing Forward</p>
<p>Demanding Provisions for Freedom of Action to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Retreating Step by Step</p>
<p>No Longer Insisting on Clearly Defined Withdrawal Deadline</p>
<p>(Paris) Last night, the statements issued by the Chinese and Japanese representatives indicated that the East Three Provinces incident has the possibility of an early resolution based on the resolution to be adopted by the Council. Therefore, people in the League of Nations are again optimistic, and it is expected that the Council will unanimously pass a resolution soon, stipulating the continuous withdrawal of Japanese troops and the dispatch of a neutral investigation team to investigate the case. It is expected that a public meeting will be held on Wednesday or Thursday, and the drafting committee will spend the whole day on Tuesday drafting a new resolution. The secret meeting of the twelve councilors is also planned to be suspended in order to complete the resolution as soon as possible. Subsequently, the Chinese delegation issued a statement late at night, stating that if there is a confirmed report of the withdrawal of Japanese troops heading towards Jinzhou, China, under this circumstance, will be prepared to agree with the majority of the Council's current resolution not to specifically stipulate a deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. The Japanese representative Ito also issued a statement stating that Japan is prepared to accept the draft resolution of the Council, only requiring that the proposal contains preventive clauses, allowing the Japanese army to defend themselves against bandits and lawbreakers. The Council's Drafting Committee reopened its meeting at 4:15 pm today to hear Ito's statement on the amendments proposed by Japan. Although the Committee advised Japan to abandon the bandit suppression clause on Sunday, the Committee received a letter from the Japanese representative again this afternoon, reiterating this request and sending Ito to the meeting to state the reasons, insisting that the Japanese commanding officer has the right to take military action out of security necessity. Before the Drafting Committee meeting, the Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji visited Briand and it was heard that the conversation was about the talk between the French Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara. After the Drafting Committee adjourned, the twelve councilors held a secret meeting at 5:40 pm and adjourned at 6:50 pm to discuss the progress made by the Drafting Committee in drafting the resolution. Today, the League of Nations Secretariat also received a report from the neutral observers in the East Three Provinces, stating that the Japanese army has withdrawn to the east of the Liao River. Currently, people in the League of Nations are very hopeful about the future, believing that Honjo will be able to stop military action so that the Council can proceed with its resolution. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations spent most of today discussing the "bandit" issue. What is "bandit" is the difficulty at the moment. Japan is demanding freedom of action to suppress bandits in Manchuria. The Drafting Committee of the proposal has not yet been able to find a plan that can satisfy this request and maintain the principles of the charter. What is of concern is that if there is a provision for freedom of action in the proposal, it will become a dangerous precedent in international law, because people will see that whoever is regarded as a bandit by anyone can be allowed to be suppressed, not only in the Far East. The Drafting Committee and Ito, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Paris, met for more than an hour this morning to discuss this matter, and met again in the afternoon to consider Japan's new memorandum. The Administrative Council then convened at 5:15 pm to hear the Drafting Committee's report on the progress of its work, and adjourned at 6:30 pm. It is heard that a counter-proposal will be submitted to the Japanese government tonight or tomorrow morning. The Japanese representative's new memorandum clearly explains Japan's position on the investigation team's affairs and Japan's freedom of action to suppress bandits in Manchuria. Last night, Ito submitted a translation of the instructions on the draft from Tokyo to Briand. This document insists that the Japanese have the right to freedom of action to suppress bandits. What cannot be resolved now is this problem. The Drafting Committee will meet again tomorrow, when it may be decided to mention this matter in the introduction of the proposal to overcome this difficulty. In addition, there is nothing else that can seriously hinder the drafting of a proposal that can be accepted by all parties. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The communique issued by the Chinese representative today has simply resolved the difficulty caused by China's demand for a deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. It is said that if the neutral foreigners who are actually inspecting confirm the withdrawal of Japanese troops within Jinzhou and no new incidents occur, China can accept the administrative council's proposal without insisting on a deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops in Manchuria. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, Shi Zhaoji and Briand discussed the establishment of a neutral zone. Yesterday, Yoshizawa and Briand met and told Briand the news from Tokyo, saying that if China obtains a guarantee from the League of Nations, it will not require the assistance of neutral country observers, but will allow the troops to withdraw to the south of the Great Wall. According to Gu Weijun, the so-called League of Nations guarantee only requires Japan to sign an agreement acknowledging that each will not violate the neutral zone, which is sufficient. What is the actual situation of this matter has been transferred to the Chinese representative by Briand. The general impression is still good. According to observers, the difficulties caused by the Japanese side, (1) the police duties in the neutral zone, (2) the mission of international observers, will be circumvented by the following methods, that is, the Chinese and Japanese troops will withdraw at the same time, the Japanese army will withdraw to Shenyang, and the Chinese army will withdraw to the south of the Great Wall, leaving a large area between them. This area is not a so-called neutral zone, but becomes a "non-garrison zone", so there is no way for conflicts to occur, and observers do not need to be present. As for the local police, local groups and militias can perform their duties. Regarding the final resolution, the general impression is still good, but it is too early to say that China has decided to accept it. China still wants to discuss certain clauses. What it pays most attention to is how the mission of the investigation team is stipulated. China intends to ask it to judge the security issue and decide on the withdrawal of Japanese troops, but Marquis Ito said in the Drafting Committee that bandits will run rampant in the neutral zone, and that it is also necessary to suppress bandits elsewhere. Therefore, Japan is requesting a broad clause in the final resolution regarding bandit suppression. Several representatives of major powers intend to study this proposal, but representatives of small countries believe that this is an important principled issue. If Japan insists on not giving in, they will inevitably raise serious protests. After Ito left the meeting, the Drafting Committee wanted to delete a sentence from the resolution, which caused a fierce and long debate. This continued until the meeting of the twelve committees. This sentence is "The Administrative Yuan believes that the withdrawal of troops is extremely important." Some representatives believe that this sentence is a kind of legal comment, and there is no room for it to be added to the clauses for the purpose of making a decision. As a result, this sentence was still deleted. The achievements made at this time may be considered very small by some people, but the Administrative Yuan has done a lot to limit the scope of discussion on some key points. The general opinion is that if the League of Nations can do the following, it has done its best, as for the maximum extent, (1) create a "non-garrison zone" in southern Manchuria so that the occupied land will not expand, (2) send an investigation team to establish international supervision and gradually withdraw Japanese troops.

<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Secretariat today published the report of the British Inspector on the Japanese army's retreat from Xinmin to Shenyang. This troop withdrawal was witnessed by the British official inspector and should satisfy the Chinese desire for the withdrawal of Japanese troops to be certified by neutral country inspectors. The British inspector also reported that although Tianjin temporarily returned to tranquility on November 26, traffic was disrupted. The Japanese military commander requested a cessation of hostilities. The Chinese replied that there were no hostile actions except for bandit prevention. The Japanese requested the fulfillment of the undertaking to withdraw the Chinese troops from Tianjin. The Chinese replied that the troops had been withdrawn. The Japanese requested that the security team be withdrawn to the north of Tianjin. The Chinese replied that this would cause trouble to recur and wish to have international troops manage the area. The Japanese requested to stop the mobilization of troops in Hebei Province. The Chinese denied that there was any action to advance troops into Tianjin. The Japanese requested to stop the anti-Japanese movement. The Chinese replied that they had already done so. The Chinese also denied the rumor that the 15th Brigade of Chinese troops had returned to Tianjin, etc. Another British inspector reported that on November 27, Ma Zhanshan had moved the Hei Province government from Qiqihar to Hailun and is now exercising its functions as usual. Japanese planes flew to Taian Town for reconnaissance, but did not drop bombs. The discussion of the draft proposal is expected to be completed today. The point of the Japanese request for freedom of action to suppress bandits is still to be resolved. As for the section on instructing the military commander to stop new actions, it has now been revised so as not to contain the meaning of infringing on the Emperor's prerogatives. The Chinese delegation has abandoned the issue of a deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. Only the wording of the scope of authority of the investigation committee and the methods of protecting Japanese residents are now under consideration, but this issue must of course be handled with caution. The Drafting Committee seems to have invented a method to avoid extremely difficult points, advocating that Briand should explain these difficult events when submitting the proposal. This can avoid the need for unanimous agreement. Although a clause in the speech does not have the full power of a resolution, it can be regarded as the opinion of the Administrative Council. The status of Jinzhou is still under discussion, but Reuters learned from the highest level that there has been no sacrifice of abolishing neutral country inspectors or neutral zones.

<p>According to telephone reports, 350 Japanese soldiers, 15 officers, each carrying full armament, and 5 steel cannons, 3 machine guns, and 1,500 boxes of military supplies, were transported by the Anzen Maru, Hijiyama Maru, and Koka Maru. The warship Asagao escorted them from Tanggu at 4:00 am and arrived at the British concession wharf at 8:30 am. Under the strict guard of Japanese soldiers, the military supplies were unloaded. The French Engineering Bureau did not receive notification and did not allow passage. After negotiations by the Japanese military, passage was granted. The Japanese soldiers marched in formation on foot. Japanese residents welcomed them with flags on Asahi Street. The Reservists Association held a meeting at the Public Hall to welcome them. Finally, they marched in formation to demonstrate in the Japanese Concession. All the military supplies were transported to the Japanese barracks in 25 cars and 10 carriages. The cars transporting military supplies rushed forward regardless of everything, causing the Ford Company's No. 291 car to be wrecked. The British police intervened, but the Japanese soldiers refused to comply, placing the car across the road, blocking traffic. Then, the British from the British Engineering Bureau arrived and forced the Japanese officer to sign to acknowledge the wrecked car before releasing them. At 9:30 am, a motorboat also arrived from Tanggu, carrying 2 machine guns and 1 steel cannon, which were unloaded at the Japanese concession wharf. The Asagao went to Gegu, but returned to Tanggu at noon due to shallow water. More than 300 Japanese soldiers will arrive successively. Residents in the Chinese district are still crowding into the concessions to move in. White-plate trams can run on West and North Ma Road. South and East Ma Road are not dared to run because the Japanese soldiers have not withdrawn from the southeast corner. Red, yellow, and blue plates only run in the French and Italian Concessions in Special Zone Two and Three of the Chinese district. Trams are not allowed to pass through the Japanese Concession (Japanese Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Chinese merchants in the Japanese concession were forced to hang Japanese flags on the 1st to celebrate the victory of the Japanese army.

<h3>Japanese Army Stationed in Liaoning Advances North</h3>
<p>Japanese Sources Say Ma's Troops Will Counterattack</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese sources say that Ma Zhanshan led 3,000 troops to advance from Keshan and Hailun towards Qiqihar again. The Japanese army stationed in Liaoning is advancing north and will arrive in Qi on the 2nd to engage in a fierce battle with Ma and Zou. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Today, Honjo's headquarters claimed that the situation in Qiqihar is developing unfavorably for the Japanese army. A certain general of Ma Zhanshan is now leading 3,000 soldiers from Hailun to attack Qiqihar, with the aim of driving out the small number of Japanese troops remaining in Hei City. Honjo has therefore instructed reinforcements to advance from a certain location that has not yet been announced to Hei City today to cope with this crisis. The Beining Railway is still peaceful, but the Japanese military headquarters is still citing the concentration of Chinese troops at Dahu Mountain. The headquarters said that the Japanese troops have completely retreated to the east bank of the Liao River, but according to reliable private sources, Japanese troops were still stationed at the Raoyang River yesterday afternoon. Japanese reconnaissance planes reported to the headquarters that 14 trains went from Jinzhou to Dahu Mountain yesterday, and 7 trains went to the same location on Sunday. The Japanese military headquarters therefore believes that the trains are full of Chinese troops. In fact, according to the reconnaissance plane's report, no one was seen getting off the train, which shows that these were empty cars prepared to load troops out of the neutral zone.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Anxiety Amidst Confusion</h3>
<p>Yesterday's commentary already pointed out the confusing and bewildering state of the current international situation. It also pointed out that in this confusing and bewildering situation, our country has reached a new and critical juncture. We urged our countrymen to pay close attention to it. After comprehensively analyzing and inferring from the current facts in various aspects, we believe that this confusing situation is increasingly advancing toward a serious future. At the same time, groping under this confusing situation, we feel a great deal of doubt and fear.</p>
<p>Internationally, there is talk of establishing a neutral zone to prevent Japan's continued westward advance and to ease the tension between China and Japan, thereby withdrawing from the situation as soon as possible. However, if the Japanese army does not go beyond Jinzhou and continues westward, the Northeast problem can be left to direct negotiations between China and Japan. This situation can be seen in the Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 30th, stating that the US government believes that the resolution of the Manchurian issue still depends on direct negotiations between China and Japan, as well as Briand's reply to Yoshizawa, stating that extraordinary measures such as sending an investigation team and establishing a neutral zone should not hinder the larger proposals that the Japanese government wants to make to the Chinese government. Moreover, this proposal does not constitute interference from a third party. Since Japan forcibly occupied our Northeast, it believes this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is arrogant and unsatisfied, and wants to extend its control, passing through Shanhaiguan and extending into northern China. However, at the same time, it cannot completely ignore the current international situation. Therefore, its attitude is extremely contradictory, fully exposing the duality of its diplomacy. Sometimes it expresses moderation and withdraws part of its troops. At other times, it suddenly becomes tough, even advocating the establishment of a neutral zone in Hebei, denying the authority of Chinese and Japanese inspectors, and insisting that Chinese troops must withdraw to within the customs, demanding that the Japanese army take so-called anti-bandit military actions in the areas where Chinese troops withdraw. These facts are nothing more than attempts to fatigue international sentiment with a volatile attitude, while also observing the international situation. In addition to occupying the Northeast, it threatens our country to advance its forces westward into northern China, and consolidate the foundation for its second-stage continental policy. This situation is also extremely clear.</p>
<p>We believe that no matter what, today's international mediation and the changes in Japan's attitude are absolutely not in our interest. We try to look back since the League of Nations assembly. Japan has taken the lead at every step, without any scruples. For any claim it makes, the League of Nations always tries to comply. Our country, on the other hand, has failed and retreated at every step. For any appeal we make, the League of Nations turns a deaf ear. The establishment of this neutral zone today may be the confirmation that the Northeast will change hands from now on. The so-called investigation is just a means to step down and deceive the world.</p>
<p>What we are deeply confused and worried about today is how our country should respond to this serious situation. The neutral zone was proposed by us and accepted by the League of Nations. In the near future, it may become a reality. The westward advance of the Japanese army may also be prevented by this buffer zone. But what about the problem east of Jinzhou? Will the establishment of a neutral zone be a means to solve the Northeast problem? Or is it intended to prevent the westward advance of the Japanese army? According to the Havas news agency from Paris on the 30th, it is said that most people believe that the Chinese representatives will eventually agree to the draft resolution, because the troop withdrawal issue was originally the biggest difficulty. It is no longer very important at this point, and what everyone is paying attention to now is the establishment of a neutral zone near the Great Wall. Is that true or not? Is the proposal to withdraw Japanese troops from the Northeast to be abandoned? This is one of the things we are deeply confused and worried about.</p>
<p>Shigemitsu Mamoru arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 30th to discuss the Manchurian neutral zone issue with Foreign Minister Gu. According to Reuters, Tokyo hopes that this discussion can open the way for direct negotiations between China and Japan on the Manchurian issue. At the same time, in Beiping, Japanese representatives have been directly communicating with Zhang Xueliang. Political circles in Tokyo are very optimistic about the future of the overall situation, believing that there will be great progress soon. Does the manifestation of these facts mean that our government is prepared for direct negotiations? Or is it for other diplomatic contacts? If it is prepared for direct negotiations, what is the negotiation strategy? What is the purpose of the negotiations? Will we insist on recovering the lost land? Will we resolutely reject any new conditions or new demands? This is the second thing we are deeply confused and worried about.</p>
<p>We believe that the current confusing situation is enough to make our countrymen imperceptibly fall into an extremely dangerous and tragic situation. It is also enough to make our country fall into a dangerous and tragic situation from which it cannot extricate itself. New bad news and new unfortunate events may suddenly appear under this confusing situation. We are truly filled with anxiety and fear about this.</p>

<h3>Conflicting Japanese Military Intelligence</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Since the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, the Japanese army commander Honjo has met with reporters twice. His spokesman, Major Watanabe, provided official information regarding the situation on the various fronts. However, this information should of course be listened to with caution and needs to be further verified. The investigator who went to Qiqihar to visit Commander Domen has now returned to Shenyang. The reason why the official communique from Shenyang needs to be verified is becoming increasingly clear. Arranging and comparing the news released by the Japanese officials in Shenyang and Heihe will be very interesting reading.</p>
<h3>From Commander Honjo's Side</h3>
<p>On November 22nd, he stated that 31 Japanese soldiers were killed and 104 were wounded.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese soldiers killed, based on the bodies found on the battlefield, is about 600. In the Angxi battle, there were 3,500 Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>On the morning of November 18th, when the first line of Chinese defense had not been broken, the fighting was very fierce.</p>
<p>On the evening of November 18th, the Qiqihar station on the Chinese Eastern Railway was occupied. Honjo repeatedly said that Ma Zhanshan must have received Russian assistance. At least five people heard the investigator say this.</p>
<p>On the 24th, he stated that he had not heard of the withdrawal of troops from Qiqihar. A Japanese soldier named Yamada was detained and tortured by Chinese people, and then secretly released by a Korean prison officer.</p>
<h3>From Commander Domen's Side</h3>
<p>On November 20th, he stated that 51 Japanese soldiers were killed and over 200 were wounded.</p>
<p>Approximately 200 Chinese soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>In the Angxi battle, there were 5,000 Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>The first line of Chinese defense was easily broken. The fierce fighting was north of the Chinese Eastern Railway, on the night of November 18th.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers did not get close to the Qiqihar station. Japanese soldiers crossed the Chinese Eastern Railway line 4 kilometers east of the station.</p>
<p>The Russians did not assist Ma.</p>
<p>On the 20th, he stated that he was ordered to withdraw a regiment of infantry and an artillery unit to Taonan or Changchun when the railway was repaired.</p>
<p>Yamada was released by the Chinese and returned safely, with no mention of torture. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Source of Ma's Arms and Ammunition</h3>
<p>Japanese Smuggling Agency Uncovered</p>
<p>The Theory of Soviet Assistance Appears Unfounded</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Russian official TASS news agency received a telegram from Beiping, mentioning that the Japanese were privately transporting military supplies to Ma Zhanshan. According to recent news, many people have been arrested in Dalian and Shenyang, mostly Japanese employees of government or semi-government agencies. Among them are an American and several Poles and Lithuanians. This case is currently under investigation, but the investigation is being conducted in great secrecy because it has been discovered that important Japanese officials in Manchuria and personnel from other countries are backing this smuggling agency. It is rumored that three train cars of military supplies were transported from Dalian to Qiqihar, but were detained by the Chinese police in Shenyang. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The mystery of the source of Ma Zhanshan's military supplies now seems to be coming to light. For weeks, people have been accusing the Soviet Union of supplying military supplies to the Chinese army in northern Manchuria to resist the Japanese. The Russian Foreign Minister has formally and firmly denied this. The Japanese government has also stated that officials have never claimed that Russia secretly aided the Chinese army. However, the commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria, Honjo, has repeatedly told reporters that Ma Zhanshan must have received Soviet assistance. Today, it has been learned that the people who are supplying military supplies to the Chinese army in northern Manchuria to resist the Japanese are the Japanese themselves. The Japanese newspapers published in Dalian, Dalian News and Manchuria Daily, both carried the following news. It is said that the Japanese police in Shenyang detained a box of military supplies at the Shenyang station. After a preliminary investigation, it was discovered that the company that transported the box of military supplies was a certain transportation company in Dalian, and other transportation companies, Dalian customs officials, and Chinese and foreign employees of the South Manchuria Railway Bureau were all involved in this case. These military supplies were being transported to Harbin for use by the Chinese army and bandits. This is what the Japanese newspapers reported. It has been discovered that the so-called most involved company is a famous Japanese company, whose head office is located in Dalian. Two days later, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun carried a telegram from a special investigator in Dalian, which read: "The Dalian police have discovered that someone is privately smuggling military supplies to northern Manchuria with the assistance of customs officials and employees of a certain large company. The businesses engaged in this private smuggling of military supplies include Japanese, Chinese, and foreigners. Therefore, the police stations in Manchuria have launched a joint operation to search for the criminals. On November 18th, the Dalian police arrested two customs officials, several employees of a certain company, and several others, who are all under investigation." After this case was announced by the Japanese newspapers, there has been no further news to date. It is suspected that news about this case has been withheld by military censors. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons</h3>
<p>Discusses the Situation in Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>London British Foreign Secretary Simon made a lengthy speech in the House of Commons today, discussing the situation in Manchuria and how to protect the interests of British and Japanese creditors of the Beining Railway. Simon stated that the League of Nations Council is continuing its efforts, hoping to find a solution to the Manchurian problem. The joint efforts of the Council are expected to be successful. The revenue of the Beining Railway has decreased significantly due to recent events. Negotiations on this matter are currently underway. Changes in the administrative structure of Shenyang have made it difficult to transfer funds owed to British interests, and payments for goods purchased from British companies by the Railway Bureau have also been delayed. According to reports from the British side, there have been no battles between China and Japan in the past ten days. Newspapers are now carrying news that the Japanese army is currently retreating into the South Manchuria Railway area, but officials have not yet received reports confirming this statement. Labor Party member Wedgwood Benn stated that the UK's top priority is to avoid the constraints of sanctions and other similar forms of war. The Foreign Secretary replied that the British government is very eager to avoid the use of sanctions in any dispute handled by the League of Nations and, therefore, is focused on seeking a peaceful solution with other members of the Council. This principle is the foundation of the League of Nations charter, and the mechanisms in the charter for taking collective action are also based on this. Liberal Party member Mayson stated, "Japan is disregarding Articles 12, 13, and 15 of the charter. What steps will the British government take on this matter? Please announce them." The Foreign Secretary replied, only stating that the League of Nations is currently handling this issue. Under the current circumstances, it is best to let the Council deliberate on the matter. He also stated that the legitimate demands of British creditors of the Chinese government, arising from overdue payments of principal and interest on railway loans, will be raised when the time is right.

<p>Stimson Unwilling to Talk Much About the Situation in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Stimson, in light of the fact that the previous dissemination of mild criticism had angered the Japanese, was unwilling to discuss the Manchurian situation at all when he met with reporters today. He merely stated that he believed he had said enough about the tense situation between China and Japan and that there was no need to say more. On the Japanese side, after Stimson denied criticizing the Japanese government's remarks, it declared to the US government that the previous declaration criticizing Stimson was issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry but had not been approved by Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara. The Japanese ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, specially went to the State Department today to solemnly declare this intention to Stimson. Therefore, now that Stimson's remarks have been denied and the Japanese side's declaration has been withdrawn, the two countries have reconciled. (National News Agency, 30th)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Reply to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Party Congress</p>
<p>Hailun Ma Zhanshan's reply to the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou reads, "I have just received your telegram, and I am deeply grateful for your compliments. This time, the violent Japanese are relying on their strength to be fierce and brutal, trampling on our country, disregarding the great powers, and disregarding peace treaties and international integrity. They are truly the common enemy of mankind and an obstacle to peace. However, things must rot before worms grow, and a country must defeat itself before others defeat it. Since those ambitious people have been eyeing Jiang province, envoys from friendly countries have been inspecting us one after another. Those who earnestly express goodwill towards us all feel that it is a pity that our national spirit has failed to unite and that it is difficult to achieve consistency in the face of events. The Congress is made up of the advanced members of the Party and the country, and I hope that you can address this weakness. If the Northeast is lost, the country will no longer be a country. I earnestly request that you actively find ways to eliminate party strife, awaken the people, and unite against foreign aggression, striving for the survival of the nation and the status of the country. The Party and the country may then have hope. Zhanshan is a mere military man who has pledged himself to the country. I do not know anything other than defense. However, because I am at the forefront and most deeply stimulated, I have received compliments from afar and offer my humble suggestions, hoping that you will consider them."

<h3>The Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>Must Have Troops Stationed by the Great Powers</p>
<p>Remarks from a Certain Important Diplomat</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomat said, "The neutral zone issue, as reported by Paris, is slightly different from the content of the government's instructions to Ambassador Shi. Originally, this proposal was proposed by the Chinese side in response to the urgent situation at the time. It is necessary for the countries to send troops to station in the neutral zone to impartially judge the right and wrong between China and Japan, and then it can be called a neutral term. In this way, the Chinese army can also reluctantly retreat. Now that the countries have refused to send troops to participate, the so-called neutral zone term is not applicable. Therefore, the government believes that if the countries do not send troops, the neutral term does not need to exist, and there is no talk of withdrawing troops from Jinzhou. At present, only the work of the observation group is being done. Negotiations on this observation group have been ongoing with the British, American, and French ambassadors in recent days. The three ambassadors believe that Japan needs to restrict the scope of observation. Therefore, the three governments have not yet given a definite answer to this proposal."

<h3>Central Principal</h3>
<p>Proclamation to Students</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiahua, President of Central University, today issued a proclamation to students, saying: There is more than one way to save the country. The government is responsible for strategic planning and decisive victories. Students should focus on their studies to prepare themselves with knowledge and achieve the best results in saving the country through academic pursuits. If they abandon their studies, run around and shout slogans, regardless of the actual benefits, it would mean that thousands of promising young people each waste an hour of study, totaling over two thousand hours of knowledge that should have been acquired. This also means losing some basic strength in the work of saving the country. Moreover, our university is the highest institution of learning in the capital, and the words and actions of its students are observed by students across the country, with far-reaching influence related to the future of the nation. It is crucial to carefully consider these matters. As the president, my concern for the country is no less than anyone else's. However, while I commend the students' aspirations to save the country, their methods are not necessarily correct. Therefore, I issue this sincere proclamation, hoping that all students will work hard, strive for progress, and devote themselves to research. Adopt the spirit of perseverance, to achieve the best results in averting danger and stabilizing the situation. Do not waste time and abandon studies, hindering the fundamental strength needed to save the country. (One-day special dispatch)</p>

<h3>British-Indian Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Gandhi Strives for Independence</p>
<p>British Government Promises India Provisional Autonomy</p>
<p>Declaration to be Released Soon</p>
<p>London, 30th, National Telegram: At last night's meeting of the Second Indian Round Table Conference, Gandhi made a surprising speech. He demanded absolute independence for India, otherwise, he may have to continue his non-violent resistance movement. Sunday, as usual, was Gandhi's day of silence, so Gandhi did not speak until after midnight. Gandhi coughed severely while speaking, stopping frequently. Gandhi said, "What I want is complete independence for India. I want to exhaust my brain and blood to find a bright way to solve the problem, so that the millions of people in India will not suffer the pain of non-violent resistance again. But if even this is unavoidable, I will face it with a smile. Can you allow me to exchange this temporary truce for permanent peace?" Gandhi admitted that if Britain could give India true independence, he would be willing to make the necessary concessions. As for the minority issues among the ethnic groups in India, he said that there are ways to solve them. He did not express despair.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st: British Prime Minister MacDonald will submit a statement of the British government's policy on India to the Indian Round Table Conference today. The representatives attach great importance to this matter. Yesterday, they discussed it at St. James's Palace for more than fourteen hours, from 10:30 in the morning until 2:15 this morning, with only a short break in between. Chairman MacDonald rushed to a special cabinet meeting after 9 o'clock, which was convened specifically to consider MacDonald's statement. This morning, the newspapers predicted that the Prime Minister would announce the British government's policy, which is to allow India temporary autonomy and central responsibility, and suggest sending a parliamentary committee to India to work with the Indian committee compiling the Indian central constitution. It is said that Lord Sankey will be the chairman of the committee.</p>
<h3>Hungary</h3>
<p>Coup Plot Discovered</p>
<p>Related to Restoration Plan</p>
<p>Budapest, 30th, Havas Telegram: Recent reports in the newspapers stated that a conspiracy case was discovered in Budapest, Hungary. This matter has been officially announced to prove it is true. The conspiracy planned to disrupt order. The rebels seemed to have infiltrated the barracks and police stations with forged orders, intending to organize a dictatorial regime similar to the Soviet Union. The date of their uprising was delayed to November 21 for unknown reasons. However, as the authorities had already noticed, it was decided that the uprising must be launched by the 28th at the latest. The government took necessary measures and arrested the masterminds and other important party members on the 27th. The action was very swift, showing that the government still has the ability to maintain order. From the rebels' confessions, it was learned that this conspiracy did not receive the support of the people, and its members did not belong to any political party in the parliament. It was also discovered that the rebels had an executive committee, with 150 to 200 people assisting them, but they were completely unaware of the masterminds' plans.</p>
<p>Budapest, 30th, National Telegram: Last night, the authorities arrested many political prisoners, reportedly related to the discovered restoration conspiracy. Rumors said that the party members planned to make Archduke Otto king, and Archduke Otto was almost arrested as well. However, the authorities are still tight-lipped about this matter.</p>
<h3>Japan's Cash Continues to Flow Out</h3>
<p>Osaka, 1st, Reuters Telegram: Yokohama Specie Bank today</p>
<p>transported another 15 million yen worth of cash from Kobe to the United States. Since October 1st, Japan has transported a total of 29,650,000 yen worth of gold to the United States. It is now believed that today's shipment is the last batch. The Japanese magazine "Oriental Economist", known for opposing Finance Minister Inoue's policies, has repeatedly advocated re-imposing the gold export ban. However, the public believes that the newspaper is overly pessimistic about the actual situation of Japan's financial economy.</p>

<h3>Italy and Hungary Conclude Secret Air Force Pact</h3>
<p>Paris, 1st, National Telegram: This morning, the People's Daily reported that as a result of the recent visit of Italian Air Minister Balbo to Hungary, a secret air force pact between Italy and Hungary has been concluded. Although Hungary is restricted by treaties from establishing an air force, it is now planning to build a large airfield near Budapest, equipped with all the latest equipment, for the Italian Air Force to stay north of the Alps. Italy will bear the majority of the construction costs.</p>
<h3>Britain and France to Hold Economic Talks</h3>
<p>Paris, 1st, Reuters Telegram: Today, according to official sources, Britain and France will soon hold talks to reach an agreement on various economic issues. This announcement is rather vague, but the purpose of Finance Minister Flandin's visit to Britain can be guessed. When Flandin left Paris, he claimed to be going to Britain for hunting, but it is now known that Flandin stayed in London for several days and had very important political discussions. Flandin is still silent and neither denies nor admits that his trip had any political effect. This morning, a guest said that he did not discuss tax rates, but admitted that he had briefly discussed matters such as the stabilization of the pound, war debts, and reparations with British politicians. He also said that tax rate issues are purely within the purview of the Minister of Commerce, and he should not overstep his bounds. He was very happy to get to know British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, because France will soon have some important issues to resolve with him. It is evident that British and French views currently differ on war debts, debts, tax rates, and reparations. The public believes this is unfortunate and that it is in the best interests of both countries to strive for a better understanding.</p>
<h3>Disputes Over Japan's Tax Increase Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st, Electric Communication Telegram: Finance Minister Inoue submitted the tax increase plan yesterday afternoon, seeking the understanding of the party's top executives. Because the summer expenditure for Showa 7 is estimated at 1,479 million yen, while the revenue is only 1,307 million yen, there is a shortfall of 172 million yen. The proposed method of compensation is to increase taxes and raise debts, namely: (1) Business bonds of 67 million yen; (2) Tax increase of 40 million yen; Deficit-covering bonds of 65 million yen. In this way, the balance of income and expenditure can be expected.</p>
<p>Another telegram: Regarding the revenue compensation plan, party leaders all advocated revising tariffs and suspending tax increases. However, Inoue believed that the income from revising tariffs was uncertain and could not be regarded as a permanent source of revenue, expressing opposition. Only minor adjustments can be made to the item details of the building category.</p>
<p>Another telegram: Within the party, regarding the Finance Minister's tax increase plan, it is advocated to raise tariffs on wheat and other items to fill the deficit and suspend the tax increase plan. It is felt that the tax increase plan includes a tariff revision plan to reduce the burden on the people. If it is still insufficient, then it can be remedied by the debt reduction fund. The opinions of both sides are vastly different. Prime Minister Wakatsuki invited advisor Tomida Raimu yesterday morning to explain the unavoidable circumstances of raising debt and increasing taxes in the budget preparation, and said that he regretted the internal strife caused by raising debt. The government will refer to the opinions of the party and make partial revisions, but it still hopes to maintain the original plan of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Prime Minister to Turkey to Conclude New Treaty</h3>
<p>Sofia, 1st, National Telegram: Bulgarian Prime Minister Muravinov, along with members of parliament and officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, left for Istanbul this morning, at the invitation of the Turkish government. It is expected that during his stay in Istanbul, he will negotiate a border protection treaty with the Turkish government. It is also expected that a commercial treaty will be negotiated. This is the first time a Bulgarian Prime Minister has visited Turkey since the European War.</p>
<h3>London Gold and Silver Market Report</h3>
<p>London, 1st, National Telegram: Today, the London main clause closing price, recent period 19 pence 25, longer than yesterday 4375, forward period 19 and a half pence, longer than yesterday half a pence.</p>
<p>London, 1st, National Telegram: This afternoon, the London exchange rate against New York opened at three dollars and thirty-one cents.</p>
<p>London, 1st, National Telegram: Today, the London gold price opened at a new high price, 125 shillings per ounce of pure gold, an increase of 85 pence overnight.</p>
<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>Harbin Telegram: To all newspaper offices, Zhang Zhanshan is ordered to guard the Heihe, working diligently day and night, only obeying the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and Chairman Wan. When the Japanese army provoked incidents, Chairman Wan was unable to return to the province due to obstructed roads. Zhang Zhanshan was ordered to act as the Chairman of Jiang Province and lead his troops to defend the provincial city. The Deputy Commander-in-Chief also transferred the Xing'an reclamation army and other troops to bring them under regulation. Zhang Zhanshan obeyed the orders carefully, only striving to do his best and fulfill his duty to defend the territory. Unexpectedly, the enemy's flames grew daily, advancing steadily, and in a sudden, they reached Jiangqiao. For the sake of the country and the people, Zhang Zhanshan had no choice but to resort to legitimate defense. The reason why he has been able to fight for more than ten days and still stand his ground is due to the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief and the support of our allied forces, which Zhang Zhanshan alone could not have done. Since then, everything from defense and combat to supply and support has been planned and maintained by the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief. Zhang Zhanshan only obeyed and followed. The Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief knew the disparity in strength between the enemy and us, and all available support troops were mobilized one by one, without waiting for Zhang Zhanshan's request. Finally, due to exhaustion and lack of resources, mountains of corpses were left behind. I led the remaining troops to retreat, which is painful to say. I am grateful for the encouragement from wise men at home and abroad. Reflecting on myself, I am deeply ashamed. However, without the care and guidance of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief and the cooperation and support of the allied forces, even with the authority to confront the strong enemy for several days, I am afraid I would not have been able to do so. In the future, my actions will still be subject to the orders of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief. I am honored to receive attention. I dare to state my sincerity and hope that you will understand my sincerity and issue instructions from time to time. Ma Zhanshan stamped.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>The Situation in Jilin and Changchun Under the Iron Heel</p>
<p>Japanese Aggressively Expand Political and Economic Influence</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Since the Japanese army seized our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, their measures have been extremely brutal. A gentleman from Changchun recently arrived in Beijing and described the situation in Jilin and Changchun. He said that Jilin is now blockaded by the Japanese. Not only can news from within the province not be transmitted outwards, but information from the outside world cannot enter. A brief account of his words is as follows:</p>
<p>Blockading News: The only newspaper published in Changchun is the Datong Daily. It usually takes an anti-Japanese stance, and its attacks were especially fierce when the "Wan Incident" occurred. The Japanese hated it to the bone. This time, when the Japanese army entered the city, the head of the military police summoned the newspaper's manager, threatened him, and the manager was able to adapt and reverse his previous attitude, and was fortunately preserved. It is still published as usual, but manuscripts must be inspected before they can be printed. Every day, there are articles praising and extolling the Japanese, which is the same as the "Three Eastern Provinces People's Daily" in Shenyang, and are driven and exploited by the Japanese. In Jilin City, there is the "Jichang Daily," which is subsidized by Xi Qia and directed by the Japanese. Reporters stationed in Changchun from Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai were initially able to communicate occasionally, reporting the brutal acts of the Japanese army. However, later, due to the strict censorship of the post office, not only were the letters confiscated, but the military police even searched according to the addresses and gave serious warnings to the correspondents. In early November, Bai Xiaofeng, a correspondent for the Tianjin Yishi Daily, was arrested and taken away by the military police. After being severely beaten, he has not yet been released. All newspapers from Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai are detained by the Japanese army as soon as they arrive in Changchun. Dozens of newspaper deliverers have lost their jobs, and the import of news has also been cut off. Thus, the Japanese successfully blockaded the news.</p>
<p>Strengthening Military Preparations: Since the Nanling barracks were occupied by the Japanese army, they have invested 500,000 yuan to renovate them. The work was completed in early November. A regiment each of infantry and artillery are stationed there, and the remaining houses are rented to Japanese merchants to open restaurants. Police stations and Japanese military police substations have also been established, and the nearby streets have been renamed Nanling-cho and Itchome, Nichome, etc. All facilities are no different from the occupied land of the South Manchuria Railway. Moreover, in the area of ​​the Lijia Oil Mill, ten li northwest of Changchun City, 3,800 mu of civilian land were forcibly purchased to build an airfield and aircraft hangar, all of which have been completed. Twelve airplanes have been placed there, and the stored oil is sufficient for more than one hundred airplanes for one year. From the beginning of October, the Japanese barracks within the occupied land of the South Manchuria Railway have been constantly transporting whole train cars of military supplies from Lushun and Dalian. It is said that the ordnance stored in its underground warehouses is sufficient for 50,000 people to fight for five years, which is used to guard against the southward invasion of Russian forces in the North Manchuria region.</p>
<p>Merging the Two Railways: The Jidun and Jichang Railways, through Jin Bitong (son of Prince Su of the former Qing Dynasty) and the Japanese Nakagawa Zensho (former representative of the South Manchuria Railway dispatched to the Jichang Railway), have signed a secret agreement to implement the merger. Starting from December 1st, direct through-trains will be opened, and the line will be renamed Changdun Railway. The Changchun Railway Station in front of the Changchun South Manchuria Railway Station was formerly known as Changchun Station, and the Jichang Railway Station was formerly known as Toutaogou Station. Now the Jichang Railway Station is named Changchun Station, and the South Manchuria Railway Station is renamed East Station. It is said that the secret agreement for the merger was signed on October 28th. In addition to the Japanese representative, the Chinese parties involved were Xi Qia and Jin Bitong. In order to implement the merger, the Japanese side specially sent Xi Qia and Jin Bitong 1 million Japanese yen each as a reward.</p>
<p>Seizing the Electricity Industry: The Changchun Electric Light Plant is a commercial enterprise run by the Jilin Provincial Bank. At the end of September, the Japanese army sent troops to guard it, and the South Manchuria Electric Company sent Qiao to serve as a consultant to the plant. Later, the Japanese army headquarters summoned Gao Wuzi, the director of the plant, and ordered him to sign a 50-year lease contract. Wu refused and argued with Duomen, with strong reasoning and a vow not to sign. Seeing that the plan was not working, Duomen went to Jilin and ordered Xi Qia to remove Wu. Xi Qia obeyed and dismissed Wu on November 24th, and appointed Wu Renpu to take over. The electricity lease contract is expected to be signed soon. The Changchun electricity industry will be lost to others from now on. It is said that the content of the lease is that the Changchun Chinese Electric Light Plant leases electricity from the South Manchuria Electric Company to provide sufficient power. For each kilowatt of electricity used, a fee of 3 Japanese sen per day is paid, for a period of 50 years. The plant must also permanently hire Japanese people as supervisors to manage all financial matters. The full text has ten articles, and this is its general outline.</p>
<p>Commercial Decline: Changchun's commercial district used to be a lively place, but in the past two months, the roads have been quiet and deserted, and shops have been closed. Red paper notices for vacant rentals and store transfer are everywhere. According to the Chamber of Commerce, over 200 businesses have closed down in the past two months. The largest department store in the city, the Xiehe Shopping Mall, used to sell 2,000 yuan per day, but now it sells less than 200 yuan. Other foreign goods stores that used to sell 400-500 yuan per day now sell less than 20-30 yuan. The desolate scene is evident. Moreover, the Japanese army is negotiating to place two Japanese advisors in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It is foreseeable that Changchun's commerce will be completely controlled by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Demonstrations: After the Japanese army occupied Changchun on September 19th, they sent troops to guard all institutions such as the electric light plant, telegraph and telephone bureau, public security bureau, and municipal government office, and they have not yet withdrawn. Their armed battalions patrol the streets every day. Recently, because the Second Division was sent to the Tao'ang Railway line to conquer Heilongjiang Province, Changchun's defenses were weak. Therefore, the Japanese Commercial School students organized a volunteer army to help maintain order. Most of the students in the school are young children, mostly only ten years old or so, and they are also carrying guns and ammunition, demonstrating in the city every day. The South Manchuria Railway garrison also patrols from time to time. The Haicheng artillery team sometimes drags more than a dozen large cannons and armored vehicles, slowly moving on the streets. Therefore, Japanese troops pass by every street every half hour. The Japanese army also took three gold watches from</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Shenchang Clock Shop, paying only 3 Japanese yen. The Japanese troops guarding the electric light plant took the wristwatches of the plant workers. Other acts, such as not paying for rides, not paying for goods purchased, and beating Chinese people for no reason, are too numerous to mention. Pedestrians at midnight are often considered spies and shot to death. After nine o'clock, there is no one on the streets except for guards and patrol police. In addition, Japanese police investigate household registrations, arrest people at will, search schools, and Korean and Japanese ronin commit robberies, and traitors take advantage of the situation. Such actions occur every day, which is truly painful. (November 30th)</p>

<h3>Prelude to the Japanese Cabinet's Shakeup</h3>
<p>Coalition Cabinet Still in the Works</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: The curtain on the Japanese political situation has slowly begun to rise. Although Agriculture Minister Machida, Prime Minister Sakurai, Justice Minister Watanabe, Communications Minister Koizumi, Finance Minister Inoue, and others have been focusing on the current situation, doing their best to encourage Prime Minister Wakatsuki to take a hard line, the future remains uncertain until Home Minister Adachi returns to Tokyo. On the 21st, Adachi returned to Tokyo from the army exercise grounds, covered in dust from his journey. As soon as he took off his luggage, he issued a statement in the form of a speech. The main points were: "The current situation has reached a critical point. Therefore, if the nation's beliefs and determination recognize the possibility of creating a 'national cabinet based on the cooperation of political parties,' then it can be done at any time. There is no need for any hesitation here." While issuing the statement, Home Minister Adachi decided to avoid all unpublicized behind-the-scenes maneuvering, intending to openly negotiate directly with the Seiyukai party.</p>
<p>Like a bolt from the blue, the entire party government was shaken. The result of the meeting between the two giants Wakatsuki and Adachi on the 22nd revealed even greater flaws. Wakatsuki said, "I agree with the ideal of a cooperative cabinet. It would be great if it could be realized, but it is currently impossible. Therefore, it is better not to talk about it." Adachi said, "Realization is difficult, but we cannot conclude that it is impossible. If it is truly impossible in the future, then we will do what we can with the current situation at that time." These two opinions are diametrically opposed, adding a heavy layer of grey to the fate of the current cabinet. At the same time, a direct conflict apparently occurred between Prime Minister Wakatsuki and Home Minister Adachi, leading to the ______ of the cabinet, ______ confrontation.</p>
<p>The Gateway of the Shenyang Puppet Government Construction Research Association</p>
<p>If Prime Minister Wakatsuki strongly advocates maintaining the status quo, Home Minister Adachi is extremely supportive of a coalition cabinet. In this context, the words and actions of the opposition Seiyukai party are worthy of attention. Recently, Seiyukai Secretary-General Kuhara visited Kinmochi Saionji, stating the Seiyukai's position, roughly saying, "A coalition cabinet violates the normal path of constitutionalism. At the same time, it is completely incompatible with our party's principles. Two political parties from the ruling and opposition parties with completely different policies suddenly join hands, which is political suicide. For example, on issues such as the gold embargo and diplomacy, there is absolutely no possibility of cooperation between the Seiyukai and the current cabinet. At this time, the Seiyukai has decided to reject all temptations and strive to form a new, independent cabinet." This statement, whether viewed from the facts or from the theory, seems to have considerable grounds for existence. At the same time, it clearly expresses the Seiyukai's non-cooperation policy, adding another layer of shadow to the formation of a coalition cabinet. Before today's major and difficult situation, there is indeed a need to create a national united coalition cabinet. In today's world, any national with a supra-partisan patriotic heart would not oppose the appearance of a coalition cabinet. In other words, anyone who opposes a coalition cabinet can be said to be unpatriotic." This was the statement issued by Home Minister Adachi during a meeting with the Minseito party's executives on the 23rd. Under the current circumstances, the Seiyukai has already distanced itself, opposing a coalition cabinet, while Wakatsuki is resolutely advocating maintaining the status quo. Adachi, in the face of these two major difficulties, cannot but make this more explicit statement. At the same time, in order to satisfy the demands of the "Adachi faction," he cannot but make this more explicit statement. This statement can not only consolidate Adachi's own political position, but also give the coalition cabinet movement some sensation. The Minseito party originally held a very large majority in the parliament. This time, Adachi's decisive emergence is tantamount to turning against the party. However, as far as Home Minister Adachi himself is concerned, it is recently impossible to join hands with Wakatsuki again, abandon the proposition of a coalition cabinet, and put his own politics in a suicidal situation. Adachi cannot invite Wakatsuki to compromise, nor can he cooperate with the Seiyukai, and he is unwilling to abandon his previous proposals. In the end, whether he intends to win over a part of the Minseito and establish a new party remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In short, if a coalition cabinet can be formed, the "Wakatsuki Cabinet" will inevitably collapse. Conversely, if a coalition cabinet cannot be formed, then Adachi, for the sake of his own political position, can only resort to resignation. However, Home Minister Adachi's resignation may still induce the collapse of the current cabinet.</p>
<p>Caught between a wolf in front and a tiger behind, in a dilemma, the life of the Wakatsuki Cabinet may be buried in this prelude to a coalition cabinet. (Published by Shou on November 24th)</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Students Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Urging the Government to Recover Lost Territories</p>
<p>Presenting Four Matters to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xuzhou Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association petition group has departed for Beijing to petition Chiang. The group departed in batches on the 29th and 30th. The group is organized by seven secondary schools into eight teams. The teams are: 1st Xuzhou Middle School, 2nd Xuzhou Middle School, Xuzhou Girls' Middle School, Zhengxin, Peixin, Private Xuzhou, Tongshan Normal, and Art Academy. Each team elected one person to be the presidium. The candidates were Xu Tongyi, Peng Ying, Han Ruchun, Wang Yiyin, Wang Jizhou, Wu Xiaosa, Sun Chuanwen, and Wu Binlian. Xu Xienong, a teacher from the 1st Xuzhou Middle School, was invited to be the commander-in-chief, and Gu Zuhua from the 2nd Xuzhou Middle School and Zhu Dezhang from Private Xuzhou were invited to be the deputy commanders. Each team also elected one commander and one deputy commander to lead. Before departure, the headquarters stipulated the following creeds: (1) Obey orders, (2) Endure hardship, (3) Help each other, (4) Maintain neat ranks. The first batch assembled at the East Railway Station on the afternoon of the 29th and boarded the train south. At that time, the Garrison Headquarters had received a telegram from Beijing ordering them to persuade the students to stop going to Beijing. The department instructed the county government to handle the matter. The county party headquarters also received a central telegram advising them to stop the students. However, the students were determined to go and the persuasion was ineffective. The Jinpu Station Master immediately telegraphed the Pukou Management Committee for instructions. The reply was to handle the matter carefully. Before long, the special train of Commander Wang sent to greet him was also prepared to go south. The railway then attached several passenger cars. The first batch of students then boarded the train and went south. The second batch boarded the Pingpu train that night. The third batch departed on another train on the 30th. In two days, a total of three batches departed, with a total of more than 1,000 people. The students were all wearing uniforms and did not bring bedding. Each person had several pounds of dry pancakes for several days of food. Their spirit of hardship and perseverance is admirable. It is planned that all three batches of students will gather at the Central University and present four petitions to Chairman Chiang in person. The petition reads: "Respectfully presented, since the brutal Japanese occupied our Northeast, their fierce flames have become more and more intense, and more and more land has been lost. The League of Nations has lost its credibility, and Ma Jun is in isolated danger. At this critical moment, it is difficult to sweep away the evil atmosphere unless we personally carry out heavenly punishment. Therefore, the people of the country hope that our public sentiment is more urgent than a shooting star. When Duke Guo Linggong went to the east, the thieves were all terrified. When Emperor Zhenzong of Song personally led the expedition to Chanyuan, the morale of the soldiers increased. Now is the time. Recently, we heard that the Fourth Plenary Session has passed the proposal to defend national rights and protect national territory, and that Your Excellency also has the determination to recover the lost territories in the shortest possible time. A cloud of hope in a great drought, a timely rain from the royal army, not only the people of the East have this desire, but also the people of the whole country are grateful and tearful. We continue to write about saving the country, with two thoughts intertwined. We vow not to be slaves of a fallen country. How fortunate to hear the training of the oath, so we are sincerely worried, bleeding our hearts, kowtowing nine times before the army, and again speaking to the commander. First, we ask our Chairman to go north to defend the country. The sooner we kill the enemy, the sooner we save the country. Second, we ask our Chairman to strictly order Zhang Xueliang, who lost the territory, to quickly gather the remnants and make meritorious service to atone for his sins. Encourage him to learn from Feng Xiaoyang's Mianchi's struggle, and not just be like Chen Shubao who has no heart and soul. Third, we ask our Chairman to issue firearms to the schools in Xuzhou, so that the volunteer army can be established as soon as possible. Since Xuzhou has had many strong men since ancient times, if they can be trained, they will naturally become a powerful army. Fourth, we ask our Chairman to clearly order the governments of various places to do their best to protect the patriotic movement, because force is the vanguard of defeating the enemy, and refusing goods is the shield of revenge. We are not talented, and present four matters. We beg for your instruction. We hate that we cannot follow you closely and contribute to the Yanran's achievements. We are fortunate to see the vehicles and horses go far, and we will see the Xianyun's support. Nan Zhong has prestige, and the north wind is strong. Take care of your journey ahead, and listen to the triumphal song. With the most sincere enthusiasm, we gather a group of more than 2,000 people to visit the capital and show our hearts and offer advice to the country. We respectfully ask for your decision. The Xuzhou Student Petition Group of 2,000 people kowtow together." In addition, they also sent out a circular telegram, a declaration, and a letter to fellow countrymen. When each batch of students boarded the train, they shouted slogans, and people from all walks of life went to the station to see them off, which was extremely enthusiastic and impassioned.

<h3>Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>47th National Affairs Meeting</p>
<p>Passed Measures to Exempt Native Cloth from Business Tax</p>
<p>Resolved to Participate in the American People's Art Exhibition</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 47th National Affairs Meeting on the morning of the 1st. Song Ziwen, Liu Ruiheng, Li Shuhua, Wang Boqun, Yang Shuzhuang, Gu Weijun, Ma Fuxiang, and He Yingqin attended. Chairman Song Ziwen discussed the following matters: (1) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry jointly reported that the chambers of commerce in Shanghai and other places, as well as the native cloth industry associations, have successively requested exemption from the business tax on native cloth. Also, since the promulgation of the Business Tax Law, various industries have successively requested reductions and exemptions, some of which are worthy of adoption. The two ministries have repeatedly dispatched personnel to discuss together, and have resolved four principles and measures for reducing and exempting the business tax: 1. All hand-woven fabric industries, where both the supply and demand sides are poor people, should be exempt from the business tax for both the manufacturing and sales industries of handmade native cloth in order to maintain their livelihoods. Stores that also sell other items, but whose main business is selling handmade native cloth, should also have the main part excluded from taxation. 2. Manufacturers or sellers of equipment may be granted a discretionary exemption from the business tax if the central or provincial and municipal governments consider it necessary to promote or maintain them. Those exempted by the provincial and municipal governments should be reported to the Ministry for record. 3. Manufacturers and sellers of necessities of life and other emergency supplies, which have a relief nature under special circumstances such as disasters and famines, may be temporarily exempted from the business tax by the central or provincial and municipal governments in designated areas and periods. Those exempted by the provincial and municipal governments should be reported to the Ministry for record. 4. For domestic indigenous products and handicrafts related to the livelihoods of the poor, if it is necessary to promote and maintain them under special circumstances in international trade, the central or provincial and municipal governments may discretionary reduce or exempt the business tax for their manufacturing or sales industries. Those discretionary reduced or exempted by the provincial and municipal governments should be reported to the Ministry for record.

<h3>Split in the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Course of the Dispute Between the Peace Faction and the Power Faction</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: There were more than 700 representatives at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Province. Due to different factions, the situation was quite complicated. There were disputes even before the meeting started. Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, and others returned to Guangdong from Shanghai with letters from Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, and others. When they discussed the meeting with the local authorities, the Power Faction expressed dissatisfaction with the resolutions of the Seventh Shanghai Peace Conference, especially the item of the first, second, and third Central Committee members serving as natural members of the fourth session. They strongly opposed it and criticized the Guangdong representatives for not implementing the Guomindang's Ma and Ma telegrams, which was extremely harsh. A certain member of the Power Faction, in his report at the commemoration week of the Fourth Plenary Session on the 23rd, stated that the Power Faction's attitude towards personal issues remained unchanged. Later, Sun Ke mediated, explaining the suffering of the Shanghai Peace Conference in seeking compromise, and that it was better to deal with external issues first and not be picky about personal issues. However, the Power Faction still refused to budge. When the Fourth Plenary Session opened, Sun Ke served as chairman. When reading Sun Yat-sen's will, representatives of the Power Faction expressed their anti-Sun attitude at their seats, and some shouted slogans to overthrow Sun Ke. The meeting suddenly became tense. It is said that about 200 of the representatives belonged to the Wang faction, who allied with about 80 to 90 Sun faction representatives to confront the Power Faction representatives. Thus, all the representatives were divided into two factions. The A faction advocated maintaining the resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference, while the B faction opposed the resolutions of the Peace Conference. However, the number of representatives in the two factions was greater in the Power Faction, so Sun Ke saw that the situation was not good and advocated suspending the meeting and waiting for Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin to return to Guangdong before deliberating. Later, the Power Faction could not wait and, at the second meeting on the 23rd, proposed, in the name of an extraordinary meeting, to reject the resolution of the Shanghai Peace Conference to make the first, second, and third Central Committee members members of the fourth session. The representatives of the Wang and Sun factions opposed it to no avail, and it was eventually passed by a majority vote. Also on that day, Sun Ke knew that the situation was unfavorable and did not attend. The Secretary-General of the Assembly, Li Wenfan, also requested leave on the grounds that he had served as a peace representative in Shanghai. After the victory of the Power Faction, the Wang and Sun factions knew that there was no hope of saving the situation and could not stand in Guangdong. Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren hurriedly went to Hong Kong on the morning of the 24th. The representatives of the two factions then left Guangdong one after another. The Fourth Plenary Session thus broke down. After Sun and others went to Hong Kong, the Nanhua Newspaper, run by the Wang faction in Hong Kong, fully disclosed the circumstances of the dispute and the pressure they had been subjected to, and made all sorts of disparaging remarks. Zhao Pilian, Guo Chuntao, Bai Yunti, and others among the northern representatives also went to Hong Kong and made statements, expressing their anger at the unreasonableness of the Power Faction. It is estimated that since the 24th, a total of about 200 representatives of the Wang and Sun factions have completely left Guangdong and gone to Hong Kong. Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren jointly issued a letter to the Fourth Plenary Session of Guangdong, more than a thousand words long, which explained the details of the incident in great detail. Also, after Sun and others left Guangdong, the Fourth Plenary Session was suspended. At the same time, there were many rumors in the market, involving the disintegration of the warlords. However, in fact, no special accidents have occurred in recent days. There was only a slight curfew at night. People in the financial community regarded this turmoil as an opportunity for speculation. Manipulators of central banknotes took the opportunity to act, so the value of central banknotes that had not been cashed in the market fell sharply from the 24th, from 93.4% to 82%. The navy was also slightly on guard during the winter defense period. However, the Fourth Plenary Session still issued a notice on the evening of the 25th, stating that the third formal meeting would continue at 2 pm on the 26th. However, it is still questionable whether there will be a quorum for the meeting after the representatives of the Wang and Sun factions leave. Also, on the evening of the 25th, the Fourth Plenary Session also issued a circular telegram correcting the resolution of the Peace Conference. Its wording was still based on the Ma and Ma telegrams. To sum up, the situation does not seem optimistic. (Evening of November 25th)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Dispute over Donation for Banquets Escalates: The banquet donation in Wuxian County was recently contracted by Han Mutao for 2,300 yuan per month. Han Mutao then entrusted various restaurants to collect the donation from diners on his behalf. Because the restaurants opposed it, a dispute occurred. This donation is designated for educational purposes, so the Bureau of Finance and the Bureau of Education jointly submitted a request to the Provincial Department of Finance and the Provincial Department of Education for instructions. The Provincial Department of Education has issued three proposed measures: (1) Handled by recognized merchants, (2) Revoke the recognized merchants and let the restaurant industry association collect on their behalf, (3) Collected directly by the bureau. The county was ordered to handle the matter carefully. The recognized merchant, Han Mutao, submitted a request to the county government to order the Public Security Bureau to recognize that the representatives of the restaurant industry, Wang Xiangbao and others, were deliberately resisting taxes and asked them to be arrested. Therefore, when the members of the restaurant industry went to the Public Security Bureau to petition on the afternoon of the 30th, the representatives Wang Xiangbao, Zhang Wenbin, Qin Ziyuan, Sun Guichang, and Zhang Xingsheng were detained by the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, the industry held an emergency meeting yesterday (1st) and telegraphed party and government organs and chambers of commerce for assistance. The iron machine, silk weaving, and other 30 industry associations were extremely indignant about this matter. They believed that the restaurant industry was not resisting taxes, but only opposed being the collection agency for the recognized merchant. The Public Security Bureau abused its power and illegally arrested people, which made everyone feel insecure and was undermining commercial operations. They urgently moved to the county chamber of commerce. The county chamber of commerce then convened a meeting at 5 pm yesterday (1st) and immediately resolved to telegraph the provincial government, the provincial department of finance, and the provincial department of education to investigate the matter quickly in order to maintain the rule of law.</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Came to Suzhou for Inspection: Cai Tingkai, Commander of the Garrison of Beijing and Shanghai, came to Suzhou from Zhenjiang at 3 pm on the 1st to inspect the 60th Division. Division Commander Shen led Zou Battalion Commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Regiment to welcome him at the station. After getting off the train, Cai went to the Division Headquarters on Northeast Street in the city to rest.</p>

<p>Kidnapping and Assault in Xin'an Town: Zou Ruichu, owner of Shuntai East Provisions Store in Xin'an Town, District 13 of the county, is a prominent local figure with considerable land and a thriving business. At 6 PM the night before last, after closing up for the day, Zou Ruichu went to South Street on business. The store's accountant, Hua Qinshun, was at his desk working on the accounts when suddenly five bandits, each armed with a handgun, burst through the door. They fired three shots into the air as a warning and asked where Zou Ruichu was. A shop assistant replied that he was not home. One bandit remained outside to keep watch, while the other four rushed into the inner room, seized Zou's daughter-in-law, Ling Lanfen, and threatened her with a gun. Zou's wife, Mrs. Ma, heard the commotion from upstairs and ran downstairs, forcefully pushing the bandits away. Ling Lanfen managed to escape. The bandits, enraged, fired two shots, wounding Mrs. Ma, and kidnapped Yao Qishi, an apprentice at the store, dragging him outside. As they passed the Xinchang Rice Shop at the end of the street, they also abducted Wang Jian'san, the shop owner, and fled with their captives. Lin Huben, a member of the town's militia, was patrolling the street and, seeing the situation, immediately attempted a rescue. He was shot and wounded by the bandits, who also stole his rifle. As the bandits were boarding a boat with their hostages, the defense corps arrived to surround and capture them. Shots were exchanged, but due to the late hour, the bandits managed to escape with their captives.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Having Received Public Bonds Must Not Suspend Operations Without Reason: After receiving silk industry relief bonds, many silk factories in this county have suspended operations, affecting production. The provincial government, through the Department of Civil Affairs, has instructed the Wuxi County government to strictly order all silk factories that have received public bonds not to suspend operations without reason. Those that have already suspended operations must resume production immediately to provide stability for workers and benefit production.</p>
<p>Train Collision at Wuxi Station: Yesterday morning, after 7 AM, a freight train engine at the Xili Yangqi of Wuxi Railway Station stopped to take on water. A Shanghai-Changzhou down train, the first of the day, arrived from Changzhou. Due to heavy fog, the station failed to switch the tracks properly. As the train entered Yangqi, it collided head-on with the engine. The tracks sustained some damage. Fortunately, there were few passengers, and only a few were injured by the impact. The Wuxi stationmaster quickly arranged for repairs, and traffic has now returned to normal.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Large Gang of Bandits Captured: At Donghe Village, about three miles from the city, seven bandit boats arrived at approximately 7 PM on the 29th. Villagers, seeing the situation, immediately sounded the alarm. Upon hearing the news, the provincial river police stationed at the East Gate immediately sailed to apprehend them. The police force and the chamber of commerce branch also arrived successively, and together they captured all seven bandit boats and twenty-five bandits, male and female, and escorted them to the county government for strict interrogation.</p>

<h3>Establishment of a Visiting Office for Students in the UK</h3>
<p>The China Committee of the British Universities China Committee has been established for several years, with the aim of enhancing cultural exchanges between China and the United Kingdom. Vice-chancellors of universities across the UK and individuals from various sectors concerned with Chinese affairs are all members of the committee. Recently, the Chinese and British governments have agreed to allocate £200,000 from the Boxer Indemnity Fund to the committee as a foundation. The interest income, as stipulated by the British Parliament, will primarily be used to achieve the following objectives: (1) inviting Chinese scholars to lecture in the UK and British scholars to lecture in China; (2) assisting Chinese students in the UK in renting suitable accommodation; (3) providing guidance to Chinese students in the UK on academic and related matters; (4) employing Chinese language professors or lecturers to facilitate the teaching of Chinese language and literature in British universities; (5) promoting collaboration between academic luminaries from China and the UK to advance cultural progress. As the committee has not yet received these funds, the aforementioned activities will be implemented somewhat later. However, the committee has already begun collaborating with Mr. Yang Guangzheng, the Chinese Consul-General in London, and the Chinese Students' Union in the UK to provide guidance to Chinese students in the UK. An office has been established at 3 Endsleigh St, London, W.C.I. Chinese students in the UK or those planning to study in the UK who require assistance with admission procedures, renting accommodation, hiring teachers, or internship placement may contact the Honorary Secretary, Mr. H.T. Silcock. Furthermore, the committee is currently collaborating with Consul-General Yang and the Chinese Students' Union in the UK to compile an updated directory of Chinese students in the UK for assessment purposes. It is anticipated that this visiting office will provide significant convenience to Chinese students in the UK.</p>

First, the military band played music, and inspecting officer Director Wang and others stepped down from the platform to inspect the troops for a week before returning to their original positions. The troops then circled the parade ground once, led by Colonel Zhang Yifei, the general commander of the army, and held a military parade and a march-past to the sound of military music. The special forces of the volunteer army then performed standardized drills, and the chemical warfare team demonstrated smoke screens and bombs.

<h3>Western Qing Basketball Yesterday's Results</h3>
<p>The Western Qing Basketball Association had two League A matches last night, with the most interesting being the match between Chizhi and Qingguang. The match proceeded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai University Emerges Strongly, Defeats Jiangwan 58-32</p>
<p>As the whistle blew, the entire Shanghai University team was spirited and gained momentum. Jiangwan struggled to resist the strong opponent. At that time, Shanghai University had many opportunities to shoot, but only half of them were successful, otherwise they would have had an even better record. In the first half, Shanghai University had 25 points and Jiangwan had 12 points. In the second half, Shanghai University's Feng Nianhua and Wu Guolin broke through the basket at will, and the score increased sharply. After replacing the reserves, they gave Jiangwan the opportunity to be active, but the difference was already too great. Shanghai University finally defeated Jiangwan 58-32. Referee: Lu Zhongen</p>

<h3>Chizhi Wins by Chance</h3>
<p>Defeats Qingguang 43-37</p>
<p>Qingguang's performance was better than Chizhi's, but in the last seven minutes, the entire army dispersed and disintegrated, and the team was unlucky and failed at the last minute. Chizhi was monitored and could not move as freely as in the past, but relied on its indomitable spirit to break through difficulties and achieve the goal of victory. In the first half, Qingguang took the lead 23-20. At the beginning of the second half, Qingguang still led. Chizhi used two goals from Kong Guangyi to tie the score at 32. Qingguang then moved forward again, but Chizhi rose again. After 37 points, Qian and Gu scored three goals in one breath and won against Qingguang 43-37. Referee: Shao Yi</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Tortoiseshell Beam</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>The Japanese archipelago of the three islands of Nie Er, always harboring the arrogance of a rustic bumpkin. The people of that country value martial prowess, and call themselves "Great Harmony." They implicitly establish the country on the way of the warrior, seeking to take the lead in Eastern martial arts. In reality, in the art of boxing, they only have a superficial understanding. They are not proficient in either the Shaolin or Wudang schools, let alone the internal energy of breathing exercises. However, the Japanese swords produced in that country have a sharpness that can cut iron like mud. However, they are far inferior to the Miao saber, which is flexible enough to wrap around paper. Twenty years ago, Yan Ren Huo Yuanjia came to Shanghai to perform and display his skills, and his courage was known throughout China and abroad. A certain Japanese samurai, who claimed to be the best fighter in his country, wanted to compete with Huo on stage. Huo feared that injuring the samurai would cause diplomatic trouble, and firmly refused. The samurai suspected Huo of being cowardly and exaggerated his claims in various newspapers, even accusing Huo of being falsely renowned. Huo's disciples were numerous, and the young and spirited were indignant. They secretly competed with the samurai, but were defeated. As a result, the samurai's arrogance increased. He personally knocked on Huo's door, insisting on a trial. Huo smiled and said, "Forced into this situation, don't blame me for being reckless. Why not first test our hand strength?" The samurai readily agreed, saying, "Everything is fate." Proud and full of spirit, he stretched out his hands and forcefully attacked Huo. Huo raised his palms to meet him. As soon as they made contact, the samurai fell several feet away. Huo stepped forward and smiled to comfort him. The samurai was extremely ashamed and sweating profusely, knowing that he was no match for Huo's strength. He changed his demeanor and thanked Huo, offering to become his disciple. His attitude was quite respectful. Huo was naturally chivalrous and did not take it to heart. Little did he know that the samurai had already harbored the intention to kill Huo. The samurai formally took the disciple's oath, and Huo meticulously taught him, and his skills advanced rapidly. The following year, the samurai invited Huo to the East to interact with the way of the warrior in his country, secretly placing a slow-acting poison in the wine. Huo, unaware, drank it heartily. Before long, he fell ill. The samurai pretended to be concerned and immediately sent him to the hospital. The doctor was also influenced by the samurai's machinations, and the treatment made him more and more seriously ill. By the time he returned to China, the illness was incurable. A great hero was actually plotted against by a Japanese slave. Writing this, I can't help but feel tears welling up in my eyes. I throw down my pen and wail loudly. Alas, Huo Yuanjia.</p>

<h3>Dialogue Before the God of War (3)</h3>
<p>"Although success or failure is debatable, how can survival or demise be ignored? Losing the country means becoming a slave of the conquered, which should be considered."</p>
<p>"There are distinctions among those who lose their country. Those who lose their country without a fight are called slaves of the conquered. Those who are defeated repeatedly, fighting again and again, and still inevitably lose their country to others are righteous people, and the country of righteous people is called a righteous country. Righteousness lasts forever, who can destroy it? Who can enslave it? During the European War, wasn't Belgium occupied for a time? But no one called the Belgians slaves of the conquered. Why? The Belgians had already fought to the death to defend their neutrality and maintain their national character. Besides white people, America also has black and red people. Black people were once called black slaves, and their bodies could be bought and sold, lacking the spirit of struggle. The red people are a nation that cannot be subdued by force, preferring death to surrender. Although the red race is gradually dwindling, there is not a single red slave. White people with black ancestors are often looked down upon, while those with red ancestors are respected. We don't need to fear losing the country! Losing without a fight is the greatest shame in the world."</p>
<p>"What you say is true, but China's internal disunity makes me feel uneasy."</p>
<p>"Have the Chinese people ever been disunited? Have they ever not been united against foreign aggression? It is only the politicians and warlords who are disunited. Unity cannot be achieved by empty talk. Declaring war on the violent Japanese for the sake of justice and humanity will naturally lead to unity."</p>
<h3>Small Tribe in Tainan Determined to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>— Rooster Crest</p>
<p>An old friend, Mr. Wang Yanan, once traveled to Japan and visited various islands in the South Seas. He mentioned that in Taiwan, there is a village called Guangcun, located in the mountains. The indigenous people living in the village do not interact with the Japanese. Their tradition of resisting Japan has been steadfastly maintained for generations. This is also a matter worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The so-called Guangcun is the indigenous pronunciation. The area is located in the mountains of Tainan, and is a settlement of a type of Taiwanese aborigines. The population is only a few dozen families. They marry among themselves and do not interact with outsiders. They are skilled in martial arts, and climbing mountains and crossing ridges is a common skill. Even women can chase birds and are as strong as men. Currently, these aborigines still farm and weave themselves and refuse to be assimilated by the Japanese. Their spirit of resisting Japan is admirable.</p>
<p>It is said that more than ten years ago, a Japanese garrison commander named Fukushima often liked to go on exploratory tours during his military leisure time. One day, he arrived at the village and was surrounded and attacked by the aborigines. Three guards died. Fukushima escaped and fled, then led troops to suppress them. However, the mountains were empty, and there was no trace of anyone. Unable to search, he returned in disappointment. Afterwards, he repeatedly sent scouts to investigate, but there was little news. In fact, the aborigines moved around and had no fixed whereabouts, so the Japanese were helpless. In recent years, the Japanese population has been sparse and not a cause for concern, so they have been allowed to live and die on their own without interference. Therefore, when the people of Tainan mention Guangcun, they treat it as outside of civilization.</p>
<p>It is also said that the residents of Guangcun are indeed one of the oldest indigenous groups in Tainan. When the Japanese seized Taiwan, their chieftain once vowed to resist Japan. He was killed for his resistance. Now, his descendants live in the mountains, and their hatred for Japan has not diminished at all. Small tribes have never lacked ambition and are worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>World Small News</p>
<p>It is becoming popular in the United States to trade goods instead of using money. Country doctors treat patients without charging fees, instead accepting chickens and eggs as payment. Farming tools can also be purchased without money, using wheat as collateral. One school does not charge students tuition, instead accepting wheat.</p>
<p>The town of Saga in the Prussian province of Silesia produces a large number of cats. Therefore, families that keep cats must pay taxes. Each family pays one pound for one cat, three pounds for the second cat, and four pounds for four cats.</p>
<p>Canada's fur trade has become a major industry, worth six million pounds annually. There are 5,513 fur factories that produce mink, fox, otter, muskrat, and water mink fur for people to keep warm.</p>
<p>The British man Bunyan's immortal work "Pilgrim's Progress" still sells very well, having been translated into 126 languages, breaking all literary records.</p>
<p>The Rheims region of France produces the most grapes. This year, due to pests and bad weather, the harvest is very small. It is said that there will be no new ingredients for making champagne after 1931.</p>
<h3>A White Sparrow</h3>
<p>— Shallow</p>
<p>My friend Pan Zian mentioned yesterday that a strange sparrow was found near his home. Its appearance is no different from ordinary sparrows, except that its feathers are pure white. It is capricious and difficult to catch. It took more than twenty days of effort to put it in a cage. He once checked the Compendium of Materia Medica, but there was no mention of its use, but it was said to be an auspicious sign. I don't know if the bird is truly rare and precious, or if it is a white pig from Liaodong. Therefore, I publish it in the newspaper to inquire about the world's knowledgeable people.</p>
<h3>Talking About Milk in Early Winter</h3>
<p>— Ms. Yeh Hua</p>
<p>The suffering of mankind due to improper diet has only gradually been resolved. At the end of the nineteenth century, the dawn of organic chemical knowledge appeared. Food was analyzed into simple chemical compounds. In the last twenty years, the principle of nutrition was discovered, and the value of milk increased tenfold. As a result, the dairy industry has transformed from family-run businesses into enterprises with capital of one or two million yuan. The commercial sale of dairy products has also emerged. The problem is becoming more complex. Those that are related to us, I write on the left.</p>
<p>Dairy cows and milk All cows that can produce milk for a long time, and the price of milk is higher than the price of meat, are called dairy cows. Their ancestor was Bos. The Bos family is the same as other cows. Dairy cows are improved by breeding. There are two types of cattle. One is Bos indicus, and the other is Bos taurus. Artificial breeding methods were then used to increase the number of species. The excellent dairy cows are Jersey, Guernsey, and Holstein. The Jersey color ranges from light gray to dark gray jujube red tea. The average weight per head is 900 pounds. It produces about 19 pounds of milk per day. Rich in butterfat. The oil globules are very large. The Guernsey has various colors of white, yellow, and red. Light ones weigh 1,000 pounds and heavy ones weigh 1,300 pounds. It can produce 22 pounds of milk per day. The pigment is uniquely rich. Other cows cannot match it. It can attract customers. Dairy farms are happy to use it. Holstein milk production is second to none among cows. It contains less oil. The color is whiter. It has more protein. It is most suitable for feeding children. This cow has black and white spots. Its weight is 1,700 pounds. It is the largest of the cattle. We should pay attention to three things when drinking milk.</p>
<p>Microbes and milk Milk can nourish people, and it can also nourish microbes. In healthy cows, every cubic centimeter of milk has hundreds of microbes at most, and only ten or so at least. Harding found an average of 428 microbes per cubic centimeter in 1,230 samples of cow's milk. The temperature is especially high. The microbial productivity is especially fast. When milk is acidified, bacteria account for 90 percent. After the milk hardens, the bacteria reach 99 percent. Pulmonary tuberculosis, swollen hands and feet, typhoid fever,</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Reporter's Hatred of Losing the Country (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ms. Yeh Hua</p>
<p>News monopoly Since Taiwan fell into the hands of the Japanese, it has been isolated from the world. Letters and telegrams cannot be freely sent and received. The only source of foreign news in newspapers is the Japanese Electric News Agency and the United News Agency. The former is operated by Japanese sole proprietorship, and the latter is jointly operated by Japan and the United States. There are no other institutions besides these. Even Reuters manuscripts are banned. This is how the Taiwanese people are deceived. The world situation and human life are beyond their imagination. The Taiwanese newspapers are instructed to publicize the atrocities of the Japanese army in China, claiming that Chinese soldiers are all bandits, bullying small ethnic groups, harming the righteous Japanese army, and destroying Japan's vested interests in the eastern provinces. Such blood-curdling words that slander international morality, reversing right and wrong, and confusing black and white. Taiwanese people with knowledge know that they are being deceived, but they are trapped in a fog, and the truth is unknown.</p>
<p>The pain of inspection The Japanese have already seized Taiwanese newspapers, but they are still afraid of losing their news policy. They also conduct strict surveillance. The newspapers' layouts are sent to the police station for inspection before printing, called "review." On average, a blank space is seen every two or three days. Temporary suspensions and delayed printing occur several times a month. Reporters being fined, arrested, exiled, and missing are common. If a reporter has any anti-Japanese suspicion, plainclothes police will track them everywhere. They are inseparable from teahouses, pubs, street corners, and alleys. There is always the danger of family ruin and death. Compared to the infamous secret agents of Russia and the Italian Black Shirts, they are even more violent and reckless. Mr. Zhang said this with tears in his voice.</p>
<p>Diphtheria, rubella, sore throat, and gastrointestinal diseases are often mediated by milk bacteria. How can we not be afraid? In addition to cleaning the milk parlor, using small-mouthed milk buckets, and washing milking machines, the defensive method is to use Pasteur's sterilization method. This method raises the temperature of milk to over 160 degrees Fahrenheit for half a minute and then rapidly cools the temperature of the milk. This method is mostly used in large sea dairy farms. In recent years, there has been a method of disinfecting in bottles, so that the milk does not come into contact with the space again after disinfection. Borden invented canned milk in 1853. Substitutes for milk powder were invented by Custer, Campbell, and Sankeb, and were also disinfected.</p>
<h3>Donating Paintings to Help the Black Army</h3>
<p>— Ma Mengrong</p>
<p>The Japanese pirates are deepening day by day. The eastern corner has been lost. But the officials in power are calm and do not resist, sitting by and watching the humiliating loss of teachers and land. There is nothing that can be done. Only General Ma Zhanshan, with a small force, resisted tens of thousands of troops and became a pillar of the country. He supported half of the country and fought bloody battles. He repeatedly frustrated the enemy's offensive, and finally ran out of ammunition and had no reinforcements. He temporarily retreated to Hailun. When the alarm came, people here were all filled with hot anger. They competed to donate money to reward his soldiers. It is a true act of righteousness. Mr. Xu Xixi, the son-in-law of Mr. Wu Daiqiu of Shimen, is known for his calligraphy and painting. His clear and elegant style has long been famous in the art world. He came to Shanghai from Yuanhu. Mr. Wu Zhenping and Mr. Zhang Yisheng visited him at his residence. Mr. Xu said with emotion: "The country is in trouble. We scholars cannot throw our pens and join the army, or ride horses and kill thieves. I have been working with pens and ink for a long time. I have a hundred paintings in my chest. I am willing to sell them all and donate the money to the Black Army. The two gentlemen were inspired by his master. Mr. Zhang also donated dozens of his recent works. Mr. Wu prepared the event for him. The exhibition was held in the auditorium of the New World Hotel for three days starting on the 27th. I was in a hurry when I received Mr. Daiqiu's invitation, and Mr. Zhenping also asked me to attend. So I went to see it in the rain. Mr. Xu led me to read the works. I saw that his landscapes were thick and simple, with the method of the former sages, and no vulgar habits of the time. It was like his father-in-law's style. His inscriptions were also very similar. I know that he has gained a lot from Dai Weng. His imitations of Tang Liuru and Shen Shitian are also profound and upright. They are considered to be cooperative works. His flowers and plants are also outstanding in pen and ink, and his style is elegant. He has the strengths of Huishu, Menglu, and Zixiang. Xixi must have secretly studied the elders of Yuanhu. Yisheng is engaged in pattern painting and has recently devoted himself to traditional Chinese painting. He has also visited Dai Weng's gate. Therefore, his paintings also have Dai Weng's style. Dai Weng's landscape paintings are exquisite and highly valued in Jilin. The society has a fixed evaluation. I especially love his ancient and simple flowers and plants. I have not done landscape paintings for a long time. In recent years, I have been happy to write life to entertain myself. Dai Weng Xu is a work that has both ancient methods and new interests. He is a work that combines talent and hard work. He also encouraged me to make a book of flowers, birds, and insects as a model for painting learners. I am ashamed. (Move reward for black)</p>

<h3>Country Folks Arrive in Shanghai Again (34)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>At this time, the country folk seemed to be going crazy. People didn't know what he was doing? They couldn't pull him back. They thought he was a drunken man, but the country folk hadn't drunk any wine just now. They thought he was a crazy madman, but the country folk were not crazy. Passersby felt puzzled, and were afraid that he would cause some trouble, and everyone surrounded him and asked him what was wrong?</p>
<p>"Didn't you see what two words are on his electric light?"</p>
<p>Passersby, pointed out by the country folk, really raised their heads and opened their eyes to look at the electric lights above, and there was nothing strange about them, but they didn't know what he meant in his heart? Everyone just stared at him, hoping that he would explain in more detail.</p>
<p>"Do you know who the contemporary heroes of our country are?" The country folk said this very generously and excitedly among the many crowds.</p>
<p>Everyone was even more stunned when they heard this. They thought, could this country bumpkin really have a mental illness? Otherwise, he would have been poisoned by the newly popular martial arts novels. What heroes? What heroes? It's a mess. Probably, crazy people are talking about those kinds of gods and heroes, worshiping ancient heroes. Just like those who suffer from erotic mania, they are all eagerly admiring Cui Yingying in the Romance of the West Chamber and Lin Daiyu in Dream of the Red Chamber. Everyone also wanted to ignore the heroes asked by the country folk. And for a while, they couldn't answer who the heroes of the world are?</p>
<p>"Now in the era, can General Ma Zhanshan, the chairman of Heilongjiang, who is fighting hard in the frontier, be considered a contemporary hero of our country?"</p>
<p>As soon as the country folk said this, everyone agreed. In the agreement, there were also those who clapped their hands and cheered, saying:</p>
<p>"Hero! Hero! He is indeed a contemporary hero!" Everyone never thought that this country folk would be a patriot, and they all agreed that what he said was correct.</p>
<p>"Then do you all support General Ma Zhanshan?" The country folk had an attitude of leading the masses.</p>
<p>"Support General Ma Zhanshan!" "Support General Ma Zhanshan who is fighting hard in the frontier!"</p>
<p>At this time, the general public shouted slogans. The heroic situation inspired many pedestrians and gradually joined in.</p>
<p>"Since we all support General Ma Zhanshan, then if someone opposes General Ma Zhanshan, shouldn't we overthrow him? Look! Why is the electric light here marked with the two words "Anti-Occupy"? Isn't this clearly opposing Ma Zhanshan? Opposing Ma Zhanshan, shouldn't we unanimously protest?"</p>

<p>Breaking Through the 700 Tael Barrier The Bidding Gold Suddenly Plunged Again Yesterday, the situation was stable, and there were no special changes. Only after breaking through 700 taels, there were always a total of ten taels in retrospect. The total decline was more than five taels. Although the silver price fell, the big bars fell slightly, and they did not think so. Especially since the current situation is not very optimistic, the opening was low. In the future, advances and retreats often have three or four tael ranges. Each firm had no large ticket transactions. As for the foreign exchange trends, they differed. British pine and American firm were squeezing small exchanges. At noon, it once returned 700 taels. The market trend was loose and discounted, and a setback was seen again. The exchange rate turned out to be short. It is estimated that British gold can be purchased at one shilling and ten pence and a half, and US dollars at about twelve yuan. The gold price fell again by five or six taels, and people's hearts weakened again.</p>
<p>Morning Opened and Fell, Noon Recovered Slightly It opened one or two cents lower in the morning, at 699 taels. The gray market once traded at 701 taels. The big bars fell by five-sixteenths to three-eighths. The silver price decreased by a small cent, and the private telegram fell by six-eighths. Then it added to 701 taels, falling shortly after, because Hengyu, Yuanda Yong, Yuankangxiang, Hengchangyong, Bingxing, etc. all sold. Moreover, British gold was seen to be loosening, and the recent settlement was ten pence three-seven-five. Therefore, the gold price gradually fell, falling by ten taels, to ninety-one taels and five cents. Not long after, Guangdong Gang, Yifeng, and Cuichangyong bought in, and immediately raised it by four taels. Moreover, HSBC absorbed March British gold three-seven-five, and the Japanese Commercial Bank mutually did March US dollars thirty-one yuan eight-seven-five, resulting in ninety-five and a half taels. Moreover, British gold hung half a penny long, while US dollars shrunk three-seven-five, at ninety-three to four taels at the time. HSBC absorbed British gold three-seven-five again, slightly adding one or two taels, at ninety-five taels. Dadecheng and others sold out, immediately retreating two taels to ninety-three taels. HSBC offered ten pence three-one-two-five. After entering, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanda Yong, Yuanheng, Yifengyong, Yifeng, Tongtaichang, etc. all entered. Wanxing, Shunli, and Dalian Gang also slightly intervened. After only twenty minutes, it was pulled up by five taels, to ninety-eight taels when it was nearly ten o'clock. Later, due to retail investors and hedgers selling, and because US dollars in January could be traded in and out at thirty-two yuan, it was ninety-two and a half taels at ten twenty. Then there was a swing of three or four taels. After eleven o'clock, it was seen to rise again. HSBC absorbed March British gold three-seven-five, Hengchangyong, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Hengyu, Dalian Gang, Yuankangxiang, etc. excitedly chased in. Wu also bought, causing the price to jump by more than eight taels, and then returned 700 taels. At noon, it was 701 taels and five, unexpectedly Fuchang and others came to sell, falling back by more than one tael, totaling 699 taels and eight cents, which was then closed at 700 taels. The announced price was changed to 783 taels, totaling about ninety taels to eighty-three or four taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Plunged, Falling Five and a Half Taels The afternoon market opened at 700 taels, immediately falling, because the Indian exchange telegram had risen by four annas. Moreover, Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Taidecheng, and hedgers sold off, and British gold was even looser, recently totaling ten pence and a half, and US dollars thirty-two yuan. Therefore, it fell by more than five taels, to ninety-two taels and eight cents at two fifty. Afterwards, the Indian exchange continued to increase by twelve annas, and people's hearts were even more empty. Finally, it was ninety-two taels and eight cents. After this, Dalian Gang, Dadecheng, and retail investors chased and bought. Moreover, the forward British gold Mitsui and Holland did three-seven-five, and the Japanese Commercial Bank mutually did US dollars for the next month at thirty-one yuan nine-three-seven-five, to ninety-six and a half taels at three fifty. In an instant, it fell slightly by two taels. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian exchange had returned to small four annas, and Qianchangxiang and others bought in, so it was ninety-six taels and five cents at four fifteen. After a while, the buying and selling were uneven, and people's hearts seemed to be going down. So it fell again by about two taels, to ninety-four taels and one cent. Then it added to ninety-five taels. When the market closed at four thirty, it was ninety-four taels and seven cents, falling again by five and a half taels compared to the previous day. Unexpectedly, it was done again to ninety-two or three taels, because retail investors were selling urgently. According to one day, the maximum was 701 taels and five, and the minimum was 691 taels and five (according to the quoted price), a difference of ten taels. The items were 98 taels in the early market, 700 taels at noon closing, 98 taels and eight cents in the afternoon, and 94 taels and five at the closing. The announced price totaled about ninety taels. The registration was the opposite of the previous day, because there was a lack of cash absorption. In fact, it was due to the urgency of silver. Therefore, the short position in the deferred market could be advanced, resulting in ninety-six taels in November and December, 700 taels in January, ninety-one to ninety-five taels in the afternoon, ninety-six taels in replenishment, and five taels two-five added to the red bar.</p>
<p>The Transaction Volume of Each Firm Was Not Large The transaction on the table was normal. According to statistics, Yuanmaoyong, Wanyu, Tongtaichang, Yifeng, Cuichangyong, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Yongde, and Wu all entered. Hengchangyong and Yuanda Yong entered more and sold less. Dadecheng totaled 2,700 or 800 bars,轧出500 bars, Yuanchun, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, Fuchang, Bingxing, and Yuankangxiang all sold more than they bought. Yuantai, Yuanheng, Hengyu, etc. had irregular deposits and withdrawals. In the afternoon, Hengchangyong, Wanxing, and Taifengcheng all entered. Tongtaichang and Zhifengyong all sold out. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Yuanxingyong, Daxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Dacheng, and Tongchun had uneven deposits and withdrawals. However, the numbers were not many. Guangdong Gang entered seven or eight hundred bars and exited one or two hundred bars. Dalian Gang entered one thousand and exited one or two hundred bars.</p>
<h3>Currency Exchange: Sterling Weak, Dollar Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rates for British pounds, American dollars, Indian rupees, and silver all fell. However, the exchange rate between British pounds and American dollars continued to decrease slightly. Consequently, the trend in the Shanghai market diverged significantly. HSBC's listed prices extended by two points, with British gold at half a penny, equivalent to one shilling, nine pence, and seventy-five farthings. American dollars, on the other hand, contracted by three seventy-fifths, equivalent to thirty yuan and six hundred twenty-five ten-thousandths. Hong Kong added one hundred twenty-five ten-thousandths, totaling seventy-six taels and six hundred eighty-seven and a half ten-thousandths. Indian rupees also weakened, while French and German currencies tightened. It seems the internal market for banks also reflected this trend, with sterling weak and the dollar tight. This was likely a move to squeeze small exchange rates. The market was initially chaotic and unpredictable in the early morning, but later eased and stabilized. It then turned unfavorable in the afternoon as the gold market suddenly returned to the 700 tael threshold. This was due to a slight drop in the London silver market, largely because the current situation remained chaotic, causing anxiety. As a result, compared to the day before, British gold rose by slightly more than one penny, while American dollars only increased by twenty-five ten-thousandths. Chinese gold shops slightly leaned towards settlement, with British gold transactions totaling over 100,000 pounds. There was considerable interbank trading. HSBC reportedly bought up a leading position, with American dollar transactions estimated at 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Other firms made slight gains, while Mitsui reportedly showed persistent willingness to sell.</p>
<p>British Exchange Rates: Internal rates showed a half-penny difference. Early morning quotes were around one shilling, nine pence, seventy-five to ten farthings, with buying prices adding six hundred twenty-five ten-thousandths. Subsequently, Mitsui offered December at ten pence and three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. Mitsubishi Mitsui and HSBC traded March at three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. Sumitomo and HSBC traded the same. At 9:30, HSBC Sumitomo offered three hundred twelve and a half ten-thousandths. At noon, Taiwan HSBC made a new trade at three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. The closing offer was twenty-five ten-thousandths, with a buying price of three hundred twelve and a half ten-thousandths. In the afternoon, Mitsui initially absorbed December at half a penny, then sold March to Holland at three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. Citibank gained half a penny, and Mai Hang offered three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. The closing offer was half a penny, with a buying price of five hundred sixty-two and a half ten-thousandths.</p>
<p>American Exchange Rates: Internal rates fluctuated around three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. The initial opening offer was thirty-one yuan and six hundred twenty-five ten-thousandths, with a buying price of seventy-five to eight hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. Subsequently, Mitsui sold to Sumitomo March at eight hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. Zhengjin offered seventy-five ten-thousandths, and Zhejiang offered Oriental's January at thirty-two yuan. The noon closing offer was seventy-five ten-thousandths, with a buying price of eight hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. In the afternoon, Mitsui sold to Taiwan January at thirty-one yuan and nine thousand three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths. The closing offer was thirty-one yuan and nine thousand three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths, with a buying price of thirty-two yuan and six hundred twenty-five ten-thousandths. One American dollar was equivalent to three taels, two maces, six fen, and fifty-three liang of silver.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Plunge Sharply</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, large bars of silver all saw declines. Recent prices fell by three hundred twelve and a half ten-thousandths, to eighteen pence and eight hundred twelve and a half ten-thousandths. Distant futures also fell by three hundred seventy-five ten-thousandths, to nine pence. Local Chinese and Citibank jointly sold off, while Indian and speculators bought. The market was flat. There were no special changes after the market closed, making market conditions feel even calmer. A telegram from New York reported that American silver prices also fell sharply by one cent, with spot prices at 28.375 cents. British pounds against American dollars fell by twelve and seventy-five hundredths cents, to $3.41. American dollars against British pounds also decreased by twelve and seventy-five hundredths cents, to $3.3975. The British Shanghai shilling fell by half a penny, to one shilling and ten pennies.

<h3>Foreign Interest Eases Slightly, Silver Call Loans Remain Tight</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's foreign currency market was characterized by sluggish sales, leading to a decline in foreign interest rates. This slight decrease of two li compared to the previous morning was seen as good news amidst the tense situation. Due to weakened customer demand and a continuous influx of supply, prices could not remain stable and instead declined. As for the long-term tightness of silver supply, there was still no hope for easing. Although foreign interest rates fell yesterday, silver call loan rates remained firm. It is apparent that there is unlikely to be any turnaround in the current silver supply situation.</p>
<p>Foreign Interest and Call Loan Rates: (Foreign Interest) The market price for foreign interest in the early morning was soft at the opening, causing prices to drop to 7 mace, 2 fen, 4 li, 3 hao, and 7.5 si. The market fell another half a li around noon, reaching 7 mace, 2 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, and 5 si. As a result, the early morning market fell a total of 2 li compared to the previous day. (Silver Call Loans) The early and late morning markets opened at the same rate of 4 qian. The premium interest added on remained strong at 3 qian. Banks listed rates at 1 qian and 6 fen, with no sign of relief or stability in the silver market situation.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver coins were at 6 qian, 4 fen, and 7.5 li in both the early and late markets, rebounding one li compared to the previous day's afternoon market, with transactions of 3,000 jiao in the early market and 2,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were at 6 qian, 5 fen, and 0.02 hao in the early market and 6 qian, 5 fen, and 1 li in the afternoon market, with transactions of 210,000 jiao in the early market and 95,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 378,500 wen, with transactions of over 30,200 strings.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow: (Silver Currency) Yesterday's bank receipts and payments were relatively simple because it was shortly after the end of the month. However, there were still many supplementary settlement payments. Chinese firms received over 2.4 million in remittances, foreign firms received over 2 million in remittances, and various goods, exchange taxes, and other receipts totaled 8.56 million. Settlement and supplementary payments totaled 2.89 million. 600,000 was deposited in warehouses, and 400,000 was withdrawn. Private banks' silver receipts and payments totaled over 49 million, and premium interest payments totaled over 4.1 million. Various remittances totaled over 400,000, and cash withdrawals totaled over 500,000. (Foreign Currency) Exchange remittances in the early market totaled 1.33 million, and 1 million in the afternoon market. Banknotes totaled 140,000 in the early market and 35,000 in the afternoon market. Over-the-counter banknotes totaled 90,000 in the early market and 70,000 in the afternoon market. Interbank transactions totaled 800,000 in the early market and over 500,000 in the afternoon market. Various bank account transactions totaled over 1.4 million, with over 2.1 million in banknote inflows and outflows. Private banks' foreign currency receipts and payments totaled over 5.4 million, and foreign currency premium interest payments totaled over 1.8 million. Interbank foreign currency call loans totaled over 1.3 million. Small private bank transactions totaled over 500,000, with over 300,000 in customer remittances.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Continue to Rise by About Two Yuan</p>
<p>Market Trends Slightly Stable, Market Activity Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday (December 1st), the various bond market conditions on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a variety of spot transactions opening, and buying and selling were considered active. Although the futures market was strong, sales transactions were limited. Each bond still had a small amount of large transactions. At the beginning of the morning opening, due to good market sentiment, scattered purchases were active, and each bond rose sharply compared to when the market was suspended. There was also no major difference from the off-market trading the day before. However, as the market closed, market sentiment turned soft. The buying situation was not as enthusiastic as before, because the diplomatic situation was not as optimistic as the day before. The Japanese side had not repented of its wrongdoing, and its conspiracy to disturb was still in progress, while the League of Nations stood idly by, and there was still no way to mediate. Because of this, buying enthusiasm gradually declined, and each price fell back. In the later market, the trend was stable, hovering without great ups and downs. However, the closing situation and market sentiment were generally good. As a result, compared to the previous spot price, only the 1920 Goodness bond fell by more than three yuan compared to the middle of last month. The rest rose sharply. Only the disbandment 96 futures fell back. The rest continued to rise by more than one yuan or several jiao to more than two yuan. It is estimated that the total daily spot transaction was 25,000 yuan, and the futures transaction was 3,665,000 yuan in the morning market and 1,215,000 yuan in the afternoon market, totaling 4,880,000 yuan, including 700,000 to 800,000 yuan for the unified salt tax and the 1920 customs bonds.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Turns Weak Again</p>
<p>The yarn market has turned weak, the situation has softened, the actual need has become increasingly sluggish, and the current situation is still difficult to be optimistic about, causing people to feel weak again. There is also a manufacturer selling off forward contracts, and the market atmosphere has eased again. In short, the country is in trouble and financial conditions are extremely tight, and commercial development cannot be actively developed.</p>
<p>Human label slightly lowered: At the opening of the human label front market, due to the continuing Japanese aggression and the continued tightness of silver call loans, each month fell by 235 qian. In the afternoon, the near months rose by 56 qian, and the far months fell by 12 qian. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 38,300 packages.

Among the customer firms, 60 packages were bought by the mainland, 140 packages were bought by Jiangxi, 110 packages were bought by Shantou, 45 packages were bought by Guangdong, and 20 packages were bought by miscellaneous firms.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat, but the trend is still tight. However, the US cotton situation is flat, the gold price is slightly weak, and local sentiment is still firm. The Ningbo bulls are buying to increase their positions, so the market atmosphere is supported. However, existing cotton factories have no interest in buying, and the various sources are gradually increasing. The future of the cotton market is still expected to be mostly weak.</p>
<p>Han standard is slightly brisk: At the opening of the Han standard front market, the market atmosphere was flat and soft. The near months rose by 2 qian, and the far months were flat. In the afternoon, the bulls bought to increase their positions, and each month rose by 5 fen to 1.5 qian. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 86,800 dan.

<h3>Imported Yarn and Cotton Both Show Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially fell due to bad news from Liverpool, then strengthened due to the strength of Wall Street, and finally softened again due to some bulls settling their positions. It is estimated that futures rose by 1 to 7 points, and spot prices remained unchanged. UK cotton futures rose by 21 to 23 points, and spot prices rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 25 points. Indian cotton strengthened due to gold prices. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 4.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 30th)</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The River Below Rice Market Falls Sharply, Then Slightly Recovers</p>
<p>South End: Yesterday, over 20 boats of goods arrived from Pujiang. Local sales in this city were extremely weak. The decline in Changshu and Zhongguan goods was even more intense, requiring 2 jiao less. Thin rice inventories were not weak, and sales in this street were flat, as was demand in Ningbo. Market prices were high, costing a corner or so. Mid-grade goods were also lower by 2 chi. Du Yang's pointed goods were rare and sales were slow, also weakening. Fermented distilleries were still eager for dark yin yuan wine, and Chen Po was affected by the new goods, opening a corner lower. Pujiang's grain foot was in the vicinity of 1,000 shi.</p>
<p>New Gate: Yesterday, the rice situation remained dull and stagnant. The opening in the early morning showed no improvement, and buyers were trending downwards. Rural firms had no appetite at all. Kunshan and Jiangyin rice stocks were still thick, and the overall market fell back by 1 or 2 jiao. Although the early and late rice arrivals from Changshu Xixin and Qingpu Liantang were lacking, the shop demand in this city was abnormally weak. Prices were short 1 jiao each. Glutinous rice was limited in quantity, with no price increase or decrease. Yang Lu pointed rice raised prices.</p>
<h3>Periodical Xiaojiao Foreign Firm Sells Off 1,000 Tons</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market situation yesterday was temporarily in a stable state. Generally, people believe that after the Japanese troops withdraw from Northeast China and Tianjin, local customer firms will surely handle grain smoothly. Once foreign rice is handled by customer firms, the market must be developed. However, in reality, customer firms still have no interest in inquiring, and this street's intent remains to wait and see, transactions are light, and market prices have not been seen immediately developed. The market only opened over 100 packages of Xiaojiao rice, priced at $10.015. Futures delivery did not open, and for new transactions, the Zhenshen Foreign Firm sold 1,000 tons of Xiaojiao for May delivery, priced at 5 taels, all of which were received by this street. The market price was not much different from the previous opening.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Rebound After Being Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month once presented a brisk image. Since foreign wheat quotations have risen by 60 or 70 jiao, and the market situation seems to be turning around, and the delivery of the previous month's warehouse receipts was not very plentiful, and people generally have this imagination, the market atmosphere became good. After the opening, both near and far periods rose by 20 to 30 fen or so from the end of the previous month. The May issue opened as usual, opening at 2 taels, 1 mace, and 1 fen, and then followed the decline of each month. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the gold price had still returned to within the 700 tael mark, and the market situation was not as optimistic as expected. People's hearts became depressed again, and the sales of downstream products must be strong to stabilize. As a result, this month was 5 li better than the end of the previous month, January was 2.5 li better, February was 5 li better, March was 2.5 li better, April was 7.5 li better, and May was 1.5 fen lower than the opening price.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Turns Weak in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market generally presented a stable image. Since foreign wheat quotations rebounded by about 60 or 70 jiao, and the market situation was slightly eased, after the opening, both near and far periods rose by 50 or 60 fen compared to the closing price of the previous month. However, by the time of each market in the afternoon, the market situation in each month showed signs of weakness. Since the Japanese troops had withdrawn, people generally believed that the problem was resolved. Moreover, what was withdrawn was a part, and it was found that Tianjin and Heilongjiang were being increased. For these reasons, there was no huge hope for future flour sales, and the lack of wheat was inevitable. As a result, this month was 2 fen better than the previous day, January was 3 fen better, February was 2 fen better, March was 4 fen better, April was 4 fen better, and May had not opened.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Raw Sugar and White Sugar Sales Are Also Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams showed that the price of Cuban spot sugar was 135, which was a continuous decrease of 1.25 compared to the previous telegram. The price of raw sugar in New York in December was 1.09, which was an increase of 1 cent. The price in March of next year was 1.08, which was a decrease of 2 cents. The price in May was 1.13, which was a decrease of 5 cents. The price in September was 1.26, also decreasing by 2 cents. The price of Java spot sugar remains unchanged. In the association's market trading session, Dutch sugar transactions were slightly brisk. The transaction price of 24th grade raw white sugar was 10 taels and 2 qian, and the price of high-quality goods was 10 taels and 3 qian. The price of 20th grade medium white sugar was 10 taels, the price of 18th grade was 9 taels and 9 qian, the price of fine white sugar was 10 taels and 2 qian, the price of cotton Dutch white sugar was 11 taels and 3 qian, the price of 8th grade Dutch red sugar was 8 taels and 4 qian, the price of 10th grade goods was 8 taels and 7 qian. The market prices are all firm and strong. Swire sugar transactions are slightly quiet. The B mark is 11 taels and 8 qian, the CW mark is 11 taels and 7 qian, the HX mark is 11 taels and 6 qian, and the HM mark is 11 taels and 4 qian. The need is very little, and the trend is flat and not surprising, but the B mark is relatively short of the door, and the market atmosphere is relatively strong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Factory-Processed Silk Merchants Sell Off at a Loss</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm silk market in this city still has no upward trend. It was found that overseas silk sales are still sluggish. The factory-processed silk telegrams show the price is small. The factory's cost is high and it is difficult to sell, but the demand is still strong. Each manufacturer needs to use funds for turnover and it is difficult to mortgage goods. They can only endure the pain and sell off at a loss. Yesterday, Xinfu and other firms imported 80 packages of white factory-processed silk in medium-quality spot goods and 30 packages of Sichuan yellow factory-processed silk. The price is still flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Precious Eyebrow Green Tea Exports to Europe Are Smooth and Successful</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this city, both foreign and local firms, saw strong interest in precious eyebrow green tea from English firms such as Qiahe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and Xiehe. Medium and low-quality goods were especially lively in sales. The total sales volume in the city reached over 800 boxes. Sales prices have not changed, but the Gongxi item has not been opened by the Russian Assistance Association, and the Baitu firm is also in stagnation. There are no continued transactions.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Lead Prices Open at 14 Taels for Imported Goods</p>
<p>Lead trading has been unusually sluggish lately. Although various traders have tried their best to sell, the environment is dangerous, resulting in very few actual transactions. Therefore, the recent trend is quite pessimistic, and the opening price is also unusually depressed. Yesterday, each load was estimated at only 13 taels and 9 qian, a decrease of 1 qian from the previous day. It was found that in addition to the 300 to 400 pieces opened by retail stores and this street, there were still no inquiries from export firms. According to insiders, the future development of lead is feared to have no great hope within the year.</p>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Telegraph Beijing</h3>
<p>Inquiring About Gu's Three Questions</p>
<p>Questions Regarding Changes in Negotiations with Japan</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan and others telegraphed Gu Weijun, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, yesterday, saying, "Minister Gu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, regarding the changes in negotiations with Japan, we have three questions to ask: (1) Reports state that the U.S. government firmly believes that the resolution of the Manchurian issue lies in direct negotiations between China and Japan and that both sides are acting moderately. At the same time, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu visited the ministry to discuss the Jinzhou and Tianjin issues, and there are also reports that Japanese diplomats in the north are in contact with the local authorities. Is this true? (2) Reports state that our government has instructed Ambassador Shi to agree to the League of Nations Council's proposal to establish a neutral zone in Jinzhou and has also instructed the military commander in Jinzhou to contact military observers from various countries. Military attachés from various countries are already in Jinzhou discussing the demarcation of the zone. Is this true? (3) If our country actually recognizes the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou to prevent direct conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops, then which country's troops will be stationed east of Jinzhou and under whose management will they be? The above three questions are extremely important. We respectfully request detailed answers to dispel public doubts. Awaiting your telegraphic reply." The telegram was signed by Zhu Qinglan, Chu Fucheng, Mu Xiangyue, Huang Yanpei, and Dong.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session Shanghai News</h3>
<p>All Delegates Unanimously Approve Mediation Methods</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin Telegraphs That He Will Return to Shanghai After the Election</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the dispute at the Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session had the potential to be resolved immediately after Hu Hanmin, Wu Chaochu, and others went to Hong Kong to mediate. However, a Hong Kong telegram stated that mediation had completely failed. We now know that the claim of failure is inaccurate. Last night, Hu and Wu telegraphed Shanghai, stating that after submitting three solutions, Deng Ziru, Xiao Focheng, Chen Jitang, and Li Zongren had already agreed to submit the Shanghai Peace Conference proposal, which had been overturned by the meeting on the 24th, to the conference for reconsideration and had taken on the task of communicating with the delegates. At the time, a small number of people still insisted on the original proposal, but after strenuous efforts, there were no more objections. Therefore, on the evening of the 29th, the three individuals who had withdrawn and the delegates returned to Guangzhou. Except for Sun, Hu, and Wu, everyone else returned to the provincial capital. Consequently, a plenary session was held at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 30th), and it was unanimously passed to accept the three mediation methods proposed by Hu, Wu, and others. Sun Ke then returned to Guangzhou yesterday afternoon to attend the meeting after the conference passed the three methods. Hu did not attend and remained in Hong Kong, awaiting the completion of the election before leaving Hong Kong and returning to Shanghai. The text of the telegram released by the Hu residence regarding the acceptance of the three mediation methods by the Plenary Session is as follows: (1) Regarding the election of Chiang Kai-shek as a Central Committee member, it is stated that there are no objections in order to strive for unity. (2) One hundred and twelve Central Committee members of the fourth session are selected from the first, second, and third sessions. (3) The remaining forty-four individuals are freely elected.</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Hu Hanmin, who went to Guangdong to mediate, telegraphed Wang Jingwei yesterday, reporting on the circumstances of this trip to Guangdong for mediation. The telegram arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. The original telegram roughly stated that Hanmin and Chaochu arrived in Guangzhou on the morning of the 29th. After paying respects to the late Gu Tingqin, they met with Deng Ziru, Xiao Focheng, Li Delin, Bai Jiansheng, Chen Bonan, and others. As a result, they agreed to accept the peace conference resolution as much as possible and agreed to explain the misunderstandings to the delegates. From the 30th onwards, the conference continued to meet and was scheduled to hold elections on the 1st. Hanmin and Chaochu felt that the mediation had been successful and returned to Hong Kong that evening. They will return to Shanghai with comrades Sun and Wu after the conference closes.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Municipal Federation of Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Petition in Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>Requesting Allocation of Firearms to Face the National Crisis Together</p>
<p>Adopting Public Opinion to Send Troops to Resist the Invaders</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Citizens dispatched representatives to petition in Beijing yesterday, requesting the issuance of military equipment. The entire volunteer army from each district bid farewell in full military attire and held a parade. The details of each aspect are recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition: The petition representatives of the Municipal Federation Volunteer Army were Wang Pingnan, Liu Zhongying, Wu Banxian, Sun Wenyi, Jiang Junyi, Chen Zemin, Qiu Jialiang, and seven others. They took the 7:00 AM Shanghai-Beijing express train to Beijing yesterday morning. The entire volunteer army from each district, in full military attire, and the committee members of each branch, totaling over 2,000 people, gathered at the North Station at 5:30 AM yesterday morning to bid farewell. After the farewell, they immediately formed ranks and held a parade. The route was from the North Station to Xinmin Road, Gonghe New Road, Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road, and through the North Henan Road of the Public Concession. Each squad returned to its respective association. The order was quite good, and the steps were uniform.</p>
<p>Departing for Beijing Yesterday Morning: The Municipal Federation of Citizens submitted a petition to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and the Director-General of Training, stating, "The petition is for publicly recommending representatives to petition in Beijing. The violent Japanese invaders have invaded and occupied the Northeast, causing our compatriots in the three provinces to become slaves. The ambition of the Japanese barbarians is unrelenting, and the nation is in dire peril, like being burned or drowned. International agreements are unyielding, and violence and power are incomprehensible. The only plan for now is to strive for self-rescue, which may turn the crisis into safety. There is truly no other good plan. Our national populace has already been united in advocating for sending troops to resist the invaders. We admire that the Central Government has already adopted public opinion. This can be called the unity of the people, with no division between the top and bottom. Each individual is responsible, which has always been the case. Destroying those Japanese barbarians is a matter of course. The Shanghai citizens, nurtured by the culture of the Party-state, have a deep understanding and feeling. They are all willing to immerse the Fusang [Japan] with full enthusiasm and annihilate those ugly types with countless bullets. In response to the needs of the times, we urgently organized a volunteer army. Within one month, 3,000 people have signed up. They practice at the crowing of the rooster and have aspirations that reach the clouds. They come to the capital to request a task, with loyalty and indignation piercing the sun. We respectfully recommend representatives to petition in Beijing, earnestly requesting permission to organize, promulgate guidelines, and allocate firearms to facilitate active training, so that they may jointly face the national crisis."</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents to Hold a General Meeting</h3>
<p>Meeting to Be Held for Three Days Starting Sunday</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Regions Converge in Shanghai</p>
<p>Discussing Ways to Counter Chinese Actions</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, China has been unanimously boycotting Japanese goods. In just a few months, Japanese trade in China has decreased by over 70 million yuan in goods shipped to China. Along the Yangtze River, from Sichuan to Jingzhen, Japanese merchants have withdrawn to Shanghai due to the lack of business. All women and children have been sent back to their country, while many men remain in Shanghai. Therefore, the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai has not only not decreased but has also increased. Since the Tianjin Incident, Japanese ruffians have also considered making trouble in Shanghai, but they have not dared to do so due to our strict defense, which they consider regrettable. Currently, Japanese residents in Shanghai have successively withdrawn from Chongqing, Chengdu, Yichang, Shashi, Changsha, Hankou, Wuhu, Suzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Fujian, and other places, concentrating in one corner, unwilling to give up trade with China. Suddenly, they are advocating for a general meeting of all Japanese people in China to discuss ways to counter Chinese boycotts. How to restore commerce on the Yangtze River? How to support Japanese residents in China? And various other secret proposals. The preparations were first made by Japanese residents in various places in Shanghai. On the morning of the 30th, the inaugural meeting of the All-China Japanese Conference was held at the Japanese Club in Hongkou. Hundreds of representatives attended at the time. It is reported that the conference resolved to send telegrams to various places, urging representatives to come to Shanghai quickly to hold a general meeting. After discussion, it was decided to hold a meeting for three consecutive days, starting on December 6th and closing on the 8th. The reception center for representatives arriving in Shanghai has already been established. Yesterday, according to telegrams from various places, representatives who have already departed for Shanghai include Koyama Teiichi, Chairman of the Fengtian Youth Association Alliance; Mr. Murachi, Chairman of the Qingdao Youth Association; Mr. Sato, representative of Japanese residents in Shandong; and Mr. Shimizu, representative of Changchun. In addition, representatives from Fuzhou, Xiamen, Jiaoji Railway, and others have all telegraphed their departure and are expected to arrive in Shanghai by tomorrow or the day after. It is reported that after the meeting on the 6th, the conference will use the name of the All-China Japanese Residents Conference to submit its proposals to the Japanese Minister to China and will also send representatives back to their country with the resolutions, requesting their government to implement them. According to a certain gentleman familiar with Japanese affairs, this economic severance has dealt a major blow to the Japanese. In just over two months, the Japanese people's years of business in China have been eradicated, causing great losses and pain. Today, there are already signs of military action, and Japanese residents will take further steps to seek permanent benefits. Therefore, this All-China Japanese Conference in Shanghai deserves special attention.</p>
<h3>Oppose the Demarcation of a Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>Gao Guanwu and Others Offer Opinions</p>
<p>Gao Guanwu and others sent a public telegram, stating, "To all newspapers, agencies, and public organizations, we have investigated the customary practices of war. When the outcome of a battle is uncertain, the intervention of a third country for mediation or arbitration may result in the establishment of a neutral zone. However, the violent Japanese, taking advantage of our natural and man-made disasters, unilaterally attacked and fought without restraint, implementing invasion and seizing our three northeastern provinces. Except for the defensive setbacks of Ma and the brigade, the Liaoning and Jilin armies have not retaliated at all. If we follow the League of Nations and demarcate the area near Jinzhou as a neutral zone, it would be tantamount to admitting that Liaoning and Jilin are lands we have lost due to defeat in war. Such a stipulation is an insult to all the citizens of our country and is absolutely intolerable. Even the barbaric tribes of Africa, once they form a tribe, will resist foreign insults. How can our civilized China be slaughtered at will? The plan for now is to unanimously urge the government to gather strength, unite the top and bottom, and actively prepare: (1) Rectify the police reserve teams and public security teams in all provinces and counties across the country, as well as local militias, to protect the local area and maintain order to prevent bandit disturbances. (2) Deploy the troops from nearby coastal provinces, concentrate their strength, and defend key passes to prepare for resistance. (3) Awaken the public to organize volunteer armies, transportation teams, and rescue teams for use. (4) Recruit retired soldiers to train military officers and talents for dispatch. (5) Recruit local Red Spear Society and Lian Zhuang Hui, intensify training for replenishment. The above points have received little attention from our government, and there is no overall statistic. Divided, their strength is weak; united, their strength is strong. All troops are the armed forces of the people. The top and bottom are of one mind, jointly facing the national crisis. Only then can there be hope of saving the misfortune. These are our foolish considerations, and we humbly contribute our humble opinions. We hope they will be considered and adopted." The telegram was signed by Gao Guanwu, Hong Zhongkai, Qi Wenhua, Xu Baozhang, Chen Weixin, He Menghua, Zheng Shaochen, Chen Zuyi, Shen Yuchun, Ding Bingkun, Xu Huiren, Jiang Xilin, Qiu Peixin, Hu Gongliang, Cheng Shiluo, Yang Chao, Ding Dingyi, Bao Dounan, Yuan Yangshan, Gu Zengwei, Zhang Desen, Wang Keming, Bi Yaohua, Zhou Gangshan, Yang Qingjing, Zhou Jianwu, Jin Luwang, Ren Datong, Zhou Mingqi, Hou Gongran, Wu Fengshan, He Zhong, Sun Qiqing, Nie Xitang, and others.</p>

<h3>Youth Aid-Ma Group</h3>

Yesterday and the day before, over two hundred more people swore oaths and filled out forms to join the group. After detailed inquiries by the registration division, 149 people were approved to join the group, many of whom are military and police personnel. As of yesterday, the total number of members participating in the group is 454. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the group held its sixth cadre meeting at its office in southern Shanghai. Zhang Shaojie chaired the meeting, and Gan Jue recorded the minutes. After the customary rituals, the chairman first reported on the work progress in the past ten days, followed by a discussion on the screening of members. It was resolved to organize a Screening Committee for Members, with the training division collecting one person from each division and group to be responsible for the review. Due to the imminent departure date, the group is conducting fundraising from all walks of life. A citizen, Gong Shenghua, voluntarily pledged to the group the land license of the Municipal Land Bureau at No. 18, Wangziwei, 6th Tu, southern Shanghai, area of one mu and nine fen [unit of area], located on Gaochangli Lilimiao Road, near Longhua, donating half of the selling price to the group. Other groups, such as the Bank Association, Zeng Linkanghou, etc., were contacted by the group leader, Zhang Shaojie, regarding departure donations. The results were also very satisfactory. The group is scheduled to invite the press at 2:00 PM today and hold the final member farewell meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow to discuss various important issues related to the departure.</p>

If you insist on going your own way, the division of the nation will not be forgiven by the Chinese people. Urgent words, we hope you will consider. Chinese National Diplomacy Support Association, Eastern Seal." (2) Telegram to the Withdrawing Representatives: "To the withdrawing representatives, forwarded through the South China Daily in Hong Kong, at this moment, the most urgent matter is the national crisis. Your determination and actions are admired by our people. If those who destroy the peace succeed, then Wang Jingwei will be reckless, and you will follow the Iron Army and die on the battlefield, which is a great cause for you for thousands of years.

<h3>Establishment of the Anti-Japanese Association's Patrol Teams</h3>
<p>Water Patrol Team: Four Squads</p>
<p>Vehicle Patrol Team: One Squad</p>
<p>Water Patrol Team: The Inspection Department of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this city, after investigating unscrupulous merchants with cold blood, in light of the strictness of inspection work, finds that it is extremely difficult to transport Japanese goods privately by land. In order to avoid attention and escape the law, they do not hesitate to use the dark of night and switch to water transport. Although each precinct and team has been urged to strictly investigate, they suffer from having too few people and are unable to dispatch enough. In particular, it is impossible to investigate and seize goods transported by water at night. In order to step up its work, the department has specially obtained approval from the Standing Committee to organize four water patrol teams, which will provide their own multiple ships and be stationed in places such as Nan Shi's Rihui Port, Zhabei's Lao Port, Shanghai West's Xiaoshadu, and Hongkou. They will specialize in the inspection of Japanese goods on the water. It is reported that Zhang Yaoming has been appointed as the chief captain, and Zhang Huijun, Qian Dongye, Pu Zhiliang, and Cheng Xiwu have been appointed as captains. They will actively prepare from today and are expected to start work within days.</p>
<p>Vehicle Patrol Team: The Inspection Department of the Anti-Japanese Association, recently, in light of the intense work, in addition to ordering each team and precinct to strictly seize Japanese goods day and night, and in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from transporting Japanese goods privately at night, has specially organized a vehicle patrol team. The chief secretary of the department will concurrently serve as the captain. Each night, he will gather many inspectors, all driving automobiles, and patrol strictly throughout the city all night long. If they encounter Japanese goods, they will seize them in order to prevent anyone from escaping. It is reported that the team has already been organized and will soon implement inspections.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Circular Letter Refusing to Load and Transport Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the Anti-Japanese Association stating that there are still instances of barges or automobiles loading and transporting Japanese goods in the Huangpu River and on the roads. Yesterday, it specially sent letters to the barge transport, coal and stone barge transport, and automobile transport trade associations, stating that they should all refuse from now on. The two letters are recorded below: (1) Letter to the barge transport and coal and stone barge transport trade associations, saying: On the 30th of this month, we received a letter approved by the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stating that, according to repeated confidential reports, the source of enemy goods is often unloaded in the Huangpu River and transported by barges to the east and west of the Huangpu River and to various locations along the Suzhou River for landing. We should strictly investigate and prohibit barge owners from loading and transporting such goods. Many parties have come to the Chamber with these concerns. After inspecting the inspection work, we have roughly deployed on land, but there is no prevention on the water, which has resulted in enemy goods still being active. After investigating the cause, we find that if there are no barges to load and transport the goods, how can they circulate? Therefore, the key to the plan is to stop the transportation of goods on behalf of others. After the twenty-third standing committee meeting, it was decided to send a letter to your association to instruct the barge transport trade association to strictly prohibit all barge owners from loading and transporting enemy goods again. If anyone dares to deliberately violate this, they will be severely punished according to the law of joint liability of unscrupulous merchants. The record is on file. Correspondingly, the record is sent to you and you are requested to investigate and forward it accordingly. Approved. We have investigated that the violent Japanese are using military force to occupy our Eastern Provinces, and recently bombed Tianjin, with their violence and coercion reaching their extreme. Anyone with a conscience is filled with anger and determined to avenge this unbearable humiliation. Now, it is said that barge gangs are openly loading and transporting enemy goods in the Huangpu River and secretly selling them in the market. Such people are devoid of conscience and are public enemies in the voices of resisting Japanese goods. It is imperative to strictly prohibit this. In accordance with the previous letter, we are notifying you to investigate and immediately instruct all affiliated businesses that they must not transport these Japanese goods in the future. If anyone still covets petty profits and secretly transports them, they will be punished according to the law once discovered, and this Chamber will not cover for them. Please forward this instruction to everyone for compliance. (2) Letter to the rental automobile trade association, saying: On the 30th of this month, we received a letter approved by the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stating that, according to repeated confidential reports, various automobile companies in this city often provide vehicles for Japanese businesses and Chinese unscrupulous merchants to transport enemy goods. Please prohibit and severely punish them. Our Chamber's duty officers have also seen this situation frequently. However, due to the speed of the cars, there is no way to intervene. After the twenty-third standing committee meeting, it was decided to send a letter to your association to instruct the automobile transport trade association to strictly prohibit all car companies from transporting enemy goods on behalf of others. If anyone dares to deliberately violate this, they will be punished according to the law of joint liability of unscrupulous merchants. The record is on file. Correspondingly, the record is sent to you and you are requested to investigate and forward it accordingly. Approved. This matter concerns the great plan of resisting Japan and saving the nation. We are sending a copy of the letter to you and urge you to forward it to all automobile companies, instructing them to refuse to load and transport enemy goods in the future.

<h3>Methods for Substituting Japanese Goods' Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Divided into Long-Term and Short-Term Categories</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation yesterday sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce saying: In response to your letter pushing for the acceptance of the letter from the Yantai General Chamber of Commerce requesting the association's articles of association and inquiring about the established methods for substituting raw materials, it is mainly divided into long-term and short-term categories. (1) Each factory should provide a detailed list of the quantity and name of Japanese raw materials needed each year. After each industry has gathered the information, it should be ordered from the West on the one hand, and on the other hand, it should find ways to improve and replace the materials with those available in the country. (2) Each should consider the raw materials needed by its own industry. If funds are raised to form a raw material factory, the products produced will be used by the shareholder factories, or the existing raw materials will be invested in cooperation with them to expand and increase production. In accordance with the previous letter, we are enclosing the articles of association with this letter for your reference and forwarding.</p>

<h3>Finance Committee Postpones Meeting</h3>
<p>Rescheduled for the Sixth</p>
<p>Beijing Telegram: The Finance Committee and the Economic Committee were originally scheduled to hold their second meeting at the Central Bank of China in Shanghai on the 2nd. Due to official business, government members were unable to attend. It was decided to reschedule the second meeting of the Finance Committee to be held at the Central Bank of China building in Shanghai at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month. The second meeting of the Economic Committee will continue at 2:00 p.m. It is reported that the reason for moving the meeting to Shanghai this time is that most of the committee members from the banking, business, and academic circles of the two committees are in Shanghai, and it is more convenient to discuss financial issues in Shanghai. It has not yet been decided whether to hold meetings in Shanghai for a long time in the future. It is reported that among the members of the two committees, there are important proposals regarding the reorganization of finance and economic construction that have been sent to the preparatory office for discussion at this meeting. The members in Beijing are now scheduled to travel to Shanghai by train on the evening of the 5th. It has not yet been decided whether Chairman Chiang will travel to Shanghai to attend. If he is unable to attend, Song Ziwen will attend on his behalf. The League of Nations Economic Committee has hired six experts, Liu Men, Ding Gaode, Xi Weijing, Deli, Haas, and Aojingju, to come to China. They are scheduled to depart from Geneva in the middle of this month and are expected to arrive in Shanghai before the end of December. All receptions are currently being rushed to prepare a reception office in Shanghai by the preparatory office of the Economic Committee, which will be jointly organized by various relevant agencies and established in the middle of this month. Shen Chang, a member of the Daohuai Committee, and Xu Kai, a deputy engineer, have been appointed to make technical contacts with famous experts and provide consultations at any time. It is reported that after the arrival of the experts in China, a design committee office will be established in Shanghai.

It will take at least six to eight months to stay in China.</p>
<h3>Transporting Silver for Export</h3>
<p>Customs Has Been Ordered to Prohibit</p>
<p>And Separately Notified the Banking and Money Industries</p>
<p>Local finance has been affected by the export of silver, and the money market has become increasingly tight. Although the Banking and Money Trade Associations have repeatedly convened emergency meetings to discuss prohibition measures, the biggest key to the tight money market is that it is affected by the current situation. Exporting silver is only for the purpose of regulating finance in various places, and there is no situation of being used by the enemy. Therefore, it is difficult to absolutely prohibit it. Now we know that Finance Minister Song Ziwen believes that although the tight money market is said to be related to the insecurity of the current situation, it is also in conflict with the export of silver. Therefore, he issued a general order to customs offices in various places on the previous day (30th) to prohibit the declaration of silver for export. If it is indeed for the purpose of regulating finance, it must also be thoroughly investigated to avoid unscrupulous merchants from cheating, coveting small national profits, and harming the national finance. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to declare for export. The Shanghai Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office has recently instructed the Tax Affairs Department to comply with it, and has separately notified the Banking and Money Trade Associations for reference and investigation.</p>

<h3>Freezing of Rivers in Northern China</h3>
<p>Discussions to Increase Freight Rates on Tianjin-Bound Ships The weather in North China is gradually getting colder, and the Baihe River in Tianjin is now freezing. Shanghai-bound ships to Tianjin must be guided by icebreakers to enter the port. Therefore, the British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, and the Chinese merchant China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in this city held a special meeting to discuss the implementation of ice river freight rates from December 1st. After deliberation, the price of foreign cloth and cotton yarn increased from 16.5 taels to 18 taels per ton. The price of wheat flour increased from 1.9 cents to 2.1 cents per bag. The price of groceries increased by 20% per ton across the board. Yesterday, all the guest families were notified.</p>

<p>Shanghai Patrol Cars</p>
<p>Each Car is Equipped with Wireless Telephone</p>
<p>Orders Can Be Received Within Seconds</p>
<p>More Telephones are Set Up in Various Places as Auxiliary Support</p>
<p>Kidnappings by Bandits May Be Reduced</p>
<p>The new wireless telephone patrol cars and one hundred and forty police telephones of the Public Concession Police have been put into use yesterday (30th). From now on, criminals will see that the police's detective patrols are becoming more effective and that it is not easy to escape the law by committing crimes. The Public Works Department spent about 200,000 yuan to prepare this equipment this spring. The police officers have now been trained to maturity. The effectiveness of its use may mean that London and New York will no longer be the only ones to have this capability. There are now a total of twelve patrol cars, with one patrol car assigned to each police district. Each car shed is equipped with an indoor antenna and a wireless telephone receiver and amplifier. In addition, a wireless telephone transmitter and ordinary police telephones are installed on the top floor of the Public Works Department as the management agency. In the event of serious cases such as armed robbery, kidnapping, or theft, after residents within the boundary or various police stations and patrol officers notify the management agency by telephone, a wireless telephone will be issued immediately, and nearby patrol cars will rush to arrest the criminals. Residents can connect to the management agency by telephone in at most five minutes, and patrol cars can receive orders in seconds. After all the police telephones are installed, there will be one hundred and forty units to assist patrol cars and provide alarm and command transmission. Each police station has a central office that manages the police telephones in that district. The management personnel of the police station only need to press an electric key, and each telephone will ring loudly and emit a red light. Nearby patrol police can hear the sound or see the red light and go to answer the telephone.</p>
<h3>Shen Chengfu Surrenders Himself</h3>
<p>Admitting Business Failure and Debts</p>
<p>Without Any Fraudulent Behavior</p>
<p>Taihe Still Accuses Him of Embezzlement</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Zhihe Yongji Money Shop, the shop's manager Shen Yingxiang and his son Shen Chengfu, the compradore of the British merchant Taihe Foreign Firm, fled without a trace. The creditors generally believed that the Shen family and his son were suspected of colluding to defraud money, and filed lawsuits with the First Special District Court, which issued arrest warrants. Shen Yingxiang was arrested in Shangyu by Geng Debiao, a Chinese detective of the General Patrol Room, and escorted to the Special Court. Shen was ordered to provide a guarantor who could be called at any time and released on bail pending trial. However, Shen Chengfu has not been apprehended to this day. Recently, Shen Chengfu believed that all his debts were due to business failure and that there was no fraudulent behavior, so he returned to Shanghai a few days ago and lived at No. 572 Laoxifu Road in the French Concession. He surrendered himself to the General Patrol Room at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. After investigation by the Patrol Room, it was found that the only party who had filed a complaint against Shen Chengfu with the Patrol Room was Taihe Foreign Firm, accusing him of embezzlement of 3,451,000 yuan. Therefore, Shen was escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One at 9:00 a.m., where Judge Xu Jashi of the Criminal Court presided over the interrogation. Lawyer Ru Baoyi represented Taihe Foreign Firm, and Lawyer Lu Xingyuan represented Wu Linkun Lawyer represented Wanlai Foreign Firm and some of the creditors in the money industry. Shen Chengfu also hired two lawyers to defend him. According to the Patrol Room Lawyer Ru, the Patrol Room is now prosecuting Shen for breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Law. The details can be stated by Ke Pudeng, a representative of Taihe Foreign Firm. However, the detailed accounts of this case have not yet been clarified, so please allow a postponement. Subsequently, Ke Pudeng stated that he is now accusing Shen Chengfu of embezzlement, because his company delivered 20,000 bales of cotton worth 2.7 million taels to Shen, but he embezzled all the money received and paid with a kind of worthless bank note. Judge Xu asked Ke whether he had delivered the goods to Shen and Shen had paid the foreign firm. Ke replied that it was for a term of sixty days. The cotton we gave was a credit loan. Then, Nai Xu testified that Shen had no guarantor in his firm, but he had 130,000 taels in cash and property guarantees. Questioned, Shen Chengfu confessed that the plaintiff said that I embezzled, but it was actually a loss in the cotton business, and I used the money I received to make up for the previous losses, which was completely in accordance with the firm's transfer, and that the departure on August 19 was to collect accounts outside, not to escape. The defendant's lawyer then stated that this case is a matter of accounts and belongs to civil matters. The criminal prosecution of embezzlement cannot be established. Moreover, when the defendant left on August 19, it was still within the sixty-day settlement period, and the plaintiff did not wait until the sixty-day settlement date before accusing Shen of embezzlement to the patrol room. How did the plaintiff know that the defendant wanted to embezzle at that time? Therefore, he requested permission to post bail. Judge Xu Jashi reviewed the confession and ordered that the case be adjourned for a retrial.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Red Pills Transported to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Public Security Bureau Cracked the Case</p>
<p>Hong Shaopu Was Arrested Pending Transfer</p>
<p>The Detective Team of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau learned last month that someone was privately transporting a large batch of red pills from Shanghai to Hangzhou, which were transported by Huitong Transportation Company and delivered to Jiang Shijie, an employee of the Hangzhou Guohua Soap Company. They went to secretly wait. When Jiang Shijie went to pick up the goods at the appointed time, he was detained and four iron barrels of red pills worth more than 10,000 yuan were seized. He was taken to the Public Security Bureau along with the pills. Under questioning, it was learned that the iron barrels were entrusted by the Shanghai Meihua Soap Company to the Shanghai Huitong Transportation Company to be transported to the Hangzhou Huitong Branch for unloading. They went to arrest Chen Zaixin, the manager of the Huitong Branch, and handed him over to the Hangzhou Local Court Procuratorate for investigation. On one hand, the Procuratorate sent a letter to the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau requesting that personnel be sent to Shanghai to arrest Hong Shaopu, the general manager of the Shanghai Huitong Company, a native of Suzhou, and bring him to justice for questioning. On the 27th of last month, Ding Wenbing, the captain of the third team of the Detective Team, took the document to Shanghai, investigated and found it to be true. At 10:30 a.m. on the previous day, he reported to the Huisit patrol room and asked for assistance in arresting Hong Shaopu. The patrol room forwarded the request to the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. Hong was arrested by the Huitong Company at No. 233 Jielu and taken into the patrol room. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court. According to Patrol Room Lawyer Wang Yaotang, the representative of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau presented the official document of the Public Security Bureau when reporting to the Patrol Room yesterday. Today, he suddenly presented the official document of the Local Court Procuratorate. Checking the date of the court document, it was November 28, but the defendant Hong Shaopu was arrested yesterday (30th). The date is wrong. This point should be noted. Then, Ding Wenbing, the team leader of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, submitted the official document requesting extradition, and said that as for the date, it may have been a misunderstanding, because after arriving in Shanghai on the 27th, I reported to Hangzhou by long-distance telephone that the person had been identified, and Hangzhou had mistaken him for having been arrested. Questioned, the defendant Hong Shaopu hired two lawyers, Ye Fikang and Zhao Weiding, to defend him. Judge Feng Shide ordered Hong to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for two days, pending verification of the official documents.</p>

<h3>Reactionary Printed Matter Implicates Widow</h3>
<p>Various Businesses Jointly Guarantee Shen Tangshi</p>
<p>Shen Tangshi, a widow from Wuxi, is 42 years old. Her husband died many years ago, leaving behind a nine-year-old daughter. Because of her determination to remain chaste, she opened the Taiheng Confectionery at No. 538 Pushan Road, Zhabei, employing one employee and one apprentice. At 10:00 a.m. on the previous day (27th), an old junk dealer suddenly appeared, peddling old newspapers and books, asking for three yuan per load and eighty cash per catty. Because she was illiterate and greedy for the cheap price, she bought seventy catties for wrapping candies and other items. The neighbors all saw it. At that time, the shop employee Yao Heting went to pick up goods. When he returned to the shop, he saw that the old newspapers and books bought by the landlady were mostly reactionary publications. He told the landlady that they could not be used for wrapping, so as not to cause trouble. He then told the apprentice to throw all the waste books into the nearby river. Unexpectedly, they floated downstream to the Yingpan Bridge, where they were retrieved by a Jiangbei dugout boat. Seeing that the waste paper could be sold for money, they spread it out on the boat shed. Later, a patrol police officer from the Tanjiachiao Police Station in the Fourth District saw it and arrested two dugout boat owners. When asked about the source of the waste books, they did not know either. When asked of the neighbors, they said that they were discarded by Yongtaiheng. Chen, the police officer, was reported and he went to Yongtaiheng and arrested the landlady Shen Tangshi and escorted her to the Fourth District General Office. After a brief interrogation by Director Zhou, because the case was related to reactionary publications, he immediately transferred it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for handling. However, the nearby stores, such as Yongdagong South Goods Store and more than ten other households, knew that Shen Tangshi was living peacefully and was an ignorant woman who suffered this injustice. Therefore, they jointly elected a representative, Zhou Rong, to report to the Fourth Branch of the Citizens' Association, and affixed their seals in a joint petition to the Public Security Bureau, requesting bail. Party member Zhou Wenbing also reported to Wu Zhen, the executive member of the Second District Party Headquarters, requesting him to prove and rescue her. However, it is heard that the Public Security Bureau has transferred the case to the Garrison Command for review.</p>
<h3>Four Organizations</h3>
<p>Discuss Anti-Japanese Entertainment Gathering</p>
<p>Expand Propaganda Campaign</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2 PM, four organizations, including the Chinese Students Returned from Japan Association, the Northeast Natives Association in Shanghai, the Shanghai Private Elementary School Teachers Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and the Shanghai Drama Troupe Federation, jointly discussed the Anti-Japanese Entertainment Gathering at the Kun Fan Girls' Middle School on Mei Bai Ge Road. Each organization sent five or six representatives, totaling more than twenty people, including Shi Tonggang, Luo Jianbing, Chen Di'ai, Zhao Ming, Ma Zhangnan, and others. Cheng Ming was publicly elected as chairman, and Chen Di'ai as the secretary. After the opening ceremony, the chairman reported, stating that the current international situation is deteriorating daily. The League of Nations is even helping Japanese imperialism to invade our country. Recently, they have been advocating sending international police to China, which is a prelude to imperialism jointly controlling China. If we are not self-aware and even propose a neutral zone in Jinzhou, our compatriots will soon face death. For the sake of saving the country from danger and for our survival, we are initiating this meeting to fully expose the atrocities of Japanese imperialism in China, to inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, and to expand the anti-imperialist movement to divide China. I hope everyone will express their insightful opinions and work together to plan the way forward. As a result, the following resolutions were made: (1) The organizing committee will be divided into three departments: General Affairs, Propaganda, and Entertainment. General Affairs will be the responsibility of the Private Elementary School Teachers Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the Northeast Natives Association in Shanghai. The Propaganda Department will be the responsibility of the Students Returned from Japan Association. The Entertainment Committee will be the responsibility of the Shanghai Drama Troupe Federation. (2) The budget for the organizing committee is temporarily set at 300 yuan, to be shared by each organization. (3) The performance venue is planned to be at the Ningbo Natives Association in Shanghai, and the dates are set for December 11th, 12th, and 13th, a total of three days. The General Affairs Department is responsible for contacting them. (4) 5,000 tickets will be printed for the entertainment gathering, with 1,200 tickets given away as complimentary tickets, and the remaining 3,800 tickets will be divided into one-yuan and half-yuan tickets. Half of the ticket revenue will be used to reward the soldiers on the front lines in the Northeast, and the other half will be used to fund the anti-Japanese movement. (5) The content of the dramas will include more than ten programs such as "Liberation," "On the Banks of the Yitong River," "Bloodstained Clothes," and "The Night Before," all of which are excellent dramas to inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. Other programs will be added temporarily. (6) The office location will be located in the Huadong Apartment on Malang Road in the French Concession. Every day from 4 PM to 6 PM will be the gathering time for work. The other items were also discussed in detail. The meeting adjourned around 6 PM.</p>

<h3>Using Hundred-Yuan Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Rice Store Unknowingly Accepts It</p>
<p>All Those Involved Are Detained</p>
<p>Shen Guijin, a worker from Changzhou at the Tianzhang Paper Mill at 408 Yangshupu Road, on the morning of the 26th of last month, along with the factory's gatekeeper Shu Linshun, also from Changzhou, used a Central Bank of China hundred-yuan counterfeit note to buy a担 (dan, a unit of weight) of rice, costing 14.6 yuan, from the Dinghe Rice Store at 343 on the same road, and sent it to the factory. The remaining money was given to Shu Linshun to take away. Unexpectedly, the note was given to a money shop by Dinghe Rice Store the other day, which discovered that it was counterfeit and immediately returned it. Later, it was sent to the Shanghai Bank, but it was also rejected. Unable to redeem it at the Central Bank of China, the teller examined it and found that it was a counterfeit made by using a genuine five-yuan note, and cleverly removing and pasting the red pattern in the middle, making it difficult to distinguish the truth immediately unless one was very careful. Therefore, the rice store reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which sent detective Zhong Deshou to the Tianzhang Paper Mill to arrest Shen and Shu. Xie Bingyao (also from Changzhou), a suspect, was also brought to the police station. According to Shen Guijin's confession, the counterfeit note was given to him by his cohabiting friend Zhang Ruigen to buy rice for him. The detectives then went to 254 Pingliang Road to arrest Zhang, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. The police chief ordered them to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, the third defendant, Xie Bingyao, was not involved in the use of the counterfeit note, but was suspected of informing Zhang Ruigen to escape, but there was no concrete evidence. The hundred-yuan Central Bank of China counterfeit note was presented for inspection, followed by Song Deji, the representative of Dinghe Rice Store, explaining the situation, and stating that his store and Tianzhang Paper Mill were employer-employee relationships, and that he knew the defendant Shu Linshun and did not suspect that the note was counterfeit. Shen and Shu both testified, stating that they did not know that the note was counterfeit and that all the money had been taken by Zhang. They asked for leniency. Xie Bingyao testified that he knew nothing about the case and did not inform Zhang Ruigen to escape, and retained lawyer Fan Gang for his defense. Judge Shen Bingrong verified the confessions and ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Station Railway Police</h3>
<p>Solved a Major Hotel Theft Case in Hangzhou</p>
<p>On November 26th, at the Hangzhou Lakeside Hangzhou Hotel, two guests dressed in luxurious clothes, named Zhan Shusheng and Liu Binglai, checked into Room 22. They stayed for two days and behaved generously, appearing to be officials, so they were not suspected of anything. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 28th, taking advantage of the hotel owner's wife being ill and her husband, Yu Shaofu, going to the hospital, the two men pried open the door lock of the hotel owner's room and used knives to cut open the suitcases in the room, stealing all the cash of more than 300 silver dollars in the suitcases, as well as a large amount of silk clothing, silver tripods, and silver shields. No one noticed. The next morning, the two guests settled their room bills and left the hotel calmly. However, the waiter noticed that the large rattan suitcase and two suitcases they were carrying were unusually heavy, unlike when they first arrived. He then went to their room to investigate and found a copper nail ring left behind. He also checked the hotel owner's room and saw that the door seemed to have been opened. He rushed to the hospital to inform the hotel owner, Yu Shaofu, who returned to the hotel to inspect and found that all the boxes and money were empty. He then realized that he had been stolen from. However, the two guests had disappeared. He immediately reported to the Hangzhou Railway Police Department and the Hangzhou local authorities to request an investigation. The Hangzhou Section Police Department immediately notified the Shanghai South Station Railway Police Department by telephone. Police Chief Zhuang learned of the situation and immediately secretly dispatched Police Sergeant Wang Yubin and a police officer to wait at the Xinlonghua Station for the Hangzhou morning train to arrive and board the train to conduct a secret investigation. They saw two suspicious guests. Because the train was moving, it was inconvenient to take action, so they directly monitored them. When the train arrived at the Shanghai South Station, the two guests were ordering a porter to carry their rattan suitcases and suitcases off the train and out of the station. The police officers immediately stepped forward to stop and interrogate them. The guests initially appeared calm and claimed to be from a government organization. However, when they were asked to open the suitcases for inspection, they found silver shields and women's clothing. After further investigation, their speech became evasive. They were then taken to the police station for strict interrogation, where they confessed to the theft. The police station immediately telegraphed the Hangzhou Section Police Department, which informed the hotel owner, who came to Shanghai by night train upon hearing the news and went to the police station. He identified the seized stolen goods as his lost items. The two suspects were also identified as the hotel guests from the day before. He also stated that there had been many major theft cases in Hangzhou hotels recently, but none of them had been solved. He requested that the suspects be handed over to the Hangzhou local authorities for strict investigation of all cases. The police station then approved the hotel owner Yu Shaofu to return to Hangzhou and obtain an official document from the Hangzhou Police Department and send a police officer to Shanghai yesterday to take the two suspects and the stolen goods to Hangzhou for trial.</p>
<h3>Five People Fell into the Huangpu River, Four Rescued</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, in the Huangpu River at the Jiangtian Wharf in Nanshi, a ferry boat was carrying many passengers. Among them was an old accountant, over fifty years old, from Ningbo, who worked at the Dexiang Grain Store at the northern end of Maojia Lane, Doushi Street. He was also carrying a sample bag and was going to Pudong to sample at a foreign firm. Unexpectedly, as the ferry was approaching the shore in Pudong, due to the large number of people and the rapid tide, the boat became unstable. In an instant, a total of five people fell into the Huangpu River. The boatmen and others tried their best to rescue them, and four people were rescued. However, the old accountant from Dexiang Grain Store drowned. Afterwards, the store sent people to try to find the body, but it has not yet been recovered.</p>

<h3>Trial of the Suspects in the Weng Ajiao Case</h3>
<p>Weng Ajiao, also known as Wang A, from Ningbo, was hacked to death by enemies leading their followers with axes in the eastern wing room on the upper floor of No. 10 Yuqing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, in the French Concession on the 17th of last month. Now, detectives Jin Jiulin and Zhen Yumin from the Criminal Investigation Unit have learned that the suspects were hiding in a tea shop at No. 651 Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. They went to arrest Zhang Ruiting (also known as Zhang Gezi from Yangzhou), Shuang Fang (from Zhenjiang), Xiao Guifang (from Danyang), and others, and found an axe. They were taken to the police station for further investigation. All the details were reported in detail. In the afternoon, the police sent Zhang and the other two to the First Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Xiong Hui interrogated them. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, explained the case, stating that the defendants still had accomplices who had not been apprehended, and requested that the hearing be adjourned for further investigation. When questioned, Zhang and the other three testified that they were playing mahjong there that night and would not dare to commit murder. Their other words were evasive. They also retained lawyer Zhu Dianqing for their defense. Judge Xiong ordered the adjournment of the hearing and remanded the defendants in custody.</p>
<h3>The Premature Lamb Fetus at Nine Acres</h3>
<p>Sensational Hearing for a While</p>
<p>It Was Done by Well-Wishers</p>
<p>Around 6 PM last night, two strange fetuses resembling small horses were suddenly discovered at the entrance of the Baosheng Pregnancy Preservation Hospital at No. 125 Luxiangyuan Road, Nine Acres in both cities. This immediately caused a sensation far and wide, and people brought the old and the young to rush to see it. Immediately, the area around Kaiming Lane was crowded with onlookers, and traffic was almost cut off. Some said they had witnessed it being discarded by the hospital, while others said that someone had secretly discarded a premature lamb fetus there to deliberately alarm people. There were many different theories, and no one could agree. Upon hearing the news, the reporter rushed to inquire among the neighbors. Yang Yuhai, the police officer stationed at post No. 1511, who was standing there, said that when the crowd gathered to watch, he pushed through the crowd and saw two bloody fetuses with horse faces and sheep feet, about seven or eight inches long, discarded next to the sewer under the steps of No. 125. When asked, the Baosheng Hospital completely denied it. According to the doctors at the hospital, a woman had been admitted to the hospital three days ago and gave birth to a boy. It has been three days since then, and no one has come to give birth since. Even if there was such a strange birth, the hospital would have preserved it for physiological research and would never have discarded it at the entrance of the hospital, attracting crowds and obstructing traffic. This fact is the most obvious and undeniable. This must be the work of some idle well-wishers who, having nothing to do all day, picked up two premature lamb fetuses from somewhere, secretly threw them at the entrance of the hospital, and deliberately made a sensational scene to attract people to watch, so as to fulfill their secret, self-satisfied, cunning plan. It is extremely boring and not worth a laugh. According to Lin Wenguang, a doctor at the Huiren Clinic across the street from the hospital, one of the discarded fetuses was picked up by an old woman, and the other was wrapped in paper by Chen Zhengling, a Zhenjiang man who buys and sells old goods. However, the truth is difficult to ascertain.</p>

It was deemed to have violated Articles 3 and 4 of the Telecommunications Regulations. The court was requested to issue a search warrant, and detectives were dispatched to search and seize the radio broadcasting station's large and small components. The company's manager, Zhang Jianqiu, was summoned to the First Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer filed a lawsuit in accordance with the Telecommunications Regulations, requesting a penalty in accordance with Article 21 of the same regulations. The court ordered the defendant to pay a cash bail of three hundred yuan to be released pending verification. This matter has been reported in previous newspapers. The case has been summoned twice by Judge Wu Fanglian, and the defendant has retained lawyer Yang Guoshu for his defense. The debate has been declared closed, and the verdict is pending. Yesterday was the day of the verdict. The defendant and his lawyer arrived in court at 10 AM to await instructions. Judge Wu presided over the First Criminal Court and summoned the defendant to court for a brief interrogation. Zhang Jianqiu was sentenced to a fine of three hundred yuan for privately setting up a radio station. The seized radio equipment was confiscated as per the list.</p>

<h3>Anti-Drug Conference Decides on Important Cases</h3>
<p>National Congress Postponed</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association held a standing committee meeting yesterday, attended by more than ten people, including Wang Jingqi, Cai Rudong, Li Denghui, and Guo Baoyi. Wang Jingqi chaired the meeting. First, the general secretary, Huang Jiaohui, reported on the progress of the association's work. Then, the proposals were discussed, and the following resolutions were made: (1) The National Anti-Drug Representative Congress convened by the association, which was previously resolved to be postponed until January 21, is now being postponed again to March 1, 21, in light of the increasingly tense anti-Japanese issue and the public's anxiety, based on the proposals of anti-drug organizations in various regions. A letter and telegram should be sent to the preparatory offices in various regions at home and abroad, and to all anti-drug associations and anti-drug propaganda associations across the country for reference. (2) Military personnel in Fujian Province are planting opium on a large scale among the Le people in northern and southern Fujian, collecting huge amounts of money, and using airplanes to smuggle and sell opium publicly, harming the people and undermining the ban on opium. Chen Diaoyuan, the chairman of Anhui Province, and Hao Zihua, the director of the Anhui Province Anti-Opium Investigation Department, are also sheltering planting, transportation, sales, and consumption, making the atmosphere of drug use in northern and southern Anhui pervasive, which is heartbreaking. The above incidents have been reported by the heads of anti-drug organizations, people's organizations, and party departments at all levels in Fujian and Anhui, and have been submitted with solid evidence. After investigation by the association, they have been found to be true. Although the association has repeatedly protested and the people of Fujian and Anhui have complained to the National Government, no action has been taken. The association has a responsibility to combat drugs and should continue to protest and request the Central Party Department and the Control Yuan to investigate and deal with the matter according to law, in order to leave the people a glimmer of hope and protect the dignity of the national prohibition law. It was resolved that the secretariat should actively handle the matter. (3) The association's work plan for the eighth to tenth fiscal years was reviewed and approved and will be submitted to the National Congress for discussion in the future. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>The Minzhi Bookstore</h3>
<p>Layoff of a Large Number of Workers Case</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Sets the 5th for Arbitration</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Minzhi Bookstore headquarters laying off all 24 workers in the typesetting department, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly convened conciliation committees to conduct conciliation with the Municipal Party Department and the Public Security Bureau. The employer's reason is that the workers in the typesetting department were hired by the foreman. During the strike, the workers posted slogans and overthrew the foreman, causing the foreman to resign in anger, and they insisted on not allowing them to return to work. The workers' reason is that the wages of the workers in the typesetting department were all paid by the factory, not hired by the foreman, and they should not be dismissed illegally on that pretext. However, due to the insistence of both parties, the matter could not be resolved and conciliation was declared unsuccessful. It was submitted to arbitration. The Labor Arbitration Committee of the Municipal Government has approved the submission to arbitration and has scheduled an arbitration meeting for 2 PM on the afternoon of the 5th.</p>

<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>Since October 22nd, this column has raised four questions to solicit opinions, namely (1) regarding the League of Nations, (2) regarding the boycott of Japanese goods, (3) regarding the volunteer army, and (4) regarding uniting the people to face foreign aggression. In the past month, we have received many replies. Those that have been published in this column, such as Mr. Lin Yifang, Mr. Liu Boyong, Mr. Zhongxia, and Mr. Zheng Hongsheng on the boycott of Japanese goods, Mr. Qingyuan on the volunteer army, and Mr. Ding Jichan on uniting to face foreign aggression, all have great value. In addition, there are still many that could not be published due to space limitations. Now that the situation has changed drastically, the national crisis is becoming more urgent. Negotiations with the League of Nations have completely failed. The bitter battle in Heilongjiang Province has finally fallen. Disturbances in Tianjin continue unabated. In this moment when the fate of China is hanging by a thread, simply worrying, being anxious, and being irritable are all useless. All of our citizens should stand up, muster deep courage, and rack their brains to come up with a more appropriate plan for the current major issues and contribute it to the authorities and the people. Now, please raise two questions as follows: (1) Japan's trampling on Heilongjiang Province and its invasion of the Middle East route is not only disregarding our country's sovereignty but also provoking Soviet Russia. According to common sense, Soviet Russia can no longer tolerate it. If it joins the war, the Russo-Japanese War of twenty-seven years ago will be re-enacted. At that time, what attitude should our country take towards Japan and Soviet Russia? If it involves European and American countries, how should we deal with each country? (2) National Government Chairman Chiang has decided to set off for the north to recover lost territory in the coming days. This is certainly what the people of the whole country are eagerly looking forward to. From then on, the overall situation will change drastically. Of course, the government is responsible for military preparations. On the part of the people, what responsibilities and work should they do? What should be done to boycott Japanese goods and train the volunteer army? Each answer should be limited to a maximum of one thousand words, speak less empty words, and focus on proposing methods. This newspaper will disclose the best ones according to the capacity of this column and open them for discussion. If you agree with the methods proposed by others, please also state it. Please also state your name, gender, age, occupation, or school, hometown, attach a communication stamp, and a corresponding number of stamps so that those who are not published in the newspaper will be informed. As for the three questions of schooling, occupation, and marriage, they will still be handled in accordance with the previous regulations. Respectfully.</p>
<h3>Mr. Xia Jianyan's Message</h3>
<p>(Will you resist the enemy and not yield?)</p>
<p>1. May the central government lead the national farmers, industrialists, merchants, students, and soldiers to unite and concentrate their forces to cooperate in resisting the enemy. 2. The League of Nations limits the Japanese withdrawal of troops, falsely adopts the illegal conditions of the Japanese side to oppress our country, and vows not to yield to such treaties that destroy the country and lose land. The above two points are the main points, and I would like to offer my humble advice to those who care about the current situation.</p>
<p>(Reply) Do you advocate resisting the enemy? Do you advocate not yielding? Please read the newspaper, "China approves the League of Nations Council's proposal to establish a neutral zone near Jinzhou. The Chinese government has already instructed the Jinzhou military commander to establish an agreement with the foreign military observers there." Jinzhou is located in western Liaoning and has already been designated as a neutral zone under the observation of military observers from various countries. Jinzhou is a neutral zone, and the east of Jinzhou is not a neutral zone. Who is in charge? Whose troops are stationed there? Whose land is it? Please pay attention.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I respectfully write to you to inform you that I and my classmates went to Beijing to petition on the 25th. We had many feelings in all aspects. Although we suffered a lot, we felt that we did not fail this trip. Now there is one thing that is most heartbreaking, briefly described below. After I petitioned the National Government, a Nanjing classmate suddenly mentioned a person from Heilongjiang who was asking for help. He claimed to be a subordinate of Ma Zhanshan and described how he had been inspected several times by violent Japan before he was able to escape from the encirclement and come to Beijing from Ping to ask for help. As for the current situation in Heilongjiang, it is extremely panic. Ma Zhanshan's department can be delayed for up to a month. If the central government does not find a way to remedy it, I am afraid that Heilongjiang will not be able to hold on for long. As for the Heilongjiang army, there are still thousands of people, but there are insufficient military supplies and poor military equipment. Moreover, with the Japanese army pressing on the border, they cannot resist for long. As for the equipment of the Japanese army, it is even more complete. In one division, there are machine gun teams, heavy artillery teams, armored car teams, tank teams, airplane teams, gas teams, etc. When they attack the Heilongjiang army most fiercely, they use poison gas bombs to defend against the enemy, or airplanes drop poison gas bombs, so the dead and wounded are everywhere and in a mess. Even more painful is that the wounded soldiers are captured by the Japanese and shot immediately. Fortunately, they are rescued by the soldiers in the rear. However, the doctors are inadequate, the medicine is bad, and the nurses are also out of shape and scolding them. This is especially unbearable for the soldiers on the front line. Therefore, good men willingly give up, and they feel deeply disappointed and discouraged about the future of the country. Hearing this, I could not help but burst into tears. The brave soldiers of Heilongjiang, who are donating their lives for the country, are being treated so badly by the rear doctors. How can patriotic youths not find a way to help and rescue them? Therefore, please publish it in the newspaper for the examination of colleagues in the medical field. Wang Yuan respectfully writes, "Attached, if there are any medical colleagues who do not avoid hardships and are determined to go to help with medicine, I propose to withdraw money from the donations to Ma Zhanshan to purchase medicine and pay fees." Respected Sir, I read the Benbu News in your newspaper on November 29th about the Pingmin Bank, which mentioned that Liu Zhi initiated it. I have just been informed by Liu, the chairman of our provincial government, that I have no commercial experience and have not heard about the organization of the bank. This news must be a rumor. I urge your newspaper to correct it. I hereby inform you and ask the editor to correct it, Secretary Xu Wenjing of the Henan Provincial Government, December 1st, 20th year.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I hereby write to inform you that I have read in the Benbu News of your newspaper on the 29th of this month the news that Dafeng Rice Store defrauded money. Our store is also located on Zhoujiazui Road, also named Dafeng, and is also a double-opening store. However, our store is located at 859-60, the east end of Zhoushan Road. The store is located at the Oujia Road intersection. After the incident occurred, many relatives and friends came to inquire after seeing the newspaper. I am sincerely afraid of confusing the rumors and affecting the reputation of the store. Therefore, I am writing this letter to request that it be published in the Letter Column to clarify it. I am very grateful for your kindness. The Dafeng store writes, December 1st.</p>
<p>Respectfully, I am now reading today's newspaper about the exposure of the behind-the-scenes of the Gambling Party. The gang leader Jiang Zhichao, etc., were arrested in our hotel, which is very shocking. After investigation, our hotel has never had such a thing happen, and Jiang Zhichao and Hua Chunshan have never stayed in our hotel. I am sincerely afraid of confusing the facts, and I should prepare a letter and ask the newspaper to publish it in the Letter Column for correction. I hereby send my best regards to the Editor-in-Chief of Shenbao. Sincerely, Zhongnan Hotel, December 1st.</p>

<p>Achievements in Road Construction in Fujian Province · Learn · Move</p>
<p>Since Xu Xianshi took office as the Director of Construction in Fujian Province in the 17th year of the Republic of China, he planned to build five main trunk roads in Fujian Province. He also raised 40 million yuan in highway bonds as construction costs. This bond was to be raised over five years, with 8 million yuan raised each year. The plan was approved by the provincial government. However, in recent years, Fujian Province has experienced successive political upheavals, banditry, and natural disasters. The fundraising for highway bonds has been delayed and has not been implemented. Several months ago, Yang Shuzhuang proposed to start raising the first phase of highway bonds of 8 million yuan. Although it was approved by the provincial government, disasters have occurred frequently in the past two months. This initiative has been shelved again. However, although highway bonds could not be raised due to various reasons, the Construction Department established highway engineering offices in various sections, assigned laborers to each section, and used the income from highway surcharges to subsidize the expenses of each engineering office. Therefore, the trunk roads that have been completed previously have reached 1,085 li. Those nearing completion reach 475 li. Those yet to be constructed are 2,460 li. (The five trunk lines total 4,020 li). The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Fujian-Zhejiang First Trunk Line. This line runs from Minhou, passing through Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Ningde, Xiapu, and Fuding counties, and enters Zhejiang. The entire line is 100 li long. Currently, only the Minhou-Lianjiang section, which is 40 li, has started construction. This section will be completed soon. (2) Fujian-Zhejiang Second Trunk Line. This line runs from Nanping, passing through Jian'ou, Pucheng, and enters Zhejiang. The entire line is 540 li long. Currently, 60 li between Nanping and Jian'ou has been completed. Also, 5 li between Pucheng and Xianyang Town has been completed. The remaining sections will be under construction. (3) Fujian-Guangdong Trunk Line. This line runs from Minhou, passing through Fuqing, Putian, Jinjiang, Tong'an, Longxi, Zhangpu, Yunxiao, and Zhao'an, and enters Guangdong. The entire line is 1,128 li long. The sections that have been completed and opened to traffic are: Minhou to Changsi Ridge, which is 40 li; Changsi Ridge to Jiangkou, which is 80 li; Jiangkou to Fengting, which is 126 li; Fengting to Luoyang, which is 92 li; Luoyang to Tong'an, which is 155 li; Tong'an to Jiaowei, which is 92 li; Jiaowei to Zhangzhou, which is 68 li. The remaining 62 li will be completed within the year. The Zhangpu to Yunxiao section has been completed for 58 li. The remaining 70 li has also begun construction. In addition, there is the Yunxiao to Zhao'an section, which is 136 li, which has not yet started construction. The Construction Department has sent personnel to prepare for it. (4) Fujian-Jiangxi First Trunk Line. This line runs from Minhou, passing through Nanping, Shunchang, Shaowu, and Guangze, and enters Jiangxi. The entire line is 982 li long. Among them, the completed sections are: Minhou to Muyuan, which is 15 li; Jiulitan to Nanping, which is 35 li; Shaowu to Guangze, which is 20 li. The remaining 35 li will be open to traffic within the year. (5) Fujian-Jiangxi Second Trunk Line. This line runs from Longxi, passing through Nanjing, Longyan, Changting, and enters Jiangxi. The entire line is 660 li long. Currently, the completed section is Zhangzhou to Shuichao, which is 80 li. The remaining 60 li will be open to traffic within the year. The Shuichao to Longyan section is 70 li, and the remaining 68 li has been surveyed and will be under construction. The Tingzhou to Gucheng section is 16 li, and the remaining 40 li is under construction. Among the above lines, the Fujian-Guangdong Trunk Line is almost completed. However, places such as Luoyang Bridge and Wuli Bridge still need to be rebuilt with new-style bridges, which will cost a considerable amount. The Provincial Highway Bureau is planning this. It is expected that the opening of the entire line will not be far away. In addition, the branch lines recently completed by Longxi, Hui'an, Siming, Dongshan, Changtai, Longyan, Zhangpu, Nanjing and other counties are about 500 li. The branch roads in other counties that are being surveyed and constructed are no less than 400 or 500 li. In this time of frequent disasters and urgent foreign troubles, when everything is at a standstill, it is commendable that the road construction in Fujian Province has achieved such results. As for the various highways in the province that were completed two years ago, such as Jinglin Road, Zhangjiu Road, Zhangjing Road, Zhangnan Road, Zhangban Road, Zhangzhuang Road, Zhangjing Road, Zhangwu Road, Taipu Road, Quanyuan Road, Quanyong Road, Shanping Road, Jiangjiao Road, Taiyan Road, Guan Hong Road, Jing Shan Road, etc., which amount to about 600 or 700 li, are not included. Therefore, as of today, the total number of trunk roads, branch roads, and county roads that have been opened to traffic in Fujian Province has reached more than 2,000 li.</p>
<h3>1932 Style</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of New Cars of Various Brands · Yu</p>
<p>Another year has passed easily. It is the end of the year again. Time flies, no different from the driving of a car. It goes by in a blink of an eye and is fleeting. Therefore, automakers in Europe and the United States have already arranged their new car plans at the beginning of the year. Drivers only need to purchase and choose as they wish. The following is a summary of the new cars of various companies in 1932, as an aid to those who want to buy a car.</p>
<p>Morris Cars: The famous British-made Morris brand new car has already been shipped to Shanghai. It will soon be available for viewing in the showroom. The reputation of Morris cars has always been quite well-known. There is no doubt that the new car is a carefully crafted product of the Morris factory. Regarding the style and appearance, it is naturally superior. As for the improvements and progress, it is difficult to describe them all. Morris cars are manufactured in Cowley, Oxford, England. The cars they make are divided into four main categories: Morris Minor, Morris Major, Morris Cowley, and Morris Oxford. Each category is further divided into six models, so there are many styles in total. According to the dealers selling this brand, the number of new cars coming to Shanghai will not be very large, and there is a risk that demand will exceed supply. As for the reason, it is said that the first is that when new cars are launched, the types that are shipped initially are not very many, but the number of people who need new cars is bound to be large, resulting in insufficient distribution. Moreover, the new models of cars made in the United States often have to wait until the New York Auto Show held in January is over before the new cars are released for sale. During this period, buyers are naturally more eager to buy. The second is that the price of silver has risen, and the selling price has been reduced, so buyers will be even more enthusiastic. Moreover, Morris has long been famous, so there will be many buyers. As for the factory's products, they are first sold domestically and then shipped overseas, so there will not be a large amount of exports for a while. There are many new car styles, such as two-seater sports cars and four-door sedans, which are particularly noteworthy. Regarding the style, the radiator of the 1932 Morris car is made of chrome, which is bright and pleasing to the eye, and the form is beautiful. All six-cylinder models have chrome-plated automatic window panels. Safety is also a major consideration for the new car. The windshield and windows are equipped with a three-piece safety glass device. The fuel tank is installed at the rear and lower part of the frame and does not come into contact with the passenger compartment. The front of the new Morris sedan is "windproof," which not only enhances the appearance but also isolates wind and maintains engine power.</p>
<p>Standard Cars: Standard cars are also among the best British-made cars. The factory has 28 years of car manufacturing experience, so its products are outstanding and highly praised by buyers. The 1932 new car has already started its journey to Shanghai and will arrive soon. The new car has many improvements in the mechanical aspect, which is very suitable for the modern economic trend. As for its comfort, beauty, and low price, they are all the more so. The 1932 Standard cars include four types: Standard "Twenty," Standard "Sixteen," Standard "Big Nine," and Standard "Small Nine." The characteristics of this type of car, which were previously unique to large and expensive cars, are all incorporated into the Standard brand. For example, in terms of the fuel tank, it is installed under the frame for absolute safety. Shock absorbers are installed at the front and rear of the car body. In addition, the wheel lines, windshields, etc. have all been innovated. As for fuel economy and low price, they are unmatched by other cars with the same comfort. This car is very convenient to drive and manage, so women especially like to use it. The brakes are also very powerful. When used, a single touch has a miraculous effect. The car body of the new Standard car is particularly well-made, with spacious seats, convenient access, and ample lighting. The car has four doors, which are beautiful and comfortable. The paint on the car body is particularly eye-catching. The radiator of the new car is very beautiful in style, and the most convenient thing is the roof device. This type of roof is called the Stanlaite type. It can be easily opened and closed by simply turning a knob. It can also be operated safely even when the car is moving.</p>
<p>Graham: According to news from Dodge, the 1932 Graham new car is a six-cylinder model, and its selling price is very low. The new car has many advantages, which cannot be fully described for a while. Let's just mention the most important ones. This car is a six-cylinder model, and it is stable and fast when moving, with no vibration. The car is also equipped with a free wheel, the wheelbase is increased, and the car body is large, so the driver has a comfortable feeling everywhere. As for the beauty of the car body style and the reform of the engine, users will be satisfied.</p>
<p>Willys Cars: The new Willys six-cylinder bus and the C-157 commercial car, with a 157-inch wheelbase, are new products of Willys-Overland. In addition, there is the C-131 with a load capacity of 1.5 tons and the C-113 with a load capacity of 0.5 tons. The body styles of all these new cars are suitable for industrial and commercial use, and they are very economical to use. The new car is a six-cylinder model with the latest 65-horsepower engine. The hydraulic device is particularly characteristic. The half-ton and 1.5-ton trucks are equipped with four-speed transmissions and internal expansion four-wheel brakes. The new car is very durable in use.</p>
<p>Hudson Cars: Hudson Essex cars are very popular. Since Mr. Spalding was appointed as the engine planner, the 1932 new car has many characteristics. Mr. Spalding has many years of experience in planning and manufacturing cars. He is not only famous in the United States, but also admired in Europe. Therefore, the 1932 Hudson new car, once Mr. Spalding pointed it out, was焕然动人(idiom: completely transformed), with beautiful style and smooth movement. In recent years, Mr. Spalding has planned the manufacture of cars for celebrities all over the world. The most famous ones are King Alfonso of Spain, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, Elizabeth Arden, Roger Wolfe Kahn, Mary Pickford, Lock Sher, Tom Mix, Bainard Walter Flight, Pauline Frederick, Conrad Nagel, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, and Shalewa Neal.</p>
<p>Studebaker: The Studebaker car produced by Chrysler is very popular and widely used in the market. According to the latest news, 55 new Studebaker cars will be sold in Shanghai. The second batch will arrive in Shanghai soon. The new car has many characteristics and is equipped with free wheels. It is expected that because of the strong demand, it will be very popular once it arrives in Shanghai. In addition, the 1932 new car of the DeSoto six-cylinder model has also begun to be displayed. The DeSoto new car is also equipped with free wheels. The eight-cylinder DeSoto will also meet the people of Shanghai soon. The Packard car is a car with a very good reputation. The 1932 model is even more refined, which is impressive. The sample car has been displayed. Once you inspect it, you will know that the three elements of gorgeousness, comfort, and safety are not empty words. The biggest feature of the Packard new car is its light and flexible driving and management. No matter what the road conditions, the number of passengers in the car, or the climate changes, the Packard car can always provide unexpected comfort and stability. Because its shock absorption device is superior in every way. The Chrysler 1932 new car model has also arrived in Shanghai. However, only the six-cylinder model is available, and the eight-cylinder model has not yet been shipped.</p>
<p>Dodge New Cars: Dodge cars are planned and manufactured by the Dodge brothers. They are very popular and have a very good reputation. The 1932 new car has also been launched. It is said to be the best of Dodge's car manufacturing achievements over the years. Among them, the eight-cylinder new car is the best, with 76 horsepower, so the power is huge and the movement is smooth. The engine is an L-head type, and the cylinders are arranged in parallel. The fuel is very economical when used. As for the beautiful appearance, it goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Summer Olympia</h3>
<p>Detailed Record of the International Auto Show · Shadow · Dai</p>
<p>The British Summer Olympia Auto Show, which was once widely publicized, officially opened on November 5th. At this time in the UK, there is a great economic panic, and various industries have shown signs of decline. However, the automobile industry, as evidenced by this international auto show, has obviously made great progress. I will record the various grand occasions to enrich this publication. I think it will also be welcomed by those who are concerned about the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Manifestation of Success: In the past year, various businesses in the UK have declined day by day. However, the UK's automobile industry is the opposite of other industries. It has actually made great success. This is really beyond our expectations. Today, the UK's automobile industry has ranked fourth among the various large enterprises in the country. Moreover, from the recent domestic sales and the proof of overseas trade, it is clear that there is still a major development in the future. Today's transportation industry is developing day by day, and the need for cars is naturally expected. Recently, the number of British cars exported has greatly increased compared with previous years. Therefore, in the past two years, the automobile industry has obviously been able to guarantee future development. Even in the most recent six months, the number of cars imported by Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa that were manufactured in the UK has accounted for 29%. However, if we look back at the situation two years ago, the number of British cars imported in the above-mentioned areas was less than 12%.</p>
<p>Efforts in Economy: The International Auto Show held in London this time has given us great satisfaction. Otherwise, regardless of whether it is inside or outside the UK, the people who visit will be deeply impressed. Moreover, the fact proves that the products of British car factories in this auto show, regardless of any type, have shown success. The main problem is to adapt to the social environment. In other words, it is to be in line with economic principles. At the Summer Olympia Auto Show, we have deeply understood that all cars from various factories can meet economic principles. Moreover, there are countless improvements in various new cars. The car 奥 is wider than the car width, and the selling price is lower than that of the old car. It has done its best to be cheap and beautiful. It is really something that products from various countries cannot match.</p>
<p>Attention to Safety: In recent cities, the number of vehicles coming and going has been increasing day by day. The speed of cars has also been evolving day by day due to the progress of engine manufacturing. Therefore, whether driving is safe has become the main problem. Even the smallest vehicles are exceptionally fast when driving. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>General Situation of the Xiang-E-Xi Line Project · Mountain · Wave</h3>
<p>The Xiang-E-Xi Line is one of the seven major trunk lines in Hunan Province. It runs from Changsha, passing through Ningxiang, Yiyang, Changde, Lixian, and Jinshi, to reach Public Security and Shashi in Hubei. It connects Xiangsha into a provincial road and can directly reach Shaanxi. The total length is 595 li. The Changning section of 100 li has been completed, and the Ningchang section of 308 li is under construction. The estimated cost of the entire road is: roadbed 555,500 yuan, bridges and culverts 595,000 yuan, pavement 476,000 yuan, land purchase, relocation, demolition compensation, etc. 238,000 yuan, surveying 29,750 yuan, engineering office expenses 178,500 yuan, station, shed, telephone pole line fees 89,250 yuan, totaling about 3,142,000 yuan. If no special circumstances are found, this number should not be far off. The project is carried out in three phases. The first phase starts from October of the 18th year to</p>

<p>June of the 19th year. The roadbed of 320 li from Ningxiang to Changde and the construction of bridges, culverts, and paving with sand, etc., will be completed. The second phase will start from July of the 19th year to June of the 20th year. The roadbed of 205 li from Changde to Jinshi and the bridge and culvert project will be completed. The third phase will start from July of the 20th year to June of the 21st year. The paving with sand of 205 li from Changde to Jinshi and the station, shed, telephone, and other projects will be completed. And continue to complete the various projects of 70 li from Jinshi to the Hubei border. By this time, the entire road will be completed. However, whether it can be completed on schedule depends on whether the project progresses without obstacles. The first section of the Xiang-E-Xi Line is the Changning section. In February of the 15th year, the Xiangzhong Road Bureau first proposed to build it. But it only lasted for ten months before it was suspended due to some reason. In July of the 17th year, the construction was continued. In August of the 18th year, the road line from Yingwan City on the opposite bank of Changsha City, passing through Wangchengpo, Qiaotoupu, Shanzaopu, Bairuopu, Huangnipu, Youcaopu, Xialuopu, and Lijingpu to Ningxiang City, was completed. The total length is 100 li. After being taken over by the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau, it was renamed the Changning section of the Xiang-E-Xi Line. From Changsha to Zheruopu, which is 50 li, due to avoiding floods, entering and exiting the mountains, detours, and twists and turns, the project is quite large. From Bairuopu to Ningxiang, which is 50 li, passing through the fields, the route is straight and flat, and the project is relatively less expensive. The total span of the bridges in the entire section is 730 feet. Wanglu Bridge is composed of a middle hole with a span of 40 feet, two side holes with a span of 30 feet each, and small urns with a span of 8 feet. The bridge deck is 40 feet higher than the riverbed. The entire structure is made of reinforced concrete, which is simple and strong. It is a new-style building in Xiangzhong, and it leans against Yuelu in the back and overlooks the Xiang River in the front. The clouds, mountains, and green water are beautiful. Sanlilun Bridge has three urns with a span of 8 feet. Qiaotoupu Bridge has four urns with a span of 8 feet. Bairuopu Bridge has one urn with a span of 20 feet. Jingma Bridge has three urns with a span of 30 feet. Since there is no suitable stone material nearby, sandstone and shale are used. During the flood season in Longzhong, the Wei River rises frequently and is often submerged. There are many unique bridges. In addition to Chonggong Bridge with three urns with a span of 20 feet and Shahe Bridge with five holes of a track girder flat bridge with a span of 20 feet, 20 small urns are built to discharge the rapids. The stone material is Carboniferous limestone green stone. Wherever there are streams, small bridges are built, divided into two types: square holes with spans of 2 feet and 4 feet, and arched urns with spans of 4 feet, 6 feet, and 8 feet. The size is determined according to the flow of each river port. The materials are mainly steel bars, cement, and square stones, supplemented by lime, green bricks, and red sand. Earthenware pipes are installed in the farmland waterways to facilitate irrigation. The paving materials are divided into crushed stone and pebbles. The former is more. Wangchengpo to Huangnipu, which is 50 li, is shale crushed stone. The material is fragile and needs to be repaired from time to time, which is a disadvantage. The maximum slope of the road surface is 4%. Along the sides of the road, tung trees and willows are planted for shade. Seven sheds and telephone poles and lines have been built. However, the station is a temporary building. The total cost of the entire section is 310,000 yuan. The average is about 3,100 yuan per li. It is classified as: surveying salary of 10,000 yuan, earth and stone 70,000 yuan, culvert pipes 18,000 yuan, bridge urns 50,000 yuan, Wanglu Bridge 22,000 yuan, paving with sand 80,000 yuan, construction salary 58,000 yuan. In addition, the cost of the station and shed is 5,000 yuan. In addition to the materials, the remaining administrative expenses could have been reduced somewhat. However, due to changes in the plan midway, it was delayed for four years before it was completed. Therefore, the cost was slightly higher. This section starts in the provincial capital and ends in Ningxiang. One is the political and economic center, and the other is the main road for water and land transportation. Therefore, after the completion of the highway, it is more convenient for travelers along the way, and the commercial activities are more prosperous. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Recent Italian Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Mo Jing</p>
<p>Six Italian Novels</p>
<p>The first book we want to introduce is "Il Sob A Picco" by Di Vincenzo Cardarelli, a memoir-like novel. Cardarelli's writing is so charming and simple that readers are reluctant to put it down. The book begins like this: "The village where I was born, where I spent my childhood, a part of my youth, the village where I first knew love, was once called Corneto, Tarquinia. If I close my eyes, my first memory is of that old house, surrounded by a garden, and in the corner of that garden is...a magnolia." Personal recollections are often the most beautiful subjects in literature, especially in Italian literature. The book begins in this way, and the reader can be sure that it is worth reading. Because when an Italian writer reminisces about his hometown or the house of his childhood, he often writes his best work.</p>
<p>This book mostly describes Corneto, which is located on a mountain in the Maremma region. In this book, we can see the picturesque, bare, gray, and misty scenery around the village, the pleasant slopes, the interspersed gardens and trees, and the lively San Antonio festival in the village, with mule races. We can also hear the desolate monotony of its only song. We are even more like eyewitnesses to the many intruders who come to Corneto every year: the harvesters in blue, the diggers and cleaners of Agilent, the harvesters who come in mid-July, then the charcoal burners, and finally the shepherds. There are two very beautiful portraits: one of Argentone, the manager of a group of wandering workers, a short, conceited man; and the other of Redagna, the declining landowner, a faithful companion to the whole region, and a storyteller. In such a place, and in the stories of his father's snack shop at the station, or in the portrait of the old stonemason of Solitudessetiognano, Cardarelli gives us that true, permanent Italy, which most foreigners never see, or, even if they see it, they forget. This book was awarded the Premio Bagutta in 1930.</p>
<p>The second book is "Il Paradiso Perduto" by Alberto Cacocci. Cacocci writes best when he writes simply and without extravagance. For example, how well he describes a June evening in his childhood, when dinner was over and his family was sitting in the garden talking about the day's events. In his inevitable evocation of "returning home," there are some traces of excessive extravagance, but the portraits of the maid Chishavanna, Francesca, and her mad uncle are depicted with great vividness. The last chapter is a recollection of officers and ladies during the Great War, which is another typical Italian scene.</p>
<p>The third book is Alessandro Bonsanti's collection of short stories "La Serue Amorosa," which tells the story of the beginning of the last century, when there was still a Grand Duke in Florence, and when the tutors who taught English to the sons of nobles always inevitably cursed Byron. The stories are either about the lives of bandits in the mountains and forests, or about the experiences of good families. Although there is some rambling, few Italian novels in recent times have been as pleasant to read as this one, because Bonsanti uses a fluent, unpretentious, but never mundane style, and has a remarkable ability to evoke scenes and express personalities. His descriptions of the meeting of two bandit friendships and the life of a Florentine noble family are equally good. He expresses what we might call a picture of life in the age of the horse-drawn carriage, with the leisurely style of an English novelist.</p>
<p>The fourth book is Piero Godpa's "Mozzo." This lovely, short novel, which has previously won the Fiere Letteraria Prize, tells the story of a child born in a small house between La Spezia and Chiavari, on a railway line with many tunnels. Few travelers from La Spezia and Portofino venture deep into this so-called "Five Villages" wilderness, but they are all lovely places, where the people either live by sailing and fishing, or by growing grapes. In this book, Godpa has placed his own deep love for this area of the Ligurian coast.</p>
<p>Mozzo is the protagonist of the book, the son of a railway worker who operates the locomotive's fire. He has a special love for the sea, which even his widowed mother's worries cannot change. His mother sent him to a relative, a priest, in the countryside to be educated, but it was ineffective. Sending him to be an apprentice to a barber was also ineffective. The sea irresistibly called to him. The tone of this pastoral song is one of cheerful simplicity, vividly depicting the bold spirit of an Italian child, especially in the chapter describing Mozzo and several other children rowing the mother of Mocci, her baby, and the family's belongings from Coroneglio to Pieve. A gust of wind arose, and they could not get around the rocky cape, so they ventured into a small bay, where they landed and spent the night with some stonemasons. Throughout the sea voyage, Mozzo was the one who sensitively took command.</p>
<p>The fifth book is Corrado Alvaro's collection of short stories "L'Dmata Alla Finestra."</p>
<p>This is a collection of short stories, mostly reminiscent of the burning landscapes of Calabria and the patriarchal simplicity, with the first one being the best. It describes how a painter painted a portrait of a farm girl and the impact this had on her. The painter finished the painting and left without a second glance, but the girl was infatuated with him and was saddened by it. The book describes this point vividly and colorfully.</p>
<p>The sixth book is Giani Stuparich's collection of short stories "Racconti." The best of these is the last one, a detailed study of a failed life. Antonio Livio, a merchant from Trieste, dies of cancer. Only at the moment of his death does he realize that he has never understood anything, not even the psychology of his own wife.</p>
<h3>Recent French Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Cong Ren</p>
<p>Alfred Jolivet</p>
<p>Is a professor of Scandinavian literature and languages at the University of Paris. He obtained a book of Strindberg's letters that had never been published, and used these letters extensively in his book "The Drama of Strindberg." Of the books on Nordic literature published in recent years, this one is undoubtedly the most comprehensive and important. Although Jolivet is a university professor, his book is not one of those introductory books written for students, nor is it a dissertation often done by university professors. In all respects, this book can be said to be a very up-to-date biography of Strindberg. He delves deep into the labyrinth of the Swedish great writer's soul, and in this labyrinth, he proceeds carefully and persistently, sometimes with intuitive insights and due solemnity. Among his many discoveries, one of the most noteworthy is his assertion that Strindberg's mind was feminine, which is to say that Strindberg would not write unless he was stimulated by foreign or external shocks. Strindberg needed a "driving force" to write, and this "driving force" was often found in French literature. Isn't this worth our attention? Therefore, Strindberg under Jolivet's pen has given Jolivet the status of an international critic.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>There are three books in the "World Tour" (Le Tourdu Monde) series of Glauser: three by Paul Morand, three by Claude Farrère, two by André Maurois, and three by Aaron Jeaul. These books are no better than C. T. Laclaret's "Demi Dieu, ou le VoyageenGrece."</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Marcel Ayme has published La Table aux Creves Brulebois. He has recently published Un Varien, but unfortunately, this one is not as good as the previous two. This book is only for theologians, and is full of foolish cruelty and vulgar things.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Mermoz's Au Lion Tranquille is considered a masterpiece, but his recent work Mal. Loti is far inferior to the previous one. He works in the printing business and is employed by Imprimerie Nationale. He is indeed a true representative of the skilled workers of Paris and is also very proficient in the common language of our time, so everything he writes is of social documentary value.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Those who have read Leon Bopp's study of Amie and his novel "The Sin of Alexandre Lenaz" can now read another of his books. The name of this book is "Is He Clever or Stupid?" If we examine it closely, we will not be disappointed. It will still fill our hearts with his original suggestion that people can be explained as a kind of thinking machine.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Emile Henriot is the literary news editor of the Times and also a novelist of considerable reputation. A few years ago, his Aricie Brun won the French Academy's Novel Prize. He has recently published "Lost Opportunities" (Occasions Perdues), which is a story of those young French people who were disciples of Barre. These people were wiped out by the war. They were all forthright and uninhibited, with deep thoughts and some romanticism, and opposed their fathers' comfortable hedonism, but they were unprepared for the barbaric struggles (whether moral or material) that lay in wait for those younger than them. Born in the late 1880s and early 1890s, they perished with them. "Lost Opportunities," even if it has no documentary value, is already worth its existence in the two heroines, Jeanne Heylesse and Theuese Aubier.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Has everyone heard of Rene Benjamin's "Barres et Joffre"? Many books about Joffre have been published before and after his death. We always thought that there would be no more such books published, but now Benjamin's concise and vigorous "Seven Speeches of the General" has come out. This piece, although only a short forty or so pages, makes the excerpts of those other "Uncle Joffres" retreat. There is also an essay on "Barres," which is longer but extremely vivid and beautiful. Things that come out of Benjamin's pen are originally very good.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Andre Lavenson's book "The Sad History of Dostoevsky" is quite noteworthy, because of the many new Russian documents in it that have not yet been translated into French, especially the two volumes of "Letters" in the Moscow National Edition.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>"Night Flight" (Vol de Nuit) is also a short masterpiece, with a preface by Gide. Antoine de St. Exupery is a famous aviator. This piece is a story that took place one night in the office of the Buenos Aires commercial airline station. It tells how the protagonist, Fabien, was captured, how he was lost in a small cyclone, and how his friend, Reynievier, sacrificed human sorrow to almost inhuman work and duty. This piece is not written very sentimentally, and it uses some technical terms, which makes the tragedy even more tragic.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>The second volume of "Marcel Proust's Correspondence," by Rupert Pross and Paul Bravet, has now been published by Chez. This volume contains Proust's letters to Mrs. Naryef.</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Firmin Roz's "From Roosevelt to Hoover" is a well-written and reliable documentary book. Its author has become an authority on American studies by writing this type of book. He often has things published in the "Review of the Old and New Worlds."</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Among the books related to the colonial exhibition held in Paris in August, we can propose a book by Pierre Mille, Les Fils de L'Ombre et Soliel, which has just been published by Firmin-Didot. Pierre Mille is the founder of French colonial literature. He is the French Kipling and, in a certain sense, also the French Dickens, because once side shadows and caricatures are brought to his pen, they each take on their own lives.</p>
<h3>Recent Concerts in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>Previously, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra held symphony concerts every week in the Town Hall on Nanjing Road. From this winter, it has been moved to the Carlton Theatre, with performances starting at 9:00 pm and ending at 11:00 pm every Saturday. Seven concerts have been held this year. Although we don't know what amazing performances will break the record during this music season, except for Heifetz's recent solo violin recital at the New Shanghai Grand Theatre, I personally am very satisfied with the program of last Sunday's concert and have a very good impression.</p>
<p>We should congratulate Mr. Kryger, who directed and conducted the program of that concert, and Mr. Berliulin, the pianist, on their success.</p>
<p>From this concert, we can say that we heard music, truly heard formal music. We were intoxicated by these many beautiful pieces, from Berlioz's "Roman Carnival Overture" to Tchaikovsky's "B-flat minor Serenade," which allowed the audience's souls to be sublimated to the heavenly kingdom of music along with the orchestra's performance.</p>
<p>Mozart's "Musical Joke" is truly a masterpiece. Conductor Kryger truly understood the spirit of the original work. He carefully conducted a group of musicians to fully express the fun of the original piece, and was able to grasp the key points of the original work and analyze various subtle details, which is truly commendable and achieved a glorious success.</p>
<p>As for Grieg's "Peer Gynt Suite," it is a very common work, like a staple food in concerts, so I don't need to be verbose.</p>
<p>Mr. Berliulin is by no means an ordinary piano virtuoso, he is an accomplished artist. His performance of Tchaikovsky's "Serenade" can be taken as a strong guarantee. We hope that his progress will be boundless and that he can maintain his success and glory in art.</p>
<p>Sixth Symphony Concert</p>
<p>In this evening music concert, what made the whole concert more colorful was Mr. Ullstein's solo performance on the Violoncelle. His performance of Saint-Saens' "First Serenade" truly demonstrated his great talent.</p>
<p>Schumann's "Manfred" is a world-famous work. This is a prayer of a lonely hermit in the mountains, a kind of desolate and melancholy tone, which will make sentimental listeners cry.</p>
<p>As for Glazunov's "Waltz," this is a work that is popular in the Yiyuan Garden and several other high-class dance halls. Now it can be heard again in a formal concert hall, which can also be regarded as a creation. The general public is satisfied with this popular dance music. They applaud enthusiastically again and again, but I don't know if they truly understand art and express their appreciation, or if they are just expressing their goodwill to conductor Mr. Foa and all the musicians on the stage.</p>
<p>In the second half of the program, there was Mendelssohn's "Fourth Symphony." Although the conductor worked hard, there was nothing particularly brilliant, and there were many things that could be criticized, but on the whole, this concert gave us considerable satisfaction.</p>
<p>Seventh Symphony Concert</p>
<p>The seventh symphony concert of this year's music season was purely an Italian concert, with the singer being an Italian woman, the conductor being an Italian, and most of the audience being Italian expatriates in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ferrari's singing was one of the most brilliant performances of this evening's concert. The songs she sang were all famous works from operas, such as arias and short songs from "Werther," "La Boheme," and "Madame Butterfly." We can only express our respect for the art of this female artist, but we feel that her voice seems to lack gentleness, and there are perhaps places where she artificially fawns. When she sang sharp sentences, they were a bit irritating to the ears, but on the whole, she is still a first-class famous singer.</p>
<p>Rossini's "Overture from Italy" still achieved great success as always.</p>
<p>After the first half of the program was over, there was a short break, followed by Vittadini's "Nocturnal Harmony" and Santoliquido's "Watercolor."</p>
<p>"Nocturnal Harmony" was publicly performed for the first time in Shanghai, expressing the various sounds of nature very realistically, but it does not seem like an Italian work, but rather seems to be the work of a German musician.</p>
<p>Conductor Ros, the Italian musician, seemed a bit tired this night. He was able to fulfill his duties, and the general audience, especially the Italian expatriates, were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<p>In the most recent week, there were also several concerts that deserve our attention. The first was the solo recital by Heifetz, the world-famous violin master, and the second was the concert by the China National Conservatory of Music. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend and listen because I was ill and confined to the hospital for many days, so I am unable to express my feelings. I can only report some impressions of the three past symphony concerts. As for my personal loss of missing the Heifetz violin recital, I still consider it a great loss. I hope that those who have heard this world-famous musician perform can write some reports for us.</p>
