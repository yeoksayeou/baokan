<p>主張維持錦州現狀</p>
<p>日本提出劃界意見</p>
<p>英薛西爾堅决反對</p>
<p>調查團人數定三名</p>
<p>公開會議日内舉行</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯行政會已决定抛棄中立區域計謀、行政會對此問題熟商多日、今晚會議時、乃有此重要决定、行政會復决定建議維持錦州方面之現狀、議長白里安將函致日政府提出此議、同時對於日軍之撤出錦州區域、表示欣幸、中立區域問題之倐有此新轉機、係在下午芳澤訪問白里安之後、芳澤向白里安聲稱、日本撤回向錦州進行之日軍、是已履行中國提議中之日人方面義務矣、乃華兵今猶在錦州、請以壓力加諸中國、以免發生衝突、至於中立區域劃界事宜、宜由中日當道就地直接談判云、芳澤與白里安談話歷半小時、旁晚、除中日代表外、行政會會員集議五時開始、六時三刻散會、此一點四十五分鐘之會議、乃過去三星期中之最重要的行政會會議、芳澤提議經透澈討論後、斷爲不能接受、故行政會决定承認現奘、並　中日政府避免衝突之各種可能性、至於日代表應作片面的宣言、保留日本剿匪權之提議、行政會認爲可行、惟日代表之宣言、他人不得駁闢或批評一層、則行政會不能依允、故此事或將稍有頓挫、外間所傳日代表宣言僅言日軍行動自由、而不言及匪字之說、實屬毫無根據、行政會又允將議案第五段文字、即規定「雙方在九月三十日議案下之擔任、如在調查團抵滿時、猶未履行、則調查團須立即報告行政會」者删去之、而由議長在其宣言中對於此點作一般的陳述、聞今晚國聯方面稱、日本關於錦州之提議、如接受之、將置錦州及錦州與山海關間中立區域於日人掌扭中云、但行政會已决定不公佈會議詳情、故此說未必有證實報告也、當行政會六時三刻休會時、起草委員會依然在集會中、邀日代表團伊藤出席、伊藤七時始到、起草委員與之商酌一小時半、今晚有一可注意之消息、據謂調查團原定五人、今改爲六人、以英法意德美及北方一小國之代表組成之、此說傳佈頗廣、但未幾官塲否認之、聲明未有變更五人原議之問題、但除英法美三國外、其他兩國爲何國、則官場迄未說明之也、國聯姑定星期三日舉行行政會公開會議、此殆可爲最後一次之會議、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）芳澤往晤白里安、所談頗爲重要、當日代表走訪白氏時、一般人皆知中立區域組織上發生嚴重問題、所有討論備極艱澁、會晤畢、白氏即將日本意見、尤其是關于中立區域劃定界限之意見、提交十二委員會、據本社所知、日本</p>
<p>主張中立區域、一方以長城爲界、一方以錦州西方七公里地點一小河爲界、照此情形、則錦州似將包括在日本區域以内、英代表薛西爾對于此種解釋、立卽提出反對、認爲「不能接受、應卽速予聲明、藉非然者、兩日以後恐將無及矣」白里安雖竭力說明日本態度、未便認其牢不可破、但行政院仍以薛西爾所見爲是、决定拒絶日本要求、於是西班牙代表瑪達里加起立發言稱、本院之否决、請由各國駐東京大使正式照會幣原外相、起草委員會遂立即開會着手起草、十二委員會秘密會議將終時、所討論者係主席在最後公開會議時所應採取之舉動、與其對子决議案所應作之解說、此層當由雙方當事國表示可否意見、是時白里安以上項辦法、恐涉冒昧爲言、薛西爾爵士即答稱、「凡經本院贊同者、影響如何、在所不計」此次會議最明顯結果、即在實際上放棄中立區域、行政院請雙方當事國維持現狀、各守原有地位、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日國聯各理事表示、理事會終可覓得一途徑、解决遼案難關、而爲成立調解之基礎、故國聯秘書廳現已考慮星期三能否召集公開大會問題、據聞理事會現信用快刀斬亂麻方法、删除枝節、避免規定撤兵日期與日軍勦匪權利之兩棘手問題、迅行通過决議案與主席宣言、可免再起糾紛、使此案益陷複雜、理事會之意、擬准日代表芳澤在公開會議時說明日軍得隨意勦匪之日方理論、隨後由各理事自由加以批評、現有許多方面解釋此種計劃、以爲無異暗中警告日本勿再抱過分强横態度、至錦州之是否將留在中立區域内、目下固猶待解决、但聞理事會亦信中立調查團一旦抵遼後、該團將有一種職權、足以處置撤兵所生之異議、至中日兩代表團之態度、則中代表團發言人今日曾向新聞記者聲稱、日本保留勦匪權利之聲明、倘可供給日人重作敵對行爲之藉口、則中國將竭力反對、又日代表團伊籐亦向新聞記者聲稱、日代表團此時正待東京政府訓令、關於决議案内不涉勦匪、而由芳澤犬使另行補充聲明保留日軍自由行動之權一層、余輩仍待政府訓令、至所稱中國將有類似决議案或保留提出一節、余輩尚無所知云云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯理事會對於錦州中立區域之議、聞因界限問題發生糾葛與誤會、現擬避去規定正式中立區域、聽任中日軍隊照目前狀况、直至調查團抵遼以後再作處置、十二國理事將於下午五時開秘密會議、討論錦州地位、至調查團人數、聞十二國理事最近决定共六名、英美法德意各一員、餘一員或將由秘書廳選自南美、（八日國民電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）國聯行政會所辦理關於滿案爭端之談判、現漸近結束、明日或將舉行公開會議、總述所成就之各節、如明日不及舉行、則星期四日當可舉行、白里安致芳澤之函、即建議維持錦州方面之現局者、因此乃對機密文件之覆函、故不發表、惟聞白里安在此函中表示希望、願日兵勿越過現線、雙方宜力戒作挑釁事端、庶中立區域問題即此擱起不提、而由當地司令官員防杜戰事之責任、中國總代表施肇基今晨曾晤起草委員會、日晒代表團中之伊藤今日午後四時亦見該委員會（八日路透社電）</p>

<p>（東京）日外務省當局對於國聯理事會决定放棄錦州中立區域設置案、勸告維持錦州現狀之報告、特宣言如左、</p>
<p>國聯理事會放棄設置錦州中立地域案、與日本政府欲依中日直接交涉解决該問題之方針相一致、故日本政府僅關於放棄該案、自無異議、至勸告維持錦州地方之現奘一層、則因其結果足以使現在錦州地方之不安狀態、永遠繼續、故日本政府斷乎反對之、日本政府不僅以東北軍從錦州撤退爲滿足、必須同時使錦州政府取消並撤退、因張學良之勢力如猶有復歸滿洲之可能性、則維持滿洲之治安、必不可能故也、日外務省當局擬即發訓令於芳澤、囑其表明右述之立場、同時即力拒維持錦州現狀勸告案（八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本陸軍方面因國聯理事會决定放棄錦州中立區域案、所抱之意見大抵如左、</p>
<p>設置錦州中立區域問題、本非國聯理事會之提案、係中國央英法兩國向我國提出者、故國聯理事會無放棄中立地區案之必要、至於勸告維持錦州方面之現狀、尤其是偏頗之措置、無非中國方面欲圖長此保留、錦州之中國軍隊而已、果如此、則滿鐵沿綫之治安、必被破壞、故吾等絶對反對此勸告（八日日聯電）</p>

<p>莊警告中、要求張學良撤退錦州及錦州以東各地之軍隊、並謂日本視華軍民集錦州、實爲重大挑釁之行爲云、同時日政府承認張學良如不自行撤兵、則日本軍事當局决計用武力逼令爲之、蓋以禍根不除、則時局决不能安穩也、（八日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c16">國立大學校長辭職 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>以外交情勢之日趨嚴重。日來國内空氣極爲緊張。全國學生正請願示威。而繼之乃復有各地大學校長之一片辭職聲。際此最嚴重之時期。而負有領導靑年之重責之大學校長。乃皆相率辭職。用意何在。誠爲吾人所不解。</p>
<p>辭職之原因與用意。究何在乎。其謂敎導無方。材輇不足以膺此重責乎。則前此即不應接受委任。即知難而退。辭職亦不容遲至今日。如謂學生今日之請願示威。皆爲逸出軌外之行爲。皆爲囂張不可敎不足敎乎。則言情言理。學生犧牲其學業於無可奈何之中。爲救國而作仰天之長號。吾人但覺其行可敬。其心甚苦。而其事則至可哀。毫不覺其可惡可畏。此種可愛之靑年。正爲我國家將來之柱石。負有指導之責之師長。正應善爲誘掖。導其入於有效奮鬭之途。更何容抽身引退。退一步言。吾人即承認學生今日之行爲爲囂張。爲不安分。然溯其根源。學校平日之敎育究爲何事。大學校長詎又能辭其責。不善其始。而責其終。則今日與其責備學生。何如力自懺悔。與其消極辭職。何如以積極之精神。更切實負責以自贖。其謂時局艱難辦事棘手乎。則當此國勢阽危之秋。正國民人人奮起以共赴國艱之時。目前吾人但有奮鬭。但有人盡其責。人盡其能抱犧牲之决心。求十死中之一生。當國步艱難之日。殊非吾人潔身遠引之時。矧負有領導社會指導靑年之大學校長。而容於此時相率以辭退。然則今日國立大學校長之紛紛辭職。不僅爲輿論所不容。抑亦爲時勢所不許。</p>
<p>吾人認爲以内憂外患之嚴重刺激。積久萎靡不振之學生靑年。乃略有轉機。略呈活氣。吾人即認爲此一時期爲五四運動之復演。爲歷史與文化之推進。蓋不爲過當。敎育家正應趁此時機。急起而領導。如學生稍有行動。即覺其可憎可畏。是則惟願學生在機械敎育之下。靜心屏氣。目不旁觀。耳不旁聽。埋頭而讀其死書。此種敎育。是否爲今日所需要。是否爲今日所應有吾人稍一沉思。當可立辨。是則國立大學校長今日之相率辭職。因究何在。竟究何屬。　　國難當前。國民在今日之第一要著。即爲盡責。馬占山將軍以絶塞孤軍。糧盡援絶。而守士衛民。終始不放棄其責任。力抗暴軍。再接再厲。此種精神。誠爲國人今日所應師法。吾人謹以摯誠爲全國敎育家敬致忠告。國處危難。人應盡責。盡責即所以救國。亦即所以盡其國民一份子之義務若人人卸責。則責究將交與何人。潔身鳴高。此其時。如全國大學中學以至小學校長。人人都辭職引退。則我國内敎育將惟有全部宣告停頓之一法耳是烏乎可。是烏乎能。</p>

<p>近來暴日節節進攻、遼吉旣非復吾土、黑省又已告失陷、舉國人民誰不痛心、我們處在這種嚴重狀態之中、覺得發奮圖强、不容再緩、而發奮圖强的工作、也胥賴我國國民大家擔負起來、我敎育界諸同志、所負的責任、更爲重大、因爲受敎育者、或係靑年、或爲兒童、靑年是國家的柱石、兒童是未來的主人、没有强健完全的兒童、那裏會有强健完全的靑年、没有有爲的靑年、國家就失了元氣、所以小學敎育是一切敎育的基礎服務於小學敎育的同志們、所負的責任、可謂最繁重了、</p>
<p>我們在這種情形之下、對於兒童的敎育、應取怎樣的方針、在設施上應怎樣改進、很値得研究的、小學生能夠抗禦外侮麽、他能做切實的救國工作麽、當然不能的、因爲在童稚時代知識未足、能力不充、我們對於兒童、固不能呌他馬上能做救國工作、我們對於兒童、所要切實做的是「使兒童身體强健、培養用手用腦的習慣和吃苦耐勞的精神培植實力、以奠定日後救國的基礎」兒童僅曉得日本侵略東三省的事實、就能救國麽、不能、聽了敎師訓話說要怎樣救國、就能救國麽、也不能、要兒童日後能眞正做救國工作、必須培植救國的實力、</p>
<p>自從日本侵略東三省以來、一般小學校的敎學、都以這個事件爲中心、把各科敎材聯絡起來常常和小學生講抗日的辦法、表演日本暴行的情形、這些工作、固然很好、但僅偏向於知識方面、要知道要使小學生明了日本的暴行、是比較的容易的事、但是祇是呌小學生知道而不培養實力、那末所謂救國、眞是徒托空言了、</p>

<p>滬選中委候四屆全會處理</p>
<p>新聲社云、京代表李石曾、於前日下午奉命來滬後、於昨日下午四時許、與粤代表汪精衛、有長時間之談話、内容未詳、又粤四全會閉幕後、已派定孫科·伍朝樞·李文範·陳友仁·四代表、於昨日離港來滬、大約於明日下午、或後日早晨、可以抵滬、然後與京方代表、接洽第四屆中委第一次全體會議之開會事宜、至滬選中委十人、據汪精衛談、當候四屆全會處理、兹分誌各項消息如下、</p>
<p>汪李長談京方於前日下午五時許、派代表李石曾到滬、即於昨午與汪函約、在亞爾培路褚民誼宅晤談、汪於下午二時許、偕夫人陳璧君等、先到褚宅等候、至四時許、李氏始來、兩氏晤談約一時半之久、褚亦在座傍聽、直至六時半始去、事後據記者向汪探詢、汪謂、與李會晤、不過談談而已、並無何等討論、記者更向他方探詢、亦未得要領、所談内容、究爲何事、現尚未得其詳、</p>
<p>孫等來滬粤四全會閉幕後、已派定孫科·伍朝樞·李文範·陳友仁·四人來滬接洽、孫等本定前日（七日）離港、嗣後因時間匆促、乃改於昨日出發、據粤代表汪精衛談、本人已接到粤方來滬報告、粤方派孫伍李陳四人爲代表、於昨日乘大來公司輪船柯立芝總統號Pres.Coolige來滬、約於明日可望抵此、又據孫哲生夫人談、孫氏將乘飛機來滬、約於一二日内可抵此、未審何者爲確云、</p>
<p>十委問題、粤四全會退席代表、於日前在滬開會、所選出之十委問題、據汪談、此事無甚大問題、現粤方尚未正式承認京方所選出之二十四新委、京方亦未正式承認粤方所選出之二十四新委（記者按當日和會决議案有雙方所選新委、須互相追認之規定）故將來此十委、可聽四屆第一次執監全體會議處决、不使因此而引起何等糾紛、外間因此所發生之種種謡言、均不可信云、</p>

<p>團員競走該團以此行工作艱苦、决非秉賦衰弱身體不健者所能勉强勝任、故於昨日下午二時、在眞茹郊外作團員競走、凡四小時、擬將不能作長途步行者剔出、俾銳　中途發生進退兩難之感、</p>
<p>路局備車昨以中央方面探明該團全屬純潔份子、出於愛國熱忱、毫無黨派作用、認爲有贊助之可能、因不但不阻其行、且通令各地軍警、加以保護、並由鐵道部通令路局、爲備頭等車與乘坐、但該團心理、激於抗日救國、對榮辱問題早置度外、故一致表示必須貫澈初衷、仍各步行赴京云、</p>
<p>展期出發該團本定今早由眞茹出發、昨又臨時展期一天、准於明日侵晨步行赴京、</p>

<p>華東社云、本埠汽車編輯社張富天、近倣造美國單翼輕便飛機、以五閱月之工程、業已成功、兹將種種、彚誌如下、</p>
<p>倣造經過本年五月底、航空會議舉行時、張富天君以航空事業、近方日形發達、惟國人自建者則自海軍飛機製造處外、並無繼起之人、遂决自行試造飛機一架、惟以大者經費過鉅、遂决倣造美國單翼輕便飛機（RusselHendersonMonoplane)當即動工、至十月底、遂告成功、</p>
<p>機之費用機之引擎、係亨特生機器自由車之風冷式引擎、張君以三十元購來、機身之布、則係國貨粗布、漆及木料亦均國產、惟國產油漆、收縮力薄弱、不能經空氣之變化、故機翼（翼係英產細紗、以國產品不能合用也）經三次之拉緊工作、始得成就、惟尚不合與外機相較也、其助張君工作者、則爲做沙發椅之裁縫、普通之木匠、普通之汽車銅匠、其視察横直平者、則以在國内該項機件無處購置、故用普通之水平、各項費用、計共一千四百元、較向外購置、每機須七萬餘元者、僅及其六十分之一也、據張君語華東社記者、第二架成功、費用且可低减云、</p>
<p>機之種種該機馬力僅二十三匹、氣缸四只、速率每小時七十哩、每一分鐘可高飛八○○尺、惟僅可坐司機一人、</p>
<p>機身一瞥機長十五呎餘、闊二十六呎、翼黄、枕及上下升降機亦黄色、機首兩側紅色、機身綠色、可儲油三加倫、能飛三小時、</p>
<p>呈請試飛張君於該機成功後、即向中國航空公司航空工廠等請求試飛、以各方婉拒、故不得不呈請航空署試飛、業已得航空署允准、派員審核、再行定期試飛、並頗奬勵張君之倣造、且已令將造價等等呈報矣、</p>
<p>張君略歷張君爲江蘇六合人、年三十六、美國萬國函授學校機械科畢業、歷任汽車汽船工程、並曾著實用汽車修理學與工作法、最近實用汽車學附修理法諸書云、</p>

<p>渝蓉試航成都設站一事、該公司疊與川省當局電洽、近頃已獲川省主席劉文輝首肯、機塲即勘擇成都鳳凰山附近之平原、廣漠平垣、頗宜設塲、該站所須無線電機、刻已在滬購定、不久即可運去、并於本月中旬實行渝蓉段試航、機用京平線陸上飛機、因此間相距密邇、飛行祗經二小時平、正式通航期、不出兩個月、</p>

<p>（一）軍事訓練、可分三組、一·高中大學學生、二·工商界願受訓練之靑年、三·劃定户口調查淸楚之地忟、試辦徵兵、一·二·兩組、期以一年訓練完成如北平一地、即可試辦徵兵五千、如繼續辦二年、即可得精兵二萬、</p>
<p>（二）學校軍事訓練、每日訓練二小時、要繼續不間斷、訓練時早晨不如晚間、晚間操可練習夜戰、操練地操塲不如野外、最好白天讀書、晚間上操、</p>
<p>（三）操練時不必一定用槍、非槍槍不能操練、此說大謬、普通作戰、六百米達以外用砲、三百米達以上、六百米達以下、用步槍、步槍之效力甚小、歐戰時除用大砲外、即衝鋒、最後勝負之决定、全在一塲肉搏、你能把身體練好、用刀用槍、短妨刃相接、我剌敵能致死、敵剌我僅致傷、則我勝、不要說、將來實行打仗步槍未必有許多、即有槍、未必全可用、故重在習技擊、練身體、行動須矯捷强健、此層關係、十分重要、</p>
<p>（四）且在夜戰時、最忌用步槍、槍鳴即無異告敵以所在、故衝鋒肉搏、多在夜間、然多不在野地、此時學生操練、所以必在晚間不惟時間經濟、（不妨碍讀書）抑且用以練目力、（夜間動作、愈練則眼愈明）將來與人眞至開戰、彼有砲火飛機、我不能抵抗、但兩軍接近光具有肉搏的技能、足使敵之砲火、飛機、步槍、完全失其效用、</p>
<p>（五）不惟野外操練、十分重要、大霧大雨、努力操練、尤爲十分重要、學生有志救國、如不能吃得這樣苦、便是無希望、辦軍事訓練的人如不能明了這一點、也是無希望、</p>
<p>（六）所以現在要辦軍事訓練、最好是「活」辦、不要「死」辦、死辦吃力多、未必討好、活辦便可事半而功倍、</p>
<p>（七）現在一般學生的習慣、皆是好聽軍事學功課、此是偷懶的表徵、軍事學是軍官所需要的、不是當兵所需要的中國現在不怕没有好軍官、最怕没有好兵士、軍事訓練的目的、第一在養成大多數好兵士、第二方是養成下級好軍官、如人人皆願充做軍官、則軍事訓練、一定失敗、</p>

<p>甲午中日之役。淸廷命李鴻章與日議和。償金割地。爲莫大之國恥。其議和之地。爲日本馬關之春帆樓。故名曰馬關條約。桐城文豪吳摯父游日本。偶經其地。遂於春帆樓上題一額曰。「傷心之地」。詩人吳彥復之父保初將軍又吟一詩曰。「萬頃雲濤立海灘。天風浩蕩白鷗閒。舟人那識傷心地。惟指前程是馬關。」今則暴日寇邊。遼東三省。淪爲倭奴蹂躙之地。則傷心又爲何如也。噫。</p>

<p>小徒弟列傳之一</p>
<p>佛蘭克林自己和他的幼子則在次年即一七五二年六月在費城Philadelphia放那千古不朽之風筝。這風筝是値得叙述的。一般人只知道佛蘭克林放風筝是人類第一次從天空取電下地，其實這是第二次，那上天取電的急先鋒是達巴利與德羅，佛蘭克林却是他們的總司令。放風筝是佛蘭克林親自向天空作戰。佛蘭克林的風筝本身是用木架與絲綢。做的：木架上揷一尖鋭的金屬絲，雙股繩之下端繫一銅鎖匙和一根絲帶，風筝放入雲中，手持絲帶站在門檻中，以防絲帶爲雨所濕。不久，只見雙股繩之鬆紗怒竪如野猪剌，手指可與相吸，指骨碰着鎖匙即發火花。他又將閃電引下蓄在來登瓶中，證明它的動作與摩擦電無異。照近代電學理論看來，佛蘭克林手持絲帶離銅鎖匙太近是要被電打死的。做這實騐，人要離得很遠才行。十四個月之後，俄國聖彼得堡有位物理學家用一鐵棍取天空之電。走近測電器一看便被一球藍火打死。佛蘭林克之所以没有死，怕是因爲他放風筝的那一天，只有少量的閃電，眞是徼倖！否則佛蘭克林必以生命殉科學了。</p>
<p>佛蘭克林是一位多才多藝的人，他從科學之研究始終只有九年，而貢獻於世界的有火爐，避雷針，以太光波學說，印磁銅板，印刷機，雙視眼鏡，自鳴鐘，與他的電的理論。據他自己說他的實騐得力於徒弟時代之工藝參觀很多，這種爲擇業而舉行之親切之工藝參觀却是他的父親，一位蠟燭肥皂匠，在兒童敎育上之一大發明。（完）（這次因對國事要說的話太多，致使這篇小傳中斷許久，不勝抱歉。）</p>

<p>聞所未聞的超貓最近世界科學界中。傳播一段很有趣味的消息。便是蘇俄的科學家們正在孜孜研究。想使一頭家畜。能兼備綿羊山羊與母牛最良好的性質。這一件事倘能試騐告成。那麽將三種獸畜的最惡劣的性質混合在一起。更爲容易。可是植物界中曾有接種的事。早已平淡無奇。就是動物界中。有時也有新的種類發見。　巴黎有一位博士。從事於鼠的研究。爲了撲滅鼠類起見。特地養成一種超貓。比了平常的貓。更碩大而更兇惡。能在規定時間内捕殺多量的鼠。此事現已試騐成功。但據一般人說。這種超貓。不必提倡。本來平常的貓已含有一絲野性。野性發作時。甚是可怕。倘養了超貓。那麽它不但會殺多量的鼠。恐怕有害於人類哩。</p>

<p>諸壯士旣慷慨訣别。吹號登車。我心抑抑。愈思愈慚。慚我懦怯。未能捨生相從。徒盡棉薄。寗足贖我怕死之罪。</p>
<p>雖然彼輩親愛誓死之同胞。俱赤手空拳。或有祇御單袷者。塞北苦寒。必致未死于敵。先死于泠。是可哀也。我今敬代此數百爲國犧牲之先覺同胞。祈求各界熱心人士。踴躍輸將。以全若輩忠勇之志。願望非奢。力量爲之可矣。</p>

<p>樣子雷</p>
<p>民國七年朱啟鈐奉使至南京。於圖書館中見寫本宋李誡所著營法式一書。亟取而表章之。付諸影印。於是世人始漸知八百年前吾國有此一建築學者。以歷來從未筆之於書之工程法式。貽厥後人。雖李氏所生之北宋。已爲建築術衰落時代。然而宋明以來相承之風格。得稍考見其源流。已爲極可珍之文獻矣。嗣後以書中圖象未備。不足以資證明。乃遍取四庫全書中現存之兩本。比較而勘補之。屬陶湘郭葆昌二氏爲董理其事。於是有民國十四年重校精刋之大字本。其中綵繪色澤。重疊相宣。鮮潔奪目。今由商務印書館經售。價至七十餘元者也。朱氏研究古今建築數十年。民國初年北京諸新建築。若正陽門。若文華武英二殿。若中央公園。皆出朱氏手筆。融合新舊。悉具雅裁。爲中外人士所交口稱道。至今北平具有近都美之規模者。朱氏之功也。民國十八年。朱氏出其歷年蒐輯之圖畫模型。開展覽會於中央公園。次年得中華文化基金會之資助。設中國營造學社於北平。每年出彚刋四次。復時開成績展覽會。而尤以二十年三月所開之圓明遺物展覽會爲最有興味。斯會之動機則由於十九年與北平圖書館合購樣子雷模型之事。樣子雷者。承辦宫殿陵墓工程之世業工師。國有大工。必取給於彼。故其家有嘉道以來各大工之圖樣數千件。朱氏任内務總長時。即耳其名而訪求之。雷氏避不肯見。近年爲生計所迫。始托人到處兜售。累代珍藏。漸有分散之虞。乃由北平圖書館出貲全數收買。約費六七千元。其中關於圓明園者即有圖式一千八百餘件。模型十八具。此事轟傳於一時。學術界中莫不以先覩爲快也。圓明文獻中最爲中外人七所注目者。爲諧奇趣西洋樓水法圖二十葉。此圖係乾隆銅版。現在已發現者。北平故宫及遼寗熱河兩行宫所藏。又北平舊家所藏原印本與席倫氏北京皇宫考日本世界美術全集所載今昔對照之圖相合。若與最近殘破狀况相較。更覺不堪寓目矣。圓明被毁。迄今已七十年。及見盛時之狀者。殆已絶無僅有。故園中博采西洋建築之事。幾不爲人所知。從前作游記歌詩者。亦不甚措意及此。近始有學者參合中西紀載。而决當時有西洋人參定圖式也。嗟乎。夕陽野草。斷甓零椽。此中貯先民多少血淚後之人其可不長懸心目而以之自警哉。</p>

<p>第一章漁陽鼙鼓</p>
<p>太陽國軍趕到校門口。預備學生們或要抵抗。先將兩架機關槍架好。然後大聲呐喊。衝突而入。此時好似到了一大隊强盗。四面搜索。早將校長熊鳳拘捕。送到他們的司令部中去。大多數的學生業已幽匿。也有少許作了俘虜。有兩個太陽軍趕到女生宿舍裏搜索。好似獵犬一般。耽耽欲噬。此時在那第十號宿舍裏面。有一個女生。年可二十左右。嬌嫩的玉顔上泛着慘白的顔色。正把室門用桌椅緊緊頂住。可是那狡猾的太陽軍。似乎早已知道裏面有他們的目的物。急用槍柄將門猛敲。不多幾下。門已傾倒。兩個太陽軍從桌子上跳進室中。瞧着那蜷伏一偶的女生。不禁露出得意的面色。齊向女生走來。一邊口裏操着華語說道。小姑娘不要驚慌。我們是來保護你的。只要你知情凑趣。能給我們樂一下。包管你性命無虞。說罷一步一步的逼向上前。那女生猶如待死的小鹿。將膏虎狼的饒吻。而那兩個太陽軍又似兩個魔鬼。張開血盆大嘴。要把這如花如玉的女學生吞下肚去了。但是這女生危險當頭。無可倖免。忽然一度驚慌的神情而爲剛嚴的態度。身軀也不再退縮了。挺直地立着。圓睜雙目。向他們叱駡道。狗。慘無人道的賊子。我願一死。誰敢犯我。說時大有凛然不可侵犯的樣子。一個太陽兵見伊如此。倒有些呆住了。一個太陽兵却獰笑道。好。你駡起人來了。你要死。我偏不讓你就死咧。說着話撲到女生身前。想來抓伊。女生急切没有抵禦。恰巧背後開着的窗沿上有一個墨水瓶。女生急急取在手中。照準那太陽兵面門擲去。正中鼻子。打得他鼻破血流。濺得一臉的墨水。不由惱羞成怒。擎起盒子砲。對着女生要放。只聽砰的一聲。一個人影仰後而倒。</p>

<p>光陰荏苒。歲月如流。刹眼之間。一九三一年又將與我人唱慘别之歌。而一九三二年不久又將與我人見面矣。當此歲尾年頭。歐美各國之車廠。又正忙於計劃或製造一九三二式新車矣。且有若干廠家新車業已問世。據最近傳來之消息。此種新車。滬上亦不日行將運到。公開展覽矣。兹將第一批來滬之標準牌新車。詳述其優點於左。想亦爲讀者的樂聞也。</p>
<p>主要優點合乎經濟回憶標準牌新車。自問世以來。已二十八年於兹矣。是以今年之新車。亦由二十八年來所得經騐之結晶。而當計劃構造之初。所費金錢。又何止萬鎊。加之工程師及一般普通工人。歷來已費去不少腦力。而始得產生一九三二式新車。此種新車。我人目覩之下。必覺萬分驚奇。蓋其中主要優點、即在合乎經濟原理。駕駛之時。萬分舒適。然售價旣低。而行車之時費用又極節省。嚴格言之。歷來英國各廠所產之新車。其成績從未有若是其優良也。車主一經購得此種新車而後。可保萬分滿意。就近來社會方面而言。文化日進。而所需汽車。對於外觀方面。亦爲重要問題。此一九三二式標準牌新車。形式方面。亦極盡美雅之能事。以新車之種類而言。共分四種。即二十號。十六號。大九號及小九號是也。　　低價汽車當推獨步在此種新車之中。我人一經購買。即可知其内部之構造。有若干優點。歷來僅高價汽車則有之。低價汽車。則必無如此優美。譬如盛油箱置於後部。萬分安全。半橢圓形之彈簧。前後兩部。均裝减震器。馬格那式之車輪。不碎玻璃之風鏡等。歷來均爲高價車所獨具者也。然標準牌一九三二式新車。裝有上述各種器物。而售價依然低廉。豈非成功之出品。而足供社會之需要乎。</p>
<p>行車之時汽油極省。不寗惟是。標準牌新車。當製造之時。對於汽油之經濟。尤爲注要問題。是以行車之時。油量之消耗。爲任何汽車所不及。而同時行車之安全。以及行路之能力。又未見少損絲毫。</p>
<p>行車便利駕馭安舒標準新車。除汽油之經濟而外。行車之便利。駕馭之安舒。亦莫不令人滿意。車主一經購得。不難加以證明。是故標準牌汽車。最適於婦女之駕駛也。一言以蔽之。標準牌新車。駕駛之時。輕便。光滑。簡單。便利。處置裕如。制輪力量强大制動便利。在在足使駕車人滿意者也。</p>
<p>車身優美别樹一幟標準牌新車之車主。當其駛車外出之時。在車室之中。絶無絲毫之拘束。即或在粗糙不平之路上。亦無震盪之虞。是故一切爆發震裂等事。均可勿憂。是以標準標新車之車身。出諸名工之手。而安全問題。處處顧到。所有標準牌新車。車身均用鋼板製造。車門四扇。嵌以假象牙。尤覺使人悅目。是故新車之構造。不特機件優良。即車身亦改進不少也。</p>
<p>四部分速聲息全無此種新車。當行駛於道路之中。種種優點。尤覺令人驚奇。在平常通路之中。行駛之時。祇須用第二擋排。而最高之擋排。其成績亦有特優之處。齒輪共分四部分速。用第三擋排之時。聲息全無。尤爲特優之處。設代以三部分速之齒輪盒。則第二擋排。即可不發細小之聲息矣。</p>
<p>减熱裝置採用新法减熱器完全採用新法製造。而外觀尤見令人有深刻之印象。是亦不失爲標準牌新車之特殊優　也。外面所刷之條線。頗見美觀。今人目覩之下。即知新車駕馭之時。有特殊之優點。而萬分舒適者也。</p>
<p>新式車頂開閉便利據標準標新車製造者所言。一九三二式新車。一車可作兩用。駛車外出。車中所坐之人。欲禦風擋雨。則可緊閉車頂。形同轎車無異。然欲日光之透射。或空氣之淸鮮。則揭去車頂。或一敞車。是故所有一九三二式標準牌新車。均用斯丹立脫斜形車頂StanliteSlidineRoofo而車頂開閉之時。萬分便利及迅速。即行車之時。亦可隨時開閉。車主一經購用。即可知此種車頂之便利矣。</p>
<p>聞此種新車。到滬而後。將陳列於靜安寺路七百零二號樣子間。屆時滬地人士。欲購汽車者。大可前往一觀也。</p>

<p>雪氏成功小史之一叚</p>
<p>號稱「法蘭西之亨利福特」安德立雪鐵龍氏。新近由法啓程。往美訪問各汽車製造業鉅商氏在美時曾造各著名汽車工廠。加以考察。因之招持雪氏之主人。渠等意念之中咸有一種感想。不知雪鐵龍返法之時。又將有何種心得加入其所造之汽車中也。一九一二年時。此法蘭西汽車鉅商往美遊歷。採取美人之大量汽車製造法。返法之後立施實用。於是汽車之出數亦大增。一九二三年雪氏再度遊美。此次渠之所得更多、一待買棹歸去。不啻滿載而返。將在美考察時之一切心得。運用廠中。於是雪鐵龍廠之產額。一躍而爲每日兩百輛矣。至於此屆之行。則說者謂雪鐵龍所抱之宏願更大。且所得亦必更多。渠將在美設立一雪鐵龍支廠也。</p>
<p>雪鐵龍雖有「法蘭西之亨利福特」之雅號。然渠之日常生活實與福特迴異。雪鐵龍之雙親家頗富裕。故雪氏與福特不同。早年曾受相當之機械工程學識。氏雖年已五十有四。短小精悍。活潑潑地。鬚髮稀朗。風采煥發。鼻架目鏡。炯炯眼光。令人一望而知其爲才識之士也。</p>
<p>雪鐵龍於開始其業務時。廠中祗造齒輪機械。其後方改造汽車。及至大戰爆發。氏乃投身軍中。爲國效勞。曾在前線工程隊中執役六個月。政府對於雪氏之臂助甚爲重視。氏乃被任於短時間中。成立一製造砲彈之軍需廠。五個月後廠即告成。製造砲彈無數。直至大戰告畢此廠日造砲彈五○·○○○枚焉。雪鐵龍知戰事不能過久。渠乃决意將此砲彈廠改成爲製造汽車之工廠。一九一九年三月。砲彈廠停止工作。至是年七月而雪鐵龍汽車廠乃落成。從此將專製殺人利器之軍械廠。</p>
<p>一變而爲造福人羣之汽車廠。雪氏之卓見遠識。誠足多也。</p>
<p>雪鐵龍氏之冒險工作有類賭博。然其汽車廠則不啻博而贏也。渠於游戲之賭博固亦深嗜者。雪氏某次在第維爾賭博·贏得美金七○○·○○○元。又一次作紙牌戲。輸去美金四○○·○○○元。然此一局之後。渠之銀行家即告以中止行博。俾得保持其之業務。雪鐵龍從之。專心於造車之業。及至今日常年可產一○○·○○○輛。車之大小種類不一。四汽缸及六汽缸者咸俱。售價每輛自美金九○○元起。雪鐵龍之商業方法殊爲人所稱許。實可推爲歐洲人中之美國式商人。渠曾作各種廣告方法。以吸引顧客之購買。至其設計之精妙。即美國之著名廣告家亦當自嘆弗如也。其廣告中之最著名而最偉大者。厥爲租賃巴黎鐵塔作爲廣告地位。此塔名愛菲爾鐵塔。爲世界著名之高建築物。雪鐵龍氏租得廣告地位後。即在其中滿裝電光燈彩紮成「雪鐵龍」字樣。並將其出品汽車之優點等。一一標明。令人注意。此外又有廣告性質之盛舉一件。此雖非直接之廣告。然其令人注意之功效。則與鐵塔廣告收同等之效力。此項廣告維何。即雪鐵龍汽車之第一渡越薩哈拉沙漠是也。雪鐵龍汽車之穿越沙漠。係自阿爾裘里亞出發。終點在鐵姆勃克土。其中相去計三·○○○英里雪鐵龍之機師在車輪之下製一橡皮輪底。故其行過漠地之時。宛若軍用坦克之裝有金屬輪底者也。</p>
<p>雪鐵龍汽車廠除甲佛爾灘外。尚有支廠五處。各廠規模均大。僱工有四·○○○人之多。渠廠中出品。每日可造車三○○輛。此數若與美洲各汽車廠之出品數相比較。似屬爲數有限。然在法蘭西境内則當推雪鐵龍爲最鉅也。其所產常佔全國百分之二十。</p>
<p>關於雪鐵龍之軼事。有爲常人所稱道者。姑述一則如次。亦足見雪氏之爲人也。法蘭西有某童者。一日致書雪氏。略稱渠在家庭及學校中。品學均優。渠已將父親給予之零錢積儲成爲小銀元兩枚。此童書至此。乃述其意曰。渠欲將此小銀元兩枚購一雪鐵龍汽車。雪氏接信之後頗爲欣喜。乃復一信。招之使來。童旣至。雪氏乃導之往汽車陳列室中週視一匝。並告童曰。若所喜何車。今可撰擇其一。此童熟視一過。忽對雪氏曰。「否。余今見此汽車。余已决意保持吾之兩枚小銀元矣」。</p>

<p>英倫新設福特車廠。美國福特汽車廠向執世界汽車製造業之牛耳。近復注重於海外事業之發展。除地屈立屋總廠外。在各重要區域分設支廠。專造福特汽車。以資各地方之應用。其英國支廠業已成立。廠址在泰晤士河畔。離英京倫敦約十八英里。地名達勤哈姆。將來歐洲市塲所需之福特汽車。即由此廠製造。英倫福特汽車廠規模甚屬宏大。除美合衆國内各大汽車廠外。全球各地當以此廠爲最鉅矣。達勤哈姆廠址極大。計佔地一百十英畝。另有餘地四百八十四英畝。可供擴充之用。工廠前面離泰晤士河約有半英里之遥。此項空地上可供堆儲原料。製就之汽車亦可由此裝上輪船或火車。運往他處。廠中設備亦有可得而言者。製造工塲及配置工塲之房屋。長一千尺。寛三百尺。兩屋間之廣塲寛八十尺。上有遮蓋。行駛軌車。熔爐重五百噸。爲英倫南部之最鉅者。化矽機亦重五百噸。副產之骸炭爐計四十五起。每日可使八百噸之煤成爲炭化云。</p>
<p>美國汽車市塲近况。自十月至十二月</p>
<p>爲一年中汽車市塲之最後一季。美國有經騐之汽車製造家常稱此時爲觀望之季。因顧客方面常於此時觀望不前也。大概明年之新車常於一歳之末發現市上。故顧客方面每每不即購買。以待各車出齊後。再行購置撰擇。照現在之情况而論。市塲上雖有滯塞之象。然不久即能消除。因大多數之顧客不能久待。終必擇購一車也。大凡一車之使用多則三年少則一二年。車主必有調購新車之意。故填舊亦爲汽車市塲之重要發展。譬如一九二九年時曾銷新車六、○○○、○○○輛。則至明年此項舊車勢必棄置不用。而另購新車以代。至於製造商方面則常於此時促令車主調購新車。並以其舊車折價相抵。職是之故。新舊交替之時。不論賣主或買主咸有觀望之象。至於銷車。則以售於已有汽車者爲較易。若以汽車之使用爲富人之一種玩物。其銷車於具有此種心理之人則大難矣。故目下汽車之銷售。其趨勢方面實較昔日爲易也若與十年前相較。其相去尤遠。其時銷車九、○○○、○○○輛。尚有許多之人未獲駕駛汽車之機會耳。一九二一年時銷車	約一百五十萬輛。於是各人心中咸有市塲過飽之虞。然未隔數年。汽車製造家咸以「一個家庭一輛汽車」爲號召。約計之共有二五、○○○、○○○個家庭。其後此事果然實現。於是又變其口號爲「家庭中每人須有汽車一輛」。從此銷車之範圍尤廣矣。</p>

<h3 id="c192">影戲素描盧夢殊斷橋殘夢 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>（一）介紹詞</p>
<p>以一部有了藝術評價的文學作品、演譯成了一部超然的有聲影戲、在雷馬克的「西綫無戰事」得到了偉大的成功之後、足以在電影史上與它後先映輝而另創了一頁新的紀錄的、據我個人看來、要算瑟武德（RobertEmmettSherwood）</p>
<p>的「斷橋殘夢」（WaterlooBridge原譯「滑鐵盧橋」）了、非戰作品向來引不起我的興致、非戰影戲尤其是使我棄之如遺、似這麽一個不肯頽廢而抛棄本人對於影戲一向的主張、便使我在「西綫無戰事」之出映時、雖然在上海市曾經轟動了一時、也不給它有個片言加以介紹了、固然像西綫無戰事」那麽一張片子、自有它的偉大的地方、本用不着我來評價、但、我個人對於影戲所要求的主觀條件、不得不在這裏有所伸說了、我以爲今日的中國、内裏已是物腐蟲生千瘡百孔、而環境又復剝削侵蝕、蹂躙摧磨、在藝術上如果没有一種强烈的「力」來外攘内安、醫潰療廢、則快要踏上脚來的危機、便不祇如今日的籬撤藩摧、喪師失地而已了、影戲是轉移一般意志、改變一般情感的綜合藝術、在今日的國情之下、尤應借重它拿「好勇鬥狠」四字來作爲民衆敎育的實施方針、使害了黄膽病似地一盤散沙似地的中國民族轉過生來、有着「力」的團結、給在民族意識的立塲上產生了全中國的男女們都是健全强毅沉着勇敢的丘九、中國的丘八、在事實已經告訴我們是靠不住的了、上級的祇是拿個人的享樂主義來縱慾恣情、下級的呢也祇有糜餉耗糈、臨陣退縮、可是、我還得聲明、天涯自有芳草、我說的捕八並不包括馬占山將軍、因爲馬占山將軍和他部下一班健兒竟然在二十萬雄師、望風披靡之中、大義獨饒、孤軍抗日、雄邁剛健、勇毅精忠、實然是我們所最最需要的丘八、至於祇肯在桃源樂士似的上海市裏像猿猴般跳、像猪玀般嘷、却不肯眞的去作「力」的准備的、靑年呢、我還說他們没有資格去做丘九、</p>
<p>我對於非戰影戲之所以棄之如遺、與及對於影戲所要求的主觀條件便有如上述、但亦並不是絶對地贊成戰爭的作品、總以它不失了電影藝術所固有的使命爲先决問題、如果有一張片子是渺乎其小而爲人所擯棄但電影藝術的使命却竟强烈地表現出來的、我也必然地認定它是有功世道人心之作、即如「西綫無戰事、」我雖然不曾加以介紹、却也不曾表示反對、因它有它的偉大的地方、那就是所謂電影藝術的使命、聽說它在中國已遭禁映了、禁映的時候是在蔣主席移節南昌、算起來已經好幾個月了、像這麽一種防微杜漸的政策是否適當我不能加以批評、但我總該爲「西線無戰事」呼寃原因它雖然是拿着非戰來做它的題旨的尖端、可在演述的上頭確是很有力地很顯明地激發人們愛護民族、拯救國家的情緒、</p>
<p>回轉來說吧、上面我曾經說過丘九、丘九已然在「斷橋殘夢」的裏頭、它雖然並没有丘九的榜樣給我們瞧、可我們中國一般靑年的嘴唇邊所時時吊羞的「救國不忘戀愛、戀愛不忘救國」的口號却在它的裏面很明顯地很意識地映現出來敎人怎樣去實行這條標語了、西洋的電影它的題材無論是如何地荒唐無稽、粗劣惡俗、總是站在民族的面前負起它所固有的使命的、我們在西洋影戲上享受異異情調所得到的認識便就是了然於西洋民族所以强盛之由、它的鞏固的基礎並不是由於一國政府在短時期内給它築成、確實是古今來的藝術家們的不竭底努力的非常成就、羅馬非一日的羅馬、我們在今日的情勢之下不能否、不得不期望於我們中國的藝術家、然而我們中國的藝術家們怎樣呢、啊、是如何地使人見了感到悽咽、</p>
<p>「斷橋殘夢」是與「西線無戰事」同在美國寰球城的攝影塲裏產生出來的、據寰球影片公司自己的宣稱、它是在「西線無戰事」後僅有之作、是一個特殊的成就、是一張不平常而緊凑的片子、聽說電影明星范朋克也曾加以讚美、而美國的電影愛好者們的一致的推崇尤其是在影戲院的紀錄上有着事實的告訴、總之、它是一張超然的有聲影片是絶對他不給人們有若何的懐疑的、原因、它是一班從事的人們的心血所結成、並不是一件尋常而且普通的產品、</p>
<p>講到這一班從事的人們、我該得在這裏連帶地擇要介紹、</p>
<p>（二）原著者瑟武德</p>
<p>先是天才是不大靠得住的、天才而有了學識和經騐才是一位成功的藝術家、我於瑟武德（RobertSmmittSherwooed)先就表示敬意了、雖則說他在文壇上並不像其他的作家似地先吹好了一個顯赫的名兒、但、他的作品裏頭一副表現藝術的手腕是那麽地高超、眞令人不勝佩服、讀者諸君懐疑我的說話麽、試一看「斷橋殘夢」的内心描寫塲面表現、便可以了然了、且不必屏心靜氣細細地去讀那本原著、</p>
<p>這位可讚美的作家在中國人的眼光看來、要說他是一位夠資格做老頭兒的吧、他在一八九六年四月四日那天便生到婆娑國土裏來的、算起來有四十多歲了、他的誕生的地方是美國紐約的新羅舍勒、他在婆娑國土裏純粹是一位美國人、他早就天才卓特、及長、入哈佛大學的文科專攻文學、他旣得天獨厚、又復努力鑽研、故造詣之深、就非常人所及、是以在哈佛裏的成就便很是驚人、畢業後、本其素志、從事於文化事業、藉以發展自己的天才、兼作「時髦社會」（VanityFair)雜誌的戲劇與「生活」雜誌的社會兩欄的編輯、以取材的新頴編排的有致、大受社會人士的歡迎、更又時時發表論文、批評電影與戲劇、不久、就成功了一位戲劇與電影的批評家、</p>
<p>往後他的識騐愈多、才藝益復、便辭退編輯的職務、專心致志於劇藝的創作、所著劇本加「到羅馬之路」（The　to　Kome)、「愛巢」（The　LoveNest）「皇后的丈夫」（TheQueen'sHusband）等等、俱見到他的天才而爲美國文壇僅有之作、後以全力成「斷橋殘夢」益爲文壇所推許、而他的劇作家的地位便從此穩定而高巍名兒也就由此顯著、</p>
<p>他在「斷橋殘夢」寫成了後、曾特自到加利福尼亞省逛了一回、在巡禮聖林時、親自到寰球城裏去訪問寰球公司的導演詹姆士華爾（JamesWhale）與他商洽把「斷橋殘夢」如何地搬到銀幕上去、識貨的華爾自然是有着十二分的歡迎、就由寰球少主小卡爾的示可而歸華爾導演之下定期開拍、如萊塢裏的劇本作家從來與影片公司没多大密切的、劇本交來、稿費拿去、便成功了這一筆文人的交易了、至於那劇本是如何地分幕、如何地攝拍、自有負責辦理的人、作者永不過問、但是、瑟武德就不然了、他竟把那老例一拳打破、拿了稿資還不走開、老是躱在攝影塲裏、跟在華爾的屁股後頭看他的「斷橋殘夢」是如何的電影化、</p>
<p>華爾並不是一位隨便的導演家、至少、他的思想與才識要在劉别謙之上、固然是遠不及卓别林、所以、瑟武德一看了他導演了幾幕就莫名地驚嘆了、他於是肯定他的「斷橋殘夢」除了華爾去導演之外再也找不到第二人、他就此向華爾告辭、離了寰球城回抵己居去、他在離開寰球城的時候、曾經發表過幾句談話、</p>
<p>「我知道再没有别人夠得上華爾那麽的資格來導演「斷橋殘夢」的了、因爲他完全組織在一千九百十七年給空軍猛烈轟擊了後的倫敦、那是全劇所有重要部分的最重要的一點意象是我在劇本裏特自表現出來的、「斷橋殘夢」並不是用一種通常的故事組織出來、它是在大戰時期一般民衆給嚴重壓迫了情緒的映現、丨全劇焦點、就是在那麽一個非常的組織、</p>
<p>「我在攝影場裏參觀「斷橋殘夢」的結果、我就證明有幾幕很重要的部分、實然使我承認梅卡麗克（MoeClarke）女士表演得很有精彩、活然地好像我劇本裏眞的梅拉（Myra劇中人）跑了出來一般、那一個生活在倫敦的美國歌女、她全部分給大戰的影響、在生活上感受着無限的艱苦與困難、同時又在戀的進程中受到種種的創痛、梅女士那麽的非常表演我眞未之前見、所以、梅拉在大戰期中以歌女而流爲遍地哀鴻中的一人的痛苦竟在梅女士的神態之間曲曲傳出以博觀在的感慨、梅女士是特自聘來担任表演爲梅拉一角的困難部分的、在「斷橋殘夢」裏梅拉一角的表演實在是不大容易、祇有梅女士才能夠表演出來、我於她的表演的技能着實的不勝佩服、她與男演員肯陶格拉斯合演的幾個鏡頭也是非常有精彩、</p>
<p>「斷橋殘夢」之電影化、竟如此地超然、是使我無限歡欣與滿意、因爲我喜歡這本劇本比我以前所寫的甚麽都來得深摯、」</p>

<p>默下去、可依還是瞑思靜想、追求對像、大約是去找他那下一本劇本的燃士比里純、</p>
<p>（三）導演者詹姆士華爾</p>
<p>一張片子的攝製、在一班職員中除了作者之外居着重要的地位的要算導演了、導演如果有天才、有學識、對於一本劇本的原意的奥妙所在能夠看得穿、瞧得透、那張片子的出映使自然地有很多驚人的地方了、如果他是一個庸材、那末、劇本縱然寫得精彩非常也得給那庸材蹧蹋了去、但是非所論於詹姆士華爾、　　詹姆士華爾因爲導演成功「斷橋殘夢」之故、名兒已飛上天去了、然而這一位有闡發劇本的精要的技能的導演家、他的才幹並不是在一日的裏面養成的、他本來是一位戲劇家、在一八九六年七月二日生於大不列顚、但是沉靜寡言從少至老都是一樣、他學於英倫、但從未受過大學敎育、他曾經入過行伍、做過軍官、在歐戰時、曾給德軍捉去了去做俘擄、在德國牢獄裏過了兩牢的牢獄生活、</p>
<p>在牢獄裏、他就有了戲劇的意識、注意到戲劇場面的表情、便在獄中開始他的戲劇工作、一路到大戰告終爲止、在休戰條約簽訂時他回到英倫、在英倫排演美國史劇「林肯」、旋到倫敦實現他的戲劇生活、在他的進展與成功的途徑上他的作品就很爲驚人、而且是大量生產、最成功的有「櫻桃圃」（CheryOrchard）「戰之囚徒」（Prisoners　ofWar）「海鷗」（TheSeaGul)及其他等、</p>
<p>華爾在演劇方面旣已得到了成功、便再進一步去致力於導演方面、導演是比表演來得煩難的、因爲兩方面的個性都要有深切的認識、還有其他種種的支配、種種的斟酌、和種種的佈置更不必說、但是、華爾在嘗試期内、以識騐的豐富、也有相當的收穫、并且逐步得到進展、在英國的劇壇上站着重要的地位「旅行的末路」一劇是他在導演方面最偉大的成功、</p>
<p>「旅行的末路」的成就使他更擴展他的野心、更增長了他的慾望、也許是他老人家在戲劇上面頑得膩煩、想走進電影的園地裏去做一位老圃、電影比戲劇更是不同、雖然有人說、電影與戲劇的基本原則是没有異樣、但至少、空間與時間都比戲劇寛大得多、在組織上頭、又截地兩樣、然而、才識俱優的華爾、正合着「能者無所不能」的一句老話、居然也得到成功、本其所固有的識見與天才、將他的「旅行的末路」電影化、同時、又來到美國的聖林、在寰球城的寰球影片公司裏的導演席上佔了一把椅子、如今、又把一副重量的担子担負起來、成功了瑟武德的傑作「斷橋殘夢」「斷橋殘夢」不是容易導演的在影壇上實是一件艱難的工作、而華爾竟毅然地担任起來、並且得到了成功、眞令人驚嘆</p>
<p>這位才識俱優的導演是一位身長玉立、沉默寡言的英國人、有冷靜的頭腦、有安祥的態度、遇事輒先加以觀察然後施諸實行、有自信心、却不肯出以冒昧、這一種凝重穩健的治事能力就可以使人想見他的才能、所以、瑟武德的「斷橋殘夢」之有如此地成功、實然是他有冷靜的頭腦、敏鋭的眼光、沉着的精神廣博的識騐、</p>
<p>（四）主演者梅卡麗克</p>
<p>那兩位巨頭介紹了之後、第三位要輪到主演者梅卡麗克（MaeClark）女士了、梅女士也和華爾一樣並不是從大學出身、但以家學淵源、做電影演員就非常道地了、她的芳齡才過了二十歲、蛋臉别具一種芳姿、在葛烈達嘉寳、瑪琳戴德麗、瓊克勞馥、克萊拉寳等之外獨標一種風格、她是一位金黄頭髮的美人、水眸子的秋水一泓襯着兩道蛾眉、最是具着女性的魅力、一百十磅五尺來高的嬌軀活潑婀娜、娉婷剛健、股瑩肉膩、盡有了一切美人的美、而天資尤復敏慧、舉止更見可人、似這麽的蕙質蘭心、在表演上的優妙與自然益發使人見到她表演的天才特别地豐富了、她演影戲正如無孔不入的水銀、以她對於劇中人的深切認識亘非其他有明星頭銜的女演員所能望其項背、那便是她的偉大的地方、也就是好歷年研求所得與她的天才融會貫通的一點驚人的技術、她所演過的片子很爲不少、以盲目的導演不曾了解了她的艶質與驚才、故一向都是屈居人下、世無伯樂而儘多良馬、我不堪爲梅卡麗克起懐才莫遇之悲、然而像梅這樣的一個才貌雙絶的電影演員終有吐露光芒的一日、斷不致有長久的湮没無聞、</p>
<p>果然、她竟由隻眼獨具的華爾在羣芳萬艶中特自甄選出來充當「斷橋殘夢」的女主角了、唯英雄才能識英雄、華爾之謂、</p>
<p>梅的表演、純然以劇中人之心爲心、運用她的卓特的天才去表演劇中人某一種情緒、在「斷橋殘夢」裏、就給我們在塲面上見到的純然不是梅卡麗克而是梅拉、修養深者才有偉大的才能、昔日懐才不遇的梅、實所以使她有深厚的修養也、不然、專靠天才、斷没有今日那麽底成就、　　她自爲了「斷橋殘夢」的女玉演之後、以表演的空前、爲各方面所推許、寰球少主和她簽訂了一個五年的長期合同、做他的公司裏的基本明星、藉以實現他的强烈進展的影戲計劃、</p>
<p>（五）標題的解釋</p>
<p>關於「斷橋殘夢」的滑鐵盧橋的標題、誰也視爲奇特的、誠然、但一張片子的標題是每採取一個不平常而新奇的名字以爲標題的、即如採取不平凡的新頴的故事以爲劇中的故事一樣、這原因瑟武德所以用滑鐵盧橋四字來做他的劇本的標題就是證明他對於倫敦很爲認識了、而他的劇本之所以取是橋爲全劇的背景、也就以是橋的各階段的焦點都離不了、也就以是橋的各階段的焦點都離不了一個美字、而美的部分尤其是在西的盡頭、是片中從兩邊走到河的南岸的淡出、</p>
<p>據倫敦人自己的宣稱、十九都說滑鐵盧橋是最美的所在、又是倫敦與世界交通的要道、在歷史上並且是全泰晤士河最光榮最美麗之橋、意大利雕刻家喀諾華也曾加以無限的讚美、並且說由羅馬施行而去看這座莊嚴宏麗的模範的建築實是最有價値、</p>
<p>滑鐵盧橋在一八一一年十月開始建築、而落成於一八一七年七月十八日、担任工程者爲蘭尼（J.R.Rennie）、是一個有名的建築師、學識經騐都很豐富、曾經建築過幾座宏偉的橋樑、在建築滑鐵盧橋時、一切都由他負責擘劃、該橋在初原擬一三二六尺長、後以特殊的裝飾等種種便擴展至二四五六尺長、一四二尺寛闊、常行道爲七十尺闊、高度爲六百五十四尺、健築費爲英金一百萬鎊、最初定名呌做「濱橋」、因它是從南面貫通惠靈吞街與河濱的重要橋道、但在一八一六年、距它落成的前一年、就定名爲滑鐵盧橋了、蓋在一八一五年六月十八日英法大戰中滑鐵盧一役實是英軍特殊光榮的勝利、那一役的該得紀念就名它爲滑鐵盧橋。並且由皇太子親自行開幕典禮、　　影戲的故事的焦點就借着那在歷史上的光榮的滑鐵盧橋做背景、作者便採取那橋名做片的題目、於是那滑鐵盧橋不特傳之於史、如今竟名諸影戲、其普遍之廣更是非那可說的了、</p>
<p>（六）素描</p>
<p>是片之所以佳妙、我以爲在事實的叙述、旣頑艶凄馨、在情節的描繪、也瑰奇婉妙、而塲面的表現更見到精彩獨饒　　影戲、我常常地說、在它的題材無論是在兒女私情、或者是生活的一瞥、但總有一個中心意識、就是那藝術的異端、即如「斷橋殘夢」、背景雖然是在大戰時代的滑鐵盧橋、故事雖然是叙述大戰時倫敦社會的不景氣、然它的使命却正合着我們中國「天下興亡、匹夫有責、」的一句話去領導民衆武裝起來到前綫去、因爲到前綫去倫敦市况便漸見蕭條、因爲滑鐵盧橋之遭德國空軍的襲擊而生出這一段哀艶的事績、外國的丘九們、都是「戀愛不忘救國」的、所以、片中的男角就是的麽一個靑年、在前綫退到後方來、便於滑鐵盧橋碰見了那位凄艶無雙的少女、少女是一個淪落天涯的薄命人、從美國到倫敦、在舞台上鬻歌爲生、曾經顚倒了不少風流軍官、五陵年少、但以倫敦市的蕭索卒至成了墜溷飄苗、在滑鐵盧橋上做巫山神女的勾當、及至見了那位少年軍人、就一寸芳心、遽把萬丈情絲將他繫住了、然而在亂離時代、大好靑年是要去爲國犧牲的、而且階級攸分、高低不就、少女於是忍痛割愛了、謝絶了少年的萬種温存、揮慧劍、斬情絲、使他絶了念頭、再到前綫殺敵去、</p>
<p>然而少年呢、深熱情者其行必勇、故在假滿再回前綫之前、又跑到滑鐵盧上去找那少女、少女找到了、羞他、辱他、毆他、但他總是和前一樣地温存、一切的一切都加以諒解、是必要少女允許才到前綫去爲國犧牲、多情的女人有時是要抛棄私情而勗愛她的男人以大義的、少女便允許他而要他上前綫去了、不意一别竟成永訣、在滑鐵盧橋上揚巾送别之時、遽與滑鐵盧橋的一角同爲齎粉、</p>
<p>我們中國的靑年的男女們啊、我希望你們盾了這張影片而對於它的焦點有所認識、</p>

<p>Advocates maintaining the status quo in Jinzhou</p>
<p>Japan proposes border demarcation plan</p>
<p>British representative Cecil firmly opposes</p>
<p>Investigative team to consist of three members</p>
<p>Public meeting to be held within days</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council has decided to abandon the neutral zone plan. The Administrative Council had deliberated on this matter for many days, and this important decision was made at tonight's meeting. The Administrative Council also decided to recommend maintaining the status quo in Jinzhou. Chairman Briand will send a letter to the Japanese government proposing this, and will also express pleasure at the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Jinzhou area. This new turning point in the neutral zone issue came after Arita visited Briand this afternoon. Arita claimed to Briand that Japan's withdrawal of troops heading towards Jinzhou was already fulfilling the Japanese side's obligations in the Chinese proposal, but Chinese troops were still in Jinzhou, and asked that pressure be put on China to avoid conflict, and that the demarcation of the neutral zone should be directly negotiated by the authorities of China and Japan on the ground. Arita and Briand spoke for half an hour. In the evening, excluding the Chinese and Japanese representatives, the members of the Administrative Council met at 5:00 PM and adjourned at 6:45 PM. This one hour and forty-five minute meeting was the most important Administrative Council meeting in the past three weeks. Arita's proposal was thoroughly discussed and deemed unacceptable. Therefore, the Administrative Council decided to recognize the status quo and explore all possibilities for China and Japan to avoid conflict. As for the Japanese representative's proposal to make a unilateral declaration reserving Japan's right to suppress bandits, the Administrative Council considered it feasible, but the Administrative Council could not agree that others should not refute or criticize the Japanese representative's declaration, so this matter may be slightly stalled. The outside world's claim that the Japanese representative's declaration only mentioned the Japanese army's freedom of action without mentioning the word "bandits" is completely unfounded. The Administrative Council also agreed to delete the text of paragraph five of the draft resolution, which stipulates that "if the obligations of both parties under the September 30th proposal have not been fulfilled when the investigative team arrives in Manchuria, the investigative team must immediately report to the Administrative Council," and that the chairman should make a general statement on this point in his declaration. It is said that tonight the League of Nations side claimed that if Japan's proposal regarding Jinzhou is accepted, Jinzhou and the neutral zone between Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan will be under Japanese control. However, the Administrative Council has decided not to publish the details of the meeting, so this statement may not have any confirmed reports. When the Administrative Council adjourned at 6:45 PM, the Drafting Committee was still meeting, inviting Ito of the Japanese delegation to attend. Ito arrived at 7:00 PM and discussed with the Drafting Committee for one and a half hours. There is a noteworthy piece of news tonight, which states that the investigative team, originally set to have five members, has now been changed to six members, composed of representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States, and a small country in the north. This statement spread widely, but officials soon denied it, stating that there was no issue of changing the original plan of five people, but the officials have not yet stated which countries the other two countries are besides Britain, France, and the United States. The League of Nations has tentatively scheduled a public meeting of the Administrative Council for Wednesday, which may be the last meeting. (Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Arita's visit to Briand was quite important. When the Japanese representative visited Briand, everyone knew that serious problems had arisen in the organization of the neutral zone, and all discussions were extremely difficult. After the meeting, Briand submitted the Japanese opinions, especially those regarding the demarcation of the neutral zone, to the Twelve Committee. According to this agency, Japan</p>
<p>proposes that the neutral zone be bounded by the Great Wall on one side and by a small river seven kilometers west of Jinzhou on the other. Under these circumstances, Jinzhou seems to be included within the Japanese zone. British representative Cecil immediately objected to this interpretation, believing that "it is unacceptable and should be stated immediately, otherwise it may be too late in two days." Although Briand tried his best to explain Japan's attitude, considering it not unbreakable, the Administrative Council still agreed with Cecil's view and decided to reject Japan's request. Thereupon, Spanish representative Madariaga stood up and stated that the court's rejection should be formally notified to Foreign Minister Shidehara by the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Tokyo. The Drafting Committee then immediately convened a meeting to begin drafting. At the end of the twelve committee's closed meeting, the discussion concerned the actions that the chairman should take at the final public meeting, and the explanations that should be made regarding the resolution. This matter should be expressed as acceptable or unacceptable by the parties involved. At this time, Briand said that the above method might be presumptuous. Sir Cecil immediately replied, "Regardless of the impact, everything has been approved by this court." The most obvious result of this meeting is the actual abandonment of the neutral zone. The Administrative Council asked the parties involved to maintain the status quo and adhere to their original positions. (Havas dispatch from Paris on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the League of Nations Council members stated that the Council may eventually find a way to solve the difficulties of the Liaoning case and establish a basis for mediation. Therefore, the League of Nations Secretariat is now considering whether to convene a public meeting on Wednesday. It is reported that the Council is now using a quick and decisive method to remove extraneous matters, avoid the thorny issues of specifying troop withdrawal dates and the Japanese army's right to suppress bandits, and quickly pass a resolution and chairman's declaration to avoid further disputes and further complicating the case. The Council intends to allow Japanese representative Arita to explain the Japanese theory that the Japanese army has the right to suppress bandits at will during the public meeting, and then allow the council members to criticize it freely. Many parties now interpret this plan as a tacit warning to Japan not to adopt an overly aggressive attitude again. As for whether Jinzhou will remain in the neutral zone, the problem still awaits resolution. However, it is reported that the Council also believes that once the neutral investigative team arrives in Liaoning, the team will have the authority to deal with the objections arising from the troop withdrawal. As for the attitude of the Chinese and Japanese delegations, the spokesperson of the Chinese delegation today stated to reporters that if the Japanese statement reserving the right to suppress bandits could provide the Japanese with an excuse to re-engage in hostile acts, China would vigorously oppose it. Also, Ito of the Japanese delegation stated to reporters that the Japanese delegation is now awaiting instructions from the Tokyo government regarding the fact that the resolution does not involve suppressing bandits, and that Arita will make a supplementary statement reserving the Japanese army's freedom of action. We are still awaiting instructions from the government. As for the claim that China will have a similar resolution or reservation put forward, we have no knowledge of it. (National Telegram from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the League of Nations Council's discussion of the Jinzhou neutral zone, it is said that entanglements and misunderstandings have arisen due to the boundary issue. It is now planned to avoid specifying a formal neutral zone, and allow the Chinese and Japanese troops to remain in their current state until the investigative team arrives in Liaoning and then make arrangements. The twelve-nation council will hold a closed meeting at 5:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the status of Jinzhou. As for the number of members of the investigative team, it is reported that the twelve-nation council recently decided on a total of six members, one each from Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy, and the remaining one will be selected by the Secretariat from South America. (National Telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, our country's Chief Representative Shi stated his opinions to the League of Nations Council's Drafting Committee. The Drafting Committee then convened a meeting at 4:30 PM to discuss the Japanese request to move Section 5 of the draft resolution into the chairman's declaration. The reason for the Japanese request is said to be that the Japanese government believes that the wording of Section 5 is tantamount to implicitly setting a date for the Japanese army to withdraw troops. (National Telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The negotiations conducted by the League of Nations Administrative Council regarding the Manchurian dispute are now nearing completion. A public meeting may be held tomorrow to summarize the various achievements. If it cannot be held tomorrow, it should be held on Thursday. Briand's letter to Arita, which suggests maintaining the current situation in Jinzhou, is therefore a reply to a confidential document, so it will not be published. However, it is reported that Briand expressed his hope in this letter that Japanese troops would not cross the current line, and that both sides should refrain from provocative incidents, so that the neutral zone issue could be shelved and the responsibility for preventing war would fall on the local commanders. Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji met with the Drafting Committee this morning, and Ito of the Japanese delegation also met with the committee at 4:00 PM this afternoon.

<h3 id="e3">Northbound Train Robbed Again <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Four passenger cars robbed clean</p>
<p>Bandits clearly directed by Japanese army</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the Japanese army advanced westward from Xinmin on the 27th of last month, our army has retreated to Dahushan. Therefore, not only are there no Chinese troops east of Tangjiawopu, but there are also no road guards. Everything is under the control of the Japanese army. Recently, military attachés from various countries inspected the Xinmin area and proved that it was very peaceful east of Tangjiawopu and there were no bandits. However, on the morning of the 8th, train 102, which departed from Huangguatun, passed through Xinmin at 1:05 PM, not far from Liuhegou, and encountered bandits waving red flags. The driver did not want to stop, so the bandits fired at the locomotive. The bullet flew past the driver's head, so the army stopped. The bandits swarmed onto the train, robbing the first, second, and third class cars, and then left with a roar. One passenger was injured. Steere, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, witnessed the incident on the train. It is clear that the bandits were manipulated by the Japanese army to create chaos in Northeast China, hoping to win the right to suppress bandits at the League of Nations. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Express train 102, which departed from Shenyang, was robbed of four cars by bandits between Xinmin and Liuhe this afternoon. Passengers' belongings were robbed clean. A certain foreigner, the director of the Beining Transportation Bureau, was also robbed. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shortly after noon today, a passenger train from Shenyang to Tianjin was intercepted by bandits between Xinmin and Liuhekou (translation). The bandits first fired several shots to signal the train to stop. A bullet flew over the driver's head, so the driver stopped the train. A group of bandits swarmed onto the train and entered the first and second class cars to search for money and belongings. It is reported that no passengers were kidnapped, nor were any seriously injured. Only one Chinese first-class passenger was slightly beaten. Otherwise, there was no violence against individuals. Steere, the general manager of the Beining Railway, who had been working in Shenyang for three months, happened to be on the train and had his money, belongings, and overcoat stolen. It has been verified that there are no Chinese troops stationed along that section of the railway, nor are there any railway guards. However, a Japanese armored train patrols that section of the railway twice a day. Yet, the Japanese claim that they are not responsible for the safety of that section of the railway.

<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram, Li Yichun, along with the U.S. military attaché stationed in Japan and the French military attaché, inspected the Shuangyang River and Daling River areas. The U.S. military attaché inspected the Chinese army stationed in Jinzhou, and verified the number of personnel and artillery of the 12th Artillery Regiment and the 653rd Infantry Regiment, proving that the propaganda in Japan claiming that the 20th Brigade stationed in Jinzhou was opening up north of Xinmin was completely inaccurate. They arrived in Shanhaiguan this morning and visited He Zhuguo. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military authorities in Shenyang continue to claim that Chinese troops are carrying out provocative actions in the Jinzhou area, but foreign inspectors continue to report that they have not seen any signs of such actions by Chinese troops. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The U.S. counselor stationed in Japan inspected the 19th and 20th Brigade units stationed in Jinzhou on the 7th. Italian Consul General Dal Negro arrived in Jinzhou on the afternoon of the 7th to inspect. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain American reporter, instigated by the Japanese side, mixed into Jinzhou to spy on military intelligence. After being questioned by military police, only an old Russian license to travel between Harbin and Shenyang was found. There was no American passport, nor was there a license to send telegrams. He was obviously an imposter and was deported back to Shenyang on the 7th. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram, a certain foreign reporter in Shenyang telegrammed that the Japanese army has recently been secretly transporting troops westward along the Beining Railway from Shenyang, west of Xinmin, and secretly hiding guns in cotton bales. Today, there were Japanese planes flying to Goubangzi to reconnoiter. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9:00 AM on the 8th, the Japanese army used a passenger train to go from Huangguatun to Xinmin. A Japanese plane arrived at the Yingkou branch line at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th for low-altitude reconnaissance. The Japanese border was heavily guarded again on the 8th. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shanhaiguan telegram, it is said that Fei Yuan is in Yingkou, and this time the Japanese army is gathering in Hebei again, saying that it is to prevent bandits from running rampant. The rumor that the Japanese army is attacking Jinzhou is very prevalent. The defenses west of Dahushan are very strict. The Jin province government has decided to eliminate the bandit scourge to avoid being a tiger's accomplice. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese army field issued a message today, saying that Zhang Xueliang has formed two regiments of Mongolian cavalry, with the headquarters located in Kailu and Tongliao. (Reuters telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed to the various armies and brigades, saying that the bridges damaged on the Beining Railway have all been repaired, but the Japanese army is still inspecting passengers at Xinmin Juluhe. (Special dispatch from the 8th)</p>

<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry issues statement?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the League of Nations Council's decision to abandon the plan to establish a neutral zone in Jinzhou and the report advising to maintain the status quo in Jinzhou, the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities declared as follows:</p>
<p>The League of Nations Council's abandonment of the plan to establish a neutral area in Jinzhou is consistent with the Japanese government's policy of resolving the issue through direct negotiations between China and Japan. Therefore, the Japanese government has no objection only to the abandonment of the plan. As for the advice to maintain the status quo in the Jinzhou area, the Japanese government firmly opposes it because the result will perpetuate the current state of unrest in the Jinzhou area. The Japanese government is not only satisfied with the withdrawal of the Northeast Army from Jinzhou, but must also cancel and withdraw the Jinzhou government. Because if there is still a possibility that Zhang Xueliang's forces will return to Manchuria, it will be impossible to maintain the治安(zhì ān, public order/security) of Manchuria. The Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities intend to immediately send instructions to Arita, asking him to express the above-mentioned position, and at the same time, vigorously reject the advice to maintain the status quo in Jinzhou. (United Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese army's opinion on the League of Nations Council's decision to abandon the plan for a neutral zone in Jinzhou is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The issue of establishing a neutral zone in Jinzhou was not a proposal of the League of Nations Council, but was proposed to our country by China, Britain, and France. Therefore, there is no need for the League of Nations Council to abandon the neutral zone plan. As for the advice to maintain the status quo in the Jinzhou area, it is a particularly biased measure and is nothing more than China's attempt to preserve the Chinese army in Jinzhou for a long time. If this is the case, the security of the South Manchurian Railway line will be destroyed, so we absolutely oppose this advice. (United Press telegram from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There is no knowledge here of the rumor that the Japanese authorities have issued a statement claiming that the Chinese army should withdraw from Manchuria entirely. However, the Japanese authorities often reveal that if Zhang Xueliang wants to avoid a serious conflict, he must withdraw his troops into the Pass. The news circulating outside may refer to Commander Honjo's final warning to Zhang Xueliang two days ago. This matter was telegraphed by Reuters' Tokyo correspondent on Sunday.</p>
<p>In the Zhuang warning, Zhang Xueliang was asked to withdraw the troops from Jinzhou and east of Jinzhou, and said that Japan regarded the Chinese military and civilians gathering in Jinzhou as a serious act of provocation. At the same time, the Japanese government admitted that if Zhang Xueliang did not withdraw his troops on his own, the Japanese military authorities would decide to use force to compel him to do so, because if the root cause of the trouble is not eliminated, the situation will never be stable.

If Ma agrees to return to Heilongjiang, the method will be the same as those mentioned in the Domon letter. On the 7th, Zhang Jinghui forwarded this to Ma for negotiation. Ma replied immediately on the phone that he had no need to negotiate with the Japanese, and the Japanese should not come to Hailun, because the army and civilians were in high spirits, and he would not be responsible for any danger that might occur. Although he is currently in Hailun, his title as chairman still exists, so there is no need for the Japanese side to invite him back to Heilongjiang.

<p>(Washington) According to news from Paris, although there are optimistic signs from the League of Nations, all circles in Washington, D.C., both Chinese and Japanese, feel that the situation in Jinzhou is becoming increasingly serious, and both sides are likely to deteriorate rapidly and engage in war. Chinese sources claim that Zhang Xueliang, in order to seek compromise, is willing to withdraw the Northeast Army completely into the Pass, but if the Japanese army begins to attack, Zhang Xueliang will refuse to withdraw his troops to show that he will not be subdued by force.

<p>Russian newspaper's observation of France's attitude</p>
<p>Metal prices soar</p>
<p>Clearly a result of war preparations</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Russian newspaper Pravda cited the financial and economic situation report of the Paris financial community as follows:</p>
<p>It proves the Soviet Russian claim that Japan and other imperialists are preparing for a Far East war. It is said that the French newspaper reported that the recent rise in various prices on the Paris Stock Exchange, especially metal prices, is the result of Japan and another major country preparing for war. Therefore, we can say with certainty that the war in the three eastern provinces, or the expansion of the Japanese-occupied areas, can greatly help to increase prices and sell off excess raw materials in European and American warehouses, etc. This shows that the imperialists are currently preparing for a new war, hoping to extricate themselves from the current economic predicament. This incident in the three eastern provinces is only the prelude to a new war. Moreover, the French newspaper's report clearly shows that the French newspaper is the best propaganda machine for the Japanese General Staff, just as France has always been the best ally of Japanese imperialism. Today, French newspapers and French industrialists are hoping to supply Japan with military supplies and all the items needed to consolidate its power in Manchuria in order to make huge profits. For example, the railway that Japan is planning to build will require 80,000 tons of steel, not including vehicles. This kind of huge order has been extremely difficult to obtain in the past. This is also one of the reasons why the French are doing their best to support the Japanese. (National Telegram from the 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Resignation of National University Presidents <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Due to the increasingly severe diplomatic situation, domestic tensions have been extremely high in recent days. Students across the country are petitioning and demonstrating, and now university presidents from various regions are resigning en masse. At this most critical time, the university presidents, who bear the heavy responsibility of guiding young people, are all resigning together. What is their intention? We truly do not understand.</p>
<p>What exactly are the reasons and intentions behind their resignations? Do they claim to be inadequate in their teaching and lack the talent to shoulder this heavy responsibility? If so, they should not have accepted the appointment in the first place. Knowing the difficulty, they should have retreated. Resigning should not have been delayed until today. If they claim that today's student petitions and demonstrations are out of line, that they are arrogant, unteachable, and insufficient in themselves, then speaking of feelings and reason, the students are sacrificing their studies in helplessness, crying out to heaven to save the country. We only feel that their actions are admirable, their hearts are very pained, and their deeds are most lamentable. We do not feel they are hateful or fearful at all. These lovable young people are the future pillars of our country. Teachers, who bear the responsibility of guidance, should properly encourage and guide them onto the path of effective struggle. How can they withdraw and retreat? Taking a step back, even if we acknowledge that today's students' actions are arrogant and restless, tracing back to the root cause, what kind of education have schools been providing on a daily basis? How can university presidents shirk their responsibility? It is wrong to start and then blame the end. Today, instead of blaming the students, why not reflect on oneself? Instead of passively resigning, why not adopt a proactive spirit and take on more concrete responsibility to redeem oneself? Do they claim that the situation is difficult and handling affairs is thorny? At this time of national crisis, it is precisely when every citizen should rise up and share the national burden. Currently, we only have struggle, we only have everyone fulfilling their responsibilities, everyone doing their best, holding the determination to sacrifice, seeking one chance of survival out of ten deaths. During these difficult times for the nation, it is certainly not the time for us to preserve our purity and withdraw from the world, especially for university presidents who bear the responsibility of leading society and guiding young people, to resign en masse at this time. Therefore, the widespread resignations of national university presidents today are not only intolerable to public opinion but also unpermitted by the times.</p>
<p>We believe that due to the severe stimulus of domestic and foreign troubles, the students and young people, who have been languishing for a long time, have shown a slight turnaround, a slight hint of vitality. We believe that this period is a reenactment of the May Fourth Movement, an advancement of history and culture. This is not an overstatement. Educators should seize this opportunity and take the lead. If they feel that students are hateful and fearful as soon as they take action, then they only wish for students to remain under mechanical education, quiet and reserved, with their eyes not looking sideways and their ears not listening, burying their heads in reading dead books. Is this kind of education what is needed today? Is it what should be available today? With a little thought, we can immediately tell the difference. Therefore, what is the reason for the collective resignations of national university presidents today? To whom do they ultimately belong? With national disaster at hand, the primary task of the people today is to fulfill their responsibilities. General Ma Zhanshan, with an isolated army in a remote area, with exhausted supplies and no reinforcements, defended the territory and protected the people, never abandoning his responsibility. He fiercely resisted the brutal army, persevering repeatedly. This spirit is what the people of the country should emulate today. We respectfully offer sincere advice to educators across the country. When the country is in danger, people should fulfill their responsibilities. Fulfilling one's responsibilities is saving the country, and it is fulfilling the duty of a citizen. If everyone shirks their responsibilities, to whom will the responsibility be handed over? Maintaining one's purity and proclaiming one's superiority is not the time now. If every principal of universities, middle schools, and even elementary schools across the country resigns and withdraws, then the only option for domestic education will be to declare a complete halt. How can this be? How can this be possible?</p>
<p>Foreign Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3 id="e17">Ma Zhanshan Telegraphs to Aid-Heilongjiang Youth <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan telegraphs from Hailun: To party headquarters of various provinces and cities, governments of various provinces and cities, all schools, all legal entities, all newspapers: According to reports, youth from various provinces and cities are voluntarily going to the Northeast to organize aid-Ma Zhanshan anti-Japanese groups. What virtue or ability do I, Zhanshan, possess to receive such great love? Reflecting on my heart, I am filled with gratitude and shame. I believe that spinning and weaving, tilling the land, each has its own responsibility. Opening the way for those who come after, carrying on the past, mutually complementing each other, this is how things become clear. Charging into battle is the responsibility of soldiers. Forcing civilians to fight would only be a useless sacrifice, failing to hurt the enemy in the slightest. Our respectable and lovable youth are whom I, Zhanshan, greatly admire. However, to have them defend against the enemy's front is against my conscience. I absolutely cannot bear to do this. The youth have unlimited futures. In the future, there will surely be many who become pillars of the nation. They must accumulate knowledge and refine their conduct, striving for great achievements. Then they can spread our national prestige, avenge our grievances, and wipe away our shame. The heavy responsibility lies entirely on you. If you act before the time is right, carrying out the act of "cooking cranes and boiling zithers," it would not only be uneconomical for talent but would also greatly undermine the foundation of the country. Moreover, Longsha is at the far north, and it is now the harsh winter. The cold is severe. What is described as "falling fingers and cracked skin" is not even one-hundredth of what it is like. Even people who grew up in this land find it hard to bear. How can you, who are used to a mild climate, endure it? Furthermore, from Guan to the north, it is two to three thousand li to enter Jiang territory. The railways in between cannot be used at the moment. In this area where the snow covers the ankles, how can you manage to travel? I, Zhanshan, dare not but commend your ambitions. If you want to put them into practice, I believe it is absolutely impossible. I dare to convey this sincerely. Please examine and cancel this organization. I cannot express my anticipation enough.

<h3 id="e18">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announces the Progress of the Gu-Shigemitsu Talks <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Refuting Shigemitsu's Remarks to the Press</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shigemitsu, the Japanese ambassador to China, spoke with reporters in Shanghai on the 7th. Regarding the Jinzhou issue, he slandered China for breaking its promise, confusing the public. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the facts, refutes it severely as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing was very surprised to see that Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Kui spoke with reporters before leaving Beijing. This is because several important points in Shigemitsu's remarks are completely inconsistent with the facts. The Japanese ambassador's claim that the Jinzhou Liaoning provincial government instigated bandits and plainclothes teams to harm the Japanese army and carried out various conspiracies is absolutely untrue. According to investigations, Chinese officials in Jinzhou have consistently worked hard to prevent the situation from escalating. Neutral observers have repeatedly reported and confirmed this. These observers who uphold public opinion are still in Jinzhou. This shows that not only is the Japanese ambassador's claim baseless, but the facts are also the opposite. This is because the world knows that the invading forces in the East Province are the Japanese army. Just ten days ago, the Japanese army was still advancing in Jinzhou, attempting to occupy the seat of our provincial government. Regarding the so-called Jinzhou neutral zone issue, Foreign Minister Gu never made any proposal to the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, and France as claimed by the Japanese ambassador. Foreign Minister Gu met with the Japanese ambassador twice, on November 29 and December 3, and clearly stated to the Japanese ambassador that the Chinese side had not made any proposals. Shigemitsu also fully understood this truth. Now that Shigemitsu has made a statement, our side must also restate the truth of the matter to draw attention. Gu met with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France on the evening of November 24. During the meeting, they discussed the urgent situation of the Japanese army continuing to press toward Jinzhou and the urgent need to find a way to prevent the Chinese and Japanese armies from clashing near Jinzhou. At that time, there was talk of both sides withdrawing troops. The key point was to have Japan guarantee to the three countries that it would not advance into the Jinzhou area. All administration in the area would still be under Chinese control, and Chinese police would continue to perform their duties. Furthermore, this guarantee had to be satisfactory to the three countries. The term "neutral zone" was never mentioned. Moreover, Minister Gu explained during the talks that Gu's intention in meeting with the three ambassadors was to ask them to inquire about the opinions of their respective governments. Later, all three countries were unwilling to guarantee China, and Japan insisted on occupying Jinzhou. Therefore, the Chinese side did not make any proposals. This fact is not only clear to the Chinese side but is also known in the League of Nations in Paris. When Foreign Minister Gu met with the Japanese ambassador twice at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he explained this fact in detail. After Foreign Minister Gu's explanation, the Japanese ambassador claimed to have understood the truth of the matter. The crux of the matter was the guarantee from the three countries. Since this guarantee was difficult to realize, the matter was never a problem. As for how this matter was presented to Japanese Prime Minister Shidehara, the Chinese side knew nothing and did not agree. Since our country made no proposal, how could the submission to Shidehara by the former French ambassador to Tokyo be listed as a proposal from our country? If Japan believes that China had made a suggestion for both sides to withdraw troops and had taken steps to withdraw troops, then the Japanese side cannot avoid being mistaken. Only Japan can be held responsible for this misunderstanding. According to the League of Nations resolution of September 30, Japan solemnly declared that it would withdraw its troops to within the South Manchuria Railway area. If Japan sincerely wants to avoid escalating the situation, then Japan should not renege on its withdrawal of troops near Jinzhou this time. This withdrawal of troops by Japan is only a demonstration of its obligation to withdraw troops, which it has repeatedly committed to the League of Nations Council. If Japan wants to use the withdrawal of troops as a bargaining chip to demand that our country withdraw the remaining troops in the East Province, then our country would be completely puzzled.

<h3 id="e19">National Government Issues Letter to Students Nationwide <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued a letter to students nationwide on the 8th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The nation is in a critical situation of survival. Only by uniting the entire country, uniting all people, and being sincere can we overcome this crisis. The government, upholding this sincerity, has received petitioners without fail, putting aside other matters and treating them sincerely. The government has nothing to hide, and the petitioners have expressed trust in the government's sincerity. However, in recent days, young students have been misled by enemy propaganda, becoming more and more intense, and their actions have become excessive. The so-called "Jinzhou neutral zone" and the so-called "direct Sino-Japanese negotiations" and the so-called "joint administration of Tianjin" are not only things the government has never advocated, but it has also clearly stated that all diplomatic points that the government has instructed Representative Shi to present to the League of Nations have been made public as much as possible and published in various newspapers. However, traitors and reactionaries have picked up enemy propaganda and blinded the patriotic youth. Our beloved youth, driven by emotions and negligent in their judgment, have been deceived. They have even used enemy propaganda as a basis to question the government's responsible statements. This kind of change is truly heartbreaking. Even if this were not the case, inquiries by letter or telegram would certainly be answered. Now, they are abandoning their studies and enduring hunger and cold to embark on this journey. The enemy must be laughing and secretly gloating. Our youth have already been deceived by them. The reactionaries' techniques of intimidation and coercion will surely increase day by day, using the youth as their tools, even sacrificing the youth without hesitation. They will drive the youth to disrupt social order, military preparations, and transportation organs during this time of national crisis, making it impossible for the government to exercise its functions, further allowing enemy countries and communists to profit and seize opportunities. Ultimately, the country will perish, and the patriotic youth will regret it too late. Alas, is this not a great tragedy? Is this not something that the youth did not expect and will surely happen? Now, we solemnly declare that the government has never advocated the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou, direct negotiations, or joint administration of Tianjin. Traitors and reactionaries have picked up rumors to drive the youth, as mentioned above. Let us cite the recent actions of the students, such as destroying stations, beating station masters, tying up bureau members, arresting police and soldiers, beating school teachers, expelling principals, detaining classmates, and even publicly distributing reactionary leaflets denouncing the Three Principles of the People and the National Government, and shouting communist slogans. All these are commonly seen facts. If this continues, society will be shaken, the country will fall into a state of anarchy, and it will not only be impossible to resist foreign aggression but also impossible to maintain domestic order. Not only will education fail, but the country will perish soon. Our patriotic youth should think about whether the youth who disrupt order and hinder transportation during this time of national crisis are truly able to save the country, and whether the youth who destroy discipline and violate laws during this time of national crisis are truly able to love the country. Disrupting domestic order to expose the weakness of one's country is a crime against the country. Violating national laws and giving traitors and reactionaries an opportunity to take advantage of is also a crime against the country. The enemy is watching intently. Once they see the unrest in our country, the lack of mutual trust throughout the country, the lack of unity between superiors and subordinates, and the government's inability to control the situation, they will surely strike directly. At this moment of life and death, how can the government bear to remain silent? How can it not announce this? With the country in such danger, the government can only exercise its power and fulfill its responsibility to protect the law, maintain order, and stabilize the situation. Those who act out of line and seize the opportunity to rebel will isolate themselves from the people. For the sake of revolutionary discipline and the survival of the nation, the government will never condone evil and harm the country. It sincerely hopes that our patriotic youth will strictly abide by discipline, jointly resist foreign aggression, and achieve the goal of saving the country. It has high expectations for this.

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang issued a letter to students of all schools in Beiping, saying, according to investigations by the security authorities and reports from students, I know that your factions are diverse and extremely complicated. Evil people will take advantage of this, and the enemy wants to use it as an excuse. Therefore, although you are acting out of patriotic enthusiasm, the result is the opposite. Therefore, when we love the country, our hearts must be hot, and our heads must be cold. What I, Xueliang, dare to assert with confidence is, first, I will not surrender, and I will not betray the country; second, I am not greedy for life, and I am not afraid of death. I hope you will also realize that putting up slogans, distributing leaflets, shouting "Down with," shouting "Cancel," petitioning and marching, giving lectures and demonstrations cannot save the country. The way to save the country is to work hard and do practical things. Now, I make two agreements with you: (1) Those of you who have studied diplomacy and international issues, please study as much as possible the treaty relations between China and Japan and the ways to resolve them, and send detailed opinions to the Northeast Diplomatic Research Committee for reference. (2) Those of you who are willing to join the army, please register first and wait for enlistment training. (Eighth, special telegram)</p>

<p>"Youth Without Freedom Cannot Become Adults"</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian has recently been deeply saddened by the fact that students in various regions are coming to Nanjing to petition out of patriotic enthusiasm, and that some of them do not understand the fundamental methods of saving the country, and have said and acted excessively and radically. Therefore, he personally wrote the following words to educators and parents of students nationwide: "To cultivate a sapling, so that it grows into a tall and upright tree, requires several large pieces of wood to support it from all sides. To cultivate a good youth, requires sacrificing several adults to support him from all sides. A sapling without freedom cannot grow. A youth without freedom cannot become an adult. Educators across the country, wake up! Parents, brothers, and sisters of students across the country, wake up! To save the country, we must first save the youth, who are the lifeblood of the nation. To save the country, we must first save the schools that guide the youth. December 7th, Republic of China Year 20, Dai Chuanxian." (Eighth, special telegram)</p>

The original letter said: "We have just heard that Central News Agency reporter Gong Xizhi was seriously injured after being beaten by students of your school while interviewing news. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, our colleagues in the capital's press, due to their duties, have done their best to seek effective progress together. We are particularly happy to publicize your school's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, so that young people across the country know where to follow. Gong has been one of the colleagues who has worked hard in this movement in the past. Now, he has been insulted by the students of your school who are working hard to resist Japan and save the country. After hearing the news, our colleagues cannot help but regret it. As for the records of the Central News Agency and the past feelings of your school's students, this is another matter. Gong is only an employee of the agency and is not responsible. We and Gong are both colleagues, and we have always cared extremely for your school's students. Now that this unfortunate event has occurred, we cannot help but feel deeply sorry for the future friendship between our capital's press and your school's students. What is the reason for Gong's beating? Please let us know so that we can give this issue a strict consideration. We cannot express our expectations enough. (Eighth, special telegram)</p>

<p>Hunger Marchers Petition</p>
<p>Washington, 7th (National Telegram): The 72nd US Congress held its first session at noon today. The Democratic Party fully controlled the House of Representatives, while Republican President Hoover led the administration. Democratic Congressman Garner was elected Speaker, while Republican candidate for Speaker Snell was defeated by a few votes and retreated to become the Republican floor leader. The Speaker is now a Democrat, and all the committees are under the control of the Democratic Party, a phenomenon not seen for many years. In the Senate, the Republicans still have a one or two-vote advantage, but if the Democrats can gain the support of independent Republicans, they may be able to control the floor. The Speaker is Vice President Curtis, a Republican stalwart. President Hoover will present an administrative report for the year tomorrow and will later present a special report on foreign relations. Both cases are the focus of attention at this time. The Democratic Party, with the presidential election to be held next year, is very active in Congress. Its leaders have also warned members to act with extreme caution to avoid harming their chances of being elected next year. With the presidential election campaign only five months away, both parties' legislative plans must be carefully considered, and all battle strategies are aimed at the presidential election next year.</p>
<p>Washington, 7th (National Telegram): Today, on the opening day of the US Congress, thousands of unemployed people from various places gathered, organized hunger marchers, marched into Washington D.C., and marched through the streets to the Capitol to petition for relief. Initially, they wanted to enter the Capitol en masse, but were dissuaded by the guards and instead sent ten people to the Congress to state their plight. The marchers shouted "Down with Hoover" outside the Capitol. The police did not interfere, but the overall order was maintained.</p>
<h3 id="e54">British Government Closely Monitors the Indian Situation <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>London, 7th (Reuters): Indian Affairs Minister Hoare stated in the House of Commons today that the government is closely monitoring the situation in India. This makes the rumors that India's non-violent resistance will erupt again all the more credible. A Member of Parliament asked the government to pay attention to the resolution of the All India National Congress in Bengal to boycott British goods. Hoare replied that the government was prepared to deal with any new developments effectively and has instructed the Indian government to prepare a report before the Christmas recess. Conservative Party member Hacking asked whether the actions of the All India Congress in Bengal would undermine the agreement reached between Irwin and Gandhi and asked whether the British government was aware of the importance of Lancashire merchants being certain that their goods would not be boycotted before exporting cotton goods. Hoare agreed with Hacking and promised to publish all available information. The British newspapers attach great importance to the Bengal Congress resolution. They view Gandhi's comments, which contained intimidation, when he left the UK, the lack of concrete agreements at the Round Table Conference, and the current developments in Bengal as evidence of the seriousness of the situation. Gandhi is currently in India and may take action after his return. If the Bengal resolution is implemented, Lancashire will suffer a major blow, as the All India Congress is calling for a boycott of British goods, especially British cloth.</p>

<p>Zhu Jiahua's announcement to the parents of students of Zhongshan University, relayed by Shenbao to the parents of students of National Central University: Since the East Province Incident occurred, the students of our school have occasionally abandoned their studies and rushed about calling for action. Jiahua believes that their aspirations to love the country are commendable, but sincerely believes that the way to save the country is to focus on fundamentals. Young people in school, at this time of national crisis, should be even more determined and hardworking to strengthen the basic forces for saving the country. I have repeatedly and earnestly warned them, to the point of exhaustion. Recently, they have disregarded the school's advice, and the situation has become even more tense. They have been manipulated by a few people, going on strike, holding meetings, and demonstrating, turning to attack the government, and often taking excessive actions. They have also gone to other schools to incite strikes and try to expand the movement. Within the school, they have insulted teachers and even destroyed doors and windows and beaten Professor and Secretary-General Guo, causing serious injuries and bleeding. Later, at gatherings, students were often beaten or detained, as if they were being interrogated like prisoners. School discipline has deteriorated to this point, which is truly heartbreaking. Jiahua, as the president of the school, is lacking in virtue and ability. I have failed to guide and lead them in the beginning, and I have failed to correct and remedy them later. My management has been flawed, and I cannot escape blame. I have already submitted a request to the Ministry of Education, which has been forwarded to the National Government, to resign from my position and await punishment. The matter has now escalated, shifting from external to internal, and if it is not enough internally, it is used against the school. The students are so uneasy that their actions are all abnormal. They have already voluntarily gone on indefinite strike, and the school's responsibility for teaching is impossible to fulfill. Jiahua loves the students like his own children, but today I feel helpless. I sincerely fear that if this continues, the situation will become even more unmanageable. For the safety of the students and to prevent the parents from worrying, I am sending this telegram. I hope that you, the parents, will temporarily call them back to change their environment, which will be more beneficial. I hope you will understand and forgive. Zhu Jiahua bows respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e60">County Magistrate Wei Discusses the Fall of Xinmin <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Jinzhou Dispatch: After the fall of the Northeast, the Liaoning Provincial Government moved to Jinzhou, governing only thirteen counties. Xinmin was the easternmost, and Japanese troops were pressing its borders. Although they hadn't overtly resorted to violent methods, it was essentially a divide between China and Japan. It was clear that the situation was precarious. However, it managed to survive for over two months, partly because the Japanese forces lacked the strength to advance westward at the time, and partly due to the effective response of the county magistrate. However, the eventual fall was undoubtedly due to the Japanese military's deliberate expansion of its occupied territory. When the county magistrate of that county, Wei, was at a moment of existential crisis, his response was firm but respectful. Even though he was temporarily under Japanese surveillance, he managed to escape from danger with the county seal, preventing the Japanese army from carrying out any schemes to falsely claim popular support. Among the officials in the Northeast, how many could fulfill their duty to protect the land like Wei? Yesterday, I visited Mr. Wei at his lodging in Jinzhou, and he described the events before and after the fall of Xinmin in great detail. I record it as follows: "Since the September 18th Incident, the arrogance of the Japanese army and its puppets has been truly lamentable. Xinmin is a small town, and local officials shouldn't make reckless statements. However, every citizen is responsible for the fate of the country. As a member of the Northeastern people, I have also offered suggestions to our leaders. I have always known that the Japanese army has ambitious plans for further expansion. After Longjiang was lost, the Japanese army gradually advanced westward. At the time, the commander of the Japanese garrison from Julu River to Xinmin was first Umeno, then changed to Takehisa, and finally Zhongshan. Their intention to occupy Xinmin was clear. Initially, they tried to lure us with benefits, and then they threatened us. I remember when the Northeast Local Maintenance Association was established, a Japanese reporter from Dalian visited me. He first asked about my position, meaning what attitude I would take towards the Central Government and the current Northeast. I said that I am an official appointed by the Central Government and only know to obey the Central Government. He then asked if I had any relationship with Yuan Jinkai and others from the Maintenance Association, and what my future intentions were. I said that the Maintenance Association is an illegal organization, and I have private friendships with Yuan and others, but they have nothing to do with official duties. The Japanese reporter then went a step further, saying, 'What would you do if Yuan and others gave you an order?' I said that since it is an illegal organization, I would certainly not accept any orders. I cannot change my position because of personal friendships. The Japanese reporter, unable to get what he wanted, then said that Zhang Xueliang and others are imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, and the people of the Northeast all want to get rid of him. What do you think? I said that Zhang is my superior, and the right to stay or go rests with the Central Government. There is no need to answer this. Then, he asked what I thought about the relationship between China and Japan. I said that this is not something I should comment on. The affairs of the country are the responsibility of others. My duty is only to maintain local peace and stability and carry out administrative affairs. Finally, he asked if I could maintain the security of this area, and whether I was afraid that the bandits here would be unfavorable to me, and whether it would be better to ask the Japanese army to protect me. I said that my presence here is precisely to protect the local area and foreigners, and I believe I still have this ability. The reporter left disappointed. In my opinion, he must have been a Japanese spy, used to probe the intentions of our officials and people. Later, the Japanese consul also occasionally revealed intentions of enticement, but I was never moved. Soon, the Japanese army benefited from places like Longjiang and actively advanced westward. At the same time, Xinmin itself had Japanese troops, and our troops were also stationed in the Jindong area. Historically, there have been many bandits outside the Guan, and due to the confrontation between the two armies, bandits gathered in the county, and the county of hundreds of miles accumulated 5,000 bandits, while the Xinmin County Government only had more than 200 public security team members. Thanks to my many efforts, it was not ravaged. Later, the Japanese army, through Ronin, recruited four bandit groups: Binzi, Lezi, Dingzi, and Beihai, and gathered them around Jixiangbao, intending to take action. Residents reported this, saying that the bandits were wearing white armbands, with the words 'National Self-Defense Army' printed on them, and a five-color red star in the middle, clearly no different from the Japanese flag. After hearing this, I immediately visited the Japanese consul and protested. The Japanese consul strongly denied it. By the 19th, rumors spread that the pacified bandits were about to attack the city. Merchants panicked and came to the office to persuade me to abandon the city. I solemnly declared that if the Japanese army attacked the city, I would definitely leave, because the Central Government had long ordered not to take hostile actions against the Japanese army. However, if bandits harass, I, as the head of a county, cannot leave my post without authorization and must maintain it to the end. On the evening of the 20th, the situation became even more tense. At 2:00 AM, I and my colleagues in the county office were taking turns on duty when we received a report that a guard at the gate near the county office discovered a group of people placing two heavy objects on the ground and secretly lighting them. The guard shot at them, but missed. Upon closer inspection, they were rice straws coated with lard, one end lit and the other end attached to two bombs. It was certain that the form and source of the straws must be Korean. At that time, they were burning very quickly, and the guards hurriedly retreated. Residents, upon hearing the news, did not dare to approach. Knowing that there would be a major event that night, I immediately telegraphed the city's public security bureau to tighten defenses. Soon, gunshots were heard at the east gate, and the bandits launched a large-scale attack on the city. At the same time, the burning straw, blown by the wind, separated from the bombs, fortunately without exploding. It was then carried into the office. On one hand, the police tried their best to resist the bandits. At dawn, the bandits were repelled. I then went to the Japanese consulate, and found that there were also two similar bombs in the consulate's courtyard. There was no doubt that they had been placed by the Japanese themselves. When the Japanese consul met me, he pretended to be surprised, saying he didn't know where these two strange things came from. I told him that similar things had been found near the county office, and that their form was definitely not something that could be found in Xinmin. Then, I solemnly warned the Japanese consul, saying that if your country wants to occupy Xinmin, I can only retreat, because I have repeatedly received orders not to take hostile actions against your army. Your army's use of bandits seems too clumsy, and it is an overreaction. Occupying Xinmin does not require such measures. At that time, the Japanese consul still tried to argue. At 6:00 AM that day, he even accompanied me to inspect various places. As a result, it was discovered that three places in the city had been bombed, two houses had been burned, and a large basket of bullet casings had been collected. Fortunately, the attack locations had not hit any important points. The Japanese consul's attitude seemed to regret that his Japanese bullets had been wasted on empty targets, as if this action had not achieved its intended goal. At 10:00 AM, Commander Zhongshan came to Xinmin again and met me with a artillery captain. He immediately began to speak wildly, reaching the extreme of rudeness, saying that he could not guarantee the safety of the Japanese consul, and that someone had secretly placed a bomb in the consulate, for which I must take full responsibility. I told him that this object was not only not from Xinmin, but also unknown to the people of Xinmin, and that since the September 18th Incident, I had forbidden people from passing near the consulate, and the consulate itself was heavily guarded, so how could the bomb have entered? Although the commander had no words to answer, he still babbled on incessantly. Afterwards, the translator told me that he was actually cursing me, hating that I didn't understand Japanese, and that the interpreter was afraid that I would clash with the Japanese, so he didn't tell me the truth at the time, otherwise I would never have allowed him to be so rude. After they left, the Japanese army intermittently shelled westward from Julu River. Also, before the bandits took action, there would always be Japanese artillery fire, so there was no doubt that there was an agreement between them. On the afternoon of the 21st, at 4:00 PM, the bandits launched another attack, which was also repelled. On the 22nd, I learned that the bandits had gathered at Gaotaizi. I notified the Japanese consul, saying that I would send people to suppress the bandits there, but that area was very close to your army's defense line, and I was afraid of causing misunderstandings, so I came to inform you. The Japanese consul initially had no objection. I then dispatched 120 cavalrymen from the self-defense corps, led by Wang Xiaozhong, to that area. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army opened fire, killing or wounding more than 30 people from our side on the spot. On the evening of the 24th, the Japanese side then sent troops themselves. After entering the city, a Japanese man, together with bandit leader Jin Zehui, led the so-called self-defense army straight to the county office. I happened to be coming from outside and planned to temporarily take refuge in a nearby store, but I was suddenly spotted by several directors of the county chamber of commerce, who pleaded with me to go to the chamber of commerce, saying that the Japanese were looking for the county magistrate to discuss post-settlement measures. Reluctantly, I went with them to the chamber of commerce. The Japanese then proposed two conditions: first, I had to sign a statement declaring that I would be subject to the control of the puppet government of Shenyang; second, I had to issue a document proving that I welcomed the Japanese army. In his words, he also presented a proclamation by Honjo, which had been drafted in advance, the general idea of which was that 'this army has come at the request of all sectors of Xinmin,' etc. These documents were forced upon me and the president of the chamber of commerce to co-sign. The people of the chamber of commerce all spoke for the sake of the safety of Xinmin, asking me to sign. I then told them that it was my responsibility to maintain the ground, and if I could no longer maintain it, then I could only allow the Japanese army to do what they wanted, but I am a national official, and you should persuade me to love my country, not to tempt me to betray my country. I would swear to deny the signing. Seeing that my will was unyielding, the local people made a temporary maintenance association stamp, posted a proclamation to pacify the people. I was detained in the Japanese consulate until 3:00 AM before being released, but they then sent four military police and one soldier to secretly monitor me. I pretended to be ill and stayed at the Xinhuo Inn near the county office, while the Japanese soldiers guarded outside. From the 24th to the 25th, on the 26th, a phone call came from Shenyang, saying that an appointment would be sent. I responded casually. When a conflict occurred in the front, the Japanese army rushed to the front line, and I was able to take the opportunity to escape. I also secretly brought the seal to avoid the creation of false evidence to confuse international opinion. I then took a horse from Mincun, passed through Niujia Wopeng, and boarded a train at Xinli Town to Jinzhou. However, because I had not ridden a horse for many years and had not been able to rest, I felt very tired. After arriving in Jinzhou, I visited the Chief of Staff and received great comfort, which made me feel even more ashamed. The current situation in that area is not yet fully clear, but I have one very important statement to make, which is that the Japanese army is forcibly distorting public opinion with all kinds of false evidence, proclaiming to the world that wherever the Japanese army goes, they are welcomed by the Chinese. If foreigners do not understand the truth, they will inevitably reverse right and wrong. If the Japanese treat Xinmin like this, who knows if they will treat other counties in Liaodong the same way? The impact of this is very great. This point must be made clear to the world, otherwise it will be very detrimental to our side."</p>

<p>Kwantung Army Headquarters to Permanently Station in Shenyang; South Manchuria Railway Company Also to Move from Dalian to Shenyang. The World News Agency reports, citing Japanese sources, that since the Manchurian Incident, all important Japanese agencies in Manchuria have actually moved to Shenyang. It is now heard that the South Manchuria Railway Company will also move from Dalian to Shenyang soon. This issue has been decided after discussions between the South Manchuria Railway Company President Uchida and other key members with relevant authorities. The location for setting up the agency has already been selected, and negotiations for purchasing the land have begun. It is also rumored that the Kwantung Army Headquarters has tentatively decided to permanently station in Shenyang, and the transfer of its various teams and agencies is being planned. Currently, the management of the South Manchuria Railway area is distributed among the Kwantung Army, the Kwantung Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. Now, it is planned to give all authority to the President of the South Manchuria Railway Company to achieve unification. It is expected that Shenyang will soon become the center of Japanese administrative and other activities.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Fuzhou Electric Company Refuses Inspection, Sparking Anti-Japanese Tide <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Inciting Workers to Beat Up Anti-Japanese Association Members</p>
<p>All Sectors Halt Business, Demanding Government Punishment</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Disciplinary Committee of the Anti-Japanese Association of all circles in the provincial capital, because the Fuzhou Electric Company (organized by the Liu brothers, including the directors and managers of the Electric Company), used the Liu Zhengji's (i.e. organized by the Liu family brothers who are the directors and managers of the Electric Company) Xin Jian and Xin Sheng ships to travel back and forth between Taiwan and Dalian, purchasing and transporting large quantities of coal, foreign cement, raw oil, and various electrical materials to Fujian for sale, repeatedly warned them without effect, and resolved to punish the company with 30,000 yuan and confiscate all the goods. At 2:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, Anti-Japanese Association member Chen Xuehua and Disciplinary Committee member Lin Pingzhou led more than 20 inspectors, taking a public bus to the Xinguang Electric Company to seal up the items. The company's secretary, Lin Xianmin, met them and led them into the upstairs living room. While they were negotiating, more than 100 workers suddenly gathered downstairs, making a lot of noise, saying that the Anti-Japanese Association members should leave immediately, or they would be beaten to death. As the members were about to persuade them, the workers suddenly rushed up and started hitting them, and the entire group was trapped in the living room. The driver of the car waiting outside the door saw the situation was not good and quickly drove to the Anti-Japanese Association to report. The Anti-Japanese Association then reported to the Provincial and County Party Headquarters. The Provincial Party Headquarters sent Director Liu Chengqing, and the County Party Headquarters sent member Cheng Jiakai, along with the Martial Law Headquarters' Inspection Team and the City Public Security Bureau's Detective Team to the scene. They first dispersed the workers, then released the Anti-Japanese Association members, and asked the company's secretary, Lin Xianmin, why they had beaten up the Anti-Japanese Association members. Lin claimed that the workers had acted on their own and had nothing to do with the company, and that the company usually had bad feelings with various circles because of inspections for stealing electricity, and was afraid that bad people would take the opportunity to cause trouble, and requested the dispatch of soldiers and police for protection. After this incident, the public was indignant at the company for inciting workers to brutally beat up Anti-Japanese Association members and undermine the national salvation movement, and there was a great tendency to attack it en masse. The Party and government authorities, seeing the intense anger of the people and fearing that it would cause a major disturbance, held a joint meeting of the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government at 10:00 AM on the 4th, deciding to first investigate the truth of the matter, and then sent Provincial Party Headquarters members Gan Yun and Wang Huaijin, and Provincial Government members Cheng Shikui and Xu Xianshi to the company to check whether the imported goods were Japanese products before proceeding further. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, various groups also held an emergency meeting at the County Party Headquarters, attended by more than 200 representatives, and resolved six items: (1) request the Provincial Government to arrest Liu Chongwei and Liu Chonglun and hand them over to all circles for public trial; (2) confiscate all the property of Liu Zhengji's warehouse and company to cover the expenses of Ma Zhanshan's army; (3) take back the electric company for official or municipal operation; (4) arrest the thugs Lin Tianmin, Lin Xianmin, Shi Jingchao, Zheng Yanguang, etc. and punish them according to law; (5) all Japanese goods seized by the electric company should be confiscated; (6) the electric company should compensate the victims for medical expenses. After the meeting, all the representatives went to the Provincial Government to petition for implementation, and were met by members Chen Peikun and Zheng Baojing, and Secretary-General Chen Shoufan. In response to the conditions proposed by the representatives, they promised to wait for the Party and government members to investigate and return to see what the situation was before proceeding according to law. The representatives, fearing that Lin Tianmin, Lin Xianmin, and others would flee beforehand, requested that the police be immediately dispatched to arrest them pending further action. Members Chen and Zheng agreed. The representatives then went to the County Party Headquarters to continue the meeting, deciding that if the authorities did not have a satisfactory solution, a city-wide strike would be held on the 5th to express their determination, leaving representatives from the Anti-Japanese Association of all circles: students, merchants, workers, and four groups to wait for a reply, and the rest temporarily dispersed. At around 7:00 PM in the evening, the Party and government members completed their investigation. The four representatives went to the Provincial Party Headquarters to inquire. They were told that more than 2,000 bags of foreign cement were indeed products of the Asano Company, and more than 600 boxes of soybean oil had the Taisho era year printed on the boxes. The remaining coal and electrical materials were also identified as mostly Japanese goods. The electric company stated that they were all handled before the boycott, but it was also inappropriate not to register with the Anti-Japanese Association, and they were advised to tell all circles to wait quietly for the government to deal with it, and not to act rashly. However, because the representatives believed that the authorities had not yet given a concrete answer to the conditions proposed by the assembly, the entire city had implemented a strike on the 5th, with shops closing their doors and students suspending classes. The Provincial Government is scheduled to hold another joint meeting of the Party and government on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss solutions (December 5th).</p>

Song Ziwen chaired the meeting. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) The Department of Industry, Commerce, and Agriculture submitted a case for review and approval regarding the conversion of reclaimed land back to lakes and the commencement of Huai River management starting with its outlet to the sea to prevent flooding.

Regarding the conversion of reclaimed land back to lakes, two principles and five proposed measures were agreed upon. Regarding the commencement of Huai River management starting with its outlet to the sea, due to differing opinions among the experts and representatives, it was resolved to request those who advocated for first managing the river's inlet and those who advocated for first managing its outlet to the sea to submit separate written opinions for review and approval by the ministry and then the Executive Yuan for selection and implementation. Aside from the Huai River issue, which will be submitted separately for review, the agreed-upon measures for the conversion of reclaimed land back to lakes are submitted first for review and implementation. It was resolved to approve the measures after review by the three departments. (2) The Department of Industry submitted a draft of the Factory Registration Regulations for review and record. It was resolved to approve the record.

<p>Middle Schools Decide to Cancel Strike Suzhou middle schools previously (on the 7th) decided to go on strike on the 9th and send a petition group to Beijing to question the government as to why it suppressed petitioning students. If this was ineffective, they would all go to Beijing. The county government, upon hearing the news, immediately consulted with the Department of Education and telegraphed the central government for assistance. The provincial government telegraphed the county to dissuade them. Yesterday (on the 8th), the schools canceled the strike because the arrested Peking University students had been released. However, Soochow University still did not have classes yesterday.</p>

<p>Road Construction Funds Completely Depleted Construction Bureau Director Yao Dixing recently received a telegram from the Provincial Department ordering him to remit 15,288 yuan of road construction Cai Jin to the Provincial Treasury. After receiving the order, Director Yao immediately sent an official letter to the Bank of Communications to inform them. After the bank approved the letter, it stated that the road construction Mu tax had already been used for dike repair and disaster relief, and that the Disaster Relief Committee had previously informed them that the funds could not be used without the committee's notification. However, the Construction Bureau repeatedly requested the bank to withdraw the funds, but the bank politely refused. However, according to the Business Tax Regulations, it was difficult to refuse again, so yesterday it specifically sent a letter to the Disaster Relief Committee to inquire. After receiving the letter, the committee immediately submitted it to the 10th cadre director's standing committee for discussion and resolution. It was still decided that the Provincial Department and the County Government Construction Bureau should be notified that the previous transfer of road construction Mu tax to dike repair and disaster relief should be insisted upon, and that 50,000 yuan of silver should be allocated from the construction expenses. If this request was not granted, it would mean that the government was indifferent to the people's hardships and only knew how to collect taxes from the people, without any practical determination for water conservancy construction. In the future, if there were disasters, they should bear full responsibility, and the committee would announce its dissolution. At the same time, Zou Tongyi, Director of General Affairs of the committee, upon hearing that the funds had been completely withdrawn by Director Yao, felt that there were no funds for dike repair in the future, so he refused to meet with such people who did not care about the local area at the meeting place, and also sent a letter to the Disaster Relief Committee yesterday requesting approval for his resignation. Three Robbers Arrested on the Spot The home of farmer Ni Xiaochun in Anzhen Jiaoshan Shima Bay, Eighth District (Huai Xia Shi), was suddenly visited by three robbers at about 10:00 PM on the 5th of this month. They climbed over the wall and entered, robbing at will. As a result, 19 pieces of clothing and 2 quilts were taken. At that time, Meng Guangyou, the squad leader of the Dongting Town Security Regiment, happened to be leading his soldiers on patrol near the Xintang Bridge when he saw three people carrying packages, looking flustered. He immediately arrested them all and took them back for interrogation. According to their confession, Wang Dabao, Xu Xiaomeng, and Xu Sanhe all admitted to robbing Ni Xiaochun's home. They were then sent to the county government for questioning yesterday. At 4:00 PM, Chief Wang opened the court for interrogation. Later, the plaintiff Ni Xiaochun was summoned to court to identify them, and it was confirmed that they were the robbers. The three robbers were then nailed, chained, and taken into custody to await investigation.</p>

<p>Inspection of Japanese Goods Causes Uproar: After the establishment of the All Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this area, due to the abundance of Japanese goods in Bengbu City, in order to thoroughly ban them, members have been dispatched to various businesses and shops for inspection in recent days. Yesterday, it was reported that Tianxiang Store, which sells Beijing-Guangdong goods on Dama Road, had a large stock of Japanese goods, which were not fully registered, displayed, and sold. The association then sent inspectors Wang Ruobo and others to the store for inspection at 3:00 PM. The store refused the inspection, leading to verbal conflict. Several store employees took off their clothes and surrounded Wang and others, acting aggressively, intending to assault them. Fortunately, someone surnamed Lu and a police officer from the post intervened and persuaded them, preventing any disaster. The inspectors reported back to the association. The Anti-Japanese Association considered the unscrupulous merchants to be refusing inspection of Japanese goods and intending to commit assault, and believed they should be severely punished. They held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the fourth day of the month to discuss countermeasures. At 7:00 PM in the evening, all inspectors of the Anti-Japanese Association, together with soldiers from the Military Police Inspectorate and police officers from the Public Security Bureau, went to Tianxiang for a second review. They seized dozens of pieces of Japanese goods such as velvet blankets and leather balls, which were sealed up for disposal. It is heard that the store has hired someone to intercede with the Anti-Japanese Association for lenient treatment, but it is unknown whether it will be approved.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Special Report: Necessary Improvements to Educational Facilities in Elementary and Secondary Schools in the Face of Brutal Japan's Active Aggression (Part 1) (Wu Zengjie) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Recently, brutal Japan has been advancing steadily. Liaoning and Jilin are no longer our recovered lands, and Heilongjiang Province has also been lost. Which people in the country are not heartbroken? We are in this serious situation and feel that we must strive to become strong and cannot delay any longer. The work of striving to become strong depends on all the people of our country to take on. The responsibility of our colleagues in the education sector is even greater, because those who are educated are either young people or children. Young people are the pillars of the country, and children are the masters of the future. Without healthy and complete children, how can there be healthy and complete young people? Without promising young people, the country will lose its vitality. Therefore, elementary school education is the foundation of all education. The responsibility of colleagues who serve elementary school education can be said to be the most onerous.</p>
<p>In this situation, what kind of policy should we adopt for the education of children, and how should we improve the facilities? It is worthy of research. Can elementary school students resist foreign aggression? Can they do practical national salvation work? Of course not, because in childhood, knowledge is insufficient and ability is lacking. We cannot ask children to do national salvation work immediately. What we must do practically for children is to "make children physically strong, cultivate the habit of using their hands and brains, and the spirit of enduring hardship, and cultivate strength to lay the foundation for national salvation in the future." Does a child simply knowing the fact that Japan has invaded the three northeastern provinces mean they can save the country? No. Does listening to a teacher's lecture on how to save the country mean they can save the country? No. If children are to be able to truly do national salvation work in the future, they must cultivate the strength to save the country.</p>
<p>Since Japan invaded the three northeastern provinces, the teaching in general elementary schools has centered on this event, connecting the teaching materials of various subjects and often talking to elementary school students about anti-Japanese methods and portraying the situation of Japanese atrocities. This work is certainly very good, but it is only biased towards knowledge. We must know that it is relatively easy to make elementary school students understand the atrocities of Japan, but if we only let elementary school students know without cultivating strength, then so-called national salvation is really just empty talk.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Sun Ke and Others Left Hong Kong for Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Arrival Expected Tomorrow Afternoon or the Morning After</p>
<p>Li Shizeng Ordered to Shanghai for Long Talk with Wang</p>
<p>Shanghai's Central Committee Members to be Dealt with by the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Li Shizeng, the representative from Beijing, was ordered to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, he had a long conversation with Wang Jingwei, the representative from Guangdong. The content of the conversation is unknown. Furthermore, after the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session of Guangdong, four representatives, Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren, were appointed and left Hong Kong for Shanghai yesterday. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai around tomorrow afternoon or the morning after. They will then meet with representatives from Beijing to discuss the opening of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee. As for the ten Central Committee members elected in Shanghai, according to Wang Jingwei, they will be dealt with by the Fourth Plenary Session. The details of each piece of news are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang and Li's Long Talk</p>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Beijing sent representative Li Shizeng to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, Wang wrote to Li, inviting him to meet at Chu Minyi's residence on Avenue Albert. Wang arrived at Chu's residence around 2:00 PM with his wife, Chen Bijun, and others, waiting for Li. Li arrived around 4:00 PM. The two met for about one and a half hours, with Chu also present to listen. Li left around 6:30 PM. Afterwards, when reporters inquired with Wang, Wang said that the meeting with Li was just a chat and there was no discussion of anything substantive. Reporters inquired elsewhere but also did not get any definite information. The content of the conversation is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Sun and Others Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session of Guangdong, Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren were appointed to come to Shanghai for discussions. Sun and the others were originally scheduled to leave Hong Kong the day before yesterday (the 7th), but later, due to the urgency of the matter, it was changed to yesterday. According to Guangdong representative Wang Jingwei, he has received a report from Guangdong stating that Guangdong has sent Sun, Wu, Li, and Chen as representatives, who are traveling to Shanghai on the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Line, expected to arrive here around tomorrow. Furthermore, according to Madam Sun Zhesheng, Sun will arrive in Shanghai by plane, expected to arrive in the next day or two. It is not known which is correct.</p>
<p>The Issue of the Ten Committee Members</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the ten committee members elected by the Guangdong representatives who walked out of the meeting at the Fourth Plenary Session of Guangdong and held a meeting in Shanghai some days ago, according to Wang, this matter is not a major problem. Currently, Guangdong has not officially recognized the twenty-four new committee members elected by Beijing, and Beijing has not officially recognized the twenty-four new committee members elected by Guangdong. (According to the reporter, the resolution of the peace conference stipulated that the new committee members elected by both sides must be mutually recognized.) Therefore, the issue of these ten committee members can be decided by the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Executive and Supervisory Committees, so as not to cause any disputes. The various rumors circulating outside are not credible.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Zou Lu Issues Statement <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong representative Zou Lu stated to a Far Eastern News Agency reporter yesterday that it is regrettable that the new diplomatic policy of the Nanjing government is insincere. Dr. Wellington Koo's proposal to establish a buffer zone in the northeast of Jinzhou is a major error. It raises the suspicion that Koo's action is simply to cede Manchuria to the Japanese. The Nanjing government, due to the opposition of the national public to its new diplomatic policy, has suddenly gone back on its word and denied having this proposition. This is not only unfaithful to the people of the country, but also leaves people in the community unaware of the government's true diplomatic policy intentions. The student and public movements are entirely driven by patriotism, and Nanjing's attempt to suppress the people's patriotic movement will only increase the people's resentment towards the government. Nanjing's detention of students, the shooting of seven students in Changsha, and the strict prohibition of railway staff from transporting students to Nanjing to petition all serve to increase the stimulation of the Chinese people and youth and cause them to lose faith in the government.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Youth Support-Manchuria Corps Postpones Departure to Tomorrow Morning <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Preparations Before and After Departure</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Youth Volunteer Corps to Support Manchuria and Resist Japan has already received the understanding of the Central Government, which ordered the railway bureau to prepare first-class carriages for them. However, the corps intends not to accept them and will still march to Beijing, and has postponed the departure by one day. The news of yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>Corps Members' Race</p>
<p>The corps believes that the work on this journey is arduous and cannot be forcibly undertaken by those with weak endowments and unhealthy bodies. Therefore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, the corps members engaged in a race in the suburbs of Zhenru for four hours to weed out those who could not undertake long-distance walking, so as to avoid feeling stuck and unable to move forward or backward midway.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Prepares Carriages</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the Central Government ascertained that the corps members were purely patriotic individuals, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, without any partisan agenda, it was deemed possible to provide assistance. Therefore, not only did it not hinder their journey, but it also issued orders to military police in various places to provide protection. The Ministry of Railways also ordered the railway bureau to prepare first-class carriages for them. However, the corps' spirit is driven by resisting Japan and saving the country, and they have long disregarded issues of honor and disgrace. Therefore, they unanimously stated that they must adhere to their original intention and still march to Beijing.</p>
<p>Postponement of Departure</p>
<p>The corps was originally scheduled to depart from Zhenru this morning, but yesterday they temporarily postponed it by one day and are now scheduled to march to Beijing at dawn tomorrow.</p>
<p>Corps Meeting</p>
<p>Because the original members of each group have mostly left the corps, and many new members have joined, the corps held a corps meeting at Jinan University yesterday in order to strengthen the internal organization, re-allocated organizational duties, and assigned each new member to serve in each department according to their abilities, so that talents could be used and people could be used effectively.</p>
<p>Donations from All Circles</p>
<p>Minister of Military and Political Affairs He Yingqin specially donated 500 yuan in living expenses to the corps yesterday. Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun and Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng each donated 100 yuan to the corps for travel expenses. In addition, Mr. Wang Dafo came to Jinan University to send clothing and expressed his bitterness at not being able to go north with them. Seeing the loyalty and courage of each corps member, and being prevented from going north immediately by the railway bureau, he shed tears for two hours. He was so deeply affected that he fainted on the spot and was resuscitated and sent back by the corps members.</p>
<p>Telegram to Zhang Xueliang</p>
<p>Zhang Shaojie, the leader of the corps, telegraphed Zhang Xueliang yesterday, saying, "Commander Zhang, Beiping, esteemed sir. Your reply has been received. Since you are reorganizing your troops and heading east, I hope you will be determined to fight the violent Japanese to the death. I am now leading hundreds of passionate youths north, vowing to be the vanguard. If you cannot depart, we will also decide to go to Heilongjiang Province, regardless of sacrifice, and must reach our destination. We hope for assistance at that time."</p>
<p>Corps Members Join</p>
<p>The corps members who joined yesterday included Zhou Kegong, who had originally joined the corps and sworn an oath with blood but was forced back by his family and escaped again, Wu Yuanyi, an overseas Chinese from Sumatra, a nurse from the Wusong Sanatorium (who did not want to announce her name for fear of family interference), and Shen Xunru from Haimen, totaling more than ten people.</p>
<p>Rear Support</p>
<p>The rear support consultants of the corps, Huang Jingwan, Zhang Yichen, Wu Shan, Tan Bozhi, Pan Xulun, and Qian Jianqiu, held a meeting at Yipinxiang last night to discuss the organization of the rear support group, methods for promoting the corps, and raising funds.</p>
<p>Corps Statement</p>
<p>In order to prevent villains from swindling under their name, the corps issued a statement to all circles, stating that after the corps goes north, there will be no corps members left behind to solicit donations. If enthusiastic compatriots provide assistance, they can send it directly to the Shanghai Bank in person and obtain a receipt. For the Nanyang area, please send it to the Hefeng Bank. In case of any swindling under their name, please immediately stop it.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Zhang Futian Successfully Immitates Building a Single-Wing Airplane <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, Zhang Futian of this city's Automotive Editorial Office has recently immitated the building of an American single-wing light airplane and succeeded after five months of work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Immitation Process</p>
<p>At the end of May this year, when the aviation conference was held, Zhang Futian believed that the aviation industry was developing rapidly, but apart from the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Department, there were no other successors in the country who built their own aircraft. Therefore, he decided to try building an aircraft himself. However, since large ones were too expensive, he decided to immitate the American single-wing light airplane (RusselHendersonMonoplane) and immediately started work. By the end of October, it was completed.</p>
<p>Aircraft Costs</p>
<p>The aircraft's engine is a Hunterson machine free car air-cooled engine, which Zhang bought for 30 yuan. The fabric of the fuselage is domestic coarse cloth. The paint and wood are also domestic products. However, the shrinkage force of domestic paint is weak and cannot withstand changes in the air. Therefore, the wings (the wings are made of British fine yarn, as domestic products cannot be used) had to be tightened three times before they could be completed, but they are still not comparable to foreign aircraft. The assistants to Zhang were a sofa chair tailor, an ordinary carpenter, and an ordinary automobile coppersmith. To check the horizontal and vertical planes, ordinary levels were used, as these components could not be purchased domestically. The total cost was 1,400 yuan, which is only one-sixtieth of the cost of purchasing an aircraft from abroad, which costs more than 70,000 yuan per aircraft. According to Zhang, the cost of the second successful aircraft can be further reduced.</p>
<p>Aircraft Details</p>
<p>The aircraft's horsepower is only 23 horsepower, with four cylinders, a speed of 70 miles per hour, and can fly 800 feet per minute. However, it can only seat one driver.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Fuselage</p>
<p>The fuselage is more than 15 feet long and 26 feet wide. The wings are yellow, as are the pillows and elevators. The sides of the nose are red, and the fuselage is green. It can store three gallons of fuel and can fly for three hours.</p>
<p>Application for Test Flight</p>
<p>After the aircraft was completed, Zhang applied to the China Aviation Corporation and aviation factories for a test flight, but was politely rejected by all parties. Therefore, he had to apply to the Aviation Administration for a test flight. The Aviation Administration has approved it, will send personnel to review it, and then schedule a test flight. They have also praised Zhang's imitation and have ordered him to report the cost.</p>
<p>Zhang's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Zhang is a native of Liuhe, Jiangsu, 36 years old, and graduated from the mechanical department of the American Wan Guo Correspondence School. He has worked in automobile and steamship engineering and has authored books such as Practical Automobile Repair and Working Methods and Practical Automobile Study with Repair Methods.</p>

<p>Cheng Zhenjun Returns to Beijing to Report on Negotiations</p>
<p>Still Coming to Shanghai to Prepare for Reception of Six Experts</p>
<p>Regarding the expansion of the scope of Chinese-owned cotton mills and the additional purchase of yarn spindles, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry, had previously drafted a plan to temporarily allocate a portion of the Boxer Indemnity to purchase yarn spindles for use by Chinese-owned cotton mills along the Beijing-Shanghai line. This proposal had already been approved by the Central Political Council. In order to realize this matter as soon as possible, Minister Kong sent Cheng Zhenjun, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry, to Shanghai to negotiate the procedures for purchasing yarn spindles with British merchants and sign the contract. It is learned that Cheng has completed the procedures in Shanghai, the contract for the purchase of yarn spindles has been resolved by signing with the British merchant representative, and he took the night express to Beijing yesterday to report to Minister Kong on the negotiations with the British merchant. It is said that Cheng will stay in Beijing for no more than three or four days and will still come to Shanghai to discuss with Shen Shouchang and other members of the Huai River Guidance Committee the preparations for receiving the six engineering experts, Ding Gaode, Liu Men, Ao Jingju, etc., who are coming to Shanghai from the United States at the end of the month.</p>

<p>A Telegram from Radio Station Employees to the Ministry of Transportation</p>
<p>All employees of the National Radio Station telegraphed the Central Government, saying, "Urgent, Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, esteemed sirs, the loss of the Eastern Provinces is nearly three months. Foreign insults are deepening, and national affairs are increasingly urgent. Our country did not prepare in advance and has no good policies after the fact. Diplomacy does not prioritize public opinion, and the military does not fulfill its duty to defend the territory. The Eastern Provinces were lost in the past due to non-resistance, and the humiliating treaty is about to be tacitly recognized in the future. The people are running and shouting, but the authorities are superficially accommodating. Students go to Beijing to petition, but are seen as being used. Thinking of this, where do our tears come from? We employees are deeply concerned about the difficulties of the times, as if sitting on pins and needles, looking ahead to the future, our hearts are filled with worry. As citizens, how can we sit idly by? Therefore, we telegraph and request that your ministry firmly reject the proposal to demarcate Jinzhou as a neutral zone, and firmly deny the proposal for joint administration of Tianjin. Immediately implement revolutionary diplomacy and recover lost territory by force to protect the country and defend national rights. All students arrested for petitioning should also be released immediately to comply with public opinion and safeguard human rights. The national situation is precarious, and the situation is dire. We are telegraphing with grief and anticipation. All employees of the National Radio Station under the Ministry of Transportation."</p>

<p>Telegram from the People of Wu County</p>
<p>The Wu County Education Association and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee telegraphed the Commander and all officers and soldiers of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, saying, "Respectfully reading your telegram, we learned of your loyalty, courage, and righteousness in requesting to support Heilongjiang. We are filled with admiration and respect. General Ma of Heilongjiang used a small force to defend the border, fighting bravely for more than ten days. His loyalty and courage were unwavering. He lost Longjiang due to lack of support and exhausted supplies. How sad is this news! We have not heard of any troops from various places coming to support him. Fortunately, your telegram resonated, and the morale of the people was boosted. With your sincerity, you will surely be approved by the authorities. We hope you will immediately prepare to mobilize and go north to defeat the enemy. We will respectfully await the good news. As for the issue of supplies, please do not worry.

<p>Telegram from Radio Station Employees to the Ministry of Transportation</p>
<p>All employees of the National Radio Station telegraphed the Central Government, saying, "Urgent, Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, esteemed sirs, the loss of the Eastern Provinces is nearly three months. Foreign insults are deepening, and national affairs are increasingly urgent. Our country did not prepare in advance and has no good policies after the fact. Diplomacy does not prioritize public opinion, and the military does not fulfill its duty to defend the territory. The Eastern Provinces were lost in the past due to non-resistance, and the humiliating treaty is about to be tacitly recognized in the future. The people are running and shouting, but the authorities are superficially accommodating. Students go to Beijing to petition, but are seen as being used. Thinking of this, where do our tears come from? We employees are deeply concerned about the difficulties of the times, as if sitting on pins and needles, looking ahead to the future, our hearts are filled with worry. As citizens, how can we sit idly by? Therefore, we telegraph and request that your ministry firmly reject the proposal to demarcate Jinzhou as a neutral zone, and firmly deny the proposal for joint administration of Tianjin. Immediately implement revolutionary diplomacy and recover lost territory by force to protect the country and defend national rights. All students arrested for petitioning should also be released immediately to comply with public opinion and safeguard human rights. The national situation is precarious, and the situation is dire. We are telegraphing with grief and anticipation. All employees of the National Radio Station under the Ministry of Transportation, Qi."</p>

<p>The Wu County Education Association and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee telegraphed the Commander and all officers and soldiers of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, saying, "Respectfully reading your telegram, we learned of your loyalty, courage, and righteousness in requesting to support Heilongjiang.

He lost Longjiang due to lack of support and exhausted supplies. How sad is this news! We have not heard of any troops from various places coming to support him. Fortunately, your telegram resonated, and the morale of the people was boosted. With your sincerity, you will surely be approved by the authorities.

<p>The Guangdong Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued a telegram yesterday opposing the division of Jinzhou into a neutral zone and the co-management of Tianjin, saying, "To our fellow countrymen across the country: Since the Japanese invaders violated our borders, they have occupied thousands of miles of land in a matter of dozens of hours. Recently, the national situation has become increasingly pressing. Not only has our government not taken any resistance measures, but it has also proposed dividing Jinzhou into a neutral zone and offering Tianjin for international co-management. Is this not the same as handing a knife to the enemy and letting them slaughter us? How can there be anything more outrageous than this? The Republic of China is the country of all the people, not the private property of an individual or a small number of people, who can sell or give it away as they please. If these two measures are implemented, then there will be no clean land left in our country, and there will be no survivors among the entire nation. Our association hereby leads all the Guangdong overseas Chinese in Shanghai to vow to fight to the death. The crisis of survival is imminent. We urge our fellow countrymen across the country to strive for it. The Shanghai Guangdong Overseas Chinese Community United Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association kowtows with respect."</p>

<p>Representatives of the Medan Chinese General Chamber of Commerce came to Shanghai to solicit products from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall. Since the Commodity Exhibition Hall of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce opened the first floor exhibition area as a national goods market, the number of visitors has increased significantly. Yesterday, more than one hundred students from the Zhenru National Jinan University, led by Mr. Liu from the school, visited the hall and successively visited the market and the exhibits in various departments. Before leaving, they frequently praised it and recognized the hall as the most suitable place for researching and purchasing national goods. Recently, various places at home and abroad have continuously commissioned the hall to solicit products and inquire about news of national goods. It is reported that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Sumatra, Nanyang, deeply hates the Japanese invasion and the current national crisis. In order to seek goods from the motherland and widely promote sales in the local area, the Chinese merchants of the port have specially commissioned Mr. Zheng ChaoYi to come to Shanghai to solicit samples of national goods, so as to use them as blueprints for future large-scale procurement. A few days ago, Mr. Zheng visited the hall and requested an introduction to national goods factories so that he could personally go to solicit samples.</p>

<h3 id="e112">News on the Preparation of Air Main Lines <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Trial Flight to Chengdu in Mid-Month</p>
<p>Aircraft for the Shanghai-Guangdong Line Ordered from the United States</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Chengdu main line has already opened to traffic and reached Chongqing. The preparation for flight and station establishment between Chongqing and Chengdu will be realized in the near future. The Shanghai-Guangdong line is also under preparation. The survey news of the main lines is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the trial flight to Chengdu and station establishment in Chongqing and Chengdu, the company has repeatedly consulted with the Sichuan provincial authorities by telegram. Recently, it has obtained the approval of Liu Wenhui, chairman of Sichuan Province. The airport will be located near Phoenix Mountain in Chengdu, where the plains are vast and flat, which is very suitable for establishing a site. The radio required by the station has already been purchased in Shanghai and will be transported there soon. The Chongqing-Chengdu section trial flight will be carried out in mid-month. The aircraft will use the land aircraft of the Beijing-Ping main line, because the distance between them is very close, and the flight only takes two hours. The official opening of the route will be within two months.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Route Preparation. The Shanghai-Guangdong line plans to set up stations along the coast, including Ningbo, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shantou, and Guangzhou. Each station will use the original equipment of the military and political departments to prepare for aircraft takeoff and landing. Because the aircraft on the Beijing-Ping and Shanghai-Hankou lines are not enough for allocation, the company officially sent a telegram to the American Commercial Transportation Company in New York yesterday, requesting the American aircraft factory to manufacture four seaplanes on its behalf. The speed of flight will be increased by 30 miles per hour (that is, 140 miles) compared with the aircraft currently in operation. These new aircraft will be transported to China in about three months. The Shanghai-Guangdong line is scheduled to be officially opened to traffic in April of the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Beijing-Ganzhou Route Uncertain. The preparation for the Beijing-Ganzhou route is difficult to realize for a while, because the commerce along the route is not very developed. Even if the Chongqing-Chengdu section and the Shanghai-Guangdong line are completed, the company's board of directors will still have to deliberate and consider the situation before making a decision.</p>

The ships of the China Merchants Bureau that were scheduled to depart yesterday, including Yushun to Haizhou, Xinfeng to Weihaiwei and then to Yantai and Tianjin, Haiyan to Wenzhou, Jiangda along the Yangtze River, and Xinjiangtian to Ningbo, were all suspended due to fog and will depart another day. Jiangda, which was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, also did not arrive due to fog. Changxing's Canada had not yet left the port by 6:00 PM. In addition, more than 30 ships, including the Russian Empress, Jardine Matheson's Fulsheng, and Taikoo's Zhejiang, which could have entered the port in Japan yesterday, were anchored at the Wusongkou anchorage, waiting to enter the port after the fog dissipated today. The China National Aviation Corporation's planes from Shanghai to Beijing and from Beijing to Shanghai were also suspended due to fog yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Patrolmen Involved in Kidnapping <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Helping to Transport Guns</p>
<p>Tried in the Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Jin Yangjin, a Chinese detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and others previously arrested a large number of male and female bandits, including Shan Yaonan, at 50 Taopeng Lane, Taopeng Road, and sent them to the First Special District Court for trial. It has been recorded in this newspaper that the Western and Chinese detectives in charge of this case interrogated the arrested criminals. According to the confession of the ninth defendant, Gu Chenshi, the eighth defendant, Wang Hailan, had used a gun to rob a certain family surnamed at 897 Maigen Road on the 28th of last month. After the incident, she was given a gold watch and five yuan in paper money. However, when the robbery occurred, two guns were transported by Gao Xinpu, a native of Anhui who was serving as a Chinese policeman with number 1986. The Western and Chinese detectives investigated and found that the Chinese policeman was currently serving at the Huizi Police Station, so they telegraphed the head of the Huizi Police Station to detain Officer Gao. They also took the defendants Gu Chenshi and Wang Hailan to the police station to identify Officer Gao among the other ten policemen. Gu and Wang pointed out Officer Gao, so he was taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the case, saying that after the defendant Gao Xinpu was arrested, Gao denied helping to transport firearms at the police station. He said that between March and April of this year, he was serving at the General Police Station. One day on the way to inspect pedestrians, he saw that Gu Chenshi and Wang Hailan looked suspicious, so he searched them. Wang was unwilling and was slapped several times, resulting in a grudge. Now, she is falsely accusing him. The defendants Gu Chenshi and Wang Hailan successively surrendered to the court and confessed that before the robbery on Maigen Road, they first discussed the matter in the four-story building behind the Great World in the French Concession. Ren Jinbiao, the seventh defendant, handed over a gun to Gu Chenshi to transport to the four-story building and transfer it to the defendant Gao Xinpu. Gao and a stout man with a hemp coat went out at about 4:00 and did not return until 8:00, still handing the gun to Gu Chenshi to take back. However, she was timid and afraid that something would happen on the way, so she refused to carry it, so the defendant took it to Wang Hailan's house. The defendant denied what they said. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered Officer Gao to be detained for a retrial on the 17th of this month with Shan Yaonan and others.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Rumors That the Lost Son of a Widow Is Still Alive <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Did Not Drown in the River</p>
<p>Zhu Songlin Confessed the Truth</p>
<p>Yao Zhusheng Was Indeed Framed</p>
<p>Ju Sheng, the eight-year-old son of the widow Yao Gu, was kidnapped by bandits at the entrance of his grandmother's house at 96 An'nan Road on July 7 of this year and a ransom was demanded. Jin Yangwu, a Chinese detective from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and others arrested two suspects in the case, Zhu Songlin and Lu Wangshi, and sent them to the Special Court. Zhu confessed that he had kidnapped Yao Jusheng, but that Jusheng had drowned in the Huangpu River. He also said that the mastermind of the case was Yao Zhusheng, the clan chief of Yao, and that Lu Wangshi had no connection with the case. The court ordered Zhu to be detained and released on bail. Later, the police arrested Yao Zhusheng and interrogated him several times, but it was still inconclusive. During the last court trial, Zhu Songlin suddenly changed his testimony, saying that the child Yao Jusheng had not drowned and had been fostered on a boat of a boatman surnamed in Huangpu River in Pudong. The Western and Chinese detectives went to search for him at the address for a long time, but there was still no trace. Therefore, the life and death of Yao Jusheng is still in doubt. At 2:30 yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi came to the Second Criminal Court again for a retrial. The family of the victim hired lawyer Chen Tingrui, and the court appointed Ye Fikang as Zhu Songlin's pro bono lawyer. Yao Zhusheng hired two lawyers, Tao Wuzhi and Yu Hualong, to defend him in court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that since the defendant Zhu Songlin confessed the whereabouts of the child last time, the police immediately ordered detectives to search, but the result was nothing, which shows that Zhu's confession is unreliable. Judge Wu then interrogated Zhu. According to Zhu, the child Yao Jusheng did die. After he kidnapped Jusheng, he secretly fostered him on the boat of Lu Bingsheng, Xiaohua, and a person surnamed Yu. The boat was parked near the Hufeng Warehouse in Pudong. Fearing that it would be exposed, he dressed Jusheng in women's clothing and put a gold ring on his left ear. He took off the pair of slippers that Jusheng was wearing and prepared to send them to his grandmother. On the way, he turned to his home in Liuliqiao, Pudong. His wife saw him and asked him about it. He told her the truth. His wife made a lot of noise, so he falsely claimed that the child had drowned in the Huangpu River. Yao Zhusheng and Lu Wangshi were all falsely accused and had nothing to do with the case. His formal accomplices were Lu, Dong, Yu, and others. What he said today is all true and there are no falsehoods. Yao Zhusheng confessed that he was indeed framed by Zhu, but he has suffered a lot. After the interrogation, all the witnesses have been examined. The lawyers from all parties then stood up and debated for a long time. At the end, Prosecutor Li Ying expressed his opinion. Judge Wu announced that the debate in this case was over and that the verdict would be announced at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month. Yao Zhusheng was released on bail pending further summons.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Report on the Disaster Relief Efforts of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association in Jiangbei <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>This time, the provinces suffered from unprecedented floods. In the Jiangbei area, there are still areas where the water has not receded. The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association is making every effort to carry out emergency winter relief. In addition to the joint associations in Hankou and other ports, as well as branches specially set up in Wuhu and the severely affected areas in northern Anhui, it also attaches great importance to the Jiangbei area. Branches have been successively established in Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Taixian, Dongtai, Xinghua, Yancheng, Huaiyin, and Huai'an to actively provide relief. Cotton clothes are also being distributed in Baoying, Jiangpu, and other counties. Recently, many reports have been received from various branches. The report from the Yancheng branch is transcribed below. "Respectfully, this year's flood has exceeded the flood of the 10th year of the Republic of China. The number of houses that have been washed away is particularly large. We are entrusted by your association to handle the Yancheng relief work, and we should do our best to investigate and distribute the supplies properly. The details of the first distribution and the recent distribution situation, as well as the urgent need for relief among the disaster victims, are briefly described below. The first relief fund of 12,000 yuan, in addition to 2,000 yuan for emergency relief and medicines, the remaining 10,000 yuan and winter clothes were distributed in five districts. Because there are many disaster victims and the disaster area is very wide, the relief fund is limited. If it is distributed to everyone, each person will receive very little, which is not very helpful. Therefore, we first chose to distribute it in the first, second, seventh, eleventh, and thirteenth districts (Yancheng has a total of fourteen districts). Now we have received a second relief fund of 20,000 yuan and winter clothes, and we have been instructed to contact the National Government Relief Committee to discuss the distribution plan. We have already contacted them and decided to adopt the universal distribution method. We will use the rotating universal distribution method. Therefore, this time, we will investigate and distribute it in the third, ninth, twelfth, and fourteenth districts. Next time, we will investigate and distribute it in the fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, and tenth districts, so that the entire county will be covered. It is not that we do not want to distribute it to everyone each time, but it is like using a cup of water to put out a fire, which will only arouse public resentment. Therefore, we have adopted the rotating distribution method so that the disaster victims can survive for a few days or a dozen days after receiving the relief. Most of the disaster victims distributed this time are extremely poor families. The cold winter is coming soon, and the poor will soon run out of food. The famine situation next spring is expected to be a hundred times worse than this year. The requests for relief have already piled up like snowflakes. We hope that more relief funds will be added to meet the needs of relief. In addition, 10,000 gold coins should be provided to provide more assistance, as the effect is very good. The poor and sick are becoming more and more numerous. The health team is only set up in the city, while the countryside is suffering from lack of relief. "</p>

<p>After Zhao Tieqiao, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau in Shanghai, was assassinated on July 24th last year, Wang Jinshan (also known as Wang Ganting or Wang Xiaolaosan), the murderer in the case, was arrested on September 29th of the same year by Qi Haitian, the leader of the detective team of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, on Avenue Dubail in the French Concession. At the same time, Director Shen of the County Public Security Bureau went to Anhui and arrested Xia Shaoen. After investigation and trial by the Shanghai Local Court, both criminals were sentenced to death. Details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper.

The presiding judge ordered that further testimony and investigation were necessary for this case and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>According to Guomin She, Fili lace, produced in Pudong, Wuxi, Rugao, and other places, is a kind of Chinese-made product woven from cotton thread into a net-like pattern. It is mainly exported to Europe and the United States, with an annual export value of about one million. Most of the businesses are located in the Pudong area, hence the organization of the Chuansha Fili Lace Industry Association. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance intends to levy a 5/1000 business tax on the industry. The industry believes that this lace is a handicraft made by rural women, and imposing a heavy tax would directly affect the national economy and the people's livelihood and indirectly hinder foreign trade. They believe that Fili lace qualifies as a tax-exempt item. Based on various reasons, they have sent representatives to Beijing overnight with official documents to petition the Ministries of Industry and Finance. At the same time, they are also preparing to request the Ministry of Industry to rectify the production of Fili lace and provide protection, with the aim of actively developing exports.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu and Director of the Chinese National Martial Arts Hall, hosted a banquet at the Zhongshe on Weihaiwei Road the other day, inviting celebrities from Shanghai and business leaders to promote Chinese life insurance. More than 20 people attended, including Shi Liangcai, Song Zijing, Qu Wenliu, Lan Ting, Xu Xinliu, Huang Hanzhi, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Yunzhai, Ji Yunqing, Wang Binyan, Xiang Songmao, Wu Zhihao, Ren Huageng, Shen Sizhuang, and Yang Wuxin. During the banquet, Zhang first raised his glass to wish everyone good health and talked about life insurance as a new undertaking with both public welfare and commercial aspects in China today. At a time when everyone is advocating domestic products, the Ningshao Life Insurance Company, with its substantial capital, capable personnel, and precise organization, has emerged to recover rights and interests, protect individual production, promote local stability, and strive to strengthen physical health. This kind of undertaking is very much in line with my aspirations to promote national martial arts and the responsibility of maintaining peace and quiet in the locality. Therefore, I am willing to do my best to promote its success and hope that people from all walks of life will jointly promote it to achieve popularity. Then, Hu Yongqi, the general manager of Ningshao Life Insurance Company, stood up and talked about the history of the life insurance business. He briefly stated that life insurance originated in the United Kingdom and gradually spread to Europe and the United States after it was initially a mutual aid system. Nowadays, Germany has gone further and is operated by the government, called social insurance, to assist the rule of law in the country. Recently, the development of the life insurance business in the United States is the best in the world, providing considerable protection for the three major problems that everyone cannot avoid: "illness," "old age," and "death." Therefore, the country is rich and strong, society is peaceful, and life is happy. Ningshao Company adopts the most scientific methods of American insurance companies, and the investment is even more cautious. As for the income and expenditure accounts, they are completely open to show good faith. Now, let me briefly state the three differences between Chinese insurance companies and foreign insurance companies as follows: (1) Chinese companies have lower premiums; (2) Chinese company policies are in Chinese, which is easy to understand; (3) Chinese companies are subject to Chinese law. Therefore, I hope that leaders from all walks of life will promote and advocate it. Then, Yuan Ludeng talked about the past failures of the Chinese insurance business. The reason is that the people who run it do not understand the principles of insurance and use scientific methods, which makes the general public suspicious and dare not try it. Now, Ningshao Company, with a long time of preparation and a very precise organization, comes out to serve the society and will surely live up to the public's elegant intention of loving national assets and businesses. Then, Shen Sizhuang gave a speech, briefly stating that those of us who advocate life insurance are serious and strict in handling affairs. The general public thinks that Chinese companies can all be perfunctory, but Ningshao Company is not. For several weeks, judging from the strict physical examination alone, it is enough to show the precision of its system. Secondly, from an economic point of view, (1) prudent investment (2) open accounts, judging from the above points, I, as a third party and the insured, am willing to introduce and promote it with 12 points of faith. I hope that leaders from all walks of life will jointly introduce, promote, and insure, and then the development of Chinese businesses can be predicted. It dispersed at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Stopped Trading with Japanese Merchants Long Ago After the Wanbaoshan Incident</p>
<p>Willing to Pay a Fine of 10,000 Yuan If Undeniable Evidence is Provided</p>
<p>The raw materials and printed materials used in the various cigarettes produced by Huacheng Tobacco Company are not enemy goods. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the National Goods League, the Cigarette Factory Association, the Color Printing Industry Association, and other groups have investigated and confirmed that they are indeed genuine domestic goods. Recently, in a case where a zinc plate was stolen from a Japanese rubber printing shop, it was found that there was a zinc plate for printing the company's Beauty brand cigarettes. Unscrupulous people have taken the opportunity to wantonly slander and even sent letters to the company to question it. Now, in order to express its sincerity, the company has offered a reward of 10,000 yuan. Anyone who can provide evidence to prove that Huacheng still trades with Japanese merchants after the boycott, after being verified by a legitimate merchant group, is willing to pay a fine of 10,000 yuan. If there are rumors and deliberate slanders, the company will ask the fellow law firm to file a lawsuit and severely punish the rumor-mongers.</p>

<p>Both Sides Invite Witnesses</p>
<p>Sun Yunqing Is Ashamed of Being Old</p>
<p>Sun Yunqing, the owner of the Qingliange shopping mall, is over sixty years old. His third concubine, Jiang Cuiling, is beautiful and young, which is quite pitiful. On July 24th of this year, Jiang suddenly left. She then hired lawyer Chen Bingxing to negotiate with Sun, proposing conditions for separation. Sun did not accept because her demands were too harsh. Jiang then filed a criminal complaint against Sun for abuse and battery. At the end of the first trial, the plaintiff's claim was dismissed. Jiang was not satisfied and filed an appeal. As a result of the second trial, Sun Yunqing was fined 50 yuan. Sun was also not satisfied and filed a third trial appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The result was that the case was returned to the court of the second trial for a retrial. Yesterday afternoon, Zhou Han, the chief of the criminal court of the First Special District Court, and two judges, Feng and Shen, specially convened a collegiate panel for the retrial. Sun's lawyers, Ni Zheng'ou and Zhang Deqin, and Jiang's lawyer, Chen Bingxing, all appeared in court, and both parties and their witnesses were also present. First, Jiang Cuiling recounted the incident of being beaten by Sun on July 22nd. Then, her close friend, Zhu Lindi, testified that she was also present and witnessed Sun beating Jiang on the day in question. Then, Dr. Chen testified that he treated Jiang several times and diagnosed that she was injured in the buttocks. Then, Sun's witness, Zhu Wu (i.e., Lindi's mother), claimed that Sun and Jiang had always been harmonious and Sun had never abused her. Her daughter, Lindi, did not go to Sun's house on July 22nd, and all her statements were false. Xu Shiping testified that he was a friend of Sun and that Sun had asked him to persuade Jiang to return. He witnessed Sun and Jiang talking, and Jiang did not say that Sun beat her on that day, only saying why they fought last year, but Sun denied it all. Jiang did not say anything else. Finally, Sun Yunqing gave a detailed account of the beginning and end of the incident. He seemed quite angry when he spoke, saying that it was all because he was old and worthless. He still sobbed after the statement. After the lawyers of both sides debated each other, the judge ordered that the sentence be announced on the 14th.</p>

<p>The British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. accused its comprador Shen Chengfu of embezzling more than 3 million yuan of public funds at the police station. Shen then surrendered himself to the police station. The lawyer of Shanghai Municipal Council, Ru Baoyi, filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court based on the crime of breach of trust under the Criminal Law. The details of the first trial have been reported in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Xu Jiashi, the chief of the criminal court, opened the first criminal court to continue the trial. First, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., stated that although the plaintiff's accounts have been found, they are all in English and have not yet been translated into Chinese. He requested a postponement of one week. Shen Chengfu's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Shan Yuhua, immediately stood up and claimed that this case was a matter of fact. Now that the plaintiff is requesting a postponement, the defendant should be allowed to post a security to wait for the trial outside. On the plaintiff's side, Shen can be allowed to clear the accounts together. On the court's side, it can also save time. Because once the accounts are cleared, the trial can be expedited. The lawyer of the police station, Ru, stated that criminal cases are based on the standard of false accusation and do not depend on the size of the amount. Now that the defendant is requesting bail, my lawyer does not object, but an appropriate guarantee must be provided. Judge Xu verified and reported, and then ordered that the case be postponed for one week and the application to stop the detention was rejected.</p>

<p>Gao Qiaosong from Fengjing used to work as a partner at Deshunxiang Foreign Goods Store on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, but was dismissed due to his absurdity. Gao is over thirty years old and still a widower. Recently, he had a whimsical idea and rented a stone-gate building at No. 51 Qinyefang on Route Ghisi in West Shanghai. All the furniture was rented from a rental shop, deliberately creating a lavish scene. Those who did not know thought it was a wealthy family. When he moved in, relatives such as wet nurses and aunts came to help with the arrangements. A few days ago, Gao entrusted Lao Deji Matchmaker Shop in Avenue Edward VII, whom he knew well, to hire a maidservant, who must be young and beautiful. He chose Xu Sanmei, who was 22 years old (Xu was from the North Gate of Qingpu and had been promised to a Sun family). The matchmaker agreed on a monthly salary of six yuan. Unexpectedly, after Sanmei entered the door to work, she saw that the female guests had dispersed in the evening, leaving only the master and servant. After dinner, Gao said to Sanmei, "Have you married?" She replied, "Not yet." Gao said again, "I am not yet married either. Why don't you be my companion? It's better than a villager. Please don't refuse." Sanmei blushed when she heard this and did not say a word. Unexpectedly, Gao's animalistic nature surged and he could not stop himself. He actually tried to force her. Sanmei was quick-witted and made an excuse that she was having her period and that she would let him do as he pleased after it was over. Gao believed it to be true and reluctantly let go. Sanmei broke free and hired a car to go to her brother Yuan Kui's Yongxiang South Goods Store on Zhoujiazui to complain. Her brother, after hearing the news, rushed to report to the police and asked them to investigate.</p>

<p>Should Be Given to Orphaned Daughter for Living Expenses</p>
<p>Wang Jiashun, a native of Fenghua, Ningbo, who lived at No. 1673 East Seward Road and ran a carpentry shop, was 53 years old. His wife, Zhang, was 45 years old. Their son, Xingbao, 16 years old, was hacked to death by a clansman, Wang Songfa, with an axe on the evening of the 5th of this month. The murderer is on the run. The details of the autopsy of Wang Jiashun and others, which was conducted by Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special District Court at the Philander Road Autopsy Center the other day, have been reported in this newspaper. However, two savings slips from the Siming Bank and the Hongkou Shanghai Bank were found by Wang Zhang's body. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin claimed in Gao's court that the family members of the deceased, Wang Shaoyan and Wang A'jia, were present in court today, requesting that the 1,000 yuan of deposits found from the body of Wang Zhang in the Siming Bank be given to them to be collected. The Hongkou Shanghai Bank only had the envelope of the savings slip, and the savings slip itself was lost. The amount is unknown. The savings documents of the two banks were presented for inspection. Then, Wang Shaoyan reported that Wang Zhang was his aunt. He worked at the Shanghai Electric Power Company at No. 801 Kunming Road. The deposits were probably saved recently. Now, because the deceased's family needs the money for funeral expenses and all other expenses, he requested that an order be given to the bank to collect the money. Wang A'jia also claimed that the deceased Wang Jiashun was his younger brother, and he agreed with Shaoyan's statement.

<p>Zheng Guozhi, a native of Chaozhou, 44 years old, lives at No. 30 Hehefang, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, and is the manager of the newly established Youlian Wireless Electric Appliance Company at No. 241 Avenue Joffre. At 4:00 PM yesterday, Zheng took a check for 580 yuan from a friend to the Avenue Joffre branch of the Bank of China to cash it. A clerk, Jin, immediately paid the full amount. Unexpectedly, Zheng was eager to hold the money and left in a hurry, leaving a 100 yuan bill on the counter. Fortunately, a clerk of the bank, Gu, saw it and saved it. It was not until Zheng returned home that he realized it. He was afraid that he had lost it on the way and returned to the bank to inquire.

<h3 id="e136">Bank Teaboy Steals More Than 3,000 Yuan <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Song Yexi, a native of Anhui, 18 years old this year, works as a teaboy at the China Industrial Bank at No. 563 Avenue Dubail. On October 9th, taking advantage of the cashier of the cashier's office being on leave and Kong Bingjun being assigned to replace him, he secretly made a key, opened the writing desk drawer, stole the key to the silver box, opened the box, and stole 3,800 yuan in cash to spend. The next day, Kong found out and reported it to the police for investigation, but the case was not solved. On the 24th of this month, Song deposited 230 yuan in the Jincheng Bank in the name of Shaolinji. All the remaining money was lost in gambling with friends. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 22nd of last month, he stole a check for 105 yuan from the bank's manager, Sun Yangnong, and took it to the head office on Beijing Road to collect the money. The clerk noticed that the amount on the check was written as 105 yuan, but after checking the handwriting, it was different from Sun's. He then telegraphed Sun Yangnong, who replied that he had not issued the check and asked him to stop the payment and return the check. However, they did not yet know that Song had done it. Song took back the check and fled home in a guilty conscience. The bank then reported the incident to the police and asked them to investigate. Detective Mao Jinsheng and Detective Bao Jiang Changwen found out that both cases were committed by Song in collusion with his colleague Jian Shunrong. They knew that Song was hiding in his home at No. 18 Diandang Lane, Wansheng Bridge, Ximen, Huajie, and immediately dispatched detectives from the Public Security Bureau to go there together. Song and Jian were arrested, as well as Song's father, Song Hailin, and the secretly made keys and the Jincheng Bank passbook were seized. It was found that only 80 yuan was left, and the rest had been withdrawn. However, the check had been torn up and could not be retrieved. They were taken back to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the facts of the case. The plaintiff, Kong Bingjun, and Sun Yangnong (represented by his younger brother Yao Dong), recounted the circumstances of the theft. When interrogated, Song Yexi confessed to the theft. Jian and Song's father denied collusion. Judge Xiong pushed for a postponement of the continued trial. The two defendants, Song and Jian, were detained. Song Hailin was released on bail to be available at any time. With no bail, he was detained.</p>

<p>Liu Dengkuan, a native of Fujian, works for a living, and his income is very small, but he is addicted to gambling. His wife, Wang Maotou's clothes and other items have all been pawned. On September 29th of this year, according to the old calendar, Liu Dengkuan was being pursued by his creditors, forcing his wife to borrow money from her biological mother. When she could not comply, he used a wooden stick to injure her knees and waist. The case was reported to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. Now, Wang, unable to bear the abuse, has specially commissioned lawyer Chen Bingxing to file a petition with the First Special District Court, requesting mediation for divorce. Yesterday was the date for the mediation hearing. Both parties were present. First, Wang claimed that since marrying Liu, she had been beaten on the second day of the wedding. His monthly income was very small, and he was addicted to gambling. He had even sold the mattress he slept on as gambling capital. Once, he even pawned his daily pants, so he could not go out all day. Recently, he severely beat her again. Because of this, she could not bear the suffering and requested a divorce. According to Liu Dengkuan's statement, my wife often returned to Ningbo, and I repeatedly advised her not to listen and scolded her as a warning. If I find out that she does not return to her mother's house in the future, I will not beat her again. Wang claimed that Liu was cruel by nature and it was really unbearable to live with him. For this reason, she was determined to divorce. The judge believed that the relationship between the two parties had broken down deeply and mediation was not possible. He ordered that another lawsuit be filed.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Teahouse Employee Killed in Car Accident <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The British architectural engineer Teftuff (transliteration), who lives at No. 257 Rue Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession, was driving his private car No. 11778 east along Avenue Joffre at 10:35 AM on the 6th of this month. When he drove to the front of the teahouse at No. 1176, Wu A'si, a 47-year-old employee of the teahouse from Tongzhou, was holding something in his hand and crossing the road from north to south. The car could not avoid him and knocked Wu down, injuring his head. He passed out at the time. Hua Pu No. 257 and Western Pu No. 158 saw it and stepped forward to wake him up, record the number, and send Wu to Renji Hospital. At the same time, they returned to the police station to report to the police chief for verification. Wu died of his injuries on the morning of the 7th. The body was taken to the autopsy center of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Yesterday morning, the traffic department reported to Prosecutor Ding Shikui of the Second Special District Court and medical examiners.</p>
<p>After examining the body, they sat in the court and questioned the defendant and the Chinese and Western patrols about the accident. According to the deceased's wife, Wu Jinshi, her husband was tragically killed in the accident. There were three old and young people in the family and they were very poor. They had no way to rely on and requested a compensation of 1,000 yuan. The official mediated for them and ordered the defendant to first fill out the coffin and burial expenses. The defendant only agreed to give 200 yuan. To solve everything, because the gap between the two sides was too large, the mediation failed. Ding then ordered that Wu A'si was indeed killed by the collision, and the body was allowed to be collected by Wu Jinshi. The defendant was taken back to the police station for interrogation according to law.</p>

<p>Fang Jiaobo: Fang Jiaobo, a standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese Association, sent a letter to the association yesterday, saying: "To the esteemed association, this association is formed by people from all walks of life in the city and holds an important position. Since taking office as a standing committee member, I have been diligent day and night, never daring to slack off. Recently, the association's affairs have intensified, and the work has become frequent. Internally and externally, only competent individuals can shoulder this heavy responsibility. I consider myself mediocre and foolish, and it is impossible to be up to the task. If I were to carry out my duties perfunctorily, I would not be able to face the public. If I were to strive to make progress, I would feel that my talent and wisdom are insufficient. If I were to merely hold a false title, it would only delay the association's affairs and betray the trust placed in me. After repeated deliberation, I have no choice but to resign from my position as an executive committee member and all concurrent positions, so that the association can select talented individuals to actively advance the cause. Jiaobo will still, in my individual capacity, follow behind you all and participate in the patriotic movement. If it is within my ability, I will never shirk my responsibility. I hope that this resignation can be brought up in a meeting and approved. I am deeply grateful. This is addressed to the Executive Committee of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association."</p>
<p>Feng Shaoquan: Mr. Feng Shaoquan, an executive committee member and deputy director of the custody department of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of all circles in this city, has been diligently fulfilling his duties since taking office. Recently, due to his weak health, he is unable to cope with the heavy workload. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Standing Committee of the Association, requesting to resign from his concurrent position in the custody department. The original letter is reproduced below: "To the esteemed association, I, Shaoquan, with my meager talents, was elected as an executive committee member of this association, and I already felt that I was not up to the task. Then, the esteemed association showed me even greater favor by additionally promoting me to serve as the deputy director of the custody department. I felt even more ashamed. However, at this time of national crisis, anti-Japanese work is a duty that every citizen should fulfill. Therefore, I also knew that I was not talented enough, but I rashly took on the responsibility. However, in the past few months, although I have exhausted my mind and wisdom, I have not achieved any results. I have truly failed to live up to the trust placed in me by the esteemed association, and I feel deeply ashamed. Recently, my health has deteriorated, and I am even less able to cope with the heavy workload. Therefore, I am specifically stating the reasons and sincerely requesting that you select other talented individuals and approve my resignation from the positions of deputy director and acting director of the custody department. In addition to instructing the general secretary to handle the handover, I will not be responsible for any departmental affairs from the eighth day of this month. My request is sincere and unavoidable. I hope that the esteemed association will approve it. I am deeply grateful. This is addressed to the Standing Committee."</p>

Moreover, we have always trusted your company's domestic cigarettes. Since the occurrence of the case, we have already refused to use enemy goods for raw materials and printing.

Discerning people can tell the truth without debate. In addition to expressing our understanding whenever industry members inquire about the above matters to provide proof, we hereby reply to your letter for your information."</p>

<p>Many readers have sent letters asking about military training methods, and some have expressed their opinions on military training. A certain military expert in Beiping has a very concise and essential talk, which is specially introduced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Military training can be divided into three groups: 1. High school and university students; 2. Young people in industry and commerce who are willing to receive training; 3. Demarcate areas with clear household registration surveys and pilot conscription. The first and second groups should aim to complete one year of training. In a place like Beiping, it is possible to pilot conscription of 5,000 people. If it continues for two years, 20,000 elite soldiers can be obtained.</p>
<p>(2) School military training should be conducted for two hours a day and should be continuous and uninterrupted. Morning training is not as good as evening training. Evening exercises can practice night combat. Training in the field is better than on the training ground. It is best to study during the day and drill in the evening.</p>
<p>(3) It is not necessary to use guns during training. It is a big mistake to say that training cannot be done without guns. In ordinary combat, artillery is used beyond 600 meters, and rifles are used above 300 meters and below 600 meters. The effectiveness of rifles is very small. During the European War, in addition to artillery, the final victory or defeat was determined entirely in a melee. If you can train your body well and use knives and guns, and the short blades are connected, if I stab the enemy to death and the enemy stabs me only to injure me, then I win. Do not say that there may not be many rifles in the future, even if there are guns, they may not all be available. Therefore, the emphasis is on learning fighting skills and training the body. Actions must be agile and strong. This level of relationship is very important.</p>
<p>(4) Moreover, the most taboo is to use rifles in night combat. The sound of the gun is tantamount to telling the enemy where you are. Therefore, melee combat is mostly at night, but mostly not in the wild. At this time, student training must be in the evening, not only for time economy (does not hinder reading), but also to train eyesight (the more you practice at night, the clearer your eyes will be). In the future, when a real war starts, the enemy has artillery and aircraft, and we cannot resist, but when the two armies are close, having melee skills is enough to make the enemy's artillery, aircraft, and rifles completely lose their effectiveness.</p>
<p>(5) Not only is outdoor training very important, but it is also very important to train hard in heavy fog and heavy rain. Students who aspire to save the country, if they cannot endure such hardship, then there is no hope. People who run military training also have no hope if they do not understand this.</p>
<p>(6) Therefore, the best way to run military training now is to run it "alive", not "dead". It takes a lot of effort to run it dead, and it may not be pleasing. Running it alive can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(7) The general habit of students now is to like listening to military science courses. This is a sign of laziness. Military science is what military officers need, not what soldiers need. The purpose of military training is first to cultivate the majority of good soldiers, and second to cultivate good junior officers. If everyone wants to be a military officer, then military training will definitely fail.</p>

<p>The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 pm yesterday stated that the Yangtze River basin and the coast here will have heavy fog or drizzle, and localized thunderstorms. The Shandong coast will have overcast and rainy weather. The whirlwind in this area is intensifying due to the passage of a low pressure system, which is moving towards the east-northeast or northeast. The wind in the Yellow Sea has no fixed direction, and the southeast wind in the East China Sea is quite strong. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 pm yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 63.3 degrees and the lowest was 54.9 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 53.2 degrees and the lowest was 48.9 degrees.</p>

<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. The Qing court ordered Li Hongzhang to negotiate peace with Japan. Indemnities and cessions were a great national humiliation. The place of the peace talks was the Shunpanro restaurant in Shimonoseki, Japan. Therefore, it was named the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Wu Zhiqi, a literary giant from Tongcheng, traveled to Japan and happened to pass by the place. He then inscribed a plaque on the Shunpanro: "Place of Sadness." General Wu Baochu, father of the poet Wu Yanfu, also wrote a poem: "Ten thousand acres of clouds stand on the beach. The sea breeze is vast and the white gulls are leisurely. The boatman does not know the place of sadness. He only points to the future, which is Shimonoseki." Now, the violent Japanese invade the border. The three northeastern provinces have fallen into the land trampled by the Japanese slaves. How can the sadness be greater than this? Alas.</p>

<p>One of the Apprentice Biographies</p>
<p>Franklin himself and his young son flew that immortal kite in Philadelphia in June of the following year, 1752. This kite is worth describing. Most people only know that Franklin flying a kite was the first time humans took electricity from the sky to the ground, but in fact, this was the second time. The pioneers who took electricity from the sky were Darbari and De Law, and Franklin was their commander-in-chief. Flying a kite was Franklin's personal battle against the sky. Franklin's kite itself was made of a wooden frame and silk: a sharp metal wire was inserted into the wooden frame, and a copper key and a ribbon were tied to the lower end of the double-strand rope. The kite was put into the clouds, and the hand held the ribbon and stood in the doorway to prevent the ribbon from getting wet from the rain. Soon, the loose yarn of the double-strand rope stood up angrily like a wild boar's thorn, the fingers could attract each other, and the finger bones touched the key and sparks flew. He also led the lightning down and stored it in the Leyden jar, proving that its operation was no different from frictional electricity. According to modern electrical theory, Franklin was too close to the copper key while holding the ribbon and would have been electrocuted to death. To do this experiment, people have to be far away. Fourteen months later, a physicist in St. Petersburg, Russia, used an iron rod to take electricity from the sky. He was electrocuted to death by a ball of blue fire when he approached the electrometer. The reason why Franklin did not die was probably because there was only a small amount of lightning on the day he flew the kite. He was truly lucky! Otherwise, Franklin would have sacrificed his life for science.</p>
<p>Franklin was a versatile man. He only had nine years of scientific research, and he contributed to the world with stoves, lightning rods, ether light wave theory, magnetic copper plate printing, printing presses, bifocal glasses, alarm clocks, and his electrical theory. According to himself, his experiments benefited a lot from the craft visits during his apprenticeship. This kind of intimate craft visit for choosing a career was a major invention of his father, a candle and soap maker, in children's education. (The end) (This time, because there was too much to say about national affairs, this biography was interrupted for a long time, and I am deeply sorry.)</p>

<p>— Wang Maichang</p>
<p>Jian Dashi was a native of Taiwan. Or it is said that he was a native of Fujian who lived in Taiwan. He and his younger brother, Dadu, were both known for their chivalry and courage. He could understand the great meaning by reading and admired the theory of equality. He bowed and yielded even to the common people, as if they were honored guests. He especially liked to talk about loyalty and righteousness. He was born in the age of uncle, and he painfully felt the urgency of foreign insults. He often lamented and could not help himself. Looking around, he wept generously and wanted to die for the country. He once traveled to Xiamen and saw a Westerner bullying and humiliating our people. Some people stood by and watched with smug expressions. Dashi stepped forward and slapped his cheek, saying, "Why are you unaware and sigh at the humiliation of your compatriots?" He faced the Westerner with an iron face. The Westerner was shocked and quickly ran away. In the twenty-first year of Guangxu, we ceded Taiwan to the Japanese. Dashi was furious, almost mad. He vowed not to yield to the Japanese. He and Dadu destroyed their homes and recruited warriors, forming an army. After a year of hard fighting, they were finally defeated. They fled to Quanzhou. The Japanese feared him and coerced our officials to demand him urgently. The officials captured him. He cried and said, "What crime have I committed to die? Even if I am guilty, I will die by the laws of the country. I will not hate death. Why do you want to give me to the thieves to kill me? My eyes will never close." The officials gave him to the Japanese after all. The Japanese respected his righteousness and called him a martyr. They wanted to surrender him. Dashi glared and cursed loudly, his hair standing on end. He finally died unyielding. A month after his death, Dadu regrouped the remnants and fought against the Japanese. He was also defeated and died.</p>
<p>The unofficial historian said: "How heroic are the two Jian brothers! In a place where there was nothing that could be done, they knew that it could not be done but still did it to the end. Although their bodies are dead, their spirit of loyalty and righteousness should be rubbed between the two worlds and cannot be extinguished for thousands of years. Later, there will inevitably be those who hear their name and rise up. Then, although their bodies are dead, they may not die. Although the country is destroyed, it may not be destroyed. However, now there are places where things can be done, times when things can be done, but why are they not done? As I write about the two Jian brothers, I cannot help but feel my blood boiling and my hair standing on end. Alas."</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Unheard of Super Cat Recently, a very interesting piece of news has been spreading in the world's scientific community. It is that Soviet scientists are studying diligently, wanting to make a domestic animal that can combine the best qualities of sheep, goats, and cows. If this matter can be successfully tested, then it will be easier to mix the worst qualities of the three animals together. However, grafting has been done in the plant world, which is no longer new. Even in the animal world, new species are sometimes discovered. A doctor in Paris is engaged in the study of rats. In order to eliminate rats, he has specially raised a super cat that is larger and more ferocious than ordinary cats. It can kill a large number of rats within a specified time. This matter has now been successfully tested. However, according to some people, this super cat should not be promoted. Ordinary cats already contain a trace of wildness. When wildness breaks out, it is very scary. If a super cat is raised, then it will not only kill a large number of rats, but may also be harmful to humans.</p>

<p>— Bi Bo</p>
<p>With a mere few thousand Japanese pirates, they extinguished our Liaoning and Jilin in an instant. Two hundred thousand troops retreated to preserve their strength, a move called non-resistance, hoping for pity from imperialists. Alas, this shame! I fear such a record is without precedent in history, ancient or modern.</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, understanding his responsibility to defend the territory, vowed to resist to the death and defend Heilongjiang Province. With a single division, though morale was high, it was bound to be defeated against such a strong enemy. Indeed, in less than half a month, it was reported that he abandoned Heihe due to exhausted ammunition and lack of reinforcements. Upon hearing this, the people could not help but weep blood and wring their hearts. Young patriots, unable to bear the demise of their motherland, gathered comrades, numbering several hundred, determined to go to Heihe to assist the isolated army and bring glory to the nation. On the afternoon of the sixth, they held a farewell meeting at the North Station, asking a friend to film a commemorative video for posterity. The speeches at the time were so poignant that everyone wept uncontrollably. Those who donated to help were only common people. The amount was so meager that it was difficult to sustain. I truly do not know if the wealthy can live peacefully after the country is destroyed and the family ruined.</p>
<p>As the brave men bid a heroic farewell, blowing their horns and boarding the train, my heart was heavy. The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. Ashamed of my cowardice, I could not sacrifice myself to follow them, merely offering a pittance. This is hardly enough to atone for my sin of fearing death.</p>
<p>However, those dear compatriots who vowed to die together are all empty-handed, some wearing only thin clothes. The bitter cold of the north will surely cause them to die of cold before they die in battle. This is lamentable! I now respectfully ask all enthusiastic people to actively contribute to these hundreds of enlightened compatriots who are sacrificing themselves for the country, in order to fulfill their loyal and courageous aspirations. My wish is not extravagant, but to contribute what you can.</p>
<p>In the evening, I returned home and told my family what I had seen. My wife and children were moved to tears and offered the earnings from their needlework, asking me to pass them on for assistance. I believe that once this article is published, all those with a conscience will surely be willing to economize on food and clothing to provide a steady stream of aid.</p>
<p>Alas! As I write this article, my heart aches, my tears are dry. My body is still here, but my soul has already gone with those patriotic comrades.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Records of What I Saw and Heard in the Old Capital <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>The Yangshi Lei Family</p>
<p>In the seventh year of the Republic of China, Zhu Qiqian, as an envoy to Nanjing, saw a manuscript in the library titled "Yingzao Fashi" written by Li Jie of the Song Dynasty. He immediately took it and praised it, and had it printed. Thus, people gradually began to learn that our country had such an architectural scholar eight hundred years ago, who bequeathed to posterity engineering methods that had never been written down in books. Although the Northern Song Dynasty, when Li Jie lived, was already an era of decline in architecture, the styles inherited from the Song and Ming dynasties could still be traced back to their origins, making it an extremely valuable document. Later, because the images in the book were incomplete and insufficient to provide proof, he extensively searched for the two existing copies in the Siku Quanshu, compared and supplemented them. He entrusted Tao Xiang and Guo Baochang to manage the matter, and in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, a large-character version with meticulous revisions was published. The colors in the colored illustrations were superimposed and blended, fresh and dazzling. It is now sold by the Commercial Press, priced at more than seventy yuan. Zhu Qiqian studied ancient and modern architecture for decades. In the early years of the Republic of China, many new buildings in Beijing, such as Zhengyangmen, the Wenhua and Wuying Halls, and Zhongshan Park, were all designed by Zhu Qiqian, blending the old and the new, all with elegant designs, praised by Chinese and foreigners alike. To this day, Zhu Qiqian is credited with giving Beiping the scale of a modern capital. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, Zhu Qiqian exhibited the drawings and models he had collected over the years at Zhongshan Park. The following year, with the support of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, he established the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture in Beiping, publishing a quarterly journal four times a year and holding exhibitions of achievements from time to time. The most interesting was the exhibition of Yuanmingyuan relics held in March of the twentieth year. The motivation for this exhibition was the joint purchase of Yangshi Lei models with the Beiping Library in the nineteenth year. The Yangshi Lei family were hereditary engineers who undertook the construction of palaces and mausoleums. Major national projects had to be obtained from them, so their family had thousands of drawings of major projects since the Jiaqing and Daoguang eras. When Zhu Qiqian was Minister of the Interior, he heard of their name and sought them out. The Lei family avoided meeting him. In recent years, forced by livelihood, they began to peddle their treasures everywhere. The treasures accumulated over generations were in danger of being scattered. Therefore, the Beiping Library spent money to buy them all, costing about six or seven thousand yuan. Among them, there were more than 1,800 drawings and 18 models related to the Yuanmingyuan. This matter caused a sensation for a time, and scholars were eager to see them first. Among the Yuanmingyuan documents, the most noteworthy to Chinese and foreigners are the twenty drawings of the waterworks of the Xiyang Lou in the Harmonious Wonder Garden. These drawings are Qianlong copperplate prints. The existing ones are stored in the Beiping Palace Museum and the Rehe Imperial Palaces in Liaoning. The original prints collected by old families in Beiping are consistent with the images in the "Study of the Beijing Imperial Palace" by Siren and the "Complete Collection of World Art in Japan." Compared with the current state of ruins, it is even more unbearable to witness. Seventy years have passed since the Yuanmingyuan was destroyed. Those who have seen its heyday are almost non-existent. Therefore, the fact that the garden extensively adopted Western architecture is hardly known. Those who wrote travelogues and poems in the past did not pay much attention to this. Recently, scholars have combined Chinese and Western records and determined that Westerners participated in determining the drawings at that time. Alas, wild grasses in the setting sun, broken tiles and scattered beams. How much blood and tears of our ancestors are stored in this place! How can posterity not keep this in mind and use it as a warning?</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Expenses of Charlie Chaplin's Sons <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ming</p>
<p>A report from Lita Grey Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin's ex-wife, has recently been submitted to the court, indicating that the expenses for Charlie Chaplin's two sons last year seem to have decreased slightly compared to the previous year. His two sons are named Charles Chaplin Jr., who is nine years old this year, and Sydney, who is eight years old this year. When the comedic star divorced his ex-wife, he agreed to pay each son $6,000 in annual education and upbringing expenses.</p>
<p>For the past year, ending at the end of September, Charles Chaplin Jr. spent a total of $3,676, and Sydney spent a total of $3,509. These amounts include a monthly accommodation fee of $200 and the wages of a nanny. In the previous year, Charles Chaplin Jr. spent $3,619, and Sydney spent $3,638. Comparatively, the expenses have slightly decreased.</p>
<p>Currently, Charles Chaplin Jr. has accumulated $8,730 from his education and upbringing expenses, while Sydney has $8,886. The two brothers each wear five pairs of leather shoes a year, priced from $1.25 to $8. The older brother's total shoe expenses for the year were $26, while the younger brother's were $24. As for clothing, Charles Chaplin Jr.'s expenses were $528, while Sydney's were $540.</p>
<p>Charles Chaplin Jr.'s toys were only worth $1.20, which is rare among children. His expenses were mostly used for medical care, nursing, and miscellaneous expenses.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter One: The Drums of Yuyang</p>
<p>The troops of the Land of the Rising Sun rushed to the school gate, preparing for resistance from the students. They first set up two machine guns and then shouted loudly, bursting in. At this moment, it was as if a large gang of robbers had arrived, searching in all directions. They quickly arrested Principal Xiong Feng and sent him to their headquarters. Most of the students had already hidden. A few were taken prisoner. Two Rising Sun soldiers rushed to the girls' dormitory to search, like hunting dogs, eager to devour. At this moment, in dormitory number ten, there was a girl, about twenty years old, her delicate jade face flushed with a pale color. She was tightly barricading the door with tables and chairs. But the cunning Rising Sun soldiers seemed to already know that their target was inside. They hurriedly knocked on the door with their gun butts. After a few blows, the door collapsed. Two Rising Sun soldiers jumped into the room from the tables, looking at the girl cowering in a corner. They couldn't help but reveal a smug look on their faces, walking towards the girl, speaking in Chinese: "Little girl, don't panic. We are here to protect you. As long as you are agreeable and can give us some fun, we guarantee your life will be safe." Saying that, they moved closer step by step. The girl was like a fawn waiting to die, about to meet the ravenous mouths of tigers and wolves, and the two Rising Sun soldiers were like two devils, opening their bloody mouths, wanting to swallow this flower-like and jade-like female student. But at this critical moment for the girl, with no chance of escape, her panicked expression suddenly turned into a stern attitude. Her body no longer retreated, standing upright, her eyes wide open, scolding them, "Dogs! Inhuman bandits! I would rather die! Who dares to violate me!" As she spoke, she had an air of inviolability. One of the Rising Sun soldiers was somewhat stunned to see her like this. But the other Rising Sun soldier grinned evilly. "Good. You're cursing people. You want to die? I won't let you die." As he spoke, he pounced on the girl, wanting to grab her. The girl had no defense. Coincidentally, there was an ink bottle on the windowsill behind her. The girl quickly grabbed it in her hand and threw it at the Rising Sun soldier's face, hitting his nose directly, breaking his nose and causing blood to flow, splashing his face with ink. He couldn't help but become enraged. He raised his pistol, wanting to shoot the girl. Just then, with a bang, a figure fell backward.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Financial Gold Prices Rebound Higher <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Disordered Steps Eventually Settle at a Gain of 9.5 Taels Yesterday's gold market saw dramatic changes, with prices rising and falling in a chaotic and turbulent manner, fluctuating by large amounts. There were a total of twenty-three or four taels of highs and lows throughout the day. Dealers' sentiment remained firm, moving quickly. At the end of the day, prices rebounded by over nine taels. This was a reversal after many days of decline. Demand was strong in the market. The market opened lower, as the silver market continued to rise, breaking through 680 taels. Later, large speculators and short sellers entered the market, and bulls took advantage of this to add positions, pushing the price up by ten taels. Foreign exchange rates showed a tendency for the British pound to strengthen and the US dollar to weaken, suggesting a further decline in exchange rates. There were more sellers at noon, but the market weakened. The forward market seemed to show profits, and various firms, such as Da Xing, Yong Qian, Chang Xiang, and Heng Xing, vigorously competed to buy, creating a positive atmosphere. The price even broke through the 700-tael mark before slightly retreating, allowing bulls to take profits.</p>
<p>Opening Lower by 9.8 Mace The market opened lower by 9.8 mace at 678 taels (before the opening, the price had been around 680 taels). Large silver bars surprisingly rose by 0.875, and silver prices rose by more than 0.1. Subsequently, Yuan Mao, Cui Chang, Xiang Heng, Yu Lai, and others entered the market, immediately rising by more than 5 taels to 683.5 taels. Shortly after, Cheng Feng and Yong Heng Xing entered and then exited. Yuan Da, Yong Yi, Feng Yu, Da Heng Chang, Yong Qian Chang, Xiang Tong Tai Chang, and others all sold. In addition, the British Gold Bank bought at 2 shillings and 0.125 pence, and the US dollar initially absorbed at 32.75 yuan and then sold at 33.125 yuan. This was due to the Dalian gang closing positions, causing the gold price to fall by six or seven taels, suddenly to 677 taels around 9:30. In a flash, it rebounded by three taels, with quoted prices increasing by three ticks. British gold was at 75, and the US dollar only increased by 0.5 yuan, so it retreated from 680.05 taels to 679.5 taels. HSBC absorbed January US dollars at 33 yuan and then exited at 32.875 yuan. Shortly after, British gold also performed well, with Hua Ji and others exiting at 32.875 yuan. Buying interest was strong on the floor. Heng Chang Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Heng Xing Da Xing, Yong Fu Yu, Tong Tai Chang Wu, and others all bought, so the price jumped by seven or eight taels, but only in small amounts. After 10 o'clock, the US dollar strengthened further, with Hua Bank buying at 32.6875 yuan. Then, at 10:30, it rose to 687.5 taels. Yi Feng and others sold, retreating to 684 taels. Shortly after, it pulled up by two or three taels, reaching 686.8 taels at 11:00. Retail investors bought. After that, the trend seemed to weaken. Yuan Mao Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Wu Pin, and others came to sell. The US dollar also returned to 32.75 yuan to settle, with the Bombay telegram adding 6 annas. At noon, it was 683.6 taels, then another 1.2 mace was added. Then, the market closed at 684 taels. At this time, news suddenly spread that Japan had suffered a volcanic eruption, immediately cutting back three taels to around 681 taels. The quoted price was changed to 756 taels, pressing about 70 taels.</p>
<p>Reaching 700 Taels Once The market opened in the afternoon at only 681.2 mace, which was the residual momentum from the noon closing. However, there were few transactions at this price, and it immediately turned higher. Zhi Feng Yong Heng Yu, Qian Chang Xiang, Da Xing, Yong Cheng Feng, Yong Heng Xing, Xie Xing Yong, and others surged in. The British Gold Bank also did mutual trades at 2 shillings and 1.125 pence. Following this, the British gold was at 11 pence 9375, and the US dollar HSBC absorbed at 32.6875 yuan and then exited at 32.625 yuan. Thus, the gold price soared, rising sharply by more than 10 taels, with occasional pullbacks of one or two taels. At nearly 3 o'clock, it was 693 taels. Not long after, it retreated to 689.8 mace, as retail investors came to sell. After 3:15, Heng Xing Fu Yu, Yi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Xiang Feng, and others chased in. At 3:30, it was 694 taels. Suddenly, news came from Bombay of a large increase of 1 anna, and 3 annas for the forward market, retreating 3 taels. At 4 o'clock, it was 690.08 mace. Afterward, the US dollar was traded against 32.625 yuan. Those who wanted to buy were quoted at 0.5 yuan, but it was difficult to settle, only expensive. The British gold was at 11 pence 875, and the trend was still strong. Buyers on the floor surged in. Heng Xing Fu Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, and others all competed to buy. In an instant, there was a surge of 10 taels, reaching 700.005 taels at 4:20, which was unexpected. The amount was very lacking, and the shorts were squeezed.

<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all rose, and the market was firm. However, the decline in exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar has not stopped, both at 3.2575 yuan. Therefore, HSBC quoted prices increased by three ticks, quoting British gold at 0.75, for 1 shilling and 11.5 pence. The US dollar only increased by 0.5 yuan, at 31.75 yuan. Hong Kong added 0.125, at 76.5 taels, and the rest were increased. It was initially loose and then stabilized internally. It weakened again at noon and then suddenly turned strong in the afternoon. However, compared to the previous day, British gold increased by 4.375, while the US dollar was flat, still due to exchange rate squeezes. As for the gold market, it was initially weak and then strong, once breaking through the 700-tael mark, which was due to the bulls pushing up the price. However, the situation was extremely chaotic. In the afternoon, news came that the Hong Kong market was firm. However, the British and American exchange rates were not as high. Merchants from Jin and Hua mostly sold, but Guangdong merchants were bullish, and Dalian merchants also bought slightly. Gold merchants mostly hedged. It is estimated that over 200,000 pounds of British gold and 700,000 to 800,000 yuan of US dollars were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Large Silver Bars Re-emerge Above the 20-Pence Mark <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram from London yesterday, large silver bars have increased several times, all breaking out of the 20-pence mark. The near-term bar increased sharply by 0.875, to 20.5 pence, and the forward bar also increased by 0.875, to 20.6875 pence. Spot speculators bought slightly, and there were few transactions. The market calmed after the market closed due to demand exceeding supply. A telegram from New York said that the US silver price also rose sharply by 0.1, with the spot price at 300 yuan. British pound to US dollar fell by 0.05, and US dollar to British pound decreased by 0.0475, both at 3.2575 yuan. The London-Shanghai exchange rate increased by 0.0625, to 2 shillings. The Bombay spot price increased by 1 rupee and 12 annas, to 63 rupees and 08 annas. The forward price also increased by 28 annas, to 63 rupees and 28 annas.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Changes in Silver Prices and Exchange Rates <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Since September 21st, the Shanghai exchange market has presented a new atmosphere, and the value of currency has changed suddenly. The increase in silver prices and British pounds has been affected by the UK's abolition of the gold standard. However, the rise in silver prices and the US dollar is more complex. The future changes will be a major issue for us to pay attention to. Before September 21st of this year, the New York silver market price was consistently around 27.75 cents per ounce. After the news of the UK's abolition of the gold standard spread to the New World, it suddenly rose to 29.25 cents. Most speculators bought large amounts of raw silver, hoping that the UK would restore the complex standard system. Therefore, in four days, it rose to 31 cents. The local silver price and US dollar also rose accordingly. However, the facts were the opposite. The UK did not need raw silver, and the decline resumed, falling to 27.25 cents, which was weaker than the market price before September 21st. The comparison between silver and the US dollar is based on the high and low of the New York silver market price. However, after mid-October, it reversed and there was no correct way to find it. Raw silver speculators shifted their focus and no longer paid attention to the comparison between gold and silver. In the first week of November, raw silver trading became more frequent. According to general speculation, the United States and countries related to the East are fighting for the international silver market. Therefore, the amount of transactions broke the silver market record in recent years. In the days from October 29th to November 10th, the price of raw silver rose by a quarter. However, the comparison between the US dollar and silver did not rise sharply. After the reaction started, the strength of the decline was the same as the rise. Therefore, in the eight days from November 10th, the price of October 29th was restored, which was close to the price before September 21st. Therefore, the comparison between the US dollar and silver also fell to the same level as before the rise. When the price of silver and other countries' currencies is higher, most people exchange silver coins for gold coins from other countries. However, the savings of banks in Shanghai and other ports remain the same. In mid-October, there was a high price. Shanghai is the trade center of the country and the only port for foreign trade. The amount of goods imported and exported is very huge. Therefore, this silver price change and its financial independence have little impact. Recently, Shanghai has repeatedly transported huge amounts of silver to various places and has pre-shipped the full amount of silver before the port closes, in order to adjust the winter finances of northern China. In short, Shanghai is a major industrial and commercial port, and its greatness will not change due to external influences.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Decline After the Rise of Li Chai <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market was stagnant and the news was dull. The various market prices were generally weak. Although there was no precise exploration of the inside story, knowing that its appearance was so, there was indeed the possibility of activity. Checking the silver root the day before yesterday, it still recovered and tightened immediately, because the tightness and looseness of the market had no major problems for the actual situation. The market situation experienced yesterday is divided as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Li The morning market price was 7 cents, 2 cents, 4 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, and 5 si, the same as the day before. The noon market suddenly decreased by 0.8 hao, 7 hu, and 5 si, to 7 cents, 2 cents, 3 li, and 5 hao. The morning market turnover of foreign exchange was 1,225,000, and the noon market was 845,000. The morning market turnover of banknotes was 45,000, and the noon market was 30,000. The morning market turnover of banknotes outside the market was 140,000 and the noon market was 100,200. The morning market turnover of bank trading was 800,000, and the noon market turnover was 500,000. The turnover of small money houses was over 600,000.</p>
<p>Silver Chai The silver root in the morning market was more relaxed than the previous day. The silver chai price in the morning and noon markets was the same, 2 cents and 3 points, with a plus of 1 cent and 12 points, and the bank quoted price was 9 points. The number of transaction was less rare. The morning market turnover was over 1,900,000, new transactions were over 440,000, the noon market turnover was over 330,000, and the turnover in small associations was over 440,000.</p>
<p>Subsidiary coins The price of four-opening small foreign coins was 6 cents, 5 cents, and 3 li in the morning market, and 6 cents, 5 cents, 2 li, and 5 hao in the noon market. The morning market turnover was 245,000 jiao, and the noon market was 90,000 jiao. The price of eight-opening small foreign coins was 6 cents, 4 cents, and 5 li in the morning market, and 6 cents, 4 cents, and 6 li in the noon market. The morning market turnover was 7,000 jiao, and the noon market was 3,000 jiao. The exchange rate was 1,109 jiao and 3 points in the morning market, and 1,109 jiao and 2 points in the noon market. Copper coins were slightly less than 500 wen, for 378,500 wen, and 26,495 strings were traded, with the value of silver at 7,000 taels. The price of clothing cards was 2,742 wen in the morning market and 2,738 wen in the noon market. The price of Jiao Pi was the same in both markets, 247 wen, with a discount of 27 wen.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Securities Cutting Troops Rise by More Than Two Yuan <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Other Bonds Also Increase by About One and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Market Situation Still Quiet, One-Month Futures Still Without Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the bond market situation was as follows: one-month futures still had no trading activity, and December futures remained quite quiet. The enthusiasm of buyers and sellers was still sporadic. Spot trading continued to be lively, with various opening prices in the early and late markets. Regarding the price changes of various bonds, the market sentiment was slightly more optimistic due to stronger buying interest, while selling was relatively quiet. Therefore, when prices opened in the morning, they uniformly rebounded more vigorously than the previous day. The mid-day market was more stable, with prices fluctuating without significant ups and downs. The late market turned firm again, and various prices gradually trended upward. However, except for the Disbandment Bonds (裁兵), the gains of the remaining bonds were moderate. As a result, Disbandment Bonds rose by as much as two yuan and two jiao compared to the previous day, while 1929 Customs Consolidated Tax Bonds (一九關善統稅) and 1931 Customs Bonds (二○關捲), etc., each rose by about one and a half yuan. Salt Tax Consolidation Bonds (鹽稅編遣) rose by about one yuan, while Whole Six Customs Tax Bonds of 1896 (整六關稅九六) only rose by several jiao. However, spot prices for 1931 Customs Bonds (二○關) and 1929 Customs Bonds (一九關) continued to fall compared to the previous week. It is believed that the rebound in bond prices, although partly due to a slightly improved overall environment, was mainly due to the efforts of various parties to plan and maintain the market, leading to a wait-and-see attitude among sellers who were unwilling to sell. The stronger trend of Disbandment Bonds was probably due to the expectation of lottery-based principal repayment soon, which increased market demand for them. It is estimated that the total spot trading volume for the day was 23,000 yuan, with futures trading volume reaching over 1.6 million yuan in the morning and over 1.4 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling only 3.07 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, but the trend is still weak. The market rose slightly due to some profit-takers covering their short positions, causing the market atmosphere to tighten. However, the national situation is still precarious, and the violence in the Liaoning and Jilin areas is intensifying, causing continued panic. Actual sales are becoming increasingly sluggish, and all sectors lack vitality.</p>
<p>In the recent auction, one or two individuals bid well in the pre-market opening. Indian cotton tended to rise, with near-month contracts rising by 9 qian to 1 liang and 1 qian, and distant months remaining flat. In the afternoon, prices for various months rose or fell by 1 or 2 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 20,200 bales. Sales included 750 bales from Zhenda, 900 bales from Hengde, 700 bales from Yiyu, 550 bales from Taixing, 600 bales from Dafu, 1,250 bales from Changfeng, and 400 bales from Mingde.

<p>The cotton market is stable due to the sharp rise in Indian cotton prices, but the soaring silver prices have slightly offset the gains. The slight rise in the gold market has not boosted confidence significantly, so sellers are still selling at higher prices. Spot cotton mills have not yet taken any action, but traders from Hubei and other inland areas are bullish and are holding tight due to the poor harvests expected this year.</p>
<p>The Hubei cotton market rose by 1 or 2 qian. At the opening of the Hubei cotton market, American cotton was flat, but Indian cotton rose sharply, with prices for various months rising by 2 or 3 qian. Prices then fell as bullish traders closed their positions, resulting in a net increase of 5 fen to 2 qian. In the afternoon, prices for various months fell by 5 fen to 1 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 53,100 dan. Sales included 5,800 dan from Xincheng, 2,900 dan from Taixing, 2,600 dan from Changfeng, and 1,500 dan from Dachang. Purchases included 3,000 dan from Gongtai, 2,400 dan from Gengfeng, 600 dan each from Dachang No. 2, 1,500 dan from Tianlong, and 1,200 dan from Changfeng. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Nantou Yesterday, the weather was cloudy and humid, and there were few incoming boats. There were very few people at the market in the morning. The price of thick glutinous rice (厚新粳) continued to be firm and stable. The stock of thin early rice (薄早二稻) was also low. The sales of Ningwei rice and rice from this city were sluggish. The opening price rose by one jiao, but sales were flat due to the cloudy weather, with no gains or losses. Du Yang Jian (杜洋尖) rice was still in high demand, so the trend was firm but slightly soft. There was no stock of old damaged rice (陳破襲) available for sale.</p>
<p>Xinzha The price of local rice numbered 33 and 34 was rising due to the light rain in the morning. The price of Xinxin Hujiao (西新斛脚) was the highest, with prices similar to each other. Trading of Kunshan and Yixing white glutinous rice (崑山·宜興白粳) was the slowest, and the trend was decreasing. Qingjiao (靑角), Shibu (石浦), Songjiang (松江), and thin rice from village stores (鄉莊帮及店胃) saw slight movement, but the bidding was firm. According to reports from inland areas, the price trend of white rice was firm, but sales in Shanghai were limited, and the overall volume could not be too small. Yang Du Jian (洋杜尖) and glutinous rice were sluggish, showing a downward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Continued New Transactions in Foreign Rice Futures <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price of foreign rice remained firm because, in addition to ongoing local purchases, traders from Hankou also loaded several hundred bags of Xiaojiao rice (小絞). Therefore, although the futures price was lowered by foreign firms, the spot rice price was able to temporarily hold. The unified market opened with 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice at 11 yuan 2 jiao to 11 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, 1,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice at 10 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen and then at 9 yuan 8 jiao. Ke Xian (客秈) continued to open with 450 bags of newly arrived inferior rice from Wenzhou at 9 yuan 9 jiao to 9 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen. The opening price of four-month Saigon No. 1 rice futures was five taels and five qian for 200 tons. The new transaction was for 1,000 tons of January Xiaojiao rice, sold by Chengquanlong (誠全隆) at four taels and four qian five fen. Jardine Matheson also sold 1,000 tons of April rice at four taels and eight qian one fen. All were to be delivered through Yinghua (英華) and purchased by local traders.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Gradual Decrease in Flour Prices <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Continued Foreign Wheat Orders</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market continued to be weak. The quoted price of foreign wheat decreased by 1 or 2 jiao, and the market atmosphere became increasingly depressed. Although the current situation is as dangerous as ever, factories still seem to have some ambition. It was reported that the foreign wheat ordered the day before was priced at only three taels and seven qian. Yesterday, there was another order with an even cheaper price. Australian wheat shipped in January was priced at only three taels and six qian. With such gradual price drops, the factories' selling pressure naturally increased greatly, so confidence remained weak. The opening prices gradually decreased. It is observed that further price decreases are still difficult to avoid. As a result, the price for this month was 5 li lower than the previous day, January was 7.5 li lower, February was 5 li lower, March was 1.25 fen lower, April was 5 li lower, and May was 2.5 li lower.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Deteriorating Trend in the Wheat Market <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was generally weak. Due to poor flour sales, the wheat market was naturally hopeless. In addition, foreign wheat orders continued to be placed without regard for the national crisis. Following the orders placed by Fufu (福阜) factories the day before, another ship was ordered yesterday, with the price being only three taels and six qian, which is close to the domestic standard. Therefore, the majority of people's confidence was uniformly softened. Although the decrease was small, the trend deteriorated daily. As a result, the price for this month decreased by 5 fen compared to the previous day, January decreased by 3 fen, February decreased by 2 fen, March decreased by 3 fen, and April decreased by 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Sudden Rise in the Oil and Asphalt Market <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Oversold… Rebound Also Strong</p>
<p>The asphalt market rose too much between spring and summer, so the new goods were not seen and then the price fell sharply. However, the fall was also too much, so-called “when things reach an extreme, they revert.” The initial price of new goods of hemp oil from Macheng (麻城) of Hankou this time was only 15 taels and 6 qian. Compared with the old oil which was sold for 32 or 33 taels two months ago, it has fallen by almost half, which is really unbelievable. However, after this fall, both dealers and producers believe that the time has come, and they are all starting to bid. However, there are not many new goods available, so can there be such a huge supply, which has led to a turnaround. According to yesterday's Hankou telegram, it has opened at 17 taels and is now at 18 taels. However, this winter's candle manufacturers did not prepare much stock in advance due to the high price of old oil, and they have been gradually decreasing prices before the new oil arrived, so they did not dare to prepare winter goods immediately. Therefore, the base stocks are very thin. When the market turnaround was seen, they began to purchase goods from various places, but the trend had already risen. Moreover, Jingyou oil (荆油) in Hankou usually arrives after the winter solstice, and even if it is shipped early, it will be a small amount. Fortunately, you are competing with me for it, and it is not enough to allocate, so the Hankou market has been in a state of short supply for several days. Local dealers have telegraphed to purchase, but there are no spot goods available, and only one or two out of ten can be purchased. Moreover, the inventory was not prepared due to the sharp fall after the new goods were released, so the total market stock is less than 2,000 pieces, which is rare for the new goods to be launched with such a thin stock. It is reported that the market in Jinlan, Zhejiang has also risen by two or three yuan. The price of car oil in Jiaxing is rising even more sharply because many have already been sold. It is said that the price of delivered car has been sold to 30 yuan, and the car delivered may require about 32 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from the production area. The current price of Cuban raw sugar is still 1.1875. The New York sugar futures price for December is 1.08, March next year is 1.10, May is 1.15, and September is 1.27, which is one point higher than the previous telegram. The Java spot sugar futures market still lacks ups and downs. The association's market is quiet with few buyers. The transaction price of Dutch No. 24 coarse grain white sugar fell to ten taels, fine grain white sugar was ten taels and two and a half fen, and No. 20 medium grain white sugar was nine taels and eight and a half qian. The market situation is stable.

<h3 id="e187">The 1932 Model New Car "Standard" Will Soon Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Time flies. In the blink of an eye, 1931 is about to bid us a sad farewell. And 1932 will soon meet us. At this time of year, car factories in Europe and the United States are busy planning or manufacturing the 1932 model new cars. And some manufacturers have already released new cars. According to the latest news, these new cars will soon be shipped to Shanghai and publicly exhibited. Now, let us describe the advantages of the first batch of new "Standard" cars to arrive in Shanghai, which I think will also be welcome news for readers.</p>
<p>Key Advantages that are Economical and Meet Standards. The "Standard" car has been around for twenty-eight years. Therefore, this year's new car is a crystallization of the experience gained over the past twenty-eight years. The money spent in the beginning of planning and construction is more than just ten thousand pounds. In addition, engineers and ordinary workers have spent a lot of brainpower over the years to produce the 1932 model new car. This new car will surprise us at first sight, because its main advantage is that it meets the principles of economy and is very comfortable to drive. However, the selling price is low, and the cost of driving is extremely economical. Strictly speaking, the results of the new cars produced by various British factories in the past have never been so good. Car owners can be very satisfied after purchasing this new car. In terms of recent social aspects, culture is advancing day by day, and the appearance of the required cars is also an important issue. This 1932 model "Standard" car is also as beautiful as possible in terms of form. In terms of the types of new cars, there are four types: No. 20, No. 16, Big No. 9 and Small No. 9.</p>
<p>A Leader in Low-Priced Cars. Once we buy this new car, we can know that its internal structure has some advantages. In the past, only high-priced cars had them. Low-priced cars must not be so beautiful. For example, the fuel tank is placed at the rear, which is very safe. Semi-elliptical springs and shock absorbers are installed on the front and rear parts. Magna-style wheels and shatterproof glass windscreens have always been unique to high-priced cars. However, the 1932 model "Standard" car is equipped with the above-mentioned various devices, and the selling price is still low. Is this not a successful product and sufficient to meet the needs of society?</p>
<p>Extremely Fuel Efficient When Driving. Not only that, but the "Standard" car paid special attention to the economy of gasoline when it was manufactured. Therefore, the consumption of fuel is incomparable to any other car when driving. At the same time, the safety and the ability to travel on the road have not been reduced in the slightest.</p>
<p>Convenient Driving and Comfortable Handling. In addition to the economy of gasoline, the "Standard" new car is also satisfactory in terms of convenient driving and comfortable handling. Car owners can easily prove it after purchasing it. Therefore, "Standard" cars are most suitable for women to drive. In a nutshell, the "Standard" new car is light, smooth, simple and convenient to drive, and the handling is easy. The braking power is strong and the braking is convenient, which makes the driver satisfied everywhere.</p>
<p>Beautiful Car Body and Unique Style. When the owner of the "Standard" new car drives out, there is absolutely no restriction in the car. Even on rough and uneven roads, there is no need to worry about shaking. Therefore, there is no need to worry about all explosions and ruptures. Therefore, the car body of the "Standard" new car is made by famous craftsmen, and safety issues are taken care of everywhere. All "Standard" new cars have car bodies made of steel plates, and the four car doors are inlaid with artificial ivory, which is especially pleasing to the eye. Therefore, the structure of the new car is not only excellent in terms of mechanical parts, but also greatly improved in terms of the car body.</p>
<p>Four-Part Speed, No Noise At All. When this new car is driving on the road, its various advantages are even more amazing. When driving on ordinary roads, it is only necessary to use the second gear, and the highest gear also has special advantages. The gears are divided into four-part speed, and there is no noise at all when using the third gear, which is especially excellent. If a three-part speed gearbox is used, the second gear will not make even the slightest noise.</p>
<p>New Method of Heat Reduction. The heat reduction device is completely manufactured using a new method, and the appearance is even more impressive. This is also a special advantage of the "Standard" new car. The stripes painted on the outside are quite beautiful. When people see it today, they will know that the new car has special advantages and is very comfortable to drive.</p>
<p>New Car Top is Convenient to Open and Close. According to the manufacturers of the "Standard" new car, the 1932 model new car can be used for two purposes. When driving out, if the people sitting in the car want to protect themselves from the wind and rain, they can close the car top tightly, which is no different from a sedan. However, if you want the sun to shine in or the air to be fresh, you can remove the car top or a convertible car. Therefore, all 1932 model "Standard" new cars use Stanlite Sliding Roof (斯丹立脫斜形車頂), and the car top is very convenient and quick to open and close. It can also be opened and closed at any time while driving. Car owners will know the convenience of this car top once they buy it.</p>
<p>It is said that these new cars will be displayed in the model room at No. 702 Jing'an Temple Road after they arrive in Shanghai. At that time, people in Shanghai who want to buy cars can go and have a look.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Citroen's American Visit - A Fragment of Mr. Citroen's Success Story <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>André Citroen, hailed as the "Henry Ford of France," recently embarked on a journey from France to visit major automobile manufacturers in America. During his time in the US, he meticulously inspected various renowned car factories. Consequently, his American hosts harbored a shared sentiment, wondering what insights Citroen would incorporate into his vehicles upon returning to France. In 1912, this French automotive magnate traveled to America, adopting American mass production methods. After returning to France, he immediately put them into practice, leading to a substantial increase in car production. In 1923, Citroen revisited America, gaining even more valuable knowledge. Upon his return, he was laden with insights, implementing everything he had learned in America into his factory. As a result, Citroen's production leaped to 200 vehicles per day. Regarding his latest trip, commentators suggest that Citroen harbors even grander ambitions and will undoubtedly gain even more. He purportedly intends to establish a Citroen branch factory in America.</p>
<p>Despite Citroen's moniker as the "Henry Ford of France," his daily life differs significantly from Ford's. Citroen's parents were quite wealthy, distinguishing him from Ford. He received considerable education in mechanical engineering in his early years. Although already 54 years old, he is short, energetic, and lively, with sparse hair and a radiant demeanor. The spectacles perched on his nose and his piercing gaze immediately reveal him as a man of talent and intellect.</p>
<p>When Citroen began his business, his factory initially produced gear machinery. Later, he transitioned to manufacturing automobiles. With the outbreak of the Great War, he enlisted in the military to serve his country, working in a front-line engineering unit for six months. The government highly valued Citroen's assistance and appointed him to establish a munitions factory for producing artillery shells in a short time. The factory was completed in five months, producing countless shells. Until the war's end, this factory produced 50,000 shells daily. Citroen, realizing the war would not last forever, decided to convert the shell factory into an automobile manufacturing plant. In March 1919, the shell factory ceased operations, and by July of the same year, the Citroen automobile factory was completed. From then on, the armaments factory, which had specialized in producing lethal weapons, was transformed into an automobile factory that benefited humanity. Citroen's foresight and vision are truly commendable.</p>
<p>Citroen's adventurous endeavors are akin to gambling, yet his automobile factory is undoubtedly a winning bet. He is also an avid gambler in games of chance. On one occasion in Deauville, Citroen won $700,000. In another instance, he lost $400,000 in a card game. However, after this loss, his banker advised him to cease gambling to preserve his business. Citroen complied, focusing on the automobile manufacturing business. Today, he can produce 100,000 vehicles annually, encompassing various sizes and types, including four-cylinder and six-cylinder models, with prices starting from $900 per vehicle. Citroen's business methods are highly praised, and he is regarded as an American-style businessman among Europeans. He has employed various advertising strategies to attract customers. The ingenuity of his designs surpasses even that of famous American advertising professionals. The most renowned and impressive of his advertisements was renting the Eiffel Tower in Paris as an advertising space. This tower, known as the Eiffel Tower, is a world-famous tall structure. After renting the advertising space, Citroen adorned it with electric lights spelling out "Citroen," clearly highlighting the advantages of his products, attracting significant attention. Another grand undertaking with advertising qualities, although not direct advertising, achieved the same level of attention as the Eiffel Tower advertisement. What was this advertisement? It was Citroen's automobiles being the first to cross the Sahara Desert. Citroen automobiles traversed the desert, starting from Algeria and ending in Timbuktu, a distance of 3,000 miles. Citroen's engineers installed rubber underlays on the wheels, enabling them to traverse the desert terrain, much like military tanks equipped with metal underlays.</p>
<p>Besides the Javel quai, Citroen's automobile factory also has five branch factories. Each factory is large in scale, employing 4,000 workers. His factories can produce 300 vehicles daily. Compared to the production numbers of American automobile factories, this number may seem limited, but within France, Citroen is undoubtedly the largest. His production accounts for 20 percent of the nation's total.</p>
<p>A well-known anecdote about Citroen is often praised, revealing his character. A young boy in France once wrote to Citroen, stating that he excelled in both academics and conduct at home and school. He had saved two small silver coins given to him by his father as pocket money. The boy continued, stating that he wished to purchase a Citroen automobile with these two small silver coins. Citroen was delighted upon receiving the letter and replied, inviting the boy to visit. Upon the boy's arrival, Citroen guided him through the automobile showroom, encouraging him to choose any car he desired. After careful consideration, the boy suddenly said to Citroen, "No, having seen these automobiles, I have decided to keep my two small silver coins."</p>

<p>The installation of shock absorbers has become a commonplace event; every vehicle has them. In terms of braking, significant improvements have been made. Safety glass is equipped in vehicles of all sizes. At least ten companies at the Xia Ling Pei exhibition display vehicles equipped with above-standard shatterproof glass. Such as Luer Luis, Lawyer Ma, Austin, and Lilan. For the convenience of driving at night and to prevent accidents, the new cars this year mostly adopt light-avoidance methods. Therefore, the 1932 Luxkleve headlights are installed. This type of headlight contains two bundles of filaments, which can be arbitrarily made to emit ordinary light or avoid dazzling light. The glass in front of the light is also a specially made product. There are many oblique concave surfaces, so that the light is obliquely refracted, and the road is clearer. For this reason, accidents are also less likely to occur. The taillight displayed by the Gilbert Company can emit strong light in an instant to attract the attention of drivers behind, which is much more economical than long-term bright taillights. In addition, the new cars displayed by various car factories have special advantages, and the low car price is a common key point. As for the structure of the car body, it will be described in the following text.</p>
<p>The success of small cars - The Thailing Fuda No. 7 car has had considerable success since its introduction. Therefore, the quantity of its products is also increasing day by day, and the 1932 model is inexpensive and even has never been had before. The new sedan car uses semi-elliptical springs and is installed on a silent axle head. The oil tank is placed in the rear. The new pillowless sedan has completely solved the problem of the small rear of the small sedan, and it is extremely comfortable after being tested by people. Thailing Fuda No. 9 new four-cylinder car, the engine is 1,01800, the inlet pipe and the outlet pipe are connected to each other, and the actions are consistent and close. Other advantages, such as four-speed gearbox, three-bearing crankshaft stick, Lockheed hydraulic braking, etc., are even more numerous to mention. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A new Ford factory is established in the UK. The American Ford Motor Company is a leader in the world's automobile manufacturing industry. Recently, it has re-focused on the development of overseas businesses. In addition to the Detroit headquarters factory, branch factories are set up in various important areas to produce Ford cars for local application. Its British branch factory has been established, and the factory site is on the banks of the River Thames, about eighteen miles from London, the capital of England, with the place name Daqin Hamu. The Ford cars required by the European market in the future will be manufactured by this factory. The scale of the Ford Motor Company in England is very large. In addition to the major automobile factories in the United States, this factory should be the largest in the world. The Daqin Hamu factory site is very large, covering 110 acres, with another 484 acres of surplus land for expansion. The front of the factory is about half a mile away from the River Thames. This open space can be used to store raw materials, and the manufactured cars can also be loaded onto ships or trains from here and transported to other places. The equipment in the factory is also considerable. The manufacturing workshop and the housing for the configuration workshop are 1,000 feet long and 300 feet wide. The wide field between the two houses is 80 feet wide and covered. Driving track cars. The furnace weighs 500 tons, which is the largest in southern England. The siliconizing machine also weighs 500 tons. There are forty-five byproduct coke ovens, which can carbonize 800 tons of coal per day.</p>
<p>Current situation of the American automobile market. From October to December</p>
<p>It is the last quarter of the automobile market in a year. Experienced American automobile manufacturers often call this time the season of waiting and seeing, because customers often wait and see at this time. Probably the new cars of next year will often be found on the market at the end of a year. Therefore, customers often do not buy immediately, but wait for all the cars to come out before purchasing and selecting. Judging from the current situation, although there are signs of stagnation in the market, it will soon be eliminated, because most customers cannot wait for long and will eventually choose to buy a car. Generally, a car is used for at least one or two years, and up to three years. Car owners must have the intention to replace new cars. Therefore, filling old cars is also an important development of the automobile market. For example, 6,000,000 new cars were sold in 1929, so this old car will inevitably be discarded next year and replaced with a new car instead. As for the manufacturers, they often urge car owners to replace new cars at this time, and offset the price with their old cars. For this reason, at the time of alternation between new and old, both sellers and buyers have a waiting and seeing phenomenon. As for selling cars, it is easier to sell them to people who already have cars. If the use of automobiles is a kind of plaything for the rich, it will be very difficult to sell cars to people with this kind of psychology. Therefore, the trend of automobile sales today is actually easier than in the past. Compared with ten years ago, the difference is even greater. At that time, 9,000,000 cars were sold, and there were still many people who had not had the opportunity to drive a car. In 1921, about 1.5 million cars were sold. So everyone felt worried that the market was oversaturated. However, in a few years, automobile manufacturers shouted the slogan "one car per family". It is estimated that there are 25,000,000 families in total. After that, this thing was really realized. Then they changed their slogan to "every person in the family must have a car." From then on, the scope of selling cars became even wider.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Road Administration Studies Move in Shaanxi and Sichuan Provinces <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces are located in the remote northwest. If you want to facilitate transportation, it is not enough to build roads for automobile traffic to communicate with each other and achieve balanced development. Therefore, the authorities of the two provinces also know that the mountains and rivers are difficult to repair, and the stagnation of goods is not a way to develop real industries and</p>
<p>Benefit merchants, not a way to advance culture and facilitate exchange. Therefore, each province has carefully planned the road administration of its own province and carefully repaired it. Now the information obtained from the investigation is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Road Construction Plan of Shaanxi Province The Highway Bureau of Shaanxi Province has specially formulated a concrete plan for the recent north-south trunk line and the progress in order to develop transportation to meet the needs of the day. The main points are: (1) Bao Nan Auto Road The road is from Bao Lin to Han Nan. Strive to start construction as soon as possible within the shortest possible time. All the survey engineers in the county have been properly assigned. Once the provincial government's administrative meeting approves the concrete plan, they will immediately take action to rush the repair. Before the construction of the road is started, it is planned to send personnel to Baoji first, and rush to complete the project from Bao Lin to Fengxiang in order to meet the needs of transporting materials in the future. (2) Xi Tong Light Rail. This road from Xi'an to Tongzhou was planned to be put into operation for a long time. Only the western section of the Longhai Road still needs to be borrowed, which has not been carried out. Now it has been negotiated with the Longhai authorities, and they will go to Chongbao to pick up and transport it, and set a time limit for laying it down. All earthwork matters on this road are also being actively carried out and will soon be completed. (3) Wei North Transportation. The two automobile roads in Wei North, Xi Chao (Xi'an to Chaoyi) and Xi Chang (Xi'an to Changwu), used to be located in Chang'an, which was inconvenient for merchants. It is now planned to connect the two lines of Xi Chang Xi Chao through Yang Yu Li Quan Du. In the future, merchants traveling on the road in Wei North can arrive in Chang from Chao in case of emergency, without having to detour through Xi'an. (4) East-West Thoroughfare. Recently, there have been many damages to the east-west automobile road due to yin and rain. In addition to expanding the Bureau's engineering team as appropriate and assigning cadres to actively protect and repair the automobile administration, construction bureaus in various counties have been strictly ordered to organize engineering teams within the specified time to rush to build the automobile roads within their respective counties to facilitate commercial transportation. At the same time, the road protection teams on each road were also ordered that if there are larger projects in a certain place that urgently need to be built, they should immediately report to the Provincial Bureau so that personnel can be sent to rush the repair. The overall goal is to facilitate passengers.</p>
<p>Roads throughout Sichuan Province. In recent years, the construction of roads in various counties and cities in Sichuan has lacked statistics. The 20 roads that have already been open to traffic and are still under construction are: (1) Yu Wan Road, from the north bank of Chongqing to Wan County. It has now been repaired from Wan County to the watershed. It has been opened to traffic. From the watershed to Liangshan Dianjiang Changshou to Jiangbei and other counties. After a meeting of the construction bureau chiefs of Liang Dian Chang, it was decided to transfer the short-term loan to be repaid as the cost of continuing construction. And it was decided to follow the Yan Jian Road method, each county built in sections, and the work could be ordered after the transfer of receipt. (2) Cheng Peng Road, from Chengdu Wai North to Peng Hao. It has been opened to traffic. Although it was blocked by the damage of the bridge of this nature, it has now been repaired. (3) He Tong Road, from Hechuan Nanjin Street to Tongliang, is funded by a private enterprise company. The roadbed from Hechuan Yongli has now been measured. The price of Shang Tianzhong Tian Xia Tian is given. Each share is limited to ten yuan. Those who complete the grain in more than three copies can receive a stock certificate. It was decided at the Anju meeting in Tong County on September 4. Construction can start after the autumn harvest is completed. (4) Tong He Road, from Tongnan to Hechuan, was commissioned by Commander Liu Wenhui to Zhao Peisang, the head of the group, as the supervisor.

<h3 id="e192">The Soul of the Nation <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Ceng Jinke</p>
<p>People, regardless of age, status, or wealth, have souls; nations, regardless of size, prosperity, or decline, also have souls. People without souls cannot survive, and nations without souls cannot exist. Human souls are divided into good and evil, and so are national souls. However, there are people in the world whose good souls do not receive good results, but there are no nations with good souls that cannot survive, because people can achieve prominence through evil deeds, while nations cannot rely solely on violence to assert their dominance.</p>
<p>What is the soul of a nation? It is national consciousness. Now, in the 20th century, empty words are of no use. Under powerful forces, there is no such thing as justice and righteousness; there is only resistance and struggle. However, resistance and struggle cannot be achieved overnight.</p>
<p>China is a weak nation. This is undeniable. It is certainly difficult to win against an unreasonable Japan with a weak nation. Even now, it seems impossible to resist the violence being inflicted upon us, because the Chinese people, who are "a heap of loose sand," are still "a heap of loose sand." The Chinese people, who are called the "sick men of East Asia," are still "sick men of East Asia." To organize some "sand"-like "sick men" together hastily, with some people just trying to show off, and then say they are going to resist the violent Japan, is at least a ridiculous act. Regarding this point, everyone who has participated in so-called patriotic work is very clear and I need not say more.</p>
<p>However, should we just let Japan invade us?</p>
<p>Of course, we must resist, but empty talk is useless. If our people were like the people of Japan, loving their country as much as their own lives, they would usually pay attention to ways to "defend against insults." The important people in the government are also part of the people, and they were people before they became officials. Of course, they can love the country as one, and through the joint efforts of the people and the government, there must be a way to "strengthen the country." But what about our people? What about our government? This is also clear to everyone and I need not say more. The Japanese people are the opposite of us in their attitude towards their country, and have been painstakingly working hard to become strong for decades. The legacy strategy of the Meiji Restoration, the first step was to conquer Taiwan, the second step was to conquer Korea, and both have already been realized. Now they are going to realize their third step, "to destroy Manchuria and Mongolia in order to conquer the entire territory of China." If we can start from this point to work hard and revitalize, then our nation can still become strong in the future. If we continue to procrastinate and be dispirited, I am afraid that the time of national subjugation is not far away. The soul of a nation is its entire people. From the health of these people, we can know whether the nation is healthy. To seek the health of the nation, we must first seek the health of the people's thoughts and abilities. To seek the health of the people's thoughts and abilities, we must first plan for the popularization and improvement of education, and plant the idea of patriotism in the hearts and minds of every young person, remember it firmly and never forget it, so that every person from childhood to adulthood has the idea of patriotism, and does their best to seek the health of their nation, loving their country as much as their own lives. Then their country will be strong and prosperous. At present, although it is hopeless to strengthen China, even if we do not have the ambition to dominate the world in the future, we should hurry up and cultivate the soul of our nation now for the sake of avoiding destruction in the future—the national consciousness of young people, especially children.</p>

<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>To adapt a literary work that has artistic merit into an extraordinary sound film, after the great success of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front," which can shine in film history alongside it and create a new record, in my personal opinion, it must be Robert Emmett Sherwood's "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" (Waterloo Bridge, originally translated as "Waterloo Bridge"). Non-war works have never aroused my interest, and non-war films especially make me avoid them like discarding leftovers. It is such a refusal to decay and abandon my long-held advocacy for film that prevented me from introducing "All Quiet on the Western Front," even though it caused a sensation in Shanghai at the time. Of course, a film like "All Quiet on the Western Front" has its greatness and does not need my evaluation. However, my personal subjective conditions for film must be expressed here. I believe that today's China is already rotten inside, riddled with holes, and the environment is stripping, eroding, trampling, and grinding. If there is not a strong "force" in art to resist foreign aggression and pacify internal affairs, to heal decay and treat waste, then the crisis that is about to step on our feet will be more than just the collapse of fences and the loss of territory. Film is a comprehensive art that shifts general will and changes general emotions. Under the current national conditions, it is especially important to use the four characters "courageous and fierce" as the guiding principle for public education, so that the Chinese nation, which is like a plate of loose sand suffering from jaundice, can be reborn, with a "force" of unity, and create a situation where all Chinese men and women on the front of national consciousness are healthy, strong, calm, and brave Qiu Jiu (a fictional strong man). The Qiu Ba (soldiers) of China, as the facts have told us, are unreliable. The superiors only indulge in personal hedonism, while the inferiors only waste food and retreat in battle. However, I must also declare that there is grass everywhere in the world. The Qiu Ba I am talking about does not include General Ma Zhanshan, because General Ma Zhanshan and his group of strong men, in the midst of 200,000 troops, succumbed to the wind, showed great righteousness, resisted Japan with an isolated army, were heroic and robust, brave and loyal, and were indeed the Qiu Ba we most needed. As for the young people who only know how to jump like monkeys and howl like pigs in the peach garden-like Shanghai, but are unwilling to truly prepare for "force," I still say they are not qualified to be Qiu Jiu.</p>
<p>My reasons for abandoning non-war films and my subjective conditions for film are as described above. However, I do not absolutely agree with works of war, but always take it as a prerequisite that it does not lose the inherent mission of film art. If there is a film that is insignificant and discarded by people, but the mission of film art is strongly expressed, I will inevitably recognize it as a work that is beneficial to the world and people's hearts. For example, "All Quiet on the Western Front," although I did not introduce it, I did not express opposition, because it has its greatness, which is the so-called mission of film art. I heard that it has been banned in China. The ban was when Chairman Chiang moved to Nanchang, which was several months ago. I cannot criticize whether such a policy of preventing problems before they occur is appropriate, but I should speak out for "All Quiet on the Western Front" because although it uses non-war as the tip of its theme, it does powerfully and clearly stimulate people's emotions of loving the nation and saving the country in the performance.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the topic. I said above that there is a Qiu Jiu in "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream." Although it does not give us an example of Qiu Jiu to see, the slogan that Chinese youth often hang on their lips, "Save the country without forgetting love, love without forgetting saving the country," is clearly and consciously reflected in it, teaching people how to implement this slogan. Western films, no matter how absurd, crude, or vulgar their themes are, always stand in front of the nation and shoulder their inherent mission. The understanding we gain from enjoying different styles in Western films is that the Western nation is so strong because its solid foundation is not built by a national government in a short period, but is indeed a great achievement of the tireless efforts of artists from ancient times to the present. Rome was not built in a day. Under today's circumstances, we cannot deny that we must expect our Chinese artists. But what about our Chinese artists? Alas, it is so sad to see them.</p>
<p>"Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" was produced in the same Universal City studio in the United States as "All Quiet on the Western Front." According to Universal Pictures itself, it is the only work after "All Quiet on the Western Front." It is a special achievement and an unusual and compact film. I heard that movie star Douglas Fairbanks also praised it, and the unanimous praise from American movie lovers is especially evidenced by the records in the movie theaters. In short, it is an extraordinary sound film that absolutely does not give people any doubt because it is the result of the hard work of a group of people and not an ordinary product.</p>
<p>Speaking of this group of people, I should introduce them selectively here.</p>
<p>(II) Original Author Robert Emmett Sherwood</p>
<p>First of all, talent is not very reliable. Talent with knowledge and experience is a successful artist. I would like to express my respect for Robert Emmett Sherwood first. Although he is not like other writers who first advertised a prominent name in the literary world, the artistic skills he demonstrates in his works are so superb that it is truly admirable. Do the readers doubt my words? Just take a look at the inner descriptions and scene performances of "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" and you will understand. You don't even have to calm down and read the original work carefully.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Chinese, this admirable writer is qualified to be an old man. He was born on April 4, 1896. He is over forty years old. He was born in New Rochelle, New York, USA. He is purely an American. He was talented since childhood. When he grew up, he majored in literature at Harvard University. He was blessed by nature and worked hard, so his attainments were extraordinary. Therefore, his achievements in Harvard were very amazing. After graduation, he devoted himself to cultural undertakings to develop his talent and served as the editor of the drama column of "Vanity Fair" magazine and the social column of "Life" magazine. With the novel selection of materials and the well-organized arrangement, he was very popular among the public. He also published articles from time to time to criticize films and dramas. Soon, he became a critic of drama and film.</p>
<p>Later, as his knowledge and skills increased, he resigned from his editorial position and devoted himself to the creation of drama. His plays, including "The Road to Rome," "The Love Nest," and "The Queen's Husband," all showed his talent and were unique in the American literary world. Later, he devoted all his efforts to "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream," which was even more admired by the literary world, and his position as a playwright was stabilized and his name became prominent.</p>
<p>After he wrote "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream," he made a special trip to California. During his pilgrimage to Hollywood, he personally visited James Whale, the director of Universal Pictures in Universal City, and discussed with him how to bring "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" to the screen. Whale, who knew the value of the work, naturally welcomed him very much. With the approval of Carl Laemmle Jr., the head of Universal Pictures, the filming was scheduled to begin under the direction of Whale. Usually, screenwriters in Hollywood did not have much close contact with film companies. The script was submitted, the fee was paid, and the literary transaction was completed. As for how the script was divided into scenes and how it was filmed, there were people responsible for handling it, and the author never asked. However, Sherwood was different. He broke the old routine with a punch, took the fee but did not leave, always hiding in the studio, following Whale to see how his "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" was being adapted into a film.</p>
<p>Whale is not a casual director. At least, his ideas and talent are above Ernst Lubitsch, although he is far inferior to Charlie Chaplin. Therefore, Sherwood was inexplicably amazed after seeing a few scenes directed by him. He then affirmed that no one could direct his "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" except Whale. He then bid farewell to Whale, left Universal City, and returned to his residence. When he left Universal City, he made a few remarks:</p>
<p>"I know that no one is qualified to direct "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" as much as Whale because he completely organized London after the fierce bombing by the Air Force in 1917. That is the most important point of imagery in the whole play, which I deliberately expressed in the script. "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" is not organized by a typical story. It is a reflection of the emotions of the general public who were severely oppressed during the war. The focus of the whole play is on that very organization.</p>
<p>"As a result of visiting "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" in the studio, I proved that several very important parts really made me admit that Ms. Moe Clarke performed very brilliantly, vividly as if the real Myra (the character in the play) in my script ran out. That American singer who lives in London, she is completely affected by the war and feels endless hardships and difficulties in life, and at the same time suffers all kinds of traumas in the process of love. Ms. Mae's extraordinary performance is something I have never seen before. Therefore, Myra's pain as a singer who became one of the wailing people during the war was vividly conveyed between Ms. Mae's expressions to arouse the audience's emotion. Ms. Mae was specially hired to play the difficult part of Myra. It is not easy to perform the role of Myra in "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream." Only Ms. Mae can perform it. I am really impressed by her performance skills. Several shots of her co-starring with male actor Kent Douglass are also very brilliant.</p>
<p>The film adaptation of "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" is so extraordinary that it makes me infinitely happy and satisfied because I like this script more deeply than anything I have written before."</p>
<p>After Sherwood gave his speech, he fell silent, but he was still meditating and pursuing his subject, probably looking for his next script.</p>
<p>(III) Director James Whale</p>
<p>Among the staff of a film production, the director is second only to the author in importance. If the director has talent, knowledge, and can see through the mysteries of the original meaning of a script, the release of the film will naturally have many amazing aspects. If he is a mediocre person, then even if the script is written very brilliantly, it will be ruined by that mediocre person. But this is not what I am talking about James Whale. James Whale's name has soared to the sky because of the successful direction of "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream." However, this director, who has the skill to elaborate on the essence of the script, did not develop his talent in one day. He was originally a playwright, born in Great Britain on July 2, 1896, but he was quiet and taciturn from youth to old age. He studied in England but never received a university education. He had served in the military and been an officer. During the European War, he was captured by the Germans and became a prisoner of war. He spent two years in a German prison.</p>
<p>In prison, he became aware of drama, noticed the expression of theatrical scenes, and began his drama work in prison until the end of the war. When the armistice was signed, he returned to England and staged the American historical drama "Lincoln" in England. Then he went to London to realize his drama life. In the course of his progress and success, his works were very amazing and produced in large quantities. The most successful ones include "The Cherry Orchard," "Prisoners of War," "The Seagull," and others.</p>
<p>Since Whale had achieved success in acting, he took a further step to devote himself to directing. Directing is more difficult than acting because both sides need to have a deep understanding of personality. There are also various other controls, deliberations, and arrangements. But Whale, during the trial period, with his rich knowledge, also gained considerable results and gradually made progress, standing in an important position in the British drama scene. The play "Journey's End" was his greatest success in directing.</p>
<p>The success of "Journey's End" made him expand his ambition and increase his desire. Perhaps he was tired of playing in drama and wanted to enter the field of film and become an old gardener. Film is even more different than drama. Although some people say that the basic principles of film and drama are the same, at least space and time are much wider than drama. In terms of organization, they are also completely different. However, Whale, who is both talented and knowledgeable, just fits the old saying "The capable can do anything." He actually achieved success. Based on his inherent knowledge and talent, he filmed his "Journey's End" and also came to Hollywood in the United States, occupying a chair in the director's seat of Universal Pictures in Universal City. Now, he has shouldered a heavy burden and successfully created Sherwood's masterpiece "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream." "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" is not easy to direct. It is a difficult task in the film industry, but Whale took it up resolutely and achieved success, which is truly amazing.</p>
<p>This talented director is a tall, silent Englishman with a calm mind and a peaceful attitude. He always observes things first and then implements them. He has self-confidence but is unwilling to be reckless. This kind of dignified and steady ability to handle affairs can make people imagine his talent. Therefore, the success of Sherwood's "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream" is due to his calm mind, keen eyes, calm spirit, and broad knowledge.</p>
<p>(IV) Starring Mae Clarke</p>
<p>After introducing the two giants, the third one to be introduced is the star Mae Clarke. Like Whale, Ms. Mae did not graduate from college, but with her family's background, she is very authentic as a film actor. She is just over twenty years old, and her oval face has a unique beauty. She has a unique style outside of Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford, and Clara Bow. She is a blonde beauty with a pool of autumn water in her eyes, lined with two moth eyebrows, which is most feminine. Her 110-pound, five-foot-high delicate body is lively and graceful, graceful and healthy, with smooth skin, and has all the beauty of all beauties, and her talent is even more clever, and her manners are even more endearing. Such a talented woman makes her performance even more amazing and natural, making people see her unusually rich talent for acting. She acts in movies like mercury, penetrating every pore. Her deep understanding of the characters is not something that other actresses with star titles can match. That is her greatness, which is a shocking technique that has been gained through years of research and integrated with her talent. She has acted in quite a few films, but the blind directors have not understood her beauty and talent, so she has always been inferior to others. There is no Bole in the world, but there are many good horses. I cannot bear to mourn for Mae Clarke's lack of talent. However, such a talented and beautiful film actor will eventually reveal her brilliance and will not be submerged for a long time.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she was specially selected by Whale, who has unique insight, from among all the beauties to play the heroine of "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream." Only heroes can recognize heroes, as Whale is.</p>
<p>Mae's performance is purely based on the heart of the character, using her excellent talent to perform a certain emotion of the character. In "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream," we see on the scene that it is not Mae Clarke but Myra. Only those with deep cultivation can have great talent. Mae, who was not recognized in the past, is the reason why she has deep cultivation. Otherwise, relying solely on talent would not have today's achievements. After she became the heroine of "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream," her unprecedented performance was praised by all parties. The young head of Universal signed a five-year long-term contract with her to be the basic star of his company in order to realize his strong film development plan.</p>
<p>(V) Explanation of the Title</p>
<p>Regarding the title of Waterloo Bridge of "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream," everyone regards it as strange. Indeed, the title of a film is often taken from an unusual and novel name. Just like adopting an unusual and novel story as the story in the play, this proves that Sherwood is very familiar with London. The reason why his script takes the bridge as the background of the whole play is that the focus of each stage of the bridge cannot be separated, and the focus of each stage of the bridge cannot be separated from a beautiful word, and the beautiful part is especially at the end of the West, which is the fade-out in the film from both sides to the south bank of the river.</p>
<p>According to Londoners themselves, 19 people say that Waterloo Bridge is the most beautiful place and the main road for transportation between London and the world. Historically, it is also the most glorious and beautiful bridge on the entire Thames River. Italian sculptor Canova also praised it infinitely and said that it is most valuable to go from Rome to see this solemn and magnificent model of architecture.</p>
<p>The construction of Waterloo Bridge began in October 1811 and was completed on July 18, 1817. The engineer in charge was J.R. Rennie, a famous architect with rich knowledge and experience who had built several magnificent bridges. When building Waterloo Bridge, he was responsible for all the planning. The bridge was originally planned to be 1,326 feet long, but it was expanded to 2,456 feet long and 142 feet wide due to special decorations. The regular road is 70 feet wide and 654 feet high. The construction cost was £1 million. It was originally named "Bin Bridge" because it is an important bridge connecting Wellington Street and the riverside from the south. But in 1816, the year before its completion, it was named Waterloo Bridge. The Battle of Waterloo in the Anglo-French War on June 18, 1815, was a particularly glorious victory for the British army. In order to commemorate that battle, it was named Waterloo Bridge, and the Crown Prince personally officiated at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>The focus of the film's story is borrowed from the glorious Waterloo Bridge in history as the background. The author took the name of the bridge as the title of the film. Therefore, the Waterloo Bridge is not only passed down in history, but now it is famous in film, and its popularity is even more indescribable.</p>
<p>(VI) Sketch</p>
<p>The reason why this film is wonderful, I think, is that the narrative of the facts is both charming and sad, the description of the plot is also bizarre and beautiful, and the performance of the scene is even more wonderful. Film, I often say, whether its theme is about the love of children or a glimpse of life, there is always a central consciousness, that is, the heresy of art. For example, "Broken Bridge, Lingering Dream," although the background is Waterloo Bridge in the war era, and the story is about the depression of London society during the war, its mission is to guide the people to arm themselves and go to the front line in accordance with our Chinese saying, "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual." Because going to the front line, the situation in London gradually became bleak, and because Waterloo Bridge was attacked by the German Air Force, this sad and beautiful story was created. The foreign Qiu Jiu are all "loving the country without forgetting love." Therefore, the male character in the film is such a young man. After retreating from the front line, he met the infinitely sad and beautiful girl on Waterloo Bridge. The girl is a thin-fate person who has fallen to the end of the world. From the United States to London, she made a living by selling songs on the stage. She has turned over many romantic officers, and young masters, but because of the desolation of London, she eventually became a fallen flower. She was doing the business of the Wushan goddess on Waterloo Bridge. When she saw the young soldier, she suddenly tied him with her heart. However, in the era of turmoil, good young people are going to sacrifice for the country, and there are also grades. The girl then endured the pain and gave up her love, declined the young man's tenderness, and cut off her love to make him give up the idea and go to the front line to kill the enemy again.</p>
<p>However, the young man, who is deeply passionate, must be brave in his actions. Therefore, before returning to the front line after his leave, he ran to Waterloo Bridge to find the girl again. He found the girl, shamed him, insulted him, and beat him, but he was always as gentle as before, understanding everything, and it was necessary for the girl to allow him to go to the front line to sacrifice for the country. Passionate women sometimes have to abandon their private feelings and encourage the men they love with great righteousness. The girl then allowed him and wanted him to go to the front line. Unexpectedly, a farewell became a farewell forever. When waving a towel to say goodbye on Waterloo Bridge, she and a corner of Waterloo Bridge became powder together.</p>
<p>Oh, young men and women of China, I hope that you will look at this film and have some understanding of its focus.</p>
