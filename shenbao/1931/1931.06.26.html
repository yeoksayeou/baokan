<p>中央宣傳部二十五日爲勦滅赤匪丶告同志書丶原文如下丶</p>
<p>我國目前最大的禍患丶和各地人民最大的苦痛丶厥爲赤匪的焚殺淫掠丶鄂湘贛等省丶閭里邱墟丶土地荒蕪丶餓莩載道丶瘡痍</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>滿目丶往昔聞獻流寇的浩刦丶亦無如此慘酷丶建設事業之所以無法進行丶野心軍閥之所以蠢然思動丶無不以赤匪的擾亂爲其根本導因丶國民革命進展到今日的階段丶其成功失敗全視吾人能否根本殲除赤匪以爲斷丶因此我們當前的最急要的工作丶就是在集中力量丶去勦滅專事焚殺掠刦的赤匪丶中央深知赤禍爲人民疾苦之所在丶及革命成敗所攸關丶故雖連年討伐叛亂軍閥丶迄未稍稍放棄勦匪的工作丶自去歲四中全會議决丶以剷共剿匪爲本年度施政首要的議案以來丶對於剿匪的進行丶更屬不遺餘力丶湘鄂兩省的赤匪丶自經大舉圍勦後丶其勢漸蹙丶徒以匪性狡詐丶輾轉竄避丶裹脅農民丶憑險頑抗丶又因粤變突起丶予殘匪以喘息的機會丶致垂死之灰丶又作復燃之想丶本黨以解救民困爲職責丶對於匪禍之蔓延丶引爲深痛丶故特加緊督促政府丶調集大軍丶以最大的决心和努力丶誓在短期内丶根本殲除湘贛的赤禍丶當兹協力痛勦赤匪之日丶我全體同志均須有深切的認識和努力丶</p>
<p>赤匪的指揮者直接的爲中國共産黨丶間接的則爲赤俄帝國主義丶其手段之毒辣丶隂謀之險狠丶决非普通匪寇可比丶赤匪之所以拼命搗亂秩序丶破壞社會丶其目的在滿足一巳的貪慾丶並換取赤俄帝國主義的賞賜丶而赤俄則利用赤匪的焚殺丶使中國成爲擾亂破碎的國家丶以遂其侵略兼併之野心丶故赤匪的存在與蔓延丶實爲我國一切内亂外患之病源丶我們勦滅赤匪丶即是遏絶赤俄的侵略與共黨的荼毒丶亦即是消弭内亂外患的根本辦法丶此其一丶年來赤匪慘肆焚殺丶我同胞之喪身損命者丶巳不知幾十萬人丶村落城鎮之被焚刦丶亦不知幾十萬處丶統計全國曾被赤禍之地丶數達二百餘縣以上丶其禍機潛伏丶在在堪虞之地者丶亦屬不在少數丶况不迅速撲滅丶則禍毒之蔓延丶將不知伊於胡底丶故赤匪的肆毒丶决不是湘贛一隅的禍患丶實爲全國人民共同的禍患丶湘贛人民固應努力剿赤丶以謀自救丶而各省人民丶亦應思患預防丶並共負勦滅赤匪的責任丶以救濟被禍的同胞丶此其二丶</p>
<p>查赤匪所以嘯聚日衆丶寖成大患的原因丶實由於農民生活艱難丶智識薄弱丶致多受赤匪的誘惑和脅迫丶而各地的盜匪流氓丶又以臭味相投丶相率入夥丶故匪勢乃蔓延日廣丶爲禍日烈丶今日勦匪的要務丶一方面固在合圍兜勦丶殲其首惡丶並招撫被脅農民丶以减削其暴力丶一方面尤應着手於根本的救濟丶綏靖農村丶改良農民生活丶以作釜底抽薪之計丶凡此諸事丶政府只能舉其大端丶宣傳扶助之責丶實在我全體同志肩上丶此其三丶</p>
<p>過去剿匪未易奏效的原因丶實由於連年之討伐軍閥丶未能集全力以從事於勦匪之工作丶而民衆方面丶亦缺乏强固組織丶不能積極爲政府助力丶以收通力協作的效能丶因此二大弱點丶剿匪工作的進展丶無形中不免受重大的影響丶故今後爲求剿匪軍事的順利進展丶必須喚起民衆丶成立健全的團體之組織丶務使黨政軍民丶澈底聯絡丶期於最短期間丶收根本勦滅赤匪之效丶此其四丶</p>
<p>關於剿滅赤匪的根本方法丶國民會議亦巳有五項指示丶（一）必須深明赤匪之毒害與罪惡丶（二）必須斷絶赤匪思想言論與出版物之流傳丶（三）青年男女爲赤匪所惑丶陷入歧途者丶其家長或學校當局丶必須負糾正約束之責丶（四）農村與城巿之生産者丶必須依勞資互助合作之原則丶謀雙方之利益丶（）五在剿匪區域内丶各人地人民必須與縣政府協力舉辦保甲清鄉丶及輔助剿匪善後之事宜丶故有匪區域内的同志丶於國軍進剿赤匪之時丶必須察查匪黨偵報匪蹤丶辦理交通及從事於剿赤宣傳丶於本地進行清鄉之際丶則應清查殘匪丶無使潛伏於匪類肅清之後丶應與政府合力辦理善後事項丶賑救流亡丶恢復秩序及組織保衛等等工作丶在無匪區域内的同志丶則應努力宣傳本黨主義丶及訓政建設的意義與政績丶以根本遏絶赤匪煽惑之根源丶並養成人民自保自衛的勇氣與力量丶尤應以切實有效的方法丶增進農工之生計丶引導青年納於正軌丶</p>
<p>以上所指各點丶均屬完成剿匪工作與根本撲滅赤禍必要之努力丶深望全國同志丶各人員起責任丶與政府軍隊人民丶羣策羣力丶於最短期内丶殲滅赤匪丶則人民的痛苦可以解除丶社會的秩序得以恢復丶而訓政建設之推行丶和平統一之保障丶亦均將惟此是賴丶中央執行委員會宣傳部丶（二</p>

<p>以上爲賠欵問題之廻溯。兹請更一叙述所謂戰債問題。</p>
<p>自大戰爆發。歐洲各國一時都捲入漩渦。經長期之苦鬥。協約各國都呈現極端之困窘。經濟之枯竭。生産之停頓。軍火及種種軍用品之缺乏。都使協約國無法應付。迨一九一七年四月。美利堅最後加入戰團。協約國乃頓呈活氣。於是大批之軍用品與原料。大批之欵項。都源源從美國借貸而來。美國在宣戰以後十八天即通過第一批自由公債。核准借三十萬萬元與協約國。其後迭次發行公債。實際交與協約國使用者爲九十五萬九千八百萬元休戰後美國又迭次核准給予歐洲以食糧之救濟。並且將美國軍隊在歐洲所用之剩餘軍用品丶賒賣與駐在國。綜合而計。爲數共約百五十六億元。歐洲各國欠負美國之債務。約如下表所示。</p>

<p>（此等本金及利息金額。係根據一九二五年十一月十五日之狀况）</p>
<p>此種戰債之借貸。當時曾分别成立協定。註明分爲若干年。陸續還本付息。戰事告終。各債務國自須履行協定。逐年償還本息。但戰後之協約國。對於戰債問題。巳表示有討論之餘地。英國欠美債最多。原額爲美金四十六萬萬元。但對於法意等國。則爲債權關係。一九二二年英外務大臣貝爾福至正式主張放棄德國賠欵部分。同時把協約國間之債務。一筆勾銷。此種主張美國自絶對不能接受。故一九二○年八月威爾遜總統致英相勞合喬治討論賠欵問題並聲明美國戰債方針之信中有云。「有人建議美國應該代德國償付賠欵之一部分。或者對於協約國政府自由的。贈予若干欵項。俾協約國肯按照德國之償付能力。規定賠欵數額。美國對於此種說數之理論。極不明瞭。美政府一向以極友誼之精神。聲明不能同意將賠償問題與各政府間之債務。併爲一談。」於此吾人可以想見美國對戰債不肯讓步態度之堅决。美國對債權旣不肯讓步。則戰債之所自出。協約國自惟有以德國賠欵作抵。故在楊格會議中。協約各國對於賠欵之繳付。曾作極精細之考慮。終乃决定德國賠欵年限爲五十二年。劃分兩期。頭期三十七年中。德國每年應付欵平均約二·○五○·○○○·○○○金馬克。略當抵補協約國每年清還借欵本息及一部財産損失之用。第二期二十二年中。每年亦須賠一宗鉅欵。略當協約國還清本息之用。總之對美國之戰債。即取自德國賠欵。德國每年繳納之賠欵。决不能少於協約國每年償還美國之戰債。截至今年一月底。各債務國償還美國戰債本利。共計爲美金二十五萬一千五百三十萬元。而此種鉅欵之來源。即爲楊格計劃中之德國賠欵。於此吾人即可瞭然於戰債與賠欵。實有不能分離之關係。即德國爲最後唯一之債務國。而美國則爲最後唯一之債權國。兹將賠欵與戰債表示如次。</p>
<p>（此圖數字以百萬爲單位丶乃代表在楊格計劃下自一九二九年至一九六五年中之每年平均償付數額）</p>
<p>德國4737</p>

<p>美國</p>
<p>就上表所示。吾人謂賠欵爲戰債之基金。德國即華盛頓政府之外庫。殆無不可。美政府不欲將兩者併爲一談。但决無法否認兩者關聯之密切。蓋事實决不容許其否認也。（未完）</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>鼠子週</p>
<p>吾國近年以來。對於各種公共的運動。大抵以七日爲期。而加上一個「週」的新名詞。如「衛生運動週」「拒毒運動週」等。不一而足。一九二九年冬間。英倫全國。也舉行一個週。那名稱很特别。呌作「鼠子週」“Rat　Week"原來是由英政府的農漁部發起。而與全國數千百萬的鼠子作戰。據他們調查所得。說鼠子之多。幾乎與他們人口不相上下。每一頭鼠子的消費。每禮拜須一先令。那麽每年的消費的總數。至少在一萬萬金鎊與一萬五千萬鎊之間。他們所以舉行這鼠子週。因爲那時恰值鼠子們從鄉間移入巿鎮的當兒。須得成羣結隊而來。也像人類的軍隊一樣。事前先派探子探看風色。地方當局就打算趁它們出動以後。大舉進攻。鼠子們可就要遭殃了。</p>
<p>貓聰明</p>
<p>英國開得福Catford地方。有一頭黑色的貓。名「老虎。」它生性很爲聰明。每從它的主人家出來玩耍時。它能將兩個前脚旋動門柄。輕輕的開門。回來時。他便站在門外的門柄上。將一隻脚伸上去叩動門鎚。由僕人們出來給它開門。這一派舉動。真的與人類一樣了。</p>

<p>— 徐午生</p>
<p>一電車讓坐位安丶一位西洋人忽然對着一位中國朋友說。「喂。你太没有道理啊。方才我在電車中見了你們貴國摩登女子。我就站起來讓坐位與伊。但是後來車中來了一位西洋女子站在你這裏。你爲什麽不讓坐位給伊坐呢。這是你不對的地方啊」。</p>
<p>「一位中國朋友回答他說。我爲什麽要讓伊坐呢。伊在我們中國享受這種權利巳經有幾十年的歷史了。現在讓伊立五分鐘也不要緊。你應當明白一般世界上的女子對待男子太不平等。現在我們的主義。是打倒不平等。要是男的來老的小的瘦弱的來。我還是讓他坐。就所謂扶助弱小民族的意思。要是青年的女子來。我也不願伊讓伊的坐位給我。我祇願保留我自巳的座位就是了」。</p>
<p>（二）携帶手槍案　持有頭等護照的一位南洋華僑。隨身帶了大宗的鉅欵。在美洲登岸。美國稅關裏的人。見了頭等護照的人。非特别保護他不可。所以向那登岸的華僑道。「你帶有手槍麽」。華僑道。「我並没有帶手槍」。那關吏又說。「要是你不自備手槍。不准登岸。因爲富有的無自備手槍。非常危險。我們警察不能時時刻刻跟着你跑的」。後來華僑買了手槍之後。方准登岸。這事由華僑告訴一位中國朋友說的話。</p>
<p>但是一位中國朋友對華僑說。」可見得你住在外國的地方。是十分危險啊。非得你有了自備手槍方可住。要是你到我們的真正的祖國地方來進口登岸的時候。請你先把在外國買的手槍丢了之後。再准你登岸。因爲我們真正的祖國地方。是用不着手槍的。可見得比較外國好得多呢。」</p>
<p>（三）保險賠欵案　一位在新加坡經商的印度人。在該埠山上造了一座避暑的房屋。四鄰無人。有一天因爲火錶走電。把房屋燒了。幸虧這座房屋保有五百鎊英金的火險。乃向保險公司索賠。不料該保險公司是一家某皇家保險公司。很有勢力的。不願照賠。因此印度人訴諸法庭。開庭之日。法官向印度人道。「你的房屋是在山上臨空的。獨自一座的。實有縱火圖賠的嫌疑。照法律不能賠。」</p>
<p>一位印度人問法官道。「要是一隻輪船在海洋裏燒了。試問賠不賠。」法官道。「輪船是輪船。房屋是房屋。大有分别。」印度人道。「那是並没有分别。所謂分别者。白與黑的分别。要是房屋是白人的。保險公司是黑人的。非賠不可。」</p>
<p>（四）「宜死」與「流血」案　一位英國的貴族。到東京迷了路。見了一位穿西裝的中國人。想問他所走的路。但是見了那位中國人。好像日本人。又好像中國人。所以他耐不住的問一句。說“What　Nese　YouAre?"就是「你究竟那一種「」宜死。是不是“Chinese”還是l"Japanese"呢。」</p>
<p>那位在東京的中國朋友。聽見這種問句。倒也何氣又可笑。仔細看看他的人樣。好像英格蘭人。又像愛而蘭人。他也問他一句。“What　Ish　Aou　Are?”「你是究竟那一種「流血。」是不是“English”還是Irsh”呢。」那位貴族得了這種平等待遇。他就溜了。</p>

<p>頃有琉球島人。在冲繩縣名瀨港附近。捕獲一長六尺之巨龜。大阪界水族館主人。以重金購而畜之。供游客參觀。巨龜於本月十五日由琉球趁台南丸起運來日。卸於大阪富島倉庫。予適經該處。見巨龜昻首悲鳴。因索縛不能動。故涙如雨注。余向守者叩其來源。知龜有酒脾。航途之中。每夜必啼。致旅客不能眠。與之以酒。則聲息。余不信。旋購麥酒兩瓶試之。果一吸而盡。啼息而滬止。余復向水族館主佐藤博士詢巨龜之年齡。據云龜之發育。每年不過一磅。而該龜之重量。爲五百六十三斤。可證明巨龜之年齡。定在六百歲以上。</p>

<p>本月二十二日。爲趙君豪君三十初度。趙君友好特假座東亞酒樓爲之稱觴慶祝。是晚計到男女來賓三百餘人。報界如張竹平。董顯光。汪伯奇。　少豪。　術家如黎錦暉夫婦。影界明星如胡蝶。梁賽珍。交際家如盛七小姐。閃翠英。楊文娟等。莫不參與。頗極一時之盛。由錢芥塵莊鑄九錢瑞甫唐世昌諸君料量一切。游藝節目以名票清唱爲最受來賓歡迎。事先曾約定程君謀。蔣君稼。荀慧生諸君。不幸程病足。蔣返里。而荀君以是晚適演全本玉堂春。八時半即須上場。故七時許親來道賀後。怱怱别去。是晚操琴者係海上胡琴票友汪若其。劉璧麟兩君。斵輪老手。引起一片彩聲。尤爲生色。八時許清唱開始。先由施秀文女士唱御碑亭原板西皮二段。歌喉朗潤。韻味醇厚。繼爲閔翠英女士唱六月雪探監摇板。亦凄楚動人。馬直山之翠屏山。吳憇南之戰太平。朱麗文之汾河灣。李華圃之空城計。鄂吕弓之烏盆計。或以嗓亮見長。或以噴口取勝。美不勝指。言菊朋歌洪洋洞原板一段。抑揚頓挫。畢竟不同凡響。一段甫畢。再來一個之聲不絶於耳。結果再歌摇板數句始罷。陳姨閎夫人之崑曲問病。雅韻欲流。余空我之法門寺。爲西皮慢板轉二六一節。歌來沉着有致。馬淑芬女士之駡殿一大段二黄到底不懈。足見功候巳深。最後爲周劍雲及胡蝶女士梁賽珍女士合唱梅龍鎮四平調。歌來宛轉如意。悅耳可聽。殿以錢瑞甫之魚藏劍。學叔岩唱法維妙維肖。殊非易易。直至十一時許始盡歡而散。</p>

<p>十五日。近來波羅奈發生回敎印度敎衝突事。相鬥數日。死者六七十。傷者二百。其原因蓋由查外國貨。印人排英貨不許售。回人有售英貨者。被人所殺。疑爲印人。以致大衝突。波羅奈爲極太平之聖地。出此怪象。與英人以口實。蓋向來各地均有印回衝突之事。惟此地爲無有。乃竟出此。殊可怪歎。但余前此經過一次。睹其現象。巳覺非佳兆。今竟死傷如此之多。亦甘地運動之大障礙也。是日余在回敎學生會講演。其學生室每人一房。寛大清潔。印度每日上課在十時至下午三時。回敎學生會亦有敎頭率領禮告。自陽歷正月二十至二月二十。此一月中回敎爲白日斷食節。白日斷食者。其回民每日晨在四時以前。可一食。在下午五時以後至夜可食二次。而白日斷食。印人曾以爲異。余問之回友。曰斷食有數長。一可去病。二可知貧入之狀况。三若遇非常危險。可以練習抵抗。此斷食之意也。余意其敎主當初用兵時。當更困難。大抵多夜食而晝戰。故遂習以爲常。永作紀念耳。夜食晝戰。最宜於用兵也。噫。人生最難。余語回友各敎主。不過三條路。一爲被人殺。若耶穌上十字架。二爲殺人。若穆罕默三爲逃跑。若佛老。是也上無好路也。殺人與被殺。同一不得巳耳。</p>
<p>十六日英人弗侖克加定夫婦請飯。因晤數拉尼。有曾遊中國者。加定介紹數美人。同余往美國農村美女西姆處。過一長鐵橋。可半英里。此橋之費蓋甚大矣。橋分三路。上下兩層。火車大車人車各通行無碍。此河即恒河也。此處恒河水清。不若加巿之濁。每念恒河。輒憶楞嚴經波斯王母事矣。得詩一章如下。昔讀楞嚴經。今見恒河水。曾有大覺仙。藉此證妙旨。天邊明月照。千江如鏡裏。水流月影移。今月非昔比。水月等變滅。何况皮骨髓。惟念慈母恩。永遠不忘耳。母化去殺機。報恩從此始。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良對於這天真爛漫的夫人，竟没有法子對付，做學校敎師的自巳，在課堂上勞動了六天，今天星期日，總該休息休息，睡得遲一點了：那知伊偏偏來鬧得睡不成，說伊是無智識呢？伊總算也在初中畢過業的，不過伊生性頑皮，子良自巳覺得雖做了一個敎育家，竟不能感化自巳最親密的夫人，實在是慚愧！</p>
<p>「你不是前幾天說過的麽？星期日領我出去玩？」</p>
<p>「領你出去玩？到什麽地方去？」</p>
<p>子良一時想不起來。</p>
<p>「你說領我去學習游泳，到虹口游泳塲去啊！</p>
<p>他一想，話是有這麽一句的；但是想起來了，今天可不行，較裏不過再有五六天，就要放暑假了，我有三班的作文，共計一百六十幾篇，要趁今天一天的工夫，把它改好的了，再遲恐來不及。子良想到這裏，倒也不高興再睡了。今天一天，改這麽一百六十多篇作文，未必能夠改完，倒不如早些下床罷。他打定主意，便跳下床來，夫人一見，也跟將下來。</p>
<p>「這就對了！你聽得領我去游泳，就肯不睡，這便是一隻很好的黑漆板凳！」</p>
<p>「不！今天我没有工夫，要改卷子咧。」</p>
<p>「不領我去麽？等我呌别的男子領去，你就要搶着同我去了！」</p>
<p>子良也没聽得夫人的話，他穿好了衣服，下樓去了。月如也即忙下樓，竈間裹的娘姨，見主人主婦，一起下來了，幸虧他早把洗臉水預好，就端了一盆洗臉水，送出來，放在桌子上，子良便過去洗臉，不料夫人把他一推：</p>
<p>「人家夫婦相敬如賓，你怎麽相敬如兵，動手搶了？今天我先起身，這盆洗臉水是我的！」</p>
<p>良見伊去洗臉，自巳便去漱口，到第二盆水送來，他再洗臉。</p>

<p>— 曼引</p>
<p>林競著</p>
<p>無論爲鞏固國防、免日俄英各帝國主義之侵略計、爲解决内地失業衆多、貧苦益甚的民衆們底生活計、移民實邊、實爲目前刻不容緩的事、我們能眼看日本之覇佔東三省、俄人之赤化外蒙、英人之唆使西藏叛變、這些驚心動魄的事實發生不思有以抵制之嗎、能眼看内地兵災匪患、民生日蹙、而放着大好的邊地、如吉林之森林、阿爾泰之金礦、外蒙之畜牧、新疆之煤油、讓别人開採而不過問嗎、只要我們是人、熱血還在沸騰、呼吸還在進出的時候、在内地、我們找不着出路的青年、失業的羣衆、應該作大規模的有組織的團體到邊地去、同時、我們政府應該盡保護的全責、安送我們移民團到那兒去、我們要認定、只有這、才是唯一的救濟我們底困苦的方法、只有這、才是我們真正的出路、</p>
<p>上面一段話、是一個巳經往西北去考查了的朋友寫給我的信、我相信他這些話是對的、我更相信他的這種勇往直前的精神是一定能得到成功的、因爲相信他是對的、羡慕他、佩服他、使我也發生步他後塵的野心、所以近些時我對於中國邊地的事情、特别感覺到有興趣、對於關於邊地的著作特别搜羅、或借或買、須然錢是來得那麽不容易、</p>
<p>在我所搜集到的百數十種關於我國邊地的書籍後、不覺發生一種無名的悲哀、使我心痛、就是在這些書中、凡比較詳細準確一點的、大半是從外國翻譯過來、如英人查理斯氏一人就著了三大厚册論到西藏的地勢、道路、風俗、人情、社會制度、政治、經濟等的書、此外日本之於我滿蒙著作、也不是我們中國同胞所能望及、自巳的産業、不能好好保守、而任别人來暗算、被暗算者還是暈暈然、如釜中魚、優哉遊哉一點也不知道禍患的到來京在目前、天下最可悲痛的事、孰有甚於此者、</p>
<p>然而在最近、這種由於同胞們疏忽邊地、使我悲痛的事實却减少了一點、　、我們不得不感謝林競先生著的這本　　　編的出世、</p>
<p>林先生是位旅行家、可以說是中國最早能以科學的方法、政治的眼光注意到西北邊地問題的一個、我從朋友口中知道他是抱着「人棄我取」的態度去做他所認爲要做的事、即如就移民實地、開發西北等問題說、在現今算是高唱入雲的時髦調、然而在十五年前林先生却早巳注意到、而且會行遍西北、這、我們能不說他是開發西北的先覺者嗎、</p>
<p>「具二百三十八萬方英里、居全國七分之四之廣土、藴五行百産之精英、爲歷史文化之起點、江河之所源、萬山之所始、膴膴焉宜牧也、蕩蕩焉宜農也、轄歐亞之中樞、具天然之原料、則宜工而宜商焉、至於强鄰窺伺、世界之爭端隱藏、種敎紛岐、國家之安所繫、此非今日西北之現象乎、然舉之以示國人、知之者、有幾人哉、知之而潛然以思、謀所以闢大荒、探寳篋、而圖爲不朽之業者有幾人哉、有之、其能不治絲而愈棼、求福而轉禍者又有幾人哉、…嗟呼、大好河山、化爲修羅之塲、無辜黎庶、盡成刀爼之肉、豈理數之當然、抑人事有未盡也、…」（頁一自序）</p>
<p>從這、我們可以知道他丨本書著者之抱負與對於西北問題之感覺有興趣、因爲眼光卓越、感覺西北問題於中國丨大而至於全世界之重要、所以他才不辭在那素被人目爲冰天雪地、滿目荒凉的塞外去追尋採求、本書就是他將親身所歷的沿途各地之氣候地勢、土壤、風俗、人情…「從冰天雪地中呵成寫成的、」由此、我們可以相信是確實的記載、與現今之侈談西北而竟足未履西北者不同、</p>
<p>全書分上下兩編、（上編日記、計分八卷、第一卷、民國五年、由北京經豫·陜·甘·至迪化、第二卷、民國六年由迪化經天山南路及阿爾泰、西伯利亞至北京、第三卷、由北京經察。綏·寗夏·甘肅·至迪化、第四卷由迪化經内外蒙古至北京、第五卷、民國十四年由北京經察·綏·寗夏·甘肅至青海、第六卷民國十五·十六·十七三年駐青海記、第七卷、民國十六年環遊青海記、第八卷民國十七年由青海至上海、以上八卷、共編爲六册、第一第二第五第六各爲一册、第三第四合編一册、字數共計約八十萬言、照片約一百五十張、」（見例言一）</p>
<p>八卷、八十萬言、這是一個如令人可驚的巨大的數目、姑勿論其内容、僅白紙塗黑字也不是一時得寫成功的、現在只出版第三第四卷合編一册、下面介紹的就是這兩卷、</p>
<p>上面曾說過第三卷是記由北京經察·綏·甘·等地而達迪化、第四卷是由迪化經内、外蒙而返北京的路程、兩卷共約二十餘萬言、足見材料之豐富、均係日記體裁寫成、讀時雖覺有點枯燥、然而我們着眼的是在開發西北、調查、考察西北的情形方面、而並不是像讀文字作品、要求在文字上辭句上美麗、新鮮、</p>
<p>這裏爲便於介紹起見、我們可以把每一卷分作幾部份來說、</p>
<p>第三卷、（A）從北京至包頭、費時自民七年十一月十三日至十二月十一日、除由京乘火車至豐鎮八百零八里外、從豐鎮至包頭中經天成村、毫起、石人灣、畢克齊鎮、陶思浩、薩隆齊縣、計長華里六百七十、自北京至此長華里一四七八、（B）從包頭至寗夏、費時自十二月十二日至次年一月六日、中經哈拉補達、各加爾氣、姜白店、拍土、補隆·隆興長、熊萬庫、何家栅、中國堂、廣慶遠、常家、磴口、河拐子、二子地、石嘴子平羅縣、計程華里一二零八、（C）從寗夏至蘭州、費時自一月七日至二十一日、中經楊合堡、大壩、渠口壩、石空、中衛、沙頭壩、長流水、乾塘子、營盤水、一條山、達拉拜、六墩、水阜河、計長華里九零五、（D）從蘭州至肅州、費時自二月八日至三月十九日、中經朱家井、鹹水河、平番縣、公口驛、龍溝堡、雙搭堡、凉州、四十里舖、永昌縣、水泉驛、新河堡、東樂縣、張掖縣、沙河堡、高台縣、花墻堡、池鹽堡、臨水驛、酒泉縣、計程一四六八華里、（E）從肅州至哈密費時自二月二十至四月十四、中經嘉谷關、惠回堡、赤金峽、玉門縣、三道溝、布隆吉爾、小宛驛、安西縣、白墩子、紅柳園、大泉、馬蓮井、星星峽、沙泉驛、苦水驛、格子烟墩、長流水、黄蘆罔、計程一三六二華里、（F）從哈密至迪化、費時自四月十五至五月二十二、中經頭堡、三堡、三道嶺、瞭墩、一碗泉、七箇井、頭水、大石頭、三箇泉、木壘河、奇台、孚遠縣、三台、阜康縣、古牧地、計程一四二零華里、總共從北京至迪化費時約半年、（途中躭擱時在内）共華里七八四二里、</p>
<p>第四卷、（一）從新疆奇台至蒙古下</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>白墩子、費時自六月七日至十七日、中經東成渠、紅柳井、芨芨湖、黑山頭、拐壩水、鍋底山、專金、計程七百三十里、（二）經下白墩子至札木善丹、費時自六月十八至二十七日、中經五户、鎮西縣、地窖舖、亂山子、老爺廟、柳泉、横山子、計程七○○里、（三）從札木善丹至索廟、費時自六月二十七日至七月八日、中經哈拉迭令、甲會、夾拉孟、索莫達、大駝類、計程七二五里、（四）從索紅圖至甲兒　罕寵頭、費時自七月九日至十八日、中經黑沙圖、嚆爆、哈喇牛墩、雪海、計程六二五里、（五）從甲兒罕龍頭至章毛　哈喇托羅蓋、費時自七月十九日至三十日、中經閃單、丁該胡同、達拉烏蘇、小奎籐、錫把、腦海圖、計程六六八里、（六）從章毛至歸化、費時自七月三十日至八月十五日中經依克布拉、見耶和沙、錫拉哈達、烏拉布拉、哈沙圖錫、拉毛招利、計程九九六里、共計程四四四○里、費時約二月、</p>
<p>從述這些實地裏旅行的地點數目的統計看來、靠着北方那種十八世紀的交通器具丨駱馬本書著者車能將西北重要道路遊遍盡盡、我們能不佩服他的忍苦耐勞、向前進的精神、我們讀這本書之後、對於西北的情形、應該怎樣慨嘆平素對於西北之忽視而現今應當怎樣注意呵在篇幅上、第三卷比第四卷要多、這是因爲從北平經察綏、寗、甘至新疆沿途一帶較由新疆經蒙古至歸化爲重要、前一條路、差不是經過很肥沃的地域、舉凡風俗、人情、政治、經濟、值得我們注視與討論、非後者多半是一些弋壁、無人烟的地方可比、所以著者叙述特多、給與我們認識西北的一切情形、如道路、氣候、地勢、以及其他人民的風俗、習慣、古跡的歷史等等、我們認爲是十分明瞭而又扼要、</p>
<p>其次、對於西北之富源、也有詳細調查與叙述、這裏不能多引原文、只就散見於書中的簡約幾點說一說、</p>
<p>（一）從豐鎮經五原包頭至新疆一帶、沿頭的煤礦、差不多到處都是、</p>
<p>（二）肅州甘州等一帶、産金最著名、</p>
<p>（二）甘肅薩拉齊縣之地毯、新疆古城之森林、及其他各地畜牧、</p>
<p>（四）凉州、肅州五原等地之農産、如豆、麥、棉花……</p>
<p>總之、在内地所認爲肥沃之土地、在西北並不缺少、而因人烟稀少、地價便宜較内地低至百數十倍尤不止、我們未至西北者、轍目西北爲荒野的塞外、現在看本書中的叙述、能無動於心乎、</p>
<p>在書尾還附有查勘甘新路意見書、西北國道路線計屋書、調查包頭附近水陸交通情形意見書等重要論文多篇、帮助我們對開發西北應有的工作、準備、努力的認識、更十分明瞭扼要、在没有發顯比更詳細討論、調查西北的著作以前的現在、我認爲本書是唯一的詳細的論到西北的書籍、</p>
<p>最後、記者個人誠懇地致敬意於本書著者及送閱本書的趙君、爲他們使我得未去西北以先對西北有較詳細的認識</p>
<h3 id="c325">青春散記 <a href="#c325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— 憶華</p>
<p>聯合書店出版</p>
<p>學校的生活是一個美麗的夢、這夢給你許多的甜蜜、深刻的愛戀、假使你没有闖進過學校的門檻、也許你祇有一些空幻的夢想、然而實際的内幕却是十倍於你、所夢想到的一切、尤其是大學生的生活、大學是一所神秘之宫、種種不能夢想到的趣味的故事在創造、美麗的故事在扮演、大學生是天生的驕子、他們憑籍着青春的時代、享樂那美麗的夢境、不是那些故事的主翁、便是那些趣劇的主角、至少是一個觀劇的看客罷、許多美趣的痕迹都深印在他們的腦膜、時常呼喊着珍惜他們特有的青春、</p>
<p>本書的作者是曾經陶醉在這種夢境裏的幸福者、我在許久的以前就讀到了他的作品、知道他是一個佔領大學生生活的幸福者、</p>
<p>他是一個長於詩、小說的作者、去年的秋天讀過他的詩集「香吻」、今春又讀到遇他的創作集「三對愛人兒」、最近又讀了這一本小品集「青春散記、當我每次讀着他的作品時、總會感覺到售逸幽默的趣味洋溢着、</p>
<p>作者的詩與小說固是我所愛讀者、但我覺得他的特長尤其是寫小品、他的小品文有他獨特的美艶而芳郁的風格、取材是人生最美麗的一段、筆調是醉人靈魄的空靈與輕巧、這樣的小品文是小品文中很值得注意諷誦、「青春散記」中的每一節都是這一類充滿着幽默、旖旎、暗示的短記、實在是一本很好的小品文集、</p>
<p>全書分成三篇、上篇是「淡月散記」、包含「凝是玉人來」等二十節、中篇是「嫩風散記」、包含「姑娘留下的」等十五節、下篇是「細雨散記」、包含有「求婚之信」等十節、這裏所叙述的大都是旖旎風光的學校生活、關於男的、女的、敎員的、學生的、「例如月到中秋分外明是寫校外生活、而一曲滿江紅却記述敎室内的韻事、姑娘留下的寫過度飄亮的姑娘、阿正傳却給你廻然不同的滋味、多情却被無情惱以男子追逐女性爲典型、然追求則表示姑娘們也同樣地在追逐男子、他又能運用史事來描寫摩登、如杜甫的愛人、鬧宫、痴注、也能如在烏衣菴口曾相識、讓摩登融在舊的詩句裏、有時、他在嬉皮笑臉地說什麽雪中突圍記、但他也重視戀愛道德、撰戀愛道德小論」、（黄衫序裏的話）這書的每一節中、我們可以窺見種種值得眷戀與羡慕的美妙的遺蹟、愛與力是充滿着内容的事實、這題材是異常的妙盈的呀、</p>
<p>至於他的獨特的筆調、也可在黄衫序文裏指出的幾段中看出他的空靈、幽默、暗示、旖旎、例如、</p>
<p>「忽然」、電燈捺暗了、是誰捺的、丨不知道也許歡喜坐在暗室裏看淡月銀光嗎、也許是使誰也看不出誰的臉紅嗎」、在動情處未曾描的那節裏的這一段、可作筆調空臨的例子、又如媚眼盈盈處的一段可作幽默和暗示的例、「蔡女士本來帶笑的、現在更露着齒、又擲下一朶花、丨又搶她索性的把所有的花擲下來、但不再搶了、賣花女郎唱好了歌乘隻空籃」、</p>
<p>再如、「當你的愛情找不到歸宿時、覺得在宇宙裏個姑娘都有迷人的媚態、從姑娘的身上、全是美麗的色、全是清幽的音、眼波是淡綠色、面龐是嫩紅、髮髻誰也知道是烏油的、每句話都含着誘人與柔意」、這是多麽的旖旎呢、</p>
<p>在上面的幾段裏、我們可以看到作者的筆調與風格的一般、但是内容的實在還不能顯示出、因爲篇幅的關係、不能把整節的抄上一節、使讀者得覘見一斑、但是即使没有把他抄上、給諸位領略一個大概、然而諸位假如歡喜知道些關於大學生活的一般、我認爲值得買一本來看看的、如黄你是大學中的一員、那你更須捧讀一下、你可以知道你的見聞是否有作者那麽的廣、又可以發現你的生活圈中尚有這樣的美的事蹟點綴着、</p>

<p>The Central Propaganda Department Appeals to Comrades for Bandit Suppression</p>

<p>On the 25th, the Central Propaganda Department issued an appeal to comrades for the suppression of Red bandits. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The greatest disaster facing our country at present, and the greatest suffering of the people in various places, is the Red bandits' burning, killing, raping, and looting. In the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, villages and towns are in ruins, land is barren, and starving people fill the roads. The wounds</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>are everywhere. In the past, we heard about the great calamities of roaming bandits, but they were never as cruel as this. The reason why construction projects cannot proceed and ambitious warlords are eager to move is all due to the Red bandits' disturbances. The success or failure of the national revolution's progress to this stage depends entirely on whether we can fundamentally eliminate the Red bandits. Therefore, our most urgent task at present is to concentrate our efforts to suppress the Red bandits who specialize in burning, killing, and looting. The Central Government is well aware that the Red disaster is the source of the people's suffering and is related to the success or failure of the revolution. Therefore, although it has been suppressing rebellious warlords for many years, it has never slightly abandoned the work of suppressing bandits. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of last year resolved to make the eradication of communism and the suppression of bandits the primary policy agenda for this year, it has spared no effort in carrying out bandit suppression. The Red bandits in Hunan and Hubei provinces have gradually diminished after being heavily surrounded and suppressed, but they are cunning by nature and constantly flee and hide, coercing farmers and resisting stubbornly with danger. Furthermore, the sudden outbreak of the Guangdong Incident gave the remnant bandits a chance to catch their breath, causing the embers of the dying to rekindle their hopes. Our party takes the relief of the people's difficulties as its responsibility and is deeply saddened by the spread of bandit disasters. Therefore, it has stepped up its supervision of the government, mobilized large armies, and vowed to fundamentally eliminate the Red disaster in Hunan and Jiangxi in the shortest possible time with the greatest determination and effort. On this day of joint efforts to suppress the Red bandits, all our comrades must have a deep understanding and effort.</p>
<p>The direct commanders of the Red bandits are the Chinese Communist Party, and indirectly the Red Russian imperialism. Their methods are vicious and their conspiracies are dangerous, which are not comparable to ordinary bandits. The reason why the Red bandits desperately disrupt order and destroy society is to satisfy their own greed and to exchange for the rewards of Red Russian imperialism. Red Russia uses the Red bandits' burning and killing to make China a chaotic and broken country in order to fulfill its ambitions of aggression and annexation. Therefore, the existence and spread of the Red bandits are the source of all internal and external troubles in our country. Suppressing the Red bandits is to curb Red Russia's aggression and the Communist Party's poisoning, which is also the fundamental way to eliminate internal and external troubles. This is one. In recent years, the Red bandits have wantonly carried out burning and killing. It is not known how many hundreds of thousands of our compatriots have died. It is also not known how many hundreds of thousands of villages and towns have been burned and looted. According to statistics, there are more than two hundred counties in the country that have been affected by the Red disaster, and there are also many places where the disaster is latent and worrying. If it is not quickly extinguished, the spread of the disaster will be endless. Therefore, the Red bandits' tyranny is by no means a disaster confined to Hunan and Jiangxi, but a common disaster for the people of the whole country. The people of Hunan and Jiangxi should work hard to suppress the Red bandits to seek self-salvation, while the people of all provinces should think about the disasters and take precautions, and jointly bear the responsibility of suppressing the Red bandits to rescue the affected compatriots. This is two.</p>
<p>The reason why the Red bandits have gathered more and more people and gradually become a major disaster is that the farmers' lives are difficult and their knowledge is weak, which makes them easily seduced and coerced by the Red bandits. Furthermore, the local bandits and hooligans, who share the same interests, have joined forces, so the bandit forces have spread wider and wider, causing more and more harm. Today, the important task of suppressing bandits is to encircle and suppress them to eliminate their leaders and to appease the coerced farmers to reduce their violence. On the other hand, we should start with fundamental relief, pacify the countryside, and improve the farmers' lives to cut off the firewood under the pot. The government can only handle the major issues, and the responsibility of publicity and assistance rests on the shoulders of all our comrades. This is three.</p>
<p>The reason why bandit suppression has not been easy to achieve in the past is that it has been difficult to concentrate all efforts on the work of bandit suppression due to the years of suppressing warlords. Furthermore, the people lack strong organizations and cannot actively assist the government to achieve the effectiveness of joint cooperation. Due to these two major weaknesses, the progress of bandit suppression work has inevitably been greatly affected. Therefore, in order to ensure the smooth progress of bandit suppression military affairs in the future, it is necessary to awaken the people and establish sound group organizations, so that the party, government, military, and people are thoroughly linked, and the fundamental elimination of the Red bandits can be achieved in the shortest possible time. This is four.</p>
<p>Regarding the fundamental methods of suppressing Red bandits, the National Conference also has five instructions: (1) We must deeply understand the harm and crimes of the Red bandits. (2) We must cut off the circulation of Red bandit thoughts, speeches, and publications. (3) If young men and women are confused by the Red bandits and fall into the wrong path, their parents or school authorities must be responsible for correcting and restraining them. (4) Producers in rural and urban areas must seek mutual benefits based on the principles of labor-capital mutual assistance and cooperation. (5) In the bandit suppression areas, each person must cooperate with the county government to carry out Baojia [household registration system], clear the countryside, and assist in the aftermath of bandit suppression. Therefore, comrades in bandit areas must investigate and report bandit parties, detect bandit traces, handle transportation, and engage in Red bandit suppression propaganda when the national army is suppressing Red bandits. When carrying out the cleaning of the countryside in the local area, we should investigate the remnant bandits and prevent them from lurking. After the bandits are eliminated, we should work with the government to handle the aftermath, relieve refugees, restore order, and organize defense, etc. Comrades in non-bandit areas should strive to publicize the meaning and achievements of our party's doctrine, political training, and construction to fundamentally curb the root of Red bandit incitement and cultivate the people's courage and strength to protect and defend themselves. In particular, we should use practical and effective methods to improve the livelihood of farmers and workers and guide young people on the right track.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are all necessary efforts to complete the bandit suppression work and fundamentally eliminate the Red disaster. I hope that all comrades in the country, personnel, will take responsibility and work together with the government, army, and people to eliminate the Red bandits in the shortest possible time. Then, the people's suffering can be relieved, social order can be restored, and the promotion of political training and construction and the guarantee of peaceful unification will all depend on this.

<p>The Opium Suppression Committee and related agencies discussed the scientific method of eliminating opium. In addition to setting up investigation offices in five provinces, they will still crack down on opium smoking, morphine use, and heroin addiction in various places in accordance with the law, striving to achieve the goal of eliminating it within six years. The investigation offices should proceed in accordance with the principle of reducing it year by year. As for the personnel of the investigation offices in the five provinces, they will be freely appointed by the directors of each office. It is not necessarily guaranteed that there will be no abuses, but the committee will correct them at any time. As for opium smokers in various counties and cities, the police should still exercise their powers and handle them in accordance with the law. As for Li Muqing's concurrent position as Director of the Special Tax Office in Hubei, it is for the convenience of fact, because the investigation in Wuhan is more comprehensive, and Yichang is the necessary route for Sichuan soil. Investigation between Wuhan and Yichang can achieve effective results in opium suppression. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Ji Yiqiao stated in a talk on the current situation that since the Guangdong Incident, rumors have arisen repeatedly. All the generals in North China deeply understand the righteousness, follow the Vice Commander, advocate peace, and unanimously support the Central Government. Since the reorganization of the armies last year, the generals have absolutely obeyed the Vice Commander. The Jin army's salaries have been settled and they can train with peace of mind. The Central Government has agreed to allocate 200,000 to the Vice Commander every month to subsidize Shi Yousan's troops, starting in May, and it will be distributed at the same time as Jin, Sui, Song, and Pang. The headquarters will also send personnel to count and distribute the funds. Shi Yousan's troops remain in their original defense areas and there will be no transfers. Song Zheyuan sends telegrams from time to time to report on the defense situation. Recently, there was a telegram inquiring about the Vice Commander's illness, which stated that his army had been stationed in southern Jin Province since last year and had relied on Your Excellency to maintain it to this day. He is determined to take Your Excellency's will as his will and obey his orders, and his character will remain unchanged. Pang Bingxun's troops are currently stationed in the Qin County area of southern Jin Province. He often sends telegrams to Ping to inquire about the Vice Commander's well-being. Pang is loyal, honest, and sincere, and he values credibility very much. I have a deep friendship with him. He often expresses his obedience to the Vice Commander and his unwavering support. The Vice Commander and the generals of the Northeast also attach great importance to him. Sun Dianying's troops are currently stationed in the Jincheng area. Sun is known for his courage and loyalty and expresses his extreme obedience to the Vice Commander. The Vice Commander has fully recovered from his illness. His temperature and pulse have returned to normal, and his spirits are excellent, but he still needs to rest. The Gan Red bandits can be quelled in the shortest possible time under the personal suppression of the Commander-in-Chief. The factions in Guangdong are complex, but a peaceful resolution will soon be reached. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e41">France Has Replied to the American Plan <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Although the contents of France's reply to the American debt moratorium plan have not been made public, according to those who are familiar with the contents of the reply, France has conditionally accepted it, reserving two points: one, that Germany and other creditor countries should clearly acknowledge that the Young Plan cannot be abandoned; and two, that unconditional reparations must still be allocated annually, which is generally not much different from what was expected in yesterday's telegram. The American president is naturally not satisfied with France's reply. The American telegram stated that if France does not agree, the United States intends to delay the plan in order to place the responsibility for the breakdown on France. Although this is a temporary outburst of anger in the American public opinion, it also shows that a satisfactory solution to this matter will require some consultation. Within France, there are also political tides at play. Those who oppose the current government are trying to use this issue to exploit public sentiment to overthrow Briand, and it is not as easy as the straightforward promise of Britain and Italy. Therefore, it is still necessary to expend a lot of effort to make several sincere contacts. The American government has now dispatched Secretary of the Treasury Mellon, who is in England, to France to negotiate nearby. The German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister are also said to be going to France for consultation, as was the precedent of the German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister going to England last time. The French authorities must also visit Germany in return. The rift between Germany and France can be gradually eliminated. In fact, Germany's economic situation is already on the verge of danger and it is necessary to find a way to maintain it. The American President's debt moratorium plan is not only beneficial to Germany, but its impact reaches the financial world of the whole world. Therefore, other countries are willing to sacrifice to support the American President's plan. Under this situation, although France has various internal difficulties, it is foreseeable that it will eventually strive to reach a consensus.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Stimson formally declared today that the broad outline of President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debts for one year will not be abandoned. After Stimson made this statement, the French ambassador to the United States delivered the French government's reply. White House sources say that responses from all parties to President Hoover's proposal are arriving steadily, with very little opposition. Political circles are unwilling to criticize the French reply or hastily disclose its contents. The Italian ambassador to the United States reported to the State Department that Italy fully accepts the U.S. President's proposal without any political reservations.</p>
<h3 id="e95">National News Agency, Paris, 24th <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The French response to President Hoover's proposal, after being revised by the cabinet on Wednesday, was delivered to the U.S. Ambassador that afternoon. The contents of the response will not be known until it is released on Friday, but what is already expected is that the French answer is only a conditional acceptance. According to those familiar with the contents of the response, France has proposed two reservations: one is that Germany and its creditor nations should clearly acknowledge that the Young Plan cannot be abandoned, and the other is that unconditional annuities must still be allocated annually. In general, according to the two reservations proposed by France, the debt moratorium in France's mind is not much different from the reparations moratorium in the Young Plan. However, the Young Plan still had the hope of allowing Germany to rest for two years, while France's current plan only allows Germany to rest for one year. Currently, the French public is already dissatisfied with the coercive actions of the United States, calling it an American dictatorial plan that is incompatible with France's purpose of exercising arbitration in Europe. Therefore, the current cabinet's policy is built on this kind of public sentiment in order to eliminate political turmoil. It is said that if Congress is convened on Tuesday, the current cabinet may fail and dissolve. Even today, public sentiment is still extremely high, saying that Briand and his colleagues' sleepiness has been caught once again.</p>

<p>U.S. President Hoover and his advisors, State Department officials, and Treasury experts are meticulously studying the French reply today, and have dispatched Treasury Secretary Mellon as a representative to go to France for negotiations. Mellon, who was visiting his son in England, has already departed for France. It is expected that if Mellon cannot get the French to fully accept the U.S. President's proposal, he will negotiate a compromise solution. The U.S. response to the French government is being drafted, and it is expected that its wording will indicate that the U.S. government finds it inconvenient to accept a counter-proposal. If France cannot agree, the Ministry of ______ plans to implement ______ to place the responsibility for the disruption on the French side. After the U.S. government received the French reply today, Secretary of State Stimson met with the British Ambassador, and then went to the White House with the Undersecretary of the Treasury and the British Ambassador to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>Italy's opinion on the U.S. President's proposal to suspend debt payments can be found in Prime Minister Mussolini's recent telegram to the Italian Ambassador to the United States. In that telegram, Mussolini said that he sincerely approves of the American proposal and that the realization of the U.S. President's plan will surely bring about a new era of cooperation in the international community, which is urgently needed by the world. Mussolini also instructed the Ambassador to the United States to first express his welcome to the U.S. government and to state that he will soon draft a written opinion on implementing the Hoover Plan and submit it to the U.S. government. It is expected that his opinion will fully comply with President Hoover's plan.</p>

<p>After France sent its reply to the U.S. President's telegram regarding the moratorium on reparations payments, the German Ambassador to France visited Briand at the German Foreign Ministry. It is rumored that the discussion concerned the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister's plans to come to Paris to discuss everything with the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, and that the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister would then visit Germany in return. This follows the example of the recent face-to-face talks between the British and German authorities. However, between France and Germany, this type of diplomatic exchange is the first of its kind since the war.</p>

<p>There are two important pieces of news today related to the progress of President Hoover's proposal, which are the focus of commentary from all sides. One is Secretary of State Stimson's statement that the U.S. President's proposal is based on far-reaching principles and cannot be abandoned. He also said that there has already been great progress, but because the matter is of great importance, there are many details that need to be carefully studied and thoroughly discussed with all relevant countries before a decision can be made. He also solemnly declared that governments are exchanging views through normal diplomatic channels, indirectly denying the rumor that a meeting on suspending war debts will be convened in Washington in the coming days. The other is that a semi-official French news agency has indicated that the German Chancellor Brüning's proposal for frank consultation with the French authorities is expected to be realized soon. It is currently believed here that if this can be realized, it will be before the first week of July.</p>

<p>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden announced in the House of Commons today that the British government is willing to implement President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debts in both spirit and letter. He also said that although this proposal does not directly involve the war debts owed to Britain by overseas autonomous territories and India, the British government has allowed them to defer the payment of all war debts for one year starting from July 1st. This move will reduce the British government's current budget by £11 million. Leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties both spoke in favor of the government's policy of handling this matter.</p>

<p>Today, the US President, through an executive order, announced an increase in import tariffs on egg powder, from 18 cents to 27 cents per pound. Among various egg powder suppliers in the US market, China accounts for the largest share. The US egg powder industry and poultry farming industry have been campaigning for tax increases for a long time to counter this. However, the bread industry and confectionery industry have also launched opposing campaigns. Ultimately, the egg powder industry prevailed, resulting in today's order.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Wu Tiecheng's Visit to Harbin <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Congratulating Zhang Jinghui on his Birthday</p>
<p>Visiting Zhang Xueliang, Who is Ill</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Mr. Wu Tiecheng arrived in Harbin from Beijing at 8:05 AM on the 19th, along with his wife, representing Commander-in-Chief Chiang to congratulate Zhang Jinghui on his birthday. Zhang Jinghui, upon hearing the news, personally went to the station with his wife to welcome them. Other military and political figures from the special region also came to greet them. Originally, the Jilin Governor's Office was prepared as a temporary residence, but Wu declined and instead stayed at the Modern Hotel. A birthday celebration was held for Zhang on the 19th. In the afternoon, he inspected the city's Party Department and offered encouragement to all the staff on behalf of the Central Party Department. At 11:00 PM on the 20th, he traveled to Liaoning with Zhang Jinghui and other key figures from the special region to participate in the third anniversary memorial ceremony for the late Grand Marshal. The reporter visited Wu at noon on that day, inquiring about the solution to the Guangdong issue and the situation of the Jiangxi bandits. His reply was as follows: "I have come north this time to visit Deputy Commander Zhang, who is ill, and also to participate in the birthday celebration for Governor Zhang here and the third anniversary memorial ceremony for the late Grand Marshal Zhang. I made a special trip to participate. I will stay in Liaoning for one day and then travel to Beiping to visit Deputy Commander Zhang. The central government advocates a peaceful resolution to the Guangdong issue. Party disputes should be handled internally by the party itself. The comrades in Guangdong also share this sentiment. Mr. Zhang Puquan recently returned from Guangzhou, and according to his report, there is indeed hope for a peaceful resolution. The peace resolution plans previously reported in the newspapers were not conditions proposed by Guangdong, but rather the methods pre-planned by the central government. The future path to resolution will be no different from this. At the same time, the central government believes that the current pressing problem is not the Guangdong issue but the Jiangxi bandits, so it has decided to concentrate its efforts to eliminate them. The Commander-in-Chief will soon depart for Jiangxi. The military plan roughly divides into left and right wings, advancing together and detouring to form a large encirclement. Recently, the Jiangxi bandits have shown signs of fleeing into western Fujian, and that area is also on high alert. Mr. Hu (Hanmin) will soon be sent to the United States by order of the central government for an inspection, and he is expected to leave the country within a month. As for whether Mr. Li (Jishen) will join the Central Committee, I have been away from Beijing for many days and am not yet aware." (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e115">Searching for the Remains of Cai Gongshi in Jinan <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Excavating the Backyard of the Former Diplomatic Office</p>
<p>Only Found Burial Mats and Bayonets</p>
<p>The Remains of Cai and Others Have Not Yet Been Found</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: During the Jinan May 3rd Incident in 1928, Cai Gongshi and others were brutally murdered by the Japanese at the former Diplomatic Office. The location of their remains is difficult to determine, but many suspect that they are still within the grounds of the former Diplomatic Office. It is believed that Cai Gongshi and others were killed in the backyard of the former Diplomatic Office, in the southwest corner where workers used to extract soil from a pit, and were buried in that pit, wrapped in straw mats. Now, three years later, Cai Gongshi's wife, Ms. Guo Jingluan, has come to Jinan. Following a resolution by the Preparatory Committee for the Memorial of the May 3rd Martyrs, the backyard was purchased for 20,000 yuan, and it was decided to excavate the southwest corner of the backyard today (the 24th) to search for the bones of Cai Gongshi and others, in order to request the central government to bury them with national honors and comfort the loyal souls. Han Chunru, a former worker at the Diplomatic Office, found ten workers: Liu Xingtang, Liu Xingwen, Wang Yanchen, Han Fulu, Han Defu, Hu San, Hu Chenggui, Hu Shiwang, Zhang Decheng, and Zhang Fusheng, who began excavation at 7:00 AM this morning. Han Chunru directed the work, and Ms. Cai Gongshi, along with her brother Guo Ruheng, and Wang Zengrong, a descendant of Wang Delu, who died at the same time as Cai, were present to supervise. Two policemen were also present for protection. As a result of the excavation, about two feet into the soil, the straw mats and ropes used to wrap the bodies on that day were found, but they were already rotten. The bones of Cai Gongshi and the other martyrs could not be found. Further down was the original hard soil, and no further excavation was carried out, proving that the corpses of Cai and others had already been transported away by the Japanese at the time. It was also found that the Japanese had opened a small moon gate in the back of the garden, which had been blocked. The empty space outside the moon gate was thought to be the place where the Japanese transported the corpses on that day. As the southwest corner yielded nothing, Mrs. Cai ordered the workers to search and dig elsewhere in the garden, but the work was not completed by evening. According to Han Chunru, the Japanese army wrapped the corpses in straw mats and buried them in the backyard at the time. Now, after excavation, only the rotten straw mats and a bayonet and a saddle were found. It was also found that when the Japanese army withdrew from Jinan, they transported away a corpse. It is unknown whether this was the body of the late Cai. Now, even the other corpses are nowhere to be found, which is quite unexpected. Mrs. Cai also told people that after the Japanese army occupied Shandong for a year, after the Japanese army withdrew, the owner of the backyard, Zhang Shuheng, rented the house to the Japanese again. The Japanese renting this house was for a special purpose. Three years have passed since the May 3rd Incident, and any traces could have been eliminated. Since the authorities could not protect this place when the Japanese army first withdrew, and the owner of the house, Zhang Shuheng, rented it to the Japanese, the Chinese people's weak sense of national shame can be said to have reached its extreme. I am now only doing my best, it would be good if we find them, if we don't, there is nothing we can do, she said, her words filled with indignation. (24th)</p>
<p>[P] Shandong Province Plans to Dredge the Jiaolai River</p>
<p>The Canal Engineering Bureau Surveys the River's Topography</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaolai River runs vertically through eastern Shandong, flowing south into Jiaozhou Bay and north into Laizhou Bay. It was a dredged waterway during the Yuan Dynasty. The Shandong Construction Department believes that the river has been neglected for many years, causing the riverbed to be silted up, resulting in floods during the summer and autumn. It is imperative to dredge it to promote benefits and eliminate harm. Therefore, in the spring of this year, the Canal Engineering Bureau was instructed to conduct a survey and prepare a plan for dredging. The Canal Engineering Bureau has now completed the survey and is preparing a written report. The report contains detailed information on the main stream, tributaries, riverbed, flow rate, water volume, water level, soil quality, rainfall, ice period, current navigation status, embankments, bridges, estuary conditions, transportation conditions, and the past and present observations of industry and commerce. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e116">River Conditions <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>(1) Main Stream: The Jiaolai River originates in the foothills northeast of Pingdu County, flowing southwest for more than seventy li to the watershed west of Chaijia Village and east of Xiqiu, where it divides into east and west flows. From the source to the watershed, it is called the Baisha River. After the division, the water flowing east and turning south is called the Jiaolai South River, about one hundred li long, and the water flowing west and turning north is called the Jiaolai North River, about two hundred li long. Because the river flows south into the Jiaozhou area and north into the Laizhou area, it is collectively called the Jiaolai River. This river was initially a natural waterway, specifically draining mountain floods and rainstorms from Yexian, Pingdu, Changyi, Gao and Jiaozhou Counties. Statistically, the river is only three hundred li long, but it can accommodate the water from more than seventy tributaries, running north and south. This natural topography is indeed a valuable waterway. Therefore, during the Yuan Dynasty, it was dredged for transporting grain, connecting the southern provinces of the Jiangnan region, reaching the northern sea from the South China Sea, and all the way to Yanjing, becoming a major shortcut for maritime transport. Since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the Grand Canal has been connected, but this has not been taken into account, so the repair and treatment have been abandoned. Today, the riverbanks have been encroached upon by farmland, narrowing the riverbed, and the middle reaches have been silted up due to flooding, making the riverbed shallower. Nearby villages have repeatedly suffered from floods, and the annual autumn harvest is often submerged. It has lost its benefits and is instead suffering harm, which is lamentable. If dredging is carried out sooner rather than later, the harm will be eliminated and the benefits will be promoted. (2) Tributaries: There are a total of seventy-two tributaries. The larger ones are recorded as follows: (A) Those flowing into the Jiaolai South River include the Xiaoqing River, Jiao River, Xiaoyuan River, Zhushui River, Zhucun River, Dagu River, and the tributary Bigou River. (B) Those flowing into the Jiaolai North River include the Xian River and its tributary, the Wulong River, Liujia River, Qinwang River, Liugou Water, Yinma River, Qingquan River, Shuangshan River, Mei River, and Yaoshi River. The widest tributaries are fifty meters wide, and the narrowest are more than ten meters wide. The water is low in spring and winter, and high in summer and autumn.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Embankments and Bridges <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The embankments have been neglected for many years, with two or three out of ten damaged. Five or six out of ten have been leveled into farmland, but traces can still be found. No more than one or two out of ten still exist. The widest embankment base is five or six meters, the top is two or three meters wide, and the height is one or two meters. Observing the distance between the two embankments, they could accommodate even large floods in the past. Today, the embankments are completely damaged, and flooding is inevitable. There are more than forty bridges in total. The larger ones include the six-hole railway bridge of the Jiaoji Railway in Ligezhuang in the southern section, which is fifty-eight meters long, and the wooden bridge on the Yanwei Road in Xinhe Town in the northern section, which is over two hundred meters long. The largest one is the stone bridge in Xinhe Town, with one hundred and thirty holes and a length of three hundred and forty-three meters, which is a large project.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Estuary Conditions <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>(1) South Sea Estuary: Where the river flows into the sea, it is generally divided into three branches, each branch being about three hundred meters wide. Where the two branches mix and enter the sea, they are more than one thousand meters wide, with depths varying from five or six meters to seven or eight meters. There has not been much change in the river channel, but there is a sandbar between the two branches, about twenty li long and about five li wide. (2) North Sea Estuary: Where the river flows into the sea, it is about five hundred meters wide and more than one meter deep. The river channel has shifted eastward, about twenty li from the Hutouan estuary. There are silt beaches where the river flows into the sea, with a width of about five or six li and a length of about twenty li along both sides of the coast.</p>
<h3 id="e119">River Relationships <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>(1) Flood Damage: There are hundreds of villages along the river, with dense populations and fertile land. The agricultural products are suitable for five grains, and there are coal mineral resources. However, because the river is in disrepair, the area within a few li to twenty or thirty li on both sides of the river often becomes a swamp whenever there is a flood. (2) Overview of Industry and Commerce: According to the locals, it is said that during the period of transportation in ancient times, the major villages and towns along the river were commercially prosperous, and goods gathered at the north and south sea estuaries. Today, it is unusually deserted. There are only salt beaches and fishing boats at the estuaries, and the industry and commerce in the villages and towns along the river cannot develop due to the stagnation of transportation. (3) Overview of Transportation: Water and land vessels cannot travel smoothly along the river. Although there is the Ligezhuang railway bridge on land, the Jiaoji Railway train passes through it, and the Xinhe Town wooden bridge allows the Yanwei Road vehicles to pass through it, which is not related to the river's transportation. If the waterway is open, it can benefit each other. (4) Views of Residents Along the River: When surveying, the villagers along the river were all overjoyed to hear about the dredging news, saying that they had suffered from floods for many years and could not bear it. If dredged, hundreds of hectares of fertile land could be expected to have a harvest, and hundreds of thousands of people could engage in industry and commerce, and the people along the river could live in peace.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the report also stated that according to the survey, the Jiaolai River has the value of connecting the north and south and saving maritime transportation. Once construction is completed, transportation will be convenient, and commerce will develop, which cannot be limited. The relationship between national economy and people's livelihood is extremely important and significant. The Panama and Suez Canals will reappear in China. Looking at the current situation of the entire river, the advantages and disadvantages each have two. One advantage is that the river is between the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, with a natural topography. The other advantage is that the river was originally artificially dredged, with a neat river channel. One disadvantage is that it has been neglected for many years, and the river channel is silted up, causing flooding whenever there are mountain floods and rainstorms. The other disadvantage is that there are sandbar silt beaches at the two sea estuaries, which urgently need to be dredged.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Twenty-Five Counties in Jiangbei Conscript Labor to Dredge Rivers <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Each County Should Open More Than One Hundred Li of Waterways</p>
<p>The Construction Department Allocates 100,000 Yuan for Conscripted Labor Expenses</p>
<p>The waterways in the counties north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province are silted up and prone to disasters. Local officials and people have the desire to open up waterways to facilitate storage and drainage, but they lack funds and good methods, so they have not been able to implement it. Recently, the Construction Department has been working hard on water conservancy projects and has formulated nine articles of regulations for conscripting labor to dredge rivers and several implementing details, and allocated 100,000 yuan for conscripting labor expenses. The Provincial Government Committee's 409th meeting passed the resolution. It is now heard that the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has been actively preparing and will send engineering personnel to various counties in Jiangbei to survey and plan, expecting to start construction uniformly this winter. It is learned that the contents of the proposal by Sun Hongzhe, the director of the Construction Department, for conscripting labor to dredge rivers are as follows: "The waterways in the counties north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province are not repaired, and droughts and floods occur frequently. When discussing governance, their eyes are all focused on dredging the Huai River, Yishushui, and other major rivers. The crux of the problem is certainly important, but the project is huge and requires a lot of funds, making it difficult to realize. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining and financial resources are scarce, if we want to achieve quick results and easy implementation, there is no better method than conscripting labor in various counties to open up silted waterways. In the past, this department, in view of the severe drought disasters in the counties north of the Jiangsu Province and the counties under the jurisdiction of Xuzhou and Haizhou, ordered 21 counties, including Yancheng, to conscript laborers to engage in river dredging. However, the local financial resources were insufficient, and there was no way to raise funds for conscripting labor. Years have passed, and little effect has been seen. The Construction Department's responsibility lies in this, and we dare not continue to follow this path of inaction. We have now formulated regulations for conscripting labor to dredge rivers and implementing details, and plan to conduct a pilot project in 25 counties in the four prefectures of Huaibei, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, and Haizhou, to take into account and plan for both the people's sentiments and material resources. As for the business expenses for this conscripted labor to open rivers, we plan to temporarily use the transportation and taxation of land in the 25 counties in Jiangbei. When the full province's five-point water conservancy land taxation is levied in the future, it will be returned first. The taxation of land transportation is a special fund and cannot be borrowed from. However, looking at the numbers remitted to the department from various counties over the past few years, they are becoming increasingly short. The reasons for this are nothing more than frequent local droughts and floods, poor autumn harvests, and people displaced and unable to pay the tax. In addition, officials and people in various counties use excuses to retain and divert funds for other purposes. Although personnel have been sent repeatedly to urge strict enforcement, it is not a fundamental solution. We believe that the waterways in the counties north of the Yangtze River are directly or indirectly related to the Grand Canal. When the conscripted labor is completed in the future, storage and drainage will be suitable, harvests will be abundant, and local officials and people will have no reason to retain the surplus of land tax. The future of transportation is greatly improved. Borrowing for emergency use at this time does not go against the original intention of levied transportation. All of the reasons for this department's plan to conscript labor to dredge rivers in 25 counties in Jiangbei are summarized, along with the conscription regulations and implementing details, and a document is submitted for public resolution."</p>

<p>At the northern end of Anting Town, the eighth district of the county, there is a highway that is an essential road for the daily travel of the people in the towns and villages. The two sides of the road belong to Xiaoxing Hall Tian. Last spring, Zhang Yucang of Xiaoxing Hall opened up a garden and set up a bamboo fence around a section of the road, obstructing traffic. The people of the towns and villages requested the town head to transfer the request to the superior authorities to legally ban it. After the county government sent personnel to survey and ordered the demolition several times, the traffic was restored for only a short time. Zhang Yucang still believes that the highway is private property and has filed a lawsuit with the judicial authorities. The judgment has not yet been made. It is now heard that Ge and others have jointly filed a complaint with the county government. It is not known how it will be resolved in the future.</p>

<p>With low cloud cover and occasional showers, today's Wimbledon tennis matches were only held on the Centre Court and Court No. 1. The men's singles has entered the third week of competition, with only sixteen players remaining. The atmosphere is becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Two More Japanese Players Eliminated <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the third week, two Japanese players were eliminated. Kawachi and Miki both lost. Only Sato Jiro remains. France's Boussus defeated Kawachi 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. France's Borotra defeated Miki 6-4, 6-1, 6-2. Boussus's chops and endurance overcame Kawachi's long rallies. Boussus often hit the ball to both sides. At the beginning of the second set, Boussus took a 4-1 lead. Kawachi relied entirely on his serve, but it was to no avail. Miki's battle was also tragic, defending the baseline with long rallies, but he was always blocked and smashed by Borotra at the net. Miki's backhand gave Borotra some trouble. In the third set, he repeatedly faulted on his second serve. In the end, he still lost decisively.</p>

<p>Japan's Sato Jiro's victory over India's Mohan was very interesting. The score was 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. Sato's fierce serve was initially blocked by Mohan, but his net play was unstoppable. In the second set, Mohan changed shoes due to the slippery ground, but Sato did not care and continued to run as he pleased. Mohan also dropped his racket, but it was to no avail. Sato won very easily.</p>

<p>Suppression of Communists in Jiangxi - Simultaneous Military and Political Advances</p>
<p>Fujian Province's Finances Will Be Unsustainable</p>
<p>Guangdong's Troubles Will Not Lead to Military Conflict</p>
<p>Chen Will Go to Fujian to Comfort Lu and Liu</p>
<p>According to Riri Fu, Central Committee member Chen Zhaoying was ordered by Chairman Chiang to go to Fujian to comfort Generals Liu Heding and Lu Xingbang, and to discuss urgent plans such as preventing the Communists from fleeing into Fujian. He is currently staying in Shanghai for a few days. Yesterday, Chen made an important speech to a Riri Fu reporter regarding the current situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e174">Suppression of the Communists Plan <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang's suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi aims to completely eliminate them in the shortest possible time. The plan has been divided into two routes, military and political, to be carried out simultaneously.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Central Committee Members Depart <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>In this suppression of the Communists, not only will all the generals and soldiers lead their troops on a long expedition, but also civil officials will bear important missions. Before Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Jiangxi, he stipulated a plan that all Central Committee members, except for the elderly who remained in Nanjing, would set off for various places. Their sole task is to supervise and order the local just gentlemen to unite and work together, using local forces as a backup for the government. Since the Communist bandits ravaged the area, the respected elders in the area have been influenced by the Communist bandits, believing that all the respected figures in the area, regardless of their character, must be regarded as local tyrants and evil gentry, causing the local gentry not to dare to show their faces. The social center of gravity has therefore been overthrown. The task of the current departure of the Central Committee members is to judge right and wrong in the local area, and to distinguish between black and white. If they are indeed respected figures in the village, no matter what, they must be invited to come out and take on local work and fulfill a part of their responsibility for the local area. If they are local bullies, they should be eradicated, so as to restore the local center of gravity.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Fujian Province Finances <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Fujian Province's financial difficulties have reached an extreme point. This is because the local area is barren and revenue is very small. Recently, even the provincial government's food expenses have been difficult to pay, which is heartbreaking to say. If the central government does not provide a follow-up solution, it will inevitably become unsustainable. Recently, although 500,000 treasury bonds have been issued, it is only a drop in the bucket and only provides temporary relief. It is still not a long-term solution, and the merchants and people are unable to bear the burden due to poverty. Before the Fifth Plenary Session, Chairman Yang Shuzhuang went to Nanjing and had a discussion with Finance Minister Song. It has been heard that there is some progress.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Guangdong Matters <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Chen also told the Riri Fu reporter that the Guangdong matters will definitely not lead to military conflict. It is entirely a party dispute and must of course be resolved within the party. Zhang Puquan's trip to Guangdong to mediate has been quite successful. The central government is like an older brother, and Guangdong and Chen are like younger brothers. If the older brother makes a slight mistake, the younger brothers should do their best to persuade him. If the younger brothers have irregular actions, the older brother should also correct them. In short, this matter can be understood by each other, and it will not lead to major conflict.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Current Situation of Communists in Jiangxi <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Communists in Jiangxi are most rampant under Zhu, Mao, Peng, He, etc. However, the people have been tired of the chaos for a long time. The Communist bandits initially used the beautiful names of not paying grain and not paying taxes to lure the ignorant people. As a result, the masses responded. After occupying a place, they established Soviet governments everywhere, repeatedly distributing rice to the people, and the people had no choice but to obey. Their losses were indeed immeasurable compared to paying grain and taxes. Therefore, the people who have been ravaged by the Communist bandits all said that they would rather pay grain and taxes than be ruled by the Communist bandits. They are now eager for the arrival of the central army. Therefore, this suppression of the Communists will definitely be able to clarify the situation in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Date of Departure for Fujian <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then asked Chen when he would go to Fujian. Chen replied that he was scheduled to go to Fujian next Wednesday on the Wanchang ship. The task there, in addition to comforting Liu and Lu, would be to go to Zhang Zhen's place and discuss the plan to prevent the Communists. Because the Communist bandits in Jiangxi, after hearing that the central government was personally征, could not help but be胆寒. They have now shrunk their range, and one part has fled into Fujian, and one part has fallen into Zixi and fled to Zhejiang. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss with Liu and others the plan to jointly prevent the spread of the Communist bandits, and to prevent them from crossing the Zhejiang province's Leichi. Otherwise, it will not be a minor problem. It is heard that Chen discussed various issues in Fujian Province with Navy Minister Yang Shuzhuang yesterday afternoon. At that time, he may have to go to Fujian with Yang at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Chen Shaokuan's Remarks <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>According to Riri Fu, Navy Acting Minister Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. A Riri Fu reporter specially visited Chen at the Jiangnan Shipyard and asked about the navy's plans and various issues regarding the current situation. He gave detailed answers. The main points are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e181">Two New Large Warships Built <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of consolidating the maritime defenses, in January of this year, the Ministry sent Chief of General Affairs Li Shijia to Japan to order a 3,000-ton warship from the Harima Shipyard, costing 4.23 million Japanese yen. It is now named Ninghai. The construction project is quite rapid. It is scheduled to be launched in Japan on Double Ten Day this year. I will personally attend the ceremony at that time. It is expected to be fully completed around April of next year and will be shipped to China for use. Another Pinghai warship is being built at the Jiangnan Shipyard, the same size as the ship ordered in Japan. The construction materials and hull drawings have all been completed. The keel is scheduled to be laid on the 28th of this month (i.e., Sunday), and it will also be completed in the winter of next year.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Fujian Province Is as Peaceful as Ever <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Because the territory of Fujian Province is a gathering of mountains and forests, it has always been a breeding ground for bandits. Peng Dehuai's bandits fled into Fujian Province from the Jiangxi border a month ago and had some contact with Liu Heding's division, but they were quickly suppressed. What is being spread outside is not true. The maritime defenses of Fujian Province are now exceptionally strong. There are currently warships such as Hai Rong and Ying Rui distributed in the Majiang and Zhongzhou areas. All parts of the province are as peaceful as ever.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Yang Plans to Go to Hangzhou for Quiet Recuperation <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Minister Yang Shuzhuang, due to years of heavy administrative duties, has been working hard, resulting in the recurrence of his old cough with blood disease. Now that all the finances of Fujian Province have been handled properly, and the provincial committee members Chen Peikun, etc., have all returned to Fujian, there are no more difficult problems in the Fujian Province administration. Yang plans to take the opportunity to go to Hangzhou for recuperation in order to restore his health.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Continuing to Recruit Naval Students <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Since the construction of the Xiangshan Naval Academy began, the foundation work has been completed. Formal construction will begin in the coming days, with an estimated cost of around 100,000 yuan. It is expected to be completed at this time next year, and then 300-400 naval students will be recruited in order to train talents for the Chinese Navy. The 96 new students recruited the other day have now been sent to the Mawei Naval Academy, with a five-year graduation period. In the future, they may transfer to the Xiangshan New Military Academy.</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Navy Vice Minister and Jiangnan Shipyard Director Chen Shaokuan originally planned to depart with Chairman Chiang, but since Chiang went directly to Nanchang, he did not go with him. He returned to Shanghai by train yesterday. A reporter met him at the shipyard and conducted the following interview: (Q) Will Minister Yang return to Fujian? (A) Undecided. (Q) Feng Yipei has passed away. It is said that Yu Jishi will fill the position of Guard Division Commander. Have you heard of this? (A) Commander Feng has passed away due to overwork, which is deeply regrettable. I was not in Nanjing when the decision of who would take over his vacant position was made, so I do not know. (Q) When will the remaining torpedo boats in Shanghai conduct maneuvers in Xiangshan? (A) The torpedo boat fleet anchored in Shanghai port, consisting of eight ships including Yuzhang, Hupeng, Hu'e, Huying, Husun, Chenzi, Zhangzi, and Liezi, all set sail together at 6:20 AM this morning. Commander Zeng Yiding was on board the Yuzhang. The Jiankang and Suzi torpedo boats need some more repairs and will follow at a later date. The maneuvers are scheduled for two or three weeks, after which they will return to their posts. (Q) How was the trial run of the Ziqiang warship today? (A) The Navy's Ziqiang warship was converted from the Jianwei warship. Construction began on January 15th of this year, lasting only six months. It set sail for the Minhang area at 7:00 AM yesterday for trials. The average speed at its peak was 15.5 nautical miles. The hull is sturdy, and it is agile in forward and reverse. After the trial, it returned to Gaochang Temple at 11:30 AM to await assignment. This ship and the Datong warship, formerly known as Jianan, which was converted last year, are sister ships. The Datong took 12 months and cost over 400,000 yuan to complete successfully. Now, the Ziqiang's repair time and cost are only half that of the Datong, but the results are even better. (Q) When will you return to Nanjing? (A) After I have taken care of the matters at hand, I will also have to go to Xiangshan, first to inspect the naval academy being built there, and secondly to observe the torpedo boat fleet's maneuvers. (Q) Which warship will you take to Ningbo? (A) It will be the Yixian warship, which is about to return to duty. The internal work on the Yixian will be completed soon, and it will set sail at the latest on July 1st. After the inspection is complete, I will return directly to Nanjing. With that, I took my leave.</p>

<p>Jiang Guangnai, commander of the 59th Division of the 19th Army, has been working too hard recently in commanding the army to suppress the Communists in Jiangxi. He has been granted a leave of absence of several weeks by the Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanchang on the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Yesterday (25th), he finally entered a certain hospital in western Shanghai for treatment. According to those around him, Jiang is suffering from overwork and coughing.</p>

<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in Early July</p>
<p>Bei Songsun, the Chinese representative who attended the Sixth International Chamber of Commerce Congress on May 4th of this year, went to the United States and the United Kingdom to discuss everything with the financial community regarding the silver decline problem after the Congress closed. He originally planned to return to China on the 15th of this month, but was slightly delayed due to some matters. According to banking circles, Bei has already left England and is returning to China, and it is expected that he will arrive in Shanghai in early next month.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Mr. Pittman Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>U.S. Envoy Johnson Visited Him Yesterday for Talks</p>
<p>He Will Leave Shanghai for Home Early Next Month</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Pittman, who came to China earlier to investigate silver prices, and his wife, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin the night before last (the 24th) at approximately 11:00 PM. Yesterday afternoon at 4:20 PM, the U.S. Minister to China, Mr. Johnson, paid a special visit to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund for a meeting lasting about 30 minutes. It is said that Mr. Pittman will leave Shanghai to return home early next month.</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, after returning to Shanghai from Beiping last night, U.S. Senator Pittman told people that an international silver conference would certainly be convened soon. He strongly supports the U.S. President's proposal to postpone war debt repayments and will fully support it, as he has long held this view and even has more progressive proposals. The gold and silver problems of the world must be resolved, and especially should be resolved quickly. He does not want to set a silver price or a gold-silver ratio, but only to agree on a method of relief so that we are not again fooled by a lack of a definitive method. Of the bankers and financiers he met on his way in Beijing and Pingjin, 90% supported the international silver conference as the only way to alleviate the current crisis. Senator Smoot in Washington is no longer as eager to hold an informal meeting as he used to be, because in the coming weeks, many people will change their attitude towards the silver conference. Empty words are useless. If there is no meeting with executive power, we might as well remain silent. Today, people in the world no longer regard local conditions as more important than the global economic downturn. There are three main reasons for the global economic downturn: (1) Uneven distribution of gold currency, (2) Inability to obtain gold currency, and (3) Frequent destruction of silver coins. India's failure to join other countries in seeking relief has made the precarious situation even more profound. India is the main cause of the oversupply of silver, which makes it impossible for other silver-producing countries to stop production.</p>
<p>Six organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the International Trade Association, and the International Chamber of Commerce branch, met yesterday to discuss welcome arrangements. They have agreed to hold a public banquet for Mr. Pittman at the Bankers' Association on the 30th of this month. At the same time, they are preparing to study Mr. Pittman's findings from his recent trip to the north and discuss the procedures for convening an international silver conference.</p>

<p>Formally Moving into the Bureau's Address at No. 6 Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau, which was established by the Ministry of Communications, has been fully prepared since Director Xi Dingmo reported on its preparations. It will formally move into the bureau's address at No. 6 Sichuan Road today and begin operations. It will be formally established on July 1. According to Director Xi's statement to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday regarding the internal organization and the preparation of branch offices, the details are recorded separately below.</p>

<p>The Navigation Administration Bureau is divided into two sections. The first section is responsible for general affairs such as accounting and general administration. The second section is responsible for specialized affairs such as ship inspection, registration, and measurement. There is a technical office with one director and eight technicians to assist the director in handling specialized work matters. There is also a secretary to handle various documents.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau's management area includes the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The Wuhu area of Anhui originally had a ship inspection office. Since the Ministry of Communications announced the establishment of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau, it sent representatives to contact the Shanghai Bureau. Yesterday, the Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications to immediately prepare branch offices in necessary places in the three provinces to facilitate operations. Therefore, Director Xi decided to set up branch offices in Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, Wuhu in Anhui, and Ningbo in Zhejiang, starting today, so that management can be more closely managed.</p>

<p>The Dispute Between Chinese and Foreign Vessels on the Sichuan River is Intensifying</p>
<p>Chinese Ships on the Upper Yangtze River Cease Operations</p>
<h3 id="e197">Yichang-Chongqing Chinese Ships Not Sailing <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Since the 5th of this month, foreign merchant ships joined the Merchant Shipping Association, obtained transportation rights, and announced a doubling of freight rates. When foreign ships of British, Japanese, and American origin drastically reduced their freight rates, Sichuan merchants refused to load goods because Chinese ships refused to agree to price reductions. After the 6th of this month, Sichuan merchants could not bear the exploitation of foreign ships, and requested that the eight Chinese ships reduce their freight rates to counteract the foreign merchants. After discussions, the Chinese ships recognized that they were financially weak and could not compete with the oppression of foreign merchants. They refused the merchants' requests and decided to abandon sailing between Yichang and Chongqing. Chinese ships on the Yichang-Chongqing route have completely stopped operations.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Foreign Ships Further Reduce Freight Rates <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>From June 6, the freight rate for Yichang-Chongqing cotton yarn increased from two taels per piece to six taels. The freight rate for general merchandise increased to 30 taels per ton. Merchants in Yichang and Chongqing were shocked by this notice and held an emergency meeting, unanimously rejecting these freight rates. They also opposed all eleven measures announced by the various foreign ships, such as direct-run ships and half-loaded ships. The Sichuan General Chamber of Commerce and other organizations published reasons for their opposition. On the 16th, British, Japanese, and American foreign merchants also held an emergency meeting and decided to temporarily reduce the Yichang-Chongqing freight rate by one-third, allowing a charge of four taels per piece. The freight rate for cotton yarn and general merchandise was also reduced to 20 taels per ton to ease the opposition of Sichuan merchants and consolidate the foothold of Sichuan river shipping. They also agreed to cancel the previously set eleven measures.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Chinese Ships Change Route to Yichang <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Two Chinese ships on the Sichuan River have already ceased operations. The remaining ships decided to retreat and avoid the upper reaches section, which foreign merchants are fully operating and seizing. Chinese ships will not go there automatically and will change their route to below Yichang and direct to Shanghai. After the decision, the freight rates on this route were also reduced together. The freight rate for foreign cloth was usually 8 taels, 3 mace, and 5 candareens per piece, but is now changed to 6 taels and 4 mace. The freight rate for cotton yarn was usually 7 taels, 7 mace, and 4 candareens per piece, but is now changed to 5 taels and 9 mace and 5 candareens. The freight rate for other miscellaneous items is reduced by 30%. Therefore, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are completely dominated by foreign ships.</p>

<h3 id="e213">The Guangxin Association Telegraphs Request for Swift Suppression of the Red Bandits in Eastern Jiangxi <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The Guangxin Seven Counties Association sends a fast mail telegram to General Commander Jiang in Nanchang: Eastern Jiangxi is unfortunate. The Communist bandits Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, Wang Mingui, Zou Qi, etc., have wantonly ravaged it for five years. Countless people have been brutally killed and houses have been burned. The painful and tragic situation is unbearable to describe. This time, Your Excellency led hundreds of thousands of patriotic soldiers to Jiangxi to rescue the people from disaster. Upon hearing this news from the depths of our suffering, we could not help but rejoice and be moved to tears. Reports say that Your Excellency has arrived in Jiangxi Province and has a comprehensive plan to solve everything. The corner of eastern Jiangxi is adjacent to the three provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and its importance is self-evident. However, there is a limited garrison in eastern Jiangxi at present. The strength is weak. It is more than enough to defend, but there are concerns about taking care of one thing and losing sight of another in the suppression. Yesterday, refugees from Hekou said that the garrison in Hekou had captured many Red bandits in the last ten days, including Sun and Su. After interrogation, they confessed that after the bandit leader Fang Zhimin sneaked back to his old nest from Fujian, he planned to use force to go from Guige to Qian, Rao, Guang, and Yu, in order to connect with Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui. Currently, the seven counties are in great terror because of this. It is like a catastrophe is imminent and life is insecure. However, after checking the bandits' loose talk, it is not without effect, but the people who have suffered from the Red disaster for a long time are naturally like startled birds. In addition, seeing that the defending forces are not sufficient to cope, even the grass and trees on Mount Baigong seem like soldiers. Now, fortunately, Your Excellency, with a heart that regards the hunger and drowning of others as your own, braved the heat to come to Jiangxi to solve the suffering. At this critical moment, we earnestly request Your Excellency to grant our request, draw up elite troops as much as possible, and quickly open up eastern Jiangxi to avoid the long-suffering people from falling into the red terror again. If this area is not ground into powder, the Party and the country will be very fortunate, and eastern Jiangxi will be very fortunate. We cannot bear to wait impatiently. The Guangxin Seven Counties Association in Shanghai kowtows. Respectfully.</p>

<p>The Negotiation Committee Submitted a Request for Negotiation</p>
<p>Manufacturers and Employees All Decided to Petition</p>
<p>In the case of the National Products Department Store being ordered to close by the Public Concession, the Municipal Government has made a serious representation.

<h3 id="e216">Submitting a Request for Negotiation <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The National Products Department Store Negotiation Committee submitted a document to the Central Party Department of the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating, "This is a submission for a request. It has been found that the Chinese National Products United Department Store was illegally closed by the Public Concession's Public Works Department on June 9 of this year, and employees were beaten and arrested. The various acts of brutality have been respectfully reported to your departments, requesting a serious protest. Although the Shanghai Municipal Government's protest and the assistance of various organizations have repeatedly negotiated, there has been no progress. Who is without a heart and cannot be indignant? Therefore, in recent days, the excitement of the Shanghai citizens, the unanimity of the public sentiment, all have the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and the spirit of peaceful struggle. They will not give up until their goal is achieved. In addition to the seven conditions decided by the affiliated association for negotiation, regarding the various points of the Public Works Department violating the agreement and infringing upon legal rights, we have to rely on your departments to lead the public and not be successful, but still give strict protests to take away their spirit and chill their courage. All the negotiation process and seven measures of the affiliated association should be presented together for review and implementation. This is both public morality and convenience. Respectfully presented."</p>

<h3 id="e219">The YMCA Initiates an Inspection of Sanmen Bay <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The Inspection Group is Scheduled to Travel</p>
<p>Sanmen Bay is located in the south of Xiangshan in Ningbo, Zhejiang, and north of Wenzhou. It is shaped like a gourd mouth and is extremely important. It is rich in products and convenient for transportation. It is a natural commercial port. The area has had an important history in ancient times. In recent decades, knowledgeable people in our country have repeatedly sought to revitalize it, but they have failed due to economic and human constraints. Recently, Xu Tingzuo, Wang Gechen, Fang Youdu, Xu Xinfu, etc., have raised funds to operate, and have registered with the National Government. Therefore, no less than thousands and hundreds of people have invested in the area. The docks and warehouses have been completed, and roads and various industries are also being built in order. The local YMCA believes that this move is a fundamental construction for the people's livelihood and can adjust both capital and talent. Therefore, it has decided to invite industrial experts from Shanghai and Hangzhou to hold a research meeting at the YMCA on Sichuan Road at 3:00 PM on the 29th and 30th of this month, and to continue to travel to Sanmen Bay from July 9 to 16 for field inspections. The YMCA welcomes anyone who is determined to revitalize industry, as well as experts in water conservancy, reclamation, animal husbandry, engineering, and manufacturing, and has printed brochures available upon request.</p>

<p>Most Stores Sold Leftover Meat Yesterday</p>
<p>If the Delay Continues, It Will Be Difficult to Meet Market Demand</p>
<p>The nine fresh pork shops in the city, including Changyuan, and all their employees, stopped business due to the butchers' failed attempt to force the purchase of fresh pork and the beating of employees. After the Bureau of Social Affairs sent personnel to persuade them, they resumed business that night. However, more than a thousand butchers throughout the city went on strike again yesterday. The various situations yesterday are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Truth of the Beating <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 23rd, when the Xuejia浜 fresh pork market was opening, a butcher named Zhang Xiaogen wanted to buy a pig from Changyuan pork shop and insisted on deducting three catties. Liang Anmin, an employee of the shop, agreed to deduct two catties. Later, another butcher bought it. Then another butcher, without asking the reason, punched Mr. Liang of the shop. Butcher Zhang was stabbed in the leg with scissors. The patrolman Kou Yuxi asked Shao Yunqing to take them to the First Sub-Station of the First District of the Public Security Bureau. After questioning by the director, because both sides requested to be transferred to the court, they were immediately transferred to the local court for processing.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Authorities Investigate <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Because the pork shop employees were forced to buy fresh pork by the butchers, which led to the pork shop employees going on strike, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs immediately sent staff member Gu Bingyuan to persuade them to resume work first and wait for the arrest of the perpetrators according to law. Unexpectedly, after the pork shop employees resumed work, the butchers went on strike again. Yesterday, Zhu Guilin was sent again to conduct a strict investigation to verify and handle the matter. In addition to sending police patrols, Xu Su, the director of the First Sub-Station of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, personally went to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Pig Trade Resumes Operations <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The nine fresh pig businesses in Xuejia浜, Changyuan, Shengyuan, Yuanda, Chunyuan, Yuhe, Changshun, Changhe, Rundda, etc., after butchers attempted to force the purchase of fresh pigs without success and gathered a crowd to beat up staff, insisted that the perpetrators be punished and refused to open for business. All the staff, because of the butchers' violent behavior, also dared not proceed with weighing the goods. All the fresh pig porters, in support of the staff, went on strike on the 24th, stopping the transport of goods. Fortunately, after the Society Bureau dispatched staff member Gu Bingyuan to mediate, the pig business staff and porters resumed operations and weighing and transporting goods at 6 PM that evening.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Butcher Strike <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Butchers from Xinzha Road Su Xi Abattoir, Ninghai Abattoir, Yuezhou Road Juxing Abattoir, Zhabei Shenghe Abattoir, Xuejia浜 Chengxiang Abattoir, French Municipal Council Abattoir, Jiaxing Road Renyuan Abattoir, etc., went on strike yesterday morning due to a conflict between Zhang Xiaogen, a worker at Wanxing Abattoir, and partners of the Changyuan Pig Business, ceasing to transport pigs to the market and slaughter them. As a result, the usually bustling Xuejia浜 market is now unusually quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Meat Market Panic <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>More than 20 fresh meat merchants in the Public Concession, French Concession, South Shanghai, and Zhabei, deeply concerned about not being able to procure goods due to the pig business shutdown the previous day, rushed to the market that evening upon hearing of the resumption of operations to purchase goods. Unexpectedly, the butchers suddenly announced a strike yesterday, so the goods purchased could not be transported to the abattoirs for slaughter. In this hot summer weather, overnight meat is not suitable for long storage. Most of the meat sold in the market today is already overnight meat. If the strike is prolonged, there may be no meat to sell tomorrow or the day after. Yesterday, a small number of fresh meat merchants went to Wusong to buy pigs in order to meet market demand. However, several businesses in the South Shanghai district had already run out of meat to sell and had to temporarily suspend operations.</p>

<p>Xie Rixin, representative of the Joint Federation of Japanese Factory Workers in Shanghai, submitted a petition stating that more than 100 Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai produce more than 300,000 bales of cotton yarn per month, and according to export tariffs, a tax of six cents is collected per bale, which could yield more than 180,000 taels per month, but it has never been collected.

<p>The Central Anti-Smoking Committee has established anti-smoking investigation offices in various provinces. The offices in various provinces have been announced one after another.

The important resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) Regarding the adoption of prohibition in the guise of taxation by the Anti-Smoking Committee and the establishment of investigation offices in various provinces, after investigating its content, it not only violates the Hague Opium Convention and the KMT platform, but also greatly violates the Premier's anti-drug instructions. The association should adhere to the public opinion of the people and the party department, and continue to oppose it to maintain the prohibition of smoking. A large number of anti-drug instructions will also be prepared and distributed to various groups so that the public can understand the Premier's solemn proposition regarding the prohibition of smoking. (2) Approval of the Anti-Drug Propaganda Association Case: After reviewing the following eleven anti-drug propaganda associations, it was resolved that certificates should be issued to those who pass the examination to encourage them.

<p>Our country should base its translation on Chinese</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association yesterday sent two letters to the Acting Secretary-General of the Public Concession Municipal Council, both regarding misunderstandings in the translation and requesting correction and attention. The original texts are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e232">Please Base the General Rate on Rent <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Sir, Your Bureau's reply No. 1098 of June 12 has been read. The basis of this association's previous letter is the land charter approved and issued by Your Bureau, the Chinese translation, and the Chinese Gazette of Your Bureau. The people of our country should follow the English as the basis, then the misunderstanding is entirely caused by Your Bureau. To avoid continued misunderstandings, Your Bureau should correct the previous errors, or other errors, in full. As for the confirmation section at the end of Your Bureau's letter, Your Bureau should still respect the custom and maintain its old practice, recognizing that rent is a major basis for rate collection. If the cost of housing increases, the rent will naturally rise accordingly. Therefore, we request that you check this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Education Expenses Incorrectly Quoted Original Letter <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Sir, Your Bureau's reply No. 56123 of June 11, regarding education expenses, has been forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Defense Area Education Research Committee for the record. However, after checking the second sentence of the third section of the reply, the translation of the original letter "Which Was Spent" does not match the original text and is very different. The original text says, "Westerners' education expenses account for the majority," and the translation does not include "Most Of" before "Whicn," which causes a major misunderstanding.

All of the federation's prepared fire engines are dispatched to the fire scene with each section whenever there is a fire in the territory, in order to protect injured people and assist in extinguishing the fire. However, because the federation's affairs were suspended last year, the engine parts of the vehicle were mostly rusted. The federation has now ordered workers to repair them again, and they could have been completed earlier. However, after investigation, it was not easy to repair and match the engine parts at one time, which caused many delays. They are currently being supervised day and night and are said to be scheduled to depart on July 1st.</p>

<p>There are thousands of people from the Su area in Shanghai.

Therefore, Zhu Xuechun, Zheng Yong, Zhou Wenji, and others jointly initiated the organization of the "Wu Society" in order to unite. They are now starting to solicit members, and as soon as the preparations are completed, they will convene a general meeting and announce its establishment.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Huiling Student Lan Jianye Commits Suicide Under Train <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Unknown Reason</p>
<p>Suicide by Lying on the Rails</p>
<p>Lan Jianye, also known as Zhiren, a native of Dabu, Guangdong, was 20 years old. He transferred from the second grade of the Singapore Overseas Chinese Middle School to the Huiling English Training School in Xinlonghua, southwest of this city, last semester. He usually worked extremely hard, and his results in the summer final exam were excellent, ranking among the top students. Principal Qian Gengzhi allowed him to graduate. Now in school summer vacation. The students have all returned home, so since yesterday, meals have been stopped. However, a small number of students from other provinces, because there are no family members in Shanghai, still remain in the school. Lan is also a member of this group, so he still lives in dormitory 303. He got up at dawn yesterday morning, washed, and went to the exercise field to exercise. At about 8:00 AM, classmates and fellow villagers Qian Shaohua and Dai Miaofa invited Lan to eat noodles at the grocery store opposite the school, but Lan excused himself because of stomach pain and did not eat. He went north alone, walking straight to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. At that time, Lan was determined to commit suicide and had a firm will. He lay on the railway 200 steps northwest of the school, head north and feet south, using the rail as a temporary pillow, lying horizontally on it. Before long, a freight train from Hangzhou to Shanghai sped by and crushed him to death under the train wheels in an instant, his body and head separated. It is obvious that Lan was determined to commit suicide. The reporter, upon hearing the news, immediately drove to the scene of the incident to investigate. The body was wearing a white shirt, a white yarn sports vest, brown trousers, white socks, and yellow rubber sneakers. The head was inside the rail, and the body was thrown under the rail. Blue blood splattered on the muddy road, which was a terrible sight. He then went to the school and met with Principal Qian, who said that the student's father was dead and his mother was still alive. His brother Jianang works in a letter of credit company in Johor Bahru, Nanyang. The mother and brother are both in their hometown, and there are no relatives in Shanghai. When he came to school last autumn, Zhou Yede, a professor at Jinan University in Zhenru, was the guarantor for the student. He has now telegraphed to inform them. Before committing suicide, there was no sign of any abnormality, so the classmates did not suspect anything else. However, this spring, he had said to fellow villagers Shi Shuangchun and Guo Liuyu (students of Jinan University), "I must commit suicide in the future, and it would be most refreshing to die on the railway. After death, please bury me in the public cemetery in Jinan University in Zhenru (most of the young students from the South Seas who died in Shanghai are buried here)." Unfortunately, it has become a prophecy. Later, the local bailiff Zhang Guansheng reported it to the court for inspection. Prosecutor Yang was appointed to go to the countryside with the inspection official to inspect the body. He verified that Lan Jianye was crushed to death by a train before his death, so he filled in the corpse form and ordered the school to collect the body and temporarily place it.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Discovery of a Huge Quantity of Opium in a Passenger's Luggage <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Li Qingzhen Goes to Claim the Seized Goods</p>
<p>Hoping to Make a Fortune</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jinpu Railway Station Master telegraphed the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, reporting that a passenger on Train No. 10 had multiple pieces of luggage containing a large quantity of opium and requested attention. Upon receiving the information, the Shanghai Bureau had the luggage thoroughly searched upon the train's arrival in Shanghai. Three large boxes of opium, weighing approximately 180 catties in total, were found in one piece of luggage. Shortly after, a man named Li Qingzhen arrived to claim the items and was detained and handed over to the Police Department. Under questioning, Li confessed that he was from Shandong and had partnered with three friends to purchase the opium in Luoyang. Hearing that Shanghai was about to levy taxes and that opium could be sold, they anticipated making a large profit and rashly engaged in this activity. However, they were misled about the prohibition of opium in Shanghai, resulting in a great loss. He pleaded for leniency. Given the large quantity of opium involved, both the person and the goods were transferred to the local court. After interrogation, Li was detained, and the drugs were confiscated, pending destruction.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Water Patrol Team Intercepts Bandit Boat <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Multiple Bandits Arrested</p>
<p>Involved in Kidnapping and Robbery Cases</p>
<p>Officer Li of the Zhabei Second Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team received a tip-off from an informant on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month that two *bang bang* boats were behaving suspiciously on the Zhenru North Head River. Officer Li led Police Chiefs Tian and Zhang, along with police officers from the Fourth District, Third Station, to investigate the aforementioned *bang bang* boats on the North City Shao River. Four people were found on board: Tao Guanghai, Tao Mao, Zhou Liangguo, and Tao Guanghai's son. During the search, Zhou Liangguo suddenly grabbed a bundle of clothes and fled ashore. After a chase, the police apprehended him. Inside the bundle were over ten pieces of clothing, sixteen pawn tickets, a ransom letter, and miscellaneous items. They were brought back to the team for interrogation. The confessions of Zhou and Tao were largely consistent. The main points were that they departed from Shanghai on April 12th with six people on board, led by Zhou Ermazi, and sailed to Baihe Port in Wujiang, where they robbed three families and kidnapped four people. They arrived in Dachang and were discovered by the militia on the fifth day of the month. They were taken, along with the stolen goods, to the Baoshan County Office. The previously stolen goods were divided into twenty-nine shares. The ransom letter was written by Zhou Haizi, Zhou Ermazi's son, who lived in Chedaijiao. Before the robberies, they had a meeting in a teahouse. There were two other accomplices, Dejun and Xue Renji, who lived behind the Dafeng Yarn Factory. Two Mauser pistols and a rifle were hidden under straw on the vacant coffin ground of the Chao Xi Bazijiao Bridge in Qibao. Officer Li inquired about previous robberies. Tao stated that on August 15th of the previous year, he had participated in a robbery outside the North Gate of Wuxi with Gao Gui and fifteen others, receiving eighty-seven yuan. After verifying the confessions, the officer dispatched police to a vacant lot in the 28th District of Qingpu, where they recovered a rifle and twenty-five bullets. Zhu Bailin, also known as Zhu Guoliang, an accomplice, was arrested in Xishi Shao, Jiangwan. His confession was similar. Yesterday, they received information that one of Zhou Ermazi's bandit boats was docked in Chedaijiao, and another was at Dayang Bridge. The police went to the locations. In Chedaijiao, they found a boat with three guards, Yang Chunshan, Huang Jinbiao, and Chen Zhenyu, who claimed to be detectives from Kunshan County and said that another boat had been sold by the detectives. Officer Li sent all the people, witnesses, and stolen goods to the main bureau for further investigation and legal action.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Two Maids of Judge Xiong Fei Disappear <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>One Is Now Found</p>
<p>Lured Away</p>
<p>The Seducer Is Sentenced</p>
<p>The Maid Is Sent to the Jiliang Institute</p>
<p>Xiong Fei, an execution judge of the Civil Division of the Special District Court, lived at No. 18 Rehe Road, near the Special Court. His two maids, Lai Fu and Lin Xi, were both nineteen years old and from Jiangxi, the same province as Judge Xiong. They suddenly disappeared simultaneously last month. Despite searching everywhere, they could not be found. As of the 14th of this month, there was still no clue. It was assumed that they had been abducted and hidden, possibly sold to other places. The case was reported to the Mixed Court, and the detectives were instructed to investigate thoroughly. Initially, there was no progress. However, the detectives of the Mixed Court received a tip-off from an informant that Lai Fu had been lured away by Shen, a Ningbo native and factory worker at the Laotongshun Cloth Factory at No. 204 Alabaster Road, and was cohabitating with him at No. 10 Wenjisi Road. The detective, along with a Western detective from No. 206, went to Shen's residence, arrested Shen, and found a pair of women's shoes but did not find Lai Fu. Upon questioning Shen, he confessed that she was at the Laotongshun Cloth Factory. They went to the factory, found Lai Fu, and brought them back to the court separately. However, the whereabouts of Lin Xi are still unknown. Yesterday morning, the detectives brought the man and woman to the Special District Court. Mrs. Deng, Judge Xiong's wife, was notified to attend the hearing. Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer representing the police, stated that Shen Annan was being prosecuted for violating Article 257, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code for disrupting a family. He stated that Shen confessed to the police that he had seen Lai Fu for the first time in January of this year at a friend's house on Rehe Road, standing alone outside the door of her master's residence. He saw her again in February, but only glanced at her. On the night of the 27th of last month, he met Lai Fu on Kaifeng Road after returning from a show at the Xin Xin Stage. He asked why she was wandering alone late at night. Lai Fu said that Lin Xi had suddenly run away on the 25th, and she had gone out to look for her without success. She also said that she did not want to return. Shen, seeing that Lai Fu did not want to return, took her to Room 11 of a small inn on Chenjiabang, Avenue Edward VII, for two nights. They then moved to the Zhongnan Hotel on Baker Road for four nights. Finding the hotel expenses too high, he rented a house on Wenjisi Road and began to cohabitate. Since two women had disappeared at the same time, and Lin Xi had not yet been found, he requested that the case be adjourned. Mrs. Xiong then described the search for the missing maid. Lai Fu testified that she ran away because Mrs. Xiong treated her poorly and that her cohabitation with Shen was voluntary. She said that she did not know about Lin Xi's escape. Shen repeated his confession at the police station and insisted that Lai Fu's cohabitation with him was voluntary and that he did not lure her. Judge Wu ruled that the case had been investigated and was not related to Lin Xi's case and did not need to be adjourned. He immediately pronounced the judgment: Shen Annan was sentenced to six months imprisonment, reduced, for enticing a woman under twenty years of age to leave the person who had parental rights over her with the intention of immoral conduct. Lai Fu was ordered to be taken back by Xiong and Deng. However, Lai Fu, fearing further abuse, declared that she would never return to her former master. The police lawyer requested that the woman be sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. After deliberation, Judge Wu decided to send Lai Fu to the Women and Children Relief Association for temporary care.</p>

<p>Mr. Kamp, an American naturalist, recently returned from an expedition to Southeast Asia, bringing with him many strangely shaped animals. The most unusual is a Turtle King, weighing about sixty pounds. Its head is like a python's. The back has thirteen large plates, each with peacock feather-like patterns. The tail is short, and the belly is white. The most noteworthy feature is that while ordinary turtles have claws on all four feet, this turtle's front two feet are like eagle's wings. It is very strong, roars like a tiger, breathes heavily, has hooked teeth, can bite people, and likes to eat fish. It is said that this turtle was stranded on a beach in Southeast Asia at low tide and was captured by Mr. Kamp. According to German zoologist Mr. Nall, if this turtle is allowed to grow its wings completely for two years, it will be able to fly. A gentleman from Wing On Company is now negotiating with Mr. Kamp to display the turtle at the amusement park for visitors to view and for zoologists to study.</p>

<p>Over Ten Boxes of American Ginseng</p>
<p>Smuggled from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new tariff, ginseng and bird's nest tonics have been classified as luxury goods and are subject to extremely high taxes. Some merchants try to take advantage of loopholes and often evade customs duties. Yesterday, a British ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. When entering the port, the Jianghai Customs routinely sent officers on board to inspect the ship. They found a large quantity of American ginseng, over ten boxes, in the hold. There were also several packages of granulated sugar. Neither item was listed on the manifest, indicating an attempt to evade customs duties and port charges. It was pure smuggling, hoping to land the goods in Shanghai. After the customs discovered the goods, they considered that the value was extremely high and that, based on the new tariff, the tax evasion alone was significant. The shipping company would also lose considerable freight revenue. The goods were immediately seized and confiscated. There was no one to claim responsibility for smuggling the goods. The shipowner claimed to be unaware of the smuggling. The shipping company has questioned the crew responsible for the hold. The hold staff stated that they were unaware of the large amount of smuggled goods. The goods have now been stored in the customs warehouse. An investigation is underway to identify the tax evader and the person who smuggled the goods in order to impose a severe penalty.</p>

<p>Effective Tomorrow</p>
<p>Since the City-operated Pujiang Ferry established special-class cabins, it has paid attention to all aspects of comfort, cleanliness, and aesthetics. Combined with the speed and convenience of navigation, people, both Chinese and foreigners, are happy to take the ferry to enjoy the river scenery and relax in the countryside. Recently, with the opening of the Gaoqiao route, the number of first-class passengers has increased significantly. The facilities of the special-class cabins must be further improved. However, given the rising cost of materials and high expenses, the Public Utilities Bureau has decided to increase the special-class fare slightly to increase revenue. The fare from Shanghai to Xidu will increase from 20 cents to 25 cents, Ning Temple and Donggou will increase from 30 cents to 35 cents, and Gaoqiao will increase from 42 cents to 50 cents. It is said that the new prices have been approved by the Municipal Government and will take effect on June 27th. The fares for the first and second-class cabins will remain the same, so there will be no impact on the burden of ordinary passengers.</p>

<p>Requests Prohibition of the American Meriden Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>The Third District Party Headquarters submitted a request to the Shanghai Special City Party Executive Committee yesterday, requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Government, to strictly prohibit the American Meriden Advertising Company from privately setting up radio stations and broadcasting various news items. The original request stated: "It has been found that the American Meriden Advertising Company at No. 113-115 Avenue Edward VII has failed to report the details of its broadcasting radio station's equipment setup. Due to non-compliance with procedures, the Ministry of Communications of the National Government has ordered it to stop broadcasting. However, according to recent reports, the company is still broadcasting and has organized the China Broadcasting Association, distributing volunteer forms and soliciting members. This company is organized by foreign businessmen and dares to defy the orders of our Ministry of Communications. It even uses the name of the China Broadcasting Association to absorb our citizens' money to implement its economic aggression policy. If it is allowed to operate freely without strict prohibition, the foundation of the country and the people will be greatly affected. Moreover, in Europe and the United States, foreign investment in radio stations is absolutely prohibited. The importance of this is obvious. Therefore, the 9th meeting of the association resolved to request your committee to forward the request to the Central Government for strict prohibition in order to maintain national rights. This is most convenient."</p>

<p>Continued Hearing and Debate Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhao Guanqing previously sued his uncle Bei Runsheng and cousins Zhao Zhulin and Zhao Pinhou in the Civil Division of the French Court for ignoring his advance payments. The hearing continued yesterday. The lawyer Lu Shaozong, representing the defendant Bei Runsheng, stated that the plaintiff had consistently failed to provide evidence to support his claims. He questioned why Bei Runsheng's name was not listed as a shareholder on the Yi Sheng document if he was a shareholder. Bei Runsheng was only in a supervisory position, indicating that he was not a shareholder. He stated that Runji was only to indicate the cooperation between Zhao Yuting and Bei Runsheng. The witness Yu Qiaqing had previously testified that Zhao Yuting was Zhao Runji. He also stated that there was no evidence that his client had given 50,000 yuan to the plaintiff through Zhou Weishi as a loan for Yi Sheng. This loan was actually requested by the plaintiff from the defendant through Zhou Weishi, and the plaintiff issued a note stating that it was a friendly loan. Later, the parties reconciled and never mentioned Yi Sheng. He presented the note for review. Moreover, the case was twenty-eight years old. Why was it not brought earlier? Even if there was evidence, it would be barred by the statute of limitations. As for the intervenors, their claims were dependent on the plaintiff's case. Since the plaintiff had failed to provide any evidence, the intervenors' claims could not stand. He requested that the case be dismissed and that the plaintiff bear the litigation costs. The lawyers Li Zuyu and Jiang Baoli, representing Zhao Zhulin, Zhao Pinhou, and their five brothers, stated that their clients were all sons of Zhao Yuting. Zhao Yuting was indeed a shareholder of Yi Sheng. He withdrew his shares because the plaintiff Zhao Guanqing managed the business poorly. Zhao Yuting paid over 90,000 yuan to cover the losses, and a withdrawal agreement was made. Zhao Yuting later gave the plaintiff another 50,000 yuan. In 1928, Zhulin and others paid another 25,000 yuan, with the plaintiff stating that there would be no further disputes. How could he now bring this case? There was no evidence to support the claim that the plaintiff had advanced over 400,000 yuan. He requested that the case be dismissed. The lawyer representing the plaintiff Zhao Guanqing stated that the defendant's response had no sufficient basis. The two characters Run Ji at the beginning when Yi Sheng was opened was intended to represent the collaboration of Zhao Yu Ting and Bei Runsheng, and that the 90,000+ on the exit share was never paid though it was written to have been paid on that day, as such it should be seen as invalid. He further stated that the Plaintiff had repeatedly approached the defendant to ask for it, and this can be used as proof. The lawyer He Xianzhang representing the intervenors, Zhao Jingqing and others, gave a detailed account of the situation. After a lengthy debate, Judge Gong announced the conclusion of the debate and adjourned the hearing for judgment.</p>

<p>The elderly woman Xing Zhu, 79 years old, from Tongzhou, residing on Rue Poinsett in the French Concession, was walking on Rue de la Cathédrale at 7 PM on the 24th when she was hit by a car driven by a Westerner named Hertel (transliteration), license number 10007. Xing did not have time to evade, so she was knocked down and injured. Patrol officers recorded the car's license plate and sent the injured woman to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They reported back to the police station for verification by the police chief. The elderly woman died at 10 PM due to her severe injuries and old age. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was transported to the mortuary of the Tongren Fuyuan branch. Her son, Xing Zuozuo, reported to the police station upon learning of the incident. Yesterday morning, the Car Affairs Office of the French General Patrol notified Judge Zhu of the French Court to inspect the body at noon. After verifying that the deceased had indeed died from injuries sustained in a car accident, the judge instructed the son to prepare a coffin and bury the body. The son was very poor and requested 600 yuan in compensation from the car owner.</p>

<p>The last part discusses the shortcomings of the current method of land registration, points them out, and raises the following questions: In any revised land regulations, is it necessary to stipulate a provision so that the Public Works Department authorities can independently establish a real estate office to gradually take over the real estate duties of the consular offices and register the land with perpetual lease deeds held by Chinese and foreign residents located in the public concession? This real estate office will first be allowed to register the land that has always held consular deeds and has been registered by the consular office. The report suggests that if this real estate office can be established, a provision should be made to determine the status of the registrar in complying with various court orders, which are related to the issue of ownership of registered land in the public concession. The report also suggests that this real estate office should be under the control of the same court as the Public Works Department itself. There is also a layer that can be stipulated, that is, the registrar of the Public Works Department's real estate office may request instructions from the court on issues of practice, and may be sued in the court as a civil servant. The difficulties involved, the author has not neglected, but the author believes that the issue of whether a new system of land registration can be planned and implemented should be carefully considered. This is not only for the benefit of the Chinese and foreign local interests in the public concession, but also for the general interests of the public concession as a commercial center. After extraterritoriality is finally abolished, the land registration system of the consular office cannot exist alone. According to the proposed method, the establishment of the Public Works Department registration system is a preparation strategy, sufficient to create a foundation for the new system. After the abolition of extraterritoriality, this strategy, if added with certain restrictions, may also be maintained.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Chapter Nine <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Discusses the recommendations on the court, limited to two topics: (A) the organization and jurisdiction of the court, and the powers it exercises, that is, those currently granted to foreign consular courts; (B) further regulations on Chinese courts in the public concession. Regarding foreign consular courts, it is pointed out in the report that although the method of hearing all cases has proven the value of an independent court, its existing organization is not without its shortcomings. The consular court is organized by the foreign consular representatives stationed in Shanghai. Whether they can have the special qualifications to exercise judicial power is not guaranteed. Moreover, the organization of the court does not include Chinese assessors, which is especially inconsistent with the new developments of constitutionalism. Regarding the future organization of the court, it is suggested as follows: the court must have at least three assessors, one of whom is appointed by the Chinese government, and the remaining two should be judges of foreign extraterritorial courts exercising judicial power in Shanghai. The number of cases handled by the court may not occupy all the time of the assessors who make up the court. Therefore, the author suggests that these assessors should be requested to be concurrently held by existing foreign court judges instead of being specially appointed separately. The report then makes a further suggestion as follows: In addition to exercising the judicial power currently exercised by the foreign consular court, the newly established court should also have a kind of jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate cases raised by the Public Works Department of the public concession regarding the interpretation of any provisions of the land regulations or the interpretation or validity of municipal regulations, and please be determined by the court. Regarding the Chinese courts in the public concession, two suggestions are made: (A) Regarding jurisdiction, as left: All civil and criminal cases occurring in the public concession, if the defendant is under the jurisdiction of the court, then the court's ability to hear the case is obviously an appropriate method. If there is any ambiguity in the existing agreement on this point, it should be interpreted clearly. (B) Regarding the remuneration of assessors and the guarantee of tenure, it is suggested to stipulate a kind of regulation so that the assessors of each court can receive more considerable remuneration. There is a method that seems appropriate to discuss, even if the Public Works Department of the public concession subsidizes some court expenses, and makes a certain committee of the Public Works Department, or any organization representing the public concession, can express opinions on the appointment and removal of assessors. If this type of plan can be implemented, it is also possible to discuss methods so that assessors can have tenure security that is not currently available, and so that each assessor will not be damaged by any changes in the scope of their duties. According to any method proposed, the courts are still completely Chinese courts, but the special circumstances of the public concession, as well as the international interests involved in the exercise of jurisdiction by Chinese courts in the public concession, are therefore recognized.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Chapter Ten <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>The title is "International Partnership," which summarizes the general nature of the suggestions regarding the revision of the current organization law of the public concession: When the author analyzed the main provisions of the land regulations, he paid attention to the international nature of all the existing organization laws of the public concession. As early as 1866, when the existing land regulations were drafted, it was recognized that the "Chinese component" required by the municipal system was still lacking. It is obvious that the international nature of the organization law is still incomplete when this component is still lacking and the Chinese cannot participate in the three administrative, legislative, and judicial organs stipulated in the organization law. The first practical recognition of the Chinese in the public concession's request for this participation was the addition of Chinese directors to the board of directors. The author's current suggestion is that in addition to setting up Chinese directors, it should also be stipulated: (A) Holding a representative assembly of Chinese taxpayers, whose status is the same as that of the foreign taxpayer assembly; (B) Adding Chinese representatives to the agency that has the right to approve the regulations set by the Public Works Department; and (C) Adding Chinese representatives to the court controlled by the Public Works Department, and suggesting the establishment of various methods to expand and strengthen the existing partnership basis of various foreign countries regarding the affairs of the public concession. The development methods of such suggestions are all in accordance with the international partnership principle contained in the organization law. If these types of regulations are adopted and based on the willingness of the countries concerned to cooperate, and implemented fairly, it is hoped that the public concession system, which has a very extraordinary history in all aspects, will be able to fulfill its duties in a more complete and consistent manner in the future, and will be able to gradually adapt its methods and affairs to the needs of the new situation, while maintaining its outstanding characteristics that make it have special nature and value. Is it not reasonable? This is the result that the author has always had in mind when formulating various suggestions, and it is also the result of any reform suggestion. As for the complete success of this result, the extent of the benefits directly or indirectly involved has been pointed out and emphasized in the previous chapters. (End)</p>

<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Rat Week</p>
<p>In recent years, our country has generally used seven days as a period for various public movements and added a new term "week," such as "Health Movement Week" and "Drug Prohibition Movement Week," and so on. In the winter of 1929, the whole of England also held a week. The name was very special and called "Rat Week." "Rat Week" was originally initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the British government and fought against millions of rats across the country. According to their survey, the number of rats is almost the same as their population. The consumption of each rat is one shilling per week. Then the total consumption per year is at least between 100 million pounds and 150 million pounds. The reason why they held this rat week is that it was just the time when the rats moved from the countryside to the towns. They had to come in groups like a human army. In advance, they sent scouts to see the situation. The local authorities planned to launch a large-scale attack after they were dispatched. The rats were about to suffer.</p>
<p>Smart Cat</p>
<p>In Catford, England, there is a black cat named "Tiger." It is very smart by nature. Every time it comes out to play from its owner's home, it can rotate the door handle with its two front feet and gently open the door. When it comes back, it stands on the door handle outside the door and stretches a foot up to knock on the door knocker. The servants come out to open the door for it. These actions are really the same as humans.</p>

<p>— Xu Wusheng</p>
<p>(1) On the tram giving up seats. A Westerner suddenly said to a Chinese friend, "Hey. You are too unreasonable. Just now I saw your country's modern woman on the tram. I stood up and gave up my seat to her. But later a Western woman came into the car and stood here. Why don't you give up your seat for her to sit? This is where you are wrong."</p>
<p>A Chinese friend replied, "Why should I give it to her? She has enjoyed this right in our China for decades. It doesn't matter if I let her stand for five minutes now. You should understand that women in the world treat men too unequally. Now our doctrine is to overthrow inequality. If an old, young, or weak man comes, I will still let him sit. This is the meaning of so-called supporting weak nations. If a young woman comes, I don't want her to give up her seat to me either. I just want to keep my own seat."</p>
<p>(2) Handgun Carrying Case A Nanyang overseas Chinese holding a first-class passport carried a large sum of money when landing in the Americas. The people in the US Customs saw a person with a first-class passport. They had to protect him specially, so they said to the landing overseas Chinese, "Are you carrying a handgun?" The overseas Chinese said, "I don't have a handgun." The customs officer said again, "If you don't have your own handgun, you are not allowed to land. Because it is very dangerous for the wealthy not to have their own handguns. Our police can't follow you around all the time." Later, the overseas Chinese bought a handgun before being allowed to land. This was what the overseas Chinese told a Chinese friend.</p>
<p>But a Chinese friend said to the overseas Chinese, "It shows that where you live abroad is very dangerous. You have to have your own handgun to live there. If you come to our real motherland to import and land, please throw away the handgun you bought abroad before you are allowed to land. Because our real motherland doesn't need handguns. It shows that it is much better than foreign countries."</p>
<p>(3) Insurance Claims Case An Indian businessman in Singapore built a summer house on a mountain in the city. There was no one nearby. One day, the house was burned down due to electrical failure. Fortunately, the house had fire insurance of 500 pounds of English gold, so he claimed compensation from the insurance company. Unexpectedly, the insurance company was a certain royal insurance company, which was very powerful and unwilling to pay compensation. Therefore, the Indian sued in court. On the day of the trial, the judge said to the Indian, "Your house is on a mountain in the air, a separate house. There is a suspicion of arson for compensation. According to the law, compensation cannot be paid."</p>
<p>An Indian asked the judge, "If a ship burns in the ocean, will compensation be paid?" The judge said, "A ship is a ship. A house is a house. There is a big difference." The Indian said, "There is no difference. The so-called difference is the difference between white and black. If the house is owned by a white person and the insurance company is owned by a black person, compensation must be paid."</p>
<p>(4) "Suitable for Death" and "Bleeding" Case An English aristocrat got lost in Tokyo. He saw a Chinese man in a suit and wanted to ask him the way. But when he saw the Chinese man, he looked like a Japanese and also like a Chinese. So he couldn't help but ask, "What Nese You Are?" meaning "Which kind of 'suitable for death' are you? Is it 'Chinese' or 'Japanese'?"</p>
<p>The Chinese friend in Tokyo was both amused and annoyed when he heard this question. He looked at the man carefully. He looked like an Englishman and also like an Irishman. He also asked him, "What Ish Aou Are?" "Which kind of 'bleeding' are you? Is it 'English' or 'Irish'?" The aristocrat got this kind of equal treatment and slipped away.</p>

<p>— Wei Cun</p>
<p>Recently, a Ryukyu islander caught a giant turtle six feet long near Naze Port in Okinawa Prefecture. The owner of the Osaka Kaiyukan aquarium bought it at a high price and raised it for tourists to visit. The giant turtle was shipped from Ryukyu to Japan on the Tainan Maru on the 15th of this month. It was unloaded at the Tomishima warehouse in Osaka. I happened to pass by there and saw the giant turtle raising its head and wailing sadly. Because it could not move due to the shackles, it shed tears like rain. I asked the guard about its origin. I learned that the turtle had a wine spleen. It cried every night during the voyage, causing the passengers to be unable to sleep. If given wine, it would stop crying. I didn't believe it, so I bought two bottles of wheat wine to try it. It drank it all in one gulp. The crying stopped. I asked Dr. Sato, the owner of the aquarium, about the age of the giant turtle. According to him, the turtle's development is only one pound per year, and the weight of the turtle is 563 pounds. It can prove that the age of the giant turtle is definitely over 600 years old.</p>

<p>— Qi Rui</p>
<p>The 22nd of this month was the 30th birthday of Zhao Junhao. Zhao Jun's friends specially held a celebration at the Dongya Restaurant. That night, there were more than 300 male and female guests. The press included Zhang Zhuping, Dong Xianguang, and Wang Boqi. Art experts included Li Jinhui and his wife. Movie stars included Hu Die and Liang Saizhen. Socialites included Miss Sheng Qi and Shan Cuiying. Yang Wenjuan, etc., all participated. It was quite a grand occasion. Qian Jiechen, Zhuang Zhujiu, Qian Ruifu, and Tang Shichang managed everything. The most popular program was the pure singing of famous amateurs. It had been agreed in advance that Cheng Junmou, Jiang Junjia, and Xun Huisheng would come. Unfortunately, Cheng had a foot disease and Jiang returned home. Xun had to perform the full version of Yutangchun that night. He had to go on stage at 8:30 PM, so he came to congratulate him at 7:00 PM and left in a hurry. That night, the musicians were Wang Ruoqi and Liu Bilin, two amateur erhu players from Shanghai. They were masters of the art, which caused a burst of applause and added a lot of color. The pure singing began at 8:00 PM. First, Ms. Shi Xiuwen sang two sections of the original Ban Xipi of Yu Bei Ting. Her voice was clear and her rhyme was mellow. Then, Ms. Min Cuiying sang the Detective Shaker of June Snow, which was also sad and moving. Ma Zhishan's Cui Ping Shan, Wu Qianan's Zhan Taiping, Zhu Liwen's Fen He Wan, Li Huapu's Kong Cheng Ji, and E Lu Gong's Wu Ben Ji were either good at singing in a high voice or good at speaking. There were too many beautiful things to mention. Yan Jupeng sang a section of the original Ban of Hongyangdong. The ups and downs were indeed extraordinary. As soon as one section was finished, there was an endless stream of voices asking for another one. As a result, he sang a few more verses of the shaker before stopping. Madam Chen Yihong's Kunqu opera Asking for Illness had an elegant charm. Yu Kongwo's Famen Temple was a section of Xipi slow Ban turning to 261. The singing was calm and well-organized. Ms. Ma Shufen's Ma Dian, a large section of Erhuang, did not slack off until the end. It showed that she had a deep foundation. Finally, Zhou Jianyun, Ms. Hu Die, and Ms. Liang Saizhen sang the Siping Tune of Mei Long Zhen together. The singing was melodious and pleasing to the ear. It was followed by Qian Ruifu's Yu Cang Jian. He learned Uncle Yan's singing method very vividly, which was not easy. It was not until 11:00 PM that everyone dispersed in joy.</p>
<p>Art News Painter Xiu Hai Shan Ren Gu Jiuyan is good at insects, birds, flowers and plants. He has long been praised by the people of Shanghai.

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>15th Recently, a conflict between Muslims and Hindus occurred in Varanasi. They fought for several days. Sixty or seventy people died and two hundred were injured. The reason was that foreign goods were checked. Indians boycotted British goods and were not allowed to sell them. Some Muslims sold British goods and were killed. It was suspected to be Indians, which led to a major conflict. Varanasi is a very peaceful holy place. It is strange that this phenomenon occurred. It gives the British an excuse. There have always been conflicts between Indians and Muslims in various places. Only this place has none. It is strange and lamentable that so many people have died and been injured. It is also a major obstacle to Gandhi's movement. On this day, I gave a speech at the Muslim Students' Association. Each student room is one room. It is spacious and clean. In India, classes are held from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM every day. The Muslim Students' Association also has a head teacher who leads the prayer report. From January 20th to February 20th, Muslims fast during the day for a month. Those who fast during the day can eat once before 4:00 AM every day, and twice after 5:00 PM until night. Indians thought it was strange. I asked my Muslim friend and said that fasting has several advantages. One is to get rid of diseases. The second is to know the situation of the poor. The third is that if you encounter an extremely dangerous situation, you can practice resistance. This is the meaning of fasting. I think his leader must have had more difficulties when he used troops in the beginning. Most of them ate at night and fought during the day, so they became accustomed to it and made it a permanent commemoration. Night eating and day fighting are most suitable for using troops. Alas. Life is the most difficult. I told my Muslim friend that there are only three roads for each leader. One is to be killed, like Jesus on the cross. The second is to kill, like Muhammad. The third is to run away, like Buddha and Lao Tzu. There is no good way up. Killing and being killed are both last resorts.</p>
<p>16th The Englishman Florenk Garding and his wife invited me to dinner. I met Sura Ni, who had traveled to China. Garding introduced me to several beauties. I went to Simm's American rural beauty place with them. I passed a long iron bridge, which was about half a mile long. The cost of this bridge was very large. The bridge is divided into three lanes, with upper and lower floors. Trains, large vehicles, and human vehicles can pass through without hindrance. This river is the Ganges. The water of the Ganges is clear here, not as turbid as in Jia City. Every time I think of the Ganges, I always remember the story of King Bosi's mother in the Surangama Sutra. I got a poem as follows. I used to read the Surangama Sutra. Now I see the water of the Ganges. There was a great enlightened fairy. I used this to prove the wonderful meaning. The bright moon shines in the sky. Thousands of rivers are like mirrors. The water flows and the moon shadows move. The moon today is not the same as the past. Water and moon are like change and destruction. Not to mention the skin and bones. I only think of my kind mother's grace. I will never forget it. Mother transforms away the killing intention. The repayment of kindness starts from now.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Ziliang had no way to deal with this innocent and naive wife. As a school teacher, he had worked hard for six days in the classroom. Today was Sunday, and he should have rested and slept in a little later. Who knew she would come and disrupt his sleep? Could he say she was ignorant? She had, after all, graduated from junior high school. However, she was inherently mischievous. Ziliang felt ashamed that he, an educator, couldn't influence his closest companion.</p>
<p>"Didn't you say a few days ago that you would take me out to play on Sunday?"</p>
<p>"Take you out to play? Where to?"</p>
<p>Ziliang couldn't remember for a moment.</p>
<p>"You said you'd take me to learn swimming, to the Hongkou swimming pool!"</p>
<p>He thought, he did say something like that; but now that he remembered, today wouldn't work. In just five or six days, summer vacation would begin, and he had three classes' worth of compositions, totaling over one hundred and sixty, that he needed to finish grading today. Delaying any longer would be too late. Thinking of this, Ziliang didn't feel like sleeping anymore. Grading over one hundred and sixty compositions in a single day might be impossible, so he might as well get out of bed early. He made up his mind and jumped out of bed. His wife, seeing this, also got up.</p>
<p>"That's right! As soon as you hear about taking me swimming, you're willing to get up! That's a great black lacquer stool!"</p>
<p>"No! I don't have time today. I have to grade papers."</p>
<p>"If you don't take me, I'll ask another man to take me! Then you'll be fighting to go with me!"</p>
<p>Ziliang didn't even hear what his wife said. He got dressed and went downstairs. Yueru also hurried downstairs. The nanny in the kitchen, seeing the master and mistress come down together, was glad she had prepared the washing water early. She brought out a basin of washing water and placed it on the table. Ziliang went over to wash his face, but his wife pushed him aside:</p>
<p>"Husbands and wives should respect each other like honored guests. Why are you respecting me like a soldier, fighting to grab it? I got up first today, so this basin of washing water is mine!"</p>
<p>Seeing her go to wash her face, Ziliang went to rinse his mouth. When the second basin of water was brought, he washed his face.</p>

<p>Financial Gold Prices Reappear with a Sharp Drop</p>
<p>| Plunging Twenty-Three Taels Strongly</p>
<p>Before the War Debt Problem is Resolved</p>
<p>Future Changes Are Still Significant</p>
<h3 id="e277">The Extreme Fear of the Downturn <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 25th, the benchmark gold price experienced an especially severe downturn, almost like a landslide. The violent winds and raging waves could not be more intense. In the blink of an eye, over ten taels collapsed, and a few taels fluctuated from morning till night, with a total of over thirty taels in retrospect. In the end, it tragically fell by over twenty-three taels, causing extreme fear and making it difficult to cope. The bulls were greatly hit, and all were surrounded by clouds of worry. As for the silver market, it reported gains. The opening was slightly lower, but soon due to strong selling pressure, it plunged straight down. The ferocity of the decline was terrifying, with a huge drop of thirty taels, suddenly breaking through the 700-tael mark. The foreign exchange rate also increased by two and a half notches. The domestic market was surprisingly loose. British gold was the strongest at one shilling and four pence. By noon, it turned mild again because Dalian, Guangdong, and other groups took this opportunity to buy. Afterwards, market fluctuations were particularly intense, hovering around 710 taels, and the exchange rate was weak but flat. However, large investors had already competed to buy, finally supporting it at 710 taels. It is expected that the silver market should continue to rise this morning. However, before the war debt default case is resolved, the future of the gold market may still undergo dramatic changes.</p>
<h3 id="e278">The Early Opening Was Only Slightly Weak <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>From the early morning opening in August, it immediately fell 3.6 qian to 729.5 taels, with large bars at 1/8 and silver prices plus 3/8, private telegrams also plus 7/16. Then it became 30 taels. Subsequently, Bingxing, Zhifeng, Yongyu, Fayongfutai, Hengyuantai and others successively sold, and British gold gradually showed signs of loosening. Banks initially advanced 625, followed by 8125, so gold prices plummeted, with a sharp drop of over 20 taels, almost out of control, finally reaching 709 taels. It was then revived by Hengxing, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yongshunli, and Wanxing to advance, and a telegram came from Bombay to buy British gold at a price of 8125, and foreign telegrams were also transmitted, saying that France had not agreed to the war debt extension plan, so people's hearts were shaken. When the shilling opened, it was 16 taels, but the listing was already 625 long, US dollars 1.25, and Japanese gold fell 6.75, so it fell to 13 taels. However, British gold stood firm, and Zhengjin and others absorbed 8125, approaching 10 o'clock it was 19 taels. After that, the storms were great, and the exchange rate had actually become weak. Various banks absorbed 875 to 9375, and Yuancheng, Daxing, Yongqian, Changxiang, Chengfeng, Yongfu, Yuyuan, Taifu, Taiheng and other major investors sold heavily, and the market was in a state of shock. There was a sharp drop of over 20 taels, and there were countless ups and downs within an hour, leaving people unprepared. At 11:00, it suddenly reached 698 taels. At this time, HSBC Zhengjin and others ate British gold at 14. Afterwards, Hengxing, Fuchang, Wanxing and others competed to advance, and British gold could be sold at 9375, so it was pulled up by 11.2 taels. However, a Mr. Wu sold more than 1,000 bars, so the price fluctuated slightly. By the time of the market close, it was 710 taels, and the physical goods were sold off, turning to 707 taels and 5 qian. The closing price continued to be suppressed to 056 taels, and the revealed price was changed to 757 taels and 8 qian, with a total suppression of around 40 taels. At noon, it was from 60 taels to 50 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e279">The After-Market Storm Is Still Huge <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>The after-market opened with a small face, at 02 taels, followed by 700 taels. It was estimated that the Indian exchange rate had risen by 13 annas. Afterwards, there were six or seven taels of fluctuation, from 07 taels to 005 qian in an instant. This was truly because people's hearts were flustered and there were various trades on the trading floor. Later, it was learned that France was going to borrow 20 million gold pounds from Britain, and the Indian exchange rate fell by 4 annas, so the market atmosphere in the venue was shaken. Daxing, Yongyuanxing, Yongyuantai, Changsheng, Yonghengxing and others enthusiastically advanced, and Mr. Wu also sold, so the bank ate British gold at 875, so the gold price jumped by 13 or 14 taels, reaching 14 taels at 2:20. In a moment, there were ups and downs of five or six taels. After 3:00, it softened again. Yuanmao, Yongri, Changshunli, Wanxing, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, etc. all sold out, and there was a sudden plunge of 10 taels, and British gold could be settled at 875. At 2:45, it was 04 taels and 5 qian, and then it seemed to rise again. At 4:00, it was 09 taels, and in a moment it retreated to 05 taels. There was not much trading on the trading floor, but the state of turbulence was not easy to grasp. Later, the buyers seemed to be more numerous, so they pushed up another four or five taels. By 4:30, the market was at 710 taels. The bank had eaten British gold at 9375. After the market was done, it was made to 11 taels. Compared to the previous day (according to the listing), it continued to plummet by 23 taels and 1 qian. According to the maximum of 730 taels and the minimum of 698 taels before and after the market, there were 32 taels of twists and turns. The physical goods were 24 taels in the early market, 06 taels at the noon closing, 02 taels in the afternoon, and 11 taels at the closing. The revealed price was estimated to be around 50 taels, and the logged price was from 11 taels to 08 taels. The make-up water was 11 taels, and 13 taels in the afternoon.</p>

Compared to the previous day at the market close, British gold increased by 5625, US dollars increased by 1 yuan and 0625, and Japanese gold fell by 5 fen 25. It is because the gold market is in a state of decline, once breaking through the 700 liang mark, which has a close relationship with the exchange market. Chinese merchants are still dumping British gold, because hedging is still possible, so Dalian group and Guangdong group Hengxing, Shengda, Jingfuchang, Yuanheng Qianchangxiang and other gold companies and various banks jointly opened 100,000 pounds. The world market price of each bank followed the advance and relaxation. A small number of US dollars were sold, and there were more than 1 million Japanese gold, which was said to be bought by Japanese merchants.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Downturn is Severe <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has fallen sharply, and the situation is very weak. The fluctuating gold price has caused people to be flustered, so the market is very soft. The sales of existing yarn are relatively sluggish, but export transactions to the East are continuous. However, the selling pressure is very fierce, so the thoughts of scattered investors are becoming more and more weak, and they can only bear the pain to close their positions. Therefore, the market is trending downstream. However, the bottom goods of various factories are reduced compared to before. In short, the exchange rate news is not good, so the short side is very focused and it is not easy to rise sharply for the time being. However, most bulls are still unwilling to let go, it is said.</p>

<p>At the opening of the human standard pre-market, the American cotton was flat, and the gold price fell, causing people to panic again. The prices for each month fell by 1 liang, 6, 7, and 8 qian. In the afternoon, the bidding for yarn was still unfavorable and fell by another 5, 6, and 8 qian. The total transaction was estimated to be 48,050 packages. It was found that Heshen sold 1,350 packages, Jifeng 1,300 packages, Tianlong 1,400 packages, Shenji 1,600 packages, and Deji 2,550 packages. Tongyu bought 1,200 packages, Gengfeng 1,600 packages, Yongfeng 1,150 packages, Yichang 1,650 packages, and Yiyu 1,650 packages. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The sales of existing yarn are relatively sluggish. It is estimated that the various groups bought a total of 750 packages throughout the day, and 750 packages among the same trade. The market price fell by 5 qian to 1 liang. Among the visiting groups, Tianjin advanced 120 packages, Hankou advanced 135 packages, the mainland advanced 220 packages, Yunnan advanced 50 packages, Shantou advanced 50 packages, Japan went to 300 packages, and miscellaneous groups advanced 125 packages, it is said.</p>

<p>The cotton market was softened by the slump in gold prices and bad news. At the same time, the yarn market fell, and the purchasing power of various factories became more and more scarce, and trading became more and more weak, so the market atmosphere became more depressed. However, Japanese merchants are still unwilling to let go of the far-month new cotton, it is said.</p>

<p>The Hankou standard pre-market opened with a downward step, and the popularity was very weak. Each fell by 4 and 5 qian. In the afternoon, the market situation was still weak, with the near falling by 3 and 4 qian, and the far rising by 5 points. The total transaction was estimated to be 68,200 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 4,000 dan, Yuda 2,100 dan, Changfeng 8,200 dan, and Yuchang 3,000 dan. Gengfeng bought 3,600 dan, Gongtai 3,000 dan, Daji 3,000 dan, and Yuanda 3,300 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to pressure from sellers, but later became firm due to the strength of Wall Street and purchases by the public. It is estimated that the futures rose by 10 to 14 pounds, and the spot rose by 10 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 8 and 9 points, and spot fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 20 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to rumors that France would accept the US President's proposal, and European exporters purchased and short sellers covered their positions. Later, it was weakened by disappointing news from Liverpool. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, Aomula rose by 4 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 3 rupees.

<p>New York Prices Reported Higher... Factory Purchases Still Watching and Waiting</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese and British firms' silk market still lacked the possibility of progress. Although New York silk prices were reported higher, factory purchases were watching and waiting. However, sales to France were not desolate. Lyon continued to send telegrams for transfers. Yesterday, Dachang and others imported 40 packages of Shanghai White Raw Silk, and Xinfu imported 20 packages of Sichuan Yellow Raw Silk. Prices were said to be firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the needle and eyebrow green tea from inland firms was sought after by British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Concord, Jinlong, and Fushi. Transactions were still not desolate, and selling prices were quite firm. The bud-picked Zhenmei was slightly favored by Dodd, Forbes and others, with top prices quoted at 270 taels. The market for ordinary Zhenmei remained sluggish. High-quality goods from Wuyuan's northern route firms were not quoted on the market yesterday. There were no large transactions for other goods such as Gongxi and Xiumei.</p>
<p>Grain and Rice Market Gradually Loosening</p>
<h3 id="e298">New Wharf <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a lack of early morning bids for Changshu and Xianzi rice. By the afternoon, the strength reached numbers 32 and 33. However, the City God Temple and Xiutang Rice Industry Association are in the period of comparing measures, with a total of 240 boats compared, so transactions on this street were extremely quiet. Only about 1,000 piculs were sold in small lots. The opening prices for especially top-quality rice fluctuated by a few cents, while medium-quality rice shortened by about two dimes. There was no activity in the thin rice measures from Shipu, Chonggu, and Xitang, with the situation softening by two or three feet. Although Yangdu superior rice was in short supply, local shops were unwilling to purchase more, and the price fell by nearly a foot. The supply of superior rice from Babu was still thin, and the price was short by half a foot. Glutinous rice was dull, and distillers' appetite was meager, indicating a sluggish downstream.</p>
<h3 id="e299">South Shanghai <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the supply from various regions was thin, the amount in Puxun gradually thickened. Due to the extremely hot weather and news of cheaper prices in the northern market, both urban and rural shops were watching and waiting. Moreover, the appetite of the firms was also thin, and coupled with the difficulty in storing goods for long, they had to loosen their prices accordingly. The sales volume was also not selective, resulting in a repeated decline in the price of thick japonica rice, shortening by about two dimes. The supply of thin indica rice seemed scarce, but those with accumulated stocks were slightly loosening, due to the continued arrival of Songjiang rice, resulting in no demand from Ningbo. Although there was some activity in this street, it was only in small lots, and the market price shortened again by two or three dimes. Sales of Luyang superior rice and arrivals were balanced, with no gains or losses. The glutinous rice market was still active, with dozens of piculs traded at prices unchanged.</p>
<p>Flour and Wheat Also Affected by Gold Prices</p>
<h3 id="e300">Wheat Flour <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for all months uniformly showed a sharp decline. Although the quoted prices for foreign wheat were better by about two, three, or four dimes, domestic and international environments had shifted their focus of observation since the sharp change in gold prices. If the exchange rate increases, foreign wheat can be readily fixed. At a time when new wheat is being harvested domestically, this impact is naturally more significant. Moreover, the factories' bargaining chips have been allowed to float recently, with no intention of buying them back. For the more distant months, they have been actively unloading for days, causing great shock and a rush to follow the trend, making the market atmosphere unsalvageable. Judging from the subsequent trend of actual sales not supporting purchases, it will be difficult for this month to pass steadily. Transactions were still smooth throughout the day, reaching over 170 bags. As a final result, this month fell by 2.75 fen compared to the previous day, July fell by 1.75 fen, August fell by 2.75 fen, September fell by 3.25 fen, October fell by 3 fen, and November fell by 3.75 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Wheat <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for all months uniformly showed a sharp decline. With the fall in gold prices and the sharp rise in exchange rates, inquiries from abroad were very active. Domestically, supplies were flooding in from all over the place, while factories seemed to be feigning ignorance. By this point, the minds of those inside and outside the industry were inevitably apprehensive. The huge impact yesterday was due to the fact that the foreign wheat test orders placed by firms a few days ago were now confirmed due to the extended exchange rate. It was heard that traders had collectively ordered a ship of Australian wheat, to be shipped in August, at a combined price of 4 taels and 2 mace. It was also heard that factories had transacted for three ships, but the prices were not yet known. As a result, there was a surge in unloading, and many new bargaining chips were released, causing the market atmosphere to plummet. This month, with settlement approaching, those outside the industry were eagerly closing their positions, further exacerbating the decline. As a result, this month fell by 1 mace and 2 fen compared to the previous day, July fell by 6 fen, August fell by 8 fen, September fell by 7 fen, October fell by 8 fen, and November fell by 6 fen. Regarding the spot wheat situation, due to sluggish factory purchases and unusually weak sentiment, the price of medium-quality wheat was shouted down by about 2 mace yesterday due to standard issues. Over 1,000 bags of Nanjing, Chuzhou, Yangzhou, Penglai, and Anting wheat were opened, reportedly purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Piece Goods Gradually Declining <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market was even more sluggish yesterday. With the continued decline in the gold market and the lack of vitality in yarn and cotton, people were fearful, and those holding goods were seeking to sell them off. Even the out-of-town dealers reversed from buying to selling, resulting in very quiet actual sales. Both local and out-of-town dealers were watching and waiting, and transactions were scarce. Yesterday, straight tribute broadcloth all fell in price, with Liyan Muqiu and Moganshan entering customs at 3 mace and 8 fen each. The Four Gentlemen had returned to 3 mace and 2.5 fen. Yuehua Silver had successively arrived in Shanghai, resulting in an oversupply situation. Prices fell by about 5 li compared to before. Foreign yarn was even more sluggish, with Dian Qiuxiang falling to 10 taels and 2 mace, Double Child Deer at 9 taels and 7 mace, and the price of upper body goods also softened. Little Beauty Li Taibai all fell. The stock of white crepe fabric increased again, with Tongpan returning to 4 taels 1 mace and 7.5 fen, and Human Dog at 4 taels 1 mace and 5 fen. Only bleached cloth still rose, likely due to low inventories and the arrival of the season. Yesterday, Dingfujun was sold at 12 taels, Magpie Bridge Meeting at 12 taels and 5.5 fen, and Blessing, Longevity, and Three Stars at 11 taels and 2.5 fen. Both colored strip velvet and mohair velvet had arrived in Shanghai, but the trend was quite quiet. The decline in western goods and foreign yarn was also severe. Huaji Butterfly Corridor and Teach Child brands fell by as much as 1 tael and 5 mace per piece compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Hardware from Shantou Dealers Suddenly Booming <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>Hardware transactions showed no progress yesterday. Factories and out-of-town dealers did not increase bulk purchases, resulting in a rather cold market. However, the Shantou dealers suddenly emerged and their business boomed, with transactions reaching over 1,400 piculs. The purchases consisted mostly of tinplate. It was also heard that there were quite a few French West nails, new lead wire, English steel plates, and angle iron. The market price remained relatively stable due to positive sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="e304">Hardware Merchants Temporarily Suspend Orders <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>Due to the continuous surge in foreign exchange rates, those who had previously settled import hardware goods at lower exchange rates suffered significant losses. Therefore, in order to maintain future market conditions, various firms in the market have temporarily suspended orders. It is said that foreign firms have had no new orders since yesterday.</p>

<p>Due to the arrival of the moldy season, the inventory of dried longan at various firms has mostly been baked. However, baking inevitably increases costs due to weight loss, labor, and other factors. Selling at the current market price would certainly result in losses. Therefore, the trade association convened a meeting yesterday to discuss increasing prices in order to maintain costs. The proposed prices are: Top grade 36 taels, Heavenly grade 26 taels, Tianhong grade 20 taels, and Purchase grade 14 taels.</p>

<p>— Man Yin</p>
<p>By Lin Jing</p>
<p>Whether it be to consolidate national defense and prevent the invasions of various imperialist powers like Japan, Russia, and England, or to solve the problems of numerous unemployed and increasingly impoverished people in the interior, immigration to develop the border regions is a matter of utmost urgency at present. Can we stand idly by and watch Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces, Russia's redification of Outer Mongolia, and England's instigation of rebellion in Tibet, without thinking of ways to resist them? Can we stand by and watch the disasters of war and banditry in the interior, the daily worsening of people's livelihoods, and leave the excellent border regions, such as the forests of Jilin, the gold mines of Altai, the animal husbandry of Outer Mongolia, and the oil of Xinjiang, to be exploited by others without concern? As long as we are human beings, as long as our blood is still boiling and our breath is still coming and going, we, the youth who cannot find a way out in the interior, the unemployed masses, should go to the border regions in large-scale, organized groups. At the same time, our government should assume full responsibility for protection and safely transport our immigrant groups there. We must recognize that this is the only way to alleviate our difficulties, the only real way out for us.</p>
<p>The above paragraph is from a letter written to me by a friend who has already gone to the Northwest to investigate. I believe his words are correct, and I believe even more that his spirit of courage and perseverance will surely lead to success. Because I believe he is right, and because I admire and respect him, I have also developed the ambition to follow in his footsteps. Therefore, in recent times, I have felt a particular interest in matters concerning China's border regions, and I have been especially eager to collect works about the border regions, whether by borrowing or buying, even though money is so hard to come by.</p>
<p>After collecting hundreds of books about our country's border regions, I couldn't help but feel a nameless sorrow that pained my heart. It was that among these books, those that were more detailed and accurate were mostly translated from foreign languages. For example, an Englishman named Charles has written three thick volumes on the topography, roads, customs, human feelings, social system, politics, and economy of Tibet. Furthermore, Japan's works on Manchuria and Mongolia are beyond the reach of our Chinese compatriots. We cannot properly protect our own property, and we allow others to plot against us. Those being plotted against are still in a daze, like fish in a cauldron, leisurely and carefree, unaware of the impending disaster. What could be more lamentable in the world than this?</p>
<p>However, recently, this fact of our compatriots' neglect of the border regions, which caused me grief, has diminished a little. We cannot but thank Mr. Lin Jing for the publication of this Northwestern Series.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin is a traveler, and it can be said that he is one of the earliest Chinese people to pay attention to the problem of the northwestern border regions with scientific methods and political insight. I know from friends that he is doing what he believes he must do with an attitude of "taking what others discard." For example, in terms of immigration to the area and the development of the Northwest, which is now a fashionable tune sung to the high heavens, Mr. Lin already noticed it fifteen years ago and has traveled throughout the Northwest. Can we not say that he is a pioneer in the development of the Northwest?</p>
<p>"It possesses 2.38 million square miles, accounting for four-sevenths of the country's territory, containing the essence of the five elements and hundreds of products, being the starting point of historical culture, the source of rivers, the beginning of mountains, abundant for animal husbandry, vast for agriculture, controlling the hub of Eurasia, possessing natural raw materials, thus suitable for industry and commerce. As for the covetous eyes of strong neighbors, the hidden disputes of the world, the divisions of races and religions, and the security of the country, are these not the phenomena of the Northwest today? However, when presented to the people of the country, how many know of it? How many who know of it secretly ponder and plan to open up the wilderness, explore the treasure chest, and seek to create immortal achievements? Of those who do, how many can avoid making matters worse and turning blessings into misfortunes?... Alas, the beautiful rivers and mountains have turned into a field of Shura, and innocent people have become meat on the chopping block. Is this the inevitable result of fate, or is it that human affairs have not been exhausted?" (Preface to page one)</p>
<p>From this, we can know the author's ambition and interest in the Northwest issue. Because his vision is outstanding and he feels the importance of the Northwest issue to China and even the world, he does not hesitate to pursue and collect information in that border region, which is usually regarded as a world of ice and snow and a desolate landscape. This book is his record of the climate, topography, soil, customs, and human feelings along the way, "written from the ice and snow." From this, we can believe that it is an accurate record, unlike those who talk about the Northwest without ever having set foot there.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into two parts, upper and lower. "(The upper part is a diary, divided into eight volumes. Volume 1: In the fifth year of the Republic of China, from Beijing via Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu to Dihua; Volume 2: In the sixth year of the Republic of China, from Dihua via the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains and Altai, Siberia to Beijing; Volume 3: From Beijing via Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu to Dihua; Volume 4: From Dihua via Inner and Outer Mongolia to Beijing; Volume 5: In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, from Beijing via Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu to Qinghai; Volume 6: Record of residence in Qinghai from the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth years of the Republic of China; Volume 7: Record of circumnavigation of Qinghai in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China; Volume 8: From Qinghai to Shanghai in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. The above eight volumes are compiled into six books, with the first, second, fifth, and sixth volumes each being one book, and the third and fourth volumes being combined into one book. The total number of words is about 800,000, and there are about 150 photos." (See Examples one)</p>
<p>Eight volumes, 800,000 words. This is a surprisingly large number. Regardless of its content, it is not something that can be written successfully in a short time just by putting black words on white paper. Only the third and fourth volumes combined into one book are published now. What is introduced below is these two volumes.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the third volume records the journey from Beijing via Chahar, Suiyuan, Gansu, etc., to Dihua, and the fourth volume records the journey from Dihua via Inner and Outer Mongolia back to Beijing. The two volumes together contain about 200,000 words, which shows the richness of the material. They are all written in diary style. Although it feels a bit boring when reading, our focus is on the situation of developing the Northwest, investigation, and inspection of the Northwest, and not like reading literary works, requiring beauty and novelty in words and sentences.</p>
<p>Here, for the convenience of introduction, we can divide each volume into several parts to discuss.</p>
<p>Third volume: (A) From Beijing to Baotou, it took from November 13th to December 11th of the seventh year of the Republic of China.

In total, it took about half a year from Beijing to Dihua (including time spent on the way), a total of 7842 li.</p>
<p>Fourth volume: (1) From Qitai, Xinjiang, to Lower Mongolia.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Baidunzi, it took from June 7th to 17th, passing through Dongcheng Canal, Hongliu well, Jiji Lake, Black Mountain Head, Guai Ba Water, Guodi Mountain, Zhuanjin, a total of 730 li. (2) From Lower Baidunzi to Zhamushandan, it took from June 18th to 27th, passing through Five Households, Zhenxi County, D窖 Pu, Luanshanzi, Laoye Temple, Liuquan, Hengshanzi, a total of 700 li. (3) From Zhamushandan to Suo Temple, it took from June 27th to July 8th, passing through Hala Die Ling, Jia Hui, Jia Lameng, Suo Moda, Da Tuo Lei, a total of 725 li. (4) From Suo Hongtu to Jiaer Han Longtou, it took from July 9th to 18th, passing through Hei Sha Tu, Hao burst, Hala Niu Dun, Xue Hai, a total of 625 li. (5) From Jiaer Han Longtou to Zhang Mao Hala Tuoluo Gai, it took from July 19th to 30th, passing through Shan Dan, Ding Gai Hutong, Dara Wusu, Xiao Kui Teng, Xi Ba, Nao Hai Tu, a total of 668 li. (6) From Zhang Mao to Guihua, it took from July 30th to August 15th, passing through Yike Bula, Jian Ye He Sha, Xila Hada, Wula Bula, Ha Sha Tu Xi, La Mao Zhaoli, a total of 996 li, a total of 4440 li, taking about two months.</p>
<p>From the statistics of the number of places traveled in these actual locations, relying on the 18th-century transportation equipment in the north, the author of the book was able to travel all over the important roads in the Northwest. Can we not admire his endurance and enterprising spirit? After reading this book, what should we lament about our usual neglect of the Northwest, and what attention should we pay to it now? In terms of length, the third volume is longer than the fourth volume. This is because the area from Beiping via Chahar, Suiyuan, Ning, Gansu to Xinjiang is more important than the area from Xinjiang via Mongolia to Guihua. The former road almost passes through a very fertile area. Everything about customs, human feelings, politics, and economy is worth our attention and discussion, which the latter, mostly some Gobi deserts and uninhabited places, cannot compare to. Therefore, the author narrates more, giving us a clear and concise understanding of everything about the Northwest, such as roads, climate, topography, and other people's customs, habits, historical sites, etc. We think it is very clear and concise.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is also detailed investigation and narration on the resources of the Northwest. I cannot quote much from the original text here, but only briefly mention a few points scattered in the book.</p>
<p>(1) From Fengzhen via Wuyuan Baotou to Xinjiang, there are coal mines almost everywhere along the way.</p>
<p>(2) Jin is most famous in areas such as Suzhou and Ganzhou in Gansu.</p>
<p>(3) Carpets from Salachi County in Gansu, forests from Gucheng in Xinjiang, and animal husbandry from other places.</p>
<p>(4) Agricultural products from Liangzhou, Suzhou, Wuyuan, etc., such as beans, wheat, cotton...</p>
<p>In short, the fertile land considered in the interior is not lacking in the Northwest, and because the population is sparse, the land price is cheap, which is hundreds of times lower than that in the interior. We who have not been to the Northwest always think of the Northwest as a desolate border region. Now, after reading the narration in this book, can we not be moved?</p>
<p>At the end of the book, there are also many important papers such as the Survey of the Gansu-Xinjiang Road Opinions, the Northwest National Road Route Accounting Book, and the Survey of the Baotou Near Water Transport Situation Opinions, which help us to have a more clear and concise understanding of the work, preparation, and effort that should be made in the development of the Northwest. Before there are more detailed works that discuss and investigate the Northwest, I think this book is the only detailed book about the Northwest.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter personally sincerely pays tribute to the author of this book and Mr. Zhao who sent the book for review, for allowing me to have a more detailed understanding of the Northwest before I went to the Northwest.</p>
<h3 id="e325">Casual Notes on Youth <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Hua</p>
<p>Published by the United Bookstore</p>
<p>School life is a beautiful dream. This dream gives you many sweet and deep loves. If you have never entered the threshold of school, maybe you only have some empty dreams, but the actual inside story is ten times what you dreamed of. Especially the life of college students, college is a mysterious palace, all kinds of unimaginable interesting stories are being created, and beautiful stories are being played out. College students are natural darlings. They enjoy that beautiful dream with the era of youth. They are either the owners of those stories or the protagonists of those funny dramas, or at least a theater-goer watching the play. Many beautiful and interesting traces are deeply imprinted in their minds, and they often call out to cherish their unique youth.</p>
<p>The author of this book is a happy person who was once intoxicated in this dream. I read his works a long time ago and knew that he was a happy person who occupied the life of college students.</p>
<p>He is an author who is good at poetry and novels. Last autumn, I read his poetry collection "Fragrant Kiss," and this spring I read his collection of creations "Three Couples of Lovers," and recently I read this collection of essays "Casual Notes on Youth." Every time I read his works, I always feel a casual and humorous interest overflowing.</p>
<p>The author's poems and novels are of course what I love to read, but I think his specialty is especially writing essays. His essays have his unique beautiful and fragrant style. The material is the most beautiful part of life, and the style is the intoxicating spirit and lightness. Such essays are very worthy of attention and recitation among essays. Each section of "Casual Notes on Youth" is this kind of short note full of humor, tenderness, and suggestion. It is really a very good collection of essays.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into three parts. The first part is "Casual Notes on the Light Moon," including twenty sections such as "Condensing Is the Jade Beauty Coming." The middle part is "Casual Notes on the Tender Breeze," including fifteen sections such as "The Girl Left Behind." The last part is "Casual Notes on the Fine Rain," including ten sections such as "Marriage Proposal Letter." Most of what is described here is the tender and beautiful school life, about men, women, teachers, and students. "For example, 'The Moon Is Especially Bright in Mid-Autumn' writes about life outside the school, while 'A Song of Manjianghong' describes the rhyme inside the classroom. 'The Girl Left Behind' writes about excessively beautiful girls, and 'The True Story of Ah Zheng' gives you a completely different taste. 'Affectionate But Annoyed by Ruthlessness' takes the pursuit of women by men as a typical example, but the pursuit also indicates that girls are also pursuing men in the same way. He can also use historical events to describe modernity, such as Du Fu's lover, making a scene in the palace, being obsessed, and also as if he once knew each other at the mouth of Wuyi Temple, allowing modernity to blend into the old poems. Sometimes, he is joking and saying something like a 'Snow Breakthrough Record,' but he also attaches importance to love ethics and writes a 'Brief Essay on Love Ethics,'" (words from the preface to the yellow shirt) In each section of this book, we can glimpse all kinds of beautiful relics worth remembering and envying. Love and strength are facts full of content. This theme is exceptionally wonderful.</p>
<p>As for his unique style, it can also be seen in several paragraphs pointed out in the preface to the yellow shirt, such as his ethereal, humorous, suggestive, and tender style. For example,</p>
<p>"Suddenly, the lights were dimmed. Who dimmed them? I don't know, maybe they like to sit in the dark room to see the light moon and silver light? Maybe it's so that no one can see whose face is blushing?" This paragraph in the section that was not described in the emotional part can be used as an example of an ethereal style. Also, for example, a paragraph at the place where charming eyes are full can be used as an example of humor and suggestion, "Ms. Cai was originally smiling, but now she is showing her teeth even more, and throwing down a flower again. I robbed her of throwing down all the flowers, but I no longer robbed her. The flower girl sang a good song and carried an empty basket."</p>
<p>Again, for example, "When your love cannot find a home, you feel that every girl in the universe has a charming charm. From the girl's body, there are all beautiful colors, all quiet sounds, the eyes are light green, the face is tender red, and everyone knows that the hair is dark and oily. Every sentence contains temptation and tenderness," how tender this is.</p>
<p>In the above paragraphs, we can see the general style and style of the author, but the reality of the content cannot be shown, because of the length of the article, I cannot copy a whole section, so that readers can see a little, but even if I did not copy it and give you an outline, however, if you like to know something about the general college life, I think it is worth buying a copy to read. If you are a member of the university, then you must read it, you can know whether your knowledge is as broad as the author's, and you can also find that there are such beautiful deeds embellishing your life circle.</p>
