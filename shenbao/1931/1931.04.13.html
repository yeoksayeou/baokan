<h3>日本兩政黨</h3>
<p>日本之政黨。取法英美。而爲兩大政黨之握權。以前政友會常處優勢。故執政８</p>
<p>權之時亦多。自前屆内閣失政而後。民政黨代而起。其間雖因倫敦海會。及緊縮政策等。受政友會猛烈之攻擊。然爲時勢之關係。不能以是推倒民政黨之内閣也。自濱口總理被刺而受傷。政友會復以代理總理。及濱口健康爲種種攻擊之具。究以非政策上之失敗。仍不能推倒民政黨之内閣近因濱口之傷未能全愈且至復病。於是濱口内閣。遂不得不總辭職。聞繼内閣之任仍爲民政黨之若摫。是内閣雖易。而民之政黨之政權不移。是亦可知日本將來政局之趨向矣。</p>
<p>總之日本民政黨之政治行動雖未必盡如日本國人之願。然較之以前政友會黨政之舉措。猶屬此善於彼而除政友會以外。又鮮其他有力之政黨。可以取民政黨而代之。故濱口内閣雖辭職。而繼其任者。仍爲民政黨人。亦時勢所應爾也。</p>

<h3>鄂建廳整理礦業辦法</h3>
<p>械分煤業鋼鐵銅鉛三項</p>
<p>漢口通信、鄂建設廳以本省礦業藴藏甚富、因財力所限、未能積極開發、特擬定８</p>
<p>整理辦法、呈報省府、對於過去情形、及今後整理方案、論述極詳、茲節錄原呈８</p>
<p>如下、</p>
<p>（上略）查本省礦業豐富、寳藏甚多、祇因財力所限、未能積極開發、謹就現時實際情形、規畫整理辦法、敬爲鈞府分析呈之（一）煤業　查本省煤業、有柴煤烟煤二種、如大冶陽新廣濟等縣、近年各處礦廠因８</p>
<p>匪共滋擾、大半停頓、僅大冶所屬之石灰窰一帶、每日尙能出煤約千噸、差足供給８</p>
<p>武漢附近日用之半、益以湖南衡寳運來、市塲上尙無求過於供之現象、而他處菜８</p>
<p>煤之輸入、漸告絶跡矣、烟煤産於大冶廣濟武昌薄圻柹歸宜都等縣、儲量不豐、産額亦微、僅能供熬酒打鐵及零星小輪之用、查武漢附近、每年需烟煤約五十萬噸、自民國十三年以來、平漢粤漢二路交通時斷、國煤無法運輸、致英日之煤充斥８</p>
<p>市塲、利權外溢、良足痛心、現値削除匪共之時、除平漢粤漢沿路之烟煤、應請實業部轉咨鐵道部、飭令各路局、對於國煤運輸、予以特殊之便宜、以資抵制外、擬定整理公私煤礦辦法二項於左、（甲）公礦查炭山灣礦區廣裏、其老廠之柴煤、黃獺捕魚等處之烟煤、　富質優、交通便利、公家曾投資百餘萬元、自民十六招商承辦後、該承租公司貪圖近利、祇知挖洗煤柱、毫不進行工程、致繼續承辦之民生公司迄今尙無開採成績、職廳擬派工程８</p>
<p>人員前往切實勘查、擬定計劃、責成該公司、於短期内切實整頓、若仍故意逶遊、則準備收歸公辦、作大規模之開採、以促煤業之發展、又禹七煤礦、位於圻州對岸、柴煤之儲量尙豐、公家曾投資數萬元近年被匪共盤踞、損失甚鉅、現該處旣經平靖、擬即依照炭山灣煤礦成例、招商８</p>
<p>承辦、以資恢復、而興地利、（乙）乙礦、查本省商辦各煤礦、除大冶富源富華等礦、延用技術人員、依照新法開採、頗著成效外、餘多貪圖近利、不知進行工程、一任礦工因循舊法、隨意挖掘、故經營者多遭失敗、耗費財力、損失信用、影響礦業前８</p>
<p>途、至爲重大、擬即賡續原定計劃、組織鑛産調查隊、分區調查、一以測繪礦圖、考查地質、一以指導開採、改善經營、一８</p>
<p>以催繳稅欵、嚴禁私採、俾整理改良、能收事半功倍之效、</p>
<p>（二）鋼鐵　查整理漢冶萍公司委員會曾擬具整理辦法、於十七年一月呈奉國民政８</p>
<p>府核准在案、迄今未見實施、該漢冶萍公司積欠本省公欵二千餘萬兩、爲執行債權計、惟有將其煉廠收歸省有、故職廳曾於去年擬具恢復漢陽鐵廠計劃書、呈請鐵道部曁建設委員會撥欵開工在案、其計劃書主要點、爲利用象鼻山之鐵砂、及萍鄕之焦煤、暫開鐵爐一座、煉鋼爐二座８</p>
<p>或三座、每年出鐵約七萬噸、以三萬噸供８</p>
<p>給國内市塲之需要、四萬噸煉鋼、鋼之出品以路軌爲大宗、其餘鋼板鋼條及各色８</p>

<p>事館、不受我國地方政府管理、至護理市長臧啓芳期内、以自來水關係全市衛生、百餘萬市民性命所寄、非收回管理權、由地方政府監督不可、乃迭派科長張銳向英總領事　蘭思交涉、該公司始承認由當地地方政府監督、現聞該公司華股、約佔三分之二、但其實權、仍操諸英人之手、重要職員、無一非英人自兼、每年營業狀况、因該公司秘不宣佈、外人鮮有知者、去年政府向其調查、亦遣拒絶、惟據内部華工所云、每年可凈紅利三四十萬元、其發達情形可知、上月二十一日、全體華工、因被公司時加壓迫與虐待、乃要求改良待遇、並由工人所組織之工會、提出條件十二條、請公司承認、在未解决前、全體工人實行怠工、對於全市用水　　照常供給、條件内容、（一）增加工人　　每月在三十元以内者、加十分之五、六十元以内加十分之四、六十元以外加十分之二、並於每屆三個月爲增薪日期、（二）津貼工人房費、（三）開除營私舞弊之監工沈兆發總稽查馬少卿總賬房陳受之、（四）津貼出外工作工人、每月三元、（五）發給年老或病故之養老金、（六）　照工廠法凡星期日及革命紀念日、一律放　、其職務重要不能休假者、應付雙資一日、（七）發給年終花紅一次、六十元以外者一月、六十元以内者兩月、（八）上下工人、須得雙方同意執行、（九）工人因工作殞命或積營病故、及殘廢者、應由公司發給撫卹金一次、（十）工人患病、由公司担任醫藥費、告假者照給工資、年終發放雙薪、（十一）工人夜班値工、公司應增加飯費二角、有工作者、照發一日工資、（十二）工會成立工人子弟學校、請公司補助費每月二百十元、以資襄助、以上條件、公司接到後、非惟不承認、即依８</p>

<p>▲恊會昨日舉行重要代表會議</p>
<p>▲决定本年六月選擇球隊隊員</p>
<p>丨下屆分區賽在漢口丨</p>
<p>丨分區賽規約將公佈丨</p>
<p>全國體育恊進會、乘此分區足球賽時、各區領袖齊集滬上之便、昨日特召集重要會議、討論明年在美舉行之世界運動會派遣足球隊參加事會議午刻舉行於恊進會、恊會名譽主幹沈嗣良主席出席會議者、華北代表馬約翰、華中代表宋如海、華東代表樂秀榮、本埠蜀英足球隊代表劉光美、及郭禮均華南代表高錫威、事前曾去電請其來滬會議、　電謂因事不能脫身、决議悉同意、經各代表鄭重考慮、嚴密討論後、决議明年世界運動會、决派遣足球隊參加、詳情記後、尙有其他關係分區足球賽之决議案、並錄之如下、</p>
<h3>足球隊决赴美</h3>
<p>丨六月間選擇隊員丨</p>
<p>丨組織選擇委員會丨</p>
<p>中國體育在技術上或較人落後、然精神上並未稍遜、明年世界運動會將於七月底在美國洛上安琪舉行爲發揚中國運動精神、各代表對於派遣足球隊赴美參加比賽、一致贊成通過並决定辦法如下、各區體育機關、於本年六月前、舉荐照區内最優秀之足球員至全國恊會、然後齊集滬上、由恊會組織選擇委員便、分隊舉行試賽、由選擇委員會按試賽之成績、選取賽員、組織中國足球隊、再由恊會派員率領赴南洋新加坡等處比賽、以資練習、而得經騐、同時亦可　得赴美經費、其所以在六月間舉行試賽、及赴南洋比賽、則以球員中、大半爲學生、重視學案、以免荒廢、故以暑假爲最適宜、至於南洋之氣候、六月８</p>
<p>與平時、無甚大異云、</p>
<h3>下屆之分區賽</h3>
<p>丨爲提倡華中體育丨</p>
<p>丨决定在漢口舉行丨</p>
<p>次議决下屆之分區賽日期及地點、華中代表宋如海起立謂華東華南、體育空氣、已極濃厚、華北已然、惟華中一帶、則黯然無生氣、爲提倡華中體育、及鼓動華中運動興趣起見、請决定下屆之分區足球賽在漢口舉行、一致贊成通過、惟如設備不及、或他種原因、萬不得已時、則改在華北、日期仍在春假時、以免荒廢事業或學業、</p>
<h3>公佈分區賽規</h3>
<p>丨審查後分寄各省丨</p>
<p>丨下屆請一致參加丨</p>
<p>全國分區足球賽規約、向無成文、惟各區皆意會而已、茲爲鄭重起見、蜀英足球隊代表劉光美起請訂立規約、審查公佈、並分寄各省區、以便有所遵守、而事前得可預備、分寄時、並請各省區、一致參加下屆比賽、列席會議者、尙有郭禮均、爲熱心體育之先進、現於川省業商、大會代表亦决議請其回川後、極力提倡華西體育云、</p>
<h3>分區足球賽昨閉幕</h3>
<h3>華東榮獲本屆錦標</h3>
<p>▲五比零擊敗華北</p>
<p>丨華北隊今晨北上······華中隊搭輪西返丨</p>
<p>▲昨晚體育恊進會歡宴球員</p>
<p>全國屬目之第六屆全國分區足球錦標賽、自本月八日在滬逐鹿以來、華東華北均敗華中、昨日華東華北二隊會師中華棒球場、名爲分區賽之８</p>
<p>第三幕、實則不啻奪標之决賽也、結果華東五對零勝華北、獲得本屆錦標、恊進會董事趙晋卿給奬、由華東隊長戴麟經受領、三呼萬歲、一塲龍　虎門、於斜陽紅影之下、徐徐閉幕、裁判員樂秀榮、巡邊員梁國材、趙燕生、</p>
<h3>萬人空巷</h3>
<p>本屆華東人才極盛、堪與華南並峙稱雄、華南缺席、華東遂隱然可執本屆牛耳、昨日所遇之華北隊、亦係北方健兒、戰訉四傳、觀者雲集、且於大戰之前、尙有輔仨華伶之賽、於是所謂球迷者、引朋率友、高坐以待、縱目四觀、棒球塲竟成人山人海、約計人數、當在萬人以上、華東華北之戰、競爭劇烈、興味濃厚、呼喊贊許之聲、累起於四座、誠一時之盛舉也、</p>
<h3>健兒身手</h3>
<p>▲華東隊</p>
<p>陳　璞　　陳鎭和</p>
<p>李　寗　　　　　　　陳洪光（下）</p>
<p>周賢言　　　　　　馮運佑　　羅海光</p>
<p>江善敬　　　　　　　戴麟經</p>
<p>樹棠（上）陳家球</p>
<p>關洵安（下）陳虞添</p>
<p>守門周賢言、得球機會殊少、偶有一二次險球、故未曾如何顯其身手、右衛江善敬、間有一二次失足、幾貽大禍、美中不足、左衛全寗、安如泰山、穩置可取、中堅馮運佑、奔走四方、未曾嚴守其職位、兩前衛殊可取、陳璞表演、十分出色、接濟前方、球無虛發、退守監視、亦甚得力、中鋒戴麟經、昨日特殊賣力、射門甚準而有力、要亦華北未曾監視之故、陳鎭和不失本色、陳家球亦英勇異常、陳虞　未顯特技、羅海光亦戰門過烈、受傷甚重、華東隊之表演、上半時勝下半時、或亦精力漸　之故、</p>
<p>▲華北隊</p>
<p>張德江</p>
<p>王長頴　　任　兌　　黃志民</p>
<p>黃振勳　　　　　　　張國威　　趙啟春</p>
<p>羨鍾芬　　沈崇海　　黃振聲（下）</p>
<p>譚葆憲（上）</p>
<p>黃玉佳</p>
<p>華北形勢、雖遠遜華東、然英雄固、不能以成敗論之、守門黃振勛球藝已臻上乘、然偶有失之一時大意、二後衛亦較對華中時爲佳、失足甚少王長頴不時有險球踼出、中堅張國威、殊爲稱職、二前衛亦進步、前鋒亦時有攻門之機、惜舉動尙嫌稍遲、否則華東之門亦破、昨日華北最初之表演、前塲嘖嘖稱　、羣謂刮目相看、至於進攻、亦時有機會、非如一面倒者可比、槪論之、表演不可謂不滿意、華東隊中、盡爲沙塲戰將、敗於其手固猶榮也、</p>
<h3>血戰經過</h3>
<p>▲戴中鋒一頂驚四座</p>
<p>華北撥球進取、被戴中鋒截住、轉輾至左翼陳鎭和脚下、射高失效、陳左翼二度進攻、守門撲成角球、陳虞添踼來、王佳、中鋒迎之以頭、幾乎覓門而入、四座觀衆、爲之一振、</p>
<p>▲鐵蹄下周賢言顯能</p>
<p>華北全隊、表演甚佳、五虎將聯絡有致、傳跑咸速、轉眼之間、華東區域烽火四起、華北健兒、登堂入室、惟拙於射擊、又受對方監視、十决十　、忽集忽分、左翼張德江暗渡陳倉、四路互相呼應、周賢言白手入刄、鐵蹄之下、奪球出險、彩喊之聲、轟於塲中、</p>
<p>▲黃振勳大意失荆州</p>
<p>華東前鋒蓄勢以待、一球接得、分路進攻、巧設奇兵、亂人耳目、陳鎭和自左調中、戴麟經由中改左、華北右内衛慕鍾芬衝戴倒地、罰任意球、其地麟門約二十碼、陳鎭和輕輕傳中、志不在門、乃守門單臂後托、竟而入　、時爲開賽後之十五分鐘也、是球之失、　曰守門開門揖盜、或曰守門倒戈、實　咎在大意也、</p>
<p>▲戴中鋒鐵脚立奇功</p>
<p>二分鐘之内、戴中鋒在罰球區域外、猛施射擊、其時華北龍門十步方地内、全是人跡、不分彼此、一球疾去、竟然命中、守門驚駭不止、疑其如天下降也、</p>
<p>▲黃志民弄巧反成拙</p>
<p>華北達　二球、銳氣仍壯、努力進迫之結果、連得二次角球、左右翼不負使命、球高且佳、顧防守有力、難以近門、卒由周賢言交與前方、四境平安、陳鎭和二次反攻、一高一斜、球勢又轉、華北右翼入侵、繼傳塲中、黃志民身如飛燕、一馬當先大門在望、深知周之材能、不易對付、用聲東擊西法、人向右傾、球自左去、料斜出門外、弄巧成拙、北中似有天數、</p>
<p>[Ｉ&gt;華東勝華北第一球（本館攝）&lt;Ｉ]</p>
<p>▲上半塲造成四對零</p>
<p>大難不死、必有後福、斯時華東精神一振、全軍奮起、陳虞添踼角球、被内衛擋出、陳再傳前、黑面將軍陳鎭和正在躍躍欲試之際、時會駕臨、趨前一脚、球破網入、華東得第三球、接後陳鎭和踢角球、戴中鋒迎之以頭、守門躍起擒得、極非易事、又五分鐘、戴中鋒福至心靈、馮運高照、射去之球、竟至切柱進網造成上半時四對零之比數、</p>
<p>▲馬約翰帷中定奇謀</p>
<p>華北四球之失、半由於前鋒過於趨前、不及返救、下半時起、領隊馬約翰立改策略、重守不重攻、果然、華東歷次進展、深入爲難、開塲不久、羅海光倒地、腦部受震、出塲休養、由陳洪光代其職務、斯時華東或左或右、有機即入、但處處咸有防軍、不得近門、蓋華北前鋒亦多在内恊助也、</p>
<p>▲陳鎭和不愧稱猛將</p>
<p>十二分鐘之後、華東周賢言方第一次接得攻球、人後、雖略有危險、應付尙易、十八分鐘時、陳洪光挾球入侵、與華北内衛互衝倒地、球落身旁、猛將陳鎭和繼續前進、對門射擊、球出如矢、急而有力、竟自守門手中彈入、成五對零之比、嗣後華東仍不絶進取、乃對方守門技藝優美、連救險球、不致再遭失地之辱、比賽結果、五對零、華東勝、</p>
<h3>奪標總賬</h3>
<p>▲第一戰　　華北勝華中　二對一</p>
<p>▲第二戰　　華東勝華中　十對零</p>
<p>▲第三戰　　華東勝華北　五對零</p>
<p>[Ｉ&gt;華東隊隊長戴麟經手持奬杯（葉長列攝）&lt;Ｉ]</p>
<h3>歷屆戰蹟</h3>
<p>全國分區足球賽、雖濫觴宣統年間、然正式分區賽、則起於民十五、五年來參加者每僅二隊、民十七則三隊、今歲分區賽、華中亦遠道而來、作第一次之正式參加、可謂新紀錄、六年中、計華南得標三次、華東亦三次、明歲舉行於漢口、錦標又不知誰家奪得也、茲列略表如下、</p>
<p>年份　　參加隊名　　比賽地點　　錦標得主</p>

<p>▲主席報告　各位代表、各位同志、今天集合各界代表、在此舉行中國國民黨清黨四週年紀念大會、我們覺得意義非常重大、要曉得清黨、不僅有關本黨的生存、並且有關整個國家和民族的存亡問題、本黨是中國唯一的革命黨、牠的使命、是求中國國家的獨立、民族的生存、假定負撫育維護中國責任的本黨、一旦爲反動派所　竊、那末國家的獨立、民族的生存、當然也就無望、所以清黨不僅在黨史上、是最寳貴最重大的一頁、抑且爲中華民國國史上、也應該大書而特書的、現在把清黨的經過、作一簡略報告民國十一年、中國北方有一部份知識階級和日本的小數留學生、他們於政治學說上、本無深刻的研究、因國内禍亂頻仍、復　受了蘇俄革命的影響、就研究起共産主義、於社會科學無深切研究的少數靑年、自然很容易受他的迷惑、復基於愛出風頭、好奇心重、全國風行、喜歡介紹新思潮的心理狀態上、居然也就鼓吹共産主義來了、恰好蘇俄自十月革命成功以後、列强時時加以嚴重的壓迫、他們感到國基動搖、就從兩種方法對付、一使全世界弱小民衆、都起革命運動、反抗帝國主義、二使歡美各國發生階級門爭、讓他們因内戰而崩潰、他們以爲這兩種辦法、就可以鞏固蘇俄國家的地位、起初向西方發展、豈知就受到土耳其國民黨的反對、而告慘敗、於是轉變方向、向東方進攻、一部份中國的靑年、不幸就給他們利用了、起初蘇俄想獨樹一幟、領導中國革命、後來毫無成效、所以派越飛與中山先生接洽、說中國革命、唯有實行三民主義、我們蘇俄、顯以全力帮助、到了民國十二年、蘇俄又派鮑羅庭到中國來和中山先生說、帮助中國革命、是第三國際的責任、中國絶對不適用共産主義的革命、所以中國共産黨員、自當抛棄其主張、與國民黨共同奮鬥、到民國十四年、中國共産黨員就以個人資格、加入本黨、當初總理孫先生、鑒於中國共産黨員、誤入歧途、自然也想給予自新之路、所以就提出下列三個條件、第一、祇可用個人資格加入、第二不准借用國民黨招牌、宣傳共産主義、第三未脫離本黨之前、絶對須遵守本黨主義、奉行本黨政　和决議、豈知他們加入了以後、共産黨的組織、始終没有解散、反而積極活動、總理在世、他們還不敢肆無忌憚、及總理北上逝世後、他們况橫行不法、肆意　竊、旣扼據要津、把持黨權、復挑撥離間、分散本黨、忠實同志、被迫流亡者有之、陷害殘殺者有之、被詆受辱者有之、及本黨興師北伐、共黨更大起恐慌、恐怕本黨勢力擴大、難以操縱、所以就竭力反對、在他們機關報響導上、特出［論北伐］專刋一張、大事攻擊、反對北伐、及革命軍克復湖北江西、態度更顯、行動更積極把持、武漢中央命令國民政府、三次下令武漢兵工廠、不准接濟前方槍械、蔣總司令統率數十萬革命健兒、與反革命者肉搏、而共産黨徒四設陷阱、陰圖大逞、幸黨内先進吳稚暉·李石曾·蔡元培·諸先生、見黨國危機四伏、千鈞一髮、因此積極佈置、待革命軍克復江浙後、即毅然决然、厲行清黨、予千刁萬惡危書本黨陰謀賣國的中國共産黨、以嚴重的制裁、所以就有今天四一二的紀念、清黨運動、迄今、整整已有四年了、本黨黨内、固已全部肅清、但閩贛粤湘各省、均經紅匪蹂躪燒殺、生命財産之犧牲、不知幾千萬萬、創鉅痛深、言之涙下、所以我們紀念清黨、應有下列兩點努力、第一、統一黨員意志於三民主義之下、三民主義、是順應世界潮流、國内情勢、而發明的、共産黨之所以能分散本黨同志、就因爲同志對於主義的信仰、主義的認識、没有十分堅定深刻、所以共黨　雜了些似是而非的理論、本黨同忐、也會受其迷惑、清黨不僅是清除共産黨員、并且清除共黨理論、不僅剷除一切共産黨員、并且要將本黨忠實同志、絶對統一其意志於三民主義之下、否則共産黨員·共黨理論·固然清除了、但自己不振作、不能　互信共信的基礎、本黨歷史的使命、固不能　免起、殉難的烈士、固白犧牲、而中國國家和民族獨立自由生存的希望、也就從此無望、第二、努力實際建設、中國受帝國主義的侵略、八十餘年、受封建勢力的摧殘、四千餘年、到最近生産落後、實業凋零、民生憔悴、農村經濟、日漸衰敝崩潰、在全國都陷於如是不得了的局面之中、正是本黨同志作實際、建設工作的時機、倘使一般同志、還不了然自己責任之重大、反以爲革命告成、同志享福、這眞要造成亡黨的兆頭、滅國的徵象、要知道現在好像反動派是打倒了、似乎國家到了穩固安靜的地位了、須知不致力於實際工作、還不過是加重革命客觀的條件、嚴重革命客觀的形勢、所謂實際工作、就是努力地方自治、帮助政府、調查人口、測量土地、整頓警衛、宣傳本黨主義、訓練人民行使四權、致力於識字、造林、保甲、衛生等七項運動的工作、同志之間、尤須親愛精誠、努力黨的工作、這纔對得住盡瘁以　死的總理、爲國殉難的烈士、最後關於國民會議、也希望大家注意、國民會議、關於我國之今後建設者甚大、况且訓政時期的約法、也將在國民會議中决定、此次中央集全國精英於一堂、希望於國民會議者甚深、但是反動派竟詆國民會議爲御用、并且另行發表了許多古怪離奇的主張、希望在座代表、向各界民衆、努力宣傳、毌爲反動派所愚弄、報告完了、</p>

<h3>肺癆病原菌脫蠟術新發明</h3>
<p>（一）（由最近德國結核雜誌編譯）</p>
<p>自考克博士致見結核菌爲肺結核症（即肺癆病）之病原體以來。東西結核學者爭先研究·欲期得一殺滅此菌之妙方。但其結果盡歸失敗。董因歷來一般之　家。因未明　肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性構造。以爲凡爲病菌。盡可以消毒之藥劑。用内服或注射之方法撲滅之。一如［六○六］之注射於於梅毒也。自柏格爾博士D,Bergoll苦心研究後。始發表肺結核菌有一種特殊之防禦力。能抵抗一切外來藥力之攻擊。董肺結核菌體係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜Lipoid所構成。若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其肪脂性之武裝。則無由俘擒結核菌而置之死地。且結核菌能入人體局部時。其四週即被侵蝕。而形成頑强之結節。以阻礙血流之通過。致使注射或内服之一般消毒藥劑。無由越雷池一步。宛如特别戒嚴之禁區藥力旣無從接觸患部。則雖溺沉全身於藥池中。亦不能傷結核菌之毫髮。是以撲滅肺結核菌之唯一作戰方略。至少必須具備下列之兩種先决條件。</p>
<p>（一）凡藥力能破壞結節而直　患部者。</p>
<p>（二）又能剥奪或溶解其蠟質及脂肪性之内外膜者。</p>
<p>如此始能　破關斬將之功。否則隔靴搔癢。彼結核菌且在此兩種保障之下。竊笑人之莫余害也。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>曾有哈莫塞哈黎Hammersehaly及提禮潘斯基Terebensky氏等。發現結核菌之抗酸性。係因蠟質能抗酸　然。遂應用五乃至一○%之苛性加里液。而得除去結核菌之抗酸性蠟質。後有莫純Moussn及高披爾Goupjl兩氏。應用鹽素瓦斯。而亦得除去抗酸性蠟質。然此種脫蠟法。祇能適用於顯微鏡檢查上染色法而已。蓋其藥性劇毒。對於人體終不能　用也。</p>
<p>近數年來。偶有將大楓子油應用於麻瘋症。而獲意外之奏效者。蓋麻瘋菌與肺結菌爲同性質之抗酸菌。而大楓子油能有脫蠟之作用。兼具石炭酸百倍以上之殺菌力。於是般學者。遂引起狂熱的注意。思以大楓子之油。應用於結核症患者。冀圖奏效。乃用種種之化學的方法。提出大楓子油之主要成分。然祇限於皮膚及表在性結核症。能奏良效。而對於深部的臟器。如肺臟。盰臟。賢臟等結核。則仍不能奏何等之效果。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>因此我普天下結核病者之大恩師柏格爾博士。百尺竿頭。再進一步。搜集動植礦物性各種藥物。而苦心研究。期後一種有脫蠟作用。而無大楓子油之種種缺點者。孜孜數十年。不知絞盡幾許腦汁。灑灑幾許心血。以求其最合理最純粹的化學　不已。終發見特殊動物之腸間膜腺壓縮汁中。有某一種有效成分。對於結核菌有强力脫蠟之作用。乃即將此新成分作用於結核菌。而行基兒加排特氏Ｚiehioebett則已不染紅色。而染靑色。此項結果。與他種非抗酸菌完全相同。自此東西書家所視爲人工不能除去結核菌抗酸性之主張。完全推翻。而占脫蠟殺菌劑中之最高權威。遂將此化合物實驗於動物及人體之各種結核症。均得偉大之神効。並無副作用。此實前後千古醫學界一大疑問的肺結核治療之新曙光也。</p>
<p>[Ｉ&gt;肺病患者之肺臟&lt;Ｉ]</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>肺結核之病原及病理旣　明後。柏格爾大醫聖發明之肺結核治療上理想的新醫理·亦實驗而大功告成。二十世紀唯一無二之肺結核特效藥［三那星］。Sanosin遂遵此新醫理新學說而産生。開醫學界一未有之新記錄。茲將［三那星］所含有之主要成分。臚述於下。</p>
<p>第一成分之化學名Amlnoaethylsulfonsaeure(C2H7Nso3)係由特殊動物之腸間膜腺肝臟。及海中軟體動物之血液中提取製出者也。其化學性質。無色透明。爲有光輝之四出或六出形結晶。在攝氏十二度。能溶解於十六倍之冷水。於熱湯更易溶解。但不能溶解於無水酒精及依的兒内。如以强鹽性液煮沸之。則成醋酸及亞硫酸。與水銀溶合時。則形成不溶於水之白色粉末。倘於攝氏二百四十度分解。而加以數倍之炭酸曹迷。更細密混合。加熱於白金板上。則生殘塊。據修例德博士。Dr,Sohroder之實驗報告。謂此種成分。能施直接作用於結核菌。而溶解其外膜之蠟質及脂肪質。結核菌旣失去此險要之屏藩。遂不能免避其死刑。抑尤有進者。此種成分。且有一種相當之刺激性。能使患者之胆汁增加其分泌量。且新陳代謝之機能。愈形肝盛。對於肺病　。則又能變化其結締織。而奏治療的効果。</p>
<p>）第二成分係提曼博士Ｄr,tiemann創製之KalliumSulfoouaiacollcum(C6h0OH</p>
<p>（ＯＣＨ）２ＳＯ２ＯＫ其功用能增進結核患者之抵抗力。及血清之凝結力。促進新陳代謝。增加白血球。防止結核菌之發育。有健胃袪痰消毒之特殊作用。故自現代著名結核大醫萊享白哈博士Dr,Relohenbach提倡應用於肺結核以來。德英諸國醫家莫不以此成分奉爲治療結核症之無上聖</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>綜合以上二大寳貴之主要成分。而製成［三那星］新藥。故［三那星］爲肺結核治療上空前絶後之特效新藥。確有極大之價値。茲　其醫治作用於下。</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中。實驗（三那星）之藥力作用。則一分鐘後。結核菌皆消失其抗酸性。至三分鐘後。則肺結核菌完全殺盡。無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）以内服或注射之方法。應用［三那星］於入體。則能滲入於肺臟等各臟器内部。迄十八小時後。檢查小便。則能發見Dlazo之反應。於四十八小時後。此反應即行消失。而白血球非常增加。</p>
<p>（三）依動物試驗。則發見（三那星）能滲入結核病　内、設檢查其病　内潛伏之結核菌。則　失其抗酸性·此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。</p>
<p>（四）内服［三那星］約一星期左右·則可見略痰之稀釋。體熱之下降。及心身愉快等之狀態。　　（五）更繼續内服（三那星）達一二個月以上。則顯見體重增加。食慾激進。一切症狀。逐漸緩和。終達其回天再造之偉功。</p>

<h3>誌法國葡萄酒</h3>
<p>— 黎叔平</p>
<p>每誦王翰葡萄美酒之句。輒爲社往。迨留學法國。始得飽嘗佳釀。玉醴金漿。飲之大快。釀酒葡萄藤。高不滿三尺。盤旋如蓋。葉密實肥。具紅白二種。宜植於氣溫士乾之區。冬日葉落。莖須結草以護。法國葡萄初傷於蟲。後經移接美種。乃日趨發達。及一八七五年。已遍全國。産量歲有增加。釀酒最美者。允稱香賓尼Champagne博赫多Bordeanx産。　　葡萄成熟時期。在七八月間。千萬聯珠。紫紅翠綠。鮮艶欲滴。斯時男女提籠挈籃。入園採摘。法人謂之Vendanger瓊漿旣飽。或歌或舞。其樂無藝。此鄕間居民朝夕盼望之盛會也。</p>
<p>葡萄大别爲紅白二種。紅酒係以摘下鮮紅葡萄搗爛。盛以木甑。使之發酵。隔五六日。熱度漸高。待涫沸時。榨壓其汁。遂成酒白酒則不使發酵。即瀝漿注瓶。廿香可口。惟乏酒味。蓄藏數月。乃漸變化。香賓即白酒中之名貴者。産自香賓尼。至李格Liqueur酒之醞。係取極熟葡萄汁。先加香料。繼調顔色。注入杯中。璀璨奪目。芬馨四溢。不飲已覺先醉矣。</p>
<p>法國習俗。每餐必進酒。且飲且食。非若吾國之必先酒而後飯也。日常用膳。多進紅酒。節儉之家。喜和水飲。香賓可稱交際酒。蓋非重大聯歡。宴請上賓。殊鮮用之。但在舞場。亦有進者。索値頗昻。每瓶數十金。凡新酒上市。各酒店咖啡館皆高縣［甜白酒］牌。以廣招徠。</p>
<p>酒爲法國重大商業之一。運銷全球。年入甚鉅。自美國厲行酒禁以來。國際貿易大受影響。因此國内供過於求。各大酒商多告停業。近來政府爲補救之計。於國内乃極力提倡消費。而於出口貿易則特别减輕稅率。以期暢銷焉。</p>
<h3>病榻談醫錄</h3>
<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<p>昔人詩云。多病漸知醫。惟　生則恒與藥壚茗碗爲緣。而醫終借手於人也。况乎周妻之累。近七八年。每當其呻吟牀第。藥石無靈之際。輙起十年悔不讀醫書之恨焉。然余雖不知醫。而頗喜談醫。以年來延醫旣多。路有識别之經騐耳。</p>
<p>今年二豎。分外情親。雖有送客之文。逐貧之賦。莫能爲力也。春初臥奔牛。依戚沈家。初以病齒。延及頸部。腫與腮齊。乃就治於鎭上中醫張君錦鴻。張君術兼内外科。故海上名醫丁甘仁高足也。診斷爲舌根痰毒。旣爲立方。旋復出一紙膏藥。爲余貼患處。余則告以昔年曾患此狀。貼膏藥後。外平而内轉劇。反增痛苦。因有戒心。君笑曰。無妨也。外症散法。有熱性的散。有凉性的散。君曩所遇者。乃熱性散耳。今我所用爲凉性。毌因噎廢食也。已而果如其言。遂報以小詩云。海上丁公稱國手。醫宗仲景是家風。淵源學術眞傅在。入世神仙濟世功。</p>
<p>近代丁醫勃興。駸駸有奪中醫席之勢。然余以爲西醫科學也。中醫哲學也。論辨症之精微。用藥之細切。靑囊妙術。恐非科學方法所可幾及者。惜乎中醫多私家自秘。罕取公開研究。不克善承先哲墜緒發揚而光大之耳。憶前月旅夜。吾宗少磬先生相値錫山。暢談醫界。謂其子婦曾病混溫。地方醫者。咸以病人體弱。率用清補之方。抱投鼠忌器之心。遂成養虎貽患之象。遷延逾旬。幾不台已。幸最後得徐衡之君自申來。力排衆議。獨取攻法。謂救主必先逐賊。譬之屋宇雖朽壞。而有賊在室。談不到修葺也。連下兩劑。而病果退。因得轉危爲安。在此一髮千鈞之際。其識旣眞。其膽自壯耳。徐爲武進人。今在滬創設中國醫學研究社。具見其致力者已深。而將大有造於中醫界也。</p>
<h3>誌蒂賽圖案展</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>世有需之愈急而視之愈淡者。其今日圖案之謂乎。圖案乃工藝之母。外人工商業之所以發達。與中國工商業之所以不發達。其故雖多端。而圖案之能否應用。亦其最大之樞紐。今日而欲提倡國貨。發展實業。以謀與舶來品分庭抗禮。則圖案之刻不容緩。乃爲當然之事。今提倡國貨與發展實業之呼聲。甚囂塵上。而獨於至要之圖案寂然無聞。即有一二有志之士。發奮研究。以圖挽頽風於萬一。及其學成而所謂大實業家者反熟視無賭。致使英雄無用武之地。將廢然思返。自悔孟浪。是中國圖案永無發展之希望。而中國工商業將永不能與舶來品並駕齊驅矣。謀國之士。肉食諸君。其亦悚然知所懼乎。</p>
<p>今日中國藝術雖不發達。而所謂新的藝術家也者何止數千。藝術學校雖不多。而所謂公私藝術專科學校者。亦在十校以外。獨所謂圖案家者。據余所知。全國不過數人。設圖案科者祇有西湖與北平兩處。而學生寥寥。與西畫科相較僅及十之一。此鳳毛麟角之圖案家。分配於地大物傳之中國。宜其奔走汗流。日無暇晷矣。而乃仍不免有學無所用之嘆。則社會人士之漠視圖案。蓋可見矣。王綱君今日圖案界後起之秀也。曾於去年開個人圖案展於海上。余旣有文以述之。今又將其在西湖藝專所敎圖案科學生之成績百數十幅。公展於南京路國貨商場。空谷足音。聞之色喜。乃往一觀。種類甚多。如磁器。地氈。印刷。木器。漆器。裝飾。宣傳等。無不應有盡有。其色彩之調和。構圖之奇妙。參酌中西。融融古今。富麗堂皇。盡美盡善。如季春丹程尙俊蔡振華劉漢光邱璽王汝良諸君。俱有靈敏之天才。與熟練之手法。於以見王君敎授有方。而徵中國並非無圖案人才。此後甚望勿懈其志。爲中國圖案界放一異彩。而所謂大實業家者。亦希稍節其偷工减料之心思。而一注意於圖案。則吾國實業前途。庶有豸乎。</p>
<h3>續古代婦女裝飾考</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>昨讀儉父君之［古代婦女裝飾考］。覺字裏行間。古色古香。趣味盎然。一時技癢。爰續搜數則。以爲之補。但仍屬滄海一粟。遺漏甚多也。</p>
<p>▲袿　婦人之上服也。後漢書。袿裳鮮明。亦作飾物。　康詩。微風動袿。</p>
<p>▲襡　亦作襡。亦與袿似。晋書。使妓女服袿襡。</p>
<p>▲纖　亦袿飾類。漢書。蜚纖埀　。</p>
<p>▲纓　古人十五許嫁則著之。儀禮。主人出。親說婦之纓。</p>
<p>▲欄裙　按即袜胸。自後圍向前以束腰者。故又名合歡袜裙。</p>
<p>▲衵服　亦袜胸之類也左傳。陳靈公與夏姬通。姬贈以衵服。靈公以示嬖臣孔寗儀父。互相戲謔。穢史播騰。</p>
<p>▲衫子　秦始皇詔言。人皆服衫子。</p>
<p>▲褘衣　禮。五皇褘衣。畫　於衣以爲飾也。</p>
<p>▲銖衣　賈至詩。舞怯銖衣重。</p>
<p>▲紕　詩經。素絲紕之。</p>
<p>▲縭　爾雅。婦人之緌謂之縭。按即香纓也。</p>
<p>▲香囊　繁欽詩。何以致叩叩。香囊繫肘後。</p>
<p>▲　　　蝁書。鄧攸傳。夢近水邊。見一女子。猛獸自後斷其　囊。</p>
<p>▲裎　系玉佩之帶也。</p>
<p>▲帨　　女子之巾。韓愈詩。長女嘗及詩。誰爲出帨　。</p>
<p>▲幗　亦巾屬也。古時婦女皆佩之。故今稱婦人曰巾幗。</p>
<p>▲　　玉製之耳環也。古詩。腰若流紈素。耳著明玉璫。</p>
<p>▲豫　急就篇。襐飾刻畫無等雙。按襐飾在兩耳後。刻縷而爲之。</p>
<p>▲珥　簪類。史記。夫人脫簪珥叩頭。</p>
<p>▲玉搔頭　褚載詩。娟嬋人墜玉搔頭。</p>
<h3>矛盾</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>有一個哲學家說。［人生原是矛盾的］。我不相信。然而事實上。一個人在生活的過程中。矛盾的事。却常時層出不窮。人生是矛盾的話。畢究有一部分可信。試舉例如下。</p>
<p>最近倫敦的機器脚踏車總會。延請馬立師伯爵來演講。馬立師是英國一位有名的汽車商。理應如何的向公衆提倡汽車然而在他這次的演說中却竭力的贊揚機器脚踏車最後他更說。［假使社會上的人。個個買了汽車。他們對於安適與快樂仍舊不能有完美的解决］。</p>
<p>還有英國的儲蓄運動會的董事長西萊君。他最近對人說。他於是近十餘年來竭其全力以提倡儲蓄。可是他一生來。却未嘗儲蓄過半文錢。你想此非務盾而何。</p>
<p>其他矛盾的事還多着呢。有一個牙科醫生因腐齒而身死。一個對於毒特極有研究的科學家却因誤食毒物而喪命。英國皇家大學裏的　默士伯爵。是現代一個著名的科學家。却最喜歡看一般陳腐的神怪小說。……</p>
<h3>印度遊記（二二）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>元奘傳殊不易讀。多英文新拚梵名。即中國人名亦雖考。間接猜之而已。當然西人列之於探險家之列。於世界文化交通上占位置也。中國前後來印度游學者凡七百餘人。死者亦不少。該書舉出來印者有高麗人交趾支那人。惟無目本人。元奘法顯兩人之名。小兒亦知之。因不但英文。即孟加拉等土語亦述其事。且每年各校考試。常以此命題也。我以爲中國亦當如此。若班起蘇武張騫及明之鄭和三太保下西洋者應編爲敎科。以振起少年遠略之思想也。</p>
<p>佛之年代甚難考。中國佛歷用二千九百五十餘年。據道階法師云。是從漢明帝夢金人上溯一千年。而印度佛歷今年才佛滅二千四百七○年也。然自唐元奘時已考不游。彼時已有一千二百年九百年一千五百年一千年諸說。今更千餘年。何以詳考乎。</p>
<p>元奘事之最榮譽者。爲兩國王共爭延其爲法師一事。西拉地太Siladity大王國爭元奘而索小王在馬拉Kurmara之首。小之懼。乃送唐僧於大王。大王大喜。頂禮之。爲召各印度十八國代表大會。發表唐僧之講演。無敢駁者。其王之大象凡有三個。臨行贈以三千金葉。一萬銀葉爲路費。此留學生之最如榮典也。而以外衆人所贈禮物亦萬種。羅列凡百行、以此知印人完全爲文化而敎導四方。其貢獻眞不少也。</p>
<p>西人重調查。今應組織東方文化會。由長出發。按照唐僧等日記考之。則可比較千餘年之變化。又今遊印者。恒河上游殆無人去。若忍耐從西北下來。佛跡甚多可考也。以後來印度者。必須帶漢文三書。西域記佛國記及南海寄歸傳。余未帶各書。讀英文者頗隔閡也。</p>
<p>元奘時代。加爾吉打佛敎甚盛。云有二十四廟。今印度國無一佛廟。惟錫蘭人來蓋之。印人言佛乃我國一小兒。我之土産也。我哲學文化如寳山佛不過山上之一塊石。並無奇怪。相并亦不遠。故來印者應速習印度文字。方可知之。此言在佛敎徒以爲外道之言。然今日一切哲學。比較研究爲要。印度四五千年保守其印度敎。至今佛敎早已滅亡。印人並不介意。如山上去一石耳。其誇大如此。必有可觀。甚盼多人來留學。以研究其究竟也。</p>

<h3>紗花上週標紗遠期較疲</h3>

<h3>Recent News on Extraterritoriality Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government is determined to abolish extraterritoriality and convene the National Assembly at the same time. However, regarding the extraterritoriality negotiations, it does not want to adopt methods other than friendly negotiations first. It has ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the relevant ambassadors to come to Beijing within a week to resolve the issue. If they continue to delay, a declaration will be issued, announcing the suspension of negotiations and adopting resolute measures to realize the original demands and fulfill the people's demands. (Central News Agency Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to today's news, Britain and the United States have largely the same opinion on the move to abolish extraterritoriality in China. The US authorities are now resisting criticism of Foreign Minister Wang's declaration on this issue on Friday. When the Secretary of State, Mr. Stimson, was asked about this matter, Mr. Stimson only said that this declaration has not been formally verified. Ambassador Woodhead, who is handling these negotiations, told the Associated Press reporter that the current situation is actually the same as described by Foreign Minister Wang. There has been some progress in the negotiations, but it has not yet reached a point where both sides agree. To abolish this right, two important steps must be taken. The reason for the current disagreement is that these two points have not been agreed upon. However, Ambassador Woodhead did not reveal the nature of these two key points. Although Britain and the United States are taking the same attitude toward China's demands, it is reported that other countries enjoying this privilege in China do not have a unified opinion.

<h3>Suggestion to Encourage Private Investment in Purchasing Trains</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Someone suggested to the railway authorities that there is a shortage of vehicles on various routes, and it is not easy for the railway bureau to purchase more.

<h3>An Expert Discusses Salt Law Issues</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A financial expert discussed salt law issues. Some important figures and members of the Legislative Yuan advocate implementing the new salt law as soon as possible, while others advocate postponing it. Experts are currently studying a compromise method, starting with the consolidation of salt production sites. Consolidation is also a type of reform. However, consolidation cannot be completed in five or six years. In this way, both those who advocate implementing the new salt law and those who advocate postponing it can be taken care of. However, the situations of the Huai, Lu, Chuan, Zhejiang, and Fujian coasts are different and cannot be handled as expected with the same method. Consolidation requires the use of military force. For example, salt producers on the Shandong coast once resisted land survey personnel. In Henan Province, salt is produced and sold at any time, and soldiers and civilians boil and use salt locally. The situation in Sichuan and Yunnan, where salt is extracted from wells, is different from that in Huai and Lu. Therefore, it must be based on local customs. Even a single method, such as consolidating production sites, already feels like a cumbersome procedure. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Levy Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The financial authorities are carefully studying the two methods of monopolizing tobacco and alcohol and levying inheritance tax, which are expected to generate 70 million yuan annually. Some people are worried that inheritance tax is not easy to implement. According to experts, the method is extremely simple, that is, the government issues a decree that all inheritances must be signed by a lawyer and an accountant, otherwise they will not be effective. The lawyer must report to the guild and report to the inheritance tax preparation office. In this way, the numbers are certain. Small assets for which lawyers cannot be afforded may be allowed to slip through the net. But large inheritances will definitely not save this expense and leave trouble for the future. Therefore, inheritance tax will definitely generate revenue. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Use of the Huai River Guidance Committee's Boxer Indemnity Funds</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Huai River Guidance Committee is owed 40% of one-third of the British-returned Boxer Indemnity funds. The committee member and Director of the Shaanxi Construction Department, Li Yizhi, proposed to allocate 50,000 pounds from the funds to lend to Shaanxi to build a spinning mill and purchase British machinery. The repayment method is that the preparatory committee of the factory will return 10,000 pounds when ordering the goods, and continue to return 10,000 pounds when the machinery is delivered and installed. The interest will be repaid by 15,000 pounds in each of the first and second years after the factory opens. The interest rate will be handled according to the regulations of the Guarantee Interest Association. It is heard that the committee has approved this principle and will process it after the Boxer Indemnity funds are allocated. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Government Requests Return of Advances</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangxi Provincial Government submitted a report to the Executive Yuan stating that the income and expenditure for the 19th year totaled more than 17 million yuan.

It is requested that the 3 million yuan in exchange ticket advances that the province had previously collected and returned to the central government, as well as various military loan advances, be promptly allocated separately. In addition, the Ministry of Finance approved the allocation of 100,000 yuan per month for the subsidy to offset the loss of the likin tax, and the designated funds should be received accordingly.

<h3>Private Universities in Beiping Host Press</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Private University Association hosted the press today. Wang Qin, representative of Chaoyang University, presided over the meeting and said that the 300,000 yuan in Boxer Indemnity funds allocated to the Beiping municipality for education were entirely used to run national schools. Private schools only get 10,000 yuan per month for China and 20,000 yuan per month for China-France. Other schools receive no compensation. The association believes that this violates the spirit of equal treatment, so it requires the government to distribute the funds evenly. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Two Political Parties</h3>
<p>Japan's political parties have followed the model of Britain and the United States and are dominated by two major political parties. In the past, the Seiyūkai often had the upper hand, so it had more opportunities to hold power. Since the previous cabinet's misgovernment, the Minseitō has taken its place. Although it has been fiercely attacked by the Seiyūkai due to the London Naval Conference and austerity policies, the Minseitō cabinet cannot be overthrown due to the situation. Since Prime Minister Hamaguchi was assassinated and injured, the Seiyūkai has used the acting prime minister and Hamaguchi's health as tools for various attacks. Ultimately, it could not overthrow the Minseitō cabinet because it was not a failure in policy. Recently, because Hamaguchi's injury has not fully recovered and he has relapsed, the Hamaguchi cabinet had to resign en masse. It is heard that the next cabinet will still be led by someone from the Minseitō, such as Wakatsuki. Although the cabinet may change, the power of the Minseitō will not shift. This also shows the future trend of Japan's political situation.</p>
<p>In short, although the political actions of Japan's Minseitō may not fully meet the wishes of the Japanese people, its party governance measures are still better than those of the Seiyūkai in the past. Apart from the Seiyūkai, there are few other powerful political parties that can replace the Minseitō. Therefore, although the Hamaguchi cabinet has resigned, its successor will still be a member of the Minseitō. This is also the inevitable result of the situation.</p>

<p>Gandhi Encourages Volunteer Corps</p>
<h3>Efforts at the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Can Peace in India Last?</p>
<p>Boycott of Foreign Goods Intensifies</p>
<p>Spinning Mills Decide to Reduce the Use of Artificial Silk</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Ahmedabad, 12th - In a speech to the first group of volunteers who, led by him last year, went to Dandi to break the salt law, Gandhi revealed considerable distrust that peace in India could last. He said that he was doing his utmost to appeal for lasting peace, but felt that things were not going as desired. Gandhi then warned the volunteer corps to prepare for work at the front lines, but the final action would have to await a decision after meeting the new Governor-General, Willingdon, in Bombay.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Ahmedabad, 11th - The National University, founded by Gandhi in 1920, held a meeting today. The chairman of the base emphasized the need for a simple life for public servants, advising people not to ride in cars, but to walk. However, when necessary, airplanes could be used.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Bombay, 11th - The committee established by the Spinning Mills Association to regulate the nature of artificial silk and its scope of use has now passed a resolution supporting the agreement reached by Gandhi and some factory owners, that is, to gradually reduce the use of artificial silk until it is completely stopped by August 15th of this year, which is four months from today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides to Resign En Masse</h3>
<p>Resignation Will Be Submitted After Today's Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>Hamaguchi Retires to Become Party Advisor</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 12th - The Hamaguchi Cabinet is scheduled to convene its last cabinet meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow, after which it will submit its collective resignation. This cabinet's resignation is not due to policy failures. Therefore, many senior officials believe that allowing the opposition party to form a cabinet is not the usual way of constitutional government. Prince Saionji also has no objection to this. It is still unclear whether Minister of the Army Ugaki will remain in office. ▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 12th - After Hamaguchi resigns as President of the Minseitō Party, he will be promoted to advisor. Previously, only Wakatsuki and Yamamoto held special positions as elders among the advisors, participating in top party affairs. From now on, Hamaguchi and Yamamoto will be the elders and hold the highest positions.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 12th - What political direction will the new cabinet organized by Wakatsuki follow? This is attracting attention. It is expected to follow Hamaguchi's cabinet's policy of not issuing bonds and its austerity policy, and will first address the three major areas of administrative, financial, and tax system investigation and reorganization. The reasons for following this are: (1) The financial system reorganization, which is closely related to the lifting of the gold embargo, is initially successful. The austerity policy must be continued for at least another year, otherwise, it may lead to adverse consequences. (2) Regarding the selection of the party president, the party leaders disregarded the situation within the party and forcibly recommended those who were expected to receive the mandate, because they were concerned that Hamaguchi's cabinet's policies would be changed to complete the final responsibility for lifting the gold embargo. Therefore, it is meaningful to extend the cabinet without changing the policies. ▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 12th - The Seiyūkai criticized the Minseitō Party's recommendation of a new president, saying, "Wakatsuki is extremely wise and capable of serving as prime minister. However, since he has already retired once, the position of president feels inappropriate for him. In terms of order, Mr. Adachi should be appointed as president. Now, to have the retired former President Wakatsuki return to the stage is extremely unreasonable. If, as the world says, it is because there are concerns that Adachi would have difficulty maintaining power, and therefore Wakatsuki is asked to return as Feng Fu, then it can be said that there is no belief in party politics at all. In short, the Minseitō Party, whose policies have shown flaws, is engaging in the transfer of power, which is an unconstitutional act."</p>
<h3>Portuguese Revolution's Situation Worsens Daily</h3>
<p>Troops Disobey Transfer Orders</p>
<p>Capital Declares Special Martial Law</p>
<p>The Turmoil is Remotely Directed by the Former President</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 12th - According to a report from Reuters' Lisbon correspondent, dispatched from Spain, the situation in Portugal is serious. Several units in the outer provinces are disobeying government transfer orders, and major developments are feared in the coming days. The government is currently able to maintain control of the overall situation.</p>
<p>▲ Kuomintang, Lisbon, 11th - The situation in Lisbon is worsening daily. Residents are ordered to stay indoors from 10:00 PM. Restaurants and food shops are forcibly ordered to close at that time. Troops stationed in the provinces continue to arrive in the capital. The cabinet is working day and night in an artillery bunker. Public buildings have been turned into troop garrisons. Soldiers and police patrol the streets in an endless stream. The military seems to be obeying the government, but arrests on suspicion of being counter-revolutionary are also frequent. Two transport ships carrying soldiers to Madeira are still anchored in the Tagus River, with warships alongside. Therefore, it is still questionable whether the current cabinet has any control over the military. As for the newspapers in Lisbon, under strict censorship, they have no choice but to consistently promote the government. It has been confirmed that the revolutionary movement in Portugal was instigated by former President Machado, who, along with other exiles, is still remotely directing everything from Paris.</p>
<p>▲ Kuomintang, Geneva, 11th - It has recently been confirmed from the League of Nations that the revolutionaries in Madeira have notified the League of Nations Secretariat that Funchal should be temporarily recognized as the capital of Portugal. However, the claim that the rebels have declared independence in Madeira and the Azores is still denied here. The revolutionary army only considers these islands as temporary bases for resisting the dictatorship. Their demand for autonomy may only be a way to cope with the outside world, and the League of Nations does not attach importance to this telegram.</p>
<h3>Spain Strengthens Currency Value Measures</h3>
<p>Government Orders Ban on Cash Exports</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Madrid, 11th - An order was issued today, announcing a strict plan to strengthen currency value, which is quite similar to the French government's measures to prevent the depreciation of the franc. (1) Travelers are not allowed to carry more than 5,000 pesetas (approximately 114 pounds sterling) of Spanish banknotes out of the country. (2) The export of gold coins or bars is prohibited. (3) International postal money orders may not send more than 1,000 pesetas. (4) The opening of peseta current accounts with gold collateral is prohibited. (5) The purchase of foreign securities not officially quoted on the Spanish stock exchange is prohibited, except for those that have been specially approved by the government and are already circulating domestically. (6) The remittance of pesetas from Spain to purchase foreign securities is prohibited. (7) Currencies purchased in violation of this order are not allowed to be transferred domestically. (8) Private banks are prohibited from holding foreign currencies. The above order stipulates that violators will be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>France Plans to Establish a Kingdom in Syria</h3>
<p>Treating Mandated Territories as Private Property</p>
<p>Italian Political Circles Express Surprise</p>
<p>▲ Kuomintang News Agency, Rome, 11th - Recently, there have been widespread rumors that France will establish a kingdom in Syria and elect Emir Aref, the son of King Hussein, as the king. Political circles in the capital are quite surprised, and public opinion is unanimously opposed. It is also suggested that the matter should first be submitted to the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations for review. A newspaper revisited former Foreign Minister Grandi's remarks some time ago, saying that the administering countries often treat the mandated territories as permanent private property that they can dispose of at will, which is a mistaken view. The newspaper also said that France has no way to control Syrian nationalism, so it uses the Arab prince as a puppet.</p>

<h3>The Status of the Kuomintang in the British Straits Settlements Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Singapore, 12th - The Shanghai New Kuomintang News Agency telegraphed yesterday that the status of Kuomintang organizations in the Straits Settlements had been resolved.

According to official sources, its status has not changed since the Governor of the Straits Settlements issued a declaration in February 1930. Any political organization related to the Kuomintang in the Straits Settlements will be banned.</p>
<h3>Notorious Murderer Arrested</h3>
<p>Multiple Cases, Trial Begins Today</p>
<p>▲ Kuomintang, Dusseldorf, 11th - Last summer, an extremely terrifying demon named Peter Gorden was discovered here, having committed twelve murders, twenty-four attempted murders, and no fewer than forty arsons. The whole city was terrified for a time, but because the demon was extremely cunning and courageous, the police were helpless for a time. Later, a clue was obtained by chance, and this unparalleled demon was arrested. The trial will begin on Sunday. People from all directions are gathering here to observe the trial, including more than 100 journalists, many criminologists from various countries, representatives from the police departments of England and France, and no fewer than 40 psychological experts hired to work on the prosecution and defense. This has attracted worldwide attention.</p>

Today, on the 10th of this month, the provincial party headquarters was established. Considering that Fulin and others lack experience in handling party affairs, we can only follow the teachings of the President, obey the orders of the Central Committee, strive to promote the Three Principles of the People, awaken the masses, and promote local construction. We are concerned that our knowledge is insufficient and we may fail. We hope to receive timely guidance to correct our shortcomings. We hereby report this and await your instructions. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully reports.</p>

<h3>Central Committee Holds Anniversary of Party Purification</h3>
<p>▲ Dai Chuanxian Reports on the Course of Party Purification</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held the fourth anniversary of Party Purification at 9:00 AM on the 12th. Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Lifu, Zhou Qigang, Zhu Jiahua, and hundreds of guests and staff members attended. Yu Youren chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Dai Chuanxian reported, briefly stating that after the death of the President, the Communist Party was determined to replace the Kuomintang's position. In the fourteenth year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held in Guangdong, and it was decided that the will of the President must be read at all meetings, and all resolutions must be based on the President's teachings, so that the Three Principles of the People serve as the highest principles of the party's platform and policies. However, Borodin and others strongly opposed it, and their ambitions were exposed. The March 20th incident in the fifteenth year was the beginning of the Party Purification action. In the sixteenth year, the decision was made to implement the Party Purification, otherwise, the party would have been destroyed by the Communist Party. The Communist Party's activities have one key point: places with high culture, strong productivity, and perfect organization are not easy to infiltrate, and even if they do infiltrate, they are easy to recover. Conversely, they are easy to infiltrate and not easy to recover. Guangzhou and Jiangxi are clear examples. If we want to eliminate the Communist Party, we can only work hard in both spiritual and material aspects. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Hankou Garrison Sends Troops to Encircle and Suppress He Long's Remaining Bandits</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Cheng's Division Wins Victory in Bandit Suppression in Southern and Eastern Hubei</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnants of the Red bandits led by He Long, who had previously fled from their old nest in Hefeng and Wufeng, have scattered to Zigui and other counties in eastern Hubei. They have been repeatedly attacked by the 7th Route Army's Wang Lingji Division, E Guo's Brigade, and Xu Yuanquan and other units responsible for bandit suppression and local pacification in Hubei, Sichuan, and Hunan, and Hefeng and Badong have been successively recovered. He Long's bandits then fled to Xingshan County on the 9th of this month. After receiving the report, the Wuhan Garrison believed that the bandits were exhausted and had little strength left, and should be annihilated as soon as possible. On the 11th, it telegraphed the 51st Division's Fan Shisheng unit to quickly strengthen the blockade and suppression in the Xiangfan, Nanzhang, and Baokang areas. At the same time, it telegraphed the three generals Xu Yuanquan, Wang Lingji, and Guo Xun to advance on Xingshan in three routes. After receiving the orders, the units immediately moved out and arrived at their designated locations by the evening of the 11th, making firm contact and scheduling a general attack on the remaining bandits in Xingshan at dawn on the 12th. In addition, the remaining Red bandits in Zhujiahe and Shangchewan, which belong to Jianli, seem to be in contact with He Long's bandits. The Garrison also ordered Xu Yuanquan to instruct the newly organized 2nd Brigade of Liu Peixu to suppress them, and ordered the naval vessels Xianning, Jiangkun, and Desheng to strictly seal off the river surface in the Yuezhou and Linxiang areas to prevent any sneak crossings. In the months since He Long's bandits invaded Hunan and disturbed Hubei, many bandits have been killed or wounded. Therefore, once they are encircled and suppressed this time, they will scatter. The bandits in Zhujiahe and Shangchewan are even weaker and easier to eliminate. It is reported that Xu Yuanquan has scheduled to fly to Sha on the 14th to direct the pursuit and suppression, and is determined to thoroughly eliminate the bandits in western Hubei within this month. In the Hanchuan Ximakou area, there are Red bandits disturbing the area. The 2nd Supplementary Regiment of the 44th Division, led by Fu Peiliang, stationed there, has destroyed the bandit dens in Caijiaji and Ximakou, confiscated the pseudo-district government and county government in the Nanhe area, and captured many bandits. On the Wuhan-Changsha route, Red bandits invaded Gaoqiao on the 9th and were jointly suppressed by the Su Battalion of the 79th Regiment of the 14th Division stationed there, two infantry companies, a machine gun company, and the 611th Regiment sent by the 11th Division. The bandits fled to Yangxin. The 81st Regiment of the 40th Brigade of the 14th Division also eliminated the remaining bandits in Nangong Mountain, Damingshan, Changsongling, Tangjiazui, Lipu, Longhui Bridge, and Fengqiao. Also, the remaining Red bandits in the two counties of Huangmei and Guangji in eastern Hubei are currently being searched and suppressed by the 14th Division's Chen Cheng unit under the order of the Garrison. After receiving the order, Chen immediately sent the 41st Brigade to search and advance towards Huangguang. The 82nd Regiment advanced from Wangjiashan and Xujiaping, and the 83rd Regiment advanced from Wuqiang and Changbutang. There were fierce battles with the bandits, and many were killed or captured. The remaining bandits fled to the deep mountains of Daguling. Wu Degguang, the commander of the 82nd Regiment, and Zhang Qiongxin, the commander of the 83rd Regiment, continued to lead their units forward after the victory. Many bandits fled into caves, which the two regiments attacked with heavy artillery, destroying many caves. It is estimated that Wu's regiment's Qian Battalion destroyed Xiaodong in Taiping Mountain and Shandong in Gutianchong, and Zhang's regiment's Li Battalion destroyed Yangjia Cave, Wujia Cave, and Yangdifeng Cave. Que Battalion destroyed the two caves in Wujia Field and Baimasi, killing no fewer than a thousand bandits and capturing hundreds of people, all of whom were sent to the Huangmei County Government for detention. The captured firearms, knives, and spears were numerous. They are currently advancing to suppress bandits in Kaotian, Gujiao, and Daguling, and are expected to annihilate them in the near future.

<h3>Arrangement of Mining Regulations by the Hubei Construction Department</h3>
<p>Divided into three categories: Coal, Iron and Steel, Copper and Lead</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Construction Department, considering the abundant mineral resources of the province but the inability to actively develop them due to limited financial resources, has drafted 8</p>
<p>Arrangement measures and submitted them to the Provincial Government. The report elaborates in detail on past situations and future arrangement plans. Excerpts from the original report are as follows: 8</p>
<p>(Omitted above) It is found that the mineral resources of our province are rich, and there are many treasures. However, due to the limited financial resources, we have not been able to actively develop them. We hereby formulate arrangement measures based on the current actual situation and respectfully present them to your government for analysis. (1) Coal Industry: Upon investigation, there are two types of coal in our province: bituminous coal and anthracite coal. In recent years, due to 8</p>
<p>the disturbances of the communist bandits, most of the mines in counties such as Daye, Yangxin, and Guangji have been shut down. Only the Shihuiyao area under Daye can still produce about 1,000 tons of coal per day, which is barely enough to supply 8</p>
<p>half of the daily needs near Wuhan. With the addition of coal transported from Hengbao, Hunan, there is no oversupply in the market. The import of vegetable 8</p>
<p>coal from other places has gradually disappeared. Bituminous coal is produced in counties such as Daye, Guangji, Wuchang, Boqi, Zigui, and Yidu. The reserves are not abundant, and the output is also small, only enough for brewing wine, blacksmithing, and small-scale wheels. It is found that Wuhan and its vicinity require about 500,000 tons of bituminous coal annually. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, traffic on the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways has been intermittent, and domestic coal cannot be transported, resulting in 8</p>
<p>the market being flooded with British and Japanese coal, and the outflow of interests is truly heartbreaking. Now is the time to eliminate the communist bandits. In addition to the bituminous coal along the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways, it should be requested that the Ministry of Industry forward a request to the Ministry of Railways, ordering the railway bureaus to provide special convenience for the transportation of domestic coal to resist foreign coal. Two measures for arranging public and private coal mines are proposed on the left: (A) Public Mines: The Tanshanwan mining area is vast, and its anthracite coal in the old mines, as well as the bituminous coal in Huangda Catching Fish and other places, are of 8</p>
<p>superior quality and have convenient transportation. The government has invested more than one million yuan. Since the recruitment of merchants to undertake the operation in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the lessee companies have been greedy for immediate profits, only knowing how to excavate and wash coal pillars without carrying out any engineering work. As a result, the Minsheng Company, which continued to undertake the operation, has not achieved any mining results to date. The department plans to send engineering 8</p>
<p>personnel to conduct thorough surveys, formulate plans, and instruct the company to earnestly rectify the situation within a short period of time. If it continues to deliberately delay, it will prepare to take it over for public operation and carry out large-scale mining to promote the development of the coal industry. In addition, the Yuqi Coal Mine, located on the opposite bank of Qizhou, has abundant anthracite coal reserves. The government has invested tens of thousands of yuan, but it has been occupied by communist bandits in recent years, resulting in huge losses. Now that the area has been pacified, it is planned to follow the example of the Tanshanwan Coal Mine and recruit merchants to 8</p>
<p>undertake the operation to restore and develop the land. (B) Private Mines: Upon investigation, among the privately operated coal mines in the province, except for mines such as Daye Fuyuan and Fuhua, which employ technical personnel and adopt new methods for mining and have achieved considerable results, most of them are greedy for immediate profits and do not know how to carry out engineering work. They allow miners to follow old methods and excavate at will. Therefore, many operators have suffered failures, wasted financial resources, lost credit, and affected the future of the mining industry. 8</p>
<p>This is extremely important. It is planned to continue the original plan, organize a mineral resources survey team, and conduct surveys by district, one to survey and map mineral maps and examine geology, one to guide mining and improve operations, and 8</p>
<p>one to collect taxes and strictly prohibit private mining, so that arrangement and improvement can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(2) Iron and Steel: The Arrangement Committee of the Hanyeping Company once drafted arrangement measures, which were submitted to the National Political 8</p>
<p>Government for approval in January of the seventeenth year, but have not been implemented to date. The Hanyeping Company owes the province more than 20 million taels of public funds. In order to enforce the debt claim, the refinery must be taken over by the province. Therefore, the department drafted a plan to restore the Hanyang Iron Works last year and submitted it to the Ministry of Railways and the Construction Committee for appropriation to start construction. The main points of the plan are to utilize the iron sand of Elephant Trunk Mountain and the coking coal of Pingxiang, temporarily open one iron furnace and two steel furnaces, 8</p>
<p>or three furnaces, to produce about 70,000 tons of iron annually, with 30,000 tons to be supplied to 8</p>
<p>the needs of the domestic market, and 40,000 tons to be used for steelmaking. The main product of steel is railway tracks, and other steel plates, steel bars, and various 8</p>
<p>steel materials are manufactured incidentally. However, before the plant starts operation, there must be three prerequisites: (A) Clearly define the sales channels for Hanyang Iron Works products: The quality of the steel products from Hanyang Iron Works is excellent, needless to say. However, in the past, unscrupulous officials and railway bureau personnel coveted the commissions of foreign merchants and wanted to profit from them, willingly rejecting domestic products, resulting in the shutdown of Hanyang Iron Works for 10 years. There are still more than 10,000 tons of railway tracks in stock, with a value of more than one million yuan. If construction continues, more steel products should be refined to meet the needs of the domestic market. It should be requested that the central government issue a clear order to restrict all railway bureaus, arsenals, and public construction bureaus and factories across the country to purchase products from Hanyang Iron Works when there are no other coal and steel plants in operation for the time being, so that sales can be guaranteed and the previous mistakes will not be repeated. (B) Actively arrange the Pingxiang Coal Mine: After the Pingxiang Coal Mine was taken over by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, the coal above the horizontal level of the vertical shaft was gradually exhausted. The planning of the underground project was inappropriate, the cost increased, and the Zhuping and Yuehan Railways were often suspended, all of which hindered the start of operation of the Hanyang Iron Works. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate with the Jiangxi Provincial Government to rectify the Pingxiang Coal Mine, dig deep wells, streamline the coal washing platform, and improve transportation in order to reduce costs and provide the coking coal needed by the Hanyang Iron Works. In this way, the Pingxiang Coal Mine can be revitalized, and the fuel for the Hanyang Iron Works will not be scarce. This is the best of both worlds. (C) Raise 2 million yuan in advance: According to the original plan, the estimated cost of starting the Hanyang Iron Works for purchasing materials and repairing various expenses is 1 million yuan. However, arranging the Pingxiang Coal Mine is a prerequisite for restoring the Hanyang Iron Works. 8</p>
<p>Therefore, another 1 million yuan must be raised, half of which will be used for arranging the Pingxiang Coal Mine, and half of which will be used as working capital. This fund must be raised in advance for application.</p>
<p>(3) Copper and Lead: The Yangxin Copper Mine was established in the early years of the Republic of China. The government invested nearly one million yuan in developing the mine and constructing a coal plant, but it was shut down due to transportation difficulties. Although the mining area is vast, the quality has never been precisely tested. In addition, the lead in Xingshan and the copper in Nanzhang and Zhuxi have been purchased by the former official mining bureau, but no exploration has been started. It is now planned to purchase 1,500- 　drilling machines to carry out drilling. After the quality is determined, further plans for exploration and refining will be made. In summary, some are the current actual situation and methods of arrangement, and some are the completed plans that require the assistance of the central government. All of these are urgent tasks that cannot be delayed. The department is also in charge of mining administration and has an unshirkable responsibility. However, developing industry requires money. If the public and private mines in this province have sufficient financial resources, they can be developed simultaneously to promote their integrity. If the Hanyang Iron Works, which is related to the central government and other provinces, is assisted, the restoration plan will be smooth without any obstacles. Otherwise, it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice, and there is nothing to do but worry. As for oil and gold mines, they have not yet been discovered in this province, so there is no way to plan and proceed. (April 9)</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Jiangxi Defense Army Searches and Suppresses Red Bandits</h3>
<p>▲Zhang Ruigui's Brigade Stationed on the Fujian Border in Yongding</p>
<p>▲Hua and Zhang's Brigades Eliminate Ma'anshan and Chongxian</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, a group of Red Bandits in eastern Guangdong was dispersed by Luo Xiuli's replenishment regiment of the Sixty-second Division in Huidong Meitian and fled into Longtan, Lufeng, 　attacking Hekou. The Hekou garrison held their position and resisted, holding out until night. With the arrival of reinforcements from the First Company and Second Small Company of Xintian, the bandits were driven back, and one red flag and three guns were seized, and five bandits were killed. The remaining bandits fled to Nanxi. The next day, they gathered a large force and attacked Hekou again. Luo Si, commander of the defense army, sent a large force to meet them and killed a Red Bandit pseudo-regimental commander named Lin. The fleeing bandits passed through Shanghu and rushed into Xialongxu, where all the shops in the town were brutally looted. The Ye clan ancestral hall was burned down, as well as many houses belonging to the Huang family. More than 30 head of cattle were plundered, and a villager named Huang was kidnapped. Later, Luo's regiment sent out the First Battalion to join the garrison in pursuit, but the remaining bandits had already fled into the Baozi Mountain area of Zijin County and dispersed. The government troops returned to their camp and are now trying to telegraph Zijin 8</p>
<p>Jin County to send a team to intercept and suppress them. As for the Fujian-Guangdong border area, recently, due to the active search by Zhang Zhen's troops of the Fujian Army in the Yongding-Shanghang area, troops are needed to take over the defense of Yongding. Therefore, a telegram was sent to Guangdong to dispatch troops nearby to garrison. After receiving the telegram, the Eighth Route Army Headquarters ordered Zhang Ruigui's First Independent Brigade, stationed in Chao'an, to take the upstream route of the Han River and enter the Fujian border. After receiving the order, Zhang's brigade has now sent its Wang Yuan Regiment to station in Yongding via Dapu. As for southeastern Jiangxi, after the Nineteenth Route Army gradually surrounded the main force of the Red Bandits, Hua Zhenzhong's Seventh Brigade of Jiang Guangnai's division and Liang Shiji's Training Regiment were responsible for searching and suppressing the remnants of the Red Bandits in southern Jiangxi. Upon receiving the order, Liang's regiment immediately advanced towards the Ma'anshi Xiejiabao area. On the second of this month, they came into contact with the bandits and fought fiercely. On the third, they recovered Ma'anshi Xiejiabao, and the remaining bandits fled to Yudu. Yesterday, this office received a telegram from the front line from Liang's regiment, saying, [After our regiment came into contact with the bandits in Ma'anshi Xiejiabao, we occupied it on the same day. A large number of Red Bandits were killed, and dozens of officers and soldiers of our regiment were wounded or killed. We are currently searching and suppressing them.] Another telegram was received from Zhang Yan, commander of the Ninth Brigade, stating that the brigade and Yun Yinglin's regiment had broken through the Chongxian bandit nest on the 31st and attacked the bandits in Shawei, Taihe, on the third of this month and have successively conquered them. They are now ordered to return to Xingguo. The bandit forces in Xingtai are weak and cannot withstand an attack. When the general offensive order is issued in the future, it will not be difficult to eliminate the bandits, it is said. (April 8)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Oversees Suppression in Sishui</h3>

<h3>Shandong Restoration of River Works Committee</h3>
<p>▲Appointed Zhang Honglie and other nine people as members</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Yellow River project is of extreme importance. When Chen Diaoyuan was in Shandong, there was an organization of the River Works Committee, which hired important party and government figures and those with rich experience in river works as members, responsible for discussing all matters concerning river works, and Chen Diaoyuan 8</p>
<p>When transferred to Anhui, after Han Fuqu took charge of Shandong, due to the province being in a military situation and facing financial difficulties, he cancelled the River Works Committee. Now, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun believes that as the current situation has been stabilized and construction has begun, the River Works Committee should be restored as soon as possible to facilitate progress. He has drafted a proposal and a list of candidates for committee members, and submitted it to the 48th meeting of the provincial government for discussion today (10th). It was decided to restore the River Works Committee, with Zhang Honglie, He Siyuan, Cao Xinben, Peng Huiqing, Ge Xiangyi, Pan Yifen, Zhang Wenqing, Kong Lingrong, and Zhang Lianjia as committee members.</p>
<h3>The Misunderstanding Between the Jinfeng Army in Fenyang</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the Fifth Division and the Sixteenth Regiment of the Sixth Division of the Yang Xiaoou troops stationed in Lu'an mutinied twice in succession, the commander of the Fifth Division, Wang Bi, and the commander of the Sixteenth Regiment, Ding Mengling, also fled in fear of punishment one after another. Except for a few mutineers who were taken away by Wang and Ding when they fled, the remaining regiments, accepting the persuasion of the mediators, were willing to be reorganized and disbanded by the authorities. After Yang Xiaoou left and returned to Lu'an, he supervised the suppression of the escaped mutineers on the one hand, and reorganized the unturned troops on the other hand, temporarily forming two regiments, ordering Zhao Xiezhong, commander of the Fourteenth Regiment, to go to Fenyang for reorganization and disbandment, reducing it to one regiment. After the reorganization was completed, it would be directly under the jurisdiction of Shang Zhen. The location of the regiment's defense was initially planned to be in Wenshui Jiaocheng Pingyao and other counties. Later, because the troops stationed in each county were already overcrowded, only Fenyang had stationed troops, (according to Fenyang, there were remnant troops of Feng Yuxiang's Military Officer School, pistol team, mortar team, artillery regiment, guard regiment, etc., with a real number of about 1,000 people, now nominally under the control of Song Zheyuan), but the number was small, and the regimental commander Zhao Xiezhong was from Fenyang. If he was ordered to be stationed in Fenyang, the relationship between the military and the people would be harmonious, so it was decided to order the regiment to go to Fenyang. Shang Zhen thought that the troops stationed in Fenyang were all foreign troops, so he sent staff officer Tian to Fenyang to explain the intention to the responsible personnel of the Feng troops, and to find a location for the regimental headquarters. The Confucian Temple was identified, and preparations were being made. Unexpectedly, a certain irresponsible military officer of the Feng troops (reportedly the principal of the military officer school) came out to question, and his reasons were (1) Fenyang is small and cannot accommodate additional troops, (2) the people of Fenyang are already suffering and cannot bear additional burdens, (3) the troops stationed in Fenyang once mutinied in Lu'an and are no longer disciplined. After coming to Fenyang, they are afraid of being infected by bad influences. Staff Officer Tian explained to a certain military officer that although Fenyang is small, the troops stationed there are not many, which is relatively more spacious than other counties. All counties are poor, but this time the team that came to Fenyang All supplies will not be taken from the people, and even if they are taken, they will be bought and sold publicly. As for discipline, after the mutiny of the department, all the bad elements have fled one after another, and your army has always been known for its good discipline. Even if my department comes to Fenyang, the reputation of your army will be higher in comparison, and my department can also learn from it. This explanation was very tactful, but the Feng troops still did not understand and gradually showed a tough attitude. Staff Officer Tian believed that the mission he was responsible for was to negotiate a garrison area. Protesting and opposing was not only not his task, 　　In fact, people dare not make their own decisions. When he returned to the Feng troops, everything could be directly negotiated with the army commander of the army, Shang Zhen. After staff officer Tian left Fenyang, the Feng troops 8</p>
<p>They were preparing for war, setting up cannons all over the city, digging trenches around the city, closing the city gates tightly, and prohibiting entry and exit. When Zhao Xiezhong led the team to Wenshui, he received a report that the Fenyang garrison had clearly stated that they refused to allow his unit to enter the city and were actively preparing for war. Zhao Xiezhong believed that Wenshui was only 70 miles away from Fenyang. If he advanced further, a conflict would inevitably arise, so he ordered his troops to stop in Wenshui and temporarily not advance to avoid conflict. At the same time, he sent a telegram to Shang Zhen to report the situation. Shang considered</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Receive important news</p>
<p>This incident happened suddenly and was of great importance. He immediately telegraphed the central government for instructions. At the same time, he transferred a regiment of cavalry from Zhao Chengshou's troops from Datong and the Fourteenth Regiment of Yang Yaoku's division stationed in Qixian (all the officers and soldiers of this regiment were from Fenyang), who set out at night. The two regiments led by Zhao Xiezhong, which were sent to Fenyang for reorganization, are still temporarily stationed in a certain town in Wenshui, about 60 miles away from Fenyang. The Fourteenth Regiment of Yang Yaofang's troops has also been deployed to a certain town about 20 miles away from Fenyang to suspend operations. Merchants believe that this incident may be caused by misunderstanding. At this time, when the troops have just been organized and the people have begun to celebrate their rest, it is absolutely impossible to cause another conflict, which would plunge the local area into chaos. Today (6th), Wang Hu, who lives in the Jesus Hospital in Dongjia Lane, and four other Jin generals in the field, Fu Cunhuai, Li Weixin, and Zhang Ruping, were invited to his residence to discuss solutions to the Fenyang incident. It was decided that Wang and other four people would go to Fenyang immediately to report the truth here and dispel misunderstandings. No matter what, both parties must not cause unfortunate incidents because of this. Wang and other four people left by car this afternoon. The key to this matter will depend on Wang and the others' trip.</p>
<p>Tonight, I stopped late and visited Mr. Shang at his private residence to ask about the situation of the Fenyang incident. Shang said that this matter was purely a misunderstanding. Previously, after the mutiny of Wang Bi's division of Yang Xiaoou's troops in Changzhi, the department was recently reduced to one regiment, and Zhao Xiezhong was reassigned as the regimental commander. He discussed with Yang and Sun Cuiyai (Chu) and others and decided to transfer him to Fenyang for training, because there were fewer troops stationed there, and Regimental Commander Zhao was from Fenyang, hoping that he would increase his sense of responsibility for maintaining the locality because of his relationship with his hometown. After the meeting, they telegraphed the counties along the way to prepare supplies so that they could set off. After the department arrived in Qixian, Yu sent staff officer Tian to Fenyang to first explain the ins and outs to the local garrison. There were three parts of the garrison, including a pistol regiment, a mortar regiment, and a military officer school. They all belonged to the old Second Army and have now been reduced to one regiment, directly under the command of Song Mingxuan, Feng Zhi'an's division. After Tian arrived in Fenyang, because there was no senior responsible officer there, he contacted a certain adjutant of the department, who expressed himself quite well at the time. Unexpectedly, that night, Li Zhengyu, the former principal of the military officer school there, came out in opposition. The reasons he held were (1) This place already has its own army to maintain law and order, and no other troops are allowed to be stationed there, (2) The burden on the people cannot be increased any more, (3) Before receiving the order from the upper level of the army, it is difficult to accommodate them. Li ordered Staff Officer Tian to immediately stop Yang's troops from advancing. Tian replied that he had come under orders and had no right to stop him. He immediately returned to the province to report. Before Tian met with Yu, Yu had already received a report from Fenyang that the situation there had suddenly become tense. The pistol regiment and mortar regiment stationed in Yudaohe had all been moved to the city. Feng Yuxiang had also entered the city, and even dug trenches, set up cannons, checked pedestrians, and monitored the county magistrate and the director of public security. After Yu received the report, fearing misunderstanding, he not only telegraphed Regimental Commander Zhao to suspend his advance in Yangwu Town, Qixian, but also discussed the matter with Army Commander Song. At the same time, Dr. Wan of the Fenyang Jesus Hospital and the elderly father of Zhang Jiannan also came forward to mediate. A few days ago, Division Commander Feng Zhian happened to come here as well. After contacting him, Yu had formally notified the department that he would negotiate peacefully. Also, Army Commander Song recently ordered the department from Pinglei, saying that the Jin army was transferred to Fenyang for training and had no other meaning. The mother was able to start a misunderstanding recklessly. After receiving the telegram order from Song Feng, the department's attitude has eased, and the county town has emptied the barracks of Jinguan to prepare for Zhao's department to be stationed. Dongbei stayed and appointed Wu Chao to go to Qixian yesterday to test Zhao's regiment. After the test, they can set off. Yu has also telegraphed the details of the incident to the various armies, explaining the truth. The matter can now be completely concluded, Yu Yunyun. Yu asked about Feng's future residency problem and how it would be resolved. Shang said that this was another problem. The central government and the Northeast both hoped that he would go abroad as soon as possible. Yu and Army Commander Song and others also held the same opinion. If Feng goes abroad, not only will Shanxi Province be spared many difficulties, but it will also be extremely appropriate for Feng himself.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Tianjin Tap Water Labor Strike</h3>
<p>▲ The company's loss due to the 18-day slowdown is 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Tianjin's various public utilities are all managed and operated by foreigners. For example, trams and electricity are handled by Belgian merchants, and tap water is handled by British merchants. In recent years, the local government has considered taking them back, but ultimately cannot implement this due to financial difficulties. Before last year, the Ji'an Tap Water Company, although established and operating in the Chinese concession, consulted the British Consulate-General on everything. It was not managed by our local government. During the tenure of acting mayor Zang Qifang, he believed that tap water was related to the health of the entire city and the lives of more than one million citizens. Therefore, it was necessary to reclaim the management rights and supervise the company by the local government. He repeatedly sent Section Chief Zhang Rui to negotiate with the British Consul-General Lansi. The company then acknowledged supervision by the local government. It is now reported that Chinese shares in the company account for about two-thirds, but the real power is still in the hands of the British. All important staff members are British. The company's annual operating situation is rarely known to outsiders because the company keeps it secret. The government refused to investigate it last year. However, according to internal Chinese workers, the annual net profit is 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, which shows its development. On the 21st of last month, all Chinese workers, due to being oppressed and mistreated by the company, demanded improved treatment. The labor union organized by the workers put forward twelve demands for the company to recognize. Before a resolution was reached, all workers went on a slowdown. The water supply to the city was provided as usual. The contents of the demands: (1) Increase the wages of workers earning up to 30 yuan per month by 50%; those earning up to 60 yuan by 40%; and those earning more than 60 yuan by 20%. Furthermore, salary increases should be granted every three months. (2) Subsidize workers' housing costs. (3) Dismiss the supervisors Shen Zhaofa, Chief Auditor Ma Shaoqing, and Chief Accountant Chen Shouzhi, who are involved in embezzlement and fraud. (4) Subsidize workers working outside with 3 yuan per month. (5) Provide pensions for elderly or deceased workers. (6) Follow the factory law, with Sundays and revolutionary memorial days off. For those whose duties are important and cannot take leave, they should be paid double wages for one day. (7) Give an end-of-year bonus once: one month's salary for those earning more than 60 yuan, and two months' salary for those earning less than 60 yuan. (8) The hiring and firing of workers must be carried out with the consent of both parties. (9) If a worker dies as a result of work or from a chronic illness, or is disabled, the company should pay a lump-sum compensation. (10) If a worker is sick, the company should bear the medical expenses, and those who take leave should be paid their wages, and double wages should be paid at the end of the year. (11) For workers on night shifts, the company should increase the meal allowance by 20 cents, and those who work should be paid one day's wage. (12) Establish a school for workers' children with funding of 210 yuan per month from the company. After receiving the above demands, the company not only did not recognize them, but also denied the legally organized labor union. Therefore, the workers were greatly angered. The next day, they dismantled all the city's water meters, causing the company to be unable to calculate water consumption and suffer considerable losses. The Tianjin labor unions, seeing that the company did not recognize the labor union, which was tantamount to not recognizing the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, unanimously expressed their support and would not stop until the goal was achieved. At that time, acting mayor Zang Qifang and Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Xueming had not returned from Shenyang due to receiving a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang. Fearing the expansion of the labor unrest, officials from the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau mediated, but to no avail. The labor union insisted that there was no way to discuss other conditions unless the company first recognized the name of the labor union. They would not care about a long-term slowdown. The Tianjin Municipal Party Department strongly supported their view. After a standoff of several dozen days, the company gradually softened. On the first day of this month, Zhang Xueming took office as mayor and paid close attention to the prolonged labor unrest. He immediately ordered Second Section Chief Shen Dijia and Secretaries Lü Lü and Zhang Qianhua to mediate again. At this time, the company had recognized the name of the labor union and sent a letter to the municipal government explaining past mistakes. Therefore, both parties negotiated the conditions again. After about a week of mediation, a complete resolution was reached yesterday (the 8th). Regarding the first demand made by the workers, the company agreed to increase the salary by 30% for those earning 1 to 15 yuan, 25% for those earning 15 to 30 yuan, and up to 37.5 yuan for those earning more than 30 yuan. The second item was according to the original proposal. The third item was that if there was evidence, they could be dismissed. The fourth item was to issue military and ship expenses based on the original proposal. The fifth item was approved in principle. The sixth item was that each person would take one day off each week on a rotating basis, and national holidays would be taken as usual. The seventh item was that if the company had a surplus, it would allocate a bonus of more than 500 yuan at its discretion. The eighth item was to take the form of a notice. The ninth item was approved in principle and detailed regulations would be formulated separately. The tenth and eleventh items would be handled according to the original plan. The twelfth item, the company would bear the tuition fees for workers' children to attend school. All of these were approved by both parties, and it was decided that all workers would resume work this morning. At the same time, the company announced its acceptance of the conditions. However, as of the evening, it had not yet been announced. According to the workers, if the company was not sincere, they would continue the slowdown. However, the situation would definitely not develop to that point. The company's standoff lasted for 18 days, with losses of about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. (April 9th)</p>
<h3>Wang Jun Sends Troops to Suppress Shandong Bandits</h3>
<p>▲ The bandits in Baodu Mountain have a tendency to flee west.</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Wang Jun previously received a telegram from Han Fuqu requesting the dispatch of troops to jointly suppress the bandits in Baodu Mountain. He has dispatched the Chen Chuanwen unit of the 70th Regiment of the 12th Division stationed on the Linzao branch line. Currently, the bandits in Baodu Mountain and Meng Mountain have a tendency to flee west. Chen Chuanwen telegraphed Xuzhou yesterday, saying that the bandits had fled to Yixian County and had a tendency to combine with the bandits in Huxi, attempting to disrupt transportation. Baodu Mountain and Yixian County are located east of the Jinpu Railway. Crossing the railway to the west, they are close to the eastern shore of Dushan Lake, Zhaoyang Lake, and Weishan Lake. The lakes have always been infested with water bandits, who are able to hide easily due to the dense vegetation in the lakes, causing trouble to the local area. Baodu Mountain, on the other hand, is easy to hide in due to its continuous terrain. Now that Baodu Mountain is being suppressed, protecting the railway is extremely important. After receiving the report, Wang Jun ordered Li Wenbin, the commander of the 21st Brigade, to lead the 41st Regiment to Lincheng to block the bandits and protect the railway at the same time. He also telegraphed Jiang Chuoou and Liu Zhi to request the dispatch of armored trains northeast to patrol the Lincheng-Tengzhou area to assist in the suppression. Hu Yan, the commander of the 41st Regiment, led all the soldiers of the regiment on trains north on the 10th, disembarking at Hanzhuang, Shagou, Lincheng and other places to protect the railway and intercept the bandits. Li Wenbin took the regimental train to Lincheng on the afternoon of the 11th to command. Brigade staff Du Shibo and adjutant Wang Chang followed. As for the Chen Chuanwen unit, they are still jointly suppressing bandits in the Linzao area. Wang ordered all units to thoroughly block and attack the bandits, so as to cooperate with the Shandong army to eliminate the bandit trouble in southern Shandong and prevent the remnants of bandits along the Jinpu Railway from colluding and harassing.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Reforms Grain Collection Tickets</h3>
<p>▲ Starting this year, all silver and rice collections will be abolished and replaced with foreign currency.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, because various counties collect grain collection tickets, which urgently need to abolish silver and rice and replace them with foreign currency, issued an investigation table last year, ordering all counties to follow it. Later, the Jurong County Bureau drafted a sample ticket and submitted it for approval, and it was ordered that all counties follow suit. Later, because the county bureaus were unable to complete the task in time, they requested a one-year extension. Now that it is the 20th year of the Republic of China, there is no room for further delay. The Department specifically ordered that all counties follow the previous order and reform in unison, and submit a properly drafted sample ticket for approval as soon as possible. The order is recorded below:</p>
<p>To order and urge: The various counties collecting grain collection tickets urgently need to abolish silver and rice and replace them with foreign currency. When the investigation table was issued last year, they were ordered to comply. Later, according to the Jurong County Bureau's drafted sample ticket submitted for approval, it was again ordered that all counties follow suit. Investigating and improving the sample ticket is an important policy for reorganizing land tax. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the county bureaus requested a one-year extension because they were unable to complete the task in time. Now that it is the 20th year of the Republic of China, there is no room for further delay. However, yesterday, the Nanhui Finance Bureau requested a one-year extension because the collection ticket books had already been printed. This is truly a lack of self-improvement and an excuse to shirk responsibility. In addition to ordering a reprimand, it is necessary to issue a strict order to urge that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, all county collection tickets must follow the previous order and be reformed in unison. The properly drafted sample ticket should be submitted for approval as soon as possible, and no excuses for delay should be made.]</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express</h3>
<p>▲ The Wuhu County National Assembly representative election has been completed by the Party Department. The election of agricultural, commercial, industrial, and freelance professional groups is also scheduled to begin on the 16th and end on the 22nd. The industrial, commercial, and agricultural groups will each hold elections for one day in their respective associations, and the freelance professional group will hold elections for one day in the county government. The labor union has a total of 40,000 votes in the province, and Wuhu accounts for 16,000 votes. The Chamber of Commerce has 64,000 votes in the province, and Wuhu has 9,400 votes. The Farmers' Association has more than 200,000 votes in the province, and the details for Wuhu are unknown. There is no organization for freelance professional groups such as accountants, and many have voluntarily given up, making it impossible to investigate.</p>
<p>▲ After the Anhui Provincial Government abolished the rice export tax, it reorganized the Rice and Grain Administration. Wuhu first established an inspection office and immediately strictly ordered the prohibition of all rice and grain exports. Rice merchants throughout the province and the Provincial Federation of Commerce believed that the ban on rice and grain exports was of great importance to the rice market and commerce, and sent telegrams requesting the ban be lifted. The provincial government replied that the province's grain supply was insufficient and should not be discussed. Rice merchants were even more panic-stricken. They have now appointed representatives Gu Houfu and Tao Yinhuai, and the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce has also appointed Wu Xingzhou and Cui Lianggong as representatives to go to the province on the 12th to meet with Chen Tiaoyuan and explain everything. They plan to request that they be allowed to register for export first and that export taxes be levied at a discretionary rate to maintain the rice market and commerce.</p>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government instructed the Wuhu County Government and the Public Security Bureau to set up a drug rehabilitation center. It has now been organized and established by the County Government's Second Section in conjunction with the Company Bureau's Health Section. The registration and licensing of opium lamps are being carried out in order to integrate prohibition into taxation, with a license fee of four yuan per lamp being charged, starting on April 1st. It has now been ascertained that about 1,000 opium lamps have been registered.</p>
<p>▲ The Xuan-Wuhu-Guang long-distance bus route is very developed. However, the vehicles have long been old and dilapidated. Yesterday morning, a bus full of passengers and luggage was traveling from Xuan to Wuhu. When it passed near Zhusigang, about 20 li from Wuhu, the axle suddenly broke, and the bus crashed into the field. One passenger died, three were seriously injured, and three were slightly injured. The injured passengers have now come to Wuhu for treatment.</p>
<p>▲ Central Committee member Gui Chongji previously went from Wuhu to Chaoxian and Hefei to inspect Party affairs. He has now completed his work and returned to Wuhu yesterday. He took the Anfeng special wheel to Pukou and transferred to inspect various counties in northern Anhui.</p>
<p>▲ The Lushengji cloth factory in the East Gate of Wuhu Port was robbed the night before, with heavy losses. Yesterday, the City Public Security Bureau's Detective Team arrested four bandits, Liu Deyu and Li Jiada, near the Fubridge, and seized two box cannons and more than a dozen bullets. They were immediately taken to the bureau for interrogation along with the stolen goods. (11th)</p>

The case has been investigated and interrogated by the County Court Procuratorate several times. The investigation has now concluded, and a public prosecution has been filed. Yesterday was the date for the trial court to hold a hearing. Judge Yang兼 took a seat in the first courtroom.

As a result, it was ordered that they be remanded in custody together, and sentencing will be pronounced separately at 5:00 PM on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>Clearing up the Ding Shuangsheng debt entanglement The County Party Consolidation Committee believed that the brothers Ding Xingchu and Ding Hesheng, owners of the Ding Shuangsheng shop in the city, had absorbed huge deposits in the name of a silk shop and failed in speculative business, resulting in bankruptcy and losses. A letter was sent to the county government requesting the sealing up of the property of the shop owners Ding Xingchu and Ding Hesheng brothers to compensate the creditors, and that the Ding brothers and the shop manager Feng Xusan be arrested and detained. The county government approved the letter, stating that the case is currently being handled by the Chamber of Commerce. A letter was sent to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting that the details of the handling of the case be reported to the county government for review. The Chamber of Commerce has reported the details to the county government and scheduled a meeting on the 17th to convene the creditors and the silk and cloth industry to report on the progress and discuss future plans.</p>
<p>Explaining the method of collecting business tax Yesterday, the director of the County Business Tax Collection Bureau, Yang Wu Bian, sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, forwarding the five methods of explaining business tax by the Ministry of Finance, for the reference of various industries. The methods are recorded as follows: 1. If a factory or company has already paid consolidated tax or special consumption tax, the provinces must not collect business tax from the factory or company again. However, commercial firms and shops that promote and sell goods will still be subject to business tax. 2. If a company specializes in the salt industry and has already paid salt tax to the central government, the provinces must not collect business tax from it again. However, stores that sell miscellaneous goods and also sell salt in small quantities should still be subject to business tax. 3. If a company specializes in the tobacco and alcohol industry and has already paid tobacco and alcohol license fees to the central government, the provinces must not collect business tax from it again. However, stores that sell goods and also sell tobacco and alcohol should still be subject to business tax. 4. Business licenses should be affixed with stamp tax tickets. Those with capital of more than 500 yuan should affix 5 jiao per license, and those with capital of less than 500 yuan should affix 1 jiao per license. 5. If a stock exchange has already paid stock exchange tax to the central government, the provinces must not collect business tax. In addition, matches, since they are subject to consolidated tax by the central government, should be taxed by the business tax for the match manufacturing industry within the consolidated tax area. Whole-selling and retail businesses among the merchandise selling industry should still be taxed to show the difference.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Establishment of the Health Committee The Wuyi Health Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Shangguo Headquarters on the afternoon of the 11th. More than 30 committee members attended. County Chief Zhang's representative, Chu Bingxiang, chaired the meeting and gave a report. Afterwards, Huang Gongwang, Chen Shunming, Wang Wanbai, and others gave speeches in succession. Then, staff members were elected. As a result, Feng Xiaoqing, Qian Linshu, Zhou Renyong, Gan Shengzhe, and Zhang Pengzhu were elected as standing committee members, and Wang Wanbai and Tu Gongfu were elected as alternate standing committee members.

<p>River workers beat a man to death A number of river workers dredging the Meng River in Wuyi were drinking in a restaurant opened by Wu Aliuliu in Luoshuwan North Street on the evening of the 10th. A dispute arose over money, resulting in Wu Aliuliu being beaten and injured by the river workers. He died soon after. The River Works Bureau sent security guards to arrest the murderers Chen Yuxi, Zhang Deming, Gao Wen and others, who were taken to the city for interrogation on the 11th.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Another robbery outside the North Water Gate Xu Yongkang, who runs a tofu shop in Xiejiaqiao and Xinqiao Town, seven or eight li outside the North Water Gate of the attached city, is about forty years old. He has a wife and a concubine, and his family is quite wealthy. At 2:00 AM on the 11th, Xu lived in the concubine's residence. Only his wife, Tu, and a number of partners were left at home. Suddenly, more than a dozen bandits armed with wooden sticks and other weapons broke into the inner room. Tu was awakened from her dream and dragged out of bed by the bandits, who forced her to ask where the silver was hidden. Tu did not answer, so the bandits beat her with sticks. Tu could not bear the pain and handed over all the hidden silver. The bandits were still not satisfied and went to the opposite room of Xu's sister (the sister is a widow with a young daughter, so she often lives in her mother's home) to rob. In total, they robbed 270 silver dollars, 350 paper notes, 120,000 copper coins, two gold rings, one pair of gold bracelets, one pair of silver bracelets, and scattered clothes, worth more than 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Coastal fishing protection and bandit suppression underway The Jiangsu Coastal Fishing Protection Temporary Office was established in Tong by the Provincial Government's Pacification Superintendent's Office, the Naval Department of the Navy, and the Maritime Patrol Office, along with the military and police. Troops and police, as well as the provincial security regiment's machine gun team and the Tongji and other ships, have been mobilized to encircle and suppress the bandits in Lusi, clean up the sea, and ensure the safety of the fishing industry.</p>
<p>The Education Bureau takes over all county Confucian temples In addition to the Confucian temples in the urban area, which have already been taken over by the Education Bureau, the rest are still managed by the district offices or the former gentry. On the 11th, the Education Bureau received an order from the provincial office to take over all of them. The use of Zhang Fa's traitorous property is determined. The property of the local bully Zhang Fa is estimated at 220,381 yuan and 22 fen. Various groups and agencies have requested the allocation of funds for dike maintenance and other purposes. The Department of Civil Affairs believes that Zhang's property is designated for educational and charitable causes, and the requested allocation is not in line with Article 9 of the revised regulations on the disposal of traitorous property, so it is difficult to approve. The results of the National Assembly election for industrial groups The Nantong County Government telegraphed the Department of Civil Affairs on the 11th, stating that the county's industrial group election tickets were opened on the 10th. The largest number of votes were cast for Chen Changgeng 11,278, Zhang Hentian 11,151, Cheng Chunyi 9,452, the Ji's 9,430, Shao Liqi 8,978, Wang Jianqiu 7,854, and Cao Pinru 5,011.</p>
<p>Gaoyou</p>
<p>An old woman helping to put out a fire fell to her death This afternoon at about 4:00 PM, a fire broke out at the home of Shi Juying, a resident of Xihe Lane in this city, due to carelessness. At that time, there was a strong wind, and the fire was particularly fierce. Fortunately, the troops of the Second Battalion stationed in You were on the scene to assist the fire brigade in extinguishing the fire. Only five houses were destroyed. At that time, an old woman surnamed Liu fell on a candlestick while helping to put out the fire, piercing her neck and killing her on the spot. This is also a tragedy.</p>
<p>A kidnapped person from Dongxiang escaped danger in Yancheng The two younger sons of the farmer Jin Zengfu, from the Seventh Village of the Seventh General in Dongxiang, were kidnapped by bandits last year and have not been heard from since. Now, according to a friend's report, the kidnappers have been caught in Yancheng, and the two sons are currently staying in the Yancheng police team. After receiving the news, Jin has submitted a request to the county government to send police to collect them.</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>River dredging workers beat a farmer to death The Pinghu to Zhapu Tang River is now being dredged to the south end of Hongni. The workers are extremely barbarous. Yesterday (the 11th) afternoon, a number of workers were collecting flowers and grass in the field of a Zhu family in Sanliqiao. Zhu Guilin, a young owner of the Zhu family, saw this and came out to dissuade them. The workers not only did not listen, but instead beat Guilin, hitting him with dry, hard clods of mud. He was beaten to death on the spot. The deceased was only 18 years old and was the only son. The corpse is now under the jurisdiction of the family, who have reported the case to the authorities for examination and asked for justice.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>A major fire in the Reed Mat District At about 7:00 PM on the 11th, a fire broke out for unknown reasons at the Zhang Gongli paper warehouse in the Reed Mat District of Jiaxing North City. The fire was so bright that it was impossible to approach. The volunteer fire brigades from various neighborhoods rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It destroyed the Zhang Gongli paper warehouse buildings and the fronts of the Sheng Taiyuan coal warehouse buildings, a total of eight buildings, as well as more than 20 large and small buildings in the front and back dikes, along with the goods piled up in the two warehouses, for a total loss of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Seventh Security Regiment is transferred to the province for training The Seventh Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force was previously deployed to Jiaxing. All units of the regiment were stationed in He last year. Now that the bandit atmosphere in Jiahu has subsided, Director Zhu believed that the Seventh Regiment had not been established for long and that the soldiers were newly recruited and had not received adequate training. Therefore, he ordered the regiment to be transferred to the province for centralized training. The regiment has been arriving in succession. The defense of Jiaxing will be filled by units sent by the Second Regiment.</p>

<h3>Next Year's World Games: China Decides to Send a Football Team</h3>
<p>▲Association Holds Important Representative Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Decision to Select Team Members in June This Year</p>
<p>丨Next Zonal Competition in Hankou丨</p>
<p>丨Zonal Competition Rules to be Announced丨</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the gathering of leaders from various regions in Shanghai for the zonal football competition, the National Sports Advancement Association specially convened an important meeting yesterday to discuss sending a football team to participate in the World Games to be held in the United States next year. The meeting was held at the Association's headquarters at noon. Honorary Chairman of the Association, Shen Siliang, presided over the meeting. Representatives attending included John Ma from North China, Song Ruhai from Central China, Le Xiurong from East China, Liu Guangmei from the Shanghai Shuying Football Team, and Guo Lijun. Gao Xiwei, the representative from South China, had been telegraphed to come to Shanghai for the meeting, but he telegraphed back saying he couldn't get away due to other matters, but agreed with the resolutions. After careful consideration and thorough discussion by the representatives, it was decided to send a football team to participate in the World Games next year. Details are recorded later. There were also other resolutions related to the zonal football competition, which are also recorded below.</p>
<h3>Football Team Decides to Go to the US</h3>
<p>丨Team Members to be Selected in June丨</p>
<p>丨Selection Committee to be Organized丨</p>
<p>Although Chinese sports may lag behind others in technique, its spirit is not diminished in the slightest. The World Games next year will be held in Los Angeles, USA, at the end of July. To promote the spirit of Chinese sports, the representatives unanimously agreed to send a football team to the United States to participate in the competition and decided on the following methods: Before June of this year, sports organizations in each region will recommend the most outstanding football players in their region to the National Association. Then, they will gather in Shanghai, and the Association will organize a selection committee to hold trial matches. The selection committee will select players based on their performance in the trial matches to form the Chinese football team. The Association will then send someone to lead the team to compete in Singapore and other places in Southeast Asia for practice and experience, and also to raise funds for the trip to the United States. The reason for holding the trial matches in June and competing in Southeast Asia is that most of the players are students and academic work is valued to avoid neglecting their studies. Therefore, the summer vacation is the most suitable time. As for the climate in Southeast Asia, it is not much different from usual in June.</p>
<h3>Next Zonal Competition</h3>
<p>丨To Promote Sports in Central China丨</p>
<p>丨Decision to Hold it in Hankou丨</p>
<p>The next item discussed was the date and location of the next zonal competition. Song Ruhai, the representative from Central China, stood up and said that the atmosphere for sports in East China and South China is already very strong, and it is also the case in North China. However, the area of Central China is dull and lifeless. In order to promote sports in Central China and stimulate interest in sports there, please decide to hold the next zonal football competition in Hankou. This was unanimously agreed upon. However, if the facilities are inadequate or there are other reasons, in the event of absolute necessity, it will be changed to North China. The date will still be during the spring break to avoid neglecting business or studies.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Zonal Competition Rules</h3>
<p>丨Distributed to Provinces After Review丨</p>
<p>丨Please Participate Unanimously in the Next Competition丨</p>
<p>The rules of the National Zonal Football Competition have never been written down, but each region has only understood them implicitly. Now, for the sake of formality, Liu Guangmei, the representative of the Shuying Football Team, requested that the rules be established, reviewed, and announced, and distributed to the provinces and regions so that they can be followed and prepared in advance. When distributing them, please also ask all provinces and regions to participate unanimously in the next competition. Guo Lijun, a pioneer enthusiastic about sports and currently doing business in Sichuan Province, was also present at the meeting. The representatives also resolved to ask him to vigorously promote sports in Western China after he returns to Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Zonal Football Competition Closes Yesterday</h3>
<h3>East China Wins This Year's Championship</h3>
<p>▲Defeats North China Five to Zero</p>
<p>丨North China Team Heads North This Morning...Central China Team Returns West by Boat丨</p>
<p>▲Sports Advancement Association Hosted Banquet for Players Last Night</p>
<p>The sixth National Zonal Football Championship, which has been the focus of the nation's attention, has been taking place in Shanghai since the 8th of this month. East China and North China both defeated Central China. Yesterday, the East China and North China teams met at the China Baseball Field in what was nominally the third act of the zonal competition, but in reality, it was nothing less than the championship final. As a result, East China defeated North China five to zero, winning this year's championship. Director of the Association, Zhao Jinqing, presented the award, which was received by Dai Linjing, the captain of the East China team. Three cheers of "Long live!" were shouted, and the fierce battle slowly closed under the red shadow of the setting sun. The referees were Le Xiurong, Liang Guocai, and Zhao Yansheng.</p>
<h3>A Myriad Throng</h3>
<p>East China has an abundance of talent this year and can be said to stand shoulder to shoulder with South China. With South China absent, East China can be considered to hold the reins of this year's competition. The North China team they met yesterday was also a group of strong athletes from the north. The news of the battle spread, and spectators gathered in droves. Moreover, before the great battle, there was a match between amateur Hua Ling players. Therefore, the so-called football fans brought their friends and sat high up to wait, looking around. The baseball field was actually a sea of people, estimated to be over ten thousand. The battle between East China and North China was fiercely competitive and full of interest. The sounds of shouting and approval rose from all around, truly a grand event of the time.</p>
<h3>The Prowess of the Athletes</h3>
<p>▲East China Team</p>
<p>Chen Pu Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Li Ning Chen Hongguang (Lower)</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Feng Yunyou Luo Haiguang</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing Dai Linjing</p>
<p>Shu Tang (Upper) Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an (Lower) Chen Yutian</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan had few opportunities to get the ball, and there were only one or two dangerous balls, so he didn't have much chance to show his skills. Right-back Jiang Shanjing occasionally stumbled once or twice, almost causing a disaster, which was a blemish. Left-back Quan Ning was as stable as Mount Tai, which is commendable. Center-back Feng Yunyou ran around in all directions and did not strictly adhere to his position. The two midfielders were quite commendable. Chen Pu's performance was very outstanding, providing supplies to the front and never missing a pass, and he was also very effective in defending and monitoring. Center forward Dai Linjing put in a special effort yesterday, and his shots were very accurate and powerful, mainly because North China did not monitor him. Chen Zhenhe did not lose his true colors, and Chen Jiaqiu was also exceptionally brave. Chen Yutian did not show any special skills, and Luo Haiguang fought too fiercely and was seriously injured. East China's performance was better in the first half than in the second half, perhaps because their energy gradually faded.</p>
<p>▲North China Team</p>
<p>Zhang Dejiang</p>
<p>Wang Changying Ren Dui Huang Zhimin</p>
<p>Huang Zhenxun Zhang Guowei Zhao Qichun</p>
<p>Xian Zhongfen Shen Chonghai Huang Zhensheng (Lower)</p>
<p>Tan Baoxian (Upper)</p>
<p>Huang Yujia</p>
<p>Although North China's situation was far inferior to that of East China, heroes should not be judged by success or failure. Goalkeeper Huang Zhenxun's skills have reached a very high level, but he occasionally made mistakes due to momentary carelessness. The two fullbacks were also better than when they played against Central China, with very few stumbles. Wang Changying occasionally kicked out dangerous balls. Center-back Zhang Guowei was very competent. The two midfielders also made progress. The forwards also had opportunities to attack, but their actions were still a bit slow. Otherwise, East China's goal would have been broken. North China's initial performance yesterday was praised by the front stands, and everyone said they had been impressed. As for the attack, there were also opportunities from time to time, unlike being one-sided. Overall, the performance cannot be said to be unsatisfactory. All the players in the East China team were veterans of the battlefield, so losing to them is still an honor.</p>
<h3>The Course of the Bloody Battle</h3>
<p>▲Center Forward Dai's Header Astonishes the Audience</p>
<p>North China passed the ball to advance, but it was intercepted by center forward Dai, who passed it to the feet of left winger Chen Zhenhe, but the shot was high and ineffective. Left winger Chen attacked a second time, and the goalkeeper saved it into a corner kick. Chen Yutian kicked it over, and Wang Jia, the center forward, met it with his head, almost finding the goal. The audience was shaken by this.</p>
<p>▲Zhou Xianyan Shows His Skills Under the Iron Hooves</p>
<p>The entire North China team performed very well. The five tiger generals communicated well, and their passing and running were very fast. In the blink of an eye, the East China area was full of action. The North China athletes entered the area, but they were poor at shooting and were also monitored by the opponent. They were successful and unsuccessful ten times, suddenly gathering and suddenly dispersing. Left winger Zhang Dejiang secretly crossed the Chencang, and the four routes echoed each other. Zhou Xianyan fearlessly entered the fray, snatching the ball out of danger under the iron hooves. The sound of cheers resounded throughout the field.</p>
<p>▲Huang Zhenxun Carelessly Loses Jingzhou</p>
<p>The East China forwards waited for an opportunity and, after receiving the ball, attacked in separate directions, cleverly setting up surprise soldiers to confuse the audience. Chen Zhenhe switched from the left to the center, and Dai Linjing changed from the center to the left. North China's right inside forward, Mu Zhongfen, charged and knocked Dai to the ground, resulting in a free kick. The spot was about twenty yards from Lin's goal. Chen Zhenhe gently passed it to the center, not aiming at the goal, but the goalkeeper actually pushed it back with one arm and into the net. This was fifteen minutes after the start of the game. The loss of this ball was either because the goalkeeper opened the door to let the thief in, or because the goalkeeper defected to the enemy, but in fact, the blame lies in carelessness.</p>
<p>▲Center Forward Dai's Iron Feet Create a Miracle</p>
<p>Within two minutes, center forward Dai fired a fierce shot from outside the penalty area. At that time, the area within ten steps of North China's goal was full of people, both sides mixed together. The ball went quickly and hit the target. The goalkeeper was terrified, as if it had fallen from the sky.</p>
<p>▲Huang Zhimin's Trickery Backfires</p>
<p>Although North China had lost two goals, their spirit was still strong. As a result of their efforts to press forward, they got two corner kicks in a row. The left and right wingers did not fail in their mission, the balls were high and good, but because of the strong defense, it was difficult to get close to the goal. Finally, Zhou Xianyan handed it over to the front, and the four sides were safe. Chen Zhenhe counterattacked twice, one high and one oblique, and the momentum of the ball changed again. North China's right winger invaded and then passed it to the center. Huang Zhimin's body was like a flying swallow, taking the lead with the goal in sight. Knowing Zhou's ability, it was not easy to deal with, so he used the tactic of attacking in the east and striking in the west. The person leaned to the right, and the ball went to the left, expecting to go out of the goal diagonally, but the trick backfired. It seemed that there was destiny in North China's fate.</p>

<p>▲Four to Zero in the First Half</p>
<p>After surviving a great disaster, there must be good fortune. At this time, East China's spirit was boosted, and the whole army rose up. Chen Yutian kicked a corner kick, which was blocked by the inside forward. Chen passed it forward again, and black-faced general Chen Zhenhe was eager to try it. The opportunity came, and he went forward and kicked the ball into the net. East China scored the third goal. After that, Chen Zhenhe kicked a corner kick, and center forward Dai met it with his head. The goalkeeper jumped up and caught it, which was not easy. After another five minutes, center forward Dai had a flash of inspiration, and Feng Yun was highly illuminated. The ball he shot went to cut the post and enter the net, creating a score of four to zero in the first half.</p>
<p>▲John Ma Formulates a Clever Plan in the Tent</p>
<p>The loss of four goals by North China was partly due to the forwards being too far forward and unable to return to defend. Starting in the second half, team leader John Ma immediately changed his strategy, emphasizing defense rather than attack. Sure enough, East China's advances became difficult. Not long after the start of the game, Luo Haiguang fell to the ground and suffered a concussion, leaving the field for treatment. Chen Hongguang replaced him. At this time, East China was either on the left or the right, and they entered whenever there was a chance, but there were defenders everywhere, making it impossible to get close to the goal, because many of North China's forwards were also inside helping to defend.</p>
<p>▲Chen Zhenhe Deserves to be Called a Fierce General</p>
<p>After twelve minutes, East China's Zhou Xianyan received an attacking ball for the first time. Although there was some danger afterwards, it was easy to deal with. After eighteen minutes, Chen Hongguang invaded with the ball and collided with North China's inside forward and fell to the ground. The ball landed beside him, and fierce general Chen Zhenhe continued to advance and shot at the goal. The ball came out like an arrow, quickly and powerfully, and was actually bounced into the goal from the goalkeeper's hand, making the score five to zero. Afterwards, East China continued to advance, but the opponent's goalkeeper had excellent skills and saved the dangerous balls continuously, preventing further losses. As a result of the game, East China won five to zero.</p>

Next year's competition will be held in Hankou, and there will be a better performance.</p>
<h3>Parting Ways</h3>
<p>After participating in the National Zonal Competition, the Central China football team originally planned to have a friendly match with the Furen team. The Hankou Municipal Government Employees Football Team also planned to go to the capital to have friendly matches with the Central Party Headquarters, Central University, and Nanjing Municipal Government football teams to learn from each other and connect emotionally. The team received a reply from Nanjing yesterday, saying that the Central Party Headquarters has no football team organization. Although the Nanjing Municipal Government has a football team, it is still in its early stages and is unwilling to participate. Central University declined the invitation because of the upcoming spring sports meeting. A telegram also came from Hankou urging them to return quickly. Therefore, the entire team took the China Merchants Jiangyu ship west this morning. It is also heard that after the team returns to Hankou, they will be determined to practice hard for future development, which is limitless. The team was warmly welcomed by all sectors during their visit to Shanghai. Guo Lijun presented them with a large silver cup, L. P. Lu, of the Political Science and Law University, presented them with a silver shield, and the Fumin Knitting Factory presented the Central China team with a dozen jerseys, the Hankou Municipal Government team with a dozen jerseys, and the Wuhan Sanyu Sports Association with fifteen jerseys. The North China team, led by John Ma, also took the train back to Beiping at 9 a.m. this morning. The Shanghai Qinfen Bookstore presented the Central China team leader Song Ruhai and the North China team leader Ma with the bureau's newly published [Football Training Method], [Basketball Training Method], and [Questions and Answers on Football Rules].</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Fourth Anniversary of the Party Purge</h3>
<p>▲ More than two hundred representatives from all walks of life</p>
<p>▲ Commemorative meeting held at the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) was the fourth anniversary of the Chinese Nationalist Party's purge of the party. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters specially convened people from all walks of life in the city to hold a commemorative meeting. More than two hundred representatives from all walks of life attended. Yang Qingyuan, the head of the Municipal Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. He reported on the significance and process of the party's purge and gave detailed instructions on the direction that party members should strive towards in the future. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Attending Representatives: Zhang Shuye, Li Jianhong, Qian Shouzhi, (Social Affairs Bureau) Yan Sen, Feng Xiaoting, (Health Bureau) Yang Peiwen, Wang Keyong, (Education Bureau) Song Yuntao, Wang Guozhen, (Public Security Bureau) Jin Xihan, Zhou Hanmei, (Shanghai Second Branch of the Cultural Academy) Shen Yu, Zhang Zaibo, Shen Banmei, (Fifth District Party Headquarters) Xu Huimin, (Third District Party Headquarters) Sun Choucheng, (National Goods Factory United Association) Dong Changqiu, (Seventh Branch of the First District) Zhang Hanyun, (Sixth Branch of the Third District) Su Shude, (Eighth Branch of the Fifth District) Zhang Guowei, (Twentieth Branch of the Second District) Pan Jixian, (Twentieth Branch of the Third District) Huang Futang, (Fourteenth Branch of the Second District), and representatives from Jingye Middle School, Junyi Middle School, and various labor unions, totaling more than two hundred people.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Report: Fellow representatives, fellow comrades, today we gather representatives from all walks of life to hold this commemorative meeting for the fourth anniversary of the Chinese Nationalist Party's purge of the party. We feel that this is of great significance. We must understand that the purge is not only related to the survival of our party, but also to the survival of the entire country and nation. Our party is the only revolutionary party in China. Its mission is to seek the independence of China and the survival of the nation. If the party, which is responsible for nurturing and protecting China, is stolen by the reactionaries, then the independence of the country and the survival of the nation will naturally be hopeless. Therefore, the purge is not only the most precious and important page in the history of the party, but also should be prominently recorded in the history of the Republic of China. Now, I will give a brief report on the process of the purge. In 1922, a portion of the intellectual class in northern China and a small number of students studying in Japan had no deep research in political theories. Because of the frequent domestic turmoil and the influence of the Soviet Russian revolution, they began to study communism. A small number of young people without in-depth research in social sciences were naturally easily deceived by it. Based on the mentality of wanting to show off, being curious, and being keen on introducing new ideas, which was popular throughout the country, they even advocated communism. Coincidentally, after the success of the October Revolution in Soviet Russia, the great powers constantly exerted severe pressure on them. They felt that the foundation of the country was shaking, so they dealt with it in two ways: first, to instigate revolutionary movements among the weak and small people of the world to resist imperialism; second, to create class struggles in the United States and other countries to allow them to collapse due to civil war. They believed that these two methods could consolidate the position of the Soviet Russian state. At first, they developed towards the West, but they were met with opposition from the Turkish Nationalist Party and suffered a disastrous defeat. Therefore, they changed direction and attacked the East. Unfortunately, a portion of Chinese youth were used by them. At first, Soviet Russia wanted to stand alone and lead the Chinese revolution, but it was ineffective. So, they sent Joffe to contact Mr. Sun Yat-sen, saying that the Chinese revolution could only be realized by implementing the Three Principles of the People. We, Soviet Russia, will provide full assistance. In 1923, Soviet Russia sent Borodin to China to tell Mr. Sun Yat-sen that helping the Chinese revolution was the responsibility of the Third International. China is absolutely not suitable for a communist revolution, so Chinese Communist Party members should abandon their主張 and work together with the Nationalist Party. In 1925, Chinese Communist Party members joined our party as individuals. At first, President Sun, in view of the Chinese Communist Party members' straying, naturally wanted to give them a path to self-renewal. Therefore, he put forward the following three conditions: first, they can only join as individuals; second, they are not allowed to use the Kuomintang banner to promote communism; third, before leaving our party, they must absolutely abide by our party's doctrine, adhere to our party's policies, and implement our party's resolutions. How could they know that after they joined, the organization of the Communist Party was never dissolved, but instead actively engaged in activities? When President Sun was alive, they did not dare to be肆無忌憚, but after President Sun went north and passed away, they况橫行不法,肆意　竊, seized important positions, controlled the party's power, provoked discord, and dispersed our party. Loyal comrades were forced to flee, some were陷害 and killed, and some were humiliated. When our party raised an army for the Northern Expedition, the Communist Party became even more panicked, fearing that our party's power would expand and be difficult to manipulate, so they tried their best to oppose it. In their organ newspaper Xiangdao, they published a special issue [On the Northern Expedition], launching a major attack and opposing the Northern Expedition. When the revolutionary army recovered Hubei and Jiangxi, their attitude became more obvious, and their actions became more积极, and they seized control. The Wuhan central government ordered the Wuhan兵工廠 three times not to supply firearms to the front lines. Commander-in-Chief Chiang led hundreds of thousands of revolutionary soldiers in hand-to-hand combat with the counter-revolutionaries, while the Communist Party徒 set traps everywhere,陰圖大逞. Fortunately, the advanced figures in the party, Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, Cai Yuanpei, and other gentlemen, saw that the party and the country were surrounded by crises and were in imminent danger. Therefore, they actively arranged things. After the revolutionary army recovered Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they resolutely and decisively carried out the purge of the party, giving a severe sanction to the Chinese Communist Party, which was a thousand times crafty and evil and conspired to sell out the country. Therefore, there is today's April 12th anniversary. The purge movement has now been going on for exactly four years. Our party has been completely cleansed internally, but the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan have all been ravaged by Red bandits, and the sacrifice of life and property is unknown, in the millions and millions. The 창鉅 pain is deep, and tears flow when we speak of it. Therefore, we should have the following two points of effort when commemorating the purge: first, unify the will of party members under the Three Principles of the People. The Three Principles of the People were invented in response to the world trend and the domestic situation. The reason why the Communist Party was able to分散 our party comrades was because the comrades' belief in and understanding of the doctrine were not firm and deep enough. Therefore, the Communist Party　雜ed some seemingly right and wrong theories, and our party comrades would also be deceived by it. The purge is not only to clear out Communist Party members, but also to clear out Communist Party theories, not only to eradicate all Communist Party members, but also to absolutely unify the will of our party's loyal comrades under the Three Principles of the People. Otherwise, Communist Party members and Communist Party theories will be cleared out, but if we do not cheer up and cannot establish a foundation of mutual trust and common belief, the historical mission of our party will not be 免起, the martyrs who died will 白犧牲, and the hope for the independence, freedom, and survival of the Chinese nation will be hopeless from then on. Second, strive for practical construction. China has been invaded by imperialism for more than eighty years and devastated by feudal forces for more than four thousand years. Recently, production has fallen behind, industry has declined, people's livelihoods have withered, and the rural economy has gradually declined and collapsed. The whole country is in such an unbearable situation. This is the time for our party comrades to do practical construction work. If the general comrades still do not understand the importance of their own responsibilities, and instead think that the revolution has been completed and the comrades are enjoying happiness, this will really create signs of the destruction of the party and signs of the灭國. We must know that now it seems that the reactionaries have been defeated, and it seems that the country has reached a stable and peaceful position. We must know that not devoting ourselves to practical work is just adding to the objective conditions of the revolution and exacerbating the objective situation of the revolution. The so-called practical work is to strive for local autonomy, help the government, investigate the population, measure the land, rectify the police, promote our party's doctrine, train the people to exercise the four powers, and devote ourselves to the work of the seven movements such as literacy, afforestation, baojia, and sanitation. Among comrades, we must especially be 친애 精誠, strive for the work of the party, so that we can be worthy of the 총리 who exhausted himself to death and the martyrs who died for the country. Finally, regarding the National Assembly, I also hope that everyone will pay attention to it. The National Assembly is of great importance to the future construction of our country. Moreover, the provisional constitution during the period of political tutelage will also be decided in the National Assembly. This time, the central government gathers the elite of the whole country in one hall, and the hope for the National Assembly is very deep. However, the reactionaries have slandered the National Assembly as 御用, and have also published many bizarre and离奇 views. I hope that the representatives present will work hard to publicize this to the people from all walks of life, and do not be fooled by the reactionaries. The report is over.</p>

<h3>County Notification of Increased Salt Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Increased from April 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday, stating that it had received a consultation from the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy's Office, stating that it had received an order from the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, stating that the salt 款 in various regions were used to amortize various foreign debts. The amount allocated to each region in the second determination in October 1929 was calculated based on an exchange rate of 12 yuan per British pound. By the spring of 1930, the price of silver had fallen daily, and one British pound was equivalent to 15 yuan. As a result, the allocated 款 remitted by various regions were insufficient. It was increased by 30% across the board from April 1930 according to the original amount. However, the current price of silver has fallen even further, and each pound must be equivalent to 24 yuan. According to the previously determined amount, it is about 10 million yuan short. In order to maintain national credit, the Ministry has decided to uniformly increase the surtax of the salt field tax in each salt-producing area by 30 cents, which will be implemented from April 1st of this year. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions, and the matter has been submitted to the 16th State Council meeting of the院, and it was resolved to handle it accordingly. The Secretariat of the Central Political Conference has been requested to forward it for record. Therefore, the Salt Affairs Audit General Office is instructed to forward it to its subordinate branches and tax bureaus to store the various surtaxes collected separately from April 1st and remit them to Shanghai monthly for the sole purpose of subsidizing the repayment of foreign debts. In addition to ordering various salt affairs agencies, the transport deputy is ordered to inform him immediately. This order, etc., has been received, and it should be followed and handled accordingly. All counties in Suwu and Langxi County should increase the price of salt per catty by 3 cents, and the same for soy sauce and other foods. Baoshan Jiyitu, Shangnanchuan减地, Shanghai Concession, and Chongqi Special Zone should all be reduced by half, and each catty should be increased by 1.5 cents, all starting from April 1st of this year. In addition to reporting to the council, and ordering the Suwu Salt Merchants Association to forward the telegram to the salt depots in various places, and issuing a notice separately, the county magistrate is informed, please check, and hope that everyone will be informed.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Silk Industry Bonds</h3>
<p>▲ Expected to Be Announced Within the Month</p>
<p>The Suzhou-Zhejiang-Shanghai silk factory industry bonds, previously because the Legislative Yuan only allowed 6 million yuan, which was not enough for relief, the industry representatives Wang Xiaolai, Shen Huachen, and Chu Huiseng went to Nanjing to petition for an additional 2 million yuan in bond quota. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the three representatives, Wang, Shen, and Chu, received definite news from Nanjing yesterday that the silk industry bond case has been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry on the 8th of this month. However, whether this case will be forwarded to the National Government for promulgation after amendment, or submitted to the State Council for deliberation and discussion, will depend on the decision of the Executive Yuan. However, the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Shanghai Silk Industry Relief Special Committee has been repeatedly inquired by colleagues in various regions, hoping that the bonds will be announced and issued as soon as possible, so that they can take the funds to purchase new cocoons. Therefore, the committee has issued a notice yesterday to inform all members for reference, so as to avoid anxiety. It is estimated that the example of requesting an additional 2 million yuan in relief bonds this time is expected to be announced within this month.</p>
<h3>Important News from the Second Agricultural Model Promotion Area in Jiangsu Province</h3>

<h3>Notice from the Stamp Tax Bureau on Scheduled Inspections</h3>
<p>Song Jiju, Director of the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau, issued a notice yesterday, stating that in order to handle stamp tax affairs, since receiving instructions from the provincial bureau, the ratio has been repeatedly increased and the assessment has been strictly set. The promotion method has to be strongly implemented, and the sales volume of the audit collection books has gradually increased compared to before, but Shangbao is a busy commercial area with a vast area, and the audit collection may not be complete. Merchants and people have not been able to consistently comply with the regulations for tickets and receipts that should be affixed with stamps. Although there may be unintentional negligence, there are still cases of巧取 and deliberately evading taxes everywhere. Now that it is time for the semi-annual inspection this year, the inspection will begin on April 15th. The city and rural areas in the jurisdiction will be divided into groups, and police officers will be dispatched to carry out the inspection in order. In addition to reporting and sending separate letters, this notice is issued for the information of merchants and people. All books, tickets, and other vouchers, if there are omissions or shortages of贴 and贴 that are not legal, will be dealt with according to law without any leniency. Please comply with the regulations and do not violate them.</p>

<h3>Newly Invented Deceration Method for Tuberculosis Bacteria</h3>
<p>(1) (Translated from a recent German Tuberculosis Magazine)</p>
<p>Since Dr. Koch identified the tubercle bacillus as the causative agent of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption), scholars of tuberculosis in the East and West have been competing to find a brilliant method to kill this bacterium. However, all their efforts have been in vain. The reason is that ordinary physicians in the past did not understand the unique structural characteristics of tubercle bacilli. They believed that all bacteria could be eradicated with disinfectants, either through internal consumption or injection, just like injecting [606] for syphilis. Only after Dr. Bergoll's painstaking research did he reveal that tubercle bacilli have a special defense mechanism, capable of resisting the attacks of all external drug forces. The tubercle bacillus is composed of an inner membrane of neutral fat and an outer membrane of acid-fast wax (Lipoid). Unless a way is found to destroy its waxy defenses and dismantle its fatty armor, there is no way to capture and kill the tubercle bacillus. Moreover, when tubercle bacilli enter a local area of the human body, they erode the surrounding tissues, forming stubborn nodules that obstruct blood flow. This prevents generally injected or ingested disinfectants from crossing the boundary. It is as if the affected area is a specially guarded restricted zone. Since the drug's force cannot reach the affected area, even if the entire body is submerged in a pool of medicine, it cannot harm a hair on the tubercle bacillus. Therefore, the only strategic approach to eradicating tubercle bacilli must meet at least the following two prerequisites:</p>
<p>(1) Any drug force capable of destroying the nodules and directly reaching the affected area.</p>
<p>(2) Also capable of stripping or dissolving the waxy and fatty inner and outer membranes.</p>
<p>Only in this way can it achieve the merit of breaking through barriers and defeating the enemy. Otherwise, it is like scratching an itch through boots. The tubercle bacillus, under these two protections, secretly laughs at people for being unable to harm it.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Hammersely and Terebensky discovered that the acid resistance of tubercle bacilli is due to the wax's acid resistance. Therefore, they applied a 5% to 10% solution of caustic potash to remove the acid-fast wax from the tubercle bacillus. Later, Moussn and Goupil applied chlorine gas and also managed to remove the acid-fast wax. However, this type of dewaxing method is only applicable to staining methods in microscopy because the drug is highly toxic and ultimately cannot be used on the human body.</p>
<p>In recent years, the application of chaulmoogra oil to leprosy has occasionally yielded unexpected results. This is because leprosy bacilli and tubercle bacilli are acid-fast bacteria of the same nature, and chaulmoogra oil has a dewaxing effect and has a bactericidal power more than a hundred times that of carbolic acid. As a result, scholars have been keenly interested and have considered applying chaulmoogra oil to tuberculosis patients in the hope of achieving results. They used various chemical methods to extract the main components of chaulmoogra oil. However, it only has good effects on skin and superficial tuberculosis, while it still cannot have any effect on deep organs such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Therefore, Dr. Bergoll, the great benefactor of all tuberculosis patients in the world, went a step further and collected various drugs of animal, plant, and mineral origin, and painstakingly studied them, hoping to find a drug with a dewaxing effect but without the various shortcomings of chaulmoogra oil. He worked tirelessly for decades, exhausting his mind and shedding much blood to seek the most rational and purest chemical composition. Finally, he discovered that the compressed juice of the mesentery glands of certain special animals contains a certain effective ingredient that has a strong dewaxing effect on tubercle bacilli. He immediately applied this new ingredient to tubercle bacilli, and the Ziehl-Neelsen stain no longer stained red but stained blue. This result is completely identical to other non-acid-fast bacteria. Since then, the claim regarded by Eastern and Western scholars that artificial methods cannot remove the acid resistance of tubercle bacilli has been completely overturned, and he has taken the highest authority in dewaxing bactericides. He then experimented with this compound on various tuberculosis cases in animals and humans and obtained great miraculous effects without any side effects. This is truly a new dawn in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a major question in the medical field for thousands of years.</p>
<p>[I&gt; The Lungs of Pulmonary Patients &lt;I]</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Since the etiology and pathology of pulmonary tuberculosis have been clarified, Dr. Bergoll, the great medical sage, has also successfully developed a new and ideal medical theory for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis through experiments. [Sanosin], the only and unparalleled special medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis in the 20th century, was produced in accordance with this new medical theory and new doctrine, opening a new record unprecedented in the medical field. The main components contained in [Sanosin] are listed below.</p>
<p>The chemical name of the first component, Aminoethylsulfonic acid (C2H7NSO3), is extracted from the mesentery glands, liver, and blood of marine mollusks of special animals. Its chemical properties are colorless and transparent, forming shiny four- or six-sided crystals. It can be dissolved in sixteen times its weight of cold water at 12 degrees Celsius, and it is easier to dissolve in hot water, but it cannot be dissolved in anhydrous alcohol and ether. If boiled in a strong saline solution, it becomes acetic acid and sulfuric acid. When fused with mercury, it forms a white powder insoluble in water. If decomposed at 240 degrees Celsius and mixed more closely with several times its weight of sodium carbonate, and heated on a platinum plate, it produces a residue. According to the experimental report of Dr. Schroder, this component can directly act on tubercle bacilli, dissolving the wax and fat of their outer membrane. Once tubercle bacilli lose this important barrier, they cannot avoid the death penalty. Moreover, this component also has a considerable irritating effect, which can increase the secretion of bile in patients, and the function of metabolism is even more vigorous. For pulmonary diseases, it can also change its connective tissue and produce a therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>The second component is Kallium Sulfoouaiacollcum (C6H0OH) created by Dr. Tiemann.</p>
<p>(OCH)2SO2OK Its function is to increase the resistance of tuberculosis patients and the clotting power of serum, promote metabolism, increase white blood cells, prevent the development of tubercle bacilli, and has a special effect of strengthening the stomach, eliminating phlegm, and disinfecting. Therefore, since Dr. Relohenbach, a famous modern tuberculosis physician, advocated its application to pulmonary tuberculosis, doctors in Germany and England have regarded this component as the supreme sacred object for the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>[Sanosin] new medicine is made by synthesizing the above two valuable main components. Therefore, [Sanosin] is an unprecedented special new medicine for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, which truly has great value. Its therapeutic effect is described below.</p>
<p>(1) When experimenting with the medicinal power of [Sanosin] in a test tube, the acid resistance of tubercle bacilli disappears after one minute. After three minutes, the tubercle bacilli are completely killed, without exception.</p>
<p>(2) When [Sanosin] is applied to the human body through internal consumption or injection, it can penetrate into the inside of various organs such as the lungs. When examining urine 18 hours later, the Dlazo reaction can be found. This reaction disappears 48 hours later, and white blood cells increase significantly.</p>
<p>(3) According to animal experiments, it was found that [Sanosin] can penetrate into tuberculous foci. When examining the tubercle bacilli lurking in the foci, they lose their acid resistance, which proves that their wax has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(4) After taking [Sanosin] internally for about a week, one can see the thinning of phlegm, the decrease in body temperature, and a pleasant state of mind and body.</p>
<p>(5) If you continue to take [Sanosin] internally for more than one or two months, you will see a significant increase in weight, a vigorous appetite, and a gradual easing of all symptoms, ultimately achieving the great merit of bringing you back to life.</p>

<h3>Hydrographic Office Sends Warships to Survey the Great Port of the East</h3>
<p>▲ Warships Jingxing and Qingyun Left Yesterday</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Office in Fenglinqiao, this city, recently received an order from the Ministry of Navy to expedite the survey of the Great Port of the East in order to comply with the Premier's industrial plan. After receiving the order, the Office immediately sent personnel to inspect the shoreline of the port outside Dongmen, Haiyan County, in order to select suitable warships for the survey and complete it on schedule. It is reported that the Office has specially ordered the Jingxing and Qingyun survey warships, which originally surveyed the waterways around Jiangyin, to be transferred in advance to survey the Great Port of the East in Haiyan. It is understood that the two warships, after receiving the order, set sail from Shanghai yesterday and departed from the port at 2 PM to begin the survey.</p>
<h3>Record of a Lecture on Public Concession Finance</h3>
<p>▲ Property Tax Collection Changes to Valuation Method</p>
<p>Mr. Ford, the Finance Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, was invited by the Municipal Research Association of the Youth Association on Szechuen Road at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday to give a lecture on [Financial Problems of the Shanghai Public Concession]. Mr. Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, presided over the lecture. After the Chairman gave an introductory speech, Mr. Ford gave the lecture. The following is a record of his speech. If we want to discuss the financial problems of the Shanghai Public Concession in detail, it cannot be done in a short period of time. Therefore, I can only give a brief report on its general situation for your reference. The finances within the Concession are divided into four parts: (1) Budget, (2) Revenue, (3) Public Debt, and (4) Expenditures. The Municipal Council must first prepare a budget table for all income and expenses each year, and then make disbursements according to the budget. The Economic Committee of the current term is responsible for preparing the budget table. The Committee will compile a table of all recurring and non-recurring expenses for the following year, and then submit a draft to each department for reference (such as police and health) for additions, deletions, or corrections. After all parties agree that it is appropriate, it will be formally submitted to the Finance Department, which will then submit it to the Economic Committee of the next term for review and approval. Temporary items mostly belong to the improvement of municipal administration and construction, and are important tasks to promote municipal administration. If it is within our power, we will do our best to do it. If we encounter financial difficulties, we will issue public debt to make up for it. However, the Economic Committee can also postpone projects that are not urgent. The above situation is the procedure and method of the Municipal Council's financial budget案. Now, let me talk about the Municipal Council's income. In general, it is divided into four items: (1) Land Tax, (2) Property Tax, (3) Wharfage Dues, and (4) License Fees. The land tax is assessed every three years according to Article 9 of the Yangjingbang Regulations. The current collection standard is 7/1000. The total revenue in 1911 was 1.43 million. From 1921 to 1931, the revenue increased threefold. Therefore, the recent revenue is about 4 million. For property tax, the collection standard in 1911 was 11%. Since 1921, it has been changed to 14%. The revenue has increased by more than one time every ten years on average from 1911 to 1931 (the total property tax revenue in 1931 was more than 22 million for foreigners and more than 24 million for Chinese). In order to prevent fraud and ensure fairness in tax collection, the Municipal Council plans to change the method of property tax collection to valuation. However, if the citizens think it is not in compliance, they can apply to the valuation committee for reassessment. As for the license fee revenue, the revenue in 1911 was 450,000, 720,000 in 1921, and 1.8 million in 1931. In addition, there is wharfage dues revenue of about 1.4 million per year. However, due to time constraints today, I cannot report on all the remaining items completely. If there is a chance in the future, I will talk to you again.</p>

Li Zaorong and Rong Jialian, representatives of the capital, Rong Shilin and Deng Zhongyu, representatives of the workers, Gu Bingyuan, chairman of the committee, and Wang Zhixin, recorder, attended. After a lengthy discussion, four items of the agreement were signed: (1) The Chinese tobacco factory and 159 workers, including Rong Junlin, terminate their employment relationship. (2) The factory shall issue severance pay of three months' wages to 159 workers, including Rong Junlin, in accordance with the Interim Measures for Severance Treatment of Employees in this city, totaling 11,194.5 yuan. (3) The aforementioned severance pay must be issued by the factory first. (4) This agreement shall be effective from August 2, 1919.</p>
<h3>An Appeal for Disaster Relief in Qinghai</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram Received by the Red Cross</p>
<p>Qinghai is located in a remote border area. Due to inconvenient transportation, news is blocked. The Red Cross Society of China recently received a telegram from the Qinghai Provincial Relief Council reporting on the disaster situation, which is worse than that of the Henan and Shaanxi provinces. The mails were inspected, and it was impossible to publicize it to the outside, so those who know it are very few. The telegram is divided into four items: plague, famine, banditry, and military burden. The following is a special excerpt: (1) The plague: Since the earthquake in the ninth year of the Republic of China, the plague has been prevalent, starting in the 29 Mongolian banners and gradually spreading to the eight tribes of Hainan and the 25 tribes of Yushu. At first, only cattle and sheep were infected. It is estimated that more than 1.2 million cattle and sheep died in the 29 Mongolian tribes, more than 1.9 million cattle and sheep died in the eight tribes of Hainan, and more than 2.2 million cattle and sheep died in the 25 tribes of Yushu. Later, due to the inner consumption of Mongolian and Tibetan people, it gradually spread to people. It is estimated that more than 70,000 people died in the 29 Mongolian tribes, more than 90,000 people died in the eight tribes of Hainan, and more than 100,000 people died in the 25 tribes of Yushu. There is a lack of medicine and no relief, and the dead are lying on top of each other. (2) The beauty of famine: Only a few counties in Qinghai produce grain. The rest do not produce any grain. Even in bumper years, the output of each county is not enough to supply one-third of the demand from the Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots in addition to supplying the food for the people in each county. When the famine passes, not only do the Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots have nothing to eat, but also the people engaged in agriculture in each county cannot escape being displaced. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, the wheat ears turned yellow and the barley had no harvest. At that time, Liangzhou transferred rice to prolong the remaining life. The Sino-Foreign Relief Society allocated 50,000 yuan to purchase and transport grain from other places to provide some relief, but it was a drop in the bucket and the total number of survivors was limited. It is estimated that more than 80,000 people died in each county this year, and the number of deaths among the Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots is not included. Since the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, there has been a drought year. After the drought, hailstorms have been formed in each county. Last year, rat plagues occurred in Xunhua, Bayan, and Min counties, and the seedlings were gnawed and withered before they were filled, resulting in no harvest. Yellow plagues occurred in Yaodu, Xining, Datong, and Huzhu counties. When the wheat was about to be filled, it suddenly turned into yellow powder. The county people had nothing to eat, and the Mongolians and Tibetans were even more disappointed. Grass roots and tree bark were searched and exhausted. The villagers of Ledu even filled their stomachs with Qing soil containing oil. The villagers of Xunhua even boiled the leather of the soles of their shoes to fill their stomachs. Not only that, human flesh has become a common commodity for human beings. Even if they cannot get it, even relatives and bones will not be spared. (3) The disaster of banditry: In the seventeenth year, the remnants of river bandits disturbed Ledu and Minhe counties. The strong were coerced into becoming bandits, and those who did not follow were killed. Women were either raped or abducted. Those who did not follow were killed. Some committed suicide by taking poison or jumping into wells. The most tragic thing was that the bandits stabbed children of three or four years old in the abdomen with spears and hung them in the air, watching the movement of their limbs as a play, or cut off the scrotum and put it in their mouths, or bent willow branches down and tied the child's large intestine on it, and then let go, so that the willow branches pulled the intestines high as fun. It is estimated that more than 54,000 people died in the two counties and the property loss was more than 5 million yuan. In the eighteenth year, Fengyuan, Datong, Xunhua, Tongren, Guide, and Gonghe counties were all in the hands of bandits. The slaughter in Fengyuan was particularly serious. More than 13,000 people died in the urban and rural areas and the property loss was more than 9 million yuan. More than 3,000 people died in Xunhua and more than 1,500 people died in Gonghe, with property losses of more than 2 million yuan each. More than 500 people died in Guide and the property loss was more than 100,000 yuan. More than 3,000 people died in Tongren and the property loss was more than 200,000 yuan. More than 5,000 people died in Datong and the property loss was more than 150,000 yuan. In the nineteenth year, Fengyuan and Datong counties, because of their proximity to Taishan, the hidden bandits came out to cause trouble again. More than 1,000 people died in the two counties, the livestock was plundered, and the property loss was more than 1 million each. (4) The disaster of military burden: The above three items are the direct cause of the disaster, while this is the indirect cause of the disaster. Since Feng's department arrived in Gansu in the fifteenth year, it has been sending dispatches to Xining Road to collect military pay, recruit soldiers, and demand food. Almost every day, such official documents arrive in the county, and the county clerks are rushing to urge the supply. If the supply is slightly slow, whipping will follow. When Qinghai Province was established in the eighteenth year, Feng's department entered Qinghai, with more than five divisions. If the military pay was not sufficient, military pay was collected. If the military food was not sufficient, military food was collected. If the number of soldiers was not sufficient, new soldiers were recruited. There were names such as registration fee, subsidy fee, wealthy household donation, house tax, and vehicle and horse donation for military pay. There were also various names such as camp buying, purchasing, number buying, forced buying, and promoting buying for military food. There were various methods for recruiting new soldiers, such as apportioning, arresting, and recruiting. This kind of requisition lasted for five years from the fifteenth year to the day Feng's army failed in the nineteenth year. It is estimated that more than 5 million yuan was collected for military pay, more than 4 million dan of grain was collected, and more than 30,000 soldiers were recruited. The requisition of vehicles and horses was more than 1 million. They gave everything they had to supply it, and they still could not get their favor. As a result, the Qing people who could barely make a living could not support themselves, and the households with difficult lives could not survive. Some flowed into bandits, and others turned to all directions. The number of empty houses and tents was eight or nine out of ten. In addition, there was no surplus of seed, and all the farming animals were requisitioned. People at home also had no way to cultivate, the land was barren, and there was no harvest in autumn. Those who starved to death included more than 32,000 people in Minhe, more than 17,000 people in Ledu, more than 21,000 people in Xining, and more than 23,000 people in Datong. The number of people who died in gullies and joined bandits was not below the number listed above. When the military was first conscripted, everyone said that the soldiers would protect the people and relieve the people from their inverted lives. In fact, wherever the National Army went, bandits were rampant and people were as poor as hanging upside down, which eventually led to an unprecedented disaster. The Qing people have really experienced it.</p>

<h3>Plan to Improve Avenue Edward VII</h3>
<p>▲ Straightening the Curve</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that Avenue Edward VII was built on the filled-in Yangjingbang creek, and the route has many curves, which is not conducive to driving cars. Therefore, the Public Works Departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession often straighten the road when the buildings along the road are renovated, gradually improving it to become a model wide road. Currently, when the buildings at the southern end of the Hubei Road intersection are being rebuilt, the road surface will be moved 60 feet south to form a straight line. The reconstruction of the ditches has already begun, and it is expected to be fully completed within three months. In addition, the French Concession Public Works Department also plans to widen Ningxing Street and Rue Wagner, and demolish part of the buildings behind the Great World Police Station to connect Ningxing Street to Avenue Edward VII, which will also become an east-west thoroughfare, reducing traffic congestion on Avenue Edward VII. As for Pawnshop Street on the east side of the Great World, it is planned to be incorporated into the police station, but the detailed plan has not yet been formulated.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits Outside Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>▲ Sea Bandits Land and Plunder</p>
<p>▲ Police Surround and Suppress</p>
<p>▲ More Than Twenty Bandits Killed</p>
<p>▲ County Police Captain Injured</p>
<p>At about 3 PM the day before yesterday, 11 bandit ships suddenly arrived in the 16th district of Changsha Town, Juegang, outside the Wusong Estuary. The ships were fully loaded with more than 200 sea bandits, who carried weapons and landed, surrounding the area and searching houses. Xu Zhenhai, the sixth squadron leader of the county police, heard the alarm and immediately led his team to suppress the bandits. As they approached the area, the bandits spotted them and opened fire on the police. Captain Xu immediately ordered the police to disperse, form an encirclement, and return fire on the bandits. After a fierce battle for half an hour, the remaining bandits gradually lost ground and retreated to the coast, fleeing onto the bandit ships. In this battle, two bandit ringleaders and more than 20 bandits were killed. Two policemen were killed. When the battle was at its fiercest, Captain Xu was shot in the arm, but fortunately, he was only slightly injured and there was no major problem. All nearby estuaries are now under strict guard, fearing that the bandits will come again to disturb.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Limiting Subdivided Housing</h3>
<p>▲ Opinions of the Second Section of the Municipal Police Bureau</p>
<p>The Second Section of the Municipal Police Bureau sent a public letter to various district offices and teams yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, we received a letter from citizen Wang Xiaotian, forwarded by the Bureau Chief, stating that in order to alleviate the difficulties of the people's livelihood, he earnestly requests to temporarily suspend the implementation of the method of restricting the subdivision of houses. According to our section, the original case of banning household sub-renting was handled jointly with the Engineering and Health Bureaus under the order of the authorities. It was stipulated that single-story buildings should not exceed three households, double-story buildings should not exceed five households, and three-story buildings should not exceed seven households. The purpose is to seek public peace and tranquility. Although the points mentioned in the letter have some one-sided reasons, they are not based on procedure and are not serious, so it seems inappropriate to accept them. Moreover, the Party Headquarters recently sent a letter urging the implementation of this case, which was forwarded to all subordinate departments to comply with. It is even more inappropriate to change it suddenly. Now, we plan to send a letter from the section to all district chiefs, stating that they should not be too hasty in implementing this policy, but should first persuade people. When the time is right, they should then consider imposing sanctions. If there are too many tenants, and if it is indeed detrimental to hygiene, fire safety, and public safety, they must still be banned separately to ensure safety." The Bureau Chief approved the proposed handling, and we hereby record the case and send this letter to inform you, hoping that you will take note and implement it, and instruct all your subordinates to be informed.</p>
<h3>Chen Lao Jiu Commits Suicide by Swallowing Arsenic After Failing to Bring Home His Wife</h3>
<p>The Evil Custom of "Living Two Months" After a New Marriage</p>
<p>In Zhang's house, Youche, east of Shengjia Alley, Tangqiao, Pudong, there was a villager named Chen Lao Jiu (also known as Jin Fa), 26 years old, a native of the area. He was naturally foolish and worked as a gardener. Last year, on September 26th of the old lunar calendar, he married Hua, the daughter of Hua Songlin, the owner of a tofu shop in Sanguantang, Tangqiao (currently 21 years old), through a matchmaker. After she came to his house, the relationship between the couple was still good. On February 2nd of this year, Hua returned to her mother's home to visit (according to Pudong customs, after a new marriage, the bride must return to her mother's home once in early February, a custom known as "living two months"). She did not return for a long time. On the tenth, Lao Jiu went to pick her up in person, but was suddenly stopped by his mother-in-law, who said that she had to live there for a full month. Lao Jiu was helpless and returned with his head down. Because the nineteenth was the Qingming Festival according to the lunar calendar, it was customary to worship ancestors and sweep tombs. Therefore, on the seventeenth, he went to his in-laws' house for the second time to pick her up. His mother-in-law agreed to send her back the next day, and asked her son-in-law to return first. Unexpectedly, Lao Jiu waited anxiously for several days and did not see his beloved come back. He was depressed and unhappy, and the morning before, he took a piece of red arsenic, which was stored at home for killing vegetable worms, and swallowed it in secret to commit suicide. By noon, he had been poisoned, his face turned pale. His relatives rushed him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Although the doctors tried their best to treat him, he was poisoned too deeply. He died at 7 AM yesterday, and black marks were found all over his body. The hospital notified the family of the death and asked them to take the body back. The Hua family, on the other hand, refused to send their daughter back to observe mourning, and instead invited many people to demand dowry jewelry from the Chen family, causing great injustice to the Chen family. They went to Hua's house to question them, and the bride, seeing the situation was bad, took off a gold ring, a pair of gold earrings, and two gold buttons in the meantime and deposited them in the bag of a girl with the surname of a neighbor. However, the Chen family discovered it early and searched the girl on the spot, causing a commotion far and wide. Onlookers were crowded and unable to move. The police arrived and dispersed them. The case has not yet been resolved, and the body is still lying at home and has not been buried. It is heard that the deceased had no brothers, only an old mother named Zhu, who is now 62 years old. She cried bitterly, and those who saw it could not help but sigh.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xianyu Loses His Wife and Gets His Wife Back</h3>

He filed a complaint at the Third Section of the Third District, and the police arrested the illicit lovers. Yesterday, they were taken to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Widow and Widower Become Family</h3>
<p>Xi, the wife of the deceased villager Xu Xiaodi of Gouchi House, Gang Nian Wu Tu, west of Haochen Bridge, Songnan, is a younger sister, 29 years old. After her husband died, she initially lived in peace, but after a long time, she was unwilling to remain a widow. Gu Qisheng, the son-in-law of Wu Zhuxi in the vicinity, is a tailor by profession, whose wife Wu has died. Because he was not used to sleeping alone, he had an affair with Xi Meilang, going back and forth secretly for about three years. At midnight on the 20th night of the old lunar calendar, Rong Sheng was still enjoying himself in Xi's room when he was seen by the woman's aunt Xu Zhang (58 years old). She entered the room to catch the adulterer alone, but due to her age and weakness, the adulterer escaped. The next day, Xi claimed that her mother was sick and returned home, but in reality, she followed Rong Sheng and ran away with her belongings. Therefore, she left and never returned.

<p>▲ Her Husband Frequently Abuses Her</p>
<p>Xie Mao, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 201, Baoxing Li, Tangshan Road intersection, Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou, remarried Zhu Ahong after her husband died, unable to maintain her chastity and raise her orphan. This has been many years. Her son from her previous marriage, Genfu, is now over twenty years old. Two years ago, in winter, he married Cui Xiu'e. However, Genfu works as a seaman on foreign ships and cannot often stay at home. Although the new daughter-in-law was initially safe, Ahong's old desires were still strong, and the thought of lasciviousness never left his mind. Knowing that his daughter-in-law loved to adorn herself, he repeatedly tempted her with various cosmetics. Xiu'e discerned his hidden intentions and sternly refused. Ahong, angered by his daughter-in-law's unwillingness to yield, became enraged out of shame and instigated Xie Mao to abuse her under various pretexts. When Genfu returned home, he fabricated slanderous stories, which made Genfu suspicious. The abuse worsened. Xiu'e became ill due to prolonged depression. After recovering from her illness, she was again subjected to her husband's violent beatings. Moreover, he began to pursue new romantic interests. Every time Xiu'e returned to her mother's home in Ningbo, he would steal her clothes and jewelry at will and give them to his lover. Recently, he even devised a plan to trick Xiu'e into going out to sell her into prostitution. Xiu'e uncovered the deceit and realized that she could not spend her life with him. She filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court, requesting a divorce. The other day, Judge Zhou Daren summoned them for trial. The defendant, Xie Genfu, denied all the accusations. The plaintiff, however, was unable to appear in court for cross-examination due to illness. The judge ordered that the hearing be postponed until the plaintiff recovered.</p>

<h3>Liu Weichi to Take Office in Hankou on a Fixed Date</h3>

<p>▲ Mr. Liu Plans to Reorganize the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways transferred Liu Weichi, the director of the Ministry's Business Department, who also managed the affairs of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, to be the chairman of the Pinghan Railway Reorganization Committee, and promoted Luo Panhui, the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Two Railways Bureau, to be the director of the Two Railways Bureau. This was generally reported yesterday. It is now learned that after receiving the order, Mr. Liu has scheduled the handover ceremony for 10:00 AM today. At the same time, Director Luo will take office. After the handover, Mr. Liu is scheduled to go to Beijing with the members of the Pinghan Railway Committee on the evening of the 14th to consult with Minister Sun. Then, he will take a boat to Hankou to take office at the Pinghan Railway Bureau. The officials of the Two Railways deeply admire Mr. Liu, as he has been diligent in his duties for more than a year, spared no effort in reorganizing the railway administration of the Two Railways, and treated the officials very well. Therefore, they will hold a farewell party at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Sima Road at 6:00 PM today to express their gratitude. All the officials of the railway will participate, and colleagues from the Wusong Machine Factory will also present Mr. Liu with a silver shield as a memento. Mr. Liu has drafted a plan for the reorganization of the Pinghan Railway to be implemented in stages. According to his words to reporters, the first step is to sort out the existing locomotives and vehicles and replace the old sleepers to restore transportation capacity. Because the Pinghan Railway has been repeatedly affected by military affairs in recent years, causing severe damage, it must first be repaired to restore its original state. Once the railway revenue is slightly more abundant, the second phase of the plan will be carried out, including replacing steel rails, repairing bridges, and all buildings along the route, adding new locomotives and vehicles, and purchasing machinery for repairing vehicles to expand transportation capacity. The necessary funds have been arranged by the Ministry of Railways and will be implemented soon.</p>

The association has joined forces with Lu and Dai from the Shaanxi Branch and invited six enthusiastic and hardworking comrades to go to inspect and distribute seeds. (4) Corpses are piled up in Wugong. Taking advantage of the spring cold, we have organized 40 burial teams to rush to various towns to carry out burials. The Zhen and Chang towns are being handled in advance. The mud and soil are solid, high, and thick. The original mass graves are also being raised and thickened to prevent foul odors from causing epidemics. (5) The Wugong porridge factory has been changed to distribute dry rations.

Yunmen and others personally inspected, announcing that the funds were not being wasted and the efforts were effective. It was found that the county is divided into ten districts and 44 li. The association is inspecting and distributing in Xixiang, Xianxi, Nanwu, Yongle, Houzhang, Xiaxiang, Mengdian, Jingui, Fancun, Ganbei, and Dashi, totaling eleven li, which will be distributed in four or five days. (8) Lantian County in Southern Shaanxi is severely affected and needs relief.

(9) The first and second batches of Shaanxi relief funds, each totaling 20,000 yuan, totaling 40,000 yuan, have been received. According to the above nine items, the association reports the latest situation of the Shaanxi relief efforts.

<h3>Old Nun and Disciple's Grandson in Litigation</h3>
<p>▲ Robes Passed Down Through Three Generations</p>
<p>▲ Buddhists Should Abstain from Greed and Anger</p>
<p>There is an old nun with the Buddhist name Hongdao, who is already 74 years old. She shaved her head in her youth and has spent her days devoted to chanting Buddhist scriptures. For decades, she has had no conflict with anyone or dispute with anything. Unexpectedly, she recently showed the fierce countenance of a Vajra, wanting to expel her disciple's grandson, Xingpei, from the nunnery, and did not hesitate to show her appearance in public, going to court. The reason is that Hongdao is originally the abbess of the Mengjiangtang Nunnery in Hongkou, and the Qingshengnunnery in Longji Li, North Zhejiang Road, is a branch of the Mengjiangtang Nunnery. It was previously presided over by Hongdao's disciple, Shunfu. In the first year of the Republic, Hongdao retired to the Xuantong Temple on Zhaofeng Road for quiet cultivation, and Shunfu took over as abbess of the Mengjiangtang Nunnery, inheriting the position of presiding over the Qingshengnunnery, which was taken over by Shunfu's disciple, Xingpei, passing down the robes through three generations. Recently, because Shunfu was old and sickly, her worldly heart had not died out. She often missed her hometown, so she returned to her secular home in Ningbo and has been gone for a long time. Xingpei then followed the custom of a teacher passing on to a disciple and moved to the Mengjiangtang Nunnery. Hongdao did not seek her consent and did not recognize Xingpei as her disciple's grandson, forcing her other disciples. Xingpei also disregarded her elders, scolding her at will. Hongdao then filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court. The other day, Judge Ge instructed them with the Buddhist principles of abstaining from greed and anger and not arguing with others, advising them to return to the nunnery and warning Xingpei to be respectful to her elders in the future, or she would be detained and punished. The case was then settled.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Fangsheng Steamboat Theft Case Opens</h3>
<p>▲ Defendant Confesses the Course of Events</p>
<p>▲ The Case Must Be Adjourned for Further Hearing</p>
<p>The Fangsheng steamboat of Jardine Matheson was moored at the Huasheng Wharf this time when it was suddenly broken into by someone in the dark, and a large quantity of silk and cloth was stolen, with losses amounting to 7,653 yuan. The Huishan Police Station arrested thirteen male and female suspects and recovered the stolen goods, including twenty-one sacks and four bolts of summer cloth. This has already been reported. The previous morning, the police station escorted the people and the stolen goods to the Special District Court, where Judge Xiao brought them to trial. According to Yang Jiasheng, the compradore of the steamboat, there were a total of 203 pieces of summer cloth in the cabin. This time, 60 pieces and one box of silk, totaling 28 bolts, were stolen. However, the door of the cargo hold was tightly locked, and it is not known when the thieves destroyed it to steal the goods, etc. When questioned, the arrested defendant, Chen Wencai, confessed that on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, the steamboat workers Xiao Erzi and Xiao Guizi asked me to hire laborers to go to Huasheng Wharf at midnight to move goods. I then invited Tang Lishui, Pan Xiaowangzi, and Wang Erlianzi to go. When they arrived, they saw summer cloth and other items piled up on the wharf, so they moved them into Ye Letou's barge, but did not know where they were being shipped to be unloaded. The next afternoon, I went to the Oriental Hotel to calculate the wages with Xiao Erzi and Xiao Guizi, and was arrested by detectives on the way, etc. The three defendants, Tang, Pan, and Wang, all admitted that they were invited by Chen Wencai to move the goods. According to Zhu Wenbin, I was notified by a foreign goods broker who is on the run, so I went to room 326 of the Oriental Hotel to contact someone and help them sell summer cloth and other goods. They also gave me a goods list. I initially did not know that the goods were stolen. Ye Letou confessed that my barge was hired by Chen Wencai, who asked me to transport the goods to Dongjiadu to be unloaded and then transferred to a truck from a moving company. I do not know where they ended up. Wu Akun confessed that I was entrusted by Wu Lisheng, who is on the run, to help sell the cloth, so I entrusted Shen Zhaoxiang to find a way to sell it. I did not know that it was stolen goods. Shen Zhaoxiang confessed that I had entrusted Cai Xiaochen to make a deposit of 2,000 yuan with the Zhang Jinfu Cloth Store for the summer cloth. Because there was no guarantor, it did not go through. Cai Xiaochen confessed that at the time, Zhaoxiang said that it was native cloth, not summer cloth, so I helped him make the deposit. Zhang Jinfu confessed that the manager of the Renyonghe New Cloth Store knew Cai. On the afternoon of the 9th, Cai sent 21 bags of summer cloth. I happened to be going to the public industry association. When I returned, I learned that it was someone who wanted to make a deposit. Because the cloth had no brand name and no invoice, I suspected that its origin was unclear, so I asked for a guarantor. Cai left and never returned. The next day, I was arrested. Wu Ma confessed that Wu Lisheng is my husband. On the morning of the 8th, I suddenly saw cloth and other goods transported to my home. According to Lisheng, it was obtained from an auction by a friend and entrusted to me to sell, so it was transported home. The next afternoon, it was transported away again, leaving only four bolts at home. The others, Pei Lin and Chen Songbao, confessed that they went to the Oriental to visit friends and were mistakenly arrested by detectives. Judge Xiao ordered that all the defendants be returned to custody separately and adjourned the hearing for further questioning.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute between the Shanghai South Public Bus Company and the First Brigade of the Caojing District Security Force, I am currently mediating the matter, and a definitive solution has not yet been reached. The report in yesterday's local news column that Squad Leader Gao was dismissed, Captain Wu Rugui received a demerit, and that the company filled out and submitted five duty-related bus passes, is not entirely consistent with the facts. This matter concerns the reputation of the entire security force. I implore you to make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Tang Jingxi</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I was surprised to read the report in the April 2nd issue of your newspaper about a car accident. I have never owned a car in Shanghai, so I am perplexed as to how car number 11749 was attributed to me. I am writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Ma Yinchu, April 11th</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I have read the report on page three of the local news section of your April 10th issue regarding the workers of the Chunhua Factory appealing for assistance from all sectors. Since last winter, when our factory suffered a fire due to careless work, all the conditions proposed by the workers have been resolved by the Municipal Social Bureau and are being implemented. However, regarding the reported daily subsidy of two dimes per person, which was decided upon, the factory has not fulfilled its promise in good faith. When the workers requested it, they were allegedly confronted by a large group of thugs hired to attack them, leaving them covered in injuries. How have the workers deserved such cruelty? We have always paid wages in a kind and amicable manner and have never hired thugs to attack or beat the workers. Even if this were true, why have the workers not resorted to legal means to seek a proper resolution? Overall, this action is not worthy of the attention of knowledgeable people. Furthermore, regarding the five-percent savings, there was no such item in the factory's budget before, and after the mediation by the Social Bureau, the chairman of the committee reviewed the factory's books and confirmed that there was no five-percent savings item. As for the accusations of colluding with ruffians, holding constant banquets, using cunning schemes, falsely accusing the workers of rioting, and secretly sending confidants to buy off the workers, in short, our factory has always adhered to the principle of labor-management cooperation to resolve matters peacefully. The workers' unreasonable actions are intended to cause trouble and deliberately sabotage labor-management cooperation. I believe that this action is not the will of all the workers. As for the one-dollar registration fee, it is specifically for new workers to confirm their past experiences. I humbly request that you publish this letter in your newspaper to correct the record.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Shanghai Chunhua Rubber Factory</p>

<p>▲ In Rome, Italy, a strange man was seen leading a mule on a leash to go shopping, entering several stores before being stopped and arrested by the police. He argued that the mule was his beloved pet, just like other people's dogs. Since others can walk their dogs everywhere, why couldn't he bring his mule to the stores? The police had no choice but to release him.</p>

<h3>On French Wines</h3>
<p>— Li Shuping</p>
<p>Whenever I recite Wang Han's lines about the beauty of grape wine, I long for it. It was not until I studied in France that I was able to fully enjoy the fine wine. The jade nectar and golden liquid are a delight to drink. The grapevines for winemaking are less than three feet tall, swirling like canopies. The leaves are dense and lush, with both red and white varieties. They should be planted in areas with warm temperatures and dry soil. In winter, the leaves fall, and the stems must be wrapped in straw for protection. French grapes were initially damaged by insects but have since flourished after grafting with American varieties. By 1875, they had spread throughout the country, and the yield increased annually. The best wines are said to come from Champagne and Bordeaux.</p>
<p>The grapes ripen in July and August. Thousands of berries, purple, red, and emerald green, are fresh and tempting. At this time, men and women carry baskets and enter the vineyards to pick them. The French call it "Vendanger." After enjoying the fine wine, they sing and dance, with boundless joy. This is a grand event that the villagers look forward to day and night.</p>
<p>Grapes are broadly divided into red and white varieties. Red wine is made by crushing freshly picked red grapes and placing them in wooden steamers to ferment. After five or six days, the temperature gradually rises. When it boils, the juice is squeezed out, and it becomes wine. White wine is not fermented; the juice is immediately poured into bottles. It is fragrant and delicious but lacks the taste of wine. It gradually changes after being stored for several months. Champagne is the most precious of white wines, produced in Champagne. The brewing of liqueur involves taking the juice of extremely ripe grapes, adding spices first, then adjusting the color, and pouring it into cups, dazzling and fragrant, making one feel intoxicated before even drinking.</p>
<p>French custom dictates that wine must be served with every meal, drinking and eating together, unlike in our country, where wine is usually consumed before the meal. Red wine is usually served at daily meals. Frugal families prefer to mix it with water. Champagne can be called a social wine, rarely used except for major celebrations or entertaining honored guests. However, it is also served in dance halls, priced quite high, at several tens of gold. Whenever new wine is released, all the hotels and cafes hang high [sweet white wine] signs to attract customers.</p>
<p>Wine is one of France's major commercial commodities, sold worldwide, generating huge annual revenue. Since the United States implemented Prohibition, international trade has been greatly affected. As a result, domestic supply exceeds demand, and many major wine merchants have announced closures. Recently, the government has taken measures to remedy this by vigorously promoting domestic consumption and especially reducing tax rates on export trade to boost sales.</p>
<h3>Medical Records from a Sickbed</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>An old poem says, "One gradually knows medicine from being often sick." Only a person with frequent illness has a constant connection with medicine pots and tea bowls. However, medical treatment must ultimately rely on others. In the past seven or eight years, whenever my wife has been groaning in bed and medicine has been ineffective, I have felt regret for not studying medicine ten years earlier. Although I do not know medicine, I enjoy talking about it, as I have gained experience in recognizing doctors over the years.</p>
<p>This year, illness has been particularly persistent. Despite poems for sending away guests and essays on banishing poverty, I have been unable to do anything. At the beginning of spring, I was bedridden in Benniu, relying on my relative, the Shen family. Initially, it was a toothache that spread to my neck, swelling as large as my cheek. I sought treatment from Mr. Zhang Jinhong, a Chinese medicine doctor in the town. Mr. Zhang is skilled in both internal and external medicine and is a top student of the famous Shanghai doctor Ding Ganren. He diagnosed it as phlegm toxin in the root of my tongue. After prescribing a formula, he also produced a piece of plaster for me to apply to the affected area. I told him that I had suffered from this condition in the past, and after applying the plaster, the external symptoms subsided, but the internal symptoms worsened, causing more pain. I was wary. He smiled and said, "It's okay. External dispersing methods can be heat-based or cold-based. What you encountered in the past was a heat-based dispersing method. What I am using now is cold-based. Don't avoid eating because of choking." As expected, it was as he said. So I wrote a short poem: "Doctor Ding from Shanghai is known as a national expert, His medical lineage follows Zhang Zhongjing's tradition. The source of his knowledge is truly passed down, A worldly immortal, serving to save the world."</p>
<p>In recent times, Western medicine has risen rapidly, threatening to usurp the position of Chinese medicine. However, I believe that Western medicine is science, while Chinese medicine is philosophy. When it comes to the subtlety of diagnosing symptoms and the meticulousness of using medicine, the wonderful techniques of Chinese medicine are probably beyond the reach of scientific methods. It is a pity that many Chinese medicine doctors privately keep their knowledge secret, rarely taking part in public research, and are unable to properly inherit, carry on, and promote the declining legacy of our predecessors. I recall that last month, while traveling, I met Mr. Shaoqing, a member of my clan, in Xishan. We talked at length about the medical world. He said that his daughter-in-law had suffered from intermittent fever. The local doctors all thought that the patient was weak and mostly used tonic formulas, afraid of being like a rat throwing something at a vase, resulting in raising a tiger and causing trouble. The condition dragged on for more than ten days and was almost hopeless. Fortunately, in the end, Mr. Xu Hengzhi came from Shanghai, resolutely rejected the opinions of the others, and used aggressive methods, saying that to save the master, one must first expel the thief, like a house that is old and dilapidated, but if there are thieves inside, there is no point in talking about repairs. After two consecutive doses, the illness subsided. In this critical moment, his judgment was accurate, and his courage was bold. Xu is from Wujin and has now founded the Chinese Medical Research Society in Shanghai, demonstrating his deep commitment and future contributions to the world of Chinese medicine.</p>
<h3>On the Ti Sai Design Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>The more urgent the need for something, the more overlooked it becomes. Is this not the case with design today? Design is the mother of craftsmanship. The development of foreign industry and commerce and the lack of development of Chinese industry and commerce, while due to many reasons, is largely due to the application of design. If we want to promote domestic goods and develop industry to compete with imported goods, then the importance of design cannot be overstated. Today, the call for promoting domestic goods and developing industry is deafening, yet the essential aspect of design is met with silence. Even if there are one or two ambitious individuals who strive to study and reverse the declining trend, when they complete their studies, the so-called great industrialists turn a blind eye, causing heroes to have no place to use their talents, and they will regret their rashness. This means that there is no hope for the development of Chinese design, and Chinese industry and commerce will never be able to compete with imported goods. Those who plot for the country, the high-ranking officials, should be aware of this and feel fear.</p>
<p>Although Chinese art is not developed today, there are no fewer than several thousand so-called new artists. Although there are not many art schools, there are more than ten so-called public and private art colleges. However, as far as I know, there are only a few designers in the entire country. Design departments are only at West Lake and Beijing, and the number of students is scarce, only one-tenth of the number of students in the Western painting department. These rare designers, distributed throughout China with its vast territory and abundant resources, are running around and sweating, with no time to rest. Yet, they still cannot avoid the sigh of having no use for their knowledge. This shows the indifference of society towards design. Mr. Wang Gang is a rising star in the design world today. He held a solo design exhibition in Shanghai last year, which I wrote about. Now, he is publicly exhibiting hundreds of works by his design students from the West Lake Art College at the National Products Mall on Nanjing Road. Like a voice in an empty valley, I was delighted to hear of it. I went to see it. There were many types of designs, such as porcelain, carpets, printing, woodwork, lacquerware, decoration, and advertising, all of which were complete. The harmony of colors and the ingenious composition, combining Chinese and Western elements and blending ancient and modern styles, were magnificent and perfect. Talented individuals like Ji Chun Dan Cheng, Shang Jun Cai Zhenhua, Liu Hanguang Qiu Xi, and Wang Ruliang all have keen talent and skilled techniques, demonstrating Mr. Wang's effective teaching and proving that China is not without design talent. I hope they will continue to work hard to bring a unique brilliance to the Chinese design world. I also hope that the so-called great industrialists will slightly reduce their thoughts of cutting corners and pay attention to design. Then, the future of our national industry may have some hope.</p>
<h3>Continued Research on Ancient Women's Ornaments</h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Jianfu's [Research on Ancient Women's Ornaments] and felt that the words were full of antiquity and charm. I felt an urge to add a few more items to supplement it, but it is still just a drop in the ocean, and there are many omissions.</p>
<p>▲ 袿 (Guī): Women's upper garment. The Book of the Later Han Dynasty mentions "bright 袿 and skirts," also used as ornaments. Yuan Kang's poem mentions "a gentle breeze moving the 袿."</p>
<p>▲ 襡 (Shú): Also written as 襡, similar to 袿. The Book of Jin mentions "making the courtesans wear 袿 and 襡."</p>
<p>▲ 纖 (Xiān): Also a type of 袿 ornament. The Book of Han mentions "flying 纖垂　."</p>
<p>▲ 纓 (Yīng): Worn by women when they were promised in marriage at the age of fifteen. The Book of Rites mentions "the host coming out and personally removing the bride's 纓."</p>
<p>▲ 欄裙 (Lán qún): Also known as "袜胸," a skirt that wraps around the waist from the back to the front. It is also called "合歡袜裙."</p>
<p>▲ 衵服 (Rì fú): Also a type of "袜胸." The Zuo Zhuan mentions "Duke Ling of Chen having an affair with Xia Ji. Ji gave him a 衵服. Duke Ling showed it to his favorite minister, Kong Ning Yifu, and they joked with each other, spreading scandalous history."</p>
<p>▲ 衫子 (Shān zǐ): Qin Shi Huang's edict stated, "Everyone wears 衫子."</p>
<p>▲ 褘衣 (Huī yī): The Book of Rites mentions "the 褘衣 of the Five Emperors, with patterns painted on the garment as decoration."</p>
<p>▲ 銖衣 (Zhū yī): Jia Zhi's poem mentions "the dancers hesitating because the 銖衣 is heavy."</p>
<p>▲ 紕 (Pī): The Book of Songs mentions "embroidering it with plain silk."</p>
<p>▲ 縭 (Lí): The Erya mentions "the tassels of a woman's headdress are called 縭," referring to fragrant tassels.</p>
<p>▲ 香囊 (Xiāng náng): Fan Qin's poem mentions "How to express knocking sounds? A fragrant pouch is tied behind the elbow."</p>
<p>▲ 　囊: 蝁書 mentions "The Biography of Deng You mentions dreaming near the water and seeing a woman. A fierce beast broke her 　囊 from behind."</p>
<p>▲ 裎 (Chéng): The belt for tying jade pendants.</p>
<p>▲ 帨 (Shuì): A woman's towel. Han Yu's poem mentions "The eldest daughter has tasted poetry, who will bring out the 帨?"</p>
<p>▲ 幗 (Guó): Also a type of towel. In ancient times, women all wore it, so now women are called "巾幗."</p>
<p>▲ 　 (Dāng): Jade earrings. An ancient poem mentions "Waist like flowing plain silk, ears adorned with bright jade earrings."</p>
<p>▲ 豫 (Yù): The Rapid Characters mentions "The 襐飾 are carved intricately and unparalleled." The 襐飾 are placed behind the ears and carved.</p>
<p>▲ 珥 (Ěr): A type of hairpin. The Records of the Grand Historian mentions "The lady took off her hairpin and earrings and kowtowed."</p>
<p>▲ 玉搔頭 (Yù sāo tóu): Chu Zai's poem mentions "A beautiful woman drops a jade hairpin."</p>
<h3>Contradictions</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>A philosopher said, "Life is inherently contradictory." I do not believe it. However, in reality, contradictions constantly arise in a person's life. If life is contradictory, there is some truth to it. Here are some examples.</p>
<p>Recently, the London Motorcycle Association invited Earl Malisher to give a lecture. Malisher is a famous British car dealer, who should have promoted cars to the public. However, in his speech, he strongly praised motorcycles. He even said, "Even if everyone in society bought a car, they still would not have a perfect solution for comfort and happiness."</p>
<p>Also, the chairman of the British Savings Movement, Mr. Xilai, recently told people that he had devoted all his efforts to promoting savings for more than ten years. However, he has never saved half a penny in his life. Can you imagine this being non-contradictory?</p>
<p>There are many other contradictions. A dentist died from tooth decay. A scientist who was very knowledgeable about poisons died from accidentally eating poison. Earl of Merseburg of the Royal University of England is a famous modern scientist but likes to read old and outdated monster novels. …</p>
<h3>Travelogue to India (22)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The biography of Xuanzang is not easy to read. It contains many English new spellings of Sanskrit names. Even Chinese names are difficult to research and can only be guessed indirectly. Of course, Westerners list him among the explorers, occupying a position in world cultural exchange. There were more than 700 Chinese scholars who traveled to India before and after him. Many also died. The book mentions that those who came to India included Koreans and people from Cochinchina, but no Japanese. The names of Xuanzang and Faxian are known even by children, because their stories are not only in English but also in local languages such as Bengali. Moreover, their stories are often used as exam questions in various schools every year. I believe that China should also do the same. The deeds of Ban Chao, Su Wu, Zhang Qian, and Zheng He, the Three Eunuchs of the Ming Dynasty who sailed to the West, should be compiled into textbooks to inspire young people's thoughts of distant journeys.</p>
<p>The dates of the Buddha are difficult to determine. The Chinese Buddhist calendar uses more than 2,950 years. According to Dharma Master Daojie, this is calculated by going back 1,000 years from Emperor Ming of Han's dream of the golden man. However, the Indian Buddhist calendar this year is only 2,470 years since the Buddha's death. Moreover, since Xuanzang's time in the Tang Dynasty, it has been impossible to verify. At that time, there were various theories, such as 1,200 years, 900 years, 1,500 years, and 1,000 years. Now, after more than 1,000 years, how can it be determined in detail?</p>
<p>The most glorious event in Xuanzang's life was when two kings competed to invite him to be their Dharma master. King Siladitya of the Western Region demanded the head of the small King Kurmara of Mara in exchange for Xuanzang. Fearing this, the small king sent the Tang monk to the great king. The great king was overjoyed, bowed to him, and convened a congress of representatives from the eighteen countries of India to hear Xuanzang's lecture. No one dared to refute him. The king had three great elephants. Before Xuanzang left, he was given 3,000 gold leaves and 10,000 silver leaves for travel expenses. This is the most glorious honor for a student studying abroad. In addition, he received 10,000 kinds of gifts from various people. It is clear that the Indians were completely devoted to culture and taught in all directions. Their contributions were truly significant.</p>
<p>Westerners value investigation. Today, an Oriental Cultural Association should be organized. The leader should set out and investigate according to the diaries of Tang monks and others, in order to compare the changes of the past 1,000 years. Moreover, most of those who travel to India today do not go to the upper reaches of the Ganges River. If one is patient and comes down from the northwest, there are many Buddhist sites that can be investigated. Those who come to India in the future must bring three books in Chinese: Records of the Western Regions, Records of Buddhist Countries, and A Record of the Buddhist Religion as Practiced in India and the Malay Archipelago. I did not bring these books, and reading English is quite disconnected.</p>
<p>In Xuanzang's time, Buddhism was very prosperous in Kolkata, with 24 temples. Today, there is not a single Buddhist temple in India. Only people from Ceylon come to build them. Indians say that the Buddha was just a small child of our country, a product of our land. Our philosophy and culture are like a treasure mountain, and Buddhism is just a stone on the mountain, nothing strange. They are not far from each other. Therefore, those who come to India should quickly learn the Indian language in order to understand it. This statement is considered heretical by Buddhists. However, today, all philosophy requires comparative research. India has preserved its Hinduism for 4,500 years. Today, Buddhism has long been extinct, and the Indians do not care, as if it were just a stone removed from a mountain. Their exaggeration is such that it must be worth seeing. I hope that many people will come to study and investigate the truth.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial: Gold Market Weakened Last Week</h3>
<p>▲ Fell by Sixteen and a Half Taels: The benchmark gold price fluctuated last week, turning from sharp to weak, which was a reaction after several days of continuous increases. This was due to factors such as the shrinking of overseas silver markets and bills of exchange, especially the enthusiastic selling by speculative heavyweights. However, the waves were turbulent and unpredictable, with daily fluctuations of more than ten taels, causing widespread anxiety. The trend was unstoppable, whether wind or rain. Tracing back to Tuesday (the first day of trading after the holiday), it once surged to 740 taels, an increase of 43.5 taels, mostly due to the competing purchases of Wu Mou and Yuansheng. However, on Saturday, Yongheng, Yuansheng, and Wu Mou and others dumped their holdings (with some companies adding to the sell-off), causing a sudden drop to 708 taels. This five-day period saw a difference of 35.5 taels, with an overall drop of 16.5 taels. The general rate was up 0.0625, and the silver price increased by 0.625. However, the Shanghai sterling exchange only increased by half a point, so the daily gold price fell by 0.015, and the domestic market also tended to loosen. Due to conflicting international news, the market situation was unpredictable. The exchange settlement price was deducted by 50 to over 80 taels, with the final price being 68 or 69 taels. In addition, it was found that fellow traders such as the Dalian Gang and Wu Mou were generally bullish. Fuchang, Yuanheng, and others who arbitraged through bills of exchange were also mostly long. However, Yongheng and Lu Mou and others were short. The Guangdong Gang Hengxing was said to have roughly broken even. The general situation of the week is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ The Trend Changed from Steady to Weak: Due to the Western holiday on Monday, on Tuesday (April 7), the general rate decreased by 0.0625, the silver price decreased by 0.625, the immediate rate was reduced by one point, and the domestic market was also tight. Fellow traders covered their shorts, and the initial benchmark gold price for May was opened at 726 taels, an increase of only one tael. There were only 24 taels traded, and there were still many sellers due to rumors of Binaguchi's critical illness in Japan. Subsequently, large traders enthusiastically purchased, soaring upwards, eventually rising to 41 taels. Suddenly, there were rumors of a silver shortage in the United States, causing it to fall. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Hengxing, and others sold, causing a drop of six or seven taels. In the afternoon, the Indian exchange rate was reported to have fallen, and buyers were more persistent, causing it to rise again. In the end, it rose a total of ten taels, reaching 43.5 taels. It closed at three taels, having increased for five consecutive days, a total of 18 taels (overall increase of 48.8 taels). The entire day saw a fluctuation of 20 taels. On Wednesday, the general rate again decreased by 0.1875 to 0.25, the silver price decreased by 0.25, and the immediate rate was also reduced by half a point. However, the domestic market seemed to loosen, and Chinese traders sold slightly. The initial benchmark gold price fell by five taels to 38 taels, due to the impact of the private telegram indicating a rise in silver prices. It then rose to 42.5 taels due to purchases by the Dalian Gang, Cuichangyong, and others. The subsequent downward trend was only 33.5 taels, as the domestic immediate rate weakened and sellers seemed strong. The afternoon was uneventful, and it closed at 35.6 taels, falling 7.4 taels from the previous day, which was a reaction after five consecutive days of increases. That day saw a fluctuation of nine taels. The next day, the general rate decreased slightly by 0.0625, and the silver price increased instead by 0.25. The immediate rate remained unchanged, and the domestic market was weak as fellow traders first covered their shorts and then sold. The initial gold market was at 33.5 taels, down 2.1 taels. Subsequently, Wu Mou sold his long positions, causing a sharp drop of ten taels to 22.5 taels. At noon, rumors of India maintaining its exchange rate spread, causing it to rise by four taels and close at 26 taels. In the afternoon, rumors of political turmoil in Japan spread, and the speculator Wu Mou and others dumped their holdings, suddenly falling to 720 taels, a drop of 16 taels. It closed at 16.5 taels, continuing to fall by 19.2 taels, with a total fluctuation of 18 taels. On Friday, the general rate increased by 0.3125 to 0.25, and the silver price increased by 0.625, so the immediate rate was increased by two points. The domestic market tended to strengthen, showing a divergence between the clear and dark trends. Chinese traders first covered their shorts and then held their positions. The benchmark gold price seemed to rise, opening at 715 taels, a slight drop of 1.5 taels. Then it was 14 taels. Subsequently, buyers were enthusiastic, soaring more than ten taels. At noon, at 27.5 taels, rumors of a silver mine strike in the United States spread, causing it to rise again by seven or eight taels. In the afternoon, Xinhong, Yuancheng, Hengxing, Yuan Lu Mou, and others sold, causing it to fall to 11 taels. Later, buyers were active, and rumors of the Japanese cabinet still resisting and not changing its policies spread, boosting confidence and raising the price by ten taels. It closed at 20 taels, up 3.5 taels from the previous day. The total fluctuation for both markets was 16.2 taels. On Saturday, the general rate did not change, and the Shanghai exchange rate remained the same. However, the domestic market loosened slightly, and traders sold to arbitrage. The benchmark gold price opened at 721 taels, up one tael. Subsequently, large traders sold enthusiastically, gradually decreasing, suddenly breaking the 710 tael mark at noon, reaching 0.8 taels. It closed at 0.85 taels, falling 11.5 taels from the previous day. The fluctuation in half a day was 13 taels, showing a weakening trend. However, there may still be strong changes in the future. The high and low prices of the British, American, Indian silver markets, and the bills of exchange benchmark gold price are described below.</p>

<p>Yesterday's London telegram stated that both spot and forward silver prices rose by 0.0625, reaching 13 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling, 3 and 3125/10000 pence in British gold). There was slight buying in the local Chinese market, with limited trading and a calm market atmosphere.  A New York telegram reported that the American silver price increased by 0.25 to 2.28375. The British pound fell against the US dollar by 0.03125 to $4.8532 29ths. The US dollar fell against the British pound by 0.0625, to $4.85875.

<h3>Sunday's Settlement Similar to Other Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday.  There was no news from the banks, and the atmosphere in the money market was more deserted than usual. The price of foreign silver dollars in the morning and afternoon markets was 7 yuan, 2 fen, 6 li, 1 hao, 2 hu and a half, comparable to the afternoon market of the previous day.  The silver discount rate opened at 2 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly better than the previous day's borrowing rate.  The amount of foreign exchange transactions was 420,000 yuan in the morning market and 357,000 yuan in the afternoon market.  The amount of banknote transactions was 15,000 yuan in the morning market, with no transactions in the afternoon market.  Over-the-counter banknote transactions were 50,000 yuan in the morning market and 40,000 yuan in the afternoon market.  There were no records of bank transactions or settlements. Money shops' settlements of foreign public bills were over 6.3 million yuan, with no news of foreign head bill settlements.  Settlements of silver public bills were over 2.9 million yuan.

<h3>Securities Fell Nearly Two Yuan Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Other trends continue to be stagnant with slight increases compared to previous periods.</p>
<p>▲The number of transactions was only over 21.1 million.</p>
<p>During last week, the trading of government bond futures and spot goods on the Shanghai securities market was suspended for the first two days due to the festival. Trading only took place for four days starting from Wednesday. Although the number of transactions slightly increased compared to the previous week, there was still no turning point. The quiet state of the market remained unchanged. The futures trading volume was 6-7 million on Wednesday and Thursday, but only around 4 million on the weekend. The total trading volume was 21.17 million yuan. Among them, the 20-year cigarette bonds had the highest trading volume, accounting for 7.28 million yuan. The trading volume of other bonds, such as the Disbandment Bonds (裁兵) was 3.995 million yuan, the Troop Reduction Bonds (編遣) was 2.585 million yuan, the 1920 bonds was 2.405 million yuan, the 1920 Customs bonds was 1.96 million yuan, the 96 Public Bonds (九六公債) was 1.55 million yuan, the Consolidated 6 bonds was 740,000 yuan, the Customs Bonds (關稅) was 490,000 yuan, and the trading volume of other bonds was only tens of thousands of yuan. The spot trading was also very rare, with a total of only 54,400 yuan. Among them, the 1920 Customs bonds was 28,000 yuan, the Disbandment bonds was 11,000 yuan, and the trading volume of other bonds was only several thousand yuan. Except for the foreign bonds, the prices of other bonds mostly fluctuated gradually and firmly, but only fluctuated around 0.2 or 0.3 yuan per day. The major buyers and sellers remained on the sidelines. The supply and demand continued to be extremely balanced. The 96 Public Bonds had the most volatile fluctuations. Although they did not collapse on Wednesday to Friday, there were no major increases or decreases. However, on the last day of the week, the sales in the market were suddenly much stronger than the purchases, resulting in a sharp decrease of over one yuan, a decrease of 1.89 yuan compared to the previous week. However, the price changes of other bonds were limited, only between 0.2-0.3 yuan to 0.6-0.7 yuan. It is difficult to expect the bond market to develop in the short term. The following is a statistical breakdown of the high, low, and change in prices of various bonds in the past four days (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Marked Yarn Weak in the Long Term Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Fine yarn increased by 8-9 taels.</p>
<p>▲Customer sales were also quite active.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn had a rising trend at the beginning of last week. This was because the Hua Nan and Hua Bei guilds were eager to purchase, and the Sichuan guild followed suit, with aggressive purchasing. Therefore, the spot yarn market was very tight. Most of the Japanese yarn was shipped to Japan, and there was no goods for sale in Shanghai. The selling price increased daily, and the raw material was in short supply. However, the fine yarn market was more stable, and the price increased by 8-9 taels compared to the previous week. However, the price of coarse yarn was difficult to increase due to the increased inventory. Most retailers tended to sell short because of the sluggish overseas cotton market and the downward trend in the price of third-grade yarn. The strike of customs brokers affected some shipments. Therefore, the guilds in transit temporarily stopped purchasing due to the unfavorable environment. However, sporadic transactions continued, but Japanese yarn was still in short supply, and the price did not fall. The marked yarn initially increased by 3 taels, but then fell due to the poor American cotton. As a result, the near-ear price was the same as the previous week, and the long-term price fell by 5-6 qian. The total transaction volume for the week was 89,150 bales. The customer guilds purchased a total of 18,570 bales. A considerable amount was shipped abroad and to Japan.</p>
<p>The price of third-grade yarn has fallen recently, partly because the number of domestic spindles can be slightly increased from May 1, and partly because of the cabinet issue. Therefore, the decline was severe. The price slightly rebounded at the end of the week. The following is a breakdown of the number of bales purchased by each guild:</p>
<p>Guild			Bales		Guild			Bales		Guild			Bales</p>
<p>Tianjin			1,100		Changsha			100		Sichuan			3,200</p>
<p>Guangdong		3,500		Miscellaneous		300		Inland			1,500</p>
<p>North Guild			265		Fujian			150		Wuhu				120</p>
<p>Nanyang			100		Fellow Traders		3,000		Qingdao			1,000</p>
<p>Shantou			620		Hankou			665		Jiangxi			250</p>
<p>Xiamen			100		Yunnan			1,100</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Softened by American Cotton Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market had a tendency to rise during the week because the inventory was thin, and a large number of shares were locked up by Japanese merchants and major traders. It was difficult for the exchange rate to loosen significantly, and the import of foreign cotton was still insufficient. Therefore, the situation was tight. The cotton itself was only average. Later, due to the sluggish American cotton market and the daily decline in prices, people's hearts were weak. Japanese merchants closed their long positions, and the market fell sharply. Spot cotton transactions were quiet, so the market trended down at the end of the week. As a result, the prices of marked cotton fell by 6, 7, and 8 qian in all months. The total transaction volume for the day was 227,400 dan. The source was 3,100 dan of Yao Hua cotton, 200 bales of Tong Hua cotton, 500 bales of wooden frame cotton, and 9,300 dan imported by manufacturers. American cotton fell by 50 pounds compared to last week. The following is a breakdown of the number of bales purchased by each manufacturer:</p>
<p>Manufacturer	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Transaction Volume	Deadline</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton	43.90	41.25	1,400 pieces	Spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>American Special Cotton	42.50	…	700 pieces	Also also</p>
<p>Taicang Cotton	41.00	…	600 bales	Also also</p>
<p>Wusong Cotton	41.00	…	400 bales	Also also</p>
<p>Local Cotton	40.00	…	200 bales	Also also</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rises on Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was firm and active due to short covering and buying by foreign merchants. The futures price rose by 11-13 points, and the spot price rose by 10 points. The British cotton futures price rose by 12 points, and the spot price rose by 2 points. The Egyptian cotton spot price was unchanged. The Indian cotton market was weak, with the Pingguoer price falling by 2 rupees, and the long-term price falling by 1 rupee. The Omla near and far prices fell by 1 rupee, and the Bairo Creek price fell by 1 rupee, with the long-term price falling by 3 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (telegram dated the 11th):</p>
<p>American Cotton	Compared to Previous Day	Equivalent to Shanghai Standard	British Cotton	Compared to Previous Day	Equivalent to Shanghai Standard</p>
<p>May	1032	Up 12	44.90	May	546	Up 1	48.00</p>
<p>July	1055		45.90	July	555		48.90</p>

<p>Bairo Creek 193		38.80</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Remains Soft</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, the supply from various guilds in the 20s and 30s remained sluggish. The high-quality white japonica rice market also trended soft, and secondary grades all declined. The wholesale price continued to fall by a few cents. Currently, the production market and the Shanghai market are very different. During this sudden cold and hot weather, it is difficult to keep the goods from the river for a long time. Therefore, both goods and customers advocate selling as soon as they arrive. However, sales in Shanghai are sluggish, causing the market to decline steadily. The same is true for thin rice, which is also slow, and the price has returned to around 1 jiao. Yangdu Jiao and other ports' Jiao retail sales are extremely weak, and customer demand is also not strong, and there are very few top-quality goods, and people's hearts are strangely quiet, so the market is also tired. The white yuan market has become numb, and various sellers are watching, and the price range is small.</p>
<p>▲Hu Nan: Yesterday, more than ten shipments arrived from the river, and sales tended to be weak. High-quality white japonica rice is extremely scarce here. Demand from all parties for ordinary and lower-grade rice is weak, so the price has fallen by more than 1 jiao. According to production news, the price of Southern Guild's thin early rice is extremely cheap. Therefore, street sales, retail sales, and customer sales in this port all lack interest. Only those with high-quality goods and clever prices will occasionally take action. The market is invisibly softening by a few jiao. Both Yangdu Xian arrival and sales are weak, and the situation is not good. Special top-grade Yang Xian is reluctantly priced at 11 yuan and 45 jiao. The Yin Yuan sales are calm and customer conversion is also sluggish, but there are still not many arrivals, so the wholesale price has only softened by nearly one jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Turn Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>▲Japanese Sugar Trading is Quite Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams stated that there were no arrivals due to the Sunday. The public association market planned the market. The atmosphere for Dutch Sugar No. 24 coarse and white sugar was slightly firmer, with a shouted price of 10 taels, 0 qian, and 3 and a half fen. However, buying interest was sparse, and few people accepted the offer. High-quality goods had slight transactions later in the market, with a price of 10 taels, 0 qian, and 3 and a half fen. The market image was still firm and stable. Japanese sugar started weak but then became firm again, and the trading was quite active, and the trend was still strong. N Mark was 10 taels, 0 qian, and 3 fen. YT Mark was 10 taels, 0 qian, 1 fen and a half to 10 taels, 0 qian, and 1 fen and 7 and a half fen. YP Mark was 10 taels, 0 qian, 5 fen and a half to 5 fen and 7 and a half fen. J Mark was shouted at 10 taels and 0 qian and 7 fen. SH Mark was 9 taels and 8 qian and a half, with less trading. YRO Mark was 9 taels and 7 qian, which rose to 9 taels and 7 qian and a half. Later, the Zhenjiang Guild emerged, and the price returned to 9 taels and 7 qian. The total trading volume for the entire city was nearly 2,000 bags. The market image was still pretty and elegant.</p>
