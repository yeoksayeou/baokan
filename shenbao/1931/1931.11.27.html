<p>（巴黎）國聯行政會暫定明日舉行公關會議、宣布討論結果、行政會有此嘗試、可見其預料在目前所結束關於派員赴满調查事之談判中、不致有重大阻力也明日會議如進行順利、將成行政會之最後會議、須俟接到委員團報告書後、行政會會員始續有考慮也、日本之接受行政會决議後、殆可無疑、雖日政府保留案、但僅於「發最嚴厲訓令諭其軍隊不得有可再引起新事變之任何動作」一點、在形式上而非實質上保留耳、至於中國、則事態仍稍困難、新任代理外長顧維鈞與南京政府究將採何　步驟現尙未悉、惟美國已贊同行政會議案、並勸中日兩國接受之此種舉動或可促中政府承認之也、行政會會員對於此案被雙方或任何一方所拒絕後、行政會應採之途徑意見不盡相同、聞波蘭南斯拉夫及挪威三國代表將主張不僅承認行政會辦理此事未有能力之舉動、但目前衆望此種討論可非必要、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日中國總代表施肇基致緊急文書於白里安、告以錦州中日軍隊即蔣有嚴重衝突、於是十二國理事立行召集會議、中日代表俱未岀席關會時非常秘密、即譯員亦皆屏退、各理事咸操法語、聞較小諸國皆决意贊助中國、各大國則熊度冷淡、當時并派有專員、常以會議討論情形、報告在旅邸鵠候消息之美大使道威斯、迨秘密會議完畢、道威斯立即宣稱、渠將接見報紙代表、旣而數十新聞記者紛紛趧至里茲旅館、則各得道氏一簡略通告、内稱美政府贊成國聯理事會所擬决議案内調解中日爭執之大體計畫、現已將美國贊成旨趣、通知中日兩國、請其勉受此項大體計畫等語、藉以表示美國將與國聯有最完密之合作、期作最後努力解决東三省事件道氏并宣稱、美政府正式贊成理事會所草决議案、該案係勸告日本最迅速撤兵、并派委員團調查中日爭執、當道威斯接見新聞記者宣布美國態度後、理事會亦發一公報宣稱理事會已草成一種計畫、對於撤兵與派遣調查團分别處理、業將内容通知中日政府、撮其大要、則所草决議案大致重行確定九月三十日</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>充實外交</h3>
<p>我國近年來外交機能全失。無以盡其爲政府耳目口舌之責吾人前已一再痛切言之矣茲者新代外長顧維鈞氏受命於危難之秋且已於昨日正式就職視事。吾人痛過往之失着。願再披瀝一貢所見。</p>
<p>今日國際間之譎雲詭波。瞬息千變立國於羣雄角逐之世界而無耳目以攝取各國之隠情。無口舌以傳遞本國之意志。我與世界幾若無涉其能收折衝之功效與列國相周旋者蓋事所必無。</p>
<p>我國近年以來。對於外交徒重宣傳。而不求實踐。過去茲且不論。但時至今日。國際間陰雲密佈而我且爲當事國。危難當前有賴於國際間之活動者。至大至多然而各重要强國。使節仍虚駐法争使錢永銘一再辭職。駐德公使自蔣作賓調任駐日。雖已正式委任劉文島。但劉則僕僕於湘漢之間。迄未成行駐美公使自伍朝樞返國。虚懸半載雖已任命顏惠慶。但亦延至今日。始有赴任之準備。駐意公使原派郭泰祺充任。但郭亦迄未就職。今日駐在羅馬者僅一代辦。如荷蘭公使金文泗。比利時公使傳乘常。雖榮膺公使頭衛亦尙未岀國門一步。際此危難緊急之秋正負有外交責任者積極活動之時。而今日所呈現於吾人眼前者。則爲此種冷淡現象。使政府耳目失其聰口舌失其效。機能停滯。消息斷絕。坐看東京外交之縱横裨闔。岀淵駐美。松平駐英。吉田駐意。芳澤駐法。有若生龍活虎。活躍於國際舞臺而我則僅有一施肇基在國聯門前唱獨脚戯。欲以此爭外交上之勝利博國際間之同情是何能得革命外交固若是乎。此誠吾人所百思而不得一解者也</p>
<p>顧維鈞氏今旣已正式受任代理外交部長之職矣。懲前毖後。吾人深盼其能注意於充實外交之機能第一應立即遴選適當之人才。派任各國之使節。第二應郭促業已受命之人員限期赴任第三應撥付駐在各國使館之經費母靳此必不可少之費用而阻滯其活動。第四應授以活動之方針。切實郭促其發展。先使耳目靈口舌活。生機盎然夫然後可以言外交。夫然後可以與羣雄相角逐於國際政治之舞臺。</p>

<p>（巴黎）日代表今日破曉以前藉無綫電話與日政府通話、接受日本對於理事會所草擬决議案之訓令、據日代表團發言人聲稱、日政府態度頗有利於决議案料本日將再開始私人接洽、俾可獲得一圓滿之議案、日政所提議之修正、不致變更决議案之重要條件、聞日人堅持决議案内第四章關於（命令中日統兵長官禁止自行開端造成足以引起喪失生命之意外事件）一節、將修改爲（倘軍隊被土匪進攻時、准許統兵長官有軍事行動）又據日代表團發言人稱、日本不能同意於規定撤兵日期、（二十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）中國向行政院要求三事、（一）立即採取有效方法藉以制止日軍攻撃行爲行政院於此、當答以業向東京南京提岀要求、原文已於今日公布、（二）日軍撤退事、應由中立國代表監視、此層外國觀察員業已遣派中國自可安心、（三）限定撤兵日期、此層未能承認、原因十五日以來凡所磋商、均將因此而歸於無效、抑從事磋商者不祇雙方當事國、即美國亦在其内、按美國政府頃所表示之意見、中國實無取獲滿意結果之希望、行政院熟籌以後覺其最後提議各節、不能再有進　　　　　　　　　全失敗其結果至爲惡劣、於中國　國聯會兩俱不利、因是一般人均希望中國深思遠　、鑒於國聯會登　造極之决議、與夫華盛頓之意志曁莫斯科之冷淡情形、終將與行政院各會員國聯爲一氣、較爲得計、今晚施肇基已向南京請訓、行政院某會員對於此事、作有巧妙響喩、據云、以現在情形而論、南京政府所望於國聯會者、未免過奮、國聯會宛如國際銀行、而會員爲其存户、該行　　界經變動週轉不靈對於存欵僅能按三成歸還存户、若果予以拒絕、未免不達時務云云、設南京政府對於行政院决議案、不予容納其代表當於表决時拒絕投票、如是則决議案仍可保持在法律上及在精神之價値、而行政院可立即指定查團遣其前往、一般人印象、行政院已達結束之期、本星期末當可散會、（二十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（北平）施肇基提議在中日兩軍駐地之間闢一中立區域、由外兵担任區内警務一節、此間外國當局皆以爲派兵一層、碍難辦到、此項軍隊除有牵入戰爭之危險外、且華北現駐之少數外兵、各有任務、亦未可騰岀以担負此役云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>俄報指摘國聯</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）今晨共黨機關報泊拉夫速報、評論巴黎消息所傳國聯理事會提岀之新折衷辦法、指謂僅遮迷衆人之目、理事會實際不能解除此糾紛、因各帝國主義國家居於互相衝突地位、日本準備獨呑中國北部、而得法人之默助、法人欲利用日本以制美、美國與英國則不然、雖不反對奴與刦掠中國之政策、但極反對日本之獨佔大份、所以各帝國主義國家將互相掣肘、俟有一方讓步而後已、（二十六日國民社電）</p>
<h3>美國表明態度</h3>
<p>認召集九國會議尙非必要</p>
<p>對日採有效處置亦願參加</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國政府某重要人物今日宣稱、美國對於解决中日滿洲問題之意見、完全與國聯相同、外傳美國與國聯意見分歧之説、實屬不確、同時道威斯在巴黎亦有同様聲明、至於外間傳説美國不願與國聯共同採取對付日本之説、亦經華府當局否認、美國非但無與國聯携貳之意、將來國聯倘取有效手段處置日本之時、美國亦頗願加入、以收經　封鎖等等方法之實效云、再則英美對於满洲事件成立特别諒解之説、美國國務院及英駐美大使館皆不重視、美國國務卿史汀生及其他高級官員尙不致對於满洲問題有何露骨之表示、但對於召集九國條約簽字國之會議、以求解决中日問題一節、則明白表示爲時尙遠云、美國現在毫無籌備召集會議之表示也、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府已贊成昨日國聯行政會所成立之議案、並勸告中日政府接受之、路透社今日探悉美政府準備贊助派員赴满調查、而不考慮日軍撤退、並决定美國可派員參加此委員團、不過美代表將純以私人資格服務國務、院接遠東官塲報告、已使史汀生確信有許多地方日軍之撤退、可發生騒擾之結果、據其負責方面云、美政府之態度以爲調查團須俟敵對行爲停止後、方可開始其工作、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）政府對於满洲爭端、舉棋不定、致使與論趨勢亦不一致、大多數意見、不欲美國以有效方法從事干涉、俾與國聯會之行動同時併進、尤其是國聯會所可採取之經濟壓迫、波拉及參議院均所反對、（紐約電報）報雖發表若干論文主張　厲對付但輿論似未充分養成、胡佛總統未必毅力主持加之選舉在即、政府安於無爲、而美日兩國商業利益、亦甚重要自不以能不審愼岀之、據國務院半官式消息、經制裁手段、非經參議院事前許可、政府無能爲力、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英下院辯論東省事件</h3>

<h3>外人視察戰地</h3>
<p>稱許馬部所築戰壕</p>
<p>（瀋陽）漫遊北滿之外國有資格觀察家頃抵此間、聞外間所傳馬占山將軍近於抗日之戰爭中、曾獲蘇俄恊助之説、付之一笑、按此間日軍事當局對於此事、從未獲有直接證據、慬蒐集零星證物、遂指蘇俄曾助馬作戰、抵此之外國觀察家曾游於满洲里·齊齊哈爾·及昂昂溪、且於十一月十八日大戰之前、閲視馬部所築之戰壕、絕未得蘇俄助馬之證或者蘇俄曾將窳劣之戰品售與馬占山、但即此亦絕對不能覓得任何證據、馬部營内與戰壕内僅有華兵、及少數漢蒙合種之人、此輩任黑省固多也、馬軍中似確有曾在西比利亞陸軍中受有訓練者若干人、馬軍在昂昂溪南面所築之戰壕、據專家評論、工作甚佳、殆堪稱中國陸軍第一次之佳作、所惜者岀口正向敵軍、而不在側面致毀全功此誠大誤也、昂昂溪附近中東鐵路北而及齊齊哈爾車站亦築有絕佳之戰壕、但華兵退走後未守此戰壕段、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>日侵黑省</h3>
<p>蘇俄隱忍原因</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）據可恃方面消息蘇俄對於日軍侵入北满、佔據昂齊、及以親日派爲黑省行政長官等事、將不採任何行動、哈爾濱俄員稱、即使日本再進一步、而日本軍閥確有對俄挑　之意、但莫斯科亦不改其目前不活動之政策云、察俄國官場、似方集其全力以經營其所謂五年計晝、無暇兼顧遠東事件、蓋莫斯科政府之生命、繫於五年計晝之成、功須俟俄羅斯實業化計晝成功、使蘇維埃立於穏固地位後、蘇俄政府勢力方可不唯紅軍擁護是賴、今若派大軍入滿洲邊界、與日本爭北满、則莫斯科政府之傾羅、或不能免、况西比利亞軍隊現尙未能與設備精善之日本較最短長、故尤不能冒此險、俄國之所以對於東四省内甚重要變化、卒抱不表示甚大注意之態度也（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日本詆毀國聯</h3>

<p>張學良氏於二十二晚發表對外宣言譯文如左據巴黎二十日理事會消息之報告使中國全國及小心注意國聯職務者均得一種印象即國聯所担任之職務爲阻止再有戰事之發生而使满洲嚴重形勢減至最低程度　國聯理事會於此對現應堅持之一點則置諸一徬據報　理事會對實行其十月二十四日之决議案已告失敗按該决議案明白極力表示爲對满洲危機獲得一和平公正之解决第一步須堅持南　鐵路線外之日軍應於十一月十六日前退岀中國領土苟此項報告屬實則國聯理事會對尊重其本身提案及命令之堅持已告失敗則國聯本身是否不承認無力處置此項形勢不能不引起嚴重疑問且若是措置殊非國聯將來之佳兆</p>
<p>巴黎或日内瓦方面之景象必定與東京南京或北平大不相同但日軍不僅未遵國聯理事會之决議案退岀满洲之中國領土且確採取侵佔中國其他領土之政策此項事實當爲世界各都會所共知</p>
<p>日軍於十一月十六日理事會在巴黎開會時藉口保護交通進兵北满此種事實是公然蔑視理事會十月二十四日之决議案日軍現已佔領中東路北方之齊齊哈爾並更向北進擴充其軍事行動</p>
<p>中國政府前已一再表示其願意保護南满鐵路地帶外日僑生命財產之安全惟因日軍閥之政策及其行動致阻止中國之意願無由實現日軍一方切斷吉黑兩省之交通同時復以秩序之紛亂責備中國因事實所昭示直接可知係日軍隊本身之行動</p>
<p>而日軍於佔領瀋陽時謂满洲中國軍隊極多此係誑言近日日方聲稱中國騎兵集中通遼五萬大軍正向錦州集中且有满載步兵之列車自平津開抵關外此項報告均係不確此又係日方將用爲再擴大其預定侵略政策之口實</p>
<p>日軍事當局没收满洲合法政府之收入企圖以財政告竭之危險　　吾人用心何在昭然若褐</p>
<p>施肇基氏在日内瓦已反覆誠懇申述此項形勢雖據報理事會將爭點置諸一傍而討論條約權利問題但中國對理事會尙未失其信任之心中國承認於適當時期及適當地點討論關於满洲條約權利之全部問題惟理事會對满洲爭點須堅持日軍先行撤退之主張中國方能作原因及條約内所包括問題之交涉理事會如不能解决满洲铖機則無意議中將使事件益趨擴大此有極大之可能性</p>
<p>現在有種種機會應喚起注意即理事會只有堅持恢復原狀之主張方能使觀察者格外明瞭東北現狀在空前異狀之下中國本與國聯合作並已接收國聯之提案</p>
<p>余不能不發表個人之意見因余明瞭國聯對在满洲設立傀儡政府與日軍閥取一致政府之如何不智此項政府前途必致失敗余對將來世界如何對待國聯盟約凱洛格非戰公約及華盛頓九國條約深爲懷疑無乃此等條約將均成廢紙耶）</p>

<h3>民族主義的敎育與圖强</h3>
<p>雪恥　徐征吉</p>
<p>東　來犯、暴行未已、　其野心、浸浸乎有呑併我國之雄圖、吾人生逢斯世即應籌如抗　之方、所謂匹夫有責者是也、然雪恥圖之道、不尙空談、須有具體之計劃乃可、昔越之敗吳也、賴十年生聚十年敎訓之攻、今吾人欲報國仇、其道亦莫外乎此、所謂生聚者、聚天下之富庶、磨練以須也、敎訓者、即今之敎育也、前人之法、後人之師、吾人旣深信以敎育的力量可以雪恥圖强、而吾人旣列身敎育界、烏得不有所警勵、而求如何使敎育雪恥救國乎、日是亟待吾人今後之力行耳、</p>
<p>惟是敎育旣有如中效级、則迥非往昔頺唐無精神無主旨之敎育爲功、換言之、則須有加以改造、充實民族主義的精神、合民族爲一心、使國人　能皈依民族主義敎育之下、洞悉民族合離之利害、以全民衆之力量盡寄存於整個民族精神之中乃得然後始終贯澈民族主義的敎育、吾謂能如是、則庶有易也、今請言民族主義敎育之梗槪、</p>
<p>總理解釋民族主義之意義有二、日中國民族自求解放、日中國境内各民族一律平等、意即係吾人須如何努力、始得國家解放爲汪獨立完全自由平等之民族、簡言之、即如何使脱離帝國主義之壓迫、俾獨立於世界、同時並認國内各民族有自决權、以平等的精神、互相結合、組織自由統一的中華民國、吾人今日、即根據此二大點、而以驅策全國敎育、因命其名日民族主義的敎育、次分論之、</p>
<p>一、實現民族主義敎育以普及敎育爲第一步驟例如此次暴日犯我、凡智識階級與身厠都市中者、固咸能知之、然訊之鄕村農夫、或偏僻之地之居民、願猶　乎不知也、夫國恥者、乃各個國民所共有之恥辱也、今之注意抗日宣傳即須啟迪一般人使知國難當頭、欲圖自存、即非雪此奇恥大辱不可、蓋以使全民衆知已有之恥、應設法洗雪、向之僅爲一部分智識階級及身處都市中少數人之恥、以變爲普遍多數人之恥、欲如是、則當用敎育以明恥、老友吳君增芥主張先設施成人敎育、以期救濟、其法甚是丨而普及敎育尙矣、</p>
<p>吾人最大之仇人、僉知爲日本、彼邦維新以來、僅五十年之努力耳、乃一變而爲世界强國、要亦普及敎育之力、據彼邦文部省最近統計報告、全國受敎育者、爲百分之九九·五、是可見其敎育普及之一般、反觀我國、則識字者僅十之一二弱臆、亦劇可憐已、吾人旣認敎育爲重要、認敎育可以啟迪民智、可以救國、則普及敎育、實爲當今不容稍緩之圖、至如何使普及敎育之實現、是爲敎育行政當局之責職、征恐不　矣、</p>
<p>二、民族主義的敎育應培養國民自尊情緖以確立國格、我國民向以和平禮讓爲美德、然對内則可、對外則大不宜也、此次暴日侵我東省、東省長官、竟以不抵抗主義而昭示吾人與世界各國、姑息養奸、遂致引狼入室、在倡言此主義者、固自有其苦衷在、然益見我懦弱民族精神之不振作耳、貽笑友邦、能無痛心、生活週刋　奮先生謂（天下主義亦多矣、未有高喚不抵抗　主義者一）、旨哉斯言、故吾人民衆主義的敎育、將使學生皆有自尊心、當仁不讓、見義勇爲頭可斷、志不可屈、人有人格、國家又何獨不然、抽象用定名日國格、顧全國民皆爭此國格、</p>
<p>三、民族主義的敎育以國恥爲一切設施之中心、民族主義的敎育、其主要目的已如上述、一言之、欲冀以圖存雪恥也、誠如第一項可以實現矣、則各級學校、皆須厲行國恥敎育、使學生對於國恥、皆有深切之認識、方法即將現有坊間所岀各種敎科書、皆增加國恥敎材、各校並得酌量情形、自行編撰補充、至學校一切之佈置、訓育、管理各項、亦皆以國恥爲背景、臥薪嘗膽、付諸實踐、則十年敎种、又何患事之不舉、惟有須注意者、即管理須改變方針也、吾謂放浪不　、浮　不切實際、視今日大中學生爲尤甚、以此種貪聞惡勞醉生夢死之學生而救國、適足以速亡其，國、　是學校亟須從事嚴格管理、養成紀律化之生活、以爲救亡之準備、</p>
<p>四、民族主義的敎育發　中華民族精神以聞揚國光中華民族、頽唐已至極點、三民主義民族主義一二三講、已爲我詳言之矣、夫國人以無自尊心、故不恥萬事趨尙歐美、殊不知我國自有偉大之國粹在也、只以知易行難之説所據服、遂使二千年來、文化毫無進展、故民族主義的敎育當遵照總理遺敎、發輝中華民族之精神、益使光大無極、每觀一般時髦國人、薰染外國習氣、中國毛筆、終年不備、而購置自來水鋼筆、即數十元亦無吝色、革履西裝、以昂爲貴、視本國貸一如　展斯爲愛國、誰之信乎、今後敎育、須注意及此、蓋學生爲智識階級中人、爲社會表率、爲未來國家主人翁、其風度氣節、在在障爲萬姓模範、未可忽視也、</p>
<p>綜上四端、得見國民自尊之風、迥非往日頽唐懦弱之足比、賴敎育之普及、皆養成國民有雪恥之决心、吾信民族主義的敎育、乃爲最連合今日國情之敎育、質言之、吾人欲圖我民新生存、則須提倡民新主義、欲提倡民新主義、則須以敎育力量、贯澈成功、敎育以民新主義爲主旨、故謂其敎育爲民族主義的敎育、吾人固知敎育早已規定爲三民主義之敎育、但曠觀實際、有名無實、轉不若以適應國情而先從事於三民主義中民族主義之敎育的實現耳、吾人深信能雪國恥者、必係民族主義的敎育、民族主義的敎育、乃具有雪恥作用的敎育、能厲行民族主義的敎育、而後國恥以雪弭、際比抗日救國聲中、感有倡行民族主義的敎育之重要、爲抒管見、以資提倡之一助末謹以民族主義的敎育成功爲祝、並希大雅有以敎之、（市淞中）</p>

<h3>新閘路大厦隙地</h3>
<p>又有四死屍</p>
<p>昨日僅掘獲一死屍</p>
<p>今日將再繼續發掘</p>
<p>修德里案已具端倪</p>
<p>王國維有重大嫌疑</p>
<p>轟動一時之共黨殺人埋屍滅跡案已先後在法租界姚主敎路愛棠村及公共租界武定路修德坊等處陸續發現、兩地共掘岀屍身十一具之多惟、據漢口拘獲之本案帮兇李龍章所供、愛棠村三十三·三十七號兩屋内、共藏埋屍身九具、刻僅發現七具、詎料該處尙在四下搜掘時、前日深夜十一時許、淞滬警備司令部又奉到南京國府急電、謂公共租界新閘路麥特赫司脱路附近民房天井中、亦被共黨潛埋屍身四具、仰即繼續掘發云云、昨晨、捕房特派員前往勘發、現已發現一具、至於武定路修德坊起岀之屍身四具、現已被公共租界捕房總稽查處緝獲本案重大嫌疑犯數人、茲將昨日新閘路掘發情形及嫌疑犯被捕經過、詳細分述如后、</p>
<p>▲國府急電續掘四死　自前日　　（二十四日）在武定路修德坊六號屋内將斯勵·葉小妹·張杏華·及張陸氏等四具屍身掘岀後、同時淞滬警備司令部於當夜又奉到南京國府急電内稱公共租界新閘路麥特赫司脱路附近民房内、亦埋有屍體四具、計二男二女一爲蘇州工藝學校學生朱完白、一爲朱完白之妻、一爲女子鄒志淑、一爲留俄學生黄弟洪等四人、以前均共產黨員、仰即會同捕房詳細搜掘、</p>
<p>▲實地查明藏屍之所　司令部奉電後、本擬翌日即行發掘因須先將埋藏地點查勘明白、方能着手、前日特派員會同捕房詳查一日結果查得該處各鄭家巷東通麥特赫司脱路、西通戈登路、南達愛文義路、北臨新閘路、一新式大厦、適位於四路之中心、依新閘路之門牌老門牌爲Ａ字九十一號、新門牌爲Ａ字一千零九十五號、大門在鄭家巷狭弄内、前有竹籬、入門數武、一大厦屹立中央、四而𨻶地甚廣屋後爲一小花圃、屍身即葬於此</p>
<p>▲開掘竟日僅獲一屍　　昨晨七時許、司令部即派員會同捕房人員率同土工十餘名、一齊趕往第一特區法院、亦派員監視八時開掘先掘中央繼及西隅、直至午後三時、尙無發現、最後至五時許、掘至東北角短垣下、深至七尺左右果然發見一蓆掀蓆而視、則赫然一屍該屍體格甚長、頭西足東週身赤裸筋肉已大半潰爛、侵風後、旋變黧黑色臭氣雖有然不若愛棠村之甚在場各員、稍加察看後復命將蓆蓋好、迨今日繼續掘岀後、一併舁至騐屍所檢騐、諸事未畢、爲時已晏當即派人看守待衆人離場已萬家燈火矣當時據中央派來之顧建忠君云該屍頗似朱完白並稱尙有一屍名黄培者、恐亦在内云、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>明嘉靖中葉。浦左如南壓·寶山·川沙·金山·　　沿海一帶。咸被倭子蹂躝迨遍。其殘酷殺掠行爲。詳載於各家筆記。書不勝書。惟我邑（南壓）防倭之勝跡最多。因當時城繼光駐兵匯角。相傳兩匯城爲戚氏所建。而一墩至十一墩。却爲防倭之鋒火墩。沿海建築。相距十里。即築墩派兵駐守之。瞭見倭船。　火爲號。互相策應。戚氏練兵極嚴。所組鴛鴦陣。以兩兵背立。各自爲戰。殺敵陷陣。鋭不可當。倭子連敗數陣。揚帆遁去。然每歲秋冬之際。復來刦掠。鄕民深惡之。乃練民團漁團以禦倭。周浦相近之倭子墳。父老相傳。咸謂爲民團所殺。遺尸遍地。聚而埤之。又有一種傳説。謂當時倭子覇佔民家。每十户令合用一切菜刀。民衆恨之入骨。假大除夕吃菜肉餛飩。灌以酒。醉而　之。掘坑以埋兩説未知孰是。惟民團漁團之外。另有僧團丐團。組僧團者爲月禪和尙。組丐團者爲邑人王某。而月禫之戰功尤著。每結隊禦敵。全仗少林拳術。以少勝多。倭子之被殺者達二千餘人。倭子啣之。迨倭子大隊來侵。大叢林無倖免者矣。丐團首領王某。頗工心計。岀奇制勝。屢著戰功。有司據情奏於朝。奉旨以補衛千户。王力辭之。遁往浦西。仍過其沿門托缽之清苦生涯。竟不願沽名釣譽。噫·如王某者。可以風矣。</p>

<h3>克虜伯之金錢觀</h3>
<p>克虜伯是德意志的犬富翁··他的財產是用他所造的大砲換來的。世界上如果有血錢的話，那末，克虜伯便可算是血錢大王了。可是在他的心裏，德意志是超過一切，金錢只佔了一個附屬的地位。歐戰前有人問他説你要這多錢幹嗎，他説我所有的都歸德意志所有。大同主義者對於他這個答案當然不能認爲满意。如果問話的人是一位大同主義者，那末，克虜伯必定是要遇到這個反問··『爲何不歸人類所有？』但是退一步看，克虜伯比着那些『我所有的只歸我所有』的人們是不是要看得遠些；國難中之中國的有錢人有没有這種眼光？這是我爲克虜伯寫的一首小詩··</p>
<p>『克虜伯丨克虜伯丨您的財寳可姓克？不消問得！一絲一忽屬父國！』（註）</p>
<p>我們别把錢看得太大了，因爲錢之上還有比錢大的事··也别把錢看得太小了，因爲錢是要用來做大事的。</p>
<p>小註··德人稱祖國爲父國</p>
<h3>救國婚約</h3>
<p>— 鷄冠</p>
<p>國難方殷。凡有血性之男子。均奮袂而起。力禦外侮。因之遠道從軍。欲執干戈以衛國士者。所在多有。余友之戚金君樹堂。亦其一焉。</p>
<p>金君爲福建之建寗人。於民十一年。東渡日本。卒業於陸軍士官學校。嘗在南粤任某師營連長等職。目撃内爭。鬱鬱不得志。嗣捨而他去。轉輾至首都。就某機關職務焉。君年事祗二十餘。在京獲一情耦。爲某中學生。亦閩人也。星期休假。輒相偕徜徉於玄武湖頭。秀山園裏。近以父母之命。速其成婚。遂借中央旅館。於前月實行其夫歸嘉禮。是時暴日侵凌。惡耗頻至。金固愛國男兒。因向其愛人作一度之商榷。婚約之上。特附一絛。大意男女成婚之後。任何方有救國行動。不得以兒女情愛之私。横生阻力。簽約之際。頗得女士之首肯。聞結婚至今。現已逾月。金君得黑省阽危之耗。（友人述時齊齊哈爾尙未陷落）首途北上。蓋已實踐婚約中之救國行動矣。據述女士樓頭望月。亦不忍夫壻之長作征夫。行將踪跡前往。俾得盡女子方面之愛國義務。若然。則夫妻從軍。固屬一時佳話。而救國婚約亦足千古矣。</p>
<h3>慷慨壯烈之杭婦女遊行大會</h3>
<p>— 朱梵彤</p>
<p>暴日入寇。東省失陷。警報傳來。舉國同憤。全國各大都市。咸先後設立抗日會。組織義勇軍。民氣激昂。曠古未有。而各地歸女界。亦多奮然興起。誓死抗日。巾幗英雄。不讓鬚眉。日前杭州各界歸女。發起婦女抗日救國大會。到有各女校。各工廠。數十餘團體。五千餘人。一時英雌畢集。憤慨激昂茲將是日演講警語。摘錄如下。</p>
<p>岳飛母親與梁夫人主席許碧筠女士之演詞。曾舉岳母與梁夫人爲勗勉。語頗剴切。其詞略謂。岳飛之母。與韓世忠夫人梁紅玉。均爲吾國歸女界之英傑。可作吾人之模範。吾輩女子。雖不能親臨戰陣。上馬殺敵。但救護之責。則義無反顧。責無旁貸。至不購日貨。更非難爲之事。吾人欲求男女平等。即應爲男子所能爲之事。負男子所能負之責云云。</p>
<p>匹夫應改作匹歸省黨部代表項定榮謂女子在法律上。社會上。敎育上。經濟上。政治上。均與男子立於同等地位。故在義務上。亦應與男子負同等之責任。我國四萬萬同胞。女子佔其半數。今當民族存亡之關鍵。女子應與男子。共負救國之責。自不待言。古人有言。國家興亡。匹夫有責。實則國家興亡。豈僅匹夫有責。今余當改其詞爲國家興亡。匹歸有責。斯語頗堪玩味。</p>
<p>花木蘭與秋瑾女士項氏復舉花木蘭與秋瑾。以爲勉勵。略謂。我國歷史中有花木蘭者。於數千年前。彼時女子猶未解放。花氏以深閨弱質。竟能喬裝男子。代父從軍。後卒獲戰功。千古傳爲美談。近則如我浙之秋瑾女士。於二十年前。即投身革命。誓志救國。後身懷利刃。行刺清室官吏。雖不幸遇難身殉。而忠勇之名。可昭千古。</p>
<p>是日。於開會畢後。整隊遊行。路中氣象嚴肅。秩序井然。其有不慣遠行者。多黄汗满面。腰　腿疲。然振作精神。一若忘其所苦也。</p>
<h3>日軍鐵蹄下之我國瀋陽學生</h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>青年學子。乃國家未來之主人翁。夫人而知。毒哉日人。居心叵測。瀋陽攻陷。知識份子。首被注目。如馮庸之被拘。即其一例。其欲摧殘我國之優秀同胞。無所不用其極。頃閲公義報。載有瀋陽歸客痛述此種情形。揮涙而譯告國人。並哀東省死難同胞。</p>
<p>日軍自佔據藩陽後。青年學生。倘遇日軍。亦不經過任何審訊手續。即處死刑。</p>
<p>大有格殺不論之勢。故被慘殺者。輒不知獲罪之由。生者目睹此種恐怖情形。中心悲痛莫可名狀。故除重要緊急事外。無不閉門家居。足不岀户。且日軍定慘律一種。計分六絛。</p>
<p>（一）服學生裝者</p>
<p>（二）髮梳西式者</p>
<p>（三）身佩自來水筆者。</p>
<p>（四）閲中國報纸者。</p>
<p>（五）携書籍者。</p>
<p>（六）三人以上同行者。</p>
<p>如具有此六絛資格之一者。即殺無赦。</p>
<p>男學生爲免去無謂之犠牲。咸化裝鄕農或苦工。避往他處。然女學生則苦矣。不問美醜。如爲日軍所獲。每先行姦污。甚且割去雙乳。以刺刀刺入陰部。故女學生若不他避。唯死而已。至華人爲日軍刺殺與槍斃者。尙爲不幸中之大幸。亦有爲日軍活埋或活焚者。或懸雙手於樑而痛毆之。日軍則在旁觀其痛苦掙扎之狀。拍手大笑。引以爲樂。痛哉。</p>
<p>華人被殺後。不得收殮及有類於照相等事。即行人亦不得注視之。一若目睹同胞被殺。須掉首疾趨以避之。否則倘爲日軍視線所及。殺身之禍立至矣。蓋日軍亦知此種慘無人道之禽獸行爲。不足爲外人道也。</p>
<h3>雄壯的文學（二）</h3>
<p>— 天疣</p>
<p>中國古代的文學作品。走雄壯的一路者。不是没有。不過很少罷了。「三百篇」中有秦風的小戎駟鐵·無衣諸篇。楚辭十九是美人香草。而却寫國殤的勇毅。山海經大部是荒誕不稽的迷信。却有后翠射日。精衛塡海。刑天舞戚。那種悲壯的寓言。這些都是先秦的著名作品。在樂府裏有鼓角横吹曲中所收的那種英勇文學。如企喻歌。析楊柳歌。瑯琊王歌。慕容垂歌。李波小妹歌。以至現在婦人孺子無不知道的木蘭。詞雖以纏綿宛轉寫兒女之情的爲多。然有辛棄疾一派。和缶飛的满江紅。詩有陸游。梁任公説他是「集中十九從軍樂。互古男兒一放翁」。不久的過去。則又有黄遵憲丨丨以上是就我所知。隨手舉來。已不少了。但徒舉些文學家的姓名與作品的題目。是無用的。試將黄遵憲的雄壯的詩歌。略加介紹於此。以示例。</p>
<p>黄遵憲字公度。清末嘉應州人。（一八四八丨丨一九○五）著有人境廬詩草十一卷。他旣有文學的天才與修養。又做過三十年的外交官。到過日本·南洋·歐美等處。所以在當時號爲知識豐富的一人。他是戊戍維新運動的一員。所以在當時很有變法圖强的志願。後來在政治上失敗了。還相借文學以轉移風俗。</p>
<p>他的集中如琉球歌越南篇臺灣行朝鮮行諸篇。於我國每次的外交失敗。都紀之以韻語。可算詩史。他的降將軍歌。聶將軍歌。度遼將軍歌。赤穗四十七義士歌諸篇。或刺怯懦。或獎忠勇。都是很好的作品。而最雄壯的。則推他作的軍歌。與學校學生相和歌。</p>
<p>我們現在且來讀他的臺灣行。因爲臺灣的往事。可作我們前車之鑑。是我們最好比照的一面鏡子。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（二十九）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄕下人吃得很爲舒服。湯碗菜碟，隻隻都顯了底。因爲天氣熱，也吃得满頭大汗。廣東堂倌，又送上兩塊手巾來。鄕下人想··那倒正用得着，情願多岀幾個錢小賬也不要緊。及至把手巾拽開來一看，他説··『不對！不對！這不是揩面的手巾，』『怎麽不是揩面的手巾呢？』廣東堂倌站在他面前説。『我們揩面的手巾，都是長方的，怎麽這是正方的呢？而且我們揩面總是用熱手巾，怎麽這又是冰凉的呢？這様方方的兩塊，你們不要拿差了什麽人的包脚布？』</p>
<p>『我們廣東館子裏，總是那様的手巾。我們是很講衛生的，你　那手巾很潔淨。現在暑天中，不宜擦熱手巾，你説是冰凉的，自然囉，我們的手巾，是在冰水裏擠過的。而且還灑上了花露水，你在鼻子上聞聞，可有那様香噴噴的包脚布嗎？』</p>
<p>廣東堂倌展開了一塊手巾，送到鄕下人的鼻子邊，鄕下人嗅了一嗅，的確有些香噴噴的。因想··上海人眞可謂不惜工本，絞兩塊手巾，也灑上了香水，我聽得説西洋人有一種香水，灑上了衣服，有好幾個月不肯退咧。不要我擦了那塊手巾，香氣浸到了我皮膚裏去，回到鄕下，被阿大的娘聞着了，以爲我在上海，軋了姘頭，那不是無端受着冤枉嗎？</p>
<p>鄕下人吃完了飯，揩好了面，算清了賬，正要起身。忽見走進幾個年紀很輕的人，穿了白衣服，白褲子，後面還有一位剪了頭髮的姑娘，穿了一件藍長衫，手裏却握着一面白布的小旗。</p>
<p>鄕下人正不曉得這班人是侑什麽來的，一進來，便向有五六位吃客的一張桌子邊去了。鄕下人張了他一雙好奇的眼睛，他也不去問人，要自已看岀這班人是做什麽來的。看了半天，果然被他看岀來了。</p>
<p>『咦！聽見人説；上海租界上是没有敲更的人，原來這話是不確的。』鄕下人自已顚頭播腦的在那裏想。</p>
<p>因爲被他發見了有一個年紀更輕的人，手裏還提了一個粗竹筒。這種粗竹筒，鄕下人是認識的，鎭上打更的阿四，也是用那様的竹筒，敲起來時，『的歷篇丨』『畢歷剝丨』其聲清脆。城裏敲更的雖然少一點，到了年夜邊，喊··『火燭小心』的畢三，還要利用那種敲更的梆咧。</p>
<h3>贈馬占山將軍</h3>
<p>— 陳柱尊</p>
<p>日寇大舉犯我黑龍江。屢爲省主席馬占山撃退。國人壯之。爰贈此詩。</p>
<p>满目河山盡涙痕。憑公招得國魂存。中華今日奇男子。不是張良是馬援。</p>
<p>貔貅坐擁各如雲。誰似將軍却倭氛。四萬萬人齊拍手。馬將軍不愧將軍。</p>
<p>馬將軍與馮公子。馮庸報國丹心總不抛。愧煞中原諸將士。只將心力殺同胞。</p>
<h3>哀齊齊哈爾之亡</h3>
<p>日寇大舉犯黑。馬占山孤軍久戰。糧盡援絕。黑省遂亡。國人哀之。爰賦此詩。</p>
<p>幾日孤城困鬥中。可憐朝議尙從容。韓亡不見張良奮。城陷空傷許遠忠。欲競生存憑氣節。敢將成敗論英雄。漢家若有中興日。麟閣應書第一功。</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<p>應用文作法講話周·樂·山·</p>
<p>陳子展編</p>
<p>文章趨於普遍的應用、這是自然的趨勢、實在、文章的使命、除了建設牠的理論、舒寫牠的情感、完成偉大的創作而外、文章放在實際的應用上去、確乎是需要的、　　讀書界有一種可笑的現象、有做起文章來下筆千言的人、郤不會寫一張契約、甚至於一封家信也寫不妥貼、丨丨這不是我張大其詞、想大家都看過這種人的、</p>
<p>讀書人不能將文章應用到社會上去、是文人的恥辱、</p>
<p>讀書人不能將文章應用到社會上去、是書獃子、</p>
<p>我們要呌岀這兩句口號來减少、社會上的書獃子、洗凈文人的恥辱、</p>
<p>在許多年以前、也曾有過許多本（應用文）岀版、但是多半偏於陳腐的俗套、不能闡發新的理論、又不能敎人如何去作應用文、讀他的書的人、結果還是一個茫然、</p>
<p>在十年以前、外復先生曾經在（新青年）上發表了一篇文章、名呌（應用文之敎授）、那時還没有什麽人注意他、近來中等學校多半在國文一門之内、分别應用文爲選修科目、師範學校還有列作必修科的、陳子展先生的（應用文作法講話）、就是應這個需要而岀版的、</p>
<p>這書便利於敎授之處、是用講義體式、丨丨這種體式最容易明瞭、凡是畢業於高級小學以及高級中學而即服務社會者、將這本書作爲臨文應用之助、眞所謂（不無裨益）吧、</p>
<p>這書所論到的範圍當然是應用文、而應用文又限於社會上通常應用的、而特别專門的、那只好歸於（公文程式）之内去没有論及、我覺得這是好的、因爲可免掉沉悶之病、</p>
<p>應用文應該如何分類、似乎事無前例、而這書確乎將門類分得井井有條、第二章到第七章、分論、公牘文、電報文、書啓文、慶弔文、聯語文、契據文六類、第八章論到規約文、題署文、廣告文三類、丨丨這種分類、可説是包舉無遺、大體具備的了、</p>
<p>現在再論到這書的主論、這書的主論、頗尙謹嚴、運用的例子旣多、而著者處處能加入自已的意見、爲論到一體、就能注意到類别、法式、得失、流源、</p>
<p>著者又能夠在他的結尾上、嚢括作法的要旨、而又不苟且、</p>
<p>編（應用文）的難處、在禮文和法令兩項丨丨</p>
<p>（一）談到禮文、要説明新舊的變化、</p>
<p>（三）談到法令、要説明時地之宜、</p>
<p>但是又不可過於説得板滯、太板滯了、令人生厭太詼諧了、又失了嚴肅之態、這書雖有詼諧之處、但始終能保持的嚴肅、</p>
<p>現在更進而論到本書的選例、</p>
<p>選例應該要有經濟的手腕因爲舉例是不能免的、但是連篇累牘的舉那一大堆、不嫌累贅嗎、</p>
<p>編（應用文）的選例、那就更難了、因爲（應用文）是文章中之最繁雜的、如果一一的舉下去、那不但讀的人厭煩、寫的人的手腕也太不經濟了、</p>
<p>這書對於以下三項、</p>
<p>公牘、</p>
<p>電報、</p>
<p>書啓、</p>
<p>有時總攏地各舉一個例子、這不但醒目、而且不損文章的流利不然、説一二兩句話、舉一個例子、眞是所謂（懶婆娘的裏脚布）了哩、</p>
<p>著者是一位歷史家、平時對於史料的搜集、無有遺漏、他就將這些史料來所（應用文作法講話）的例子、而且運用得（天衣無縫）就是會寫（應用文）的人、也可以在那裏而得着濃厚的趣味、</p>
<p>我現在且舉幾篇的標題在下面</p>
<p>余沈壽女士呈前農商部清償政府持</p>
<p>贈義國皇后繡像代價文、</p>
<p>洪深呈上海市黨部爲羅克不怕死影　　片侮辱中華民族請求禁止開映文　　敎育部致行政院秘書處爲審議以梅　　花爲國花一案擬改五朶連枝爲三　　朶連枝請查照轉陳函、</p>
<p>南京市敎育局長闢妖歸攝小兒靈魂謡言佈告、</p>
<p>山東省立第二師範學生會爲（子見南子案）通電、</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>以上所舉的幾個標題、一望而知這些例子裏面含着無窮的幽默的趣味、</p>
<p>著者在第一章内、曾説到（應用文）的重要性、他説、</p>
<p>（應用文是於實際生活上應用之文字、包括個人社會公私往來交涉應酬表白上、一切根據法律、或依從禮俗、必需應用之文字、）</p>
<p>著者又從劉勰的（文心雕龍）（書記篇）中的立論推闡開來、説明應用的特性、</p>
<p>（一·文質因宜、不拘文言俗語、　　二·隨事立體、體裁各貴精當、</p>
<p>三·字句篇要、一字不能苟且、）</p>
<p>、　、（應用文）在今日之需要、已爲顯然的事實、而（應用文作法講話）乃是應比需要而岀版的好書、謹介紹於我們的讀書界、</p>

For self-defense, the army ordered Japanese soldiers to mobilize urgently. Simultaneously, all lights in the Japanese concession were extinguished, and all power grids were electrified. Once prepared, Japanese troops opened fire with machine guns from their barracks. At 9:30 PM, over 300 plainclothes troops were discovered in the southeast corner. At 9:50 PM, the Japanese army opened fire with cannons from the sixth floor of the Zhongyuan Company, Haiguang Temple, and Zhakou, firing a total of over 60 shells in half an hour.

<h3>Dohihara Returns to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Organizing an Assassination Squad to Assassinate Important Party and Government Figures</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Dohihara has come to Tianjin for the second time, residing in the Tokiwa Hotel under the alias Yamada, recently changing it to Nakamura. He has been very active recently. It is rumored that Puyi's conditions for restoration are: (1) Recognition from European and American countries; (2) Support from genuine popular will. Japan feels that his conditions are difficult to meet and is no longer forcing Puyi's restoration. This is what Dohihara told the Japanese in Tianjin. Dohihara is organizing an assassination squad in Tianjin to assassinate important party and government figures. He has formed 24 teams, each with five members, each given a pistol, ten bullets, and an electric knife. Each person is given travel expenses of 100 to 150 yuan. Most are Japanese and Korean ruffians. They have already departed in the past two days, heading to Cangzhou, Jinan, Tai'an, and other places. Many names are listed on the reward list, with rewards ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 Japanese yen for killing one person. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>Passes Draft Resolution</p>
<p>Troop Withdrawal and Investigation Handled Separately</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Proposes Establishing a Neutral Zone in Jinzhou</p>
<p>Briand Cables Chinese and Japanese Governments to Cease Fire</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Declares Willingness to Cooperate with the League of Nations</p>
<p>Public Meeting Scheduled for Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, the League of Nations Council held a meeting. Chinese and Japanese representatives did not attend. Afterwards, the Council passed a resolution to send a commission to Manchuria for investigation. Council Chairman Briand later cabled the Chinese and Japanese governments, requesting a complete ceasefire. The Council meeting was held at 5:10 PM and was extremely secret, unprecedented since the Manchurian incident. Except for the representatives, even secretaries and experts were not allowed to enter the room, as the intention was to consider the Chinese proposal in absolute secrecy. British Foreign Secretary Cecil was in London, so Sir Eric Drummond attended as the British representative. At the meeting, the Japanese instructions had not yet arrived in Paris, so the Council only had the guarantees already issued by Yoshizawa. The Council held secret talks for half an hour, then summoned experts into the room, and adjourned at 7:20 PM. It is heard that although the commission proposal was passed by all twelve members of the Council, several members added a caveat, stating that their acceptance of the proposal was conditional on both China and Japan also accepting it. If one disagreed, they reserved the right to request that the proposal be redrafted. In summary, this proposal cannot be considered immutable. The Council's proposal is in the nature of a draft plan to handle the Japanese troop withdrawal and the dispatch of a commission separately. The main points of the plan are as follows: (1) The Council recalls the resolution of September 30 and reaffirms it. Since both sides have stated that they are bound by this resolution, both governments are requested to take all necessary measures to ensure the implementation of this resolution, so that the Japanese troop withdrawal to the South Manchurian Railway zone, which the Council considers most important, can be realized. Both sides undertake to issue the strictest instructions to their troops to avoid any action that could cause war or loss of life, and to implement all necessary plans to avoid aggravating the situation. Council members who have information from local representatives are requested to provide this information to the Council. (2) The Council proposes to send a commission to conduct on-the-spot research and report to the Council on any situation that could endanger international relations, disrupt peace between China and Japan, or the good understanding on which peace between China and Japan depends. China and Japan can each participate in this commission with one assessor. The dispatch of this commission will in no way hinder the Japanese government's existing commitment and the commitment contained in the September 30 resolution to withdraw Japanese troops to the railway area. Later, the Council discussed the Chinese representative's report on the serious situation in Jinzhou, requesting the dispatch of troops and police. After repeated discussions, it was decided that each country could send its own personnel to inspect, but the personnel sent would not represent the Council. Regarding this matter, the British delegation has informed the League of Nations Secretary-General that the British Minister in Beiping, Lampson, telegraphed on November 22 that he had arranged for the British military attaché and others to go to Jinzhou and its vicinity immediately, and could arrange for British observers to go to Qiqihar and Ang'angxi. The Council is scheduled to hold a secret meeting again at 4:00 PM on the 26th. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the League of Nations Secretary-General released a document from Dr. Shi Zhaoji proposing the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou, stating: "I have just received the most urgent news that the Japanese army is advancing towards Jinzhou, disregarding its guarantees of non-aggression. Therefore, a serious conflict between China and Japan, which China is eager to avoid, is about to occur. Only immediate and decisive action by the Council can prevent the disaster of war. The Chinese government now requests the Council to quickly find a way to establish a neutral zone between the current positions of the Chinese and Japanese armies, guarded by neutral troops from Britain, France, Italy, and other countries under the auspices of the Council. Then, if the Council requests China to withdraw its troops within the border, China can withdraw them for the sake of peace." Dr. Shi also reported that on November 22, bandits attacked Xinmin but were driven back. Subsequently, Japanese aircraft came and dropped bombs, and three Japanese armored trains arrived there. The Japanese claimed that there were plainclothes soldiers hidden in the city, but the bandits actually came from the east. After this was proven, the Japanese withdrew. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the League of Nations Council members continued private consultations. It is expected that China and Japan will present their views on the draft resolution proposed by the Council at the public meeting on Saturday. According to League of Nations officials, (1) Although the Council's resolution may not completely satisfy China, China probably cannot gain more than this if it rejects it. (2) The issue of direct negotiations between China and Japan is no longer a question within the Council. (3) The resolution to establish an international commission of inquiry has overturned Japan's initial insistence that the dispute in the three eastern provinces is purely a matter between China and Japan. Therefore, it is anticipated that China may accept it. China's reply to the Council's recent draft resolution has not yet arrived in Paris. According to the Chinese delegation, it will arrive at the earliest tonight. As soon as Dr. Shi receives it, he will forward it to Briand, and it will likely be sent to the Council on Friday. The Chinese delegation has already announced to</p>
<p>Everyone declared the seven points sent to the Council on Wednesday, clarifying China's position, but did not mention the recently proposed resolution. The Chinese representative did not pay much attention to the declaration of the US representative, Dawes. Dr. Shi said that the United States had not accepted this resolution, and the general plan referred to by Ambassador Dawes was vague and not binding. (National News Agency dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council is tentatively scheduled to hold a public meeting tomorrow to announce the results of the discussion. The Council's attempt shows that it anticipates that there will be no major obstacles in the negotiations on sending a commission to Manchuria, which are currently being concluded. If tomorrow's meeting proceeds smoothly, it will be the final meeting of the Council, which will not consider the matter further until it receives the commission's report. There is little doubt that Japan will accept the Council's resolution, although the Japanese government has reservations, but only formally, not substantively, on the point of "issuing the strictest instructions to its troops to avoid any action that could cause new incidents." As for China, the situation is still slightly more difficult. It is not yet known what steps the new acting Foreign Minister Gu Weijun and the Nanjing government will take. However, the United States has endorsed the Council's proposal and is urging China and Japan to accept it. This action may prompt the Chinese government to recognize it. Council members have different opinions on the path the Council should take if this proposal is rejected by both or either party. It is heard that the representatives of Poland, Yugoslavia, and Norway will advocate not only recognizing the Council's inability to handle this matter, but at present it is hoped that such a discussion will not be necessary. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji sent an urgent document to Briand, informing him that there was about to be a serious conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in Jinzhou. Thereupon, the twelve Council members immediately convened a meeting. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese representatives attended. The meeting was very secret, and even the interpreters were dismissed. All the Council members spoke in French. It is heard that the smaller countries are all determined to support China, while the larger countries have a cold attitude. A special commissioner was also dispatched to report on the progress of the meeting to the US Ambassador Dawes, who was waiting for news at the hotel. When the secret meeting was over, Dawes immediately announced that he would meet with newspaper representatives. Soon, dozens of journalists rushed to the Ritz Hotel, where each received a brief notice from Dawes, stating that the US government supports the general plan in the League of Nations Council's proposed resolution to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute, and has notified China and Japan of the US support, urging them to accept this general plan, etc., in order to show that the United States will have the closest cooperation with the League of Nations, hoping to make a final effort to resolve the Manchurian incident. Dawes also declared that the US government formally endorses the resolution drafted by the Council, which advises Japan to withdraw its troops as quickly as possible and sends a commission to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute. After Dawes met with journalists and announced the US attitude, the Council also issued a communiqué declaring that the Council had drafted a plan to handle the troop withdrawal and the dispatch of a commission separately, and had notified the Chinese and Japanese governments of the contents. To summarize, the draft resolution largely reaffirmed the</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Strengthening Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Our country has lost its diplomatic functions entirely in recent years, rendering it unable to fulfill its responsibility as the eyes, ears, and mouth of the government. We have already spoken about this repeatedly and emphatically. Now that the new acting Foreign Minister Gu Weijun has been appointed during a time of crisis and has already officially taken office and begun his duties yesterday, we mourn the mistakes of the past and wish to again sincerely offer our views.</p>
<p>Today's international arena is full of treacherous clouds and unpredictable waves, changing in an instant. For a country standing in a world of competing powers to be without eyes and ears to capture the hidden feelings of various countries, and without a mouth and tongue to transmit its own will, it is almost as if we are unrelated to the world. It is simply impossible to achieve the effectiveness of negotiation and to associate with other countries.</p>
<p>In recent years, our country has placed too much emphasis on propaganda in diplomacy and has not sought practical results. We will not discuss the past for now, but as of today, the international situation is cloudy and we are a party involved. The crisis before us relies on international activities to a great extent, but in various important and powerful countries, ambassadors are still vacant. Qian Yongming, the Minister to France, has repeatedly resigned. Jiang Zuobin, the Minister to Germany, has been transferred to Japan, but although Liu Wendao has been formally appointed, he is busy between Hunan and Hubei and has not yet left. The post of Minister to the United States has been vacant for half a year since Wu Chaoshu returned to the country. Although Yan Huijing has been appointed, it is only now that he is preparing to take office. Minister to Italy Guo Taiqi was originally assigned to take the position, but Guo has not yet assumed his duties. Today, only a chargé d'affaires is stationed in Rome. People like the Minister to the Netherlands Jin Wensi and the Minister to Belgium Chuan Chengchang, although they have the title of minister, have not taken a single step out of the country. At this time of urgent crisis, it is time for those who have diplomatic responsibilities to actively engage, but what is presented before our eyes today is this kind of indifferent phenomenon, causing the government's eyes and ears to lose their sharpness, its mouth and tongue to lose their effectiveness, its functions to stagnate, and its information to be cut off. We can only watch Tokyo's diplomatic strategies unfolding, with Ubuchi in the United States, Matsudaira in Britain, Yoshida in Italy, and Yoshizawa in France, acting like lively dragons and tigers, active on the international stage, while we only have one Shi Zhaoji performing a solo act in front of the League of Nations. How can we use this to fight for diplomatic victory and win the sympathy of the international community? Is revolutionary diplomacy really like this? This is truly something that we cannot understand no matter how hard we try.</p>
<p>Now that Gu Weijun has officially assumed the post of acting Foreign Minister, learning from the past and being cautious in the future, we deeply hope that he can pay attention to strengthening the functions of diplomacy. First, he should immediately select appropriate talent and appoint ambassadors to various countries. Second, he should urge those who have already been appointed to take office within a limited time. Third, he should allocate the funds for embassies stationed in various countries and not begrudge these essential expenses that hinder their activities. Fourth, he should provide them with a direction for their activities and sincerely urge them to develop. First, make their eyes and ears keen and their mouths and tongues active, bringing them to life. Only then can we talk about diplomacy. Only then can we compete with the powers on the stage of international politics.</p>
<h3>National Urgent Telegrams</h3>
<p>The resolution requests both countries to take all necessary steps regarding the implementation of troop withdrawal orders. Both sides must issue the strictest orders to their commanding officers to prohibit any accidental events causing loss of life. It also requests all directors to provide all possible reports. The Council will send an investigation committee to investigate the dispute on-site, report to the Council, and investigate the circumstances affecting international relations or endangering peace between China and Japan. China and Japan should each send an observer to join the committee. The authority and work of the committee will not hinder the promise that Japanese troops should withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway zone. This promise was issued by the Japanese government and recorded in the September 30 resolution. Although the Japanese government's reply to the Council's draft resolution has not yet been delivered to the Secretariat, according to the spokesman of the Japanese delegation, Japan still adheres to its original position regarding troop withdrawal based on the September 30 resolution and the safety of Japanese residents. It seems that a deadlock has formed during the meeting of the twelve directors at 5:15 PM today to study China's reply. At that time, a senior official of the League of Nations said that if the Council could not mediate further, it was feared that there would be severe actions. (National News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, according to the spokesman of the Chinese delegation, China's reply and the explanatory note attached by Chief Representative Shi stated that the dispatched committee should be a neutral observer and must not be considered an excuse to delay troop withdrawal. It also declared China's legal status, questioned Japan's right to expand occupied areas, described the past advances of Japanese troops, warned of the current crisis, and urged all countries to respect their guarantees. It is heard that after Briand announced China's reply, smaller countries such as Yugoslavia, Poland, Spain, Venezuela, and Peru jointly supported China,</p>

<p>believing that the actions of the major powers would set a bad precedent. As a result, the Council was divided into two factions. The progress of events surrounding the League of Nations has been kept secret for the past ten days. Dr. Shi's decision to publish China's reply can be seen as a change of strategy. The union of small countries into one faction is extremely beneficial to China. Its intention is to remind the League of Nations of its obligations to small countries and to challenge the hegemony of the major powers, which is the result of the ruthless attitude of the major powers in the past ten days, making all small countries feel insecure. Therefore, during today's Council meeting, the situation has forced the League of Nations to take action, so the meeting was very secret. Even the confidential staff and interpreters were asked to leave the meeting room. Each director agreed to speak French. According to Briand, China's reply has about seven key points: (1) Request to cease hostilities; (2) Request for Japanese troop withdrawal; (3) Declaration that China is willing to guarantee the safety of Japanese residents in the three eastern provinces; (4) Proposal for cooperation between China, Japan, and neutral countries to determine methods to ensure the welfare and safety of Japanese residents and their lives and property; (5) Request for China and Japan to respect the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (6) Sending an investigation committee to monitor troop withdrawal and determine the compensation China should receive; (7) Proposal to convene an international conference of neutral countries related to the three eastern provinces after the Japanese troops withdraw to finally resolve various issues between China and Japan regarding the three eastern provinces. Today's secret meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM. It is expected that a secret meeting will be held again at 4:00 PM tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji told the Associated Press today that the only path China can rely on at this time is to invoke Articles 10 and 16 of the Covenant, which stipulate punitive measures, namely, imposing economic sanctions on Japan. These punitive measures are solemnly guaranteed to be fulfilled by the fifty-four countries that signed the Covenant. (National News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council today issued a warning to the Chinese and Japanese governments to prevent the realization of a conflict between the Chinese and Japanese troops in Jinzhou. The telegram was sent by French Foreign Minister Briand in the name of the President of the League of Nations Council to Nanjing and Tokyo, requesting both governments not to take any further military actions that would increase the difficulty for the League of Nations, which is seeking to resolve the Manchurian incident. The motivation for Briand's urgent telegram was that Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji had previously sent an emergency report to the Council stating that Japanese troops had concentrated in Jinzhou and requested the Council to immediately take measures to prevent the conflict. At the same time, British representative Cecil also suggested that members of the League of Nations Council should independently telegraph the Chinese and Japanese governments to stop the act of war. Therefore, the governments of various member states have also independently telegraphed Nanjing and Tokyo to stop military actions, and several countries have independently dispatched inspectors to Jinzhou to investigate. Cecil also sent a note to the Council, stating that the British Minister to China, Lampson, had dispatched the military attaché of the embassy to Jinzhou in the near future, and that when necessary in the future, British inspectors could advance to Qiqihar and Angangxi. After receiving the news of the crisis in Jinzhou, the Chinese delegation immediately lodged a serious protest with the Council, and the Council immediately convened an emergency secret meeting. The Chinese protest stated that if the Japanese army was allowed to encircle Jinzhou, China's last foothold in Manchuria would be lost. The text questioned the Council, asking whether the Council would allow the Japanese to use force against the Chinese army inside and outside the Great Wall. Although China has requested the deployment of foreign troops in Jinzhou, it is heard that the Council advocates deploying troops as neutral observers, responsible for monitoring the neutral zone, without interfering with the South Manchurian Railway or managing the area around Jinzhou. If neutral countries believe that Japan's expanding power poses a threat to their interests, they can act independently, but the Council has not yet taken any action regarding the dispatch of troops. What China is requesting from the Council today is to immediately deploy a joint force of American, British, French, and Italian troops in Jinzhou. In addition, foreign troops stationed in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin according to treaties should gather and station at key points to prevent the Japanese army from continuing to occupy Chinese territory. It is heard that after Dawes received this news, he expected the Council to ask him to state the United States' position on this matter, so he immediately reported to the Washington government for instructions. Yoshizawa also met with Dawes to oppose the concentration of Chinese troops in Jinzhou, while guaranteeing that Japanese troops would never attack Jinzhou. He also sent a letter to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, stating that the claim of a Japanese army attack on Jinzhou was completely untrue. (National News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Japanese representative spoke with the Japanese government via wireless telephone before dawn today, receiving Japan's instructions on the draft resolution prepared by the Council. According to the spokesman of the Japanese delegation, the Japanese government's attitude is quite favorable to the resolution. It is expected that private negotiations will begin again today in order to obtain a satisfactory proposal. The amendments proposed by the Japanese government will not change the important conditions of the resolution. It is heard that the Japanese insist that Section 4 of the resolution, regarding "ordering the commanding officers of China and Japan to prohibit unilaterally initiating accidents that could cause loss of life," be amended to "Commanding officers are permitted to take military action if the troops are attacked by bandits." According to the spokesman of the Japanese delegation, Japan cannot agree to setting a date for troop withdrawal. (National News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) China requested three things from the Executive Yuan: (1) Immediately take effective measures to stop the Japanese military's acts of aggression. The Executive Yuan replied that it had made requests to Tokyo and Nanjing, and the original text has been published today; (2) The withdrawal of Japanese troops should be monitored by representatives of neutral countries. Foreign observers have already been sent, so China can rest assured; (3) Setting a deadline for troop withdrawal could not be accepted because all consultations since the 15th would be invalidated as a result. Moreover, the consultations involved not only the two parties concerned, but also the United States. According to the recent opinions expressed by the United States government, China has no hope of obtaining satisfactory results. After careful consideration, the Executive Yuan felt that its final proposals could no longer make progress and would fail completely, which would have extremely bad consequences, being unfavorable to both China and the League of Nations. Therefore, it is generally hoped that China will think deeply and far-sightedly, and, in view of the League of Nations' resolution and the cool attitude of Washington and Moscow, will ultimately unite with the members of the Executive Yuan. Shi Zhaoji has asked Nanjing for instructions tonight. A member of the Executive Yuan made a clever analogy, saying that, in the current situation, the Nanjing government's expectations of the League of Nations are somewhat overzealous. The League of Nations is like an international bank, and its members are its depositors. The bank is experiencing fluctuations and illiquidity in the world, and can only return 30% of the deposits to the depositors. If they refuse, it would be unwise. If the Nanjing government does not accept the resolution of the Executive Yuan, its representative should refuse to vote during the vote. In this way, the resolution can still maintain its legal and spiritual value, and the Executive Yuan can immediately appoint an investigation team and send it there. The general impression is that the Executive Yuan has reached the end of its term, and it should be dissolved by the end of this week. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese political world expressed its satisfaction upon hearing Shi Zhaoji's proposal to withdraw the Chinese army outside the customs into the customs and establish a neutral zone. However, it is considered absolutely unacceptable for foreign troops to take charge of the police force in this neutral zone. The Japanese government will respond to Briand's text requesting a complete ceasefire between China and Japan. The text will state that if the Chinese army in Jinzhou does not take aggressive action, the Japanese army does not want to attack the city, and will reiterate that the Japanese government is willing to accept the draft resolution of the League of Nations, provided that the minor amendments and reservations proposed by Japan are adopted, that is, the second article should recognize that battles necessary to protect Japanese people from bandit attacks are not excluded. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Regarding Shi Zhaoji's proposal to establish a neutral zone between the Chinese and Japanese armies, with foreign troops taking charge of police duties in the area, foreign authorities here believe that deploying troops is difficult to do. In addition to the danger of the troops being drawn into the war, the small number of foreign troops currently stationed in North China each have their own tasks and cannot be spared to take on this role.

<h3>Russian Newspaper Criticizes the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) This morning, the Communist Party's organ newspaper, Pravda, commented on the new compromise plan put forward by the League of Nations Council, saying that it was only to deceive the public and that the Council could not actually resolve the dispute because the imperialist countries were in conflicting positions. Japan is preparing to annex northern China alone, with the tacit support of the French. The French want to use Japan to control the United States, but the United States and Britain are not. Although they do not oppose the policy of enslaving and plundering China, they strongly oppose Japan's exclusive share of the spoils. Therefore, the imperialist countries will check each other until one side yields. (National News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>United States States Its Position</h3>
<p>Believes That Convening the Nine-Power Conference Is Not Yet Necessary</p>
<p>Willing to Participate in Taking Effective Measures Against Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) An important figure in the United States government declared today that the United States' opinion on resolving the Sino-Japanese Manchurian issue is completely the same as that of the League of Nations. The rumor that the United States and the League of Nations have different opinions is untrue. At the same time, Dawes also made a similar statement in Paris. As for the rumor that the United States is unwilling to take action against Japan jointly with the League of Nations, it has also been denied by the authorities in Washington. Not only does the United States not intend to break with the League of Nations, but it is also quite willing to join when the League of Nations takes effective measures to deal with Japan in the future, so as to achieve the effectiveness of economic blockade and other methods. Furthermore, the saying that Britain and the United States have reached a special understanding on the Manchurian incident is not taken seriously by the US State Department and the British Embassy in the United States. US Secretary of State Stimson and other senior officials have not yet made any explicit statements on the Manchurian issue, but they have clearly stated that it is still too early to convene a conference of signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue. The United States currently has no plans to convene a conference. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government has endorsed the resolution passed yesterday by the League of Nations Council and has advised the Chinese and Japanese governments to accept it. Reuters learned today that the U.S. government is prepared to support sending personnel to Manchuria to investigate, without considering the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and has decided that the United States may send personnel to participate in this committee. However, the U.S. representatives will serve the State Department in a purely private capacity. Reports from the Far East officialdom have convinced Stimson that in many places the withdrawal of Japanese troops could result in disturbances. According to those responsible, the U.S. government's position is that the investigation team must begin its work only after hostilities have ceased. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The government's indecision on the Manchurian dispute has led to inconsistent public opinion trends. The majority opinion is that the United States should not intervene effectively, so as to advance in tandem with the actions of the League of Nations, especially the economic pressure that the League of Nations may take, which is opposed by Bora and the Senate. Although newspapers have published some articles advocating severe treatment, public opinion does not seem to be fully formed. President Hoover may not be able to firmly preside over it. In addition, with the election approaching, the government is content with inaction, and the commercial interests of the United States and Japan are also very important, so they cannot help but be cautious. According to semi-official news from the State Department, the government cannot take coercive measures without the prior permission of the Senate. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates the Eastern Provinces Incident</h3>
<p>(London) The debate in the House of Commons today on the Manchurian incident was lively. Foreign Secretary Simon attended and was greeted with cheers. Labour MP Pyefinch asked whether the government supported the Japanese proposal to send an investigation team to Manchuria. Simon replied that on November 21, the Japanese representative proposed that the League of Nations Council should send a committee to investigate Manchuria and various parts of China, but that this committee should not interfere with direct Sino-Japanese negotiations or the military actions of either party. The Chinese representative replied at the time that he could not accept the committee without knowing the details. Other members of the Council, including Britain, unanimously supported the idea of sending a committee. The British government is now actively cooperating with other members of the Council to bring the two sides closer together in order to seek a solution. Pyefinch asked, wouldn't the League of Nations' failure to declare anti-Japan cause great damage to the credibility of the League of Nations? Simon replied that the actions of the Council are the same as the actions of any other impartial group, and must be carried out on the basis of hearing statements from both sides. He hoped that it was too early to say that the actions of the League of Nations had failed. Pyefinch also asked, isn't Japan, which suggested the investigation team, now taking hostile actions in Manchuria, occupying the entire three eastern provinces? Labour's Attlee also said that this was a very important matter. In terms of the League of Nations Covenant, isn't the League of Nations now abandoning its position? Simon replied that he also recognized that this was a very important matter. One of the things being considered in Paris now is the appropriate form of the proposal to safeguard the League of Nations' position. Labour leader Lansbury said that China and Japan were still at war and that Japan was now effectively ruling Manchuria. Could Foreign Secretary Simon represent Britain and inform Japan of Britain's feelings about this matter? Simon replied that he was very pleased that the countries attending the Council would exert their best forces in a united or consistent manner. Lansbury then announced that he would discuss the Manchurian incident before the House of Commons adjourned tonight. The Foreign Secretary said that he had not heard of any British lives or property being damaged as a result of the disturbance in Manchuria, and that there was no need to take special measures at this time, but that the situation was being monitored and any practical actions would be taken if necessary. The principle of opening the door to international trade in Manchuria is guaranteed by the Nine-Power Treaty, which the British government attaches great importance to. When the motion to adjourn the House of Commons was moved, Lansbury raised the Manchurian issue, referring to Japan's serious decision to insist on direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, saying that Japan's move directly denied the League of Nations Council the power to substantively handle the Sino-Japanese dispute. If the League of Nations does not uphold its principles, Japan will be able to do in Manchuria what it has already done in Korea. If so, the credibility of the League of Nations will plummet, and the failure of the League of Nations will be a great victory for Japanese militarist imperialism. If Japan succeeds in resolving the dispute by military means, how can it be persuaded the world not to use the same method in serious disputes? He did not mean that it was already the time for punishment, but he should apply Article 15 of the Covenant, which stipulates the observance of the Council's resolution. He hoped that Foreign Secretary Simon could inform China and Japan, declaring that Britain will always be its friend, but even if it is certain that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is impossible, the Manchurian war must be stopped. Britain should inform any government that does not respect the League of Nations Covenant that its existing relations cannot continue. Simon replied that Lansbury's discussion of the matter was not overly激昂, which was admirable. Lansbury's statement that the League of Nations upholds the principle that all countries, regardless of the merits of the case, must submit their disputes to arbitration, he expressed agreement. When he was in Paris to see Briand, whenever private discussions were held and the Chinese representative was not present, he was cautious and did not make remarks that would offend China. He followed this principle when the Japanese representative was not present. Simon then described in detail the history of Manchuria since Japan inherited Russia's rights, and the circumstances that led to the current crisis. Simon also continued to describe the League of Nations' efforts to reconcile the dispute, saying that the committee being discussed should not be any reason to delay the early withdrawal of Japanese troops. Japan has not withdrawn its commitment to withdraw troops as soon as possible. There is much debate about the truth of the situation in Manchuria, so there is a need for an international tool to investigate the truth. Lansbury then asked the House not to debate further and hoped that Simon would go to Paris immediately. The debate ended here. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Foreigners Inspect the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Praising the Trenches Built by Ma Bu</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Qualified observers who have traveled to northern Manchuria recently arrived here. They laughed off the rumor that General Ma Zhanshan had received Soviet assistance in the recent war of resistance against Japan. According to the Japanese military authorities here, they have never obtained direct evidence of this matter. They collected scattered evidence and pointed out that the Soviet Union had helped Ma fight. These foreign observers have traveled to Manchuria, Qiqihar, and Angangxi, and inspected the trenches built by Ma Bu before the great battle on November 18, but have never obtained any evidence of Soviet assistance to Ma. Perhaps the Soviet Union had sold inferior war products to Ma Zhanshan, but even this cannot be found any evidence. Only Chinese soldiers and a few Han-Mongol people were in Ma's camp and trenches. There are indeed many of these people in Heilongjiang Province. According to experts, the trenches built by Ma's army south of Angangxi are very well-made and can almost be called the first masterpiece of the Chinese army. Unfortunately, the exits face the enemy army, not the sides, which destroys the entire effort. This is a big mistake. Excellent trenches have also been built north of the Middle Eastern Railway and the Qiqihar railway station near Angangxi, but the Chinese soldiers did not defend this section of the trenches after retreating.

<h3>Japanese Invasion of Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>Reasons for Soviet Russia's Tolerance</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union will take no action on the Japanese army's invasion of northern Manchuria, the occupation of Angangxi, and the appointment of pro-Japanese figures as the administrative head of Heilongjiang Province. Russian officials in Harbin said that even if Japan takes another step, and the Japanese military warlords do have intentions to provoke Russia, Moscow will not change its current policy of inaction. It seems that the Russian officialdom is focusing its full energy on operating its so-called five-year plan, and has no time to take care of the Far East incident. The life of the Moscow government depends on the success of the five-year plan. The strength of the Soviet government can only be relied on by the support of the Red Army after the success of Russia's industrialization plan and the establishment of a solid position for the Soviet Union. If a large army is sent to the Manchurian border to fight with Japan for northern Manchuria, the collapse of the Moscow government may not be avoided. Moreover, the Siberian army is not currently able to compete with the well-equipped Japanese in the shortest time, so it is especially impossible to take this risk. That is why Russia has finally adopted an attitude of not paying much attention to the very important changes in the four eastern provinces. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japan Discredits the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Those who arrive here today will see that the League of Nations has no more dignity in the eyes of the Japanese residents here. Every Japanese store has anti-League of Nations slogans posted on it, even to the point of covering the glass windows so that the goods inside the windows can hardly be seen. Japan is a permanent member of the League of Nations, and its people are so critical of the League of Nations. Isn't it strange? (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Patriotic Enthusiasm of Non-Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Manila Today, the Overseas Chinese in this place held a national salvation conference, which lasted for five days. The three thousand attendees made extremely激烈的 speeches, all advocating a declaration of war against Japan. The purpose of this meeting is to raise 5 million pesos from the Philippine Overseas Chinese to help the motherland's war expenses. This recruits young Chinese to enlist in the army. The Chinese Consul also attended the meeting and gave a speech, which was the most moderate among the others, saying that the League of Nations and the non-war pact have not been effective in the Sino-Japanese negotiations. China is the country of the Chinese, and it must be saved by the Chinese themselves. The League of Nations has lost its effectiveness as a peace organization in this great test. The people of the country cannot rely on the League of Nations to have a fair solution. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

An American reporter was only able to meet Puwei after repeatedly requesting it over a period of two weeks and through the mediation of powerful people. However, Puwei was under Japanese surveillance and was not allowed to express his opinions. All questions were answered by the Japanese advisor. (Special telegram, 26th)</p>

We and others share the same hatred and will act as your rear support. We are sending one million silver dollars to assist with military needs and comfort the soldiers. We are organizing a wounded soldier rescue team, which will soon rush to the front lines to face the national crisis. We hereby inform you of this matter." The Women's Comfort Association, Soong Mei-ling, etc., also telegraphed the wives of governors and mayors of all provinces, saying: "The Japanese invaders are rampant, attacking our Northeast. Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, and Heilongjiang is in grave danger. Wherever the enemy's advance reaches, blood flows for thousands of miles. The borderlands have been lost, shaking the Divine Land. This is truly a critical juncture for our nation's survival. General Ma Zhanshan is defending the nation with a lone army, fighting for the dignity of the people. His righteous bravery touches the clouds and inspires national pride. We must share weal and woe, and we have a responsibility to act. How can we bear to sit idly by? In addition to raising funds to comfort the soldiers on the front lines, we are organizing a wounded soldier rescue team. Preparations are almost complete, and we will depart soon to provide rescue. However, medical supplies and other items require substantial funds, and we still rely on the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone to assist in the process. We have always admired your patriotic zeal, Madam and Ladies. We hope you will contribute generously, widely solicit donations, and provide timely assistance to support the military needs and boost the morale of the soldiers. This matter concerns the salvation of the nation, and we earnestly pray for your help. As we send this telegram, our thoughts are with you, and we await your favorable reply." (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wan Fulin and Others Arrive in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wan Fulin and Bao Wenwei arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 20th, carrying Zhang Xueliang's orders. They went to the headquarters to meet with Chiang [Kai-shek] to report everything. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen hosted a banquet for Wan Fulin and Bao Wenwei at his private residence on the afternoon of the 26th, and invited Dai Jitao, Gu Weijun, Liu Zhe, and others to accompany them. Wan and Bao gave a detailed account of the continued and incessant atrocities of the Japanese army. At 6:30 p.m., they met with Chiang [Kai-shek] to report on the latest situation in the Northeast and discuss important plans. After leaving, they visited Song Ziwen to discuss financial issues in North China. They plan to meet with Chiang again on the 27th and return to Peiping that evening to report on their mission. Xiong Shihui and Cao Haosen will be ordered to accompany them north. According to Bao, after the Japanese army occupied Heihe, they urgently sought to invade Rehe and Jinzhou. Recently, they occupied Xinmin and fabricated rumors that we were increasing troops outside the pass, as a pretext for attacking Jinzhou. The situation will become more and more serious in the future. Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang sent us to Nanjing to ask for instructions. As for the rumors that we are here to welcome Chairman Chiang to Peiping, Chiang's trip to the north has always been the unanimous desire of the Deputy Commander and the people of the whole country. However, the actions of the head of state are related to major plans. When he will depart is not something we can predict. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang sent a Ford plane to Nanjing this morning to welcome Chiang Kai-shek to the north. Some say it is to pick up Wan Fulin and Bao Wenwei to return to Peiping.

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Students Gather at National Government in Nanjing and Shanghai Yesterday to Petition</h3>
<p>Yu Youren Received Them, Dissatisfied with Long Wait, Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>Capital City Schools Held a Grand Rally to See off Commander-in-Chief Chiang</p>
<p>Chiang Addressed Students from Shanghai, Suzhou and Wuxi at Central Military Academy</p>
<p>Government Secretary-General Issued a Statement Urging Students Not to Be Used</p>
<p>Students Still Remained at the National Government at 2 AM This Morning, Refusing to Leave</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A delegation of about 2,000 male and female students from various universities in Shanghai, organized by the United Group to Urge the Government to Send Troops Against Japan, went to the National Government in Nanjing at 10:00 a.m. on the 26th to petition. Chiang was addressing a petition group from secondary schools in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi at the Central Military Academy. Therefore, Yu Youren appeared to receive them. First, the delegation led all the students in chanting slogans: (1) Urge the government to send troops; (2) Punish Zhang Xueliang; (3) Support General Ma Zhanshan; (4) Recover lost territory by force; (5) Withdraw from the League of Nations; (6) Reject the League of Nations investigation team; (7) Implement revolutionary diplomacy; (8) Promote a unified government; (9) All Chinese people unite as one; (10) Down with Japanese imperialism; (11) Long live the Republic of China. After the chanting, Yu took the stage to speak, saying that at this critical moment, the students had spared no effort to travel from afar, displaying a sincere patriotic spirit and a steadfast and unwavering attitude, demanding that the government send troops to resist the enemy. Anyone with a heart would be moved. The government has a responsibility to defend the country and its people. How can it be ignored? The government is in a precarious and shaky period, in a dilemma. It believes that the foreign policy must be based on internal cohesion and unity as a prerequisite. Members of the government have resolved to spare no sacrifice to achieve the great unity of the entire party, so as to avoid disintegration and increase political power and consolidate the foundation of the country. This is the most important work of the first step, which must be completed in the shortest possible time, so as to devote all our efforts to fighting the national crisis. The government's policy towards Japan is that, no matter how the situation in the League of Nations changes, it will insist that the Japanese army completely withdraw from the occupied areas in the three northeastern provinces in the shortest possible time, and there must be absolutely no concessions or sacrifices. The government's firm commitment to upholding the League of Nations Covenant, the Pact of Paris, and the Nine-Power Treaty must be reported to the students in order to reassure them. In this serious period, there may be aspects of the government's work that are not understood by the students. However, we must pledge to be sincere, diligent, and hardworking, and we are willing to accept all reasonable demands with an open mind, and so on. At this time, the petition group believed that the issue of sending troops required a personal response from Chairman Chiang in order to get to the point. The delegation decided that they would all wait at the National Government. At 4:00 p.m., the Anti-Japanese Associations of various schools in the capital also went to the National Government to join them, and they had not dispersed until 6:30 p.m. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The petition group from various universities in Shanghai and the petition group joined by various schools in the capital had not left the National Government as of 11:00 p.m. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Youren appeared again at 1:00 a.m. this morning, addressing the students. The petitioning students insisted that Chairman Chiang must personally come to the National Government to meet with them and agree in person, and sign it in his own handwriting. After repeated dispatch of Secretary Gao Lingbai to contact the representatives, they were asked to meet at the Central Military Academy, but they refused. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As of 2:00 a.m. this morning, the students from various universities in Shanghai insisted on not leaving because their petition goals had not been achieved. The weather in Nanjing suddenly turned cold on the 26th, with the thermometer dropping to below 40 degrees Celsius, accompanied by drizzle and northerly winds. The Government Secretariat Office vacated all the empty rooms in the Government building as much as possible to provide a place for the students to rest. (2:00 a.m., 27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of various schools in the capital held a grand rally at the public sports ground at 3:00 p.m. on the 26th to see off Commander-in-Chief Chiang on his expedition to the north to fight the Japanese. More than 10,000 students from various schools attended. Chiang sent He Yaozu as a representative to attend. First, Zhang Shude, Chairman of the Anti-Japanese Association, delivered a sincere and enthusiastic farewell speech. Representative He replied, saying that Commander-in-Chief Chiang was very pleased with the students' enthusiastic patriotism and was very moved by the students' earnest expectations of Commander-in-Chief Chiang. He was willing to accept them sincerely. However, what he hoped from the students was that they must know that to resist foreign aggression, we must first pacify the interior and that unity is the only way to resist foreign aggression. The enemy and all reactionary factions are using the saying that they are going north to carry out various malicious propaganda in order to achieve the goal of undermining peace and unification. The government's only policy now is to unite sincerely in order to achieve domestic peace and unification. Students should devote all their energy to upholding peace and unification as the foundation for resisting the enemy and saving the country, and under the leadership of the Party, find a proper way to save the country for the entire country and nation in order to curb the enemy's atmosphere and save the country from danger. Zheng Kaiqi, Chairman of the Presidium, held a flag presentation ceremony. The flag read "Kill the Traitors for the Country." On the right was written "Commemoration of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Expedition to the North to Fight the Japanese." Representative He accepted the flag, and the whole group shouted slogans. Because the petition group from various universities in Shanghai was demanding troops against Japan at the National Government, but there were no results, they unanimously formed a team to go to the National Government to assist in the petition. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the petition to the National Government by the student delegation from various universities in Shanghai to send troops, the Government Secretary-General issued a statement saying that since the Japanese army invaded and occupied the Eastern Provinces, students from all over the country have come to Nanjing to petition. Chairman Chiang and the members of the National Government, because they are out of patriotic enthusiasm, have been meeting with them despite their busy schedule. However, the documents disclosed in the newspapers by the student delegation to Nanjing this time are worded beyond the scope. Their actions from Shanghai to Nanjing included forcibly taking vehicles and beating roadside workers, which is not what law-abiding students should do. It is very regrettable. After arriving in Nanjing, Chairman Chiang instructed the students to go to the Central Military Academy to listen to the training, but they refused to go and gathered at the National Government, also refusing to send representatives to meet first. This was unprecedented in previous petitions. Yu Youren, a member of the committee, earnestly warned them in public, but they did not listen. They had to see Chairman Chiang at the National Government and wanted the Chairman to write a vow in person in public. The time of the Chairman's departure is a matter of opportunity, which cannot be asked by others. At this time, the people of the country should be consistent from top to bottom. If they trust the government, the government should have full power to handle it. If they do not trust it, the Chairman naturally has no need to answer, and there is no way to be coerced by students to sign. This principle should be known even to a three-foot-tall child. The Chairman is entrusted by the Party and the country and is responsible to the entire Party and the entire nation. Now, a small number of students want the Chairman to sign in public. This is either insulting the head of state or insulting the personality of the country and the entire nation. At a time when foreign troubles are urgent, such slow actions and disregard for the legal system against the government will make it difficult for the government to face the outside world. Most of the reactionary leaflets and other things were found, and the words were absurd. Moreover, according to reports, the Communist Party will secretly plot actions in Nanjing within days, which shows that the background of this matter is complicated, and the reactionary factions, the Communist Party, and the traitors are instructing from behind. What do they love in young people, and a few college students do not know right from wrong and are willing to fall into their trap, which is really heartbreaking. Looking at the situation before and after the students came to Nanjing, it is obvious that someone has planned in advance, wanting to sacrifice young people and force the government into embarrassment, and the conspiracy is very sinister. The government has always loved and protected young people and believes that most young people are being used without realizing it. We must be extremely tolerant, hoping that they will understand and urge them to obey. On the one hand, we must maintain order and law. In the midst of this deepening foreign trouble, if anyone uses the name of patriotism to try to shake the government and disrupt order, they will be abandoned by the people of the country. For this matter, our people must have a clear and correct observation, and we especially hope that young people will wake up as soon as possible and not be used by others because of patriotic motives. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Four thousand students from forty-three secondary schools in Shanghai came to Nanjing to petition. At 10:00 a.m. on the 26th, Chairman Chiang summoned the students to the auditorium of the Central Military Academy to address them, expressing his determination to go north and devote himself to the Party and the country, with the determination to do his best until his death. No matter what, he would do his best to protect the territory and defend the country. The students felt that their petition had achieved satisfactory results and decided to gather at the Central Military Academy at 7:30 a.m. on the 27th, take the Beijing-Shanghai train from the small train station of the National Government to Xiaguan, and transfer to the Beijing-Shanghai train back to Shanghai.

<p>(Jinan) More than 200 members of the Tsinghua University petition group passed through Jinan this morning on their way to Nanjing. According to the head of the delegation, Huang Gonglin, this was because Wu Qichang, a teacher at the school, was on a hunger strike out of concern for the country. Therefore, they went to the National Government to petition for a speedy resolution of diplomatic relations with Japan. Otherwise, the entire delegation would go on a hunger strike at the National Government and would not eat again until the goal was achieved. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Reveals</h3>
<p>Japan's So-Called Self-Defense</p>
<p>Invading Chinese Territory and Calling It Self-Defense</p>
<p>Is No Different From Bandits Killing People and Calling It Self-Defense</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News said, "We are still waiting for Japan to clearly announce its hopes for invading the three northeastern provinces. Japan has claimed to the world that it hopes to obtain certain treaty rights to guarantee the safety of Japanese residents and property in the three northeastern provinces and to defend itself against Chinese attacks. However, its actions of occupying the three northeastern provinces have obviously not produced such results. The safety of its people has been reduced compared to before, and its property, such as the South Manchuria Railway and industrial and commercial enterprises, is at a standstill. It is also far from the purpose of protection. Judging from its actions, Japan's true intention is to occupy the territory of the three northeastern provinces of China so that China can submit to Japan's conditions for dominating East Asia for redemption. This kind of true purpose is now becoming increasingly clear. Since September 18th, every action of Japan has had this intention. The propaganda from Tokyo wants to make the whole world approve of its wishes. News from the Japanese side that arrives in Shanghai via Tokyo says that Chinese troops are advancing to attack Shenyang. Although the Japanese propaganda is clumsy, it is extremely effective, and many people believe that Japan is retaliating for China's attempt to take back the seized land and that a new invasion of Chinese troops is a self-defense measure. Since the first Japanese invasion on September 18th, there has not been a day without such incidents, attempting to use the name of counterattack to cover up its invasion. Japan's self-defense is advancing into Chinese territory every hour. It is the self-defense of those who kill people in the name of debt collection. It is the self-defense of kidnappers who kill their pursuers. From the kidnappers' point of view, their actions are of course correct. From Japan's point of view, its actions are of course also correct. But from the point of view of civilized countries, there is nothing more indefensible in the world. Does Japan today want to live with bandits and be the judge, jury, and executioner of its own national destiny and the destiny of the victims? Or will it announce to the public that no matter how strong its country is, it cannot fight against the world? What to do is Japan's choice."</p>
<h3>Japanese Actively</h3>
<p>Build the Jihui and Changda Railways</p>
<p>To Complete the "Manchuria-Mongolia Railway Centralism"</p>
<p>Both Railways Are Scheduled to Open to Traffic in November Next Year</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: After forcibly occupying Liaoning and Jilin, the violent Japanese have been actively seizing our Northeast Railway in order to complete their Manchuria-Mongolia Railway Centralism. Except for the Beining Railway, which has special relations, and part of the Taoang Railway, which have not been trampled on by them, the rest, such as the Sitao, Jichang, Jidun, Jihei, and Shenhai Railways, have all fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Recently, they have been plotting to invade the Jichang Railway. Last month, the president and vice president of the Mantetsu, Uchida and Eguchi, returned to Japan and consulted with various parties on this matter. The two returned to Dalian on the 11th of this month and went to Shenyang again on the 13th. Those who accompanied them included Wutang, the director, and Murakami, the railway minister. It is reported that this trip was for the construction of the Jihui and Changda Railways. On the 13th, the Dalian News reported on this, saying that the Mantetsu had made all preparations for various projects for the construction of the Jichang Railway, and had also reached an agreement with the Jilin Provincial Government. They only need to sign the contract before they can start construction. It also quoted Mantetsu President Uchida as saying that the construction of the Jichang Railway is a vested interest of Japan, and since it has been promised by the Jilin Provincial Government, it will naturally start immediately. Railway Minister Murakami also said that the construction of the railway is imperative, and the cost will be advanced by Mantetsu first. If Mantetsu is unable to cope, the government will advance it first. From this, we can know that the time for the construction of the Jichang Railway is imminent. After the newspaper disclosed this information, the Japanese Kwantung Government immediately issued an order strictly prohibiting publication, which is even more convincing. The reporter believed that this matter was of great importance and immediately went to inquire about it in various aspects. It is said that the Mantetsu had already prepared for the construction of the Jihui and Changda Railways. Before Uchida returned to Japan, he ordered the General Affairs Department of the Mantetsu to handle the negotiations on the railway and the Railway Department to prepare for the construction. The two departments proceeded separately. The General Affairs Department negotiated with the Jilin pseudo-Provincial Government, which was deceived by interests and willingly committed this act of selling out the country, recognizing everything of Japan. The Railway Department planned the surveying, design, labor, materials, etc. The construction cost of the Jihui Railway is set at 35 million yuan, and the construction cost of the Changda Railway is set at 30 million yuan. It is scheduled to start construction in late this month. The Jihui Railway is scheduled to be completed in July next year, and the Changda Railway is scheduled to be completed in November next year. Both railways will be open to traffic in November. As for the Jihui line, readers are already well aware of its advantages and disadvantages, so I will not repeat them. The so-called Changda Railway is the western extension line of the Jihui Railway. This line runs from Changchun to Daitun, more than 200 miles long, and is only more than 200 miles away from Angangxi. If this line is completed, it will be connected with the Jichang, Jidun, and Jihui lines to form a unified whole. In peacetime, it can absorb special products from northern Manchuria to achieve its economic policy. During wartime, troops can be transported from Korea to northern Manchuria in an instant to achieve its military effect. The Jihui Railway has only more than 200 miles that have not been laid. Japan has now combined Jichang and Jidun into one. After the Huining to Dunhua section is completed, the line can be directly opened to traffic. (17th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Issues Declaration to the Outside World</h3>
<p>No Discussion of Other Issues Unless Japanese Troops Withdraw First</p>
<p>The translated text of Zhang Xueliang's declaration to the outside world on the evening of the 22nd is as follows: According to the report of the Council meeting in Paris on the 20th, China and those who carefully pay attention to the duties of the League of Nations have the impression that the duty undertaken by the League of Nations is to prevent further battles and reduce the serious situation in Manchuria to a minimum. The League of Nations Council has set aside the one point that should be insisted on now. It is reported that the Council has failed to implement its resolution of October 24th. According to the resolution, the first step to obtain a peaceful and just solution to the Manchuria crisis is to insist that the Japanese troops outside the South Manchuria Railway line should withdraw from Chinese territory before November 16th. If this report is true, then the League of Nations Council has failed to insist on respecting its own proposals and orders, and it cannot but raise serious questions as to whether the League of Nations itself admits that it is unable to deal with this situation. Moreover, such measures are not a good omen for the future of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The scene in Paris or Geneva must be very different from Tokyo, Nanjing, or Beiping, but the fact that the Japanese army has not only failed to comply with the resolution of the League of Nations Council to withdraw from the Chinese territory of Manchuria, but has indeed adopted a policy of invading other Chinese territories, is known to all capitals of the world.</p>
<p>The fact that the Japanese army advanced into northern Manchuria on November 16th, when the Council was meeting in Paris, under the pretext of protecting traffic, is a public disregard for the Council's resolution of October 24th. The Japanese army has now occupied Qiqihar, north of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and is further expanding its military operations to the north.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its willingness to protect the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the South Manchuria Railway zone, but the policies and actions of the Japanese warlords have prevented China's wishes from being realized. While the Japanese army cut off traffic between Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, it accused China of the chaos in order. The facts show directly that it is the actions of the Japanese army itself.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, it said that there were a large number of Chinese troops in Manchuria. This is a lie. Recently, the Japanese side claimed that 50,000 Chinese cavalry were concentrated in Tongliao and that a large army was concentrating in Jinzhou, and that trains full of infantry had arrived outside the pass from Pingjin. This report is also inaccurate. This is another excuse that the Japanese side will use to further expand its planned policy of aggression.</p>
<p>The Japanese military authorities confiscated the income of the legitimate government of Manchuria, attempting to create a financial crisis. Our intentions are obvious.</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji has repeatedly and earnestly stated this situation in Geneva. Although it is reported that the Council will put the dispute aside and discuss the issue of treaty rights, China has not lost its trust in the Council. China admits that it will discuss all issues related to Manchurian treaty rights at an appropriate time and place, but the Council must insist on the Japanese army's withdrawal first before China can negotiate on the causes and issues included in the treaty. If the Council cannot resolve the Manchurian crisis, it does not intend to discuss it, which will make the event more expansive. This has great potential.</p>
<p>Now there are various opportunities that should call attention, that is, the Council can only insist on restoring the status quo in order to make observers more aware of the current situation in the Northeast. Under the unprecedented abnormality, China has cooperated with the League of Nations and has received the League of Nations' proposals.</p>
<p>I cannot but express my personal opinion, because I understand how unwise it is for the League of Nations to establish a puppet government in Manchuria that is consistent with the Japanese warlords. This government is bound to fail. I am deeply skeptical about how the world will treat the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty in the future. Will these treaties all become waste paper?</p>

<p>University and Middle School Students Go to Nanjing to Petition: More than 2,000 male and female students from universities and middle schools in Wuxian County boarded trains in two batches on the 24th to go to Nanjing to petition on the issue of sending troops to the Northeast.

A general inspection will be implemented starting on December 1st. If it is found that there are still Japanese goods being sold privately, they will be treated as smuggling. The merchants of various industries are not very satisfied with this matter. Because most stores are in debt to Zhuang accounts, how can they repay the Zhuang accounts if Japanese goods are sealed up? Therefore, yesterday (25th), representatives of foreign goods and grocery industries, such as Shen Shu-zhang, went to the Anti-Japanese Association to petition, requesting an extension until the end of the lunar year. The Standing Committee member Xia Xue-jun received them and agreed to submit it to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>

Unexpectedly, when he arrived at the Shidaokou area, the crew was careless when smoking and accidentally threw the cigarette butt into the kerosene. The flames flew up. The boat owner and crew, a total of seventeen or eighteen people, saw that the disaster had occurred and put the sampan into the water. However, the sampan could only hold seven or eight people. Those who could not get on the sampan put the boat planks into the water to float. Unexpectedly, the boat owner Zhang Xiaodi and a certain sailor and an apprentice were killed in the kiln because they had no sampan or wooden planks to escape.</p>

<h3>The Current Situation of Students Studying in Japan</h3>
<p>Since the Eastern Province Incident, overseas Chinese students studying in Japan have returned to China one after another due to their unbearable humiliation by the Japanese, especially young students who are righteously indignant. A reporter from the China East News Agency met a student who had just returned from Japan yesterday and according to him, there were more than 2,000 students studying in Japan at the peak, but according to a recent survey by the supervisor's office for students studying in Japan, there were only 600 students in Japan. Most of these 600 students are students of Imperial University, and the rest are students from the Eastern Province who have nowhere to return. The official fees from the province have been cut off, and the economy is quite difficult. He also said that those studying military affairs in Japan, whether they are on official expenses, self-funded, or sent by important people, have all returned to China since the Northeast Incident in preparation for fighting against Japan.</p>

The Red Team had balanced strength, with good offense and defense. Xu Kepei scored on every shot. In the first half, the Red Team won 26 to 9. From the second half onwards, also's momentum suddenly increased, and the scores rose repeatedly. The Red Team worked hard to resist, and the situation suddenly became tense.

<h3>Zhizhi Suffers a Miserable Defeat</h3>
<p>The fierce battle between Zhizhi and Jinan began. Jinan took the lead, with Li Chengyuan scoring two out of two free throws. Zhizhi was not willing to fall behind, and Yang and Qian scored two goals in return. The competitive situation was extremely tense. Jinan's momentum was fierce, adding four more goals in a row, taking a 12 to 4 lead. But Zhizhi had deep skill and was unwilling to lag behind, launching an active counterattack. Qian Dingshen and Kong Guangyi made wonderful shots and scored again and again, reversing the situation to 13 to 12. Soon, Jinan surpassed them again. After a short stalemate, Zhizhi took the lead again with 15 to 14. Kong Guangyi added another goal, taking a three-point lead. Unexpectedly, luck was no longer on their side, and Jinan's brilliance rose again, taking the lead again from then on. At the end of the first half, Jinan won 21 to 19. The situation was the same in the second half. Zhizhi was always in a state of being oppressed, but the difference in score was always between one and two points. Persisting to the end, Zhizhi's talents did not show, and they suffered a miserable defeat. When the score was 42 to 40 (Jinan wins), Zhizhi's Qian Dingshen raised his hand to shoot, and it actually went in, but because the time had already ended, Qian was only one or two seconds late, so this goal was not recorded, and they lost to Jinan by a small margin, which was very regrettable.</p>

<h3>Nationalistic Education and Strengthening the Nation</h3>
<p>Washing Away Shame Xu Zhengji</p>
<p>The Japanese are invading, and their atrocities have not ceased. Their ambition is gradually becoming a grand plan to annex our country. We who live in this era should plan ways to resist the enemy. The so-called "every man has a responsibility" is what is meant. However, the way to wash away shame and strengthen the country should not be empty talk, but must have a concrete plan. In the past, when Yue defeated Wu, it relied on ten years of recuperation and ten years of teaching and training. Today, if we want to avenge the national humiliation, the way is also none other than this. The so-called recuperation is to gather the wealth of the world and temper ourselves in preparation. Teaching and training is today's education. The methods of the predecessors are the teachers of later generations. We deeply believe that the power of education can wash away shame and strengthen the country, and we are already in the education field, so how can we not be vigilant and seek how to use education to wash away shame and save the country? This is what we must strive to do in the future.</p>
<p>However, education with such great effect must be different from the decadent, spiritless, and aimless education of the past. In other words, it must be transformed, imbued with the spirit of nationalism, uniting the nation as one, so that the people can be guided by nationalistic education, understand the benefits and harms of national unity and division, and devote the power of the entire people to the entire national spirit. Only then can we consistently implement nationalistic education. I say that if we can do this, then success is likely. Now, let me speak of the outline of nationalistic education.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen explained the meaning of nationalism in two ways: first, the Chinese nation seeks its own liberation; second, all ethnic groups within China are equal. This means that we must strive to make our country a truly independent, completely free, equal, and free nation. In short, it is how to break away from the oppression of imperialism and stand independently in the world. At the same time, we must recognize that all ethnic groups within the country have the right to self-determination, combine with each other in a spirit of equality, and organize a free and unified Republic of China. Today, we base our national education on these two major points and name it Nationalistic Education. Let us now discuss it separately.</p>
<p>First, the first step in realizing nationalistic education is to popularize education. For example, in this Japanese invasion, those in the intellectual class and those in the cities certainly know about it. However, if you ask the farmers in the countryside or the residents of remote areas, they may still be unaware. National shame is a shame shared by every citizen. Today, anti-Japanese propaganda must enlighten the general public to know that when national disaster is imminent, if we want to survive, we must wash away this strange shame. The shame that was previously only the shame of a small number of intellectuals and a few people in the cities must be transformed into the shame of the vast majority of people. To do this, we must use education to make people understand shame. My old friend Wu Junzeng proposed to first implement adult education to save the situation, which is a very good method, but the popularization of education is even more important.</p>
<p>We all know that our greatest enemy is Japan. Since the Meiji Restoration, they have only made fifty years of effort, but they have transformed into a world power. This is also due to the power of popular education. According to the recent statistics report of their Ministry of Education, 99.5% of the country's population has received education. This shows the extent of their popular education. Looking back at our country, only one or two out of ten people are literate, which is also extremely pitiful. Since we recognize education as important and that education can enlighten the people and save the country, then popularizing education is a plan that cannot be delayed at this moment. As for how to realize the popularization of education, it is the responsibility of the education administrative authorities. I am afraid I cannot elaborate.</p>
<p>Second, nationalistic education should cultivate national self-esteem to establish national character. Our people have always regarded peace and courtesy as virtues, which is fine internally, but is greatly inappropriate externally. In this Japanese invasion of our eastern provinces, the governor of the eastern provinces actually proclaimed the principle of non-resistance to us and the countries of the world. Tolerating evil is leading a wolf into the house. Those who advocate this principle certainly have their own difficulties, but it further shows the demoralization of our weak national spirit. It is a laughingstock to friendly countries. How can we not feel heartache? Mr. Fen of the Weekly Life said, "There are many doctrines in the world, but no one has ever loudly called for a doctrine of non-resistance." How true are these words! Therefore, the populist education of our people will enable students to have self-esteem, not to give way in righteousness, to be brave in righteousness, to have their heads broken, and to have their ambitions unyielding. People have personality, and why should not the country? Abstractly, it is named national character. All the people of the country strive for this national character.</p>
<p>Third, nationalistic education takes national humiliation as the center of all facilities. The main purpose of nationalistic education has been stated above. In a word, it is to seek survival and wash away shame. If the first item can be realized, then all levels of schools must strictly implement national humiliation education, so that students have a deep understanding of national humiliation. The method is to add national humiliation teaching materials to the existing various textbooks on the market, and each school may also酌量the situation and compile its own supplements. All the arrangements, discipline, and management of the school are based on national humiliation, sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, and putting it into practice. Then, after ten years of teaching, why worry about the failure of the matter? However, it is necessary to pay attention to changing the management policy. I say that licentiousness and being out of touch with reality are particularly evident in today's university and middle school students. Using this kind of pleasure-seeking, lazy, and drunken student to save the country is enough to accelerate its demise. Therefore, schools must engage in strict management to cultivate a disciplined life in preparation for saving the country.</p>
<p>Fourth, nationalistic education phát扬the Chinese national spirit to promote national glory. The Chinese nation has fallen to the extreme. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the first, second, and third lectures on nationalism, have already been explained in detail by me. The Chinese people have no self-esteem, so they are not ashamed to follow the trend of Europe and the United States in everything. They do not know that our country has its own great national essence. They only rely on the saying that "it is easy to know but difficult to act," which has made the culture of the past two thousand years without any progress. Therefore, nationalistic education should follow Sun Yat-sen's legacy, phát huythe spirit of the Chinese nation, and make it infinitely great. Every time I see fashionable Chinese people infected with foreign habits, they do not have Chinese毛笔all year round, but they buy fountain pens, and they are not stingy even if they cost dozens of yuan. 革履Western clothing is regarded as expensive, and they regard borrowing domestic goods as展斯为爱国. Who believes in this? In the future, education must pay attention to this. Students are people in the intellectual class, role models for society, and future masters of the country. Their demeanor and integrity are everywhere as a model for the people, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Combining the above four points, we can see that the national self-esteem风is completely different from the decadent and weak风of the past. Relying on the popularization of education, all citizens are cultivated with the determination to wash away shame. I believe that nationalistic education is the most suitable education for today's national conditions. In other words, if we want to plan for the new survival of our people, then we must advocate the New Democracy. If we want to advocate the New Democracy, then we must use the power of education to贯澈success. Education takes the New Democracy as its main purpose, so it is called nationalistic education. We certainly know that education has long been prescribed as education based on the Three Principles of the People, but in reality, it is nominal but not thực質. It is better to adapt to the national conditions and first engage in the realization of nationalistic education in the Three Principles of the People. We deeply believe that those who can wash away national humiliation must be educated in nationalism. Nationalistic education is education that has the effect of washing away shame. Only by strictly implementing nationalistic education can national humiliation be eliminated. In the midst of the anti-Japanese national salvation声, I feel the importance of advocating nationalistic education. I am writing this as a modest contribution to promotion, and I wish for the success of nationalistic education, and I hope that the great雅can teach me. (Shanghai Songjiang Middle School)</p>

<p>Remittance Received</p>
<p>Provincial Government Moves to Hailun</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of this city, because Ma Zhanshan's army was fighting the Japanese in isolation, specially saved 2,000 yuan from the office expenses and remitted it for support. Later, because it was impossible to transfer it in Qiqihar, it was changed to Harbin. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received, saying, "I have received your telegram. Thank you for your compliments and generous gifts. The officers and men of the three armies are grateful. I respectfully receive your kind words and will encourage my original ambition. Our government has now moved to Hailun. Your remittance has been sent to Harbin and personnel have been dispatched to make arrangements for the transfer."

<p>###颜惠庆's Talk</p>
<p>Sailing on the Lincoln tonight</p>
<p>Arriving before the opening of the U.S. Congress</p>
<p>Deeply hoping for national unity soon</p>
<p>The newly appointed Minister to the United States, 颜惠庆, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday and stayed at the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund. Yesterday afternoon, he responded to the banquet of friends in Shanghai and negotiated the purchase of cabins and other matters. Yang Nianzu, Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Section Chief Zhao Tie Zhang came to visit him and took care of everything for him. A reporter from this newspaper specially visited him at his residence yesterday. 颜惠庆氏's hair was already gray, but his spirit was good. He said that twenty-three years ago, when Wu Tingfang was envoy to the United States, he served as the second-class counselor of the U.S. Embassy. Now that he is taking on this important task again, he thinks that the embassy building is still the same, but things must have changed greatly. The reporter asked if the League of Nations was clearly in a helpless state regarding the Sino-Japanese incident, and that the so-called investigation团had become a tool for Japan to delay the withdrawal of troops. 颜惠庆氏's recent photo (taken by this museum). Then, how will our country save itself in the future? 颜氏replied that the League of Nations had rejected Japan's second resolution on October 24, and that it was feasible to use the first resolution on September 30 as the basis for the matter, but at the same time, it should immediately restore the Japanese military actions and occupied areas after September 30 to their original state on September 30, which is fair. Now, it is only fair to say that only based on the first resolution, the fact that the Japanese army has advanced should be wiped out. As for the organization of the investigation团, if it cannot accommodate our country's proposal, our country can vote against it, or even refuse to vote. I think that although the problem with Japan侧重is on diplomacy, the whole country should first unite and make the greatest determination to sacrifice everything, and then the external speeches will be more powerful. I deeply believe that the United States has always been friendly to us, and this time the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, so its speeches have to be particularly careful. The U.S. Congress is scheduled to open at the end of December, and I can arrive in Washington around the 20th, and the air of the国会will greatly affect the entire foreign policy of the United States. 颜氏has decided to sail on the Dollar Company's Lincoln President轮tonight, accompanied by Embassy Secretary Li Chang, Director 颜荣生, and 颜之公子等几people. 颜氏told reporters yesterday that he deeply regretted that he could not相值伍朝枢氏.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Guangdong Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>Conferred on Diplomatic Issues</p>
<p>Emphasizing Self-Reliance</p>
<p>To Salvage the Guangdong Faction Dispute</p>
<p>Deeply Hoping for Support from General Zhang for Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Amid Unified Voices Against Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>After the Guangdong Faction's Fourth National Congress was suspended midway, Mr. Hu Zhantang, along with Wu Maqin and others, traveled south the day before yesterday to mediate, anticipating that in the face of national crisis, they could continue to unite and resist the violent Japanese. Currently, the Guangdong Faction's representatives remaining in Shanghai are only Mr. Wang Jingwei and Mr. Zou Haibin. Yesterday, Mr. Wang sent a telegram specifically regarding General Zhang Fakui's military support for Heilongjiang to Chen Jitang and Li Zongren in Guangdong. In the afternoon, Shao Lizi, He Yingqin, and Zhu Peide arrived in Shanghai from Beijing, and subsequently arranged a meeting with key Beijing figures. The events of yesterday are summarized below:</p>
<p>Wanglu Luncheon</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the morning, Shao Lizi, He Yingqin, and Zhu Peide arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by car. After getting off, each returned to their residences to rest. At ten o'clock, Cai Yuanpei and Chen Mingshu first arrived at Wu Tiecheng's residence in Wanglu on Haige Road for a meeting. Soon after, Li Shizeng, Shao Lizi, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, and others also arrived at Wanglu. The discussion then began. The content of the discussion, it is said, covered not only diplomatic issues but also matters such as Chairman Chiang's trip north and Mr. Hu Hanmin's return to Guangdong. After this initial exchange of views, Chen Mingshu went to meet with Wang at Pushi Road, and agreed to meet at 3 PM at Gu Mengyu's new residence at No. 12 Du Mei New Village on Du Mei Road, inviting Mr. Gu to participate as well. Chen returned with a response and hurriedly returned to Wanglu to inform everyone. As it was already noon, they had lunch at Wanglu. At three o'clock in the afternoon, they all traveled by car to Du Mei Road.</p>
<p>Meeting at Gu's Residence</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei and others left Wanglu for Gu's residence. Because the address had not been described in detail beforehand, and Gu's new residence had not been assigned a house number, they searched repeatedly without finding it. Wang, having waited a long time without their arrival, also drove to Wanglu to investigate. Cai and others had already returned in disappointment. Coincidentally, they met Cai, Chen, Li, Shao, and others' cars on the way. Consequently, Wang led them to the meeting location. During the meeting, Wang's wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, had already been arranging and tidying up, because although the residence had been rented by Gu, Gu had not yet moved in, and there was only a caretaker and a servant present.</p>
<p>Content of the Discussion</p>
<p>Those present at yesterday's meeting included Wang Jingwei, Cai Yuanpei, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Li Shizeng, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, and eight others. Although Gu Mengyu had been invited to participate in advance, he did not participate due to being out for business, despite two phone calls. Therefore, Wang and others talked from 3:10 PM until 5:20 PM. When the meeting adjourned, the reporter from the Guowen News Agency asked Cai Yuanpei about the progress of the meeting. Cai only replied that today's discussion was limited to diplomatic aspects, such as dealing with the League of Nations and Chairman Chiang's trip north. Several people may have to return to Beijing tonight. The reporter, unable to get the gist, went to Wang's residence to meet with Wang. According to the discussion, in addition to foreign affairs issues, other topics discussed were primarily about the northward advance of the Fourth Army. Because the Fourth Army, commanded by Zhang Xianghua, was under the jurisdiction of Mr. Li Delin, and all the provisions were allocated by Mr. Chen Bonan. Nanjing stated that there were no problems with the Fourth Army moving north. The ships would first arrive in Shanghai, and the land route would first arrive in Xunhan, meaning that they could choose either route via Shanghai or Wuhan. However, the provisions and commander had to be approved in advance, so today I (Mr. Wang) also sent a telegram (telegram attached below) to Mr. Chen and Mr. Li. Then, when asked about the timing of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's trip north and the future of the Guangdong meeting, he replied that the date of Mr. Chiang's trip was uncertain, but in my opinion, the Fourth National Congress of Guangzhou would definitely continue. I also received a telegram from Guangdong today, stating that the Congress would be held as usual after Hu and Wu arrived in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chen and Li</p>
<p>Wang sent a telegram to Chen Jitang and Li Zongren yesterday, which stated: "To Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan and Commander-in-Chief Li Delin of Guangzhou, I hope you are well. I do not know whether the request for Xianghua to lead troops to support Heilongjiang has been approved in the recent military meeting. I am very concerned. In my opinion, Xianghua's request stems purely from patriotism, and the two gentlemen will surely help him achieve his goals. I hope that a decision will be made soon so that he can proceed. I have repeatedly met comrades here and received letters and telegrams from comrades in various places, stating that many are willing to join Xianghua's army and go to fight the enemy together. I deeply hope that this action will be realized soon. If you approve, please reply. Wang Zhaoming."</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram Urging</h3>
<p>To Implement Peace Talks</p>
<p>Those Who Disrupt Will Be Seen As Public Enemies</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to both Beijing and Guangdong, urging them to implement the resolution of the preparatory meeting for peace talks, and also sent a circular telegram to the chambers of commerce of various provinces and cities, unanimously advocating. The telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram One: To the National Government of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Nanjing, Mr. Hu Hanmin, forwarded to the representatives of the Fourth National Congress in Guangzhou, and Mr. Wang Jingwei in Shanghai. With the national crisis imminent, only peaceful unification can save the country. The entire nation is convinced of this. Representatives from Beijing and Guangdong have painstakingly agreed on a concrete plan in Shanghai, to be separately passed and implemented by the Fourth National Congress of both sides with a spirit of cooperation. Only this is relied upon for the great plan to save the nation. Now that the external situation is becoming more urgent, unification must be realized urgently. I hope you will swiftly and earnestly implement the decisions of the preparatory meeting to live up to the expectations of the people. If there are still those who, in this time of crisis and survival, disrupt peace and fuel the enemy's flames for the sake of personal opinions and willingly become sinners of China, the people will regard them as public enemies. In an emergency, I dare to state directly. Please be aware and do not be negligent. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Telegram Two: To all provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, I have just sent Telegram One (the text of the telegram is above). I hope you will unanimously advocate, awaken the people, create a strong public opinion, and promote the early realization of peaceful unification. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Amid Peculiarly Tight Money Supply</h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Silver Dollars Exported</p>
<p>Nearly Eight Million Yuan Shipped Out in Ten Days</p>
<p>The Banking Industry Has Automatically Organized an Inspection Team</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Consult on Prevention Measures</p>
<p>With the city's money supply being unusually tight in recent days, the financial community is already planning relief measures. It is now learned that in the past ten days, a large number of silver dollars have been shipped to Dalian and other places. It is heard that various sectors are actively paying attention to this matter. The following is an inquiry about various news related to this matter:</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Silver Export</p>
<p>In the past ten days, a large number of silver dollars have been exported from the Shanghai Customs and shipped to places such as Dalian, Qingdao, and Yantai. It is heard that about three to four million yuan went to Dalian, and two to three million yuan went to Qingdao and Yantai. After these funds arrived, the Japanese tried to buy them with gold notes and Northeast China banknotes. On the one hand, the Japanese forcibly coerced the normal use of Northeast China banknotes within their sphere of influence, otherwise they would be put to death. On the other hand, they raised the price of silver dollars to absorb them. Some merchants in this city, greedy for small profits, first loaded 52 boxes of silver dollars, totaling 160,000 yuan, on Zhejiang ships to Dalian. Recently, it is heard that the Hai Shun and Zhao Xing ships also transported a large number of silver dollars to Dalian. In order to avoid attracting attention, all silver dollars shipped to Dalian do not have the word "Dalian" marked on the boxes. Therefore, strict investigation is necessary to uncover the truth.</p>
<p>The Banking Industry Organizes an Inspection Team</p>
<p>The banking industry staff, in view of the continuous large-scale export of silver dollars, are afraid that the enemy is plotting a trick. The prevention method cannot be explored by the outside world. Only colleagues in the industry can jointly take sanctions. Therefore, they automatically initiated the organization of a banking inspection team to closely monitor this action at any time, so as to report to the Anti-Japanese Association for handling.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Consults on Prevention Measures</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly reported that a large amount of silver dollars, amounting to three to four million yuan, has been transported to Dalian and other places in recent days. It is heard that some people are continuing to purchase them. Observing its hidden conspiracy, it seems to be taking advantage of the declining public debt and tight money supply in our country to search for exports and create financial panic. Officials should prevent and stop it to avoid causing an irreversible situation. According to public opinion, the prevention methods can be divided into two theories: (1) The silver industry has strict conditions for the sale of silver dollars, so that they will not be directly used by the enemy; (2) Request the National Government to issue an order to temporarily prohibit the export of silver. Whether the two theories can be implemented in parallel, and what are the advantages and disadvantages, the association has sent letters to the Silver and Money Industries Association yesterday to consult on everything, so as to consider and handle it.</p>
<p>The Banking Industry Establishes Anti-Japanese Association Yesterday</p>
<p>All staff of the banking industry, in view of the violence of the Japanese invaders who violated the eastern land, and the national indignation, had previously agreed on five major principles of severing relations (five conditions attached below). This time, they made further progress. Lin Dongfu, Tong Xianting, Shao Limo, Zhu Songlin, Yu Futian, and others initiated the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, which was announced at 7 PM last night. The inaugural meeting was held on the second floor of the Banking Association, with more than 100 members present. Tong Xianting chaired the meeting as usual and elected temporary standing committee members: Tong Xianting, Ai Yulin, Zhang Haifeng, Du Caitang, Shen Binrong, Liu Yongfu, Liu Yinghua, He Jinfang, Yu Futian, and other nine people, divided into six departments for handling. Key cases were discussed: (1) Measures for thoroughly investigating the destination of cash exports from the same industry. It was resolved that (A) the Banking Association should be advised to instruct member firms not to load silver for Japanese-occupied areas; (B) the customs declaration industry should be advised not to undertake the loading of silver used by the Japanese; (C) the firms in the same industry should be advised not to load current silver to Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, and Yingkou. An announcement was posted on the market to completely prevent the Japanese from using it, and the discipline officers were requested to pay special attention. (2) According to the resolution of the 19th standing meeting of the Banking Industry Association, economic severance with Japan: (A) Those who have direct dealings with Japanese merchants must settle all accounts from today; (B) Those who have dealings with Japanese compradores must settle all accounts from today; (C) No loans will be provided to merchants operating Japanese goods from today; (D) All Japanese bank notes will be refused; (E) No deposits for Japanese goods will be accepted. These five major principles should be worked hard by the discipline team to conduct detailed investigations and report to the association at any time to ensure thoroughness. It is heard that before the establishment, the association had obtained the consent of the industry's executive committee, and it is now scheduled to hold an election for formal standing executive committee members on December 3rd to start work, soliciting members, which will be temporarily closed on December 1st, and will be solicited again after the election.</p>

<h3>Zhang Fakui Determined to Annihilate the Japanese</h3>
<p>Reply to the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui's reply to the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association of Shanghai stated: "To the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, I have read your telegram and received your compliments, I am very ashamed and grateful. The violent Japanese are disrupting peace and invading our country. As a soldier, Fakui is responsible. I have long wished to lead my troops to annihilate those fierce and cruel people. Even if the government fails to make the final preparations, Fakui has already made the final determination. In case of emergency, I will gather comrades and volunteers to jointly face the national crisis." Zhang Fakui bows.</p>
<h3>Madam Chiang Initiates</h3>
<p>Comforting Meeting for General Ma's Soldiers</p>
<p>Organize a Wounded Soldier Rescue Team</p>
<p>To Depart Immediately to the Front Lines for Rescue</p>
<p>Madam Soong Mei-ling, the wife of Chairman Chiang of the National Government, regarding the current situation of Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province using a single isolated army to resist the violent Japanese, fighting bloodily for several days and nights, unyielding, his loyalty and courage are truly commendable. Therefore, she specially initiated a women's association to comfort the soldiers, raising donations and organizing a wounded soldier rescue team to support General Ma. It is learned that the association convened a meeting on the 25th. Madam Chiang reported on the preparations and briefly stated that Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang resisted the violent Japanese this time, disregarding death and fighting bravely, serving the country diligently. He can be compared to Zhang Xunyang of the Tang Dynasty and Yue Wumu of the Song Dynasty. The book says, "Die for duty and do not leave," and the poem says, "Not afraid of the strong and powerful." I can call Ma General this. However, now that it is winter, and the north is approaching freezing weather, how should we consider the enthusiasm of the soldiers who are desperately fighting on the front lines and bravely killing the enemy and prepare for comfort, so as to fulfill the duties of female compatriots. Next, it was resolved that: (1) First donate 10,000 yuan to comfort General Ma's soldiers; (2) Send a circular telegram to women across the country, and immediately organize wounded soldier rescue teams separately. It is also learned that Mr. Hu Wenhu, an overseas Chinese businessman in our country, is very enthusiastic about this matter, and has happily donated 30,000 yuan and remitted it to Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling. It is heard that Madam Sun is currently recuperating from illness and cannot personally prepare, so she handed over the full amount to the association. It is also learned that the organized rescue team and all the necessary medicines have been prepared and are expected to depart within a few days to the front lines for rescue.</p>
<h3>Continuous Donation of Funds to Aid the Military</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Continues to Remit Huge Sums</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, which previously raised donations to aid General Ma Zhanshan, received more than 33,000 yuan in five days. In addition to what has already been remitted, it is heard that the association remitted another 25,000 yuan yesterday through the Bank of China, and agreed with the bank that it must be delivered to General Ma Zhanshan in person, in order to live up to the trust of all sectors.</p>
<p>The Righteous Act of Newspaper Vendor Liu Yiming</p>
<p>Liu Yiming, a newspaper vendor at Qingliang Pavilion, previously sent all the proceeds from newspaper sales for two days, along with interest, totaling one yuan, to the Anti-Japanese Association, requesting it to be forwarded to the front lines, and attached a self-composed poem to eliminate the Japanese. His original letter stated: "To the esteemed gentlemen, I have been in sorrow and pain every day since the Japanese bandits occupied the eastern provinces. Every time I recall the tragedy of Korea's destruction and all the unfreedom of the slaves of the country, and the misery of my compatriots in the eastern provinces being trampled on, I wash my face with tears all day long. I think that the rise and fall of the country are the responsibility of every citizen. Although I am a poor newspaper vendor, how can my patriotism allow others to do so? I once signed up for the volunteer army, but because of my old age and blindness in my right eye, I was not qualified. Although I have the ambition, I cannot extend it. The spiritual pain cannot be expressed in words. On the day of the fall of Heilongjiang, I was suffering from poverty and disease. Therefore, I combined the proceeds from newspaper sales for two days, along with interest, to make up one yuan, and respectfully presented it to your association to be forwarded to the front lines, in order to fulfill my meager wishes. I know that it is like a drop in the bucket, which will not help, but I have the heart to throw bricks to attract jade. I implore the wealthy and noble guests to contribute to saving the country. You must know that saving the country is saving yourself."</p>
<p>Teachers and Staff Withdraw Salaries to Aid the Military</p>
<p>The Shanghai Teachers and Staff Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, in order to assist General Ma in fighting against Japan, has a method for providing military pay to the Heilongjiang army, that is, each teacher and staff member will give 3% of their monthly salary, which will be collected by each school and directly remitted to Heilongjiang Province. It is heard that most schools have raised a considerable amount. Shanghai Middle School Experimental Elementary School has remitted 192.45 yuan. Junyi and Jingye schools will also be able to remit within a few days.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Record of the National Goods Market Representative Assembly</p>
<p>▲ Da Zhonghua and Other Factories Donate 1,600 Yuan to Aid the Military</p>
<p>▲ Winter Sale Starting December 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market convened a manufacturer representative assembly at 3 PM on the 19th. More than 50 people attended. Zhu Boyuan chaired the meeting. After performing the rituals as usual, the chairman reported that the violent Japanese, disregarding justice and humanity, blatantly sent troops to Northeast China, forcibly violating the national border and slaughtering compatriots. It can be seen that their intention is to annex the entire Asia and complete their ideal continental policy. Their insidious and evil state is completely revealed. However, the officials in charge of the Northeast adopted a policy of non-resistance and retreated step by step, and the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin were trampled on and died one after another. Only General Ma of Heilongjiang and the soldiers under his command deeply understood humanity and righteousness. With the masses of the brigade, they fought to the death. The spirit of the elite was admired throughout the country. However, the ammunition was exhausted and the food was cut off, and the lone army was helpless, resulting in a tragic defeat. Recently, in Hailun, militias were trained and human armies were gathered, and a counterattack was scheduled. However, the lack of food and weapons made it difficult to march. The colleagues in this market, as citizens of the Republic of China, donated money to send troops and fulfill their duties. On the spot, those who automatically donated money included: Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory 1,000 yuan, Hongzhang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Tianfu Silk Shop, China Enamel Factory, Renchangyong Material Factory, Huafu Factory, Puqiu Company, Wuzhou Soap and Medicine Factory, Yutang, Shengde Weaving Factory, Guanshengyuan, Jinhua National Goods Company, Senyuanxiang Pearl and Diamond Factory, Xiangxing Leather Goods Factory, Zhongfu Toy Factory, Hangzhou Products Store, Zhenhua Pottery Factory, etc., a total of 600 yuan, totaling 1,600 yuan, which was handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be remitted immediately. The manufacturers who were not present that day have been sent by the market to raise funds. After the funds are raised, the second batch will be remitted. It was then decided to hold a winter sale for 21 days starting on December 1st, in order to live up to the usual patronage and love of domestic goods. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Departure of the National Alarm Bell Association</h3>
<p>▲ Carrying a Huge Bell to Camp in Front of the National Government</p>
<p>▲ Willing to Fast and Strike Continuously</p>
<p>The National Alarm Bell Association was previously organized by the late gentleman Li Pingshu and others, but was dissolved due to an incident. Recently, the violent Japanese forcibly occupied the land of our eastern three provinces. Members of the association, Ling Youguang and others, were indignant at the violent acts of the Japanese and immediately summoned old comrades to reorganize and revive the banner, specializing in all anti-Japanese work. This time, because Ma Zhanshan's lone army resisted the enemy and lacked ammunition, it was defeated. If the National Government does not send troops to rescue, it is feared that the Japanese army will become even more rampant. Members of the association, Ding Guanlan, Fu Yiming, Ling Youguang, Pei Fengzhang, Li Chunzhi, etc., specially carried tents and all propaganda materials, as well as a huge alarm bell, on the Shanghai-Nanjing train the night before yesterday to the capital to petition the National Government, demanding that troops be sent immediately in order to recover the lost land. If the National Government does not send troops for a day, the members will camp in front of the National Government for a day, and will also fast together, and will hang the alarm bell high and strike it continuously from morning to night. The sound of "tang tang" vibrates far and near, so as to urge the National Government Committee members to know that the national crisis is imminent and to quickly rescue. If the goal is not achieved, the work will never stop, and they will never return.</p>
<h3>Collection of Telegrams Urging Chiang to Go North</h3>
<p>▲ District Sub-Branches</p>
<p>The district sub-branches of Shanghai County yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang, Nanjing, "To Chairman Chiang, we have heard that you are determined to go north to recover the lost land. We are consoled by the sorrow. Recently, Zhang Fakui has requested to support Heilongjiang, and Ma Zhanshan's lone army still exists. Among the Northeast Army, there are also many soldiers who can fight. If you go north to command, it will not be difficult to recover the territory. Please go north immediately, and do not delay any longer, sitting and watching the enemy deepen their advance. Furthermore, General Feng Yuxiang is brave and good at fighting, and his troops are particularly resistant to cold and hardship. The terrain is also suitable. Now that the peace agreement has been reached and the previous grievances have been resolved, please immediately use him and order him to supervise the old troops and send troops together. Hopefully, they can cooperate with each other to achieve complete success."</p>
<p>▲ Municipal National Medical Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Medical Association, in view of the dangerous situation, previously resolved at an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees that, in addition to collecting national salvation funds for emergency needs, it also telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting an immediate order for mobilization. The telegram was sent yesterday, stating, "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, We believe that the Japanese pirates are tyrannical and recklessly invading. They have occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces and seized our Heilongjiang province. The officials in charge of the Northeast abandoned their duty to defend their territory, adhering to a policy of non-resistance. Although they advanced step by step, we only retreated step by step, causing the Northeast territory to shrink by hundreds of miles every day. The absurd and perverse behavior has shocked the country. Now the League of Nations, threatened by the violent Japanese's power, discards world justice. Our country does not know how to fight for itself, and only seeks skin with tigers. How can it be saved? Fortunately, General Ma Zhanshan deeply understands the meaning of justice and personally leads his lone army to resist the stubborn enemy. However, when the ammunition is exhausted and the support is cut off, how can we fight with bare hands? We hope that our government will deploy troops at this time to reinforce the north and mobilize the entire country to unite against the violent Japanese. Recently, we learned that the Fourth National Congress has passed the principles against Japan, and the chairman has expressed his determination to go north. This is what the people of the country have heard. However, the enemy has already taken action, but there is no day for the troops to leave. We are very worried. The provinces of the Northeast are not only a source of wealth for our country, but also a shield for the Central Plains. Therefore, the fall of the Northeast will endanger the Central Plains. For today's plan, we must immediately send troops to drive away the Japanese pirates. Moreover, at this time when the whole country is unanimously resisting Japan, we should take advantage of the good opportunity to control the thieves. If we continue to hesitate and delay, and miss the military opportunity, then the territory will eventually be submerged and the people will never see the light of day. Therefore, we deeply hope that our chairman will take on the righteousness of suppressing thieves with the spirit of saving the country, issue an order to command the army, swear to fight against the resistance, recover the territory, and cleanse the eternal shame, and save the people from fire and water. Fortunately, the great achievements can be passed down in history forever. The safety of the country and the survival of the nation are at stake. If we do not fight to the death, there is no way for us to survive. The comrades of our association and the people of the Northeast have a sense of friendship with the country's survival and the death of the country. At this time of crisis, we can't bear it anymore. We hereby express our words and plead for the country. The crisis is urgent, and we have no time to choose our words. We ask you to consider our humble sincerity. The Shanghai Municipal National Medical Association bows."</p>
<h3>Citizens' Federation</h3>
<p>Volunteer Army Schedules a Petition</p>
<p>To Serve in the North</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation convened a joint meeting of the committee members of the district sub-branches at 2 PM yesterday. More than 50 people attended. Chairman Wang Zhaocheng chaired the meeting as usual: (A) reported the purpose of the meeting; (B) discussed the proposals; (1) It was resolved that a petition will be held on December 1st; (2) Wang Hanliang, Zhang Yichen, Yu Hualong, Wang Yansong, Wang Zhaocheng, Wang Pingnan, Wang Chengdong, Liu Zhongying, Wu Banfang, Wang Honghui, Chen Duomin, Jiang Junyi, and Liang Gengshun were elected as petition representatives; (3) Wu Zhihao, Wang Zhaocheng, Wang Pingnan, Liu Zhongying, Jiang Junyi, Wu Banfang, Chen Duomin, Wang Chengdong, Tang Huilian, Wang Zhixiang, Chen Jiufeng, etc. were elected as members of the planning committee for the departure plan of the Volunteer Army. Next, other cases were discussed and dispersed at 4 PM.</p>
<h3>Chinese Workers in Japanese Factories Resign One After Another</h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Actively Provide Relief</p>
<p>After Japan forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces with violence, the situation became increasingly intensified. Following the occupation of Xinmin, the attack on Jinzhou, and the spying on Tianjin and Beijing, the Chinese employees of Japanese-owned factories and companies in this city, indignant at the oppression of the Japanese, resigned one after another for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country. More than 3,000 Chinese workers in factories such as Tongxing Yarn Factory have been arranged by the Anti-Japanese Association. The Tai Shan and Zhonghua factories are now being arranged by party and government agencies. The workers of the China Rubber Factory also petitioned the authorities yesterday. The various situations are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲ Tai Shan Rubber Factory</p>
<p>All more than 200 Chinese workers of the Japanese-owned Tai Shan Rubber Factory have resigned and submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau for relief. It is heard that the party and government agencies have arranged for them to be assigned to the employee factories of the Shanghai Rubber Manufacturing Industry Association.</p>
<p>▲ China Can Making Factory</p>
<p>All more than 200 Chinese workers, including Guo Shuangdeng, of the Japanese-owned China Metal Can Making Factory on Jixiang Road, Hongkou, resigned and submitted a petition to the authorities for relief. It is heard that the factory has been leased by Chinese Guo Gengyu and renamed Huachang Can Making Factory. It started work the day before yesterday, and all the resigned Chinese workers were employed as usual.</p>
<p>▲ China Rubber Factory</p>
<p>All 213 Chinese workers, both male and female, of the Japanese-owned China Rubber Printing Company on Qiqihar Road, left the factory on the 21st because the Japanese set up two machine guns in the factory to threaten the Chinese workers. At 10 AM yesterday, representatives Tian Luoyang, Shen Tingzhi, He Dongsheng, Zhang Peiyao, and others went to the Municipal Party Department to request: (1) to allocate funds to temporarily maintain the current livelihood of all workers; (2) to persuade the Shanghai Printing Industry Association to instruct all member factories to arrange employment as much as possible; (3) In addition to printing factories with larger scopes, which should employ as many people as possible, other factories should temporarily divide day and night work or use a shift system as appropriate to accommodate as many people as possible in order to save the urgent situation of unemployed workers. It is heard that the party and government agencies will discuss relief measures.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News on the Anti-Japanese Movement</h3>

More than 40 committee members attended. Lin Kanghou was publicly elected as chairman, with Zhao Shusheng and Tong Yikang as recorders. After the meeting began as scheduled, the following resolutions were passed: 1.

<p>▲ Investigation of the Daqing Store's Dealings in Japanese Goods: According to a secret report, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association learned that Daqing Cotton Cloth Store was secretly importing large quantities of Japanese goods. The association dispatched special inspection team leader Yang Changhai and inspectors Lin Jiamo and others to investigate. Subsequently, inspector Zhu Jiamo returned to the association and reported that he and team leader Yang had investigated Daqing Cotton Cloth Store's Japanese goods. The store immediately telephoned the Laozha Police Station, falsely claiming robbery. They then transported eleven pieces of white cloth with altered national trademarks, which they had seized, to the Zhabei Storage Office. Shortly thereafter, a large number of detectives gathered and arrested team leader Yang Changhai and team members Shi Xinmin, Ju Zongmei, Ge Yunting, and others. He took the opportunity to return to the association to report and request assistance, saying that Deng Zhonghe, the manager of Daqing Store, was cunning and treacherous, as everyone knew. During the anti-Japanese movement in the eighteenth year, he privately operated Japanese goods, earned profits without restraint, and habitually used the technique of alteration. On the 18th of this month, thirty-nine bags of altered white cloth seized from a car on Route Lafayette were also from the store. If severe punishment was not carried out, it would not be enough to warn the major traitors. At the same time, according to the report from the Investigation Department, the situation of seizing Daqing Store's Japanese goods and the奸商胡慎生was reported. According to investigation, the empty house at No. 1260 Lafayette Road, at the intersection of Rue Ratard... There was someone inside. When the door was called, there was no response. Then, the door was opened and entered, and a truck full of Japanese cloth was found. Hu Shengsheng came forward to argue. The thirty-nine packages of Japanese goods, white twill, and a truck were sent to the Zhabei Storage Office for inspection. Hu Shengsheng was brought to the meeting. According to Hu Shengsheng, he was an employee of the Fu'an Company (no sign on the door) inside the Daqing Cotton Cloth Store in Chongxin Lane, Ningbo Road. Today, boss Deng Zhonghe instructed him to go to the store number on Route Lafayette to alter the Japanese goods' brand names. This batch of goods was bought from the Japanese Godai Yarn Factory machine room, totaling thirty-nine packages of white twill, each package containing twenty bolts, worth 160 taels of silver. Manager Wang Xungu, who is also one of the shareholders, handled all the incoming goods. The current accountant is boss Deng Zhonghe's nephew, Zhang Ajin, also known as Zhang Houqin, who is acting as an agent. Since I joined the store in September, a total of three batches of Japanese cloth have been purchased from the Japanese Godai foreign firm, including the goods seized this time. The first two batches have already been sold. The Wusong Shiquan Factory also has similar cases of altered Japanese goods. Deng Zhonghe of Daqing Store privately imported Japanese goods. An order was given to investigate and detain him at any time. Unexpectedly, Deng Zhonghe did not know how to repent and dared to weave a secret agency to store a large amount of Japanese goods. He really had no conscience. According to the previous confession, members were sent to Wusong Shiquan Factory and Daqing Cloth Store's Fu'an Company for investigation. According to the report, the serge and other goods woven by Wusong Shiquan Factory in the past were all made of Japanese yarn raw materials, but the raw materials for the twill cloth currently woven were definitely not Japanese goods. Now, the Wusong Inspection Office has marked the twill cloth and the factory has issued a receipt, responsible for保管, and brought back a bolt of twill cloth for filing. Also, there is no Fu'an Company in Daqing Cotton Cloth Store. Fu'an Company is Daqing Cloth Store's pseudonym, specially set up for selling altered Japanese cloth. The manager and boss of the store are both Deng Zhonghe, and there is no so-called Wang Xungu. The store's acting accountant, Zhang Ajin, also known as Zhang Houqin, was brought to the meeting along with four account books for inquiry. According to Zhang Houqin, he is from Jiangyin and works as an accountant. Boss Deng Zhonghe lives at No. 1760, 克能海路, Haining Road. He is in the store every day. Daqing Store was established solely by him for seven or eight years. The boss takes care of the incoming goods himself. He usually buys a lot of Japanese goods. As far as I know, the Japanese goods he purchases are all 　brand of Jianshan Factory. All counterfeit Jianshan Factory brands are printed by the boss himself. Hu Shengsheng is a friend of the Jianshan Factory owner. He is now a runner at the Lixing Transportation Company and also runs the Yongxing坯布Company. He usually delivers Japanese goods for the boss. There are also 18 packages of twill in the store, each worth about 160 taels of silver. Fu'an Company is a hypothetical company. In fact, it is 入庆. He buys goods from Japanese merchants, Shanghai Nissin, Dongmian, and 江商伊籘factories. The number of Japanese goods imported each month is about 3,000 to 4,000 bolts, worth more than 20,000 taels of silver. Except for Zhang Houqin who was released on bail, a joint report was submitted. According to the resolution of the 15th Executive Committee meeting of the association (see the meeting minutes), the association has now implemented the case separately and advised citizens, banks, and money houses not to deal with Deng Zhonghe's factory.</p>
<p>▲ Warning to Chinese Employees of康泰Company to Resign: The Municipal Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to康泰Insurance Company yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, According to a secret report, the康泰Insurance Company at No. 18, The Bund, is ostensibly a British company but is actually a branch of the Japanese Tokyo丸Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., funded entirely by Japanese. At this time of intense anti-Japanese sentiment, the company still has a large number of Chinese employees who have not resigned and are still entrenched in it, assisting the evildoers. We request that your association order them to resign immediately and notify the merchants who have insured with the company to immediately withdraw their insurance, etc. After the association sent personnel to investigate and confirm that the report was true, they replied to the association. Therefore, it is the common will of the compatriots across the country to sever economic relations with Japan. All Chinese nationals should act in good conscience, sacrifice themselves, and follow this together. Since the康泰Insurance Company is funded by the Japanese, if our Chinese employees do not resign immediately, and if all sectors continue to associate with it, it will be violating the public will and undermining the anti-Japanese cause. Based on the previous report, we urgently warn the Chinese employees to resign immediately to avoid being abandoned by the public. To 康泰Insurance Company."</p>
<p>▲ Propaganda Department's Enemy Goods Identification Center Established: The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, in order to make it easier for the public to identify enemy goods, has established an Enemy Goods Identification Center to collect and display various enemy goods. Letters have been sent to various trade associations to collect them on their behalf. The East Village Trade Inspection Group of this city has already sent a batch of enemy goods samples to the department, which are currently temporarily displayed within the department. Once the house is renovated, it will be moved immediately. Many sets of art slides that were previously produced have been distributed to this city's New Ellen, Odeon, New Central,中華,恩派亞, Mingzhu, Yongan, Shanghai Grand Theater, Beijing, 大世界, Central, 先施新新, Mingxing,閘北, Fu'an, 光華,卡德, and other cinemas to show patriotic ladies, and it is definitely worth seeing.

<h3>Canada Lifts Some Restrictions on Imports of Livestock Products</h3>
<p>▲ Canned Food with Grade A Certificates Allowed to be Imported</p>
<p>▲ However, the Import of Ham and Cured Meat Still Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Livestock by-products transported from our country to Canada were previously banned from import because the government did not implement pre- and post-slaughter inspections. The Canadian government believed that they were harmful to hygiene. Recently, Consul General Li Xianzhang, stationed in Canada, stated that the Ministry of Industry of our country has established commodity inspection bureaus in various important ports. All livestock by-products exported have been inspected by veterinarians before and after slaughter, and there are no health concerns. He negotiated with the Canadian Department of Agriculture to request that the previous order prohibiting the import of livestock by-products from our country be revoked. The Canadian Department of Agriculture has now replied that in the future, all livestock by-products transported from Shanghai that have been inspected by veterinarians of the Inspection Bureau before and after slaughter, and given Grade A certificates, and have been cooked and canned, will be allowed to be imported. A formal letter has been sent to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the bureau has sent letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various canned food companies in Shanghai, so that those who are interested in engaging in foreign trade can report the canned livestock products for inspection and transport them to Canada. The Canadian government has not yet allowed the import of ham casings and cured meat because of foot-and-mouth disease in Chinese livestock. The bureau believes that the toxicity of foot-and-mouth disease can be eliminated after salting. Ham casings have been salted at high concentrations for a long time, and cured meat has been smoked and exposed to the sun, and there is no possibility of foot-and-mouth disease transmission. Therefore, a letter has been sent to Consul General Li requesting him to negotiate with the Canadian government again based on the reasons, so as to allow imports altogether.</p>

<h3>Another Four Corpses Found in Vacant Land on Xinzha Road</h3>
<p>Only One Corpse Exhumed Yesterday</p>
<p>Excavation to Continue Today</p>
<p>Shudeli Case Now Has Clues</p>
<p>Wang Guowei is a Major Suspect</p>
<p>The sensational case of the Communist Party killing and burying corpses to eliminate traces has been successively discovered in the French Concession on Rue Amiral Froudi, Village Petain, and the Public Concession on Wuding Road, Shudeli. A total of eleven corpses have been exhumed from the two locations. However, according to the confession of Li Longzhang, an accomplice in the case captured in Hankou, a total of nine corpses were buried in Nos. 33 and 37 Village Petain. Only seven have been discovered so far. Unexpectedly, while the search was still underway, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters received an urgent telegram from the Nanjing National Government late at night the day before yesterday, stating that four corpses had also been secretly buried by the Communist Party in the courtyard of a private house near Route Macleod, Xinzha Road, Public Concession. They were ordered to continue digging and discovering them. Yesterday morning, a commissioner from the police station went to survey and discover them. One corpse has now been found. As for the four corpses exhumed from Shudeli on Wuding Road, several major suspects in the case have now been arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Public Concession Police Station. The excavation situation on Xinzha Road yesterday and the arrest of suspects are described in detail below:</p>
<p>▲ National Government Sends Urgent Telegram to Continue Digging for Four Deaths: Since (the 24th) the four corpses of Si Li, Ye Xiaomei, Zhang Xinghua, and Zhang Lu氏were exhumed from No. 6, Shudeli, Wuding Road, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters simultaneously received an urgent telegram from the Nanjing National Government that four corpses were also buried in a private house near Route Macleod, Xinzha Road, Public Concession. They were students from the Suzhou Arts and Crafts School: Zhu Wanbai, Zhu Wanbai's wife, a woman named Zou Zhishu, and a student who studied in Russia, Huang Di-hong, all four of whom were previously members of the Communist Party. They were ordered to cooperate with the police station to search and dig in detail.</p>
<p>▲ Actual Verification of the Location of the Corpses: After receiving the telegram, the headquarters originally intended to excavate the next day, but it was necessary to first clearly survey the burial location before starting. The commissioner and the police station conducted a detailed investigation for a day the day before yesterday and found that the Zhengjia Lane 通麥特赫司脫路in each 通麥特赫司脫路area 通戈登路 通愛文義路and that A new-style building on Xinzha Road happens to be located in the center of the four roads, with the old door number A-91 on Xinzha Road and the new door number A-1095. The main entrance is in the narrow alley of Zhengjia Lane, with a bamboo fence in front. After entering the door for several 武, a building stands in the center, and the site is quite large. The back of the house is a small flower garden, where the corpses are buried.</p>
<p>▲ Excavation All Day Only Yields One Corpse: At about 7 a.m. yesterday morning, the headquarters immediately sent personnel to cooperate with the police station and lead more than ten earthworkers to the First Special District Court, which also sent personnel to monitor the excavation at 8 a.m. First excavate the center, then the west corner. Until 3 p.m., nothing was found. Finally, at about 5 p.m., digging to the northeast corner under the short wall, to a depth of about seven feet, a mat was found. Looking at the mat, it was indeed a corpse. The corpse was very long, with its head to the west and feet to the east. The whole body was naked, and most of the muscles had rotted. After the wind invaded, it turned dark brown. Although there was a smell, it was not as strong as that of Aitang Village. After a little observation, the personnel present ordered the mat to be covered. After the excavation was continued today, it was transported to the autopsy office for inspection. When things were unfinished, it was late, so someone was sent to guard it until everyone left the field, and it was already late at night. At that time, according to Mr. Gu Jianzhong, who was sent by the central government, the corpse was quite similar to Zhu Wanbai, and he said that there was another corpse named Huang Pei, who was probably also inside.</p>
<p>▲ The Tenant of Shudeli Has Been Found: The Public Police Station of the Public Concession has conducted a thorough investigation into the discovery of four male and female corpses in Shudeli on Wuding Road. The case was handled by Hunter, the head of the Western Investigation Department of the Criminal Investigation Department. On the afternoon of the 24th of this month, Mr. Hunter went to the house to inspect and saw that the objects in the house had been moved empty, and only an electric meter from the electric power office had not been removed. The tenant's name, Wang Guowei, was found on the monthly card of the electric meter. It was also learned that the houses in the area were leased by the Shanghai Trust Department of the Continental Bank.</p>
<p>▲ Guarantor Zhang Yi'an Taken to Court: He then went to the Continental Bank to investigate. According to the staff of the Leasing Department, the tenant was indeed named Wang Guowei. At that time, Zhang Yi'an (also known as杏生), the owner of the Taihengyuan Electric Material Company at No. 34, Lloyd Road, Shaoxing, stamped and guaranteed the lease. It was rented from May 7 to August 7 of this year, with a monthly rent of 90 taels of silver. The investigator went to Taihengyuan to visit Zhang Yi'an in the evening but did not meet him. It was not until 8 a.m. the day before yesterday that he met Zhang and took him to the Gordon Road Police Station for temporary detention. He was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Local Court yesterday. Zhang Yi'an hired a lawyer to defend him in court.</p>
<p>▲ The Lease Guarantee Has Been Taken Away: The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stood up and stated the case, saying that the police station had not filed a lawsuit against Zhang Yi'an, but only requested temporary detention for investigation. However, after Zhang was brought into the police station, he was questioned. According to Zhang, although he admitted that the resident of No. 6 Shudeli, Wang Guowei, was guaranteed by him, Wang and he did not know each other. At that time, it was introduced by Dong Weiliang, a relative of his and a bill collector at the 朝鮮 Bank on Jiujiang Road. The police station investigator went to the 朝鮮 Bank to investigate, and Dong denied the introduction. Moreover, the staff of the Continental Bank's Leasing Department also recognized that it was indeed Zhang Yi'an who guaranteed the lease. Therefore, in order to understand Wang Guowei's whereabouts, Zhang should be detained, because Wang is seriously suspected of the murder of one man and three women. All the lease guarantees at that time were said to have been taken back by Wang Guowei himself after the lease was terminated, so they cannot be presented to the court today.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Yi'an Does Not Know Wang Guowei: Next, Hunter, the head of the Western Investigation Department, submitted a detailed report on the above investigation and stated that Wang Guowei had been arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the police station on Haig Road in September of this year and transferred. Because the case was previously handled by the Political Department, he was not very clear about it. When Zhang Yi'an was questioned, he admitted that he guaranteed the lease, which was introduced by Dong Weiliang or Feng Chunpu, because Dong and Feng had entrusted this kind of guarantee, but he could not remember whether Shudeli was introduced by蔵or Feng. Feng has now gone out to work, and his family has also moved to his hometown.</p>
<p>Yu姚 does not know Wang Guowei personally and has never met him.</p>
<p>▲ Continental Bank Staff Testify: A staff member surnamed Mao from the Continental Bank's Leasing Department also stated that Wang Guowei came on May 6 of this year to rent a house in Shudeli. At that time, he gave the drawing to read. According to Wang himself, he was in the gold business. The next day, he paid the rent of 90 taels of silver and gave him a guarantee note, ordering him to find a guarantee. Before long, Wang Yixlai presented the guarantee note. After I read it, I found that it was stamped by Taihengyuan Electric Material Company. I then went to Taihengyuan to verify it and met the manager, Zhang Yi'an, and asked if the guarantee was true, so I allowed him to move in. After the lease was terminated on August 7, Wang sent someone with a letter to take back the guarantee note. Dong Weiliang, another witness, testified that Zhang Yi'an was a nephew of his clan. He had never introduced Wang Guowei to ask him to guarantee the lease. Finally, lawyer Wang Yaotang rose up and requested a postponement so that investigators could go to the Public Security Bureau to investigate Wang Guowei and either detain Zhang Yi'an or allow him to find a major guarantee to go out and look for Feng Chunpu. Judge Feng Shide 核供and ordered the case to be postponed. Zhang Yi'an was ordered to pay 3,000 yuan in cash as bail to wait for further instructions.</p>
<h3>Bandit Yan Jinbiao</h3>
<p>Appeal Still Results in Death Sentence</p>
<p>Bandit Yan Jinbiao, also known as Yan Er, on the afternoon of August 15th of this year, colluded with the fugitive Li Guoren, Yang Jiucheng, and others, and opened fire in the Xinshang New Hotel on Xixin Bridge Street in the French Concession, killing Xia Yongsheng, Chen Yihan, and someone surnamed Xue, resulting in three deaths, and wounding Zhong Ziqing. The case was discovered and apprehended by the French Concession police. It was also found that he had committed three cases of colluding to commit robbery. He was escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and found guilty of robbery, sentenced to imprisonment. The murder charge resulted in the death penalty. Yan refused to accept the sentence and hired a lawyer to petition the Third Branch of the Higher Court for an appeal. Court President Guo Dezhang, together with judges Zhang Chaozuo and Li Changnian, convened a court with Chief Prosecutor Peng Wang, conducted an inquiry, and announced the conclusion of the debate, pending a scheduled judgment. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. Judge Guo, along with judges Zhang and Li, came to the Second Criminal Court and ordered the defendant to be brought to the court, announcing the judgment. The main text overturned the original verdict regarding Yan Jinbiao's crime and punishment. Yan Jinbiao, colluding with three or more people, carrying dangerous weapons for robbery, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Furthermore, colluding with three or more people, carrying dangerous weapons, as a repeat offender for robbery, was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for each count. The premeditated murder charge carried the death penalty, to be carried out. After the sentence was pronounced, the defendant was taken back into custody pending further instructions.</p>

<h3>High Tide in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather has been warm recently, seeming like a small spring. Unexpectedly, a strong northeast wind arose last night. Yesterday morning, the weather suddenly turned from warm to cold, and the tide surged due to the strong northeast wind. The tide reached a height of thirty-eight feet. The tide in the Wusong Yunzaobang Canal was level with the road. Low-lying areas on the south bank of the Yunzaobang Canal were flooded by the tide, turning the fields around Yangjiazhai into a swamp. Fortunately, the duration was short, and the tide receded quickly, so no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Li Jiazheng</h3>
<p>Divorce from Zhang Jinjiang</p>
<p>Li Jiazheng subsidizes Zhang Jinjiang's return home with 5,500 yuan. After the peaceful resolution of the property division case between Li Jiazheng, the great-granddaughter of the late Qing dynasty statesman Li Hongzhang, and Li Jia, it is now known that both parties in the marriage issue between Li Jiazheng and Zhang Jinjiang, although having requested the First Special District Court to suspend the litigation, had never completely resolved it. It is now known that the parties have signed a divorce agreement through their lawyers, effectively severing their relationship. The agreement stipulates that Li Jiazheng will subsidize Zhang Jinjiang's return home expenses with 5,500 yuan in silver, to be paid in three installments, with the final payment due on April 24th of next year. Regarding Li Jiazheng's belongings, utensils, and clothing in the Xianyi Lane residence, they must be returned within seven days after the agreement is signed. From then on, the two parties will be divorced. This case, which has been in litigation for nearly half a year, can now be said to be completely concluded.</p>

<p>Swindling and Deceiving in Nanshi and Zhabei</p>
<p>It has been found that in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas, there are people impersonating engineering personnel from the Public Works Bureau, specializing in swindling and deceiving. The Public Works Bureau has repeatedly issued notices explaining that its employees all carry employee identification cards, and those inspecting engineering projects outside even wear shield-shaped inspection badges, making them easy to identify. If encountering fake impersonators, people should arrest them and hand them over to the police, or report them to the bureau for arrest and prosecution. However, most citizens are afraid of trouble, and even if they are extorted, they have to admit their misfortune.</p>
<p>There is no one who will stand up to report the matter, resulting in the authorities having difficulty obtaining evidence and making it difficult to investigate. These swindlers are becoming increasingly rampant and unscrupulous. Recently, Lei Wenkui and Xu Yaosheng were arrested by the First District Police Station due to a dispute over spoils among their accomplices, leading to the leakage of information. Under interrogation, Lei and Xu both confessed to impersonating inspectors from the Public Works Bureau. In total, they have committed dozens of cases, which is truly astonishing. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau, recognizing the First District Police Station's effective investigation and being the first to solve the case, specially prepared a reward of 100 yuan and delivered it to the police station yesterday to be given to the officers involved. The Public Works Bureau also requested the police station to issue a notice to its subordinates to diligently cooperate in apprehending impersonators who swindle and deceive, in order to eliminate this scourge of society.</p>
<h3>No Refusal to Pay Bus Fare Under the Pretext of National Affairs</h3>
<p>Joint Proclamation by the Municipal Government and Other Organizations</p>
<p>Recently, some citizens participating in the national salvation movement have refused to pay bus fares when riding Chinese-owned public buses, leading to disputes. The Municipal Government, upon receiving reports, has issued a joint proclamation with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Garrison Headquarters to strictly prohibit such behavior. The proclamation reads as follows: Regarding the matter of issuing a joint proclamation, it has been reported that recently, citizens participating in the national salvation movement often refuse to pay bus fares when riding Chinese-owned public buses. If inspectors or ticket sellers question them, disputes often arise, severely impacting the business. They have requested that measures be taken to maintain transportation, etc. Upon investigation, the enthusiasm of all sectors in running the affairs of the country is indeed commendable. However, this cannot be a reason to refuse to pay bus fares. The reported situations are indeed true. In addition to instructing the Education, Social Affairs, and Public Security Bureaus to persuade and strictly prohibit such behavior, we hereby issue a joint proclamation. Hereafter, all people, regardless of organization, when riding public buses and trams, must purchase tickets at the prescribed price, unless they hold a free pass or have obtained special permission from the company. No one may refuse to pay bus fares under the pretext of national affairs, causing harm to the transportation industry. Those who persist in resisting under false pretenses, once discovered, the ticket inspectors and sellers are authorized to arrest them according to the law, without leniency. Everyone must comply, without fail.</p>

<h3>County Gentlemen Qin Xitian and Others</h3>
<p>Petition the Province to Waive Land Price Increases</p>
<p>Shanghai County gentlemen Qin Xitian, Li Zuyou, Qian Jiao, Huang Yunzhen, Jin Qingzhang, Niu Yongxiang, and others, due to the Shanghai County government's abrupt decision to increase land prices, yesterday jointly petitioned the province to waive the increase. The text states: "Petitioning for the sake of impoverished people and cheap land, making land price increases difficult; requesting reconsideration and correction; attaching our humble views, and praying for their adoption." The Jiangsu Provincial Government Gazette of October 7th of this year published the minutes of the 440th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. The Finance Department presented a report stating that the original land prices in Shanghai County were not comprehensive enough. The meeting re-evaluated them and submitted the minutes of the meeting and a proportional table for verification. It was found that although each item had increased compared to the original price, the assessed prices were generally consistent with the land prices of neighboring counties. The question was whether to approve the final decision. The resolution was to approve. The people of the entire county were deeply shocked upon hearing this. The county government, suffering from the financial difficulties of the County Party Headquarters and construction expenditures, decided at the county government meeting to raise land prices in order to increase levies. Peng Zhaotang, the district chief of the Second District, based on the opinions of the township chiefs, petitioned the county magistrate to maintain the original prices, but this was not approved. It can be seen that the county government's actions violate public opinion. We believe that the increase or decrease in land prices must be based on the land's productivity as a standard. Since the division of the city and county of Shanghai, the six districts belonging to the county are all farmland, and all grow cotton. In a normal year, each acre of land yields 100 catties of cotton, worth 14 or 15 yuan. After deducting 30% for fertilizer and 30% for labor costs, the net profit is only 6 yuan, while bearing a tax of 1 yuan and 50 cents. Even without a bad harvest, the people's strength is still precarious. This is the first reason why prices cannot be increased. Private land sales range from 100 yuan for the higher-priced land to 60 or 70 yuan for the lower-priced land. The county government recently purchased land in the Beiqiao area at a price of 90 yuan per acre. The land is all farmland, but the price increase is nearly half. Its incompatibility with the facts can be seen. This is the second reason why prices cannot be increased. The county government uses the rice land of Songjiang County as a comparison, but it does not know that Songjiang grows rice, so the rent per mu is 8 or 9 yuan, while our county grows cotton, so the rent is only 5 yuan. Comparing the incomes, this is the third reason why prices cannot be increased. Moreover, the land in the Shanghai Municipal areas of Hunan and Zhabei is worth more than 100,000 yuan per mu for the expensive land and around 10,000 yuan for the cheap land, but the collection of tax and transport labor is still based on the old system. Comparing that to this is inevitably unfair. This is the fourth reason why prices cannot be increased. In short, trying to increase revenue by arbitrarily increasing land prices is blatant extortion and oppression. Making decisions unilaterally without consulting the opinions of the local people is autocratic and tyrannical. Under the clear blue sky and the white sun flag, should this be allowed? If the Party Headquarters' finances are not sufficient, the Party members should be self-sufficient with the dues they pay and the income tax they receive, as has been clearly stipulated by the Central Government. The County Party Headquarters' use of the funds of the old County Council and the Consultative Council has already been ordered by the Finance Department to be allocated. This should not burden the local area. Moreover, the Party members are all local elites and will be able to understand the poverty of the local area and reduce expenses. There is no reason to enrich themselves by exploiting the people. As for construction, the six districts of the county are located on both sides of the Huangpu River. Dozens of sailboats and steamships dock on the river every day. Moreover, the Shangnan Company in Pudong and the Humin Company in Puxi have both begun operating steamships. Water and land transportation is extremely convenient, so there is no need for new construction. We are declining and unable to contribute to the current situation, but we are saddened by the poverty and suffering of our children and fear that the situation below will not be communicated upwards, causing the people-loving kindness of our provincial government to be unrealized, and the plundering and gathering of wealth to become a slander of the county government. This is what we are worried about day and night and cannot remain silent about. Therefore, we are specially listing the facts and asking the chairman of the provincial government to adopt our humble opinions, submit them to the committee for reconsideration, and cancel the resolution of Shanghai County to re-set land prices. The people of the county will be deeply grateful, and it is what we sincerely pray for.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Orders Subordinates</h3>
<p>Actively Plan and Build Connecting Highways</p>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association believes that highways should be built alongside railway stations to facilitate transportation and connect railways and highways, linking longitude and latitude lines. The Secretary-General, Wu Shan, drafted a proposal and sent it to the Ministry of Railways, requesting that it be circulated to all railway administrations for adoption and implementation. It is now learned that the ministry has replied in agreement. Excerpts of the correspondence are as follows: The Road Association's letter to the Ministry of Railways: Respectfully, railways and highways are inherently interdependent and mutually beneficial, facilitating transportation and increasing revenue. Railways are suitable for long-distance, heavy-duty transport, while highways are advantageous for light, convenient, and fast travel. Wherever railway longitude lines are built, highway latitude lines should be connected. Building roads alongside railway stations in cities, towns, and villages will make it easier for people and goods to disperse and gather, and for local areas to prosper. European and American countries have already seen significant results, which can be learned from. If there are only railway longitude lines without highway latitude lines to assist them, transportation near the railways will be difficult, people and goods will be difficult to concentrate, and travelers will find it inconvenient. Our association has been promoting public works for more than ten years, and especially advocates building highways to connect cities and towns, so that transportation is convenient along the railway stations. We have specially drafted a proposal and sent it to your ministry, requesting that it be circulated to all railway administrations for adoption and implementation. In the future, with the completion of highways and the development of business along the railways, the increase in public and private revenue will be of great benefit to the country and the people. All the people of the country will be grateful for your great favor. The Ministry of Railways' reply stated: The ministry has approved your association's letter and the enclosed proposal from Wu Shan, instructing all railway administrations to adopt and implement it. Upon investigation, railways and highways are inherently complementary. If they can be connected and mutually beneficial, the benefits to transportation will be significant. However, local highways should be planned and built by the local areas themselves. As for the railways, they should provide as much convenience as possible within their capabilities. In addition to instructing the construction departments of each province to actively plan and build connecting highways, and instructing all railways to provide assistance whenever local areas request it, we hereby reply to your association, for your information.</p>

<h3>Nanshi Trade Unions</h3>
<p>Declaration of Support for the Workers of the Dadong Bookstore</p>
<p>The First District Water and Electricity Industry Workers' Union, Shanghai Newspaper Industry Union, Shanghai Newspaper Delivery Industry Occupational Union, Shanghai Shoe Industry Union, Bone and Dental Instrument Industry Union, Second District Cleaning Industry Union, Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union, Hat Making Industry Union, Silk Waste Industry Union, Ninth District Woodworking Industry Union, First District Cotton Textile Industry Occupational Union, Pharmacy Industry Union, First District Shipbuilding Industry Union, Incense Industry Occupational Union, First District Knitting Industry Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Occupational Union, Toothbrush Union, Silk Gloss Office, Municipal Ink Making Industry Union, Municipal Dyeing Industry Union, Ninth District Cement Industry Union, and Hotel Reception Industry Union issued a declaration yesterday, stating: To all workers and compatriots in the city: The workers of the Dadong Bookstore office of the Publishing Industry Union, due to the management's lack of sincerity in negotiating improved treatment terms, and for the sake of their own livelihood, were forced to hold a meeting and decide to strike collectively. Their behavior is a legitimate act of self-defense. Their needs are all for maintaining the most basic of livelihoods. People of society and the party and government authorities should show sympathy for their plight, come forward to uphold justice, and quickly mediate. However, they have not done so. Therefore, since the strike began, the management's arrogance has increased, and their attitude has been tough. Moreover, because it is within the concession area, it cannot be prevented by legal means or by seeking a quick solution. The cruelty of the management is also increasing day by day, causing the Dadong Bookstore workers to reach their limit. It even appears that the management will place each of them in the realm of unemployment. The cold, hunger, and misery that will follow are truly a sight to behold. The trade unions, based on the justice of human mutual assistance and adhering to the principle of no favoritism and no destruction, in addition to sending representatives to express condolences to the Dadong Bookstore workers, hereby solemnly declare that we will provide them with spiritual and material assistance, hoping that they will fight to the end to achieve victory. We hope that all workers and compatriots will express their sympathy and provide assistance together.</p>
<h3>Status of Land Sale at Yu Qi Righteous Clan Trust</h3>
<p>When someone went to the office to inquire about the opening of bids for the land belonging to the Shengshi Yu Qi Righteous Clan Charitable Foundation, they were told that no one had made an offer, so the bids could not be opened. The following Q&amp;A with Committee Member Ye was witnessed: (Question) The newspaper reported that your office was opening bids. Has it been held? (Answer) Because no one has made an offer, the bids have not been opened. (Question) Given the excellent location of all the land and the reduced minimum price set this time, why is there no interest? (Answer) The Righteous Clan Trust's land all has excellent locations, and the minimum bid price has been carefully considered by the trust's directors, taking into account the current land market situation. It is not considered high. However, the money market is tight, and people are restless, so those who invest in real estate are hesitant. (Question) What are the plans for the future? (Answer) Selling the trust's land is a predetermined step, and it will continue to be carried out. In the future, if anyone is willing to purchase the land, they can still contact the office, so that the trust's debts can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Issuance of National Product Certificates</h3>

After review, it will be issued. The corresponding application form is attached with this letter, please check it.</p>
<h3>Notice from the National Medicine Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association issued a notice yesterday to strictly urge its members to fill in the business tax amount and to order all non-member businesses to join the association. The notice stated: Regarding the matter of notification, regarding the business tax payment matter of our industry, the city chamber of commerce sent multiple filling forms to the association, and the association attached the forms and sent them to each member, asking them to fill them in in detail and send them to the association within a time limit for reporting to the city chamber of commerce in order to facilitate collection. Now, most members have filled in and sent the business tax form to the association as scheduled, but there are still quite a few who are waiting and seeing and have not filled it in. The business tax is a legitimate tax for national income. The government is still worried about insufficient compensation for the abolition of likin duties. How can our businessmen arbitrarily delay it, which hinders tax revenue? Moreover, the inquiries are strict, and the deadline is approaching, which is even more inconvenient if the tax law is violated. Therefore, we specially solemnly notify all members to quickly fill in the business tax form sent by the association and send it to the association within five days. Do not delay any longer. If the original form is lost, you can come to the association to get a replacement. Colleagues who have not joined the association are also expected to report their names to join the association so that they can request the form to fill in. The business tax of the entire city's pharmaceutical industry is under the unified management of the association, so colleagues who have not joined the association urgently need to join the association according to law, otherwise it is impossible to protect themselves.</p>

<h3>To the Letter of the All-China National Products Promotion League Committee</h3>
<p>Cheng Yigeng</p>
<p>(Above omitted) I believe that woolen flannel and rayon are continuously imported and fill the market, while our famous world silk fabric, the first country in production, the title was captured, money is spilled outside the body fat is exhausted, If this continues, the country will not be a country. Since the eastward spread of Europeanization, Chinese people imitate Western suits. The materials used are nothing but woolen flannel. Those who wear it are all the intellectual class of our country. Why is the heart of patriotism lower than others? It is nothing more than that the Japanese robes are cumbersome and not as convenient and economical as short clothes, but discarding domestic products and using foreign goods is not enough to be a lesson. At this time of national crisis, resisting Japan and saving the country, people have the same heart but resisting this and not resisting that, money is still spilled outside, and national salvation is still not thorough, so the promotion of domestic products is indeed in a precarious situation. I think that for world costumes, that is, (Western suits), Zhongshan suits, student suits, and other short clothes, since there are no equivalent products for the raw materials for the time being, please ask the association to require administrative agencies, schools, and groups to painfully think that the country is half dead. For Western suits and short clothes, do not seek excellent and upright standards for the time being, and replace them with Zhejiang's Hangzhou silk, Hangzhou satin, and Suzhou's plain satin for Western suits. Silk satin Western suits may not be absolutely impossible. On the one hand, ask the National Products Maintenance Association to immediately invite the silk industry groups in Su, Hang, Hu, and Pu to unite and select hard silk satin (discard rayon) to make Western suits and short clothes. All silk industry gentlemen, from the owner to the manager, friends and apprentices, must first take the lead in promoting and using them to set an example. Although it seems to be a special case at the beginning, if many people wear it, it will be commonplace and not surprising, or even follow suit. Don't you see that Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd.'s (212) flannel has been vigorously promoted through its advertising, and the staff and friends first made it into Western suits, so it attracted party and government schools to buy and wear them as Western suits. By analogy, who said that silk satin can never be made into Western suits and short clothes? If you say that it is limited by economic earth cloth, it may also be used as a substitute. Furthermore, in recent years, the psychology of Chinese people welcoming silk satin to be remodeled into Western suits has been seen in newspapers from time to time. Why can't the silk satin industry gentlemen set an example themselves? I can't rest in silence. I dare to ask the silk industry leaders to shift their eyes to follow the trend, quickly solicit colleagues, unite together, determine to sacrifice, first implement, use silk satin as Western suits to save the silk industry that is on the verge of collapse, and the national economy and people's livelihood are beneficial. As for those who are used to wearing robes and jackets, once they switch to Western suits, not only are they unaccustomed to it, but also the wearing and removing procedures are quite troublesome. It is better to switch to students' and Zhongshan clothes, which are simple and easy to wear and remove (below omitted)</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read the report in your newspaper on the 22nd of this month that the Mint will hold a opening ceremony on New Year's Day next year, and that Director Guo will go to Beijing in the coming days to ask for instructions. After checking, our factory has not yet received a clear order to open. The information published in your newspaper is probably based on hearsay. I hope you will publish it in the Letter to the Editor column. Sincerely, Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Central Mint, November 25th.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Gao Guanwu and Others Discuss Ten Reasons Why Our Country Can Fight</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>We are soldiers in the opposition, with the duty to bear arms and plan for the country. It is not our place to overstep our authority, but we believe that there are reasons why we can fight. With ten reasons, we will not necessarily be defeated, and even if we are defeated, we will not necessarily perish. In general, the most important element of war is military personnel. China has a large population, and with years of internal war, ordinary people have a slight understanding of the actual situation of war. Between the Huai River and the Northwest provinces, one or two out of ten are proficient in using firearms. When fighting against Japan, we are not worried about a shortage of soldiers. This is one reason why we can fight. China has a vast territory, dozens of times larger than the Japanese mainland. In case of emergency, the army can be concentrated and dispersed, divided and moved easily. Even if the navy is not as strong, we can defend the hinterland along the river, and we can defend the stepped terrain instead of the plains. When France was in the midst of the European War, it abandoned Paris and wanted to move the capital to Bordeaux. The entire territory of Belgium fell, and the capital was sent to Calais, France. If China has a vast territory of thousands of miles, it has plenty of room to advance and retreat. This is two reasons why we can fight. Because China's hinterland has inconvenient transportation and many obstacles, and the climates in the north and south are different, it is difficult to cross the mountains and passes. We can go, but the enemy may not be able to go. We can defend, but the enemy may not be able to attack. Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi have high mountains and dangerous ridges, making transportation difficult. The fall of the Song and Ming dynasties lasted for a long time. Today's war is expected to last for months. If we can defend without winning, they will also be trapped. This is three reasons why we can fight. In recent times, popular sentiment has been aroused. Young people, even peddlers and hawkers, have vowed to perish with Japan. If we can guide and encourage them, and unite against the enemy, most of the people in the country can be used. The brave will contribute their strength, the rich will donate their wealth, the speakers will argue, the wise will devise plans, and farmers and workers will provide assistance, transportation, rescue, and protection. All of these can be done. This is four reasons why we can fight. The general trend of diplomacy depends on popular sentiment. If the Chinese government and people can work together to resist aggression, other countries will never help the wicked, and will watch from the sidelines to test the spirit of the Chinese nation. Moreover, Japan's unreasonable occupation and the conflict started with them. The truth is known to all. Justice prevails, and there may be someone to uphold it. This is five reasons why we can fight. The Chinese people are hardworking and enduring. The average monthly salary of the army is no more than six or seven yuan. Those who are lacking are paid 30 to 50 cents a day for oil and vegetables, and coarse rice and flour, which is only enough to cover their expenses. They can still eat wind and dew and serve on the battlefield. The Northwest Army and the Qian, Gui armies do not get enough to eat every day, and they only pay two or three thousand dollars a month for shaving and washing money. They are already considered to be well-fed troops. Compared with Japanese soldiers, we have easy supply and they have difficult supply, and our soldiers are good and theirs are bad. This is six reasons why we can fight. China is an agricultural country. Once the war starts, except for the areas where the war is raging, the crops will suffer considerable damage. However, other workers will not be worried about strikes, merchants will not be worried about market closures, and the unemployed will not be worried about increasing. All goods are barely self-sufficient. Those who usually use foreign goods are wary of national destruction and family ruin, and they will save money and food. Only weapons are still lacking, but there are machine repair and bullet manufacturing plants everywhere. All the guns owned by civilians and outlaws will serve the country. This is seven reasons why we can fight. Japan has a small territory and a dense population. In Korea and Taiwan, there are many patriots who are seeking independence every day. Their agricultural income cannot be self-sufficient, and commerce and shipping have always regarded China as their outlet. When there is no war, they have already suffered greatly from the boycott of Japanese goods. Once the war starts, they will inevitably be devastated and their economy will be exhausted. The number of ronin is increasing every day. We can last for a long time, but they cannot. This is eight reasons why we can fight. For more than ten years, internal disputes have occurred from time to time, and there has been war every year due to political disputes, which has consumed national power and degraded production to a great extent. Now, the internal disputes within the party have not completely disappeared. Looking back at Japan, the Seiyukai and the Minseito were not always at odds with each other, and the Japanese Minseito and our Kuomintang were not always in harmony. But to this day, they are all putting pressure on China, and there is no difference in their trend. If the Chinese government and people can unite against foreign enemies, internal disputes will be quelled from now on, and the party, government, army, and people will be more closely connected. This is nine reasons why we can fight. It is undeniable that domestic banditry is due to poor politics and the decline of industry, as well as frequent disturbances in recent years. Firearms are scattered among the people, and there are many veterans. The unemployed gather to become bandits. If we can use them, encourage them, and strictly reward and punish them, we can drive the dead to the national crisis and eliminate the banditry in the invisible. This is ten reasons why we can fight. With these ten essentials, we cannot but fight. It is essential to first pacify the country, then repel the foreign invaders. We have no other choice. We have learned martial arts since childhood and belong to the military. We believe that the three most valuable battles in China in recent times are: First, the Xinhai Revolution to overthrow the Qing Dynasty; second, the battles against Yuan in the second, fourth, and fifth years of the Republic of China; and third, the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China. The Xinhai Revolution was for racial revolution, the battles against Yuan were against dictatorship, and the Northern Expedition was to eliminate warlords. All of them participated in them personally, braved bullets, marched thousands of miles, and never cared about life and death. Other than that, the gains and losses of chickens and insects, defeat is certainly humiliating, but victory is also glorious. Therefore, today's matter is to fight for honor and disgrace for history, to fight for life and death for the nation, and to fight for survival and death for the country. Its importance is even greater than the three battles. Premier Sun Yat-sen initiated the revolution because he did not want to lose the great mountains and rivers to the hands of the Manchus. Now we take it from the Manchus and lose it to our people, which will be a shame for all ages and leave us speechless. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up, and the soldiers of the whole country will be proud of resisting foreign aggression and ashamed of living in peace. Then, even if the national destiny is at stake, there is hope for revival and renewal. There is a saying in the Book of Changes: Its destruction, its destruction, is tied to the mulberry tree. The responsibility of everyone is where the survival of the country lies. I am writing this with grief and wish to tell it to my patriotic citizens. Gao Guanwu, Hong Zhongkai, Qi Wenhua, Xu Shixiang, Chen Weixin, He Mengru, Zheng Shaozhen, Chen Zuyi, Shen Yuchun, Ding Bingkun, Xu Huiren, Jiang Xilin, Qiu Peixin, Hu Gongliang, Cheng Chuanlu, Yang Chao, Ding Dingyi, Bao Dounan, Yuan Yangshan, Gu Zengwei, Zhang Desen, Wang Keming, Bi Yaohua, Zhou Gangshan, Yang Qingjing Zhou Jianwu, Jin Luwang, Ren Datong, Zhou Wuqi, Hou Gongran, Wu Fengshan, He Zhong, Sun Jiqing, Nie Xitang, and others respectfully kowtow, (End)</p>

<h3>Memories of the Ivory Beam</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>In the middle of the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, the coastal areas to the left of the Pudong, such as Nanhui, Baoshan, Chuansha, and Jinshan, were ravaged by Japanese pirates. Their cruel acts of killing and looting are detailed in various notebooks, which cannot be fully recorded. However, my county (Nanhui) has the most historical sites for defending against Japanese pirates. Because at that time, Qi Jiguang stationed his troops at Huijiao. It is said that the two Huichengs were built by the Qi clan, while the first to eleventh ramparts were fire ramparts for defending against Japanese pirates, built along the coast. They were built ten miles apart, and soldiers were stationed there. Upon seeing Japanese ships, they lit fires as signals to coordinate with each other. Qi Jiguang trained his troops very strictly. The Mandarin Duck Formation he formed had two soldiers standing back to back, fighting their own battles, killing enemies and breaking through formations. They were unstoppable. The Japanese pirates were defeated several times and sailed away. However, they came to rob and plunder again every autumn and winter. The villagers deeply hated them, so they trained people's militias and fishing groups to resist the Japanese pirates. The ancestral elders in Zhoupu said that the nearby Japanese pirate tombs are all made up of remains of pirates killed by civilian militias, with corpses all over the ground, gathered and buried there. There is also a legend that the Japanese pirates occupied people's homes at that time, ordering every ten households to share all kitchen knives. The people hated them to the bone. On New Year's Eve, they pretended to eat wontons with vegetables and meat, poured them with wine, and killed them while they were drunk. They dug pits to bury them. It is unknown which of the two versions is true. In addition to the people's militias and fishing groups, there were also monk groups and beggar groups. The monk groups were formed by the monk Yuechan, and the beggar groups were formed by a man named Wang from the county. Yuechan's military exploits were especially remarkable. Every time they formed teams to resist the enemy, they relied entirely on Shaolin martial arts to defeat more with less. More than two thousand Japanese pirates were killed. The Japanese pirates held a grudge. When the Japanese pirates invaded in large numbers, no large jungle was spared. Wang, the leader of the beggar group, was quite resourceful. He won many battles by surprise. The local officials reported the situation to the court. By imperial decree, he was appointed as a guard commander. Wang resigned from the position and fled to Puxi, still living his simple life of begging from door to door, and did not want to sell his name for reputation. Alas, Wang is an example to be followed.</p>
<p>Besides the imperial court, who else speaks of the discussion and compilation of the garden state?</p>
<h3>Krupp's View of Money</h3>
<p>Krupp was a German mega-millionaire. His wealth came from the cannons he manufactured. If there is such a thing as blood money in the world, then Krupp could be considered the king of blood money. However, in his heart, Germany surpassed everything, and money only occupied a secondary position. Before the European war, someone asked him what he wanted so much money for. He said that everything he owned belonged to Germany. Cosmopolitanists would certainly not be satisfied with this answer. If the questioner were a cosmopolitanist, then Krupp would definitely encounter the counter-question: "Why not belong to all of humanity?" But looking at it from another perspective, wasn't Krupp seeing further than those who say, "Everything I have belongs only to me"? Do wealthy people in China during times of national crisis have this kind of vision? This is a short poem I wrote for Krupp:</p>
<p>"Krupp, Krupp, does your treasure bear the name Krupp? No need to ask! Every bit belongs to the Fatherland!" (Note)</p>
<p>We shouldn't regard money as too important, because there are things above money that are greater. We also shouldn't regard money as too insignificant, because money should be used to do great things.</p>
<p>Small Note: Germans call their homeland "Fatherland."</p>
<h3>Patriotic Marriage</h3>
<p>— Ji Guan</p>
<p>The national crisis is in full swing. All men with a sense of honor are rising up, exerting their strength to resist foreign aggression. As a result, many people are traveling long distances to join the army, eager to wield weapons to defend their country. My friend's relative, Mr. Jin Shutang from the Jin family, is one of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin is a native of Jianning in Fujian. In the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], he went to Japan to study, graduating from the Army Officer School. He once served as a battalion or company commander in a certain division in Southern Guangdong. Disheartened by the internal strife, he eventually left and went elsewhere, eventually ending up in the capital, where he took a position in a certain organization. Mr. Jin is only in his early twenties. In Beijing, he found a lover who was a middle school student, also from Fujian. On weekends and holidays, they would often stroll together by Xuanwu Lake and in the Xiushan Garden. Recently, due to his parents' orders, he was urged to get married quickly. So, he borrowed the Central Hotel and held his wedding ceremony last month. At that time, the brutal Japanese invaders were rampant, and bad news arrived frequently. Jin, a patriotic young man, had a discussion with his lover. A clause was specially attached to the marriage contract, stating that after the marriage, if either party had any patriotic actions, the other party should not create obstacles based on personal feelings. The lady readily agreed to the contract. It is said that it has been over a month since the wedding. Mr. Jin received news of the peril in Heilongjiang Province. (The friend said that Qiqihar had not yet fallen.) He set off northward, fulfilling the patriotic action in the marriage contract. It is said that the lady, gazing at the moon from her building, couldn't bear for her husband to be a soldier on a long campaign. She is about to follow his footsteps, so that she can fulfill her patriotic duty as a woman. If so, then a couple joining the army would be a great story of the time, and the patriotic marriage contract would be immortal.</p>
<h3>The Generous and Heroic Hangzhou Women's Parade</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fantong</p>
<p>The brutal Japanese invaders entered and occupied the Eastern Provinces. When the news spread, the whole country was indignant. Major cities across the country established anti-Japanese associations one after another and organized volunteer armies. The people's spirit was aroused as never before. And the women's circles in various places also rose up courageously, vowing to resist Japan to the death. Female heroes are not inferior to men. Recently, the women from all walks of life in Hangzhou initiated the Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress. Women's schools, factories, and dozens of other groups participated, with more than 5,000 people. At that time, heroines gathered, filled with indignation. The speeches and warnings of the day are excerpted below.</p>
<p>The speeches by Madam Yue Fei's Mother and Madam Liang, with Ms. Xu Bijun as chairperson, cited Yue Fei's mother and Madam Liang as encouragement. The words were very earnest. The gist of the speeches was: Yue Fei's mother and Liang Hongyu, the wife of Han Shizhong, are both heroines of the women's circles in our country and can be models for us. Although we women cannot personally go to the battlefield and kill the enemy on horseback, the responsibility of rescue and care is unavoidable and undeniable. As for not buying Japanese goods, it is not a difficult thing to do. If we want to achieve equality between men and women, we should do what men can do and bear the responsibilities that men can bear, and so on.</p>
<p>The representative of the Provincial Party Department, Mr. Xiang Dingrong, said that women are in the same position as men in terms of law, society, education, economy, and politics. Therefore, in terms of obligations, they should also bear the same responsibilities as men. Of our 400 million compatriots, women account for half. Now, at the crucial moment of national survival, women should share the responsibility of saving the country with men. It goes without saying. The ancients said, "The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen." In fact, is the rise and fall of the country only the responsibility of every citizen? Now I should change the saying to "The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every compatriot." These words are worthy of contemplation.</p>
<p>Ms. Xiang also cited Hua Mulan and Qiu Jin as encouragement. She said that in our country's history, there was Hua Mulan. Thousands of years ago, when women were not yet liberated, Hua was able to disguise herself as a man with her weak body and join the army for her father. Later, she won military achievements and has been praised as a beautiful story for thousands of years. Recently, like Ms. Qiu Jin of Zhejiang, she devoted herself to the revolution twenty years ago, vowing to save the country. Later, she carried a sharp blade and assassinated Qing officials. Although she unfortunately died, her name of loyalty and courage can be celebrated for thousands of years.</p>
<p>On that day, after the meeting, they marched in formation. The atmosphere was serious and the order was well-maintained. Those who were not used to long walks had yellow sweat on their faces and tired waists and legs. However, they cheered up and seemed to forget their suffering.</p>
<h3>Our Chinese Students Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Young students are the future masters of the country. Everyone knows this. How poisonous are the Japanese, harboring unfathomable intentions. After the fall of Shenyang, intellectuals were the first to be targeted. The detention of Feng Yong is one example. They will stop at nothing to destroy our outstanding compatriots. Recently, I read the Public Opinion Newspaper, which contained a painful account from a returnee from Shenyang about this situation. I translate it into the vernacular for my countrymen with tears, and mourn for the compatriots who died in the Eastern Provinces.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, young students, if they encountered the Japanese army, would be executed without any trial procedure.</p>
<p>There was a great tendency to kill without question. Therefore, those who were brutally killed often did not know the reason for their crime. Those who lived witnessed this kind of terrifying situation, and their hearts were filled with indescribable grief. Therefore, except for important and urgent matters, everyone stayed at home behind closed doors and did not step out. Moreover, the Japanese army established a kind of brutal law, divided into six articles.</p>
<p>(1) Those wearing student uniforms</p>
<p>(2) Those with Western-style hairstyles</p>
<p>(3) Those wearing fountain pens</p>
<p>(4) Those reading Chinese newspapers</p>
<p>(5) Those carrying books</p>
<p>(6) Those traveling in groups of three or more</p>
<p>Those who have one of these six qualifications will be killed without mercy.</p>
<p>Male students, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, all disguised themselves as rural farmers or coolies and fled to other places. But female students suffered. Regardless of beauty, if they were captured by the Japanese army, they would be raped first, and even have their breasts cut off and stabbed in the vagina with bayonets. Therefore, female students had no choice but to flee or die. As for Chinese people who were stabbed or shot by the Japanese army, they were still fortunate in their misfortune. There were also those who were buried alive or burned alive by the Japanese army, or hung by their hands from the beams and beaten severely. The Japanese army would watch their painful struggles from the side, clapping and laughing, taking it as pleasure. How painful!</p>
<p>After the Chinese people were killed, they were not allowed to be collected or anything similar to taking photos. Even pedestrians were not allowed to stare at it. It was as if witnessing the killing of compatriots, they had to turn their heads and flee quickly to avoid it. Otherwise, if they were caught in the sight of the Japanese army, the disaster of death would come immediately. It is because the Japanese army also knows that this kind of inhumane animal behavior is not to be revealed to outsiders.</p>
<h3>The Magnificent Literature (II)</h3>
<p>— Tian You</p>
<p>There aren't no magnificent literary works in ancient China, but there are very few. In the "Three Hundred Poems," there are "Xiao Rong" and "Wu Yi" in the Qin Feng section. The Elegies of Chu are full of beautiful women and fragrant herbs, but they depict the courage of those who died for their country. Most of the Classic of Mountains and Seas is absurd and superstitious, but it contains tragic allegories such as Houyi shooting down the sun, Jingwei filling the sea, and Xing Tian dancing with his shield and axe. These are all famous works from the pre-Qin period. In the Yuefu poems, there is the kind of heroic literature collected in the "Songs Played on Drums and Horns," such as the Qi Yu Song, the Zhe Yangliu Song, the Langya King Song, the Murong Chui Song, the Li Bo Xiao Mei Song, and even the Mulan, which is now known to every woman and child. Although most of the poems are written with delicate feelings for women, there is the Xin Qiji school, and Yue Fei's Man Jiang Hong. As for poetry, there is Lu You. Liang Ren Gong said that he was "nineteen out of twenty poems in the collection are about military music, an unrestrained man for ages". Not long ago, there was Huang Zunxian. The above is just a list of what I know. I've already listed quite a few. But it's useless to simply list the names of writers and the titles of works. Let's briefly introduce Huang Zunxian's magnificent poems here as an example.</p>
<p>Huang Zunxian, styled Gongdu, was from Jiaying Prefecture in the late Qing Dynasty (1848-1905). He wrote eleven volumes of "Poems from the Man's Dwelling." He had both literary talent and cultivation, and he also served as a diplomat for thirty years, visiting Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States. Therefore, he was known as one of the most knowledgeable people at the time. He was a member of the Reform Movement of 1898, so he had a strong desire to change the law and strengthen the country at that time. Later, he failed politically and still wanted to use literature to change customs.</p>
<p>In his collection, such as the Ryukyu Song, the Vietnam Chapter, the Taiwan Journey, and the Korea Journey, each of our country's diplomatic failures is recorded in verse. It can be regarded as a poetic history. His songs "The Song of the Surrendered General," "The Song of General Nie," "The Song of General Du Liao," and "The Song of the Forty-Seven Loyal Retainers of Ako" either satirize cowardice or praise loyalty and courage. They are all excellent works. And the most magnificent is his military song and the song that school students sing in harmony.</p>
<p>Let's read his "Taiwan Journey" now, because the past events of Taiwan can serve as a warning for us and are the best mirror for us to compare.</p>

<h3>A Country Bumpkin Visits Shanghai Again (29)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The country bumpkin ate very comfortably. The soup bowls and vegetable dishes all showed their bottoms. Because the weather was hot, he also ate with a head full of sweat. The Cantonese waiter brought two more towels. The country bumpkin thought, "That's exactly what I need. I don't mind paying a few extra pennies." But when he pulled the towel open to look at it, he said, "That's not right! That's not right! This is not a face towel." "How is it not a face towel?" the Cantonese waiter said, standing in front of him. "Our face towels are always rectangular. How come this is square? And we always use hot towels to wipe our faces. How come this is ice-cold? Don't you mix up these two square towels with someone's foot wraps?"</p>
<p>"In our Cantonese restaurants, we always have towels like that. We pay great attention to hygiene. Your towel is very clean. In this hot summer, it's not suitable to wipe with hot towels. You say it's ice-cold, of course. Our towels are wrung out in ice water. And they are also sprinkled with floral water. Smell it on your nose. Is it possible that a foot wrap is so fragrant?"</p>
<p>The Cantonese waiter unfolded a towel and brought it to the country bumpkin's nose. The country bumpkin smelled it and it was indeed fragrant. He thought, "The Shanghainese are indeed not sparing any expense. They even sprinkle perfume on two towels. I heard that Westerners have a kind of perfume that, when sprinkled on clothes, doesn't fade for several months. Don't let me wipe that towel and the fragrance seeps into my skin. When I return to the countryside, if the mother of the eldest smells it, she will think that I had an affair in Shanghai. Wouldn't I be wrongly accused?"</p>
<p>After the country bumpkin finished eating, wiped his face, and settled the bill, he was about to get up when he saw several young people walking in, wearing white clothes and white pants. Behind them was a girl with short hair, wearing a long blue dress, but holding a small white cloth flag in her hand.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin didn't know what this group of people was doing. As soon as they came in, they went to a table with five or six diners. The country bumpkin opened his curious eyes. He didn't ask anyone. He wanted to see for himself what this group of people was doing. After watching for a long time, he finally figured it out.</p>
<p>"Hey! I heard people say that there are no night watchmen in the Shanghai concession. It turns out that this is not accurate." The country bumpkin thought to himself, nodding his head.</p>
<p>Because he discovered that an even younger person was carrying a thick bamboo tube. The country bumpkin recognized this kind of thick bamboo tube. The night watchman Ah Si in the town also used that kind of bamboo tube. When he knocked it, "Di Li Bian! Bi Li Bo!" the sound was clear and crisp. Although there are fewer night watchmen in the city, when the end of the year is near, Bi San, who shouts "Beware of fire," still has to use that kind of night watchman's clapper.</p>
<h3>Presented to General Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits launched a large-scale invasion of Heilongjiang, but they were repeatedly repelled by Provincial Chairman Ma Zhanshan. The people of the country praised him for it. Therefore, this poem is presented.</p>
<p>My eyes are filled with tears for the rivers and mountains. You have summoned the soul of the nation. Today, you are a remarkable man of China. You are not Zhang Liang, but Ma Yuan.</p>
<p>Brave soldiers are gathered like clouds. Who can compare to the general who repels the Japanese invaders? 400 million people are clapping their hands. General Ma, you are worthy of the title of General.</p>
<p>General Ma and Young Master Feng, Feng Yong reported to the country with a loyal heart, never giving up. Ashamed are the generals and soldiers of the Central Plains, who only use their strength to kill compatriots.</p>
<h3>Lament for the Fall of Qiqihar</h3>
<p>The Japanese bandits launched a large-scale invasion of Heilongjiang. Ma Zhanshan fought alone for a long time, with exhausted supplies and no reinforcements. Heilongjiang Province fell. The people of the country mourned for it. Therefore, I compose this poem.</p>
<p>For days, the isolated city struggled in the siege. It is a pity that the court deliberations were still calm. We did not see Zhang Liang rise up when Han fell. We only mourn Xu Yuan's loyalty when the city fell. Relying on integrity to compete for survival, dare to discuss success or failure to be a hero.

<p>Gold Market is Volatile</p>
<p>▲ Chaos · Extraordinary Ending and a Sharp Rise of Seven Taels. Yesterday, the gold market was chaotic and abnormal. It changed every moment, and the waves were surging, making it impossible to fathom. The daily highs and lows differed by sixteen or seventeen taels. In the end, it rose seven taels. The confusion of people's minds made buying and selling different. Moreover, it was chaotic and unbearable. The initial market opened high because of the silver market's report of a drop. It immediately broke through eighty taels. Suddenly, large households poured out sales, and foreign exchange tightened and the listed rate reduced. Only the gold price then dropped sharply by ten taels. There was a slight turn, and the noon time was gentle. The latter market was very sharp, once discovering a new price of six hundred and eighty-five taels. Since the foreign exchange rate rose, banks sold as much as possible, causing each buyer to retreat rapidly and the time was filled with clouds and mist. The price suddenly broke through the seventy tael mark and then recovered.</p>
<p>▲ The morning market turned from Xiu to Wei. It opened with an increase of nine taels and nine qian, at six hundred and seventy-four taels and five qian. The big strip fell by a quarter. The silver price dropped by three-eighths. It was reported that the United States was selling quite a bit, but buyers were rare. When it dropped from five and a half taels to three and a half taels, there was news that South Africa had a theory to protect the gold standard, and Japan continued to ship cash to the United States. Therefore, people's spirits were high. Yuan Maoyong, Xiang Yu, Dan Changyong, Da Decheng and foreign exchange bills, etc., excitedly advanced and rose sharply by ten taels. However, the China Bank issued US$32.375 to .25, and British gold was issued by the Wheat Bank at 1.91375, so it rose to eighty-four taels. However, because Zhifeng, Yongfu, Yu Yongfeng, Shunli Wanxing Yu Da, etc., came to compete for sale, it immediately dropped by six or seven taels to seventy-seven taels and five qian. The British gold revealed that it had been reduced by .25, and the US dollar had fallen by one yuan. (This is due to the small exchange rate.) At that time, it was eighty taels, but the internal rate was flat. Wheat Bank issued 32.3125 on the 2nd. Zhifeng Yong and others continued to sell, and it fell to seventy-seven taels and two qian. In a moment, the banks did each other's business at thirty-two yuan and three seventy-five, and the settlement was only .25. Moreover, Da Decheng, Hengxing Chang Sheng Yong and Wu bought, so they added five taels. At nearly ten o'clock, it was eighty-two taels and five qian. In an instant, Hengxing Yuan, Fuchang Chunyuan Yong Shunli and cover heads, etc., came on the market to sell. In particular, British gold can settle half a penny, and US dollars can be done at thirty-two and a half yuan, and the wind turned sharply downward, a crazy drop of ten taels. At ten forty-five, it was seventy-three taels. After entering, Hengchang Yong Chang Sheng Yong Yuan Maoyong Taifeng Cheng Qian Changxiang, etc., all dragged in, and also recovered five taels with Bombay going down two anna, with only one or two taels high and low. Until eleven forty-five, it was seventy-eight taels and a half. HSBC had absorbed five or six two five British gold. After that, there was also a one and a half tael round trip, from seven taels to eight taels and a half. By the time the market closed, it was seventy-seven taels and eight qian, and then it was done to six or seven taels. The people's hearts were erratic, and the revealed price was changed to seven hundred and sixty-eight taels, which was about ninety taels inside and out.</p>
<p>▲ The afternoon market rose and fell sharply, and the market opened immediately with a rise of more than one tael, at seventy-nine taels and five qian. It was Shunli Wanxing who first advanced, and soon retreated to seven taels and five qian. The buying wind was strong again. Heng Yu Hong Kang Yong Cheng Feng Yong Xiangfeng Yuan Xingyong Yuan Maoyong and Wu, etc., rushed to advance, and the US dollar in Shanghai for one or two months was thirty-two yuan and four two seventy-five. After that, the settlement was only two five to one two five, and the British gold China ratio absorbed one and a half nine, so it rose sharply by more than seven taels and two twenty minutes to eighty-five taels. In less than ten minutes, a counter-movement was seen because Zhengjin and others came out of the US dollar three seventy-five, and the British gold can also be settled at six two five. The buyers in the market are agile. At two and a half o'clock, Bombay reported a big thirteen Anna, and the people's hearts suddenly became empty. Hengyu Xie Kang Da Decheng Tong Taichang Yuan Maoyong and others bought out unanimously. The US dollar was also loose to seventy-five, so the gold price fell sharply, losing more than sixteen taels. The market was in a weak state. At more than three ten minutes, it broke seventy taels and finally became sixty-eight taels and five qian. Tong Taichang Qian Changxiang Yifeng Yong Heng Yong Xiang followed to pay in, and the exchange rate in Bombay was seven Anna. HSBC bought 8125 US dollars, and then pulled up five or six taels. At three and a half o'clock, it was seventy-four taels and five, and in just over ten minutes, it was cut by four taels to seventy taels. The retail households rushed to buy. At more than three fifty, the market was chaotic, with two or three taels circling, and the numbers were in and out, each taking its own path, from seventy-three taels and three qian to sixty-nine taels and eight qian, and then to seventy-three taels. It was seventy-two taels at more than four and twenty minutes, and then it was closed at seventy-one taels and seven qian. Compared with the previous day, it rose by seven taels and one qian. According to the full day's maximum price, eighty-five taels, the minimum price was sixty-eight taels and five qian, a difference of sixteen taels and five qian. Goods morning market seventy-four taels, noon closed seventy-seven taels, afternoon eight taels and seven qian closed at seventy-two taels. The revealed price was about ninety taels to one hundred taels. The result was ninety-five or six taels. The morning account was eighty-one taels and seventy-eight taels, and the afternoon was seventy-five taels and seventy-two taels. The water replenishment was eighty-one taels and the afternoon was seventy-five taels. The red strip was added by five taels and five qian, and there was a way to go.</p>
<p>▲ Transactions are extremely divergent. According to statistics, Yuan Maoyong, Qian Changxiang, Chang Sheng Yong, Hengxing, Yifeng Yong, and Hengchang Yong all advanced, and Yu Da, Wanxing, Richang, Shunli, Yuan Feng Yong, Yongfeng, Hengxing Yuan, and Fuchang, etc., all came out. Yuantai, Daxing Yong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Bingxing, Wu, Da Decheng, Futai Heng, etc., were busy coming out and going in.

<h3>Foreign Exchange is Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Made Up for Short Positions, Cover Distance is Getting Further and Further</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American and Indian silver markets all reported declines. Sales in the European market were more than purchases, which was the opposite of the previous day.

The bank's internal market was initially strong, then slightly frustrated. In the afternoon, it was tight and then loose again. As for the gold market, the storm spread, retreating from eighty taels to inside seventy taels, which was affected by the rise and fall of the exchange market. As a result, compared with the previous afternoon, the British gold batch was flat and the US dollar was reduced by half a yuan. This is due to the small resumption of British and American exchange rates. Most Chinese merchants made up for short positions, and the cover distance was farther than the ten-day opening. However, the unified daily accounting was about sixty taels before and after, and some were also thrown out. It is estimated that about more than 100,000 pounds of British gold was sold, and about more than 1 million yuan of US dollars. The changes in the market are difficult to grasp.

<h3>Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Must Be Delivered, Buyers Anxious</p>
<p>Quotation Reaches Seven Mace, Three Fen, and Five Li</p>
<p>▲Market Overview: The panic caused by tight money in the market has just subsided but has not yet returned to normal when sudden and strange changes occurred in foreign exchange. The financial world has seen many troubles. According to investigations, the distant cause of this rise in exchange rates is the large withdrawal of cash from Dalian, leading to a depletion of reserves in Shanghai. The immediate cause is the upcoming public bond delivery date the next day. Many bullish speculators this month needed to prepare cash for purchases, so they bought foreign currency, which is what caused it. As for whether it can return to its previous level, it is still uncertain. Judging from the overall trend, it is feared that there will be no turning point within the month.</p>

The afternoon market soared, and the listed price reached as high as 7 mace, 3 fen, and 5 li. However, due to the maintenance efforts of banks, the price was suppressed, and the closing price was 7 mace and 2 fen and 8 li.

The morning market saw 3,500 jiao traded, while there were no transactions in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins were at 6 mace, 4 fen, 9 li, and 7 hao and a half in the morning market. In the afternoon market, due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, they rose to 6 mace and 5 fen and 2 li.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The Selling Pressure in the Yarn Market Has Not Abated</p>
<p>The yarn market remains weak due to the serious situation and the daily disturbances in the Northeast, which are becoming increasingly intense. The financial situation is tightening, and people's hearts are weak. Merchants from all regions lack the ability to make active purchases, so there is a real need for sluggishness. Most retailers tend to sell off, so the lowest price this month has been 45 taels and 2 qian. However, it is said that large buyers of distant months are still firm.</p>
<p>The Monthly Benchmark Drops by 2 Taels and 8 Ren: Before the bidding, the market opened with a downward trend in American cotton. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and the current month fell by 1 tael and 2 qian, with distant months falling by 2, 3, and 4 qian. In the afternoon, the current month fell by another 1 tael and 6 qian, while distant months rose by 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 47,400 bales. Guangfeng sold 4,300 bales, Shenji 1,050 bales, Changfeng 1,650 bales, and Tianlong 1,700 bales. Rongxing bought 3,550 bales, Tongyu 2,500 bales, Dafu 700 bales, and Mingde 950 bales.

The market is flat. Among the merchants, Guangdong bought 390 bales, Shantou 20 bales, Jiangxi 45 bales, the interior 65 bales, and Xuenan 50 bales.</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the decline is intensifying. It was already expected to decline, but bullish speculators and Han merchants were holding on tight, trying to support it. Now that the supply from various sources is gradually increasing, manufacturers have absorbed enough foreign cotton and have no intention of buying domestic cotton. Moreover, the money supply is extremely tight, making it difficult for buyers to provide support, which has led to the discovery of vulnerabilities. The near months have fallen by 1 tael, and the future situation is still seen as weak. Some observers believe that the distant months will have to be seen around 30 taels.</p>
<p>Han Standard Drops by 5 Qian: The Han standard market opened with a downward trend in American cotton. Each month fell by 2, 3, and 4 qian. In the afternoon, sentiment remained weak, and bullish speculators liquidated their positions. Each month fell by 5 fen to 1, 2, and 3 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 111,000 dan. Guangfeng sold 5,500 dan, Heshen 4,000 dan, Yudai 2,800 dan, Changfeng 4,300 dan, Maichang 2,500 dan, and Changhe 2,200 dan. Gongtai bought 5,800 dan, Hengde 2,100 dan, Tongyu 3,000 dan, Taixing 3,400 dan, and Yichang 2,800 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Cotton Sales Stall Again: There are currently no transactions in the cotton market.</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The Hexia Rice Market Tightens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources for the various groups in Nantou were around the 10th. Market sales were active due to the wind. In addition, most of the cargo owners had suffered significant losses.

The Yang Du Jian market was mediocre with no rise or fall. Chen Po's intention to import from the local area was still strong. The trading of Yinhua Zhongguan was not weak, and large plates tightened.</p>
<p>Yesterday, not many goods arrived on the west road of Xinzha. Store sales on this street were even weaker, and there were few guests. Due to the wind, few boats arrived in Hexia. Xijin's trade was the most active, with a rise of Jiao Xu. Both thin early and 2nd crop rice were sold immediately upon arrival, and the situation continued to be strong. It was difficult to find and scarce Du Jian goods in the port, and Wei was also sluggish. Rice wine merchants still bought a lot, with a drop of several cents. Each of the Hexia factories opened 3-4,000 shi of goods.</p>
<h3>Current Foreign Rice Sales Remain Good in This Street</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the current foreign rice sales were still good because this street continued to handle it smoothly. The market was also able to stand firm. However, if there is large-scale sales by major merchant groups, then the market price may have upward development prospects. The entire market saw 2,000 bags of Saigon rice handled by this street, priced at 11 yuan, 4 jiao, and a half to 11 yuan and 4 jiao. Small schools handled a thousand bags, priced at 10 yuan. Futures six lines still had the intention to sell, but importers were watching. There was no transaction in the whole market.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales to the North Suddenly Become Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially appeared weak and then became firmer. Initially, the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly six or seven jiao, but recently it had been nearly divided. The forward period was still stable. Soon after, various groups in the north needed spot goods due to the impending river closure, so sales were unavoidable. It was heard that Niuzhuang was already the final transshipment point, so the demand for near and far periods was good. However, due to the urgent situation, very few outsiders asked for it, and there was little improvement. Looking ahead, if the money supply can be eased and actual sales are still active, then it should be able to stand firm. As a result, this month was 7.5 li better than the previous day, December to February was 1 fen and 7.5 li better, March was 1 fen and 2.5 li better, and April was 1 fen and a half better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Turns Better After Weakness</h3>

December also fell to 2 taels, 6 qian, and 1 fen. The forward period also initially fell and then stabilized. Until the afternoon opening, this month once again rose to 3 taels, 4 qian, and 8 fen due to actual delivery of only about 20 cars. The difference between the morning and afternoon reached 1 qian, 2 fen, and 3 fen. The trading of distant months was still smooth, and the market remained flat. As a result, this month was 4 fen better than the previous round, December was 1 fen better, January was 2 fen better, February was 3 fen better, March was 1 fen better, and April was slightly 2 fen better.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<p>Practical Composition Lectures Zhou Le Shan</p>
<p>Edited by Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Articles tend to be widely applied, which is a natural trend. In fact, the mission of articles, in addition to building its theory, expressing its emotions, and completing great creations, is indeed needed to put the article into practical application. There is a ridiculous phenomenon in the reading world. There are people who can write thousands of words, but they can't write a contract, or even a family letter. It's not that I'm exaggerating. I think everyone has seen this kind of people. It is a shame for intellectuals not to be able to apply articles to society. It is a bookworm for intellectuals not to be able to apply articles to society. We want to call out these two slogans to reduce bookworms in society and cleanse the shame of intellectuals. Many years ago, many (applied documents) were published, but most of them were biased towards outdated clichés, unable to expound new theories, and unable to teach people how to write applied documents. People who read his books still ended up at a loss. Ten years ago, Mr. Hu Fu once published an article on "New Youth" called "The Teaching of Applied Documents". At that time, not many people paid attention to him. Recently, most secondary schools have separated applied documents into elective courses in the Chinese language, and normal schools have also listed them as required courses. Chen Zizhan's "Practical Composition Lectures" was published in response to this need. The convenience of this book for teaching is that it uses a lecture format. This format is the easiest to understand. All those who have graduated from senior primary schools and senior middle schools and immediately serve the society, using this book as an aid for writing and application, it is truly what is called (not without benefit). The scope discussed in this book is of course applied documents, and applied documents are limited to those commonly used in society, and especially specialized ones can only be classified within (official document format) and are not discussed. I think this is good, because it can avoid the disease of dullness. How should applied documents be classified? It seems that there is no precedent, but this book does divide the categories in an orderly manner. Chapters 2 to 7 discuss six categories: official documents, telegram documents, book documents, congratulatory documents, couplet documents, and deed documents. Chapter 8 discusses three categories: regulations documents, inscription documents, and advertising documents. This classification can be said to be all-encompassing and generally complete. Now let's talk about the main argument of this book. The main argument of this book is quite rigorous. There are many examples used, and the author can add his own opinions everywhere. In order to discuss a style, he can pay attention to the categories, formats, gains, and losses, and sources. The author is also able to summarize the essentials of writing at the end, but not perfunctorily. The difficulty of compiling (applied documents) lies in the two items of etiquette and law. (1) When talking about etiquette, it is necessary to explain the changes between the old and the new. (3) When talking about laws and regulations, it is necessary to explain the suitability of time and place. However, it should not be said too stiffly. If it is too stiff, it will be annoying. If it is too humorous, it will lose the state of seriousness. Although there are humorous parts in this book, it can always maintain seriousness. Now let's further discuss the selection of examples in this book. The selection of examples should have economical means, because examples cannot be avoided, but isn't it cumbersome to give a large pile of examples in succession? It is even more difficult to compile (applied documents), because (applied documents) are the most complicated of articles. If you list them one by one, it will not only bore the reader, but the writer's skill will also be too uneconomical. This book for the following three items, Official documents, Telegraph, Book Revelation, Sometimes a total of one example is cited for each, which is not only eye-catching, but also does not damage the fluency of the article, otherwise, saying one or two sentences and citing an example is really what is called (a lazy woman's foot cloth). The author is a historian. He usually does not miss any historical materials. He uses these historical materials as examples of (Practical Composition Lectures), and uses them (seamlessly). Those who can write (applied documents) can also get a strong taste there. I will now list a few titles below Ms. Yu Shenshou presented to the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce a text to pay off the government's holding of the price of the Italian queen embroidery statue, Hong Shen presented to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department an article requesting the prohibition of the opening of the Locke film "Not Afraid of Death" that insulted the Chinese nation, The Ministry of Education sent a letter to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan requesting an examination and deliberation on the case of using plum blossoms as the national flower to change the five-petaled branches into three-petaled branches, please check and transfer the letter, The Director of the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Education issued a bulletin to refute the rumors of returning the souls of goblins and children, The Student Union of Shandong Provincial Second Normal School sent a telegram for the "Zijian Nanzian Case", ………………………… From the several titles listed above, one can know at a glance that these examples contain endless humorous interest. In the first chapter, the author said about the importance of (applied documents). He said, (Applied documents are written words applied to actual life, including personal, social, public and private exchanges, negotiations, social occasions, and expressions, all based on law, or in accordance with customs, and necessary to apply words.) The author also expounded from Liu Xie's (The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons) (Secretary) to explain the characteristics of application, (1. Literary quality should be appropriate, regardless of classical or colloquial language, 2. Establish the style according to the event, and the style should be precise, Three. The words and sentences should be concise, and one word cannot be perfunctory,) , (Applied documents) is an obvious fact in today's needs, and (Practical Composition Lectures) is a good book published to meet those needs. I would like to introduce it to our reading world. Example of book and newspaper introduction draft (1) The text is limited to introducing the latest publications at home and abroad. All political, economic, legal, scientific, educational books and newspapers other than literary works are included in the introduction, but boring books and newspapers will not be introduced.</p>

It is famous at sea. Recently, since the start of the national crisis, there has been a strong boycott of Japanese goods, and domestic goods have taken the opportunity to promote sales. The warships brand cloth of our factory was in short supply for a while, and the stock was sold out. There are many reservations coming, and even if we rush to make it day and night, we still think it is not enough. The broadness of the sales is unprecedented.
