<p>方覺慧報告黔省狀况</p>
<p>于右任演講約法精神</p>
<p>中央黨部五月八日上午九時中央黨部舉行紀念週到中委丁惟汾方覺慧恩克巴圖等曁黨部全體職員共四百餘人丁惟汾主席行禮如儀由方覺慧報告視察川黠經過略謂一川省視察經過前次已略報告今所報告者爲黔省</p>
<p>大槪情形黔省黨務分黨務沿革與黨務現狀兩點先言其沿革清末有自治學會之組織即是本黨同盟會貴州分會辛亥武昌起義貴州響應獨立即由於該會約的活動後因唐繼堯的摧殘劉王周的屠殺本黨同志俱不免流離失所本黨十三年改組以後總理曾派安順卿同志入黔籌備黨務十五年中央又派張道藩李益之回黔組織而李卒被害於螺絲山十七年中央再派平剛爲黔省指委辦理登記亦不一年而解體十八年中央特派李仲公何輯五等回黔主持黨務并確定經常費用乃有長足的展進去年復經一度之改組即爲現任之指導委員會是也再言其現狀黨部組織省黨部已遵照中央决議於本年二月改組實行縮部爲科及書記長的制度縣黨部正式成立者祗有貴陽一縣由省黨部派員組織指導委員辦事處者有七縣其餘則劃分全省爲十五個黨務區域每區包涵三縣至七縣不等成立黨務區特派員辦事處以指</p>
<p>導黨務這也算是貴州一種特殊的情形黨員方面領有黨證者祗有四百零六人除已帮二人出省壖三十二人外在省黨員祗有三百八十二人我們由此可以想見貴州文化落後的情形和發展黨務的困難至於黨務經費則省黨部每月爲六千元貴陽縣黨部每月爲四百元黨務指委辦事處每月二百二十元黨務區特派員辦事處每月三百元左右民衆團體於云年九月開始組織各種團體正式成立者計有七十二處其餘則俱因簡就陋尙在組織之中我們從黨務上各方面的情可以看到邊陲落伍的狀况然而黔民性誠篤一經信仰主義之後則堅定不移終身不易改變加以境内毫無反動勢力故黨員雖少黨務前途尙可樂觀再方吏治黔省政府悉照中央規定組織惟不同之點秘書處外有軍米處與諮政處而諮政處爲容納全省政治人材的特殊組織其權高在五廳之上至輨俸則俱極低省府主席每月僅一百八十元其餘委任各官則自七十元以下至十八元不等有時且以六成發給其清苦勤勞之風爲各省所無再言財政黔省收入每年約八百萬元支出每年需一千五百餘萬元相差有七百萬元之鉅故不得不力行减政再言軍事黔省爲毛光翔部</p>
<p>二十五軍原有六萬餘人經過炻次編遣現祗有三師之獨立旅共四萬餘人再</p>
<p>言建設由貴陽達四境的公路已成一千四百餘里汽車有三十餘輛再方敎育黔省小學最爲發達而女學生之人數常</p>
<p>超出於男學生人數此又爲黔省女子敎育發達特殊情形黔人對於宗敎崇奉佛道對於耶敎天主則絕少信仰再言苗</p>
<p>族黔省苗民有八十二種有以方向命名者如東苗西苗之類有以服色命名者如青苗白苗花苗之類有以居地命名者如谷蘭龍洞之類現時全省苗民人數約</p>
<p>在八十萬左右佔漢族十分之一至視察後之感想（一）民衆力量四川對於民團辦理極好極堅固有力到處無匪踪貴州自治亦頗有成績皆民衆之力量也（二）路政四川公路甚多貴州公路亦四境通達俱用徵工制與派兵督修一則可促路趱速成二則可解决老弱兵士生活皆可取法（三）民衆痛苦四川田賦已徵到民國三十年稅項則隨區徵收人民極感通苦貴州爲全中國最瘠之區軍餉向由川協八十萬元湘協三十萬元滇協二十萬元自民八以後即行停止因此人民</p>
<p>不勝其担負（四）軍人特性四川軍隊遇有利害衝突即時宣戰然在戰時雙方將領可由電話談判故常常朝戰夕和視戰事如家人口角貴州軍隊則不然一經衝突則非有一方消滅不肯罷休此川黔兩省軍人之特性報告畢禮成散會</p>
<p>國民政府同日上午十時國民政府舉行紀念週到蔣中正邵元冲于右任朱培德張景惠王樹翰王柏齡王伯羣焦易堂恩克巴圖陳布雷劉尙清蔣作賓鮑文樾周佛海王有賓陳其采林翔茹欲立馬福祥公秉藩劉瑞恒莊崧甫陳紹寛李書華王家楨張我華吳思豫及國府文官參軍主計等處職員</p>
<p>三百餘人蔣中正主席行禮後于右任演講略謂召開國民會議及廢除不平等條約載在總理遣囑爲吾人耿耿不忘之</p>
<p>兩事蓋以欲解决國内一切重要問題惟有開國民會議欲中國獨立於世界惟有廢除不平等條約現在國民會議已閉幕訓政時期之約法亦已由政府頒布中華民族之新生命即由此開始約法之精神完全建立於三民主義之根本原則上關於民生如何解决民族如何團結民權如何訓練行使均有縝密規定惟實施約法前須有一先商問題即國内安定與秩序如國内統一有妨碍秩序不能安定即不能談實行約法昨日蔣主席所發告全國將士書對於維護統一防止内戰再三申明希望勿爲赤匪製造機會由此</p>
<p>事實的證明凡不諒解之同志當可知中央用意之所在明白中央之同志更應竭誠擁護中央以竟全功吾人人須知此次勦</p>
<p>赤成功即中山主義之成功中華民國之成功如失敗即中山主義之失敗中華民國之失敗故當此赤患猖獗之時全國國民及全黨黨員應一致動員並抱定過去種種譬如昨日死又後種種譬如今日生之精神祛除誤會一致努力剷除共匪以完成國民革命實行三民主義其次關於監察院方面日前本院曾以　河縣長孫惟善違法抽收廢骨捐經提出彈劾案業由國府明令河北省政府澈查但</p>
<p>該縣長擬在天津登報反駁以爲監察院不應以二发郵票而彈劾縣長殊不知此二分郵票亦係人民所破費監院之職權爲政府所賦予即無此二分郵票亦有權彈劾該縣所收之廢骨捐爲各地所無該縣長於廢骨頭上刮一點油誠屬搜刮之能手該縣長以爲此係小事監院似毋庸過問其實此事關係國計民生監院爲實行職權計自應提出彈劾此外尚</p>
<p>有耕年問題最近出口極多大部均供給食品如牛排等類其影響於農業者甚鉅故近年來因耕牛出口之故以致富農變爲中農中農變爲貧農最後乃流離失所清季雖禁屠牛而耕牛猶不足用現在若不加以限制則將來農産上將大受影響有人以爲若耕牛不敷可代以機器其實此法並不適用於小農希望各地方以後對於看去甚小而實際所關甚大之</p>
<p>問題應切實注意報告畢散會</p>

<p>每年損失數千萬元太原通訊昨日爲林文忠公焚煙紀念日山西高等地方兩法院特於昨日下午二時函邀黨政軍學衣報社各機關團體代表假中山公園於共同監視之下焚毁大批毒物計焚去料麫煙灰六千七百餘兩金丹原料六千餘兩統裝一百二十六箱二十餘袋共計毒物一萬餘兩烟具等雜物六十七簍據法院統計此次所</p>
<p>焚毁者係最近二年内所查獲者内中關於料面一項近二年查獲之總額較民八至十七年度十年間之總額竟尚超過一千餘兩可以證明山西毒物近年來激增之</p>
<p>情狀矣按此次所焚爲値約在三百萬元以上然毒物之被官方查獲者實僅萬分之一二耳且歷年查獲之烟土悉數送村</p>
<p>政處配置和平戒烟藥九此項鉅額亦不在内據此則三晋每年金錢之漏巵更可</p>
<p>想象而知查近年所查獲毒物金丹料面之原料品占大部分是目前山西確已由販運而進於製造時期矣前途情狀之險惡實可驚駭故昨日焚毁時到會民衆異常踴躍先由法院將各毒物用大車多輛分批運至公園全部陳列任人觀覽旋由高等法院院長邵修文主席舉行紀念大會共到代表等二百餘人行禮後由邵及拒毒會代表武振鐸等先後講演扼要語爲丹料不除數十年後晉人勢將絕種目前金丹料面之盛行山西確爲第一至四時許始舉火焚毁而散六月四日</p>
<h3 id="c88">馬寅初對於錢莊法之意見（續） <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>這是關於錢莊法的問題大致的報告鄙人認爲無起草的心要因爲錢莊業到底是不以信</p>
<p>用放欵爲主在營業上是不是和銀行一樣因爲銀行做收受存欵及放欵的買賣錢莊也做收受存欵及放欵的買賣銀行做生金買賣錢莊也做生金買賣我們想不出他不同的地方所</p>
<p>以很難規定的倘若分别規定起來將來關於社會事業如剃頭師也要有剃頭師法洋車夫也要有洋車夫法裁縫師也要有裁縫師法是將不勝其繁了銀行與錢莊所做的事業旣然性質相同所以我們才把他包括在起假如他們的性質兩樣當然可以另爲規定要問現在錢莊所做的事業與銀行所不同的地方在何處無非是錢莊不能發鈔票銀行可以發鈔票的一點但是内地錢莊也有發紙幣者且關於這一層我們對於商業銀行發行鈔票權將來是要逐漸取締的所以銀行與錢莊名雖異而實則</p>
<p>相同無另行起草錢莊法之必要這是關於錢莊法的意見自銀行法頒布以來錢莊以爲銀行法</p>
<p>之第一條將錢莊亦包括在内視錢爲銀行之附屬品此乃極大的誤會我們以爲倘錢莊改組爲無限公司則無限公司之地位在股份有限公司組織的銀行之上何以言之無限公司不僅要集合資本還要各人拿出勞力才能成功是置重所謂人格因而可名之日人格公司非任何人都可做股東必要看股東的人格如何其人或是才具優長或是道德高尙或是很有名望其人的人格旣高然後他這公司才能爲社會所重視若不注重股東的人格則公司也要受他的影響照這樣看是股東的人格與公司大有關係帮可名之人格公司反之現在的銀行幾全係股份有限公司組織而股份有限公司則與無限公司完全相反誰來做股東都没有關係祗要繳出規定的股本就行其人的道德上的價値如何可以毫不顧及即公司中的董事對於債務也不直接負責對抗其責任者是股份公司的本身股份公司是要向世問遍的招集股欵不能一一調查其大的品行和人格然後承認他人股蓋無限公司是由於少數的人代立彼此</p>
<p>女槪知道帮能集合十分有信用的人物若夫股份有限公司則其股票隨時都可以輾轉買賣所以今日的股東雖係堂皇人物若明日他將他的股票賣出是歸一種有什麽人格的人收買全都不知道所以倘一定要孝究人格那末公司祗有不成功公司對股東的人格是管不着的質而言之股份有限公司對於人格没有關係祗有以資本相集合故可名之日資本公司由此看來無限公司係人格公司股份有限公司係資本公司可知無限公司之地位遠在股份有限公司之上何得謂爲錢莊爲銀行之附屬物在法言法一重人格一重資本重人格者當然在重資本者之上故銀行法並没有視錢莊爲銀行附屬物之意（完）</p>

<p>以中華民族之生命供若干人之孤注况隠患所伏尙有不止於此者當上年馮閻稱兵之際正西北奇荒之日交通阻塞賑糧斷絕致陜西一省餓斃者達二百萬人之衆而緩遠老弱流離其婦女多爲駔儈販易於各處災情之慘亘古罕聞自討逆軍事告竣西北賑災雖得順得進行然以剿匪一日不能結束軍隊一日不能復員國家終不能騰出大批財力爲救荒之準備是以八百萬元之賑災公債議而未行枝節施賑爲益無幾據報陜西全省人口近减少三分之一甘肅則全省七十縣受災者達六十餘縣之廣餓斃者亦達百萬人以上故國家今日最要任務即在萃全國之財力從事大規模之賑災</p>

<p>生命并隳中華民族之生命以愛黨愛國始而以誤黨誤國終用敢根據上述意旨掬誠請求務祈順從黨中先進之勸告國民普遍之心理不於和平適法手段而外别謀解决塗徑庶以保持民族生命</p>

<p>華商航業無法維持</p>
<p>將來苦痛仍在商帮外輪壟斷川江航業中國各輪局正謀對付方策而各洋商第一步計劃已經實施遂引起客商停裝華輪貨件釀成中國商輪在川江中不得不停班航矣此事關係至巨記者特調查其狀况分記如後</p>
<p>濫跌水脚川河運輸以棉紗最占大宗航運宜昌慶之船大都爭裝此貨宜渝一路英日美法外輪共有三十餘艘該路運紗水脚向爲每件十六兩後跌至十二兩至上年各外輪更跌減每件收銀入兩照此數目僅夠輪運成本今年洋商船謀取得川河貨運之優先權竭力打破華輪之聨合乃於六月一日起更將棉紗水脚狂跌由八兩一件减爲四兩而實際上又讓去一兩實收三兩自此次運費大跌風潮發生外輪預備犧牲並且議定三個步趨各中國船跟跌亦收四兩時彼再减而收二兩最後一步每件棉紗祗收水脚一兩以打破川河跌價新紀錄面使華輪不克支持</p>
<p>誘惑商帮外輪於跌價後即與宜渝兩埠客家接洽如承裝外輪者得享預袋第三步之最短水脚優越利益一船商帮目光淺短者無不貪圖廉價爭向運費低廉之外輪裝運貨件其已向中國船訂有運輸合同者在此跌價潮流中亦提出要求請華輪亦照洋商船之運率减短收費否停止裝載</p>
<p>加費交涉各華商輪局若三北渝江招商慶平川江等八公司以宜渝間棉紗每件減收三兩實不夠往來燒煤一項之費而職工薪金船用五金等完全落空如此損失殊難維持况値川中貨缺跌價而不能滿儎則損失更巨由各華輪提出交涉要求各商帮對運費酌加陳明不得已之苦衷更申述外輪濫跌水脚之不可爲訓一再談判毫無結果</p>

<p>所謂東北係指遼寗吉林黑龍江三省而言近來有以熱河而併稱之者但外人於東北多謂滿洲或稱南北滿蓋自日俄戰後兩强分贓劃長春以南之南滿路沿線即稱南滿屬於日本長春以北之中東路沿線號稱北滿乃屬於俄蓋别其勢力範圍南此南北滿洲統稱之所由日人方面尤津津樂稱之其用意與過去呼中國爲支那含有同等衊視之意且欲藉此表示東北非中國所固有同時不承認東北爲中國之行政區域其用心亦至險毒查東北面積爲三百五十萬六千方里幾等於德法兩國之總面積而三倍於日境内人口僅三千萬平均每平方里黑龍江爲八人吉林爲三十三人三省（遼吉黑）合計平均每平方公里僅二十八人擬之江浙粤三省每平方公里人口寗度多者在一百四十二人以上相差極遠三省之氣候雖較殊於京滬但决不如南方一般人傳說與想像之寒冷其在日人</p>
<p>謂不足畏之氣候即旅行返者亦盛稱冬不嚴寒夏不酷熱故産物極豐宜於耕牧如黃豆高梁小麥大麥旱糧水稻玉米白蔴等中國南部所有農産物東北無不有之中國各海口對外貿易都爲人超惟東北一隅則年年出超謂東北之富源不僅甲於我國即世界亦僅有以東北礦産言金屬礦非金屬礦俱爲富藏産豐質美如黑龍江之砂金塊金有名於世尤爲俄人所垂涎鐵銅鉛等類産礦亦有尤以煤礦産額爲至富産量約在二十萬萬噸撫順一處已在十萬萬以上惜由日本人略奪經營言之實堪痛心查日本國産煤量再過三十年即無煤可供需用今奪得撫順之煤礦除供其本國之需要外尙有餘額運銷上海等處他如吉林之森林千年來尠少斫伐高　參天綿延羣山北人向有樹海之稱日人欲保護國内之森林覬觎東北之寳藏已不自今日始吉黑曠野宜於牧畜牛馬羊騾駝等類家畜較各地所産特大年約</p>

<p>北兄弟今特鄭重致意昐望在座諸位快快到東北去現在東北政府與人民一致努力於建設事業交通日益便利三省之鐵道網現在籌建中惟東北一處人才有限望集全國才智之士前往開發共救東北此爲東北人士所最渴望者勿令天富寳藏棄於外人之手而存觀望之</p>

<h3 id="c145">滬西中山路附近一夜兩暗殺案 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>屍身雖分在二處</p>
<p>查勘似同一案件昨晨一時許滬西曹家渡浜北新闢之中山路附近許家宅地方突然發生匪徒開槍擊斃兩命鉅案屍身雖爲兩地而查勘結果確似同一案件茲將經過詳情分述於后</p>
<p>犬吠驚破好夢農民洪仁正浙之天台人年四十四歲現在閘北中山路旁許家宅第二十六號門牌耕種爲生清貧異常娶妻陳氏年三十六歲生有子女各一年均幼稚詎昨晨一時許闔家正値熟睡之際忽聞村中羣犬吠當時洪從夢中驚醒而吠聲愈急愈近洪恐宵小行竊立即起身啓門視察詎甫至門外突由黑暗中竄出匪徒四五人形勢洶洶蜂擁而至同時各出手槍向洪威脅</p>
<p>呼盜致遭槍殺當時洪見狀情知遇匪衆匪雖出槍恫嚇而洪意不爲所屈遂狂呼捕盜奈其時適値夜深又加地處荒僻故無人應援衆匪見狀不佳乃向洪狙擊四五槍聲如貫珠當時洪妻陳氏初見丈夫外出旋聞大聲呼盜最</p>
<p>後繼以槍數響該氏聞聲戰慄不敢出視嗣見丈夫久返乃冒險而出詎洪已傷中要害飲彈倒斃血泊矣環顧</p>
<p>四週兇手已杳如黃鶴該氏傷慟之餘亟呼集鄰人一面具情投報該管六區總署</p>
<p>區長前往察勘任區長得報後以案情重大當即率領徐巡官及偵緝隊領班劉少卿曁各偵緝員等前往發生地點察勘查得死者洪仁正家内均係破壞物件貧苦非常死者右乳旁擊中一彈左腕亦中一彈血流淋漓屋外所搭之晒衣木架一柱業已拔出抛棄於地</p>
<p>並有一墊水溝之石條置於場中復查得該石條係從離宅半里許之水溝上所搬去　　忽又發現一屍任區長等更</p>
<p>巡至離宅一里許之中山路二十三號後面某祠堂邊小浜旁忽又發現一年約三十餘歲之無名男屍詳細一察見該屍身穿藍布棉破舊單褲胸前左乳旁亦被槍擊中彈血肉糢糊知其亦爲槍殺有一小帽抛於離屍丈餘之草地上嗣又依路上所遺之血跡而尋詎該血跡由許家宅而至此復詰詢該宅鄰人據云於十二時許即聞村中羣犬狂吠良久後至一時餘又聞狺之聲不絕未幾即聞狂呼强盜接連槍聲砰然約四五響因知槍聲故均未也敢出視等情當又在洪家門内外拾獲六寸手槍彈彀五只帶署備查</p>
<p>兩人被殺推測按上情之推測該無名男屍或係與兇手爲同伍决非好人可知或因有人仇隙在許家宅前將該該名男子擊死後即將别處水溝之</p>
<p>石條移此擬繫於屍身抛棄河中沉没（因屍上之褲帶已無）正擬預備之際被羣犬狂吠未敢動手此可預斷爲十二時許所先擊死者後至一時許又欲移屍洪仁正聞犬吠而出大呼强盜致被擊死見無人出視遂將衣架木柱作槓以該無名男屍扛置於此使人難以綫索否則如爲往搶彼洪家又無一値錢之物必無是理究竟眞相若何非局外人所可</p>
<p>斷定</p>
<p>法院派員檢騐任區長查察</p>
<p>一過後遂令偵緝隊劉少卿上緊查緝兇手一面即飭十一圖地保王掌坤十圖地保張子堂同投地方法院請騐下午三時二十分許法院委派檢察官楊文濬書記官毛振新帶同檢騐吏蒞場檢騐查</p>
<p>得兩男屍委係生前被槍擊中要害斃命是</p>
<p>實屍體洪仁正着屍屬陳氏具結收殮該無名男屍即着地保報堂收殮埋葬</p>

<p>— 天牛</p>
<p>有人說中國的戲劇運動要靠各地的愛美的劇團担負起來是没有用的一年來一次或兩次的烏合之衆的公演决不能在藝術上有怎樣的成就所以欲使中國戲劇藝術有相當的發展非由各大敎育家的覺悟而在各大學或專科學校添設戲劇一科云養成基本的Ａctor或DrAmatist不可但在中國什麽都貧乏到極點了一切的敎育都到了破産的局面誰還會注意戲劇敎育呢偌大一個中国比較對於訓練戲劇藝術而有所就的只有廣東歐陽予倩主持的演劇學校北平熊佛而主持的藝術學院戲劇系和焦菊隠主持的戲曲學校而已此外像文化算得發達的江蘇也還没有這佃組織所稍可慰藉的只有省立敎育學院爲造就民衆敎育人才而特設的戲劇科戲劇是藝術藝術的領域不能拿敎育來範圍他主張藝術至上主義Art　For　Art's　Sake的都這樣的說因此拿戲劇作民衆敎育的工具的省立敎育學院的戲劇科有了這樣的一個限制自然不能滿足一般藝術家的慾望但要某一方面講除有正式課堂的訓練之外而又有實騐劇台供其試騐的機會他們的進步當然要比愛美劇團的快得多主持該科的是戲劇專家谷劍塵先生據他個人的主張民衆和戲劇不應絕對遷就民衆的所以他每次所排的戲差不多根據他上面的主張他對於提倡戲劇藝術</p>
<p>說應該藝術民衆化民衆藝術化簡言之就是不去遷就任何一方面谷先生爲實現他的主張起見已排演過不少的劇本最最成功爲血花交歸一片愛國心和未完工的墓碑他們因爲這學期快結東了有成績展覽會之舉於是又有公演的舉動本來想演少奶的扇子後來因爲人選稍有問題改排谷先生自已的近作三幕悲劇狂風暴雨谷先生向來有一個怪脾氣不願意自已去導演自已的戲他的理由是排演他人的戲一定能因下一番揣摹工夫而得到藝術上的長進若自已排自已的劇便少有這一個機會了但這次爲了選不到好劇本只好冒險幹一下這個狂風暴雨的劇本還没有發表過所以外頭很少人知道我在朋友那裏拜讀過他們的油印本子敢在這裏介紹一下這是一齣民族主義的戲劇劇情大槪描寫中日兩民族間的衝突而以滿蒙爲背景由朝鮮女子作爲全劇的主缐劇中少年楊志清集合同志實行開墾滿蒙計劃被日人所破壞地圖計劃書等均被失去楊志清遭了不白之冤不但爲民衆所唾棄而他的未婚妻也與他撤消婚約了外頭的謡言指他係受日人利誘於是得了賣國賊的頭銜他没處剖白便攖心疾幸而自以爲是日本女子的小野梅子知道自已實在日朝鮮的娘因此自承於中國人面前重把盜去的地圖和計劃書拿回來但可憐的少年楊志清已經得了瘋癲病自殺了後來朝鮮姑娘也死在日本人手裏這劇的情節非常曲拆驚筆甚多可以拿山窮水畫疑無路柳暗花明又一村的老古話來形容他末幕的對話頗有力量可以看出日本帝國主議者之殘酷無理和被利用者的覺悟後的被殺的痛苦</p>

<p>梅子　（吃驚但即鎭定從容的說）我做什麽好事</p>
<p>新二郎　你把那東西拿到那裏去了快找來</p>
<p>梅子　（坦然）我們在什麽地方拿來的就該還給那裏了</p>
<p>新二郎　你這是什麽話你走了那東西不見了就知道是你做的把戲所以我立刻釘住你到這裏來你拿的東西在那裏</p>
<p>梅子　就是在這裏已經重新到中　人手裏了你他没法再拿回去了</p>
<p>新二郎　但是你不能不愛自已的國……</p>
<p>梅子　正是我愛自已的國所以我才様做的你瞧我現在穿的衣服你的聰明會告訴我是什麽人我是朝菊鮮人我是要愛我們朝鮮不再愛你們日本了你們日本人專門利用我們朝鮮人來跟中國人作對犧牲是我們的利益是你們的我上當也夠了次我可明白了解自已了</p>
<p>新新郎　胡說你怎麽敢說你不是日本人</p>
<p>梅子　我怎麽不是日本人現在我不能告訴你不過有一件事我可以告訴你的簡單的說便是（仁）和（慈）兩個字這兩個字你們日本人可有嗎警如這次我上當做對不起中國人的事情害了楊志清……那時我就天良發現了上帝的仁慈心在我的血管裏活動起來當初有人謡言我是朝鮮人我没有相信但是我現在忽然能發現你們本人所没有的天良和上帝的仁慈就證明我實在是朝鮮人不是你們只有殘忍心的日本人（看看自已的衣服）你瞧我穿上自已本國的衣服多舒服</p>
<p>他們—敎育學院—有位蘇州女生葉藴貞小姐矮矮的身材肥圓的面孔在一一片愛國心和未完工的墓碑中扮演日本人很有成績因此狂風暴雨的被認爲日本人的朝鮮姑娘小野梅子仍由她來擔任自然要勝任愉快了此劇定月之十三十四兩天在該校公演公演之後我或許再做一篇公演的報告</p>

<p>— 叔淵</p>
<p>著者趙祖抃　發行者光華書局</p>
<p>各時代的財政現象足以影響於各時代的財政學說本書上面冠以現代二字者是研究現代的政原理與原則的這是含有時代性的科學書中國今日財政非常紊亂以致國勢日蹙民生日窘都是財政學没有闡明發揚的緣故著者是有心人所以這本書爲現代理財者的南針有介紹之必要</p>
<p>全書分總論四及歲出論歲入論收支適合論財務行政論地方財政政論分論五编</p>
<p>在總論裏叙述的是財政之特質沿革現狀與將來之趨勢都爲治財政學者不可不先知的前題這種提綱挈領的方法先使讀者對於財政學有一個明確的槪念也是本書的特點總論一第四節財政學之本質更爲全書之主腦蓋財政學旣是系統的研究財政原理與原則的科學其本質當然不能出諸財政的範圍財政範圍的内容曰支出曰收八曰實際的收支之適合曰形式的收支之適合與管理財政學爲研究支出之原則故有歲出論爲研究歲入之原則故有歲入論爲研究實際的收支之適合故有收支適合論或公債論爲研究形式的收支之適合與管理故有預算論現計論與决算論或總稱之爲財務行政論所以著者把財政學分爲歲出論歲入論收支適合論財務行政論四者以外再加上地方財政論是最適合於現代財政學之範圍的至其排列之次序間亦有持異議者如或先之以財務行政論或將財務行政論簡呌做預算論而次於支出論之後其說極多要皆各有理由本書著者因現在國家之財政大都以一年爲標準而設計故仍通說之秩序而定名爲歲出論歳秝論收支適合論財務行政論地方財政論其所以如此拼列者蓋財政以量出爲入爲原則自應先之以歲出論次之以歲入論又財政以收支適合爲原則而收支適合又有實際上與形式上之分别不有實際則形式無所附麗没有形式則實際不能應用實際者就是收支適合形式者就是財務行政所以又次之以收支適合論更次之以財務行政論至地方財政則爲近今地方自治發達之結果且其理論完全根據國家財政之理論不過間有小異之處所以把地方財政論殿本書之後正所謂怡如其分耳</p>
<p>第一編歲出論　歲出就是國家爲履行其職務在一會計年度内對於使用勞務及物件所支付之經鄪費即國家對於所需經濟財貨之價格行貨幣之支付研究關於此歲出論之事實以期發現其一般之原理與原則而供吾人了解各種歳出當否之根據并爲整理財政之資助者厥爲歲出論歲出論在財政學上之地位猶之消費論在經濟學上之地位一樣是全部之目的是一切之主腦假使没有歲出論則其他之部份如歲入等統將成爲毫無意美的行動研究歲出先不可不知歲出之性質關於歲出性質之學說有二一爲歲出有害說一爲性質有益說此問題自十八民紀開始研究以來迄於今日衆說紛紶著者把英國正統學派之消費　歷史學派之生産說現代折衷派之消費生産參半說叙述綦詳因此益可以窺出歲出論經濟的性質把歲出之原則分爲政治的財政的經濟的社會的也得扼要歲出分類亦極煩複通常分類法有二演釋的歸納的前法甚爲簡單普通皆爲二分法後法較爲複雜普通皆爲二分以上之劃分法前者爲理論的後者爲事　的著者參酌二說把歲出分爲歷史的經濟的政治的財政的簡繁得體學者深便</p>
<p>歲出編中是最緊要的一章是歲出之研究法研歲出的方法不外演繹與歸納前者是以理論求事實後者是以事實求理論的前者必有正確之觀念爲基礎後者必有正確之事實或數字爲依據但就歸納法而研究其結果多爲流計換言之歲出之歸納法研究其結果必爲歲出之統計各國有各國之歲出統計今欲求各國歲出現在之一般趨勢自不能不彙集各種統計而比較之但各國之統計之内容及其價値往往相差甚遠難資比較著者特舉出不易比較之理由</p>
<p>一各國預算編製對於經費之分類以及各類内容之廣獗狹與科目之實質常不相同故難比較</p>
<p>二預算統一主義雖爲財政上公認之原理但實際上則多於一般預算外另立特别預算致歲出之眞相無從探知</p>
<p>三追加預算之有無及其我寡亦足使一般歲出之眞相難於知悉至少亦足使調查困難</p>
<p>四預算實施期在財政學上言應在國庫收入多支出少之時然實際上各國會計年度之開始期各有不同遂致各國歲出對於經濟上之影響諸多差異故亦難相比較</p>
<p>五各國歳出統計中財務費之内容往往不同且其多寡亦往往相異故各國歲出統計之表面的計較實不足以表示其國的歲出之實際的眞相</p>
<p>六現代地方自治發達地方經費亦甚重要而地方歳出統計不甚完備故僅以國家歲出相比較其不正確可知</p>
<p>七聨合國中各國歲出統計亦不完備故僅以聨合國之歲出而論實難究其整個歲出之眞相</p>
<p>八在政治不清明之國家中預算上之表面數字入往往不實</p>
<p>有了上面種種的困難實况則利用此種統計時自然可以特别注意了</p>

<p>（甲）經常歲入（子）公經濟之收入（Ａ）政務收入一手續費二使用費三特别捐欵四違法金（Ｂ）租稅（丑）私經濟之收入（Ａ）官産收入（Ｂ）官業收入（乙）臨時歲入（子）純然臨時收入（Ａ）私人捐欵（Ｂ）戰後償金（Ｃ）無主財産充公（丑）預定臨時收入（Ａ）增加租稅（Ｂ）募集公債（Ｃ）官地賣郤代金</p>
<p>這樣的分類就是不看解釋我們也可一目瞭然了</p>
<p>本書於此編公經濟收入論中之租稅叙述特詳舉凡關於租稅之理論原則分類靡不闡發殆盡而於租稅各論中之所得稅財産稅收益稅流通稅消費稅分别論述在尤見扼要</p>
<p>第三編收支適合論　國家財政以收支適合爲原則換言之經常歲入必以之充經常歲出臨時歲入必僅以之充臨時歲出在相當之範圍内亦有以經常歲入充臨時歲出者總之在預算製造上决不使收支相抵後尙有餘剩或不足也然實際上如有剩餘不成問題最有關係者實爲財政上之不足解决此不足問題</p>
<p>之方法即爲公債所以也有以公債論名收支適合論者換言之收支適合論中除討論公債一事外别無他項問題之可言本書對於公債之意義本質方法種類整理諸項莫不擷要叙述最主要者於舉辦公債之利害說得非常清楚理財者何去何從大可參證也</p>
<p>第五編地方財政論　地方財政就是研安地方團體的財政分爲地方歲出論地方歳入論收支適合論財務行政論在地方歲出論中舉出其特異之點如下（一）地方歲出應竭力縮小行政費擴大事業費（二）地方歳出應受中央法令之限制（三）地方歲出應特别注重社會政策實施費（四）地方歲出以經常歲出爲原則臨時歲出只可於萬不得已時行之（五）地方歳出應以預算外支出爲意外濫費（六）地方歲出有時有分擔金及協濟欵項之支出前者爲中央費用之由各地方團體分攤後者財地方團體互相協濟也</p>

<p>Zhuang Songfu went to the middle reaches of the Huai River a few days ago to inspect the trend of the Huai River and returned to Beijing. It is said that the most urgent task for downstream projects is to separate the Huai River from the sea, set up culverts and intermediate dams to facilitate discharge. For the middle reaches, the most urgent task is to dredge the riverbed, limit the width, consolidate the dikes, and moderately afforest, and to connect all the ditches. In the upper reaches, it is necessary to plant trees on the mountains. Wherever there are rivers and lakes, they should be dredged first to make them unobstructed, and then horizontal dikes should be built. Multiple culverts should be set up between the dikes to facilitate storage and release. This is the fundamental way to govern the Huai River (Special dispatch on the 8th).</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Result of the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister's Trip to England <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Previously, British Foreign Secretary Henderson went to Italy and France to mediate the naval issue. After personally contacting them, opinions were immediately released, and the five-nation agreement was established. Although the review by the committee of experts still has many obstacles, the friendship between England, France, and Italy has taken a further step. Difficult international issues must be openly discussed by the authorities. If they are personally contacted, the hidden emotions can be fully expressed, and the doubts can be fully released, so it is more effective than open meetings. This time, the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister went to England together and repeatedly stated Germany's own suffering. The British side was very understanding and the opinions were very harmonious. Reuters reported that the talks in the villa did not have a clear and substantive decision on the war debts, etc., but according to the National News Agency, it has been agreed that the two countries will request creditor countries and debtor countries to cooperate to save the economic decline. It is anticipated that the British government will pass on the results of the talks to the French and Italian governments, and then the countries concerned will consider whether to propose negotiations to the US government, the main creditor country. The German newspaper also predicted that the British Prime Minister has been invited to visit Germany in return, and an international conference may be convened this autumn to discuss ways to deal with the economic panic. If it is as he said, the British Foreign Minister will act as a mediator again, just like the previous mediation of the opinions of the Italian and French navies, to mediate the opinions of Germany, the United States, France, and other countries today, so that the war debts and reparations issue can be smoothly resolved. If the economic difficulties can be gradually reversed, wouldn't that be a blessing to the world?</p>

<p>Agree to Unite with Other Governments</p>
<p>To Jointly Address the Economic Crisis</p>
<p>The Attitude of American Creditors is Notable</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th: British Prime Minister MacDonald hosted a meeting today at his villa with German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius. Several cabinet members and the German Ambassador were also present, as was the famous writer George Bernard Shaw. The talks between the British and German authorities ended at lunchtime. It is reported that the coal issue was also discussed. The Foreign Office issued a vaguely worded communique regarding the talks this evening, stating that the German Chancellor expressed the difficulties of Germany's current situation and the need to alleviate those difficulties, while the British side discussed the global nature of the current economic downturn and the particular impact it has on Britain. Both sides believed that in addition to each country's own efforts and solutions, the restoration of trust and prosperity depends on international cooperation. The two governments, in this spirit, will closely work with relevant governments to address the current crisis. London diplomatic circles are convinced that no clear and concrete decisions were made during the villa talks, and therefore non-official Germans are rather disappointed. Judging from the wording of the communique, Brüning and Curtius requested a relaxation of the current reparations arrangements, but the statement that the two governments will closely work with relevant governments to address the current crisis should not be interpreted as an imminent reparations conference. Dr. Brüning was very grateful for the hospitality of the British authorities and reportedly expressed the hope that he would be able to reciprocate in Berlin soon. The German Chancellor and others returned to London by car after the talks this evening, and the British delegation also returned here.</p>
<p>National, London, 7th: It has been learned from reliable sources that the British and German authorities, in talks at the Prime Minister's villa, have agreed that the two countries should seek the cooperation of creditor and debtor nations to rescue the current economic downturn. The British government will convey the results of the talks to the French and Italian governments, and then the relevant countries will jointly consider whether to jointly negotiate with the major creditor nation, the United States. As for the reparations issue, it is reported that no concrete plans have been mentioned, nor have there been any concrete decisions. Both sides completed their talks this evening. German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius seemed satisfied and returned to the Carlton Hotel by car with British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Henderson, and other cabinet members at 6:15 PM.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius visited Buckingham Palace this morning to meet with the British monarch. After leaving the palace, they attended a banquet hosted by the British-German Association. They are scheduled to leave London tomorrow morning. United Press, Washington, 7th: People in the U.S. government are paying close attention to the talks between British and German authorities at the British Prime Minister's villa. It is reported that the U.S. President and Secretary of State both hope to receive a formal report from the U.S. Embassy in Britain this evening. Some newspapers predict that this move will trigger a new movement by debtor nations to demand the cancellation of war debts. Recalling that U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon repeatedly stated at the International Chamber of Commerce conference that the U.S. government opposes the cancellation of war debt plans, it seems that in view of the German economic crisis, he anticipated this and made preemptive remarks. As for people in the U.S. government, they are unwilling to comment on the German authorities' talks until they receive a formal report and confirm the attitude of the European powers.</p>
<p>National, London, 8th: After the British Foreign Office issued a communique regarding the meeting between the British and German authorities, British newspapers have offered little commentary. The Daily Telegraph stated that the entire war debt issue may be revised. The Daily News said that the second step must focus on the international joint plan mentioned in the communique to deal with the current economic panic, and that the best way to handle this matter is through the League of Nations or using the procedures stipulated in the Young Plan. The Labour Party's organ newspaper believes that the most gratifying result of this trip by the German authorities will be to promote this plan.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 8th: German morning newspapers are mostly not published on Mondays, so evaluations of the meeting between the British and German authorities at the British Prime Minister's villa will only appear in the newspapers this evening or tomorrow morning. Today's noon editions, in addition to carrying the communique issued by the Foreign Office, only speculate slightly on the consensus reached therein. As for general German opinion, many expect that the British side will be invited to visit Germany in return, and that an international conference may be convened this autumn to consider common strategies to address the serious economic panic. Financial circles are paying particular attention to the fact that the Governor of the Bank of England, a senior official of the Treasury, and the Director of the Board of Trade went to the Prime Minister's villa to participate in the talks.</p>

<p>The Epicenter is 280 Miles from the East Coast</p>
<p>Ships Sailing on the Water Felt the Bottom of the Sea Having an Electric Boom</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: No damage has been reported from yesterday's earthquake in Britain. Prior to yesterday, there have been three earthquakes in Britain this year. Unusual changes in the earth's crust are already apparent. Meteorological observatories calculate that the earthquake's epicenter was approximately 280 miles from West Blanc, under the North Sea. According to crew members of a cargo ship that arrived in Scarborough yesterday, the ship was sailing about seventy miles from Scarborough at 1:30 yesterday afternoon when they felt something explode at the bottom of the sea. Fortunately, the ship righted itself after tilting back. After the explosion, there was a loud boom. If that is the case, then the meteorological observatory's speculation is likely credible.</p>
<p>National, London, 8th: According to reports from ships arriving in Britain, the epicenter of Sunday's earthquake was in the middle of the sea, approximately 240 kilometers northeast of the British east coast. A ship that sailed to Scarborough reported that when it was 230 kilometers east of that port, it was shrouded in thick fog and large waves were surging on the sea, accompanied by the sound of a volcanic eruption. The ship shook violently as if it had hit a rock. Also, the Geeho Observatory reported that a faint orange light appeared in the eastern sky during the earthquake. This phenomenon is unprecedented in Britain.</p>

<p>Reuters 8th, London: The Financial Times today published an article by a Shanghai merchant stating that it is fundamentally wrong to think that China has too much silver. China actually has too little silver. Shanghai does not have sufficient silver to meet the legal requirements for a small number of banknotes. Shanghai now has a large amount of silver because the interior is unstable, so it has gathered here for safety. Once the region is stable and silver needs to circulate, Shanghai's silver reserves will quickly decrease to the point where it is necessary to purchase it from abroad.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Central Government and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Fang Juehui Reports on the Situation in Guizhou Province</p>
<p>Yu Youren Speaks on the Spirit of the Provisional Constitution</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week at 9:00 AM on May 8th. Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Fang Juehui, Enhebatou, and all the staff of the Party Headquarters, a total of more than 400 people, attended. Ding Weifen presided over the ceremony. Fang Juehui reported on the inspection of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, briefly stating: "I have already reported on the inspection of Sichuan Province last time. What I am reporting on today is the general situation in Guizhou Province." The Guizhou Province Party Affairs can be divided into two points: the evolution of party affairs and the current status of party affairs. First, regarding its evolution, there was the organization of the Autonomous Society at the end of the Qing Dynasty, which was the Guizhou branch of the League. The Wuchang Uprising in 1911 was a response by Guizhou, which was due to the activities of that society. Later, due to Tang Jiyao's destruction and Liu Wangzhou's massacre, the party comrades were inevitably displaced. After the reorganization of the party in the 13th year of the Republic, the Premier sent Comrade An Shunqing to Guizhou to prepare for party affairs. In the 15th year of the Republic, the Central Committee sent Zhang Daofan and Li Yizhi back to Guizhou to organize, but Li was eventually killed in Luosi Mountain. In the 17th year of the Republic, the Central Committee sent Ping Gang to Guizhou again as the provincial steering committee to handle registration, but it was dissolved in less than a year. In the 18th year of the Republic, the Central Committee specially sent Li Zhonggong and He Jiwu back to Guizhou to preside over party affairs and determined regular expenses, which led to significant progress. Last year, it underwent another reorganization, which is the current Steering Committee. Then, regarding its current status, the provincial party headquarters has reorganized in accordance with the Central Committee's resolution in February of this year, implementing the system of reducing departments to sections and chiefs of staff. Among the county party headquarters, only Guiyang County has been formally established, organized by the provincial party headquarters to send staff to organize the Guidance Committee Office. There are seven counties. The rest are divided into fifteen party affairs districts throughout the province. Each district includes three to seven counties and establishes a Party Affairs District Commissioner's Office to guide party affairs. This can also be considered a special situation in Guizhou. In terms of party members, only 406 people hold party certificates. Excluding two people who have left the party and 32 people who have left the province, there are only 382 party members in the province. From this, we can imagine the backwardness of Guizhou's culture and the difficulty of developing party affairs. As for party affairs expenses, the provincial party headquarters has 6,000 yuan per month, the Guiyang County party headquarters has 400 yuan per month, the Party Affairs Steering Committee Office has 220 yuan per month, and the Party Affairs District Commissioner's Office has about 300 yuan per month. Mass organizations began to be organized in September of the Yun year [year unclear]. There are 72 officially established organizations of various types. The rest are all being organized due to their simplicity and low standards. From all aspects of party affairs, we can see the backwardness of the border. However, the people of Guizhou are sincere and steadfast once they believe in a doctrine, and they will never change throughout their lives. In addition, there is no reactionary force within the territory, so although there are few party members, the future of party affairs is still promising." Then Fang spoke about the governance of Guizhou Province. The Guizhou Provincial Government is organized in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee, with the exception of the addition of a military rice office and an advisory office to the secretariat. The advisory office is a special organization to accommodate political talents from the entire province. Its power is higher than the five departments. The salaries of the officials are extremely low. The provincial government chairman only receives 180 yuan per month, and other appointed officials receive between 70 and 18 yuan. Sometimes they are paid only 60% of their salary. Their clean and diligent style is unmatched by other provinces. Then, regarding finance, Guizhou Province's annual income is about 8 million yuan, and annual expenditure requires more than 15 million yuan, a difference of 7 million yuan, so they must vigorously reduce government spending. Then, regarding military affairs, the 25th Army of Mao Guangxiang's department in Guizhou Province originally had more than 60,000 people. After several reorganizations, there are now only three independent brigades, totaling more than 40,000 people. Then, regarding construction, the highways from Guiyang to the four borders have been completed for more than 1,400 li, and there are more than 30 cars. Then, regarding education, elementary schools are the most developed in Guizhou Province, and the number of female students often exceeds the number of male students. This is another special situation for the development of female education in Guizhou Province. The people of Guizhou worship Buddhism and Taoism for religion, but there is very little belief in Christianity. Then, regarding the Miao people, there are 82 types of Miao people in Guizhou Province. Some are named after directions, such as the East Miao and the West Miao. Some are named after clothing colors, such as the Green Miao, White Miao, and Flower Miao. Some are named after their place of residence, such as the Gulong and Longdong. Currently, the number of Miao people in the province is about 800,000, accounting for one-tenth of the Han population. Finally, regarding the feelings after the inspection: (1) The power of the people: Sichuan has done a very good job in handling civil defense forces, which are extremely strong and powerful. There are no bandits to be found anywhere. Guizhou's autonomy has also been quite successful, all due to the power of the people. (2) Road administration: There are many highways in Sichuan, and the highways in Guizhou also reach the four borders. Both use the conscription system and send troops to supervise repairs. One can speed up road construction, and the other can solve the livelihood of the elderly and weak soldiers. Both can be used as models. (3) The suffering of the people: Sichuan's land tax has been collected until the 30th year of the Republic. Taxes are collected according to the region, and the people feel extremely painful. Guizhou is the poorest region in China. Military pay has been assisted by Sichuan with 800,000 yuan, Hunan with 300,000 yuan, and Yunnan with 200,000 yuan. Since the 8th year of the Republic, it has stopped, so the people cannot bear the burden. (4) Characteristics of the military: The Sichuan army immediately declares war when there are conflicts of interest. However, during the war, the generals on both sides can negotiate by telephone, so there is often a war in the morning and peace in the evening, treating the war as a family quarrel. The Guizhou army is different. Once there is a conflict, they will not stop until one side is destroyed. This is the characteristic of the armies in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. After the report was completed, the ceremony was dismissed.</p>
<p>The National Government held a memorial week at 10:00 AM on the same day. Chiang Kai-shek, Shao Yuanchong, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Zhang Jinghui, Wang Shuhan, Wang Boling, Wang Boqun, Jiao Yitang, Enhebatou, Chen Bulei, Liu Shangqing, Chiang Tso-pin, Bao Wen, Zhou Fo, Wang You, Chen Qicai, Lin Xiang, Ru Yuli, Ma Fuxiang, Gong Bingfan, Liu Ruiheng, Zhuang Songfu, Chen Shaokuan, Li Shuhua, Wang Jiazhen, Zhang Wohua, Wu Siyu, and more than 300 officials from the National Government, military aides, accountants, and other offices attended. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony. Yu Youren spoke, briefly stating: "Convening a national conference and abolishing unequal treaties are two things written in the Premier's will that we will never forget. Because only by convening a national conference can all important domestic problems be solved, and only by abolishing unequal treaties can China be independent in the world. Now the National Conference has closed, and the provisional constitution for the period of political tutelage has also been promulgated by the government. The new life of the Chinese nation begins from this. The spirit of the provisional constitution is completely based on the fundamental principles of the Three Principles of the People. There are detailed provisions on how to solve people's livelihood, how to unite the nation, and how to train and exercise civil rights. However, before implementing the provisional constitution, there must be a pre-negotiated issue, namely, domestic stability and order. If domestic unity hinders order and stability, then we cannot talk about implementing the provisional constitution. In yesterday's letter to the national soldiers, Chairman Chiang reiterated the need to maintain unity and prevent civil war, hoping not to create opportunities for the Red bandits. From this factual evidence, comrades who do not understand should know where the Central Committee's intentions lie. Comrades in the Central Committee should even more sincerely support the Central Committee to achieve complete success. We must all know that the success of this campaign against the Red bandits is the success of Sun Yat-senism and the success of the Republic of China. If it fails, it is the failure of Sun Yat-senism and the failure of the Republic of China. Therefore, at a time when the Red disaster is rampant, all the people of the country and all party members should mobilize in unison and embrace the spirit of 'the past is like yesterday's death, and the future is like today's birth,' dispel misunderstandings, and work together to eliminate the communist bandits in order to complete the national revolution and implement the Three Principles of the People." Secondly, regarding the Supervisory Yuan, the Yuan recently proposed an impeachment case against Sun Weishan, the magistrate of Yuhe County, for illegally collecting waste bone donations. The National Government has clearly ordered the Hebei Provincial Government to thoroughly investigate, but the magistrate plans to publish a rebuttal in Tianjin, believing that the Supervisory Yuan should not impeach the magistrate with two-cent stamps. Little does he know that these two-cent stamps are also paid for by the people. The powers of the Supervisory Yuan are granted by the government. Even without these two-cent stamps, it has the power to impeach. The waste bone donations collected by the magistrate are unheard of in other places. The magistrate's ability to scrape a little oil off waste bones is truly skilled. The magistrate believes that this is a trivial matter, and the Supervisory Yuan does not need to intervene. In fact, this matter is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Supervisory Yuan should propose an impeachment for the sake of exercising its powers. In addition, there is the issue of plowing cattle. Recently, there have been many exports, most of which are food supplies, such as steak. Its impact on agriculture is significant, so in recent years, due to the export of plowing cattle, rich farmers have become middle farmers, middle farmers have become poor farmers, and finally they are displaced. Although the slaughter of cattle was prohibited in the late Qing Dynasty, there were still not enough plowing cattle. If restrictions are not added now, agricultural production will be greatly affected in the future. Some people believe that if there are not enough plowing cattle, they can be replaced by machines. In fact, this method is not applicable to small farmers. I hope that all localities will pay close attention to problems that seem small but are actually of great concern in the future. After the report was completed, the meeting was dismissed.</p>

<p>Doctors Say He is Completely Out of Danger</p>
<p>Zhang Qun and Shang Zhen Both Visited the Sick</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Deputy Commander Zhang's condition has gradually improved since he moved to the Union Hospital for quiet recuperation. According to Tianjin Mayor Zhang Xueming and Beijing Mayor Hu Ruoyu, the Deputy Commander's condition as of 12:00 PM the night before (2nd) had dropped to 37.5 degrees Celsius and his pulse was 79, which is very close to normal. He was also able to sleep peacefully at night and was in better spirits than the previous two days. Mayors Zhang and Hu and Zhu Guangmu and others are still taking turns caring for him day and night. He can recover after a quiet rest for ten days. Mrs. Zhang Yu Fengzhi did not go to the hospital to serve him because she also had a cold a few days ago and is currently resting at home.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on the 4th, at 10:00 AM, Chairman Chiang's representative Zhang Qun and Chairman Jin's Shang Zhen went to the Union Hospital to visit Deputy Commander Zhang. After receiving special permission to visit the ward, they expressed their condolences. However, in accordance with the doctor's instructions, they were not allowed to talk, so they immediately withdrew and asked the chief physician about everything before leaving the hospital and returning home. Deputy Commander Zhang's condition, temperature, and pulse were the same as the previous day, and everything went smoothly. According to the doctor, Deputy Commander Zhang is suffering from a mild form of enteric fever, known as [Japanese term] in Japan. The doctor confirmed that he is now completely out of danger. After another two weeks of quiet rest, the fever should subside and he will recover. In general, regardless of who has enteric fever, it must go through three weeks. There is no special treatment method during these three weeks, only quiet rest and not eating, while protecting the heart and waiting for the disease to subside on its own. This type of disease can naturally be cured in more than nine out of ten cases, unless they are particularly weak or do not follow medical advice and eat and move around randomly, causing the intestinal wall to bleed, in which case there is absolutely no danger.</p>
<p>Also, Zhang Qun, after visiting Deputy Commander Zhang, told people that the Deputy Commander's illness had indeed improved yesterday, and his diet was normal. He is now resting quietly and cannot see guests or talk. He is expected to recover within about two weeks. (June 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Oppression of Overseas Chinese by Soviet Russia <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Every Possible Means to Prevent Remittances Home</p>
<p>Those Who Flee the Country Privately Are Shot Dead by Border Guards. Harbin Correspondence: There are frequent reports of Soviet Russia mistreating overseas Chinese. Although the Northeast authorities have repeatedly negotiated, the Russian side has ignored them. This spring, the Russian authorities in Vladivostok confiscated the properties of overseas Chinese such as Wang Rinan. Despite repeated protests from Xu Xiongzhang, the Consul General in Vladivostok, the Russian government has refused to return them, claiming they are in arrears with their taxes. However, this is only the most obvious incident. There are countless others who have been mistreated and unable to return home to complain. Recently, a secret report from a certain consulate in Russia to the Northeast authorities detailed the Russian government's maltreatment of overseas Chinese, causing great indignation. The authorities have issued orders to all agencies in the Northeast to pay close attention and to try to dissuade anyone from going to Soviet Russia again. In addition, Mo Dehui was instructed to negotiate with Russia in the immediate vicinity. The original report from the consulate is recorded below: Since the founding of the Soviet Union, its administration and legislation have been primarily for its own benefit, and its laws and regulations have no permanent nature. What is promulgated today can be repealed tomorrow. It does not consider whether its measures comply with international law or violate morality. Therefore, foreign nationals residing in the Soviet Union, except for those with contractual provisions, are generally at a loss and have no protection for their property or lives. Countless people are groaning in prisons under tyranny. Since the advent of global communication, all foreign nationals who have obtained assets through legitimate labor within the scope of the laws of the host country have been recognized as their property, regardless of the laws of any country or the principles of any legal theory, and they have the right to dispose of them at will. However, the Soviet government, taking the strange view that if Chinese residing in the Soviet Union were allowed to freely accumulate and remit their earnings back home, it would be detrimental to the Soviet treasury, devised a unique and unprecedented example: allowing Chinese to work in the Soviet Union but not allowing them to remit their wages back home. There are no privately established banks in the Soviet Union other than its state-run national bank. The national bank is an agency of the Soviet government, and everything is subject to government orders. When overseas Chinese submit money for remittance, it is invariably rejected. If they attempt to carry it with them when leaving the Soviet Union, it is also prohibited. If wages cannot be remitted back home, the livelihood of overseas Chinese in the Soviet Union is cut off. Therefore, Chinese who used to work as laborers in gold mines and lumberyards have returned home one after another. This happened three years ago. Subsequently, the Soviet Union recruited Russians in places like Linshen, Badai, Bakshe, and Linmuzha to replace them. However, Russians are lazy by nature and not accustomed to hard work. They only work eight hours a day and must be paid extremely high wages, special work clothes, and insurance, etc., which is very costly. The gains are minimal. In less than a year, the gold mines had already suffered heavy losses and had to devise other deceptive tricks to attract Chinese laborers back to work. In 1928, the Soviet Russian government promulgated a special set of regulations: Chinese who go to the gold mines to pan for gold are allowed to remit 75% of their monthly wages back home through a certificate issued by the gold mine's accounting department to the national bank. As a result, overseas Chinese seeking small profits flocked to the area, and the Soviet Union's gold mining industry was revitalized. Once the number of workers in the gold mines was sufficient, the Soviet side reduced the amount of remittances. Initially, it was stipulated that each worker should spend at least 40% or 50% of their wages on food, clothing, and housing in the mine area. Based on this standard, each worker could remit at most 60% or 50% per month. Before long, the Soviet government considered this remittance rate too high and reduced it to only 25% of wages per month. Even after implementing this restriction, it was still considered insufficient. They further exploited the weaknesses of the Chinese by setting up brothels and gambling dens throughout the gold mine areas, enticing the Chinese to indulge so that their wages would be spent as much as possible in the place where they worked. What was gained here was lost here. The baseness of their administration and the insidiousness of their intentions can be said to be the height of their capabilities, and the overseas Chinese who have fallen into this sea of misery have no hope of seeing the light of day again. As for those honest and law-abiding overseas Chinese who are not corrupted by prostitution and gambling and still carefully save their wages, wanting to escape this ominous lair, it is extremely dangerous. Generally, the Soviet gold mines are scattered in sparsely populated areas, located thousands of miles away, obstructed by towering mountains and dangerous rivers with tigers and leopards. Those who do not pass through the official routes rarely return alive. If they carry money through the official routes, they must pass through checkpoints, where they are searched every time they pass through a checkpoint. Any money, gold dust, or other valuables are confiscated. If the amount of confiscated money is large, the person carrying the money is detained and imprisoned. Furthermore, Soviet law requires that a record be made of all confiscated money and property. In addition to recording the facts, if the victim has any objections or statements, they should be included in the record for review. However, when Russians make records, they often do not abide by legal regulations and fabricate Chinese confessions, claiming that the money confiscated from the Chinese was collected from other Chinese in an attempt to smuggle it out of the country. Sometimes, they do not even make a record. The money is confiscated, and the person is released. Whenever overseas Chinese who have suffered this kind of loss report it to the consulate, when negotiations are initiated with the local Soviet officials, for those with records, they cite the fact that the Chinese have already confessed to trying to smuggle it out of the country, so it is naturally confiscated according to regulations and will not be returned. For those without records, the Russian officials simply do not acknowledge that there was any confiscation of money. The Communist Party is barbarous and rogue-like, and it can be said that there is no other like it in the world. Since those who escape are treated in this way, those responsible for protecting overseas Chinese can only stand by empty-handed and shout in vain. It has been found that it is so difficult for Chinese workers in the gold mines to carry money through the official routes that they have to risk taking a detour through the dense forests to try to escape. Those who are fortunate enough not to fall into gullies or encounter leopards and manage to survive to Heihe or other border locations still cannot escape the final danger. Those who obtain official Soviet exit visas and pass through the border checkpoints to return home are subjected to extremely strict searches. Every item and box is opened for inspection. Clothes and bedding are ripped open with scissors, and trunks are split open with iron axes. The person leaving the country is ordered into a special inspection room, where all outer and inner clothing is removed. Men are inspected by male inspectors, and women are inspected by female inspectors. If there are any suspicious signs, they even go as far as doctors examining patients, examining the inside of the lower body. Where is humanity? The insult is extreme. Overseas Chinese with money who do not obtain formal visas and want to escape privately across the frozen Heilongjiang River are constantly patrolled by border guards and cavalry. If a fugitive is spotted, the regulations for martial law are invoked. First, a warning shot is fired to order them to stop. If they do not stop after the warning shot, they can be shot. Only two or three out of ten people who try to escape privately are not captured by the Soviet border guards, and there are frequent reports of people being shot dead by Russian soldiers. Such treatment of overseas Chinese is rarely seen among humans. It has been found that if the Soviet Union does not have Chinese workers, its gold mines and lumberyards cannot be sustained. If they employ Chinese but do not allow them to remit money, even though there are special regulations clearly stipulating that remittances are allowed, in reality, remittances are still not permitted. Once the goal of attracting Chinese workers is achieved, the special regulations are suspended. It is said that the Soviet side is now doing everything possible to prevent Chinese workers in the gold mines from returning home. The Chinese have the obligation to work but not the right to enjoy their wages. This is no different from bandits robbing and kidnapping. The Soviet Union's treatment of our overseas Chinese is so cruel that it is far worse than our treatment of Soviet citizens in northern Manchuria, who are treated with kindness and given clear legal protection. If we do not treat this barbaric government in the same way that they treat our overseas Chinese, I fear they will never realize their error. According to the principle of international equality and reciprocity, it seems appropriate to adopt the same methods to treat them. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Shanxi Court Burns Opium <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Opium Spreads in Shanxi, No. 1 in the Nation</p>
<p>Annual Losses of Several Tens of Millions of Yuan. Taiyuan Correspondence: Yesterday was the anniversary of Commissioner Lin Zexu's burning of opium. The Shanxi Higher and Local Courts specially invited representatives from party, government, military, academic, newspaper, and other organizations to the Zhongshan Park at 2:00 PM yesterday to jointly supervise the burning of a large batch of opium and drugs. A total of over 6,700 taels of processed opium and opium dross, over 6,000 taels of raw materials for "golden pills," 126 boxes and over 20 bags of packaged opium were burned, totaling over 10,000 taels of drugs and 67 baskets of smoking paraphernalia and other sundries. According to court statistics, the items burned this time were seized in the past two years. The total amount of processed opium seized in the past two years exceeds the total amount seized in the ten years from 1919 to 1928 by over 1,000 taels, proving that the amount of opium in Shanxi has increased sharply in recent years. It is estimated that the value of the items burned this time is over 3 million yuan. However, the amount of drugs seized by the authorities is only one or two percent of the total. Moreover, the opium seized over the years has all been sent to the village administration for the distribution of peace opium cessation medicine, which is also a huge sum. Based on this, it can be imagined how much money is being lost from Shanxi every year. It has been found that most of the drugs seized in recent years are raw materials for "golden pills" and processed opium, indicating that Shanxi has definitely shifted from trafficking to manufacturing. The danger of the situation is truly alarming. Therefore, the public was extremely enthusiastic about attending the burning yesterday. First, the court transported the various drugs in batches to the park in many large carts and displayed them for everyone to view. Then, Shao Xiuwen, the president of the Higher Court, presided over the memorial meeting. Over 200 representatives attended. After paying respects, Shao and Wu Zhenduo, a representative from the Anti-Drug Association, gave speeches. Shao's succinct words were that if the "golden pills" and opium dross are not eliminated, the people of Shanxi will be wiped out in a few decades. The prevalence of "golden pills" and opium dross is definitely the highest in Shanxi. The burning began around 4:00 PM and the event was adjourned. June 4th.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Mr. Ma Yinchu's Opinion on the Private Bank Law (Continued) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>This is a general report on the issue of the Private Bank Law. I believe that there is no reason to draft this law, because the private banking industry does not primarily focus on lending on credit. Is it the same as a bank in terms of business? Because banks engage in the business of accepting deposits and lending, and private banks also engage in the business of accepting deposits and lending. Banks engage in the buying and selling of raw gold, and private banks also engage in the buying and selling of raw gold. We cannot think of any differences between them, so it is difficult to regulate them separately. If separate regulations are made, then in the future, for social occupations, there will also have to be a Barber Law for barbers, a Rickshaw Puller Law for rickshaw pullers, and a Tailor Law for tailors, which will be too numerous to handle. Since the businesses done by banks and private banks are of the same nature, we have included them together. If their natures are different, then of course separate regulations can be made. To ask where the current business done by private banks differs from that of banks, the only difference is that private banks cannot issue banknotes, while banks can issue banknotes. However, private banks in the interior also issue paper money, and regarding this aspect, we will gradually eliminate the right of commercial banks to issue banknotes in the future. Therefore, although banks and private banks have different names, they are actually the same. There is no need to draft a separate Private Bank Law. This is my opinion on the Private Bank Law. Since the promulgation of the Banking Law, private banks have believed that Article 1 of the Banking Law includes private banks, considering private banks to be subordinate to banks. This is a great misunderstanding. We believe that if a private bank is reorganized into a general partnership, then the position of a general partnership is above that of a bank organized as a joint-stock company. Why do we say this? A general partnership not only requires the pooling of capital but also requires each person to contribute their labor in order to succeed. It places emphasis on what is called personality, and therefore it can be called a Personality Company. Not just anyone can become a shareholder. It is necessary to see what the shareholder's personality is like. The person must be talented, or morally upright, or have a high reputation. Only when the person's personality is high can the company be valued by society. If the personality of the shareholders is not valued, then the company will also be affected. From this point of view, the personality of the shareholders is greatly related to the company, so it can be called a Personality Company. On the contrary, almost all current banks are organized as joint-stock companies, and joint-stock companies are completely opposite to general partnerships. It does not matter who becomes a shareholder. As long as the prescribed share capital is paid, the moral value of the person can be completely ignored. Even the directors of the company are not directly responsible for the debts. The entity responsible is the joint-stock company itself. Joint-stock companies must solicit share capital from all over the world and cannot investigate each individual's character and personality before admitting them as shareholders. The reason is that a general partnership is established by a small number of people who know each other well, so they can gather people with a high level of credit. As for joint-stock companies, their shares can be bought and sold at any time, so today's shareholder may be a respectable person, but tomorrow he may sell his shares to someone with a questionable personality. All is unknown. Therefore, if one must investigate personality, then the company will only not succeed. The company cannot control the personality of the shareholders. In essence, joint-stock companies have no relationship to personality. They only pool capital, so they can be called Capital Companies. From this, it can be seen that a general partnership is a Personality Company and a joint-stock company is a Capital Company. It can be seen that the position of a general partnership is far above that of a joint-stock company. How can it be said that a private bank is subordinate to a bank? In legal terms, one emphasizes personality and one emphasizes capital. One who emphasizes personality is naturally above one who emphasizes capital. Therefore, the Banking Law does not regard private banks as subordinate to banks. (End)</p>

<p>Chambers of Commerce in Various Industries Discuss Business Tax. The issue of business tax in Wu County has not been resolved due to the fact that the tax rate and amount have not been determined, so it is still in stalemate. Now that the Business Tax Law has been promulgated, the county chamber of commerce specially convened a meeting of representatives from various industries on the 8th. Sixty-seven representatives from forty industries attended. Chairman Shi Junqing reported that the chamber of commerce had previously entrusted Cheng Ganqing to go to the provincial finance department to contact Section Chief Chen, but to no avail. The Business Tax Bureau has sent a declaration form requesting assistance, and it has been distributed to various businesses with the hope that they will accurately fill it out and submit it to the chamber within the deadline. It was resolved that (1) the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce should be consulted on the progress of the business tax and whether the reported business tax rate has been submitted to the ministry for review. (2) The county chambers of commerce should be contacted to inquire whether they have expressed any opinions on the provincial and municipal tax rates and the starting date for collection. Paying the Busy Season Grain Tax Must Not Be Done Privately. Yuan Xiaogu, the Director of the Finance Bureau, stated that because the deadline for the busy season grain tax in the old Changyuan and Wu counties had passed, the tax receipts for each household should follow the old procedure of being collected and issued by the financial police, who would hold a list of each precinct and press each household to pay the tax within a fixed time limit. The director is now cutting off the process of issuing tax receipts and demanding payment and has presented the order to the county magistrate and district chiefs to inform the township and town chiefs and deputy propaganda officers to inform the grain households. If the tax collectors holding the unpaid tax receipts come to collect the busy season grain tax, they should promptly pay it and must obtain the tax receipts from the tax collector. If the payment is made to the tax collector but the tax receipts are not obtained, they must not entrust others to pay on their behalf privately. If the tax collector embezzles the money, the rice-growing household shall be responsible. County Magistrate Huang, upon receiving the report, ordered the district chiefs to comply with the order yesterday.</p>
<p>The Entire Committee for Soliciting Public Bonds Resigns. County Magistrate Huang of Wu County, in order to comply with the order to solicit 200,000 yuan in construction public bonds, immediately hired Zhang Yi and 14 others to serve as solicitation committee members and organized a committee to carry out the solicitation. However, the committee members believed that this construction public bond was not for use in Wu County but for construction in various counties in Jiangbei, and that Wu County had already shouldered construction surcharges and various public bonds last year, and the burden on the public was already extreme. They were unable to bear the construction public bond again. On the 8th, they separately presented a letter to the county government, the finance department, and the provincial government, expressing their collective resignation.</p>

<p>Counterfeit Banknotes of a Certain Bank Mixed in the Market. Although this year's silkworm cocoon market is not even two-tenths of what it was last year, the market is still slightly lively. Unexpectedly, large numbers of counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of a certain bank have been mixed in the city in recent days. Criminals are using them to purchase small items from various merchants, and the number of victims is unknown. According to investigations by reporters, some of the criminals using counterfeit banknotes are dressed luxuriously and wear gemstone rings, while the rest are mostly young children. The Sun Siquan incense shop and others outside the North Gate Altar Lane have been victimized by purchasers who bought items worth only a few jiao and paid with counterfeit five-yuan banknotes. Countless other shops have also been victimized. The public security authorities have begun investigations and are asking to prevent speculation by silk factories. Hui Jizhi, the standing director of the joint council of the local silk factory industry and labor union, believes that most entrepreneurs in various places are engaging in industry by being cunning and opportunistic, raising a small amount of capital and then renting a factory to start work. They then use this to attract loans and treat their workers as slaves. They pay no attention to the necessary equipment stipulated by factory laws. Fortunately, if they are successful and become rich, they see their methods as a shortcut to wealth and adhere to them without making any improvements. Unfortunately, if they suffer a setback, they simply flee. Those who are cunning and fraudulent become entangled in lawsuits, affecting people's livelihoods, disrupting the industry, disrupting the social economy, and harming workers' welfare. This is the most serious problem. During the previous attendance at the National Assembly, it was proposed that the central government stipulate by law the minimum amount of capital and the minimum necessary equipment for establishing a factory, and that the responsible departments should inspect and verify this to prevent speculation, harm to the industry, and harm to workers' welfare. The proposal was passed. Speculation is most prevalent in silk factories. Now that the silkworm cocoon market is about to open, if this case is not regulated and implemented, not only will speculators continue to mingle in the market, but it will also be difficult to improve the necessary equipment. Therefore, the original proposal was attached yesterday and presented to County Magistrate Pan for review and approval. The proposal requests that the provincial government forward the case to the National Government and the responsible departments to promptly investigate the matter, stipulate the method of implementation, and order the provincial governments to instruct their subordinates to inspect and verify it in order to prevent speculation and maintain the industry.</p>

The local security corps reported the incident and immediately dispatched corps members to hire civilian boats to join the town's security corps in arresting the criminal, but he had already vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Bandits in Chaidang Village Mistakenly Injure a Comrade. Around 8:00 PM the night before last, several bandits suddenly arrived in Chaidang Village, Eighth District, firing shots to show their power. They were about to rob the village when the villagers heard the noise and beat gongs to warn the others. They also rushed to report to the district corps headquarters. District Corps Chief Dai immediately led his men to pursue the bandits, who had already fled. Before leaving, they mistakenly injured one of their comrades, who was lying in a pool of blood, on the verge of death. A pistol and bullets were found on his body. The wounded bandit was taken to the Baihejiang Hospital for treatment, but he died the next morning due to his severe injuries. The county government reported the incident, and Investigator Guo Enguang personally led an examination team to investigate. They found that the deceased had indeed been shot to death.

<p>Residents of Liuhai Attacked Survey Team: The waterway for flood discharge from the lower reaches of the Sigan River in Shazhou City of this county must pass through the Liuhai Sandbank, which belongs to Nanhui County. Therefore, Chen Qiwei, the Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, went to Nantong before the Sigan River was dredged to have an in-depth discussion with the Nanhui County Magistrate and the Director of the Construction Bureau regarding the river's flood discharge issue. As a result, an agreement was reached with Nantong to take a shortcut into the Yangtze River between the five and six Weirs bordering the Jisheng Case and the Yicheng Case of Liuhai. This was then submitted to the provincial departments for approval. The dredging of the lower reaches of the Sigan River has now reached a satisfactory stage in this county, but the dredging of the flood discharge route is urgently needed. This county dispatched a survey team led by Zhao Wenxuan to the countryside to start the survey. Unexpectedly, when Zhao arrived at the sandbank and was about to begin work, two to three hundred residents of Liuhai surrounded the survey team, creating a threatening situation and prohibiting the survey. When Zhao refused to comply, a conflict arose. The surveying equipment Zhao brought was destroyed, and the surveyor Chen Yusheng was taken away and his whereabouts are unknown.

<p>County Magistrate Zhang Requests Instructions and Returns to Nantong: Nantong County Magistrate Zhang Dong recently went to the province to seek instructions on various important local issues concerning public security, finance, and vehicle donations. He returned to Nantong on the 7th and made the following statements: (1) The disaster in the rural areas has not been quelled, and the district heads have no protection when handling cases, so they have submitted their resignations collectively. The county government is currently unable to concurrently handle judicial affairs, making it difficult to deal with banditry cases. Chairman Ye has agreed to provide relief during this visit and has approved the proposal for county magistrates of Nantong, Wujin, and other counties to be temporarily exempted from concurrently handling judicial affairs, according to a provincial telegram. (2) Nantong's provincial tax revenue is 90,000 yuan per year, but expenditures reach over 200,000 yuan per year. The Director of the Finance Bureau cannot help but misappropriate special funds, and it has become a common practice for various departments to send telegrams to detain funds upon his transfer. This time, it was approved that the Finance Department should limit the issuance of payment orders in the future. (3) Regarding the strike against donations for automobiles and rickshaws, the Construction Department stated that the drivers must first register and pay off the outstanding donations before the donation reduction can be approved. The provincial government has not yet received any telegrams from the headquarters regarding the matters of wounded soldiers and factories.</p>
<p>Police Officers Throughout the County Strive for Public Safety Acreage Donation: Police officers throughout Nantong County are striving for the Public Safety Acreage Donation, which has already raised 120,000 yuan, but has actually been completely misappropriated by the Fund Management Office. They are currently requesting funds from the office, and if there are no results, they will petition the province.</p>

The police teams of Huai'an and Lianshui counties jointly searched the area within Lianshui County but failed to rescue them. Then, on the 29th of the previous month, Wang Haicen, the leader of the Lianshui Temporary Guerrilla Team, received a report that Zhang Tingyuan's house in Zhangzhuang, at the border between Huai and Lian, was hiding kidnapped victims. He immediately led a team to search and found a cellar in Tingyuan's kitchen. In addition to arresting Tingyuan and a bandit named Liu Fengwu, they also rescued five kidnapped victims from the cellar: He Xiuwen from Banzha, two boys from Zhang Zhankui's family, a boy from Ren Kaifu's family in Huai'an, and two boys from Zhu Liwu's family in Sanliwan, Huai'an.

<p>Wu Nanxuan Continues to Submit Resignation: Beijing, 8th. A central telegram stated that the Tsinghua student unrest has reached a stalemate. Professors and students are strongly opposed to Wu. Wu has continued to submit his resignation to the Ministry of Education, but he is determined not to abandon his responsibility before it is approved. Wu stated that running a school requires the use of tactics, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in various countries. Yu Ning is a victim of other people's tactics and does not want to use tactics to destroy righteousness. The Ministry of Education also telegraphed Jiang Menglin, hoping that he would take into consideration the government's prestige and quickly quell the school's student unrest, and ordered him to handle it with full authority.

<h3 id="e106">Ministry of Education Explains Matters Concerning Student Self-Government Associations <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education urgently instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education that the Nantong County Education Bureau reported that the promulgated "Outline of the Student Self-Government Association" and its implementation rules had been followed by all schools under its jurisdiction. However, after examining Article 2 of the implementation rules, the term "competent authority" in the "Outline of the Student Self-Government Association" refers to the county government in counties and the municipal government in cities, which is the same as the example in Article 10, Paragraph 3 of the Education Association Law, which states that the supervisory body of the County Education Association and its District Education Association is the county government. Currently, communications between the Education Association and the Education Bureau still use orders and reports, and the same format is used between the Education Bureau and the Student Self-Government Association. It seems that the precedent of communications between the Education Bureau and the Education Association should be followed, but there is no clear written regulation, so they dare not make a decision without authorization. The Ministry of Education instructed: "Received the report. The format of communications between the Education Bureau and the Student Self-Government Association may follow the example of communications between the Education Bureau and the Education Association, using orders and reports. Inform and instruct accordingly."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education also received a report from the Shandong Provincial Department of Education, which reported that the Taian County Magistrate telegraphed to request instructions on whether the design of the Student Self-Government Association's emblem should be issued according to the designs of other labor unions. The Ministry of Education instructed: "Received the report. The regulations for the production of emblems for social organizations have already been promulgated by this Ministry's Order No. 750. According to the provisions of the revised plan for people's organizations, the Student Self-Government Association is a social organization, so the design of the emblem should comply with these regulations for the production of emblems for social organizations. Inform and instruct accordingly."</p>

The recent revision of these regulations has added a medical vocational school. The report was submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government for filing and notification to all departments and bureaus and all vocational schools. In addition to the medical colleges or independent medical departments established by the regulations for universities, this Ministry also allows the establishment of medical and pharmaceutical vocational schools. The old medical and pharmaceutical vocational schools can be reorganized and continued based on their original foundation in accordance with the Vocational School Organization Law and the revised vocational school regulations.

<h3 id="e122">Yesterday's Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to issue six urgent telegrams</p>
<p>The main purpose is to work together to suppress bandits</p>
<p>And jointly maintain peace and unification The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held an extraordinary general meeting of members in the conference hall at 2 p.m. yesterday. More than 200 representatives from various industries discussed how to express their opinions on the current situation. It was resolved to issue six urgent telegrams with the main purpose of maintaining peace and unification and working together to suppress bandits. The details of the meeting and the telegrams sent are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Staff: Presidium: Wang Xiaolai, Wang</p>
<p>Yansong, Xu Ji, Yuan Ludeng. Recorder: Zhou Songxun. Secretary:</p>
<p>Sun Mingqi, Xue Guangqian, Zhang Bofang, Jin Shengbai, Zhang Yukun, Luo Shiying, Ren Shoupeng.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: (1) Jiang (ringing the bell) to start the meeting; (2) All stand at attention; (3) Pay the highest respect to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Premier; (4) The Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Silent mourning; (6) Discuss the case of how the Chamber of Commerce should express its opinion on the current situation; (7) Adjourn the meeting.</p>
<p>Discussion Process: After the meeting started, Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that this representative conference was convened because of the current situation. The Standing Committee proposed and the Executive Committee decided to convene an extraordinary general meeting of members to discuss, in order to express the opinions of the merchants and people of this city. A total of eight proposals have been received from the representatives, and each of them will be reported first as the basis for discussion, and then the representatives present are invited to express their opinions and discuss solutions together. Then Wang Yansong expressed his</p>
<p>views, briefly saying that since the establishment of the National Government, various political and livelihood aspects at home and abroad have been actively implemented and have achieved considerable results. Now that the Guangdong incident has occurred, its foreign influence prevents the immediate abolition of unequal treaties, giving foreigners an excuse, and the internal obstruction of bandit suppression prevents the central army from concentrating its forces to suppress the communists. At this critical moment of survival, the people should have their say, the main points of which should be: (1) Hoping that the Guangdong side will not make the overall situation糜爛 because of the problem of one or two people; (2) Hoping that party disputes should be resolved legally within the party. In short, today's discussion should be confined to maintaining peace and unification, and the country's expectations should not go beyond this. Then the representatives present successively expressed their opinions: (1) Wu Yunzhai said that the Chamber of Commerce should uphold justice and fairness and issue a declaration so that the Guangdong side can幡然覺悟 and not give the communists an opportunity to cause diplomatic stagnation; otherwise, the people will suffer and both industry and commerce will fall into desperation. (2) Luo Qinghua said that the Chamber of Commerce should take reaching and maintaining peace and unification as the principle, and as for how to express it in order to achieve it, it can be discussed based on the proposal. (3) Chen Liangyu said that a telegram should be sent to the chambers of commerce of various provinces and cities to jointly advocate the formation of a strong and powerful public opinion. (4) Lin Kanghou said that the resolution of the general meeting should take maintaining peace and working together to suppress bandits as the principle, and the methods can be divided into: (A) Sending a telegram to the central government; (B) Persuading Chen Jitang; (C) Sending a telegram to various provinces and cities. In addition, should there be any further expressions, please discuss it. (5) Zhang Meian said that it is possible to speak from the perspective of the merchants and people of the whole city. The first step should be to work together to suppress bandits, which is internal. The second step is to maintain peace and unification, which is external, because only peace and unification can be折衝樽俎. (6) Lu Qisheng said that the people should distinguish right from wrong and blame Chen Jitang for not lightly starting a war and overstepping the norm. (7) Lin Kanghou said that after the resolution of the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce can send telegrams to the chambers of commerce of various provinces and cities to express their opinions together. In addition, Yang Housheng, Wen Lanting, Cheng Guichu, Huang Fuqing, Qiu Zhidao, Fang Jiren, Chuan Zai, Gao Luxiao, Shao Bao Xing, Xie Zhongle, Xie Fengxiang, Shen Qinglin, Mao Zifang, Zheng Hairuo, Shen Xusheng, Chen Yushu, Luo Hongchan, Wang Jinwen, Hua Chengjin, Yao Run, Zhu Zhenhan, Dong Guitao, Xu Jingzhi, Wang Yunzhang, Xu Chao, Lu Jingwen, Ge Jechen, Xin Wenyao, Yang Shenzhai, Yu Zhiqing, Deng Yunfu, Li Guohua, Wang Hongxiang, Chen Zixiang, Gong Jingyan, Shao Yuerun, Luo Huanzhang, Gu Baoshan, etc. successively put forward proposals. Later, the chairman adopted the opinions of the representatives and expressed and passed the following proposals: (1) Telegraphed the central government to resolve the</p>
<p>Guangdong incident in a political way; (2) Telegraphed Chairman Chiang to support him in going to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of bandits; (3) Telegraphed Hu Weiyuan Zhantang, requesting him to telegraph the Guangdong side to explain the great righteousness and not overstep the norm; (4) Telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chen to advise him not to be the initiator of the war; (5) Telegraphed Minister Sun Zhesheng, requesting him to abide by the Premier's will, maintain peace and unification, and handle it properly in coordination with the advanced members of the party; (6) Telegraphed the chambers of commerce of various provinces and cities, requesting them to advocate it unanimously, and resolved that the above six telegrams should be drafted by the standing committee members and jointly recommended by the representatives of the general meeting, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Liangyu, Lao Jingxiu, Wen Lanting, Lu Qisheng, and Luo Qinghua and other seven representatives to sign and review and then issue them after verification. After the meeting, at 5 o'clock, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting. After the adjournment, the Standing Committee continued to work with the representatives designated by the General Assembly to draft various telegrams and issued them that night.</p>
<p>Telegram 1: To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the National Government, the Party Headquarters of various provinces and cities, and the Governments of various provinces: Since the four supervisors of Deng, Lin, and Xiao issued a telegram, the situation has become increasingly serious. Although the advanced members of the party have tried to resolve it by peaceful and appropriate means, the effect has not been significant, and the reaction has been heard from time to time, and the public's psychology has been extremely worried. The above-mentioned military affairs in Henan Province ended last year, and the central government distributed elite troops from the front line in Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces to vigorously suppress bandits. It has been half a year since then, and they are still fighting each other in close combat. Not only has there been no time to sweep away the caves and capture the chief, but the bandits' tracks are erratic and they take advantage of loopholes. Even in the areas that have been recovered, they still come back from time to time. Therefore, although the bandit flames seem to be slightly weakening, the people's difficulties have not been greatly eased. What they have been expecting day and night is that the national army's strength is actually superior to the bandits' strength, but it can only be searched for a long time, step by step, and there will eventually be a day when they can be surrounded and annihilated. If the bandit suppression troops are forced to transfer due to the general trend, then the previous events of hungry tigers leaving their cages, Changsha being recaptured last year, and Nanchang being on the verge of danger will not be difficult to repeat. The Yangtze River basin will be permanently reduced to a bandit area, and even the area south of the Five Ridges will not be spared. It is no different</p>
<p>to supply the lives of the Chinese nation to the孤注 of a few people. Moreover, the hidden dangers are more than just this. When Feng and Yan fought each other last year, it was the day of the famine in the Northwest. Traffic was blocked and relief food was cut off, resulting in the starvation of 2 million people in Shaanxi Province alone. Moreover, the elderly and weak were displaced, and their women were mostly贩易 by merchants everywhere. The disaster was unprecedented. Since the end of the anti-rebellion military affairs, although the Northwest relief efforts have been carried out smoothly, if the bandit suppression cannot be ended for a day, the army cannot be demobilized for a day, and the country will not be able to free up a large amount of financial resources to prepare for famine relief. Therefore, the 8 million yuan of relief public bonds were discussed but not implemented, and the branch-section relief was of little benefit. According to reports, the population of Shaanxi Province has recently decreased by nearly one-third, and in Gansu Province, more than 60 of the 70 counties in the province have been affected by the disaster, and more than one million people have starved to death. Therefore, the most important task of the country today is to gather the financial resources of the whole country to engage in large-scale famine relief.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should use the national army to engage in large-scale bandit suppression. If the war breaks out again, the financial and military resources will not be able to take care of both. We can only sit back and watch the country become a bandit area, the people become starving people, and what will become of the country? Since ancient times, there have been cases of ethnic groups dying out but the country still existing. As the saying goes, the one who gains the Tao gets more help, and the one who loses the Tao gets little help. Political life must be built on the foundation of public opinion. The ambitious warlords who have been exhausted by military force for the past 20 years have all borrowed names and relied on force to</p>
<p>treat public opinion as a plaything. In the end, Jia rose and Yi fell, and the destruction followed one after another. At present, the most urgent political affairs that public opinion recognizes are bandit suppression, famine relief, and the abolition of unequal treaties. Since the Guangdong incident caused disputes, foreigners have stopped negotiations on treaty revisions. The parties involved are indulging in temporary emotions and jeopardizing the great plan for a hundred years, which is already a shame to the people. As for how to improve political facilities, all parties should meet each other frankly and have plenty of time to discuss, but bandit suppression has entered a period of life and death that does not allow for any delay. Recently, since the Guangdong East will</p>
<p>The blocking troops were withdrawn to Guangzhou, and the bandit flames are raging again. Newspaper reports say that the refugees fleeing with the army there numbered as many as 50,000, and the old and weak were all poisoned. The war has not yet fully broken out, and the poison has already reached this point. If there is no awakening and political affairs are used to restrain bandit suppression, it is no different from prolonging the life of the Red bandits, and there is no escape from the blame of harming the people and misleading the country. Moreover, using military means to resolve political disputes is no different from抱薪救火. The precedents shown in history are clear lessons. Since we are under the banner of governing the country by the party, the political merits and demerits should be judged and handled by the party, and there is a proper way to solve them. If we do not do this and insist on repeating the old tricks of the past 20 years, it is tantamount to destroying the great righteousness of party governance and being willing to be an appendage of military governance. Even if we are happy for a while, we will also be a sinner of the party and the country. Moreover, party comrades should maintain each other with a spirit of love, and friends should advise and persuade each other, which is especially the teaching of our country's sages. At this difficult and pioneering stage, all political matters have not yet been brought into the orbit of things, and all facilities cannot be said to be without any shortcomings that can be criticized, but they should be corrected before the event with the meaning of criticism and good advice, and should not be left as a pretext for later military affairs with an attitude of indulgence and tolerance. The Association convened an extraordinary meeting of member representatives on August 8 of this month for detailed discussion. They all said that since the telegram of the four supervisors was based on the party's position as its starting point, all disputes should be handled properly in accordance with the party constitution. If we resort to military affairs, it is tantamount to destroying the party's governance.</p>
<p>Life and death also destroy the life and death of the Chinese nation, starting with loving the party and the country and ending with misleading the party and the country. We dare to sincerely request, hoping to follow the advice of the advanced members of the party and the common psychology of the people, and not to seek solutions by any means other than peaceful and appropriate means, so as to preserve the life of the nation.</p>
<p>The hope of喘喘 is that all people will say the same thing, hoping to adopt it. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows to you, Geng</p>
<p>Telegram 2: To Nanjing National Government Chairman Chiang Junjian: The situation is unstable in the Five Ridges, and the psychology of the masses across the country is extremely worried. I have repeatedly seen in the newspaper reports that the central government has stated that it will seek solutions by peaceful and appropriate means, while doing its best to suppress bandits, and that you have personally gone to Jiangxi Province to supervise the army. It is a sign that you know the importance of nurturing the national</p>
<p>The great enemy of the Chinese nation today is the Red bandits. Over the years, military affairs have been frequent, and the provinces have been suffering from bandits. The central government has been unable to take care of both, and those who guard the land have inevitably been perfunctory and sit back and watch, resulting in the spread of the bandits to the Yangtze River basin, forming a situation of sitting and watching. Now, if we do not deal with it with all our strength, the bandit atmosphere will spread and the nation will have no hope of survival. Therefore, those who are engrossed in political disputes and restrain the suppression of bandits, no matter what their motives, will inevitably be sinners of the party and the country. The Association has issued another telegram expressing its views, hoping to stop the war, concentrate the army, and work hard to suppress bandits. It believes that your move to Jiangxi to supervise the army is in line with the public opinion of hundreds of millions of people and should be sincerely supported. I have telegraphed to inform you, hoping that you will understand. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows to you, Geng</p>
<p>Telegram 3: To Nanjing Mr. Hu Weiyuan Zhantang, Committee Member: You resigned and retired because of political disagreements, and your integrity is admired by the whole country. It was not long before a great disturbance arose in the Five Ridges, which especially called for the heavy expectations of the veterans to be tied to the safety of the world. Although the advanced members of the party and the country have tried their best to reconcile, the discussions are turbulent, the public is full of doubts, and the war is in danger of breaking out again at any time. Shenzhou will inevitably fall into the abyss. Although you have forgotten the world and the late court, how can you bear to see the Republic of China, which has been painstakingly pioneered by the Premier for decades, fall into the abyss? On August 8 of this month, the Association convened a temporary meeting of representatives from various industries. It was agreed that the current situation is serious. At this time when emotions prevail over reason, 100 times of persuasion from other advanced members of the party and the country is not as good as one word from you to resolve disputes and relieve emergencies. We dare to sincerely ask for the people, hoping that you will uphold your usual spirit of inspiring the deaf and alerting the deaf, explain the great righteousness, and use the party discipline to make the public quarrel and attack their targets, so that the dark clouds in the sky will not be difficult to eliminate. The central government should concentrate its army and work hard to suppress bandits, and give it time to clear them out, so as to save the country's dying life in this moment of rescuing danger and setting the balance, relying on you to transfer the hanging. Waiting for prayers and prayers, I hope you will adopt it, it will be a great fortune for Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to kowtow to you, Geng</p>
<p>Telegram 4: To Guangzhou Commander-in-Chief Chen Junjian: Since the four supervisors of Deng, Lin, and Xiao issued a telegram, you have changed your officials and concentrated your forces, and the dark clouds in the sky have been stirred up as a result. People far and near have been shocked and astonished. The Jiangxi bandits are entrenched in a corner, and the siege has been going on for half a year without success. At this critical moment of bandit suppression, you are shouldering the responsibility of the border and commanding the army. Jiangnan and Guangdong East are especially closely related. If you are willing to serve the party and the country, you should abide by the duties of the border officials and work hard to plan the blocking and suppression to complete the work of suppressing bandits for the country. As for the telegram of the four supervisors, you can make suggestions in accordance with the party constitution as a party member. Moreover, the advanced members of the party are negotiating ways to solve it properly. How can you take advantage of the opportunity to hold military power and have other intentions? If you repeat the tragedy of internal war that has been repeated in the past 20 years, you will be chilled by the past. Now that treaty revision is underway and bandit suppression is extremely urgent, if you lightly start a war at this time,</p>
<p>It is to make the situation that has just been unified collapse again, and the poor bandits who are about to be surrounded will become暴曓 again. It is enough to put the country in a position of万劫不復. It is called protecting the party and the country, but in fact it will always be a sinner of the party and the country. Therefore, on August 8 of this month, when convening a temporary meeting of member representatives to discuss the current situation, it was unanimously decided to solemnly advise you that the telegram of the four supervisors should be discussed with the advanced members of the party and the country and handled properly in accordance with the party constitution. Do not deviate from the norm and be willing to be the initiator of the war. This is what is hoped for. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows to you, Geng</p>
<p>Telegram 5: To Guangzhou Minister Sun Zhesheng Junjian: Recently, since you arrived in Guangzhou, you have recited the telegrams and verified that the tasks you have undertaken are completely different. Premier passed away, and he earnestly instructed us to save China with peace and struggle. Fighting should be based on peace,</p>
<p>It is clear that the use of military force to solve political problems is not allowed by the testament. Moreover, peace can save China, which means that lightly starting a war is enough to put China in the realm of destruction. Its meaning is even more obvious. This theft of the telegram of the four supervisors has its own way to solve it according to the party constitution. Those who echo it do not hesitate to expand the situation, and 羽檄 mobilize, making the tense atmosphere spread throughout the country, which cannot but be said to have other intentions. You are an executive member in terms of party status, and a minister in terms of political status. In the past, you have participated in confidential matters and shared difficult tasks. In recent years, you have shared the difficulties and hardships of the central government's support.</p>
<p>The words of the dying easy basket are more than human can compare. Once you are entrusted with a mission, you will abandon what you have guarded and follow the same path. Moreover, you will not hesitate to transform the situation and follow in the footsteps of Beiping last year. This time, there is a solution to the problem according to the party constitution, but now you have abandoned the original topic and started a new one. The same is true of the situation. It seems that you are only afraid that the country that has just been unified will not be divided again, so as to give foreigners an excuse and opportunity. Therefore, the negotiations on revising the treaty have stopped, and bandit suppression is in full swing. Once the war starts, it will be difficult to take care of both, and it will also give the poor bandits an opportunity to狼奔豕突. The previous events of Changsha being recaptured and Nanchang being on the verge of danger will not be difficult to repeat. The spread of the bandit disaster is enough to put the country in a position of万劫不復. Considering the遗敎 of saving China with peace and struggle, you have regrets for the party and the country and</p>
<p>to the Premier. On August 8 of this month, when convening a temporary meeting of member representatives to discuss the current situation, it was unanimously decided to advise the left and right to not abandon their original mission, and to discuss the case of the telegram of the four supervisors with the advanced members of the party and the country and handle it properly in accordance with the party constitution, so as to return the dark clouds in the sky to dissipation, so as not to lose the bright and upright attitude of a politician. I hope you will adopt it. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows to you, Geng</p>
<p>Telegram 6: To the Chambers of Commerce of various provinces: Since ancient times, the telegrams issued by the four supervisors of Deng, Lin, and Xiao have expanded the disputes. The reports in the newspapers are enough to make the hope of peace and unification in the past few years shattered again. The psychology of the masses is extremely worried. The national situation is weighed up. The Northeast is in a tense situation between the two major forces. The Northwest has suffered extraordinary disasters over the years, and there are starving people everywhere. The bandit atmosphere in the Yangtze River basin is pervasive, and commerce has declined sharply. This year's silkworm cocoon harvest is only two-tenths of that of previous years, which is enough to give a great blow to the countryside. It is difficult for the people who have been hurt to recover their vitality in a hurry, how can they dare to engage in war again? On August 8 of this month, the Association convened a temporary general meeting to separately resolve: 1. A telegram was sent to the central government and the important people in Guangdong, requesting them to handle the telegram of the four supervisors in accordance with the party constitution and not resort to military force. 2. A telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang to support</p>
<p>In the midst of the Guangdong dispute, he did not advocate resolving it by force. He still focused on suppressing bandits and resolutely went to Jiangxi to supervise the army. 3. A telegram was sent to Mr. Hu Zhantang, requesting him to telegraph the Guangdong side to explain the great righteousness and use the party discipline to not deviate from the norm. 4. A telegram was sent to Commander Chen Bonan, requesting him to fulfill his duty as a local official and cooperate in blocking bandits and not to be the initiator of the war.</p>
<p>5. A telegram was sent to Minister Zhesheng, requesting him not to abandon his original mission to Guangdong and to cooperate with the advanced members of the party to properly handle this case. All these proposals are nothing more than hoping to make a proper expression of public opinion so that the situation of peace and unification will not be broken and the life of the Chinese nation will not be cut off. All the telegrams have been detailed in the next day's newspapers, and on August 8 of this month, the members and representatives of our association unanimously resolved to respectfully request you to telegraph your opinions in accordance with the above-mentioned points, so as to save the crisis with the power of public opinion. The reason why this dispute has expanded may be that the road rumors contain regionalism. Our association is particularly unable to believe this statement, because all the people named in this telegram are advanced members of the party and the country, who have deeply and long been devoted to遗敎, and are even abandoning and despising feudal ideas and tribal concepts. Moreover, the great enemy of China today is the Red bandits, and the reason why they are spreading more and more is because military affairs have been flourishing in recent years, hindering unification. If we support its separatist situation with military force again, then the bandits' tracks will be erratic and they will take advantage of loopholes, which is their usual trick. The disaster of Hailufeng in the past</p>
<p>The tragic looting of the Five Sheep City will not be difficult to repeat. If there are one or two frustrated politicians who want to use this as a pretext for instigation, the result will not be enough to save the province, but will be enough to destroy the province. This time, the war has not yet fully broken out, and the banknotes in Guangdong have been suspended for redemption, the financial situation is difficult, and commerce has been affected first. As soon as a fallacy is advocated, the advantages and disadvantages are immediately apparent. It is especially hoped that those who have the responsibility of public opinion will jointly correct the fallacies and rectify the wrongs, so as not to cause a great catastrophe by a trivial provocation. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows to you, Geng</p>
<h3 id="e123">Important External Work is in Progress to Recover the Concessions <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Notes to various countries will be issued soon</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Nanjing Incident has been completely resolved</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang talks to reporters yesterday. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting came to Shanghai to visit his son who was ill in Shanghai. He went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and returned to his residence after working for a while. He took the night train back to Beijing at 11:45 p.m. The reporter of this newspaper met with reporters at the Foreign Office yesterday morning. The reporter first asked if the Sino-Japanese Nanjing Incident had been completely resolved, how much was the compensation amount, and the payment procedures.</p>
<p>Less than one million. Foreign Minister Wang replied that the Sino-Japanese Nanjing Incident had been signed an agreement during the time of Japanese Minister Yoshizawa. This time, he discussed the amount of compensation and payment procedures with Shigemitsu, and it has now been completely resolved. The exact number cannot be remembered, but the compensation for the Nanjing Incident is about 700,000 yuan. The total number of Sino-Japanese Nanjing Incident does not exceed one million yuan. As for the payment procedures, they are paid in ten months, because the Sino-British Nanjing Incident is also paid in more than ten months.</p>
<p>Sino-Soviet Conference Regarding the latest situation of the Sino-Soviet Conference, Wang told reporters that Representative Mo had sent telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reporting everything. The eighth meeting was held on June 4, and the ninth meeting was scheduled to be held today (yesterday). The main scope is still discussing the road redemption issue, and the progress is still going smoothly.</p>
<p>Sino-British sovereignty Wang said that negotiations on Sino-British sovereignty in Beijing have been repeatedly negotiated with British Minister Lampson, and considerable results have been discussed. The British Minister took a plane back to Peiping the day before yesterday (6th) and will come south again in autumn to continue negotiations. It is expected that a stage will be reached at that time.</p>
<p>French Concession Case The reporter also asked about the recovery of the French Concession Case. Wang said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had negotiated properly with the French Minister on the recovery of the French Concession Council, and it was scheduled to be recovered in mid-July. Therefore, the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has come to an end. The Ministry of Justice is now preparing for the handover procedures and various prior arrangements. Regarding the trial of foreign merchants' cases, a special court will be set up. As for the appeal agency, either the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court will be set up or the lawsuit will be directly filed to the Suzhou Higher Court. In addition, all reorganization methods are similar to those of the Special Zone Court.</p>
<p>Recovery of Concessions Wang continued that the recovery of the concessions is the important work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year. It is now preparing to issue notes to the countries concerned, which will be issued in the shortest time. The order of priority for recovery will be determined according to the nature of the concessions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a predetermined plan for this, and I am temporarily excused from telling you.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Changes in Ambassadors and Consuls The reporter finally asked whether there would be major changes in the overseas ambassadors and consuls as rumored. Foreign Minister Wang said that there would be few changes in the overseas ambassadors and consuls in the future. He also asked about the date of</p>
<p>Envoy Qian Xinzhuan's appointment to France. He replied that Envoy Qian was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of May, but it may be slightly delayed due to business.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Chinese Merchant Steamships Strike on the Yangtze River <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Merchants Implement Monopoly Plan</p>
<p>Guest Gang Gained Petty Advantages</p>
<p>Chinese Shipping Industry Cannot Maintain</p>
<p>The future suffering is still in the hands of the merchant gang. Foreign shipping companies monopolize the shipping industry on the Yangtze River. Chinese shipping companies are seeking countermeasures, and the first step of the foreign merchants' plan has been implemented, which has caused the guest merchants to stop loading Chinese ships, resulting in Chinese merchant ships having to suspend their schedules on the Yangtze River. This matter is of great importance, and the reporter specifically investigated its situation and recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>Rampant price cuts. Cotton yarn is the most important commodity in the river transportation of the Chuan River. Ships from Yichang to Qing Dynasty mostly compete to load this commodity. There are more than 30 foreign ships of British, Japanese, American, and French nationalities on the Yichang to Chongqing route. The water fee for shipping yarn on this route was originally 16 taels per piece, then it fell to 12 taels. Last year, the foreign ships further reduced it and charged 8 taels per piece. According to this number, it is only enough for the shipping cost. This year, foreign merchants are seeking to obtain priority for cargo transportation on the Chuan River and are trying their best to break the Chinese shipping companies' alliance. Therefore, starting from June 1, the water fee for cotton yarn was drastically reduced from 8 taels per piece to 4 taels, and in fact, another tael was given away, and only 3 taels were actually collected. Since this drastic drop in freight rates occurred, foreign ships are prepared to sacrifice and have agreed on three steps. When each Chinese ship follows the price reduction and also charges 4 taels, they will reduce it again and charge 2 taels. The last step is to charge only one tael of water fee per piece of cotton yarn to break the new record of price cuts on the Chuan River and make Chinese ships unable to support themselves.</p>
<p>Tempting the Merchant Gang After the price cuts, foreign ships immediately contacted the guests in Yichang and Chongqing. Those who carry foreign ships will enjoy the preferential benefits of the shortest water fee in the third step. Many short-sighted merchant gangs cannot resist the cheap price and compete to load goods on foreign ships with low freight rates. Those who have signed transportation contracts with Chinese ships also demanded in this price-cutting trend that Chinese ships also reduce their fees according to the freight rates of foreign ships, otherwise they would stop loading.</p>
<p>Fee increase negotiations. If the eight companies such as the Sanyou, Beiyu, Chongqingjiang, China Merchants, Qingping, and Chuanjiang, etc., charge 3 taels less per piece of cotton yarn between Yichang and Chongqing, it is not enough for the coal burning cost, and the wages of the workers and the ship's hardware are completely lost. Such a loss is difficult to maintain. Moreover, if the cargo is in short supply in Sichuan and the price is cut, the loss will be even greater. The Chinese shipping companies put forward negotiations, requesting the merchant gangs to appropriately add to the freight, stating the unavoidable difficulties and further stating that the rampant price cuts of foreign ships are not advisable. Repeated negotiations have yielded no results.</p>
<p>Strike and suspension of traffic. The eight Chinese shipping companies have requested two items from the merchant gangs in Yichang and Chongqing: (1) The water fee should be appropriately increased so that the Chinese ships on the Chuan River can maintain their navigation under the situation of reduced losses, so as to avoid the Jiangshang navigation rights falling entirely into the hands of foreigners, and one day the Chinese merchants will suffer the pain of being slaughtered by them. (2) Maintain the livelihood of the Yichang workers after the Shanghai-Chongqing direct shipping line is opened. The Chinese shipping companies are willing to take care of both sides. In the future, if the Shanghai-Chongqing direct shipping line is operated, two-thirds of the cabin space should be reserved each time to load Yichang goods so that the Yichang small workers can have work and maintain their lives. However, this condition has not been sympathetic to the merchant gangs in Sichuan, and the Sichuan merchants are even more attracted by the price cuts of foreign merchants. Because they did not agree to reduce the fees, they have stopped loading Chinese ships. Yesterday, the various shipping companies in this city received an urgent telegram from Yichang, saying that in the past few weeks, the guest houses have stopped loading Chinese ships, and the Chinese merchant ships on the Chuan River have no business to do. They have to temporarily suspend the traffic and stop the shipping and discuss the rescue plan.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Du Chongyuan's Speech: Go to the Northeast <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The other day, Mr. Du Chongyuan, manager of the Liaoning Zhaoxin Kiln Industry Company and former representative of the Northeast at the National Assembly, gave a speech at the Shanghai YMCA. The title of his speech was "Go to the Northeast." Mr. Du is currently the chairman of the Liaoning City Chamber of Commerce. He came from a very poor background, and when he grew up, seeing the increasingly aggressive Japanese invasion of the Northeast, he volunteered with the determination to save the country through industry. He went to Japan to study at the Tokyo Higher Industrial School (now Tokyo Institute of Technology), majoring in kiln industry for four years. After completing his studies in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, he returned to China. Initially, he obtained the support of many students who had studied in Japan and jointly invested 6,000 yuan in national currency to organize the Zhaoxin Industrial Company, hoping to save the Northeast provinces from the dumping of Japanese porcelain. After nine years, the achievements</p>
<p>are already quite impressive. The capital has jumped from 6,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan. The factory's manufacturing facilities are all managed using scientific methods, and they are expanding as much as possible within their capacity. Today, the annual production of new-style porcelain bowls reaches 6 million, which is enough to stop the leakage of Japanese goods. Mr. Du is determined to save the country through industry, saying that what the government does not have time to do should be done by the people themselves with the idea of saving the country. He will</p>
<p>go to Hangzhou in the next few days, and then to the ports of Peiping, Tianjin, Harbin, and Jehol to awaken domestic capitalists and ambitious young people to go to the Northeast to develop the natural resources of the Northeast. Mr. Du's intention is actually based on the increasingly aggressive Japanese invasion of the Northeast. If the Chinese people do not save themselves, the resources of the Northeast will fall into the hands of the Japanese. His persuasion in the major ports of the Southeast is aimed at saving the country. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Du's speech at the YMCA on going to the Northeast:</p>
<p>The so-called Northeast refers to the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Recently, some have included Jehol in the term, but foreigners often refer to the Northeast as Manchuria, or North and South Manchuria. After the Russo-Japanese War, the two powers divided the spoils, and the area south of Changchun along the South Manchurian Railway was called South Manchuria, belonging to Japan. The area north of Changchun along the Chinese Eastern Railway was called North Manchuria, belonging to Russia, to distinguish their spheres of influence. This is the origin of the general term North and South Manchuria, which the Japanese in particular relish, and its intention is the same as the past calling China "Shina," containing the same degree of contempt. They also want to use this to show that the Northeast is not inherent to China and at the same time do not recognize the Northeast as an administrative region of China. Their intentions are extremely dangerous. The Northeast covers an area of 3,506,000 square miles, almost equal to the total area of Germany and France, and three times the size of Japan. The population is only 30 million, with an average of eight people per square mile in Heilongjiang and 33 people per square mile in Jilin. The average for the three provinces (Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang) is only 28 people per square kilometer, which is far from the more than 142 people per square kilometer in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong. Although the climate of the three provinces is somewhat different from that of Beijing and Shanghai, it is definitely not as cold as people in the south generally say and imagine.</p>
<p>The Japanese say that the climate is not to be feared, and travelers also praise that the winters are not severely cold and the summers are not extremely hot, so the products are extremely abundant and suitable for farming and grazing. Agricultural products found in southern China, such as soybeans, sorghum, wheat, barley, dry grains, rice, corn, and white sesame, are all available in the Northeast. China's various seaports have a trade deficit, but only the Northeast has a trade surplus every year. The resources of the Northeast are not only the best in our country, but also among the best in the world. Taking the Northeast's mineral resources as an example, both metallic and non-metallic minerals are abundant, with high quality and beauty. The placer gold and gold nuggets in Heilongjiang are famous in the world and are coveted by the Russians. There are also mines producing iron, copper, lead, and other minerals, especially coal, with a very rich production volume of about 200 billion tons. The Fushun coal mine alone has more than 100 billion tons, which is a pity that the Japanese have been plundering and operating it, which is truly heartbreaking. If Japan's own coal production lasts for another 30 years, there will be no coal to meet its needs. Now that it has seized the Fushun coal mine, in addition to meeting its own needs, it also has a surplus to transport to Shanghai and other places. As for the forests of Jilin, which have been little cut down for thousands of years, the tall trees stretch across the mountains. Northerners have always called them a "sea of trees." The Japanese have long coveted the treasures of the Northeast in order to protect their own forests. The vast wilderness of Jilin and Heilongjiang is suitable for grazing. The number of livestock such as cattle, horses, sheep, mules, and camels is particularly large compared to those produced in other places, with an annual</p>
<p>birth rate of more than 15 million heads. The resources of the Northeast are so amazing just as mentioned above.</p>
<p>But it is only a rough and inadequate description, just to make southerners aware of the wealth and breadth of the Northeast. Last year, the sales of soybeans were sluggish and could not bear hoarding, and some people thought it was the end. But now the Japanese regard the Northeast as a major base for economic aggression. The South Manchuria Railway Company has a total investment of 600 million yuan in the Northeast provinces, with an annual business income of more than 240 million Japanese yen. It also researches and investigates various issues in the three provinces, writing special books with charts and explanations, never neglecting anything day and night. The Chinese people should understand the depth of their intentions. Mr. Tiecheng said, "If you don't go to the Northeast, you won't know the greatness of the Northeast; if you don't go to the Northeast, you won't know the crisis of the Northeast." Ambitious young people, entrepreneurs, and wealthy merchants in the country should immediately (go to the Northeast) conduct research and investigation, and develop it themselves. Mr. Ma Xiangbo said, "If you want to save China, first save the Northeast; if you want to save the Northeast, first govern the Northeast."</p>
<p>I would like to sincerely appeal to everyone present to quickly go to the Northeast. Now the government and people of the Northeast are working together to build the country, and transportation is becoming increasingly convenient. The railway network of the three provinces is now under construction. However, the Northeast is limited in talent, and it is hoped that talented people from all over the country will go to develop it and jointly save the Northeast. This is what the people of the Northeast desire most. Do not let the treasures given by Heaven be abandoned in the hands of foreigners and remain in a state of hesitation.</p>
<p>How can the Chinese people not wake up and embark on the path of self-salvation?</p>

<h3 id="e134">Pharmaceutical Industry Asks to Stop Shop Assistants from Organizing Unions <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Central Committee. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Central Committee yesterday, stating that it was submitting a report. On the 5th of this month, it received a letter from the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association stating that the Chinese medicine industry in Shanghai has never had a trade union. Since the spring of the 16th year of the Republic of China, when the National Revolutionary Army settled in Southeast China, Communist Party members Zhou Xiang, Tao Wenbo, etc. were ordered by the Soviet Union to instigate shop assistants in the Shanghai medicine industry to organize a medicine and medicinal slice union with the goal of overthrowing capitalists. Therefore, immediately after its establishment, it gathered a crowd to destroy the Yi Hanchun Pharmacy in Xiaodongmen as a demonstration. Fortunately, the central government held a party purge and dissolved the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and the medicine and medicinal slice union was also sealed off. When the Shanghai Trade Union Unification Committee was established, Tao Wenbo and others took the opportunity to call on medicine shop assistants to organize a medicine business union within the concession and continued to use their communist methods. They also destroyed the Liu Shouquan Pharmacy in Ximen and instructed the medicine masses to repeatedly strike to oppress the capitalists. The harm was unprecedented. Fortunately, the Shanghai Party and government organs were wise and decisive and ordered the medicine business union to be dissolved and reorganized into a medicine staff union. The communist atmosphere cleared, and their momentum was slightly frustrated. However, the Shanghai medicine shop assistants have been infected by the Communist Party for a long time, and their fierceness has increased. Last autumn, the industry staff union insisted on a strike for more than 40 days to force the capitalists to insert staff, and the losses of the city's medicine industry reached hundreds of thousands of gold. The case was serious and shocked the central government. It was not because the communist scourge had been severe for several years. This year, the central government's new trade union laws were promulgated and implemented, and the organization of staff unions is not applicable to the period of political tutelage. Shop assistants should join the industry and commerce trade association. The legislation is perfect, and the whole country is benefiting. The Shanghai medicine industry has suffered from disasters and is fortunate to bathe in the new law. The most fortunate thing is that the Central First 31st Standing Committee decided on the separate organization methods of medical and pharmaceutical groups, stipulating that medicine merchants and medicine staff should organize medicine trade associations in accordance with the industry and commerce trade association law, but workers in pharmaceutical factories may organize trade unions in accordance with the trade union law. The Shanghai medicine shops do not have pharmaceutical factories, so all shop assistants should join the association to be the right way. Unexpectedly, things are not so good. Now, the Shanghai medicine shop assistants have re-established a medicine trade union. At first, I did not know what basis it was based on. After several inquiries, I learned that the only reason for the shop assistants to organize the trade union was that the medicine shop assistants are all skilled workers and indirectly serve the shop, so they can organize a trade union, etc. According to the case, medicine shop assistants should learn all the internal and external affairs of the shop when they first enter the shop. This is a common sense that must be possessed for learning a profession. Not only the medicine industry is like this, but also the habits of other ordinary businesses are almost all like this. After the apprenticeship is over, the positions are assigned to the internal or external affairs according to their nature and ability. It is like the students of primary and secondary schools, who must take all the courses of the whole school. The situation is the same. If the medicine shop assistants have the common sense of this profession, they are said to have skills, then farmers who cultivate fields, merchants who buy and sell, soldiers who know the way of marching, and scholars who have the way of learning can all be said to have skills. Is there such a reason? The so-called indirect service is referred to the workers in the manufacturing factory who manufacture the goods and then have a distribution office set up by the factory to distribute them. The Shanghai medicine shops do not have pharmaceutical factories, and the shop assistants who serve in the shop on weekdays directly receive the customers, so how can they be indirectly serving? Now, a group of long-term unemployed medicine loafers want to maintain their personal lives and do not care about fabricating words and designing to forcibly organize trade unions, which involves destroying the spirit of national legislation and betraying the decision of the Central Committee. The association does not dare to be silent and especially presents the above warnings and humbly asks to forward them to the Central Committee to quickly dissolve the Shanghai Medicine Trade Union in accordance with the law and order the medicine shop assistants to join the association to comply with the law and eliminate disputes. It is a great benefit, etc. It was checked that the shop assistants illegally formed a trade union. The association requested the Ministry to handle it in accordance with the law on March 25th based on the request of the National Medicine Industry and 23 other trade associations. On April 16th, the Ministry issued an instruction No. 14597, stating that it is requested to prohibit the formation of another trade union in addition to participating in the trade association. According to the association's request, the Ministry has ordered the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee's Public Training Committee to submit a detailed review for verification. It has not been reported yet. In addition to copying the original submission and ordering the committee to review the case together for verification, it is also notified to the association. Afterwards, how the verification is done has not been approved. However, the association received an instruction from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in another case stating that the Ministry of Industry has approved the Central Secretariat's letter sending the Shanghai Municipal Revised Trade Union Organization Plan, which has been approved by the Standing Committee and handled according to the plan. It is said that how the organization plan is drafted, how the workers are classified, all of this is related to the shop assistants joining the trade association. It is presumed that there is no conflict with the organization of the trade association without clear instructions. According to the association's strong statement of the abuses of the lack of standards for skilled workers, the association has added a detailed assessment and does not think it is unreasonable. All businesses have their business application knowledge and ability. Those who do not have this knowledge and ability are outsiders and not shop assistants. If those who have this knowledge and ability are skilled workers, then the name of shop assistants has long been nowhere to return. Why must there be a redundant provision in the same trade association law? The matter concerns national legislation and should not be suspected. It is reasonable to present the facts to the Ministry for review and humbly ask for the handling of the above two presentations (March 25th) in accordance with the law. It is a public convenience.</p>

(2) Silk experts Zhou Junmei, Zheng Qunjiang, and Ge Jingzhong hope to use this opportunity to improve the long-strand silk industry machinery as a fundamental solution, so that it can compete with foreign silk in the future. They also proposed to use 1.5 million yuan of the 2 million yuan of the necessary improvement public bonds for improving machinery and 500,000 yuan for training labor, so that machinery and labor can be advanced together. (3) The silk industry's Chu, Shen, and Qian still advocate first treating the symptoms to extend the life of the silk industry, and then engaging in improving the machine strictly to cultivate results.

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall National Goods Market was opened yesterday. On the second morning of the opening, the number of people was slightly reduced due to the rain. After the weather cleared in the afternoon, customers continued to flock to the market. The market was crowded, and the situation was still not weakened. It is reported that the total turnover of the entire market reached more than 6,000 yuan. The national goods of each factory are still relatively complete, but due to the too short opening time, some daily necessities such as parasols, handkerchiefs, and wide elastic bands are still out of stock, so customers have no way to purchase them. It is now heard that the market is actively trying to find ways to perfect the unprepared products. It is also understood that the association, in view of the development of the market's business and the large number of registered factory numbers, intends to add a layer to the original three-story exhibition hall to facilitate the accommodation as much as possible. In addition, it is also planned to add agency departments, trust departments, gift voucher departments, wholesale departments, and other plans to expand.</p>

<p>And guarantee that there will be no more illegal detentions. The Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating that according to the letter of Mr. Qiao Ru, today's newspaper carries a news item about the members of the Detective Police Protection Association detaining people. After reading it, I was both suspicious and fearful. I don't know who gave the Police Protection Association the power to detain people. A mere Portuguese Westerner claiming to be the director of the Police Protection Association can issue detention warrants and arbitrarily detain people, which is absurd. According to the Court Agreement, except for current offenders, if the police want to detain a criminal, they must first ask the court to issue a detention warrant before they can detain the person. Now, after reviewing the self-proclaimed director of the Police Protection Association's confession in court, it is as if whoever needs to be detained must be issued a detention warrant by me. The Police Protection Association has admitted that it has the power to detain people at any time, then the residents in the concession will be illegally detained at any time in the future. I don't know what the Municipal Council authorities mean by tolerating the existence of this illegal organization and allowing it to carry out illegal activities. The Municipal Council should of course be held responsible for its negligence. The taxpayers pay huge amounts of donations every year, but these guys are rampant. How will the Municipal Council explain itself? Your association is a representative organization of taxpayers. I am submitting this news item and asking you to forward it to the Municipal Council, urging it to quickly report to the competent consulate to seal up the Police Protection Association and punish the person in charge of the association with the deserved punishment, and guarantee that there will be no more illegal incidents of this kind in the future, etc. A newspaper clipping is also attached. After checking that this kind of illegal organization should have been sealed up by your bureau long ago to reassure the people, I am submitting the newspaper clipping and asking you to check and act in accordance with the purpose of the request in the letter. Yours sincerely, the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Concentrating the Financial Power of Twenty Companies</p>
<p>Undertaking Large-Scale Insurance from All Sectors</p>

State-owned assets and state-run enterprises have been insured by Chinese-owned companies, following the resolution of the previous Industry and Commerce Conference, which was communicated to all relevant authorities by the Yuan and the Ministry. We are aware that our limited resources may not be sufficient to handle such large undertakings, and we may make mistakes due to inexperience. Therefore, we have formed a joint reinsurance group composed of all Chinese-owned member companies of this association, to concentrate our resources and enhance our capacity to accept large-scale insurance from all sectors. We have printed several thousand copies of this announcement and would like to request your esteemed chamber to write a letter of introduction to various industries. Once printed, this association will distribute them separately, together with the announcement. We are deeply grateful."</p>

To build up greater financial strength, Chinese-owned insurance companies have formed a joint reinsurance group, concentrating the resources of twenty companies to undertake large-scale insurance from all sectors, providing security for policyholders and enhancing the reputation of Chinese merchants. All industries and citizens should learn from past mistakes and change course, purchasing insurance from Chinese-owned companies to recover lost profits over the years and avoid the dangers of legal constraints and disputes over compensation.

<h3 id="e145">Two Assassinations Occur Near Shanghai West Zhongshan Road Overnight <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Although Corpses Found in Two Locations</p>
<p>Investigation Suggests Same Incident</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 1:00 AM, a major case occurred near Xujiazhai on the newly developed Zhongshan Road in Caojiadu, Shanghai West. Gunmen shot and killed two people. Although the bodies were found in two different locations, the investigation suggests that it was the same incident. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dog Barking Shatters Sweet Dreams - Farmer Hong Renzheng, a 44-year-old native of Tiantai, Zhejiang, lives at No. 26 Xujiazhai, near Zhongshan Road, Zhabei. He is a poor farmer with a wife, Chen, 36, and two young children. At around 1:00 AM yesterday, the entire family was fast asleep when they suddenly heard dogs barking loudly in the village. Hong was awakened from his dream, and the barking became louder and closer. Fearing that thieves were breaking in, Hong immediately got up and opened the door to investigate. As soon as he reached the door, four or five bandits suddenly emerged from the darkness, menacingly approaching him. At the same time, they drew their guns and threatened Hong.</p>
<p>Shouting "Thief" Leads to Gunfire - When Hong saw this, he knew he had encountered bandits. Although the bandits threatened him with their guns, Hong refused to be intimidated and shouted "Thief!" However, it was late at night, and the area was remote, so no one came to his aid. Seeing that the situation was not in their favor, the bandits shot at Hong several times. Hong's wife, Chen, initially saw her husband go out and then heard him shouting "Thief!" followed by several gunshots. She trembled in fear and dared not go out to investigate. When her husband did not return for a long time, she risked going outside, only to find Hong fatally wounded, lying in a pool of blood. The assailants had vanished without a trace. Overwhelmed with grief, she urgently called out to her neighbors and reported the incident to the Sixth District Police Station.</p>
<p>District Chief Investigates - Upon receiving the report, District Chief Ren, realizing the seriousness of the case, immediately led Inspector Xu, Detective Team Leader Liu Shaoqing, and other detectives to the scene. They found that Hong Renzheng's house had been ransacked and was very poor. The deceased had been shot in the right chest and left wrist, with blood flowing freely. One of the supporting posts of the clothing rack outside the house had been pulled out and discarded on the ground. A stone slab used to cover a ditch was also found in the yard, which was discovered to have been moved from a ditch about half a li from the house.</p>
<p>Another Body Discovered - While investigating, District Chief Ren and others came across another body about half a li from the house, near a small creek behind No. 23 Zhongshan Road. The body was of an unknown man, approximately thirty years old. Upon closer inspection, they found that the body was wearing old, torn blue cotton pants and had been shot in the left chest, with blood and flesh mangled. It was clear that he had also been shot. A small hat was found lying on the grass about ten feet from the body. Following the trail of blood on the road, they found that it led from Xujiazhai. Neighbors of Hong's house reported that they heard dogs barking loudly around midnight, and then again around 1:00 AM. Shortly after, they heard someone shouting "Thief!" followed by four or five gunshots. Knowing that it was gunfire, they did not dare to go out to investigate. Five six-inch pistol casings were collected from inside and outside Hong's house as evidence.</p>
<p>Speculation About the Two Murders - Based on the above information, it is speculated that the unknown man was an accomplice of the murderers. It is possible that the victim was killed in front of the Xu house due to some grudge, and the perpetrators moved the slab from a distant ditch to the site, intending to sink the body in the creek (since the body was missing its belt.) They were preparing to move the body to the creek but were interrupted by the dogs’ loud barking, preventing them from carrying out their plan. This could explain why the other victim was killed earlier around midnight, and the body was not moved. Later, around 1:00 AM, when Hong Renzheng heard the dogs barking and went outside to shout, he was shot. Seeing that no one was coming out, the perpetrators used the wooden post from the clothing rack as a lever to carry the unidentified body to the creek, making it difficult to trace. Otherwise, if they were robbing the Hong's house, they wouldn’t have killed them since there wasn’t much of value there. In any case, the truth remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Court Sends Officials to Investigate - After conducting the initial investigation, District Chief Ren ordered Detective Team Leader Liu Shaoqing to urgently investigate the perpetrators. He also instructed Wang Zhangkun, the head of the 11th Tu, and Zhang Zitang, the head of the 10th Tu, to report to the local court. Around 3:20 PM, the court dispatched Prosecutor Yang Wenjun and Clerk Mao Zhenxin, along with a coroner, to the scene to conduct an investigation.</p>
<p>They confirmed that both men had been fatally shot before their deaths. The body of Hong Renzheng was claimed by his wife, Chen, for burial. The body of the unknown man was reported to the local authorities for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Suicide of Jida Staff Member Zhu Peigen <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Once Said Suicide is Best Done by Hanging</p>
<p>The Ominous Remarks Became Reality</p>
<p>Zhu Peigen, a staff member of the Nanyang Cultural Department of Jida University, committed suicide in his dormitory yesterday morning. The faculty and students of the entire university were shocked by the news. The deceased was 40 years old, a native of Jiading, known for his calligraphy. He was diligent and disciplined in his work. The reason for his suicide is unknown.</p>
<p>Hanging by the Window - Zhu Peigen had been serving as a staff member and assistant in the Nanyang Cultural Department of Jida University for three years. He was recommended to the school by the China Vocational Education Society. He was known for his punctuality and had good relationships with his colleagues. He lived in dormitory number 19, sharing a room with Mr. Yao. The previous night, Mr. Yao went to Shanghai, leaving Zhu alone in the room. Yesterday morning, Zhu had not gotten up for a long time. The tea boy peeked through the window and saw Zhu hanging by a rope from the window.</p>
<p>Cause of Death Unknown - The deceased was a man of few words, rarely smiling or interacting with others. His family and friends searched his room but found no suicide note. There had been no significant changes in his behavior recently. However, it was said that after a teacher named Zhao from the affiliated elementary school committed suicide due to a broken heart, Zhu had discussed it with others, saying that hanging was the best way to commit suicide. Who knew that his remarks would become an ominous prediction? Zhu's elderly mother lives in Jiading. He is survived by four children and two brothers who are self-sufficient. Zhu earned about 60 yuan a month at the school, which was enough to support himself. His body was placed in a coffin last night and will be transported back to his hometown today.</p>

<p>Seeking Recovery of Over One Million</p>
<p>No Defendant Appeared in Court</p>
<p>The Day &amp; Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings programs both belonged to the Gongfa Company. Since the death of the founder, Huang Chujiu, both programs have been suspended for liquidation for almost half a year, and depositors have not received any benefits. Now, two groups of depositors, totaling 3,386 people, have unanimously appointed Jing Xiren as their litigation representative and have engaged lawyers Wu Jingxiong, Chen Tingrui, and Jiang Yiping, who are responsible for handling legal matters for creditors of the Municipal Government, to file a lawsuit against Huang Chujiu's sons, Huang Xianzong and Huang Xianyao, and all shareholders and directors of the Gongfa Company in the Special District Court. The total amount sought is approximately 1.1 million yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren opened the Ninth Court to summon the defendants. However, due to the large number of defendants and the unknown addresses of many of them, the court was unable to serve summonses. As a result, no defendants appeared in court, nor did any lawyers represent them. Therefore, the hearing could not proceed. Judge Zhou instructed the summons servers to bring the shareholders and directors to court and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Nine Robbers Arrested in Wuxi</p>
<p>One Accomplice Captured in Shanghai</p>
<p>On the night of last month the 6th, at 10:00 PM, the home of Zhu Baoquan, a resident of Yangjiawei, Zhuxiang, outside the North Gate of Wuxi County, was broken into by over a dozen armed robbers. They first threw two bombs, which exploded with a loud bang but fortunately did not injure anyone. They then began to ransack the house, finding only clothing and jewelry worth over two thousand yuan. Dissatisfied, they tied up Zhu's wife and hung her upside down over a stack of dry firewood, burning her to force her to reveal the location of her valuables. She said she had no hidden treasures and could not fabricate anything, so she was left at the mercy of the robbers. Later, the robbers saw that both her legs were burned, but she remained silent, figuring there were no hidden valuables. They then left with their loot. Zhu Baoquan was doing business in Shanghai at the time and was spared. Recently, the Public Security Bureau of Wuxi County arrested nine robbers. According to their confessions, their accomplice, Wei Jicheng (also known as Ji Cheng and Xiaogen), had fled to the Dahua Hotel on Fuzhou Road in Shanghai.</p>

<p>With many years of clinical experience, I know that old and new gonorrhea can not be cured by merely flushing the urethra with medication or intravenous injections. It is necessary to examine the location of the gonococcal infection and then use fine instruments and new surgical methods to thoroughly eliminate the parasitic bacteria with special drugs to achieve rapid results and prevent recurrence. Chronic gonorrhea often spreads to the posterior urethra, prostate, seminal vesicles, or bladder, each with different characteristics. The severity of the condition also depends on this. Therefore, if you want a radical and rapid cure, new treatment methods are essential. Located at 1672 North Sichuan Road, north of the General Post Office. Consultation fee: 1.20 yuan.</p>

<p>Now is the time when summer decrees and diseases flourish. Even a slight mishap can lead to illness. People fear disease more than any ferocious beast. This is especially true for those who are living alone in Shanghai. Once they fall ill, finding a doctor is difficult, and taking medicine is even more inconvenient. Lying in bed with an illness, one must ask others to help prepare and decoct the medicine. However, those who help often lack experience in decocting medicine, resulting in a heavy price with little effect. I am one of those living in Shanghai who has fallen ill and knows the difficulties involved. A few days ago, I came to Shanghai and stayed at the New World Hotel. I fell ill because I was unable to find the friend I was trying to visit. Although I had a tea boy serving me in Shanghai, it was not as attentive as my parents or wife. I wanted to prescribe and decoct the medicine myself, but I had concerns. Although I took several doses of medicine, they were not effective. At this time, I was suffering from the inconvenience of taking and decocting medicine. Fortunately, I read an advertisement for Wang Yuandao Chinese Medicine Store in the newspaper. The store had departments for receiving prescriptions, delivering medicine, and decocting medicine for customers. I was overjoyed to learn of this convenience. I immediately called the store to pick up the prescription. Soon, a messenger in yellow arrived by scooter. I handed him the prescription and entrusted him with the decoction. After a while, the messenger returned with two thermos bottles, one containing the first decoction and the other containing the second decoction. Another box contained the squeezed medicine residue. He asked me to check each item to ensure it matched the medicine listed on the prescription. Although I had no in-depth experience in identifying medicines, I knew a thing or two. The medicine was authentic, and the decoction was strong and thick. I was able to take the medicine with peace of mind. After several days, my illness vanished. I believe that this service provided by the store is of great benefit to patients. I hope that those who sympathize with my situation will try it. The store is located at the Jiaqiao in the French Concession. The telephone number is 1315. Room number 12. The team leader of the police squad, Dai Shouquan, came to Shen to apply to the Lao Zha police station on the day before yesterday. If a detective named Huang Yinjie is sent secretly to take Xue and bring him to the Special Zone Local court, it will be handled by Judge Xu in court.</p>
<h3 id="e151">A Woman Married Twice <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Ru Longsheng Loses Both Money and People</p>
<p>Zhang Hengyao Commits Fraud</p>
<p>Ru Longsheng, 27 years old, a native of Suzhou, currently lives at No. 409 Fujian Road and works at Dr. Cai's clinic. Although his income is not high, he lives frugally and has saved some money. Last year, his mother saw that he was getting older and wanted to find him a wife.</p>
<p>She spoke to Zhu Bingquan, the owner of Zhutai Clothing Store at No. 1911 Hele Lane, Xin Zha Road, about this matter. Zhu had a friend named Wu Dayi, who knew Zhang Hengyao, a native of Zhenjiang, who said he had a daughter who was of marriageable age. Zhu and Wu acted as matchmakers and arranged the marriage. However, after living together for several months, the Zhenjiang Court informed the Shanghai Special District Court that his wife was already married. The court summoned his wife, and Ru Longsheng lost both his money and his wife. He filed a complaint with the Special District Court, requesting that the defendants be punished and seeking incidental civil compensation. His complaint stated that the defendants falsely presented a married woman as a virgin and fraudulently married her to him. Zhang Hengyao, Wu Dayi, and Zhu Bingquan claimed in April of last year that Zhang Hengyao's daughter was 22 years old and still unmarried. They acted as matchmakers and demanded a betrothal gift of 186 yuan, as well as clothes and jewelry. The wedding was held at the Tongyu Hotel on May 26. After the marriage, it was discovered that she was not a virgin. To protect his reputation, he did not make an issue of it. However, on November 4, the court police arrested his wife and informed him that she was already married to a man named Xu and was not named Zhang but Xiao. Zhang Hengyao was her stepfather. Her aunt had accused her of bigamy in the Zhenjiang Court, so the case was brought to trial. Only then did he realize he had been deceived. He engaged a lawyer to negotiate with them, but the defendants refused to admit the truth. Therefore, they are undoubtedly guilty of fraud and should be punished. He is requesting compensation for 449 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff testified as described above and requested compensation for 449 yuan. When questioned, Zhu Bingquan admitted to being a matchmaker but claimed that he did not know she was married and did not handle the betrothal gifts. He said he gave it all to the female matchmaker, Wu Dayi. Wu Dayi testified that he also gave all the betrothal gifts to Zhang Hengyao and did not take any money. Zhang Hengyao also testified that he married his stepdaughter to Ru Longsheng but stated that he had declared that the girl was remarrying because she had disagreements with her family. He only received 120 yuan in betrothal gifts. Judge Wu reviewed the testimony and announced in court that Zhang Hengyao was guilty of fraud and sentenced to two years imprisonment. This sentence will be combined with the three-and-a-half-year sentence for inciting bigamy that was confirmed by the Zhenjiang Court, resulting in a total sentence of three years and six months. Zhu Bingquan and Wu Dayi were found not guilty. The civil compensation portion of the case was transferred to the Civil Court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e152">An Unlikely Fortune for a Water Carrier <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver Ornaments Discovered by the Riverbank</p>
<p>Zhang Asan, a water carrier from a tofu shop in the Pingyuan Alley, Doushi Road, Wusong, aged thirty-eight, was carrying water buckets around 3 PM yesterday afternoon. He was at the Guangbian area in front of the Tongxing Wharf on the outer side of the road, drawing water. Unintentionally, his foot touched something in the muddy bottom of the water. He felt something pulling at him and was quite curious. So, he stopped at a nearby ferry and borrowed a bamboo pole to scoop the object from the water. Unexpectedly, upon closer inspection, the item retrieved turned out to be gold and silver bracelets, chains, and other ornaments, totaling about seventeen or eighteen pieces linked together in a large string. However, because these bracelets and chains had been submerged in water for a long time, their color was not very bright. Zhang initially suspected they were copper and not valuable. Later, after being identified by bystanders, he realized they were all genuine articles estimated to be worth three to four hundred gold coins. Zhang was overjoyed. He gave one gold and one silver bracelet to the people on the ferry as a reward for borrowing the pole. He took the rest home, causing a great stir and becoming a local legend.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Conclusion of the Case of the Chung Ngoi Pharmacy Confiscating a Large Quantity of Poisonous Substances <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Verdict Is Scheduled to Be Announced Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Chung Ngoi Pharmacy on Guangdong Road was found by the Public Concession Police to be selling illegal items. They petitioned the Special District Court for a search warrant, and detectives were dispatched to the pharmacy. They confiscated 434 taels, 3 maces, and 4 fen of morphine; 13 taels of aconite; 473 taels of opium; 816 taels of "ka fen" (likely a type of medicinal powder); 304 taels of red pill material; 78 and a half taels of red pill fragrance; over 160 red pills; three cans of opium paste; two opium pipes; one fountain pen-style poisonous gas pistol; five bullets; over two thousand yuan in silver dollars, gold pounds, and banknotes; one hundred and thirty yuan in Tianjin banknotes; sixty yuan in counterfeit banknotes; two hundred and fifty-six counterfeit double dime coins. They also detained manager Su Renjie, accountant Wang Ruilai, Qiao Zihang, the owner of Wanfeng Lumber in Pudong, Zhu Gao (also known as Qu Gao), a clerk at the Meifeng Bank, Sun Chunsheng, a broker at the Yarn Exchange, and ten other employees, including Qian Genmei, Qiu Ada, Cao Chengen, Zhang Shiqi, and Du Shutian. It was also discovered that Qiao Zihang had also sold morphine in 1922 and was punished with six months of imprisonment, handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation. Judge Xu Jiashi, the presiding judge of the criminal division, personally inspected the pharmacy. The court session resumed yesterday morning. The police lawyer stated that Huang Yicai, the manager of the Meifeng Bank, whom the court intended to summon as a witness, had already been questioned. Huang Yicai testified that the defendant, Zhu Gao, was indeed a clerk in his bank and had been there for four years. He was usually quite cautious. His guarantor was the Chung Ngoi Pharmacy. He also lived in the pharmacy because his relatives worked there. When asked by the court if he was a shareholder of the pharmacy, he said he had heard He Ruiren say so, but he could not confirm it. Wang Ruilai testified that he was the external accountant and that the morphine matter was handled by the internal accountant and he did not interfere or know about it. Su Renjie testified that he was a junior employee of the Chung Ngoi Pharmacy and not the manager, and he knew nothing about the morphine. The defendant's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, then presented a letter from the Qingdong District Party Headquarters proving that Qiao Zihang was indeed the legitimate owner of a lumber business in Pudong and had a proper reputation. He then submitted it to the court for examination. The court asked the defendant, Shen Chunsheng, if he was a broker at the Yarn Exchange, but the court's inquiry stated that the exchange had no broker named Shen Chunsheng. Shen replied that he handled cash transactions. Judge Xu then ordered Shen to write numbers to compare his handwriting with the writing in the Chung Ngoi Pharmacy's books. After Shen finished writing, the police lawyer and the defendant's lawyer began to debate at length. Judge Xu then announced that the debate in the case was concluded and that the verdict would be announced tomorrow (Wednesday) morning.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Japanese Residents Resisting Housing Donation <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau Will Strictly Enforce the Collection of Housing Donation, Similar to the Collection of Police Donation by the Concession Public Works Department</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who enjoys the benefits of residence in the urban area, regardless of their nationality, should pay the housing donation and should not harbor any hopes of exemption. In recent years, the Municipal Finance Bureau has noted that there are many foreign-owned factories and warehouses in the Pudong area. It has repeatedly negotiated with various foreign chambers of commerce in Shanghai to collect the factory and warehouse housing donation. Merchants from Britain, the United States, France, and other countries understand that paying this housing donation is an obligation they should fulfill. They have first recognized the obligation to pay, and this year's housing donation has already been paid in full. However, Japanese residents are still delaying payment and Japanese households residing in the Zhabei area have not complied with the regulations to pay the housing donation. It is also heard that the Finance Bureau has decided to strictly urge payment. On one hand, it has sent a letter to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce to instruct Japanese merchants to clear the factory and warehouse housing donation in the Pudong area within the shortest possible time, with a deadline of one month. On the other hand, it has issued a notice to be distributed to Japanese households in Zhabei, ordering them to comply with the regulations and pay the housing donation within one month. If they still fail to comply, they will only have to implement the regulations for the collection of housing donation and cut off the electricity permanently. Furthermore, it was found that the Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun (Japanese newspaper) published a news article on the sixth of this month regarding this issue, stating that Japanese people have extraterritorial rights and should not bear any taxes or duties within China. It also falsely claimed that Britain, the United States, and other countries have not paid this year's housing donation. As foreigners residing in China, they enjoy all the benefits of the government's municipal facilities.</p>

<p>Ms. Ding Shujing, the National General Secretary of the YWCA, has left Shanghai to travel north.</p>
<p>She will go to Nanjing, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places to report on her recent experiences in Europe and America and the results of the Geneva Conference to the YWCAs in these four locations.</p>
<p>The Beijing YWCA will hold its annual meeting on June 12th, where Ms. Ding will be the keynote speaker. The various works of the YWCA in that city are highly developed, with particular attention paid to family and children's affairs. The children's playground was opened last autumn and is supervised by doctors. Every day, an open space that can accommodate about 200 children is prepared for play. This autumn, a dormitory for students of national schools will be established in the western part of the city. During her trip to Beijing, Ms. Ding will discuss all matters related to two major conferences to be held in Beijing with local Chinese women. The first is the National Conference of the YWCA to be held in 1932, and the second is the World YWCA Conference in 1933. In this conference, representatives from all countries around the world will gather, and there will be an opportunity to discuss various urgent issues concerning women around the world. It is indeed a very important conference. However, the importance of the National Conference of 1932 is no less than this. In the National Conference, Chinese women can obtain the opportunities they deserve</p>
<p>to serve the country and fulfill their duties as citizens. Because the conference will have a thorough discussion on the question of how women can be responsible and dedicated citizens.</p>

<p>take the body to the Fielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the Special District Land Court, came to the morgue to conduct an examination and ascended to his official position. According to the Western police chief, the incident occurred inland, so it was inconvenient to send detectives to investigate. He has now reported to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, ordering detectives to conduct a detailed investigation in that area. There is still no response. Guo then instructed that the examination had determined that Li Guocai had been shot and killed before his death. The body is temporarily stored in the morgue awaiting collection. The companion soldier is still being treated in the hospital, and his life is also in great danger.</p>

<h3 id="e168">A Grand Opening of the National Goods Market <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall has been operating for ten years. Recently, foreign goods have been repelling domestic goods in the market. Therefore, those who love to use domestic goods have nowhere to buy them. Therefore, a National Goods Market has been specially set up to gather the essence of domestic products for the selection of Chinese people. The opening ceremony was held on the station day of this month. The general situation has been recorded in this newspaper. Regarding the promotion of national goods, I will record the trivial matters seen and heard on that day and send them to this talk for readers to enjoy.</p>
<p>On that day, the party and national flags were crossed at the entrance of the Chamber of Commerce, with a bamboo cloth banner hanging in the middle that read "Opening Ceremony of the National Goods Market of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall". Armed guards and patrolmen were stationed on both sides, and posters were posted all over the walls on both sides of the aisle (Promote National Goods Starting from the National Goods Market) (Using National Goods Is the People's Natural Duty). They were all written on red and green Chinese paper. The auditorium was in the main conference hall, and a registration desk was set up at the entrance. After signing in, guests were given a bag of domestic goods containing cigarettes, toothpaste, monosodium glutamate, Rendan, Zhongshan olives, etc., so they all smiled happily. At 9:00, after playing military music, Wang Xiaolai and Ye Huijun both wore red silk chairman symbols and led representatives of various organizations to the stage. Ye reported on the preparations and said that recently, Chinese people have considered using foreign goods to be fashionable. If this continues, the outflow of rights and interests will be unbearable. In view of this, our association has specially set up a National Goods Market so that patriotic compatriots will not be dazzled and unable to distinguish when they want to buy national goods. After the description, he said that this was the opening speech, and then he took out a report form from his chest, held it in both hands, and read it aloud in public, just like the Taoist priest's general statement during the Buddhist monk's practice, which made everyone laugh. The representative of the municipal government gave a speech, saying that our country is vast, has abundant resources, and a large population, but it cannot be self-reliant because the general merchants do not have a global perspective and sell foreign goods for profit. Consumers do not know what are domestic goods and what are foreign goods when they enter the market. They only choose beautiful and cheap ones to buy and use. Now that domestic goods are gathered in one place, so that people can recognize domestic goods, those who have a little conscience will definitely not buy foreign goods again. Dong Kerren, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, said that in addition to detailing the past experiences of the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall, he was also afraid of causing criticism because he was wearing a suit, so he declared in public that this was a domestic suit. If you don't believe me, you can try the fabric today in the National Goods Market for sale. Wang Jie'an, the representative of the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech detailing how foreigners sell raw materials from our country at low prices and then, in a change of hand, still sell the finished products to our country. The weakness of the country and the poverty of the people for decades are all due to this. I hope that compatriots will wake up. After Xiao Jinqing, the deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry, arrived late, he immediately handed the congratulatory speech given by Minister Kong Xiangxi to Wang Xiaolai. It was a horizontal plaque of gold-splashed paper on white background with more than twenty four-character titles. After Mr. Wang accepted it, he handed it to the master of ceremonies, Xue Guangqian, to post it in front of the stage, together with the vertical axes sent by Lu Xingzhuang and others from the Shanghai National Goods Factory Joint Association (Promote the National Glory) (Save the Rights and Interests). After Wang Liwu distributed the National Goods Introduction Compilation edited by him on the spot, Wang Xiaolai led all the guests to visit the National Goods Market. Limited by the location, only one company in each industry is allowed to participate, and no similar ones are allowed to mix in. All the kitchen cabinets are uniform and very tidy. The cosmetics sold in the Huahua store are categorized and fragrant, and everyone stopped to buy them in crowds. I returned to the inkstone to write this at eleven o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Common Sense About Drinking <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Fu</p>
<p>American newspapers recently reported that about a quarter of Chinese people die from alcohol. In view of this, the government has issued an order to ban it. Commentators say that the American alcohol prohibition is comparable to our country's opium prohibition. I say that we should regard alcohol and tobacco as poisons and fear them like snakes. Then there will be no harm to life. In ancient China, it was often said that alcohol was used to complete etiquette, and it became a custom. Therefore, some people were morally corrupt, but there were not many who died from alcohol. When Da Yu hated sweet wine, it was because he was afraid that the ruler would neglect government affairs. Confucius's unwillingness to be troubled by wine was to encourage scholars not to waste their studies. The rest, such as Zhaolie's prohibition of brewing to maintain the people's food, and Ji Ruan's indulgence in drinking to dispel the worries of the world, are not related to this article, so I will not discuss them here.</p>
<p>As for alcohol, although it is a harmful product, the problem is that we do not exercise self-restraint. However, after examining the reasons for not exercising self-restraint, it is only because we drink alcohol together and actually do not have common sense about drinking. In modern times, science is prosperous, and it is said that drinking too much alcohol can harm sperm and hinder fertility. I did not deeply believe this at first. A certain member of my clan was indeed fond of drinking, and had more than five children who all died young. So he resolutely quit drinking and then had a son who is now five years old. Then I realized that the reason why the previous children did not live long was because they were harmed by alcohol. So the theory that sperm is harmed is not entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>Drinking a little alcohol can activate blood circulation and help digestion, which is beneficial to physical health. It is forbidden to sleep after drinking, as sleeping will stop digestion. It is also forbidden to engage in sexual intercourse, as engaging in sexual intercourse will reverse the five internal organs. This is what researchers of hygiene should pay the most attention to. Other things, such as drinking quickly for a long time, can cause dry heaving, and drinking hot drinks is most likely to harm the lungs. Although we know this well, we often do not pay attention. Also, drinking cold alcohol will produce alcohol mold, although this is unfounded, there is also a true principle. Microbes often grow in alcohol, which is a type of parasite, like vinegar eels in vinegar, and cannot be distinguished by the naked eye, so it is easy to overlook. Only warming the alcohol to a warm temperature before drinking can eliminate this harm.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Talking About Fishing Boats Today <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Yaocheng, sent from Hangzhou</p>
<p>The flowers have fallen in Jiangnan, and it is once again the end of spring. On the banks of the Quanzhou River, where the flowers are in decline, there is once again news of the inspection of prostitutes in the south. Because of this, I recall the old story of the Nine Surname Fishing Boats and record it in Free Talk for the purpose of aiding conversation.</p>
<p>When Emperor Taizu of Ming set Jinling, it was rumored that the Nine Surname Fishing Boats were all the tribes of Zhang Shicheng. When Zhang Shicheng's army was defeated, Emperor Taizu banished them to low-level industries, using boats as homes and not allowing them to land. Although they were called fishing boats, they actually relied on selling laughter for income. They were mostly moored on the Jianggan River. People in Hangzhou named them Jiangshan Boats. The name Jiangshan County may have originated from this, so it was named that. But the common name is Jiang Bai Boats, so it is not known where it came from. Those who are married are called "Fellow-Year Sisters-in-Law," and those who are not married are called "Fellow-Year Sisters." The so-called "Nine Family Sisters Two Fellow-Years" is also true, but according to both versions of the Autumn Rain Collection, "Fellow-Year" is actually a homonym of "Tongyan." At that time, there was Bao Zhupo, the vice minister, who was confused by the boat prostitutes and dismissed from his post. There was also a member of the imperial family, an Eight Banner celebrity, who wrote the phrase "Grass Jiangshan Nine Surname Beauty Hemp." Going up the river, Fuchun, Xindeng, Tonglu, and Yanzhou were all places where officials and merchants spent money to buy boats for travel. When the ministers were melancholy, the prostitutes would accompany the guests and offer wine. When the river moon first rose, the tide was calm, and the banks were full of boats, carrying the Tanlang away. At that time, the nightingales and swallows were reflected in the moonlight, the fragrant mouths were slightly opened, and the Tanboard was lightly slapped. The gentlemen were surrounded by the wine bottles. The brocade curtains were warm in the rear cabin, and the mandarin duck pillows were in pairs. It was a place where clay figurines lost their souls. After the change of dynasty, the fellow-year sisters successively left the boat and landed on the shore, settling in the neighborhood of the Haiyue Bridge and Huapai Building, which had already lost the meaning of the Jiangshan Boats. Last year, the lottery ordered the abolition of prostitution, and the enthusiasm was low. Now, the Hangzhou Municipal Government, together with the Provincial Public Security Bureau, has issued an order to inspect prostitutes. The inspection in the north has just been completed, and the inspection in the south is about to begin. At that time, the nightingales and swallows were terrified, claiming that their dignity was at stake. Therefore, they were led by Qian and others and submitted their cases to the authorities, requesting exemption from inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Record of "Longevity Mother's Painting at Lan Terrace" <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Old Man Sanyuan</p>
<p>Jiangning's Jiang Guobang, styled Suchang, is a gentle and refined scholar, diligent in his studies and skilled in writing. He is especially known for his filial piety towards his widowed mother, Madam Ma. I have known Suchang for twenty years and am pleased to see his scholarship progressing, his conduct becoming more cautious, his heart more humble, and his temperament becoming more calm. It is indeed true that an orphaned son has been raised by his mother's teachings, a fact that is widely acknowledged among the literati and officials. In the fourth month of the year Xinwei, Madam Ma celebrated her seventieth birthday. Suchang requested Mr. Xiao Wuquan to paint "Longevity Mother's Painting at Lan Terrace" and sent it to me in the mountains of Kuanglu, asking me to write a record for it. Suchang said, "My mother, Madam Ma, is from a family in Shu. Her father, who served as the prefect of Zhangzhou, was my maternal grandfather, Zhen. From a young age, she was composed and well-versed in etiquette. She studied alongside her uncles and became proficient in literature and history. At the age of twenty, she married my father, Houmin, the prefect. She was obedient to her parents-in-law, harmonious with her sisters-in-law, and affectionate towards the servants. Although my father lived in luxury, he was diligent and frugal as if he were poor. He often studied at the Xiaosi Temple in the south of the city. My mother carefully prepared his meals and clothing, and occasionally discussed literature with him. My father's scholarship improved daily. When my father became seriously ill, my mother cut her arm to mix blood with the medicine several times, but he eventually passed away, leaving behind two orphaned sons: Guobang, who was four years old, and his younger brother, Guoping, who was three years old. My mother endured her sorrow and suffering and from then on, she never wore elaborate clothing. She raised Guobang and his brother without relying on wet nurses. When they were old enough to attend school, she urged them to get up at dawn and stayed up late to read with them, making sure they memorized the day's lessons before allowing them to rest. If they did not meet her expectations or committed other mistakes, she would scold them severely without any leniency. My mother was both a loving mother and a strict teacher. Furthermore, my father enjoyed giving generously, and my mother supported him wholeheartedly. Since then, she has provided relief to disaster-stricken provinces, established charity granaries in Jinling, and assisted the poor, amounting to millions of dollars. In the third year of Xuantong, the village elders requested the court to commend her for her chastity and filial piety, and built an archway as well as a 'Good Deeds and Charitable Giving' memorial. Guobang wrote a postscript, which was engraved on stone. Contemporary teachers and scholars also wrote articles praising her. Thus, my mother's virtuous conduct and exemplary character became widely known. When the Wuchang Uprising occurred in the year Xinhai, Jinling was also in chaos. Our family hastily fled to Shanghai. Unfortunately, my younger brother, Guotian, passed away prematurely. My mother was overwhelmed with grief. Guobang then purchased a modestly priced residence by the South Lake in Hangzhou and renovated it, naming the bridges and pavilions 'Lan Terrace Villa' in the hope of entertaining my mother and alleviating her sorrow. Later, my wife, née Chou, also passed away from illness. Fortunately, Guobang remarried to Madam Feng, who is able to fulfill her duties as a wife, and is also knowledgeable in literature and skilled in painting. Furthermore, my two grandsons recite the classics and seem to have some understanding of them. This brings some joy to my mother. However, Guobang is mediocre. Although he owes his success to my mother, he has not been abandoned by renowned scholars and elders. Despite encountering world changes, he has no intention of pursuing advancement and bringing honor to my mother. How can he not feel ashamed?" In summary, according to Suchang's account, Madam Ma's fortitude, perseverance, pure and single-minded conduct, and sincere and deep affection are in line with the virtuous mothers recorded in history. She has rightfully raised a virtuous son who repays her kindness. This is also a natural result. It is important to remember that the greatest form of filial piety is nurturing one's ambition, and the greatest way to nurture one's ambition is through self-cultivation and diligent study. Relying on power, influence, and wealth for fame and glory is not the way. Moreover, we are living in an era of unprecedented change, where moral principles have collapsed and reckless behavior is rampant. Is this not a time when Heaven closes and virtuous people hide? If one still harbors thoughts of fame and fortune or blindly adheres to the notion that every patriotic commoner has a responsibility, and rashly attempts to change things, one will only disgrace oneself and one's parents, which is not in line with nurturing one's ambition. Suchang's discernment is evident. Therefore, Lan Terrace Villa is Suchang's earnest attempt to purchase a place for his mother to live in seclusion without complaint, so that he can nurture her ambition. The location boasts the beauty of the inner lake. The Nine Luminaries, Jade Emperor, Three Terraces, and other peaks rise and surround the area. The shimmering waves and mountain scenery create a captivating spectacle, with clouds, flowers, trees, fish, and birds offering a unique and ever-changing view. Suchang respectfully provides Madam Ma with a comfortable retreat, allowing her to immerse herself in the pure and beautiful atmosphere of the lake and mountains. Suchang also enriches the environment with his literary talents, guiding the women and children with kindness, creating a harmonious blend of natural and human sounds that soothe Madam Ma's decades of hardship and usher in auspicious blessings. It is as if the beautiful and ethereal capital is still present in the human world. Heaven is kind to Madam Ma and encourages Suchang to strive for constant and uninterrupted improvement. All of this lies within this painting, which is a symbol of auspicious response.</p>

<p>Wild tea is found only in deep mountain ravines. Those who risk their lives to obtain it do so as quickly as possible. Therefore, they do not wait for it to fully mature but harvest it as soon as possible. They also do not know how to properly roast and bake it. They simply stir and twist it into a bead-like shape in a pot. The shape is very unattractive, curled and thin, resembling lotus seeds. The price is extremely high, always three or four yuan per tael, and it is very rare. One can accumulate less than a pound in a spring. Those who do not know tea are unwilling to buy it, so only tea professionals highly value it (wild mountain tea) as the best of the best. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" states that tea picked before the rain must be aged for three years before drinking to remove its fire toxins. Li Shizhen also spoke extensively about the harmful effects of tea on people. According to my observations, people in Hangzhou drink tea in small amounts as a form of leisurely enjoyment, not as an addiction, like those who indulge in alcohol. Wealthy families buy new tea from mountain villages as soon as it comes on the market, mostly from those who tend their ancestral graves. The amount they purchase is enough to last a year, and they store it for three years before drinking it. They do not use it in the same year. This is similar to newly brewed wine, which must be stored for three years. However, only wealthy families can afford to prepare in advance with such leisure. Therefore, there is no three-year aged tea available in the market, just like three-year aged wine. Wines that are called "aged" are simply those that have been brewed with an extra process the previous year. For example, if six dou of rice were originally used, eight dou are now used to reduce the water content, so it is called extra brewing. There is also so-called home-brewed wine, which is brewed by families for their own consumption and to entertain guests. Its age can often be determined. For example, when a son or daughter is born, wine is brewed and stored, and its name is used as a marker. There is so-called "newborn wine" or "daughter wine." When the daughter marries, it is decorated with painted carvings, often with raised patterns such as melon ribs or round dots, with auspicious words written inside for the third-day celebration. It is called "painted carving." When a son achieves success in the imperial examinations, it is used to treat guests and is called "Scholar Red." Its age is the same as the person's age. If he does not pass the examinations in his lifetime, it is used to celebrate his sixtieth birthday. If the family does not fall on hard times, it will never be sold to others. Therefore, the wines sold on the market are merely imitations. The common wine with a light color and weak taste is called "Filial Piety and Chastity," which refers to the wine brewed when a woman is engaged but her husband dies before marriage, and she remains chaste like Bei Gong Yinger. Because the wine brewed at the time of her birth is useless, she opens it on her parents' birthdays to honor them. Therefore, it is called "Filial Piety and Chastity." Its age is not old, and its color is clear and thin, like bamboo leaf soup, so it is also called "Bamboo Leaf Green." As for the white wine called "Traveler," it is specifically supplied to wine merchants for wholesale. Therefore, its value is the lowest. In the secret language of the manufacturers, it is said that this is not for retail but for wholesale. Only four dou of rice are used for one shi of wine. The wine sold retail in Hangzhou is generally called Shaoxing, which is the "Traveler" wine with water added. The wine called "Aged" is simply "Traveler" wine with caramel color and water added. Only the "Painted Carving" wine is not adulterated, but it is all brewed in the winter of the previous year. Unless you buy it yourself, it is like seeking three-year aged moxa for a seven-year illness in the market; you will never find it in a pharmacy. (The End)</p>

<p>Yesterday HSBC quoted prices for all currencies without any increase or decrease, because the British and American silver markets rose slightly the previous day, but the bank's internal prices for each currency were initially firm, then slightly volatile, and suddenly weakened at noon because the gold market went from sharp to wilted.

<p>General Market Situation: The business climate in the silver and money industry has not deviated from the prosperous years of the past. Since being subjected to various stimuli last year, the industry has reduced its lending activities and focused on trading in various securities with collateral. As a result, families that relied on bank loans are experiencing various difficulties, and financial activities have become sluggish. The fact that interbank call loan rates were the same yesterday is likely due to the above.</p>
<p>Interbank Call Loan Rates (Foreign Silver): The call loan rates in both the morning and afternoon markets were the same because the buying and selling were evenly balanced, resulting in the rate being 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half, which was the same as the early market rate of the previous day (Silver Dismantling) Both the morning and afternoon markets still opened at 3 fen, which was similar to the previous day.

<p>The yarn market is calm, and the overseas flower yarn market is still falling sharply, and the local market is affected by this, and people are tired, but the current yarn sales are still said to be developed, and the Guangdong and Yunnan gangs are very happy, and the coarse yarn is gradually becoming active, and the export exchange of the East Ocean is continuing every day. Twenty-branch and sixteen-branch people Zhong also bought a hundred ninety bales, the same as yesterday. The current yarn market is difficult to be attractive because it is oppressed by a large number of shorts, but according to the real needs, it should have a tendency to rise, so the future cannot be predicted.</p>
<p>There Are Not Many Changes in the Man Standard Man Standard Market Opened In The Morning, With American Cotton Trending Downwards, The Situation Was Very Tired And The Selling Trend Was More Prosperous, With Each Falling Seven, Eight, Nine Qian, 122.</p>

It was found that Changfeng sold 2,900 bales, Gengfeng 2,350 bales, bought Meiji 500 bales, Tongyu 750 bales, Yongfeng 1,400 bales, and Yicheng 750 bales.

<p>The cotton market is rather flat, but the American and Indian cotton markets are falling sharply. This place should be able to drop off, but the Han Road source is lacking in all the places, and there is no more goods that can be sold. Therefore, the foreign cotton environment is very bad, and there is no way to be sure of the future.</p>
<p>The Man Standard Is Affected By Foreign Cotton The Man Standard Market Opens And Follows The Foreign Cotton And Falls. Two or three disks went up again, and as a result, they rose five minutes in the long run. In the afternoon, each month fell five cents to one Qian, with a turnover of 42,200 dan. It was found that Gongtai sold 3,700 dan, Ruidi 1,400 dan, and Taixing 1,700 dan. Yi Yu Bought 4,900 Dan, Xin Heng 3,300 Dan, Ji Feng 1,300 Dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Each village is asking for 80 yuan, and each trade is raising prices to compete for purchases. Wuxi's four rural cocoon markets have opened a total of 136 shops. Weighing has been underway for four or five days. This year's cocoon production is exceptionally poor, with the total yield only about a third of normal years. Each trade's purchase volume is insufficient, only forty or fifty loads per day, at most just over a hundred. Goods arriving on the market are not flowing smoothly, and superior cocoons are especially scarce. In places like Yuqi, Luoshe, Yangshu, Yuansi, Toushiqiao, and Bashiqiao, because each trade is raising prices to compete for purchases, the highest price for superior cocoons has reached above 80 yuan, and even ordinary ones require around 60 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market still showed no improvement. The reason is that actual sales in Lyon are stagnant, and wired silk prices from New York still show no upward trend. The market atmosphere is sluggish. Yesterday, only Lienard and others replenished 20 bales of Shanghai white silk. Meida and others imported 18 bales of yellow and white coarse silk. Prices are difficult to rise.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign tea market opened with Qihua Xiang black tea by Tianyu Foreign Firm at fifteen or sixteen taels, two or three taels higher than last year. Yihe, Jinlong, and other firms have all imported Qifu black tea, but the evaluation of the goods is more stringent than before, and market prices have fallen more than ten taels. The Zhenmei green tea market is trending towards stagnation. Goods from Su'an continue to fall back to 125 taels. Goods from Huizhou and other areas in the Chinese district have not yet opened. Only the Zhenmei and Xiami varieties are in high demand by British firms, and sales prices are also firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday at the Xin Zha North Shanghai rice market, the weather turned clear, and over ten boats from Changxi and Xiansi and other areas arrived. Sales of secondary goods are still sluggish. Shops feel even more stuck, and prices have become loose. Thin rice from Shipu, Qingjiao, Sijing, and other places is ignored, and the trend is downward. Half-foot foreign rice is also low. Few goods arrive from Baja and Bujia, and factories have some inventory. Because Saigon rice spot goods are slightly active, transactions are not smooth and prices are weak. Glutinous rice has undergone slight value adjustments.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Xilu area in South Shanghai saw slightly fewer arrivals, and the rising trend gradually stabilized. Boats sent 500 to 600 piculs. Because the Yejidun waterway in North Shanghai is shallow, there is no circulation and the arrivals are few. Rice shops are still unwilling to purchase more, and rice merchants are slightly affected. Local inventory is still not excessive, and prices are stagnant. Changxi Beigeng and Su Tongji geng are each one chi lower. Early and late rice from sand boats are still selling well, and prices are tight. Foreign rice and variable yuan rice have few outlets, a downstream trend.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Standard Flour Prices Decline Consistently <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months consistently showed a weakening and declining trend. The weather has turned clear again, and the season is busy with planting. It is expected that the new wheat harvest can be fully covered in three or four days. In terms of the year's harvest, the north and south regions have a clear shortage and a hidden surplus. At the time of harvest, the weather is good, and the wheat's condition is unusually dry and clean. The source will surely see a surge in supply. Therefore, people's hearts are naturally shifting and loosening step by step. Moreover, the actual sales groups in the north are not optimistic, so the later steps may re-present a soft image. As a result, this month fell two cents compared to the previous period. July fell two and a half cents, August and September fell two cents and seven mils, and October fell two cents and a half. November fell two cents and seven mils.</p>
<h3 id="e185">This Month's Wheat Plummets One Dime <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market declined across all months during both the morning and afternoon sessions, with this month experiencing the most significant drop. This was primarily due to a slight decrease of approximately two jiao in the reported prices of foreign wheat. Additionally, the favorable weather conditions naturally inclined the general sentiment towards a softening of the market. Although some operators held substantial long positions for this month's settlement, the new wheat harvest is now complete, and based on the quality of the wheat arriving, it is considered to be between average and good. Initially, resistance was maintained, but eventually, even the major long positions started to unwind, leading to a sharp decline in market prices. The drop was particularly steep. July and August also weakened, while September and later months showed greater stability. Consequently, this month plummeted by one dime compared to the previous week, July fell by seven fen, August fell by six fen, September and October fell by four fen, and November fell by three fen. The new wheat market has seen a continuous influx of supplies in recent days, and the quality is considered to be good. Yesterday, over 900 packages of Nanjing Taipingfu wheat were opened, priced between 3.92 taels and 3.90 taels, and were purchased by Shenda.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Piece Goods: Black Cloth Sales Exceptionally Smooth <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The market for cloths from this factory has recently become stable. The rising trend of fine cloths has ceased, mainly because demand from various northern ports has weakened, and activity in this street is stagnant. However, the Sichuan trade has been actively purchasing large quantities, so prices can still be maintained. Fine twill is very weak. Only Yihua bleached cloth has seen continuous new highs, with Jinshan Pagoda reaching 9.35 taels yesterday. Striped bleached cloth has become almost non-existent, due to the factory's scarce output and strong sales. Among coarse cloths, the Hubei Tianzi brand is relatively weak and gradually declining. 16-pound, 13-pound, and 11-pound cloths have all stabilized. 84 original cloth has slightly declined after once rising. Yesterday, Lan Feiyu was 6.05 taels and Tiaowu was 6 taels.</p>
<p>The East-West piece goods market situation is exceptionally chaotic. Dong goods like straight tribute woolens, straight tribute satins, and fine broadcloth are still active. Besides spot purchases, guest merchants also started actively searching for July-August futures yesterday. This is because the gold market remains firm, and Osaka prices have risen without falling. Therefore, purchasing in Shanghai was popular. Merchant from Dalian, Qingdao, and Tianjin have handled the most purchases. Over two hundred pieces of straight tribute satin were transacted. Tiansi Caiyuan and Tiansi Huangjin were both at 4.3 qian, Matou at 3.65 qian, Sanyou Tu at 3.5 qian, and Zhuhu at 3.25 qian. Fine broadcloth saw more than three hundred pieces of the July Huxin Ting model purchased, priced at 3.375 qian. Moganshan Lieyan straight tribute woolens saw many searches, a surprising reflection of people's preferences.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Dedicate "Violent Storm" to the Modern Theater Scene <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Niu</p>
<p>Some say that relying on aesthetic troupes in various places to shoulder the burden of China's theatrical movement is useless. Public performances by motley crews once or twice a year can never achieve any artistic success. Therefore, to give Chinese theatrical art considerable development, it is necessary for the great educators to awaken and add a theater department to each university or specialized school to cultivate basic Actors or Dramatists. But everything in China is extremely lacking. All education has reached a state of bankruptcy. Who would still pay attention to theater education? In such a large China, the only ones who have made achievements in training theatrical art are Ouyang Yuqian's Drama School in Guangdong, Xiong Fo'er's Department of Drama at the Art Academy in Beiping, and Jiao Juyin's Opera School. In addition, Jiangsu, which can be considered culturally developed, does not yet have this organization. The only thing that can be slightly comforting is the Department of Drama specially set up by the Provincial Educational College to train talents for mass education. Drama is art, and the realm of art cannot be defined by education. Those who advocate aesthetic supremacy, Art For Art's Sake, say so. Therefore, the Department of Drama of the Provincial Educational College, which uses drama as a tool for mass education, naturally cannot satisfy the desires of ordinary artists because it has such a limitation. But to speak in one aspect, apart from formal classroom training, there is also an experimental stage for their testing opportunities. Their progress is naturally much faster than that of the aesthetic troupes. The person in charge of this department is the drama expert, Mr. Gu Jianchen. According to his personal proposition, the masses and the drama should not absolutely accommodate the masses. Therefore, the plays he directs almost based on his above assertion. He is for advocating dramatic art.</p>
<p>He said that art should be popularised and the masses should be artistic, in short, that is not to cater to any aspect. In order to realize his proposition, Mr. Gu has directed many scripts. The most successful are Blood Flower Paying Back a Patriotic Heart and The Unfinished Tombstone. Because they are about to finish this semester, there are exhibitions of achievements. Therefore, there is a public performance. Originally, I wanted to play the fan of the young lady. Later, because there were some problems with the candidates, I re-arranged Mr. Gu's own recent three-act tragedy, Violent Storm. Mr. Gu has always had a weird temper and is unwilling to direct his own plays. His reason is that directing other people's plays must be done with some speculation and effort to gain artistic progress. If you direct your own plays, you will have less of this opportunity. But this time, in order to choose a good script, I had to risk doing it. The script of Violent Storm has not yet been published, so few people outside know about it. I read their mimeographed copy at a friend's house and dared to introduce it here. This is a nationalistic drama. The plot roughly describes the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese nations, with Manchuria and Mongolia as the background, and a Korean woman as the main thread of the whole play. The young man Yang Zhiqin gathers comrades to implement the plan to develop Manchuria and Mongolia, but it is destroyed by the Japanese. The map planning book and other things are lost. Yang Zhiqin was wronged. Not only was he abandoned by the masses, but his fiancee also cancelled his engagement with him. Outside rumors pointed out that he was tempted by the Japanese, so he got the title of traitor. He had nowhere to tell. His heart disease was hurt. Fortunately, Ono Umeko, who thought she was a Japanese woman, knew that her mother was actually Korean, so she admitted to the Chinese and brought back the stolen map and planning book. But the poor young man Yang Zhiqin had already become insane and committed suicide. Later, the Korean girl also died in the hands of the Japanese. The plot of this drama is very tortuous, and there are many shocking pens. It can be described with the old saying that there is no way out of the mountains and rivers, and there is another village. The dialogue at the end has a lot of strength, which can show the cruelty and unreasonableness of Japanese imperialists and the pain of being killed after being used.</p>
<p>Shinjiro (standing at the door, aggressive) Umeko, you have done a good deed.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Camping <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Bing She</p>
<p>Umeko (surprised but immediately calm and composed) What good deed did I do?</p>
<p>Shinjiro Where did you take that thing? Find it quickly.</p>
<p>Umeko (candidly) Where we took it from should be returned there.</p>
<p>Shinjiro What are you talking about? You left, and the thing disappeared. I knew it was your trick, so I immediately stuck you here. Where's the thing you took?</p>
<p>Umeko It's right here. It has returned to Chinese hands. You can't take it back anymore.</p>
<p>Shinjiro But you can't not love your country...</p>
<p>Umeko It is precisely because I love my country that I do this. Look at the clothes I am wearing now. Your intelligence will tell you who I am. I am a Korean. I want to love our Korea and no longer love your Japan. You Japanese specialize in using us Koreans to fight against the Chinese. The sacrifice is ours and the benefit is yours. I have been fooled enough times. I can understand myself now.</p>
<p>Shinjiro Nonsense! How dare you say you are not Japanese?</p>
<p>Umeko How can I not be Japanese? Now I can't tell you, but there is one thing I can tell you, simply put, it is the two words (benevolence) and (compassion). Do you Japanese have these two words? For example, this time I was fooled into doing something that I am sorry for the Chinese, which hurt Yang Zhiqin... At that time, my conscience discovered that God's mercy was moving in my blood vessels. At first, someone rumored that I was Korean and I didn't believe it, but now I can suddenly discover that you Japanese don't have the conscience and the mercy of God, which proves that I am indeed Korean and not a Japanese with only cruelty (look at my clothes) You see, I feel so comfortable wearing my own country's clothes.</p>
<p>They - Educational Academy - have a Suzhou girl, Miss Ye Yunzhen, who is short and has a round face. She played the Japanese very successfully in a patriotic heart and an unfinished tombstone. Therefore, Ono Umeko, the Korean girl who is considered Japanese in Violent Storm, will still be played by her. Naturally, she will be competent and happy. This drama is scheduled to be performed at the school on the 13th and 14th of this month. After the performance, I may write another report on the performance.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Modern Public Finance <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Yuan</p>
<p>Author: Zhao Zubian Publisher: Guanghua Bookstore</p>
<p>The financial phenomena of each era are sufficient to influence the financial theories of each era. This book is prefixed with the word "Modern" because it studies modern political principles and principles. This is a scientific book with a sense of the times. China's current finances are very chaotic, so that the national power is declining and the people's livelihood is in trouble. It is all because financial science has not been clarified and promoted. The author is a caring person, so this book is a guide for modern financiers. There is a need to introduce it.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into five chapters: General Theory, Expenditure Theory, Revenue Theory, Revenue and Expenditure Matching Theory, Financial Administration Theory, and Local Finance Theory.</p>
<p>The general theory describes the characteristics, evolution, current situation and future trends of finance, which are all pre-requisites for financial scholars. This method of outlining the main points first allows readers to have a clear concept of financial science, which is also a feature of this book. The essence of financial science in Section 4 of General Theory 1 is even more the backbone of the whole book. Since financial science is a systematic study of financial principles and principles, its essence certainly cannot go beyond the scope of finance. The content of the scope of finance is expenditure, revenue, the actual matching of revenue and expenditure, and the formal matching and management of revenue and expenditure. Financial science is the study of the principles of expenditure, so there is expenditure theory. It is the study of the principles of revenue, so there is revenue theory. It is the study of the actual matching of revenue and expenditure, so there is revenue and expenditure matching theory or public debt theory. It is the study of the formal matching and management of revenue and expenditure, so there is budget theory, current accounting theory, and final accounting theory, or collectively referred to as financial administration theory. Therefore, the author divides financial science into expenditure theory, revenue theory, revenue and expenditure matching theory, and financial administration theory, plus local finance theory is the most suitable for the scope of modern financial science. As for the order of arrangement, there are also those who hold different opinions, such as first using financial administration theory or simply calling financial administration theory budget theory and then after expenditure theory. There are many theories, each with its own reasons. The author of this book designs the current national finance based on one year as the standard, so it still follows the order of common sense and is named as expenditure theory, revenue theory, revenue and expenditure matching theory, financial administration theory, and local finance theory. The reason for such an arrangement is that finance is based on the principle of measuring expenditure for income. It should first be expenditure theory, then revenue theory. Finance is based on the principle of matching revenue and expenditure, and the matching of revenue and expenditure is actually different from the form. There is no way to attach form to reality, and there is no way to apply reality without form. Reality is revenue and expenditure matching. Form is financial administration. Therefore, it is followed by revenue and expenditure matching theory, and then financial administration theory. Local finance is the result of the development of local autonomy in recent times, and its theory is completely based on the theory of national finance, but there are minor differences. Therefore, putting local finance theory behind this book is exactly as it should be.</p>
<p>The first chapter, Expenditure Theory, Expenditure is the money paid by the country to use labor and objects within a fiscal year in order to fulfill its duties. That is, the country's payment of currency for the price of required economic goods. It studies the facts about this expenditure theory in order to discover its general principles and to provide us with a basis for understanding whether various expenditures are appropriate and to assist in reorganizing finances. The position of expenditure theory in financial science is the same as that of consumption theory in economics. It is the purpose of the whole and the main point of everything. If there is no expenditure theory, other parts such as revenue will become meaningless actions. To study expenditure, we must first know the nature of expenditure. There are two theories about the nature of expenditure: one is the harmful theory of expenditure and the other is the beneficial theory of expenditure. This issue has been studied since the 18th century, and there are many different opinions to this day. The author describes in detail the consumption of the British orthodox school, the production theory of the historical school, and the half-consumption and half-production theory of the modern eclectic school. Therefore, we can better understand the economic nature of expenditure theory. The principles of expenditure are divided into political, financial, economic, and social, which can also be summarized. The classification of expenditure is also extremely complicated. There are usually two classification methods: deductive and inductive. The former method is very simple, and it is usually a dichotomy. The latter method is more complicated, and it is usually a division of more than two points. The former is theoretical and the latter is factual. The author refers to the two theories and divides expenditure into historical, economic, political, and financial, which are simple and appropriate for scholars.</p>
<p>The most important chapter in the expenditure chapter is the research method of expenditure. The methods of researching expenditure are nothing more than deduction and induction. The former is to seek facts with theory and the latter is to seek theory with facts. The former must have a correct concept as the basis and the latter must have correct facts or figures as the basis. However, the results of studying the inductive method are mostly flow statistics. In other words, the results of the inductive method of expenditure research must be expenditure statistics. Each country has its own expenditure statistics. If we want to find out the general trend of expenditure in various countries, we must collect and compare various statistics. However, the content and value of the statistics of various countries often vary greatly and are difficult to compare. The author specifically points out the reasons for not being easy to compare.</p>
<p>1. The classification of expenses and the scope of each category in the budget preparation of various countries are often different, so it is difficult to compare.</p>
<p>2. Although the principle of budget unification is a publicly recognized principle in finance, in practice, special budgets are often established outside the general budget, so the truth of expenditure cannot be explored.</p>
<p>3. The existence or absence of supplementary budgets and the amount of them are also sufficient to make it difficult to know the truth of general expenditure, at least to make the investigation difficult.</p>
<p>4. The implementation period of the budget should be when the national treasury has more income and less expenditure, but in practice, the starting period of the fiscal year in various countries is different, resulting in many differences in the impact of expenditure on the economy in various countries, so it is also difficult to compare.</p>
<p>5. The content of financial expenses in the expenditure statistics of various countries is often different, and the amount is often different, so the superficial calculation of the expenditure statistics of various countries is not enough to represent the actual truth of the national expenditure.</p>
<p>6. Modern local autonomy is developed and local expenses are also very important, but local expenditure statistics are not very complete, so it can be seen that it is not correct to compare only with national expenditure.</p>
<p>7. The expenditure statistics of various countries in the United Nations are also incomplete, so it is difficult to study the truth of the entire expenditure by only discussing the expenditure of the United Nations.</p>
<p>8. In countries with unclear politics, the surface figures in the budget are often untrue.</p>
<p>With the above difficulties and actual conditions, we can naturally pay special attention when using this kind of statistics.</p>
<p>The second chapter, Revenue Theory, The total amount of currency received by the central government or local groups for the treasury within a fiscal year to meet expenditures is called revenue. The author observes the evolution of revenue from a historical perspective and divides it into four periods: (1) the period of official income, (2) the period of privilege income, (3) the period of tax income, and (4) the period of official industry income. The classification of revenue is very complicated by various schools, and there is no need to attach importance to it in theory. The author advocates the dichotomy of revenue. This classification has about six types, namely (1) automatic income and passive income, (2) public law income and private law income, (3) micro-tax income and industrial income, (4) ordinary income, accidental income, and extraordinary income, (5) current income and temporary income, (6) public economic income and private economic income. Among the above six classifications, the author also advocates using the sixth type to study revenue because revenue is composed of current income and temporary income, and the sixth type is exactly what explains current income. According to the above theory, the author classifies revenue as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Current revenue (a) Income of public economy (A) Political affairs income 1. Handling fee 2. Usage fee 3. Special donation 4. Illegal money (B) Tax (b) Income of private economy (A) Official property income (B) Official industry income (B) Temporary revenue (a) Purely temporary income (A) Private donation (B) War compensation (C) Confiscation of unclaimed property (b) Predetermined temporary income (A) Increase tax (B) Raise public debt (C) Sales of official land</p>
<p>With such a classification, we can understand it at a glance without looking at the explanation.</p>
<p>This book describes the theory, principles, and classification of taxes in detail in the discussion of public economic income in this chapter, and discusses the income tax, property tax, income tax, circulation tax, and consumption tax separately in the discussion of various taxes, which is particularly concise.</p>
<p>The third chapter, Revenue and Expenditure Matching Theory, The principle of national finance is to match revenue and expenditure. In other words, current revenue must be used to fill current expenditure, and temporary revenue must only be used to fill temporary expenditure. Within a considerable range, there are also those who use current revenue to fill temporary expenditure. In short, in budget making, we must never make revenue and expenditure offset each other and still have a surplus or shortage. However, in reality, if there is a surplus, there is no problem. The most relevant thing is the financial shortage. The method to solve this shortage problem is public debt, so some people also call the theory of revenue and expenditure matching the theory of public debt. In other words, there is nothing else to discuss in the theory of revenue and expenditure matching besides the discussion of public debt. This book succinctly describes the meaning, essence, methods, types and consolidation of public debt. The most important thing is that it explains the advantages and disadvantages of issuing public debt very clearly. Financiers can refer to it to know where to go.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter, Local Finance Theory, Local finance is the study of the finance of local groups, divided into local expenditure theory, local revenue theory, revenue and expenditure matching theory, and financial administration theory. The special points of local expenditure theory are listed as follows: (1) Local expenditure should try to reduce administrative expenses and expand business expenses. (2) Local expenditure should be restricted by central laws and regulations. (3) Local expenditure should pay special attention to the implementation of social policies. (4) Local expenditure should be based on current expenditure as the principle, and temporary expenditure can only be carried out when it is absolutely necessary. (5) Local expenditure should regard expenditures outside the budget as unexpected abuses. (6) Local expenditure sometimes has the expenditure of sharing money and assisting money. The former is the cost of the central government that is shared by various local groups, and the latter is the mutual assistance of local groups.</p>
<p>In addition, local revenue and expenditure matching are largely the same as those of the country, but the special differences between local financial administration and national financial administration are also things that local finance researchers must know. The records are as follows: (1) Local budgets are always under the supervision of the state, and the state has the power to revise and enforce them. (2) Although the local autonomy laws all have provisions on the accounting system, they are only general and not sufficient for application, so the interpretation of analogy must be used in local financial administration. The national accounting law and auditing law can be applied to what is not provided for in the local autonomy laws. (3) The fiscal year should be the same as the national year, but the starting period of the local year should be appropriate one or two months after the national budget is determined. (4) Local income and expenditure are very simple, and the period for sorting out receipts and payments should be shorter. (5) In addition to the general budget, local finances often have many special budgets because local income is mainly derived from industry. (6) The scope of local finance is very small and predictable. We should try our best to avoid proposing supplementary budgets.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say that this book is a guide for modern financiers.</p>

<p>Well-known calligraphers and painters Wang Zhongshan, Zhang Yuguang, Ye Weishen, Gao Shangzhi, Xu Xiaochun, Wang Fengxian, Shen Yizhai, Guo Jilan, and others, in response to the needs of society as the summer season arrives, have each created convenient scrolls. Together, they will exhibit numerous landscape paintings, bird-and-flower paintings, and animal paintings from June 9th to 11th at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Additionally, various painting manuals from each artist will be displayed and sold.</p>
<p>The Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau, located at the corner of Shilu Road on Sanma Road, is a revolutionary new store that has risen to prominence. In addition to gaining the trust of society with its two special features of selecting excellent goods and setting low prices, it also excels in training all its employees to treat customers with the five virtues of humility, kindness, gentleness, courtesy, and concession as the sole method. Therefore, the bureau's recent excellent business performance has set a new record unmatched by major silk and satin stores. It is reported that the large batch of seasonal summer goods that the bureau recently received has already been sold out. Now, they have added new products such as woven flower georgette, woven flower voile, woven flower gold silk, woven flower silver silk, specially made floral Western Indian georgette, Palas, plain crepe, and other items, displayed in the windows with a dazzling array. Customers are welcome to select and purchase.</p>
<p>The Jinxing Tie Company, located at No. 422, Baoshan Road, Baotong Road Intersection, Zhabei, declares that its products have always been known for their excellence. Recently, to facilitate the academic circles in the Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Zhenru areas, they have added a</p>
<p>Branch store specializing in the sale of ties, shirts, suits, separate sports shirts, trousers, etc. produced by the company. A big sale starts today for fourteen days. 1931-style summer ties are only priced at fifty cents each. This is truly a good opportunity for all circles to purchase clothing and separate items. The company held a major sale once last year, which was very short-lived, and many people regretted missing it.</p>
<p>The Guanshengyuan Food Company on Nanjing Road declares that the company's recent seasonal food product, zongzi (sticky rice dumplings), is the most popular. Based on the experience of making Cantonese-style zongzi that suit Shanghai people's taste over the years, a large quantity of products has now been produced. Flavors include lotus seed paste, egg yolk, ham, salted meat, and fresh meat. Prices range from one dime to several dimes each and are packaged in art boxes at no extra charge. Sales have been very brisk at the company's main store in Japan, as well as the old store in Jiumudi, the branch store on Henan Road, and the branch store on Fada Road.</p>
