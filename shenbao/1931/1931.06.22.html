<p>時評</p>
<h3>美宣布緩付戰債賠欵一年</h3>
<p>美總統發表宣言。允許國際間之債欵賠欵。一律緩付一年雖未如歐洲方面取消與减輕之期望。然有此一年緩付之時期。從容商榷。安知將來不獲再進一步之結果。故今日美總統之宣言。已博得歐洲多數國之同情而德國尤爲歡迎。此誠歐美間進行親善之先聲。而亦世界恢復經濟之動機也</p>
<p>美總統宣言。自稱爲適合時機之明哲舉動。初非虚語。蓋自此世界經濟捲入不景氣之狂潮中。物價低落與貨幣騰貴兩種結果。債務國方面增加負担過重。實有無力償還之情勢。若必執協定爲詞。迫以必付。是不啻迫令入於破產之途。必將益增債務國之惡感。一方爲美國自身計。欲發展美國商業。必須培養歐洲各國之購買力。歐洲各國在此困難之情勢下。欲對美履行債務。同時即無力購買商品。實亦陷美商業於不振之一原因。故美在此時而必堅持成約者。於自身亦多不利。由斯兩點觀察美國此舉。誠不失爲智者吾更望其在此緩付一年之時期中。美與歐洲各國。更能深切諒角。而得一最後美满之解决。則有益於世界和平不少也。</p>

<p>胡佛向世界建議</p>
<h3>停付債欵一年</h3>
<p>旨在解救目下歐洲經濟危局</p>
<p>他國間債務同樣展付爲條件</p>
<p>戰債與賠欵認爲截然兩事</p>
<p>並聲明反對取銷政治債權</p>
<p>路透二十日華盛頓電　胡佛總統已宣佈向世界提議、停付一切政府債欵一年、凡外國政府欠美之債欵、應在從今年七月一日起一年内繳付者、美政府願展緩其繳付、惟須經美國國國之承認、再須各重要債權國將國際債欵之繳付亦延緩一年、此議要旨、在使債務國政府有恢復其國家繁昌之時間、美國人民爲自已利益計、須爲明白的債權人良好的鄰人、暫停付債一舉之旨趣、乃欲以今後一年專努力於世界經濟之恢復、並使美國境内現已發動之復原力量、不爲外來勢力所阻遏、渠絶不贊成欠美債欵之取銷、此種舉動、不能增進世界信用、而債務國亦從未作取銷債務之建議、惟債欵之淸理、以債務國在尋常狀况下付債能力爲根據、美國念及世界現有之非常狀態、自當適應其自已政策與原則、一切政府債欵賠欵及救濟債欵皆可停付、惟政府欠私人之債務、則不在内云、胡佛總統於發表其提議時、並宣佈參議員二十一人贊成此議者之姓氏、内有波拉·格拉斯·摩羅·摩斯·台維斯及李德等人、胡佛總統又稱、此項計畫亦爲駐英美大使道威斯及楊格所贊同、總統繼稱、經濟衰落、亦軍備担負有以致之、今美國有此停付債欵之行爲、雖與明年舉行之陸地軍備限制大會無連带關係、然美國希望以此助人志願之憑證、促成爲解决軍縮大問題所必要之好意云、胡佛總統又切實聲明、美政府今仍以爲賠欵與恊約國負美之債並無關係、其言曰、吾人並未與聞一般賠欵、或殖民地與產業之分配事、恊約國償還吾美貸予供戰爭爭與善後用之債欵、非以德國賠欵或與此有關之項爲解决之根據、故賠欵純爲歐洲之問題、實與吾人無關云云、美國駐英大使道威斯將軍刻在芝加哥、據稱、胡佛總統之建議、乃商諸兩黨領袖而後發表、實代表美國之意見云、聞兩黨領袖願竭力贊助胡佛總統、故無庸召集國會特别會議考慮此議、下屆國會乃在十二月間召集、屆時將提交核准、至戰債付欵、則在十二月十五日到期、</p>
<p>美聯念日華盛頓電　美總統之緩付戰債提議、爲使世界人民於財政重担下、稍得喘息餘地、對於德國大可以解救眉急、英國旣緩付美債、當可允德人緩付賠欵、是故此舉可望促進全世界之經濟恢復、實爲美國戰債與賠欵政生上之最進步驟、美總統之詳細計劃、大約下星期内當可發表、今日一篇宣言、已使紐約證劵交易所大爲活動、各證劵價格莫不大漲、至此次發表宣言之前、國外方面美財長梅隆與英首相麥唐納及英格蘭銀行總裁先後晤商、而美國駐德法大使亦曾分别向兩政府接洽密報總統、國内方面則美總統不僅召集參衆兩院要人政界領袖詳細討論、且與紐約銀行界亦有長時間談話、又在今日發表之前、英國駐美大使會訪美財政次長有所商確、事後財政次長立謁總統陳報一切、且此皆足以見其性質之重大、逆料美總統旣有此項提議、德國即將要求緩付賠欵、或將宣稱無力履行楊格計劃條件、當楊格計劃最後在海牙定</p>

<h3>接國外要電</h3>
<p>約時、各國財政家皆知其中含一滑稽條文、實啓修改途徑、蓋若德國利用兩年停止之特權後、自覺國内經濟仍在不安定狀態時、可以訴請國際淸償銀行組織顧問委員會、調查德國付欵能力、屆時調查結果、謂果如德人所言、或將重開賠欵會議、否則亦將使德國與恊約問關係陷入困難地位、至德國之緩付賠欵、僅能以有條件部份爲限、（即修改楊格計劃亦以此爲限）此項賠欵在協約國方面用以償付戰債、故認其與戰債有連带關係、倘德國照楊格計劃實行緩付、或竟加以修改、則戰債必受影響、徵諸道威斯及楊格計劃往例、莫不如是、但美國則始終未嘗承認兩者之間發生兹係、而美銀行界又將盡力反對減輕戰債、此兩點實爲今後賠欵與戰債兩問題之關鍵、而美總統此番宣言所以特别鄭重聲明之也、</p>
<p>國民二十日倫敦電　今日倫敦方面認美總統停付一切戰債一年之提議、極爲重要、據素以準確見稱之觀察時事者向美聯社表示、此次胡佛總統决定對於世界經濟衰落、供給切它挽救方法、必將大有影響於歐戰以後財政方面之總淸理、在今以前、此種淸理認爲業已完畢、但自美總統有此提議後、勢將重行引起戰債與賠欵問題、而歐洲向來主張之理由、亦因此顯已獲得勝利、其得由（一）歐洲力爭戰債與賠欵兩問題有密切關係、美國始終堅决拒絶、今乃第一次正式默認兩者之互相關聯、（二）美國卒已承認戰債有重大影響於世界經濟狀况、（三）美國第一次默認戰債與普通商業債務性質、微有不同、（四）胡佛總統之宣言、足以恢復將來戰債統歸取消之希望、倫敦方面視此第四項尤爲重要、據某君意見、美總統此議即不論其對於經濟界所立時發生之影響、祗就歐洲之戰債情形言、亦大爲之改觀、現倫敦人士似認美總統已對於戰債與賠欵兩問題、已開啓國際間重開談判途徑、</p>
<p>國民二十日柏林電　美總統胡佛日前之宣言、謂美國極注意歐美二大陸之經濟狀况、並亟願設法救濟云云、刻該項宣言極爲德國人民所歡迎、美總統此項宣言之原因、大約係美國財長梅隆此次來歐觀察之結果、蓋梅隆氏怵於德國經濟狀况之危殆、深慮德國政府搖動、將影響於全世界之商業也、至美國救濟之方法、迄今尙無一定之報告、但自紐約傳來之消息、謂美國所採取之步驟有二、一爲由美國聯邦銀行以三十三萬馬克貸給德國國家銀行、一爲欠美之歐洲各項政治借欵、一概停付是也、二者之中以停付借欵之計劃、準備尙需時日、且又必須經過美國參議院之通過、恐不如第一計畫之易望成功也、又倫敦每日電報近亦載一消息、謂梅隆氏近在倫敦宣稱、美國在討論修正借欵計劃、須英國加入抵制俄國之團體爲先决條件、因蘇俄現有大宗廉價之麥出口、美國因保護本國農起見、不得不加以抵制、故尤望英國能加入國際聯合抵制之團體、再美總統最近又發表願將歐洲各項借欵允其停付一年、美國此種舉動、顯係受時局一時之衝動、現各經濟專家尙未敢贸然加以評論、</p>
<p>路透二十一日巴黎電　此間各報對於胡佛總統之建議、意見龐雜、有歡迎以爲適當其時者、有謂須將各債全行取銷、而後始能博得美譽者、晨報之結語曰、德國仍須繳付楊格計劃下所謂無條件之賠欵、蓋美總統之建議、並不施於非商業化之債項也、</p>
<p>國民二十一日羅馬電　美胡佛總統停止戰債一年之建議傳至此間後、羣衆大爲歡忭、認爲美國已承認楊格計劃下之付欵、守實德國經濟力所不堪擔負、胡佛總統之出此、蓋知德國及他國若長此受經濟壓迫、則將使政治與社會不靖、轉入危境、其影響終必延及美國也、羅馬當局及銀行家皆謂胡佛總統之建議、實世界經濟整理企圖之第一有效而具建設性之步驟、此舉將於最近之將來、有極重要之發展、或謂胡佛總統之建議、就歐洲列强之態度之而言、其發生之偉大勢力、在政治一方面猶重於經濟一方面云、胡佛建議發表時、唯美國市塲仍在交易中、故此間財政家均拭目以待星期一日世界財政市塲上所感受此項建議之影響、</p>

<h3>米價步漲原因</h3>
<p>有人收運出口</p>
<p>近來本埠南北兩米市、因來源衡少、價格逐漸高漲、昨日北市售開最高白粳每石洋十四元八角、又十四元六角、又十四元二角、薄稻每石洋十三元七角、又十三元五角、白元每石十三元四角、較之上星期又漲起二三角、據米業中人云、近來米價增漲之原因、實有人紛往常錫各鄉、秘密收羅、裝運出口、爲數已屬不鮮、以致各鄉存貨、將有搜羉殆盡之勢、故滬埠來源日少、轉瞬靑黄不濟、恐其價有步漲之勢云、</p>
<p>浙省</p>
<h3>夏繭又將受天時影響</h3>
<p>浙屬向爲我國著名蠶絲區域、繭汛較蘇屬爲早、今歲春繭、因受天時之損害、繭產奇歉、統扯祗及三分收成、而浙省杭紹湖嘉、近年來絲廠業日益發展、全省絲廠、共達二十餘家、乾繭原料、需要激增、今屆各屬春繭、共產十二三萬担、被滬埠絲商及餘繭客、搜購十之七八、本省絲廠收額有限、供不需求、緯成等各廠商、祗得勸導農民、加育夏繭、以補春繭之不足、是以今夏各屬繭户、均提早孵育夏蠶、飼額不弱、收蟻後天氣晴暢、加以風和日暖、頗合育蠶之進行、頭眠後、蠶蟻發育順利、經過良好、飼料（即夏桑葉）充足、頗有豐收之希望、現下杭紹兩屬、早帮將四眠、晚帮三眠、嘉湖等處、亦均在二眠之中、詎近數日中、霉雨連綿、繼以悶熱驟寒、致早帮蠶蟻、均發現變化、不眠停食、以及因食濕葉曁寒暖不匀之影響、洩黄吐黑、以致僵斃、幾蹈春蠶之覆轍、現狀不佳、近來天公雖已轉晴、而氣候仍寒、夏蠶前途、仍難樂觀云、</p>
<p>豆米行</p>

<h3>郭外峯談招商局近况</h3>
<p>新任招商局總辦郭外峯氏視事以來、已一月餘、昨日日社記者往訪郭氏於私庽、叩以招商局最近狀况、及整理計劃、據答甚詳、兹誌之如下、</p>
<p>金利源案　關於金利源碼頭案、法方態度仍甚强硬、近自局中直接向之交涉後、頗有進展、法總領甘格林稱、須三十萬始可贖回、局方現允二十五萬、尙爲接近、招商局方面、已向政府商界各方面徵求意見、須視法方退讓至如何地步、然後再行定奪、然離解决當不遠也、</p>
<p>租輪發還　此次總司令部、曾因運兵向該局租去長江輪船九隻、現局僅剩圇船二隻、郭外峯氏晋京、即爲請求發還輪船事、近總司令部已允陸續發還、最近期間、業已先發還江華輪一隻、</p>
<p>拆除產屋　該局在四川路有產屋若干、值價頗鉅、最近以敝舊不堪、故已拆除、并以該處產屋、業已抵押與人、故拆除之後、不再建造新屋、除非由外界投資造屋云、</p>
<p>整頓計劃　郭氏又語日日社記者、招商局殘破之餘、千瘡百孔、若欲談整理、正如一部二十四史、不知從何說起、惟籠統而言、先須從小處做去、同時并欲先行整理財政、財政旣有辦法、一切難題、自可迎刃而解、目下最感危急者、即輪船均歷時甚久、破舊不堪、而又無力添造新輪、長此任其舊輪淘汰、終非久計、故亟待整理財政、俾得添造新輪、以利航運云云</p>
<p>裁員暫緩　記者又詢以外傳裁員問題、究欲實行否、據答裁員雖係節省源流之一種、然如談節省源流、則有多種問題、更重於裁員者、裁員問題、當然須暫緩、目下局中職員、確爲太多、按理每一機關人員冗繁、即須裁撤、不敷應用、則宜增加、本人亦主此旨、惟招商局之裁員、尙未至其時云、</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>説謊話以掩飾其行蹤。爲結婚後的男子所必需之物。與已婚的女子對於家庭一樣。</p>
<p>從一個人早晨所吃的東西。就可以看得出他的品性他的職業。他的體格。以及他的國藉。甚而至於他的家庭狀况。</p>
<p>一個人越是愛好藝術他的領頭就越是低他的頭髮就越亂。他的私德就越是低落。揆之事實。十居八九。</p>
<p>一個男子見一個心愛的女子。决不會問他愛情的熱度可以維持多久。因爲一般的男子。以能得暫時的歡娱即爲巳足。</p>
<p>女性的虚榮。與他的心生在一起。假使你要打破他的虚榮。就會同時打破了他的心。</p>
<p>一個女子的心。可以深淺得像海洋與淺灘一般。然而那决不會淸澈地像春日的湖水一樣。</p>
<p>假使你要呌摩登的姑娘。常常在厨間裏往來的話。只有把他厨間搬在汽車裏或是美容院裏。</p>
<p>好的丈夫。和完美的戀人。是人爲而非天生。而女子自已即是那唯一的製造者。</p>
<p>一人品格之高下。輒以外界之誘惑物多寡以爲斷。</p>
<h3>故都旗人之生活</h3>
<p>— 程劍痕</p>
<p>北平旗人散居後城一带。爲數可數萬。當遜淸時。例得恩餉恩俸。故皆席豐履厚。不事生產。安坐而食。迨淸社旣屋。皇室解體。一般擁有巨資者。尙能量入爲出。度其優游之歲月。然此亦不過其中之一二。此外專恃恩餉者。則不免捉襟見肘。欲謀職業。又無一枝之長。故其生活。異常来困難。一般黠者知從前尊貴。已成過去徒擁虚名。勢必束手待斃。乃諱言旗籍。改充漢人。所用之性。以趙劉關張等爲多。詰以何必取斯數姓。則皆瞠目不能答。其殆熟讀三國志耶。一笑。此輩旣冒充漢人。則進一步與漢人聯婚。舊都在軍閥勢力時。南來服官者。大都未携眷屬。欲得性的安慰。輒多娶旗女以充妾媵。蓋旗人生活簡單。奢望不大。至漢人嫁之者。則屬罕見。殆又階級觀念使然也。國都南遷後。平地市面。頓形衰落。從前所倚爲衣食父母者。均已變成災官。自顧且不遑。更何論其他。因此竔人之生計。乃陷於絶境。迫不獲已。多以其女操神女生涯。然爲顧全體面計。又敢明目張膽。懸牌應徵。故游客之欲領略個中滋味者。未得漁郎引導。不易問津也。以上係就女子方面言。至男子則以淸室未亡時。長日無事。多以歌曲爲消遣。對於戲劇。頗有心得。袍笏登塲。尙能應付。梨園中遂爲其唯一出路。其中克享盛名者。頗不乏人。然亦限於諳練劇學之一部份。此外操賤業者。仍比比皆是。故旗人之生活。直可悲慘二字概括之。昔日王孫。頓成末路。亦大可哀已。</p>
<h3>蒙满花絮錄</h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>日本經濟家Okura氏。曾往内蒙。實地觀察。近主張於該地。建設大規模之畜牧制乳農場。因該地不宜耕種。但於畜牧。至爲適用。若以科學方法。畜養羊牛馬牲口等類。更以牛羊乳。制成奶油。罐頭食品。發售世界各國。獲利必大有可觀。近來日本各資本家。皆覺有利可圖。亦各於該地。覓得相當地點。開始建設小規模之農塲。此種事業。現已引起中國鬻俄方面注意。將來難免不發生糾紛。蓋實業運動之中。含有政治意味。近日道南鐵路附近各地。忽有多數日人。移居其間。已爲人所注目矣。</p>
<p>蒙满各地。素多盜賊。行旅視爲畏途。商家實業家等。裏足不前。近日中東路局。聘請精明幹練之偵探。訓練警犬於哈埠邊境之地。用以捕盜。甚爲得力。養犬者。則爲富有經練之俄人。現在最伶俐之犬。名「銳克司」更有一犬。勇猛異常。能越七尺高墻。尋常木梯。上下奔跑。輕快無比。爲英國警犬之一種云。</p>
<p>近日蒙满各地。大盜破案。被捕者甚多。皆警犬之工作也。前一星期。某氏有價值五千金之貂裘被竊。捕探携警犬至。當以該裘之包皮。使犬嗅之。該犬略一觸鼻。即奔至厨下。口噬厨役之衣。該厨役服務該氏已五年矣。平日誠實可靠。决無人疑其爲此盜案中之主要人。後經審問。得其實供。珠還合浦。宵小之輩。從此皆有戒心。對於地方治安。警犬實大有裨益。近來哈埠。奉天。吉林。各地之警務當道。皆甚注意於警犬云。</p>
<p>年來與李伯康可以分庭抗禮。旗鼓相當之蘇道說書。唯有朱蘭庵朱菊庵之弟兄雙擋。一則所唱之西廂記。亦屬絶無僅有。二則蘭庵之學問經騐。固遠非伯康所可及。三則二朱之說工及穿插。滑稽突梯。即景生情。大有謝少泉文狀元法乳。唱時之嗓音雖不若李嘹喨。而咬字正確。韻味極佳。且所做聽客。皆屬正當工商。及政學各界之上流男女。其號召魔力。非常恒遠。從無倐多忽少之病。近在得意樓樓下。彈唱巧姻緣。亦頭頭是道。與西廂異曲同工。祇此。已較伯康高出一頭地矣</p>
<p>東方書場之張少蟾趙稼秋。沈儉安薛筱卿等兩擋。藝術尙有足多。不過雙珠鳳珍珠塔書性太熟。故吸引力不能擴大兹聞該書場經理陳杏春君銳志振興。將書場戮力改良冀達盡善盡美地步。將邀許繼祥朱耀祥等加入。調去張趙沈薛等幾擋書性爛熟者。許之英烈。在滬已久。固已有相當地位。朱爲趙小卿弟子。素有出藍之譽。其擅長之後描金鳳後玉夔龍兩書。一時可冠　輩。會朱蘭庵菊庵西廂告竣。續說巧姻緣。預料此後之東方書場。或有一種新紀錄出見也。</p>
<h3>記虞美人之宴</h3>
<p>— 還吾</p>
<p>前晚友聯影片公司設宴於新新酒樓。係爲有聲片「虞美人」告成慶功。並爲工程師劉亮禪赴香港　行。到者五十餘人。濟濟一堂。極一時之盛。酒至半酣。趣事百出。而以雅號機關槍之陳少敏。最爲興商采烈。笑笑謔不倦。不啻槍放連珠。誠能名副其實也。徐琴芳之演說。出語雖不多。而文雅簡警。頗有含蓄不盡之妙。博得掌聲雷動。餘興本擬定友聯男女職演員之跳舞。及姜起鳳之口技等。後姜忽因故推却。未曾一獻其技。是爲可憾耳·是晚新進女主角胡萍。態度幽嫻。而最動人注意。及散筵。已近十二時矣。</p>
<h3>滑稽離婚案判决</h3>

<h3>三個時代（一三）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>（七）你是一個好人</p>
<p>有一天。張小三兒上東車站送客。只見月台上圍着一群人。擠上前一看。只見有兩個警士。用繩子拴着一男一女向外走。男的不認識。女的正是自已的媳婦兒張二嫂。不由心裏一怔。想了一想。就呌跟隨的馬弁。把一個警士呌過來。問是什麽犯人。警士道。「這女人不是好東西。是拉車的張小三兒的媳婦。他背了丈夫逃跑。跟一個姓王的聽差過了幾年。現在他又丢下姓王的。跟了姓范的跑。我們在站上看他兩人鬼頭鬼腦。情形可疑。一盤就盤問出來了。這樣傷風敗俗的事。我們自然要辦他。師長。您有什麽命令。」張小三兒笑道。「對了。我在那裏看見過你。想不起來你從前在農商部站過崗嗎。」警士道。「站過崗的。」張小三兒笑道。「老公事了。你巡警當的年數不少了。怎麽不往上升一升呢。」警士道。「我太老實了。不會伺候上司師長提拔提拔罷。」張小三兒道。「好。我提拔你。我現時就住在農商部街。你去找我。也許我能給你想點法子。你把這一對狗種送到警察廳去。你就可以來見我。」警士答應一個「是。」行着禮走了。兩個鐘頭以後。這警士到張公館裏來見張師長。張小三兒第一句便笑道。「你認得我嗎。」警士立着正道。「是。張師長。」張小三笑道。「大概你不認得我了。你在農商部街揍過我。」警士嚇了一跳。張小三兒道。「不要緊。我也揍過你。你在車站上。把那一男一女逮着了。我謝謝你。雖然你有點管閑事。這閑事管得好。」警士道。「師長。警士不管閑事。這樣傷風敗俗的人。在警察的責任上。是應當逮他們的。」張小三兒哈哈笑道。「有趣。你還没有忘了你那一套。你逮着他們。有什麽好處没有。」警士道。「這不過我們責任上的事。没有什麽好處。要不。我們一個月拿幾塊錢的薪水。幹什麽的。」張小三道。「没有好處。你逮他們作什麽。」警士道。「師長。這是我們責任上的事。」張小三兒皺着眉道。「你别談什麽責任。我不懂这個。你說個警喻我聽。究竟怎麽回事。」警士道。「是。我們是爲社會……不。警如說罷。這個張二嫂。背了他丈夫逃走。我們把他逮着。替他丈夫出了氣。他丈夫願意收回去。夫妻團圓……」張小三兒道。「哼。他丈夫决不能那樣不害臊。」警士道。「是。他丈夫不收回去。若是要告他的話「法庭上可以辦他的罪。這樣一來。有那些不學好的娘們。就不敢胡作非爲了。所以我們拿了百姓的錢。還是替百姓辦了事。」張小三兒道。「對了。傷風敗俗的事。總得管。我現在明白了。你是一個好人。我和你總監說。保你升巡長。」</p>

<h3>中國象牙雕刻業之進展</h3>
<p>美國商務專員有詳細紀錄　象牙觀音像關係中國文化</p>
<p>美女士李汀氏發表象牙統計一文、述我國象牙貿易之發展、頗有趣味、照錄如左</p>
<p>中國爲象牙美術品原料主要出產國之一、而關於象牙之紀述頗少、欲求象牙贸易之準確數字、頗爲不易兹篇所記、係就由華運往美國之象牙而言、其數字均直接取諸美國駐華商務員之正式調查、至普通關於象牙之事實、祗有兩種來源可資依據、一爲美國婦女俱樂部所刋布之千白爾夫人所著」象牙雕刻「一文、一爲詩家谷博物院所刋勞福氏之」象牙在中國「一書、</p>
<p>一九二九—三○年中國年鑑中述及象牙、並記有象牙器物之進口稅率、據云係依其價值征百分之廿七半、又載、在一九二五年、輸入中國之象牙（來自蒙古或印度）計四萬三千六百七十斤、總值關銀十七萬七千二百五十七兩、一九二六年輸入大增、計達六萬零一百七十八斤、關銀二十四萬三千八百七十二兩、一九二七年輸入驟減少、殆因中國内亂、對於象牙之要求減削（至少在外僑方面爲然）、計輸入祇三萬六千九百七十三斤、十五萬一千二百七十六兩、</p>
<p>一九二九—三○年中國年鑑中顯示一有味之事實、即在一九二五至一九二七之三年中、未有象牙由中國輸出、此類因已雕刻之象牙器物不列入」象牙「一類之内、而列入」美術品「之共同門類故也、</p>
<p>據美國駐華商務員之紀錄、一九二九年廣州對美國輸出象牙、值美金四千八百八十九元、次年則減至三千二百八十二元、</p>
<p>上海一埠有製象牙器及骨器之店一百十家、其中十成之九專製象牙器、此美店舖及工塲多聚於城皇廟附近一带、内有一家每年可做六七萬元之生意、在興盛之年、則可達十萬元、</p>
<p>象牙在上海進口時、每件約長五呎至八呎、幼象之牙色微黄、老象之牙色白而微灰、又有一種海馬之牙、則爲灰色、與象牙極易辨别、</p>
<p>在上海象牙市價、隨供求而異、與其他商品同、但平均每擔約從六百兩至八百五十兩、今冬因銀價跌落象牙價頗漲、輸入上海一埠之象牙數量及價值、依年次列表如左、</p>
<p>數量　　　　斤　價值　　　　兩</p>
<p>一九二四　二二、二二八　九七、三七五</p>
<p>二五　　　二一、九五九　一○二、九七一</p>

<p>二七　　　一○、一○六　四一、一七六</p>
<p>二八　　　二五、八五八　一一五、○四二</p>
<p>象牙製成器物後、其總重量當然與進口時不同、因雕刻時有碎屑之損失、每十六斤約損失九兩、至土　之象牙輸出、一九二二年爲五百九十七斤、總值美金五千四百七十六元、（此爲最近中國年鑑所未載、）</p>
<p>雕刻象牙、必具有熟練之技術、而中國雕工之工資殊廉、就上海而論、象牙筷（平凡不雕刻者）每十雙祇得工資華銀三角九分、平凡之烟匣、每只工資祗有七分、圖章每塊工資六分、</p>

<h3>開夜車</h3>
<p>— 征鴻</p>
<p>宿舍裏的人聲、漸漸靜下去了、電燈也熄了、在這靜寂之中、過了好一會、我們這一間、新生活又開始了、一班開夜車的同志、已振起精神、忙着活動了、有二位各自照着電商、躺在牀上看課本、有二位烯着一枝洋燭、索性坐向桌邊、一頭抄着、一頭念着、横豎知道舍監是不會來的了、儘管任意做去罷、</p>
<p>好們不惜一夜的不睡、實在也是不得不這樣、因爲這次大考、簡直有關於升級留級的問題、原來有幾種功課、平日差不多是没有考試的、但是大考却不能免、而分數的决定、也全靠這一着了、那末若不用這一夜的工夫、來預備半年之所敎、明天考試、如何對付呢、實在的、假使不這樣預備、簡直可以交白卷、假使預備了、考得成績非常好也說不定、雖然後天成者所預備的一齊忘掉了、横豎只要明天考得出就好了、想到留級的危險、想到下學期重考的麻煩、這一夜的不睡、那裏能顧惜得到呢、而且、考完了、可以一連睡幾天、以爲補償、</p>
<p>慘淡的燭光、在室中畫出可怕的陰影、而坐在桌邊的二位的形容、在這昏黄的光中、更顯得憔悴委頓極了、無神的眼睛、勉强支撑起來的頭、加着一種悉苦的表情、看上去、她們簡直像大病初愈、又像將生大病的樣子、眞的、呌人怎麽能相信、這二位就是平日活潑快樂的同學呢、</p>
<p>一個同學牀邊的閙鐘、滴滴地單調地響着、時間一分一秒的過去、坐在桌邊的二位、在預備中、不時發出詛咒學校、怨恨先生的說话、她們的面上、憤怒一層層在增加、一位慘白得可憐、一位緋紅得可怕、躺在牀上預備的同學、一位已不自知的睡着了、書掉在地下、大約她睡着時、把電筒一推、所以那電筒已轉過身來、光完全照射在她臉上、顯出一張張開的嘴從嘴中常常發出嘆息似的哼聲、忽然、」哎呀、不業了，……「一聲驚咸、她突然的從睡夢中坐起來了、眼睛慢慢的張開、看一看坐在桌邊的二位、從地上拾起書來、嘆了一口氣、從新躺下、繼續預備去、坐在桌邊的二位、對好這不十分響的驚喊、好像聽見又好像不曾聽的樣子、見也對她看了一眼、這喊聲却驚醒了睡在近門的牀上的一位同學、她是好好的睡着的、本没有開夜車、便不免埋怨起來、喃喃的說了幾句、又糊裏糊塗的睡着了、但以後睡却睡不穩了、不時無故的驚醒、後來一聲嘆氣、她爬起來了、在室中來回走了幾國、重行躺下、坐在桌邊的二位同學、微微以驚奇的眼光看着她、原來她本是善於酣睡的、大聲也喊不醒她、今夜却輕微的驚喊、就把她驚醒了、而且醒後又睡不穩起來、大約這幾天她精神衰弱、所以神經也就過敏了、</p>
<p>窗外漸漸的發白了、洋燭也已燃去不少、坐在桌邊的一位、已伏在桌上睡着了、那一位眼睛紅紅　的、直瞪瞪不知在望些什麽、還是呆呆的坐着、忽然睡在近門的那位、霍的從牀上起來了、走到桌邊說、我忽然在夢中記起了、日間還有二節漏去、没有預備、現在讓我來罷、你們二位疲倦已極、還是去睡一回、等到應起身的時候、我再來喊你們、於是她把睡着的那位、且喊且推、弄醒了、呌她跟那一位一同睡了、然後她在殘燭的光裏、坐向桌邊、翻開書來、輕輕的念着、</p>
<h3>一小時的訓話</h3>
<p>— 澄</p>
<p>我和瑛緩緩的正在走廊裏走着、任</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>意地談着的時候、忽然訓育主任曼先生、從辦事室出來、拿手招着我們、迎上幾步說、「你們這一點鐘没有課了、因爲畫圖敎師沈先生事假、現在、你們二位去對你全級同學說一聲、敎他們不要走散、我有幾句話和你們談、</p>
<p>我們應命的立刻跑進敎室、把曼先生的分付說了一遍、那此同學、有的喜形於色、有的咕噥着、「誰要這流漫的曼先生談話、不然、不昨奶好的一小時、又可給我們批閱些小說了嗎、」而還有兩個值日生、和兩個級長、都急急離開了坐位、棄了他們自已的工作、來掃地·揩黑板·抺講臺…了、</p>
<p>上課的鈴聲一響、曼先生微笑着進來了、正級長首先起立、對我們作了一個手勢、我們都理會的意思、連忙立直了身、恭而敬之的對曼先生鞠了一躬、在平時别的先生授課的時候、我們都不起立的、而且、如果遇到一個和善些的先生、我們非但不起立了對他鞠躬、我們時時會裝做没有看見他已進來了、最可笑的、有些同學、有時竟連敎的書本都不拿出來、</p>
<p>「這是很好的一個時機、我得和諸位同學談一小時的话、我候了已幾星期了、好容易的今天被我候着了、」曼先生站在講臺的一邊、兩手放在背後、笑容可掬的說着、他是很美麗的、雖算不得是絶世的美人、但他的風雅的談吐、和活潑而瀟灑而端莊的態度、都足以使我們敬愛他有餘、</p>
<p>「現在我所講的、就是關於你們平時來來往往的情書太多了、在别的嚴厲些的學校、非但來往的情書要没收、而且還要扣分的、我因爲不忍這樣的太固執、太無理性、所以很融通的照例把一切你們靑年學子所不應該瞧的情書、在檢閱後仍發還你們、而用懇切的言詞、來勸誡你們、可是頑皮的你們、見我不扣分、也不十分的責備你們、竟老着臉儘讓我一次二次三次的勸誡你們、而你們仍儘自無拘無束的繼續着、我現在很正式的告訴你們、如其下次我再檢着了這種的信、我必要没收、而且扣分的、你們應該知道、現在的你們、尙在求學時期、若不靜心的勤奮的求學、將來在社會上、即使謀得了一站身地、你們也定要感到種種知識的缺乏、不信、我舉例給你們聽、我有幾個同學、他們在讀書的時候、差不多也很輕視讀書的、他們時時說「現在的社會、都是要鑽營謟媚他人、趨奉他人、方可謀到一好些的地位、學識經騐、憑你們怎樣豐富、怎樣充足、都是無用的、」所以他們都很消極的、從不肯用心的研究一會書、平時、他們不是寫信、便是看電影·請客·閒談、種種闌珊的行動、但是現在他們已勉强的在社會上辦事了、而也就是在這時、他們學悟了、而且也懊悔了他們以前的錯誤、所以在公餘之暇、他們時時的手不釋卷、靜靜地研究着、有幾個經濟稍寬裕些的、還請了先生補壞、故你們不知道則已、知道了就應該改、以後我希望你們少寫些、同時也少讀些那無價值的情書、免得浪費寳貴的有限的求學時代的光陰、不然、我相信你們將來在社會上辦事時、也定要後悔的、你們大概都知道這句吧、「少壯不努力、老大徒傷悲」、我很虔誠的很眞切的祈禱這句話、不要是像對你們說的、他說到這裏、突然的停了、閃閃的眼光、很嚴厲又很和善的射到我們臉上、一時聽得出神的我們、連忙把昻高着的頭、急急低下來、那時、我猜想各人的心中、大概都已縐起了幾些微波吧、</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>爲巡視法蘭特形勢起見、我在阿伯費會見成爾遜將軍及米爾納假爵之後、即往布倫台斯格英國第二軍司令部、十六日晚上、在加塞爾相近的加潑爾地方遇見布勒美將軍、時在夜間、我們的燈光完全熄滅、我們的四圍砲聲隆隆、敵人在法蘭特的攻撃又緊張了、我在此裏也遇着法國第二騎兵團司令勞皮育將軍、以及狄鐵格上校、他是我前派來調查英軍可供調用的兵力的、在十點鐘、我們同布勒美將軍回到布倫特斯格他的司令部、打電話通知在沙格斯我的司令部的魏根將軍、命令第三十四師次日用汽車開到斯丁渥特、</p>
<p>十七日晨、同英國參謀部長威爾遜少將會議、他對此贊成海格總指揮及布勒美將軍主張、英國參謀部建議法蘭特的聯軍應相繼向愛爾到聖亞美及佛爾内的水防綫撤退、我反對這種計劃、海格總指揮早已考慮到放棄以至毀滅但基充港口、我對此却不能同他一樣的担憂、</p>
<p>我的主張目下唯有固守我軍的防綫、到必要的時候、調用法國後備軍以及利用比國的兵力、十七日、我遇見比王及比軍參謀長的時候、我提出同樣的意見、在離開布倫特斯格回到沙格斯之前、我並且在十八日根據此意訓令布勒美將軍、幾小時後、我根據這種片法、寫信給紀倫少將及海格總指揮、因我很願把比軍及英國第二軍在這形勢下作戰的步驟再同他們說明、後來我把守勢戰應遵循的大綱曉喻聯軍、也是根據此點發揮的、</p>
<p>法蘭特實不能再有寸地拱手讓人了、克末爾山離但基克不過二十五哩、那山控制直達但基克城的全部平原、倘使敵人在那裏架起重砲、他便足以撃毀我軍的抵抗、所向無敵的直逼但基克港口、換言之、他便足以直達海峽海岸兩危害我軍與英國的交通、同時可把全部比軍陷入險境、</p>
<p>然而我終究未能阻止頁普爾突出的英軍防綫在四月二十七日向後退到但基克城下、而比軍防綫亦被牽動撤退到頁坡萊運河、</p>
<p>二十七日午後、我再向北出發、我首先到布倫特斯格看布勒美將軍、再到意斯格倍克看米脫里將軍、我告訴他們形勢嚴重、並且把現狀所須要的防守根本原則向他們解釋、更向他們鄭重說明援軍一到、務必即令開入火綫參戰、</p>
<p>從四月十七日到二十日、敵軍加緊向法蘭特山南面的聯軍防綫進攻、大受挫折、然而德人固受巨創、英軍的損失亦屬不資、海格總指揮四月十八日的一封信裏曾述及損失的範圍、幸而别的備後隊即可調到維持戰局、這便是法國後備隊、</p>
<p>第三十四師已在四月十七日向前開拔、十八日第一百五十四師及第三十九師調到前方、第二十七師在二十三日、開到、這幾師後備軍集齊之後、編成」此間的支隊、「由米特里將軍指揮、這支法軍、步兵五師及騎兵三師、從经軍防綫佈置到頁普爾之北、英國第二軍因得從大戰裏撤退七師十六旅之衆、</p>
<p>然而敵人如其再接再厲的攻撃、吾人尙須再調幾師法軍到法蘭特、我因令第十軍速把其先頭步隊第十六軍團（三十一及三十二師）前進到奥興丕爾内綫、一面繼續完成其援助阿拉斯區域的任務、一面須準備引兵參加肯布林倍塞爾羅倍克前敵的戰事、同時第五軍的四十六及四十七師隨後開到費邑布加治、</p>
<p>法國後備軍因此發生向北展開的總調動、其動機凡三、援助法蘭特的英軍、必要時在阿拉斯區域與英軍共同作戰、及準備參加沙姆沙戰事、</p>
<p>最後兩方面的危險仍舊存在、衝突隨時可以重新爆發、根據法軍參謀部的計算、敵軍仍有六十師之衆可以再度嘗試撃散英法兩軍的連絡、他至今没有成功、</p>
<p>沙姆河之南、前敵戰事比較的岑寂了三星期、但在四月二十三日警訊突至、敵軍八師之衆、乘着大霧的掩護、又大舉進攻了、從英國第四年手裏奪着了費邑布勒頓拿、又從法國第一軍手裏奪着亨果、一直攻到加喜近郊、</p>
<p>敵軍的勢力擴展到費邑布勒頓拿、對我軍十分不利、敵人因此得着了瞭望台及砲位、可以憑藉優越的地位砲撃我軍、以至佔領亞眠、換言之、敵便足以沿着沙姆河之綫、實行其計劃、截斷聯軍的交通、甚至截斷聯軍的聯絡、</p>
<p>費邑布勒頓拿是一塊很大的地方、倘使敵人得以從容佈置、即能成爲戰略上大有價值的要邑、所以無論如何、我軍應用全力即刻奪回其地、</p>
<p>我因在警訊傳到後、即令羅林生將軍準備奪回費邑布勒頓拿、其地於我軍有唇亡齒寒的關係、並約狄明尼將軍舉行反攻、羅林生將軍對此主張十分贊成、</p>
<p>二十四及二十五夜、澳軍擔任反攻、攻下了高地及村落、法國第一軍的摩洛哥師擔任右翼、克復了亨果北面一带地方、狄明尼將軍着着前進、鞏固恢復的陣地、福悅將軍同時猶兵兩師北進、以備參加沙姆河及魯斯河之間的戰事、</p>
<p>右翼的英國後備軍已在費邑布勒頓拿附近交戰、又受巨大的損失、海格總指揮在二十四晚上呌我注意這點、我給他满意的答覆道、法國後備隊準備援助、及法國第一軍决定瓜代羅林生將軍的右翼英國第三軍團、（未完）</p>

<h3>The Panchen Lama to Comfort the Western Borderlands</h3>

In Qinghai and Xikang, he can choose a location to organize the Envoy's Office and allocate 15,000 yuan per month for expenses. As for returning to Tibet, because the time is not yet ripe, there is no concrete plan. Because the Panchen Lama cannot endure the intense heat and the Mongolian princes have repeatedly telegraphed to welcome him, it has been decided that he will leave Beijing for Peiping on July 1st to visit Deputy Commander Zhang's illness.

<h3>The US Announces a One-Year Moratorium on War Debt and Reparations</h3>
<p>The US President issued a declaration. It allows a one-year moratorium on international debts and reparations. Although it does not meet the expectations of Europe to cancel and reduce the debts, this one-year moratorium period allows for calm discussions. Who knows if further progress can be made in the future? Therefore, today's declaration by the US President has won the sympathy of most European countries, and Germany especially welcomes it. This is truly a prelude to friendly relations between Europe and the United States, and also a motivation for the world's economic recovery.</p>
<p>The US President's declaration claims to be a wise and timely move. This is not an empty phrase. Since the world economy was swept into a recession, the two results of falling prices and rising currency have placed an excessive burden on debtor countries. There is indeed a situation of inability to repay. If the agreement must be insisted on and forced to pay, it is tantamount to forcing them into bankruptcy. It will inevitably increase the resentment of debtor countries. On the one hand, for the sake of the United States itself, in order to develop American commerce, it is necessary to cultivate the purchasing power of European countries. European countries, under this difficult situation, want to fulfill their debts to the United States and at the same time have no power to purchase goods. This is also one of the reasons that leads to the stagnation of American commerce. Therefore, the United States' insistence on the agreement at this time is also detrimental to itself. Observing the United States' move from these two points, it is truly a wise move. We hope that during this one-year moratorium period, the United States and European countries can understand each other more deeply and achieve a final and satisfactory solution, which will greatly benefit world peace.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>Hoover Makes Suggestions to the World</p>
<h3>Suspension of Debt Payments for One Year</h3>
<p>Intended to alleviate the current European economic crisis</p>
<p>Debt deferral among other nations as a condition</p>
<p>War debts and reparations considered two distinct matters</p>
<p>Declaration against abolishing political debts</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 20th - President Hoover has announced a proposal to the world to suspend all government debt payments for one year. The US government is willing to postpone the payment of debts owed to the US by foreign governments that are due within one year from July 1st of this year, provided that it is approved by the US Congress and that all major creditor nations also postpone the payment of international debts for one year. The main purpose of this proposal is to give debtor governments time to restore their national prosperity. For their own benefit, the American people must be clear creditors and good neighbors. The purpose of suspending debt payments is to devote the next year to the recovery of the world economy and to prevent the recovery forces already underway in the United States from being hindered by external forces. He does not support the cancellation of debts owed to the US. Such a move would not improve world credit, and debtor nations have never suggested the cancellation of debts. However, the settlement of debts should be based on the debtor's ability to pay under normal circumstances. The United States, mindful of the current extraordinary state of the world, should adapt its own policies and principles. All government debts, reparations, and relief debts can be suspended, but debts owed by the government to private individuals are not included. When President Hoover announced his proposal, he also announced the names of twenty-one senators who supported it, including Borah, Glass, Morrow, Moses, Davis, and Reed. President Hoover also stated that the plan was endorsed by US Ambassadors to the UK, Dawes and Young. The President continued, stating that economic decline is also partly due to the burden of armaments. Although this action by the United States to suspend debt payments is not related to the land disarmament conference to be held next year, the United States hopes that this demonstration of helpful willingness will promote the goodwill necessary to resolve the major issue of disarmament. President Hoover also firmly stated that the US government still believes that reparations are unrelated to the debts owed to the US by the Allied nations. He said, "We have not participated in general reparations or the distribution of colonies and industries. The Allied nations' repayment of debts to the US for war and reconstruction purposes is not based on German reparations or related items. Therefore, reparations are purely a European issue and have nothing to do with us." US Ambassador to the UK, General Dawes, is currently in Chicago. It is said that President Hoover's proposal was announced after consultation with the leaders of both parties and represents the opinion of the United States. It is reported that the leaders of both parties are willing to fully support President Hoover, so there is no need to convene a special session of Congress to consider the proposal. The next session of Congress will be convened in December, at which time it will be submitted for approval. The war debt payment is due on December 15th.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, dated - The US President's proposal to defer war debts is intended to give the people of the world a respite from the heavy financial burden. It can greatly relieve Germany's urgent needs. Since the UK has deferred its debt to the US, it should allow the Germans to defer reparations. Therefore, this move is expected to promote the economic recovery of the entire world and is the most advanced step in the US's war debt and reparations policy. The detailed plan of the US President will probably be announced within the next week. Today's statement has greatly stimulated the New York Stock Exchange, and the prices of all securities have risen sharply. Prior to the announcement of this statement, US Treasury Secretary Mellon met with British Prime Minister MacDonald and the Governor of the Bank of England, and the US Ambassadors to Germany and France separately contacted the two governments to report secretly to the President. Domestically, the US President not only convened key figures from the Senate and House of Representatives and political leaders for detailed discussions but also had long conversations with the New York banking community. Furthermore, prior to today's announcement, the British Ambassador to the US visited the Undersecretary of the Treasury for discussions. Afterward, the Undersecretary of the Treasury immediately visited the President to report everything, which is enough to show the importance of the matter. It is expected that once the US President makes this proposal, Germany will demand a deferral of reparations or declare its inability to fulfill the conditions of the Young Plan. When the Young Plan was finalized in The Hague,</p>

<h3>Receiving Important Foreign Telegrams</h3>
<p>At that time, financiers from various countries knew that it contained a comical clause, which opened the way for modification. If Germany uses the two-year suspension privilege and then feels that its domestic economy is still in an unstable state, it can appeal to the advisory committee organized by the Bank for International Settlements to investigate Germany's ability to pay. At that time, if the investigation results are as the Germans say, the reparations conference may be reopened; otherwise, it will put Germany's relationship with the Allies in a difficult position. Germany's deferral of reparations can only be limited to the conditional part (that is, the modification of the Young Plan is also limited to this). This reparation is used by the Allies to repay war debts, so it is considered to be related to war debts. If Germany implements the deferral according to the Young Plan or even modifies it, war debts will inevitably be affected. This has always been the case with the Dawes and Young Plans. However, the United States has never admitted that a relationship exists between the two, and the US banking community will do its best to oppose reducing war debts. These two points are the key to the future issues of reparations and war debts, and that is why the US President's statement is so particularly solemn.</p>
<p>National, London, 20th - Today, London considers the US President's proposal to suspend all war debts for one year to be extremely important. According to an observer of current affairs, who is known for his accuracy, told the Associated Press that President Hoover's decision to provide a solution to the world's economic decline will have a significant impact on the overall settlement of financial matters since the European War. Before now, this settlement was considered to be completed, but since the US President made this proposal, it will inevitably re-ignite the issue of war debts and reparations. The reasons that Europe has always argued for have thus been clearly won, namely: (1) Europe has been arguing that the two issues of war debts and reparations are closely related, but the United States has always resolutely rejected this, and now it has for the first time formally acknowledged the interrelationship between the two; (2) The United States has finally acknowledged that war debts have a significant impact on the world economic situation; (3) The United States has for the first time acknowledged that war debts are slightly different in nature from ordinary commercial debts; (4) President Hoover's statement is sufficient to restore hope for the eventual cancellation of war debts. London regards this fourth point as particularly important. According to one person's opinion, even if President Hoover's proposal does not have an immediate impact on the economic world, it greatly changes the situation regarding Europe's war debts. It now appears that London has opened the way for international re-negotiation on the issues of war debts and reparations.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 20th - US President Hoover's recent statement that the United States is paying close attention to the economic situation of Europe and the Americas and is eager to find ways to provide relief is currently very welcome to the German people. The reason for President Hoover's statement is probably the result of US Treasury Secretary Mellon's observation during his recent visit to Europe. Mellon was alarmed by the perilous state of the German economy and deeply concerned that the instability of the German government would affect global commerce. As for the US's relief methods, there is still no definite report, but news from New York says that the steps taken by the United States are two: one is that the US Federal Reserve Bank will lend 330,000 marks to the German National Bank, and the other is that all European political loans owed to the US will be suspended. Among the two, the plan to suspend loans will take more time to prepare and must also be approved by the US Senate, so it is probably not as likely to succeed as the first plan. Furthermore, the London Daily Telegraph recently carried a message saying that Mellon recently declared in London that the United States requires the UK to join the group boycotting Russia as a prerequisite for discussing the revision of the loan plan. Because Soviet Russia currently exports large quantities of cheap wheat, the United States has to boycott it in order to protect its own farmers, so it especially hopes that the UK can join the international united boycott group. Furthermore, the US President recently announced that he is willing to allow European loans to be suspended for one year. This move by the United States is clearly a result of the temporary impulse of the current situation, and economic experts have not yet dared to comment rashly.</p>
<p>Reuter, Paris, 21st - The opinions of various newspapers here on President Hoover's proposal are complex. Some welcome it as timely, while others say that only by cancelling all debts can the US earn a good reputation. Le Matin concludes by saying that Germany must still pay the so-called unconditional reparations under the Young Plan, as the US President's proposal does not apply to non-commercial debts.</p>
<p>National, Rome, 21st - After US President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debts for one year was transmitted here, the masses were overjoyed, believing that the United States has acknowledged that the payments under the Young Plan are truly beyond Germany's economic capacity to bear. President Hoover did this because he knew that if Germany and other countries continue to suffer from economic oppression, it will lead to political and social unrest, turning into a dangerous situation, and its impact will eventually extend to the United States. Roman authorities and bankers said that President Hoover's proposal is the first effective and constructive step in the world's economic reorganization efforts. This move will have extremely important developments in the near future. Some say that President Hoover's proposal, in terms of the attitude of the European powers, its great influence is politically even more important than economically. When Hoover's proposal was announced, the US market was still in trading, so financiers here are watching to see the impact of this proposal on the world financial market on Monday.</p>

<h3>Investigation of Military Preparations in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence - After the Russo-Japanese War, the Treaty of Peace of September 1905 (Meiji 38) and the Sino-Japanese Supplementary Treaty of December of the same year were concluded. According to the treaties, Japan and Russia each stationed troops within 15 soldiers per kilometer along the Chinese Eastern Railway in Northeast China as guards. Therefore, after the Russo-Japanese War, Japan permanently stationed two divisions of field troops in the Northeast. In 1906 (Meiji 39), a railway guard unit was also established to specialize in railway security. Thus, the Japanese troops stationed in the Northeast had two types: divisions (also known as the Manchurian Garrison Army) and independent guard units. In addition, there were Japanese troops directly guarding the Kwantung Leased Territory, including the Lushun Fortress Command and a heavy artillery battalion, totaling more than 13,000 regular troops and more than 6,000 guards, for a total of about 20,000.</p>
<p>Land Military Preparations - The highest-level organization of the Japanese troops stationed in the Northeast is the Kwantung Army Headquarters. The stationed troops and military organs include the Lushun Fortress Command, the Garrison Division, the Independent Guard Units, the Lushun Heavy Artillery Unit, and the Kwantung Military Police, the Army Warehouse, the Garrison Hospital, etc. In addition, the Army Transportation Department has an office in Dalian.</p>
<p>Kwantung Army Headquarters - Initially, there was an Army Department within the Kwantung Government-General. The Governor-General was a specially appointed general of the army and was the head of civil and military affairs in the Kwantung Leased Territory. In April of the eighth year of the Republic (Taisho 8), the Governor-General system was abolished, and the Kwantung Government and the Kwantung Army Headquarters were established separately to take charge of civil and military affairs. The commander of the Kwantung Army was a specially appointed general of the army, directly subordinate to the Emperor of Japan, commanding the various units of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Northeast and the Kwantung Leased Territory and responsible for the defense of the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway lines. The Army Headquarters has departments such as the General Staff, Adjutant Department, Ordnance Department, Finance Department, Medical Department, Veterinary Department, and Legal Department. The Army Headquarters is located in Lushun. The Army Commander is General Takashi Hishikari, and the Chief of Staff is Major General Mitsuji Miyake.</p>
<p>Garrison Division - The Division Headquarters is located in Liaoyang and distributes its forces in places such as Changchun, Gongzhuling, Tieling, Shenyang, Liaoyang, Haicheng, and Lushun. The Division Commander is Heisaburo Matsui, the Commander of the 19th Brigade is Hamasaku Nakamura, and the Commander of the 30th Brigade is Kisaburo Ando. These troops are each formed into regimental gatherings for the convenience of operational tasks and training and education (that is, various troops are formed into regiments and reside in one place to facilitate training and strengthen military strength). The garrison division is replaced every two years with a division in the Japanese mainland. In the 20th year of the Republic, the term of the 16th Division expired, and it was planned to order the 2nd Division to come at the expiration of the term.

<p>Independent Guard Units - In September 1906 (Meiji 39), in order to guard the South Manchuria Railway, reservists who participated in the Russo-Japanese War were formed into six battalions of guards as a permanent arrangement. The forces were distributed in various places along the railway between Pulandian and Changchun and between Shenyang and Andong, specializing in railway security and protecting electric wires. In April 1909 (Meiji 42), an Independent Guard Unit Headquarters was established, with the headquarters located in Gongzhuling, commanding all guard units (six battalions). In June of the fifth year of the Republic, the reserve system was abolished and changed to the active duty system. In March of the twelfth year, as a result of military reduction, two battalions of guards were withdrawn. Therefore, there were only four battalions of railway guards at that time. On April 15 of the 18th year of the Republic (Showa 4), the peacetime organization of the army was revised, and two more battalions were added. Therefore, the current Japanese guard unit is still six battalions. The headquarters is still in Gongzhuling, and the troops are distributed in key areas along the South Manchuria Railway outside the Kwantung Leased Territory, directly taking on the task of railway security. The Commander of the Independent Guard Unit is Lieutenant General Ren Mori.</p>
<p>Lushun Fortress Command - The Commander of the Fortress is subordinate to the Kwantung Army Headquarters, responsible for the defense plan of the fortress, managing the weapons and materials of the fortress, and the construction of the fortress, and supplementing military supplies.</p>
<p>Kwantung Military Police - The headquarters of this unit is located in Lushun, and the various detachments and sub-detachments are located in various places along the railway line (detachments in Lushun, Dalian, Liaoyang, Shenyang, Tieling, Changchun, Andong, and sub-detachments in Liushutun, Dashiqiao, Yingkou, Haicheng, Fushun, Kaiyuan, Sipingjie, Gongzhuling, Lianshanguan). Under the command of the Army Commander, they perform military police duties. Under the command of the Kwantung Governor, they also manage all administrative and judicial police affairs.</p>
<p>Kwantung Army Warehouse - In charge of the storage, purchase, manufacture, and replenishment of provisions, clothing, engineering equipment, hygiene materials, and veterinary materials required by the various units of the Japanese Army stationed in the Northeast. The warehouse was originally located in Lushun, and branch warehouses were located in Dalian and Tieling. In December of the tenth year of the Republic (Taisho 10), the warehouse was moved to Dalian, and a branch warehouse was established in Tieling, with only an office in Lushun.</p>
<p>Garrison Hospital - Accepts army patients from various places, treats them, and keeps all hygiene materials. Soldiers and their dependents who fall ill during travel can also be admitted and treated by the hospital. Hospitals are located in Lushun, Liaoyang, and Tieling. They are also located in Liushutun, Dashiqiao, Haicheng, Shenyang, Gongzhuling, Changchun, Andong, and Lianshanguan. Garrison Prison - Military prisons should be located where military law conferences are held. The Japanese army has a garrison prison in Lushun.</p>
<p>Japanese military strength stationed in the Northeast, unit numbers, and garrisons: Headquarters of the 16th Division (Liaoyang), Headquarters of the 19th Brigade (Tieling), 9th Regiment (Changchun), 19th Regiment (Tieling), Headquarters of the 36th Brigade (Lushun), 38th Regiment (Shenyang), 53rd Regiment (Lushun), 20th Cavalry Regiment (Gongzhuling), 22nd Artillery Regiment (Haicheng), 16th Engineer Regiment (Liaoyang), 16th Transport Battalion (Liaoyang), Headquarters of the Independent Guard Unit (Gongzhuling), 1st Battalion (Gongzhuling), 2nd Battalion (Shenyang), 3rd Battalion (Dashiqiao), 4th Battalion (Lianshanguan), 5th Battalion (Sinuiju), 6th Battalion (Andong).</p>
<p>Naval Defense Preparations - After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan established a Naval Base in Lushun. On April 1 of the third year of the Republic (Taisho 3), the Naval Base was abolished and changed to an important port department. On December 1 of the eleventh year of the Republic (Taisho 11), the important port department was withdrawn, leaving only a defense unit. On April 1 of the 14th year of the Republic (Taisho 14), the defense department was also withdrawn. Currently, only naval attachés and a radio telegraph station are stationed. Because Lushun Port belongs to the Second Overseas Fleet's security area, the ships of the Second Overseas Fleet often dock in the port.</p>
<p>Within the Kwantung Leased Territory, Japanese residents have a conscription system. All men aged 18 to 45 are listed on the military register and can be assembled into an army at any time. As for the guard units, according to the Sino-Japanese Supplementary Treaty, Russia withdrew its guards on the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Japan should also withdraw. However, not only did they not withdraw, but they also conducted drills everywhere, often infringing on our sovereignty, causing disputes, which is not a blessing for the future of the two countries.

<h3>Guangdong Province's Interception of Customs Revenue Issue</h3>
<p>Situation of Martial Law in Shameen</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The most important financial matter currently underway in Guangdong Province is the recovery of the customs revenue from various customs houses. Tao Lüqian and Lu Jingke have been dispatched to negotiate with the Commissioner of Customs of the Guangdong Customs House several times. However, the Commissioner of Customs, Bo Le-de, insisted that he must receive an order from the Inspector General of Customs before he could comply. Therefore, the initial negotiation was unsuccessful. On the 10th, the authorities dispatched Xie Baoqiao and Lu Jingke, together with Zhou Baoheng, the Superintendent of Guangdong Customs, to take over the customs funds. It is said that the Commissioner of Guangdong Customs remained very firm in his attitude and had made preparations in advance, moving all customs funds, documents, and customs registers of the Guangdong Customs House into the Shameen concession. He also telegraphed a report to the Inspector General of Customs in Shanghai. According to Mei Lehe's reply telegram, he instructed that if necessary, the Guangdong Customs House should be moved to Kowloon in the British concession to continue collecting taxes as usual, in order to passively resist. However, because the Guangdong customs funds and documents were temporarily moved into the Shameen concession, Shameen has been under martial law for several days. It is said that on the 10th, several soldiers of a certain unit attempted to break into the Shameen concession but were interfered with by French soldiers. Later, the chief of the French police station came out to mediate and allowed them to enter. Therefore, the restrictions on Chinese entering Shameen have become stricter recently. Chinese employees in Shameen who hold special permits are allowed to enter and exit freely. Chinese who do not have duties to perform and who reside in the concession cannot stay for more than three days. Once discovered, they will be fined ten yuan and then expelled. Goods transported out of the concession must have a guarantee stamped by a foreign firm. Yesterday, the British side further dispatched two companies of British soldiers from Hong Kong to be stationed in the British barracks to cooperate with the French soldiers in guarding the area. At 9:00 PM at night, the east and west bridge gates of the British and French concessions were closed, prohibiting pedestrians from passing through. Additional sentries were deployed to patrol the riverside area, with extremely strict precautions. On the Guangdong Province side, this matter is not being taken to heart. On the 13th, thirteen special commissioners were dispatched to supervise the collection of customs revenue at various customs houses throughout the province. Dai Defu and Li Baoxiang were dispatched as supervisors to the Chao-Mei Customs; Wu Ru-kang and Wu Ru-jian to the Qionghai Customs; He Si-ming and Qu Ding-xin to the Beihai Customs; Xie Yi-zhong and Yang Bo-hou to the Wuzhou Customs; Huo Qifang to the Sanshui Customs; Pan Zuxin to the Jiangmen Customs; and Xie Baoqiao to the Kowloon and Gongbei Customs.

Otherwise, Lu may go to Lushan for a day or two of rest and then return to Jiujiang to welcome Chiang upon arrival. As for Minister He's headquarters, it has been moved into the First Vocational School in Huangdian for office, and the Baihuazhou Library has been vacated for Chiang's residence. It is reported that after Chiang arrives in the province, He will depart for the front to command the bandit suppression. (June 18)</p>
<h3>He Jian Telegraphs Report on Guangdong and Guangxi Situation</h3>
<p>Zhang Fakui's Troops Arrive in Pingle</p>
<p>Guangdong Simultaneously Attends to Northwest River Areas</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian yesterday received telegrams from Bai Huan, an investigator stationed in Yongzhou, and Cai Qizhang, the Magistrate of Linwu County, reporting in detail on the internal situation of Guangdong and Guangxi. After receiving the report, He Jian immediately forwarded it to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. The original telegram is as follows: (A) According to Bai Huan's telegram from Yongzhou to Xian, "1. According to the investigation in Pingle, in addition to the arrival of Zhang Fakui's rebel troops in Pingle, the troops of the Guangxi rebels Yang Tenghui and Liang Chaoji have also successively arrived, and are currently stationed in the area from Pingle to Shazi Street, busily raising funds and purchasing rice. However, the pontoon bridge at Banbiandu is repaired and destroyed repeatedly. 2. According to the investigation in Pingle and Gongcheng, after Zhang's troops arrived in Pingle, they suddenly stopped moving. Currently, five small steamships have arrived from the Fu River and Da River, and more than 100 civilian boats have been seized, indicating an intention to spy on Guangdong. 3. The main force of the Guangdong rebels is currently being transported by the Yuehan Railway, but they have not yet arrived in Shaozhou, and are currently stationed in sections along the line from Pajangkou, Yuantan, and Yingde, indicating a simultaneous focus on the Northwest River areas. The small number of troops stationed in Lechang and Nanxiong are taking a defensive posture against Hunan and Jiangxi. 4. Combining the above situation, it is clear that Guangdong and Guangxi are cooperating in name only, with Guangdong taking a strategy of seizing Ming, taking Xichuan, and secretly seizing Jingzhou, and preparing in advance." (B) According to Bai Huan's telegram from Yongzhou to Xiao, "1. According to reports, in addition to the instructor division currently stationed in Guilin, with approximately two regiments, no other troops have arrived. 2. It is rumored that there is internal conflict among the Guangdong rebels, with a portion opposing the pseudo-government, and the Guangxi rebels are dividing their forces to come to Guangdong to suppress them." (C) According to Cai Qizhang, the Magistrate of Linwu County, "1. Zhang Fakui's troops are unwilling to be incorporated into the Guangdong army, and it is said that they are still under the command of Li Zongren, with deep resentment. 2. The Guangdong military plan is still to take a defensive posture. 3. Guangdong is paying attention to the defense of the East and West Rivers, and the situation in the North River is calm, and the Hunan border is peaceful. 4. Zhu Weizhen's troops are still in Hepu. 5. Internal conflict in Guangdong is becoming increasingly apparent. Xu Chongzhi left in anger, and Zhang Gui claimed to be leaving Hunan to demand funds and weapons, which Guangdong refused to provide, and is afraid that he will enter Guangdong. As a result, Zhang Gui may enter Guangdong after all." The above three items are respectfully submitted by He Jian for review. (June 19)</p>

<p>Talks Regarding Guangdong Affairs</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Member of the Central Executive Committee Wu Tiecheng, because the Administrative Director of the Harbin Special District, Zhang Jinghui, will celebrate his sixtieth birthday on the 19th of this month, departed from Beijing on the 15th to congratulate him on behalf of General Chiang. When he passed through Tianjin on the 17th, he visited the Chairman of Hebei Province, Wang Shuchang, for a meeting. He then took the third train of the Beining Railway to Liaoning, arriving at the Shenyang South Manchuria Railway Station at 8:00 AM on the 18th, and disembarked. Few people knew about Wu's arrival in advance, so only the Deputy Director of the Beining Railway, Lao Mian, and the Assistant Manager of the Liaoning Traffic Bank, Li, greeted him. After getting off the train, he went to the Kaining Hotel to rest and have breakfast. Wu's secretaries, Xiao Tongzi and Zhang Zhenxi, also came with him. Wu's wife also accompanied him.

In the afternoon at 3:30 PM, he took the South Manchuria Railway train to Changchun, transferring to Harbin. After Wu arrived in Shenyang, the reporter immediately visited him. Wu said that this trip was for no important business, but to congratulate Chief Zhang Xuwu on his birthday. He will return to Shenyang the next day to participate in the third anniversary of Zhang Zuolin's death. After that, he will go to Ping to see Vice Commander Zhang's illness. He himself has been suffering from a cough recently and will not stay in Ping for long, but will go to Beidaihe for summer vacation to rest. The reporter asked whether Hu Hanmin and Li Jishen would soon take up the positions of National Committee members. He replied that the Central Government earnestly hoped that Mr. Hu would soon share the important task of the Party and the country. Hu had already agreed to take up the position of National Committee member, but because his health had not fully recovered, he would first go to the United States for recuperation, which had been approved by the Central Government, and hoped that he would return soon to assist in national affairs. He did not clearly know whether Li Jishen would take up the position of National Committee member. Since Zhang Puquan went to Guangdong to convey the intentions of the Central Government, the hope for peace has increased. The Central Government is determined to pursue peace to the end and concentrate all its efforts on suppressing the Communists. General Chiang will go to Jiangxi soon, and the comrades in Guangdong are also very eager for peace and recognize that the Central Government's all-out effort to suppress the Communists is the most urgent task. As for the peaceful solution, it is currently under discussion. (June 18)</p>
<h3>Three Major Specialties of the Anfeng Railway Line</h3>
<p>Tussah Silk, Yellow Tobacco, and Paddy Fields</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: Although the Anfeng Railway line and the Yalu River coast are deep in the mountains and forests, with barren soil, and cannot be compared to the fertile fields of the interior, the eastern section of the Anfeng Railway has a suitable climate. Moreover, because the railway runs through it, directly connecting Manchuria and Korea, transportation is convenient. Therefore, the three major specialties of the eastern border, such as tussah silk, yellow tobacco, and paddy fields, have developed year by year, surpassing the interior and becoming a major source of income in the newly developed eastern border. The situation in the Fengcheng area in the eastern section of the Anfeng Railway is investigated as follows: (1) Tussah Silk: The southern part of Fengcheng County has rivers running crisscross, suitable for planting rice. The northern part has overlapping mountains and ridges, suitable for raising tussah silkworms. The central part has fertile soil, most suitable for planting yellow tobacco. Therefore, the three major specialties have developed very rapidly. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the Fengtian Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau established a water conservancy sub-bureau in Fengcheng County and sent personnel to the countryside to encourage farmers to plant rice. At that time, most farmers did not know about water conservancy and were quite hesitant. Disputes often arose over ditching and water diversion. Later, the low-lying land that was unsuitable for cultivating other crops was converted to rice cultivation, gradually gaining substantial profits, and farmers began to imitate planting, so the paddy fields developed from this. As of the end of the nineteenth year, the paddy fields in the entire territory of Fengcheng had reached 34,700 mu. On average, each mu yields five dou of rice, with a total annual harvest of more than 520,500 shi. If officials and the people can work together to promote it, the development of paddy fields will be unlimited. (3) Tussah Silk: The entire territory of Fengcheng has 15,572 silkworm shears (each silkworm shear can raise 5,000 cocoon seeds, which is called a "shear," which is a common name among farmers. Farmers in the eastern province who raise silkworms all use this term). Silkworms are raised twice a year, in spring and autumn. Spring silkworms go up the mountain during Grain Rain and the cocoons are harvested in early summer. Autumn silkworms go up the mountain during midsummer and the cocoons are harvested during Cold Dew. Last year, in the spring and autumn seasons, a total of 500,000 "qian" were harvested. (Tussah silkworm transactions are based on 1,000 pieces as a unit. For example, 10,000 pieces are called "ten qian," not "ten thousand.") Because Fengcheng has no silk factory, the cocoons produced must be transported to Andong for sale, or silk merchants go to the area to buy them. (3) Yellow Tobacco: In the ninth year of the Republic of China, the Dalian South Manchuria Railway Company promoted the yellow tobacco industry and sent specialists to establish a yellow tobacco experimental farm at Fengcheng Station, purchasing American yellow tobacco seeds for trial planting. Because the soil and climate are suitable, the first year's trial planting was very successful. In the second year, the scope was expanded, and the South Manchuria Railway Company directly invested 500,000 yuan to create a yellow tobacco cooperative, recruiting people from China, Japan, and Korea who had experience in growing tobacco as cooperative members. At the beginning, Chinese people hesitated to join. The cooperative used profits to attract them, giving generous rents to landlords and lending money to Chinese people to encourage them to try growing yellow tobacco. Chinese people then joined in large numbers. After the autumn settlement, the profits were very high. In addition to repaying principal and interest, there were still some remaining profits. By the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the cooperative had a total of 115 Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cooperative members, growing a total of 600 "tian" of yellow tobacco (every six mu is one "tian"). Each mu yields about 50 catties. After the autumn harvest, all were handed over to the cooperative and resold to British, American, East Asian, and other tobacco companies. (The British American Tobacco Company, which produces Hardman cigarettes, has a factory in the capital of Liaoning Province, and its raw materials are supplied by the yellow tobacco of Fengcheng.) In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Fengcheng County Government, recognizing that the Japanese yellow tobacco cooperative had achieved effective results, also convened a meeting of gentry and merchants to create a tobacco industry association, which was unanimously supported and established immediately, promoting self-cultivation of yellow tobacco. Officials and people invested and joined in large numbers, with unusual enthusiasm. As of the autumn of the nineteenth year, the association had reached more than 100 members, growing a total of 500 "tian" of yellow tobacco. The yellow tobacco produced was sold to the British American Tobacco Company. The funds used by the tobacco industry association were advanced by the British American Tobacco Company. Only five years have passed since the establishment of the association, and it has already achieved such profits. The future development prospects are truly unlimited. (June 16)</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Orders Counties to Eradicate Opium Seedlings</h3>
<p>But Local Officials Still Levy Opium Tax</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The opium scourge in northern Anhui has been widespread for a long time. The opium prohibition has been lax for years and has not been cleared up. Unexpectedly, this year, the opium seedlings in Su, Si, Meng, Wo, Hao, Tai, Ying, Fu, and other counties are especially numerous, and the reason is that the officials levy opium tax, which is all the rage. The district party headquarters here has reported to the provincial party headquarters and asked the provincial government to order the counties in northern Anhui to effectively clear up opium. Those who violate the order will be punished. After the provincial government approved the letter, it recently issued instructions to the county magistrates of the aforementioned counties, stating: "The letter No. 3626 from the Anhui Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee has been approved. The Bengbu District Party Affairs Reorganization Committee reported that it requested the provincial government to order the counties in northern Anhui to effectively clear up opium and punish those who violate the order. Opium is an extremely harmful substance, and the counties in Anhui have suffered from it for more than a year. Since the National Government issued a general ban on opium, we expected to clear up the poisonous plants and eliminate the source of the scourge forever. However, according to reports, the counties in northern Anhui are still levying opium tax from the people and privately collecting seedling tax. We are heartbroken and shocked to hear this. The county magistrates are officials under the rule of the Party, and should be honest and self-disciplined, and serve as the protector of the people. Unexpectedly, they dare to engage in corruption and oppress our people, violating the Premier's instructions to reject opium, which is truly unforgivable. In addition to sending letters to the party headquarters of the counties in northern Anhui, urging them to investigate and ban opium within a specified period, and expanding publicity so that the public is deeply aware of the harm of opium and is not deceived by corruption, we report the situation and request that the Council examine and approve it, and order strict prohibition by the provincial government to comply with the Party's teachings and benefit the people." Therefore, in addition to instructions and distribution, the county magistrates are immediately ordered to comply, conduct a thorough investigation, and strictly eradicate opium, without any slackness, lest they incur serious guilt. The investigation and eradication situation must be reported at any time. Sincerely ordered." (19th)</p>
<h3>Finance in Shandong After Abolishing Likin</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the abolition of likin in Shandong Province, the financial situation has been quite optimistic after active reorganization by the Department of Finance. According to what Weng Zhiquan, the chief secretary of the Department of Finance, said recently, it is quite detailed. After the Central Army recovered Jinan last year, Wang Xiangrong, the head of the Department of Finance, took office on September 9. At that time, the cash in the treasury was only three or four thousand yuan, while the accumulated debt for education and justice expenses amounted to one million six hundred thousand yuan. After investigation, it was found that the counties owed more than two million yuan in miscellaneous taxes during the tenure of the former head of the department, Yuan Jiapu. After repeated rectification, the financial revenue gradually improved. Now, the monthly revenue is two million yuan, and the expenditure is about one million five hundred and sixty thousand yuan. The revenue of last month is enough to cover the expenses of the next month plus ten days. As of the end of May, the surplus was seven or eight hundred thousand yuan. Because the education expenses are mostly relied on by poor scholars for living, and the justice expenses are related to the food supply of prisoners, the one million six hundred thousand yuan owed by the former head of the department, Yuan, for education and justice expenses last year has been repaid by eight hundred thousand yuan, and the remaining amount will be repaid as soon as possible to clear the debt. After the abolition of likin, the Central Government has provided funds of 1.234 million in total for four months, 200,000 each month, plus 200,000 at the end of the year, totaling one million yuan, which have already been remitted. The business tax is about to be implemented, and the financial future is very promising. At present, a universal collection and expenditure method is implemented. The funds within the budget must be paid in full, and no one is allowed to have the previous habit of deducting and using them separately. Fortunately, all the measures have been implemented as desired. All the preparations for the business tax have been completed, and the director's candidate will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Qingdao</p>
<h3>Disputes Between Chinese and Japanese Merchants in the Exchange</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Exchange is nominally jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese merchants, but all the major powers are controlled by the Japanese, which is nothing less than the only monopoly institution for Japanese merchants in Qingdao. Recently, Chinese and Japanese merchants in the Exchange suddenly had a dispute over trading issues, and then even resorted to violence, which is almost unprecedented in international trade. The incident originated from the Japanese firm Zhengsheng, which sold 1,100 tons of July-term rice on the Exchange in mid-May to a Chinese merchant at a price of nine yuan per hundred catties. The current price has risen to ten yuan and three jiao. The Japanese merchant was afraid that the price would continue to rise and inevitably suffer losses, so he deliberately made trouble and shouted in the market to sell July-term rice at nine yuan and three jiao. Many Chinese merchants then traded with him, and when they asked him to issue an order, he deliberately shirked responsibility. The Chinese merchants, seeing that he was deliberately disrupting the market price and repeatedly breaking his promise, immediately argued with him. He was stubborn and unreasonable, starting with verbal abuse and then resorting to violence. Later, with the efforts of the police and the Exchange staff, the situation was not expanded. However, all the native Chinese merchants, provoked by public outrage, withdrew from the Exchange from the next day and traded at the Qiyan Assembly Hall, specializing in spot goods and not ordering futures. The Exchange, because of the withdrawal of Chinese merchants and trading outside, was concerned about its reputation, so on the 18th of this month, at 4:00 PM, Chinese and Japanese members held a meeting to mediate. The Chinese members present were Liang Hepu, Zhang Litang, Qi Dechen, Shang Shuguan, Shou Huatang, and Zhang Junqing, while the Japanese members present were Mitsui, Donghe, Tailai, Mitsubishi, and Yoshizawa. The meeting discussed the mediation method. It was agreed that the Japanese firm Zhengsheng's two transactions of 1,100 tons of rice each were in violation of the Exchange's rules and should be fined 3% according to the regulations. The Japanese, knowing that they were wrong, were willing to admit the penalty for the first transaction of 1,100 tons, but for the second transaction of 1,100 tons, they argued that they had not paid the deposit or issued an order, hoping to evade responsibility. The Japanese members also defended them. However, because the Chinese side had sufficient reasons, the Japanese had no way out and finally requested that the second transaction be punished lightly. It is said that the Chinese merchants were also willing to agree. The dispute can now be expected to be resolved. (June 18)</p>
<p>Hunan Province</p>
<h3>Reason for Stoppage of Immigration to Jilin</h3>
<p>The Jilin Provincial Government Claims Inability to Provide Accommodation</p>
<p>The Ministry Orders the Railway Bureau Not to Transport</p>
<p>A Changsha dispatch states that the Hunan Provincial Relief Committee established a reclamation office in Yilan County, Jilin Province, and appointed Cao Ji as its director. It planned to transfer 1,000 disaster victims from Hunan for reclamation. The first batch of 500 disaster victims was scheduled to begin transportation on the 20th of this month. A grand immigration ceremony was planned for that day at the Provincial Relief Committee, inviting leaders from the party, government, and military to participate. Meanwhile, Yang Jichang was sent to Hankou, and Zhou Fengzao to Peiping and Harbin, to negotiate for free transportation by railcars and to take care of everything. Yang and Zhou departed several days ago. The luggage of all disaster victims has now been prepared for departure. At the same time, many small business owners have organized a "Northeast Immigration and Reclamation Hunan Small Business Investigation Group" intending to go along to operate industrial and commercial businesses. All sectors of Hunan society have expressed great sympathy for this and are preparing to see them off at the time of departure. Unexpectedly, the Jilin Provincial Government suddenly prevented the Hunan disaster victims from going, and the Xiang-E (Hunan-Hubei) Railway Bureau also received an order from the Ministry not to transport them. The telegram from the Ministry of Railways to the Hunan Provincial Government is recorded as follows: "Previously, your government's document No. 5626 regarding the transportation of 1,000 disaster victims from the Hunan Provincial Relief Committee to Yilan County, Jilin, for reclamation and requesting free transportation has been replied to by this Ministry in document No. 2777. Now, according to a telegram from the Northeast Transportation Committee, it has been found that regarding the Hunan Provincial Relief Committee's transfer of 1,000 disaster victims to Yilan County, Jilin, for reclamation, this committee, having no record to verify, telegraphed the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for instructions. The Northeast Political Affairs Committee replied that the Hunan immigration matter had been ordered to the Jilin Provincial Government for a quick investigation and response. The reply stated that because disaster victims from Henan Province had previously been ordered to be accommodated, Yilan County was instructed to investigate and respond, and it was reported that there was no land available for allocation and no way to accommodate them. The current situation with Hunan is the same, and it is difficult to immediately permit the transfer. Moreover, the number of refugees is large, their quality is uneven, and the people and land may not be suitable, which could lead to abuses. We should request a telegram to prevent them from going to avoid displacement. The various points mentioned by the provincial government are consistent with the actual situation. In addition to issuing instructions to approve them, this order instructs the association to investigate and handle accordingly, and to send a telegram to prevent them from proceeding, to avoid displacement. It has been found that since Yilan County, Jilin, has no way to accommodate the Hunan disaster victims, we should ask the Ministry of Transportation to quickly send a telegram to prevent them from coming north to avoid displacement. A corresponding telegram is sent in reply, requesting investigation and handling." Since the above situation has been reported, in addition to sending telegrams to the relevant county bureaus to investigate and handle accordingly, a corresponding telegram is sent to request your government to find a way to prevent them from going north, to avoid displacement. He Jian received the telegram and believed that the transfer of Hunan disaster victims to Yilan for reclamation had been preceded by the selection of reclaimed land there. Zhang Zuce from Hunan had also been operating industrial and commercial businesses there for a long time, and Hunan could accommodate more than 10,000 disaster victims. Zhang Zuce had personally come to Hunan and signed a reclamation contract with the Hunan Provincial Government. The Jilin Provincial Government's statement that there was no wasteland available for accommodation was a misunderstanding. He decided to reply to the Ministry of Railways with an explanation, requesting that the transfer still be permitted to provide relief to the disaster victims. (June 18)</p>

The family of Gu Genbo, a villager in Caobang Township, Xiaokunshan Township, more than ten li from the city, was suddenly attacked by more than ten kidnappers speaking a mixed dialect of local and Hakka voices the night before last. They broke into the house, rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and finding no valuable clothing, they did not get what they wanted. They tied up Gu's four sons and claimed they needed a ransom of 2,300 yuan. Gu's father, deeply loving his sons, pleaded in every possible way and finally collected 500 yuan to hand over before the four sons were released. The remaining 1,800 yuan was scheduled to be paid later. The kidnappers then left triumphantly.

He previously sublet vehicles on behalf of Xu Yaoqing, the owner of the Defeng Rickshaw Company next door. Last winter, he left Defeng and sublet rickshaws with Shuntai. The day before yesterday morning, Yu Zhongjiang had a quarrel with Xu Bixian, a vehicle releaser from Defeng. They wrestled each other to the派出所(branch police station) of the First Public Security Bureau. Because their words differed,巡長(patrol leader) Xu Yunsheng went to the scene to investigate and mediate. Unexpectedly, Dai Shunzhi (a native of the county who lives in front of the new temple in the city), Xu Huang (from Xuzhou), and another man, graduates of the Zhenjiang Police Officer School, wearing military uniforms, beat Yu San severely in the 派出所 because of a disagreement, causing him serious injuries.

After receiving the letter, Jiang and others forged an official document from the Civil Affairs Department and went to Zhu Ruixiang's home to extort money. They found opium lamps and tools, but Zhu's wife was very clever and sat on the chamber pot urinating and would not get up, so they could not take her away and could not extort money. Zhu's tenant farmer, A, had a quarrel with Jiang and others, followed by a fight. Villagers gathered after hearing the news and reported to the water patrol team stationed in the township, who arrested Jiang and others and brought them to the city.

Therefore, he was coveted by bandits. The other day at midnight, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived, broke down the door, and first captured and tortured the mistress, forcing her to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Then they ransacked the boxes and cabinets and left with their loot. After checking, the total loss was more than 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>A Meeting Is Held to Mediate a Dispute Over the Xiaonanhui Sandbar. Feng Meiyan, using the alias Yu Shengjie, from Xihuizui, Shaoxing, led more than 2,000 mu of school land on the Xiaonanhui sandbar in this county in lawsuits for more than five years. Up until this spring, fellow villagers Wang Yansong, He Wuliang, Liu Xiaotian, Zhong Jun, and Liu Jiean, Yao Jiafu, Zhu Yuntai, and Huang Langyuan in the county submitted a petition to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Beijing. The Shaoxing side sent representatives to the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai, requesting a way to mediate. The association, led by Deputy Chief Hu Xisheng, recently invited representatives from both sides to offer earnest advice and mutual concessions. They plan to divide the land into six parts for Yu and four parts for Shao.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Management Committee</h3>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We were very surprised to read in your newspaper about the explosion of the boiler of a Tianjin-Pukou passenger train. Upon investigation, on June 18, a northbound coal train of this line, with locomotive number 203, was traveling between Zhangbaling and Sanjie when the water inlet and steam pipe cover of the locomotive was blown off by steam, scalding the driver and fireman. Locomotive number 33 was dispatched to pull the train back to Zhangbaling. There was no explosion of the boiler of a passenger train. We believe that the news in your newspaper is inaccurate. We are writing to request that you investigate and correct the report. We hope for your prompt attention.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Management Committee</p>

<p>The Third Delegate Assembly of Shanghai County, which commenced on the 20th at the County Party Headquarters, held its second day of continued meetings yesterday. The morning session was dedicated to administrative work reports by the County Government and various bureaus. The presidium consisted of Jiang Yanqiu, Xu Pengcheng, and Niu Changlian. Starting at 1 PM in the afternoon, the assembly continued discussing proposals. A detailed account of the various events is recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees: Provincial Guiding Officer Chen Kanghe, Presidium members Jiang Yanqiu, Xu Pengcheng, and Niu Changlian, Delegates Zhang Yi, Jin Lemin, Huang Xingrang, Ding Borong, Li Youtian, Xu Pengcheng, Sun Jiafeng, Qiao Jiyuan, Zhang Jingye, Shen Hanqing, Wang Chengyao, Zhou Yuanliang, Kang Qiang, Jin Yongxin, Guo Xiangyuan, Peng Liren, Niu Changlian, Hu Naiwen, Shen Jing.

<p>Yan Shenyu Reports: County Magistrate and Public Safety Bureau Chief Yan Shenyu reported, stating, in brief, that today's agenda included administrative work reports from the County Government and various bureaus. Regarding an overview of past work, in addition to a detailed written report, he would provide a brief report on the progress of various tasks over the past year. The County Government's work on autonomy matters included four key initiatives underway: (1) Citizen Oath: Statistics on registered citizens who have taken the oath in various districts, townships, and towns show 2,521 individuals in the first district, 14,799 in the second district, 2,335 in the third district, 11,168 in the fourth district, 1,413 in the fifth district, and 699 in the sixth district. (2) Township and Town Elections: The first and sixth districts have already completed these elections, while other districts are working to complete them as soon as possible. (3) Household Census: Actively underway. (4) Personnel Registration: He hoped that the heads of various townships and towns would dedicate their efforts to achieve perfection and thoroughness. Regarding the work of cleaning up the countryside, including (1) household registration, (2) collective guarantees, (3) inspection of firearms, (4) inspection of ships, (5) reorganization of the defense corps, and (6) armed patrols, all these tasks were being implemented effectively and systematically. He also provided a supplementary report on public safety administration, stating, in brief, that the county's public safety funds were originally designated from house taxes, which relied heavily on revenues from the urban area. After the separation of the county and city, the urban area fell under the city's jurisdiction, and the county's public safety funds were completely depleted. During the provincial and municipal division of governance conference, the situation was considered, and it was resolved to allocate 3,921 yuan per month from the city to the county's funds, according to the original budget. This was implemented accordingly. However, due to disputes over fund allocations between the province and the city, the municipal government suspended the subsidy in June of the 18th year. Starting from July of the previous year, the municipal government allowed a monthly allocation of half the amount. From April of this year, the municipal government has been able to allocate public safety funds as planned, which allows them to barely maintain operations. However, the total accumulated arrears amounted to approximately 17,000 yuan, making distribution a difficult issue. Regarding the rectification plan: (1) reducing the administrative expenses of the main bureau, (2) establishing a branch bureau in each district, (3) supplementing the required number of patrol officers with the dismissed members of the defense corps, and (4) supplementing firearms and uniforms. Detailed plans for all of these have been carefully prepared and submitted to the province for approval. The organization of the defense corps and the training of police officers are also being actively prepared, and so on.</p>
<p>Wang Li Reports: County Finance Bureau Chief Wang Li reported that Shanghai County's finances are quite limited, so local funds depend on provincial subsidies. The Finance Bureau's main tasks for the 19th year can be divided into (1) handling collection matters, (2) handling miscellaneous tax matters, (3) handling land registration matters, (4) handling public bond solicitation matters, (5) handling business tax matters, and (6) collecting local funds. He also hoped that all delegates would cooperate in assisting with local collection matters.</p>

<p>County Finance Bureau Urges Business Owners to Pay Supplementary Grain Tax</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Urges Business Owners to Pay Supplementary Grain Tax</h3>
<p>The Finance Bureau of Shanghai County Government previously received an order from the Finance Department of the Provincial Government of Jiangsu to investigate and process the case of Jiangsu Province's supplementary grain tax for land with no grain or barren land, with a deadline of six months for completion. Because business owners were observing and not reporting, Bureau Chief Wang Li has formulated an active plan, requiring all owners, regardless of whether the land is ripe or not, to come to the Bureau to report themselves within one month. Failure to report within the deadline will be regarded as the business owner abandoning property rights, and tenant farmers will be allowed to report and receive the land, with certification from the village scribe, pay the price according to regulations, and be issued an official deed to manage the property. Yesterday, the Finance Bureau notified each scribe to inform each business owner to report quickly and not to wait and delay themselves. Therefore, each business owner rushed to the Finance Bureau to report and pay the supplementary grain tax to protect their property rights.</p>
<p>French Concession Taxpayers' Association</p>
<h3>Notice on Implementing the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The French Concession Taxpayers' Association issued a notice yesterday to residents of the concession, advising them to implement the new system of weights and measures. The notice states: "Regarding the promotion of the new system of weights and measures in this city, this Bureau has repeatedly convened meetings with the authorities of the Special District for coordination and discussion, and has also sent personnel to attend. The deadline for completing the unification by July 1 of this year is approaching. Each vegetable market has been scheduled to first implement the new system starting from June 1. The Special District is related to the observation of both Chinese and foreigners and should consistently promote it to establish a good reputation. Knowing that your association is the representative of the citizens, you are particularly enthusiastic about supervising the administration of the Special District and promoting improvements. We hereby send you this letter and hope that you will assist us in actively publicizing the necessity of unifying weights and measures, so that it can be completed on schedule. We will be very grateful." It is a need of the people since the founding of the Republic of China to unify the system of weights and measures. The National Government promulgated the Weights and Measures Law on February 16 of the 18th year for thorough unification and the Ministry of Industry stipulated that the implementation date for this city is on record. All people residing within the territory of the Republic of China should abide by and follow it. Those who violate this law will be punished according to law. As the old system of weights and measures has been legally abolished, anyone who uses it again is committing a criminal act. Therefore, we hereby notify residents of the concession that they should immediately comply with the new Weights and Measures Law, and all rulers, measuring containers, scales, etc., should be discarded and replaced with new ones as soon as possible. Legal rulers, measuring containers, scales, etc., can be purchased from the Weights and Measures Verification Office on Xieqiao Manufacturing Bureau Road. Please do not hesitate or delay to your own detriment. This is a notice.</p>
<p>Call for Payment</p>

If they are not submitted by this deadline, the previously submitted deposits will be transferred to the public account of the Customs. All merchants are hereby notified."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Liu Guozhan Talks About National Salvation Through Vocational Skills</h3>
<p>Welcoming Hu Hanmin to the United States</p>
<p>Hoping for Eternal Peace in the Country</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Guozhan, a member of the former Chinese United League who followed Sun Yat-sen in the Americas for revolutionary activities, has resigned from his position as Executive Committee Member of the Chinese Kuomintang General Branch in the United States due to his return to China to visit relatives. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. A reporter from the New Voice Society happened to meet him at his hotel yesterday and asked him about the feelings of overseas Chinese in the Americas regarding Mr. Hu Hanmin's trip to the United States and the recent situation in China. According to him, since Mr. Hu resigned, the Kuomintang General Branch in the Americas has sent telegrams to Beijing to retain him. Regarding Mr. Hu's convalescence in Nanjing and his resignation, more than a dozen telegrams have been exchanged between the Central Government and Mr. Hu himself. Overseas Chinese in the New World welcome Mr. Hu's trip to the United States. Before I left the United States, overseas Chinese even telegraphed Mr. Hu and the Central Government, urging him to go to the United States. However, Mr. Hu was unable to realize it at that time because his health had not yet recovered. Recently, it has been reported that Mr. Hu has recovered and that he himself has also expressed his intention to go to the United States, which may be realized in the future. As for the Guangdong Incident, when it first started, overseas Chinese in the Americas did not express much. Later, it was heard that the Guangdong side was actually in contact with Wang Jingwei and Zhang Fakui, and overseas Chinese in the Americas were quite displeased with this. Moreover, in view of the years of civil war, the use of force in the country is quite repulsive, so they hope for peace in the country and do not want any more wars. Furthermore, Member Lin Sen arrived in San Francisco on the 6th of this month, but I left the United States in May and did not meet Mr. Lin in San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Du Chongyuan Speaks on National Salvation Through Vocational Skills</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Skills Mutual Aid Society held its first lecture meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 PM at the Beiletang Hall of the Chinese Vocational Education Society. Mr. Du Chongyuan, a leading figure in the industrial circles of the Northeast and a representative of Liaoning at the National Conference, was invited to speak. The chairman of the society first reported on the organization and establishment of the society. Then, Mr. Du gave a speech entitled "National Salvation Through Vocational Skills," stating in brief that the success of young people in their careers should start with hard work and dedication. He was inspired by the success story of Japanese entrepreneur An'nosuke Zenshiro, who built his business from scratch. His success story is most worthy of emulation. Our country is under the economic invasion of the great powers. If we do not be practical and bury ourselves in our work, but only engage in empty talk, how can the country last long? He also cited Gandhi's adherence to the non-cooperation policy as evidence of working hard.</p>
<h3>Losses of the National Products Marketplace</h3>
<p>Under Review</p>
<p>It has been twelve days since the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered the closure of the National Products Marketplace. After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce convened both sides for talks in the past two days, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the National Products Marketplace have agreed to respond to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in writing today. The situation yesterday is recorded below: The Marketplace is proceeding. The National Products Marketplace yesterday proceeded with the negotiations as follows: (1) Regarding the Municipal Council's violation of the agreement and infringement on sovereignty, a request was submitted to the Municipal Government yesterday to lodge a protest. (2) Regarding the seven conditions determined by the Negotiation Committee, a request was also submitted to the Municipal Government yesterday for adoption. (3) Regarding the losses suffered by the Marketplace, accountants have been invited to conduct a detailed review. (4) Regarding the written reply to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Ren Jinpin has drafted and prepared a detailed report, which will be sent today.</p>
<p>Declaration of Employees. The United Association of Employees of the National Products Marketplace declared: "June 9, the day when our Chinese National Products Marketplace was illegally closed by the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, is also the day when imperialism launched a full-scale economic war. Anyone with blood and qi is indignant. Although we have received protests from our government and assistance from various groups and individuals to conduct negotiations and seek a final victory, without sufficient strength as a backing, it is not enough to deter their boldness. This is why the more than 600 employees of our Chinese National Products Marketplace have organized a united association. What's more, our Chinese National Products Marketplace is the starting point for revitalizing Chinese industry. If we allow foreigners to destroy it and deal with it perfunctorily, it will not only make the future of national products a failure, but also sweep away national dignity and morale. It is better to die a glorious death than to live a disgraceful life. We employees are mindful of these words. In addition to immediately holding a general meeting to warn the people of the country, we also hope that patriotic men and women will uphold their consciences and support the righteousness of fighting against the enemy with shared hatred, rise up together, and launch an attack. Anyone who has a pro-foreign heart and seeks their own convenience will be a public enemy of the 400 million compatriots of the Republic of China. Everyone should punish them. And our association members must be the first to eliminate this morning's food. We await clear instructions. This is a declaration."</p>
<h3>Reasons for Rising Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Someone is Collecting and Transporting for Export</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices in both the northern and southern rice markets in Shanghai have gradually increased due to the shortage of sources. Yesterday, the highest price of white japonica rice sold in the northern market was 14.8 yuan per stone, then 14.6 yuan, then 14.2 yuan. Thin japonica rice was 13.7 yuan per stone, then 13.5 yuan, and white yuan rice was 13.4 yuan per stone, which was an increase of 23 yuan compared to last week. According to people in the rice industry, the reason for the recent increase in rice prices is that someone is secretly collecting rice in Changshu and Xixiang and transporting it for export in large quantities, which has caused the inventory in various villages to be almost exhausted. Therefore, the sources in Shanghai are becoming scarce, and in a blink of an eye, there will be a shortage of rice, and prices may continue to rise.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province</p>
<h3>Summer Cocoons Will Be Affected by the Weather Again</h3>
<p>Zhejiang has always been a famous silkworm area in our country. The cocoon season is earlier than that of Jiangsu. This year's spring cocoons were severely damaged by the weather, and the cocoon production was extremely poor, with only 30% of the harvest. In recent years, the silk factories in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province have been developing rapidly. The number of silk factories in the province has reached more than 20, and the demand for dry cocoon raw materials has increased sharply. The spring cocoons of each province this year totaled 123,000 dan, and 70-80% of them were purchased by silk merchants in Shanghai and residual cocoon merchants. The amount received by the province's silk factories is limited and cannot meet the demand. Various manufacturers, such as Weicheng, have to encourage farmers to raise summer cocoons to make up for the lack of spring cocoons. Therefore, this summer, cocoon farmers in each province are hatching summer silkworms early, and the amount of feeding is not weak. After receiving the ants, the weather is sunny and warm, which is very suitable for raising silkworms. After the first sleep, the silkworm ants developed smoothly and the feeding was good. The feed (that is, summer mulberry leaves) is sufficient, and there is hope for a good harvest. Currently, the early batches in Hangzhou and Shaoxing are about to enter the fourth sleep, and the late batches are in the third sleep. Jiaxing, Huzhou and other places are also in the second sleep. However, in the past few days, there has been continuous mold rain, followed by sultry heat and sudden cold, which has caused changes in the early batch of silkworm ants. They stopped sleeping and eating, and due to the influence of eating wet leaves and uneven temperature, they leaked yellow and spewed black, resulting in stiffness and death, almost repeating the mistakes of the spring silkworms. The current situation is not good. Although the weather has turned sunny recently, the climate is still cold, and the future of summer silkworms is still difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Bean and Rice Company</p>
<h3>Exemption from Business Tax for Paid Posts</h3>
<p>The Business Tax Preparatory Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Regarding your Chamber's official letter stating that the bean and rice businesses in this city have been paying teeth tax and therefore should not be required to pay business tax again, but the current business tax regulations in this city include the grain industry, causing concerns among the relevant trade associations, requesting an interpretation for dissemination, etc. Upon review, the draft business tax rate schedule for this city specifies that the grain industry refers specifically to those engaged in the sale of grain. For businesses that act as agents for buying and selling, merchants holding dental posts should refer to Article 20 of the draft business tax regulations of this city, change the name to business tax, and continue to collect taxes according to the old tax rate. The current tax rate is not inclusive. Due to the reasons mentioned above, we are responding for your information and dissemination."</p>
<p>Various Businesses in Wusong</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Debt Collection from the Chamber of Commerce Ended Without Result</h3>
<p>A Petition Will Be Filed with Relevant Authorities in Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent personnel to Wusong the day before yesterday to take over the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, as detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that various businesses in Wusong claim that the Chamber of Commerce borrowed large sums of money from them during previous war disasters to supply military needs, accumulating debts of over 10,000 yuan. The creditors, concerned that the receiving authorities have not yet expressed any intention to address the debt issue and might simply ignore it, went to the private residences of former executive committee members Zheng Shushan, Zhang Yuchi, and Yang Yuankang yesterday to demand answers. Unable to handle the incessant demands, Zheng and others asked them to come to the Chamber of Commerce at 8 p.m. to discuss the matter. However, when the time came, over a hundred people gathered at the Chamber of Commerce, their demeanor fierce and voices loud, almost resorting to violence against Zheng and others. Fearing the outbreak of trouble, Zheng and others immediately telegraphed the First Precinct of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau for protection. Upon receiving the message, the precinct immediately dispatched several armed police officers to dissuade the debt collectors from causing a disturbance and to wait patiently for a resolution, fortunately averting any disaster. Subsequently, the creditors elected representatives on the spot and plan to go to the relevant authorities in Beijing and Shanghai to petition in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Guo Waifeng Discusses the Current Situation of the China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<p>Guo Waifeng, the newly appointed Director-General of the China Merchants Bureau, has been in office for over a month. Yesterday, a reporter from the Daily News visited Guo at his private residence to inquire about the recent situation of the China Merchants Bureau and its reorganization plans. Guo provided detailed answers, which are summarized below:</p>
<p>The Jinliyuan Case Regarding the Jinliyuan Wharf case, the French side's attitude remains very firm. However, after direct negotiations with the Bureau, there has been some progress. French Consul-General Geng Ge-lin stated that 300,000 yuan is required for redemption, while the Bureau is currently offering 250,000 yuan, which is close. The China Merchants Bureau has sought opinions from the government and business community. A final decision will be made based on the extent of the French side's concessions. A resolution is expected soon.</p>
<p>Return of Rented Ships The General Headquarters had rented nine Yangtze River ships from the Bureau to transport troops. The Bureau currently has only two ships left. Guo Waifeng went to Beijing to request the return of the ships. The General Headquarters has agreed to return them gradually. Recently, the Jianghua ship was returned first.</p>
<p>Demolition of Properties The Bureau owns several valuable properties on Sichuan Road. Recently, they were demolished due to their dilapidated condition. Since the properties have already been mortgaged, no new buildings will be constructed unless external investors invest in building them.</p>
<p>Reorganization Plan Guo also told the reporter from the Daily News that the China Merchants Bureau is in a state of disrepair with countless problems. Talking about reorganization is like discussing the Twenty-Four Histories, not knowing where to start. Generally speaking, it is necessary to start with small matters. At the same time, it is also necessary to reorganize the finances first. Once the finances are in order, all difficulties can be solved easily. The most pressing issue is that the ships have been in service for a long time and are in a state of disrepair, but there are no funds to build new ships. Allowing the old ships to be phased out indefinitely is not a long-term solution. Therefore, it is urgent to reorganize the finances to build new ships to facilitate shipping.</p>
<p>Postponement of Layoffs The reporter also inquired about the rumored layoffs. Guo replied that although layoffs are a way to save money, there are other issues that are more important than layoffs. The layoff issue must be postponed for now. Currently, there are too many employees in the Bureau. In principle, if an organization has too many employees, they should be laid off; if it is understaffed, employees should be added. He also agrees with this principle. However, the China Merchants Bureau is not yet at the stage where layoffs are necessary.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Retains Li Zhonggong</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's telegram of retention from President Jiang reads: "Li Zhonggong, Director of the Department, Greetings. Your telegram received.

<h3>Zhang Shiming's Concubine Appeals</h3>
<p>Accepted by the High Court Second Branch</p>
<p>Trial to Open Soon</p>
<p>Zhou Miaoying, the divorced concubine of the late Nanxun wealthy merchant Zhang Shiming, filed a lawsuit last year against Zhang's wife, Xu, and Qu, her biological son, because the latter was married without her consent, requesting confirmation of their mother-son relationship. Xu and others hired lawyers Zhu Sifu and Jiang Yiping, presenting a contract signed by Zhou in the past, severing her family relationship with the Zhang family, proving that she had no right to interfere in the Zhang family's affairs. Zhou lost the case. Still unwilling to accept the outcome, she appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. It is now learned that the case has been accepted by the High Court Second Branch, which has issued summonses, delivered to both parties, and notified the two lawyers, to appear in court for trial soon.</p>
<h3>Conditions for a Concubine's Divorce</h3>
<p>Sassoon Comprador Shen Yanling</p>
<p>Separates from Beloved Concubine</p>
<p>Gives 50,000 Yuan in Alimony</p>
<p>Shen Yanling, currently the comprador of the British company New Sassoon, is the son of the late Sassoon Ah Si. Originally from Dongting Mountain, he inherited his father's position as the comprador of the company. He owns millions of assets and is one of the wealthy merchants in Shanghai, residing in Fengjili, Nanjing Road. His mistress, Cheng Yuzhen, resides at 15 Jiufu Lane, Mengdelan Road, Xinzha. Originally a woman of the demimonde, Cheng was hired by Shen when she was only fifteen. Soon after, she gave birth to a son. Not only did Shen dote on her, but the first wife also favored her, so when the son was an infant, the first wife took him to raise as her own. Later, Cheng gave birth to two more sons. Now the eldest son is six years old, the second son is five years old, and the youngest is two years old. In the blink of an eye, Cheng has been with Shen for nine years. Every month, Shen would provide her with generous living expenses without interruption. However, as the saying goes, the moon waxes and wanes, and those who gather for a long time must part. Recently, Shen's attitude towards Cheng has changed drastically. He used to love her in every possible way, but now he hates her beyond measure. He no longer wants to see her and has cut off her support, causing Cheng and her children to fear that they will have no rice to cook. Unable to continue, she did not know what to do. She asked people to persuade him, but it was all in vain. Even if the concubine's heart is like silk, the man's heart is like iron. She knew that the fate was over and they had to separate, so she asked lawyer Zhu Sifu to represent her and negotiate with Shen. After repeated exchanges of letters and consultations, three conditions were decided: (1) The two parties sever their relationship as husband and concubine. (2) Shen Yanling pays Cheng Yuzhen 50,000 yuan. (3) The three sons born to Cheng Yuzhen are all taken by Shen Yanling to raise. The agreement was officially signed a few days ago, and from then on, they will be strangers. It is said that Cheng is still young and beautiful. Although she owns a large sum of money, she cannot bear the loneliness. She plans to re-enter the entertainment industry, playing the pipa again. If she meets her former lover at a banquet in the future, how will they feel when they look back on the past?</p>

<h3>Wei Min Attempts Suicide by Taking Medicine</h3>
<p>The Man Who Killed His Wife and Son Last Year</p>
<p>Now Takes a Large Dose of Tranquilizers</p>
<p>On the evening of the 17th of this month, a traveler came to the Wugong Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Shilu Road, claiming to be surnamed Ren, given name Wei, and from Beiping to Shanghai, about 30 years old. He opened room 436 and lived there. At first, he lived a secluded life, closing the door and sitting alone, rarely calling the room service. Yesterday morning, Ren went out alone, returning and leaving several times. Around 6 p.m., he was alone in the room, burying his head in writing, then closing the door tightly without a sound. The room service staff suspected the guest's behavior, so they paid close attention to his every move. Seeing that he was alone and closed the door tightly without a sound, they reported it to the front desk. After about two hours, he still had not opened the door, fearing that something might have happened, the front desk staff broke the ventilation skylight and looked inside, seeing Ren lying on the bed, seemingly asleep, but his face was pale and his condition was not good. So they broke open the door and went inside to see the real situation. The so-called Ren Wei was lying on the bed, unable to be moved, and did not respond when called. There was a suicide note on the table, and medicine bottles were also found. They immediately telephoned the police, who sent an ambulance to take Ren to Renji Hospital for treatment. At the time, he was wearing a Zhongshan suit and was extremely depressed, but he was still breathing, and his condition was very dangerous. Later, it was investigated that this suicide attempter was Wei Min, also known as Yan Can, who had caused a sensation last autumn, having pushed his wife and children into the river to die. The court sentenced him to one year in prison for inciting suicide. Wei is now 33 years old, from Henan, and has served as a county magistrate and police chief. This suicide attempt was probably due to environmental pressure and the inability to recover, so he took this drastic measure. Before committing suicide, he wrote several letters, one to the hotel manager, saying that he had no choice but to take this action, hoping that he would be buried with his wife and children in the public cemetery after his death. Ren paid 10 yuan for the room when he arrived at the hotel, so he also mentioned it in the suicide note, saying that if it was not enough, there were still silver yuan in his small bag. Wei swallowed a large amount of tranquilizers, and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Annual Banquet of the Shanghai University Alumni Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Alumni Association held a banquet at the Xin Xin Restaurant to celebrate the graduation of this year's male and female students. Over 200 people attended, including over 40 male and female graduates, the school's president, faculty, and alumni.

Vice Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Industry gave a speech, stating that university students have the responsibility to lead the masses. According to recent statistics, there is only one university graduate for every 20,000 people in our country, which means that each university student must lead 20,000 people. Looking back at the current trend in our country, everything is being Westernized, with Western food, Western clothing, and even strange things happening due to the prevalence of dancing, while the essence of our country is being rejected, causing great unrest throughout the country. He hoped that Shanghai University students would lead the masses on the path to light, and that the Alumni Association would have a sense of connection, gather wisdom, and encourage each other. He hoped that they would pay special attention to this. Mr. Xu Zhendong's humorous performance was extremely funny, causing laughter throughout the hall. Former President Wei gave a speech, urging the students to pay attention to the spirit of Shanghai University and not let it decline. He said that Shanghai University is now increasingly on the path of preserving the essence of our country. He urged them not to be greedy for personal gain, but to strive to benefit society, the country, and the world. President Liu also said that Shanghai University must pay attention to construction, sacrifice, and promote various spirits, and wished the students well. Later, Ms. Qiu Yufeng, the leader of the class of 1920, gave a reply. The banquet ended with a chorus, a humorous play, and a raffle.</p>

<h3>Rumor of a Two-Headed Child</h3>
<p>Hundreds Deceived</p>
<p>Turns Out to Be a Tumor</p>
<p>The wife of An Maolin, a villager from Xujiazhaicun, Zhanghuabang, Wusong, gave birth to a girl at around 11:00 AM yesterday. This child had a huge tumor on the back of her neck, as large as her head. Her limbs were like those of a normal person. Initially, it was thought to be a child with two heads, which was considered very strange. However, after birth, she did not cry and seemed to be ill. Since her mother was poor and ill, she planned to abandon the child in the wilderness, unwilling to raise her. She entrusted someone to take her to a grassland near the Guanshengyuan preserved plum advertisement sign on Zhou Tang, Yunzaobang South, Wusong. A passerby happened to see it and, at first glance, also thought it was a child born with two heads, which was very strange, and therefore abandoned. The news spread to Wusong, and soon it was rumored that a two-headed child had been discovered there. Some even mistakenly claimed that a monster with three heads and six arms had been found. The entire town was immediately in an uproar. Driven by curiosity, hundreds of people went to see it by sampan. The outer roads were as crowded as a tide, causing traffic congestion. General ferries tripled their profits. By 6:00 PM, more and more people were gathering to watch. Zhang, the chief of the first sub-district of the seventh district, learned of the matter. Concerned that the traffic congestion might cause trouble, he sent police officers and local security to summon the child's family to the station. Around 8:00 PM, An Maolin was summoned to the station. Chief Zhang instructed him to take the child back and raise her, otherwise abandoning her would be a crime. An immediately took the child back home, but she was already on her last breath and unlikely to survive.</p>

The matter was discovered by a French police detective, who arrested all the above persons, including Xu Sifa, the husband of the kidnapper Jiang. The other day, the plaintiff, Yu Wang, was summoned to the court, and the defendants were handed over to the criminal court of the French Concession for investigation. The plaintiff, Yu Wang, complained about the kidnapping of her daughter. When questioned, Xu Jiang claimed that Yu Xiaomei was entrusted to her by her mother to come to Shanghai to work as a domestic helper. The child was temporarily lodged with Zhou Li, a woman she knew, who was entrusted to sell her. She claimed she did not know the details. The others prevaricated in their statements. Zhou Li, Cai Jinming, Zhang Chen, and others all confessed that Xu Jiang had indeed entrusted them to find buyers. Zhao Zhang claimed that Cai and others had brought the girl, but she refused because her origins were unclear. Xu Sifa claimed that the girl was kidnapped by his wife and he was unaware of it. The Chinese and Western officials ordered Xu Jiang and Xu Sifa to be sent to the Wu County District Court for trial. Yu Xiaomei was taken away by her mother. The others were released.</p>

<h3>Crazy Man Lying Naked on Trolley Tracks</h3>
<p>Female Spectators Embarrassed</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a man suddenly appeared at the Youche Wharf in Nanshi and lay directly on the trolley tracks. In an instant, a crowd of onlookers gathered. The man was about forty years old, his eyes tightly closed, his face covered in mud, barely resembling a human face. He wore a white, short shirt on his upper body, but his lower body was completely naked, without shoes or socks. The spectators were amazed by this strange sight. Many women, embarrassed, turned their faces away. Li Shijie, the security guard of the 18th station, heard about the incident and arrived. Because there were so many onlookers, traffic was obstructed and the trolley was in danger of passing. He went forward and ordered the man to get up, but the man ignored him. Li had no choice but to drag him off the trolley tracks and take him to the First Sub-Bureau of the District. A large crowd followed along the way. After arriving at the station, the chief conducted a preliminary interrogation, asking the man his name and origin. The man did not say a word, staring blankly. He was diagnosed with mental illness and it was ordered that a written report be sent to the Municipal Police Bureau to request arrangements for accommodation and food.</p>
<h3>Accusation Due to New Shoes and Socks</h3>
<p>Shoe Store Suspects Theft</p>
<p>Illegally Uses Torture to Coerce a Confession</p>
<p>The Central Shoe Store at No. 788 North Sichuan Road had 57 yuan stolen from the cash drawer. All the store employees denied taking it. Later, it was noticed that Chen Yougen (also known as Xu Yougen), a Chongming native who delivered meals from Tongchang Restaurant at No. 423 Zhaopu Road, had new shoes and socks. The store suspected that Chen had stolen the money. Shen Hehai, a store employee, impersonated a detective and invited someone to take Chen to a secluded place, where he was privately tortured and beaten to force him to confess to the theft and write a confession. Zhou Caifa, Chen's employer, learned of the matter, reported the false accusation and illegal torture to the police station. The police sent detectives to arrest the shoe store owner Zhang Sansan and Shen Hehai, Zhou Qifa, Zhu Axiao, and others, and took them to the Special District Court for custody and investigation. The other day, the trial continued. Liu Xinsan, a fortune teller who wrote the confession, was summoned by the police to testify, stating that the confession was written by Zhang and Shen, stating that Chen Yougen had stolen 57 yuan and voluntarily admitted to compensation, deducting three yuan from his salary each month. Although Chen was also present at the time, he did not say a word. Zhang and others forced him to sign it, showing reluctance. Zhang denied entrusting Liu to write the confession. Judge Feng ordered Liu to identify the person, but Liu claimed that there were many onlookers next to the fortune-telling stall at the time, so he might have mistaken the person. Judge Feng interrogated the other defendants and ordered Zhang to pay a 500-yuan shop bond. The others were remanded in custody and a date was set for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Young Widow Requests Alimony</h3>
<p>Wu Tang, a young widow from Jiangwan, recently hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the District Court, requesting her father-in-law, Wu Mengtan (a Jiangwan municipal commissioner who also runs Derentang Pharmacy and an oil press in the town), to pay her 5,000 yuan in alimony. Her statement was as follows: She married the defendant's third son, Chuiwei, on March 17th of this year, but after only twenty days of marriage, Chuiwei passed away from illness on April 7th. Her husband was already ill when they married. Since her husband's death, she has been subjected to cold words and harsh treatment in the family, which she can no longer tolerate. She requests that the court grant her permission to live separately and award her alimony. The case has been tried repeatedly without a conclusion. The other day, Judge Ding Shikui held another hearing. Both parties attended with their lawyers. As a result of the trial, it was agreed that Wu Mengtan would subsidize Wu Tang with 25 yuan per month for living expenses for six months, and she would still live in her husband's house, with her meals provided by her father-in-law. Both parties were satisfied and a settlement was reached. The judge wrote a settlement record in court, stating that there should be no abuse, otherwise she would be allowed to live separately. Both parties signed and left the court.</p>

<p>Special Documents</p>
<h3>Mr. Fei Tang's Second Volume Report (Fifth Continuation)</h3>
<p>Summary Translation of Parts Four and Five</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Concerning the Issue of Extraterritoriality Affecting the Public Concession [with remarks, (see Item 2 of the problems mentioned in Chapter 1)]. The chapter mentions a fact: In terms of commercial interests, the main characteristic of the Public Concession's governance system can be summarized as "safety" and nothing more. The issue of safety, the elements upon which it relies, and the extent to which the rule of law within the Public Concession currently depends on the preservation of extraterritoriality, have been discussed in Chapter 9 of Part 2 and Chapters 5 and 6 of Part 3. It is now explained that the specific issue to be addressed is whether maintaining the existing municipal political system established under the Land Regulations depends on the retention of extraterritoriality. This issue has been examined from three aspects: (1) the extraterritorial status of the Municipal Council, (2) the treaty powers as protectors of the Municipal Council's governing authority, and (3) the importance of human rights in local autonomy. The general conclusion reached is as follows: The connection between the municipal system and the extraterritorial system arises from the provisions of the Land Regulations. These provisions are nothing less than a cornerstone, necessary for maintaining the current municipal system of the Public Concession. If this cornerstone is removed, maintaining this municipal system would necessarily rely on the assistance of Chinese courts. However, the current Chinese courts are not yet able to provide this assistance. Moreover, citizens, whether as directors, electors, or civil servants, have been able to utilize this municipal system through their individual activities because of their individual freedom and the security of their lives and property. Both of these are products of extraterritoriality. If the rule of law in China has not yet been established to a degree that ordinary people can exercise their individual rights and fulfill their municipal obligations with full protection, then the abolition of extraterritoriality would inevitably destroy the lifeline of the existing municipal system. If there are no significant elements within society enjoying a freedom of action, such as that currently conferred by extraterritoriality, then the democratic system of local autonomy within the Public Concession will cease to be effective. Foreign police officers within the Public Concession and foreign members of the Volunteer Corps must also have their individual rights protected if they are to continue to perform their duties. The reasons for my conclusion, as stated above, are that the existing municipal system established under the Land Regulations is closely linked to the extraterritorial system, and that, given the current situation in China, the existing municipal system cannot be maintained if extraterritoriality is generally abolished. Therefore, its reliance on extraterritoriality is so profound. However, this view does not mean that the existing system of extraterritoriality must be preserved without modification under an organizational law whose principles are the same as those contained in the Land Regulations in order for the Public Concession's Municipal Council to continue. It is conceivable that the extraterritorial system could undergo a modification, such as applying certain Chinese laws to the extraterritorial courts, as a step towards its eventual abolition, without fundamentally affecting the autonomous system of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Under the current circumstances in China, if a genuine system of local autonomy is to be established within the Public Concession, thereby providing a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the Public Concession's existing system, the only appropriate basis is an international agreement. This situation is further discussed below. Therefore, in terms of the situation described herein, the existing basis of the Public Concession's governance system should be maintained. In other words, not accepting a national charter plan (i.e., a charter issued solely on the authority of the National Government, unrelated to any treaty provisions, as a new basis for the Public Concession's governance system) implies adhering to the existing basis of governance. This basis, in fact, is based on an international charter. From what has been stated in the previous parts of this report, it is clear that the Land Regulations of 1869 are far from providing an appropriate organizational law for the Public Concession of today, which has undergone changes with time and circumstances. Therefore, China and the relevant powers should open negotiations to amend the Land Regulations. The Municipal Council, as an organ governing the Public Concession based on its existing organizational law and without any real power over electors and taxpayers, naturally hopes to present a draft plan after consulting with its constituent members, as in the past, indicating the nature of the required changes. It will then submit this plan, through appropriate channels, to the National Government and the powers for consideration. Regarding the description of the Public Concession's existing system of governance as being based on an international charter in fact, and regarding the various levels of adhering to this basis, I do not want outsiders to assume that I am speculating on the final form or method of promulgation of a newly drafted or amended organizational law. Although the final organizational law is promulgated based on international agreement, it may also be issued by the National Government through a granting method. Some may object, arguing that any plan to amend the Land Regulations through international agreement must be adopted only after the relevant countries, including China, are willing to commence such amendment negotiations. However, these countries may not be willing. We must admit that, based on past experience as described in the previous chapter, it is extremely difficult to achieve concerted action among the governments of the relevant countries. Moreover, the National Government's attitude in recent years has shown little support for amending the Land Regulations through international negotiation and agreement. However, if the entire issue can be observed from a different perspective than that traditionally used, the prospects for the future may be completely transformed. I firmly believe that if the facts and considerations described in the previous parts of this report are given due weight, it must be recognized that maintaining the Public Concession's governance system is not only greatly beneficial to various enterprises in Shanghai, such as those involved in shipping, banking, commerce, and industry, as well as the Chinese and foreign residents of the Public Concession who have demonstrated their willingness and ability to cooperate, but also that there is a broad principle of public interest that can align the efforts of China and the representatives of the relevant countries in joint construction. If the position and mission of the Public Concession are properly understood, then the concession is of great significance to China, to the countries that trade with China, and therefore to the world in general. It should not be allowed to endanger its administration by using piecemeal patching methods, or to allow it to drag on as a provocative and pointless topic of international dispute. Furthermore, this suggestion is not a plan that, in the past, was merely viewed as intending to maintain a permanently established foreign administration on Chinese territory. This suggestion is actually a plan to develop a genuine system of international cooperation for the benefit of China and the Public Concession's internal and external interests during the transitional period before recovery, as represented by the countries represented by foreigners inside and outside the Public Concession. If the governments of the relevant countries understand the importance of maintaining a Public Concession's governance system based on international cooperation, then it is not an extravagant hope that each country will cooperate in removing the difficulties and peculiarities that have always hindered the progress of this system and diminished its effectiveness. My undertaking to study the problems requiring reform in the Public Concession's organizational law is based on my firm belief that, in view of the facts stated fairly, there is nothing unreasonable in expecting a necessary method of international cooperation, and I hope that this cooperation can be realized. The issues involved in the changes and reforms currently being discussed cannot be belittled or disregarded because they are merely a preparatory issue for the transitional period before eventual recovery. I have stated my conclusion in a previous chapter that the transitional period is bound to be lengthy, and I have further stated the reasons why the Public Concession's governance system must be continued for many years for the benefit of China itself and the relevant countries. The transitional period not only seems likely to be lengthy, but it is also crucial in determining the nature of future development. The future of Shanghai and its ultimate relationship to China's interests depend particularly on whether the management of the Public Concession's affairs can proceed smoothly during this transitional period. This chapter then discusses Item 3 of the problems mentioned in Chapter 1, namely the organization and tasks of taxpayers, and the organization and election of the Municipal Council's board of directors. The more specific issues arising under this heading are as follows: (1) Should the existing organization of the Taxpayers' Meeting, in which only foreigners have the right to participate, remain unchanged, or should it be changed to achieve one of various objectives, allowing Chinese taxpayers to directly express their views on municipal affairs? (2) Should the tasks of the Taxpayers' Meeting remain unchanged, or should they be restricted to reduce the power retained by taxpayers and increase the power of the Municipal Council? (3) Should the organization of the Municipal Council's board of directors be changed, (A) on the foreign directors' side, (B) on the Chinese directors' side? (4) Should the existing basis of municipal privileges or the existing method of election be changed? Each of these issues is then discussed one by one. Regarding the existing methods for the Chinese and foreign Taxpayers' Meeting, the election of Chinese and foreign directors, the number of directors, the term of office of directors, the time of elections, announcements, and other matters, the various shortcomings have been noted. The report indicates that all arguments noted for evaluation should be discussed jointly with the regulations for Chinese participation in the Taxpayers' Meeting and the various issues of comparing representatives of Chinese and foreign societies. In accordance with the current situation, it is necessary to have separate regulations for Chinese and foreign representatives. This necessity has been acknowledged. The report also indicates that, according to the existing organization of the Municipal Council (five British directors, five Chinese directors, two American directors, two Japanese directors), the number of Chinese representatives is no less than the number of representatives of any other country, and is more than one-third of the total number of directors on the Municipal Council. In addition to the Chinese directors, Chinese society also has the right to elect six Chinese members to serve on various committees within the Municipal Council. In addition to these six committee members, the Education Committee also has three Chinese committee members elected by the original committee members. Therefore, in the three years since the first Chinese directors joined the Municipal Council, there has been definite progress on the issue of Chinese representation. The report then mentions the Chinese society's request for an increase in the number of Chinese directors, so that they would have an absolute majority on the Municipal Council. This request is often based on a debate point, namely that the number of representatives of each society should be proportional to the municipal taxes paid by that society. According to statistics from several years ago, the amount paid by the Chinese accounted for approximately 55% of the total regular municipal tax revenue. Therefore, if there are nine foreign directors, the number of Chinese directors should be eleven. However, it has been indicated that the democratic principle of "no taxation without representation" is very different from the principle that representation should be proportional to taxation. Admitting the former principle does not mean that the latter principle must also be admitted. Allocating the number of representatives of each foreign national society, taking into account the wealth of each society and its contribution to municipal taxes, is certainly reasonable, but this is not the only factor that should be considered. The number of relevant societies, the political experience previously possessed by each society, and the social and educational circumstances of each society that affect its ability to exercise political power are all other factors. Sometimes there is another suggestion, namely that the number of representatives of each society should be proportional to the population, or should be proportional to the number of voters. This suggestion has also been mentioned in the report, and it has been pointed out that if the residents of the Public Concession were all of the same kind, then using the number of votes as the basis for allocating the number of representatives would seem to be a natural plan to adopt. However, such a method would require a public electoral register, without the problem of further distributing the number of representatives due to differences in nationality. The report also mentions the issue of the current voting qualifications, where property interests are a major element of voting rights. In addition, it mentions the prospects for the future, namely that with the passage of time and the widespread of education, the requirements for existing qualifications will be reduced, and if the principle of "one vote, one value" is insisted upon, the need for the element of allocating voting rights by population will increase. However, the report points out that this is only a speculation about the future. As for the current situation, the society of the Public Concession is not of the same kind, but includes people from more than forty countries, representing many vastly different national cultures. Despite recent developments, there are still vast and deep-rooted differences that divide the Chinese society, which makes up the majority of the residents of the Public Concession, from the foreign societies, which make up a small part of the residents. It is impossible to adopt any ideal as the basis for governing representation without regard to the prominent elements of the existing situation. The real question to be considered, hidden behind the various suggestions related to Chinese representation, is whether it is appropriate, in terms of the general interest, to have the Chinese occupy a majority on the board of directors, thereby making them assume a large part of the responsibility for the administration of the Public Concession. Under the organizational law established in accordance with the Land Regulations, allowing the Chinese to occupy a majority on the board of directors would mean transferring the governing power of the Public Concession to the Chinese. When discussing the issue of recovery, it was suggested that there are two fundamental objections to having the Public Concession managed by the Chinese under the current circumstances. The first objection is that under the current system of one-party rule, if the Chinese were to control the Public Concession's political affairs by occupying a majority on the board of directors, the real control would not be in the hands of Chinese people who act freely, as citizens of the Public Concession should, but would actually be in the hands of the National Government or the Kuomintang. This control can be exercised at any time, not only affecting the ordinary administration of the Public Concession, but also fundamentally changing the basis of the current system of governance. In other words, under the current circumstances, allowing the Chinese to occupy a majority on the board of directors may prove to be an indirect but still effective method of recovering the concession. Increasing the number of Chinese directors so that they occupy a majority on the board of directors would place the Chinese directors who make up this majority in a completely false position, because, as far as each individual Chinese director is concerned, they would be assuming an obvious responsibility, and under the current circumstances in China, no individual Chinese citizen, no matter how talented, can shoulder this responsibility. The second objection is that before the Chinese society within the Public Concession can prepare to accept a large part of the responsibility for the administration of the Public Concession, it must go through a period of political education. As stated above, in general, the Chinese society has no experience in using the representative system. Even if individuals have deep attainments in Western learning, it can hardly be said that their leaders have assimilated the principles and ideals contained in the representative system. Practical experience is an essential element of this assimilation. The entire system of public elections, and the entrustment of the management power of public affairs to representatives freely elected by qualified voters, is not something that the Chinese are accustomed to.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In the Local News section of your esteemed newspaper on the 20th of this month, there was a report about an accident on the 19th involving a British-owned Fourth Road Public Bus in the western suburbs of Shanghai. It stated that the British bus collided with our company's No. 11 bus. This is actually a rumor. Our company's Fourth Road No. 11 bus departed from Xujiahui Station on time according to its regular schedule on that day. When it reached Yangqiang Road, it saw the British bus speeding from behind. Due to the poor road surface and the rain and mud, the British bus driver panicked and swerved and overturned. The location was about ten zhang away from our company's bus, and there was no collision. We respectfully request that your newspaper make a correction to avoid confusion. We would be most grateful. Respectfully yours, to the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao, Shanghai South Public Bus Co., Ltd., June 21.</p>

<h3>Development of the Industrial Chemistry Research Institute</h3>
<p>The Chinese Industrial Chemistry Research Institute on Rue Pere Robert in this city is sponsored by Mr. Wu Yunchu of the Tianchu MSG Factory. Its nature is the same as the Mellon Institute in the United States and the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, a public interest incorporated foundation, in Japan. It is established with private donations and serves the public. This type of public academic organization is the first of its kind in the country. Although the institute's location is spacious, due to the increasing development of its business and the recruitment of more researchers, it is feeling inadequate. Furthermore, it is currently leased, which is not a long-term plan. It is heard that the Tianchu MSG Factory is funding the purchase of the Patriotic Girls' School site near Jinan University in Zhenru, approximately thirty acres, and donating it to the institute for the construction of new buildings as a long-term foundation.</p>

<h3>Accepting Mai Ling's Challenge</h3>

<h3>The Standard Gold Price Last Week Started Strong and Then Weakened</h3>
<p>Sudden Reaction After the Swap. The standard gold price rose sharply last week, breaking through 800 taels, but the fluctuations were frequent, with ups and downs of about 10 taels per day. After the initial peak, it weakened, and the twists and turns were still not small. It coincided with the swap, and August entered the market. This time, the swap suddenly had a reaction. The shorts initially posted a premium of 1.5 to 2 taels, but later, due to the multiple longs such as Dahut Hengxing, they shorted, and Chengfengyong and others (longs) were unwilling to drop out and planned to show cash, so the shorts were greatly pressured and had to reluctantly post a premium, which was unexpectedly raised to 4 taels. There are about 34,500 unswapped shares, but there are only more than 20,000 shares of spot goods, which cannot offset each other, resulting in the market price being raised. Afterwards, it trended downward. As for July, it only slightly exceeded 810 taels at the beginning of the week. After August entered the market, it turned weak. From the initial opening to the weekend, the total drop in August was 5 taels and 6 coins, and the difference between the high and low prices was 9 taels and 6 coins, but the changes in the overseas silver market were very small, and finally rose slightly. The exchange rate had no honor or disgrace, and the domestic market also had minor increases and decreases. Chinese merchants were mostly long, so short gold was largely in deficit, which was indeed stimulated by the premium posted by the swap longs. The difference between the standard gold price and the exchange rate closing price was still slightly less than 40 to 30 taels, and finally 37 to 38 taels. The number of shares in the exchange was in the range of 50,000 shares. The following is a summary of the situation last week.</p>
<p>Guangbang Swapped More Than 40,000 Shares. Since Monday (June 15th), the large bar was long at 0.0625, the silver price did not change, and the previous order was as before. The domestic market was slightly tight, and the standard gold price in July opened at 798.5 taels. People's hearts were still stable, so it rose by 7 coins, and then returned to 96 taels and 1 coin. Later, because the long sellers released empty air and were unwilling to swap, there was talk of receiving cash, so the shorts were horrified and added to their positions, soaring by more than 7 taels. It reached 803 taels and 9 coins in the afternoon. Swaps had already opened privately in the afternoon, so the price was pushed up to 810 taels and 9 coins. People's hearts were excited. The longs in July turned to August, unpredictable, and the market closed at 808 taels and 1 coin, an increase of 10 taels and 3 coins from last Saturday. The difference between the front and back markets was 14 taels and 8 coins. Speculators such as Wu bought in. The next day, the large bar shrank back to 0.0625, the silver price did not change, and the previous order remained unchanged. The internal market seemed to be long, with more buying than selling among peers. The British exchange rate was slightly more. The standard gold price opened at 808 taels and 8 coins, followed by 11 taels and a half, and closed at 05 taels and 3 coins at noon. However, there was no trading, because August had already started trading, which was 2 taels and 8 coins less than the previous day.

<h3>The Abundance of Settlements and Clearings After the Bank Holiday</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday was the summer holiday for the banking industry, so yesterday was a two-day business period, and it was also a day for clearing accounts, so the settlement and clearing situation was particularly vast. It is said that both silver dollar and foreign dollar public slips were very crowded, and small firms also used separate public slips to avoid entanglement and errors. Roughly estimated, the silver public slips totaled about six or seven million, and the foreign public slips were at least around twenty million. Remittances and settlements from various routes also exceeded one million. Banks were closed due to Sunday, so there was no news. In the market, the market price of foreign cents in the morning market was 7 mace, 2 fen, 6 li, 1 hao, 2 hu, 5 si, and in the afternoon market it was 7 mace, 2 fen, 6 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, 5 si for transactions.

<p>Cotton Yarn Market Breaks Free from Deadlock Last Week</p>
<p>Market Prices Trend Higher Daily</p>
<p>Spot Sales are Very Active</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which had been brewing for a long time, had the power to rise, but was suppressed by the situation and sellers, so it hovered around the 160 tael mark. Now, spot sales of cotton yarn are developing daily, and the Sichuan and Guangdong cartels are actively purchasing, with huge contract amounts. The Jin-Qing area in the north is also continuing to purchase, mostly domestic yarn. 16s and 20s yarns have been almost completely snapped up, and factories have no spot goods to sell, so they have to switch to purchasing futures for July and August, which shows the enthusiasm of the cartels. At the same time, American cotton, which had been sluggish for a long time, suddenly showed a turnaround, and the sellers appeared uneasy, actively covering their positions. The market prices rose daily, and the prices of yarn in each month were about five or six taels higher than the previous week. The total transaction volume was 236,950 bales. By Friday, the customer cartels had purchased about 17,000 bales of spot yarn, among which the Sichuan, Guangdong, and Tianjin cartels were the most active, with prices rising by three or four taels. There were many transactions among peers, totaling 9,000 bales. It is expected that the yarn market next week will still see an upward trend. The bale amounts purchased by each cartel are listed below:</p>
<p>Cartel　　Bale Amount</p>
<p>Sichuan　　5,000　　Tianjin　　2,600　　Guangdong　　3,000</p>
<p>Hankou　　1,400　　Shantou　　1,200　　Inland　　1,500</p>
<p>Xuzhou　　300　　　North Cartel　　260　　　Ningbo　　300</p>
<p>Yunnan　　400　　　Peers　　9,000　　Miscellaneous Cartels　　600</p>
<h3>Last Week Hankou Standard Cotton Rose by Two Tael</h3>
<p>Raw Cotton Arrivals and Sales Both Lacking</p>
<p>The cotton market had been stagnant for a long time, with no vitality. Although the bottom goods were thin, factories had no way to digest them, and foreign cotton was also dull. As a result, the market was in a deadlock. Last week, the yarn market rose sharply, gold prices remained firm, and exchange rates were difficult to rise significantly. At the same time, American cotton suddenly rose, and scattered shorts showed panic, actively covering their positions. The market prices then rose, with each month rising one or two taels compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the week was 392,300 dan. Factories did not absorb much spot cotton, and the source was also scarce. American cotton rose by thirty or forty pounds compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Consistently Firm and High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was strong because of the strength of Wall Street, and short-sellers actively covered their positions, with enthusiastic buying. The market was firm and high, with futures rising by 18 to 21 points and spot prices rising by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 9 to 10 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was firm. The bulls took some profits, with Pingguo'er rising by 2 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi rising by 3 rupees. The original telegram records are on the left (telegram dated 20th).</p>

<p>Grains and Foods: Rice Market in He Xia Suddenly Sees an Upswing</p>
<p>Xin Zha: Yesterday the weather turned clear, and arrivals from various routes were not many. Sales in this street market were sluggish, but market conditions were rising. Top-grade Changzhou and Wuxi Japonica rice rose by another foot, with limited fluctuations in the middle and secondary grades. The inventory of thin rice was extremely shallow, and buyers were relaxed, so the market was slightly tight at half a Shanghai ounce. Sharp-grain rice sales were brisk, but there was a lack of sharp-grain rice arriving in port. The inventory of customer-grade rice was depleted, so the price uniformly continued to rise by half a jiao. Yesterday, a telegram from Annam reported orders for 250,000 bags of foreign rice. It was said that 50,000 bags could arrive in port within a week. However, although this port has Anhui and Ningbo sharp-grain rice to supply, it has been affected by the gold market recently, and orders have decreased. The retail sales in urban and rural areas mostly focus on Du sharp-grain rice. With fewer ships arriving, Su Kun thick Japonica rice is especially high. Glutinous rice and Yin-hua rice are also tight, and the market price has risen by about one jiao.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, less than ten ships arrived. Sales in this city were more active as the festival had passed. Su Chang thick Japonica rice prices rose by one or two Shanghai ounces. Tongli white Japonica rice and Northern white Japonica rice were slightly in demand due to the relatively low prices. Arrivals were scarce and inventories were thin, and prices rose by nearly one Shanghai ounce. Early and late rice sales in Nan Gang, Qing Jiao, Si Jing, Songjiang, Tinglin, and Zhangyan were sluggish, and arrivals were not many, so the market was firm and stable. Sales of foreign Du sharp-grain rice were even, and prices did not rise or fall. Buyers showed great interest in Yin-hua rice, and the price was tight by one Shanghai ounce. Bai Yuan rice was stable and firm. The amount of rice opened for sale in He Xia was around 2,000 shi.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Last Week the Silk Market Remained Difficult to Rise</p>
<p>Overseas Silk Inventory Dwindling... Autumn Sales Gradually Starting</p>
<p>Japanese Silk Sales Remain Strong... Chinese Silk is Severely Affected</p>
<p>Last week in the overseas market, silk mills started weaving autumn silk fabrics, and the consumption of raw silk increased sharply. The inventory of silk was dwindling. The inventory in New York was less than 30,000 bales, and the inventory in Lyon was only over 10,000 bales, which was only enough to meet half a month's demand. Autumn sales of raw silk were gradually starting, and silk prices were trending upward. However, because Japanese merchants actively promoted old silk and sold new silk at low prices, Chinese silk was severely affected. The price of factory silk fluctuated from rising to leveling off, and silk sales were not smooth. The total transaction volume for the week was over 300 bales of various silk products. The export volume of spot silk was only over 400 bales. The market prices of Chinese silk in the overseas market at the end of last week are listed below (New York unit price per pound in US dollars, Lyon unit price per kilogram in French francs):</p>
<p>Silk Type　　New York　　Lyon　　Silk Type　　New York　　Lyon</p>

<p>Superior Gray Filature 1.35　　103</p>
<p>Hardware: Tianjin and Yantai Cartels Add to Hardware Purchases</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and hardware trading was still good, because the Tianjin and Yantai cartels all needed to load ships today, so they added to their purchases of various goods yesterday, totaling eight or nine hundred dan. The transaction volume of old iron products also reached five or six hundred dan. The market price only increased by one mace for Yantai pig iron, selling at 11 taels and 6 mace. There were no other increases or decreases.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Market Prices Rise Gradually</p>
<p>Huanggang Qingkai Rises by 8 Taels and 4 Mace</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market had no telegrams from the production area due to Sunday. The Association's market prices showed that the buying interest for Dutch No. 24 raw white sugar was very quiet, with the asking price at 11 taels and 7 mace. There were few buyers. Hong Kong goods were slightly transacted at 11 taels and 6 mace. No. 20 medium white sugar was also sluggish at 10 taels and 1 mace. The market was generally stable. Japanese sugar trading was quite smooth, and the market rose slightly by N fen and a half. Old goods were at 11 taels, 3 mace, 7 fen and a half, YT mark at 11 taels, 3 mace and a half, YP mark at 11 taels, 7 mace and a half, YRO mark at 11 taels and 0.5 mace, Minghua goods at 11 taels and 1 mace, TK mark at 11 taels, 4 mace, 2 fen and a half, TM mark at 11 taels and 2 mace and a half, SH mark at 11 taels and 2 mace. The market situation was firm. Taikoo B mark was at 11 taels, 7 mace and a half, DY mark was at 11 taels, 2 mace and a half to 2 mace and 7 fen and a half, J mark 25 temperature was at 9 taels and 4 mace, H mark was at 10 taels and 3 mace. The trend was also not weak. The sign board had Huaxin brand selling several hundred bags of newly produced raw sand, priced at 10 taels per yuan. More than one hundred packages of domestic Huanggang Qingkai were priced at 8 taels and 4 mace, which was not high. The inventory of Mianhu red sugar was very scarce.</p>
<p>The opening price yesterday was 11 taels and 4 mace. The market situation was very charming.</p>

<h3>Words of Wisdom</h3>
<p>—Qiushui</p>
<p>Lying to cover one's tracks is a necessity for married men, just like the family is for married women.</p>
<p>From what a person eats in the morning, you can tell his character, his profession, his physique, and his nationality, even his family circumstances.</p>
<p>The more a person loves art, the lower his head bows, the messier his hair becomes, and the lower his private morals fall. This is true in eight or nine cases out of ten.</p>
<p>When a man meets a woman he loves, he will never ask how long his love can last, because most men are satisfied with temporary pleasure.</p>
<p>A woman's vanity is born with her heart. If you want to break her vanity, you will break her heart at the same time.</p>
<p>A woman's heart can be as deep and shallow as the ocean and the shoal, but it will never be as clear as the water of a spring lake.</p>
<p>If you want to make modern girls go back and forth in the kitchen, you can only move their kitchen to the car or beauty salon.</p>
<p>Good husbands and perfect lovers are made, not born, and women themselves are the sole manufacturers.</p>
<p>The quality of a person's character is often judged by the number of temptations from the outside world.</p>
<h3>The Life of Manchus in the Former Capital</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jianhen</p>
<p>The Manchus of Beiping live scattered in the area behind the city. They number in the tens of thousands. During the time of the abdicated Qing Dynasty, they were entitled to imperial stipends and salaries, so they all lived a life of abundance, not engaging in production, but simply eating and sitting idle. After the Qing Dynasty collapsed and the imperial family disintegrated, those who possessed vast wealth could still manage their income and live leisurely lives. However, this was only true for a small portion of them. The rest, who relied solely on imperial stipends, inevitably struggled to make ends meet. They wanted to find employment but lacked any particular skill. Therefore, their lives were extraordinarily difficult. Many of the more astute ones knew that their former nobility was a thing of the past and that clinging to empty titles would only lead to starvation. So, they concealed their Manchu identity and pretended to be Han Chinese. The surnames they used were mostly Zhao, Liu, Guan, Zhang, etc. When asked why they chose these particular surnames, they would stare blankly and be unable to answer. Perhaps they were well-versed in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms? A smile. Since these people pretended to be Han Chinese, they further integrated by marrying Han Chinese. During the time when warlord forces dominated the old capital, most officials who came from the south did not bring their families. Seeking comfort and affection, they often married Manchu women as concubines. This was because Manchu women lived simply and had modest expectations. It was rare for Han Chinese men to marry Manchu women, likely due to class consciousness. After the national capital moved south, the market in Beiping declined sharply. Those who were previously relied upon for food and clothing had become disaster-stricken officials. They could barely take care of themselves, let alone others. As a result, the Manchus' livelihood was pushed to the brink. Out of desperation, many had their daughters pursue the life of a "goddess," meaning prostitution. However, to maintain appearances, they dared not openly solicit customers. Therefore, visitors who wished to experience this kind of pleasure could not easily find their way without the guidance of a "fisherman" (pimp). The above concerns the female side of the story. As for the men, during the days when the Qing Dynasty had not yet fallen, they had nothing to do all day, so they mostly used songs for entertainment. They were quite knowledgeable about theater. They could still handle roles in robes and official hats on stage. Thus, the theater became their only outlet. Among them, some achieved great fame. However, this was limited to those who were proficient in theater studies. Others who engaged in lowly occupations were still numerous. Therefore, the lives of Manchus can be summarized with the two words "tragic" (悲慘). The princes and grandsons of the past had become destitute, which was truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Mongolia and Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Liren</p>
<p>Japanese economist Mr. Okura once went to Inner Mongolia to observe the area in person. Recently, he advocated for the construction of large-scale animal husbandry and dairy farms in the area because it is not suitable for cultivation but is very suitable for animal husbandry. If livestock such as sheep, cattle, and horses are raised using scientific methods, and if butter and canned food are made from cow's and sheep's milk and sold to various countries around the world, the profits would be considerable. Recently, Japanese capitalists have felt that this is a profitable venture, and they have each found suitable locations in the area and have begun to build small-scale farms. This type of business has recently attracted the attention of Chinese and Russian parties, and disputes are bound to arise in the future because the industrial movement contains political implications. Recently, a large number of Japanese have moved to various places near the South Manchuria Railway, which has already attracted attention.</p>
<p>Mongolia and Manchuria have always been plagued by bandits, making travel treacherous. Merchants and industrialists are hesitant to move forward. Recently, the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau hired shrewd and capable detectives and trained police dogs in the border area of Harbin to catch thieves, which has been very effective. The dog trainers are experienced Russians. Currently, the most intelligent dog is named "Rex." There is also a dog that is exceptionally brave, able to jump over walls seven feet high and run up and down ordinary wooden ladders with incredible agility. It is said to be a type of British police dog.</p>
<p>Recently, many major banditry cases have been solved and many thieves have been arrested in Mongolia and Manchuria. All of this is due to the work of police dogs. A week ago, someone's sable coat worth five thousand gold coins was stolen. The detective took a police dog to the scene and had it sniff the coat's wrapping. The dog barely touched its nose to it before running to the kitchen and biting the clothing of the cook, who had served the household for five years. He was usually honest and reliable, and no one would have suspected him of being the main person in this theft case. However, after interrogation, he confessed the truth. The pearl was returned to Hepu. Petty thieves will be more cautious from now on. Police dogs are truly a great help to local security. Recently, the police authorities in Harbin, Fengtian, and Jilin have been paying close attention to police dogs.</p>
<p>In recent years, the only storyteller who can rival Li Bokang and stand on equal footing is Su Dao, but the Zhu Lan'an and Zhu Ju'an brothers are a double act. Firstly, the Romance of the Western Chamber that they sing is absolutely unique. Secondly, Lan'an's knowledge and experience far exceed what Bokang can achieve. Thirdly, the Zhu brothers' storytelling skills and their interludes are humorous and witty, improvising based on the scenery. They have inherited the style of Xie Shaoquan, the literary champion. Although their singing voice is not as loud and clear as Li's, their pronunciation is accurate and their rhyme is excellent. Moreover, their audience consists of respectable businesspeople, politicians, and academics. Their appeal is consistently strong and long-lasting, without the problem of fluctuating attendance. Recently, they have been performing The Ingenious Marriage at the Defeyi Restaurant downstairs, and it is also well-organized and logical, similar to The Romance of the Western Chamber. This alone makes them a cut above Bokang.</p>
<p>Zhang Shaochan, Zhao Jiaqiu, Shen Jian'an, and Xue Xiaoqing of the Dongfang Storytelling Theater are two pairs whose artistry is still considerable. However, because they are too familiar with the stories of Shuangzhufeng (Double Pearl Phoenix) and Zhenzhuta (Pearl Pagoda), their appeal cannot be expanded. It is heard that Mr. Chen Xingchun, the manager of the storytelling theater, is determined to revitalize the theater and is working hard to improve it to the best possible state. He will invite Xu Jixiang and Zhu Yaoxiang to join, and transfer Zhang, Zhao, Shen, Xue, and others who are too familiar with the stories. Xu's The Martyrs has been well-known in Shanghai for a long time and has a considerable reputation. Zhu is a disciple of Zhao Xiaoqing and has a reputation for surpassing his teacher. His specialty is the two books Hou Miaojin Feng (After the Gold-painted Phoenix) and Hou Yu Kuilong (After the Jade Kui Dragon), which can be considered the best of their kind. After Zhu Lan'an and Ju'an finish The Romance of the Western Chamber, they will continue with The Ingenious Marriage. It is expected that the Dongfang Storytelling Theater will see a new record.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Feast for The Beauty of Yu</h3>
<p>— Huan Wu</p>
<p>The Youlian Film Company hosted a banquet at the Xin Xin Restaurant last night to celebrate the successful completion of the sound film The Beauty of Yu, and to bid farewell to engineer Liu Liangchan, who is going to Hong Kong. More than fifty people attended, making it a grand occasion. As the wine flowed, many interesting things happened. Chen Shaomin, known as "The Machine Gun," was the most lively, chattering and joking tirelessly, like a machine gun firing in bursts, truly living up to his name. Xu Qinfang's speech, though brief, was elegant and concise, with a subtle and inexhaustible charm, earning thunderous applause. It was originally planned to have dancing by the male and female employees and actors of Youlian, as well as Jiang Qifeng's ventriloquism, but Jiang suddenly declined due to some reason and did not showcase his skills, which was regrettable. The newcomer female lead, Hu Ping, was graceful and reserved and attracted the most attention. The banquet ended near midnight.</p>
<h3>Humorous Divorce Case Judgment</h3>
<p>— Jian Fu</p>
<p>I have been addicted to opium for nearly twenty years. I have tried to quit many times, but I have always relapsed, experiencing much bitterness. I have spun a cocoon around myself, and I cannot break free. Recently, with the crackdown on opium becoming increasingly strict, I finally decided to quit. It has been seven months since I last tasted the膏澤 (gooey substance) of opium. The key to relieving boredom is only heavy drinking and deep sleep. So, I have once again formed an inextricable bond with Mr. Du Kang (god of wine). When I wake up with nothing to do, I go with my servant to fish by the stream, washing away my worries. I have a feeling of floating out of the world, and I no longer think about opium. Looking back on the past twenty years of being accompanied by opium, I have always remembered her in my sleep. She is like my dear wife. Now, the divorce case is officially announced. Recalling the past, I am jokingly drafting a humorous divorce case judgment as a form of self-deprecation.</p>
<p>Special Court of the East Asia Democratic Republic, Civil Judgment, Min Zi No. 2709. Plaintiff: Addict, 38 years old, ashen registration, Confucian scholar, lawyer Du Kang selected. Defendant: Opium, 39 years old, black registration, assistant Gao Gen. The above-mentioned plaintiff, Addict, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Opium, for fraudulent marriage, requesting a divorce. The court has heard the case and judges as follows: (Main Text) The marriage between Addict and Opium is granted a divorce. Other claims are dismissed. (Facts) The plaintiff, Addict, in the third year of the Xuantong reign of the abdicated Qing Dynasty, through matchmakers Heroin and Morphia, engaged a yellow-registered Hibiscus mutabilis as his wife. Before she could marry him, she died. Coincidentally, the daughter of the black-registered Elephant Poppy next door, named Opium, was about the same age. She coveted the plaintiff, Addict's, wealth and constantly sought to meddle. They took the opportunity to lure Heroin and Morphia, and they did not inform the groom's family of Hibiscus mutabilis's death. Instead, they had their daughter, Opium, take her place. They successfully deceived him. Three years later, they chose an auspicious day and consummated the marriage. However, Opium's nature was inherently promiscuous. Addict was young at the time, and his sexual desire was also strong. He was seduced by her and could not practice restraint, eventually becoming emaciated. On March 10th of the twelfth year of the Republic, the couple suddenly turned against each other. Addict sued the defendant, Opium, for promiscuity and childlessness, requesting the annulment of the marriage contract. Opium also counter-sued, claiming that the plaintiff did not know how to restrain his desires and had contracted a chronic illness himself, and she did not want a divorce. The court ordered the lawyers of both parties to mediate and settle the matter. However, on October 20th of the nineteenth year, the original matchmakers, Heroin and Morphia, suddenly told Addict that the defendant, Opium, was actually an imposter. The plaintiff was indignant and filed a lawsuit with the court on the 22nd of the same month, requesting a divorce. (Reasoning) To determine whether the claims made by the plaintiff are true, it is necessary to ascertain whether the testimonies of the original matchmakers, Heroin and Morphia, are accurate. To prove whether the testimonies of Heroin and Morphia are accurate, it is necessary to summon Opium's father, Elephant Poppy, to court for questioning to clarify the truth. According to the court transcript of the 26th of the same month, Elephant Poppy confessed, "I should not have coveted the plaintiff's wealth and had my daughter take her place. In fact, the Hibiscus mutabilis daughter died long ago." Heroin and Morphia testified, "Elephant Poppy promised to give each of us three thousand marks after the matter was completed, but he has not paid us yet." When confronted with this, Elephant Poppy bowed his head and had nothing to say. Therefore, the case of Opium's fraudulent marriage is undoubtedly true. The judgment is as stated in the main text. Prosecutor Xie You of this case performed his duties in court. January 20th of the twentieth year of the Republic. Presiding Judge: Judge Lin Wenzhong. Judge: Shang. Judge: Yong Tao. Court Clerk: Wu Youpei. The right document is certified to be identical to the original.</p>

<h3>Three Eras (13)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(7) You Are a Good Person</p>
<p>One day, Zhang Xiao San'er was at the East Railway Station seeing off a guest. He saw a crowd gathered on the platform. Pushing his way to the front, he saw two policemen leading a man and a woman away with ropes. He did not recognize the man, but the woman was his own wife, Zhang Er Sao. He could not help but be taken aback. After thinking for a moment, he called his orderly and had him bring one of the policemen over. He asked what the prisoners had done. The policeman said, "This woman is no good. She is the wife of Zhang Xiao San'er, a rickshaw puller. She ran away from her husband and lived with a man surnamed Wang, a clerk, for a few years. Now she has left the man surnamed Wang and run away with a man surnamed Fan. We saw them acting suspiciously at the station and questioned them. This kind of immoral thing, we naturally have to deal with. Commander, do you have any orders?" Zhang Xiao San'er smiled and said, "That's right. I saw you there before. Can't you remember that you used to be a guard at the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce?" The policeman said, "I was a guard." Zhang Xiao San'er smiled and said, "That's all old news. You've been a policeman for quite a few years. Why haven't you been promoted?" The policeman said, "I'm too honest. I don't know how to please my superiors. Commander, maybe you can promote me." Zhang Xiao San'er said, "Okay. I'll promote you. I live on Agricultural and Commerce Street right now. Go find me. Maybe I can think of something for you. You send this pair of bastards to the police department, and then you can come see me." The policeman agreed with a "Yes," saluted, and left. Two hours later, the policeman came to Zhang's mansion to see Commander Zhang. Zhang Xiao San'er's first words were, "Do you recognize me?" The policeman stood at attention and said, "Yes, Commander Zhang." Zhang Xiao smiled and said, "I don't think you recognize me. You beat me up on Agricultural and Commerce Street." The policeman was shocked. Zhang Xiao San'er said, "It's okay. I beat you up too. You caught that man and woman at the station. I thank you for that. Even though you were a little meddlesome, you did a good job meddling." The policeman said, "Commander, policemen don't meddle. This kind of immoral person, it is the responsibility of the police to catch them." Zhang Xiao San'er laughed and said, "Interesting. You haven't forgotten your routine. What good did you get from catching them?" The policeman said, "This is just our responsibility. There's no good in it. Otherwise, what would we be doing with the few dollars of salary we get each month?" Zhang Xiao said, "There's no good in it, so what are you catching them for?" The policeman said, "Commander, this is our responsibility." Zhang Xiao San'er frowned and said, "Don't talk to me about responsibility. I don't understand that. Tell me something that I can understand. What's really going on?" The policeman said, "Yes. We are for society... No. Let me put it this way. This Zhang Er Sao ran away from her husband. We caught her to vent the anger of her husband. Her husband is willing to take her back, and the couple will be reunited..." Zhang Xiao San'er said, "Hmph. Her husband would never be so shameless." The policeman said, "Yes. Her husband won't take her back. If he wants to sue her, the court can punish her. This way, those girls who don't learn good things won't dare to act recklessly. So we took the people's money and still did things for the people." Zhang Xiao San'er said, "That's right. Immoral things must be taken care of. I understand now. You are a good person. I'll talk to your director and make sure you get promoted to sergeant."</p>

<h3>Progress of China's Ivory Carving Industry</h3>
<p>Detailed Records from the American Commercial Commissioner. Ivory Guanyin Statues Related to Chinese Culture</p>
<p>Ms. Li Ting, an American, published an article on ivory statistics, describing the development of ivory trade in our country, which is quite interesting. I will copy it as follows:</p>
<p>China is one of the main producing countries of raw materials for ivory art, but there are few records about ivory. It is difficult to obtain accurate figures for the ivory trade. The following records are for ivory shipped from China to the United States. The figures are directly taken from the official survey of the American Commercial Commissioner in China. As for general facts about ivory, there are only two sources that can be relied upon: one is Mrs. Qianbai'er's "Ivory Carving," published by the American Women's Club, and the other is Mr. Laofu's "Ivory in China," published by the Poetry and Art Museum.</p>
<p>The 1929-30 Chinese Yearbook mentions ivory and records the import tariff rate for ivory artifacts, which is said to be 27.5% of its value. It also states that in 1925, 43,670 catties of ivory (from Mongolia or India) were imported into China, with a total value of 177,257 taels of customs silver. Imports increased greatly in 1926, reaching 60,178 catties, with 243,872 taels of customs silver. Imports decreased sharply in 1927, probably due to the internal unrest in China, which reduced the demand for ivory (at least on the part of foreigners). Only 36,973 catties were imported, worth 151,276 taels.</p>
<p>The 1929-30 Chinese Yearbook reveals an interesting fact, namely that in the three years from 1925 to 1927, no ivory was exported from China. This is because already-carved ivory artifacts are not classified as "ivory" but as a common category of "art."</p>
<p>According to the records of the American Commercial Commissioner in China, Guangzhou exported ivory to the United States in 1929 worth US$4,889. The following year, it decreased to US$3,282.</p>
<p>There are 110 shops in Shanghai that make ivory and bone artifacts. Ninety percent of them specialize in ivory artifacts. These American shops and factories are mostly located in the area near the City God Temple. One of them can do 60,000 to 70,000 yuan of business each year. In prosperous years, it can reach 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>When ivory is imported into Shanghai, each piece is about five to eight feet long. Young elephant tusks are slightly yellow, while old elephant tusks are white and slightly gray. There is also a type of walrus tusk, which is gray and easily distinguished from ivory.</p>
<p>The market price of ivory in Shanghai varies with supply and demand, like other commodities, but averages about 600 to 850 taels per picul. This winter, the price of ivory rose sharply due to the fall in the price of silver. The quantity and value of ivory imported into Shanghai are listed by year as follows:</p>
<p>Quantity (斤) Value (兩)</p>
<p>1924 22,228 97,375</p>
<p>1925 21,959 102,971</p>
<p>1926 33,816 142,275</p>
<p>1927 10,106 41,176</p>
<p>1928 25,858 115,042</p>
<p>After ivory is made into artifacts, its total weight is of course different from when it was imported, because there is a loss of shavings during carving. Approximately nine ounces are lost for every sixteen catties. As for the export of earth ivory, it was 597 catties in 1922, with a total value of US$5,476 (this was not recorded in the recent Chinese Yearbook).</p>
<p>Carving ivory requires skilled techniques, and the wages of Chinese carvers are very low. In Shanghai, ivory chopsticks (plain and uncarved) cost only 3.9 Chinese cents in labor per ten pairs, plain cigarette cases cost only 7 cents per piece, and seals cost 6 cents per piece.</p>

<h3>Staying Up Late</h3>
<p>— Zheng Hong</p>
<p>The voices in the dormitory gradually quieted down, and the lights were also turned off. After a long period of silence, a new life began in our room. A group of comrades who were staying up late had roused their spirits and were busy getting active. Two were each reading textbooks in bed by the light of a flashlight. Two others, using a single wax candle, simply sat at the table, copying and reciting, knowing that the dormitory supervisor wouldn't come anyway, so they could do as they pleased.</p>
<p>They were willing to sacrifice a night's sleep because they really had no choice. The upcoming major exam was directly related to whether they would pass or fail. Some subjects usually didn't have exams, but the major exam was unavoidable, and the scores depended entirely on it. So, if they didn't use this one night to prepare for what had been taught over half a year, how could they cope with the exam tomorrow? In reality, if they didn't prepare like this, they could simply turn in a blank paper. If they did prepare, they might get excellent results. Even if they forgot everything they had prepared the day after the exam, as long as they could do well on the exam tomorrow, that was all that mattered. Thinking about the danger of failing and the trouble of retaking the exam next semester, how could they care about losing a night's sleep? Besides, after the exam, they could sleep for several days in a row to make up for it.</p>
<p>The dim candlelight cast eerie shadows in the room. The appearance of the two sitting at the table looked even more haggard and exhausted in this dim light. Their lifeless eyes and barely supported heads, combined with an expression of bitterness, made them look like they were just recovering from a serious illness or about to become seriously ill. It was hard to believe that these two were the lively and cheerful classmates they usually were.</p>
<p>The alarm clock beside one classmate's bed ticked monotonously, and time passed by minute by minute. The two sitting at the table, while preparing, occasionally uttered curses against the school and resentments against the teachers. Anger was building up on their faces, one pale and pitiful, the other flushed and terrifying. One of the classmates preparing in bed had unknowingly fallen asleep. The book fell to the ground. It seemed that when she fell asleep, she had pushed the flashlight, so the flashlight had turned around, and the light was shining directly on her face, revealing a gaping mouth from which came frequent sighing hums. Suddenly, "Oh, I can't stand it anymore..." a startled cry. She suddenly sat up from her sleep, her eyes slowly opening. She looked at the two sitting at the table, picked up the book from the ground, sighed, and lay down again to continue preparing. The two sitting at the table seemed to have heard the not-very-loud cry, but also seemed not to have heard it. They glanced at her. The cry, however, woke up a classmate sleeping in the bed near the door. She had been sleeping soundly and hadn't been staying up late, so she couldn't help but complain, muttering a few words before falling back into a confused sleep. But after that, she couldn't sleep soundly, waking up for no reason from time to time. Finally, with a sigh, she got up, walked back and forth in the room a few times, and then lay down again. The two classmates sitting at the table looked at her with slight surprise. Originally, she was good at sleeping soundly and couldn't be awakened even by loud noises, but tonight she had been awakened by a slight cry and couldn't sleep soundly after waking up. It was probably because her spirits had been weak these past few days, so her nerves had become oversensitive.</p>
<p>The sky outside the window gradually turned white, and the wax candle had burned down a lot. One of the two sitting at the table had fallen asleep on the table. The other one, with red eyes, stared blankly, not knowing what she was looking at, still sitting there in a daze. Suddenly, the one sleeping near the door jumped out of bed, walked to the table, and said, "I suddenly remembered in my dream that I missed two sections during the day and didn't prepare them. Let me do it now. You two are extremely tired, so you should go to sleep for a while. When it's time to get up, I'll come and wake you up." So, she woke up the one who was sleeping, both calling and pushing her, and told her to go to sleep with the other one. Then, in the light of the remaining candle, she sat at the table, opened the book, and gently recited.</p>
<h3>An Hour's Lecture</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>While Ying and I were slowly walking in the corridor, chatting casually, suddenly the director of discipline, Mr. Man, came out of the office and beckoned to us, taking a few steps forward and saying, "You don't have class for the next hour because the drawing teacher, Mr. Shen, is on leave. Now, you two go and tell your whole class not to wander off. I have a few words to talk to you about."</p>
<p>We immediately ran into the classroom as instructed and told everyone what Mr. Man had said. Some of the classmates were overjoyed, while others grumbled, "Who wants to listen to that long-winded Mr. Man? Otherwise, a good hour could have been used to read some novels!" And two of the monitors and two class leaders hurriedly left their seats, abandoning their own work, to sweep the floor, wipe the blackboard, and dust the platform...</p>
<p>As soon as the class bell rang, Mr. Man came in with a smile. The head class leader stood up first, made a gesture to us, and we all understood what he meant, quickly straightened up, and bowed respectfully to Mr. Man. Usually, when other teachers taught, we didn't stand up. Moreover, if we encountered a kind teacher, not only would we not stand up and bow to him, but we would often pretend that we hadn't seen him come in. The most ridiculous thing was that some classmates sometimes didn't even take out the textbooks they were supposed to be using.</p>
<p>"This is a very good opportunity. I have to talk to you for an hour. I've been waiting for several weeks. It's not easy to finally get the chance today," Mr. Man said, standing on one side of the platform, with his hands behind his back, smiling kindly. He was very handsome, not exactly a beauty of the ages, but his elegant conversation and lively, unrestrained, and dignified manner were enough to make us respect and love him.</p>
<p>"What I'm going to talk about now is that there are too many love letters being exchanged among you students. In other stricter schools, not only would love letters be confiscated, but points would also be deducted. Because I couldn't bear to be so stubborn and unreasonable, I have been lenient and, as a rule, returned all the love letters that you young students shouldn't be reading after reviewing them. And I use sincere words to advise you. But you naughty students, seeing that I don't deduct points or scold you much, shamelessly let me advise you once, twice, three times, and you still continue to be unrestrained. I'm now telling you very formally that if I find such a letter next time, I will confiscate it and deduct points. You should know that you are still in the stage of studying. If you don't study diligently and quietly, even if you manage to find a foothold in society in the future, you will definitely feel the lack of various knowledge. If you don't believe me, I'll give you an example. I have a few classmates who almost always looked down on studying when they were in school. They always said, 'In today's society, you have to be good at ingratiating and flattering others to get a good position. Knowledge and experience, no matter how rich or sufficient, are useless.' So they were all very passive and never willing to study for a while. Usually, they were either writing letters or watching movies, entertaining guests, chatting idly, all sorts of idle activities. But now they are barely working in society. And it is at this time that they have learned and regretted their past mistakes. So in their spare time, they are always reading books and studying quietly. Some who are slightly more financially well-off have even hired teachers to make up for what they missed. So if you don't know, that's fine, but if you do know, you should change. In the future, I hope you write less and read less of those worthless love letters, so as not to waste the precious and limited time of your studies. Otherwise, I believe you will definitely regret it when you work in society in the future. You probably all know this saying, 'A youth spent in vain regret in old age,' I sincerely and earnestly pray that this saying doesn't apply to you." He stopped suddenly, his glittering eyes, both stern and kind, shooting at our faces. For a moment, we who had been listening so intently quickly lowered our heads. At that time, I guessed that everyone's hearts had probably rippled a little.</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's War Diaries from the European Theater</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>To inspect the situation in Flanders, I met with General Wilson and Lord Milner in Abbeville. Then, I went to the headquarters of the British Second Army in Brensget. On the evening of the 16th, I met General Buller Me near Kassel, at the place of Kapoor, it was nighttime, all our lights were out, and the sound of artillery fire around us was deafening. The enemy's attack on Flanders was intensifying. I also met General Lopieru, commander of the French Second Cavalry Regiment, and Colonel Ditig, whom I had previously sent to investigate the British troops available for deployment. At ten o'clock, we returned to Buller Me's headquarters in Brensget and called General Weigen, my commander in Shaqes, ordering the 34th Division to drive to Stinwott by car the next day.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, I met with Major General Wilson, the British Chief of Staff. He agreed with the proposals of General Haig and General Buller Me. The British General Staff suggested that the Allied forces in Flanders should successively retreat to the water defenses of Aires-sur-la-Lys, Saint-Omer, and Furnes. I opposed this plan. General Haig had long considered abandoning and even destroying the port of Dunkirk, but I could not share his concerns.</p>
<p>My proposal was to hold our lines firmly for the moment and, when necessary, deploy French reserves and utilize Belgian forces. On the 17th, when I met the King of Belgium and the Chief of Staff of the Belgian Army, I made the same suggestion. Before leaving Brensget and returning to Shaqes, I also instructed General Buller Me on the 18th in accordance with this idea. A few hours later, I wrote to Major General Gilon and General Haig based on this view, as I was very willing to further explain to them the steps the Belgian Army and the British Second Army should take in this situation. Later, I communicated the guidelines for defensive warfare to the Allied forces, also based on this point.</p>
<p>Flanders could no longer afford to cede an inch of ground. Mont Kemmel is only twenty-five miles from Dunkirk. That mountain controls the entire plain leading directly to Dunkirk. If the enemy set up heavy artillery there, he would be able to destroy our resistance and irresistibly approach the port of Dunkirk. In other words, he would be able to reach the Channel coast and endanger our communication with Britain, while also putting the entire Belgian army in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>However, I ultimately failed to prevent the British defensive line in the Ypres Salient from retreating to Dunkirk on April 27, and the Belgian defensive line was also affected and retreated to the Yperlee Canal.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 27th, I set off north again. I first went to Brensget to see General Buller Me, then to Ysguebecque to see General Mitry. I told them that the situation was serious and explained to them the fundamental principles of defense required by the current situation. I also solemnly stated that as soon as reinforcements arrived, they must be ordered to enter the front lines to participate in the battle.</p>
<p>From April 17th to 20th, the enemy intensified its attack on the Allied defensive lines south of the Flanders Mountains, suffering a major setback. However, while the Germans suffered heavy losses, the British losses were also considerable. General Haig's letter of April 18th mentioned the extent of the losses. Fortunately, other reserve troops could be deployed to maintain the battle situation. These were the French reserves.</p>
<p>The 34th Division had already set off on April 17th, and the 154th and 39th Divisions were transferred to the front on the 18th. The 27th Division arrived on the 23rd. After these reserve divisions were assembled, they were formed into "the local detachment," commanded by General Mitry. This French force, consisting of five infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions, was deployed from the British defensive line to the north of Ypres. The British Second Army was able to withdraw seven divisions and sixteen brigades from the battle.</p>
<p>However, if the enemy continued to attack relentlessly, we would have to transfer several more French divisions to Flanders. I ordered the Tenth Army to quickly move its vanguard, the 16th Army Corps (31st and 32nd Divisions), forward to the Ouchy-les-Mines line, while continuing to complete its task of assisting the Arras area and preparing to send troops to participate in the battles of Cambrai, Béthune, and Robecq. At the same time, the 46th and 47th Divisions of the Fifth Army subsequently moved to Frevent and Bucquoy.</p>
<p>The French reserves thus underwent a general deployment to the north, motivated by three factors: to assist the British forces in Flanders, to fight alongside the British forces in the Arras area when necessary, and to prepare to participate in the Battle of the Somme.</p>
<p>The dangers on the last two fronts still existed. Conflict could break out again at any time. According to the calculations of the French General Staff, the enemy still had sixty divisions that could try to break the link between the British and French armies. He had not succeeded so far.</p>
<p>South of the Somme River, the fighting on the front lines had been relatively quiet for three weeks, but on April 23rd, a sudden warning arrived. The enemy, with eight divisions, taking advantage of the fog, launched a large-scale attack again. They seized Villers-Bretonneux from the British Fourth Army and Hangard from the French First Army, advancing all the way to the outskirts of Gachy.</p>
<p>The enemy's expansion to Villers-Bretonneux was very unfavorable to our army. The enemy thus gained observation posts and gun positions, from which they could shell our army from a superior position and even occupy Amiens. In other words, the enemy would be able to carry out its plan along the Somme River line, cutting off the Allied communication and even the Allied links.</p>
<p>Villers-Bretonneux was a large area. If the enemy were able to deploy at their leisure, it could become a strategically valuable stronghold. Therefore, at all costs, our army should use all its strength to recapture it immediately.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the warning arrived, I ordered General Rawlinson to prepare to recapture Villers-Bretonneux, as its loss would be a great danger to us, and I agreed with General Digby Jones to launch a counterattack. General Rawlinson was very supportive of this proposal.</p>
<p>On the nights of the 24th and 25th, the Australian troops launched a counterattack, capturing the high ground and villages. The Moroccan Division of the French First Army was on the right flank, retaking the area north of Hangard. General Digby Jones advanced steadily, consolidating the restored positions. At the same time, General Fayolle moved two divisions north in order to participate in the battles between the Somme and the Lys rivers.</p>
<p>The British reserves on the right flank had been fighting near Villers-Bretonneux and suffered heavy losses. General Haig called my attention to this on the evening of the 24th. I gave him a satisfactory reply, saying that the French reserves were ready to assist and that the French First Army had decided to replace General Rawlinson's right flank, the British Third Corps.
