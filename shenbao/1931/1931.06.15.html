<p>前數日自英美要人赴德會議之說起一時挽救經濟難局之重大問題。頗有活動之象而今復消息沉寂者。固由於應付該問題之各國政府。未肯輕易表示其意見亦由於各國政府。忙於應府國内問題而不暇也。如德國各黨派之反對緊急命令日形勢。雖稍見緩和。然白魯寗仍堅持其主張。謂將以緊急命令之存亡。爲其個人進退之標準。是其調和希望。恐一時尚難實現也。英國自由黨提出地稅修正案後。一時形勢緊張。昨工黨閣員與自由黨要人開一度圓桌會議。以兾避免牽動政局。雖云談話已有進步。然尙須俟自由黨大會最後之决定。是政潮平息之望。猶未能預决也。意國自反教風潮起後。激動全體教民之公憤。羅馬教皇亦堅持甚力。今雖進行調解。然兩方仍在相持之中。一時亦不易了。至於法國。則新舊總統正在交替之際。政治雖不致有所停頓。然迎新送舊。自不免有一番忙碌。關於一切重大問題。亦必與新總統有一番商榷。故國際間外交消息反形沈寂也。</p>

<h3>業餘籃球錦標决定</h3>
<p>尙字組丨愛字隊</p>
<p>武字組丨友邦隊</p>
<p>精字組丨三鼎足</p>
<p>昨爲市一公共體育塲業餘籃球競賽會閉幕之期、上下午共賽八塲、除神字組之錦標已歸炸彈隊外、其他尙武二組錦標、亦均决定、精再組以三隊分數相等、尙須淘汰複决、紀其戰績如下、</p>
<p>組别　隊之勝負　成績</p>
<p>（尙）　也是勝新聞　五○比二一</p>
<p>（尙）　愛字勝健美　三三比一二</p>
<p>（武）　鳴呼勝浦江　浦江棄權</p>
<p>（武）　友邦勝郵務　一四比一二</p>
<p>（尙）　愛字勝新聞　新聞棄權</p>
<p>（精）　南星對社光　三七比三三</p>
<p>（精）　黑星勝樂星　三六比一七</p>
<p>尙組愛字稱覇　愛字與健美、爲尙字組之兩鐵軍、環戰以來、各未稍挫威風、一朝會師、識者早知其有一番轟轟烈烈之戰績、孰料上半時龍騰虎躍、尙成對峙之局、下半時則愛字左右兩綘、一搭一擋、中球如連珠、而健美則計窮勢促、一籌莫展、坐失江山、愛字遂以三三對一二佔有尙字組錦標、</p>
<p>武組友邦舉威　友邦郵務之戰、劇烈異常、蓋處此出生入死之關頭、不得不爾也、第以監視過嚴各雖進展、渾身大汗、上半時只博得四對六之比數、郵務小勝、下半時依然各守堅壁、雖分高下、看看時間將了、友邦左衛忽破堅直搗、連中二球、一躍居上、演成十對六之比數、合計之爲十四比十二、郵務以二分之差失却尊嚴地位、惜哉、</p>
<p>精組鼎足三分　精字組中環戰成績、社光所向皆捷、南星與黑星、皆一遭敗挫、昨日南星社光之戰、使社光獲勝、可巍然居覇主地位、乃戰事變幻、令人莫測、社光苦戰結果、竟以三三對三七、爲南星所敗、在上半時内、社光人各爭功、不能通力合作、故以一一對二二大敗於南星、下半時、雖痛改前非、力謀挽救、卒以相差過巨、追趕不上、比數爲二二比一五、合而計之、相差只四分耳、於是南星社光黑星、均一負之資格、成鼎足三分之局、茲錄其淘汰奪標之秩序如下、</p>

<p>（二）　初賽　初賽優勝之隊　對社光　十九日下午五時五十分</p>

<h3>愛國女學添辦高中師範科之旨趣季通</h3>
<p>愛國女學决於二十年度第二學期起添辦高中師範科、有人問我們開辦的旨趣、謹撮答如下、</p>
<p>（一）　你們爲什麽開辦高中師範科、</p>
<p>本校除體育科是職業科外、高中只辦有文科和普通科、文科在造就一般有文學素養的或預備升入大學文科的人材、普通科則作升入大學之預備、課程編制中職業科目是很少的、我們要提倡女子職業敎育、所以决定開辦高中師範科、再、我們知道女子就業的機會太少、社會上對於女子職業還不甚注意、女子比較的最適宜的職業要算是服務敎育界了、而她們有柔和的性情、摰誠的態度去愛護兒童、敎育兒童、對於兒童、對於兒童的認識與兒童的問題要親切得多呢、因此、本校不辦商科或工科、决意添辦高中師範科了、</p>
<p>（二）　你們要養成什麽樣的女敎師</p>
<p>我們敎育的總目標是「培養眞心敎養兒童熱誠服務社會的女導師、這樣的導師所必具的條件是、（一）健康的體魄、（二）科學的頭腦、（三）創造的精神（四）柔和的性格、（五）藝術的興趣、我們相信符合於這樣條件的女敎員才能敎養出好的兒童來、才能爲社會宣力、</p>
<p>（三）　你們和别的師範學校不同在什麽地方、</p>
<p>我們相信生活即是敎育、所以整個的生活、即是整個的敎育歷程、學生在什麽環境襄就去尋來什麽樣的知識、要做什麽、便去學習什麽、乾脆地說、我們把書本當作工具、把講解改爲指導、所以一個學生到别的學校去是受敎育、到本校來却是過生活、這是第一點不同、本校師範科是初創、生活是處理、環境的改造、不單靠學校當局能處理妥善、一定要師生合力來建設的、所以一個學生到别的學校去是讀書、到本校來是創造、這是第二點不同、</p>
<p>（四）　學科的編制怎樣</p>
<p>關於學科的編制、我們分析成三項、第一是基本訓練、第二是政治訓練、第三是專業訓練、第一學年、側重基本訓練、凡普通學科、多半在這一年裏修畢第二學年則基本訓練與專業訓練並重第三學年側重專業訓練、而以改治訓練爲經、各學年都相等的注重、</p>
<p>我們參照敎育部的課程標準緬訂適合於本校環境的課程綱要、其持點就在伸縮的餘地多、學生能依照各人的材能、自由的求進、不受束縛、</p>
<p>（五）　實習的辦法怎樣、</p>
<p>小學是歸範的中心、小學敎育的設施、就是師範敎育的根据、我們主張師範生時、要與小學接觸、與小學生發生關係、普通歸範學校、到了末一學期的最後一兩個月、才到小學去實習、在師範學校三年中學得的學理、方法、到那時可說全無所用、全不是「那麽一回事」、所以我們主張師範生從第一學年起、就要到小學去、到了第三學年第二學期、完全去和小學生共同過生活、這樣、才不至於學理是學理、事實是事實、到小學去的程序如下圖、</p>
<p>第一學年　第二學年　第三學期</p>
<p>參觀　參與工作　實習</p>
<p>（六）　現在預備招收多少學生、</p>
<p>第一次最多只招收五十名、凡各地教育當局或願貯養師資、預備將來辦理小學敎育者、可以選派初中畢業生保送來校、本校當可給予相當便利、</p>

<h3>紀念日告同學書</h3>
<p>— 鄭洪年</p>
<p>全體同學：</p>
<p>今日爲本校創校二十五週年大學成立四週年紀念日；洪年撫今思昔，感從中來、敬掬至誠爲我朁南大學全體同學言之！夫民族競存，天演之理昭然；我先民遠航海澨、闢地南荒，中華文敎，遠曁絶域；以國勢不競、爲帝國主義者所乘，遂至人爲刀俎，我爲魚肉。今者時勢丕變，太平洋上風雲日急，美控其東、英扼其西，日踞其北，劍拔弩張，皆以南洋羣島爲其鵠的；昔當列强汲取財源之時，我僑胞得苟安「魚肉」，偷延殘喘、今值世界民族爭存决勝之際，我僑胞欲爲「魚肉」，且不可得。諸同學來自海外，百凡親歷身經，鞭笞之痕在背，腥紅之血斑然，涙猶盈頰，痛豈忘心！先賢謂，「天下興亡，匹夫有責」，爲全民族爭生死存亡之關頭，誰可卸此仔肩？觀近年華僑經濟之破產，回國僑生之遞减，危狀畢呈，覆亡何日！吾輩今日優遊講誦，尙有餘閑；更十年百年以往，南洋羣島與中華民族絶綠，皮之不存，毛將焉附？諸同學在校求學，應知講舍之外，環繞千百萬僑胞之眼珠；誦讀之聲，中寓千百萬僑胞之呼籲；在校多一日之蹉跎，在南洋即失百年之機會；在校多一人之暴棄，在僑胞即斷千百人之生命。故習俗流於頽廢，我曁南同學獨不可頽廢；習俗淪於壓世，我曁南同學獨不可厭世；自今以往，或絶摩登之風，或去物慾之蔽，堅其意志，瞱其智慧，强其體魄，然後返彼南島，喚醒我僑胞之民族意識，固結我僑胞之民族精神，提高我僑胞之民族文化，以與世界民族抗衡，使中華民族一躍而爲太平洋上之主人！此洪年所望於諸同學者一也！</p>
<p>吾校創設於滿清末葉，洪年親與於剏校之役，难時自端督以下，陳伯陶温秉忠諸先生贊助最力，海外則駐荷蘭公使錢念劬先生桴鼓相應，　路藍縷，粗具規模，由今言之，華僑敎育之當注重，已爲天經地義，不容或疑，爾時乃上遭清室之忌，中經延議之阻，下來宵小之誹，曁南生命得維持至辛亥而始中斷者亦云幸矣，民國肇造，曁南中停如故，及袁氏謝世，經黃炎培趙正平諸先生再三奔走，始獲重開，其後商科師範科初級中學南京女子部之增設，眞如校址之圈購，校舍之建築，皆趙正平先生之苦詣經營！甲子以還，變亂迭作，曁南得曲折前進，皆姜伯韓先生之力，民國十六年，國民革命軍初定蘇浙；曁南復有動摇之虞，洪年來荷重任，擴爲大學，故曁南今日一寸一尺之成就，皆前人點滴之所積，緬締造之艱難，誠維護之不容緩！夫敎育爲邦國百年大計，華僑敎育尤爲民族命脉所聚，洪年本之良心主張，爲華僑敎育戮力，四年來，幾更波折，終不忍所以撫育者付託匪人；即在今日，洪年仍覺曁南之基礎一日未固，即洪年之責任一日未了，酬答，先總理之願一日未償也，諸同學與洪年相處已久，知之素深：一言一動，務以學校爲前提；毋圖一己之私利，危學校之根本；逞一時之意氣。絶學校之前途：信褊激之邪說，斷學校之命脈；自愛所以愛人。愛學校所以愛僑胞，此洪年所望於諸同學者二也。</p>
<p>夫敵國外患。何代蔑有？家邦杌隉，世運常然，海宴河清之說，乃人羣設想云云，初無異於烏託邦也，今之靑年，呌囂往來，動曰救國家救社會，規其潛心學問，則曰社會安定而後可以研究學問，鳴呼！待河之清，人壽幾何？變亂之起，如環無端，交相諉則亂無已時，交相理則治可立待。立國於二十世紀之世界。其國學術不昌明而可以圖存者理所必無；今不潛心學術以溶其源，而曰『社會安定而後可以研究學問』，本末倒置。治絲益棼耳！昔拿翁宰割歐陸。普魯士遭其魚肉，如在昏夜，莫知其極：哲人費希特擔簦入柏林，講學於烽火之中，遂開德意志學術之先河。吾之於人。詎不相及？洪年長校以來。每相告語，曰「求學不忘救國。救國不忘求學」，今更進言之；「惟求學而後可以救國」。諸同學生長南洋，與世界文化接觸至多，他國學術現狀，當能洞知。如南洋問題之專著，求之荷籍，求之英籍，求之德法籍中，動輒千百種，即求之日籍，亦在千種以上。返觀吾國，研究此切身問題者有幾？研究有得，著爲專籍者有幾？旣有之，除稗販外籍而外，其果出自心裁者更有幾？痛癢所關者猶蒙昧若此，更遑論其大者遠者！若是則救社會救國家云者，皆紙上空談，何禆實效！自今以往，諸同學急宜埋首研究，舉凡標語傳單壁報等等不急之務，其可蠲者盡蠲之，集精神於一端，而後學術之精進可期，救國之願望可達。此洪年所望於諸同學者三也！</p>
<p>今之恒言，曰嚴守紀律。紀律云者，在家庭則當守子弟之紀律，則學校則當守學生之紀律，在國家社會則當守公民之紀律；所以共守、亦所以自律。諸同學或在大學，或在中學；其在中學，或在高中，或在初中。自初中至大學，歷時十年，自初中至高中，歷時亦六年；當智慧發展之期，六年十年，相去何啻一世紀。大學學生，知識已富，意志略定，理智足以自律，故言動可以自主。初中學生，年事方幼，閲歷有限，一舉一動，須待師長之指導。高中學生，則介於兩者之間，半任學生之自動，半賴師長之指導。諸同學遠離父兄，學校與家庭之聯絡較難，學校旣兼父師之職。自今以往，宜自知所處之時地，體學校愛護之本意，睦友尊師，共守紀律。中學學生猶宜自知在工具準備人格修養期中，應養成刻勵自勉之精神，以爲異日任重致遠之準備。此洪年所望於諸同學者四也！</p>
<p>洪年重任校長，復已四年，且垂垂然老矣！竭股肱之力，爲曁南立一基礎以報國家以答總理，私願以了，諸同學英年勵進，前程浩大，不獨僑胞所屬望，亦國人所共期，善體吾意，發揚光大，完成大業，有厚望焉！</p>

<p>主席校長鄭洪年致詞</p>
<p>主席鄭校長致開會詞，略謂今日爲本校剏校二十五週與大學成立四週紀念合併舉行、剏校日原爲三月念三·籌備大學完全爲六月十四，經校務會議决定在今天舉行典禮、也是四年前國民軍到蘇中央敎委會任兄弟到校接收之一日，今天請諸位參加紀念會、非常感激，回想本校從二十五年前以至現在，紀念詞上已說得很清楚、用不着再報告，今天要講的、就是本校的敎育、將要達到如何的地位、華僑敎育的最大目標，就是要做到以建民國、以建大同，並且爲建大同的先鋒隊、結果使僑胞父老自然而然的達到自由平等、我們要完全在學術上表現，使社會的確認識，知華僑敎育意義偉大，華僑足跡遍全球、他們美德、不但須發揮、並且要保存而光大之、（中略）今天並且舉行各院部畢業典禮、及慶祝體育歷届屢得錦標。</p>
<p>來賓致詞</p>
<p>（一）　黎照寰先生　略謂今天貴校舉行二十五週年和大學四週年完成之期、畢業典禮，同時舉行。鄙人應貴校長之命、前來參加，謹向諸位同學敬致數言。諸畢業同學自今天起，旣離學校之範圍，入社會之舞臺。欲以其所學爲國家之建設，爭世界上之自由，則其待决之問題，爲反問其心曰，「我有何貢獻於國家社會。」旣我入大學研究學問之目的何在。古之爲學者必抱特殊之志願，旣以終身爲窮理格物之從事也。孔子門徒三千。。皆爲社會各種問題與人類是非利害而努力。四書五經，皆本此旨。（下略）</p>
<p>（二）徐佩璜先生　略謂今天貴校之盛會足使人贊美者至多、畢業諸君與在校同學俱當乘此機會，念念於懷，接厲前進，益求發展，此則兄弟之至意，特畢業同學二事必須注意者，旣（一）大約同學在校時希望必大，立志必高，但社會環境無論國内國外，同此恶劣，故畢業同學一旦離校出而問世，偶受打擊，旣易灰心、流於頽廢，甚且同化於萬惡之社會，據調查所得，吾國人口二萬人中，只有一人爲大學生，以一人之力當一萬九千九百九十九之薰染，非有堅强之意志、不特不能改造社會，反足爲社會所改造，甚願畢業同學，出而化人。勿爲人所化。（二）服務社會公字當在私字之前，旣吾人作事先公後私也。總理之所謂「天下爲公」，外人常說中國人若散沙，人而如散沙，亦知私而不知公也。故甚願畢業諸君本此意旨，服務社會，以爲他人之表率。</p>
<p>（三）　潘序倫先生　略謂兄弟與本校關係深切，迂闊之言，無煩瑣瑣。本校可稱述者至多，特最足令人敬仰者，爲體育。在全國之大學中，無能比肩，</p>
<p>雖然體育者，不過爲智育德育體育美育羣育等之一種，暨南之德，智，美，羣四者，近年來皆有進步，特與體育之長足進步比，未免相形見拙矣。故此後尤望曁南體育更有長足之進步，不特在國内爭光榮，且在世界上展聲威。尤希望曁校德，智，美，羣四者與體育同其一日千里。今年爲廿五週年紀念，再過五年，則爲三十週年紀念，甚願吾之期望，得於斯時實現也，各同學其勉之。</p>
<p>陳仲凡先生代表敎職員致辭</p>
<p>略謂今日爲本校成立二十五週，大學四年完成之期，吾國敎育年齡，系統觀之，六歲入幼稚園，中經小學敎育中學敎育至二十四歲而大學敎育已完成，今爲本校二十五週年紀念，比此相例，旣同學脫離求智之時代，參加社會之時期，亦旣脫離理想之時代，投身實騐之時期，對茲景况可爲畢業諸君賀，亦可爲畢業諸君勵。</p>
<p>諸君在校皆爲純潔之靑年，平日所期無非理想，世人多謂理想已爲社會所溶化，然此不足慮。蓋吾人作事，第一要有理想，第二要有計劃，第三要有實騐。有理想始思發奮，有計劃始能按步就班，有實騐始能鑒别善惡。然其根本之要圖，則要有大志，所謂大志者，不可以個之利益之爲出發點，應以人類之幸福國家之競存爲前提。（下略）</p>

<h3>活體詩二節即用校長校慶韵</h3>
<p>— 張鳳</p>
<p>一團團益圓夢影。扶上少年頭。三唱荒雞天下白。一心中國老成謀。錦瑟長長絃廿五。絃絃彈出小春秋。表東風，大伯公。遺話遍炎洲</p>
<h3>昨見師座揮毫賦感當即取示天方先生於片刻間和成活體詩一章因於百忙中亦次原韵凑成一律</h3>
<p>— 李邦棟</p>
<p>竟日絃歌伸慶祝。撫躬一笑憶從頭。風雲自是平生願。耕耨由來先覺謀。慧業久經臻勝境。功勛如此足千秋。門牆我愧嫣紅小。欣看同枝遍九州。</p>

<h3>撞沉英艦或非毓大輪</h3>
<p>以公司及威海傳來消息爲證</p>
<p>新聲社云、英潛水艦拍斯登號、傳聞與本埠海昌輪船公司毓大輪相撞後、業已五日、海昌公司迄今仍未得有報告、因此懷疑莫釋、茲將昨日查得情形、分誌如下、</p>

<p>公司消息　記者又至海昌輪船公司探詢、據該公司張君談稱、前日得營口毓大輪船公司來電、知毓濟輪已開、並未提及毓大輪事、現據各方消息、可證明决非毓大輪、大約係毓在大經過肇事地點附近、代爲發電求救、圖南輪得電、因係毓大所發、以爲即係毓大、如係毓大、則旣未受傷、爲何不救、而即開營、况輪船相撞、如已船亦已受傷、不能救護、應即駛往附近海關報告、且毓大航線、不經過威海附近、此事俟十五日我、毓濟抵滬後、當可明悉一切詳情矣、</p>

<h3>神附程勳黑幕</h3>
<p>愚弄各界名流</p>
<p>以達歛錢目的</p>
<p>陸農士昨至本報函云、自從時報登載江灣探異記長篇社會新聞之後、上海遠近各方、莫不知江灣有程勳其人、神附其身、書聯作畫、一若果有所謂神鬼、活躍於科學文明集中之上海者然、據其司隠壇宣傳、尤爲光怪陸離、謂不但本市名流、竭力爲之提倡、即黨政機兹中人、亦經皈依壇下、此種宣傳、自不足信、良以破除迷信、爲本黨黨綱所定、現任黨政重要人員、决不提倡迷信、破壞黨紀也、顧報載市黨部之决議、及公安局之取締、尙未見諸實行、不侫爲好奇心所驅使、費半月光陰、親至江灣四次、探刺一切、眞相大白、欲揭個中黑幕、必先報告、</p>
<p>程勳之爲人　按程勳世居江灣、幼時受業於陸仁生之父陸寳裕老秀才之門、性頗聰慧、祇以清寒、未畢五經而輟學、經商之餘、常向老師執經問難、因爲對門鄰居也、昔年曾患大病、依照鄕愚慣例、向東嶽廟劉氏三神祝禱、病愈之後、信奉頗爲、在昔每年三月廿八日出會、程勳必爲首領、久而久之、程勳對於東嶽廟道士借神歛錢之方法、熟諳無餘、不覺由慕生羨、曾於某年乘出會之便、將三神偶移置西鎭牛郎廟、藉以要挾、道士大恐慌、密訂條件、遷回原處、此時之程勳、實已跳出迷信範圍、而入利用迷信之一途、其後迎神賽會、遭官廳之禁止、三月二十八日之出會、不克舉行、該廟道士、對於前訂條件、漸漸食言、勳乃大憤、欲再搬出神像、苦無機會、乃請攝影師向木偶攝得三影、移供家中、一面宣言三劉之神、夢告以道士無良、不願再至東嶽廟、而願盤桓程氏家中、鄕愚以程爲會首、且爲劉忠顯王之寄子、頗信之、但欲善男信女、拾偉大之神偶、而向渺小之影片、事實上極感困難、會於去年、有異鄕人薛姓父子、流落江灣、頗善繪事、乃招留爲師、（薛子現爲鄕金安痒案發判徒刑十二年、）勤習繪圖、將照片放大、彩繪神像三幅、裝裱懸接、以資吸引、並請陸仁生之子陸守一（衛生局登記之醫士）代神開方治病、人取香燭錢二角、而陸仁生以爲此種辦法、不脫妖巫窠臼、且所得有限、殊不合算、乃與知友刁浩春商議發財而不傷名之善法、要求程勳合作、於是金錢慾大熾、突於廢歷本年正月十六日、傳言神附程身、由陸仁生假區黨部宣傳處之地位、（按區黨部宣傳處設於陸家、即在程家對門、）竭力宣傳神靈之奇異、並由刁浩春聯絡社會人士、疏通黨政機關、邀往參觀、其</p>
<p>麻醉社會之方法　第一宣傳程勳不甚識字、以表靈異、其實程曾在去年搜求記載劉氏遺跡之書籍、編爲傳忠錄、並親作序文、頗可一誦、此種事實、已由程勳自登之廣告參證、第二預將被邀參觀人之姓名、由陸仁生擬定嵌字聯語、届時當衆書寫、以堅信仰、其後參觀索聯者日衆、有非預料所及人物光顧、則欲嵌不及、或强索之、則由程自撰、所以常有不通之聯語發現、按劉氏生前爲宋代學士、此種字跡、是否爲宋代之體格、大學士是否有不通之聯語、不值識者一笑、至其</p>
<p>歛錢方法　假借名人之提倡、以增其所謂墨寳之價值外、一面選擇富有之家、送聯送畫、然後以修廟爲辭、向之捐欵、上海富人目光中觀之、以劉忠顯王致送對聯、硃印殷然、並加上欵、稱兄道弟、受竉若驚、並可驅邪鎭宅、適投迷信者之所好、更聳於黨國要人派遣專使、恭求墨寳之謬說、自然樂於解囊、聞其所入、已不下五六萬金、現已撥出一小部分、將東嶽廟修理、以堅出資者之信仰、並向未捐者聲言、條廟費用、係由某君代墊、請求捐助、以便歸還、更由陸仁生召集各班會首二十餘人、每人派捐修廟費五百元、好在此種募捐、並無帪目可考、不難於中取利也、夫上海爲文明之中區、官廳林立、法治森嚴、此種鬼魅行爲、公然活動於靑天白日之中、何以不加取締、足爲悟隠壇有力之反證、足爲迷信者、增加確有神鬼之信仰、其實該壇確有</p>
<p>牽制官廳之技倆　其法維何、即廣邀參觀請求簽名爲第一步辦法、該壇旣陸刁規劃、組織之後、廣招名人前往參觀、所謂社會名人者、大都行動、更爲好奇心所驅使、旁人之慫恿、偶或抽㗇一往、以覘究竟、入門即令簽名、夫入門簽各、原爲各種社團之慣例、各名人日奔走於團體間、籨名爲其日常工作、自不介意、而不知該壇得之、大有作用、即以簽名者爲贊助該壇之證據、一翻其簽其名簿、上至本市黨政軍警機關主要長官、無不列入、其爲假冒、理可想見、此種簽名簿、實爲該壇之護符、直可使執行官廳命令之下級公務人員、見而一呆、例如近日社會局派員到壇調查、程勳即將簽名簿獻出、謂你們的局長是常來的、還要你來調查什麽、各機關主持人員、對於是項簽名簿中簽名人員、是否確曾親蒞該壇、見其大膽胡說、亦覺信疑差半、不便放手執行、該壇並向甲方說、乙方對於該壇、非常擁護、向乙方則謂、甲方如何信仰、終至甲乙以至兩丁各方、均爲朦蔽、而該壇則向衆宣傳、各方毫無問題、可以放膽進行矣、該壇自知所入太鉅、一旦澈查、將難了結、於是逐漸假借著名慈善家名義、發起捐欵、彼負其名、吾收其實、而各慈善家、慈善爲懷、對於各種慈善、向所贊助、自必樂於列名、受其利用、此種</p>
<p>别開生面之念秧　其方法之周密、實破上海各種念秧之最高紀錄、而成騙術奇觀、非得前清秀才陸仁生·民國名士刁浩春之擘劃、曷克臻此、若不揭穿黑幕、非但任令流毒社會、貽本黨之羞、且使眛者不察、以爲黨政要人、社會聞人、確有提倡迷信、參加許騙之事實、於政府威信、名流名譽、均有妨礙、是以謹敬揭幕、以告社會、</p>

<p>自由談世界小事記  海客　　倫敦伊斯林頓市Lslington最近舉行一種生　的獎勵。凡有人在本年六月八日禮拜一中午至千後一時之間同時生下三個孩子的。（即一胎三孩）那產母可得五千金鎊的獎金。　　南美洲阿眞廷國首者昆拿愛爾Bueno　Aires城中。有街頭載客的汽車。車價極廉。有低至二個便士的。以每英里計。也不到十個便士　　英王喬治。有鐘癖。其散在各處宮殿中的。不下千數。白京漢宮各處宮殿中的。不下千數。白京漢宮中。有一百六十隻。温則宮中有三百六十隻。都係珍品。内中最名貴的。是一隻小鐘。是享利王八世與他的戀人安痕蒲琳Anne　Boleyn結婚時的信物。據說價值一萬金鎊。　　一九三○年至三一年間全世界棉花的收穫。計共二千五百五十萬大包。而大半屬於美國。中國雖以產棉稱。却也望塵莫及。　　倫敦弼林斯甘。Billingsgate是英國有名大魚市。市中的守者。都戴一種特製的帽。造得極爲堅固。計需皮革五磅。蠟棉十二碼。釘子四百隻訟則終凶  秋水　　常言道。訟則終凶。打官司本是一件可爲而不可爲的事。這非但足以破壞雙方的感情。而其費用之浩大。有時竟會超過訴訟標的物的價額數百倍。所得難償所失。訴訟这實益。究意在那裏呢。這裏有幾個名貴的故事。寫在下面。以爲健訟者告。　　名貴的證言　最近在英國高等法院裏審訊的一件百萬鎊支票。在法律上言固爲年來最關重要之案件。即就其費用言。亦屬駭人聽聞。案中有一證人。爲葡萄牙一銀行職員。法院認其有到庭作證之必要。遂下令傳訊。此人到庭陳述。計一百四十九字。四分鐘即行畢事。然其費用總額包額來往英葡旅費。一個月的旅館費以及雜項支出。與其所說的話平均計算。每個字的費用的竟達七先令之鉅。又數年前英國有「勃靈司魏」一案。案中有一重要證人。爲一荷蘭大公司之經理。住居於遠離英倫一萬二千英里以外的南洋爪哇。奉命到庭陳述。供言費時十四分鐘。而其費用則爲八百金鎊。按到庭陳述證言。爲國民應有之義務。除疾病年老或有其他特别情形外。無論何人。苟奉法院傳諭。必須到庭。費用之多寡。在所不論。好在一切必要費用。均有訴訟當事人之一方負擔。不必由證人自己挖腰包。這兩位名貴的證人。實未嘗有若何之損失。　　八天的辯論　在大案件中。所費的金錢。關係於證人。者。實占一小部分而已。譬如在英國委魏鸞訴魯威一案中。我們即可知法庭之上用錢亦等於流水。本案當事人。延聘三個大律師。公費每人一千金鎊。出庭費每人每天一百金鎊。其中一律師名卡爾生者。在本案開審的當兒。曾滔滔辯論至八天之久。而一個重要證人居留於法庭上者亦十一天。庭上以速寫紀錄本案供詞。所費達三千金鎊。所以本案終結之後。兩造當事人所費的總數計八萬金鎊。超出於訴訟標的物者。計值一萬七千餘鎊。豈非冤枉。又有一次。有一個製造廠訴某工程師。請求賠償金額三千五百三十五金鎊。此案經五十五天的審訊。方告終結。證人之被傳到庭者。爲數共六十人。所答的各項問話。爲數及二萬六千二百五十二個。全案費用爲一萬九千九百金鎊。亦屬少見。　　空前的巨案　更有甚於此者。某年英國有某煤鐵公司訴林肯公司違背契約。請求賠償金鎊一萬五千。八天以後。兩方當事人。以費用浩大。計算起來每分鐘需費三金鎊十先令。於是大澈大悟。連忙退庭和解了事。又有一次。爲英國的國家電話公司訴郵政局一案。開審之時。各項公文書證之提出於法院者。計重三噸。電話公司之工程師佛蘭克奇爾君爲本案之證人。答問二千五百次。居留於法庭上者十一天。所用各種的印刷品及速記費。達三千金鎊。七十一天以後。方告了結。而所費已達三十五萬九千五百金鎊。每小時平均約需六百金鎊。好在這筆訴訟費用。是由國庫支出。否則誰有這樣財力來負擔呢。海上之乞匄  洯廬　　上海爲營業繁盛之區。大槪乞匄亦爲營業而來。初非跛癃盲唖不得已而爲乞匄也。然壯年者可爲綁匪殺猪玀之勾當。專營乞匄業者。以年幼及老媪爲夥。年幼者滬人所謂『小癟三。』以拾荒·掱兒手。拉車過橋·倒包飯。爲其每日服務社會之例行工作。早起于于。夜夢遞遞。宴如也。然此輩小笢匄頗具智巧。蓋亦腦力勞工而非腕力勞工也。前日早晨偶行民國路中。見一婦人手提一筐。中貯魚肉等物。姍姍而來。一八九歲之兒童突伸小手。　其筐中之魚肉。擲之身後。即見年稍長者。拾而擲諸其後之年復長者。轉瞬間。此婦人筐中之魚肉。已不脛而走至三五丈以外矣。婦人初不得知。三五小乞匄。亦各跳躍自去。予遥觀而嘆曰。使此等兒童而受以優良之敎育。豈皆在劣等生之列。而不能造就乎。予嘗乘海舶返鄕。輒見有如干鵠面鳩形之靑年。巡閲海舶中。引其頸而東西探望。若覓其至友也者。初甚疑之。後見此輩鵠面鳩形者。往往與官艙房艙之客相交談。且往往呼客曰哥。曰伯。匄得三五角銀幣。狼狽而去。去後客皆嘆曰。此吾友某公之子也。此吾家某君之侄也。當其父在時。擁資數十萬。所謂少爺公子是也。今則後奇墮落如此。良可喞哉。今日滬甬輪中。多此輩人。溯其歷史。岡不富有。徒以昔年嫖賭烟酒。揮霍已甚。遂流爲卑田院中之人物。念舟中闊綽之世交必多。於是遂發明求乞之方。日獲一二金。初匪難事。黃歇浦畔。一枕烟霞。以度其末路王孫之生涯矣。然此輩苟能自新。不難自立。徒以媮惰性成。宴安鳩毒。而不可捄也。莊生曰。吾以天地爲棺槨。日月爲含燧。若而人者。其抱莊生之人生觀者乎。匪敢知已。噫。中日畫展之榮譽  海士　　余客滬數載。久耳紅薇居士名。而未獲識面。嘗於友人處得讀其畫。知其作品有價值。宜爲海内外人士所共賞也。頃讀報。登日本昭和皇太皇。特賞紅薇居士畫。選而購之去。誠爲難能而可貴矣。聞紅薇居士之畫題。爲岸柳吟蟬。想見其意境之高曠。風韻之潇灑。定能脫盡脂粉氣。不食人間烟火者矣。夫以日本之皇族。素以尊嚴自居。此次中日開古今繪畫展覽會。日皇太后蒞會參觀。紆尊屈駕遍覽吾國畫幀。購南北畫家之作品。共復遍覽贊詞。已爲畫展不經見之事。猶四軸。而尤注意於紅薇居士之一畫。是時凝神佇視。歷數小時。可見日皇太后之心有所契。目光所囑。超越恒流。以一極尊貴之人。而購一極名貴之畫。實劍贈烈士。黃金贈美人。中外所見略同。不誠然歟。夫以吾國固有之文藝。至今日而神靈歇絶。今幸有海上名畫家。猶能發揚吾國之國粹。表現民族之精神。以與競爭世界作翰墨之戰勝。豈非藝術之遺緒。賴以不墜耶。况以紅薇居士。爲巾幗中之名流。能得彼邦皇族。龍睞有加。其聲譽之所播。豈第鷄林價重而已哉。獨是吾國當局。亦知藝術之可珍。日日言提倡文化。然未聞有於某畫會中。賁臨一覽者。較之彼帮皇族。能無遜色。吾甚希望吾國當局。亦如日政府之重視藝術。提倡而振興之。獎勵而鼓舞之。使社會一般人士。咸趨重於美術化。以爲吾國民族亨無上之光榮。是誠吾國藝術前途之幸。不獨畫展一會之榮而已也。（不受酬）響拓三代秦漢玉印譜自序  方介堪　　古之鈢印。以昭信也。周季文字競奇。金玉雜佩。秦并天下。始有定制。執政用玉。百官皆銅而私印雖有用玉者。然非名公巨卿。不得佩也。顧自周秦以來。文字制度。代有改易。惜無專書詳述其沿革之由。年代湮遠。考訂良難。六朝陳隨之間。制度雜糅。字體乖繆。即古　　印文之法。亦蕩然無傳。宋人之集印史。事在草創。書皆木刻。奇文古字。莫可辨别。由是遺規餘緒。日益荒廢。至明陳諮下潘源常輩。力救木刻弊。易以石　。亦僅得其形似。蓋古者。鈢印之工。皆爲一代文字精神之所寄託。其奇古偉麗渾檏豪邁之氣。固非頑石所能慕仿也。予嘗考索。宣和印史」「集古復本」「印藪」「印統」「印集」「印范」「印存」諸書。其中玉壐私印。不下數百方。其物四散。久如威鳳祥麟。不可復得。予旣素嗜研求。平時所見。必分條辨異。選而撫之。至形神畢肖而後已。今存其尤善者。三百餘印。分爲十二類。中如「左公車宮」「右司徒」皆周時官制。「霸昌君」「兇奴相邦。」皆秦以上物。可補史傳百官表之闕。九字吉語。「壽成」諸印。則是漢物。其他文字歧出。近於甲。骨。鐘。鼎。石。鼓。陶。幣。瓦。當。碑。碣。銘文者。多有之。或爲說文所無。或與說文略有異同者。如　。蓋。　。晸。　。勦菒。可。增許書姓譜之佚。坐作举。產作產。膚作膚。貿作貿。可證說文大徐本傳寫之誤。此諸印文。皆未見他書。尤爲難得而可貴。又鳥篆蟲書。結體本出大篆。秦以上蓋已有之。或謂始於漢代。且言殳篆即繆篆者。皆爲誤斷。此外如顧氏從德所藏。「歡武」「長信」「孫坤」申徒朗」「淳于蒲蘇」等百餘印。皆名著當時。最爲精確。惜隆慶間毁於火。元印大半灰燼。此其初拓善本。魯殿靈光。蓋僅有之珍已。暛乎。印人學業。獨擅神州。發端蓋遥。末流遂失。尊一族藝文之美。磾四年整理之功。衰成此書。留之響拓。私衷欣慰。非可言宣。夫玉質堅貞。文多光采。於金石之外。别見妙造。况資助於地理歷史文字雕刻學之參訂者尤多。豈僅一時昭信而已哉。說部扶輪會三個時代（六）  張恨水　　張小三檢了一根取燈兒。（火柴也）在地上亂畫着。然後將取燈兒向伊身上抛了來。笑道。「呔。咱們講和了。成不成。窩頭蒸透了。也該拿出來吃了。」張二嫂見丈夫完全軟化了。伊更是得勁。哼了一聲道。「窩頭。那是老娘一個人吃的」。張小三道。「你眞不給我吃。往後你别打算吃我的」。張二嫂將衣襟當扇子。越扇得厲害。冷笑一聲道。「往後不打算吃你的。這就嚇着我了。作官的爺們找不着。拉車的爺們也找不着嗎。我一千個不給。你怎麽着以。張小三突然站起來道。「你不給我吃就不成。雜種……」他話不曾說完。扯了張二嫂一隻袖子。就住旁邊一拉。打算把伊拉開。就去搶那鍋窩頭。張三嫂恰是不怕。兩手張開。將路攔着。瞪了眼道。「好雜種。你敢搶我的」。張小三兒見搶不着。伸開一掌。就向伊臉上打來。這一巴掌。猶之開動了話匣子的發條。伊立刻哇的一聲哭將出來道。「好小子。你打我。我不要命了」。一手抓住張小三的褲帶。低了頭。向他的肚子上撞將過來。張小三只一偏。伊控了個四支貼地。伊不起來了。在地下就打着滚。口裏亂哭亂嚷道。「我不尖着了。我不活着了。救命啦救命啦」。這一嚷。全院子院鄰都跑了來。大家早知道不過是爲了幾個窩頭的事。勸的勸。拉的拉。把張小三拉着走了。他身上還有一百五十個子。實在也不一定要吃幾個窩頭。自己上澡堂子裏洗了個澡。到二葷劒裏吃了一斤白麵條子。肚子飽飽的。又上茶館子裏聽書去。晚上高高興興回來。見自己屋門倒關上。裏面漆黑。推門進去。點燈一看。坑上扔下些碎東西。一隻破木箱子，倒在地上。小舗蓋捲兒。和好一點的東西。全不見了。他的媳婦和那些東西一樣。全不知道在那兒。只有起禍的根苗。那一屜子窩頭。和籠屜全放在桌上。張小三道。「好貨。他跑了。他天天說不跟拉洋車的。倒是眞話呢」。他一嚷。院鄰又來了。大家紛亂了一陳子。四處找了一陳。都沒踪影。有人勸張小三到警區去報案。張小三道。「警察總是和拉洋車的過不去的。我能找出多大的理來。他說我掙錢爲什麽不養媳婦。也許那歪貨還跑出一擋子理來。誰讓我沒能耐。當了膠皮團。媳婦跑了。也是活該。我不找他了。」於是這幾個窩頭。就犠牲了他一個媳婦。從道日起。他成了個鰥夫了。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At today's plenary session, Zhang Ji reported in detail on his experiences in Guangdong. He said that he had spoken frankly with everyone in Guangdong, explaining earnestly that civil war must not be started again and that the foundation of the country must not be shaken again. Most of the people were moved, especially after Chiang's telegram arrived, the impression gained by the Guangdong side was very deep. During Zhang's report, he wept bitterly, and the whole audience listened attentively. In summary, both Wang and Tang in Guangdong are extremely peaceful, but Gu, Chen, and Sun still need to be awakened. Subsequently, he reported on Chen Mingshu's twelve telegrams, which described in great detail the situation in Guangdong and the analysis of the attitudes of various factions. It can be decided that the solution to Guangdong should be consistently achieved through political means. Sun Ke's position as a member of the Central Committee will not be mentioned for the time being. One seat on the National Government Committee will be changed with the new organic law. As for the new organic law, it must go through the procedures of the Legislative Yuan as usual, so it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the National Government. Subsequently, the suppression of communists was discussed, and many members gave speeches. Zhu Peide said that in the documents about the suppression of communists, one cannot say how terrible the communists are. This matter may actually be propaganda for them. Also, the government should be slightly humble and admit some blame for the delay in resolving the Jiangxi bandits, so as to seek understanding from the people. Everyone agreed.

<h3>Domestic Political Issues in European Countries</h3>
<p>The rumor that important figures from Britain and the United States were going to Germany for a meeting to solve the major problem of the economic crisis once showed signs of activity, but now the news has subsided. This is because the governments of the countries responding to the problem are unwilling to easily express their opinions, and also because the governments of the countries are too busy dealing with domestic problems to care. For example, the opposition of various parties in Germany to the emergency orders is gradually intensifying. Although it has eased slightly, Brüning still insists on his position, saying that he will use the survival of the emergency orders as the standard for his personal advancement and retreat. Therefore, it is feared that the hope of reconciliation will be difficult to realize for a while. After the British Liberal Party proposed the land tax amendment, the situation was tense for a time. Yesterday, Labor Party cabinet members and important figures from the Liberal Party held a round table meeting in the hope of avoiding affecting the political situation. Although it is said that there has been progress in the talks, it is still necessary to wait for the final decision of the Liberal Party Congress. Therefore, the hope of calming the political storm cannot yet be determined. Since the anti-religious trend in Italy began, it has aroused the public anger of all Catholics. The Roman Pope is also very persistent. Although mediation is underway, the two sides are still in stalemate and will not be easily resolved for a while. As for France, the new and old presidents are in the process of transition. Although politics will not be interrupted, there will inevitably be a busy period of welcoming the new and sending off the old. All major issues must also be discussed with the new president. Therefore, diplomatic news between countries is relatively silent.</p>

<h3>German Political Storm Eases</h3>
<p>The Civil Party Stops Calling for Congress</p>
<p>Ambassadors Stationed Abroad Summoned Back Home</p>
<p>Report on the Attitudes of Various Countries Regarding Reparations</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 13th The German government has asked the ambassadors stationed in the United States, Italy, and America to return to Berlin as soon as possible to report to the government on the opinions of their stationed countries regarding reducing reparations. Only the ambassador stationed in Britain was not recalled, because the German government already knew the British government's attitude towards this matter when the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister traveled to Britain. Today, Prime Minister Brüning met with President Hindenburg, and then talked with the leaders of various political parties. As a result, the political storm of the Civil Party's demand for an immediate convening of Congress is expected to be resolved. Brüning, with the assistance of the President, has clearly stated that he would rather resign than agree to convene Congress. It is heard that the Civil Party has agreed to stop the demand. At the same time, the Prime Minister expressed his intention to ease the Social Party by being willing to study reducing the difficulties caused by the implementation of emergency orders, but only to the extent that it does not hinder fiscal revenue.</p>
<p>The National Society Berlin, 13th A trend of competing to purchase foreign currency has recently occurred in Germany. Foreign capitalists are competing to recall capital from Germany and sell German securities. The Deutsche Bank has spent gold marks and foreign currency amounting to 75 million since the 1st of this month, and yesterday was the most enthusiastic. Today it has weakened slightly. In view of this situation, the General Committee of the Deutsche Bank has specially decided to increase the discount rate for promissory notes from 5% to 7% (according to this, it is the highest interest rate since the German currency was fixed). It is expected that after this increase, the commercial business in the market will inevitably stagnate, but there is no way to save it. The reason for this trend is not due to changes in the economic situation within Germany, but to foreign countries over-believing rumors about German internal affairs, especially the Americans. The Deutsche Bank is still confident that it can maintain control.</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, 14th According to Deputy Secretary of State Cassell, who told reporters today that if the war debt issue becomes urgent at any time, the United States will necessarily consider whether to temporarily change its war debt policy that has already been clearly announced.

<h3>Inauguration of the New French President</h3>
<p>Term of Office is Seven Years</p>
<p>Laval Cabinet Continues to Serve</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 13th - Doumer officially assumed the office of President of the French Republic this afternoon. Premier Laval immediately submitted the resignation of his cabinet as per custom. Doumer retained him, and the Premier has agreed to stay on. Outgoing President Doumergue will spend his remaining years as a citizen. He was born in 1863 and initially worked as a lawyer, later serving in places like Vietnam. In 1910, he was elected as a senator and belonged to the radical faction. His tenure as president was well-received by the people. He skillfully used his influence to sway politics, rarely matched by previous presidents other than Poincaré and others. After the new President Doumer took office, General Lubin, the honorary military chief of staff, presented him with the Grand Cross of the Red Ribbon. Shortly after, the old and new presidents rode in the same car, escorted by a cavalry, to the Palais de la Ville. Here, Doumer received a gold medal from the people of Paris. The crowds along the way were extremely large, and cheers erupted as the new president passed by. The new president's term of office is seven years.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 13th - The handover ceremony between the old and new French presidents was held this afternoon, with simple procedures and no oaths or other formalities. The new President Doumer departed from the Luxembourg Palace of the Senate, accompanied by Premier Laval in a two-horse carriage, followed by two squadrons of cavalry, and entered the Presidential Palace. The outgoing President Doumergue led the Presidential Palace officials, government officials, and members of Congress to greet him in the main hall. Then, each delivered a short speech. The outgoing president bid farewell to his colleagues, thanking them for their assistance. The new president announced his inauguration, expressing his hope for national peace and security during his term. The two presidents then shook hands and retired to a side hall. The new president only received the red ribbon of leadership of the honorary rank, struck on his chest, which is the sole emblem of the French presidential authority. There is also the grand collar of the honorary rank, with gold medals listing the emblems of major cities in the country, the names of previous presidents, and the graphics of agriculture, industry, and commerce of the times. Outside the palace, twenty-one gun salutes were fired, and the national anthem was played. Subsequently, the two presidents signed the handover documents and then rode in an open car to the City Hall. Foreign envoys and senior officials of the country successively offered congratulations. The two presidents each gave speeches, toasted with champagne, and signed the golden book of the city of Paris. The ceremony was completed, and they returned.</p>

<h3>Changes in Sino-Russian Conference</h3>
<p>Karakhan's Contents of Redemption Road Counterproposal</p>
<p>Mo Dehui Argues Righteously Without Results</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Sino-Russian conference had scheduled the eighth meeting to open on June 1st. However, Karakhan, dissatisfied with our side's response to the Redemption Road counterproposal at the seventh meeting, sent someone to see Mo Dehui the night before, claiming that his old illness had recurred and requesting a postponement to June 4th for the eighth meeting. Mo replied by letter agreeing. On June 4th, the eighth meeting opened at 6:00 PM. Karakhan led the entire team of special commissioners and secretaries to the venue only in the second half of the hour and immediately convened the meeting as scheduled. Without waiting for Mo's agreement, Karakhan declared that he would discuss the changes to the current system of the China Eastern Railway and the alteration of the management regulations of the East Railway. Mo Dehui stood up to object, arguing that it was not the original agenda and that the Redemption Road issue should be continued. Karakhan refused, saying that the Redemption Road required a pre-determined amount of funds. If China could determine a certain amount of funds for the Redemption Road and announce it to the world, then the valuation process could proceed. Once the price was determined, then China could discuss what kind of method should be used to redeem the road and what kind of method the Soviet Union would use to grant it. Since this issue was being discussed, the Chinese government had to pay attention to the pre-determined points. When Karakhan spoke, he also supplemented the Redemption Road counterproposal with several written points. In addition to the previous five points, many exceeded the scope of the topic. In terms of facts, they were all things that our side did not want to do and could not promise. Mo Dehui argued fiercely because the Russian side really intended to create difficulties in the meeting. After three hours, no results were obtained. Finally, Karakhan also proposed changing the management regulations of the East Railway and the current system. His proposal stated that since China had no cash to redeem the road and did not designate a certain income as a guarantee for the Redemption Road, this issue could be temporarily unanswered. However, the current value of the East Railway's business was declining, and many cuts and layoffs could not be saved. The current policy was to abolish both the Board of Directors and the Board of Supervisors. In terms of authority, it could avoid the administrative conflicts between the Board of Directors, the Board of Supervisors, and the Audit Bureau of the Management Bureau in the past. In terms of cost savings, it could also reduce the annual expenditure by eight million yuan. All deliberative bodies would not be set up separately, but the Director of the Management Bureau would convene meetings of the Chinese and foreign directors to discuss and decide by a majority vote. The Director's authority would not be increased, but the handling of affairs would take simplified procedures to achieve rapid results. Mo Dehui argued that Karakhan's proposal was outside the issue of the East Railway Redemption Road. The Redemption Road was the pre-determined issue, and all disputes of the East Railway were related to it. Moreover, the meeting had been held several times, so how could the agenda be changed midway and create unnecessary complications? Therefore, he refuted it strongly. As a result, the debate lasted another hour. At around 10:00 PM, it dispersed without results. The ninth meeting was scheduled by both parties to open at 4:00 PM on June 11th. The agenda has not yet been determined. This time, the Russian side suddenly changed its attitude and put forward other proposals, which obviously had other effects. The next meeting may be more argumentative than this one. As for the special commissioners Tu Wei Zeng and Wang Zeng En, who returned home to report, they arrived in Ping from Beijing on the 2nd of this month and are waiting for Zhang Xueliang's instructions. It is said that they will go to Harbin before the 15th to meet with special commissioner Zhang Shou Zeng and secretary Cai Yun Chen to go to Russia. The Eastern Special Superintendent's Office has prepared European-Asian traffic exemption tickets for their use. (June 10th)</p>
<h3>Atrocities of Koreans in Andong</h3>
<p>One Chinese Killed, More Than Ten Injured</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: Shen Yuanhe, the Korean branch manager of the Korean Dong-A Ilbo stationed in this port, recently proposed holding a foot-playing competition (similar to a sports meeting). With the permission and support of the Korean Association's executives, a preparatory meeting was held at the Korean Association at the end of last month. It was decided on the spot that it would be held on the 7th of this month in the Guangchang at the eastern foot of Zhenjiang Mountain outside the city. The Korean Association then sent letters to major ports in the country, inviting athletes to Andong to participate. By the 5th of this month, athletes from Kyungsung, Incheon, Pyongyang, Zhennampo and other places in Korea had responded to the invitation and arrived in Andong, no less than 400 people. After the competition ended on the 7th, athletes from various places gathered on Zhenjiang Mountain, in the depths of the forest, under the open sky, indulging in drunken revelry, and dispersed in a drunken stupor. By this time, the electric lights were shining brightly. Four athletes from Kyungsung, including Pu, wandered around and broke into the Aiqintang, a third-class brothel in Dayantong Hutong. Because of language barriers and simple reception, they angered the athletes and argued with each other. They were dissuaded and left by other tourists. It is unknown how they became angry with the Chinese again. Before long, they gathered more than 300 athletes from various places and wantonly beat the Chinese along Sanfantong. No one who encountered them was spared. At this time, Jing Yiyun, a Chinese worker living in Erfantong 2-chome, was working in Sinuiju and returned home to recuperate from illness. He went out for a walk that night and happened to encounter the thugs. They swarmed up and punched and kicked him. He fell to the ground and died. At the same time, Zhang, an artist from the Yushengyuan Restaurant, went out to deliver food and was also injured in the left eye on the way. No less than a dozen other Chinese were injured at the same time. At this time, the Japanese police on duty at the Hongqiao police station rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and used force to stop them. They then dispersed the group and arrested four of the leaders on the spot and sent them to the Japanese police station for questioning. The next morning, the Japanese police station sent people to the scene to examine the body of the deceased and saw that he was covered with injuries and his scrotum was broken, which was the fatal wound. The deceased's younger sister has asked the Chinese negotiator in Andong, Chinese Street, to appeal for justice for her brother. The results are unknown. (June 10th)</p>
<h3>Jilin's Changchun Korean People Forcibly Reclaiming Rice Paddies Case</h3>
<p>Our Side Has Lodged Two Protests</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Korean people of Wanbaoshan, Xiang San District, Changchun, gathered to forcibly reclaim rice paddies and refused to stop. Ten principals, including Shen Yongjun, were detained and sent to the Japanese consulate for extradition by the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office. They were also forced to disband. The situation was reported yesterday. It is now learned that the Korean people still resisted the order and continued to work, and there were Japanese police protecting them. The Municipal Office sent another letter to the Japanese consulate on the 4th to protest, requesting that it be stopped immediately. The letter stated that the Koreans in Wanbaoshan, Xiang San District, Changchun, forcibly dug up good farmland of civilians and diverted the water of the Yitong River. After repeated stops, they still stubbornly refused to stop working and openly constituted criminal acts. Yesterday, the Changchun County Public Security Bureau brought ten criminal offenders, including Shen Yongjun, to be extradited, and requested that Li Xichang and other nine main offenders who instigated the forcible occupation of civilian land and directed the digging of ditches be strictly investigated and dealt with according to law to uphold the law and order and quell public anger. It is estimated that it is invited to be bright.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Zhang Er Zhang</p>
<p>Home, but according to a report from the Changchun County Government, there are now more than 100 Korean people who are continuing to forcibly dig ditches, and Kawagawa, a Japanese police officer from your consulate, is leading several police officers, ostensibly to protect the Koreans, but actually supervising the progress, which is clearly helping the criminal acts. It is very surprising. The act of committing crimes is something that any country must stop and report. Although the countries that make up human society have different names, they are all composed of humans with blood and spirit, and there is no difference. Recently, we have repeatedly advocated a friendly policy. For the best solution to disputes between the people of both sides, both sides should easily consider the other's position and use forgiveness as a guide. Furthermore, on the basis of the disputes between the two sides, standing in the position of a third party, and making a fair judgment based on conscience, then all disputes can be fundamentally resolved. I have followed this path in resolving this case. Your consul has always been based on the principle of justice and fair handling of incidents related to both sides. Your views must also be the same. I hope that you will immediately order the dispatch of police officers to be recalled immediately, and strictly instruct the Korean people who are forcibly digging civilian land and committing crimes to immediately stop working to avoid disputes. All the current offenders, please refer to the previous letter and deal with them according to law, and give me a quick reply. It is also heard that this matter was caused by Hao Yongde, the Korean leader, who privately established the Changnong Rice Paddy Company in Toudaogou, colluded with the Japanese side to send a large number of Korean people, carried out riots, and had Japanese police protection. It is obvious that they have the ambition to seize national land and implement colonialism. (June 6th)</p>
<h3>Regarding Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations in the Eastern Provinces</h3>

<p>| A Total of Forty-Three Cases Occurred |</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The date for the commencement of discussions regarding the Sino-Japanese railway issue in the Eastern Provinces is rumored to be near. Guo Xurun, Commissioner of the Jichang and Jidun Railways, who had previously gone to Ping to consult with Gao Jiyi regarding the discussion date, returned to Shenyang on the evening of the 7th. Although the scope of this meeting only includes two items—"changing the engineering costs owed by various Japanese contractors on various railways to loans" and "revising freight rates on various railways in the same area and ensuring no price competition in the future"—it is feared that some of the long-standing Sino-Japanese cases in the Eastern Provinces will also be discussed at this meeting. Taking this opportunity, we have specifically investigated the years, months, articles, and titles of negotiations related to Sino-Japanese railways in the Eastern Provinces from the 31st year of Guangxu to the 18th year of the Republic, totaling forty-three cases, for the reference of those concerned about the Sino-Japanese railway issue in the Eastern Provinces.</p>

<h3>Proposal for Unified Management of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>New Propositions of the Shandong River Commission</p>
<p>Eliminating the Malpractice of Provincial Governance</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River has been a scourge since ancient times. The state has established officials to manage the river, which has varied from dynasty to dynasty. However, the method of provincial governance has been practiced for the longest time. Although the responsibility lies with the provinces, numerous malpractices have arisen that cannot be fully described. For example, the River Affairs Bureau is one of the administrative organs. Every time the director is replaced, the situation changes completely, and river management personnel are often unable to apply their knowledge. Also, when the river breaches in province A and affects province B, the blame is often shifted, which is common. Ge Xiangyi, a member of the Shandong River Works Committee, advocated unified national management of the Yellow River in order to achieve concrete management. He proposed and passed the proposal at the River Works Committee, and it was submitted to the provincial government. At today's (12th) provincial government meeting, it was brought up for discussion and resolved to submit it to the central government for handling. If it can be implemented, it will be a major reform in river management. The original text of Ge Xiangyi's proposal is recorded as follows: "It is found that among the rivers in our country that harm local areas, there is the Huai River in the south and the Yellow River in the north. In recent years, the discussion of guiding the Huai River has been very high, but there is no concrete plan for managing the Yellow River. The Yellow River is very harmful after entering the three provinces of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan. The danger of breaches cannot be avoided every year. The reason is certainly not one-sided, but the lack of connection between provincial governance is the main cause of the disaster. A detailed explanation is as follows: (1) Personnel Issues: River management requires specialists, especially those who have been in the position for a long time to be effective. Provincial governance often involves river affairs due to changes in the provincial government, making it difficult to obtain specialists or to keep them in the position for a long time. (2) Responsibility Issues: The Yellow River is tens of thousands of miles long, and it is divided into sections for management, each not belonging to the other. The situation is that province B sits idly by when province A is in danger, and province A sits idly by when province B is in danger. For example, Liuzhuang is a dangerous project in Hebei, and Zhukou is a dangerous project in Shandong. They are only a few miles apart. Whenever there is danger in Liuzhuang, Shandong does not care. Whenever there is danger in Zhukou, Hebei does not care. There is no mutual assistance between them. What can be expected of the future of river works? (3) Funding Issues: Funding is the most important thing for river management. Often province A has projects but no funds, and province B has funds but no projects. There is no accommodation between them, and the local area is still harmed. (4) Interest Issues: In provinces with boundary disputes, there are often projects in province A that harm province B. If the responsible province has no vested interest, it is difficult to allocate funds, resulting in accidents. For example, the work on the south bank of the Hebei project is in Hebei and harms Shandong. The Hebei provincial government does not pay much attention to this. The five breaches in recent years have all been due to this. Based on the above situation, it is difficult to ensure the safety of river works no matter how one tries to manage it on its own. Moreover, river management should be done once and for all, and water conservancy should be revitalized to turn misfortune into blessing. It is difficult to start without unifying the entire river. It is now proposed that this committee submit a report to the provincial government and forward it to the national government to unify the Yellow River and bring it under national management. The national government will appoint a high official to supervise the matter. The labor funds of each province will be converted into collaborative funds. If the amount is insufficient, the national funds will be used to supplement it so that the overall situation can be planned and danger can be turned into safety. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly." (12th)</p>
<h3>Strike of Tianjin Haihe Workers</h3>
<p>Demand for the Recovery of the Haihe Bureau is Very High</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tianjin Haihe River is the tail end of the five major rivers in North China. In recent years, due to the large amount of sediment carried by the Yongding River from the upper reaches, it has accumulated in the Haihe River, causing it to silt up. During the 16th and 17th years of the Republic, due to excessive siltation, all large and small merchant ships were anchored outside Tanggu Port, which almost became a major problem in the north. Therefore, when Shang Zhen was in charge of Hebei, he established a Haihe River Regulation Committee, but its achievements were minimal and its waste was huge, which was criticized by the general public. The Haihe River Engineering Bureau originally merged with the Haihe River Regulation Committee to manage Haihe River affairs, but the power of the bureau was completely controlled by foreigners, and the recovery failed. It still cooperates in division of labor. In March of this year, the bureau's employees requested a salary increase due to the disparity in treatment between Chinese and foreign employees. The bureau used high-pressure tactics to subdue all employees. The workers were very angry and announced a strike on the 7th of this month. There are more than 500 employees in the bureau. After the strike, the workers still went to work as usual and organized a maintenance team to maintain order. Their attitude is firm, and they will not resume work unless their demands are met. Currently, the bureau's affairs are only handled by the secretary-general Gan Bole (British). When the turmoil occurred, the bureau summoned the American Consul Gauss, the Hai Customs Commissioner Han Linsheng, the President of the Foreign Chamber of Commerce Guisi, the Managing Director of China Merchants Bureau Chen Juxi, and convened a board meeting. The results of the discussion have not yet been released. However, both sides are very persistent. According to the opinions of the party and government authorities, the strike not only hinders public security, but also adversely affects the work of the Haihe River. It is planned to convene relevant agencies to mediate. At the same time, some people believe that the Haihe River Engineering Bureau is funded by our country every year, but the power is lost, and there is no right to manage it. They advocate taking the opportunity to recover the bureau. It is found that the bureau was established in the 23rd year of Guangxu when Wang Wenshao was the Beiyang Minister. Due to the silting of the Haihe River waterway, he appointed the British consultant Delint, the British and French consuls, the Hai Customs Commissioner, and the President of the Foreign Chamber of Commerce to form an agreement, allocated 100,000 taels as a river management fund, and organized a board of directors to hire Chinese and foreign officials. However, the board of directors did not meet, and all powers were only exercised by Delint and the Customs Commissioner of the Hai Customs. This was the beginning of the bureau being controlled by foreigners. After the Boxer Protocol was established, the bureau's content was reorganized into two departments: one was the board of directors, which was composed of the leading consuls stationed in Tianjin, the Hai Customs Commissioner, the Customs Commissioner, the President of the Foreign Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of shipping companies; the other was the arbitration committee, which was also mostly composed of foreigners. Usually, the bureau's affairs are handled by the secretary-general. The expenses include river works donations and ship donations, which amount to more than one million yuan per year, and are directly allocated by the customs. Over the years, our country's authorities have never intervened. Whether the claim to recover the bureau will succeed this time depends on the joint efforts of officials and the people.

Chairman Kang Jiyao reported the following matters: (1) Representatives of the disaster victims in Shang County reported the disaster situation and requested more relief funds. (2) Representatives of the disaster victims in Weinan County reported that the southeastern area of the county suffered severe hailstorms at 7 pm on the 25th of last month, lasting for two hours. The large ones were like fists, and the small ones were like chicken eggs. The accumulated thickness in the low-lying areas reached two or three feet. The area covered more than ten miles from east to west and more than thirty miles from north to south, totaling one hundred and fifty-six square miles. Wheat seedlings and trees were completely destroyed. In the disaster-stricken villages and forts, the severe ones were more than thirty, and the mild ones were more than ten. Each village lost about a thousand stones of grain, totaling no less than six to seven hundred thousand yuan. The farmers were completely desperate after their hard work throughout the year, resulting in spitting blood and going crazy, and deaths were reported every day. They requested the Relief Association to provide relief quickly and requested the government to exempt them from land tax. (3) The chairman reported important documents and the revenue and expenditure status in May. The matters for discussion were: (1) Urging for relief funds. Resolution: Send another telegram to the President and representatives stationed in Beijing to urge the government to issue funds. (2) Distribution of relief grain. Resolution: Distribute 50 bags of flour to the Buddhist Orphanage, 50 bags to the Literary and Educational Association's disaster-stricken children's home, 50 bags to the Wanji Poor Children's Vocational Training Center, 50 bags to the Cien Nursery, 600 bags to Jingyang, 600 bags to Sanyuan, 50 bags to the Orphanage, 300 bags to Lintong Hebei, 300 bags to Weinan Hebei, 10 bags to the Nursing Home, 30 bags to the Buddhist Studies Institute, 300 bags to the hail-stricken area in Southern Shaanxi, 600 bags to Qianxian, 600 bags to Liquan, 300 bags to Xianyang, 600 bags to Wugong, 300 bags to Xingping, 300 bags to Gaoling, and 300 bags to Fufeng.

Allocate 10 stones of relief grain to more than 350 people living in civilian residences. (3) Discussing future grain management methods. Resolution: Comprehensive consideration should be given to the post-disaster relief of rural areas.</p>
<p>The Provincial Relief Association received a telegram from the Weinan Relief Branch yesterday, saying, "Heaven does not pity the people, and calamitous disasters have befallen them. The seedlings that were about to be harvested have been completely destroyed, which is truly deplorable. On the evening of May 25th, there was thunder and lightning, followed by heavy rain and hailstorms. The hailstones were shaped like walnuts and tung seeds, of various sizes. The area of rainfall and hail was five or six miles wide and more than thirty miles long. The mountainous area along the fourth district of Huaxian suffered the most from the disaster. Among them, Qingning and Guangxiu villages suffered the most. Most of the tobacco seedlings were broken off, and half of the fruits were knocked off. The tobacco seedlings and tender leaves in Jixian, Tai Ning, and Baiquan villages were damaged by hail. The tobacco leaves in Fengyuan, Dongneng, and Taiping villages were yellowed. In short, the tobacco seedlings were not only injured in the disaster-stricken areas, but the wheat seedlings were also flattened, and the beans were dropped. The harvest of all crops was reduced. All residents were crying. The association sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections, and the tragic situation was unbearable. We respectfully request generous relief to alleviate the people's suffering. We cannot express our gratitude enough. Chairman Zhang Jin of the Huaxian Relief Branch and Standing Committee members, etc., all respectfully sign, "(June 5th).</p>
<h3>Red Atmosphere in Huoqiu, Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Red bandits in the border area of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui have been severely suppressed by government troops, but due to the presence of continuous mountains and ridges, which are easy to hide in, they have not been completely eliminated. According to the refugees who escaped from the bandit area in the southern countryside of Huoqiu, the troops suppressing the bandits in western Anhui include the Yue Shengxuan department, the Liang Guanying department, and the Song Shike department, which are cooperating in the suppression. The Red bandits, knowing that the county seat of Luan has heavy troops defending it, dare not invade it, so they have invaded the territory of Huoqiu County and set up a Soviet county government in Wangjia Old Building. They have burned all the houses and fortresses near Shizijia Old Building and Laolongtou. The southern districts of the county, which are traditionally wealthy, have been affected by this Red disaster, and many residents have fled to Zhengyang, Shouxian, and Bengbu. On the 25th of last month, the Red bandits broke through Gaolou Donghewang and abducted more than 300 men and women, including Chuan Boxiu, as hostages. It is rumored that more than 100 people have been killed. The public groups in Huoqiu County, seeing that the banditry is rampant and is about to approach the county seat, have telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang to increase troops to rescue them. They received a reply telegram stating that Liang Guanying's department has been sent to suppress them. Recently, it was reported that the Red bandits suddenly retreated to Zhangtang and Shaoshi Lidian, which are 40 miles away from the city. Song Shike's department then stationed in Yulindian to prevent them. Although the bandits have retreated slightly at this time, the people are still panicked because no large troops have arrived. The Huoqiu Compatriots Association in Bengbu, seeing that the county people are fleeing in droves and the county seat is in imminent danger, telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang to quickly order Liang's department to open Huo Fang and suppress the bandits. Yesterday, it sent a representative, Shi Dechun, from Bengbu to Beijing to report everything in person. More than 300 disaster victims who have fled from the southern countryside of the county to Bengbu are now living in Chuzhou for food. More than 100 people are living in Guan Yu Temple and Zhongxing Street. There are still more than 180 men, women, and children. The Huoqiu Compatriots Association is dividing the relief funds to the district party department, public security bureau, general chamber of commerce, and Red Swastika Society to provide relief.

<h3>Discovery of an Ancient Tomb of the Eastern Han Dynasty in Yutai</h3>
<p>Stone carvings bear the characters of "Yonghe"</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that an ancient tomb was recently discovered in Yutai County. Stone carvings were found inside. Liu Qimin, the director of the county's education bureau, made rubbings of these carvings and sent them to Kong Lingcan, a section chief at the education department. Kong noted that the rubbings contained the characters "Yonghe Second Year," making it impossible to definitively date the tomb to the reign of Emperor Shun of the Eastern Han Dynasty. Instead, it could potentially be from the reign of Emperor Mu of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. He then entrusted the rubbings to Wang Xiantang, the director of the library, for assessment. According to Wang's evaluation, the craftsmanship of the stone carvings is exquisite, leading him to conclude that they are artifacts of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He added that their value is comparable to the renowned Han paintings of Yang Sanlao. (Note: The original stone carvings of Yang Sanlao's Han paintings were acquired by Duanfang during the late Qing Dynasty and sold to Japan for several thousand yuan). Wang intends to request the education department to transport the carvings to Jinan for preservation in the epigraphy conservation center attached to the library (note: a dedicated Han stone conservation center). Liu Qimin has already arrived in Jinan to report this matter. It is also reported that only a portion of the stone carvings has been excavated so far, and Liu's rubbings are from a single stone that contains writing. The characters are as large as the tip of a finger.</p>
<p>According to Liu Qimin's account, during an education bureau directors' conference this spring, Kong Jingan, a section chief at the education department, asked him to look for ancient artifacts. Upon returning to the county, Liu found the stone carvings at the intersection of Yutai and Qufu, about seventy to eighty li away, in a small village within an ancient village area. There is a Fuxi Temple there, and many similar stone carvings can be found in the temple. There are also bridges and ancient tombs near the temple, all containing similar stone carvings, numbering about seventy to eighty pieces. However, there are more drawings than text. The ancient tombs are referred to as the "King's Tombs," rumored to be the tombs of Fuxi, due to their proximity to the Fuxi Temple. These legends are naturally not credible. The rubbings were taken from a stone carving found in the courtyard of a tomb, which is the most clearly visible one. The ancient tombs themselves remain amidst scattered rocks and overgrown weeds and have not yet been excavated, he stated. To note: Yonghe of the Han Dynasty is about two thousand two hundred years away from today. The stone carving in the courtyard is archaic and unique. It is anticipated that more rare and precious objects will be found within the tomb. The rubbing is about three chi (approximately 3 feet) square, surrounded by floral patterns, with cloud-like shapes embedded in the center. Outside, there are groups of birds, two large birds, thirteen small birds. There is a horse on the lower right, with a person standing in front, appearing to be leading the horse. On the left, there are two people each holding a bow, looking up to the sky as if shooting, their expressions remarkably vivid. On the right side of the painting, there are two lines of text, as large as coins, but they are incomplete and cannot be fully deciphered. The text is tentatively transcribed as follows: "In the second year of Yonghe, the year being Mao [missing characters] month, second day, [missing characters] Qingli Village, [missing characters] Kun brothers and sisters, four people, young girl [missing characters] husband, loving mother, father, age [many missing characters below, including the words "money and knife, self-sufficient, thinking of parents and brothers, grief," and "[missing characters] made small courtyard, passed down to grandsons, stonemasons" (the rest is incomplete).</p>

<h3>Shi Shangkuan and Fang Zhi's Defense Against the Supervisory Yuan's Impeachment</h3>
<p>Legislative Yuan member Shi Shangkuan and Central Party Headquarters Editing Department Director Fang Zhi were accused of privately writing to the Anhui Higher Court to solicit intervention in the case of Ye Fen and others. The Supervisory Yuan has brought forward an impeachment case. Recently, Shi and Fang presented a memorial to the National Government and the Supervisory Yuan in response to this, providing explanations and clarifications. The following is the memorial submitted to the Supervisory Yuan (memorial to the National Government omitted): "Evidently, to present the facts of the matter and clarify the truth. Recently, we saw in the newspaper that President Dai has announced that, based on reports from Anhui Tongcheng County citizen representatives Liu Zonghan and Wu Guangzu, Shangkuan and Zhi privately wrote to the Anhui Higher Court to solicit intervention in the case of local ruffians Ye Fen and others, who were accused and sentenced to imprisonment, deeming it a violation of duties and recommending severe punishment to the National Government for strict handling. Upon reading this, we were deeply shocked and horrified. We respectfully present the true facts of the case to your esteemed Yuan. Shangkuan and Zhi are originally from Tongcheng. Several years ago, when troops were passing through, the local gentry, in order to maintain public order, nominated gentry members such as Ye Fen to handle military affairs. Later, Wu Guangzu accused him of unclear accounting of the funds handled, leading to a lawsuit that lasted for years, and he was sentenced to imprisonment by the provincial and local courts. Ye did not accept the verdict and appealed to the Higher Court. The case remained unresolved for a long time. Subsequently, fellow Tongcheng natives from places such as Shanghai, Hankou, and Bengbu sent official letters to the court, requesting a fair trial. At that time, respected elders from Tongcheng, such as Mr. Li Degao and Mr. Fang Shoudun, came to Beijing, representing the impartial gentry of the county, and appealed to fellow Tongcheng natives in Beijing, stating that Ye Fen was burdened due to public service and requesting assistance. Shangkuan and Zhi had studied abroad for many years and were not familiar with local affairs. They had no personal connection to either Ye or Wu. However, the Tongcheng natives in Beijing respected Mr. Li and Mr. Fang for their just words and deeds, and they advocated that there should be a demonstration of support. Therefore, they convened a meeting and decided to send a joint letter in the name of all the Tongcheng natives to Zeng Youhao, the president of the Anhui Higher Court, requesting him to handle the case impartially. At that time, Shangkuan was attending a meeting at the Legislative Yuan and was not present. Later, several fellow Tongcheng natives took the finalized letter to his residence and requested his signature, arguing that it was the will of the public and that it was not appropriate to be alone in dissent. Zhi happened to be in Beijing on official business from Qingdao and was also invited to add his name. This is the truth of the matter. We never expected that your esteemed Yuan would consider this a crime. The accusation that a department director should not privately use letters or telegrams to interfere with court proceedings in lawsuits is made. Shangkuan and Zhi believe that the public letter signed by dozens of Tongcheng natives in Beijing is not a private letter from one or two individuals. The responsibility borne by the group is not the responsibility of one or two individuals. Moreover, the official letter from our group to the president of the Higher Court has been included in the case file, which is sufficient to show that it was not an attempt to influence the court. The original letter, in the capacity of citizens, presented opinions to the court. The court had the power to weigh the final verdict, and it was not an interference with the lawsuit. Although the professions were noted under the names of each person in the original letter, such as university professor and government employee, this was merely to indicate that they were not unemployed individuals, to show credibility, and had nothing to do with the titles of member or director themselves. Shangkuan and Zhi cannot, by virtue of being members or directors, deprive themselves of the right as citizens to advocate for justice. As for the allegation by your esteemed Yuan that we violated Article 142 of the Criminal Law on obstructing official duties, the crime of obstructing official duties requires violent or coercive behavior. We believe that a single public letter does not constitute violence. Requesting impartial handling, what coercion is there? All the citations can be easily proven from the original letter. As for the statement that Shangkuan also sent private telegrams, this does not conform to the facts. Recently, people's hearts are treacherous, and cases of fraudulent letters and telegrams often occur. The seal is the only thing that can be trusted. Shangkuan, besides merely listing his name on the public letter, sent no such telegrams. We wonder if the investigating committee designated by your esteemed Yuan has ever gone to the telegraph bureau to check if there is a telegram draft with Shangkuan's signature and seal. Moreover, the impeachment of Shangkuan and Zhi by your esteemed Yuan is solely based on the accusations of Wu Guangzu and others, and Wu is the original accuser of Ye Fen and is known for his litigious nature. He is naturally dissatisfied with the advocacy for justice by the Tongcheng natives in Beijing and, therefore, groundlessly directs his arrows at Shangkuan and Zhi, choosing whom to accuse. We do not know what his intentions are. But your esteemed Yuan cannot but conduct a thorough investigation and fair judgment. Since this case occurred, it has been several months. Shangkuan and Zhi serve in the capital, close at hand. We have not received any summons from your esteemed Yuan, nor have we heard of any direct investigation of Shangkuan and Zhi. Relying solely on one-sided claims and hastily condemning people, without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves, and then submitting the impeachment case to the National Government and announcing it in the newspapers, how can it be considered fair in terms of reason and sentiment? The impact on the personal reputation of Shangkuan and Zhi is small, but the impact on the dignity of your esteemed Yuan is great. Now that the impeachment case has been established, the laws of the state are in place. Shangkuan and Zhi can only await punishment in Beijing and respectfully await disposition. We respectfully present the truth and pray for your kind consideration."</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Defense of the Fujian Border</h3>
<p>Progress in the Upper Reaches' Suppression of Bandits</p>
<p>Establishment of a Military Supplies Design Committee</p>
<p>Fang and Zheng to Beijing to Discuss Changes to the Measures</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou reports that after the Communist bandits of the Fujian-Jiangxi region infiltrated Taijian, there were many rumors here. However, according to today's news, General Liu's troops and other units have made gradual progress. The provincial government issued a proclamation on the 10th, stating: "Proclamation regarding the matter of the bandit Zhu Mao, who has infiltrated the Fujian border from Jiangxi. After our 56th Division and other units have been deployed in layers of defense, the main force of the bandits has retreated to the Jiangxi border and is no longer a cause for concern. At present, the defense of the upper reaches is becoming more secure, and the security of the provincial capital has also been strengthened by the military and police agencies, which have been instructed to maintain order with care. It is hereby proclaimed to all merchants and residents to live and work in peace and not to lightly listen to rumors and cause disturbances. Those who fabricate rumors and create trouble will be severely arrested and punished. This proclamation is hereby issued."</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. on the 10th, the newly organized Military Supplies Committee held a meeting in the provincial government conference room. Chen Lianfen, Zheng Baojing, He Gonggan, and many others attended. It was resolved that the committee be renamed the Provisional Military Supplies Design Committee, responsible to the provincial government for raising funds and supervising their use, but with no external relations. When the bandit suppression is completed, the committee will be dissolved. Zheng Baojing was publicly elected as the chairman. Plans for raising funds have also been formulated, roughly following the resolution of the Party-Government Joint Conference to issue a second batch of treasury bonds worth 500,000 yuan, backed by collateral, and to solicit subscriptions from areas outside the provincial capital, such as Xiamen. The original proposal to borrow 250,000 yuan from the Minjiang River Bureau's dredging funds was changed because the bureau's holdings of U.S. dollar bonds at the Bank of China were already earmarked for other purposes. As for the salary reduction of Party organs, it will be implemented when necessary. After Xu Xianshi returned to the province from Yanping to report, the provincial government convened a temporary discussion meeting and appointed Fang Shengtao and Zheng Baojing to go to Shanghai to report the situation of bandit suppression in northern Fujian to Chairman Yang and to request assistance from the central government. Fang and Zheng originally planned to depart on the 10th. However, this morning, Zheng said that the planning of military supplies in the rear required him to stay in the province to preside over the matter. If both the Acting Chairman and the Director of Civil Affairs traveled together, those who did not understand the true situation might become alarmed and start rumors. Therefore, it has now been decided that the two will not travel together, with one going to Beijing and the other staying in the province to maintain order. (June 11th)</p>
<h3>Investigation Notes on the Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei (Part 3)</h3>
<p>Overview of Coke Production Coke is the primary fuel for iron and steel smelting. In the ninth century, the coke industry gradually developed in Europe and the United States due to the needs of steel factories. Our country lacks large-scale steel factories (the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works was once grand in scale and built a coke plant in Huangshigang in 1919, but it failed to start operations due to the situation at the time, and the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works also went bankrupt due to various reasons). Therefore, the coke industry has not been able to develop to this day. However, even though gas works were popular overseas a hundred years ago, the byproduct coal tar (also known as "stinky oil," "tar," or "coal ointment") was regarded as waste and simply thrown into the furnace and burned to ashes. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that people began to use it to manufacture oil paint to replace lime for coating various buildings to prevent corrosion. Furthermore, it was also used to manufacture ink, shoe polish, charcoal pencils, etc., using scientific methods. However, these were only the direct uses of coal tar. In the last thirty years, the coal tar distillation industry has gradually developed, and it has been discovered that this seemingly foul-smelling coal tar contains a myriad of possibilities. Substances such as carbolic acid, ammonia, naphthalene (synthetic camphor), and gasoline have been successively produced with increasingly refined methods, leading to the manufacturing of powerful explosives, miraculous medicines, beautiful pigments, fragrant spices, yield-enhancing fertilizers, extremely sweet saccharin, and light-sensitive photographic products. In recent years, European and American coke plants have produced up to two hundred and several dozens of byproducts from coal tar distillation. They continue to research tirelessly, hoping to discover new products. Therefore, what was once regarded as waste has now become a treasure. Although China has had a history of using machinery for coal mining for fifty or sixty years, it still uses traditional methods for coking to supply fuel for residential use, causing various valuable byproducts to be completely wasted. As a result, Europe and the United States transport their machine-processed products to China. The loss due to this has been countless billions in the last two to thirty years. The Jingxing Mining Bureau was aware of this and hired the German chemist Mr. Hochdorn in 1912 to conduct chemical analyses. The analyses proved that Jingxing coal can produce at least twenty to thirty kinds of byproducts when coked. The bureau immediately designated Shijiazhuang, which had convenient transportation, to build a coke plant. However, before the furnace foundation and factory building were completed, the European War broke out, and the German technicians returned home, halting the construction. In 1923, the unfinished work was resumed. In October 1925, ten Otto waste-heat small furnaces were completed, and the machinery for manufacturing byproducts was also installed. Production began immediately. While selling the products, the bureau also built ten Holbolmen regenerative large furnaces. Later, due to repeated wars in the country, transportation was cut off, and the supply of materials was interrupted. Work was halted again in November 1927. It was not until September 1928, when the north and south were unified, that workers were gathered to light the furnaces and begin production. The regenerative large furnaces were completed in 1930. After Gao Bianying took office as the bureau director, he went to Shijiazhuang to inspect and immediately ordered the recruitment of workers to light the furnaces and begin production. Among the state-owned or private coal mines in China that have coke plants, Jingxing should be considered the first.</p>
<p>Coke Equipment Coke is made from semi-bituminous coal. The mixed coal from various layers produced by the Jingxing Mine is first selected and washed at the mine's coal washing plant. Then, it is transported to Shijiazhuang daily via the Zhengtai Railway for use. When the coal mine transports the washed coal, it also includes a very fine coal dust, which is the residue from the clarification of the coal washing wastewater, locally known as "yanzi" (smoke residue). Before loading the furnace, the washed coal must be mixed with an appropriate amount of water and then mixed with 20% of "yanzi". After loading into the coke oven, a chemical reaction will occur, decomposing it into two substances: volatile matter, which is the gas that evaporates from the furnace, and carbon residue, which is the solid matter that precipitates in the furnace. The plant's ten large furnaces produce eight furnaces of coke per day. Within 24 hours, a total of 88 tons of washed coal are required, yielding a total of 68 tons of coke. The twenty small furnaces produce sixteen furnaces of coke per day, requiring a total of 56.64 tons of washed coal and yielding a total of 43.84 tons of coke. Together, the large and small furnaces produce over 110 tons of coke per day. However, during the cold winter months, the air required by the small furnaces cannot be preheated, resulting in a recurring lack of coal gas supply. Even when the coking time is extended to 48 hours, it is still difficult to obtain good coke. At the same time, the coke production is also reduced. This year, the large furnaces have started operation, and the surplus gas can be used to regulate the needs of the small furnaces, so this problem may be avoided in the future.</p>
<p>Byproducts When coking bituminous coal, its volatile matter contains many raw materials for chemical products. Both the large and small coke ovens mentioned above have devices for collecting byproducts (i.e., collecting volatile matter): 1. Coal tar, 2. Ammonia, 3. Benzol oil. The amount of byproduct raw materials collected per ton of coal is as follows: coal tar 77.0 lbs, ammonia 4.5 lbs, benzol oil 20.0 lbs. The products made from coal tar are as follows: light oil, medium oil, heavy oil, red oil, asphalt oil, carbolic acid, synthetic camphor, diesel oil, axle oil, dehydrated creosote oil, black paint, used as coatings, pigments, explosives, medicines, etc. The products made from ammonia are: ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium carbonate, pure ammonia solution, used to manufacture agricultural fertilizers. The products made from benzol oil are: gasoline, benzoic oil, 90% benzol oil, fore-runnings oil, camphor solvent, etc., used to manufacture various explosives and chemical raw materials. The quality of various byproducts produced by the coke plant each year is excellent. However, the gasoline is slightly inferior. It has a slight smoky smell when burned and can only be used for long-distance cars. This is due to the limited filtering capacity of the machinery, which prevents it from being completely purified. According to Bureau Director Dang Shuangying, a new type of machinery has been purchased from a German company and is currently being installed. It is expected to be completed in about a month. In the future, we can confidently compete with imported products by producing pure gasoline.</p>
<p>Labor Conditions The entire mine currently has over 2,000 workers. The work system is divided into day labor, contract labor, monthly labor, and temporary contract labor. The daily work hours are eight hours for heavy work and nine hours for light work. The daily wage ranges from a maximum of more than one yuan and three jiao to a minimum of three jiao and five fen. Apprentices earn two jiao and five fen. Some are paid daily, some are paid every ten days, and some are paid monthly. When paying wages last month, the bureau director, in order to eliminate malpractices and demonstrate fairness, planned to imitate the military's method of roll call when issuing pay. The chief auditor Yan Tiesheng was sent to supervise the payment. However, due to various practical difficulties, it could not be implemented and the old method of payment was retained. Short-term workers account for two-thirds of the total workforce, while long-term workers account for only one-third. These short-term workers are mostly local farmers or farmers from nearby counties. They come to work after the spring and autumn farming is completed and return to cultivate the land during the busy farming season. Now that it is the wheat harvest season, most of the workers have gone home, and coal production will have to be reduced this month. This is a unique situation for the Jingxing Mine. According to Mr. Dang, to remedy this, it is necessary to temporarily hire workers from other regions. However, workers from other regions have higher wages, and it is necessary to pay for their travel expenses twice, which is not cost-effective. If all workers are converted to long-term workers, given that the political situation is not yet stable, once transportation is cut off and coal is piled up and cannot be transported, it would also be a cause for concern. However, the contract labor system is based on the principle of not exploiting the interests of the workers and will be gradually improved. As for the treatment of workers, the general situation is as follows: (A) There is a hospital with over thirty sickrooms equipped with complete internal and surgical equipment. The hired internal and surgical doctors are responsible for treating and examining diets and all hygiene matters for the workers' residences. All employees of this mine who are hospitalized are free of charge. (B) There is a school for employees' children, divided into primary and secondary levels, with a total of over 130 male and female students. All children of employees are admitted free of charge. This year, more than a dozen students in the senior class have graduated and requested the bureau director to help them continue their education. Permission has been granted to find suitable schools in the Tianjin-Beijing area to help them continue their education. In addition, there is a weekly tutorial school where workers with better education who wish to pursue further studies can enroll. Teachers are employed by the mine's staff and teach common knowledge and technical principles. There is also a night school where all workers who work daily can enroll. Classes are held every night from 8 pm to 10 pm, teaching simple literacy, arithmetic, Party principles, and common sense. (C) All national holidays stipulated by the National Government are observed, and wages are not deducted. Ordinary Sundays are given off every two weeks. Those who cannot rest and continue to work are paid double. Holidays are granted at the discretion of the worker for marriages, funerals, and illnesses, and wages are not deducted. (D) Workers injured on the job are given holidays and are allowed to enter the hospital for free treatment. Those who die due to work-related injuries are given a consolation payment of 100 yuan each. (E) At the end of the year, coal gangue is given as a bonus according to the amount of work, with each person receiving four trucks for heavy work and two trucks for light work each year. Each truck of gangue weighs about three tons, and no fees are charged. (F) Regarding entertainment, there is an employee club with rudimentary facilities. However, it is still too small and will be gradually expanded in accordance with the national plan. (G) In previous years, workers had no organization. Since November 1928, under the guidance of the Jingxing County Party Department, the Hebei Jingxing County Coal Mine Iron Workers' Union was established. The mine provides 400 yuan per month for expenses and allocates over twenty rooms in the southeast corner of the mine as the union's office. In addition to the office, there are also lecture, library, and reading rooms. The library has purchased over a hundred kinds of books, magazines, and Party-related books and newspapers related to the mining industry, which workers can read at will in their spare time to increase their knowledge. Outside the union hall, there are various ball game sports grounds. After work each day or on weekly rest days, the sports team will summon workers to form groups to exercise in order to train the body, connect feelings, and cultivate the spirit of mutual assistance in the group. The union has purchased entertainment items such as a phonograph, a movie projector, and traditional Chinese musical instruments. Except for movies, which must be shown every two weeks, all other items can be used for practice at will after work to rest the mind and invigorate the spirit. (June 6th)</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>County Gentry Telegraph to Retain County Magistrate: News of Songjiang County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang being transferred to a provincial post has been received and acknowledged by the Civil Affairs Department's directive. It is now known that local elders, including Geng Daochong, Cai Guangyao, Lu Longxiang, Zhang Kaiqi, and Zhang Fusun, have jointly telegraphed the Nanjing Ministry of Interior, the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, and the Civil Affairs Department, requesting his retention. The message states, "County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang has served in Songjiang for three years, fostering harmonious governance and achieving remarkable results. In particular, his suppression of bandits has been lauded by the people. Now that major bandits like Taibao A Shu, Zhu Ze, and A Mei have been captured and executed, the locality is gradually recovering. We rely on a capable magistrate to remain in his post for a long time to achieve great governance. The sudden news of his transfer to the province has caused widespread panic. We, Daochong and others, are affiliated with Songjiang. How can we remain silent when our capable magistrate is taken away? We are sending this special telegram to earnestly request Your Excellency (to forward to the Provincial Government) to withdraw this order and appease the public's hopes. We await instructions with utmost urgency." This is also the expected behavior of local gentry.</p>

<p>Robbers Murder Homeowner During Robbery: At one o'clock last night, the home of Chen Guihe, a farmer in the Fifth Tu of Nanqiao Nanshou in the First District, was suddenly attacked by more than twenty robbers who broke down the door to rob. Chen's granddaughter-in-law, Zhang, heard the noise and fled outside. Recognizing the robbers, she shouted for help, resulting in her being shot dead. The county government dispatched Xu Cheng to investigate this morning (the 13th). The deceased was found to have sustained three gunshot wounds, with bullets piercing her chest and abdomen. In addition to ordering the homeowner to immediately arrange for the burial, the police have been dispatched to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Goldsmiths and Silversmiths Request Reduction in Business Tax: For the business tax issue, the Jiangsu Province goldsmiths and silversmiths industry held a representative conference in Suzhou on the 14th. More than thirty representatives from various counties attended and immediately resolved to submit a request to the province for a reduction in tax rates. The original request states, "We merchants previously submitted requests for tax reduction or exemption due to the excessive tax rates, which we could not afford. We also elected representatives to make appeals. It has been noted that our industry faces difficulties, as stated in our previous submissions. All kinds of jewelry and utensils, regardless of size, are engraved with trademarks and markings, and are purely manufactured by hand, with absolutely no element of trading. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance's Directive No. 977 stipulates that the gold and silver manufacturing industry shall be taxed based on the amount of capital. Furthermore, the newly established tax rates in Shanghai also require gold and silver businesses to pay taxes based on capital. We believe that Jiangsu and Zhejiang are geographically adjacent, and the business conditions are similar. It is inappropriate to be treated differently. Moreover, Shanghai's commerce is the most prosperous in the province, yet the tax rates are the lowest. Why should Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, whose trade is far inferior, bear particularly heavy burdens? As for Jiangbei, where the land is poor and the people are impoverished, there is even less ability to bear heavy taxes. As a last resort, we submit this request to Your Excellency, seeking approval to follow the precedents of Zhejiang and Shanghai, and tax based on the amount of capital at the lowest rate for manual manufacturing. We also request that all county business tax collection bureaus be instructed to comply."</p>

<p>Huai Shang Again Reports Robbery and Assault: Fang Sunchun, a resident of Jintoushang near Fangcun Bridge in the 464th Tu of the Seventh District (Huai Shang), who makes a living by farming, had some savings. At midnight the day before yesterday, more than ten robbers wearing short clothes, wielding weapons, suddenly came to Fang's house. Two robbers guarded the door, and three robbers climbed over the wall and entered the house, opened the gate, and let the remaining robbers in. They went straight into the room, dragged Fang Sunchun and his wife out of bed, tied them up with ropes, and beat them with wooden sticks, forcing them to reveal the location of their hidden silver. Unable to bear the pain, Fang and his wife had no choice but to tell them the location of the hidden silver. The robbers then searched the address and robbed them for about two hours before escaping with their loot. In this incident, they were robbed of more than seventy yuan in cash, as well as clothing and other items, worth about two hundred yuan. When the robbers left, they stabbed Fang and his wife with sharp knives. Fortunately, the injuries were minor, with no threat to life.</p>

Afterwards, Rumei checked the losses and found that gold and silver jewelry and cash totaling more than one thousand yuan had been robbed. He has now reported the case to the police and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The Shooting at Sanguantang: Jiang Buzhou, who runs a small restaurant at Baota Road, is fifty years old and from Haizhou. His wife died early. In 1921, he became acquainted with Ms. Chen, and it has been ten years since. Ms. Chen is only thirty years old and has long been tired of Jiang but dares not openly disobey because she fears his strength. One of Jiang's students, Zhang Ziyu, is young and strong, and Ms. Chen had an affair with him. Jiang, although he heard about it, did not want to publicize the family scandal. On the 10th of the lunar calendar, Jiang went to Shanghai on business. On the 11th, he returned to Zhenjiang but could not find Ms. Chen. He asked Li's daughter-in-law, who said that she had run away the day before. Jiang was at a loss and judged that Chen's departure was undoubtedly with Zhang Yuyu. So on the morning of the 16th, he went to Shanghai with another student, Li Shifang, to look for him because Zhang often went to Shanghai. He did not find them. Li Shifang returned to Zhenjiang on the 18th. Jiang was alone in Shanghai, inquiring everywhere. He met Zhang Ziyu's elder brother and ordered him to hand over his younger brother. After Li Shifang returned to Zhenjiang, he went to Jiang's store to listen for news, asking if Jiang had returned to Zhenjiang. Jiang's daughter-in-law replied that he had not returned. Li said to Li, "When your father-in-law returns to Zhenjiang, tell him to go to the Cai family in Sanguantang. We have something to discuss." Li did not know that there was another purpose. Until 5 pm the day before yesterday, Li Shifang came to Jiang's store to ask again. Li's daughter-in-law replied that he had not returned. Li Shifang went to the Runyuan Bathhouse across the street to get a haircut. Not long after, Jiang Buzhou returned to Zhenjiang from Shanghai. At that time, another student, Zhang Fengqi, came to the barbershop and whispered in Li Shifang's ear. Li ran across the railway before finishing his haircut. Jiang Buzhou thought that since Li was looking for him, why did he leave without saying goodbye? So he followed to ask the reason. At that time, Zhang Fengqi and his nephew Xiao Erzi also followed. When they arrived at the Cai family, Li Shifang and others entertained the teacher with wine and food. At that time, those present, in addition to Li Shifang and Zhang Fengqi, included Zhou Xueren and others, all of whom were Jiang's disciples. Xiao Erzi returned before reaching the Cai family. Jiang saw that the situation was not right. At about 8 pm, he bid farewell and went home. After leaving the door, he was shot. The Public Security Sixth Sub-Bureau heard gunshots and, in addition to telegraphing Director Chen to order the team to prepare, sent police officers to investigate. They found Jiang's body in Dongyue Temple. Wang Yubei, the head of the sub-bureau, asked Director Chen to send a team to assist in the apprehension of the murderer. They arrested Li Shifang, Zhou Xueren, and eight others and brought them to the Public Security Bureau this morning for interrogation. After the body was inspected by the court, it was buried by his family in a coffin. The deceased only had a young nephew, a daughter-in-law, and three granddaughters, with no one else, which is quite pitiful.</p>

Chief Prosecutor Zhu stated that the reasons for Ni's arrest and how so many people were shot and injured were not yet clear. He sent a letter to the county government requesting a response. At 2 pm, the county police team sent eleven injured police officers, including Xu Zhankui, to the court for examination. It was found that they all had minor injuries from wooden objects and were ordered to return for treatment.</p>
<p>Military Commander Chen Explains the Nature of the Wounded Soldiers' Factory: The Eleventh Division of the Army has changed the poor people's factory into a wounded soldiers' factory, which has been approved by the General Headquarters. Chen Cheng, the Eighteenth Army Commander, telegraphed various groups from Fuzhou, Jiangxi, stating, "Our Eleventh Division is preparing to establish a wounded soldiers' vocational training factory in Tong for the purpose of providing post-war care for wounded soldiers who have suffered hard battles over the years. The General Commander has approved it. Unexpectedly, one or two people in the local area who are ignorant of the matter coveted the site of the wounded soldiers' vocational training factory and made all kinds of dangerous remarks to scare people, hoping to force the wounded soldiers to leave Tong in order to fulfill their selfish ambitions under the guise of public interest. This kind of rogue behavior is deeply regrettable. Our revolutionary officers and soldiers have fought hard, resulting in broken legs and arms, and are isolated and helpless. The establishment of this vocational training institute is only to enable the wounded soldiers to have the minimum means of survival and reduce the source of social unrest. How can those with a little conscience bear to sit idly by and ignore the suffering of these officers and soldiers with torn skin and broken bones? At the beginning of the political tutelage, if we do not seek a way out for the revolutionary wounded soldiers who sacrificed and were injured, but want to sit back and enjoy the benefits of the revolution, it is not only contrary to reason and emotion, but also afraid that those who are wronged will be forced too much and affect social tranquility. The harm is even greater."</p>
<p>Pacification Army Organizes Law Enforcement Team: The 280th Regiment of the Pacification Army stationed in Tong organized a law enforcement team on the 13th to patrol the streets every day. If any officers or soldiers are found to be improperly dressed, without symbols, or riding freely in cars, rushing and injuring pedestrians, regardless of the reason, forcibly buying and selling, beating and scolding merchants, rickshaw pullers, etc., or engaging in undisciplined, reckless, and provocative behavior, regardless of which unit of the military or police, they will all be arrested.</p>

<p>Tianyuan Silk Shop Burned Down Twice: The Tianyuan Silk Shop, opened by Jin Lao Chong and others from Changyi, located at Niushetou outside the North Gate of this city, was burned down on the morning of the 30th of last month, destroying two floors and injuring three partners. Afterwards, as the shop was in the peak season for new silk, it requested the landlord to immediately renovate the burned houses and temporarily operate in No. 24 Mihang Street. Only ten days have passed, but at around 10 am the day before yesterday (the 13th), a fire broke out again on the upper floor of the shop, instantly breaking through the roof. The fire was extinguished by the city's fire brigades after half an hour. Fortunately, it was during the day, and the silk that had been brought in was moved out by neighbors and partners, avoiding damage. However, four houses in the front and back were reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Occurs at Bailing Temple: Wang Jinli, a resident of Bailing Temple Village in Zhenhai, is a merchant in Shanghai and his family is well-off.

<p>Soldiers from the Customs Suppression Team Cause Trouble in Cao'e: A few days ago, Deputy Officer Li of the Sixth Detachment of the Customs Suppression Team in Yuyao and soldiers He Bingyuan, Xue Min, and others were ordered to go to Hangzhou to collect guns and ammunition. When they arrived at the Cao'e Shaocao Sheng Bus Company to buy tickets, they insisted on leaving early because they could not wait, causing a conflict. They vented their anger on the policeman Hong Sanyuan. After returning to Cao'e, the soldiers went directly into the kitchen of the bus station and dragged Hong Sanyuan out, beating him violently. Later, Hong escaped to the roof to hide and avoid further humiliation. The soldiers destroyed the glass of the bus station door and left angrily. After the incident, all the station workers mobilized and reported to the Baiguan Security Team and the Shaoxing Wuyun Station's transportation department, demanding protection and negotiating with the Customs Suppression Team to punish the perpetrators and compensate for the losses.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the First Regiment Headquarters of the Military Police</h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, Regarding the incident on the night of June 1st, when the military police patrolling near Zhengyi were wounded by bandits, it has been investigated that the night was foggy, and visibility was low. It has been heard that when our patrolling military police were three miles west of Zhengyi Railway Station, bandits suddenly opened fire on us, wounding two military police. The remaining soldiers were in pursuit of the bandits, when a fast train passed through the area, separating the bandits and us. The bandits took the opportunity to escape. After searching for a long time, we were unable to find anything, and no foreign bandits were captured. This is the truth. However, the news reported in various newspapers is mostly not true. In particular, the statement that "one foreign bandit was captured" is completely unfounded. This may easily cause foreigners to suspect. We are sincerely afraid that the true facts will not be known to all parties. Therefore, we make this solemn statement, hoping that it will be published. First Regiment Headquarters of the Military Police, June 10th.</p>

<h3>Military Training Temporarily Exempted for All Schools During This Year's Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved the consultation from the Directorate General of Military Training, stating that military training will be temporarily exempted during this year's summer vacation. Special notice is hereby given to all public and private universities, independent colleges, vocational schools, and the education departments in various provinces and cities: "It is noted that Article 5, Section 2 of the revised military education plan for high schools and above stipulates that three consecutive weeks of extremely rigorous military training should be implemented during each annual summer vacation. Last year, due to practical difficulties, a consultation was already made to instruct all schools to suspend implementation. Recently, military instructors from various schools have reported that the implementation of this academic year's summer training is still economically burdensome and faces many obstacles, requesting a temporary postponement of implementation, etc. After careful consideration by the headquarters, it is indeed the case. The three consecutive weeks of military training during this academic year's summer vacation should be approved for temporary exemption to avoid difficulties. In addition to ordering all military instructors to comply, a corresponding consultation will be made for review and it is hoped that all schools under your jurisdiction will be instructed to be aware of this."</p>
<h3>Soochow University Holds Memorial Service for Shen Huiyuan</h3>
<p>Shen Huiyuan, a Master of Science in Chemistry and Head of the Chemistry Department at Soochow University in Suzhou, was deeply accomplished in chemical research. He taught at Soochow for many years. On May 29th, he led all the students of the Chemistry Department to Shanghai to visit various factories. Unexpectedly, he fell ill on the way and suffered unstoppable bleeding. He passed away on the 30th at Tongren Hospital at the age of thirty-three. Yesterday, the entire faculty and students of Soochow held a memorial service in the auditorium. Because President Yang Yongqing was in Shanghai, Vice President Pan Shenming presided over the service. Many faculty, staff, and students of all grades presented elegiac couplets and gave speeches. Vice President Pan pointed out two things, saying that although Mr. Shen was physically weak, he was not afraid of difficulties and his spirit of responsibility was a model for us. However, it is a loss to Soochow that an intelligent person with great potential died young. Shen's father, Mr. Shutben, gave a thank-you speech, which was very much in line with the spirit of religion, as Mr. Shutben is indeed a zealous religious teacher. On the same day, the coffin was moved to Anle Garden outside Fengmen for burial.</p>

<h3>Remarkable New Short-Distance Records Set at the Japanese Intercollegiate Athletic Meet</h3>
<p>100 Meters | 10.5 Seconds</p>
<p>200 Meters | 21.2 Seconds</p>
<p>| Both Achieved by Mr. Yoshioka of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, University of Literature |</p>
<p>(Osaka Dispatch) As the World Games draw near, Japan is intensifying its preparations for track and field. On May 30th and 31st, the Japanese National Intercollegiate Athletic Meet was held at Koshien South in Osaka. Thirty-nine universities participated, with Prince Chichibu, the Emperor's brother, awarding cups to encourage them. Among them, Waseda, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature, and Keio were the strongest. Waseda had maintained its championship for the past seven years, boasting world-class athletes such as Oda, Nishida, Sumiyoshi, and Kimura. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature, however, was a rising star, with promising new talents like Yoshioka and Fujita. After Waseda's captain, Oda, graduated this spring, their strength was significantly reduced. Oda consistently secured first place in the long jump and triple jump, and third place in the pole vault and high jump, while also qualifying for the 100-meter hurdles. He consistently earned the highest individual score. Therefore, after Oda's departure, Waseda's golden era also came to an end. At this year's meet, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature won the national championship with 120 and a half points. Waseda came in second, and Keio was third. Looking at the results of the two days, all records were astonishing. Five meet records were broken, and two Japanese national records were broken. Yoshioka's performances in the 100-meter and 200-meter races were particularly outstanding, approaching world records. There is no doubt that Japan will be a strong competitor to the United States and Germany at next year's World Games, and may even hold the third position in world track and field.</p>
<p>Results of Various Events:</p>
<p>100 Meters First: Yoshioka (Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature) 10.5 seconds</p>
<p>New Japanese Record</p>
<p>Second: Sasaki (Same) 10.8 seconds</p>
<p>Six athletes competed in the final. Yoshioka took the lead after 30 meters, leading by one meter. After 50 meters, he was as swift as the wind, and the others were indistinguishable in the joyful crowd. The remaining five athletes were lined up in a row. By the time they reached the finish line, all five athletes had a time of 10.8 seconds, finishing simultaneously, with only Sasaki slightly ahead by a chest.</p>
<p>200 Meters First: Yoshioka (Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature) 21.2 seconds</p>
<p>New Japanese Record</p>
<p>400 Meters First: Nakajima (Waseda) 49.6 seconds</p>
<p>800 Meters First: Fujieda (Kansai University) 1 minute 59.2 seconds</p>
<p>1500 Meters First: Hosaka (Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature) 4 minutes 15.4 seconds</p>
<p>This event had the worst result in the meet. Keio University's Kitamoto, who had a personal best of 4 minutes and 8 seconds, unfortunately withdrew after running 1000 meters, resulting in no good record being produced in the 1500-meter race.</p>
<p>10,000 Meters First: Kitamoto (Keio) 33 minutes 20 seconds</p>
<p>New Meet Record</p>
<p>After failing in the 1500-meter race, Kitamoto worked hard in the 10,000-meter race and was able to break the meet record, proving that those who fail can still succeed.</p>
<p>High Hurdles First: Fujita (Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature) 15.3 seconds</p>
<p>New Meet Record</p>
<p>Middle Hurdles First: Yoshihara (Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature) 57.8 seconds</p>
<p>400-Meter Relay First: Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Literature Team 43 seconds</p>
<p>1600-Meter Relay First: Same 3 minutes 27.8 seconds</p>
<p>New Meet Record</p>
<p>Shot Put First: Saito (Keio) 13.31 meters</p>
<p>New Meet Record</p>
<p>Second: Aono (Waseda) 12.67 meters</p>

<h3>Amateur Basketball Championship Decided</h3>
<p>Shang Group | Love Team</p>
<p>Wu Group | Allied Nations Team</p>
<p>Jing Group | Three Tripods</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the closing day of the Amateur Basketball Competition held at the City First Public Sports Field. Eight games were played in the morning and afternoon. In addition to the 神 (God) Group championship already won by the Bomb Team, the championships for the Shang 武 (Martial) and Wu groups were also decided. The Jing group had three teams with equal scores and required a knockout rematch. The scores are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Group Team (Win/Loss) Score</p>
<p>(Shang) Also Win News 50 vs 21</p>
<p>(Shang) Love Win Fitness 33 vs 12</p>
<p>(Wu) Alas Win Pu River Pu River Forfeit</p>
<p>(Wu) Allied Nations Win Postal 14 vs 12</p>
<p>(Shang) Love Win News News Forfeit</p>
<p>(Jing) South Star vs Social Light 37 vs 33</p>
<p>(Jing) Black Star Win Music Star 36 vs 17</p>
<p>Love Team Claims Victory in Shang Group Love and Fitness are the two iron armies of the Shang group. Since the round-robin, neither had suffered a setback. When they met, experts knew that there would be a fierce battle. However, in the first half, both sides soared and leapt, maintaining a standoff. In the second half, the Love team attacked from both sides, passing and blocking, with shots like a continuous stream of pearls, while Fitness ran out of ideas and was at a loss, losing their territory. The Love team then won the Shang group championship with a score of 33 to 12.</p>
<p>Allied Nations Shows Strength in Wu Group The battle between Allied Nations and Postal was extremely intense, as it was a matter of life and death. However, due to strict supervision, both sides progressed slowly, sweating profusely. In the first half, they only managed a score of 4 to 6, with Postal winning by a narrow margin. In the second half, both sides continued to defend firmly. As time was running out, a guard on the Allied Nations team suddenly broke through and scored two consecutive goals, taking the lead. The score became 10 to 6, with the total score being 14 to 12. Postal lost its prestigious position by a margin of two points. A pity.</p>
<p>Three Tripods in Jing Group In the Jing group round-robin, Social Light was victorious in every match. South Star and Black Star both suffered one defeat. Yesterday's match between South Star and Social Light would have allowed Social Light to secure the championship. However, the situation changed unpredictably. After a hard-fought battle, Social Light was defeated by South Star with a score of 33 to 37. In the first half, Social Light players competed for personal glory and failed to cooperate, resulting in a large defeat of 11 to 22 against South Star. In the second half, although they corrected their mistakes and tried to recover, the difference was too large to overcome, with a score of 22 to 15. In total, the difference was only four points. As a result, South Star, Social Light, and Black Star all had one loss, forming a three-way tie. The order of the knockout tournament to determine the champion is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Preliminary Black Star vs South Star 5:50 PM on the 17th</p>
<p>(2) Preliminary The winner of the preliminary match vs Social Light 5:50 PM on the 19th</p>
<h3>Youth Association Student Swimming Classes Open</h3>
<p>In recent years, various sports in Shanghai have flourished and become increasingly popular. However, swimming is still as rare as morning stars. The Chinese Youth Association is concerned about this and has initiated student swimming activities to promote the sport and encourage more young people to take up swimming and practice. As a result, the number of talents will increase, and progress will gradually be made. It is reported that 120 to 130 students from various schools are participating, divided into six groups. Classes will begin today (the 15th) for practical training. The Association's Sports Department has recently compiled drafts of swimming guidelines and elementary teaching materials for distribution to each group for reference.</p>

<h3>Ji Tong Explains the Purpose of Adding a Senior High Normal School Department to the Patriotic Girls' School</h3>
<p>The Patriotic Girls' School has decided to add a Senior High Normal School Department starting from the second semester of the 20th academic year. Someone asked us about the purpose of opening this department. Here is a summary of our answers:</p>
<p>(1) Why are you opening a Senior High Normal School Department?</p>
<p>Except for the Physical Education Department, which is a vocational department, the Senior High School only has Literature and General Departments. The Literature Department trains individuals with literary skills or prepares them for entering university literature departments. The General Department prepares students for entering university. There are very few vocational subjects in the curriculum. We want to promote vocational education for girls, so we decided to open a Senior High Normal School Department. Furthermore, we know that there are too few employment opportunities for girls, and society does not pay much attention to girls' occupations. The relatively most suitable occupation for girls is serving in the education sector. They have gentle personalities and sincere attitudes to love and educate children. Their understanding of children and children's problems is much more intimate. Therefore, our school does not run business or engineering departments and has decided to add a Senior High Normal School Department.</p>
<p>(2) What kind of female teachers do you want to cultivate?</p>
<p>Our overall educational goal is to "cultivate female mentors who sincerely educate children and enthusiastically serve society." The necessary conditions for such mentors are: (1) a healthy body, (2) a scientific mind, (3) a creative spirit, (4) a gentle character, and (5) artistic interests. We believe that female teachers who meet these conditions can nurture good children and contribute to society.</p>
<p>(3) How are you different from other normal schools?</p>
<p>We believe that life is education, so the whole of life is the whole educational process. Students seek knowledge in whatever environment they are in, and they learn whatever they need to do. Frankly speaking, we treat books as tools and change lecturing into guidance. Therefore, a student goes to another school to receive education, but comes to our school to live life. This is the first difference. Our Normal School Department is newly established, and life needs to be managed. The transformation of the environment cannot be handled properly by the school authorities alone. Teachers and students must work together to build it. Therefore, a student goes to another school to study, but comes to our school to create. This is the second difference.</p>
<p>(4) How is the curriculum structured?</p>
<p>Regarding the curriculum structure, we analyze it into three areas: first, basic training; second, political training; and third, professional training. The first academic year focuses on basic training. Most of the general subjects are completed in this year. The second academic year emphasizes both basic and professional training. The third academic year focuses on professional training, with political training running through each year.</p>
<p>We have revised the curriculum outline in accordance with the Ministry of Education's curriculum standards to suit our school's environment. Its main feature is its flexibility, allowing students to progress freely according to their talents, without being restricted.</p>
<p>(5) How is the internship arranged?</p>
<p>Elementary schools are the center of standardization, and the facilities of elementary education are the basis of normal education. We advocate that normal school students should be in contact with elementary schools and have relationships with elementary school students. In ordinary normal schools, students only go to elementary schools for internships in the last one or two months of the last semester. The theories and methods learned in the normal school for three years can be said to be completely useless at that time. It's not "the same thing" at all. Therefore, we advocate that normal school students should go to elementary schools from the first academic year. In the second semester of the third academic year, they should live with elementary school students completely. In this way, theory will not be theory and fact will not be fact. The procedures for going to elementary schools are as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p>First Academic Year Second Academic Year Third Semester</p>
<p>Visit Participate in Work Internship</p>
<p>(6) How many students are you planning to enroll now?</p>
<p>We will only enroll a maximum of 50 students for the first time. If local education authorities or those who wish to cultivate teachers and prepare to manage elementary education in the future wish to send junior high school graduates to our school, our school will provide considerable convenience.</p>

<p>Special Publication No. 2 for the 4th Anniversary of the Establishment of National Jinan University and the 25th Anniversary of the Founding of the School</p>
<h3>Letter to Students on Commemoration Day</h3>
<p>— Zheng Hongnian</p>
<p>To all students:</p>
<p>Today is the 25th anniversary of the founding of our school and the 4th anniversary of the establishment of the university. As I reflect on the past and present, emotions well up within me. With utmost sincerity, I speak on behalf of all the students of Jinan University! In the competition for survival among nations, the principle of natural selection is evident. Our ancestors sailed far to the shores of the sea, opening up the desolate lands of the South, spreading Chinese culture and education far into remote regions. However, due to the weakness of our nation, we were taken advantage of by imperialists, and we became as fish and meat on their chopping board. Now, the times have drastically changed, and the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly urgent. The United States controls the east, Britain controls the west, and Japan occupies the north. They are all poised and ready to strike, with the islands of Southeast Asia as their target. In the past, when the great powers were extracting wealth, our overseas compatriots could at least eke out a meager existence as "fish and meat," prolonging their last breath. But now, at this critical moment in the world's struggle for national survival, even being "fish and meat" is no longer an option for our overseas compatriots. You students come from overseas and have personally experienced everything. The marks of the whip are on your backs, the scarlet bloodstains are still visible, and tears still fill your eyes. How can you forget the pain in your hearts! As the sages of the past said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation." At this crucial moment for the survival of the entire nation, who can shirk this responsibility? Looking at the recent bankruptcies of overseas Chinese businesses and the declining number of overseas Chinese students returning to China, the perilous situation is fully revealed. When will our demise come? We are still leisurely lecturing and studying, with some time to spare. But in ten or a hundred years, the islands of Southeast Asia will be completely cut off from the Chinese nation. If the skin is gone, where will the fur attach itself? You students are studying at the school and should know that beyond the classrooms, there are the eyes of millions of overseas Chinese watching. The sound of your reading contains the pleas of millions of overseas Chinese. Every day wasted at school means losing a hundred years of opportunity in Southeast Asia. Every person who abandons their studies means cutting off the lives of thousands of overseas Chinese. Therefore, even if customs are declining, we Jinan University students must not decline. Even if customs are mired in despair, we Jinan University students must not become disillusioned. From now on, we must either abandon the pursuit of modern trends or remove the obscuration of material desires. We must strengthen our will, sharpen our wisdom, and strengthen our bodies. Then, we must return to those southern islands, awaken the national consciousness of our overseas compatriots, strengthen the national spirit of our overseas compatriots, and raise the national culture of our overseas compatriots. In this way, we can compete with the nations of the world and enable the Chinese nation to leap forward and become the master of the Pacific! This is my first hope for you students!</p>
<p>Our school was founded in the late Qing Dynasty. I personally participated in the initial establishment. At that difficult time, officials from Governor Duan down, as well as Mr. Chen Botao and Mr. Wen Bingzhong, provided the strongest support. Overseas, Minister Qian Nianqu, the envoy to the Netherlands, echoed our efforts. After a difficult start, we achieved a rough framework. Now, it is universally acknowledged that overseas Chinese education should be emphasized, and there is no room for doubt. At that time, however, we faced opposition from the Qing court, delays due to protracted discussions, and slander from petty people. It was fortunate that Jinan's life was maintained until the Xinhai Revolution before being interrupted. After the founding of the Republic of China, Jinan remained suspended. It was only after Mr. Huang Yanpei and Mr. Zhao Zhengping made repeated efforts that it was reopened. Later, the establishment of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Teacher Training, the Junior High School, and the Nanjing Women's Division, as well as the purchase of the school site and the construction of school buildings, were all due to Mr. Zhao Zhengping's tireless efforts! Since the year of Jiazi (1924), there have been repeated upheavals. Jinan has been able to advance in a roundabout way thanks to the efforts of Mr. Jiang Bohan. In 1927, when the National Revolutionary Army initially stabilized Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Jinan faced another crisis. I came to shoulder the heavy responsibility and expanded it into a university. Therefore, every inch of progress Jinan has made today is the result of the accumulation of efforts by our predecessors. Remembering the difficulties of the founding, we must not relax our efforts to maintain it! Education is a major plan for the nation for a hundred years. Overseas Chinese education is especially the gathering place of the nation's lifeline. Based on my conscience, I have devoted myself to overseas Chinese education. In the past four years, I have experienced several twists and turns, but I could not bear to entrust those I had nurtured to unworthy people. Even today, I still feel that Jinan's foundation is not yet solid, and my responsibility is not yet fulfilled, and the wishes of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen have not yet been realized. You students have been with me for a long time and know me well. Every word and action must prioritize the school, not seek personal gain that endangers the foundation of the school, nor indulge in temporary emotions that cut off the future of the school, nor believe in biased and radical heresies that sever the lifeblood of the school. Love yourself, therefore love others. Love the school, therefore love overseas compatriots. This is my second hope for you students.</p>
<p>Every era has had foreign enemies and external troubles. National turmoil and the vicissitudes of the world are common occurrences. The idea of a peaceful and prosperous world is merely a human ideal, no different from utopia. Today's youth shout slogans and rush back and forth, constantly saying they want to save the country and save society. But when it comes to delving deeply into learning, they say that we can only study when society is stable. Alas! How much of a person's life is left while waiting for the river to clear? The rise of turmoil is endless like a ring. If everyone blames each other, the chaos will never end. If everyone works together, order can be established immediately. A nation that stands in the 20th-century world cannot survive if its scholarship is not flourishing. If we do not delve deeply into scholarship to nourish its source and instead say, "We can only study when society is stable," we are putting the cart before the horse and making things more chaotic. In the past, when Napoleon dominated Europe, Prussia suffered greatly, as if in a dark night, not knowing the end. The philosopher Fichte carried his umbrella and entered Berlin, lecturing amidst the flames of war, thus opening the way for German scholarship. Should we not learn from this example? Since I became the president of the school, I have always told you, "Study without forgetting to save the country, and save the country without forgetting to study." Now, I will go further and say, "Only by studying can we save the country." You students grew up in Southeast Asia and have had the most contact with world culture. You should be able to understand the current state of scholarship in other countries. For example, there are countless specialized books on Southeast Asian issues written by Dutch, British, German, and French scholars. Even Japanese scholars have written more than a thousand. Looking back at our country, how many people are studying this vital issue? How many have studied it successfully and written specialized books? Even if there are some, how many are truly original works, apart from simply translating foreign works? We are still so ignorant about what is closely related to our pain. How much more so about the larger and more distant issues! If this is the case, then saving society and saving the country are just empty talk on paper, with no practical effect! From now on, you students should urgently bury yourselves in research. You should reduce or eliminate all non-essential tasks such as slogans, leaflets, and wall posters. Concentrate your energy on one thing, and then the advancement of scholarship can be expected, and the desire to save the country can be achieved. This is my third hope for you students!</p>
<p>Today's common saying is, "Strictly abide by discipline." Discipline means that in the family, children should abide by the discipline of children, in the school, students should abide by the discipline of students, and in the country and society, citizens should abide by the discipline of citizens. This is both for common adherence and for self-discipline. You students are either in university or in middle school. Those in middle school are either in high school or in junior high school. From junior high school to university, it takes ten years, and from junior high school to high school, it also takes six years. During the period of intellectual development, six years and ten years are as different as a century. University students have rich knowledge and a relatively stable will, and their reason is sufficient for self-discipline, so their words and actions can be autonomous. Junior high school students are still young and have limited experience. Every action must await the guidance of teachers. High school students are between the two, relying partly on the students' autonomy and partly on the guidance of teachers. You students are far away from your parents and brothers, and the connection between the school and the family is more difficult. The school also serves as a parent and teacher. From now on, you should be aware of your situation, understand the school's intention to protect you, be friendly to your classmates, respect your teachers, and abide by the discipline together. Middle school students should also be aware that they are in the stage of preparing tools and cultivating their character, and should develop a spirit of diligence and self-encouragement in preparation for undertaking heavy responsibilities and achieving distant goals in the future. This is my fourth hope for you students!</p>
<p>I have been the president of the school for four years, and I am getting old! I have exhausted my strength to lay a foundation for Jinan to repay the country and answer the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, and my private wish has been fulfilled. You students are making progress in your youth, and your future is bright. Not only is it what overseas compatriots expect, but it is also what the people of the country expect. I hope you will understand my intentions, promote and develop them, and complete the great cause. I have great hope for you!</p>
<h3>Commemoration Ceremony</h3>
<p>— (Photo by Ye Changlie)</p>
<p>Opening address by President Zheng Hongnian</p>
<h3>Overview of the Venue</h3>
<p>The venue was in the Zhenru school buildings. A tall archway was erected in front of the gate, decorated with flags and ribbons. Upon entering, the path was lined with specially made red commemorative flags of various colors, fluttering in the wind. There were signs everywhere to provide directions. The offices, dormitories, classrooms, etc., were all decorated with colored paper and lanterns for lighting candles and carrying lanterns at night. The exhibition of achievements from both the university and middle school departments was located in the middle school office, science hall, and large classroom. Celebration slogans were visible everywhere, fresh and beautiful, making people feel refreshed.</p>
<h3>Commemoration Ceremony</h3>
<p>The meeting opened at 9 a.m. yesterday. First, cannons were fired and music was played for the flag-raising ceremony. An archway was erected in front of the auditorium, with the words "Sound Education Reaching the South." Guests and graduates gathered inside and outside the archway and entered the auditorium in an orderly manner. Electric lights were embedded along the second floor of the auditorium, brightly illuminating the hall. The president and the deans of the five colleges were seated on the east side of the stage, and the guests were seated on the west side. The Western orchestra and the graduates' seats were located near the stage on the west side. Famous flowers and exotic plants were arranged with exquisite detail.</p>
<p>Address by Chairman President Zheng Hongnian</p>
<p>Chairman President Zheng gave the opening speech, briefly stating that today is the combined celebration of the 25th anniversary of the school's founding and the 4th anniversary of the university's establishment. The original founding date was March 23rd, and the preparations for the university were completed on June 14th. The school affairs meeting decided to hold the ceremony today, which is also the day four years ago when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Suzhou, and the Central Education Commission appointed brothers to the school to take over. He expressed his gratitude to everyone for attending the commemorative meeting and recalled that the commemorative speech had clearly stated the history of the school from 25 years ago to the present, so there was no need to report it again. What he wanted to talk about today was the position that the school's education would achieve. The greatest goal of overseas Chinese education is to build the Republic of China and to build a great harmony, and to be the vanguard of building a great harmony, so that the overseas Chinese elders can naturally achieve freedom and equality. We must fully express ourselves in academics, so that society recognizes that the meaning of overseas Chinese education is great, and the footprints of overseas Chinese are all over the world. Their virtues must not only be brought into play but also preserved and promoted. (Omission) Today is also the graduation ceremony of various departments and the celebration of the numerous championships won in sports over the years.</p>
<p>Addresses by Guests</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Li Zhaohuan: Briefly stated that today is the 25th anniversary of your school and the completion of the fourth year of the university, and a graduation ceremony is being held at the same time. I was invited by your president to come and participate, and I would like to offer a few words to the students. Graduating students, from today onwards, you will leave the scope of the school and enter the stage of society. If you want to use what you have learned to build the country and fight for freedom in the world, then the question to be decided is to ask yourself, "What contribution do I have to make to the country and society?" What is the purpose of entering university to study? Scholars in ancient times must have had special ambitions, that is, to devote their lives to the pursuit of knowledge and the investigation of things. Confucius had three thousand disciples, all of whom worked hard for various social problems and the rights and wrongs of mankind. The Four Books and Five Classics are all based on this purpose. (Omission)</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Xu Peihuang: Briefly stated that there are many things worthy of admiration at today's grand gathering of your school. Graduating students and students still in school should take this opportunity to constantly remind themselves to move forward and seek further development. This is my sincere intention. In particular, graduating students must pay attention to two things: (1) Most students have great hopes and high ambitions while at school, but the social environment, whether at home or abroad, is equally bad. Therefore, when graduating students leave school and enter the world, they are easily discouraged and become decadent, and even assimilated into the evil society. According to surveys, there is only one university student among every 20,000 people in our country. With the strength of one person, they are subject to the influence of 19,999 people. Without a strong will, they will not only fail to transform society but will also be transformed by society. I sincerely hope that graduating students will go out and transform others, not be transformed by others. (2) Serving society should be placed before serving oneself, that is, we should put public affairs before private affairs. The Premier spoke of "the world is for all," and foreigners often say that the Chinese are like loose sand, who only know self-interest and not public interest. Therefore, I sincerely hope that graduating students will serve society with this intention and be a role model for others.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Pan Xulun: Briefly stated that I have a deep relationship with this school, and there is no need to dwell on trivial matters. There are many things to praise about this school, but the most admirable thing is sports. No university in the country can compare.</p>
<p>Although sports are only one aspect of intellectual education, moral education, aesthetic education, and group education, Jinan's moral, intellectual, aesthetic, and group education have all made progress in recent years, but compared with the rapid progress of sports, they seem somewhat inadequate. Therefore, I hope that Jinan's sports will continue to make rapid progress in the future, not only winning glory in the country but also displaying its prestige in the world. I especially hope that Jinan's moral, intellectual, aesthetic, and group education will advance as rapidly as sports. This year is the 25th anniversary, and in another five years, it will be the 30th anniversary. I sincerely hope that my expectations will be realized at that time. Students, work hard!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Zhongfan delivered a speech on behalf of the faculty and staff</p>
<p>Briefly stated that today is the 25th anniversary of the school's establishment and the completion of the university's four years. From the perspective of the age and system of education in our country, one enters kindergarten at the age of six, and after primary school education, middle school education, and university education, one completes university education at the age of twenty-four. Today is the 25th anniversary of this school. Compared with this example, the students have left the era of seeking knowledge and are participating in the period of society, and they have also left the era of ideals and are entering the period of practice. This situation is worth congratulating the graduates and also encouraging the graduates.</p>
<p>You students were all pure young people while at school, and what you expected was nothing but ideals. Many people say that ideals have been dissolved by society, but this is not a concern. For us to do things, first, we must have ideals, second, we must have plans, and third, we must have experiments. With ideals, we will be motivated to work hard, with plans, we can proceed step by step, and with experiments, we can distinguish between good and evil. However, the fundamental key is to have great ambitions. The so-called great ambitions cannot be based on individual interests but should be based on the happiness of mankind and the survival of the country. (Omission)</p>

<h3>Two Sections of Living Poetry, Using the Rhyme of the School President's School Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Circles of Dreams, Rounder and Rounder. Supporting the Heads of Youth. The Rooster Crows Thrice, the World Turns White. A Lifetime of Thoughtfulness for China. The Brocade Zither, Long and Long, with Twenty-Five Strings. Each String Plucks Out a Mini Spring and Autumn. Expressing the East Wind, the Great Uncle. Leaving Words All Over the Fiery Continent.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Seeing Master Seated Wielding Brush, Feeling Moved, Immediately Took and Showed it to Tianfang Sensei, Who Within Moments Composed a Living Poem, So Amidst Great Busyness, Also Rhymed in Accordance with the Original</h3>
<p>— Li Bangdong</p>
<p>All day long, strings and songs extend congratulations.  Patting myself, I smile, recalling the beginnings.  Wind and clouds are naturally my lifelong ambition.  Plowing and weeding have always been the plan of those who see ahead.  Intellectual pursuits have long since reached a superior realm.  Achievements and merit are sufficient for a thousand autumns.  I am ashamed that my humble efforts are small.  But I am happy to see branches of the same kind spread throughout the land.</p>

Besides a small portion that is publicly displayed, the rest is stored. The most valuable items are the platinumware and the weights of the balance.</p>
<p>The biology department has a larger number of specimens, all of which have been displayed and divided into six groups. Among them, the biological evolution model is especially ingenious and well-made. All specimens have been collected and made over the years.

<h3>Ma Xiangbo and Others Initiate the Organization of the Northeast Culture Translation and Compilation Society</h3>
<p>The three northeastern provinces are rich in special products and vast in territory, making them a treasure trove for our country. For the past twenty years, the East and North have been pressing against each other, and their research and investigation of the three provinces have been very detailed and precise. The Chinese people are almost lagging behind in comparison. Ma Xiangbo, Cai Zimin, and others, having seen this, have specifically initiated the organization of the Northeast Culture Translation and Compilation Society. Its purpose is to awaken the Chinese people, to make them all aware of the wealth of the Northeast, to urgently initiate development, and to make them aware of the danger of the Northeast, to jointly plan resistance. The work plans to temporarily focus on translating books published in Japan and Russia on the Northeast issue, specially hiring experts, conducting on-the-spot investigations, and compiling specialized books on the Northeast issue, editing textbooks on the history and geography of the Northeast for primary and secondary schools, assisting various groups in organizing Northeast inspection tours, and collecting publications from various countries on Northeast culture. Currently, the names of the initiators already include Wu Tiecheng, Mu Xiangyue, Wang Yunwu, Hu Shuhua, Liu Zhanen, Shi Liangcai, and from the Liaoning area, Yan Baohang, Lu Naigeng, Xu Zhen, Du Chongyuan, and many others. The society’s address is temporarily set at No. 6, Difeng Lane, Difeng Road, Shanghai. It is reported that the society is willing to be responsible for consultation and introduction for those who are interested in researching the Northeast issue and those who wish to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the Northeast, and can provide them with various travel conveniences.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Sends a Telegram to Du Yuesheng</h3>
<p>The Area Within Hundreds of Li of Gan City is Extremely Peaceful</p>
<p>Rumors in Shanghai are Purely Communist Lies</p>
<p>Recently, rumors about He Yingqin's movements have been rife. He had previously telegraphed Shanghai to dispel the rumors. Yesterday, He sent another telegram to Du Yuesheng, saying: "He Jiwu, China National Aviation Corporation, confidential, please forward to Mr. Du Yuesheng for his kind attention. I have received your telegram, and I am very grateful for your concern. The communist bandits in southern Jiangxi are still entrenched in the Ningdu and Guangchang areas, appearing and disappearing from time to time. Our troops are conducting mobile warfare at any time, and there is frequent contact with the bandits. There are no major changes in the situation. Currently, the various armies have successively concentrated towards their destinations. As soon as the Commander-in-Chief arrives in person, they can advance in separate routes to suppress them. It will not be difficult to eliminate them in the shortest period of time. The area within hundreds of li of Gan City is extremely peaceful. The rumors in Shanghai are purely intentional lies fabricated by imperialists and communist bandits. Please do not believe them. He Yingqin bows respectfully. Yuan."</p>

<h3>Various Trade Tax Rules Committees Telegraph Recommendations on Implementation Details of Business Tax</h3>
<p>Respect Central Government Intent, Vigorously Provide Relief</p>
<p>Incorporate Previous Interpretations for Compliance</p>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of various trade associations in this city telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the Business Tax Law drafted by the Legislative Yuan had been promulgated and implemented by the National Government meeting on June 13th. They specifically requested the Ministry of Finance to draft detailed implementation rules for the Business Tax Law to provide relief. The text of the telegram is recorded below: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance of the National Government of Nanjing, we have examined the Business Tax Law, which has been drafted by the Legislative Yuan and resolved for promulgation and implementation by the 24th National Government meeting. However, the entire text of the Business Tax Law contains only thirteen articles, which are merely outlines. Regarding the two points to be noted when the Central Political Conference resolves the tax rates and collection levels for various industries, namely, not to disturb the people and not to hinder commercial development, how to ensure accurate compliance, and how to compile the various interpretations and measures repeatedly issued by your ministry into a chapter, all depend on the meticulous drafting of the implementation rules for the Business Tax Law. The drafting of the implementation rules is actually the responsibility of your ministry. At the beginning of the promulgation, we venture to offer a personal opinion, hoping for your consideration. Article 4 of the Business Tax Law stipulates that those who take the total business income as the tax base shall be levied at a rate of 2 to 10 per mille, and those who take the capital as the tax base shall be levied at a rate of 4 to 20 per mille. Furthermore, Article 5 of the Business Tax Law stipulates that when the business income is taken as the tax base, those whose total business income is less than 1,000 yuan are exempt from tax; when the business capital is taken as the tax base, those whose business capital is less than 500 yuan are exempt from tax; and when the business net income is taken as the tax base, those whose net income is less than 100 yuan are exempt from tax. This is inconsistent with the provisions of the supplementary measures for the collection of business tax in various provinces passed by the previous Central Political Conference, which stipulated that those who take the business turnover as the tax base shall not exceed 2 per mille, and those who take the capital as the tax base shall not exceed 20 per mille, and that those whose capital is less than 500 yuan shall be exempt from business tax. Moreover, Article 6 of the supplementary measures stipulates that wholesale businesses may be appropriately reduced compared to retail businesses, which is not included in the Business Tax Law, which violates the principle of not hindering commercial development resolved by the Central Government. We request that your ministry respect the intent of the Central Government, vigorously provide relief in the drafting of the implementation rules to facilitate implementation. As for Chinese and foreign merchants in the concessions, they should pay taxes equally. The Executive Yuan has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that all overseas Chinese merchants in the concessions should comply with the business tax collected by our country and must not resist. The collection of business tax should be based on industry. Those who operate multiple commodities in one store should determine the tax rate based on their main business. Furthermore, estate agents who only buy and do not sell, and businesses that sell tap water, cold water, and boiled water, etc., should be exempt from business tax. Your ministry has successively issued clear orders for compliance, and we request that they be fully incorporated in the drafting of the implementation rules for compliance. We are eagerly awaiting your reply. The Tax Rules Research Committee of various trade associations in Shanghai, with the seal of Han."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province yesterday, saying: "For implementation, regarding the Industrial Department's Order No. 2327, it states, 'Silk is a special product of our country. At the beginning of maritime trade, it was sold in large quantities overseas. However, as Japan, France, and other countries keenly researched it, it gradually declined. Recently, since the invention of artificial silk, not only has the export of our special product suffered a sharp decline, but the import of artificial silk has increased year by year. The monetary loss is alarming. At a time when gold prices are soaring and artificial silk prices are rising at any time, it should be possible to reject foreign goods and revitalize domestic production. However, the trend is irresistible. Looking at what is displayed in the markets and what people wear, most of what is called silk is a mixture of artificial silk and natural silk or cotton yarn. If we do not urgently seek a remedy, how can we plug the leaks? The remedy must be to investigate the preferences of foreigners, improve genuine silk to meet the needs of foreigners, and conduct thorough research on artificial silk, setting up factories to manufacture it ourselves to reduce the import of foreign goods. The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, having seen this, ordered the consulates stationed abroad to investigate the silk tariffs of various countries and the preferences of their people for silk, and report to the Ministry, which compiled them into tables and distributed them to the silk producers, municipal governments, and bureaus to follow and improve. Now, the Consulate General stationed in Korea has sent samples of Japanese artificial silk fabrics that sell well in Korea. After compiling them into a table, in addition to issuing orders separately, we hereby order the dispatch of this document to the Civil Affairs Department, ordering it to forward it to the silk industry associations and silk manufacturers in various parts of the province for detailed examination and imitation, so that the import of foreign goods can be gradually reduced. If we can strive for perfection and further promote exports, then what is lost here may be gained there. This Ministry has high hopes,' etc., and the table is attached. In addition to issuing a general order, we hereby transcribe the original text and order the county magistrate to forward it to the chambers of commerce and silk industry associations and silk manufacturers under his jurisdiction to comply with and implement. This order."</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Recovers Slaughter Tax Arrears</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Regarding the takeover of the slaughter tax case in the urban area by this Bureau, we approved your Chamber's letter No. 85 on May 9th, instructing that butchers be temporarily allowed to release slaughtered pigs and sheep on a counted basis. All taxes payable from May 1st to 15th should be paid up according to the number after the entire case is resolved, and your Chamber is responsible for this. Now, after investigation, a total of 13,311 pigs were slaughtered from May 1st to 15th, and a total of 186 sheep were slaughtered, totaling 5,328.49 yuan in slaughter tax. Accordingly, we have listed the statistics of slaughtered pigs and sheep, and copied the daily reports from each tax collection office. We are writing to your Chamber for verification, hoping that you will quickly collect the full amount and remit it to the Bureau by the deadline, so that we can make a receipt and clear the accounts, and we hope to receive a reply." It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the letter to the Fresh Meat Industry Association to urge payment.</p>

Chairman Chiang could not attend in person because he was about to go to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, so he specially sent his aide-de-camp Yang Hu and Mayor Zhang as representatives to pay tribute. After the tribute, a speech was given on the life of General Lu, and the listeners were all saddened. Then, his family thanked the guests, and then a group photo was taken before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's News on the National Products Emporium Case</h3>
<p>Still Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>The China National Products United Emporium was ordered to close by the Public Works Department. Six days have passed, and the matter remains unresolved. Various sectors have unanimously provided assistance. The situation yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>Convening a Meeting  Since the establishment of the Negotiation Committee for the China National Products Emporium, the committee has been working on sorting out the facts and collecting evidence in preparation for negotiations. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, the committee received a letter from the Public Works Department forwarded by the Amusement Department of the National Products Emporium.  Therefore, a meeting was convened yesterday morning for detailed discussion. It was immediately resolved to refute the letter vehemently based on legal facts. Ren Jinpin was appointed to draft the rebuttal, which is scheduled to be delivered to the Public Works Department this morning. Tong Yuanling has also been appointed to draft the outline of the committee's organization, it is said.</p>
<p>Disseminating Information Separately The Negotiation Committee of the National Products Emporium has dispatched more than twenty people, including Leng Qinfang, Jiang Xiaoan, Yan Donglian, Zhu Kuiguang, and Ni Linshu, to Zhabei, Shanghai South, Pudong, and other areas to distribute the National Products Emporium Daily and other promotional materials. The Manufacturers' Association, starting yesterday, used two automobiles fully loaded with promotional materials to distribute them to various locations, so that the general public could understand the truth of this matter.</p>
<p>Coal Industry's Opinion  A letter from the Shanghai Coal Trade Association states: "To all merchants and citizens of Shanghai, be it known: On the afternoon of June 9th, the Public Works Department of the International Settlement suddenly ordered the China National Products Emporium at No. 4 Jing'an Temple Road to cease operations, locking its doors and insulting its staff. This unreasonable and tyrannical behavior was as if facing a great enemy. The emporium had not violated any prohibitions, yet it was shut down. The staff had not committed any crimes, yet they were insulted. Such barbaric acts have never been heard of before. Is this what civilization and progress are supposed to be like? We, coal industry colleagues, feel deeply indignant about this incident. The authorities in the Settlement are so brutal. If a fundamental solution is not sought, great disasters will befall us in the future. The National Convention has already declared the abolition of unequal treaties. The Shanghai Settlement was born out of unequal treaties. Now that the treaties have been abolished, the Settlement should be reclaimed. To prevent extraordinary disasters, the problem must be tackled at its root. Therefore, we, coal industry colleagues, propose that all citizens urge our government to swiftly determine the date for the reclamation of the Settlement. And all of us citizens should work together to support the government, aiming to achieve the goal of reclaiming the Settlement in the shortest possible time. Only then will those barbaric and brutal imperialists have no means to carry out their schemes. We hereby issue this public announcement and earnestly hope for everyone's courageous uprising. This is our sincere wish. The Shanghai Coal Trade Association respectfully bows."</p>
<p>Cosmetics Industry's Letters and Telegrams  The Shanghai Cosmetics Trade Association, regarding the sealing of the National Products Emporium, has already held a meeting and resolved to send letters and telegrams separately to the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting serious negotiations. The original text of the letters and telegrams are recorded below: Telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry: "To the esteemed Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry: The China National Products United Emporium on Nanjing Road in Shanghai is organized by famous domestic goods factories in our country. Although it has not been established for long, its achievements are remarkable. Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, the Public Settlement Police, under the pretext of an issue with the Amusement Department's permit, destroyed Chinese national products, revealing their ambition for economic aggression. They completely sealed the emporium and arrested and insulted the staff. Such disregard for national sovereignty is intolerable. If serious negotiations are not conducted, how can national sovereignty be protected and national products be defended? Our association, as a commercial group, should send a telegram requesting your review and instructions. We kindly ask for your favorable response." Letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: "We hereby inform you that on the 12th of this month, we received a telegram from the China National Products United Emporium stating that their emporium was ordered to close by the police on the 9th of this month, the entire emporium was sealed, and staff members were arrested, requesting assistance. Based on this, considering that the imperialists, relying on the protection of their unequal treaties, have taken such illegal actions, disregarding Chinese national sovereignty, destroying Chinese national products, and engaging in economic aggression, it is truly outrageous. In addition to sending telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting swift and serious negotiations, we specifically request that your esteemed association immediately send another letter to the Public Works Department, requesting the immediate resumption of the emporium's business and a formal written apology to protect national sovereignty and defend national products." Letter to the United Emporium: "We hereby reply to your telegram received on the 12th of this month, informing us that your emporium was suddenly ordered to close by the police on the afternoon of June 9th, the entire emporium was sealed, and staff members were arrested, requesting assistance. Our association has already sent separate letters and telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting swift and serious negotiations to protect national sovereignty and defend national products. We are now informing you for your reference."</p>
<p>Response from Other Cities The Wuxian Iron Loom Silk Weaving and Satin Industry sent a telegram yesterday stating: "We hereby inform you that the sudden closure of the National Products Emporium by the police was ostensibly due to the equipment of the amusement park, but in reality, it was a venomous scheme by the imperialist pawns to destroy national goods, disregard national sovereignty, and violate the law. All those with blood in their veins are filled with indignation. The central government is advocating for the national goods movement, and the government has already announced the recovery of concession legal rights. If this incident is not seriously negotiated, where is national sovereignty? Where does the law exist? We, the members of the association, vow to provide full support as long as we have breath. We hereby send this telegram, awaiting your instructions." Furthermore, the Wuhu National Goods Company and the Wuxian National Goods Relief Association also sent telegrams yesterday stating: "Having read in the newspaper that the Shanghai National Products Emporium was suddenly illegally closed by the Public Works Department abusing its power on a good afternoon, and that they even committed violence and arrested staff, the news has deeply angered us. Although the imperialists harbor hatred and jealousy towards our national products, the emporium is conducting legitimate business. How can it be shut down without reason? Moreover, at a time when concession legal rights are being recovered, the police dare to act recklessly, treating us as slaves. If this is tolerable, what is intolerable? We, as comrades, are willing to provide full support for negotiations and will not rest until the perpetrators are punished, an apology is made, and compensation is paid. Finally, we hope for a united uprising to strive for the recovery of the concessions and seek a thorough solution. We are deeply concerned and await your orders."</p>
<h3>Record of the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Lawyers Association</h3>
<p>Insufficient Legal Quorum</p>
<p>Changed to a Discussion Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association held an extraordinary general membership meeting yesterday (Sunday) at 2:00 PM at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Xizang Road. Members attending included Tan Yigong, Liu Zuwang, Wu Guotai, Yu Zufeng, Cai Nipei, Lu Shaozong, Zhai Cheng, Tang Yingsong, Shi Qinghua, Yao Wenshou, Chen Zemin, Yao Jian, Liu Xiang, Shan Yuhua, Lu Jianai, Yang Chunlu, Chen Renlang, Chen Ruichen, Yu Zhongluo, Zhang Feixiong, Wu Guochang, Dong Qingyu, Hu Yuanjun, and others, totaling eighty people. The Shanghai District Court and the Special District Court dispatched prosecutors Yang Qi and Qian Hongye to the meeting to supervise. At 3:30 PM, the meeting was called to order with a bell. The presidium, including Tan Yigong and Lu Shaozong, took their seats and performed the customary ceremonies. Chairman Tan Yigong reported that the association had 640 members, but only 80 had attended, which was insufficient for a legal quorum. He stated that the meeting would have to be changed to a discussion session. Since the discussion session, according to the regulations, did not have the power to vote, he briefly reported the situation. Then, members such as Yang Chunlu, Liu Zuwang, Lu Jianai, Shan Yuhua, and Zhai Cheng expressed their opinions, believing that discussion still had room for exchange, but no power to vote. Therefore, member Zhai Cheng took the stage and stated that the proposals for building an association hall put forward by members Chen and Tang each had their own merits. He believed that the association only held two general meetings each year, in spring and autumn, and renting a venue cost very little. There was no need to rush to resolve the construction issue. Moreover, the original association hall was centrally located. As long as a way could be found to expand and add a venue on the original site, it would be feasible. He suggested that since the autumn general meeting was not far away, his opinion could be presented as a suggestion at the autumn general meeting, or submitted in writing. Everyone applauded in agreement. Then, Chairman Tan Yigong explained the important resolution regarding the International Lawyers Association issue at the third representative assembly of the National Lawyers Association held in Hangzhou on June 1st. The Shanghai Lawyers Association was responsible for preparing for the International Lawyers Association, and he described the process. All motions should be submitted for discussion again at the autumn general meeting. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Half-Month Bonus for Railway Workers to be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>Railway Funds Should Suffice for Immediate Disbursement</p>
<p>The case of the supplementary payment of a half-month bonus at the end of last year to workers on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways was announced to all stations yesterday by the heads of the two railway transportation departments upon receiving orders. The original text stated: "Case is based on instruction No. 682 from the Management Bureau, opening with 'To be followed accordingly.' Upon reviewing the supplementary payment of half a month's year-end bonus for the nineteenth year to the workers of the two railways, considering the current economic situation of the railways, it is difficult to approve. However, taking into account the workers' difficult living conditions,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Page Four</p>
<p>it is hereby approved to grant an additional half-month bonus to show compassion. Internal and external staff are still not eligible for distribution. This supplementary bonus for workers should only be issued after the repayment of this year's interest and a confirmed surplus. No requests should be made based on this precedent in the future. Obey and act accordingly.' This was announced in instruction No. 234 on February 23rd. However, the amount of this half-month bonus for workers is substantial and should be investigated and verified. It should be supplemented as soon as railway funds are slightly more abundant to comfort the public's expectations. In addition to separate orders, it is hereby ordered that you obey and immediately prepare the vouchers for the half-month bonus for each worker under your jurisdiction within five days and send them to the accounting office for the bureau to order the accounting office to verify and issue them when railway funds are slightly more abundant. This order, etc., has been received. It is hereby urgently conveyed to each section chief, segment chief, inspector, and stationmaster to prepare the half-month bonus vouchers based on the salary amounts for December of last year for each worker under their jurisdiction within three days of receiving this letter and send them to the office for forwarding to the bureau chief to order the accounting office to verify and distribute them."</p>

<h3>Capital's Observation on Factory Law</h3>
<p>Wang Yunwu's Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Organizations Labor Problem Research Association held its second lecture on June 11th at 2:00 PM at the National Young Women's Christian Association on Nanjing Road. More than ten representatives from various organizations attended. Mr. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, was invited to speak on "Capital's Observation on Factory Law." Mr. Wang first stated that his opinions on factory law were often said by the capital to be leaning towards the labor side, and by the labor side to be leaning towards the capital side. In fact, he was completely neutral in his observations and adhering to his conscience in his arguments. He was not speaking on behalf of the capital, but only presenting the opinions he had heard from the capital, combined with his own opinions. The intention of factory law is to seek the welfare of labor, but to seek the permanent welfare of labor, the interests of capital must also be taken into account. The interests of labor and capital are like lips and teeth, mutually dependent. There is no way that the welfare of labor can be permanently maintained if the capital is depleted. The articles of factory law protecting female and child labor are recognized by all countries and all sectors, because child and female labor lack the power of self-help and solidarity and must rely on the law for protection. However, the article that female labor should not work at night, although the principle is excellent, is feared to be difficult in practice. In spinning factories, most of the labor is female. If female labor does not do night work, then it will be necessary to hire male labor instead, which will create problems for the livelihood of female labor. Regarding the sanitary facilities and all safety equipment stipulated by the factory law, this is a matter of utmost urgency. Even if there are some objections from the workers, if you examine it carefully, under the safety equipment, the worker's danger is reduced, which is also in the interest of the capital. The same goes for injury compensation. Some in the capital believe that the compensation is too high and they cannot afford it, but if you think of the pitifulness of the disabled workers, you may be relieved. Regarding the shortening of working hours, the capital also has a lot of dissatisfaction, thinking that even twelve hours of work is not enough production. If it is changed to eight hours, the loss to the factory will be unimaginable. This depends on scientific management methods. The capital's fear is in the reduction of production rate, not in the length of working hours. If the speed can be increased under scientific management to increase production, then the factory will be happy to plant its own welfare. However, the power of management must be in the hands of the factory, otherwise, the driving will not be effective, and production will have no way to increase. As a result, it is not only bad for the capital, but also for the labor. The factory meeting is a very good principle, but its regulations are quite misleading. That is, in the current trade union system, in addition to the manager and factory director, any staff can join the meeting, then when organizing the factory meeting, the attendees are called both sides, but in reality, it is the labor's sole discretion. If these kinds of regulations can be revised again, the misunderstanding will have no way to occur, and true labor-capital cooperation can also be realized.</p>
<h3>Various Labor Unions Request the Implementation of Resolutions on the Labor Movement</h3>
<p>The various labor unions of Shanghai jointly declared regarding the matter of requesting the central government to implement the resolutions on the labor movement passed by the National Convention: "Since the close of the National Convention, in less than a month, the Fifth Plenary Session was held again on the 13th, and all the resolutions of the National Convention will be passed by the Fifth Plenary Session and gradually implemented. This spirit of consistent knowledge and action, and unremitting struggle, is not diminished by the proliferation of rumors. We, the entire nation, who look forward to governance with great anticipation, can only support the central government and sincerely pray for its realization. However, the resolutions of the National Convention are comprehensive and extensive, and the people's livelihood and national economy are all based on them. Therefore, the responsibility for implementation depends even more on our entire nation, with the spirit of being in the same boat, sharing weal and woe, and the determination to endure pain, work hard, and bear hardship, to share the burden and make every effort, so that we can progress step by step and prosper day by day. The National Convention not only accepts the Premier's legacy, but also focuses on the earnest implementation after acceptance. Only when the entire nation can earnestly implement the Premier's legacy can peaceful unification be permanently maintained, and the national economy and people's livelihood can have a day of prosperity. This is what our entire nation should strive for day and night, and not allow the slightest懈怠。 This association and others occupy a central position in the national labor movement and bear a major responsibility for the national revolution. We are anxiously worried about failure day and night. We have been entrusted with the passage of resolutions by the National Convention on four major cases concerning the labor movement: one is the case of relieving unemployed workers, the second is the case of promulgating special labor protection laws, the third is the case of thoroughly revising the Trade Union Law and the Factory Law, and the fourth is the case of organizing national and provincial/municipal/county general trade unions. These four are fundamental countermeasures for rectifying the labor movement and are also the urgent demands of more than ten million workers across the country. They have all been resolved by the National Convention and submitted to the National Government for verification and handling. We believe that they can be implemented as soon as possible, and the predicament of the labor movement will gradually decrease, and the Premier's agricultural and industrial policies will have the possibility of realization. The entire labor movement will move towards the right goal and be introduced into the right track. Looking forward to the future, our hopes are extremely high. We are pleased to meet the grand occasion of the Fifth Plenary Session, and this association respectfully implores all the attendees with 120,000 points of enthusiasm to pay close attention to the above-mentioned resolutions that are of great importance. The Central Government's determination to support labor and realize labor policies can be determined by this action at this time. This association and others are dedicated to the revolution and support the central government. This ambition will not change. We sincerely state our words and hope that all sectors will come forward and teach us." This is declared by the Shanghai Postal Workers Union, the Shanghai Publishing Industry Trade Union, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Trade Union, the Sixth District Water and Electricity Industry Trade Union, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Trade Union, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Trade Union, the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Steamboat Wood Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Sauce Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Newspaper Delivery Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Music Industry Trade Union, the Shanghai Pharmacy Industry Trade Union, etc., more than one hundred trade unions.</p>
<h3>News on the Guanghua Factory Labor Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>After a dispute occurred among the workers of the Guanghua Factory, more than ten workers, including the detained worker Yan A'er, were released on bail by the Municipal Party Headquarters. News from various parties is recorded below:</p>
<p>Questioning by the Social Affairs Bureau Seeing the expansion of the labor strike at the factory, the Social Affairs Bureau summoned representatives from both labor and capital for questioning at 8:00 AM yesterday. Labor representatives Liu Jintai, Guo Jiguang, and the dismissed workers Cao Zhanglin, Yan Jinchang, and others attended. Capital representatives Gu Yongquan and Qian Gantian, and Chairman Xu Zhi attended. The results of the questioning were reported to the bureau director for review and handling.</p>
<p>Condolences from Various Labor Unions Representatives from the Shanghai First District Shipbuilding Industry Union, including Long Peiyun; representatives from the Shanghai First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, Tang Junsheng; Zhang Yinsheng, Zhang A'mao, Zhang Shunjun, Zhang Lisheng from the Second District Water and Electricity Union; Qian Yinglu from the Toothbrush Industry Union; Bao Jiasheng from the First District Paper Industry Union; He Yunzhou from the Ninth District Carpentry Union; and workers from various mercerizing and dyeing factories visited to express their condolences and expressed their willingness to provide financial assistance and support the factory. They called for the expulsion of Gu Yongquan.</p>
<p>Meeting of Factory Team Leaders The Mercerizing Office of the Shanghai Dyeing Industry Main Union held a meeting of team leaders from the Guanghua Factory yesterday. Important resolutions and reported items: (1) The situation of negotiating for the release of the workers; (2) The situation of questioning by the Social Affairs Bureau; (3) The process of assistance from various labor unions. Matters for discussion: (1) Under the leadership of the foremen, work should continue while awaiting the solution of the Party and government organs; (2) Unanimous insistence on expelling Gu Yongquan from the factory; (3) Issuing a declaration exposing Gu Yongquan's past oppression; (4) Issuing a letter to the workers.</p>
<p>News from the Guanghua Factory A letter from the Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory states: "The Guanghua Factory has suffered significant losses over the years, and the shareholders have largely lost interest in operating it. For the sake of the livelihood of more than 300 workers, we have been trying hard to maintain it. However, the cause of the losses is actually due to the workers' poor performance. Therefore, the general manager has been searching for talent from all directions to save the crisis and prevent more than 300 workers from suffering from cold and hunger. Later, through the introduction of the factory affairs manager Qian, Gu Yongquan was hired as the factory manager. After Gu took office, he deeply understood the cause of the losses, so he immediately promulgated factory regulations approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. Since March, he has been operating carefully, making major improvements and sparing no effort in strictly enforcing the factory regulations. The workers have also been able to get on track, but habits have been formed, which has triggered the workers' resentment. (Omission) The fuse of this labor strike was caused by the fact that worker Zhu Linhou had been given major demerits and was dismissed according to the law. Later, through the mediation of the industry union, he admitted to writing a certificate to the factory. The factory also agreed to reinstate him, but the union's guarantee letter was vaguely worded and did not conform to the facts. The factory deemed the letter unacceptable. The worker Zhu Linhou resolutely entered the factory to work, and Gu Yongquan notified the foremen that the worker's procedures were not yet complete and that he should not work for the time being. He would be reinstated when the official guarantee letter from the union arrived. Zhu Linhou temporarily did not leave the factory. This was on the 6th of this month. On the morning of the 9th, at around 6:00 AM, Zhu Linhou entered the factory as usual. Gu Yongquan personally advised him, and Zhu left. However, Cao Zhanglin, who was being used by others, incited a factory-wide strike. At the same time, worker Cao Wenqi grabbed Gu Yongquan's collar and shouted to beat him. At once, hundreds responded, and He Boxing and others also rushed forward, beating him arbitrarily, causing Gu to suffer injuries and tear his uniform. They broke into the office, overturned tables and chairs, and threw bowls and plates. The scene was chaotic. In the evening, Liu Jintai instructed the workers to stay in the factory and made unbearable remarks. Despite the repeated勸戒 of Police Officer Wang from the police station, even until his lips were dry, it was still ineffective. Until the evening of the 11th, the workers still did not leave the factory. Liu Jintai and others then had the workers lock the door, surrounding the general manager and Gu Yongquan, and demanding three conditions: (1) Factory Manager Gu Yongquan must be immediately suspended and expelled from the factory; (2) The factory must never be closed; (3) The ten foremen must be responsible in the future and must sign immediately. The general manager felt that this unreasonable coercion would cut off the workers' livelihood and was absolutely unacceptable. Police Officer Wang, seeing the dispute, came forward to mediate impartially, but Liu Jintai and others incited the workers to beat Police Officer Wang, regardless of the circumstances, until Wang suffered serious injuries. Bearing the pain, he pretended to leave the factory, reported to District Chief Wang, and led a large team of police officers to the factory. In addition to Liu Jintai, a total of fifteen people, including Cao Zhanglin, were arrested. However, the fifteen arrested have been released on bail and are working as usual."</p>
<h3>The Suspected Ramming of a British Warship is Perhaps Not the "Yu Da"</h3>
<p>Confirmed by News from the Company and Weihai</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: Rumors suggest that the British submarine "Paston" collided with the "Yu Da" of the Shanghai Haichang Steamship Company. Five days have passed, and Haichang Company has still not received any reports, leading to suspicion. The information gathered yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>What was Heard in Weihai. A Xinsheng News Agency reporter visited a sailor, aboard the Taigu Tongzhou steamer, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Weihai, and inquired about the truth of the collision between the "Yu Da" and the British submarine. According to him, workers at the Weihai dock said that on the 9th, five English miles from Liugong Island near Weihaiwei, the British submarine "Paston" was submerged in the water, with only one sail visible above the surface. At the time, the "Litong" steamer, traveling between Yantai, Dalian, Tianjin, and Weihai, with a load capacity of over 1,000 tons, fully loaded with passengers and cargo, was advancing along the designated route. Because the submarine only had one sail showing on the surface, it was not noticed. Later, when the British warship saw a ship breaking through the waves, it surfaced immediately, but it was too late. A collision occurred. The British warship immediately sank. The number of people drowned and the handling of the aftermath are unknown.</p>
<p>Company News. The reporter also went to the Haichang Steamship Company to inquire. According to Mr. Zhang of the company, they received a telegram from the Yingkou "Yu Da" Steamship Company the day before yesterday, informing them that the "Yu Ji" had already departed, without mentioning the "Yu Da" incident. Based on news from various sources, it can be proven that it was definitely not the "Yu Da." It is likely that the "Yu Da" passed near the accident site and sent a telegram for help on behalf of someone else. The "Tunan" steamer received the telegram and, assuming it was from the "Yu Da," thought it was the "Yu Da" itself. If it were the "Yu Da," why wouldn't it provide rescue if it was not injured, and why would it leave for Yingkou immediately? Furthermore, if a ship collision occurred, if the ship was also damaged and unable to provide rescue, it should immediately sail to the nearby customs office to report the incident. Moreover, the "Yu Da's" route does not pass near Weihai. The full details of this matter will be clear after the "Yu Ji" arrives in Shanghai on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Seeks Commemoration Methods for Children's Day</h3>
<p>Opinions from the Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association received a letter from the Social Education Department of the National Government's Ministry of Education, delivered by Minister Jiang, regarding an instruction from the Executive Yuan concerning the establishment of April 4th as Children's Day. The Central Government has instructed the National Government to forward the matter to the Ministry of Education for the formulation of commemoration methods to be promulgated and implemented in elementary schools and kindergartens nationwide. The methods are to be formulated by the Ministry of Education. As this proposal was originally initiated by your association, reflecting a consistent enthusiasm for child welfare, you are requested to provide your opinions for consideration and submission. In the spirit of public cooperation, etc. The association has drafted an opinion on the commemoration methods for Children's Day and submitted it for adoption and implementation. The opinions are listed below for reference by those enthusiastic about child welfare: 1. Purpose: The purpose of holding commemorations on this day is to stimulate children's interest, make children aware of their position, and draw public attention to child welfare. 2. Methods: A. Group Activities: I. City and county officials should carry out the following activities: (1) Hold a Commemoration Meeting: Select a suitable location, convene representatives from various agencies and organizations within their jurisdiction, as well as students from primary and secondary schools and ordinary children, to hold a city-wide Children's Day commemoration meeting. (2) Parade: Organize a parade of children to attract special attention from society. (3) Promote children's health and literary and artistic competitions: Award prizes to the top contestants. (4) Give Children's Day souvenirs: In the past, when local officials first took office, they would convene all the students in the county to take an examination in classical Chinese, called "Guan Feng," and award several taels of silver to the top ten students, called "Assistant Scholarship." All those who failed the examination would receive two buns and a bowl of noodles. This is the old method. I believe that local officials should convene a public meeting on this day, deliver a speech on the relationship between children and the nation, make children aware of their position, and make adults aware that children are the future masters of the country, and pay attention to child welfare. Then, hold a children's health competition to promote hygiene, and a children's literary and artistic competition to encourage out-of-school students. Award valuable prizes with the inscription "Children's Day Commemoration" to the top ten, to mark the occasion. Every child attending the meeting should be given a souvenir (such as a fan, handkerchief, etc.). The cost is limited, but the effect is significant. (5) Open Government Offices for Children to Visit: The President of the United States has opened the White House three times for children to visit on Children's Day and given them candy and other items. If local officials in our country can promote this, it should attract special attention from society. (6) Promote Child Welfare Donations to Benefit Poor Children: In the United States, the second Sunday of December each year is designated as Poor Children's Happiness Day, and donations are held nationwide to help poor children. I believe that since this day is Children's Day, we should seek happiness for children, especially for poor children. Local officials should promote donations on this day to help local child welfare organizations, which would be fortunate for poor children. B. Group Activities: II. Schools should carry out the following activities: (1) Holiday for one day, fly flags to celebrate. (2) Gather in the auditorium to speak about seeking overall happiness for children and elaborating on the meaning of Children's Day. (3) Print and distribute colored pictures about children's education and hygiene, etc. (4) Give Children's Day souvenirs (such as stationery, utensils, etc.), "limited to students of the school." (5) Children's Parent-Teacher Conference at the school. (6) Children's Health Competition at the school (i.e., sports meet). (7) Children's Literary and Artistic Achievement Exhibition at the school. Each school should hold the above activities once a year, and hold them all on this day, which will not be a new trick, nor will it cost much, and can also help promote the Children's Day festival. III. Party departments at all levels, social education institutions, charitable, public welfare, and organizations should carry out the following activities: (1) Fly flags to celebrate. (2) Lecture on "The Responsibilities and Obligations of Mothers," "Protecting the Fetus," "Protecting Childbirth," and "Protecting Infants," as well as "Methods of Training Good Fathers and Mothers." (3) Guide or assist in the organization and activities of groups seeking happiness for children. (4) Give children souvenirs, etc. Children are the future masters of the Party and the country. The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen had the saying "Solve the fundamental education of children." Therefore, the Party department must provide practical guidance and imprint a good impression of the Party in the minds of children. Social education institutions should vigorously promote the above, and public welfare and charitable organizations should vigorously carry out the work below, striving to make the public pay attention to children's welfare and gradually reduce the number of out-of-school children to cultivate the foundation of the country. IV. Hospitals should carry out the following activities: (1) Provide free physical examinations for children to check for diseases, and provide prevention and treatment. (2) Provide free vaccinations against smallpox. (3) Print and distribute leaflets on children's health and common sense on "Protecting the Fetus," "Protecting Childbirth," and "Protecting Infants" to parents. In the United States last year, on May 1st, Children's Day was held, and health experts launched a campaign to eradicate diphtheria and provided free vaccinations against diphtheria, which had a significant effect. The mortality rate of children in our country is very high. According to the report of the Shanghai Pushenzhuang, Shanghai has to collect a hundred baby corpses every day, which is shocking. I believe that if hospitals hold the above activities on this day, it can enable mothers to have common sense in raising children and reduce the mortality rate of children. It is a crucial plan. V. Playgrounds and parks should carry out the following activities: (1) Perform dramas about children's lives. (2) Welcome children to visit for free. (3) Give Children's Day souvenirs. VI. Stores should carry out the following activities: (1) Display children's goods, all of which must be child-oriented. (2) Children's supplies or toys should be specially discounted. (3) All children who shop or buy children's supplies should be given Children's Day souvenirs. (4) Welcome children to visit. VII. Families should carry out the following activities on this day: (1) Parent-child gathering of relatives and friends: In the past, our country had the custom of "New Year's greetings" and "festival greetings," and gifts were given. Elders would give rewards to juniors. If we can hold festival greetings on this day, the items adults give to children, and older children give to younger children, will not cost much money and can enhance children's sense of group love. (2) Steam peach blossom cakes to decorate the festival: According to the customs of our country, every festival must have seasonal food, such as "Tangyuan" for the Lantern Festival, "Zongzi" for the Dragon Boat Festival, "Rice Wine" for the Beginning of Summer, "Moon Cakes" for the Mid-Autumn Festival, "Cakes" for the Double Ninth Festival, and "Congee" for the Laba Festival. It should be appropriate to choose food to feed children on this day. At this time, peach blossoms are in full bloom. In ancient times, "Shangsi used peach blossoms to wash children's faces to maintain their youth." We can imitate the story, using rice flour in the south and wheat flour in the north to make various models, either sweet or savory. The outer skin is steamed into cakes with several peach blossom petals, called peach blossom cakes, to feed children and give to relatives and friends. VI. Appropriate entertainment items should be provided, such as: (1) Flying kites, (2) Bang, (3) Kicking Jianzi, (4) Game songs: Our country must have entertainment items to decorate every festival, such as "playing lanterns" for the Lantern Festival, "dragon boats" for the Dragon Boat Festival, "begging for skills" for the Qixi Festival, "moon viewing" for the Mid-Autumn Festival, and "mountain climbing" for the Double Ninth Festival. Games are children's second life. A very appropriate entertainment item should be held on this day to celebrate the festival. However, this kind of entertainment item must contain the three elements of "hygiene," "national essence," and "low price." Hygiene can promote children's health, the national essence can enlighten children's patriotism, and the low price can reduce the burden on parents. The above three types of toys are appropriate. At this time, the spring breeze is warm, and it is the time to go out into the suburbs. If you fly a kite, you will look up at the sky and absorb fresh air, which is beneficial to hygiene. However, the climate is different in the north and south, and I am afraid that kites may not be popular, so I will add the two things of "hitting a stick" and "kicking Jianzi." One child can play, and a group of children can also play. The texture is both the national essence, and the price is very low. It can not only strengthen the body, but also be a group movement. It is very beneficial to train children to cooperate with others from an early age. Moreover, you can play in any street in David. Soliciting appropriate game songs can be one of the aids to popular education.</p>

<p>Result of a Concubine's Escape with Her Daughter</p>
<p>Wu A'wu Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Wu A'wu, a native of Mi, around 40 years old, lived with his concubine in a pavilion room at No. 10 Daxing Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession. Due to unemployment, his concubine, seeing that Wu was unable to support them, recently took their biological daughter and fled without a trace. Wu searched everywhere for them but found no news. Later, someone told him that she was working as a helper in a Lanhuayuan brothel. Wu went to look for her on the afternoon of the 12th but still found no trace. That night, after returning home, he was very unhappy and suddenly had a suicidal thought. He used his belt to hang himself. It was not until the next day (the 13th) that the second landlord, Luo Xuan Chen from Taizhou, noticed something was amiss and forced open the door to check. Wu was already dead. He immediately reported it to the police station, and detectives were dispatched to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall to examine the body. As there were no family members, the French police reported to the Public Trial Hall, and Judge Zhu Chengshen came to the scene. After examining the body and confirming that the deceased had indeed committed suicide by hanging, he ordered photographs to be taken and the hall provided a coffin for burial, awaiting family to claim the body.</p>
<p>Police Arrest Two Robbers</p>
<p>Clothing Workshop in Qinben Lane Robbed</p>
<p>Hu Yuqing and Zhang Xiao Erzi</p>
<p>Lu Meichang, a native of Baoshan County, 33 years old, runs a clothing workshop at No. 15 Qinben Lane, Nanjing Street, Nanshi. His business is quite prosperous, and his family has accumulated some savings, which attracted the attention of robbers. At around 6:00 AM yesterday, three robbers suddenly entered the workshop through the back door, three wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, one wearing white cloth short shirts and trousers, and one wearing a white short shirt and blue cloth trousers. Lu had already gotten up and was in the living room. One of the robbers immediately said to Lu, "We are from the defense corps. We need to make new summer uniforms for the corps, so we came here to ask how much the labor cost per uniform is." Lu was very happy that he had such a big customer early in the morning and talked to them, happily asking how many uniforms they needed to order. The three robbers smiled at each other. Two of them then took out pistols, warning him not to make any noise. Lu then realized that robbers had come and was immediately frightened. The robbers first closed the front and back doors of the workshop. One robber went upstairs and broke into Lu's bedroom, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, taking a gold bracelet, three gold rings, a pair of small silver bracelets, and nine yuan and three jiao in cash that Lu had hidden. They put them in their pockets. They also stole a thread spring camel wool robe, a sheepskin robe, and two small Mao Ge lined jackets. After the robbery, they went downstairs, opened the door with the two robbers downstairs, and walked out. Gan Jia, a fellow worker at the workshop, saw the robbers leaving and secretly followed them. When the robbers stepped out of the entrance of Qinben Lane, he shouted loudly, "Catch the robbers!" The shout was heard far and wide. Cui Guomin, a watchman from the 23rd police post in the area, heard the shout and came to investigate. The robbers, seeing that the police had arrived, were greatly alarmed. One of the robbers, wearing white short shirts and trousers, threw the four stolen clothes on the ground. He and another robber, wearing white short shirts and blue cloth trousers, ran away to the north. Another robber ran south towards the Shanghai Military Camp. Seeing this, Officer Cui immediately blew his whistle and chased the two robbers to the north. At the entrance of Yuanxing Lane, Nanmatou, Wang Bingyi, a watchman from the 24th police post, heard the whistle and rushed over, capturing the robber wearing white cloth short shirts and trousers. A fake pistol and the stolen gold and silver jewelry and cash were found on the robber. The other robber, wearing a white short shirt and blue cloth trousers, continued to flee north. Officer Cui continued to chase him bravely. At the intersection of Ping'an Street, Li Shijie, a watchman from the 20th police post, joined the chase. At Youchematou, the robber suddenly turned to the Bund to escape. Liu Xueqing, a watchman from the 18th police post, saw him and bravely rushed forward to hold the robber, seizing a Brownie pistol that the robber was holding. He checked the gun and found six bullets in the chamber. The two robbers were then taken to the first precinct, first sub-station. The station chief ordered a preliminary interrogation. The robber wearing a white short shirt and trousers said his name was Hu Yuqing, 30 years old, from Yangzhou. He usually weaves cloth. He said that Li Caifang, whom he knew, had the idea to rob the clothing workshop, and he went with Wang A'er and Zhang Xiao Erzi (referring to the robber wearing a white short shirt and blue cloth trousers). He also said that in March of this year, a friend named Gu Shoushan asked him to rob a Yang family at No. 7 Chaguan Lane, Cangqiao Street, Nanshi. On June 11, he, Wang, and Zhang met at the iron gate of Nanyang Bridge and then robbed the Huake sock factory at No. 150 Haichao Temple Street, outside Xiaonanmen. The stolen goods were divided and spent. Zhang Xiao Erzi, also known as Zhi Zhao, 29 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing in Dasheng Lane, Zhizaoju Road, Nanshi, working as a worker in the Xie Xing weaving factory, said that his statement was the same as Hu's. As the case involved robbery, the police were ordered to prepare a document and send it to the third section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Inexplicable Marital Dispute</p>
<p>Woman Accuses Man of Bigamy and Abandonment</p>
<p>Man Denies Marriage All Along</p>
<p>Ding Yueying, a woman from Nanjing, hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to represent her in the French court, criminally accusing Xu Yansen, the owner of the Central Apartment on Aiduya Road, of bigamy and abandonment. The plaintiff alleged that she was introduced to the defendant by a matchmaker surnamed Wang last year and married him. After moving in, she discovered that Xu Yansen already had a wife. At the time, the plaintiff thought it was a fait accompli, so she kept it a secret. Later, at the end of last year, the plaintiff returned to her mother's house for some reason. Unexpectedly, she received a letter from the defendant Xu Yansen, which stated that she (referring to the plaintiff) was too young to manage the household and was free to marry someone else. She now has two letters to prove this. Under these circumstances, the defendant has committed both the crimes of bigamy and abandonment and should be severely punished, and she requests compensation. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend himself, claiming that the plaintiff was sent to his residence by a woman surnamed Wang as a maid and was not married as a wife. He was falsely accused and requested that the case be dismissed. The plaintiff, Ding Yueying, stated that she came to Shanghai with the matchmaker in July last year and lived in the defendant's apartment. She married the defendant in the apartment on the sixth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar and there was a wedding feast to prove it. The defendant claimed that he never married the plaintiff and never wrote any letters. Judge Zhu Chengshen ruled that the testimonies of both parties were contradictory and would be investigated further.</p>

<p>Robbery at Pawnshop</p>
<p>Indian Constable Severely Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at around 9:50 PM, four robbers, all wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, suddenly came to the Chuangxing pawnshop at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Linqing Road. Three of the robbers, armed with pistols, went straight upstairs, while one robber acted as a lookout at the door. They robbed cash, silver, and jewelry and escaped with their loot. At this time, Indian constable No. 216 from the Yangshupu police station was patrolling the area and heard the news. He immediately chased after the robbers. When he reached the entrance of Dexing Lane, the robbers opened fire and resisted arrest, firing about seven or eight shots. The Indian constable was outnumbered and shot in the head, falling to the ground injured. The robbers took the opportunity to flee. The Indian constable was taken to the hospital for treatment. His injuries were very serious and his life was in danger.</p>

<p>Litigation Ends in Disaster by Qiu Shui</p>
<p>As the saying goes, litigation ends in disaster. Lawsuits are something that should be done only when absolutely necessary. They can not only damage the relationship between the parties involved, but the costs can sometimes exceed the value of the subject matter of the lawsuit by hundreds of times. The gains are not worth the losses. Where is the real benefit of litigation? Here are a few famous stories written below to advise those who are prone to litigation.</p>
<p>Expensive Testimony</p>
<p>A recent trial in the British High Court involving a million-pound check is legally the most important case in recent years. However, the costs are also staggering. One witness, a Portuguese bank employee, was deemed necessary to testify in court. A summons was issued. This person arrived in court and made a statement of 149 words, which took four minutes. However, the total cost, including round-trip travel expenses between England and Portugal, a month's hotel expenses, and miscellaneous expenses, averaged seven shillings per word spoken. Several years ago, there was the "Burling Siwei" case in England. An important witness in the case was the manager of a large Dutch company living in Java, in the South Seas, 12,000 miles from England. He was ordered to appear in court to make a statement. His testimony took 14 minutes, and the cost was 800 pounds. Appearing in court to testify is a citizen's obligation. Except in cases of illness, old age, or other special circumstances, everyone must appear in court when summoned, regardless of the cost. Fortunately, all necessary expenses are borne by one of the litigants, not by the witness themselves. These two expensive witnesses did not suffer any losses.</p>
<p>Eight Days of Debate</p>
<p>In large cases, the money spent on witnesses is only a small part of the total cost. For example, in the British Wei Luan v. Lu Wei case, we can see that spending money in court is like water flowing. The parties in this case hired three barristers, each with a public fee of 1,000 pounds and a daily appearance fee of 100 pounds. One of the lawyers, named Carlsen, debated eloquently for eight days when the case opened. An important witness also stayed in court for eleven days. The cost of shorthand recording the court's testimony was 3,000 pounds. Therefore, after the case was concluded, the total cost to both parties was 80,000 pounds, exceeding the value of the subject matter of the lawsuit by more than 17,000 pounds. Isn't that a waste? Once, a manufacturer sued an engineer, requesting damages of 3,535 pounds. The case lasted for 55 days. A total of 60 witnesses were called to court. The number of questions answered was 26,252. The total cost of the case was 19,900 pounds, which is also rare.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Huge Case</p>
<p>Even worse, in a certain year, a British coal and iron company sued the Lincoln Company for breach of contract, requesting damages of 15,000 pounds. After eight days, both parties, realizing the enormous cost, calculated that it would cost three pounds and ten shillings per minute. They came to a sudden realization and quickly withdrew from court to settle the matter. Once, the British National Telephone Company sued the Post Office. When the trial began, the documents submitted to the court weighed three tons. Mr. Frank Cheer, an engineer at the telephone company, was a witness in the case, answering 2,500 questions and staying in court for eleven days. The cost of various printed materials and shorthand was 3,000 pounds. After 71 days, the case was concluded, and the cost had reached 359,500 pounds, averaging about 600 pounds per hour. Fortunately, this litigation cost was paid by the national treasury. Otherwise, who would have the financial resources to bear it?</p>
<p>Begging on the Sea by Qi Lu</p>
<p>Shanghai is a prosperous business area. Most beggars also come for business, not disabled people who are forced to beg. Able-bodied young people can become kidnappers or butchers. Those who specialize in begging use young children and old women as partners. Young children, what Shanghai people call "little rascals," collect scraps, pick pockets, pull rickshaws across bridges, and spill food, as their daily routine of serving society. They get up early and dream late, which is very pleasant. However, these little beggars are quite intelligent. They are also mental laborers rather than physical laborers. One morning, I happened to be walking on Minguo Road when I saw a woman carrying a basket filled with fish and meat, walking slowly. A child of eight or nine years old suddenly stretched out a small hand and threw the fish and meat from the basket behind him. Immediately, a slightly older child picked it up and threw it to an even older child behind him. In a blink of an eye, the fish and meat in the woman's basket had disappeared without a trace three to five zhang away. The woman did not know what happened. The three or five little beggars jumped away. I watched from afar and sighed, "If these children were given a good education, wouldn't they all be on the list of inferior students and unable to be trained?" I once took a ship back home and often saw young people with haggard faces patrolling the ship, craning their necks and looking around, as if looking for their best friends. At first, I was very suspicious. Later, I saw that these haggard young people often talked with the passengers in the first-class and second-class cabins and often called the passengers "brother" or "uncle," begging for three or five jiao in silver coins and leaving in a panic. After they left, the passengers sighed, "This is the son of my friend so-and-so. This is the nephew of my family member so-and-so. When their father was alive, they owned hundreds of thousands of assets. They were so-called young masters and sons of wealthy families. Now they have degenerated to such a state. It's really sad." Today, there are many such people on the Shanghai-Ningbo ships. Tracing their history, they were not all rich. They only squandered their wealth in prostitution, gambling, and opium in the past and became people in the lowest social class. They thought that there must be many wealthy social acquaintances on the ship, so they invented a way to beg, earning one or two yuan a day, which was not difficult at first. They spent their remaining years as former nobles in the smoky haze by the Huangpu River. However, these people could reform themselves. It is not difficult to become self-reliant. It is only because they are naturally lazy and addicted to comfort that they cannot be saved. Zhuangzi said, "I take heaven and earth as my coffin and the sun and moon as my jade ornaments." Are these people embracing Zhuangzi's view of life? I don't dare to know. Alas.</p>
<p>The Honor of the Sino-Japanese Painting Exhibition by Hai Shi</p>
<p>I have been a guest in Shanghai for several years and have long heard the name of Layman Hongwei, but I have not had the opportunity to meet him. I once read his paintings at a friend's house and knew that his works had value and should be appreciated by people at home and abroad. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Empress Dowager of Japan's Showa Emperor specially appreciated Hongwei's paintings, selected and purchased them, which is truly rare and valuable. I heard that the subject of Hongwei's painting is "Willow Bank Chanting Cicadas." I can imagine the lofty artistic conception and the unrestrained charm. It must be completely free of vulgarity and otherworldly. The Japanese imperial family has always held itself in high esteem. This time, at the Sino-Japanese Ancient and Modern Painting Exhibition, the Empress Dowager visited the exhibition, deigning to view our country's paintings and purchasing the works of painters from the North and South. She also read all the encomiums, which was unprecedented for a painting exhibition. She paid special attention to Hongwei's painting among the four scrolls. She stared at it intently for several hours, which shows that the Empress Dowager's heart was in agreement and her eyes were focused, surpassing the ordinary. A most noble person purchasing a most valuable painting is like giving a sword to a hero and gold to a beauty. The opinions of China and foreign countries are roughly the same. Isn't that true? Our country's inherent literature and art have come to a standstill today. Fortunately, there are famous painters in Shanghai who can still promote the essence of our country and express the spirit of the nation, competing with the world in the art of writing and winning. Isn't the legacy of art relying on this to avoid decline? Moreover, Layman Hongwei is a famous figure among women and can be favored by the imperial family of that country. The dissemination of her reputation is not only valuable in Korea. I only hope that our country's authorities also know that art is precious. They talk about promoting culture every day, but I have not heard of anyone visiting a painting exhibition. Compared with the imperial family of that country, can they not be inferior? I sincerely hope that our country's authorities will also value art as much as the Japanese government, promoting and revitalizing it, rewarding and encouraging it, so that people in general will pay attention to art and make our nation enjoy unparalleled glory. This is truly the good fortune of our country's artistic future and not only the glory of a painting exhibition.</p>
<p>Preface to the Three Dynasties of Qin and Han Jade Seal Album by Fang Jiekang (Unpaid)</p>
<p>Ancient seals were used to demonstrate trust. During the Zhou Dynasty, characters competed for novelty, and gold and jade were mixed in accessories. When the Qin Dynasty unified the world, regulations were established. Jade was used by the ruling class, and copper was used by all officials. Although private seals also used jade, only famous officials and dignitaries were allowed to wear them. However, since the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, the writing system has changed with each generation. Unfortunately, there are no special books detailing the reasons for the evolution. The years are long and the research is difficult. During the Chen and Sui Dynasties of the Six Dynasties, the systems were mixed, and the characters were divergent and erroneous. Even the ancient methods of seal script were lost. The Song Dynasty's collection of seal history was only in its infancy. The books were all woodcut, and the strange ancient characters were indistinguishable. As a result, the remaining rules were increasingly abandoned. In the Ming Dynasty, Chen Zi and Pan Yuanchang and others tried to save the shortcomings of woodcut and replaced them with stone. However, they only got the appearance. In ancient times, the craft of seals was the embodiment of the spirit of the characters of that era. The strange, magnificent, and heroic spirit could not be imitated by stubborn stones. I have studied the "Xuanhe Seal History," "Jigu Fuben," "Yin Sou," "Yin Tong," "Yin Ji," and "Yin Fan," "Yin Cun" and other books. Among them, there are hundreds of jade seals. The objects are scattered, like phoenixes and unicorns, and cannot be recovered. I have always been fond of research. Whenever I see something, I must distinguish it, select it, and caress it until the shape and spirit are exactly the same. Now I have preserved more than 300 of the best seals, divided into twelve categories. For example, "Zuo Gongche Palace" and "You Situ" are all Zhou Dynasty official systems. "Ba Changjun" and "Xiongnu Xiangbang" are all objects from before the Qin Dynasty, which can supplement the omissions in the table of officials in historical biographies. The nine-character auspicious words and "Shoucheng" and other seals are all objects from the Han Dynasty. Other characters are divergent and close to oracle bone script. Bell. Ding. Stone. Drum. Pottery. Coin. Tile. Dang. Stele. Tablet. There are many inscriptions. Some are not found in Shuowen, and some are slightly different from Shuowen, such as . Gai. . Zheng. . Jiao. Can increase the loss of Xu's book of surnames. Sitting is written as, production is written as, skin is written as, and trade is written as, which can prove the errors in the transmission of the Xuewen Daxuben. These seal inscriptions are all unseen in other books, which is especially rare and valuable. Moreover, the structure of bird and insect scripts is originally from the great seal. It must have existed before the Qin Dynasty. Some say that it began in the Han Dynasty and that Shuzhuan is Miaozhuan, which is a misjudgment. In addition, more than 100 seals such as Gu Congde's collection of "Huan Wu," "Chang Xin," "Sun Kun," Shen Tu Lang, and "Chun Yu Pu Su" were all famous at the time and the most accurate. Unfortunately, they were destroyed by fire during the Longqing period, and most of the Yuan Dynasty seals were reduced to ashes. This is the only treasure of the early Tuo Shanben. Sigh. Seal people's studies are unique to China. The beginning is far away. The end is lost. Respect the beauty of a family's arts and literature. The four years of tidying up have turned into this book. The private heart is happy to leave it as a sound. Jade is strong and the text is full of brilliance. In addition to gold and stone, there is a wonderful creation. Moreover, there are many more contributors to the revision of geography, history, writing, and engraving. Is it just a trust for a while?</p>
<p>The Three Eras of the Rotary Club, Part 6, by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao San picked up a match (also called a fire-fetcher) and drew randomly on the ground. Then he threw the match at her and laughed, "Alright. Let's make peace. How about it? The steamed cornbread must be ready to eat." Zhang Er Sao saw that her husband had completely softened, so she became even more emboldened. She snorted and said, "Cornbread? That's for me to eat alone." Zhang Xiao San said, "If you really don't give me any, don't expect to eat mine in the future." Zhang Er Sao used her clothing lapel as a fan, fanning herself even harder. She sneered and said, "You won't let me eat yours? Is that supposed to scare me? If I can't find an official, can't I find a rickshaw puller? I won't give you a single bite. What are you going to do about it?" Zhang Xiao San suddenly stood up and said, "You have to give me some. You little bitch..." Before he could finish speaking, he grabbed Zhang Er Sao's sleeve and pulled her to the side, intending to pull her away so he could grab the cornbread pot. Zhang San Sao was not afraid at all. She stretched out her arms and blocked the way, glaring at him. "You bastard. You dare to steal mine?" Zhang Xiao San couldn't reach it, so he stretched out a palm and slapped her face. This slap was like turning on the switch of a talking machine. She immediately started wailing, "Good son. You hit me. I don't want to live anymore." She grabbed Zhang Xiao San's belt, lowered her head, and charged into his stomach. Zhang Xiao San dodged slightly, and she ended up falling face-down on the ground. She didn't get up. She just rolled around on the ground, crying and shouting, "I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to live. Help, help." This shout brought all the neighbors in the courtyard running. Everyone already knew it was just about a few cornbreads. Some tried to persuade them, some tried to pull them apart. Zhang Xiao San was pulled away. He still had 150 coppers on him, so he didn't really need to eat a few cornbreads. He went to the bathhouse to take a bath. He ate a catty of white noodles with meat at the small restaurant. He came back in high spirits in the evening. He saw that his door was closed and it was dark inside. He pushed the door open and lit the lamp. He saw some broken things thrown on the bed. A broken wooden box lay on the ground. The small bedding roll and all the good things were gone. His wife, like those things, was nowhere to be found. Only the source of the trouble, that basket of cornbreads, and the steamer rack were all on the table. Zhang Xiao San said, "Good for her. She ran away. What she always said about not following a rickshaw puller was the truth." With that shout, the neighbors came again. Everyone was in a state of confusion for a while. They searched everywhere for a while, but there was no trace of her. Someone advised Zhang Xiao San to report the case to the police station. Zhang Xiao San said, "The police are always against the rickshaw pullers. I can't find much reason there. He will say why I didn't support my wife with the money I earned. Maybe that wench will even come up with a reason. It's my own fault for being useless and being a rubber tire troop. It's my own fault that my wife ran away. I won't look for her." So these few cornbreads sacrificed his wife. From that day on, he became a widower.</p>

<h3>The Inside Story of "Spirit Possession" of Cheng Xun</h3>
<p>Deceiving Figures from All Sectors</p>
<p>To Achieve Monetary Gains</p>
<p>Lu Nongshi sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating that since the "Shibao" published the lengthy social news report "Strange Encounters in Jiangwan," everyone near and far in Shanghai knows about Cheng Xun. It is said that a spirit possesses his body, and his calligraphy and paintings make it seem as if spirits and ghosts truly exist in Shanghai, a hub of science and civilization. According to the propaganda from his Siyin Altar, it is even more bizarre and extravagant, claiming that not only are prominent figures in the city actively promoting him, but even people within the party and government have converted to his altar. This kind of propaganda is certainly not credible, as eliminating superstition is a key part of our party's platform, and current important figures in the party and government would never promote superstition and violate party discipline. However, reports about the Municipal Party Department's resolutions and the Public Security Bureau's crackdown have yet to be implemented. Driven by curiosity, I spent half a month personally visiting Jiangwan four times to investigate everything, and the truth is now clear. To expose the inside story, I must first report on the following:</p>
<p>Cheng Xun's Background: Cheng Xun has lived in Jiangwan for generations. In his youth, he studied under Lu Ren-sheng's father, the old scholar Lu Bao-yu. He was quite intelligent but, due to poverty, did not finish studying the Five Classics. In his spare time from business, he would often consult his teacher on classical texts, as they were neighbors. Years ago, he suffered a serious illness. Following local customs, he prayed to the Liu Brothers deities of the Eastern Peak Temple. After recovering, he became a devout believer. In the past, Cheng Xun would always be the leader of the annual festival held on the 28th day of the third month. Over time, Cheng Xun became thoroughly familiar with the methods used by the Taoist priests of the Eastern Peak Temple to collect money in the name of the gods. He couldn't help but go from admiration to envy. In a certain year, he took advantage of the festival to move the statues of the Three Liu Brothers to the Cowherd Temple in Xizhen, using this as a form of blackmail. The Taoist priests were greatly alarmed and secretly negotiated terms to move them back to their original location. At this point, Cheng Xun had truly stepped out of the realm of superstition and into the path of exploiting superstition. Later, as the welcoming of deities and religious festivals were banned by the authorities, the festival on the 28th day of the third month could no longer be held. The Taoist priests gradually went back on their previously agreed terms. Cheng Xun was greatly angered and wanted to move the statues out again, but he had no opportunity. He then hired a photographer to take three photos of the wooden statues, which he moved to his home. He declared that the Three Liu Brothers had revealed in a dream that the Taoist priests were untrustworthy and that they no longer wished to stay at the Eastern Peak Temple, but instead wished to reside in Cheng's home. The local villagers, believing Cheng to be the leader of the festival and the adopted son of Liu Zhongxian Wang (King), were quite convinced. However, it was practically difficult for devout believers to worship great deities through small photographs. Last year, a father and son surnamed Xue, who were skilled in painting, wandered into Jiangwan. Cheng hired them as teachers (the son is currently serving a twelve-year sentence for the Jin An Yang case). He diligently studied painting and enlarged the photos, painting three colored portraits of the deities and mounting them for display to attract followers. He also hired Lu Ren-sheng's son, Lu Shou-yi (a registered medical practitioner with the Health Bureau), to prescribe medicine in the name of the deities. People paid two dimes for incense and candles. Lu Ren-sheng believed that this approach was still rooted in witchcraft and that the income was limited, which was not worthwhile. He discussed with his friend Diao Hao-chun a good way to make money without harming their reputations, and they asked Cheng Xun to cooperate. Thus, the desire for money greatly increased. Suddenly, on the 16th day of the first month of the lunar calendar, they spread the rumor that a spirit possessed Cheng's body. Lu Ren-sheng used the position of the Propaganda Office of the District Party Department (which was located in Lu's home, right across from Cheng's house) to vigorously promote the deity's miracles. Diao Hao-chun contacted people in society and reached out to the party and government authorities, inviting them to visit. Their</p>
<p>Methods of Numbing Society: First, they promoted Cheng Xun as being not very literate to show how he was inspired. In reality, Cheng had searched for books recording the history of the Liu Brothers last year and compiled them into "The Biography of Zhongxian," and he personally wrote a preface that was quite readable. This fact has been verified by an advertisement posted by Cheng Xun himself. Second, they pre-prepared couplets with the names of the invited guests embedded in the verses, written by Lu Ren-sheng. During the visit, Cheng would write them in public to strengthen their belief. Later, the number of visitors requesting couplets increased daily. When unexpected figures visited and there was no couplet prepared, or when they strongly demanded one, Cheng would write one himself. This is why poorly written couplets were often found. Liu was a scholar in the Song Dynasty, so the question is whether this calligraphy was in the style of the Song Dynasty, and whether a great scholar would write poor couplets, which is not worth a knowledgeable person's smile. As for their</p>
<p>Methods of Collecting Money: Besides borrowing the promotion of prominent figures to increase the value of their so-called "calligraphy treasures," they also selected wealthy families to send couplets and paintings to, and then asked them for donations under the pretext of repairing the temple. Wealthy people in Shanghai, in their short-sightedness, saw that the couplets sent by Liu Zhongxian Wang were stamped with a red seal and addressed them as "brother," feeling flattered and surprised. It could also ward off evil spirits and protect the home, catering to the preferences of superstitious people. Furthermore, they exaggerated the notion that important figures in the party and state had sent special envoys to respectfully request calligraphy treasures, naturally making them happy to open their wallets. It is said that their income has been no less than fifty or sixty thousand gold yuan. They have now allocated a small portion of it to repair the Eastern Peak Temple to strengthen the faith of those who have donated, and they are telling those who have not yet donated that the temple's expenses were advanced by someone and are requesting donations to repay them. Lu Ren-sheng also summoned more than twenty leaders of various guilds and assigned each person to donate five hundred yuan for the temple repair. Fortunately, this kind of fundraising has no verifiable records, making it easy to profit from it. Shanghai is a central area of civilization, with numerous government offices and strict laws. How can this kind of ghostly behavior be openly active in broad daylight without being cracked down on? It serves as a strong counter-evidence to the Siyin Altar and increases the belief of superstitious people that spirits and ghosts truly exist. In reality, the altar does have</p>
<p>Tactics to Restrain Government Offices: How do they do it? The first step is to widely invite people to visit and request signatures. After the altar was planned and organized by Lu and Diao, they widely invited prominent figures to visit. Most of these so-called social celebrities, driven even more by curiosity and the encouragement of others, would occasionally take the time to visit to see what it was all about. Upon entering, they were immediately asked to sign their names. Signing in upon entering is a common practice for various social organizations. These celebrities run between groups every day and signing is part of their daily work, so they don't mind. Little did they know that the altar had a great use for them: they used the signatures as evidence of support for the altar. Once they flipped through the signature book, it was seen that leading officials from the city's party, government, military, and police agencies were all listed. The extent of the forgery is imaginable. This signature book is actually a talisman for the altar, which can make lower-level civil servants who are executing government orders freeze upon seeing it. For example, when the Social Bureau recently sent someone to investigate the altar, Cheng Xun immediately presented the signature book, saying, "Your director often comes here, why are you investigating?" Responsible persons in various agencies, seeing the bold nonsense and unsure whether the signatories had actually visited the altar, felt uneasy about taking decisive action. The altar also told Party A that Party B was very supportive of the altar, and told Party B how Party A believed, eventually misleading all parties. The altar then proclaimed to the public that there were no problems from any side and that they could proceed boldly. Knowing that their income was too large and would be difficult to resolve if thoroughly investigated, the altar gradually borrowed the names of famous philanthropists to initiate donations. They bore the name, and the altar reaped the rewards. Philanthropists, with charitable hearts, have always supported various charities and would naturally be happy to be listed and used by them. This</p>
<p>Novel Way of Soliciting Donations: Its thoroughness has broken the highest record of various donation-soliciting schemes in Shanghai and has become a spectacular feat of deception. Without the planning of the former Qing scholar Lu Ren-sheng and the Republican notable Diao Hao-chun, how could it have reached this level? If the inside story is not exposed, not only will it be allowed to poison society and bring shame to our party, but it will also mislead the ignorant into believing that important figures in the party and government and social celebrities are actually promoting superstition and participating in deceptive scams, which would damage the government's credibility and the reputations of prominent figures. Therefore, I respectfully reveal the inside story to inform society.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Women's Prison in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Interior is Well-Equipped and Organized</p>
<p>Hygiene is Particularly Emphasized</p>
<p>After China recovered jurisdiction over the Public Concession, most of the prison administration affairs remained in the hands of foreigners. However, the women's prison is entirely under the direct jurisdiction of the Second Branch Prison of Jiangsu Province. The women's prison is located next to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Special District Local Court. It was reorganized from the former women's detention center of the Joint Court era. Although the prison building has four floors, it is not very spacious. In the past, there were not many female prisoners, so it was not crowded. Now, all convicted and unconvicted female prisoners from the high and low courts are detained in this prison, resulting in a crowded situation. In the past, each cell was limited to seven prisoners, but it has now increased to ten. In total, there are more than 220 female prisoners in the prison. Fortunately, the current warden, Xie Fuzi, is quite experienced in prison administration. The interior equipment is still considered complete, so even though the number of criminals has increased frequently, their placement is well-organized. Past陋習 (陋習 means bad customs or habits, but here it could also refer to general issues) have been completely eliminated, and prisoners are assigned to vocational work, with strict restraints imposed. As it stands, it is definitely better than before. Recently, with the arrival of summer, Warden Xie emphasized hygiene and issued a notice prohibiting prisoners' families from bringing unclean food during visits. Therefore, inspections have been extremely strict in recent days for those visiting the prison with food in order to prevent the spread of epidemics. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper, having heard of the various improved facilities in the prison, made a special visit and obtained permission from the authorities. Translator Ni Guangzu was assigned to guide the reporter. Entering through the main gate of the prison, there is a large open space used by prisoners for their daily exercise. On the side of the courtyard, there is a room divided into three by iron fences, which is where family members meet with prisoners to talk. During the conversation, each person stands in one corner, and the small space in the middle is where the supervisor assigned by the warden stands to oversee the conversation between the prisoner and the visitor, preventing the prisoner and visitor from engaging in irregular dialogue. The remaining space is entirely used as a detention center for unconvicted prisoners. Each entrance to the separated rooms is also fenced with iron bars. The two-story building houses both the detention and imprisonment areas. Those serving detention sentences are mostly prostitutes who solicit customers along the streets. The infirmary is also located there. Prisoners with minor illnesses who do not need to be sent to the hospital are moved to this infirmary for rest, relieving them of the labor of operating. The infirmary facilities are better than the prison cells, with bedding and other bedding. The third and fourth floors are where prisoners serving prison sentences reside. These prisoners sew clothes, wash clothes, or weave seasonal straw hats, working in groups, each diligently performing their duties. It is said that among these two hundred or so people, a certain female prisoner on the lowest level is the most diligent in her work and extremely law-abiding, with good prospects for parole. Zhang Wenqing, the daughter of the county magistrate who murdered her stepmother a few years ago, is confined to the top floor, as she has been sentenced to life imprisonment. It is said that the prison's customary practice is that the longer the sentence, the higher the location. The prisons in the concession have never been open to the public, so their contents are not known to the outside world. If we can recover all prison rights in the future, the situation of the Tilanqiao Men's Prison will also not be difficult to disclose.</p>
<h3>The Trial Date for the Snow Butterfly Case</h3>
<p>July 3rd at 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Movie star Hu Die (Butterfly Hu) and her fiancé Lin Xuehuai are involved in a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court because of the termination of their engagement. There have been two court summonses, and each time the courtroom has been packed. Since Judge Zhou deemed it necessary to investigate the evidence further and postponed the hearing, more than three months have passed without any news of a continued hearing. Those concerned about the case are eagerly awaiting the results. It is now heard that the reason for the delay is that it has been difficult to collect the check stubs presented by Hu Die, which has delayed the process. Now that the investigation procedures have been completed, the trial judge, Zhou Daren, has issued summonses to both parties and their respective lawyers, Zhan Jifeng, E Sen, Ni Zheng, and Yang, to appear in court at 9:00 AM on July 3rd to await the hearing. Zhou Jianyun, the manager of the Star Film Company, has also received a summons and may appear in court to testify at that time. The lawyers on both sides are now preparing everything to be ready for the battle.</p>
<h3>A Man Jumps from a Vehicle in an Attempted Suicide</h3>
<p>His Life is in Grave Danger</p>
<p>His Suicide Note Expresses Utter Pessimism</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:10 PM, a train on the Songhu Railway, the 140th train heading from Shanghai, was near the Jiangwan Outer Yangqi area when a male passenger in the third-class carriage suddenly stood up and jumped out of the train door, falling onto the side of the tracks. As the train had not yet reached the station and was still traveling at a high speed, he suffered head and body injuries and lost consciousness. The train immediately stopped. A doctor from the Jiangwan International Sports Association arrived and tried to rescue the passenger, injecting him with a cardiotonic before loading him onto an inbound train from Song to Shanghai. He was then taken by ambulance to Renji Hospital on Bazhi Road for treatment. It was found that the passenger was about thirty years old and wearing a nose-colored long gown, a foreign-made silk short shirt and trousers, silk socks, and 嘰鞋 (unclear). He suffered severe external head and arm injuries, and his internal injuries were very serious. When he was sent to the hospital, he was barely breathing, and his life was in danger. When the passenger boarded the train, he had purchased a newspaper and several pieces of cake. Someone saw him eating and reading on the train, looking very content. No one would have expected that in a split second, he would try to jump from the train and commit suicide. The patrol police who maintained the road searched his body and found seven silver corner notes, eleven copper coins, a third-class train ticket from Shanghai to Song, and a suicide note written on stationery from the Dachanglong firm in Chunjiang Lane, Er Yangjing Bridge, Shanghai (telephone number 14225). The note was titled "Jingyang's Last Will" and read, "The sky has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have misfortunes that come overnight. Young people who are in modern times are poisoned by the dirty environment, and those who are not strong-willed cannot maintain themselves. Jing was born unlucky, losing his parents at a young age and losing his education in childhood. He relied on self-cherishing and self-improvement in his youth to gain a slight understanding of literature, and he has been greatly stimulated several times. He had no intention of being in the world early on. During this time, he was advised by relatives and friends and encouraged by peers to rejoin the world, but he did not expect that in early spring, due to excessive drinking, his old illness recurred. He sought treatment in every possible way, but all efforts were in vain. To this day, it has become more and more serious, and he cannot operate. He is worried about losing his job in the future and sees himself walking into death. All that is before him is gray, and life is boring, so he takes this last resort to end my life. There is absolutely no coercion or compulsion in the process. I have no wishes after my death and there must be no soliciting from others. This is my will." It was signed "June 14th, 20th year, Jingyang's last words."</p>
<h3>Tu Dongchen is Accused of Breach of Trust, Fraud, and Theft</h3>
<p>Illegally Selling Stocks of a Widow and Orphans</p>
<p>Improperly Transferred to Others</p>
<p>Tu Dongchen, a shareholder of the Dazhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road, was formerly a close friend of a man surnamed Su. When Su was ill and needed money, he asked Tu to his bedside, entrusting his young children and wife to him. Tu accepted the last words and was able to wholeheartedly protect them. When the joint venture to open the Dazhonghua Hotel was launched, Tu, knowing that Su's wife, Zheng, owned an inheritance, persuaded her to subscribe for shares. Zheng withdrew her savings and sold her jewelry, obtaining a total of four thousand taels, all of which she used to purchase shares in the hotel in the name of her son, Zhenjiang, hence the use of the Zhenji name. At each shareholders' meeting, she entrusted Tu to represent her. Last year, Tu was in financial straits and asked Zheng for a loan. Zheng had no surplus funds but did not want to refuse, so she gave him four shares of Dazhonghua Hotel stock worth four thousand taels for one year. Because Tu was a close friend of her deceased husband, unlike ordinary people, she did not write a loan certificate at the time. Recently, Zheng learned that Tu had secretly transferred two of the shares, numbered 40 and 42, worth two thousand taels, to Zhang Dongcen. She demanded the return of the shares from Tu, who completely denied the fact that he had borrowed the shares, risking the wrongdoing of deceiving a widow and orphans. Zheng hired lawyer E Sen to sue Tu Dongchen for breach of trust, fraud, theft, etc., in the Special District Local Court, requesting an investigation. However, the defendant has been living in seclusion at No. 1 Yaojia Lane in Nanjing City since the incident, and the court has no way to deliver the summons. It can only mail the summons to Nanjing, ordering him to report to the authorities as soon as possible. Tu still did not appear in court in person, only submitting a written defense to the court stating that Zheng was his concubine and had lived with him at No. 63 Hehe Lane, Pushi Road, French Concession, for six years. They broke off their relationship in February of this year, and he also stated that he was also known as Tu Zhenbang. The Zhenji stock of the Dazhonghua Hotel belonged to him and Zheng had nothing to do with it. He is currently residing in Nanjing, and according to the law, if Zheng has any claims against him, she should sue in the local court. Therefore, the jurisdiction of this case is incorrect and the original complaint should be dismissed. After investigation by the court, it was determined that the defendant's crime occurred in the Public Concession. His defense was merely an embellishment, so his request to dismiss the case due to incorrect jurisdiction was rejected. The case was heard in court by Judge Xiao the day before yesterday afternoon. Lawyer E, representing the plaintiff, stated that all the points made by the defendant were purely fictitious. Not only was the fraud and taking of property a clear fact, but the intentional slander of the plaintiff's reputation was particularly malicious. It was discovered that the defendant originally lived in Nanjing. When the National Army established Jiangnan, he was reported as a local tyrant and gentry and fled to Shanghai to escape punishment, changing his name to Yuncheng. The defendant's usual behavior can already be seen. Now he also claims to be named Zhenbang, which must be a temporary fabrication, using the excuse to swallow the stock. However, the plaintiff has a lot of evidence, all of which can prove that the defendant fabricated his name to embezzle property. He then presented various cover evidence. After Judge Xiao reviewed it, he ordered that the case be adjourned and the defendant be summoned to court for questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Do Not Lean Out of the Window While Riding a Public Bus</h3>
<p>The Case of Cai Xu is a Warning</p>
<p>Cai Xu, a woman from Pudong, thirty-three years old, was working as a female worker in the Hongzhang Cotton Mill. Yesterday, around 7:30 PM, she took the Hua Shang Public Bus No. 4111 from Shanghai to Jiangwan. On the way, Xu leaned out of the bus window to watch the scenery. As the bus was traveling near the Qujia Bridge area on Jiangwan Road, Public Bus No. 651 came head-on. The two buses grazed each other, and Xu was unable to avoid it. Her head and arms were severely injured and she was sent to the hospital by police car for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Dredging Bureau's Plan to Dredge and Fill the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The Location is in Front of the Bund Park</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Dredging Bureau is planning to dredge the Huangpu River in front of the Bund Park to facilitate the turning of large ships. Currently, large ships from the Pacific Ocean often sail into the Huangpu River and turn around in that area. However, the area of the river with a depth of more than 30 feet is only 600 feet wide. The riverbed on the Pudong side is shallower, making it easy for large ships over 500 feet in length to run aground when turning. Also, the riverbed near the park has a deep pool caused by scouring, with the deepest point being more than 100 feet. Therefore, the Dredging Bureau is planning to dredge the shallow areas on the Pudong side, widening the area of the river with a depth of more than 30 feet by 100 feet, from 600 feet to 700 feet. At the same time, they will use large rocks to fill the deep pool, reducing its scouring force and preventing the riverbed on the Pudong side from easily siltating. However, filling the deep pool requires a lot of stone. Due to limited financial resources, they only plan to fill the deepest part by about 10 feet.</p>
<h3>Pirates Rob and Kill on a Ningbo Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>Two Killed, One Kidnapped</p>
<p>Cloth Plundered, 3,000 Yuan Demanded</p>
<p>Sun Jinyuan, the owner of the Ningbo fishing boat, recently hired by Luyu Ji merchants to load 300 pieces of cloth in Haimen to be delivered to Dalian, set sail on the 10th of this month. As they were sailing near Donggang, they encountered a hurricane. The boat owner, Zhu, instructed the helmsman to dock in the port to take shelter from the wind. That night, three pirate ships suddenly approached. Thirty to forty pirates, armed with guns, swarmed onto the boat. Most of the people on Sun's boat were sleeping. Only three or four crew members were guarding the ship. Seeing the pirates boarding, they shouted for help, but were shot and killed by the pirates. The pirates went to each cabin to search and loot, only finding more than 300 yuan in the boat owner Zhu's sleeping area. Still not satisfied, they beat Zhu, who said he really had no silver. If they didn't believe him, they could read the ship's account book. The pirates took several account books and letters and threw them into the sea. They then opened the cabin and, seeing the cloth, forced the crew to carry the cloth from the cabin to the pirate ships. All the cloth in the middle cabin was plundered. One of the helmsmen refused to carry cloth and was kidnapped by the pirates. Before leaving, they ordered the boat owner to prepare 3,000 yuan to redeem him. The pirate ships sailed towards the East Sea. Because the helmsman was kidnapped, Sun's boat could not be steered and was towed to the mouth of Haimen, where it was anchored. They reported to the businesses there. Yesterday, the boat owner Zhu took a boat to Shanghai and reported to Luyu Ji, who immediately asked the offshore naval police to conduct a strict crackdown. The two crew members who were shot and killed were placed in coffins by the boat and buried. The boat owner informed the families and went to Haimen to transport them back for burial. It is said that the value of the plundered cloth was very high.</p>
