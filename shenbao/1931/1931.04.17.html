<p>西班牙宣布共和而後首受影響之葡萄牙亦頗有一論之價値夫葡萄牙固早於一九一○年驅逐國王曼納愛爾第二之後即已改組共和政府又於一九一七年宣布共和國之憲法者也然國號雖稱共和而實際情形則與西班牙相同民族性旣相同政黨之複雑亦相同以故連年革命紛擾不息其後執政者見政局之無法平定起而倣效意大利之獨裁政治亦與西班牙相同自施行獨裁而後内亂益甚革命風潮益形急劇一九二六年一年中竟至發生三次革命情形亦與西班牙施行獨裁後相同至於最近内亂依然不息今之所謂瑪第拉叛黨聞西班牙之宣布共和而有再接再厲之槪陸軍總監已以無法指揮而辭職可見葡萄牙之亂事形勢亦已嚴重惟是西班牙之革命目的在爭共和而葡萄牙則共和已久其所籍以號召之唯一旗幟祇有推翻獨裁政治然考其國内情形所以醖釀内亂眞因並不在此實以葡之敎育不普及人民程度太低不知政治爲何物故易爲政客與軍閥所利用蓋一國之治亂與人民之程度大有關係無知識之人民多則君主亂共和亦亂獨裁亂不獨裁亦亂葡國之情形如此吾人因有感於今日之西班牙甫得共和人民固歡欣若狂然其後之能否内亂不作政局即可安寗則又未敢預料矣</p>

<h3>昨日江灣道上足球賽輔仁敗於復旦</h3>
<p>結果一對二</p>
<p>全隊十八晨離滬返平</p>
<p>北平輔仁大學足球隊昨日往江濤與復旦大學交鋒上半時旗鼓相當工力適敵一對一下半時風姨光臨興作怪於是主隊勢壯客軍受創結果一對二輔仁失敗誠所謂非戰之罪天亡我也裁判員吳炎章</p>
<h3>别矣輔仁珍重前途</h3>
<p>輔仁之來原在觀摩切磋勝敗二字置之度外勝固可喜敗亦猶榮在滬四戰三負一和惟以吾人觀之北平足球程度遠在上海之下而輔仁尤非所習聞乃能與諸强隊分庭相抗其敗或和乃令人有爲之惋惜之價値則輔仁技能之佳已遠在吾人預料或想像之上可知矣該隊將於十八早晨離滬返平吾人咸知告敗中所得之經騐鬩歴什伯倍有益於勝利輔仁爲求經騐鬩歴而來則領隊王石卿當亦如願以償欣然而歸矣别矣輔仁珍重前途後會有期</p>
<h3>一得一失針鋒相對</h3>
<p>三時有半大戰開始輔仁久之軍依然虎虎有生氣五分鐘内迫成角球葉德裕踼來至佳正在門前中鋒李鴻業冲入網内打開紀錄斯時之球神速之至復旦回攻右殿挑中余順章迎之以頭谷松齡雙手撲出不久球自右傳中漏過内衛趨向左方守門正擬奔前挽救復旦翼以恂先步趕到射入門中時在失球後之五分鐘也再五分鐘復旦鴻運照頭輔仁張这楨頂去之球乃被門柱擋駕又十二分鐘辅仁在罰區外被罰球觸中堅後腦幾乎假途入綱幸被守門摛住轉眼之間輔仁葉徳裕一脚迎中乃前鋒數將一一交臂尖之否則復旦殆矣</p>
<h3>風姨作怪客軍受創</h3>
<p>换陳再戰忽而風姨光臨於是復旦在占地利人和二利之外又得天時之助矣狂風挾沙正吹向輔仁而去球在空中失其自由完全受風支配復旦氣昂昂勇糾糾最初十分鐘之内環圍球門徘徊不去輔仁不嗚則已一嗚驚人右翼騰空造成險惡形勢繼成角球又在罰區外被罰再成角球　一而再再面三守者堅抗攻者無能爲力於是守者反攻攻者成守矣惟輔仁防衛之力亦森嚴可畏往往返返迨至二十五分鐘時一球自右翼何基棠傳來經周紹文一挑左翼黄鼎才一脚提起打入門内成二對一復旦占先此後復旦攻多於守亟至最後五分鐘内輔仁振臂一呼全軍齊起復旦境内倍受蹂躪兵臨城下不下三四次卒未破關斬衆者復旦之幸亦輔仁之不幸也銀笛再起劇戰閉　輔仁乃以一對二尖敗</p>

<h3>日人之敝帚自珍談</h3>
<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>日帝國大學敎授三浦周行君以研究法制史有名此次應廣州中山大學及嶺南大學之邀請來華講演道出首都由日本總領事館介绍在中大講演「日本文化之特質」一題家有敞帚享之千金三浦君其斯之謂乎（以下三浦君言）</p>
<p>日本建國距今二千五百九十一年凡百二十四代所謂萬世一系蓋無人覬觎皇位即有紛爭亦皇室内鬨裂爲兩朝而已其人民有謂自南洋來者有謂爲士著者然以大和民族爲中堅外入之民每久而同化故民族統一國家統一無顚覆之虞至佛敎基敎則皆以入日本而後發揚光大其人民對革命無興趣然於治國平天下則人人咸喻也高麗中國之革命皆無影響及於日本四百三十一年前日本與中國以平等通商其後對他國咸無所歧視平等眼光要爲日本特具也</p>
<p>中世紀間日本有平源兩氏之爭然不能謂爲革命當時男女夫婦之間皆相爲愛護此風後嘗丕變使上古中古之郅治蕩然無存致今人皆思回復往古隆盛之世而時爲革命之舉六三四年前之大化革新六三年前之明治維新皆復古之動機使然法國大革命時盧騷民約論倡返於原始其與日本不同者爲日本乃返於神武天皇時代而不及野蠻之原始且於變和平使其後對異國俘虜亦至爲優待於三百年前豐臣秀吉征高麗事足以徵之</p>
<p>國人於政治上亦有所謂階級者上古以氏族爲中心中古則以武士爲中心氏族武士中又自裂爲多種階級然於政治要無所爲害而咸以治理國家爲當務之急用維持日本文化於不敝雖有紛擾而大權固未嘗一日離天皇手每有挾天子以令諸候者常爲人民讉責而自退今以世界大　天皇一人不能日預萬機乃多所委治至社會雖有階級之限制然以平民崛起者亦所在多有德川藤原豐臣秀吉皆其著例自明治維新後個人主義功利主義入於日本一方打破階級之束縛一方野心者得以綠機操權徒以國家統一階級優越故復古之念時殷日本者蓋世界一至新與至舊之國家也歌舞亡於隋佛敎不傳於印然皆可於日本求之日本入於世界舞台迄今祇二十四年然歐美至新文化固燦然大備於三島之間也</p>
<h3>杭游掇錦</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>愚别西湖倐已八載今年春節偕綺城赴杭養疴因得舊地重游湖山無恙含笑相迎擇記一二以留鴻爪</p>
<p>▲市政進步之可驚八年前予初游杭是時僅環湖一帶有石子馬路今則幾已全易爲柏油路而四通八達之大道密如蛛綱游人閒步蘇白堤上幾疑置身仙境除此以外各名勝間之山道亦井井有序易於辨識如値岔道則有路牌高縣以免迷路故雖初至杭垣者遵道而行亦不致誤</p>

<h3>吃湯圓去</h3>
<p>— 冰遇</p>
<p>「主席今天該請客了你看天氣這様好連些微的風總没有又是星期你該踐約</p>
<p>時鐘已敲過九下即是最喜睡懶覺的沂這時已吃過早點他第一個敲門進來捧着一杯滿騰熱氣的開水得意洋洋的對我們學生會聞主席說了隨後檢起毅桌上前天的上海報一面等他答覆</p>
<p>「對喲今天是禮拜日又是晴天請客快寳山湯圓哈哈」</p>
<p>於是我們齊聲向主席進攻大家歡笑一陣都像預期着一件幸福之光臨沂也笑了凝視着主席</p>
<p>「好罷我本打算出去走走的假使你們願意去那到要快點遲了祇有吃閉門羹」</p>
<p>沂的鼓掌聲隨着他的履聲響出門外隣室頓時起了一陣喧嚣不一會七八個著制服的同學站在樓梯口主席也整理下衣冠放好錢袋更鎖好門便踏下樓層幾位興高采烈的同學愉快得幾乎忘了形像從籠中飛出的小鳥一步一跳的走着正吃好早點歸來而將至上海去的稀被我們綁着了任他如何掙扎也逃不出我們掌握雖則他跑脫過一次畢竟被捉住了</p>
<p>「喂那不是萍嗎當心點不要讓他逃脫我們非把他綁去不可玉稀交给你讓我來對付他」</p>
<p>沂的目力很好很遠的即辨出萍的面孔和步伐他明知道他也是要和稀一道到上海去的但有意要捉狹他萍也看出我們的一羣鬼鬼祟祟的即向操塲上跑去了可是新雨後的草地還有些濕瀌瀌新擦亮的皮鞋不願弄得拖泥帶水加之我們迎頭攔住去路他没有方法逃脫只得就摛了有點氣力的溪和沂在兩旁挾緊他的膀臂眞是兩個綁赴刑塲的犯人過路的男女老幼都向我們笑正吃完半碗麵的淑也被我們從飯館内拖出來我們都在雍容和氣中向前進</p>
<p>普通的圓子不過用米粉和水搓成的又有何種特色惹得人們惺惺的想吃呢但這却有段香艷的事實呢據說這個圓店並不寬敞可是「座上客常滿」呢爲的有兩位當罏少女雖則伊們的姿色並不一定有西施王嬙的美貌至是伊們所處的地位却夠引起一班無聊消遣的男性靑年注意了濱着寳山幾所學校的學生大有「生不願封萬户侯但願一見湯圆女」的趨勢呢所以每逢任何兩個學校的朋友相互遇到時没有不異口同聲讚賞的我呢到這邊時期當然算最短不過的然而「到寳山吃湯圓」的语名好像早已爛熟於懹可是始終嘗過這個口味現在呢春天來了又臨一鳥語花香時節誰都藴藏着無限的熱情都願意投身於大自然的懹抱裏盡情的沉醉一下並且我們各種課程纔開始呢聞主席的確爲過去的學生自治會盡勞盡瘁無形中犧牲丁許多學業他不忍再這樣昏迷迷的幹下去所以在這一次改選的當兒他就以逢星期日天晴請吃湯圓爲條件運動我们不要再選他在我們這方面祇需筆下超生便可以賺得一回眼福和口福又何不樂而爲此呢於是同學答應了當然的一班少投了幾十票我們老資格的主席落選了不過他有點舊成續其他的班上又選他一二十票還博得一席候補</p>
<p>久雨後的初晴大地上一切生物都在熱烈的恭迎着花團錦簇的春萎黄的田野踝露的枯木都抽出嫩綠的新芽已有些碧油油的可愛了風已不再像幾天前那樣刮痛面皮牠祇是柔和的像天鵝絨拂着面部的舒適牠雖這般無力然而却能吹起的大大小小的紙鳶在半空中奏出抑揚的歌曲呢遠處的林叢裏彷佛浮起一抺疏淡的輕烟隱現着紅牆綠瓦一羣鴿子從那裏飛出來「鳴鳴」的哨子立刻送進我們的聽覺於是我們也凑着熱閙的唱起新學的幾曲外國歌當我們在金黄色蕩漾着的天空下徜徉的時候不消兩刻鐘已到了高可手及的寳山縣城了</p>
<h3>獨坐</h3>
<p>— 冰攝</p>
<p>進城後第一個給與我們印象便是「寳山縣立師範學堂」的水門泥牌樓我們的脚步也自然的被一種莫明其妙的神秘力驅使着向北邊轉進去司閽人領我們到會客室聞主席簽好參觀人的姓氏後由一位朱君出來任指導之責他有時談到學生出路和敎育弳費問題上去興奮的面部表情像要噴出烈火似的會客室的坐椅那能容得下我們許多人坐呢雖則我們坐着的談得很起勁畢竟不願他們久立着看那些懸着的照片喲於是我們站起來請朱君領我們參觀各處除去掛了「謝絕參觀」牌子的女生宿舍外其餘的像敎室圖書館儀器室成續室……都看個淸白最後登上那座「遠吞山光平挹江瀨」的四方亭子江面反射出魚鮮般的萬頃波光遠近的船隻祇顯出幾個黑色輪廓了有些像浮游水上的海鳧點點的蠕動着</p>
<p>這裏不是我們駐足之地自然不能久留我們出來後更走了一段路在一家門首玉立着一位年可十七八的姑娘的街前自薦嚮導的稀忽然停步了他說「我們進去吧」於是我們毫不遲疑的穿過一間窄狹的低屋更經過一方天井在最後的一進屋屋内坐下了在另一桌上已有三位中公和商船的學生談笑着我們即自家整備桌椅大家坐定了沂拿出紙烟一一的分敬主席又忙着出去招呼碗數烟還没有吸到過半那位女招待已捧着圓盤進來一碗碗的放到各人面前這是帶點酸味的釀米小圓香甜的桂糖真等我們漱好口還留在齒隙呢又等了一會幾碗比較大些的白色圓子又捧進來裏面還包着甜　兩種　頭呢我們不能吞下許多勉强的吃好幾隻便詀起來房間裏又充滿了歡笑和烟霧啊石崇的「金谷之宴」其盛况也難過此吧</p>

<h3>Beijing Press Visits the Emden</h3>
<p>Crew Warmly Receives Guests</p>
<p>Captain Delivers Welcoming Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing - The German warship Emden, which came to China for a visit, arrived in Nanjing yesterday. At 10:00 AM this morning, it hosted the press to visit the ship. Over twenty people arrived and the ship had prepared a motorboat in advance to transport them on board in two trips. After everyone boarded, they waited briefly on the bow. Captain Weithaaf delivered a welcoming speech, and then Mr. Wang Yuguang, Secretary of the German Consulate, translated. Then, Major Gitte guided them to visit various parts of the ship, providing explanations one by one, such as the memorial room, rest room, dining hall, command bridge, measurement room, and compass room. They also viewed and explained the functions of the cannons, anti-aircraft guns, bridge railings, and watchtowers, and tested the depth sounder, which looked like a northern wine pot with a small amount of gunpowder stored in the lower part. When thrown into the water, it sank to the bottom and then exploded. The depth was calculated by timing, with two meters calculated per second. At the time of the test, the Jiangnan area had thirteen seconds, so if the depth there was calculated, it should be twenty-six meters. After the visit was over, a group photo was taken before dispersing. The ship's personnel stood upright on the ship, raising their hands in salute as they saw them off. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, the ship hosted over ten personnel from the Navy and Maritime Affairs departments, including Wang Youyu and Zhang Yuanhu. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Portugal After the Spanish Republic</h3>
<p>Portugal, which was first affected after Spain announced its republic, is also worth discussing. Portugal had already reorganized its republican government after expelling King Manuel II in 1910 and announced its republican constitution in 1917. However, although the country was called a republic, the actual situation was the same as in Spain. The national character was the same, and the complexity of the political parties was also the same. Therefore, revolutions and disturbances occurred every year. Later, the ruling party saw that the political situation could not be stabilized and rose to emulate the dictatorial politics of Italy, which was also the same as in Spain. Since the implementation of dictatorship, internal strife has intensified and revolutionary tides have become more and more rapid. In 1926 alone, three revolutions occurred. The situation was also the same as in Spain after the implementation of dictatorship. As for the recent ongoing internal strife, the so-called Madeira rebels are said to have been encouraged by the Spanish declaration of a republic. The Inspector General of the Army has resigned because he could not command. It can be seen that the situation of the riots in Portugal has become serious. However, the purpose of the Spanish revolution is to fight for a republic, while Portugal has been a republic for a long time. The only banner it can use to rally support is to overthrow the dictatorial government. However, considering the domestic situation, the real cause of the internal strife is not this, but that Portugal's education is not widespread and the people's level is too low, and they do not know what politics is, so they are easily used by politicians and warlords. The governance of a country is closely related to the level of its people. If there are many ignorant people, the monarchy will be chaotic, the republic will be chaotic, the dictatorship will be chaotic, and even the absence of dictatorship will be chaotic. The situation in Portugal is like this. We are therefore aware that today's Spain has just gained a republic and the people are overjoyed. However, whether or not internal strife will occur later and the political situation can be stable is still uncertain.</p>

<h3>The Abdicated King of Spain Is Reluctant to Relinquish Royal Power</h3>
<p>Extremely Distressed Upon Leaving the Country</p>
<p>Will Observe the Political Situation Quietly</p>
<p>The New Government Is Busy Working and Preparing for a General Amnesty</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th: The Queen of Spain, accompanied by her three sons and two daughters, traveled by car to the Escorial station, a few miles northwest of the capital. The car stopped on the roadside outside the station for about an hour before the train arrived. The Queen and her party then entered the station, where many former cabinet members and nobles were waiting. The noblewomen could not help but embrace the Queen. Prince Asturias, who was suffering from a fever, was helped onto the train by attendants. Shortly after, the train sounded its whistle and departed with the royal family towards the border. King Alfonso's departure from the palace was very secretive and extremely distressing. After the car was waiting outside the side door, the King entered the Prince's bedroom. The Prince was lying in bed, talking to several relatives and nobles. When they saw the King enter, they all withdrew. The King spoke with the Prince for a while, then came out with a calm expression and said to those standing by, "I must show that I am more supportive of democracy than those who call themselves democrats. After the results of Sunday's election were announced, there was only one path to take. If I didn't do this, it would cause civil war. I love Spain, how could I bear to do this?" Those who heard this shed tears. The King embraced each person with affectionate words, then had a light meal. After finishing, the King bid farewell to his wife and asked her to return to her room. He then turned to the halberd-bearing guards and said a few words to them. The guards shouted, "Long live our King!" Everyone present was saddened, but the King remained calm, waved his hand, and replied calmly, "Long live Spain!" After saying this, he entered the elevator and left the palace. The declaration written by the King before his departure stated that the election had clearly shown that he had lost the support of the people. He only relied on his conscience. He knew that this kind of dissension was temporary and not permanent, because he had always acted in the service of the country. He could not avoid failing sometimes, but Spain had always been forgiving of unintentional mistakes.</p>
<h3>The Abdicated King of Spain (right) and his Queen (left)</h3>
<p>He was also not unable to use various methods to maintain royal privileges and fight against the opposition, but he would never do anything that could cause the people to fight among themselves. He has not relinquished any rights. He is now waiting for the true expression of public opinion. Until the people have declared their intentions, he will temporarily suspend the exercise of royal power and go abroad. This is to acknowledge that the people are the sole masters of the country's future. He is motivated by patriotism and fulfills his responsibility, hoping that other Spaniards will also deeply understand their responsibilities.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bordeaux, 16th: Republican France has been deeply moved by the tears of a Queen. Since the Queen of Spain left her country and entered France, the stations where she stopped have been greeted by crowds who cheered and presented flowers. Even within her own country, many towns have expressed their respect and bid her farewell. Many of the Queen's friends in San Sebastian were surprised and dismayed to see the tears on her face and her white hair. When the Queen spoke with a French reporter in Hendaye, she was deeply concerned about the King, saying that as far as she knew, the King had left the country by ship. She also said that this scene and this situation were heartbreaking. The French reporter said that abdication was better than bloodshed. Hearing this, she suddenly looked surprised and said, "Abdication? The die is cast, what more can be said?" The Queen then said that this revolution was completely unexpected, as if the tide of communism had driven the people into madness. At this point, she sighed and said, "If we had stayed in Madrid, we don't know what would have happened to us." Then the Queen was silent for a moment, and then said, "At least part of the army was willing to serve the King, but the King was unwilling to ask for their help."</p>
<p>Reuters, Marseille, 16th: The Duke of Miranda said here today to a Reuters reporter that he announced to the world that the King of Spain had not abdicated. King Alfonso declined all audiences, only ordering the Duke to issue this statement on his behalf. The Duke said that the King of Spain still fully retained his royal prerogatives. His only purpose in leaving the country was to avoid civil war. The King allowed the people to clearly express their wishes in the general election in June of this year, and he would follow the public opinion. Alfonso is now planning to go to Paris to meet his family for a short stay and then go to London together.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 16th: When the Queen of Spain arrived here, the station was crowded with onlookers.

The Queen remained calm, while her two daughters had pale faces and tears in their eyes. When the palace guard helped the Prince to get off the car, the crowd shouted "Long live the Prince!" The scene was very touching. Then the Queen and her party entered the cars, and because the onlookers were shoulder to shoulder, it took a long time to drive away. The Queen and her party are currently staying at a hotel on Rue de Rivoli, with thirty-three people occupying twenty-eight rooms.</p>

<p>Japanese Trade with China Is Increasingly Dominant</p>
<p>Advocates Reforming Distribution Methods</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th: The report of the Cotton Industry Committee of the Far East Inspection Group has a warning for Lancashire, stating that if its cotton goods cannot be displayed on the market at competitive prices, it cannot hope to restore or maintain its Far East trade. It also stated that Lancashire should have closer ties with the Chinese market and advocated the establishment of a special agency to handle this matter. The Japanese market is simply closed to British goods, but China still needs to import a large number of piece goods. However, the people's purchasing power has been weakened, so the quality of goods has become a secondary consideration. If Lancashire wants to regain its lost ground, its prices must not exceed those of its main rival, Japan. Japanese goods have advantages in manufacturing costs everywhere, which is very effective. Reducing costs should be the first priority for British goods. The current distribution situation is not satisfactory. Various proposals for promoting British cotton cloth all advocate establishing a company in the UK to handle the export of Lancashire cotton cloth and its sale in China. There are three sales methods: (1) Selling to importers and distributors in various treaty ports, and then distributing them by Chinese merchants; (2) Selling directly to Chinese merchants in treaty ports; (3) Or having one's own agents handle all matters such as distribution and sales. As for trading in the interior, it is unwise because of local unrest and the opposition of existing cloth merchants. In conclusion, if there is no active reform of the distribution methods, Lancashire has no hope of increasing its trade in the Eastern market.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Hangzhou: For the Public Information of All Newspapers - Unequal treaties are the only tool by which imperialism binds our country, causing us to lose our equality and freedom. The economic exhaustion, political division, and social decline of our country over the years can all be traced back to unequal treaties. If unequal treaties are not thoroughly abolished, not only will our country be mired in a semi-colonial status, and our nation will suffer forever, but world peace will also be undermined by the conflict of interests of imperialists in China. Abolishing unequal treaties is not only to seek equality for our country's international status and the survival of our nation, but also to maintain world peace. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of our party, foresaw this, so he advocated abolishing unequal treaties to fight against imperialism. Not only did he clearly define its goals in the foreign policy of the First National Congress of our party, but he also earnestly expressed his hope at the time of his death. In recent years, due to the efforts of our party, the people of the whole country know that thoroughly abolishing unequal treaties is the only way for the survival of the Chinese nation and the maintenance of world peace. The sincerity that has been sown has been heard by all countries in the world. However, the imperialists, limited by their short-sighted self-interest, often use the excuse that our country is not unified, intending to wait and see and unwilling to thoroughly abolish them. Recently, our party has unified the country, and the people of the whole country earnestly hope to build a new country based on the Three Principles of the People. These unequal treaties, which trap our country in a semi-colonial status and will ultimately undermine world peace, cannot be allowed to exist for a single day when the whole country is unified and construction begins. However, the imperialists' cunning words and delays in abolishing unequal treaties are their usual tricks to deceive our country, and it is not easy to expect success from empty negotiations. Now that the National Assembly has opened, this is not only a manifestation of the will of the people of the whole country, but also the key to building a new country based on the Three Principles of the People. All our people should unanimously demand that the National Assembly automatically declare to the outside world the abolition of all unequal treaties in order to promote the imperialists' awareness and their willingness to automatically abandon all privileges and abolish all relations that undermine our country's sovereignty. For the sake of our country's survival and world peace, we should all recognize the most favored nation. Our nation has always been known for its love of peace, and blind xenophobia is certainly not what it advocates. However, if the imperialists still do not realize this and are unwilling to abolish the unequal treaties, hoping to delay, then they are determined to destroy our nation's vitality and are all enemies of our nation. The people of the whole country should generously rise up and resolutely break off economic relations with them, and hold on to a spirit of perseverance and determination to achieve thoroughness, not only so that our nation can gain its freedom and survival and prosperity, but also so that the future of world peace will inevitably be determined by this. Sincerely reported, and hope that you will discern and unanimously advocate that the future of our Chinese nation depends on this. The Executive Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully prints.</p>

<h3>Reasons Why Beijing-Ping Aircraft Do Not Stop Over in Tianjin</h3>
<p>French Barracks Obstruct the Establishment of an Aviation Station</p>
<p>Tianjin Mail is Shipped to Beiping for Loading and Heading South</p>
<p>Tianjin Aviation Express Letter - The Beijing-Ping Aviation has been preparing for several months, and the official opening has been repeatedly delayed because the Tianjin aviation station cannot stop the aircraft. Taking advantage of the anniversary of the first flight, the process is recorded as follows: In early March, Nie Kaiyi, the director of the Beijing-Ping Aviation, and Zhang Huayi, the pilot, drove the Tianjin aircraft from Shanghai to Tianjin and landed at Dongjuzi. All those who came to welcome them were stopped by the French soldiers when their cars passed through the French barracks at Dongjuzi, who claimed that the area was under the jurisdiction of the French barracks and that they had to obtain a permit from the French barracks to pass through this road. Therefore, all vehicles detoured. After Nie Kaiyi got off the plane, he immediately began surveying the airfield and decided that the eastern corner of the International Racecourse was flat and dry, which was very suitable for the takeoff and landing of airplanes. However, there were still prerequisite questions: (1) The designated airfield must obtain the consent of the International Racecourse. (2) The road from Dongjuzi to Dabizhuang Road, which is about ten miles long and was built by the French barracks, must also be notified to avoid future obstruction. Anyone would consider these to be small problems. Therefore, Tan Fu, the English secretary of the municipal government, separately contacted them. Regarding the airfield, the racecourse agreed to lend it. Regarding the road, the French barracks initially did not allow it, but later allowed the vehicles of the airline to pass through because the reasons were insufficient. However, they stated that the aircraft must not stay for more than twenty minutes and were limited to carrying mail and passengers. At this point, the aviation station was considered to have been resolved. Therefore, Mr. Nie said at the time that it would be officially open on April 1. In late March, the old site of the Dongjuzi Binta Hotel was rented as the Tianjin Aviation Office. It was found that there were hundreds of merchants and residents living in Dongjuzi who had to pay taxes to the French barracks for doing business. Matters such as birth, old age, death, burial, and moving had to be reported to the French barracks. It is difficult to investigate when these evil practices began. However, the Aviation Office initially believed that Dongjuzi was Chinese territory and that the French barracks had no right to interfere in affairs within Chinese territory. Therefore, they did not report to the French barracks and immediately began preparing everything. Unexpectedly, when they sent personnel to install wireless radio transmitters and receivers, the antenna pole had just been erected when the French barracks came out to interfere, saying that the French barracks had a radio station and that if the Aviation Office set up a radio station, it would disturb the French barracks' communication waves. Tan Fu immediately explained to them that the wireless radio station set up by the office was the latest type and would not interfere with the sound waves of the neighboring station. If they did not believe it, they could ask experts to test it. The French barracks then demanded a formal letter of written proof. The airline then sent a letter explaining everything. After the letter was sent, not only was the installation of the radio station not allowed, but also the signboard of the office was not allowed to be hung. Tan Fu went to negotiate again, but the French barracks, the French consul, and the French commander pushed each other and could not get any results. Later, the office sent personnel to the airfield to survey the signs. Suddenly, a shell flew over. Although it did not explode, the personnel had already been frightened. When they asked the locals, they learned that the French soldiers were always target shooting at Shishi Mountain, raising a red flag high. The east of the red flag was the dangerous zone, and stray bullets would fall from time to time. The west of the red flag was the safe zone. The personnel learned a lesson from this bullet and were deeply afraid that the French soldiers would fire two shots or a cannon at the airplane when it was taking off or landing, claiming that it was a stray bullet and should be considered dangerous. Therefore, they asked Tan Fu to negotiate with the French barracks and ask them to move the target shooting direction. The French barracks only agreed to stop shooting when the airplane arrived in Tianjin but did not agree to move the target shooting direction. Because the office was located in Dongjuzi, which is about twenty miles from the city, they sent a letter to the telephone bureau to install a telephone. The bureau sent personnel to measure it and found that a total of two hundred telephone poles were needed, and each pole was estimated to cost twenty yuan, totaling four thousand yuan. The airline agreed to pay two thousand yuan, but the telephone bureau did not agree. Originally, the French barracks had a military telephone that went directly to the residence of the French commander in the city. They wanted to borrow the military telephone poles, but the French soldiers did not agree. Due to the delay in these negotiations, the Beijing-Ping flight was changed to April 15. On the 12th, Nie Kaiyi came to Tianjin again, intending to find a way to complete the radio station, but Tan Fu had already resigned. The new secretary of the municipal government was unfamiliar with the people and the place and could not handle the negotiations. Therefore, on the 13th, Mr. Nie sent a letter to the Tianjin Postal Administration to collect and send airmail, requesting that it be transported to Beiping for loading and heading south. The airplane passed through Tianjin without stopping. At present, the office is surveying the airfield outside the racecourse and has decided to set up the office inside the airfield. Although this can avoid the unreasonable obstruction of the French barracks, it is not a safe solution because the airfield is surrounded by wilderness and the police force in the Dabizhuang rural area is insufficient. In this era of rampant bandits, the office personnel are in danger every day. Therefore, for the sake of a foolproof plan, it is necessary to find another airfield. (April 14)</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu's Inspection Tour of Various Counties</h3>
<p>Will Return to the Province After Visiting the Counties in the Western District for Two Weeks</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Chairman Chen Mingshu of the Provincial Government recently decided to inspect all the counties under its jurisdiction, investigate village and rural life, so as to develop local undertakings and promote local autonomy. He will carry out reforms based on the findings of the inspection. He had already telegraphed the county magistrates to decline all private group banquets, stipulating that the hospitality banquet expenses for the county magistrates should not exceed six yuan. He also instructed the various departments under his jurisdiction to prepare lists of matters that should be investigated, so that they could be filled out when he arrived at the counties. The investigation items include water conservancy, minerals, commerce, forests, agricultural products, farmers' lives, handicrafts, the organization and training of party departments at all levels, and the administrative situation of county and city organs. Each staff member was assigned to specific tasks in advance (Huang Qiang was responsible for the guard team, Baojia system, pacification, highways, public utilities, construction; Sun Xiwent was responsible for autonomy preparations, civil servant assessment, the situation of good and bad officials, clearing backlog cases, health matters; Xu Xiqing was responsible for the collection of various regular taxes and exorbitant miscellaneous levies; Ning Kefeng was responsible for the investigation of opium, gambling, and superstition; Guang Mingfu was responsible for the investigation of prisons, the clearing of backlog cases, and the handling of education; Tan Dalun was responsible for transportation and telephone matters). The lists and accompanying personnel were prepared and deployed before the 9th. On the morning of the 10th, Chen attended the provincial affairs meeting. In addition to resolving important cases, he entrusted Xu Chongqing and the secretariat to handle the administrative affairs that should be handled during the inspection period. Before 10 o'clock, the accompanying staff and attendants had gathered at the Tianzi Wharf. The two painted boats, Zhaoxiang and Caixian, were already waiting. The guards and servants rode on the Caixian boat, while Chen and his staff took the Zhaoxiang as their vehicle. In addition to Deng Yanhua, the director of the Construction Department, the accompanying figures included the aforementioned staff and adjutant Pang, a total of more than 20 people. The first platoon of the second battalion of the Provincial Security Department was dispatched to provide protection. At 10:25, Chen drove from the provincial government to the wharf and exchanged greetings with the officials of the government and military who came to see him off for about ten minutes. The two boats set sail, towed by a small steamship named Chengchang. The navy dispatched the Jianru warship to escort them. At 10:40, after the ship lifted anchor, the send-off party dispersed one after another. During Chen's inspection period, the daily affairs of the provincial government were handled by the secretariat, and the chairman's powers were delegated to Xu Chongqing, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs. Chen's inspection is divided into three phases: the first phase is Shunde, Xinhui, Heshan, Taishan, and Kaiping counties; the second phase is Sanshui, Gaoyao, and Deqing counties; the third phase is Dongguan and Baoan counties. Today, he set off for Daliang, where the Shunde County Government is located. He will stay for one or two days and then go to Xinhui and other counties in order. It is expected that the tour will be completed in two weeks and he will return to the province (Evening of April 10th).</p>

<h3>Successive Destruction of Important Bandit Nests in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Red Bandits No Longer Have a Base</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the remnants of the communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, and others retreated to Yongfeng, Lean, Xingguo, Ningdu, and Yudu, they have been trying to resist stubbornly. Therefore, the national army's suppression is extremely cautious and takes the form of encirclement in order to completely eliminate the communist bandits. Yesterday, Director He received reports from various parties: (1) On the Ji'an front, our right-wing General Gong's division has occupied Gupi Luojiawei (east of Taihe and bordering Ji'an) and Futian (bordering Ji'an, Yongfeng, Taihe, and Xingguo), defeating more than 2,000 communist bandits of the pseudo Fourth Army and capturing and killing many of them. General Gong's division is also following up the pursuit and has occupied the back mountain of Donggu, fiercely attacking the bandits in Donggu. At the same time, the bandits in Yesterday's Mengshan, Rongshan, and Tantou have been suppressed. The left-wing General Hao's division has suppressed the bandits in the Liangfangqiao Dahuwei area. On the 4th, they encountered 700-800 red bandits in Nanhua Mountain and also repelled them. (2) At the junction of Xingguo and Yongfeng, Ji'an, and Taihe, General Cai's division advanced towards Ningdu after arriving in Xingguo. According to an telegram from Xingguo on the 9th, the 19th Route Army has recovered Longgang Chenggang and Jiangbeidong, defeating more than 2,000 bandits of the pseudo Seventh Division. The remaining bandits fled to Wulipai, and the left wing is advancing fiercely towards Xiaoxi. (3) Jishui is located between Ji'an and Yongfeng. Baisha Shuikou and Shuinan Shuikou are located northwest of Futian and have always been the nests of communist bandits. They have now been recovered by General Wang's troops. Also, 500-600 red bandits in Wangsikeng and Wanchongwei in Jishui were holding a meeting on the 8th when our army arrived, killing 40-50 bandits. The remaining bandits fled to Huxi. (4) Yongfeng County is located between Le'an, Ji'an, Jishui, Xingguo, Ningdu, and Yudu. Tengtian and Yaotian and other places in the county are the bases of communist bandits and have been successively defeated by General Gao's division. Also, the bandit nests in Zhaoxie, which is next to Le'an, have also been occupied by the 26th Route Army. Also, an telegram from Yongfeng on the 8th stated that the bandit nest in Felt Hat Mountain was also attacked by our army, and the pseudo-government organs were burned and more than 200 male and female bandits were killed. (5) The Sixth Route Army is making rapid progress in Nanfeng. After General Xu and Mao's troops broke through Liaobei Qiachun Luofang at the junction of Nanfeng and Guangchang, the left wing captured Ganzhuwei and the right wing arrived at Xintian Kuzhu, only more than 20 miles away from Guangchang City. The above-mentioned places are all bases of communist bandits and have established Soviet pseudo-party departments at all levels, peasant and worker banks, Red Army schools, and rear hospitals. Now they have all been destroyed one by one. From then on, the communist bandits should collapse. On the 7th, the headquarters received an telegram from Yuanzhou stating that the remnants of Kong Hechong's troops were in Wan</p>

<h3>Dai and Liu's Opinions on Raising Funds to Repair the Confucius Forest</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Government launched a fundraising campaign to repair the Confucius Forest and Temple in Qufu, and telegraphed various parties to list their names. Many telegrams have been received expressing support. Now, Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian and Liu Jiwen have sent a letter to Education Director He Siyuan and forwarded it to all members of the Provincial Committee, expressing their opinions on raising funds to repair the Confucius Temple in Qufu. They advocated that the Fuxing Temple and Mausoleum in Qufu, the Yasheng Temple and Mausoleum in Zou County, and the Zongsheng Temple and Mausoleum in Jiaxiang should also be repaired and that regulations for the sacrificial officials should be formulated to ensure their long-term existence. They requested the Shandong Provincial Government to refer to the original method, consider the current situation, and draft a plan to be submitted to the Central Government for enactment. Yesterday, the Provincial Government's 50th Standing Committee meeting decided through a temporary motion to publicly recommend Li Shuchun, Zhang Honglie, He Siyuan, and Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang to jointly draft a plan. The original letter from Dai and Liu is as follows: "The day before yesterday, I received Chairman Han's telegram to Brother Xiangfang, saying that he intends to launch a restoration of the Confucius Temple. Brother Jiwen also mentioned this matter when he returned to Beijing. This is truly a major event for the Republic of China. Before, when the teacher passed through Qufu and visited the temples of Confucius, Mencius, Yan, and Si, he had this feeling. After returning to Beijing, he reported this matter to the Central Government and intended to request the Central Government to allocate funds to promote it. The remaining funds would be borne by the Shandong Provincial Government, a portion would be shared by the provincial governments, and a portion would be raised from the people. There is no shortage of patriots at home and abroad, and it would not be difficult to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. Regarding the restoration project, our opinions are as follows: (1) The basic structure of the Confucius Temple has not been greatly damaged, and restoration is easy. However, the lacquer work and painting may be very expensive. Approximately 200,000 dollars can complete the work. (2) The Yan Temple has already decayed, and last year it was more severely damaged than the Confucius Temple. Restoring it to its original scale may cost at least 200,000 dollars. (3) The Mencius Temple should also be repaired at the same time, which may also require about 100,000 dollars. (4) Zisi was a master of his generation, and Confucius's thoughts were transmitted and sustained for a long time because of him, but his temple is extremely humble. It seems appropriate to expand it slightly, which may also require tens of thousands of dollars. (5) The tombs of Confucius, Mencius, and other sages should also be repaired at this time. This kind of project is most difficult to obtain an opportunity. Once this opportunity passes, it will not be easy to start from scratch in the future. We, the authorities, do not know when it will be. It is best to work hard in a timely manner to complete everything at once. (6) The residences of the sacrificial officials of the Confucius and Mencius families should also be repaired at the same time. Approximately 30,000 to 40,000 dollars can make the Confucius family brand new, and at most 10,000 dollars can completely repair the Mencius family. The existence of these two families is a great glory for the Chinese nation. People from all countries who come to visit the tombs of Confucius and Mencius will definitely visit these two families. If there is no considerable scale, it will be very inappropriate. We believe that it is appropriate to formulate regulations for the sacrificial officials in a timely manner (one for each family, there is no need to mix them together because their scales cannot be the same). The content is as follows: 1. The duties and inheritance of the sacrificial officials; 2. The age of majority of the sacrificial officials and the protection during their minority; 3. The education of the sacrificial officials; 4. The management of the property of the sacrificial officials; 5. The sacrificial officials shall not do the following things: (A) They shall not be soldiers; (B) They shall not accept any religious ceremonies or missionaries; (C) They shall not engage in commerce; (D) They shall not hold other official positions; (E) They shall not be officials of any political party; (7) The government should organize the property of the sacrificial officials, such as finding out and returning the land that cannot be rented now, etc. For all of the above matters, please conduct detailed research by the Shandong Provincial Government, find out the original method, consider the current situation, and draft a plan to be submitted to the Central Government for enactment. This is truly the glory of the Chinese nation for all time. If the Provincial Government can do this, it will be admired for thousands of years. How about hoping to inform us of your esteemed opinion? Your brothers, Dai Chuanxian and Liu Jiwen, together opened on April 11th. Furthermore, we believe that it is not difficult to raise millions of dollars for this kind of fundraising. If we take this opportunity to use the surplus funds raised as educational funds for the two counties of Qufu and Zou County and make these two counties model counties for education, it will also be a great event. Approximately hundreds of thousands can easily be raised in Hong Kong, Nanyang, the Americas, and other places, because Hong Kong is currently in the midst of a revival of Confucianism."</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion of Wu Tiecheng's Arrival in Longjiang</h3>
<p>Longjiang Correspondence: Wu Tiecheng, a special envoy of the Central Government to inspect party affairs in the Northeast, arrived in Longjiang by the Qi'ang special train at 10:35 last night (the 8th). The four accompanying personnel were Mai Zhaoshu, Wang Xingzhou, Chen Yinong, and Huang Jianfen. Wan Fulin, chairman of the Provincial Government (Wan returned to the province from Liaoning at 2:00 p.m. yesterday), as well as various provincial committee members, directors, and leaders of military and political organs, a total of seventy or eighty people, were all at the station to welcome him. When the special train entered the station, the military band of the Military Department and the military band of the Boji Factory played music. After Wu and the accompanying personnel got off the train, they shook hands with Wan and exchanged greetings, and then shook hands with each of the welcoming personnel to express their thanks. Then, he and Wan went to the Longjiang Hotel in the same car for refreshments. At that time, a total of thirty or forty welcoming personnel followed to the hotel. Wan introduced each of them to Wu, and they sat down for a conversation for about ten minutes before they all bid farewell and left. Wu had been giving lectures at various schools in Jilin and Harbin for several days in a row, so he was extremely tired and his voice was slightly hoarse. It was quite difficult to speak. Wan urged him to rest for a day today (April 9th).</p>
<h3>The Third Joint Meeting of Chambers of Commerce in Various Counties of Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Telegraphed the Central Government to Request a Temporary Suspension of the Collection of Business Tax</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. on the 15th, representatives of chambers of commerce from various counties in Jiangsu held their third joint meeting at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce. Sixty-five people, including Wang Jingting of Jiangdu, attended. Yu Xiaochuan presided over the meeting. The following matters were discussed: (1) The issue of subscription for business tax should be discussed. The discussion concluded that the issue of subscription cannot be established after the provincial government has decided on the date of collection, so there is no need to discuss it. The chairman should reply to the provincial government. (2) The regulations for the collection of business tax in Jiangsu Province have not been finally reviewed by the Central Political Council and the Legislative Yuan. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has scheduled to start collection on April 1st. How should we express our opinion? The discussion concluded: 1. The provincial government's order to start collecting business tax on April 1st should be based on the previous resolution and send another telegram to the Central Political Council ordering it to stop before the Jiangsu Province regulations have undergone legal procedures, and also telegram the Jiangsu Provincial Government to temporarily suspend collection in order to maintain the law. 2. Continue to request the Legislative Yuan to adopt the eight points of the petition. (3) The Kunshan Chamber of Commerce proposed that soybean cake is a fertilizer for farmland and should be requested to the Ministry of Finance to exempt it from business tax in order to promote agriculture. The discussion concluded that it should be approved. (4) The Liuhe Chamber of Commerce proposed that shops that also sell cigarettes and alcohol and have already obtained cigarette and alcohol licenses should present to the province that they should not be charged business tax again in order to comply with the ministerial order and avoid double taxation. The discussion concluded that it should be approved. (5) The Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce proposed that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Unified Tax Bureau draft a simple method for textile factories to manufacture finished cotton yarn from taxed cotton yarn directly. Please unanimously advocate for its revocation. The discussion concluded that it should be approved and representatives from Jiangyin and Wujin counties should be pushed to go to Shanghai with Li Shengbo to negotiate with the bureau. (6) The Provincial Party Department has issued a reply to the Zhenjiang County Chamber of Commerce and others regarding the application for a permit to organize a commercial association, stating that it must wait until two-thirds or more of the chambers of commerce in the province apply before it can be reviewed. Please discuss. The discussion concluded that the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce should send a telegram to explain. (7) The Wujiang Chamber of Commerce proposed that the National Assembly is about to open. Should a proposal committee be organized for the proposals of various county chambers of commerce? The discussion concluded that a proposal committee should be organized with the future elected representatives as members. A circular should be sent to all county chambers of commerce stating that if there are any proposals, they should be sent to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce for transfer to the proposal committee before the end of April.</p>
<p>Attached is the telegram from the chambers of commerce of various counties to the Central Government: (1) Respectfully addressed to the Executive Yuan, National Government, and Central Political Council: The Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations were hastily amended by the Ministry of Finance in a short period of time. Its taxation and classification are still mostly harsh and disturbing to the people. The Shanghai market is the commercial center of Jiangsu Province. Before the Shanghai market is held, the Jiangsu Province's hasty decision to start collection is enough to stifle the commerce of various counties in the interior. The situation is frightening and urgent. I beg you to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government not to rush to start collection before the Legislative Yuan has reviewed and finalized it and before the Shanghai market has opened in order to achieve equality and avoid partiality. Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujin, Jiangdu, Nantong, Gangshan, Huaiyin, and other forty-three chambers of commerce kowtow together. (2) Respectfully addressed to the Central Political Council: The regulations for the business tax in Jiangsu Province, although revised by the Ministry of Finance, are still mostly inconsistent with the outline set by the 17th Year of the Republic of China meeting on abolishing the likin tax. I have sent representatives to the Yuan and Ministry on the 14th of this month to present a petition based on the original outline and the principle of abolishing the likin tax and put forward eight points. I was fortunate to have the Yuan and Ministry issue an edict that the meeting was currently reviewing and would be forwarded for verification and adoption. I respectfully send this telegram to express my feelings and beg you to extend a lifeline to the merchants and people, to correct them separately, and to order the Yuan and Ministry to instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government not to implement them before they are approved by your council in accordance with the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of this session in order to emphasize the rule of law and relieve the merchants' difficulties. I cannot bear the urgency and await orders. The representatives of the chambers of commerce in various counties of Jiangsu have returned. Shen Zhiwan, Qian Sunqing, Yu Xiaochuan, Li Shengbo, Cheng Ganqing, Xu Yao, Ren Yaofu, etc., kowtow and delete.</p>

Five men from Changzhou, including Sun Huanshou, Zhu Changlin, and Shang Yusheng, were also sitting nearby sipping tea. Seeing that Lin Alan was beautiful, they began to tease her in every way. Lin Alan refused, and an argument ensued, followed by a physical fight. At that time, Chen Changyu from Xizhang, who was sipping tea at the opposite table, stepped forward to mediate. Unexpectedly, Shang Yusheng, without asking why, swung the trowel he was holding directly at Chen Changyu's head. Blood immediately flowed like a waterfall, and he fell to the ground unconscious in extreme pain. Afterwards, the tea house waiter reported the incident to the police on duty, who apprehended the assailant, Shang Yusheng, and took him to the station for interrogation.

<p>A Beautiful Woman from Hanzhuang Dies in a Fire: Wang Caiyun, a resident of No. 22, Front Zhongzheng Road outside Guangfu Gate, was from Changan Bridge in the northern countryside. Nicknamed "Peeled White Chicken Egg," she was extremely beautiful and engaged in secret activities with many lovers. Ten years ago, she roamed Shanghai, where a certain Japanese man was very fond of her, listening and obeying her commands. She acquired more than ten thousand taels of gold and then left. Caiyun took her assets and returned to her hometown, building two two-story buildings on Zhongzheng Road, renting them to four families to the west. Caiyun traveled between Wuxi and Shanghai. On the morning of the day before yesterday, she was in the midst of a dream with her lover, a Mr. Zou (who traded in leather goods). Fu Bao, the eight-year-old son of Wen Genrong, who lived in a downstairs house to the west, was playing with matches, which ignited the reeds in the courtyard. In an instant, fierce flames soared uncontrollably. Caiyun heard the sound, woke up in shock, and ran out. Then, remembering that her old mother, Zhuang, was lying ill in bed, she rushed back into the fire, intending to rescue her mother. However, the stairs had broken, and the fire spread to her clothes and pants, causing the mother and daughter to die together in the fire. When the fire brigades put out the fire, all the houses had been reduced to ashes. Afterwards, the bodies of Zhuang and Wang Caiyun, mother and daughter, were dug out, but they had been burned into charred remains little more than a foot long. The limbs were indistinguishable, and only the head was the size of a teacup, a truly horrific sight.</p>

<h3>Sino-French Academic Expedition Postponed</h3>
<p>Truck Skin Breaks, Electric Law Zero Luck</p>
<p>Frenchman Apologizes for Independent Action</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Beiping, 14th (Air Express): Chu Minyi, head of the Sino-French Academic Expedition, arrived in Beiping on the 7th of this month. The expedition's vehicles departed from Tianjin on the 6th. They passed through Beiping in the afternoon without stopping. Their destination was Zhangjiakou. The team leader, a Frenchman named Xia An, telegraphed Chu from Tianjin, saying only that the vehicle was scheduled to depart for Beiping on the 6th. Since leaving Beiping North, he had not obtained the permission of the team leader. After Chu arrived on the 7th, the team members and academics were very dissatisfied that the vehicle team had independently left Beiping North. In particular, the specialists sent by the military and参部 believed that the vehicle team had not been inspected when it left Beiping, and that there was no way to monitor it en route, which was inappropriate. They all requested that Chu raise serious questions. The next day (the 8th), the Ancient Relics Preservation Committee held a meeting and decided to appoint Ma Heng, Xu Bingchang, and Zeng to negotiate with the French on three matters along with Mr. Chu: (1) Why did the vehicle team leave without permission? (2) Route issues. (3) Approval of the list of French team members. The Ancient Relics Preservation Committee is entrusted by the Chinese Academic Association to oversee the Sino-French expedition, and the cooperative route agreed upon last year is still pending, and it is stipulated that French team members will be appointed after review by this association, so procedures remain to be completed. On the 9th, Chu and some team members traveled to Nankou and encountered the vehicle team in Xueshan Village, north of Changping County, where they were parked and repairing everything. At that time, team leader Bu An said that this vehicle was a climbing tool. The thick and firm rubber strips on the wheels of the two vehicles in the rear were specially manufactured in France. They were shipped to China by sea. Because they were not sealed, they were susceptible to severe weather changes and humidity. They were brittle and easily broken. Therefore, three or four strips had deteriorated just three days after departure. It was extremely difficult to deal with such unexpected events. What was originally a very strong object had changed to become easily damaged. The original preparations were absolutely unable to cope with the long journey. It had already urgently telegraphed France to ship new rubber strips via the Siberian Railway. It would only dare to travel far after the strips arrived. Therefore, the departure date had to be postponed. This morning (the 14th), Bu An reported to Chu that the rubber strips had been shipped from France and would arrive in China soon. It was expected that the team members could take a bus from Beiping to Zhang next Thursday (the 23rd), where they would switch to climbing vehicles and travel west. The reason for the team's delay was entirely due to the carelessness of the French, which caused the entire team to stop. Fortunately, it was discovered early and could still be remedied, otherwise the future trip would have turned into an unimaginable tragedy. Regarding the unresolved negotiations between the Chinese and French sides of the team, Chu, Ma, and Xu negotiated with Bu An at the Ancient Relics Preservation Committee in Tuancheng at 3:00 pm yesterday (the 13th), and all had satisfactory results. Bu An explained the independent action and expressed his apology. The Chinese side understood. The inspection route, except for the section from Beiping to the south, will be determined when they arrive in Beiping in the future. After arriving at Zhangjiakou, they will pass through the Baza Temple, Sande Temple, Torghut Wangfu, Suzhou, Anxi, Xingxingxia, Hami, Turpan, Yanqi, Kucha, and Wensu, and meet with the team coming west from Hald at Shufu. The return journey will be from Shufu via Turpan, Dihua, Guchengzi (Qitai), Hami, Xingxingxia, Anxi, Fuzhou, Wangye Mansion (Anyuanying), Ningxia, Ordos, Baotou, Baza Temple, Zhangjiakou to Beiping. Bu An delivered the list of French team members as opened by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs passport to the Ancient Relics Preservation Committee this morning, including the leader Bu An, mechanical chief engineer Fei Wenming, geologist Sha Ding, doctor Trasertell, photographer Shi Beheto, natural scientist Lemeng, chief mechanic Bi Na, mechanic and driver, a total of eleven people totaling eighteen people. The team from Xinjiang includes French team leader Hald, Chinese team leader Du Bofu, writer Li Baner, photographer Shawaqi, doctor Adan, and seven mechanics, for a total of twelve people. The Ancient Relics Preservation Committee and the Beiping Branch will hold a joint meeting at Tuancheng at 4:00 pm tomorrow (the 15th) to report on the negotiations with the French yesterday, discuss changing the name of the 19 Academic Expedition, and review the list of French team members, which are all just procedural issues. The Chinese and French teams have already prepared and are waiting for the vehicles to be repaired before starting their long journey. (April 14)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Students Petition the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>No Results Due to Chairman Zhang's Absence</p>
<p>Students from the three colleges of liberal arts, science, engineering, and agriculture at Zhejiang University petitioned the provincial government on the afternoon of the 14th because the university's funds had been in arrears for a long time. Although the Ministry of Finance had clearly ordered that 30,000 yuan be allocated from the treasury starting in March, the amount was insufficient, and the provincial government allocated funds from the provincial business tax revenue, which was completely local tax revenue, to compensate for the loss of the textile tax, which was far from enough. They still consulted the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. Fifty to sixty students from the three colleges gathered at the provincial government at 3:00 pm on the 14th to petition, but were blocked by the gatekeepers. They then sent Li Hesheng and Hu Wushi, representatives of the engineering college; Bian Yimu and Yang Zhifu, representatives of the agricultural college; and Lu Jingmo and Yu Yanti, representatives of the liberal arts college, to request a meeting with the chairman. Lu Yunchen, a staff member of the Secretariat, came out to meet them and said that the chairman was away on official business. Zhejiang University's funds should be allocated by the central government, and the province was unable to bear the burden. He had telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to ask for instructions. The secretary-general was ill and unable to come out to meet them, which he regretted. They dispersed around 5:00 pm without getting the information they needed. It is said that the petitioning students temporarily decided to hold a plenary meeting that evening to discuss further measures.</p>

<h3>Furen Loses to Fudan in Yesterday's Football Match on Jiangwan Road</h3>
<p>Result: One to Two</p>
<p>Entire Team Left Shanghai for Beiping This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday, the football team of Peiping Fu Jen University played against Fudan University at Jiangwan. In the first half, the two teams were evenly matched, with each team scoring one goal. In the second half, the "wind aunt" (wind spirit) arrived, causing mischief. As a result, the home team gained momentum and the visiting team suffered. Furen lost with a final score of one to two. It was indeed a case of "not a fault of battle, but an act of Heaven." The referee was Wu Yanzhang.</p>
<h3>Farewell, Furen! Cherish the Future!</h3>
<p>Furen's visit was originally for the purpose of observation and mutual learning. The outcome of winning or losing was secondary. Victory is certainly pleasing, but defeat is also honorable. In Shanghai, they fought four matches, losing three and drawing one. However, in our view, the level of football in Peiping is far below that of Shanghai, and Furen is not what we are accustomed to hearing about. Yet, they were able to compete against the strong teams. Their defeat or draw is regrettable. Therefore, Furen's skill is far beyond our expectations or imagination. The team will leave Shanghai early on the 18th to return to Peiping. We all know that the experience gained from defeat is dozens of times more beneficial than victory. Furen came to seek experience, so team leader Wang Shiqing should return satisfied and pleased. Farewell, Furen! Cherish the future! We hope to meet again.</p>
<h3>One Gain, One Loss, Tit for Tat</h3>
<p>The great battle began at half past three. Furen's army still had a fierce and energetic spirit. Within five minutes, they forced a corner kick. Ye Deyu kicked the ball to a good spot right in front of the goal, and center forward Li Hongye rushed into the net, opening the scoring. At that time, the ball was extremely fast. Fudan counterattacked, and the right back passed the ball to Yu Shunzhang, who headed it. Gu Songling caught it with both hands. Soon after, the ball was passed from the right, missed the inner guard, and went towards the left. The goalkeeper was about to rush forward to save it when Fudan's Yi Yixun arrived first and shot the ball into the goal. This was five minutes after the goal they had conceded. Five minutes later, Fudan was in luck again. Furen's Zhang Zizhen headed the ball, but it was blocked by the goalpost. Twelve minutes later, Furen was penalized with a free kick outside the penalty area. The ball hit the back of the defender's head and almost went into the net, but fortunately, the goalkeeper caught it. In the blink of an eye, Furen's Ye Deyu kicked a ball towards the center, but the forwards missed the opportunity one by one, otherwise, Fudan would have been in trouble.</p>
<h3>Wind Spirit Causes Trouble, Visiting Team Suffers</h3>
<p>After changing sides, the "wind aunt" suddenly arrived. As a result, Fudan had the advantages of location and people, and also the help of Heaven. The strong wind carried sand, blowing directly towards Furen. The ball lost its freedom in the air and was completely controlled by the wind. Fudan was in high spirits and bravely surrounded the goal, hovering around it for the first ten minutes. Furen did not make a sound, but when they did, it was astonishing. The right wing took to the air, creating a dangerous situation. They then won a corner kick, and were also awarded a free kick outside the penalty area. One after another, the defenders firmly resisted and the attackers were unable to do anything. As a result, the defenders counterattacked and the attackers became defenders. However, Furen's defense was also strict and formidable. Again and again, until the 25th minute, a ball was passed from the right wing by He Jitang. Zhou Shaowen flicked it, and Huang Dingcai lifted it with one kick from the left wing, sending it into the goal, making it two to one in favor of Fudan. After this, Fudan attacked more than they defended. In the last five minutes, Furen shouted and the whole army rose up, and Fudan's territory was repeatedly ravaged. The army was at the gates three or four times, but failed to break through. It was Fudan's luck, and Furen's misfortune. The silver whistle blew again, and the fierce battle ended. Furen suffered a narrow defeat with a score of one to two.</p>

<h3>Hosting Election Supervisors</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun, supervisor of the Shanghai Election Office for National Assembly Representatives, hosted the election supervisors at the Chamber of Commerce meeting room at 3 PM yesterday. Supervisor Zhang gave a detailed report, and Chief Secretary Fan Zhengbo attended to explain everything. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's Speech: The significance and mission of the National Assembly and the laws and regulations regarding the election of representatives have been clearly stated by the Central Government. The Election Office has also compiled and distributed various publications such as the Election Law, Election Instructions, and the Key Points to Know About the National Assembly to various groups so that they can understand them. There is no need to repeat them. Now, I will briefly describe the progress of the preparatory election work in Shanghai and the matters that various groups and election supervisors should pay attention to when handling the election work.</p>
<p>Progress of Preparations: (A) The progress of the preparatory election in Shanghai: (1) The establishment and organization of the Election Office and the start of work was in late February. After appointing the chief secretary, secretaries, and chiefs of the general affairs, review, and guidance groups, the Election Office actively prepared, tentatively determined the address, transferred personnel, and formulated methods, procedures, and a work schedule. The Election Office officially began work on March 2nd. (2) Guiding various groups to report their registration books. The registration books that various groups should report were previously stipulated as (1) Organization Report Form, (2) Staff Biographical Table, (3) Membership List, (4) University Faculty List, (5) University Undergraduate Student List. The Election Office printed these forms and stipulated that March 6th, 7th, and 8th would be the deadline for groups to receive the registration books and report them. At the time, the business associations, universities, and free professional groups were the first to receive and report the registration books, while the labor unions were still being reorganized, and the farmers' associations and education associations were still being established. They requested to extend the deadline for reporting, so the Election Office extended the deadline and sent the registration books separately to facilitate the work. (3) Reviewing the registration books reported by various groups. The Election Office reviewed the registration books submitted by various groups one after another. After determining the voters, the Election Office continued to create voter registration books, printed the voter list, and announced it. The Postal Workers' Union among the labor unions has not been reorganized in accordance with the law. After the Central Government decided that it could not participate in the election, it was revoked. (4) Preparing to handle the election matters of various groups. Since the election of various groups has been reviewed and announced, the election should be handled immediately. The Election Office appointed election supervisors and voting managers for each group, and stipulated the voting dates for each group. It was stipulated that the 17th would be the voting date for the labor unions in the South Shanghai District, Special District, and Yinxiang District, the 18th would be the voting date for the labor unions in the Zhabei District, Fahua District, and Pudong District, the 19th would be the voting date for the farmers' associations and education associations in various districts, and the 20th would be the voting date for the business associations, universities, and free professional groups. The voting locations were generally held at the locations of the various groups, but some industrial labor unions were held at the factories where their voters work. The Election Office informed the factories through the Social Bureau. In addition, since most of the voters in the farmers' and workers' associations were illiterate, they were instructed to recommend ballot writers to be approved by the Election Office to be responsible for writing ballots.</p>
<p>Supervisory Notes: (B) Matters that various groups and election supervisors should pay attention to when handling the election work. (1) The election method of each group. In addition to the business association's election, which is based on the election of member representatives of the same industry association and store members attending the Municipal Business Association, the labor unions have no vertical top organization, and the election is based on a general election of members of the Municipal Labor Union. The farmers' and education associations have also not established a municipal organization, so the original method was also revised to hold a general election for all members of the municipal farmers' and education associations. In short, all voters whose names have been reported and who have passed the review can participate in the election. (2) The powers of the election supervisors of each group. The election supervisors of each group are appointed in accordance with Article 10 of the Election Law and are qualified representatives of the group. They are responsible for handling everything and should be able to fulfill their duties. The number of supervisors is at least one for each group. For groups with a large number of voters or multiple voting locations, the number of election supervisors is also increased accordingly. The Election Office has printed a "Supervisor's Guide," which should be noted regarding the powers of the election supervisors. (3) The time for each group to hold voting. The election time for each group is set to complete the voting and count the ballots immediately for the convenience of handling. It is generally set to start voting at 8 AM and end at 4 PM to avoid crowding. If there are special circumstances, such as difficulty in gathering people or other situations, changes can be made, but they must be reported in advance for record. It would be great if each group could convene voters to hold a meeting and make the voting and counting time more efficient and the order more orderly. Those who cannot form a meeting can have voters vote continuously. (4) The layout of the election location of each group. The election location of each group, except for some industrial labor unions that are designated as the factories where they work, is generally held at the location of the group. For those who vote in factories, the layout of the voting location can be handled according to the situation. For those who vote at the location of the group, in addition to hanging the party and national flags, at least a rostrum should be set up to place the ballot box, and a record seat, a ballot writing seat, and several long tables should be set up. In addition, a sign-in book should be placed for voters to sign in. (5) Assistant personnel at the election location. In addition to the election supervisors and vote counting managers assigned by the Election Office to be responsible at the location, each group should also appoint two recorders to be responsible for the meeting records and four marshals to be responsible for managing sign-in, checking admission certificates, and assisting in maintaining order at the meeting. The ballot writers of the farmers' and workers' associations have been designated by the Election Office. (6) Maintaining order at the election location. The order at the election location is very important for handling the voting and counting of ballots. In addition to the vote counting managers being responsible for maintaining order, the election supervisors and marshals must pay close attention to facilitate the process. Each group should also urge its members in advance to abide by the order. The above is only a brief description of the preparatory work of the Election Office and the precautions for the election of election supervisors. It is hoped that all progress will be smooth during the voting period of each group. There are many other points to pay attention to, which can be referred to in the "Election Supervisor's Guide" and the "Instructions for Various Groups on Handling the National Assembly Representative Election."</p>

<p>Nearly 30 Applicants</p>
<p>Engaged Experts to Judge</p>
<p>The location of the new municipal government in the city center has been decided, and the groundbreaking ceremony will be held on July 7th this year. The commercial and residential districts will also be built in phases according to the needs of the times. The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that the new urban district is related to the appearance of China and foreign countries. The standards and models of its construction depend on careful and precise design and proper arrangement to ensure that there are good standards in terms of construction. Therefore, the Bureau specially sought standard designs for rental housing in the commercial and residential areas of the city center and set the day before (the 15th) as the deadline for submission. However, architects from other places have still been sending in designs recently. As of yesterday, there were nearly 30 applicants for this design. The Bureau immediately hired experts from the Shanghai Engineering Society, Shanghai Architectural Society, Shanghai Architectural Society, etc., to form a review committee to conduct the review in accordance with the original plan. After the review is completed, the results will be announced and prizes will be awarded by the Shanghai Daily. The prize regulations are: first place, 1,000 yuan; second place, 500 yuan; third place, 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Hosts a Banquet for the Japanese Business and Industry Delegation</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai Delivers an Earnest Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet last night at 7:00 PM for the delegation from the Japanese Tokai Chamber of Commerce and Industry Federation.  The delegation, including its leader Mr. Ito, consisted of over thirty people.  Guests in attendance included Japanese Vice Consul Shirai, Vice Consul Hasegawa, Commercial Officer Yokotake, Mayor Zhang Qun, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai Tang Liu, Wu Huanru of the Social Affairs Bureau, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yiting, Pan Zengyin, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Xu Jilu, Zheng Chengqing, and others, totaling sixteen individuals.  Chairman Wang Xiaolai has recorded the details of the exchange between the hosts and guests as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: Gentlemen of the Tokai Chamber of Commerce and Industry Federation, following the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, you have organized a delegation for commercial inspection of China.  Within a span of ten days, you have successively arrived in our country, and your esteemed presence in Shanghai is a grand occasion unprecedented in the past.  Furthermore, the organization of this delegation includes as many as sixteen chambers of commerce and industry.  Our chamber is seizing this opportune moment to meet and converse with representatives of numerous business and industry sectors from your country, expressing our accumulated sentiments with sincere hearts.  We are overjoyed beyond measure.  However, due to the inadequacy of our hospitality in all respects, we feel a sense of unease in our hearts as hosts.  Fortunately, you gentlemen, as esteemed guests and close neighbors, will surely overlook formalities and understand.  Although the composition of this delegation is not as focused on industry as that of Osaka, cities such as Shizuoka, a renowned tea-producing area, and Kofu, a famous hub for habutae (silk crepe), hold a significant position in your country's export trade.  Moreover, the destinations planned for inspection, such as Qingdao and Shanghai, are also flourishing areas of industry and commerce in our country, and they have a deep connection with the trade between our two nations.  The mission you gentlemen are undertaking differs from ordinary tourism solely for sightseeing.  Naturally, one of your inspection aims is to strive for economic cooperation between China and Japan.  During the banquet for the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry delegation, our chamber presented the "Key to Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation" to the gentlemen of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, outlining the key points as follows: (1) Mutual, unrestricted, and free movement of people between the two countries. (2) Prompt conclusion of a new and equal commercial treaty, including the abolition of consular jurisdiction and the return of concessions. (3) Enactment of reciprocal tariffs with equal rights in substance, correcting the nominal but not real reciprocity of tariffs. The reason for reiterating these issues to you gentlemen is that the true meaning of economic cooperation lies in standing on an equal footing with each other. If it stems from unilateral monopoly, it constitutes economic aggression rather than economic cooperation. The standards are clearly impossible to reconcile. However, while the gentlemen of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry expressed sympathy for our chamber's proposals, stating that their visit aimed at permanent friendship between the two countries rather than merely increasing trade with China, they also suggested that the issues raised by our chamber should be resolved through diplomatic channels and asserted that the existing situation constitutes established rights. Judging from their intentions, there seem to be two points: first, that businessmen do not discuss politics; and second, that existing facts need not be discussed. Our chamber fears that these views are not unique to the gentlemen of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Therefore, our chamber believes that the lingering mistrust in the minds of the people of both countries stems from such views. Taking advantage of this gathering of representatives from the business communities of both countries, it is urgently necessary to address these misunderstandings. Firstly, the trend of modern commerce and industry is inherently linked to politics and cannot be independent of it. Furthermore, in constitutional states, public opinion influences policy, which is a common practice in modern times. If your country seeks permanent friendship between the two countries, it should naturally involve mutual efforts by the people of both countries, rather than solely entrusting it to the government. Secondly, if our two countries wish to transform the environment and establish a new relationship, making our commercial ties increasingly closer, then the situations created in the past can only be regarded as rigid relics unsuitable for the times. If you insist on upholding your acquired rights, then your country's past revision of treaties with Europe and America would have been impossible. Considering others as oneself is a virtue of the East, and your country is particularly rich in benevolence and chivalry, so this point is even less of a problem. Some even argue that today's gathering is a friendly meal and should not discuss any issues that might offend your ears. Our chamber believes that this view is also inaccurate. Besides seeking to increase trade with China, your mission is also to seek permanent friendship between the two countries. Your task is largely the same as that of the gentlemen of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry. What our chamber has presented is the necessary path to permanent friendship between the two countries. Therefore, our chamber's purpose can be said to be entirely aligned with yours. If we can thereby open a path to permanent friendship, avoiding any unforeseen obstacles along the way, then today's gathering should leave a monumental mark on the history of trade between the two countries, with a significance even deeper than that of a mere friendly meal. Therefore, without fear of being bothersome, I will reiterate the gist of what I did not fully express to the gentlemen of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry the other day, hoping that you gentlemen can change your mindset and work together to create public opinion in your country to influence your country's policies. Then the long-cherished aspiration of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation will not be difficult to realize. I respectfully toast to the efforts of you gentlemen.</p>
<p>Mr. Ito's Response: Our delegation's organization of this inspection tour to your country stems from our longstanding admiration for your country. Since arriving in your country, we have experienced warm hospitality from local people in various places such as Suzhou and Hangzhou. We are unspeakably delighted. Since arriving in Shanghai, we have been honored by Mayor Zhang's banquet yesterday and the reception from your chamber today. It is an extreme honor to have repeatedly conversed with Mayor Zhang and Mr. Yu Qiaqing. I am grateful for Chairman Wang's teachings, but Chairman Wang believes that our delegation's nature is similar to that of the Osaka business delegation. You may not know that our delegation is slightly different from the Osaka delegation. Our delegation is composed of eighteen chambers of commerce (Nagoya and the Tokai region). These eighteen chambers of commerce are located in the middle of Osaka and Tokyo. Their strength is not as great as that of Osaka and Tokyo. Therefore, in the past, commercial interactions between our country and your country have mainly been in Osaka. Even the products from the Nagoya area must be transferred to your country through the Osaka Chamber of Commerce, so there has not been a full development of commercial ties with Nagoya. As for the situation in Nagoya, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, who is present today, has also been there. The terrain and products are very superior, and after several years of reform, the market and population are more prosperous. Therefore, our delegation's purpose is to hope that in the future, your country can trade directly with Nagoya without going through Osaka merchants. On the other hand, we also hope that your country can organize commercial groups in the Nagoya area similar to those in Osaka to engage in business in Nagoya. All of this is what the people of Nagoya most desire. I also heard Chairman Wang say that your country is also planning to organize an observation group to our country. This is particularly welcome to our delegation. We hope that you can first come to Nagoya so that we can organize a grand welcome meeting to exchange opinions with each other. As for the points raised by Chairman Wang regarding Sino-Japanese international issues, we will publicize them after returning to our country. We believe that they can be gradually resolved through long-term consultation in the future. Finally, Mr. Yu Qiaqing also gave a speech, which will be omitted for brevity.</p>

<h3>Three Reports on the Sinking of the Dachang Steamer</h3>
<p>Two reports have already been published in this newspaper about the sinking of the Dachang steamer outside the Wusong estuary after being struck by the Ping An Company's Dahua steamer. Here are the latest updates from yesterday:</p>
<p>Negotiations Underway: After the Dahua steamer of the Dahua Company struck and sank the Dachang steamer, due to insurance matters, the crew gathered to report and notify the underwriting Huaan Company. They also sent letters to the Customs Ship Management Office and the Shipping Association, and took photographs of the damage to the Dahua steamer at the Nanshi Wharf to be used in negotiations. These procedures are currently being carried out.</p>
<p>One Body Recovered: Among the seven crew members of the Dachang steamer who went missing when it sank the night before, the body of carpenter Chen Pigen was recovered by the Wusong Lifesaving Bureau near the accident site on the afternoon of the previous day. The company was notified that evening and informed his family yesterday morning. His wife, Madam Yan, was given 120 yuan to go to Wusong to collect the body. The whereabouts of the comprador San Gui and the other six remain unknown.</p>
<p>Crew Report: The Taigu Company's Hanyang steamer, coming from Hong Kong to Shanghai, rescued eight crew members of the Dachang steamer who had fallen into the water when passing the site of the accident yesterday morning (the 14th): Chief Officer He Shengcai, Second Officer Cai Xingyi, Stokers He Fuyuan, He Sanxiong, Yue Jin, Qing Rong, and a helmsman. They have reported to the company. These are the eight out of the 64 survivors mentioned in yesterday's report.</p>
<p>Post-Accident Arrangements: Of the 64 crew members of the Dachang steamer, 57 have arrived in Shanghai, excluding those who fell into the water and went missing. Among them, about 30 people, including the captain, first and second officers, and sailors, will be cared for by the company. A plan has been drafted to allow those other than the captain, first officer, second officer, chief officer, second officer, watch officer, and helmsman to return to their hometowns after receiving one and a half months' back pay, pending a resolution. The company will compensate all crew members for their losses in accordance with the regulations of the Shipping Association. The crew members and passengers under the comprador's responsibility will be handled by the comprador and the charterer.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Compensation Negotiations: At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a passenger went to the Dahua Company and stated that he, his mother (over 60 years old), and a relative (over 40 years old) had been passengers on the Dachang steamer to Shanghai. When the steamer sank, his mother fell into the coal bunker and died. He and his relative fell into the water at the same time. He was rescued by the Dahua steamer, but he believes that his relative drowned. He demanded compensation. The company's employee, Mr. Yao, refused and told him that the passengers' losses should be handled by the comprador and were not the company's responsibility. The passenger then left.</p>
<p>No More Salvage: The British-owned old shipyard in this port is a well-known shipbuilding factory and also undertakes salvage work. After the Dachang steamer sank, the shipyard sent people to the Huaan Insurance Company yesterday to discuss salvage matters. Huaan did not agree because the steamer was old and salvage would not be cost-effective. It is expected that the customs will destroy it with explosives in the future.</p>
<p>Setting Up Markers: The location where the Dachang steamer sank is a key passage for commercial ships entering and exiting the Wusong estuary, which is inconvenient for navigation. In light of this, the customs sent a ship to the accident site yesterday to set up markers to allow incoming and outgoing commercial ships to see them and avoid danger. The Dachang steamer was hit on the port side. We mistakenly said the starboard side yesterday and hereby correct it.</p>
<h3>Taibao Ashu and His Brother Were Executed in Zhangyan Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Two Bandits, Xiong Du, Were Calm and Not Afraid of Death</p>
<p>Beheading Executions Carried Out Successively at 4:10 PM</p>
<p>Zhu Luo Amei Will Be Executed Today</p>
<p>Taibao Ashu Xu Tianxiong and his younger brother Xu Fusheng, leaders of the Dahupu Donggang bandit gang, who had committed numerous robberies in the border counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, including Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, Fengxian, and Wujiang, were executed by beheading at Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County, yesterday afternoon at 4:10 PM. The execution of the major criminals brought joy to the people. This newspaper's reporter accompanied personnel from the Minhang Jiangsu Water Police First District to Zhangyan Town yesterday morning to witness the execution. Here are the detailed circumstances of the execution:</p>
<p>Escorted Early in the Morning: Taibao Ashu and his younger brother Xu Fusheng were arrested in Shanghai and immediately transferred to the Minhang Water Police First District Station. Because they had confessed during successive interrogations, they were treated quite well with regard to their food and lodging. Director Xu Pucheng personally made careful arrangements in advance for the execution order at Zhangyan, and transferred the Fuyan and Jinghu warships to anchor in Minhang to prepare for water transport. At 6:40 AM yesterday morning, Xu Fusheng was brought out first and escorted to the dock by more than ten armed Wooden-shelled rifle team members. The Jinghu warship was anchored inside the dock, and the Fuyan was anchored outside the dock. Xu Fusheng, in handcuffs and shackles, passed through the Jinghu and boarded the Fuyan, where he was escorted into the lower cabin and settled down. At 7:00 AM sharp, Taibao Ashu was also escorted onto the Fuyan. The area near the dock was crowded with onlookers. The Xu brothers were dressed in the clothes they were wearing when they were captured, and their expressions were calm. Taibao Ashu even frequently smiled and nodded to the detectives he knew well.</p>
<p>Heavy Guard: At 7:15 AM, with a whistle sound, the warships sailed in formation straight to Zhangyan. Xu Pucheng, along with the Inspector General of the station, Luo Daokun, and the Guard Captain Wang Shenqing, led dozens of Wooden-shelled rifle team members and armed guerrillas, totaling about a company, on the Fuyan, which was leading and towing three water police patrol boats led by Team Captain Fan Zhicheng. The Jinghu warship brought up the rear. Xu Pucheng and his friends traveled in a steamboat following behind. Wei Zhiren, the superintendent of the French Concession Engineering Bureau, also traveled in a small steamboat. Along the way, there were armed water police stationed at Songyin and other places on guard.</p>
<p>Yearning for His Son: While Taibao Ashu was in the Minhang Water Police Station prison, he knew that he could not escape his fate. He repeatedly told the people in the station that he would be dealt with sooner or later. He was comforted by the fact that he had turned from a political prisoner to a bandit, and if he had someone above him, he could arrange for a life sentence. Taibao remained silent. He also longed to meet with his younger brother but was not allowed. He repeatedly said that his younger brother might be spared the death penalty. When he first entered the prison, the station provided him with several yuan worth of opium every day. From the day before yesterday, Taibao Ashu voluntarily stopped eating it and never tasted it again. The morning before yesterday, he suddenly told people that he vaguely heard the crying of children nearby, and he suspected that his son had been arrested. He was told that his wife and children would definitely not be implicated, but he still did not quite believe it. When he was brought out yesterday morning, Taibao asked where he was going. He was told that he was going to Jinshan, and he said, "Is it to be dealt with?"</p>
<p>Words of Repentance: After the ship set sail, the Taibao brothers talked happily, but not a single word was private. This newspaper's reporter talked to them in the lower cabin. They were talkative and showed no fatigue or fear. Xiong Du was given paper and pen to write something. After a little thought, he wrote several sentences in his own handwriting, the original text is as follows: "For the sake of our overall situation, we have done many things over the past three years to this day, harming many people. We are sorry for them. We should be dealt with." The tone of the above text is mostly repentant, which can be said to be a realization of conscience.</p>
<p>Reciting Haiku Poetry: He then recited a seven-character haiku poem, the original sentence is: "Tianxiong leaves prison and sees the clear sky, with handcuffs and shackles, he moves step by step. Soldiers come to send me off, walking step by step to the ship. Arriving at the ship to watch, my lover arrives here. Arriving at the execution ground to give a speech, it will be dealt with and resolved to the underworld."</p>
<p>Taibao's Conversation: When this newspaper's reporter talked to him (asked) do you usually like to read newspapers (answered) I don't read them often, sometimes I read the National Daily (seems to be a mistake for the Republican Daily) (asked) how many subordinates did you have at the peak, and how was the organization?</p>
<h3>Photograph of Taibao Ashu and His Brother Xu Tianxiong and Xu Fusheng at the Time of Execution (Taken by This Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Order Given to Execute the Bandit Leaders by Shooting</p>
<p>(Answered) The organization was quite complete. At the peak, there were more than 2,000 people, but in reality, only 700 or 800 people were willing to die for me. (Asked) Is it true that you have accumulated a lot of wealth over the years? (Answered) Rumors say that I have hundreds of thousands of dollars, but in fact, I don't have a single cent. Our lives depend entirely on loyalty, and money has long been set aside. Otherwise, how could the brothers listen to me? If I were greedy for money, I would have failed long ago and would not have waited until today. (Asked) What are your thoughts now? (Answered) I have done many evil things and deserve to die. I have long given up the idea of living. What I am most concerned about is that I have no way to repay the people I have harmed. Secondly, I am worried about how my old mother and young children will live.</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of People Watched: At around 10:00 AM, because the lower cabin was hot, the Taibao brothers asked to sit on the deck for a while, which was granted. Then they had lunch. Taibao finished three servings, and his brother ate three bowls. They smoked and drank tea without any sorrow. Yesterday, because the water was shallow, the ship traveled slowly, and it was delayed until 1:30 PM before arriving at Zhangyan Town. At that time, both banks</p>
<h3>Zhu Luo Amei Wang Qiming (Taken by This Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Order Given to Execute the Bandit Leaders by Shooting</p>
<p>were crowded with tens of thousands of people. Armed soldiers lined up in a row, and the situation was extremely serious.</p>
<p>Final Interrogation: After Taibao Ashu and others landed, they were escorted to the headquarters of the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Province Security Infantry, where they met with the criminals who had been captured in the bandit areas. Taibao's father-in-law, Gu Along, and mother-in-law were also there. They looked at each other without saying a word. Zhu Luo Amei Wang Qiming, the commander of Taibao Ashu's regiment and the deputy commander of the Songhu Pacification Zone, was also escorted from Song by Commander Cao Pang at 6:00 AM yesterday morning to Yan and detained in the regimental headquarters building. At 3:00 PM, the final interrogation was conducted in the regimental headquarters hall, presided over by Commander Cao, with Pinghu County Magistrate Wu Wenzhong, Jinshan County Magistrate, and Xu Pucheng as judges. Taibao Ashu was brought up first and confessed everything one by one without denial. Finally, when asked if he had any last words, Ashu replied, "I have harmed many people, and I am really sorry. Many of the criminals who are meeting me today are not related to me. Please release them quickly to alleviate my sins." He then reported the names of three people who had been wrongly accused. Commander Cao, the presiding judge, threw down a white flag of crime, which said, "Order to Execute the Bandit Leader Xu Tianxiong." He ordered the prisoner to be tied up. Xu Fusheng was then interrogated and admitted everything in the same way. He was also ordered to be tied up. Finally, Zhu Luo Amei Wang Qiming was brought up and ordered to recognize the Taibao brothers. He was asked, "Do you recognize them?" He replied, "Yes, they are Xu Tianxiong and Xu Fusheng," and clasped his fists and bowed to the Taibao brothers, repeatedly saying, "I will see you again soon, brothers." His attitude was even more relaxed. Before long, Amei was escorted back, and the Taibao brothers were escorted to the execution ground.</p>
<p>Beheading and Public Display: The Taibao brothers were led by armed soldiers for a parade through the streets, and then to the execution ground. The executioner, Wang Fusheng, had already had the Taibao brothers kneel back to back in place. As the knife flashed, their heads fell to the ground. It was exactly 4:10 PM. When the Taibao brothers were executed, their expressions remained unchanged, and they looked around with their eyes. They can be said to have been fearless in the face of death. After the execution, their heads were placed in wooden cages and hung up for public display. The blood stains were blurred, and women covered their eyes.</p>
<p>Amei to be Executed Today: Yesterday, Zhu Luo Amei Wang Qiming heard that the Taibao brothers had been brought to the regimental headquarters and thought that he would be executed at the same time. He asked for a bottle of sorghum wine from those around him and declared, "I am just a villager. It is enough for me to be noticed by others. What else can I ask for?" His ferocity can be seen. It was decided yesterday that Amei would be escorted from Zhangyan to Xinshi Town, Pinghu County, Zhejiang, at 10:00 AM this morning to be executed. District Chief Xu Pucheng and Inspector Luo remained in Zhangyan yesterday to wait for Amei's execution before returning to Minhang. The rest, such as Zheng Jialin, the consultant of the First District of the Water Police, and the inspectors, returned to Shanghai last night.</p>
<h3>The Stevedore Strike Makes it Difficult for Western and Japanese Freight to Resume</h3>
<p>The Association Submitted a Request to the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday for Mediation</p>
<p>The stevedore strike in this city has been going on for more than ten days. Except for the resumption of cotton yarn freight, cotton cloth is still on strike. The customs brokerage industry notified that Western and Japanese freight would be resumed on the 17th, but all the workers expressed their opposition. Yesterday, the customs brokerage association held a meeting and requested the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate again and requested assistance from various gangs. Here are the details of each situation:</p>
<p>Union General Meeting: The Stevedore Union convened a general meeting of all gang leaders at 9:00 AM yesterday, with more than 150 gang leaders in attendance. Chairman Ren Xinxiang recorded Su Houxin. The chairman reported on the strike process and the contents of the employer's notification on the 15th. Then, Li Houfu's motion on the resumption of Western and Japanese freight was discussed and put to a vote. All the gang leaders unanimously advocated that if the employers forced the resumption, they would immediately strike, regardless of Western cloth, groceries, or cotton yarn, and at the same time submit requirements to the employers. Then, a number of important issues, such as the price of transportation, were discussed and resolved.</p>
<p>Association Meeting: The Customs Brokerage Association held a temporary committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday, with 15 committee members, including Shi Zhikun, Zhu Xiechen, and You Senting, in attendance. Chairman Shi Zhikun decided that the previous resolution to resume Western and Japanese freight brokerage on the 17th was difficult to implement after the Stevedore Union made a statement. The association was inconvenient to insist on it. In addition to sending letters to the business gang association and the Shandong, Sanshan, and Shunzhi Guilds to seek opinions, it will wait for the reply and then jointly petition the Social Affairs Bureau with the Cotton Cloth Association for mediation to avoid escalating the strike.</p>
<p>Notice to the Industry: The Customs Brokerage Association issued a notice to the industry yesterday, stating: "In order to notify you of a matter, the Executive Committee decided at a temporary meeting today that the Stevedore Union's representative stated at the meeting that it was difficult to approve the resumption of Western and Japanese freight brokerage from the 17th, and that forcing it would cause further problems. Therefore, it was decided to send letters to the Shandong, Sanshan, and Shunzhi Guilds and the business gang association to seek opinions. After receiving a reply, we will jointly petition the Social Affairs Bureau with the Cotton Cloth Association for mediation. During this transitional period, the notification of the resolution on the 17th should be temporarily suspended. This is to inform you."</p>
<p>Request for Mediation: The Customs Brokerage Association submitted a request to the Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting that another mediation be convened. The letter states: "Director Gongzhan, greetings. The stevedores' strike was caused by the suppression of rickshaw pullers in the cotton cloth industry. We respectfully request your mediation, but it has not been resolved. The persistence of this situation is extremely worrying. Recently, we have received letters from the Shunzhi, Shandong, and Sanshan Guilds and the business gang association, stating that this strike has a significant impact on various industries, and it is not sustainable. The consequences of not resolving it will be dire. We can only continue to petition the Social Affairs Bureau to try to mediate again to resolve the situation and maintain commercial transport. Therefore, we urgently request that your bureau convene the Cotton Cloth Association, the Stevedore Union, and our representatives again tomorrow afternoon to try to mediate and avoid escalating the strike. This is a public convenience."</p>
<p>Letter to Various Business Gangs: The Customs Brokerage Association sent a letter to the Shunzhi, Sanshan, Shandong Guilds, and the business gang association, requesting assistance. The letter states: "Greetings. Since the workers in our industry went on strike due to the suppression of rickshaw pullers in the cotton cloth industry (omitted). Currently, except for a portion of the cotton yarn that has resumed work, the cotton cloth industry is still on strike. If this continues, we are deeply concerned that it will spread and cause great harm to all parties. The various businesses under your guild have a relationship with this matter and should not ignore it. Therefore, we respectfully send this letter to seek your assistance. We would like to know where the rickshaw pullers are collecting the money and whether it is appropriate, and we hope that you will discuss it and reply to us."</p>

<h3>Tenants of the Jiahe Li on Hart Road Refuse Rent Increase</h3>
<p>Tenants' General Meeting Resolutions</p>
<p>The houses in the Jiahe Li area of Hart Road are the property of the Chinese Zhu Xixian Hall, managed by the foreign lawyer Cook. The residents of this area are all laborers. Recently, the landlord, through lawyer Cook, issued a notice stating that starting May 1st, rents within the alley will be increased by 30% or more, and storefront rents by 50% or more. The tenants of this area find this huge rent increase impossible to accept and have already organized a Tenants' Association to earnestly petition the landlord to withdraw the decision, listing reasons why the rent cannot be increased. However, the landlord's attitude is firm. The tenants of this area convened a general meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Reject the unreasonable rent increase because the tenants in the alley are laborers and cannot afford such a large increase. If a satisfactory solution cannot be reached, lawyers will be hired to petition the court and the Social Affairs Bureau for relief. (2) If the landlord refuses to accept the original rent by the end of May, two representatives will be elected to collect the rent money and deposit it in a bank. (3) Nineteen tenants from the alley will be elected to handle negotiations until the goal of no rent increase is achieved. (4) If, as the landlord says, they are forced to move, the landlord should compensate the tenants twice the deposit, as is customary in Shanghai, and also cover all losses for decoration and moving. The tenants present were filled with indignation and unanimously insisted that they would not stop until their goal was achieved.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Exhibition Seeks National Products</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou National Products Mobile Exhibition, organized by the Hangzhou National Products Factory Association, is scheduled to open on April 25th. The scale is grand and comparable to last year's National Exhibition, and efforts to solicit domestic products are being spared. Since the association's standing committee members Chen Guohua and Ma Shijie visited Shanghai last time to solicit participation from various factories, the response has been enthusiastic. To further expand the collection, Committee Member Chen Guohua has come to Shanghai again. Participants include brands like Sheng Bo Lai Toys, Wei Yi Dried Vegetables and Bamboo Shoots, Tian Chu Monosodium Glutamate, and Xiang Da Fire Extinguisher Dragon. Furthermore, Chen Guohua has long heard that Ling Yongde, owner of Yi He Yuan Sauce Manufacturing Factory at the intersection of Huade Road and Huasheng Road in this city, invented Shuang Zhe brand almond brandy (also known as almond brandy), which sells well both domestically and internationally and is a top-quality domestic wine. Yesterday, he made a special visit to the factory, where he was led by Mr. Ling to tour various departments. Mr. Chen believes that the results are excellent and comparable to imported brandy. Moreover, the price is only 50 cents per large bottle and 25 cents per second-size bottle, which is particularly commendable. He immediately acquired the factory's products to be transported to the Hangzhou exhibition.</p>
<h3>Candle Industry Association Continues to Discuss Price Increase</h3>
<p>To be Implemented Starting the 18th</p>
<p>Recently, raw materials for candle making such as asphalt and white wax have repeatedly soared in price. Candle shops in this city have been selling at the previously agreed prices, resulting in excessive losses. They have repeatedly requested the Candle Industry Association to convene a meeting to discuss a price increase to maintain their capital. The association held a full meeting yesterday, with 38 members in attendance, chaired by Li Meisheng. The following motions were discussed: (1) Motion: Since asphalt wax is gradually increasing in price, should candle prices be raised accordingly? Resolution: Starting from the 18th of this month, retail prices will be 52 cents per jin, and wholesale prices will be 44 yuan per dan. All members must comply and implement this, and an announcement will be published in the newspaper to ensure seriousness. (2) Motion: How should lamp candle prices be raised? Resolution: The previous 2, 4, 6, and 8 candles will be changed to 3, 5, 7, and 9 candles. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Capital Group to Purchase Majestic Hotel</h3>
<p>Li Ming Discusses Disposal Methods</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that after the Annual Meeting of Western Ratepayers rejected the proposal to transfer the Majestic Hotel property in western Shanghai to municipal ownership, a capital group composed of Chinese and foreign businessmen is about to invest in purchasing it. The transaction is expected to be completed within a day or two. Regarding the disposal methods after the group purchases the property, Li Ming stated that approximately 10 to 12 mu of land, including the dance hall and other buildings, will be used to establish a Sino-foreign club. The remaining land will be resold, with the portion along Jing'an Temple Road being sold to Chinese banks to build Western District branch offices. Currently, four banks, including the Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Bank, and Ye Yie Bank, are in contact with the group to purchase land. The capital group consists of seven shares, with Li Ming holding two shares, backed by the five banks mentioned above. Sir Robert Ho Tung holds one share, Tafel holds one share representing Sassoon &amp; Co., Benzimen holds one share representing Ye Guang Company, and the remaining two shares are held by Pu Yi Company and Chang Zi Company.</p>
<h3>Sino-Western Pharmacy Sealed Up</h3>
<p>Provisional Attachment Implemented Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhou Bangjun Issues Statement</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Western Pharmacy on the Fourth Road was sealed and then unsealed on the 13th of this month, the public has been paying close attention to the pharmacy's future. It was generally believed that a peaceful solution would be found. Unexpectedly, at 5 PM yesterday, the Special District Court sent people to implement a provisional attachment and sealed both the front and back doors, effectively shutting down the pharmacy. According to the pharmacy manager, Zhou Bangjun, he was trying to consider the interests of all parties and the livelihood of the employees, so he spared no effort to seek an independent solution. The Public Concession also agreed with his view and ordered accountants Wu and Pan to discuss the transfer procedures together. The situation was progressing smoothly, and the transfer agreement was scheduled to be signed on the 15th of this month. However, due to a lack of understanding from some creditors, this extraordinary measure was taken suddenly. Currently, the matter is within the legal scope, and he can only wait for the court's judgment. However, the pharmacy's branches employ approximately 500 male and female employees. Assuming five family members per employee, this affects no less than two to three thousand people. The livelihood of these two to three thousand people depends solely on the pharmacy. This shutdown will not only push them into a desperate situation but may also affect social order. However, the Special District Court and the creditor representatives' lawyers are known for upholding justice and protecting human rights. It is believed that they must have already planned a comprehensive solution to the employees' livelihood issues, in addition to protecting the creditors' interests. Furthermore, according to the estimates of accountants Wu and Pan, if the Fu Chang Company and the pharmacy are sold, the creditors could receive an initial payment of 20% to 30%. This current action may cause more harm than good in the future.</p>
<h3>A Pair of Lovers Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>Woman Dead, Man in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Seemingly Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Yesterday at No. 201 China Hotel on Tianjin Road, a young couple committed suicide. The woman died after taking poison, while the man is in critical condition and suffering greatly, fearing that he too will die. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Met a Soulmate While Watching a Movie: Cao Jifu, 21 years old, from Chuansha, is an elegant and refined young man who works as a clerk in the tea department of the Jinlong Foreign Firm at No. 177 North Sichuan Road, earning a monthly salary of only 30 yuan. He has been working there for many years. Last year, he met Lin Yuexiang, a 22-year-old woman from Suzhou, at a cinema. They fell in love at first sight, feeling like they had met too late. They were inseparable and their love grew stronger. Every evening at sunset, they would hold hands and visit the cinema.</p>
<p>Very Happy After Cohabitation: Last winter, the two began cohabitating in an apartment at No. 291, Second Floor, Fulu Lane, Laughton Road. On the 16th of last month, they moved to a new apartment at No. 1883, Hele Lane, Xinzha Road. The landlord, surnamed Fang, is a doctor. The apartment is on the second floor and well-furnished. Cao works in the west wing room upstairs. The rent is 25 yuan per month. They hired an old woman from Changshu as a maid. The room contains an iron bed covered with a brocade quilt, a redwood cabinet, a dressing table, a redwood table, a sofa, four redwood chairs, and two coffee tables, resembling a luxurious small home.</p>
<p>The Two Were Like a Newly Married Couple: However, Cao's income was limited, and his expenses were endless. Since last year, he has incurred hundreds of yuan in debt. Although he managed well, he could not make ends meet, leading to the tragic double suicide of the loving couple. According to Cao's aunt, her young master usually went to work around 8 AM every morning and returned home at 5:30 PM. The two were very affectionate, like a newly married couple. She has only been here for twenty days. The young mistress has not gone out either.</p>
<p>Went to China Hotel for a Bath: The night before last (the 15th), our young master did not return until late at night. At that time, the young mistress was already asleep. After the young mistress questioned him closely, he gave evasive answers, and they argued until dawn. Around 8 AM, the young master got up and went out to buy some snacks, which he brought back and shared with the young mistress. They ate and chatted as usual. Around noon, the young mistress got up, washed, and the two had lunch together. Soon after, the young master went out. Around 3 PM, a call came from the China Hotel. The call was from the landlord, asking to speak to the young mistress. After the young mistress spoke on the phone, she learned that the young master had called to invite her to the China Hotel for a bath. They did not return that night.</p>
<p>A Bad Omen from a Phone Call: Yesterday afternoon, the bellboy from the China Hotel called, asking if there was a Mr. Cao at number 33178. The line was then cut off, and they did not think much of it. Shortly after, a call came from the Old Zha Police Station, asking where Fang's residence was and if there was a Cao Jifu. Only then did they learn of this unfortunate event.</p>
<p>The Woman Had Already Passed Away: At noon yesterday, due to the hotel's regulations, the bellboy saw that the guest at room 201 had not yet gotten up, so he called outside the door. When there was no response, he tried to pry open the door and saw two empty bottles of sleeping pills on the table. The man's breath was barely detectable, while the woman had already passed away. He immediately reported to the cashier, who notified the Old Zha Police Station. The ambulance from the Fire Department arrived and took them to Baolong Hospital. Yuexiang's body was transferred to the coroner's office at Ferrand Road at 3:30 PM for autopsy. Cao Jifu, although given injections and resuscitated by doctors, had taken too much poison and was in critical condition.</p>
<p>Two Suicide Notes from Lin Yuexiang: There were two suicide notes in Lin Yuexiang's pocket, one addressed to her mother and one to her brother. Unfortunately, they were taken by the police station for investigation. However, the content was roughly as follows: The letter to her brother stated that the furniture at No. 1883, Hele Lane, Xinzha Road should be transported home. The letter to her mother stated that she had repeatedly disobeyed instructions at the end of last year and had not yet reported to her, which was a deadly sin. She could not repay the kindness of raising her in this life and wished to be reborn to repay it. Her younger brother is young and should choose a good school to study hard so that he can become successful in the future and repay her kindness. They were written in pencil in smooth handwriting with beautiful strokes. The letter was signed Yuexiang, with one hundred bows.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Deceased's Room: When the reporter went to No. 1883, Hele Lane, he was led into the room by the landlord, surnamed Fang, who told him the whole story. According to him, Cao's tragedy was caused by economic pressure. It had only been a month since they moved in. Although the tables and chairs were neat, the books and objects were scattered all over the floor. The room was desolate and unbearable to stay in. The reporter then left.</p>
<h3>Using Uniforms as Charms, Patrolmen Sell Opium</h3>
<p>Lu Shikui Sells Opium More Than Once</p>
<p>Those Who Know the Law and Break It Will Be Punished Doubly</p>
<p>Sentenced to Six Years Imprisonment and a Fine of Six Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Lu Shikui, a Chinese patrolman No. 2141 from the Municipal Police Station, was heavily punished by the Special District Court yesterday for privately selling opium. This case of a public official privately selling opium is unprecedented in the concession. The details of the case are as follows: Lu Shikui is from Hebei Province and is only twenty-six years old. He has been a patrolman in Shanghai for four years. He lives at No. 686 Dexing Lane, Gansu Road. The patrolman has been privately selling opium more than once. Because he always wears his uniform when selling, even if he encounters patrolmen checking pedestrians along the way, the patrolmen never check him because they think he is also a patrolman. Therefore, he is not worried about being caught. However, the white deputy head of the Municipal Police Station in charge of Chinese patrolmen had received reports about Lu's opium selling. Because he did not have concrete evidence, he was reluctant to dismiss him immediately, so he indirectly warned him, hoping to urge him to repent. However, Lu ignored the warnings. At 9 AM the day before yesterday, he secretly purchased seven pounds (84 taels) of opium and hid it in his abdomen under his uniform and armed belt.</p>
<p>Although his abdomen looked slightly bulging, it was not very obvious, and no one noticed. When he arrived at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road, the white deputy head knew that Lu would pass by there based on the report, so he waited there. When Lu passed by, the white deputy head immediately intercepted him, seized the opium, and took him back to the Municipal Police Station. When they arrived at North Suzhou Road, Lu broke free from the white deputy head and fled.</p>
<p>The white deputy head immediately blew his whistle and called nearby patrolmen to assist in the chase. They finally caught Lu. After arriving at the police station and questioning him, he was strictly detained. The case was reported to the chief patrol, who determined that the patrolman's illegal private business was unforgivable and immediately dismissed him and notified the legal team to file a public prosecution with the Special District Court, requesting severe punishment. Yesterday morning, the white deputy head personally escorted Lu Shikui to the Special Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the trial in the second courtroom. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, prosecuted him for the crime of privately selling opium according to Article 6 of the Opium Prohibition Law. However, because the defendant was a public official, he requested that the punishment be doubled according to Article 15 of the same law. Judge Wu then interrogated Lu Shikui, who claimed that his friend Zhao, who is currently a train fireman at the North Railway Station, had met him a few days ago and invited him to discuss something yesterday. Zhao then rented two bicycles and took him to a certain place, ordering him to wait. After a while, Zhao returned and handed him this package, asking him to take it home. Judge Wu asked if he was selling it. Lu said that he thought Zhao might be selling it. Lawyer Zhang then rose to argue, stating that the defendant, as a patrolman, should know that selling opium is a crime. However, he knowingly violated the law and disregarded the law. Moreover, the person he contacted was a train fireman, making it even easier to collude and conspire. There are no less than six or seven thousand patrolmen in the concession. If they all relied on their names and positions to violate the law and engage in private business, the opium prohibition would be greatly affected, and the reputation of the police station would be ruined. To warn others and uphold the law, he should be severely punished. Article 6 of the Opium Prohibition Law stipulates that private sellers of opium should be sentenced to imprisonment for no more than five years and fined no more than five thousand yuan. Since the defendant is a current patrolman, he should be punished according to Article 15 of the Opium Prohibition Law, which stipulates that public officials who privately sell opium should be punished twice as severely as Article 6. After careful consideration, Judge Wu immediately sentenced Lu Shikui to six years of imprisonment for the crime of being a public official intending to sell and possessing opium, and fined him six thousand yuan. If he cannot pay the fine, he will be imprisoned for one year. The opium was confiscated. Many senior police officers from the Municipal Police Station were in court to listen to the trial. After hearing the verdict, they all said it was fair, and Lu showed no sign of disagreement. Perhaps he knew that he was guilty and would not make an unnecessary appeal, willingly accepting his punishment. However, the severity of the sentence for opium cases since the establishment of the Special District Court is the first in this case.</p>
<h3>Alas, Shen Yunjie Was Mistakenly Killed by Patrolmen</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Was a Special Patrolman</p>
<p>His Clothing Was Similar to That of the Robbers</p>
<p>The Patrolmen Did Not Investigate and Shot at Him</p>
<p>The Family Is Preparing to Sue</p>
<p>Six or seven armed robbers who robbed Wang Yongtai's shoe store on Xinzha Road of more than 200 yuan in cash the night before last at 10:30 PM fled to the intersection of Tibet Road and Nanjing Road and encountered patrolmen, who exchanged gunfire. Pedestrians were affected, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The robbers were neither killed nor captured and completely escaped. The report in yesterday's newspaper that one was killed and one was captured was false. The person killed by the stray bullets was a special patrolman. His name was Shen Yunjie, from Nanxiang, only twenty-three years old. He lived at No. 1112 Longmen Road in Shanghai. Shen originally worked for the British-owned Anli Foreign Firm and also served as a voluntary special patrolman. At 8 PM the night before last, he went to the Old Zha Police Station to work. At 10 PM, he finished his work and went home. As he approached the corner of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road, he encountered the patrolmen and robbers exchanging gunfire. The robbers were no match and fled. Shen's clothing was similar to that of one of the robbers. In this emergency situation, the patrolmen did not have time to investigate and mistook Shen for a robber, shooting him. When he fell to the ground, the patrolmen still thought he was a robber. He was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital, where doctors found ten gunshot wounds on his body and removed eight bullets. The other two wounds were through-and-through, so the bullets were missing. However, he had already died when he arrived at the hospital. After the bullets were removed, the body was transported to the coroner's office on Ferrand Road. At 9:30 AM yesterday, Prosecutor Guo from the Special District Court inspected the body and interrogated the Chinese undercover patrolman No. 184 from the Xinzha Police Station, who said, "Last night at 10 PM, I received a report of a robbery near Wenzhou Road on Xinzha Road and saw four robbers with pistols walking in front. One of the robbers was wearing a copper basin hat and a gray coat. Because I was alone, I had to secretly follow the robbers and wait for an opportunity to act. When the robbers reached the gate of the Ningbo Native Association on Tibet Road, I signaled to the Chinese and Indian patrolmen there. Just as we were about to surround them, the robbers noticed us and suddenly opened fire. We also returned fire and continued to chase them to the intersection of Nanjing Road. The robbers fled east along Nanjing Road. The deceased came from the opposite direction, also wearing a gray copper basin hat and similar clothing. I mistook him for the robber wearing the copper basin hat, so I shot him. It was only after the incident that I realized I had shot the wrong person." The deceased's father, Shen Jiting, stated, "I have three sons. The deceased was the second son and was not yet married. Now he has been brutally killed. I have hired a lawyer and am preparing to sue." Prosecutor Guo then wrote a statement saying, "The deceased, Shen Yunjie, was indeed shot and killed by patrolmen who mistakenly thought he was a robber during a battle. The body is handed over to the deceased's father, Shen Jiqing, who has signed a guarantee to take the body back for burial. The eight bullets are kept on file."</p>
<p>Tao Zhi, inspector general of the Public Concession Special Chinese Police Corps, sent a letter to this newspaper for Mr. Shen yesterday, saying, "I am writing to inform you that I read in today's newspaper in the 'Local News' column a news item titled 'Patrolmen Fought Robbers on Nanjing Road Last Night,' which stated that one robber was killed on the spot, which is absolutely inconsistent with the facts. The fact is that Mr. Shen Yunjie, a member of the Public Concession Special Chinese Police Corps training corps, went to the Old Zha Police Station at 8:45 PM last night and left at 10 PM. After resting briefly, he was walking home when he passed Nanjing Road and encountered patrolmen fighting robbers. The patrolmen mistakenly identified Mr. Shen as a robber and shot him to death. This has been certified by our corps and examined by Prosecutor Guo of the Special District Court this morning, who found that the deceased, Shen Yunjie, was indeed shot and killed during the battle with the robbers. This matter concerns the reputation of Mr. Shen, and I am specially requesting a correction. Sincerely, Tao Zhi, Inspector General of the Public Concession Special Chinese Police Corps, April 16, Republic of China Year 20."</p>
<h3>Wang Denggui Incited His Lover to Murder Her Husband</h3>
<p>The Lover Did Not Obey His Words</p>
<p>Denggui Took Action Himself</p>
<p>At No. 7 Tuditang, Muddy Ferry, Pudong, Sun Wengao, from Shanyang, works as a laborer in the Longmao Warehouse. His wife, Sun Ding, 31, works in the Japanese-owned Huasha Factory. She has been having an affair with Wang Denggui, who used to be a foreman in the same factory, for over a year. Wang's lust and cruelty led him to give Sun's wife a packet of arsenic, telling her to mix it into Sun's rice so that he would die after eating it. Sun has a history of heart pain, so Wang claimed it was medicine. He did not tell her what it was at the time, and she was suspicious of putting medicine in the rice, so she did not do it. Wang, unhappy that she did not obey him, saw Sun urinating by the riverbank around 7 PM the night before last and hit him twice on the back of the head with a wooden stick, causing his head to bleed. His intention was to take Sun's life. Sun, injured, turned around and grabbed Wang. Wang pushed Sun into the river, but Sun held on, and they both fell into the river. A fight in the water resulted in the patrolmen taking them to the Third District Police Station. Shortly after, Sun's wife surrendered to the police station, stating Wang's plot to murder her husband. The police station believed that the case was serious and transferred it to the District Court for investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Unable to Help Each Other on the Same Boat</h3>
<p>Instead, They Stole Everyone's Money</p>
<p>Leaving Everyone Unable to Return Home</p>
<p>Chen Fengshan, Xu Guanyu, Zhou Wengui, Hua Kangdong, and Gu Qisi, all from Jiangbei, work in Shanghai. A few days ago, they traveled together to the Northern Jiangsu Wharf to board the Japanese ship Sanyo Maru to return home. They bought all third-class tickets and sat together in the cabin. As dusk fell and the ship was about to depart, they suddenly heard a passenger in the same cabin arguing with a man from Jiangbei named Wang Linlin. The passenger accused Wang of stealing silver dollars. Chen and the other four, who had cash on their bodies, checked their pockets and found that the cash was gone. They questioned Wang, who refused to admit it. His accomplice, Lu Jinlin, took off his coat and pretended to fight with the others, while Wang put the stolen money in the coat pocket. Taking off the coat was a way to hide the stolen goods. After the patrolmen were called and Wang and Lu were arrested, they searched their bodies but found nothing. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court for investigation. Chen Fengshan and the others filed a lawsuit, stating that a total of 105 yuan in legal tender was stolen. Wang and Lu insisted on denying the charges. Judge Feng said that there were eyewitnesses to their theft, so there was no room for denial. He sentenced Wang Linlin and Lu Jinlin to one year and two months of imprisonment each. However, Chen Fengshan and the other five had all their travel funds stolen and were unable to return home or stay in Shanghai, leaving them in a very difficult situation. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, generously donated five yuan in court and offered to persuade the police station staff to donate to help Chen and the others, who expressed their gratitude and left.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Commendation for Not Concealing</p>
<p>Gold Ring Given by Passenger</p>
<h3>Driver Luan Hexiao</h3>
<p>Publicly Announces Lost Gold Ring</p>
<p>Investigates the Original Owner of the Ring</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Notice: This notice concerns a report submitted by the Fifth District on the 9th of this month, stating that on the 5th of this month at 6:30 PM, Huang Bao car owner Yu Kairui of Shenxingfang No. 256, Sanyang Road, reported that according to Luan Hexiao, the driver of car No. 1633, on the 4th of this month at 2 PM, he and another driver each carried a passenger to the Dry Bridge in Zhabei. The two passengers hurriedly got out of the car and gave a gold ring as fare. At that time, the other driver thought it was copper and refused to accept it, so he asked Luan to take it back and have someone check it. He knew it was real gold and dared not keep it, so he reported it to the police station for verification. The report was consistent with what was reported during the interrogation. However, it is suspected that there is an unknown source for using a gold ring as fare for a car. Therefore, the gold ring is submitted together with the document for your review. It is noted that in recent years, the world has become increasingly immoral, and fraud is rampant. In Shanghai, where people from all directions gather, fraudulent acquisition of wealth is heard every day. It is rare to find someone with integrity and good character in ordinary society, let alone a coolie driver. However, the Huang Bao car driver Luan Hexiao reported to the district and dared not conceal the gold ring given by a passenger as fare. His heart was as pure as jade, and his actions were worthy of praise. In addition to giving a reward of four yuan to show encouragement, the gold ring is publicly announced for collection, and instructions have been given to investigate and interrogate the person who paid the gold ring as fare. This notice is issued to the public for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Authority in the World of Sexology, Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, to Visit Shanghai</h3>
<p>Lectures…Central University, St. John's University, Western Young Men's Christian Association</p>
<p>Expressed…Erroneous Sexual Moral Concepts Caused an Era of Indiscriminate Marriage</p>
<p>Effort…To Enlighten Humanity's Pure Sexual Life Movement</p>
<p>Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, a world-renowned authority in the field of sexology, president of the World League for Sexual Reform, and president of the Berlin Society for Sexual Science, having completed his lecture tour of medical associations and medical universities throughout the United States, travelled from America to Japan last month. He was very well-received by the medical community in Japan. It is now heard that Dr. Hirschfeld is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month from Japan. There are already more than three local organizations that have booked Dr. Hirschfeld for lectures: the Medical School of National Central University, St. John's University, and the Western Young Men's Christian Association. The topics of the three lectures will focus on common physiological sexual knowledge. In addition, he will give a specialized lecture to the German-speaking Western Medical Association, which is organized within the medical community. It is reported that the lecture at the Western Young Men's Christian Association will be a public lecture, open to anyone who wishes to attend. According to Dr. Hirschfeld's interview with the New Life Society correspondent in Japan, the world, regardless of country, is currently suffering from an era of indiscriminate marriage because of the erroneous concepts of sexual morality. I (Dr. Hirschfeld speaking of himself) do not approve of indiscriminate marriage. However, I also cannot approve of the one-man-one-woman system established under erroneous consciousness, and the mere avoidance of divorce is</p>

<p>not sufficient. Human sexual life must be based on the family, and there must be a more pure and better improvement. Therefore, I am committed to the lifelong goal of inspiring a pure movement in human sexual life. It is reported that the doctor is now over seventy years old. He has maintained celibacy since the age of fifty. The World League for Sexual Reform, which he leads, has been able to realize its plans with the help of the famous Dr. Havelock Ellis and Dr. [Another Name]. There are branches all over the world, and there are many followers in Japan. He has written a total of 168 books on sexual issues.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Cancels Three-Wheeled Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Reserving the Original Number...Converting to Two-Wheeled Vehicles</p>
<p>The city's three-wheeled rickshaws (commonly known as pedal-powered rickshaws) were inspected and reduced to 37 vehicles by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities in November of the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1930]. The Bureau considered that although the construction and speed of this type of rickshaw were superior to ordinary rickshaws, the cost was very high and the various parts of the machinery were not complete. Sooner or later they would be eliminated. Therefore, in this expansion of licensed rickshaws, a portion of the quota was reserved for three-wheeled rickshaws. The existing 37 vehicles will be uniformly cancelled, and they will be allowed to build two-wheeled rickshaws according to the original quota and exchange their licenses to operate. It is reported that the Bureau has ordered the agents of three-wheeled rickshaws to notify all vehicle merchants to manufacture new two-wheeled vehicles within two months. The validity period of the three-wheeled rickshaw licenses will expire at the end of June of this year.</p>
<h3>Detective Robbed</h3>
<p>Eleven Thieves Arrested Successively</p>
<p>At around 6:30 PM last night, at the home of Cao Chunsheng, a detective currently employed by the French Concession Police, at No. 64 Chengqing Lane, Rue Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, six robbers suddenly arrived: three wearing Western suits and three wearing Zhongshan suits. Four of the robbers, armed with pistols, entered the house and immediately confined all the residents upstairs and downstairs in the attic on the second floor. They then divided up to search and plunder. It is estimated that they robbed Detective Cao and his tenant, a Mr. Lu, of a pair of gold bracelets, five gold rings, and clothing and other items, worth a total of more than 400 yuan. As they were about to escape from the main entrance, Detective Cao had just returned home from the police station, and when he arrived at the entrance, he saw that the double doors were tightly closed. Knowing that something was wrong, he secretly waited outside the door. After a while, he saw six people rushing out of the house, looking flustered. Detective Cao was certain that they were robbers, so he called his tenant, Lu Linsheng, to follow them closely. The robbers went north after leaving the lane, then east along the Wusong River Road to Rue des Cavaliers, then back east to Avenue Foch, and then north along Avenue MacMahon, passing Avenue Edward VII, then down Xizang Road to Fuzhou Road, entering the Great China Hotel in a single file. At that time, Detective Cao instructed Lu Linsheng to guard the entrance and not let them escape. Cao then rushed to the Old Gate Police Station to report. Before long, two robbers returned out of the main gate, and Lu immediately secretly informed the nearby patrol officers, who first intercepted the two robbers and took them to the police station for interrogation. After questioning, the two robbers confessed that there were accomplices hiding in Room 514 on the fifth floor of the Great China Hotel. The police chief then sent a large number of detectives to arrest them. They found three more people in the room and recovered part of the stolen goods. One robber was still at large, and all the robbery pistols were taken away by the fugitive. Detective Cao immediately reported back to the French Concession Police, who sent detectives to take the five robbers back for strict interrogation. They confessed that their accomplices were hiding in Room 204 of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. The French police chief then ordered the original detectives, together with the Old Gate Police Station detectives, to arrest two people at the Far East Hotel. Before long, they captured four more people, for a total of eleven people arrested. They are currently continuing the interrogation to investigate the remaining accomplices.</p>
<h3>Postponement of the Xue Inheritance Dispute Case</h3>
<p>Hua Lihou, the son-in-law of the deceased Xue Baorun, along with his two sons, Yi Gu and Yi Hong, and his daughter, Manyun, filed a lawsuit in the French Concession Tribunal against their mother-in-law, Xue Sun, and his brothers-in-law, Gansheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, and Gensheng, seeking to divide the inheritance. At the previous hearing, the defendants did not appear. They were ordered to surrender themselves for interrogation. Yesterday, the defendants were summoned again, but only Gansheng and Gensheng appeared. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that there were five defendants in total, but only two had appeared, with three still absent, requesting that a proposal be made to summon them for interrogation. The plaintiff has now discovered that the defendants have entrusted all their property to a Mr. Wang, a comprador at Jardine Matheson Bank, as collateral for a loan of 1.5 million yuan. He requested an urgent injunction to provisionally seize the property and ordered the two defendants who appeared to each deposit 100,000 yuan in silver. The defendants' lawyers, Lin Yingqing and Wang Yintai, argued that it was not yet clear whether the case was valid and that the plaintiff's request was</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>inappropriate. However, it was found that the plaintiff still owed the defendants a large sum of money from their deceased father, and the defendants were seeking to clarify the accounts and request a counterclaim. The defendants, five in total, were a mother and sons, and since two of them had surrendered, there was no need to summon them all. The defendant Xue Gansheng stated that the merchant's collateral loan was made before the plaintiff filed the lawsuit, not after, and requested a clear investigation. The presiding judge ordered that the hearing be postponed for seven days.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Forced Prostitution Case</h3>
<p>Lu Aie, a young woman from Hangzhou, was lured to Shanghai by Zheng Aitang last winter and forced into prostitution. Lu, unwilling to engage in this shameless profession and unable to bear the pain of whipping, seized an opportunity to escape some time ago. She retained lawyer Fan Gang to file a complaint with the Special District Court against Zheng Qingtang for obstructing her freedom and forcing her into prostitution, requesting that he be punished according to the law. Judge Feng Shide heard the case once, but the defendant did not appear. He ordered the plaintiff to lead the police to Zheng's residence for identification and summon Zheng to court for further interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Today is the date of the second hearing. It is now learned that Zheng Qingtang, realizing that he could not escape the law, voluntarily requested a settlement, returning the indenture to Lu Aie, freeing her forever from the relationship. Yesterday afternoon, Zheng and Lu went to lawyer Fan's office to sign the settlement, and lawyer Fan filed a statement with the court to withdraw the complaint.</p>
<h3>Fire on Milu Road</h3>
<p>A fire broke out in the kitchen of a certain family at No. 5 Ronghua Lane, Milu Road in the French Concession, at around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, due to carelessness. Fortunately, neighboring residents helped to extinguish it, and a major disaster was avoided.</p>

Therefore, there are many customers buying at the store, and wholesale sales are especially brisk.</p>
<h3>Dr. Tu Kaiyuan to Return to China from Germany</h3>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan, the younger brother of Tu Kaizheng, the manager of Jicheng Pharmacy, graduated from the middle school of Tongji University ten years ago. Due to his excellent grades, he was sent abroad to study medicine at the University of Berlin in Germany. He graduated in 1928 and was assigned by the university to intern at a well-known local hospital. He then served as a doctor and earned a reputation, especially for his surgical skills. He is now concerned about his aging father and does not want to stay abroad for a long time, so he has resigned and is returning to China. Yesterday, he received a telegram from Berlin stating that he had boarded a ship and is expected to arrive in port at the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Regarding the responsibility for the collision between the Dahua and Dachang, reported in your newspaper on the 16th, in which it was stated that the Dahua and Dachang were mutually at fault, a reporter from the National News Agency investigated both sides, each holding their own version. According to the Dachang, the ship glimpsed the Dahua's green light and immediately steered left, forming a 120-degree angle. Now, according to the first and second officers of the Dachang, what they told the news reporter at the time was that they glimpsed the Dahua's green light, sounded the horn once, and turned the rudder to the right three times each. At that time, the Dahua slightly avoided to the right, and there would have been no collision, and even less would the ship have formed a 120-degree angle. We specifically ask your newspaper to make a correction to clarify the facts. Sincerely, General Association of Chinese Merchant Marine Officers, April 16</p>
<p>To the Editor, In the account of the sinking of the Dachang published in your newspaper on the 16th, in item two, there is the phrase "caused by the Dahua violently ramming the starboard side amidships." Please change it to "violently ramming the port side behind the red light amidships." We hope you will correct this. Sincerely, Shanghai Editorial Department, Dahua Company</p>

<h3>A Thought or Two</h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>▲ Loyalty and love are the most beautiful things in the world and the most reliable cord after a man and woman are joined.</p>
<p>▲ A strong wind can extinguish a spark but can help a prairie fire grow. Separation is the same: it can extinguish temporary impulses but can prolong true love.</p>
<p>▲ Don't flatter men. After they do something they are proud of, they will flatter themselves without being asked.</p>
<p>▲ Buying something useless at an auction is the best principle in a woman's economics.</p>
<p>▲ Men with small cleverness are most likely to win the hearts of women, while those with great learning have to take a back seat.</p>
<p>▲ The difference between modern marriage and old-fashioned marriage is that there is one more head of the family and one more kind of cigarette in the family.</p>
<p>▲ Where there is no knowledge, "I don't understand" is science.</p>
<p>▲ Barbarians worship wood and stone as idols. If the wood and stone do not respond, they lash them with force. Modern people worship flesh and blood as idols. If the flesh and blood do not fulfill their wishes, they cut off their heads.</p>
<p>▲ The so-called ideal wife is a woman who can be considerate of a man in everything and do what he considers ideal.</p>
<p>▲ The family is the prison of girls and the factory of women.</p>
<p>▲ People with toothaches often think that they will be very happy without teeth. The poor also fall into a similar error when viewing the rich.</p>
<h3>On the Japanese Cherishing Their Own Broom</h3>
<p>— Xiefei</p>
<p>Professor Miura Shūgyō of the Japanese Imperial University is famous for his research on legal history. He was invited by Zhongshan University and Lingnan University in Guangzhou to give lectures in China. Introduced by the Japanese Consul General in the capital, he lectured on the topic of "The Special Qualities of Japanese Culture" at Zhongshan University. To enjoy one's own broom as if it were a thousand pieces of gold is what Miura is all about. (The following is what Miura said.)</p>
<p>Japan's founding dates back 2,591 years, with 124 generations. The so-called unbroken imperial line means that no one coveted the throne, and even if there were disputes, they were internal struggles within the imperial family, splitting into two dynasties. Some say that the people came from the South Seas, while others say that they were local scholars. However, with the Yamato people as the mainstay, immigrants from outside are assimilated over time, so there is no danger of subversion of national unity and state unity. Buddhism and Christianity both flourished after entering Japan. The people have no interest in revolution, but everyone understands the importance of governing the country and bringing peace to the world. Revolutions in Goryeo and China had no impact on Japan. 431 years ago, Japan traded with China on an equal footing. Since then, it has not discriminated against other countries, and its equal perspective is a special characteristic of Japan.</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages, there was a conflict between the Taira and Minamoto clans in Japan, but it cannot be called a revolution. At that time, men and women, husbands and wives, loved and cared for each other. This custom later underwent a major change, causing the governance of the ancient and medieval periods to disappear, causing people today to think of restoring the prosperous age of the past and carrying out revolutionary actions from time to time. The Taika Reform 634 years ago and the Meiji Restoration 63 years ago were both motivated by a return to antiquity. During the French Revolution, Rousseau's Social Contract advocated a return to the primitive. What differed from Japan was that Japan returned to the era of Emperor Jimmu without reaching the savage primitive and changed peacefully, so that foreign prisoners were also treated very favorably afterwards. The invasion of Korea by Toyotomi Hideyoshi 300 years ago is sufficient to demonstrate this.</p>
<p>In politics, there are also so-called classes. In ancient times, the clan was the center, and in the Middle Ages, the warrior was the center. Within the clan and the warrior class, there were also many different classes, but they were not harmful to politics and all took it as their urgent task to govern the country. Maintaining Japanese culture without decay, although there are disturbances, the great power has never left the hands of the Emperor for a single day. There are always those who hold the Emperor hostage to command the lords, who are often condemned by the people and retreat on their own. Today, in the world, one Emperor alone cannot handle all matters, so he delegates many affairs. Although there are class restrictions in society, there are many examples of commoners rising to prominence. Tokugawa, Fujiwara, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi are all prominent examples. Since the Meiji Restoration, individualism and utilitarianism have entered Japan, breaking the shackles of class on the one hand and allowing ambitious people to seize power under the pretext of national unity and class superiority. Therefore, the idea of restoring the past is often strong. Japan is a country that is both the newest and the oldest in the world. Song and dance disappeared in the Sui Dynasty, and Buddhism was not passed down in India, but both can be found in Japan. Japan has entered the world stage for only 24 years, but the newest culture of Europe and the United States is fully prepared on the three islands.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from a Hangzhou Trip</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>I left West Lake eight years ago. This Spring Festival, I accompanied Qicheng to Hangzhou to recuperate, so I was able to revisit the old place. The lakes and mountains are unharmed, and they greeted me with a smile. I will select and record one or two things to leave a trace.</p>
<p>▲ The astonishing progress of the municipal administration. When I first visited Hangzhou eight years ago, only the area around the lake had cobblestone roads. Now, almost all of them have been replaced with asphalt roads, and the thoroughfares are as dense as spider webs. Tourists strolling on the Su and Bai causeways almost feel as if they are in fairyland. In addition to this, the mountain roads between the various scenic spots are also well-organized and easy to identify. If there are intersections, there are road signs, which are high enough to avoid getting lost. Therefore, even those who arrive in Hangzhou for the first time will not get lost if they follow the road.</p>
<p>▲ The inns are overflowing with people. Around the Qingming Festival, there are the most tourists on the lake. In addition, the spring breeze is balmy and the sky is clear for thousands of miles, so how many tens of thousands of people travel together with their families and friends? All the large inns are full. Therefore, the small inns take the opportunity to make profits. What used to cost only a few cents a night now costs five, six, or even ten times as much, and the guests are happy to flock to them. The Hangzhou people's skill in peeling cucumbers (a Hangzhou saying for taking advantage of someone) can be seen here. Other restaurants, tea houses, boats, and vehicles have also tripled their profits.</p>
<p>▲ Modern West Lake. Su Shi wrote in a poem, "If you compare West Lake to Xishi, she is always suitable whether she is lightly or heavily made up." In the past, West Lake still retained its ancient charm. Now, foreign houses and high-rise buildings line the lake, greatly changing its old appearance. It has gone from being lightly made up to being heavily made up. A humorous guest said that Xishi has put on Western clothes and has been transformed into a modern woman. This is also an interesting saying.</p>
<p>▲ No fish in West Lake. The best dishes in the lakes and mountains were originally water shield and vinegar fish. However, the fish in West Lake have suffered a great disaster. The authorities have caught almost all of them. It is said that after the fish were caught, they were all bought by the Buddhist Association for ten thousand yuan. The association placed the living ones in the release pond and buried the dead ones. Fearing that gluttons would excavate them, they poured kerosene on top of them. If the fish had spirits, they would know that burying their bones in the green mountains is as immortal as the names of beautiful women and famous scholars, which is also a special honor.</p>
<p>▲ Spring scenery by the lake. The trees in the area around the lake and Gushan are lush and the red flowers are like rain. The scenery is so beautiful that there are few comparisons. There are often beautifully dressed young girls riding quickly among them. Wherever they pass, tourists watch with admiration. In the past, Hangzhou forbade women to ride bicycles because it was thought to be harmful to public morals. I stayed for three days and did not see a single one. However, riding quickly is even more ostentatious than bicycles. It is difficult to resolve the issue of favoring one over the other.</p>
<p>▲ Frequent music. The most lively area in Hangzhou is around Qinghefang. Common people mistakenly believe that it is by the lake. Qinghefang has many large shops, especially silk and satin shops. In addition to large discounts, they also hire musicians to play music as a way to attract customers. Strolling among them is like being in Shanghai, and the frequent music is deafening. I especially suffer from it.</p>
<h3>Fragments of Art</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>▲ Honeybee Society Fan Painting Exhibition. After the Hai Shang Painting Society and Tijing Hall, the Honeybee Painting Society is the most reputable, with many talented people and refined works. Among the members, Shang Shengbo, Wang Shizi, Ma Mengrong, and Ye Weishen's flowers and birds, Ma Qizhou, Zhang Daqian, Zheng Wuchang, Sun Xueni, He Tianjian, Qian Shoutie, Zhu Shaoyue, and Shen Jianzhi's landscapes, Xiong Songquan's lions, Zhang Shanzi's tigers, and Xie Gongzhan's chrysanthemums are all excellent works of the time. They are now planning to cooperate to exhibit round fans and palm fans and sell them cheaply to fellow enthusiasts to give them an opportunity to appreciate art. There will definitely be an unprecedented grand occasion. The fans are all made by the Sun Xueni, who has carefully researched and urged the Shengsheng Company to manufacture them. The exquisiteness of the production and the ingenuity of the styles can be called unique.</p>
<p>▲ Selection of Paintings for the Sino-Japanese Painting Exhibition. The Sino-Japanese Painting Exhibition is being held at the Tokyo Ueno Park Art Museum and is scheduled to open on the 28th. Fellow painters will travel east on the 25th, and collectors such as Zhou Xiangyun and Pang Caichen will also bring their collections to compete. Famous artists such as Wang Yiting, Qian Shoutie, Wu Hufan, Sun Xueni, Li Qiujun, Li Zuhan, Zheng Wuchang, and Zhang Shanzi will all sail on the Shanghai Maru. The selected works include Wang Yiting's figure paintings, Qian Shoutie's Picture of Yu Shan Visiting the Stele (ie, visiting the tomb of Da Chi with Hashimoto Kansetsu), Zhang Shanzi's Crouching Tiger, Sun Xueni's Ancient Tree Returning Crows, Zheng Wuchang's Weeping Willow, and Xie Zhiguang's Ladies of the Dream of the Red Chamber are the most precious.</p>
<p>▲ Li Qiujun Hosts a Banquet to Evaluate Paintings. In recent times, Li Qiujun and Yang Xuejiu are the most reputable female painters in Shanghai. Qiujun and her elder brother Zuhan especially like to entertain guests. Hearing that the Sino-Japanese Painting Exhibition was about to open, she added extra effort to rush to paint more than ten landscape masterpieces. On the 11th, she invited the members of the Honeybee Society to a banquet in her residence. After the banquet, she carefully selected her works in order to gain a good reputation and return. Her painstaking efforts are truly beyond what men can match.</p>
<p>▲ Qian Shoutie's Arm Aches from Engraving Seals. Qian Shoutie's seal engraving has always been highly regarded by the people of Sakurajima. This time, Kawai Senro and other 12 members of the Japan Taido Calligraphy Association came to Jiangdong for sightseeing and stayed at a certain hotel on Seymour Road. They asked Shoutie to engrave more than ten large seals, each an inch in diameter, for days on end. Shoutie rushed to engrave them day and night, and his arm ached as a result. Therefore, those who asked for calligraphy and paintings could not pay the asking price on the spot.</p>
<p>▲ Tian Qingquan is Good at Writing Nudes. Among the painters in Shanghai who are good at painting fashionable ladies, Zheng Mantuo, Xie Zhiguang, and Hang Zhiying are the most reputable. Every time they produce a painting, shops compete to buy it. Unexpectedly, Tian Qingquan, who rose up later, specializes in painting nude paintings, which are well-proportioned and have abundant flesh and bones, almost surpassing the works of his predecessors. A friend who knows his history said that every time Tian writes such paintings, he must wait for the weather to be hot and take advantage of his wife's bathing to carefully observe her again and again and quickly write with a brush. Therefore, his charm is unique and lifelike, and others cannot imitate it even if they want to.</p>
<h3>Records of Footprints in Huzhou (3)</h3>
<p>— Shen Xingchu</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, the boat sailed back to</p>
<p>▲ Daochang Mountain. Upon landing, we first went to Lower Hundred Steps and then through Upper Hundred Steps to the side of the Fuhu Chan Temple. Next to it is the Fuhu Cave, said to be where Wu Song fought the tiger, which is inevitably an assumption. We then passed Hundred Flowers Street, with flowers carved all over the stones. On top of it is the temple built during the Wu Yue period, formerly known as Daochang True Temple and renamed Hūsheng Wànshòu Temple by the Song Dynasty. Turning right, we arrived at the top of the mountain. There is a temple called Jiuhua and a pagoda called Duobao, shaped like a pen pagoda. Next to the pagoda is a tree that was destroyed by lightning. The locals say that eating its bark can cure all diseases, so the bark of the tree has been peeled and eaten almost completely, and its trunk is swaying in the wind as if it is about to fall. Going down the mountain and boarding the boat, we planned to visit Taoyuan, passing through</p>
<p>▲ Bilang Lake. The lake water is clear and you can see the bottom. It is surrounded by mountains and the scenery is difficult to describe. In the lake there is</p>
<p>▲ Fuyu Pagoda. The boatman said that this pagoda often floats on the water surface. When the water rises, it cannot be seen high, and when the water recedes, it cannot be seen low. I don't know if this is credible. Suddenly, a strong wind blew up, and the awning of the speedboat was broken by the wind. For a moment, there were shouts and screams, and everyone looked at each other in dismay. The engine stopped and the rudder lost its power. The boat turned in circles and could not move forward. So we ordered the boatman to pole close to the shore and boarded the shore one after another. We walked to</p>
<p>▲ Taoyuan, which was created by the old man Li Songjun. Many peach trees are planted in the garden, with plum and plum trees interspersed among them. The pavilions and buildings are well arranged. We then went to</p>
<p>▲ Chen Yingshi's Tomb. On top of it is the Xiongkua Pavilion. President Sun and President Li both have inscriptions. Celebrities have also written almost all the inscriptions. We then went to</p>
<p>▲ Xian Mountain. On top of it is the Qingling. Emperor Qin Shi Huang destroyed the mountain's pulse because the mountain had the aura of a king. There is also a wine goblet that can hold five dou of wine. On top of it is the Wozun Pavilion, built during the Dali period of the Tang Dynasty. There are many ancient sites on Xian Mountain, but most of them have been submerged and are difficult to examine. At that time, the sky was already dark. We rushed into the city and passed through</p>
<p>▲ Pailou Street. There are dozens of large and small archways, intricately carved and with a unique charm. We returned to the Four Seasons Spring Night Restaurant for dinner, and it was already eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>▲ Fifth Day. Because the trip to Bi Yan was far away that day, we should get up early. Therefore, we got up at 4:30 and went outside at 5:00. The streets were silent. When we arrived at the wharf, the boatman was still not awake. We urged him to get up. Because Bi Yan is in Changxing territory and is a place where bandits come and go, we added 24 members of the regiment to escort us. We set off at 5:45, passing</p>
<p>▲ Tuying Bridge, also commonly known as Dumb Bridge. Its principle is the same as that of Chao Yin Bridge.</p>
<h3>India Travelogue (26)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 11th, I met Mr. Rai Sahib H. C. Mazumdra in the park. He chanted his Indian scriptures towards the sun. We discussed the revival of Eastern culture. Mr. Mazumdra was a long-time professor at Presidency University and is now retired with an annual pension. The title "Rai Sahib" is an honorary title. He sincerely hopes that China will value Asian philosophy and a noble, detached view of life in the future, unlike the Western emphasis on animalistic desires and plunder, treating people as slaves and sacrificial victims. He lamented that Indians are starving and freezing everywhere, with no one caring, which is extremely unfair. Indians do not necessarily reject British rule but hope for humane equality. He said that he is now old and retired, receiving a pension, and is a free and idle person. His children are studying abroad. Without China's help in the future, Asia cannot prosper. He added that Indian culture, from the cold of the snowy mountains in the north to the richness of tropical flora and fauna in the south, is like a miniature Earth and has never failed the world. It only seeks to illuminate the world and humanity so that the masses can be saved. He also described the nobility of the Brahmin doctrines in India. "Brahmin" means purity, representing the highest god, with various specialized gods below, totaling thirty-three million, he said. Fearing I couldn't remember, he even used a mathematical table to show me the number as follows: 330,000,000.</p>
<p>I discussed with someone the fact that the British, having seized political power in India, would not easily relinquish it. For Indians without weapons, such a thing would not happen. If true independence is sought, it might be after the Second World War. Moreover, there is another problem: India's powerful neighbor is the Muslim population, whose influence extends east to China and west to the Mediterranean. If Britain withdraws, the powerful Muslims would certainly not be opposed by the Indians, for India is a nation of culture, not military prowess. This is also a great concern. In the future, if one wishes for global equality, I advocate intermarriage between nations and religions as the most important thing. Through intermarriage, the strong and weak, different and same, will all be assimilated. However, India has religious divisions, racial divisions, and class divisions, with too many differences and too much estrangement. Therefore, it is easy for the Chinese to exploit.</p>
<p>Although the Indian women's movement is thriving, there is a great divide between men and women. There are no female students in the park, which is very different from China. Some wear a veiled cloth on their heads to travel. At first glance, they are surprised to find the woman covered head to toe to be like walking corpses, but on closer inspection, they reveal two holes for the eyes: they are Muslim women.</p>

<h3>Going to Eat Tangyuan</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>"Chairman should treat us today! Look at the weather, it's so nice, there isn't even a slight breeze, and it's Sunday, you should fulfill your promise!"</p>
<p>The clock had already struck nine, even the most lazy Yi had already eaten breakfast by this time. He was the first to knock on the door and come in, holding a cup full of steaming hot water. He said triumphantly to the Chairman of our student union. Then he picked up yesterday's Shanghai newspaper from Yi's desk, waiting for his reply.</p>
<p>"That's right, today is Sunday and it's a sunny day, let's treat everyone to Baoshan Tangyuan! Haha!"</p>
<p>So we all attacked the chairman together. Everyone laughed for a while, as if anticipating the arrival of a piece of happiness. Yi also smiled, staring at the chairman.</p>
<p>"Alright, I was planning to go out for a walk anyway. If you want to go, we have to hurry, otherwise we'll only be able to eat a closed door."</p>
<p>Yi's applause followed his footsteps out the door. A burst of noise immediately arose in the neighboring room. Soon, seven or eight students in uniforms stood at the stairwell. The chairman also tidied up his clothes, put his wallet away, locked the door, and stepped down the stairs. Several excited students were so happy that they almost forgot their shape, like little birds flying out of a cage, walking with a skip. Xi, who had just finished breakfast and was about to go to Shanghai, was tied up by us. No matter how he struggled, he couldn't escape our grasp, even though he had escaped once, he was still caught.</p>
<p>"Hey, isn't that Ping? Be careful, don't let him escape, we must tie him up! Yu, leave Xi to you, let me deal with him."</p>
<p>Yi had very good eyesight, he recognized Ping's face and gait from very far away. He knew that he also wanted to go to Shanghai with Xi, but he deliberately wanted to tease him. Ping also saw our group of people sneaking around and ran towards the playground. However, the grass after the recent rain was still a bit wet. The newly polished leather shoes were unwilling to get muddy, and we were blocking his way head-on. He had no way to escape, so he had to surrender. Xi and Yi, who had a bit of strength, squeezed his arms on both sides. It was really like two prisoners being taken to the execution ground. Men, women, old, and young passing by were all laughing at us. Shu, who had just finished half a bowl of noodles, was also dragged out of the restaurant by us. We were all moving forward with calmness and gentleness.</p>
<p>Ordinary round dumplings are just made of rice flour and water, so what kind of characteristics make people yearn to eat them? But there is a fragrant and romantic story behind it. It is said that this round dumpling shop is not spacious, but "guests are always full." The reason is that there are two young women manning the stove. Although their appearances do not necessarily have the beauty of Xi Shi and Wang Zhaojun, the position they are in is enough to attract a group of bored and idle male youths. The students from several schools bordering Baoshan have a tendency that "I would rather not be granted ten thousand households, but only wish to see the Tangyuan girls." So, whenever friends from any two schools meet each other, they unanimously praise them. As for me, my time here is certainly the shortest, but the saying "go to Baoshan to eat Tangyuan" seems to have long been ingrained in my heart. However, I have never tasted this flavor. Now, spring has come again, and it is the season of birdsong and fragrant flowers. Everyone harbors boundless enthusiasm and is willing to throw themselves into the embrace of nature to indulge to their heart's content. Moreover, our various courses have just begun. Chairman Wen has indeed worked hard for the past student self-government association, sacrificing many studies invisibly. He couldn't bear to continue doing it so blindly, so in this election, he used the condition of treating us to Tangyuan every Sunday when the weather was clear to motivate us not to elect him again. On our side, we only need to raise our pens and we can earn a glimpse of beauty and taste, so why not be happy to do so? So the classmates agreed, and of course, a group of people cast a few dozen votes. Our old-time chairman was defeated, but because he had some old achievements, the other classes elected him another one or two dozen votes and won a seat as an alternate.</p>
<p>After a long period of rain, the earth's creatures were all warmly welcoming the blossoming spring. The yellow fields and bare dead trees were sprouting tender green shoots, already somewhat emerald green and lovely. The wind no longer stung the face like a few days ago, it was just gentle, like velvet stroking the comfort of the face. Although it was so weak, it could still blow up large and small kites, playing a melodic song in the air. In the distant forest, a faint wisp of smoke seemed to float up, faintly revealing red walls and green tiles. A flock of pigeons flew out from there, and the "whirring" whistle immediately entered our hearing. So we also joined in the excitement and sang a few new foreign songs. When we were wandering under the golden-yellow rippling sky, it didn't take two quarters of an hour to reach the Baoshan county seat, which could be reached by hand.</p>
<h3>Sitting Alone</h3>
<p>— Bing She</p>
<p>The first thing that impressed us after entering the city was the Baoshan County Normal School's water gate mud archway. Our footsteps were also naturally driven by a mysterious force to turn towards the north. The gatekeeper led us to the reception room. After Chairman Wen signed the names of the visitors, a Mr. Zhu came out to be our guide. Sometimes he talked about students' career paths and education funding issues, and the expression on his excited face was as if he wanted to spit out raging fire. How could the chairs in the reception room accommodate so many of us? Although we were talking animatedly while sitting, we didn't want them to stand for too long looking at those hanging photos. So we stood up and asked Mr. Zhu to lead us to visit various places. Except for the girls' dormitory with the "No Visitors" sign, we saw the classrooms, library, instrument room, and achievement room clearly. Finally, we climbed that square pavilion that "swallowed mountain light from afar and embraced the Jianglai plain." The river surface reflected the fish-like expanse of waves, and the boats near and far only showed a few black outlines, some like grebes floating on the water, wriggling in spots.</p>
<p>This is not a place for us to stay, so naturally we can't stay long. After we came out, we walked a bit further. In front of a house, a girl of seventeen or eighteen stood upright, recommending herself as a guide. Xi, who was usually a guide, suddenly stopped and said, "Let's go in." So we entered without hesitation through a narrow low house, and then through a courtyard. We sat down in the last room. At another table, there were already three students from middle schools and merchant ships talking and laughing. We prepared our own tables and chairs, and everyone sat down. Yi took out cigarettes and distributed them one by one. The chairman was also busy going out to greet the number of bowls. Before the cigarettes were even halfway smoked, the waitress had already brought in a tray, putting a bowl in front of each person. These were small round dumplings made of fermented rice with a slightly sour taste, and the sweet osmanthus sugar was truly lingering on our teeth even after we rinsed our mouths. After waiting for a while, several bowls of larger white dumplings were brought in, with sweet fillings of both kinds. We couldn't swallow so many, so we barely ate a few and stood up. The room was once again filled with laughter and smoke! Even Shi Chong's "Golden Valley Banquet" could hardly surpass this spectacle.</p>
