<p>（三）第三届大會之重大性</p>
<p>一九二九年秋第三届大會開會於日本西京之奈良。此次大會之重大性。即爲對於關係東亞與世界和平之「東三省問題。」有熱烈且嚴重之討論。使在此熱烈嚴重之討論中。我國代表都以十二分之努力。抗爭辯論。敷陳不平等條約給予我國以迫害之事實。并指斥日人企圖吞併我東北之隂謀。使各國代表對此新中國現在情况。能有相當之明瞭。而日本對我東北侵略之實際情形。亦因之得以暴露於天下。三届會議之概要。列表如次。</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>查此次大會八項議題之中。半爲中國問題。其他皆爲學理上之討論。且對中國之議題。均爲目前應積極解决之實際問題。故會議日程中。對中國問題之討論。幾佔會議時間之半數。夫領事裁判權與租界問題。其爲不合理不平等。損害我國主權。事至顯明。况俄德奥等國僑民在中國法權保障之下。均能安居樂業。而漢潯租界收回以後。兩地外僑。亦甚安然。於此更足徵領事裁判權與租界再無繼續保留之理由。而所謂站在國民外交立塲上之太平洋會議各國代表。竟異口同聲。一致主張延期辦理。關於東三省問題。繼續討論至三日之久。日代表更始終抱持與自國政府一致之倔强態度。肆無理之辯論。爲其政府之代言人。甚且謂侵略我東北。爲彼國之正當權利。我國反對侵略。即爲正義之罪人。其强横無理之態度。巳根本離開國民外交之立塲。致此次會議之成績。於太平洋間國交之前途。未能有良好之影響。召集會議之始意與精神。更因而落空。此則吾人所引爲深憾者也。</p>

<h3>美報評論萬寳山案</h3>
<p>爲日人隂謀之結果</p>
<p>企圖移殖日人失敗</p>
<p>乃轉而利用韓農民</p>
<p>世界新聞社譯密勒評論報云丶日政府移殖其本國人民於滿洲之企圖丶巳告失敗丶而不爲所沮丶今之顯然再圖利用韓人丶期達此同一目的丶近數月來丶在東省發生種種事件丶尤以萬寳山案爲最堪注目丶此即日人圖用韓人移殖滿洲之計畫之直接結果也丶日本最初原擬以日人移殖滿洲丶然雖耗費鉅資丶卒無成效丶經二十年之經營丶目下全滿所有日人丶不過二十萬名丶其中十五萬名丶且皆住於旅大租借區瀋陽長春之日租界丶及沿滿鐵一帶之日人管轄區域之内丶此等日人丶大多直接間接與滿鐵煤礦業或滿鐵所經營之各副業有關丶其獨立的在滿洲之日人殖民丶完全失敗丶因不能與華人競爭故也丶</p>
<p>日政府鑒於以日農民移殖南滿之失敗丶乃轉其目光於韓人丶其始日政府對韓人之移居華境丶不甚注意丶故與華當局少所交涉丶韓人入華籍者以數千計丶與由山東移往東省之數百萬華農民丶頗能相安丶迨至近年丶日政府或至少掌握南滿日人企業之日軍閥丶漸注意韓人丶强迫彼等在日領署註册丶禁止彼等納稅於中國官廳丶並獎勵彼等反抗中國官廳之任何干涉丶每值華韓人間一有轇轕丶日方立派軍隊丶從事「保護」丶苟韓人因中韓間衝突而遭任何損失丶日方之提出賠償要求丶其結果則造成一種緊張形勢丶大有引起確實戰事之可能丶</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>玻璃的校舍</p>
<p>德國對於敎育方法。在全世界向居最高地位。最近新設一所學校。那校舍的建築。别開生面。爲世界各國所未有。所有課堂中的墻壁。不用磚石砌成。却全用玻璃。連書櫉與陳列學生成績的櫉。也全是玻璃製的。不但如此。連外面的圍墻。也不用一磚。全是玻璃。可使陽光充分照入課堂。略無光線不足之苦。化學試騐室中。每一張書案都裝有水電與煤氣的設備。於學生異常便利。又有大花房一所。終年栽花。四季不斷。而在一間課堂中。裝有天文學中的新機械一具。白天無論甚麽時候。都可以研究星斗。而最足使學生們皆大歡喜的。便是校中附設酒排間一所。可以飲酒。并且每個課堂内。都有洗手盆。像這樣新式而可意的學校。學生們斷没有逃學的了。</p>
<p>犯罪的意見書</p>
<p>美國紐約城中的監獄當局。爲謀改良監獄起見。特地懸賞徵求罪犯們撰遞意見書。將各監獄現狀加以批評。并應如何改良。一般罪犯得此消息。大喜過望。都從事著作。不過社會中人都在議論。說監獄中的待遇。要是愈改愈良。那麽做罪犯的未免過于舒服。以後犯罪的人將越發增多了。</p>
<h3>關於國際上的問答</h3>
<p>— 徐午生</p>
<p>白種女子酷愛黄種男子的理由有一位具遠大眼光的歐洲婦人。愛上了一位漂亮的中國男子。在一個愛情達到沸點的時期。伊對着男子說。「親丨愛的。我是一個週游過世界的婦人。世界上的人種。我也看過狠多了。到了今天我才遇着你。你是我生平最親愛的。我不能離開你啊。」但是那位男子的思想。對於這種婦女的口頭禪。巳經成爲一種官樣文章想必爲了一時異性的接觸所致。從這位男子的經騐上所得到的。腦筋上所印着的。逃不了東方人是東方人。西方人是西方人。這兩方面的人們能如同一方了。那黄河的水就可以清了。所以那男子逼得他去向一位婦人道。「你所愛我的目的在那裏。我並且要先聲明。我是一位東方黄種人之中的中國人。請你不要把這問題忘了。</p>
<p>白種婦人回答他說。「我所愛你的。就是愛你的黄。你不知道檸檬的顔色麽。他不是黄的麽。是世界上的人們所統統愛的。他的顔色雅而帶美。他的性質堅而耐勞。有歷久不變的價值。爲水菓類中最高貴者。你也不要忘記你們的中國。乃東方文化的發源地。這種文化裏面的含着無窮的奥妙哲理。所以我們到中國來。要得到真正文化上的真理。非同你們貴國人士親近不可。」</p>
<p>免債與還錢　有一位英國牧師的朋友。向牧師借了幾塊錢。到了禮拜日。預備把錢還他。不料牧師正在禮拜堂做禮拜。口裏念着祈禱文道。「馬太福音第六章第十二節。」唱着「免我們的債。如同我們免了人的債。」做禮拜的男女們。一齊照樣的說着。那位還債的朋友。聽見了這篇祈禱文。心裏想這位英國牧師真是一個好人。他情願免了我的債。再想到家裏的小孩子病了。就把這筆錢移作看病的醫藥費罷。要是把錢還了牧師。那就無錢看病了。等到禮拜做完之後。牧師見了這位朋友。表示很快活。接連說着「你的欵子連同利息統統帶來麽。」那位還債的朋友向他說。「方才你聖經裏所說的是什麽。你明明說要免除我的債。是不是我欠你的錢。你放棄了麽。怪不得美國胡佛總統對待德國亦有這個意思了。是不是實行聖經上的經典麽。所以現在我用不着還你錢的原因。是要先給我的小孩子看病做醫藥啊。」那位牧師回答他說。「免了人家的債是可以的。但是你欠我的錢終要先還了我。你的小孩子有病。要買藥看醫生。是另外一種問題。與我毫無關係呢。」（却酬）</p>
<h3>書葉漢丞事</h3>
<p>— 陸鏡清</p>
<p>南匯葉漢丞君。爲留東先進。並係同盟會之優秀份子。歷年奔走革命。堪稱功在黨國。歐戰後。又負笈柏林。學識彌閎。旋獲博士學位。任柏林大學助敎民九回國。任北大講席。總理在粤。組織大元帥府。嘗鑒於北伐軍大本營技術上之機要。自民國十五年以還。長五洲固本皂藥廠事務。建樹方長。爲朋儕所稱道。日前爲先生賢伉儷大衍雙慶。當代俊彦。如于右任鈕永建葉楚傖邵力子馬君武將夢麐廉南湖陳陶遺諸君。咸屬舊交契友。發起爲先生祝嘏。黄任之君壽以詩云。「無端廿八年前事。九死翩翩幾少年。百計回一成大夢。拚將憂患餞華顛。斯人斯疾疑可藥辦理精神百感通。此意壽人兼自壽。　　百歲日方中。」按任之先生與葉君等。在光緒年間。咸熱忱黨國。努力灌輸文化於内地。喚醒民魂。期開風氣之先。不幸遭滿清官吏之嫉忌。幾爲革命犧牲。今也訪舊南沙。不無回首前塵之感云。</p>
<h3>愛情的分析</h3>
<p>— 雲影</p>
<p>大科學家能夠反科學的方法來分析解决宇宙間無限的難題。但從來没有一個人可以把「愛情」來下一個絶對的解釋。愛情原來是富有神秘性的一朶花。它産生在自然的園地之中。受着自然的灌溉。得到自然的生長。結成自然的果實。但不會自然的消滅。</p>
<p>愛情。不能把「引誘」做它的出發點。它的出發點應當是「同情」。</p>
<p>愛情。不能把「諂媚」做它的肥料。它的肥料應當是「真誠的慰藉」。</p>
<p>愛情。不能把金錢或者肉體等等物質的條件做它的目的。它的目的應當是「純潔的相互的扶植」。</p>
<p>愛情。不能把强權去掠奪。應當把公理來要求。</p>
<p>愛情。没有絲祚的勉强。完全是一種自然的啓發。</p>
<p>假若有一個男性。用恫嚇或誘騙的手段去强迫着一個女性爲　犧牲。這個决不是愛情。這到底是什麽呢。</p>
<p>假若在一對異性的中間。所賴以維繫着的。不是愛情。其結果將如何呢。</p>
<p>假若一個男性。不懂得什麽是愛情。但是一個女性却不能不犧牲他的愛情。這究竟是什麽原故呢。</p>
<p>無論讀什麽百科全書。我們不能得到上面幾個問題的解釋罷。但是。只要我們有機會去一看明星影片公司的新片「殺人的小姐」的話。它一定能夠給你以十分確切的答案了。</p>
<p>我這篇文字。絶對不是爲「殺人的小姐」做宣傳。因爲我覺得這幾個問題的答案。除了「殺人的小姐」。能給我解釋以外。在旁的地方我就找不到了。所以我敢這樣來說。</p>
<h3>虞洽卿先生紀念會拾零</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>海上鉅商虞洽卿氏旅滬五十周紀念大會。巳於前昨兩日在大華飯店舉行。裝璜富麗。儀式隆重。以畢身事業有功社會國家之虞氏當之。誠無愧色。愚躬逢斯盛。見聞所及。輒多趣屑。摘述一二。以嚮閱者。</p>
<p>同鄉大會　紀念會每日簽到之來賓。均在六千人以上。雖外賓及各省人士頗不少。然十之八九爲寗波人。演說者多數操寗波語。賓客交談。亦復如之。或謂此舉不啻一同鄉大會。王外長謂虞先生不獨爲寗波之寗波人。浙江之寗波人。亦中國之寗波人。其意深可玩味。</p>
<p>演詞誌趣　慶祝會中之演說。以第一日爲最有精采。且各就其所處之地位而言。如張巿長謂虞先生五十年努力於上海之企業界·金融界·與大上海建設助力尤大。王外長謂虞氏之成功在努力。爲事業·爲社會·爲國家。刻刻努力。時時努力。繼續努力至五十年。才有今日之成功。袁履登所講與航業有關。林康侯自稱小弟弟。謂虞年六十五。我年五十六。設各以五十年丢開。則余僅六齡。豈非小弟弟乎。大意則與銀行業有關。葉惠鈞謂虞氏十五歲赤脚來上海。努力五十年。事業雖成功。而仍爲一窮光蛋。還是赤脚朋友。虞先生從來不搭架子。有時回寗波。坐三等艙位。與水手西崽爲伍。而從未聞洋人以「達姆富爾」取笑也。聞者均捧腹。</p>
<p>吃飯問題　來賓旣多。吃飯自難解决。此佳統由鄧脫摩飯店包辦。兩日間計西菜一萬二千客。該飯店原有西崽只四十人。此次因工作不敷分配。向各餐館拉夫。添雇百餘人。一律穿D　M　C新號衣。惟因臨時新編。指揮頗難。賓客就餐。原爲立食。Buffet　Lunch）大華意大利廳中置十餘排長桌。男女老幼。分據桌旁。立而食。笑聲雜沓。不少次趣。在外國千人以上之大宴會或園游會。常有所謂立食者。在我國尚屬創舉。客有久待而不得食者。紛起爭奪。秩序大亂。維持秩序之商團團員。宣佈戒嚴。侍役搬菜。派員護送。亦趣事也。</p>
<p>舞興不佳　晚九時。舞塲樂聲大作。觀衆包圍四周。均欲一覘交際之舞。塲中國天一公司佈强烈之電燈。攝製影片。一般舞侣。見之有難色。即跳舞組主任洽老之孫女岫雲女士。亦未見出塲。獨洽老之快壻江一平君。擁一二八佳人作狐步之舞。意興甚濃。其夫人淡如女士。爲之怏怏不樂</p>
<p>一般統計　此會在海上可謂空前盛舉。各部職員。計三百五十餘人。參觀劵發出八千餘張。紀念章一萬二千枚。所收禮欵逾十萬元。悉充三北醫院開辦費。禮物二千餘件。以銀盾·銀杯·幛·聯。爲多。啤酒一項。共飲四百餘打。益利·攝生·兩種汽水。共三千餘打。天熱·此項飲料尤爲來賓消暑所必需者。昨汽車游行。工部局初允以五十輛爲限。一路續有加入。竟超過二百輛以上。浩浩蕩蕩。若活虎神龍。所過之處。交通斷絶。巿民歎爲奇觀。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>？？？（二○）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>夫人說罷，就輕輕出去了，靜了不多一刻，前面房裏，聲浪又高。</p>
<p>「潘先生身子不舒服，躺在床上麽？」</p>
<p>「是的，他在後房休息着。」</p>
<p>「我要去見他！」</p>
<p>子良心頭亂跳，宛如病人遇了催命鬼了，也來不及躱避。</p>
<p>「潘先！你身子不舒服麽？我們久違了。」</p>
<p>「是！」</p>
<p>「你有什麽不舒服？」</p>
<p>子良一想：我除了厭你們兩個會鬧的人，此外也没有什麽不舒服，所以眼晴對夫人看看，差不多說：你爲什麽說我有病呢？</p>
<p>「頭痛麽？」</p>
<p>子良點點頭。其實他的頭一些不痛，不過以爲見了你們兩位女將，實在頭痛，所以點點頭，表示對的，</p>
<p>「肚子痛不痛？」</p>
<p>子良只得揺頭了，一想：你不要像醫生那麽胃口如何？大小解如何？一樣樣問起來，那是我很好的身體，當真也要生病了。</p>
<p>「單單頭痛麽？那是容易得很！」</p>
<p>伊說了這麽一句，又回頭向夫人：</p>
<p>「你呌娘姨拏一杯開水上來！」</p>
<p>夫人當真呌娘姨倒一杯開水來，子良不明白伊什麽用意，難道伊會推拿麽？只見伊從身邊摸出一個小小的玻璃瓶來，取去瓶塞，將瓶内的白色藥片，倒兩片在書桌上：</p>
<p>「這是專治頭痛的靈藥，我常常吃的，可稱百發百中，你把這兩片，用開水送下，不到十分鐘，頭就不痛了。」</p>

<h3>Statement from Korean Residents in Harbin Denying Maltreatment</h3>
<p>Japanese Incite Korean Residents to Riot</p>
<p>False Claims of Chinese Seeking Revenge</p>
<p>(Harbin) Negotiator Zhong is going to Jilin to negotiate with Japanese Consul Ishii regarding the Wanbaoshan Incident. Korean residents in Harbin telegraphed their home country stating that Chinese have not mistreated them. The Japanese are inciting Korean residents in Harbin to riot, claiming that Chinese will seek revenge for the Incheon incident. Many Koreans are thus relocating to avoid trouble. Various circles in Harbin are preparing to issue a statement regarding the riots in Korea and will also telegraph Zhang Weicheng, the Korean Consul-General, to inquire about the truth. The Japanese Consul in Harbin hosted a large banquet for Zhang Jinghui and others to foster friendly relations. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Japanese Ambitions in the Wanbaoshan Incident are Obvious</p>
<p>Using the Pretext of Chinese Officials Oppressing Korean Farmers</p>
<p>Planning to Seize Korean Land Use Rights</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes the direct cause of the Korean Incident is the oppression of Korean farmers by Chinese officials in Manchuria. It has decided to fundamentally resolve the issue of Koreans in Manchuria at this time to eliminate such disputes. Currently, various discussions are underway. It is reported that the policy adopted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is roughly as follows: To resolve the current pending issues, first order Japanese officials in Manchuria to investigate the actual situation in the areas where disputes occurred and collect materials for negotiations with the Chinese side. It is necessary to negotiate with the Chinese side to establish a foundation for the stable residence of Korean farmers in Manchuria. The livelihood of one million Korean farmers in Manchuria is a major issue in Japan's national policy. It is necessary to establish the land use rights and residence rights of these Korean farmers as a fundamental solution to this problem. This matter may be raised for discussion during negotiations on extraterritoriality, or resolving this matter may be made a prerequisite for negotiations on extraterritoriality. (12th Reuter’s Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Consul-General Lin returned to Shenyang at 6:20 this morning and told reporters that the Wanbaoshan Incident will be negotiated after Zhang Zuoxiang returns to Shenyang. The oppression of Koreans, especially in Jilin Province of the Northeast, is quite severe. Regulations such as the permission to operate paddy fields and the contracts for employing Koreans are examples of oppression of Koreans found in the laws and regulations. We will lodge a serious protest regarding this point. However, the treatment of Koreans varies in different regions. It is ineffective to negotiate only on the regulations. Factual understanding is necessary. To fundamentally solve the problem of Koreans in Manchuria, I believe there is no other way than to naturalize Koreans as Chinese citizens. Once the naturalization issue is resolved, the misconception that Koreans will be the vanguard of Japanese aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia will disappear. (12th Reuter’s Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Country Without External Enemies Will Always Perish</h3>
<p>Since the Wanbaoshan Incident, the Japanese garrison in Korea has been increasing one after another, and drastic anti-Chinese actions have occurred in various parts of Korea. In the Dalian area, the Japanese Air Force is actively conducting defense exercises, and the Japanese army along the South Manchuria Railway is fully equipped and ready to move, eager to try. Therefore, commentators say that the occurrence of the Wan Incident was by no means accidental. At the same time, based on Foreign Minister Shidehara's instruction to the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang, "The Japanese government, from the standpoint of protecting Japanese expatriates in Manchuria, has no choice but to take appropriate measures, and the results may lead to extremely serious situations," and Chief of Staff Kanaya's statement that "Japan's current national defense operations should be based on mainland operations," commentators also believe that the occurrence of the Wan Incident is the beginning of the Japanese eagerly seeking to realize their mainland policy. What more active actions will the Japanese take in the future? We dare not make a rash judgment. However, it is a fact that in this serious situation, external troubles can be triggered at any time, and major disputes can occur at any time. We really cannot but think deeply and calmly.</p>
<p>Whenever a problem arises, even if it is overwhelming and extremely urgent, our people should first think: Is my country incurable? Sixty years ago, a few black ships broke through the national gate, and the great powers threatened and forced the signing of treaties. Under the stimulation of external troubles, the Japanese people rose up in unison and began the Meiji Restoration. Sixty years later, it leapt to become a powerful country that dominates East Asia and stares at the world. Who can say that my country is incurable? Is my country absolutely not to be worried about? Then India and Korea, from the court to the public, enjoyed peace and poisoned themselves, ignored external troubles, and indulged in internal strife, until they perished. These are our recent examples. Who can ensure that my country can safely pass through the storm in a precarious situation? It is said that "a country without external enemies will always perish." We deeply feel the profound meaning of these words. But the enemy can revive us, and our country can truly destroy us. Whether it perishes or not depends on us, not on the enemy. It all depends on the thoughts of our people. Therefore, it is said that "misfortune and happiness are impermanent, and only people bring it on themselves." When times are dangerous and the situation is pressing, the people of the country should think carefully.</p>

<h3>Extreme Panic Felt in German Financial Circles</h3>
<p>Political Situation Also Shaken</p>
<p>Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting All Night</p>
<p>Substantial Concessions to French Demands Expected</p>
<p>Presenting the Urgent Financial Situation to the United States</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 11th</h3>
<p>After receiving a report from Dr. Luther, President of the Reichsbank, the government convened a cabinet meeting today, which lasted for several hours. However, the content of the meeting has not yet been disclosed. Dr. Luther must rush to Basel tomorrow morning to participate in the board meeting of the Bank for International Settlements. As for whether Germany's loan, which expires on July 16, will be extended, it will depend on the outcome of the Basel meeting. Furthermore, Dr. Luther has denied all the amounts rumored in the newspapers regarding Germany's request for loans, dismissing them as unfounded. Luther once told people that Germany's hope is to maintain the amount of economic equilibrium. All other external rumors about Germany's various extravagant expectations are not worth a knowing smile.</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 12th</h3>
<p>German finances are on the verge of exhaustion and are currently making every effort to raise 300 million gold dollars from abroad to alleviate the immediate crisis. The cabinet has held an emergency meeting to discuss rescue measures. It is now believed that only prompt action by American banking circles can save the collapse of Berlin's financial circles. It is heard that Dr. Luther, president of the Deutsche Bank, will go to England and France to jointly discuss borrowing 300 million gold dollars. However, it is widely rumored that Prime Minister Brüning and Hindenburg are willing to resign to apologize to the people rather than submit to France's demands of giving up the German-Austrian tax agreement and suspending payment for pocket battleships. Yesterday, 100 million marks of foreign loans were withdrawn from Berlin's financial market, making the financial situation even more precarious. Many criticized France for deliberately proposing loans in England, forcing the British to withdraw loans from the German market. Last night, at 6:00 PM, the German government convened a cabinet meeting, and all cabinet members looked worried. After adjourning at 8:00 PM, it reopened at 10:00 PM and did not end until 3:00 AM. According to reliable sources, the cabinet decided that it would be impossible to accept the current French demands. If they can be modified, they are willing to compromise. The German government is willing to postpone the construction of the third pocket battleship indefinitely, but the second one cannot be stopped. It has rejected France's coercion to abandon the German-Austrian tax agreement. However, for the sake of European peace and friendship, it is also willing to discuss the final sacrifice. As for the 300 million US dollar foreign debt, if it cannot be raised on time, the final rescue method has also been discussed. The content is roughly to announce a temporary suspension of payments for Germany's private domestic and foreign debts. The situation is very serious. If this foreign debt cannot be raised by Tuesday, the financial position of several large banks will be shaken immediately. The American ambassador has telegraphed Washington, requesting the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States to provide assistance, stating that if loans cannot be obtained quickly, the collapse of financial circles will be inevitable. However, the Associated Press has verified that the US Federal Reserve Board has stated that American banking circles will consider Germany's ability to stop the outflow of domestic capital abroad as the standard for future loans to Germany.</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 12th</h3>
<p>Before the welcome for the completion of the Hoover Plan had ended, Germany's renewed worries are following closely. In the political sphere, everyone looks worried. Due to the distress of the national economy, the fate of the Brüning cabinet is once again in danger. The reason for this is that the conditions that France has added to the international group to assist Germany's economic position are too harsh. According to the latest information, in addition to demanding that Germany abandon the construction of pocket battleships and suspend the German-Austrian customs agreement, France also wants to organize an international group to manage German finances. This kind of coercion is tantamount to canceling Germany's status as an independent country. The current government knows that if it recognizes any of these conditions, or recognizes all of them, the Brüning cabinet can be overthrown immediately, and Hitler will succeed him as the Prime Minister of Germany. After that, the tide of Red ideology will spread throughout the country, and revolution and bloodshed will inevitably follow. However, on the one hand, what the government currently lacks is financial assistance. If neighboring countries do not show understanding and allow the situation to deteriorate naturally, the result will be the same as the above. Therefore, Germany is in a dilemma. It depends on how the Prime Minister's iron fist will resist the raging waves of national socialism on the left and reject the angry waves of communist forces on the right.</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, London, 11th</h3>
<p>Judging from the major British newspapers, the British government does not seem to intend to assist France's attempt to seize political concessions from Germany by taking advantage of its economic crisis. For example, the London Daily Telegraph stated that the British government has declared that there has never been any political condition for Germany to recognize in connection with economic assistance to Germany. Other newspapers, such as the Daily Herald, also denounced political coercion in general.</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, New York, 11th</h3>
<p>New York bankers stated today that Germany's financial circles will not be able to obtain American loans again unless their position improves after domestic tightening and restriction of loans. They also said that if German banks recover their foreign loans, they will be able to assist the government and tide over the current crisis.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Berlin, 12th</h3>
<p>It is learned that Germany has not yet requested emergency loans from the United States, but has notified the US government of the seriousness of Germany's situation if it does not immediately raise the necessary funds. The cabinet is still meeting at noon today and has not yet made any decisions.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Berlin, 11th</h3>
<p>The German government has appealed to the United States and other relevant countries for assistance through diplomatic channels and has explained the urgency of Germany's financial situation. The German cabinet is currently discussing the report of Dr. Luther, President of the Reichsbank, and has not adjourned as of 11:00 PM tonight.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Cologne, 11th</h3>
<p>When Dr. Luther's plane refueled here, a Reuters reporter visited him. Luther stated that the rumors about the amount of money he had mentioned during negotiations in London and Paris were exaggerated and unfounded. However, Luther refused to announce how much Germany actually needed.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Berlin, 11th</h3>
<p>The German Reichsbank has adopted stricter loan restriction measures and is accepting fewer bills of exchange. It is expected that the withdrawal of foreign currency today will reach 90 million marks, twice as much as yesterday.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Washington, 11th</h3>
<p>After receiving alarming reports on Germany's financial situation, the discussion in political circles today is all about how to use American financial power to save Germany from a major financial panic. President Hoover and Acting Secretary of State Castle are both in Gancuetan and are in close contact with the situation. Officials say that the US president will take action to prevent a catastrophe from happening in Germany. However, the US government cannot act directly, and it is not clear what kind of measures the US president believes are feasible. According to non-official opinions, the methods of assisting Germany are probably limited to the following three: (1) The New York Federal Reserve Bank makes unlimited loans to the German Reichsbank; (2) Private banks lend large amounts of debt to Germany; (3) The Bank of England provides indirect loans through intermediaries.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Washington, 11th</h3>
<p>After consulting with Acting Secretary of State Castle, the White House issued a statement saying that President Hoover had not received any emergency communication from Germany regarding finances, nor had he been asked to negotiate with the Federal Reserve Board. It also stated that the executive branch has no power to command the Federal Reserve Board and does not want to persuade it. Today, the President did not exchange any telegrams with Germany. According to reports, the public does not entirely disbelieve the claim that Germany is seeking help from the United States. It is the public's opinion that Castle's article is intended to declare that the request made by Germany is entirely informal.</p>
<p>British Public Organizations Hold Peace Promotion Parade</p>
<p>Leaders of the Three Major Parties Give Speeches</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 11th</h3>
<p>The Peace Promotion Parade, jointly organized by the League of Nations Union of Britain and 60 other organizations, marched this afternoon. The number of people and the scope of the parade are unprecedented. As it passed through Albemarle Street, the leaders of Britain's three major parties, MacDonald, Baldwin, and George, successively gave speeches to the public, which were transmitted to the endless marching procession through loudspeakers and broadcast to the whole country by radio. MacDonald stated that the issue of disarmament is related to international affairs and cannot be achieved by one country alone. Countries should not rely solely on emotions but should provide concrete figures to prove their disarmament. Baldwin said that other countries do not promote disarmament as much as Britain. He hoped that the United States would cooperate with the League of Nations to reconcile the relationship between national interests and disarmament issues. George said that since the Treaty of Locarno, the worship of the god of peace has never been as fervent as it is today. He hoped that the various political parties in Britain would unite on the issue of disarmament and strive to inspire people to know that the moral principles of personal behavior should be applied to the needs of national governments. The conference passed a resolution amidst loud cheers, requesting the government to do its best at the next disarmament conference to promote global disarmament.</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, London, 11th</h3>
<p>Prime Minister MacDonald, Conservative Party leader Baldwin, and Liberal Party leader George spoke tonight in Albert Hall on the relationship of disarmament, with tens of thousands of listeners. It was the first time that the leaders of the three parties gathered together to give speeches to the public. At the same time, many people gathered in Hyde Park to listen to the great theories of the three leaders through specially set up loudspeakers. Most of the listeners were women, who lined up carrying flags, led by military bands to the venue.</p>
<p>Italy and France to Reopen Naval Negotiations Soon</p>
<p>Stimson and Italian Foreign Minister...</p>
<p>Continue to Discuss Disarmament Issues</p>
<h3>Guomin News Agency, Rome, 11th</h3>
<p>At a time when Italian naval negotiations are showing hope of reopening, US Secretary of State Stimson has accepted the invitation of Italian Foreign Minister Grandi to visit the Castel Gandolfo on the coast of Lake Albano for a weekend. It is heard that the two will continue to discuss disarmament issues on the coast. Therefore, the general public believes that after Stimson goes to Paris, France and Italy will reopen naval negotiations, suspending the naval competition between the two countries for a year so that it will be easier to compromise at next year's disarmament conference.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Rome, 11th</h3>
<p>The Italian government has accepted the British government's request and agreed to send representatives to the London expert meeting on July 17 to discuss the problems arising from the suspension of debt payments. In its reply, the Italian government stated that it would instruct its representatives to assist the meeting in every possible way. It also said that the Italian government did not want to demand compensation from Germany that was due on July 15.</p>

<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices, please take note: It is reported that Korean farmers at Wanbaoshan forcibly reclaimed paddy fields, causing conflicts with our Chinese people. The Japanese government even dispatched garrison troops and police to massacre our Chinese people. This is an open and violent act of aggression that has been recognized by the world. All of our people are filled with indignation. Wherever our compatriots in Incheon, Pyongyang, and other places in Korea have set foot, Japanese imperialists have instigated Korean people to carry out cruel and brutal anti-Chinese movements. Nearly ten days have passed, and the matter has not yet ended. The harm and losses to the lives and property of our compatriots cannot be counted. This is unprecedented in any country without laws or order. Moreover, under the strict police rule of Japan in Korea, there is no doubt that this is an exposure of the Japanese government's planned and organized policy of aggression against China. If this can be tolerated, what kind of nation are we? International justice will be destroyed in the world. With the responsibility of national survival and the hatred of the enemy, in addition to directly telegraphing the Central Government, we have requested that a strong protest be lodged immediately, that the rioters be severely punished, that the affected compatriots be compensated, that all losses be compensated, and that it be guaranteed that the same incident will not happen again. We also ask that all effective methods of protecting overseas Chinese be implemented immediately. We hereby send this telegram for your information, hoping that comrades from all regions and compatriots from all over the country will rise up together and vow to fight to the death to uphold justice and safeguard national rights. We eagerly await your response and are filled with intense grief and anger. Sincerely, the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Hebei Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee</h3>
<p>To all ministries, courts, and councils of the Nanjing National Government, all levels of party headquarters, all levels of government, and all newspaper offices, please take note: Recently, we sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, which stated: "To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: Urgently, in the Wanbaoshan area of Changchun County, Jilin, Korean residents, under the instigation of the Japanese, arbitrarily dug ditches and built dams that were seven or eight zhang wide and more than twenty li long, destroying more than a hundred xiang of our fertile farmland for no reason. The local farmers believe that the land belongs to us, and if the ditch is dug, the river water will overflow, and thousands of xiang of farmland along the ditch will be flooded. Moreover, the waterway in this area is a convenient channel, and if the dam is built, transportation will be cut off for hundreds of households along the river, and the residents will have no livelihood. Because this concerns their lives and families, there is no way to save themselves but to fight to the death. After repeated negotiations, the Japanese had other intentions and were arrogant and unreasonable. Not only did they not talk about reason and law, but they also sent armed police to assist in digging and building. The turmoil was expanded by the Japanese, and Foreign Minister Shidehara issued a telegram expressing protest and hinting at a second Jinan Incident. In recent days, the situation has become increasingly urgent. The Japanese have already fired thirty or more shots, killing more than a dozen of our farmers. The signs of disaster have already appeared. If such misery and persecution can still be tolerated, what is a nation? The Japanese have been operating in the Eastern Provinces for a long time and have been planning and plotting for a long time. They regard the Eastern Provinces as something in their pocket, which is now completely exposed. If a comprehensive countermeasure is not urgently determined, the future will be unimaginable. For this reason, we submit this telegram earnestly, earnestly urging the National Government to strictly supervise the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lodge the most serious protest, and thoroughly plan comprehensive countermeasures. We send this telegram with sadness and anger, and cannot bear our urgency. May you unite and rise up to save the nation together. Most sincerely, the Hebei Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee."</p>
<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>A Review and Prospect of the Pacific International Academic Society (III) (Continued) Bin</h3>
<p>(3) The Importance of the Third Conference</p>
<p>The Third Conference in the autumn of 1929 was held in Nara, Kyoto, Japan. The significance of this conference was the heated and serious discussion of the "Three Eastern Provinces Problem," which is related to the peace of East Asia and the world. In this heated and serious discussion, the representatives of our country made every effort to argue and debate, elaborating on the fact that unequal treaties had caused persecution in our country, and pointing out the Japanese conspiracy to annex our Northeast. This allowed representatives from various countries to have a considerable understanding of the current situation in this New China. The actual situation of Japan's aggression against our Northeast was also exposed to the world. The outline of the Third Conference is listed as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Outline of the Third Conference</p>
<p>Date: October 28 to November 9, 1929</p>
<p>Participating Countries: Australia, Britain, Canada, China, Japan, New Ceylon, the United States, etc.</p>
<p>List of Chinese Representatives</p>
<p>Zhou Tianfang, Wang Ziwen, Yan Baohang, Su Shangda, Ning Encheng, Wang Huibo, Dong Qizheng, Nan Bingfang, Tao Menghe, Cao Yanshen, Xu Shushi, Bao Mingqian, Chen Hengzhe, Wu Daquan, Zhang Boling, He Lian, Xu Baoqian, Zeng Baosun, Gui Zhiliang, Wu Yifang, Liu Dajun, Li Yinglin, Xia Jinlin, Pan Guangdan, Wen Peishan, Zeng Rongpu, Dai Airu, Chen Liting, Yu Rizhang, Wang Shijing</p>
<p>Important Issues</p>
<p>(1) The relationship between mechanical civilization and traditional culture (2) Industrialization problems (3) Population and food problems (4) Transportation problems (5) Pacific diplomatic relations problems (6) Foreign investment problems (7) The Three Eastern Provinces Problem (8) Chinese diplomatic problems</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>It can be seen that half of the eight issues of this conference were Chinese issues, and the others were academic discussions. Moreover, the issues related to China are all practical issues that should be actively resolved at present. Therefore, in the conference agenda, the discussion of Chinese issues occupied nearly half of the conference time. The consular jurisdiction and concession issues are obviously unreasonable, unequal, and detrimental to our country's sovereignty. Moreover, foreign nationals from Russia, Germany, Austria, and other countries can live and work in China in peace under the protection of legal rights. After the recovery of the Hankou and Xunyang concessions, the foreign nationals in the two places were also very peaceful. This further demonstrates that there is no reason to continue to retain consular jurisdiction and concessions. However, the representatives of the Pacific Conference countries, who were standing on the position of people's diplomacy, unanimously advocated postponing the handling of the issues. The discussion of the Three Eastern Provinces Problem continued for three days. The Japanese representatives consistently maintained a stubborn attitude consistent with their government and engaged in unreasonable debates, acting as spokespersons for their government. They even said that it was their country's legitimate right to invade our Northeast, and that our country's opposition to invasion was a crime against justice. Their tyrannical and unreasonable attitude fundamentally deviated from the position of people's diplomacy. As a result, the achievements of this conference failed to have a good impact on the future of national relations in the Pacific. The original intention and spirit of convening the conference were therefore in vain. This is what we deeply regret.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the Wanbaoshan Incident in Changchun</h3>
<p>Inspection of Majiashaokou</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The case of Korean farmers planting rice in Wanbaoshan, Changchun, which shocked the country, became an important diplomatic case after the conflict on July 2. Japanese newspapers promoted and exaggerated it and made unreasonable records. I went to Changchun on the evening of the 4th to investigate the truth and went to Majiashao, the scene of the incident, and obtained the following results.</p>
<h3>Truth of the Second Day Incident</h3>
<p>In May of this year, the Wanbao Mountain incident occurred, becoming entangled and unresolved. The farmers repeatedly urged the government to resolve it, but the Japanese consul-general always used the excuse of maintaining the vested interests of Koreans to refuse to stop the trench-digging work. Recently, the trenches have become several *zhang* (丈, ~3 meters) deep and twenty *li* (里, ~0.5 km) long. The dam construction at Majia Sentinel Post was successful, and water had already begun to flow into the newly dug trenches. The Japanese consulate-general intensified its work, urging the Koreans to complete it by the end of June. Due to the damming of the Yitong River downstream, the upstream water level deepened daily, reaching within a foot of overflowing the banks. The farmers, already pained by the digging on their good farmland, feared that their crops would be flooded. Farmers from two or three districts with vested interests, led by village chiefs, decided on June 30th that on the morning of July 1st, each household would send one able-bodied man to gather at Yaowo Fort to automatically fill the drainage ditches. On that day, they also slaughtered a pig and smeared blood, jointly swearing an oath to resist the Japanese police to the end. On the morning of July 1st at 6:00 AM, farmers from dozens of villages in the Wanbao Mountain area gathered at Yaowo Fort, totaling over 700 people. Each carried hoes and shovels, led by representatives Qu Xianglou and Sun Rongqing, bearing large banners of white cloth inscribed in red characters on all four sides, reading: "The cultivated land related to the lives and livelihoods of us all has been cut in two by illegally dug ditches, harming everyone's work. We have repeatedly petitioned the government, but to no avail. Forced to do so, we have decided to take matters into our own hands and implement legitimate self-defense measures, on the one hand, restoring the original state for cultivation, and on the other hand, requesting the government to order the illegal persons to compensate for the damages. This is a public declaration to make known to all. Announced by the victims of the Wanbao Mountain farmland." At approximately 7:00 AM, they arrived at the bank of the Yitong River at the former Majia Sentinel Post. The Koreans were still building the dam, and there were six Japanese police officers at the scene monitoring. After the farmers arrived, they planted the banners on the ground and immediately began filling the ditches and destroying the dam in sections. Fifteen *li* of ditches were filled, and the dam was completely destroyed. At that time, the Japanese police officers stepped forward to block them, questioning their reasons. The farmer representatives replied that they were filling the ditches to facilitate cultivation and were not there to cause a fight. The Japanese police officers, finding themselves in the wrong, were at a loss for words. One of them suddenly grabbed the representative's sleeve and butted him in the head. Another lay down in the ditch, acting like a rogue. However, the farmers continued their work. By 12:00 PM, the ditch had been filled, and the farmers lined up and left. Before leaving, the Japanese police officers asked if they would come again tomorrow. The representatives replied that they would still come. When asked how many people would come, they replied, "Today 700, tomorrow 1,000." The Japanese police officers angrily said that if 1,000 came tomorrow, they should bring 1,000 coffins. "My empire will dispatch troops tonight. Airplanes, cannons, machine guns, and bombs are all ready. If 1,000 come, 1,000 will die, not a single one will return alive." After the farmers left, the Japanese police officers immediately sent a message by carrier pigeon to the Japanese consulate-general, urgently requesting reinforcements. On the morning of the 2nd, 30 Japanese police officers arrived, carrying rifles, pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition, led by the chief of the Japanese police station, Nakagawa Yoshiharu. They dispersed to the left and right of the drainage ditch. At approximately 8:00 AM, farmers from various villages were still gathering, carrying hoes. They arrived at Majia Sentinel Post. The Japanese police chief, Nakagawa, led armed police to block them head-on, seeking to speak with representatives. More than ten people, including Sun Rongqing and Qu Xianglou, came forward. Nakagawa asked why they were filling the dam and when they would stop this movement. Sun and others replied as before, stating that they would stop the movement when the original state was restored. Seeing that Sun and others' replies were very firm, Nakagawa's expression suddenly changed. He shouted, ordering the Japanese police to tie up Sun Rongqing. Four or five Japanese police officers dragged Sun away, pulling him toward the tent. The general farmers, seeing this, were greatly angered and swarmed forward, surrounding the Japanese police and snatching Sun back. At this time, the Japanese police opened fire, firing into the air as a warning. The farmers were in an uproar, retreating about a *li*. More than a hundred of them, whose homes were closer, ran back to retrieve guns, using the He family's house walls at the former Majia Sentinel Post as cover, returning fire. They held their ground for a while, but there were no casualties. At that time, the chief of the third branch of the county public security bureau, Tian Xigu, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene with police, braving the rain of bullets to mediate with the farmers, persuading them to stop firing. Some of the farmers, excessively angered, actually struck Tian, breaking Tian's left shoulder with a steel hoe. However, Tian still endured the pain and tried his best to dissuade them. The farmers were slightly moved and stopped firing. On the Japanese police side, Tian also risked going to persuade them to stop. By 10:00 AM, the main body of farmers was still retreating. This was the actual situation of the conflict on July 2nd.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Dig Trenches to Prepare for War</h3>
<p>After the conflict on the 2nd, the Japanese consulate-general received the report and continuously dispatched armed police to the scene. They also transported two light machine guns, one handheld machine gun, and dozens of boxes of ammunition by large carts, all under the command of Nakagawa Yoshiharu, for military deployment. They immediately built a trench two *li* long within the filled drainage ditch, turning the earth into a trench. They set up machine guns facing the Majia Sentinel Post village. At night, they placed one sentry with a rifle every few tens of paces. During the day, they used carrier pigeons to report the situation to the consulate-general. As of the 5th, the number of Japanese police had increased to 73. In addition to setting up one or two tents and sleeping in the open near the dam, a part of them, about 20 or so, led by Nakagawa, invaded the residence of Wang, a farmer in the former Majia Sentinel Post, driving out Wang's entire family of over 20 people and occupying his main house. Wang's family members all moved elsewhere. Only the head of the household and his brother requested permission from the Japanese side to remain in the house to take care of everything, but they had to perform odd jobs for the Japanese police every day. The He family's residence on the left was also invaded and occupied by Koreans. The women and able-bodied men all moved to other places, with only a few elderly and weak people remaining in the house. In the nearby farming villages, due to the Japanese police's strict preparations, the elderly, young, and women all moved to distant places in advance, with each household guarded by able-bodied men. Since the 2nd, the road to the section of Jianbao-Qian Majia Sentinel Post, spanning ten *li*, was devoid of travelers. All the actions of the Japanese police were spied on by the farmers and reported to the representatives of each village twice a day. At the Majia Sentinel Post on the Yitong River, there was originally a ferry operated by farmers, dedicated to ferrying villagers back and forth on the east and west banks. Each year, each village contributed a certain amount of money to it. The operator had been in the business for 30 years, relying on it for his family's livelihood. After July 2nd, he was driven out by the Japanese police, who seized the ferry. Traffic on both sides was thus cut off. More than 70 Korean able-bodied men, under the supervision of the Japanese police, were actively building dikes to block the water, fearing that the farmers would come again to destroy them. They changed to using willow branches interspersed with sand and soil, stacked together and surrounded by wooden stakes, making them extremely solid. All the willows on both banks of the Yitong River, both upstream and downstream, were cut down completely for construction materials. However, the Koreans were beaten and scolded if they worked even slightly slowly. Those who feared hardship took the opportunity to escape. Originally, there were 188 men, women, old, and young. Currently, apart from the 72 able-bodied men working at the Majia Sentinel Post, the women, old, and young are living near the Wanbao Mountain farm. Furthermore, farmers in each village, because the Japanese side's dike-building work did not stop, and the upstream water level increased daily, feared that if there was heavy rain in the coming days, four or five thousand *qing* (頃, ~6.67 hectares) of fields along the banks would be flooded. Therefore, they were extremely indignant and spontaneously established the Wanbao Mountain Farmers' Foreign Affairs Support Association. Each household contributed at least one able-bodied man, forming a united village association, electing four directors and 30 executive members to confront the Japanese and requesting the government to take charge as soon as possible. On one hand, they sent people to spy on the actions of the Japanese police. If the Korean people continued to dig drainage ditches within the day, or the Yitong River flooded due to the construction of the dike, the farmers would inevitably fight the Japanese police. The Japanese police had already heard this news and specially buried landmines on both sides of the drainage ditch. Therefore, the current situation is still extremely dangerous.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Majia Sentinel Post</h3>
<p>I arrived in Changchun at 7:30 AM on the 5th. After visiting the county government, public security bureau, county farmers' association, and municipal preparatory office and obtaining detailed information, and considering that Majia Sentinel Post was the site of the Sino-Japanese conflict, I specially requested the municipal office to send someone to guide me there. In addition to notifying the Japanese consulate-general, the municipal office sent three people to accompany me: translator Zhou Wuxiang, and guards Zhang Wanchun and Li Chengye. At 6:30 AM on the morning of the 6th, led by village representatives Qu Xianglou and Sun Jiayuan, we set off on horseback. At approximately 9:00 AM, we passed the upper reaches of the Yitong River. The place was 18 *li* away from the Majia Sentinel Post, where the dike was being built. However, the water was already high, and the river had widened. The place where the water was usually shallow enough for vehicles and horses to wade through was no longer passable. The group stopped their horses on the riverbank, hesitating for a long time, with no way to pass. Finally, they risked whipping their horses across, but the water was already above the horses' bellies, and the entire group's clothing was soaked. After crossing the river, we encountered farmers along the way reporting on the situation at Majia Sentinel Post in an endless stream. At noon, we rested at Qu Xianglou's house in Jianbao, and the people and horses had a light meal. At 12:10 PM in the afternoon, we continued forward, passing Cun Jin Fort. We were close to Majia Sentinel Post, and there were fewer and fewer pedestrians. Finally, at 1:50 PM in the afternoon, we arrived at the rear Majia Sentinel Post. From horseback, we could see the Japanese police in yellow uniforms, going back and forth, appearing very busy. The group stopped at the residence of Wang Jia San, a farmer. A farmer held a note and went forward. The reporter and Zhou Wuxiang followed behind, walking to the Japanese police station at Majia Sentinel Post. The farmer handed the note to the Japanese police officer residing in Wang's farmhouse. After Nakagawa Yoshiharu inspected it, he made no expression. The reporter then went straight in. At that time, Nakagawa and Takahashi Hiroki of the Japanese consulate-general were sitting on the *kang* (炕, heated brick bed). Seeing the reporter come in, they jumped down and shook hands. After exchanging pleasantries, the reporter stated that news reporters have no international views and that he had come purely to investigate the truth. At this point, Nakagawa immediately stated his mission in the area without being asked, which was translated by Takahashi Hiroki. The general idea was that on July 1st, Chinese farmers gathered in large numbers to fill the dike and destroy the ditch, almost causing a conflict with the Koreans. He had been ordered by the consul to lead the police to protect the work of the Korean people. On the morning of the 2nd, Chinese farmers came again. They were deeply afraid of rioting because they were raising banners and shouting. He had also seen Sun Rongqing carrying a handgun, so he had dragged him to confiscate his weapon. Other farmers opened fire at the Japanese police as a warning. The Japanese police also fired into the air. Later, they were persuaded by the branch bureau chief to stop firing. There were no deaths or injuries on either side. This was an extremely small problem, and they sincerely hoped it could be resolved satisfactorily as soon as possible so that they could return to Changchun. They were currently living in this house because the owner had voluntarily invited them. The daily needs they consumed were all brought by themselves and did not cost the owner a cent. They would also need the consul's order to withdraw in the future. Takahashi Hiroki also said that there were a total of 47 Japanese police officers. Although the ferry had been taken over by the Japanese police, the original owner was given 200 *diao* (吊, string of cash coins) per day (six *jiao* [角, ~0.1 yuan] in Shanghai silver dollars) as compensation. Because the dike prevented ships from traveling directly upstream and downstream, goods could be transferred between them, and any losses would be compensated by the Japanese. 45 *mu* (畝, ~0.067 hectares) of rice fields had already been planted in Wanbao Mountain. A total of 120 Koreans, several of whom had been deported by the Chinese police. While he was speaking, three farmers from the house came into the room to retrieve items and were scolded out by Takahashi. The reporter could not help but feel a pang of sadness. During the conversation, Nakagawa ordered the Japanese police to bring beer and soda to show goodwill. He opened a bottle and repeatedly urged the others to drink, and they each drank a glass. Afterwards, at the reporter's request, they went to inspect the drainage ditch and dam. Nakagawa agreed, and Takahashi led the way. The dam was about a *li* away from Wang's farmhouse. The water had already been forced back, with a difference of nearly five *chi* (尺, ~0.3 meters) in water level between the upstream and downstream. The dike was over 1 *zhang* high, 7 *chi* wide, and 3 *zhang* long. Both ends had been completed, with only the middle not yet finished. Dozens of Koreans were cutting willow branches and tying them with hemp rope, and using hemp sacks to fill with soil and pile on the dike. It could be completed in a few more days. However, although the water level had risen, it was still far from the entrance of the drainage ditch. The drainage ditch was 8 *chi* deep but had been leveled by the farmers and had not yet been dug through. Even if it were dug through, it would still need to be deepened to 1.5 or 2 *zhang*. Therefore, this clumsy project could be said to be unwise. The filled drainage ditch was shaped into a trench, winding for two *li*. Three Japanese police tents were set up next to the ditch. Many Japanese soldiers were resting inside, glaring at the reporter with fierce eyes and hastily covering the machine guns with the tents. The reporter took several photos. At that time, a Japanese police officer secretly reported to Nakagawa that he should stop it. Nakagawa, because the reporter had obtained his permission in advance, was unable to go back on his word and shook his head to indicate that it was not possible. However, he told the reporter not to exaggerate the report after returning, so as not to lose the truth. After standing by the dam for a long time, they returned to Majia Sentinel Post. The general farmers, at first thinking that the group's trip would be dangerous, were all worried. When they saw them return safely, they all offered their congratulations. At approximately 3:00 PM, they departed from Majia Sentinel Post to return to the city. On the way, they encountered a rainstorm and took shelter at the Li family's farmhouse in Jianbao. They resumed their journey at 4:00 PM, and upon reaching the original ferry crossing on the Yitong River, the water level was too high to cross again. They urged their horses several *li* away and crossed under the Jiang Bridge. They did not return to the city until 9:00 PM. Wanbao Mountain had no Japanese police stationed there and was not currently a tense location, so they stopped going there. (July 8th)</p>
<h3>Korean Anti-Chinese Sentiment Spreads to Japan</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Osaka and Kanazawa Beaten</p>
<p>All Utensils and Objects Were Damaged</p>
<p>Osaka Dispatch: The Koreans' savage nature of abusing and killing overseas Chinese has gradually spread to the entire territory of Japan. Reports of Korean people destroying overseas Chinese residences and beating overseas Chinese have been heard daily. Such incidents have occurred in Osaka, Kanazawa, and Kobe. Although the Japanese local governments have expressed their utmost protection of overseas Chinese, they have turned a blind eye to the actions of the Korean people. Therefore, on the night of the 7th of this month, two barbershops run by overseas Chinese in the Kanazawa area, near Osaka Prefecture, were broken into by 23 Korean people from the surrounding area, each carrying weapons such as sticks and clubs. The overseas Chinese families, due to their lack of resistance, had 11 people beaten, with two severely injured and their lives in danger. The rioters also completely destroyed the houses and utensils. On the morning of the 8th, Zhou Jue, the consul in Kobe, rushed to inspect the damage and immediately protested to the Osaka local authorities. Also, at 11:00 PM on the night of the 8th, the home of Zhang Guoshun, an overseas Chinese residing in Zhuangzhong Street, Higashiyodogawa Ward, Osaka, was also broken into by more than a dozen Korean people, who smashed the doors and windows with stones and used sticks to beat Zhang to the ground. The utensils were completely damaged, and property was looted. Zhang was seriously injured and unconscious and was later taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. It is said that his life is in danger. By the time the police arrived, the rioters had fled without a trace. Korean people also repeatedly beat Chinese people on the streets. In fact, the Japanese are unable to protect overseas Chinese. There are no fewer than 300,000 Korean people currently residing in the Japanese mainland. The massacre of Chinese people could easily erupt. If the national government does not quickly find a way to effectively protect overseas Chinese, the overseas Chinese in Japan may suffer the same tragic fate as the overseas Chinese in Korea.

<h3>Korean Riots Affect Andong</h3>
<p>Escaped Overseas Chinese Describe the Tragic Situation of Compatriots in Korea</p>
<p>More Than 2,000 People Fled to Andong Alone</p>
<p>One Tattered Korean Garment Costs 300 Yen in Japanese Currency</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Verbally Agreed to Stop It, But It Was Still Ineffective</p>
<p>The Turmoil Extended to Sinuiju, Alarming Andong</p>
<p>The Chinese Consulate in Sinuiju Was Smashed by Korean People</p>
<p>Currently, All Sectors Have Begun to Raise Relief Funds for the Refugees</p>
<p>Andong Special Dispatch: In the Korean interior, unemployed Korean people have been entering the country as laborers, earning low wages and working diligently, causing resentment among the Chinese workers who fear being deprived of their livelihoods. They had long planned to expel them from the country, but had not had the opportunity until now. This time, the Wanbao Mountain incident spread from afar. A general group of malcontents used it as an excuse, instigating each other from all sides. The Japanese also deliberately fabricated rumors, exaggerating the matter. The fuse for the massacre of Chinese people was thus ignited, and it could not be contained. The bloody tragedy spread throughout Korea. On the 6th and 7th, the trains coming from Korea were filled with no fewer than 2,000 overseas Chinese fleeing for refuge, their hair disheveled and faces covered in dirt, a pitiful sight. According to the returning overseas Chinese, a tragic massacre suddenly occurred in the Seoul, Incheon, Pyongyang, and Seoncheon areas on the afternoon of the 3rd. Korean rioters formed gangs, their momentum very fierce. They searched the homes of overseas Chinese and killed them at will. They first set fire to and destroyed their goods, knocked down their houses, and then killed people and divided the property. Countless overseas Chinese died, but the exact number is unknown. The rioters then used automobiles at night to transport the bodies and throw them into the river, destroying the evidence. Their designs were also cunning. When the tragedy was first discovered, the consul-general in Seoul, Zhang Weicheng, and the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce rushed to see the director of the police bureau and the head of the foreign affairs section of the Governor-General's Office, requesting them to quickly stop the rioters' rampages and protect the overseas Chinese. The Japanese authorities verbally agreed completely, but it has not been effective. The rioters continue to rampage as before, still massacring and looting. At that time, a Shanghai merchant named Wu planned to establish a branch in Seoncheon and had shipped textiles worth 50,000 Shanghai silver dollars from Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when the goods arrived in Seoul, it coincided with the opening of the tragedy. All the goods were divided up by the rioters. Wu committed suicide upon hearing the news. Near Namdaemun in Seoul, the Guo family of eight people, barbers from Hubei, were all killed at the same time, with no one spared. On the morning of the 6th, Consul Zhang saw that the situation was serious and could not be stopped. He protected the Chinese and got them on the train to flee back to Andong. At this time, the overseas Chinese who had taken refuge in the consulate were crowded together. The rioters rushed in, smashing everything they saw, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce was also affected. At this time, the situation was urgent, and each station stopped selling train tickets to overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese there were even more panicked, and many wanted to return but could not. Therefore, they had no choice but to buy Korean clothes at high prices, posing as Korean people, buy tickets, get on the train, and hurriedly return home. Each short jacket actually cost more than 300 yen in Japanese currency. Unexpectedly, this evil trend spread quickly and extended to Sinuiju (separated from Andong by only a river). On the afternoon of the 6th, the Korean people there also suddenly rioted, seeking revenge on the Chinese and looting Chinese businesses. Although the Japanese police came out to stop them, they were ineffective. However, the overseas Chinese who were young and strong crossed the river overnight and were able to flee back to Andong, but they were empty-handed and abandoned all their property. The women, children, elderly, and weak remained there, their survival uncertain. The Chinese consul stationed in Sinuiju negotiated with the Japanese side, but to no avail, and fearing offending the rioters, there was no small danger. He also crossed the river to temporarily avoid the storm. On the morning of the 7th, overseas Chinese representatives Dou Yude and others went to various agencies to report the tragedy. At the same time, the people of the city, hot-blooded heroes, indignant at the injustice, wanted to retaliate against the Korean people in Andong, but were persuaded to stop by the authorities. The overseas Chinese in Andong felt uneasy and had disappeared from Chinese Street since the morning of the 7th. However, the air in Chinese Street in the city was tense, and there was a sense of impending crisis. It was heard that the Korean people in the Liudao Gou area were eager to try something, relying on something. Three or five cases of Korean people gathering to seek out and beat Chinese people had been discovered, but fortunately they were stopped in time and their desires were not fulfilled. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Chinese and Japanese police were on full alert, setting up checkpoints and increasing patrols along the streets, patrolling throughout the night to prevent Korean people from rioting. The Japanese police station informed the Chinese merchants and residents under its jurisdiction that they must close their doors before 8:00 PM in the evening, otherwise they would not be responsible for any other incidents that occurred. Wang Jiegong, the magistrate of Andong County, sent a telegram to the provincial officials on the morning of the 7th and negotiated with the Japanese consul, urging them to stop the Korean people from rioting as soon as possible. In addition, no fewer than 3,000 refugees from Korea and Sinuiju had fled, most of whom had no relatives to turn to and were sleeping on the streets, and there was a risk of starvation. Therefore, they joined forces with the Public Security Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce to find ways to provide relief, temporarily borrowing the Danggui and Xinming two stages and the Zhengyu Hao Sanhe Sheng oil mill in the city as shelters. All Chinese who had no relatives to rely on were accepted. As of the morning of the 8th, 1,200 refugees had been accommodated, and steamed buns were prepared as food. The expenses were temporarily advanced by the county government and the Chamber of Commerce. In addition, the county government, the Public Security Bureau, and the Chamber of Commerce each sent special personnel to take care of the refugees in the shelter. (July 8th)</p>
<p>Another dispatch states that after the tragedy was caused in Wanbao Mountain, District 3, Changchun, Jilin Province, by Japanese instigating Koreans to seize rice fields and forcibly dig ditches, the Koreans in various parts of Korea rose up in swarms, abusing our overseas compatriots, and actually developed into an unprecedented tragedy with blood flying everywhere. Reports have been pouring in from various places in recent days, making them unbearable to read. Unexpectedly, the entire Korean population of Sinuiju (Korean territory), across the river from Andong, also gathered a crowd on the evening of the 6th, marched in procession, and demonstrated in the streets. They beat any Chinese they encountered. By around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 7th, their actions were even more violent. Each held wooden sticks or large stones, and in an instant, the Donyufu, Taishengxiang, Yixingsheng, and Xinhua Yuan shops of Chinese merchants in Zhensha Town, Sinuiju, as well as the Dongshenglong shop of large Japanese merchants on Japanese Street, were all simultaneously struck by wood and stones. Windows and doors were broken, and much of the property inside was looted by the Koreans. Our overseas compatriots saw that the Japanese army's superficial efforts to stop them were ineffective, so they had no choice but to abandon their property and flee to Andong City. Our country's consulate in Sinuiju was also tragically smashed. As a result, the entire Chinese houses and property in Sinuiju suffered countless losses, totaling more than 300 Chinese merchants. From morning (7th) to 8:00 PM, approximately 3,000 overseas compatriots escaped, all filled with grievances and crying together. Those who had branches or relatives and friends in this city all came to take refuge. Those who had nowhere to turn were protected by the government, borrowed land for accommodation, and the Public Security Bureau provided porridge and rice to maintain their lives. From 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM, the first, second, and third bridges connecting this city and the Japanese concession temporarily increased guards from both China and Japan to prevent Koreans from traveling back and forth and causing conflicts. After 9:00 PM, traffic was cut off between the Chinese and Japanese borders. Our city temporarily increased the business community and patrolled along the streets to protect them. The atmosphere was tense throughout the city, and the situation was unusually turbulent. At approximately 1:00 PM, Zhang Hanwei, director of the business port public security bureau, and Wang Jiegong, the county magistrate, both went to the Danggui stage to comfort the returning overseas compatriots, urging them to wait for negotiations and promising to satisfy the affected compatriots. In the afternoon, the Japanese consul in this city visited our county government, but because the situation was unclear, negotiations could not begin. Chinese merchants in the concession all closed their doors at 9:00 PM in the evening. The night markets in the city and the concession were all temporarily suspended. In our city, Chinese merchants and residents residing in Korea were protected by our police to prevent accidents. (July 8th)</p>
<h3>US Newspaper Commentary on the Wanpaoshan Incident</h3>
<p>A Result of Japanese Conspiracy</p>
<p>Attempted Japanese Immigration Fails</p>
<p>Turning to Exploiting Korean Farmers</p>
<p>The World News Agency translates a review from the "Millard's Review" stating: The Japanese government's attempt to relocate its own people to Manchuria has failed, but they are not discouraged. They are now obviously trying to achieve the same goal by utilizing Koreans. Various incidents have occurred in the Eastern Provinces in recent months, especially the Wanpaoshan Incident, which is the most noteworthy. This is a direct result of the Japanese plan to use Koreans to immigrate to Manchuria. Initially, Japan planned to relocate Japanese people to Manchuria, but despite spending huge sums of money, it was ultimately unsuccessful. After twenty years of operation, the total number of Japanese people in Manchuria is no more than 200,000. Of these, 150,000 live in the Kwantung Leased Territory, the Japanese Concessions of Shenyang and Changchun, and the Japanese-controlled areas along the South Manchuria Railway. Most of these Japanese people are directly or indirectly related to the South Manchuria Railway's coal mining industry or various subsidiary businesses operated by the South Manchuria Railway. The independent Japanese colonization of Manchuria has completely failed because they cannot compete with the Chinese.</p>
<p>In view of the failure of relocating Japanese farmers to South Manchuria, the Japanese government turned its attention to Koreans. Initially, the Japanese government did not pay much attention to the Koreans' immigration to China, so there were few contacts with the Chinese authorities. Thousands of Koreans became Chinese citizens and lived peacefully with the millions of Chinese farmers who moved from Shandong to the Eastern Provinces. In recent years, however, the Japanese government, or at least the Japanese military cliques that controlled Japanese enterprises in South Manchuria, gradually paid attention to the Koreans, forcing them to register with the Japanese consulates, prohibiting them from paying taxes to the Chinese authorities, and encouraging them to resist any interference from the Chinese authorities. Whenever there was a dispute between Chinese and Koreans, the Japanese immediately sent troops to engage in "protection." If Koreans suffered any losses due to conflicts between China and Korea, the Japanese side would make compensation claims, which would create a tense situation with the potential to cause actual war.</p>
<p>The organization in charge of relocating Korean farmers to South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia is the Oriental Development Company. This company is formally subsidized by the Japanese government and was established in 1908 for the purpose of encouraging Japanese farmers to relocate to Korea. In recent years, the company has borrowed huge sums of money from the United States and France to subsidize the relocation of Korean farmers to South Manchuria. According to the Japan Yearbook, the Oriental Development Company has a capital of 50 million yen, and its bonds reach 141.1 million yen, which is three times its capital. The company provides loans to Korean farmers on generous terms or organizes Korean agricultural companies for terms ranging from five to twenty-five years. The Japanese government has approved the company's existence for 100 years. Its president and two vice presidents are appointed by the Japanese government and must be Japanese. Another vice president can be a Korean. All agricultural colonization areas established by the company are protected by the Japanese army and extraterritorial rights. Therefore, they are not under the jurisdiction of Chinese courts, nor do they pay taxes to the Chinese authorities. As the relocation areas of Koreans gradually increase, the Japanese General Staff also gradually increases its troops stationed in Chinese territory for protection.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Abused and Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Wang Luo, the wife of Wang Yekui, the young owner of the Tongdetai Military Oil Shop on Nanhai Street outside Changmen Gate, committed suicide by swallowing opium the other day due to unbearable beatings and abuse from her parents-in-law and husband. After the local court sent personnel to verify that there were indeed injuries, her husband, Wang Yekui, was escorted to the court by the Public Security Bureau for investigation and then detained. The mother and family of the deceased have now hired lawyer Xia to file a petition with the court requesting redress. Wang Yekui, on the other hand, has hired lawyers Sun and Jing, citing that many members of the deceased's family have occupied and disturbed the peace before the funeral arrangements, and has also filed a lawsuit with the court.</p>
<h3>Losses from Continuous Heavy Rain</h3>
<p>The continuous heavy rain has had a huge impact on rice seedlings in various townships. The shuttle boats that are usually relied upon for transportation have been suspended in eight or nine out of ten cases. Yesterday (the 12th), Qian Tianpeng, the director of the Construction Bureau, learned that the fields near Lake Taihu have been completely submerged. If it rains again, the district public offices in the towns and cities will also be submerged. The shuttle boats are docked at the Waitangqiao port and cannot pass the bridge to proceed further. Late rice is mainly grown in this area, and the rice seedlings have now been submerged in the water. In Guangfu, three or four out of ten of the rice fields at the Shanren Bridge in Hengjing have been submerged. The shuttle boats have been suspended, and the pond banks have been submerged by water. Wangjiaji in this township has become a swamp, and the houses have been completely submerged. More than 3,000 mu of fields in the 12th and 20th Tu of Huangdai have been completely submerged. The autumn harvest is estimated to be only 50% of what it could have been. Houses are flooded, and the water in the streets and alleys is ankle-deep. The pond banks along the river are submerged, and the shuttle boats are not running. Because Yishan, Guoxiang, and Xietang are attached to Suzhou City, the shuttle boats are still running, but the low-lying fields are completely submerged. The telephone lines in Lumu are blocked, and transportation is not possible. The river water in Mudu has risen by more than five feet in the past few days. The shuttle boat only ran one trip yesterday (the 12th). After the small boat from Dongshan City arrived at Shitang, passengers were ferried by small boats. The shuttle boat between that place and Hengjing has been suspended for three days.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<h3>Various Things After Continuous Rain</h3>
<p>Since entering the rainy season, there have been continuous rains in this county, especially the heavy rains on the 5th, 6th, and 7th, which were even more severe. The river water rose several feet sharply, and the low-lying rice seedlings were all submerged. As a result, the villagers were greatly panicked and reported to various businesses. The disaster situation was most severe in the areas of Dongtang City, Shipai, Renyang, Wuta, Nanhengjing, and Liantang. More than 20,000 mu of seedlings were washed away by the water. Ships can sail in the fields. In terms of transportation, the villagers in various places are building embankments to prevent water intrusion. However, the operation of shuttle boats is enough to damage the embankments, so the villagers prevent the shuttle boats from sailing. If anyone violates this, they will definitely attack them with huge stones and dirty feces. Therefore, the shuttle boats to and from various ports in this county have all stopped anchoring. As a result, news is isolated, and out-of-port postal correspondence arrives only after three days, and Shanghai newspapers must also be read once every three days, but they are delivered by special ships.</p>
<h3>Commander Zhu Comes to Changshu to Interrogate the Major Bandit</h3>
<p>The Second Battalion of the Pacification and Security Team stationed in Changshu previously arrested three major bandits, Wang Fengyi, Lu Rujin, and Chen Changwan, in Hupu. After several interrogations by the camp director, the three criminals were to be sent to the headquarters for review. Now, Supervisor Zhang telegraphed Regiment Commander and Commander Zhu Mian to come to Changshu from Suzhou to conduct on-site interrogation. Zhu arrived in Changshu on the 7th with Judge Advocate Zhu Shengwu and questioned the three bandits one by one at the battalion headquarters. Each bandit still confessed as before. Now Commander Zhu has decided to conduct a personal investigation in Changshu before proceeding with the review. If it is true, he will definitely execute them locally. On the 9th, Zhu hired a small motorboat and returned to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>The Xiyi Section of the Ring Lake Road Will Soon Be Under Construction</h3>
<p>After Sun Hongzhe, Director of the Construction Department, decided that the earth and stone works of the Xiyi section of the Ring Lake Provincial Highway would be contracted by Xiangtai and Xiehe Companies, the director of the local Construction Bureau ordered the department to rush to make the project contract. It has now been completed and is expected to start construction around the 20th. Director Sun of the Construction Department specially came to Wuxi with Deng Zaichen, Director of the Electrical Department, the other day. Yesterday morning, they went to Meiyuan, Yuantouzhu, Dushanmen and other places to inspect the Xiyi section of the Ring Lake Avenue. The inspection situation was that near Yuantouzhu and the opposite side of the Wuli Lake, a bridge was planned to be built at a narrow and shallow part of the lake, so that it could be used by Fangqiao and other places to drive around the lake. Director Deng of the Electrical Department plans to plant poles and hang lines along the Xiyi section of Taihu Lake to install telephones to facilitate the suppression of bandits along the lake and the communication of news on the Xiyi Road. After the inspection, they went to Taihu Hotel for a rest and decided to return to the province today.</p>
<h3>Regulations on the Recruitment Area of the Military Police</h3>
<p>The county government had previously repeatedly received instructions from the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force that recruitment by the military police should be prohibited in the provinces of Jiangsu, including Suzhou, Songjiang, Changshu, and Tai, and Zhejiang, including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, but other areas could be handled accordingly. However, recently, Li Jinlan, a recruiter from the 5th Group of the Military Police Department, Zhou Rongchang, a recruitment branch committee member, and Zhao Ying, a conscripted student committee member from the 4th Division of the Army, came to Wuxi one after another to set up recruitment offices in temples and monasteries inside and outside the city, and successively sent letters to the Public Security Bureau requesting assistance. The county government had previously received orders to prohibit recruitment, and had not received any provincial orders this time, so it should prevent it as the opportunity arose, and immediately ordered the County Public Security Bureau to dissuade its subordinates in order to comply with the orders.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Rain Disaster in Mengcheng</h3>
<p>Menghe City in the western countryside of Wujin is flanked by mountains on the east and west, forming an embracing trend, so it is also known as Pearl City. There are many shops in the city, and famous doctors emerge in large numbers. Those who come from all over the provinces from afar to seek treatment are in an endless stream. The weather was very hot this month. On the 2nd and 3rd, there were thunderstorms, day and night. The mountain water on both sides rushed straight down, causing the South Water Gate of the city to be suddenly destroyed. The water was vast, truly like the scene of flooding Jinshan Temple. The villagers beat gongs and built ports, and were extremely panicked. The city was flooded to a depth of two or three feet. Shops and households were flooded and unable to trade. Pedestrians still traveled barefoot. Most naughty children used basins as boats to swim in it. Fishermen or held nets to catch fish, and could get dozens of catties every day. Families, old and young, could use this to survive. The Construction Bureau dredged the Menghe River this year, but the north section of the Menghe River was uniquely left out. I don't know why. With such heavy rains for days, there was no way out for the water, so the surrounding fields were all turned into swamps, and business was greatly affected. Now the township chief is preparing to report the famine. Since this rain disaster, food prices have risen sharply, and grains, melons, and vegetables have all doubled in price. It is truly a disaster that has not occurred in nearly ten years.</p>
<h3>A Kidnapping Case Occurs in Gangzi Township</h3>
<p>In the fifth li of Gangzi Township in the fourth district of Wuyi, the other night, unscrupulous people set up a stage to perform Tanhuang near the house of Gu Hong, the township chief. A farmer named Tan Gaoda has three sons. The eldest and second sons went out to watch Tanhuang. Tan and his 13-year-old youngest son slept at home. Because the two sons had not returned, the back door was not closed. In the middle of the night, two bandits suddenly came in through the back door, holding flashlights to shine. One bandit opened the curtain and pointed a gun at Gaoda, threatening him not to make a sound. The other bandit picked up his 13-year-old youngest son and still went to the back door. Afterwards, they searched everywhere, but there was still no news.</p>

<h3>Zhu Jieshi's Case of Shooting an Innocent Person is Scheduled for Trial</h3>
<p>Zhu Jieshi, the former police captain of Huaiyin County, mistakenly killed two farmers, Sun Deyuan and Jiang Diancheng, while suppressing bandits in Hongfuzhuang during his tenure. Knowing his mistake, not only did he not change, but he abandoned the bodies of Sun and Jiang in the river in an attempt to cover up his tracks. The masses heard about it and resisted, and also burned down the house of Li Shiqing, shot and injured the family members of the person in charge, and extorted huge sums of money. Afterwards, he fabricated charges and arrested him, arousing a major disturbance. Various groups in the county believed that Zhu was so rampant and extremely illegal, and organized the Hongfuzhuang Massacre Support Association to file a complaint in the province, and recommended representatives to appeal to various agencies to send a committee to investigate and verify, and escort Zhu and Detective Liu Yunpeng and attendant Li Yunpeng to the province, and transfer them to the court for investigation. The prosecution department had already summoned witnesses to open a court for investigation and prosecution in the criminal court.

The Criminal Court, according to the complaint, in addition to notifying the defendant, also summoned the victims Li Shiqing, Fan Shilin, Hua Yongqin, and witnesses Qian Youzheng and other 11 people to open a court for trial publicly at 10:00 am on the 14th of this month.

<h3>Revenue Collector Embezzles Huge Sums and is Imprisoned and Pursued</h3>
<p>Shi Shaomei, the revenue collector of the 19th District of the Hangzhou Municipal Finance Bureau, was young and frivolous and made the wrong friends.

The Finance Bureau pursued the original guarantors and merchants to recover the money. Shi had already returned to Hangzhou, so he was arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the court.

As usual, the shipowner reported to the Zhejiang Maritime Customs Administration to send personnel to inspect it.

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Jiangsu Provincial Hospital</h3>
<p>Sir, I am writing to you regarding the Zhenjiang correspondence in your newspaper on July 10, which contained a report on the hospital president being released on bail. This is not only untrue, but also contains errors. The condition that Yi suffers from is syphilitic arthritis, which has lasted for nearly ten years. His feet are ulcerated and his limbs are twisted. All medicines have failed and he has long been disabled. Since entering our hospital, the ulcers have healed for a long time. He can now lie down, who was previously unable to do so. He can now stand, who was previously unable to do so. Only the virus is deep-rooted and the hip joint is permanently damaged, so he cannot move, as before. This is not as reported in your newspaper, (that his leg bones were reversed during surgery for external disease, causing him to be unable to move). As for the so-called use of gas to check, this is actually a misinterpretation of the Wassermann reaction test. Moreover, the Wassermann reaction is a method to check whether there is syphilis in the blood, and it is not like an X-ray machine that can see the bones. Based on this point, it can also be seen that it is deliberately fabricated. Other things, such as (but only testing and testing), are fabrications. In short, the case is extremely complex, and we have now filed a counterclaim according to law. In addition to waiting for a legal solution and expert appraisal, we have always admired your newspaper for upholding righteousness. We hereby write to you to request that you investigate and make corrections, so that we can clearly distinguish right from wrong. Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, July 7, 11.</p>

<h3>All Circles Will Hold a Meeting Today to Jointly Discuss Measures Against Japan</h3>
<p>Meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM</p>
<p>After the outbreak of anti-Chinese riots by Koreans, the industrial and commercial groups of this city have decided to convene various mass organizations at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM today to earnestly discuss measures against Japan together. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the representatives of the Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai yesterday, stating that they had lodged a serious protest, but received a confidential letter from the Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce, which described the horrific details of the Korean riots. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed a reply to Liu Zhongkui, representative of the Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Incheon and Seoul, stating: Your submission has been noted. We have notified the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires and lodged a serious protest, and reserved negotiations. We have repeatedly telegraphed the Minister to Japan and the Consul General to Korea, requesting the Japanese authorities to protect and stop the riots. According to the telegram reply, the Japanese side expressed great apology and has ordered the police to do their best to suppress them, which can be calmed down. The Korean governor has not yet taken office, and there is someone in charge who will not shirk responsibility. In addition to continuing negotiations, I hope to convey this to all relevant parties. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Appeal from Shandong People by Telegram</h3>
<p>(1) The Shandong Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again yesterday, stating: Your Excellency Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the steam telegram is for the Korean riots and the massacre of overseas Chinese. Please send personnel to negotiate and find a way to stop it, etc. It is hoped that this will be understood. Later, at 7 PM on the same day, a telegram was received from the Korean Wonsan Chamber of Commerce saying, "3,000 merchants and workers have taken refuge in the consulate, and the city is unstable," etc. According to this, after investigating, the Koreans are massacring overseas Chinese and are aggressively pressing forward. Our overseas Chinese are hanging by a thread and are in dire straits. If we do not quickly find a way to stop them, it is inevitable that the previous tragedy will be repeated. For this reason, we are sending another telegram to present our request. We beg you to seriously negotiate and find a way to stop them, so as to protect our compatriots and emphasize national rights. We cannot help but eagerly await your order. (1) The preparatory office of the Shandong Business Federation in Shanghai telegraphed: Your Excellency the National Government of Nanjing and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the association has telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 8th regarding the case of Koreans killing overseas Chinese, requesting that the foreign affairs authorities negotiate strictly as soon as possible. (This is omitted) On the same day, there were also massacres of overseas Chinese in Busan and Wonsan. Those who took refuge in the Consulate General's Office were lucky to escape the net, but were subjected to exhaustion. The overseas Chinese in the eight provinces of Korea are on the verge of life and death every day. Calling to heaven is unanswered, and calling to earth is ineffective. Who is doing this for them? Who caused this? Clear-sighted people can see through the conspiracy. Thinking back to when Korea separated from our protection, it has been less than forty years. Why is there such irreconcilable hatred that they must destroy them to be willing? Who would dare to believe that there is no one giving instructions? The Wanpaoshan Incident occurred on June 1, and the Pyeongyang Massacre occurred on July 6. The brewing organization lasted for more than a month. With Japan's world-renowned police force supervising the Koreans who have been unwilling to die for decades, who would dare to believe that the police were unaware of the organization and brewing for more than a month? It can be blamed on the lack of prior awareness and the sudden outbreak of the incident, and the police were weak. Why is it that the same things are discovered in the massacres in Pyeongyang and Seoul, the same lack of prior awareness, and the same inability to suppress them afterwards? Furthermore, Seoul is a fundamental and important place, and the military strength should be different from other ports. Such a heavily guarded place, but blaming the military and police for being unable to suppress them, who would dare to believe? In short, Japan is using an indirect immigration policy to prevent our overseas Chinese from gaining a foothold in its colonies, so it is using this conspiracy to kill people with a borrowed knife to eliminate our overseas Chinese. At a time when the world respects humanity, there is such behavior. Where is our country's sovereignty? Where is international law? Where is international public opinion and sanctions? The association is a merchant organization, and in view of the fact that most of those who were massacred this time were merchants, and all of them were merchants from our Shandong Province, we are deeply concerned, and our words are naturally heartfelt. For this reason, we appeal to your government (department) to immediately telegraph Japan to quickly stop it, and to telegraph the International Court of Justice and the various leagues of the International League to promote humanity and denounce the riots. We are at a loss and cannot help but cry and beg.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese's Plight</h3>
<p>Cao Jingyu, Executive Director of the Korean Association in Shanghai, told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency that since the outbreak of the anti-Chinese incident in Korea, a telegram has been received from overseas Chinese who fled to Yantai, stating that the Japanese authorities in Korea are withholding emergency telegrams from overseas Chinese merchants and strictly checking letters. All those mentioning Korean affairs will be withheld. Trains and ships are prohibited from Chinese riding back to their countries. Overseas Chinese have no way out. It is heard that Korean rice and grain shops are even preventing Chinese from buying them. Therefore, the association has decided to send representatives to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again tomorrow to petition Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, requesting that he quickly find a way to rescue the overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Brutal Situation</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency stated that it received a confidential letter from the Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which roughly stated that after the Korean riots, the president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce went to the Incheon Prefecture Office, requesting that troops be sent quickly to protect them. The Prefecture Office said that the Japanese police were handling the situation effectively and could definitely prevent any trouble. On the afternoon of that day, many overseas Chinese took refuge in the Chamber of Commerce and school buildings. The refugees were full of people, and the tragic situation was unbearable to see. At 8 PM, the Chinese shopkeepers on the Korean streets said that there were many Koreans gathering in groups, and the situation was very urgent, requesting protection. When the police arrived, the doors and windows of each house had been damaged. When they arrived, the Koreans attacked the Chinese streets again. The shops in various places were broken beyond recognition. Valuable goods were robbed, and cheap goods were thrown into the streets. Dozens of people were injured and many died. Two of them had their hearts taken out and their eyes gouged out. They arbitrarily set fires with kerosene. The Koreans used large axes, long poles, stones, knives, and wooden sticks as weapons. The Japanese officials protected them on the surface, but secretly sided with the Koreans.</p>
<h3>The Riot Gradually Subsides</h3>
<p>A certain merchant firm in this city recently received a telegram from Chinese merchants in Incheon stating that the anti-Chinese riots in Korea are gradually subsiding in places such as Seoul, Incheon, Jinnampo, and Sinuiju. It is reported that a representative of the Korean Governor-General's Office has apologized to our country's Consul-General in Korea. At the same time, Consul-General Zhang Weicheng requested the Governor-General's representative to restore the original state within a limited time, which has been agreed upon. On the 10th, investigators from Pyongyang returned to Beijing, reporting the tragic situation, causing universal grief. On the 11th, the Governor-General's representative continued to visit our Consul-General, answering all questions. Mr. Zhang strongly argued for the safety of the entire area, which the representative agreed to. However, refugees are lingering in various places, lacking funds and food, and many are falling ill, urgently needing relief. Consul-General Zhang has been inspecting the areas where Chinese reside for days. The number of casualties and losses suffered by the Chinese is currently under detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Yu Qiaqing Commemorative Meeting</h3>
<p>The Grand Occasion on the Second Day</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 50th Anniversary Celebration in Shanghai. The number of guests attending was even more enthusiastic than on the first day. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Motorcade Parade</h3>
<p>The motorcade parade for Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 50th Anniversary Celebration in Shanghai was held yesterday at 1 p.m. Before noon, the area in front of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association was already packed with onlookers. The Shanghai Municipal Police specially dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order. Automobiles from various organizations and people from all walks of life arrived one after another. Organizations participating included the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the National Products Mall, the Ning Shao Company, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Zhabei Charity Group, the Jiangwan Fire Brigade, the Securities and Commodities Exchange Brokers Association, the Songjiang Ning Shao Fellow-Provincials Association, the Da Xin Silk Store, and others. Prominent figures in Shanghai, such as Wang Xiaolai, Le Zhenbao, Wang Binyan, Kui Yanfang, Sun Meitang, Dong Xingsheng, Wu Zhihao, Xie Baosheng, He Shaoting, Fang Jiaobo, Lu Fengzhu, Chen Yiting, Chen Songyuan, Zhu Jingan, Tan Haiqiu, Hu Yongqi, and others, also participated. In total, there were over two hundred automobiles. At 1 p.m., Mao Heyuan, director of the motorcade parade, gave a speech of thanks to the various organizations and guests, stating that colleagues had initiated the motorcade parade to celebrate Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 50th anniversary of doing business in Shanghai because Mr. Yu Qiaqing had made great contributions and efforts to society, whether for the country or for the people, and was very worthy of celebration. He was very honored that representatives of various organizations and people from all walks of life had enthusiastically participated in the parade. On behalf of Mr. Yu, he thanked everyone. While Mr. Mao was speaking, Tianyi Film Company was filming. Immediately afterward, parade leaders Mao Heyuan and Shen Xiechen led the departure, with the conference's float at the forefront. The float prominently displayed the words "Motorcade Parade Celebrating Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 50th Anniversary in Shanghai," which was quite eye-catching. Police also dispatched foreign police cars to patrol and protect the procession. The parade proceeded according to the original route, winding like a long snake. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the National Products Mall, and the Da Xin Silk Store also had floats participating, which were also quite beautiful. Tianyi Film Company filmed along the way, and the crowds of onlookers caused traffic to be blocked. The parade returned to the racecourse for a photo shoot and dispersed. There were also quite a few automobiles that arrived late and were unable to participate.</p>
<h3>Meeting Circumstances</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, after the motorcade parade, the meeting continued. Chairman Wang Xiaolai first had Yu Qiaqing report on the gifts received from various parties and the intention to prepare for the establishment of the Sanbei Hospital. He then expressed his gratitude to all the guests. Speakers who followed included Sun Hengfu, manager of the Siming Bank, Fang Jiaobo of the Ning Shao branch, Wen Lanting of the exchange, Liu Yaoting of the Sanbei Company, and Wu Zhihao. Finally, Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a closing speech, and the meeting ended.</p>
<h3>Summary of Speeches</h3>
<p>(1) Mayor Zhang's speech briefly stated that Mr. Qiaqing's life's work had been detailed in the special publication, and Mr. Qiaqing himself had described his fifty years of experience in detail to us, so there was no need for him to elaborate. He dared to say that there was not a single person in Shanghai, whether Chinese or foreign, who did not know Mr. Qiaqing. There must be a reason why he was held in such high esteem, which was that he had overcome fifty years of hardship and effort to create today's history and environment, and to produce today's grand celebration. Today's commemorative meeting was not just because we usually respectfully call him "Old Qiaqing" or "Old Shanghai." There were others present who had been in Shanghai for more than fifty years, so why were we not holding a commemoration for them, but only for Mr. Qiaqing? Of course, it was not just because he had a wide circle of friends, and we were just gathering to join in the fun. It was because Mr. Qiaqing had made great contributions and blessings to the country and society in the past fifty years, so today's commemoration held great meaning in the speaker's personal opinion. First, it expressed admiration for Mr. Qiaqing's fifty years of effort. He had known Mr. Qiaqing for twenty years, starting during the 1911 Revolution, when they shared hardships. Mr. Qiaqing also enthusiastically participated in the Second Revolution. After the Revolutionary Army began the Northern Expedition in 1926 and reached the Southeast, the government received much support from Mr. Qiaqing. Although he had only known Mr. Qiaqing for twenty years, he knew a lot about his life. Now, from the perspective of twenty years of friendship, judging Mr. Qiaqing's fifty years of effort, Mr. Qiaqing's life's work was enough to be a model for future generations. The meaning of the commemoration was not to praise an individual, but to take the opportunity to publicize his achievements as a guideline and path for future generations to strive for. Therefore, today's meeting was of great significance. Speaking of the rise and fall of a country, in addition to the rule of law, there was also the issue of people. Looking at all countries, in all fields and in all kinds of careers, there were elders participating in them. The so-called elders did not refer to their old age, but to the fact that they had devoted their entire lives to a certain career and ultimately achieved success, were respected by all fields, and were loved by the people. Thomas Edison, the American inventor of electricity, was such a figure. He only knew about his career and not about himself. In our country, it was not easy to find an elder who had devoted his entire life to good deeds. Mr. Qiaqing was a rare exception. We still hoped that Mr. Qiaqing would continue to work hard, as he reported, and take responsibility for abolishing unequal treaties for the country and canceling the nation's deed of sale. Mr. Qiaqing had worked hard on his career for decades as if it were one day, and he still did not give up his hard work to carry out his long-cherished ambition. It was hoped that colleagues would gather under Mr. Qiaqing's leadership and fight forward. The speaker presented Mr. Qiaqing with the words "Rising Like the Sun" as a memento, with that meaning. In China, whenever there was a happy event, people always said, "May you grow old together for a hundred years." It was hoped that in another fifty years, we could hold another "Centennial Commemorative Meeting" for Mr. Qiaqing. The speaker respectfully offered his sincere blessings. (2) Wang Xiaolai's speech briefly stated that today's 50th anniversary celebration for Mr. Qiaqing's life in Shanghai was a rare event. Only Mr. Zhu Baosan had ever had one like it, but it was not as grand as today's. Words of praise and admiration were already dazzling and beautiful. Mr. Qiaqing was sixty-five years old this year. Everyone in Shanghai, whether they were from Shanghai or had come to Shanghai, knew Mr. Qiaqing. He came to Shanghai at the age of fifteen, when he should have been called Young Qiaqing. Fifteen to fifty to fifty to fifteen was to show the cycle of infinity. Thinking of Old Qiaqing, thinking of Young Qiaqing, from Young Qiaqing to Old Qiaqing, he just happened to become an old youth. The so-called old youth was not just a fabrication, but should be based on evidence. It was not as good as wishing someone a long life, always wishing them a life as long as Nanshan Mountain, never aging, or wishing someone happiness, always wishing them a hundred years of harmony and five generations of prosperity, which may not necessarily be realized. However, the so-called old youth of Mr. Qiaqing had concrete evidence. The proverb referred to an old youth as someone who was old but acted like a youth, which was the same as being old and strong. Like an old youth, opening flowers in the late autumn and winter scenery made them even more brilliant and beautiful. Furthermore, according to the old youth, it was also called the "Ten Sample Brocade." Mr. Qiaqing encompassed all aspects of the country, society, commerce, and public welfare. He was eloquent and heartfelt in matters of politics, diplomacy, local charity, and so on. According to ancient sayings, the "Ten Sample Brocade" was something Xiaolai and Qiaqing recognized at the end of the Guangxu era. They had been together for more than twenty years, and he had never seen Qiaqing wear a leather coat in winter or carry a fan in summer. He had not changed until now. His spirit of not fearing the heat and cold was truly admirable. He never paid attention to his clothing or food and was always busy, but he became healthier the busier he was. He associated with young people in the evening, without distinguishing between old and young, all year round, often returning late at night, day after day for decades. This was like the "Ten Sample Brocade" of the old youth, which could withstand frost and cold and become an extraordinary product, so he could do extraordinary things and open an extraordinary celebration. Mr. Qiaqing could truly be regarded as the flower of the Republic of China and the auspicious sign of the country.</p>
<h3>Proposed Matters</h3>
<p>1.  Chen Liangyu proposed that public groups should be responsible for preparing and erecting a bronze statue for Mr. Yu Qiaqing to express respect and admiration. 2. Mr. Yu Zongzhou proposed that the Shanghai Municipal Council should open a Yu Qiaqing Road in the concession to leave a memorial. 3. Shao Ruxin proposed that a commemorative meeting should be held for Mr. Yu Qiaqing every ten years in the future, and a centennial celebration should be held in another fifty years. All the guests applauded and agreed.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Performance Program</h3>
<p>Yesterday's performance began at 5 p.m. The program was as follows: 1. Complete Xiang Rong, 2. A Branch of Peach, 3. Entering the Palace Twice, 4. The Joint Trial in the Three Courts, 5. Four Pan Mountain, 6. Five Flower Cave, 7. Six Expeditions to Qishan, 8. Seven Captures of Meng Huo, 9. Eight Great Hammers, 10. Nine Tin Palace, 11. Ten Daobens, 12. Hundred Flowers Appointing Generals, 13. Thousand Autumn Ridge, 14. Ten Thousand Flower Building. The grand finale was Li Jiru and Jin Shaoshan's "Ai Hu Recruiting Relatives." In addition, there was the Datong Music Society's national music, with programs such as "Great China," "Celestial Atmosphere," and "Unified Rivers and Mountains," and other entertainment.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Merchants' Congratulatory Telegram</h3>
<p>Several dozen chairmen of various trade associations in Ningbo, including Qi Yungui, stated that their fellow Ningbo native, Mr. Qiaqing, had been doing business in Shanghai for fifty years and was a giant in the national business community, with a reputation reaching both China and foreign countries. The Shanghai trade associations had initiated a celebration for Mr. Qiaqing's 50th anniversary in Shanghai. Therefore, they specially invited various trade associations in Ningbo to send representatives Fan Chunguan, Yuan Duanfu, Bao Zhenke, Xu Zijing, Qi Yungui, Su Jiushao, and others to Shanghai by boat on the 10th to offer their congratulations in person. On the one hand, the chairmen of various trade associations sent a congratulatory telegram in advance.

He has been doing business in Shanghai for fifty years, and his clothing and food support tens of thousands of families. This 50th anniversary celebration moves the feast of the Antarctic star and meets the needs of medicine from his hometown. His benevolence is widely admired. We colleagues belong to the same hometown and have a share in the glory. In addition to publicly recommending Qi Yungui, Xu Zijing, Bao Zhenke, Su Jiushao, Fan Chunguan, Yuan Duanfu, etc., to represent our trade associations and offer our congratulations in person, we will send a telegram in advance, asking for your perusal and appreciation. We are extremely grateful.

<h3>Tomorrow's French Democratic Memorial</h3>

<p>On the 14th of this month, the French Democratic Memorial Day, French officials and merchants in Shanghai originally planned to hold a lantern parade on the evening of the 13th and a celebration ceremony on the 14th. It is now learned that the French authorities, due to the recent unrest, have decided to cancel the lantern parade on the evening of the 13th. The celebration ceremony on the 14th will still be held as in previous years.

<h3>Telegram of Yang Shuzhuang's Arrival in Fujian</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Naval Headquarters received a telegram from the Fujian Provincial Government yesterday afternoon reporting that the Naval Minister and Fujian Provincial Chairman Yang Shuzhuang had arrived in Fujian at 8 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Public Safety Bureau Plans to Conduct Physical Examinations of Foreigners Entering China</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the center of national land and water transportation. Foreigners who come to China by boat must first disembark in Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai is a very important location. However, the government authorities have always allowed foreigners to enter and exit freely. Not only were foreigners' bodies not examined, but travel passports were only required starting May 1 this year. Since the passport inspection office began its work, it has caught many people from various European and American countries entering China without passports, and they have all been sent back to their countries one after another. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau has also seen that there are many types of infectious diseases from abroad, such as venereal diseases and eye diseases, all of which are transmitted from abroad. In order to pay attention to the health of the Chinese people, we must pay special attention to the health of foreigners entering China. Therefore, it has been decided to conduct physical examinations of foreigners entering China, and preparations will begin soon. It is reported that the method in the future will be to have the passport inspectors and medical personnel inspect the foreign vessels at the port of entry.</p>
<h3>The Process of Sugar Merchants' Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Request to Amend the Draft Agreement for the Sino-Cuban Joint Sugar Factory</p>
<p>Because the draft agreement for the Sino-Cuban joint venture China National Sugar Manufacturing Factory, which was organized by the Ministry of Industry, contained many clauses that would cede national sovereignty, the sugar merchants in Shanghai petitioned in Beijing to request corrections to protect national rights and save losses. They have now returned to Shanghai. The petition process, the content of the draft agreement, and the status of the sugar industry in the world and China are described separately below.</p>
<h3>Petition Process</h3>
<p>The Sugar Trade Association appointed representatives Zheng Zenan, Yang Wenshao, Jiang Yachen, and others to present a petition in Beijing on the 7th, requesting the government to quickly amend or cancel the draft agreement for the Sino-Cuban joint sugar factory to avoid the loss of national sovereignty. Wang Pinsheng, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, received them and said that the Minister of Finance was currently in Shanghai and the Executive Yuan would pay attention to the matter. After a detailed discussion at the Executive Council meeting on the 14th, it would be reviewed and approved. Please wait for the instructions. Legislative Yuan President Shao Yuanchong was out on official business, and a staff member received them, saying that the various reasons stated in the petition would be used as reference when the industrial review group met to discuss the matter. Zhao Jinqing, Vice Minister of Industry, received them and said that if the draft agreement for the Sino-Cuban joint sugar factory did indeed cede national sovereignty and affect the livelihood of the sugar industry, the Ministry would take it into consideration. However, there may be misunderstandings in what was stated in the petition, such as the sales rights not being given to the Cubans. The China National Sugar Manufacturing Company was currently suspended, and sugar merchants could continue to operate to develop Chinese enterprises. If there were difficulties in raising capital, the government would do its best to assist. The sugar merchant representatives stated that they did not oppose the principle of cooperation, but national sovereignty could not be lost. If the draft agreement was amended and Cuba did not agree to lend money, the sugar factory would be wholly state-owned, and all capital would be filled by the Ministry of Finance with appropriate public bonds. The principal repayment fund for these public bonds would be added to the national sugar import tax. Vice Minister Zhao expressed acceptance of the sugar merchants' opinions. As for the China International Sugar Company organized by Cuba, it would establish distribution offices everywhere to sell the output of the joint sugar factory, but there was no fact that the company was responsible for the sales. The representatives were satisfied and returned to Shanghai by night train on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Content of the Draft Agreement</h3>
<p>The content of the signed draft agreement for the Sino-Cuban joint sugar factory is roughly divided into six chapters and contains a total of thirty-four articles. It is named the China National Sugar Manufacturing Factory, with the purpose of developing the domestic sugar industry in China. The sugar factory is resolved to be state-owned and managed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of China. The capital is five million gold yuan. There will be one factory director and one deputy factory director, divided into three departments: business, accounting, and engineering. The factory director, deputy factory director, and head of the business accounting department will be Chinese. The head of the engineering department and the deputy head of accounting may be appointed by Cuba from other countries. The factory must jointly certify and pay the monthly payments and budgets with Cuban accountants and issue type A bonds (for factory machinery) totaling no more than US$5 million and type B bonds (to repay sugar payments) totaling no more than US$15 million. Cuba will be given a 0.5% handling fee by China for the purchase of raw materials. The pure profit of the sugar factory will be calculated as a percentage, giving Cuba 5% as a consolation fee. The raw sugar required by the sugar factory will be purchased by Cuba.</p>
<h3>World Sugar Industry</h3>
<p>Deng Zenan, standing member of the Shanghai Sugar Trade Association, told a New Voices reporter yesterday that Cuba is the country with the most sugar production in the western hemisphere, shipping 4.6 million tons in 1919. The sugar produced in Cuba is all raw sugar, mostly supplied to the United States because the United States uses raw sugar. In the eastern hemisphere, it is Java in the Dutch East Indies, shipping 3.1 million tons in 1919. In recent years, due to oversupply, prices have fallen sharply. Cuba advocates contacting world sugar producing countries to restrict production. Last year, it sent representatives to Java, Japan, Italy, and other countries to investigate production and sales. On April 1 this year, a joint meeting of world sugar producing countries was held in Belgium to discuss restrictions. Last year, Cuba had 600,000 tons of raw sugar in storage. It was resolved that only Australia and China were allowed to transport and sell it.</p>
<h3>Chinese Sugar Industry</h3>
<p>China imported a total of 13 million piculs of sugar in 1919, with Shanghai accounting for 7 million piculs. Refined sugar accounted for one-half, and green sugar, raw sugar, and coarse sugar together accounted for one-half. Cuba's raw sugar imports were 14,000 tons, totaling 240,000 piculs. At the end of last year, there were still 66,000 piculs in storage. Our country has never produced sugar. This time, the Association asked the government to amend or cancel the draft agreement for the Sino-Japanese joint sugar factory, which was entirely a patriotic movement because the draft agreement contained provisions that ceded national sovereignty. However, it had nothing to do with the livelihood of the industry and did not contain any other effects. Therefore, we hope that the government will accommodate the sugar merchants' requests and correct them.</p>

<p>Japan and the US Compete in Pacific Shipping</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Lower Prices to Counter American Vessels</p>
<h3>American Giant Vessels Coming</h3>
<p>The American company Dollar Steamship Lines is building two of the largest postal ships, each 32,000 tons, at a cost of US$60 million, to operate on the Pacific route from Shanghai, hoping to remedy the current economic downturn. The company has now received a cable from its head office stating that the hull and passenger accommodations of the first ship, the President Hoover, have been completed and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai in September. The ship is extremely fast, exceeding the speed of existing Sino-American vessels, capable of traveling at over 21 nautical miles per hour. The ship is also equipped with airplanes for delivering express mail. The second ship, the President Coolidge, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai and begin operations in early December.</p>
<h3>Japan Mail Price Drop</h3>
<p>Since merging with Toyo Kisen Kaisha and building seven new Pacific vessels, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) has intended to dominate the Sino-American route. With the Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK Line) vessels on the San Francisco and Seattle routes now also merged into NYK Line, the company's ambition to monopolize Pacific shipping rights has grown stronger. Upon hearing that the two new Dollar Steamship Lines vessels are about to begin operations, and recognizing that their size and speed surpass those of NYK Line's vessels, making them formidable competitors, NYK Line has been discussing countermeasures for days. It has decided to drastically reduce fares by approximately 15% before the arrival of the two American vessels to counter them. The new prices will take effect on August 1st. The new and old prices for various ships are listed below (in US dollars):</p>
<p>Taiyo Maru New Taiyo Maru, etc.</p>
<p>Destination New Price Old Price New Price Old Price</p>
<p>Los Angeles 178 208 160 178</p>
<p>San Francisco 173 203 155 173</p>

<h3>Tax-Exempt Native Cloth Seized During Transport</h3>
<p>Trade Association Petitions Ministries of Finance and Industry for Release</p>
<p>Regarding the seizure of tax-exempt native cloth being transported by members of the local Native Cloth Trade Association by the Tax Collection Office stationed at the Customs, the association yesterday submitted another petition to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Regarding the seizure of tax-exempt native cloth being transported, which has been detained by the Tax Collection Office stationed at the Customs for over a month, causing anxiety among merchants and requesting prompt release to avoid danger. Previously, the association received a telegram regarding the tax-exempt hand-woven native cloth being transported to the eastern provinces. According to reports from merchants, the goods were detained by the Tax Collection Office stationed at the Customs, which has been a month, affecting finances and creating a dangerous situation in the market. The general tax exemption for native cloth has been resolved by the National Government and has been notified by your ministry. Since the establishment of the consolidated tax, cotton yarn already subject to the consolidated tax will not be subject to double taxation. On May 19th, the Ministry of Finance approved a general tax exemption for customs duties, with a notice on file. This native cloth is a secondary industry for farmers in Jiangsu Province and is mostly used by people in the eastern provinces. Recently, imported cloth has been encroaching on the eastern provinces, becoming dominant. The National Government, recognizing this, has exempted taxes to reduce costs for merchants and restore livelihoods. The association has repeatedly submitted petitions for customs duty exemptions, detailing the production and sales areas, requesting simultaneous exemptions, not for the purpose of Shanghai exports, with the intention of shifting the burden to others. According to a report from merchant Zhu Limen, the eastern provinces previously had no native cloth taxes and misunderstood the consolidated tax, believing it was unexpected. According to regulations, the consolidated tax is paid in the production area, and then the goods can be transported anywhere without double taxation, regardless of the production or sales area. The regulations are clear and can be reviewed. In short, this native cloth is a completely domestic product, and both the supply and demand sides are mostly poor households. The country and the people are closely linked, and Jiangsu Province and the eastern provinces are also closely linked. We beseech your ministry to consider promoting trade and provide assistance by urgently sending a telegram to the Finance Department of Liaoning Province, explaining the reasons for the tax exemption for all native cloth, as well as the promulgation of consolidated tax regulations and the one-tax-per-item system, to ensure simultaneous tax exemption throughout the country, to maintain national credibility and improve people's livelihoods, for which we would be immensely grateful."</p>
<h3>Sales Offices for Manufactured Goods Should Be Subject to Business Tax</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Science Instrument Museum, stating that all manufactured goods leaving their place of manufacture should still be subject to sales tax, which is inconsistent with the principle of one tax per item, and requested a reasoned argument. The Chamber then sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting instructions. Now, the Ministry of Finance's Fu Zi No. 6614 Yang Dai telegram states: "The Yang Dai telegram is acknowledged. Upon investigation, if a manufacturer directly wholesales manufactured goods from the factory, it constitutes a wholesale business directly established by the factory and should be subject to business tax according to the manufacturing industry. If manufactured goods have left their place of manufacture and are sold in sales offices, whether owned by the same manufacturer or the same firm, they should be subject to business tax according to the sales industry. The above information is hereby communicated for your information."</p>
<h3>Yu Youren and Others Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, Chen Shaokuan, Wei Daoming, and Gu Zhenglun all took the night train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>All-Zhejiang Association Requests Ministry of Finance to Increase Artificial Silk Tax</h3>
<p>To Aid the Silk Industry</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Association believes that silk harvests have been poor for years and show no signs of improvement, and that remedies are urgently needed. Therefore, at the general meeting last month, it was resolved to increase import duties on artificial silk and artificial silk fabrics to reduce foreign goods and give domestic silk a chance to sell better. The association has now telegraphed all chambers of commerce nationwide, advocating for a uniform stance and planning to submit the proposed increased import duty rates to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Investigates Customs of Pledged Factory Machinery</h3>
<p>No Need to Transfer Possession of Machinery</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce replied yesterday to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating: "With reference to your letter of June 20th, in which the court is handling a case that requires investigation into whether there are customs in this port regarding the granting of security interests in factory machinery without the need to transfer possession, the chamber has received your letter and dispatched personnel to investigate the banking and monetary industries and sent inquiries. The findings are now described in detail as follows: (1) In the loan contract, in addition to the guarantor, the borrower (i.e., the factory) specifies that the machinery is used as collateral for the loan. After the contract is established, the ownership is transferred to the lender. However, for the sake of maintaining its business, the borrower can establish a loan agreement to continue borrowing the original machinery from the lender (but there are also cases where a loan agreement is not established; see item 2). (2) After the borrower and lender enter into a loan agreement, there is no need to transfer ownership. The lender simply sends personnel to be stationed in the factory to supervise its operations. (3) If the pledged items are the factory base, factory buildings, and machinery, only the factory base needs to be transferred, and the buildings and machinery are listed separately in the pledge document, and the procedures are completed without the need to transfer possession of the machinery. All information regarding the customs of pledged machinery in this city is hereby provided. Please take note."</p>

<h3>Continuous Rain</h3>
<p>Fears of Another Famine</p>
<p>The continuous rain in Shanghai for over a week, with thunderstorms and heavy rain yesterday, may lead to another famine if the weather does not clear up soon. The following is a summary of what has been heard:</p>
<h3>Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Northwest Shanghai, including Xin Jing, Zhu Zhai, and Zhen Ru, and the areas bordering Qingpu and Jiading, which are naturally low-lying, have seen farmland turn into swamps due to the heavy rains. Newly planted rice seedlings are submerged in water and will likely float up and turn yellow (what the locals call "floating yellow seedlings"). The planted cotton, watermelons, and various vegetables have also suffered severe damage. Although the villagers have dug ditches to drain the fields, they cannot discharge the water due to high river levels. The open spaces in Xiaoshadu, Zhoujiaqiao, and the northern part of the Bund are also deeply flooded. The grass sheds built by the people from Jiangbei have become small rivers, and meals are consumed in the water, which is a very pitiful sight.</p>
<h3>Small Steamers Suspended</h3>
<p>Local river steamship companies on North Suzhou Road, such as Zhaoshang, Laogongmao, and Tai Dong, which operate routes to Changshu, Kunshan, Dangkou, and other ports, as well as the small steamers from Kunshan to Changshu and Qingyang Port to Changshu, have temporarily suspended passenger services and cargo transportation since the previous day due to the sudden rise in water levels by several feet in the rivers, the loosening of the mud banks on both sides, which cannot withstand the waves, and the submersion of most of the small bridges, with the water level being too high under the bridges for passage.</p>
<h3>Thunderstorm Electrocution News</h3>
<p>Since 5 PM on the 6th of this month, Shanghai has been experiencing thunderstorms and heavy rain, lasting for a week. The weather has not cleared, with continuous cloud cover. Although the sun occasionally appears briefly, it soon disappears. There are frequent rumblings of thunder, and intermittent showers continue. The situation has been particularly bad since the evening before yesterday, with thunder continuing throughout the night and heavy rain. The rain continued yesterday evening, and the weather has not cleared. The room is unusually hot and humid, and many items are moldy. The following is a summary of electrocution incidents from yesterday morning: (1) In Ximu Bridge, Li Jiazhai, west of Luodian Town, a farmer, Li Atu, had a yellow cow suddenly electrocuted and killed in the cowshed at around 3 AM. (2) In a dilapidated temple in the countryside of Liuhe, a statue was inexplicably struck by lightning and destroyed.</p>
<h3>More News on the Successful Rescue of Fu Aitang and Others from Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Recounting the Incident of the Arrest</p>
<p>Captain Lu Commended and Rewarded</p>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that the fifth district, third precinct of Zhabei rescued the hostages Fu Aitang and Lu Hongfu from a kidnapping boat in the Tan Jiaqiao River on Ouyang Road, and arrested one male and one female kidnapper. It is now known that the cause of the successful rescue was that one week prior, Gao Wansheng and Qi Haitian, leaders of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, received a confidential report from an informant stating that kidnappers Zhou Yuxi and others had kidnapped five hostages in Wujiang County, Suzhou, in April of the lunar calendar year, and were hiding them on a boat, secretly coming to Shanghai. It was discovered that the kidnapper's wives, Tao Musi and Zhu Bianshi, were frequenting the Nanmatou Xuejia Bang Road area. If these kidnapper's wives were arrested and interrogated, they would reveal the location of the hostages. Leader Gao immediately reported to Captain Lu, who ordered the leader to take the informant. In the afternoon of the same day, at 3 PM, the informant led them to the Nanmatou area. While walking along Xue Zi Bang Road, they spotted the kidnapper's wives Tao Musi and Zhu Bianshi sipping tea in a small teahouse. After the informant identified them, they were immediately arrested and taken to the team. Tao Musi provided evasive statements during the interrogation. When questioned, Zhu Bianshi revealed that the hostages were hidden in a small Jiangbei boat in the Tan Jiaqiao River behind Ouyang Road. Additional team leaders Su Sheng and Han Ruisheng, detectives Wang Shunbao and Han Jingxiang, secret agents Jiang Jinxiang and Xia Xiuying, and others were assigned to arrest the kidnapper's wife Zhu Bianshi at the address. At 6 PM, they cooperated with the police from the fifth district, third precinct, to make the arrests. However, as the detectives were walking on the bridge, they were spotted by the kidnappers on the boat, who immediately fled ashore. As a result, the hostages Fu Aitang and Lu Hongfu were rescued from under the cabin floor of the kidnapper's boat, and the kidnapper's wife Chen Zhushi was arrested. At the same time, the kidnapper Xu Yunzhen was also arrested. They were all interrogated. The two hostages provided detailed accounts of their kidnapping and everything that happened. The arrested kidnappers all confessed to the crimes without denial. After the case was solved, Director Chen specially approved a commendation and a major award for Captain Lu, and the other contributing officers will be rewarded separately after the case is concluded.</p>

<h3>Three Deaths from a Fire on Bailu Road</h3>
<p>On the 25th of last month, the second floor of the house of Gao Lide, an Anhui native at No. 8 Changde Lane, Bailu Road in the French Concession, was rented out to someone who manufactured summer epidemic medicines. After moving in for just over ten days, a fire broke out at 4 PM the day before yesterday when a partner carelessly dropped a cigarette into the alcohol. The explosion burned the bodies of staff members Yang Bali and Dai Haoran, also known as Wang Liangde. The partner, Sun A Da, was burned and jumped out of the window, injuring himself. The fire department arrived and extinguished the fire, preventing a major disaster, and transported the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is now reported that Yang, Dai, and Sun all died yesterday morning due to the severity of the burns. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor to examine the bodies. Yesterday, the Criminal Division of the French Police notified the relatives of the deceased, Yang Yucheng and Dai Jinxian, and the second landlord to report to the court. The court reported to Judge Zhu for an inquest. The relatives of Yang and Dai requested that the inquest be waived. Judge Zhu approved the request and allowed the families to collect the bodies for burial. Sun A Da's body was unclaimed and was buried by the funeral parlor. The police took photos of the body for file.</p>

The Hongkou Police Secret Service dispatched officers and arrested Chen Fugeng, a local man who drove for the automobile company. He was interrogated in the Special District Court, denied the charges, and was detained for investigation. All details were previously reported. Yesterday was another hearing. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that no other cases were found against the defendant during the remand period and the facts of the case are very clear. He asked the court to make a judgment according to the law.

<h3>Question of Whether They Are Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>Ding Yueying Claims He is Her Husband</p>
<p>Xu Yansen Does Not Acknowledge Her as His Wife</p>
<p>Ding Yueying, a woman from Liuhe County, Nanjing, previously retained a lawyer to sue Xu Yansen, the owner of the Central Apartments, in the French Court for bigamy and abandonment, seeking to recover alimony. She was summoned again the day before yesterday. First, the matchmaker, Wang Shusheng, stated that the merchant always had shops in his hometown of Liuhe County and often came to Shanghai to buy goods. When in Shanghai, he always stayed at the defendant's apartment and was also from the same hometown. Last year, the defendant told me that he lacked a wife and wanted to marry a woman from the same hometown, so he asked me to be the matchmaker. Therefore, I introduced the plaintiff to him as his wife. They were married on the eighth day of the eighth lunar month of last year in the Central Apartments. This is the truth. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that since the defendant denies marrying the plaintiff, why did he address the plaintiff's father as "Father-in-law" in his letters? The letters and red invitations are submitted as evidence. The defendant also retained a lawyer to defend him, and consistently denied marrying the plaintiff. Judge Zhu ordered that the matter be held for judgment.</p>
<h3>It is Difficult for the Law to Change a Woman's Heart</h3>
<p>Madam Ma Pan Insists on Divorce</p>
<p>A foreign resident named Ma Runxi, residing on Changan Road in Zhabei, found his wife, Madam Ma Pan, to be unchaste. In April of this year, Madam Ma Pan secretly committed adultery with Sun Xiaosan. Her husband, Ma Runxi, caught them in the act and reported them to the police, who took them to court. After investigation, the court found Ma Pan and Sun Xiaosan guilty and sentenced them to two months of forced labor each, to be served in prison. Recently, their terms expired, and Ma Runxi went to the prison to bring his wife back home for reconciliation. However, Ma Runxi recently filed a lawsuit with the District Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Pan of improper conduct and requesting an investigation. Madam Ma Pan also submitted a petition to the District Court Mediation Office, requesting a divorce, stating that she had been subjected to unbearable abuse and insults. Ma Runxi hired lawyer Liu Shiqi to respond. Yesterday, Judge Chen Bingxin held a mediation hearing. The petitioner, Madam Ma Pan, stated that she was 23 years old, from Funing, and requested permission for a divorce, intending to support herself in the future. She added that she had suffered unjustly during her two-month prison sentence and found it difficult to live with her husband. The opposing party, Ma Runxi, did not appear, but his lawyer, Liu Shiqi, stated that the petitioner had committed adultery and that after her sentence, Ma Runxi had gone to the prison to bring her back, hoping she would reform. However, she continued her affair with Sun Xiaosan. Therefore, Ma Runxi had filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting a thorough investigation. Regarding the divorce, the opposing party was adamantly opposed. The judge, seeing that mediation had failed, instructed Madam Ma Pan to file a formal lawsuit separately.</p>
<p>A Couple in Love is Arrested and Taken to Court</p>
<p>Yang Lanying and Li Youcai</p>
<p>Regrettably, Both Under Twenty Years Old</p>

He requested their arrest. The police were dispatched and arrested Li Youke, Li Youcai, and Yang Lanying. Lanying confessed that she loved Li Youcai's gentle nature and had been in love with him since last year, vowing to be together. Because her stubborn father refused to agree to their marriage, she ran away and stayed at the inn. She denied any relationship with Li Youke. Li Youcai confessed that they were in a free love relationship and that to become a married couple, he and Lanying had hidden in the inn to proceed with the marriage. Li Youke denied the allegations of joint enticement and rape. Because the case involved the enticement of a woman under 20 years old, they were transferred to the District Court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Military Officer Saved After Jumping into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Returning Home to Visit Relatives with Nowhere to Settle</p>
<p>Living in Poverty, He Resort to This Measure</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, a man suddenly appeared at Pier No. 10 near Guan Bridge in the Nanshi area and, taking advantage of the lack of attention, jumped into the Huangpu River. A patrol officer from the Pier Branch of the First District General Office of the Public Safety Bureau saw this and quickly called for nearby boatmen to rescue the man from the water. After being saved, he was taken back to the station. During the preliminary interrogation, the man claimed to be Zhu Guiren, 37 years old, from Hunan. He had previously served as an adjutant in the Fifth Route General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army. He resigned last year to return home to visit relatives. However, upon arriving in his hometown, he found that the area had been heavily disturbed by the Red Bandits and had nowhere to settle. He was forced to return to Shanghai, hoping to find a new job. However, he had been delayed until now without any success. Lacking any income, his life had become increasingly difficult, leading him to desperation. Feeling that there was no joy in this world, he had resorted to this measure. He requested understanding. He was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the City Public Safety Bureau for resettlement.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Colleagues of the Zhonghua Book Company Saying Farewell to Mr. Yao</h3>
<p>Mr. Yao Zhutian of the Zhonghua Book Company has served in the company for nearly 20 years. Mr. Yao has been the director of the Juzhen Imitation Song Department for 11 years. During this time, he oversaw the production of copper molds, design, and printing. His contributions have been significant. Works such as the "Sibu Beiyao" and "Twenty-Four Histories" were all managed and operated by Mr. Yao, and he has long been highly valued by General Manager Lufei Bohong. This time, due to other ambitions, he resigned from the company. His colleagues at the company, considering Mr. Yao's usual treatment of workers as brothers and his benefits to the labor movement, which were far from superficial, presented him with valuable gifts and took a group photo to commemorate the occasion. They also held a farewell banquet at the Southeast Hongqing Restaurant last night. During the banquet, worker representatives Rong Zhiqing and others, as well as Mr. Yao, delivered speeches, expressing many words of encouragement. The banquet concluded with joy at around 10:00 PM, amid the clinking of glasses.</p>

<h3>Asia Oil Company's Oil Tanker Sinks Ningbo Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>Losses of Approximately 40,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Ningbo fishing boat Jin Wanli was carrying over 2,320 dan of cargo, including tallow, bone, pit sand, and barrel sand, from Zhenjiang to Ningbo. Yesterday morning at around 4:00 AM, the boat was sailing near the black buoy of the Wusong Paotai Bay when an Asia Oil Company iron-hulled oil tanker, sailing outbound, mistakenly entered the wrong lane. The fishing boat captain, Wang Ashun, seeing this, quickly turned to avoid it, but it was too late. The fishing boat was struck in the middle and immediately split in two, sinking to the bottom of the sea. All thirteen crew members fell into the water. Fortunately, they were spotted by a patrol boat from the Jianghai Customs River Division, which immediately sped forward and rescued all the people from the water. Only one crew member, Chen, was injured. The entire cargo, worth approximately 30,000 yuan, and the boat itself, worth approximately 8,000 yuan, were lost. Zhou Xiexing Company has reported this to the Customs Marine Affairs Department, requesting serious negotiations with the Asia Oil Company. The River Division patrol boat believed that if the oil tanker had not made a small turn and entered the wrong lane, the accident would not have occurred. Therefore, the two pilots of the tanker were detained on the spot for questioning.</p>
<h3>Gambling Dens Raided and Taken Home</h3>
<p>Li Liansheng, a detective from the French Concession police force's gambling squad, and his assistant, Liu Kunbao, raided four gambling dens the other day. They were located at 32 Shuangguili, Laoshenfu Road, belonging to Xu Rongsheng; 156 Xinxinli, Jinshenfu Road, belonging to Xu Huibo; 11 Beilieli, Beile Road, belonging to Li Hangguan; and 35 Kangtifang, Kangti Road, belonging to Li Yulin. A large number of gambling documents were confiscated. They were taken to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, they were ordered to post bail and await summons for further questioning and punishment.</p>
<h3>Yuan Da, the Habitual Thief, Commits Another Crime</h3>
<p>Yuan Da, a habitual thief from Hongkou, is known for being a major cabin thief. He had previously colluded with accomplices to steal eleven boxes of rayon, four boxes of foreign feather silk, and six bundles of cork from a ship, worth a considerable sum. The case was investigated by the water police. The other day, Shen Agui, an assistant from the water police, saw Yuan Da stealing two bundles of cork from the Ceylon ship at the Wusai Pier. He was immediately arrested and taken to the police station. After questioning, his previous crimes were revealed, and he claimed that his accomplices were Liu Dazaozi and Tang Xiaoxiangzi. The police chief ordered the arrest of the remaining criminals, and Yuan Da was sent to the District Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Abusing an Apprentice</h3>
<p>Sentenced to a Fine of 150 Yuan</p>
<p>Ye Zaitang, a Yongbo native apprentice (16 years old) at the leather suitcase shop at 124 Peng Road, was severely beaten with a rattan cane by his master, Dong Xingshou, on the afternoon of the 6th of this month for being unruly at work, causing injuries all over his body. His hands were tied behind his back with hemp rope, preventing him from moving. He was later released by his fellow worker, Qian Agen, and his wife. After Ye Xianzheng, Ye Zaitang's uncle-grandfather, heard about the incident, he reported it to the Hongkou police station the other day. The police sent Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest the master, Dong Xingshou, along with the ropes and rattan cane. They were taken to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case, stating that the defendant should not have been so cruel. If the apprentice had made a mistake, his father or introducer could have been notified to take him back. Therefore, he requested the court to impose an appropriate punishment. Ye Xianzheng, the plaintiff, also submitted a complaint, and the apprentice, Ye Zaitang, showed the court his severe injuries. The red and purple marks on his back and legs were evident. Under questioning, the defendant admitted that he had beaten Ye because he had previously run away with leather goods. He was afraid that he would run away again, so he tied him up for about half an hour before being released. Qian Agen, a fellow worker, testified to the same effect. After verifying the confessions, Judge Xiao Xiefei sentenced Dong Xingshou to a fine of 150 yuan. If he chose imprisonment instead of paying the fine, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. The rattan cane and ropes were confiscated. The police lawyer, Li, requested that the defendant remain in custody during the appeal period. The court approved the request.</p>
<h3>Colluding to Release a Dove for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Shen Yuesong, a 35-year-old man from Songjiang, had been farming in his hometown. Because his family was poor, he remained unmarried even after reaching his thirties. However, over the years, he had been diligent and thrifty and had saved some money. He had the thought of starting a family. He met Li Zhangshi, an old woman from his village, and Luo Jinquan, who told him that there was a woman from Pudong named Wang Dushi, 26 years old, who was considered beautiful and had been struggling to make ends meet since her husband's death many years ago. She was considering remarriage and if he was interested, they could arrange it. Shen was pleased and, on the 26th of last month, through the mediation of the two, he paid a bride price of 110 yuan to marry Wang Dushi into his home to start a family. Unexpectedly, after the woman came to his house, she secretly ran away a week later without a trace. Shen was extremely upset by the loss of both money and person. He came to Shanghai the other day, and at around 7:00 PM that evening, he went to the home of the original matchmaker, Li Zhangshi, on Nancang Street outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi, intending to negotiate. Unexpectedly,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>he saw Wang Dushi at her house. Shen, realizing that these people were colluding to release a dove, was even more angry. He immediately snuck out and reported to the leader of the First District Detective Team of the City Public Safety Bureau, Dong Mingde, and others. They brought Li Zhangshi and Wang Dushi back to the First District General Office. During the preliminary interrogation, Wang Dushi confessed that she had been tricked into marrying Shen Yuesong by Li Zhangshi and Luo Jinquan's sweet words. After realizing this, she was unwilling to stay and secretly fled to Shanghai. Li Zhangshi made various excuses in her confession. They were ordered to prepare a document and send it to the City Public Safety Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Father and Daughter Injured by Tram</h3>
<p>Tong Jinyao, a 37-year-old man from Shaoxing, residing at 49 Xichengli, Sapo Sai Road, French Concession, worked at the Commodity Inspection Bureau. The other day, he went to Suzhou on business, taking his daughter, Xuezhen (4 years old), with him. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by express train from Suzhou. After arriving at the North Station at 10:00 AM, they walked out of the station with Xuezhen. As they were crossing the road, Tram No. 27, Route 6, driven by driver No. 394, came along. Because Tong was carrying his child, he was unable to avoid it in time and was hit and injured. Hua police officer No. 1254 arrived and sent the father and daughter to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that Tong's injuries are serious and life-threatening, while the girl's injuries are lighter.</p>

<h3>Various Industries Request Relief from Obstacles to the Implementation of the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Customs Still Uses the Old System, Making Customs Declarations Inconvenient</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received letters from the Flower Trade Association, the North-South Goods Exchange Association, and the Cured Meat Trade Association, requesting relief from the obstacles to the implementation of the new system of weights and measures, and forwarded them to the Social Affairs Bureau. The letter stated that the unified system of weights and measures in the city was scheduled to be implemented on July 1st. This matter concerns the overall commercial situation. Previously, during the general meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, it was publicly discussed that various industries should report their difficulties in writing for forwarding, showing great concern for the commercial situation and leadership. It is understood that revising the system of weights and measures is a new policy for the whole country, and the undersigned should comply with it. However, it is found that the goods sold, produced, transported, and distributed by the undersigned are closely related to customs declarations. At present, customs measurements still use the old system. All customs declarations, weighing, entering the warehouse, and loading are inconsistent. It is also not possible to convert them one by one, and accounting will inevitably become chaotic, leading to disputes. This is the first obstacle to prior change. Foreign trade and measurement have not changed. If the goods shipped and loaded are calculated according to the old system, it will not match the original weight of the store. If it is calculated according to the new system, it will not match the catties of other places. If you want to separately convert and indicate, it is not only troublesome, but also easy to make mistakes in the accounts and prices, confusing and unclear, and there is no way to take the standard, which will inevitably have a major impact. This is the second obstacle to prior change. The weights and prices of goods from other ports are based on the old system. Customs declarations and warehouses are mostly in the concession, which still follows the old practices. If the new system of customs forms and warehouse forms are used, the goods will not match, and there will be differences in the registration and filing. This is the third obstacle to prior change. In addition, the customs of the undersigned range from dozens of catties to two or three hundred catties. Each scale has at least two ropes, and the more there are three ropes. Because the goods are different, their uses are also different. The scales are also trained from a young age, so they can work quickly. Now the scales set in the testing institute only have one rope. I have requested to install new scales according to the old style, so that it can be applied, but it has not been done as desired. According to Yun, it is difficult to divide and order each scale with two ropes, not to mention three ropes. In fact, it is also impossible. Those who are called the order of heavy ones have nothing to use for light goods, and those who are called light ones cannot call heavy pieces. There are occasional extremely heavy pieces, which cannot be used without a sky scale as usual. How will those who use hooks to call be handled? This is the fourth obstacle to immediate change. All these four items have a common relationship, and the most difficult fact, other industries have different situations, and there are many kinds of difficulties that cannot be listed. In short, the measurement is related to national legislation, and it must be implemented. It should be diligently followed, but because it is related to the overall commercial situation, the circumstances are described in detail, and it is hoped that it will be forwarded and requested to be relaxed a little, so that it can be followed, etc. According to the 7th report, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the National Tariff Commission to review and reply to the new system of weights and measures used by the Customs. It is the implementation period. It is still far away, and the provinces and cities promote the new system, according to the original scheduled time, there are priorities, and Shanghai City has not been able to connect with it. It is the difficulties of the Guild and so on, which are indeed unavoidable facts. How should we consider appropriate remedial measures? Please ask Jun Bureau to give detailed instructions, so that they can be followed. The use of single ropes in the use of scales is very obstructive when exercising. According to the request of the Candle Industry Guild, the old system of weights and measures that has been forwarded for temporary destruction is also based on the proposal of the Dianye Guild, which is included in the resolution of the General Assembly. I have presented it to Jun Bureau for approval, and the Guild is asked to make a request in writing. I hereby ask Jun Bureau to forward it to the Testing Institute and investigators for proper handling.</p>

<h3>Epidemics in the City are Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>Citizens are Advised to Take Note</p>
<p>The weather has been cloudy and rainy for several days, with alternating cold and heat. The number of epidemics in the city is increasing. Jiang Shijun, the daughter of Jiang Xiahun, residing at 1199 Siwenli, Xinzha Road, suddenly clenched her teeth, foamed at the mouth, and lost consciousness on the evening of the 11th of this month. Her mother thought it was fever and asked someone to scrape her back and the insides of her wrists, leaving red and purple marks and blood stains, but it was ineffective. By 8:00 AM yesterday morning, she was breathing rapidly and was on the verge of death. She was sent to the Chinese Red Cross Epidemic Hospital on the right side of the New World for treatment. Wang Zhenchuan, the doctor on duty, immediately performed surgery such as injections. Soon, her mouth and eyes opened, and she was able to drink medicine. In a few minutes, she was able to speak. Another woman with the same symptoms was also treated by hospital doctors Zhou Hongzhang and Zhang Danqing and fully recovered.</p>

It will be built soon. In addition, the station's night telegrams are currently limited to 20 characters or more, and it has been decided that they must be 25 characters or more. These telegrams will be implemented simultaneously with submarine cable telegrams.</p>
<h3>Workers at Pudong Hengda Yarn Factory Strike for Two Hours</h3>
<p>Workers at the Pudong Hengda Yarn Factory were dissatisfied because the factory only replied to the union in a letter within 24 hours, refusing to reinstate six workers, including A Da. At 9:00 AM the other day, all the workers went on strike for two hours to show their solidarity and urge the capitalists to come to their senses. The factory sent representatives to ask the union to resume work temporarily and discuss the matter after the manager returned to the factory. The union advised the workers to resume work temporarily and after hearing that the manager had not returned to the factory at 9:00 PM, the workers became angry again and were about to strike again. After hearing about the situation, the manager immediately returned to the factory and sent someone to the union to request representatives to attend a consultation to resolve the issue. The union appointed representatives Chen Deheng, Hu Shaozhen, Qin Afa, and Lu Baohe to attend. They first asked the factory to immediately reinstate the six workers, including Chen A Da, who had been dismissed without cause, and then discuss all the conditions, so that the temporary strike could be avoided. Otherwise, the union would have no way to mediate. Manager Chen Zixin agreed in person to resign from his position as manager within a few days and act as a responsible mediator. The latest date for a satisfactory reply would be the 13th of this month. The union representatives believed that Chen Zixin seemed sincere and was an important figure in the Yangsi District Municipal Government, so there was hope for a satisfactory resolution. They were responsible for urging the workers to negotiate with the factory, endure a day or two, and wait for the factory to reply to the mediation, so that the labor unrest could be avoided from expanding. This was the most fortunate outcome. The storm subsided, and it was already past 10:00 PM. The representatives returned home and agreed to hold a joint meeting of the union the next morning to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Memorial from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to the Civil Training Committee</h3>
<p>Reasons for Repeatedly Presenting the Organization of a Trade Union</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union submitted a document to the Civil Training Committee, stating: "We respectfully request that this be forwarded to the Central Government, consulted with the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and the Ministry of Industry to stop the National Pharmaceutical Trade Association from fabricating rumors and undermining our association. We also wish to clarify the legality of our association's organization. We have learned that in early June of this year, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Central Government based on the request of the National Pharmaceutical Trade Association. The wording was absurd and insulting to our association. The entire document was intended to achieve the goal of dissolving our association and indulging their ambition to oppress workers. Therefore, they disregarded reason and treated the law as a mere formality. They also exaggerated their claims and engaged in rampant slander, accusing our association of being affiliated with the Communist Party, which is universally condemned throughout the country. They attempted to use cruel means to subject our association to unwarranted injustice and halt our activities. Their intentions are extremely sinister, but everyone knows what they are up to, how could they deceive the superiors who see everything clearly? Considering the history of our association, which has been evident since its establishment in the ninth year of the Republic, although it was once controlled by the General Labor Union, it was soon returned to the workers. (Omission) As for the claim that our association is not legally organized, workers of the same profession can legally organize a trade union, especially since it has been approved by the municipal party and government organs. How can it be said that the municipal party and government organs have also acted illegally? This principle is very clear and easily understood. The association's efforts are becoming increasingly clumsy and ridiculous. The work of our association members is divided and listed as follows: (1) Knife workers: specializing in slicing medicinal herbs, decocting tiger, deer, turtle, and donkey gelatin, etc. (2) Storage room workers: specializing in loading and unloading various slices, bringing them to the business counter, and sorting and selecting slices, etc. (3) General workers: specializing in all kinds of odd jobs such as washing, stir-frying, drying, packaging, calcining, and refining. (4) Raw material room workers: specializing in water-based honey pills, decocting pastes, etc. (5) Coarse goods room workers: specializing in the management of various raw materials. (6) Fine goods room workers: specializing in the management of all valuable goods and selecting raw materials. (7) Service workers: (A) Grinding room service workers: specializing in grinding various medicinal powders. (B) Warehouse service workers: specializing in carrying goods and all kinds of heavy odd jobs. (C) Kitchen service workers: specializing in kitchen management and food for the entire store. (8) Pill and powder workers: also responsible for hanging wax shells, mixing various fine materials into pills and powders, refining cinnabar powder, preparing eye medicine, and spreading plasters, etc. (9) Medicinal slice workers: also responsible for breaking Ophiopogon japonicus, splitting tangerine peel, cutting medicinal paper, and picking Tetrapanax papyrifer. (10) Gelatin factory workers: such as those at West Lake in Hangzhou, Huiquan in Wuxi, and the larger pharmacies in this city, all have gelatin factories in these locations. Every winter, workers are sent to the factories to decoct tiger, deer, turtle, donkey, and ejiao gelatin, etc. As mentioned above, the duties of workers in this industry are all technical and manual work, not direct service personnel. How can capital seek to destroy them? The actual situation is presented here, so it is self-evident whether this industry should be organized into a trade union. Therefore, we have prepared a document to submit to your committee, requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Government. If there is anything inappropriate, we ask that you review and implement it, which would be a great kindness. Respectfully submitted to the Public Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee."</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Abstract Translation of the Sixth Compilation of the Feetham Report</h3>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>An excerpt from Sun Chuanfang's speech in Shanghai on May 5, 1926, is cited to indicate the opposition of Chinese officials at the time to the expansion of the Public Concession or the construction of roads beyond the concession. The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in July 1927 is also mentioned in the report. The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government was the only Chinese municipal organ in Shanghai. The municipal government requested that the land of the roads beyond the concession and its adjacent areas be placed under its jurisdiction as part of the municipal government's area. The existence of the Public Concession's roads beyond the concession and the administrative measures taken by the bureau within the roads beyond the concession and its adjacent areas are an obstacle to the newly established Chinese municipal government's exercise of its functions in these areas and seem to be considered a permanent enemy of its functions. The desire of the Chinese municipal government to expand its scope of activities has led to the simultaneous exercise of functions by two organs in the same area, and various difficult problems have arisen as a result. I firmly believe that one thing must be admitted, that is, as far as the Public Concession itself is concerned, if the powers granted to the bureau by the Land Regulations are frankly acknowledged, the conflict between the two organs can obviously be avoided. However, considering the situation of the officials of the newly established Chinese municipal government, this kind of conflict is indeed practically unavoidable. The influence of politics and the party department has aggravated the difficulties inherent in the situation at the time and made the work of the representatives of both authorities, who all believed it was appropriate to negotiate a kind of temporary solution, even more complicated. The Public Security Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to effectively exercise its functions on a certain road beyond the concession, established police stations at locations adjacent to each road and sent armed police officers to patrol each road. One of their duties to be carried out at any time was to stop the work being carried out by the Public Concession's Public Works Department on each road. The Public Concession Bureau, in order to avoid any dangerous conflict between the two police organs, has since then no longer insisted on its claims to the roads that clearly belonged to the bureau, and the repair work needed for each road that had been stopped has also been put on hold. Before this work was recently established through friendly measures by both sides, the maintenance of most roads beyond the concession had been temporarily suspended, and some roads had even become almost impassable. The exercise of the rights granted to the public utility companies of the Public Concession within the area of the roads beyond the concession by the special franchise contracts signed between the companies and the bureau, was a problem that arose between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the companies. The current situation of the police on the roads beyond the concession is discussed in the report as follows: The municipal government police on duty on the roads beyond the concession are a group of trained people, and the Public Concession police officers who are often in contact within each area usually get along well with each other. However, the fact that two groups of armed officers are separately under the command of two authorities competing for jurisdiction and want to exercise police power and patrol the same road in the same area is inherently dangerous and easily seen. The municipal government police officers, in cases involving foreigners, mostly use intimidation tactics when trying to exercise their functions, partly due to a lack of experience and unfamiliarity with foreign languages, which has led to various difficulties. In addition to this kind of danger and difficulty, the necessary work to maintain each road and the business of each public utility company are hindered. From the point of view of the general public's interests, the current situation is extremely inconvenient and cannot be considered satisfactory by the authorities concerned.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>A special discussion of "The Current Situation and the Interests Involved" includes various statistical tables relating to all points related to the land of the roads beyond the concession. The nature of the residents of the land of the roads beyond the concession and the extent to which the residents of the Public Concession often travel to this land are discussed as follows: The Chinese and foreign residents living on the roads beyond the concession and its adjacent areas are actually an integral part of the residents of the Public Concession from both a social and economic point of view. Most of the foreign households and most of the Chinese households in the area of the roads beyond the concession are employed in the Public Concession during the day. The Chinese and foreign residents in the Public Concession are heavily dependent on the land of the roads beyond the concession as a place for recreation. In addition to Zhaofeng Park in the Western District and Hongkou Park and the playground in the Northern District, which were all established by the bureau, there is also a swimming pool established by the bureau in the Northern District, and private sports clubs in the Western District. The roads beyond the concession in the Western District are still mostly built with soil, probably for the purpose of racing. Therefore, in addition to the residents who actually live on the land of the roads beyond the concession, the Chinese and foreign residents in the Public Concession who often go to the land of the roads beyond the concession for entertainment and recreation are very numerous. And many, probably go every day. The administrative facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Concession Bureau on the land of the roads beyond the concession are all described. The construction of Zhongshan Road by the Shanghai Municipal Government in the Western District and the administrative measures in the Northwest and Northern Districts are also mentioned. Then another statistical table is mentioned, which is a list of the basic amount of money actually invested by the Public Concession Bureau in real estate projects and buildings on the land of the roads beyond the concession. And citing the numbers opened in the table, it shows that the basic investment of the bureau in these two areas is a total of Taels 10,039,110. Among them, Taels 2,894,660 were used for the price of the land used for road construction and the basic cost of building roads and their auxiliary projects. Another thing to be noted is that the numbers listed in the table are all based on the price of the land at the time of requisition and the cost of construction at the time of construction. The initial or main purpose of the projects undertaken by the Public Concession Bureau on the land of the roads beyond the concession was to seek benefits for the landlords and residents of each area. The nature and cost of this project are described in detail. And it is stated that the special donations collected by the bureau from the residents of the land of the roads beyond the concession are only slightly more than half of the estimated cost of the projects undertaken. But it is pointed out that when preparing the budget for each area, the part of the franchise fee paid by the bureau and each public utility company from the operating income in each area should be regarded as the local income of each area, which is fair. The amount of money that should be regarded as the local income of each area is estimated to be about Taels 175,000 per year. The report then points out that the projects undertaken by the Public Concession Bureau on the land of the roads beyond the concession, the projects built, and the cost of each project are listed in detail in the statistical table, which does not represent all of the administrative benefits of the Public Concession obtained by the residents of the roads beyond the concession. The residents of the land of the roads beyond the concession who pay municipal taxes to the bureau, in addition to the special benefits of the projects directly undertaken by the bureau in each area, also obtain various benefits. These residents can go to the bureau's hospitals for medical treatment, visit the bureau's parks, and send their children to the bureau's schools. The Public Concession's control of food through public health methods, as well as the services of various public utility companies under the supervision of the Public Concession authorities to a certain extent, are all beneficial to these residents. The taxes paid by these residents to pay for the various municipal administration is much smaller than what must be paid by those living within the Public Concession. The houses they live in are exempt from land tax, and the house tax they pay is also 2% lower than what is levied in the Public Concession. In terms of the amount of tax that must be borne, I believe that the residents and property owners of the land of the roads beyond the concession have been in a position that is too favorable to this day. The residents and property owners of the land of the roads beyond the concession enjoy various less obvious benefits because each area is adjacent to the Public Concession. The safety of the Public Concession enjoyed by these people is not insignificant. They also directly or indirectly benefit from the rule of law and the two principles of autonomy adopted by the Public Concession. As far as the relationship between these people and the bureau is concerned, the respect for their personal and property rights, the taxes they pay should be established according to a uniform and definite standard based on resolutions discussed and approved by the public, and the use and reimbursement of the taxes collected should be handled in the same way as those paid by the residents and property owners in the Public Concession, all of which have been guaranteed by the bureau. The residents and property owners of the land of the roads beyond the concession directly or indirectly enjoy various benefits due to the existence and activities of the Public Concession administration. The industrial value of each area has naturally also increased. However, although this benefit is great, in terms of the land price that has already been mentioned, there is a very real distinction between the industry within the Public Concession and the industry on the land of the roads beyond the concession. Once you cross the boundary line of the concession, the industrial value is reduced by 20%. This is due to the difference in safety between the Public Concession and the area beyond the concession. Regarding the general situation of all the existing and future interests of the bureau on the land of the roads beyond the concession, it is stated as follows: The existing interests of the bureau and the Public Concession society on the land of the roads beyond the concession, the amount of which is huge, and the variety of which is numerous, have already been described in detail. I believe that if the Public Concession still maintains its importance as a commercial and industrial center, and its population continues to increase, then the importance of each area to the Public Concession in the future will be much greater than it is now. The Public Concession society must obtain a kind of land in the adjacent places that can be reached by the Kangzhuang Avenue to be used for development. This kind of land must have both residential and business places, and the administrative situation of the land can attract residents and encourage the development of commerce. The tendency of the Public Concession headquarters to be too crowded is increasing with each year. It is still possible to create a residential area in the areas beyond the concession that can attract residents. There is a hope that a large-scale garden-style suburb can be developed to make the facilities for a happy life better than those in the crowded and unbearable Public Concession. The high land prices in the Public Concession have made houses expensive and the business burden has also been increased somewhat. However, the extent to which the landlords in the Public Concession enjoy the monopoly land price depends largely on the situation outside the concession. If the safety of each area adjacent to the concession is reduced or the administration is corrupt, it will make the land price in the Public Concession even higher. On the contrary, if the situation in the adjacent areas is improved, at least part of the monopoly value of the real estate in the Public Concession will be stripped away, and its land price will fall. There is also a problem, which is that for the benefit of the residents of the Public Concession, it is necessary to obtain bases to be used as various public places, such as schools, hospitals, and the most important sports fields. The Chinese society is becoming increasingly popular with various games and sports. If it is not in a large area near the Public Concession that can be reached by the avenue, the difficulty of expanding the convenience of sports will increase with each day. Under the existing situation, there is a great danger that the opportunity for future development will be lost due to the lack of sufficiently effective administration in the area of the roads beyond the concession. Therefore, a plan for constructing the city must be planned to ensure that the existing development of the land of the roads beyond the concession can proceed along a satisfactory path. The report then mentions that the benefits of the Shanghai Municipal Government on the land of the roads beyond the concession "belong to potential storage and there is no actual." And mentions the benefits of various public utility companies. The various interests that must be considered are outlined as follows: Any future administrative plan for the roads beyond the concession will affect public and private interests. This interest can be broadly divided into the following categories: (1) The interests of Chinese and foreign private households and property owners on the roads beyond the concession or in its adjacent areas, including the interests of factory owners. (2) The interests of the villagers living in the areas surrounded by the roads beyond the concession or served by the roads beyond the concession. (3) The interests of various public utility companies. (4) The interests of the bureau and the residents of the Public Concession. (5) The interests of the Shanghai Municipal Government. I believe that one thing must be admitted, that is, the benefits obtained by all the residents, individual property owners, and all the residents of the Public Concession in each area within the land of the roads beyond the concession have grown up under a kind of governance. No matter whether the legal basis of this kind of governance is sufficient or not, there may be any questions. The development that has gone through many years is mostly purely out of the pressure of needs. And not only has given great benefits to the Public Concession and its residents, but also to the land directly related to it and the villagers in the areas adjacent to it.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p>Discussing suggestions for the future. The requirements for any plan to be adopted for the future administration of the roads beyond the concession are stated as follows: I believe that the main purpose of this plan should be stated as follows: that is, the conflict that has arisen due to the mutual contention between the two sides for the administrative power of the roads beyond the concession should be eliminated, and sufficient regulations should be established to ensure that each area has effective administration and development in the future. In order to achieve this purpose and plan the plan to be adopted, considerable attention must be paid to political considerations. But I believe that there is also an important relationship that must be admitted, that is, no matter what this plan is, the legal claims and interests created by past history and the current situation for all the authorities, public utility companies, and all the residents and property owners, as well as the interests of the Public Concession society and the residents of its adjacent areas, should be fairly recognized as the basis of this plan to the extent that the land of the roads beyond the concession is mutually related. Five alternative methods for dealing with the future of the land of the roads beyond the concession, which have been proposed or considered at various times, are summarized. The first two methods are as follows: (1) Expand the Public Concession to include the land of the roads beyond the concession. (2) The Public Concession abandons any claim to participate in the administration of each area, abolishes the concession police officers in each area, and stops the concession administration in each area. The above two methods, because they cede the legal claims and interests of party A to party B, have both been discarded. The third alternative method is to divide the land of the roads beyond the concession between the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Concession Bureau for management, that is, part is merged into the Public Concession, and the remaining part is completely governed by the Shanghai Municipal Government. This method has also been rejected. Because the general Chinese opinion does not agree with any expansion of the Public Concession. And from the Public Concession's point of view, any plan that would allow the Public Concession to completely cede all interests outside the railway tracks (i.e., the proposed boundary line) in the Western District cannot be considered satisfactory due to the nature of the existing interests of the Public Concession in this part of the Western District and the extent to which the future development of the concession must be affected. The remaining two methods are discussed as follows: In addition, there are two other alternative methods, that is, adopting some form of joint administration and creating a new organ. I believe that the most promising way to solve the administrative problem of the land of the roads beyond the concession is to adopt some form of joint administration first, and hope that a more comprehensive plan can be adopted later to establish a new organ for the administration of the land of the roads beyond the concession. Therefore, I suggest that one thing must be admitted, that is, the various problems involved must be dealt with in two phases. In the first phase, there cannot be a complete and final solution. Only the plan adopted in the first phase that is helpful for the time being should be planned so that it can guide the second phase to adopt a more comprehensive and more permanent plan. (End)</p>

<h3>Jiaohe Ninth Normal School Teachers and Students Go on Hunger Strike to Petition</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 12th telegram: The students of Jiaohe Ninth Normal School previously elected representatives last month to come to Tianjin to request the removal of Principal Sang Danfeng. Zhang Jian'an, the director of the Education Department, detained the petitioning representatives and has not released them yet. The students were greatly angered and elected 40 more representatives to walk north to Tianjin on the 12th. They immediately went to the Provincial Government to petition for the release of the students and the removal of the principal, but they were unsuccessful. As a result, the students became even more angry and have decided to go on a complete hunger strike from today onwards. If they do not achieve victory, they vow to fight to the death. According to the representatives, their school was forced to leave the school on the 9th by Li Fuhe of the Fifth Brigade, together with County Magistrate Liu Yangyan, leading an armed platoon. Otherwise, they would all be shot. More than 300 students could only cry and leave the school, lodging in broken temples, without money to return home. Today, they met Director Zhang to request the restoration of the school, or to issue travel expenses so that the students can return home, but they were rejected. The colleagues appealed with a hunger strike, hoping to move the director to pity. If there is no solution tomorrow, they will send a letter inviting all the students to come to Tianjin and starve to death at the Education Department.</p>

<h3>Record of the International Agricultural Conference (2)</h3>
<p>(Sent by Mr. Tang Huisun, Chinese Representative, from Prague)</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>The conference proposals were the sole task of this session. The proposals were proposed by various members last year and decided by the International Agricultural Commission at a meeting in Brussels, Belgium in August last year. The proposals for this conference are divided into seven groups: (1) Agricultural Policy and Agricultural Economics, (2) Agricultural Education and Publicity, (3) Agricultural Cooperation, (4) Plant Production, (5) Animal Production, (6) Agricultural Technology, (7) Rural Women. The important proposals are as follows: 1. How to balance the supply and demand of agricultural products in various countries. 2. The dissemination of various modern wireless telephones, movies, agricultural exhibitions, etc. to rural areas. 3. Agricultural cooperation training should focus on practical application and excellent results. 4. Investigate the current situation and progress of agricultural cooperation in the world. 5. New varieties obtained through selection breeding must be legally protected from a national and international standpoint. 6. How to apply genetic theory to improve the economic production of livestock. 7. Management and production of fish ponds. 8. How to balance the market supply and demand of potato processing and preservation. 9. The role of women in rural prosperity. 10. Rationalization of farm household management (home economics). A total of seventeen proposals were discussed in group meetings over several days, resulting in appropriate solutions to solve various important international agricultural problems in modern times.</p>
<h3>Travel and Sightseeing</h3>
<p>The conference organizing committee has a travel and sightseeing group dedicated to handling the travel and sightseeing of members and representatives. During the conference, groups are divided to visit sites outside of meeting hours. Guides who can speak German, French, and Czech explain separately. For several days, they visited famous sites in Prague and agricultural vocational schools, cooperative unions, the Czech agricultural exhibition, and rural areas near Prague. In addition, after the conference, they divided into six groups to investigate agriculture in various parts of the Czech Republic. I also joined the visit for six days to observe the overview of cooperative areas in Czech rural areas.</p>
<h3>Czech Hospitality</h3>
<p>Czech President Masaryk is a scholar with prominent political achievements, praised by the world. The Czech people love and respect him very much. Statues of the President are built everywhere in Prague, and portraits of the President are hung everywhere. The depth of their respect can be seen. This International Agricultural Conference was held in the Czech Republic, and President Masaryk gave it great consideration. Representatives of various governments were received by Czech government officials. The President also held regular receptions and banquets for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The conference was held in Prague for four days, and the closing ceremony was held on the afternoon of June 8. The proposals of each group were read out one by one and unanimously approved by the audience. The conference has resolved that the 16th International Agricultural Conference will be held in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, in 1933. I will report on the conference proposals separately in the future, as these resolutions are quite important and worthy of our country's participation. I sincerely hope that our country's authorities will pay special attention to this type of international conference. The representatives attending each conference should be designated as soon as possible, so that they can prepare early and make suggestions at the conference, or receive information on the improvement of agriculture in our country and introduce it to the conference to enhance the international agricultural status.

<p>San Francisco, 10th - Madam Matty Weills stated that she is considering a tour of the East. The Japan Lawn Tennis Association has invited her to perform in Japan, and she feels that the time is ripe. Madam Matty hopes to give several performances in China, Japan, and the Philippines, approximately after participating in the Anglo-American Women's Wightman Cup tennis competition and the US National Tennis Championships.

<p>Beiping, 12th - The Jiangnan track and field team left for Tianjin at 8 o'clock this morning and will return directly to Shanghai. The trip to Jinan has been canceled.</p>
<h3>Record of the Jiangnan Track and Field Team's Northern Expedition (2)</h3>
<p>| From Nanjing to Tianjin |</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Northern Expedition Track and Field Team arrived safely in Tianjin on the evening of the 30th and stayed at Nankai Middle School. The situation along the way is described as follows:</p>
<h3>Athletes Cross the Yangtze River and Show Their True Colors</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 28th, for the convenience of crossing the Yangtze River the next day, the entire team moved to the Dazhi Building Hotel by the river and rested. On the morning of the 29th, they got up at 5:30 AM and finished breakfast. Then, they crossed the river. Anyone with travel experience who carries luggage across the river is afraid of the journey. Fortunately, all of our team members were unwilling to be scammed by the porters. They carried their luggage themselves from the pier to the ferry and from the ferry to the train. This saved time and avoided trouble. All the passers-by praised them. At 10 AM, the train departed. The seats were very spacious, because the Tianjin-Pukou stationmaster had reserved half a car in advance, and no one else was allowed to mix in, so it was quite comfortable. After the train passed Linhuai Pass, it began to rain lightly, and the weather suddenly became cool. The train traveled between Xuzhou and Dong'an, which was the time for us to sleep.</p>
<h3>The Train Turns into a Water-Soaked Chicken</h3>
<p>On the 30th, several team members who got up early saw Mount Tai looming in the distance. With a shout, the entire team woke up and leaned out of the windows, all eager to see Mount Tai. But in the cloudy and rainy weather, the peaks were hidden in the clouds, which was very disappointing. After the train passed Tai'an, the rain became heavier and heavier, and the wind blew harder and harder. The roof of the train leaked, making almost the entire car wet. The team members suffered greatly, and the weather suddenly turned cold. It was necessary to wear wool or cotton clothing. Fortunately, the team members had prepared in advance and did not suffer. The train arrived at Tianjin Central Station at 10:30 AM. Zhang Jiwu (Association), Yang Junru (Dagong Bao), Kong Zhaokai (Guowen), Zhao Quan (Yong Bao), Ding Jichang (Yishi Bao), and more than ten representatives of other organizations were waiting at the station. They then took cars to Nankai Middle School and stayed in the student dormitory. Unfortunately, there were many bedbugs, and most of the team members did not sleep well. They will move to the classroom to live in, which will be more comfortable. The reception here is very thorough and meticulous, and the team members are quite satisfied.</p>
<h3>Tilden Discusses This Year's US Professional Tennis Championships</h3>
<p>| Talented Players Gathered, Who Knows Who Will Win? |</p>
<p>New York, June 14 - World-renowned tennis star Tilden, in his capacity as a professional tennis player, has made a statement regarding the National Professional Tennis Championships to be held on July 6 at Forest Hills.</p>
<h3>Talented Players Gathered</h3>
<p>In this competition, the former champion Kreigkau Shanlu, the runner-up Fenson Li Queke, Falake Xiangtuo, Howard Kimshan, Amman Tuo Guhe, Bao Peishan La, Hawie Shi Nagelas, Kaliute, myself, and major European players will be called upon to attend. At that time, a contest on the green lawn will be quite spectacular.</p>
<h3>Two Good Men</h3>
<p>I have played against both the former champion Kau Shanlu and the runner-up Li Queke. From my observations, the two have their own characteristics. Li's magical volley and Kao's comprehensive defense cannot be denied by anyone. When the two compete, Kao has a stable advantage on hard courts, and Li can win on grass or indoors. The two have met thirty times, and Kao has won twenty-four times. How their skills are, can be imagined.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Championship</h3>
<p>Based on a scientific perspective, the four players in this championship's semi-finals will be either Cox, Li, Hentoff, or myself. However, if major European players like Abbott, Pank, Roman, Jack, Martin, and Pollock participate, there might be some adjustments. Regardless, Cox will strive to maintain his reputation as champion. Li has long aimed to win the title, and Hentoff is talented and unwilling to be defeated. It remains unknown who will claim the championship in the future. (Reporter's note: Tilden's ambition and yearning for the throne are evident in his writing, though not explicitly stated.)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Hornet Fitness Team</h3>
<p>Promotion of Sports by Professionals</p>
<p>The employees of the customs declaration industry in the Beiyang district of this city, in order to promote sports and foster camaraderie among colleagues, have specially organized a Hornet Fitness Team, with fitness as its goal. On the 9th at 9:00 AM, a formal inaugural meeting was held at the Hat Industry Association on Huajin Road, where the team was officially established. The meeting also involved the election of officers and discussion of all operational matters. Over thirty team members were present. The election results were as follows: Liu Jianchang was elected captain, Tang Shaolian as vice-captain, Song Chuanhao and Zhou Kequan as general affairs officers, Tao Yongli as secretary, and Qi Shusen as treasurer. The team is organized into six sections: basketball, mini-soccer, tennis, table tennis, track and field, and soccer. Field events and volleyball are in the planning stages. To limit membership, the team will not accept non-customs declaration personnel. At the same time, customs declaration workers are welcome to join. For basketball and mini-soccer, invitations for matches are welcome. The correspondence address is: Tao Yongren, No. 6 Hengye Lane, Jiangxi Road; Liu Jianchang, Yong Sheng Xing Hang, No. 13 Guangdong Road.</p>

<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Glass School Buildings</p>
<p>Germany has always held the highest position in the world regarding educational methods. Recently, a new school has been established with unprecedented architecture, unlike any other in the world. The walls of all classrooms are not made of brick and stone but entirely of glass. Even the bookshelves and cabinets displaying student achievements are made entirely of glass. Furthermore, the outer walls are also entirely of glass, ensuring ample sunlight in the classrooms without any lack of light. In the chemistry lab, each desk is equipped with water, electricity, and gas facilities for student convenience. There is also a large greenhouse, where flowers bloom year-round, continuously through all seasons. One classroom is equipped with a new astronomy machine, allowing students to study the stars at any time of day. Most pleasing to the students is the school's attached tavern, where they can drink alcohol. Moreover, each classroom has a washbasin. With such a modern and delightful school, students will certainly not skip classes.</p>
<p>Criminal Opinions</p>
<p>The prison authorities in New York City, USA, are seeking to improve prisons and have specially offered rewards for prisoners to submit opinion letters, criticizing the current state of prisons and suggesting improvements. The prisoners were overjoyed upon receiving this news and engaged in writing. However, people in society are discussing whether, if prison treatment is improved too much, criminals might become too comfortable, and more people might commit crimes in the future.</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers Regarding International Affairs</h3>
<p>— Xu Wusheng</p>
<p>The reason why white women are so fond of yellow men: A European woman with great vision fell in love with a handsome Chinese man. At the peak of their love, she said to the man, "My dear, I am a woman who has traveled the world. I have seen many races, but today I met you. You are the dearest person to me in my life. I cannot leave you." However, the man's thoughts about such rhetoric had already become a cliché, likely due to temporary encounters with the opposite sex. Based on the man's experience and what was imprinted in his mind, he couldn't escape the idea that Easterners are Easterners, and Westerners are Westerners. If these two sides could become one, the Yellow River would run clear. Therefore, the man forced himself to ask the woman, "What is the purpose of your love for me? And I must first state that I am a Chinese man among Eastern yellow people. Please do not forget this question."</p>
<p>The white woman replied, "What I love about you is your yellowness. Don't you know the color of lemons? Isn't it yellow? It is loved by people all over the world. Its color is elegant and beautiful, its nature is firm and durable, and it has lasting value, making it the most noble of fruits. You must also not forget that your China is the birthplace of Eastern culture. This culture contains endless profound philosophy. Therefore, we come to China to obtain the true truth of culture, which requires getting close to your countrymen."</p>
<p>Forgiving Debt and Repaying Money: A friend of an English pastor borrowed some money from him. On Sunday, he prepared to repay the money. Unexpectedly, the pastor was preaching in church, reciting the prayer, "Matthew 6:12," singing, "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." The men and women in the congregation all said the same. The friend who was repaying the debt heard this prayer and thought, "This English pastor is a truly good person. He is willing to forgive my debt." Then he thought of his sick child at home and decided to use the money for medical expenses. If he repaid the pastor, he would have no money for treatment. After the service, the pastor saw his friend and said happily, "Did you bring all the money, including the interest?" The friend who was repaying the debt said to him, "What did you say in the Bible just now? You clearly said you wanted to forgive my debt. Does that mean you have given up the money I owe you? No wonder American President Hoover has the same intention towards Germany. Is it implementing the teachings of the Bible? So, the reason I don't need to repay you the money now is that I need to get medical treatment for my child first." The pastor replied, "Forgiving other people's debts is possible, but you must first repay the money you owe me. Your child's illness and the need to buy medicine and see a doctor are separate issues and have nothing to do with me." (Chou)</p>
<h3>Records of Ye Han Cheng</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingqing</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Hancheng of Nanhui is a progressive figure who studied in the East and an outstanding member of the Tongmenghui. Over the years, he has worked tirelessly for the revolution and can be said to have contributed to the party and the nation. After the European War, he studied in Berlin, expanding his knowledge. He then obtained a doctorate and served as an assistant professor at the University of Berlin. In 1920, he returned to China and took a teaching position at Peking University. When the Premier was in Guangdong, he organized the Grand Marshal's Office. Since 1926, he has been in charge of the Wuzhou Gubenzao Pharmaceutical Factory, making great achievements and praised by his friends. Recently, a celebration was held for the double auspicious birthday of Mr. and Mrs. Ye. Contemporary talents, such as Yu Youren, Niu Yongjian, Ye Chucang, Shao Lizi, Ma Junwu, Jiang Menglin, Lian Nanhu, and Chen Taoyi, all old friends, launched a celebration for Mr. Ye's birthday. Mr. Huang Renzhi composed a poem: "Unexpectedly, the events of twenty-eight years ago, nine deaths, a few young men, a hundred plans to realize a great dream, I will send the worries to the zenith of glory. This person has this disease. It is doubtful that it can be handled. The spirit is through all the senses. This intention of life to others and self-life, the day is in the middle of the hundred years." According to Mr. Renzhi and Mr. Ye, during the Guangxu period, they were all enthusiastic about the party and the country, striving to instill culture in the mainland, awaken the national soul, and open up the trend. Unfortunately, they were jealous of the Qing officials and almost sacrificed for the revolution. Now, revisiting the old Nansha, there is no feeling of looking back on the past.</p>
<h3>The Analysis of Love</h3>
<p>— Yunying</p>
<p>Great scientists can use counter-scientific methods to analyze and solve the infinite problems of the universe, but no one has ever been able to give an absolute explanation of "love." Love is originally a mysterious flower. It is produced in the garden of nature, irrigated by nature, grows naturally, bears natural fruits, but does not disappear naturally.</p>
<p>Love cannot take "seduction" as its starting point. Its starting point should be "sympathy."</p>
<p>Love cannot take "flattery" as its fertilizer. Its fertilizer should be "sincere comfort."</p>
<p>Love cannot take money or physical and other material conditions as its purpose. Its purpose should be "pure mutual support."</p>
<p>Love cannot be plundered by power. It should be demanded by justice.</p>
<p>Love has no trace of coercion. It is entirely a natural inspiration.</p>
<p>If there is a man who uses intimidation or deception to force a woman to sacrifice, this is definitely not love. What is it then?</p>
<p>If, between a pair of opposite sexes, what is relied upon to maintain them is not love, what will be the result?</p>
<p>If a man does not understand what love is, but a woman cannot but sacrifice his love, what is the reason?</p>
<p>No matter what encyclopedia we read, we cannot get an explanation of the above questions. However, as long as we have the opportunity to see the new film "The Killer Miss" by the Star Film Company, it will definitely give you a very accurate answer.</p>
<p>This article of mine is definitely not to promote "The Killer Miss" because I think the answers to these questions, apart from "The Killer Miss," can give me an explanation. I can't find it elsewhere, so I dare to say that.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Commemorative Meeting</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The Shanghai giant merchant Mr. Yu Qiaqing’s 50th anniversary of his stay in Shanghai was held at the Grand China Hotel the day before yesterday. The decoration was rich and the ceremony was solemn. Mr. Yu deserves the credit for his lifelong career that contributed to the society and the country. I humbly attended this grand event and saw and heard many interesting things. I will extract one or two to share with the readers.</p>
<p>A conference of fellow villagers: The guests who signed in at the memorial meeting each day numbered more than 6,000. Although there were quite a few foreign guests and people from various provinces, 80-90% were Ningbo people. Most of the speakers spoke in the Ningbo dialect, and the guests also conversed in this way. Some said that this event was no different from a conference of fellow villagers. Foreign Minister Wang said that Mr. Yu was not only a Ningbo person from Ningbo, a Ningbo person from Zhejiang, but also a Ningbo person from China. The meaning behind it is worth pondering.</p>
<p>The interest of the speech: The speeches at the celebration were the most brilliant on the first day, and each was based on their respective positions. For example, Mayor Zhang said that Mr. Yu has made 50 years of efforts in Shanghai's business community, financial sector, and the construction of Greater Shanghai has been of great help. Foreign Minister Wang said that Mr. Yu's success lies in his efforts, for his career, for society, and for the country. He makes every effort at all times and continues to work hard for 50 years to achieve today's success. Yuan Ludeng spoke about the shipping industry. Lin Kanghou called himself a younger brother and said that Mr. Yu is 65 years old and I am 56 years old. If we each set aside 50 years, then I am only 6 years old. Isn't it a younger brother? The general idea is related to the banking industry. Ye Huijun said that Mr. Yu came to Shanghai barefoot at the age of fifteen. After 50 years of hard work, although his career was successful, he was still a poor man and a barefoot friend. Mr. Yu never puts on airs. Sometimes when he returns to Ningbo, he sits in third class and hangs out with the sailors, and he has never heard foreigners laugh at him as "Dammfull." The audience all burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The problem of eating: There are so many guests, so it is difficult to solve the problem of eating. This excellent event was contracted by the Deng Tuomo Hotel. A total of 12,000 Western dishes were served in two days. The hotel originally had only 40 waiters. This time, due to the insufficient distribution of work, he recruited from various restaurants. Add more than a hundred people. They all wear new D M C numbers. However, because it was newly compiled temporarily, it was difficult to command. Guests dine, originally standing. (Buffet Lunch) More than a dozen rows of long tables were placed in the Italian Hall of the Grand China Hotel. Men, women, old and young occupy the table. Stand and eat. Laughter is mixed. Not a few times. In foreign banquets or garden parties with more than a thousand people, there are often so-called standing meals. It is still an innovation in our country. Some guests have to wait for a long time to eat. There are many disputes. The business group members who maintained order announced martial law. The waiters carried the dishes. Sending staff to escort is also an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Poor Dancing: At 9:00 PM, the dance music was loud. The audience surrounded the surroundings. They all wanted to take a peek at the social dance. The China Tianyi Company put a strong electric light in the field to film. The average dancers were reluctant to see it. Even Miss Xiuyun, the granddaughter of the dance group director Lao Qia, was not seen in the audience. Only Lao Qia's son-in-law Jiang Yiping embraced one or two eight beauties and danced the foxtrot. He was very interested. His wife, Ms. Danru, was unhappy about it.</p>
<p>General Statistics: This conference can be said to be unprecedented at sea. Each department has a total of more than 350 employees. More than 8,000 visiting coupons were issued. 12,000 commemorative badges. The collected gifts exceeded 100,000 yuan, all of which were used to open the Sanbei Hospital. More than 2,000 gifts, mostly silver shields, silver cups, streamers, and couplets. As for beer, more than 400 dozen were drunk. Yili and Shegsheng, two kinds of soda, totaled more than 3,000 dozen. It's hot. This drink is especially needed for guests to cool off. Yesterday's motorcade, the Engineering Bureau initially allowed 50 vehicles as the limit. There were more to join along the way, more than 200 vehicles. Mighty and mighty, like a living tiger and dragon. Wherever it passes, traffic is cut off. Citizens sighed as a spectacle.</p>
<p>Rotary Club</p>
<h3>？？？（20）</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>After the wife finished speaking, she left lightly. Not long after, the noise in the front room became louder again.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Pan feeling unwell and lying in bed?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he is resting in the back room."</p>
<p>"I want to see him!"</p>
<p>Zi Liang's heart was pounding, as if a patient had met a life-threatening ghost. He didn't even have time to hide.</p>
<p>"Mr. Pan! Are you feeling unwell? We haven't seen each other for a long time."</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you?"</p>
<p>Zi Liang thought, "I just don't like you two noisy people. Other than that, I don't feel unwell at all." So, he looked at his wife, almost saying, "Why did you say I was sick?"</p>
<p>"Do you have a headache?"</p>
<p>Zi Liang nodded. Actually, his head didn't hurt at all, but he thought that seeing you two female generals really gave him a headache, so he nodded to indicate yes.</p>
<p>"Does your stomach hurt?"</p>
<p>Zi Liang had to shake his head. He thought, "Don't ask me like a doctor, how's my appetite? How's my bowel movement?" If you ask me one by one like that, my perfectly healthy body will really get sick."</p>
<p>"Just a headache? That's easy!"</p>
<p>After saying this, she turned to his wife again:</p>
<p>"Call the maid to bring a glass of water!"</p>
<p>The wife really called the maid to pour a glass of water. Zi Liang didn't understand what she meant. Could it be that she knew massage? He saw her take out a small glass bottle from her side, removed the stopper, and poured two white pills from the bottle onto the desk:</p>
<p>"This is a miracle medicine specially for headaches. I often take it. It's almost always effective. Take these two pills with water, and your headache will be gone in less than ten minutes."</p>

<p>Sharp Rebound in the Gold Market Last Week in Financials</p>
<h3>Silver Price Reduction and Stock Drop are the Main Reasons</h3>
<p>Last week, the gold market rose sharply and rapidly, breaking through the 740 tael mark. However, the waves were turbulent, with fluctuations of more than ten taels per day, creating a confusing situation and making it difficult for people to take action. Starting from the early morning of the beginning of the week at 698.5 taels, it immediately exceeded 700 taels. Subsequently, the ups and downs were erratic. By Thursday, it had reached 742 taels, then hovered around 30 taels. This week saw a total fluctuation of 43.5 taels, with a total increase of 26.4 taels. This was due to conflicting news regarding the suspension of European war debts, resulting in unpredictable changes. Overseas silver markets continued to decline sharply, and New York stocks also trended lower. The Shanghai market's foreign exchange was quite tight (a reduction of three and a half grades). Actual transactions in banks were still lively. Chinese gold businesses were again trying to cover their short positions, but they were still in a short position. The exchange rate between the Japanese yen and gold was pressed down by 30 to 40 taels. Existing spot goods from July had not yet been completely cleared. The current cash reserves of various firms are about 30,000 bars, but the sales of bare bars are sluggish, leading to lower prices than before. The forward gold tenders increased by more than 11 taels. If the German loan is successful, the future of gold prices may fall. The general situation of the week is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Rose 26.4 Taels Day by Day</h3>
<p>Since Monday (6th), the standard silver price was reduced by 0.0625, and there was no market for silver prices. Almost the sterling was also reduced by one grade, and the internal situation tightened. As for the August gold tender, the initial opening fell by 5 taels, amounting to 698.5 taels, because it was heard that the US-French debt issue seemed to be settled. And the sellers were active. Soon the buyers launched an attack, and the exchange rate also loosened, immediately breaking through 710 taels. Subsequently, it was uncertain up and down and had receded within 10 taels. In the afternoon, the upward trend suddenly turned strong, and buyers were brave, and the closing price was 14.2 taels, which was 10.7 taels higher than last Saturday. However, transactions were not strong, which was actually due to the new wooden fence in the arena and the employment of outsiders as inspectors, and those without a certificate were not allowed to enter the transaction, so it aroused the opposition of various brokers, and even went to the director to question and demand the removal of foreign inspectors, the market order was chaotic for a while, and the transactions on the table were not affected, and the difference in the market throughout the day was 15.7 taels. The next day, the standard silver price was again 0.125 lower, the silver price fell by 0.375, and the sterling was again reduced by one grade. The internal market was stable, and the industry was scrambling to buy and sell. The initial opening of the gold market was 717.5 taels, a slight increase of 3.3 taels, and soon it jumped to 10 taels, amounting to 27 taels. Subsequently, the Guangdong group and hedging, etc. sold, and the price immediately fell to 18 taels. At noon, it became more moderate and remained outside 20 taels. In the afternoon, the sellers were sensitive and the exchange rate also loosened, falling by more than 10 taels to only 709 taels. The closing price was pulled to 710.09 taels, but it was slightly lower by 3.3 taels compared with the previous day. The difference in the front and rear markets was 18 taels. On Wednesday, the standard silver price rose by 0.0625, the silver market did not change, and the sterling was reduced by half a grade. The internal market was also strong, so the gold price opened with an increase of 7.1 taels, amounting to 18 taels. Also, due to the sharp drop in New York stocks, it receded from 23.5 taels to 16.5 taels, and then was taken over by a speculator named Wu, jumping more than 10 taels, to 29 taels. At noon, hedging, etc. were sold, suppressing the price by a little more than 10 taels. The closing price rebounded by 4 to 5 taels. In the afternoon, it was still firm, reaching 28.5 taels. The result was 27.1 taels, which was 16.2 taels higher than the previous day. The difference in the market throughout the day was 12.5 taels. The next day, the standard silver price fell again by 0.25, and the silver price plummeted by 0.75, so the sterling was also reduced by one grade. The internal market was very tight. Almost the gold market opened high, at 736.5 taels, and the New York stock market also fell, followed by 37.5 taels, but the Dalian group and Guangdong group, etc. sold, conceding more than 5 taels, to 32 taels. Afterwards, it frequently rose to the clouds, but the exchange rate was particularly strong, and at noon it suddenly reached 742 taels. In the afternoon, because the news of the strict handling of the Korean people's riots in Wanbaoshan came, people's hearts were frustrated, reaching 32 taels, and the closing price was 37.2 taels, which was still 10.01 taels higher than the previous day. There was only a slight fluctuation of 1 tael throughout the day. On Friday, the standard silver price was again reduced by 0.25, and the silver price also fell by 0.25, so the sterling did not change, and the internal market seemed loose. The gold market immediately fell by 8.2 taels, to 29 taels, followed by 27 taels, but the buyers were not lonely, rising to 34.4 taels, and then speculators such as Lu sold, so it receded to 27 taels. At noon, it hovered around 30 taels. In the afternoon, the selling atmosphere was very strong, suddenly falling to 24.8 taels, until the closing price was 26.7 taels, a drop of 10.05 taels compared with the previous day. In short, the air is bad and people's hearts are floating. On Saturday, the standard silver price rose by 0.1875, and the silver price rose by 0.125, so the sterling did not change, but the gold market opened high, at 33.5 taels, followed by 5.5 taels. Afterwards, it hovered on a small scale, receding to 30 taels, and at noon it was 28 taels. Until the closing price of 29.9 taels, a slight increase of 3.2 taels compared with the previous day. However, after the closing price, it continued to be done to 32 taels. In half a day, only 7.5 taels fluctuated, and the overall market did not have major changes. The high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets and foreign exchange gold tenders are listed below:</p>

<h3>The Copper Cash Market is Falling Step by Step</h3>
<p>A turnaround is expected today.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a bank holiday. The market was weak, and the price of cash continued to decline. The early and midday markets were both at 7 qian 2 fen 4 li and a half, a drop of 3 hao 7 xus and a half compared to the previous day. The silver demolition rebounded by 2 fen, totaling 6 fen. The early and midday markets were also the same. The value of the drafts made was 562,000 in the early market and 225,000 in the midday market.

<h3>Securities: Last Week's Bond Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The trend moderates with over 9.2 million in transactions</p>
<p>During the past week, the spot and futures market conditions for various bond maturities in the Shanghai securities market were very active in the first half of the week. Buying and selling interest was lively, and activity in major bonds was vibrant. However, the market suddenly turned quiet in the second half of the week, with all parties adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Daily trading volume was only around 10,000 yuan, likely because the overall bond market environment was dull and bond prices were increasingly stagnant. Total turnover for the week was 9,215,500 yuan, with twenty-year customs duties being the most actively traded, accounting for 3,393,500 yuan, divided into 2,666,500 yuan for the July期 and 727,000 yuan for the August期. Twenty-year tobacco bonds amounted to 1,705,500 yuan, divided into 1,314,000 yuan for the July期 and 391,500 yuan for the August期. Other bonds were quiet, mainly because the supply of spot goods in the market was gradually decreasing and prices had risen significantly. For example, the 1920 issue amounted to 1,131,500 yuan, the 1920 customs issue to 1,094,000 yuan, Disbandment bonds to 751,500 yuan, Reorganization bonds to 614,000 yuan, the 1996 public bonds to 321,000 yuan, customs duties to 116,500 yuan, Readjustment 6% bonds to 82,000 yuan, 7-year bonds to 5,500 yuan, and Financial bonds to 5,000 yuan. Spot transactions were very few, with a total weekly turnover of 92,400 yuan, including 34,000 yuan for the 1920 customs issue, 21,400 yuan for the 1920 issue, and several thousand yuan each for Disbandment 7-year bonds. In addition, 20 shares of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were traded unexpectedly. Due to the thriving business of the exchange, its price had risen by 16 yuan and 9 jiao compared to the end of last year. Regarding the price trends of various bonds during the past week, although the overall bond market environment was quiet, bond prices had risen significantly in the recent month or so, so the buying interest in the market was not as strong as before. At the same time, the availability of actual goods made it difficult to sell short. As a result, the supply and demand situation was balanced, and the daily trend was slightly weak, with a stronger decline on Tuesday. The second half of the week was in a state of consolidation, with little change throughout. As a result, compared to the previous week, except for continued increases in spot prices for the 1920 customs, the 1920 issue, and the 1920 opening issue, most other bond futures declined, with the 1920 tobacco issue falling by more than 1 yuan, and the rest only by about five or six jiao. Judging from the bond market situation, it will likely remain stable for the time being and is not expected to experience significant fluctuations. The following is a statistical table of the high, low, and fluctuation of various bond market prices during the past week (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Last Week's Yarn Market Dull and Lifeless</h3>
<p>Fine Yarn Exports Still Strong</p>
<p>Sales of 10-Count Coarse Yarn Very Sluggish</p>
<p>Last week, the cotton yarn market was extremely dull. Large short sellers were reportedly dumping goods daily, causing increasing panic. As for actual sales, seeing the sharp decline in futures prices, even if there was interest, buyers dared not proceed. However, trade in Japanese export yarn continued briskly, with large quantities of Zhonghua brand yarn already shipped out. A significant portion of speculators were also active. However, sales of 10-count coarse yarn were very sluggish. There were approximately 23,000 to 24,000 bales of inventory in the yarn and cloth warehouses. With such a large quantity of goods pressing on the market, it was difficult to boost prices in the short term. Nevertheless, with the overseas yarn market still rising, market sentiment could tighten somewhat. The spot market for 16-count and 20-count yarn was extremely tight, resulting in very firm selling prices. The future situation is difficult to predict. The standard yarn market was flat during the week, with slight increases of two or three qian in each month. There was a slight increase mid-week, but it fell again at the weekend due to the decline in American cotton. Total turnover for the week was 150,350 bales. Various merchants purchased 5,686 bales of spot yarn, while fellow traders took in 2,400 bales. The market for Japanese yarn was very firm. Shenxin Factory opened forward sales of approximately 5,000 to 6,000 bales of Zhonghua brand yarn for shipment to Japan. The following is a breakdown of the number of bales purchased by various merchants:</p>
<p>| Merchant | Bales | Merchant | Bales | Sichuan | 200 | Hong Kong | 160 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Tianjin | 1,145 | Yunnan | 690 | Guangdong | 800 | Nanyang | 120 |</p>
<p>| Qingdao | 295 | North China | 450 | Teng County | 115 | Miscellaneous | 255 |</p>
<p>| Gaoyang | 160 | Northeast China | 100 | Shantou | 205 | Hankou | 360 |</p>
<p>| Changsha | 631 | Fellow Traders | 240 |  |  |  |  |</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Listless Last Week</h3>
<p>Hankou Standard Near-Month Down Seven or Eight Qian</p>
<p>American Cotton Down 100 Points Per Pound</p>
<p>The cotton market has been even calmer since last week, with nothing exciting to report. Although sources of supply were scarce, the current cotton needs of various factories were also quiet, and yarn prices were weak, leading to disappointing sales. As for foreign cotton, the situation was exceptionally pessimistic, causing increasingly weak sentiment. Fortunately, gold prices remained firm, making it difficult to import large quantities of foreign cotton, so the market has not yet shown any weaknesses. However, most people have a bearish outlook on far-month new cotton. Only the Japanese merchant Dongmian Trading Company purchased a large quantity, approximately over 100,000 dan. The intention is to sell foreign cotton and purchase Chinese cotton, which is more cost-effective. However, recently, reports have been received from various local areas that excessive rainfall is causing concern, and if it clears up quickly, the impact will be minor. But if it continues unabated, it may be detrimental to the cotton seedlings. Hankou standard near-month prices fell by seven or eight qian due to a lack of buyers, while far-month prices remained flat. Turnover totaled 267,700 dan. Supplies included 4,570 dan of flower clothing and 90 bales of general-grade cotton. Few factories purchased new cotton. American cotton fell 100 points per pound compared to the previous week. The closing prices for Hankou standard are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>| Supplier | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Turnover | Term |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Shaanxi Flower | 38.625 | ...... | 450 pieces | Spot Delivery to Factory |</p>
<p>| Yao Flower | 38.00 | ...... | 300 bales | Same as above |</p>
<p>| Bailuo District | 43.00 | ...... | 200 pieces | Same as above |</p>
<p>| Trading Company Delivery |  |  |  |  |</p>
<p>| Yao Flower | 37.00 | ...... | 500 bales | Spot Delivery to Warehouse |</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Mixed: Firm and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to poor news from Liverpool and a soft Wall Street, with a lack of buyers. Futures fell eight to eleven points per pound, and spot fell ten points per pound. British cotton futures rose seven to eight points, and spot rose three points. Egyptian cotton spot remained unchanged. Indian cotton initially firmed due to purchases by European exporters but then weakened as long positions were liquidated. Pyarelal and Broach rose one rupee, while Oomra remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (July 11 telegram):</p>

<p>Grain and Rice Markets Tightening Consistently Downriver</p>
<h3>New Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to light rain, the appetite for rice suddenly increased, with more retail shortages and limited fluctuations in large wholesale markets. The price of top-quality thick japonica rice remained at the previous level. Second-grade rice from previous crops rose nearly one foot. Early and late rice remained relatively stable, with high-quality rice slightly lower by half a foot. The outgoing traffic of foreign superior grade rice was slightly scarce, with no gains or losses. Superior grade rice from domestic ports was cleared upon arrival, and the situation slightly improved by several points. Tongbian distilleries still had strong demand, and prices rose by about one foot. Boats arriving from the west included Changshu, Liyang, Jiangyin, Kunshan, Wangting, Jiaoli, Sijing, and Liantang, totaling seventeen or eight boats.</p>
<h3>South Market</h3>
<p>Although supplies from various merchants were thin, retail sales in urban and rural stores were sluggish. This was due to continuous light rain, which weakened sentiment, and prices also eased accordingly. The thick japonica market remained temporarily unchanged. The arrival of thin rice was limited, and appetite remained thin. Street sales seemed expensive and showed signs of weakening, resulting in a shortage of about one foot. The outgoing traffic of foreign superior grade rice was very limited, with a soft appearance. Yin-transformed rice had strong buying interest, and the overall market rose by one or two feet. The production price of foreign rice was unprofitable, and sentiment was upward. Sales were driven by local buyers, and market prices were tightening.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: After Plate-Drawing, Sugar Prices Tend to Firm Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the holiday, there were no reports from the producing areas. Although plate-drawing transactions in the guild market were not high, the market sentiment was exceptionally strong. The transaction price for No. 24 Dutch raw white sugar was 10 taels 0.075 to 0.08 taels. The supply of coarse-grained sugar was even scarcer, and prices were higher, reaching 11 taels. The back market called for 10 taels 0.05 taels, and medium-grade white sugar was 10 taels 0.04 taels. The market situation was strong. Trading in Japanese sugar was active, and the market also rose slightly. N mark was 10 taels 0.075 taels, YT mark was 10 taels 0.07 taels, new goods were 10 taels 0.0725 taels to 0.075 taels, SH mark was 10 taels 0.065 taels, YRO mark was 10 taels 0.055 taels to 0.05875 taels, YP mark was 11 taels 0.075 taels. The market was firm. Nan Shenglong opened a plate for 200 bags of merchant-bowl green sugar, priced at 8.4 yuan, which was reportedly purchased exclusively by a certain merchant.</p>

This is because the quality of the goods is excellent and the prices are reasonable, which is incomparable to those who merely pay lip service. Moreover, this year's lottery prizes have been greatly increased compared to last year, with 50 grand prizes and 5,000 small prizes. Buying one yuan of goods gives the hope of winning a 100 yuan first prize.
