<p>非武力之抵抗。其威權甚武力。其苦痛之加於對方者較無論任何力量爲尤大而非武力抵抗之諸辦法中。更以抵貨一事爲最有力故自印度實行非武力抵抗後、英國商業之受其影響實非淺鮮。今一旦得有撤銷之機會商業可由此活動。英工黨與自由黨及一般商民固表示滿意即其他反對政府之黨。雖問有以讓步過甚責備政府。但鑒於商業之不能不設法維持故亦無猛烈之攻擊。是可見非武力運動效力之大也。</p>
<p>且印人非武力運動之影響。不僅及於英國而己。昨華盛頓電謂商界對於印</p>
<p>督與甘地談判之成功。甚爲欣慰。預料此良好影響及於美商業並信有益於美國與墨西哥之銀礦業。今日紐約電亦謂、市塲銀價較昨日高漲四分之一半因印度局勢現己轉佳之故。又可知印度問題。關係世界商業金融之大與其影響之捷矣、夫以今日商業之不振。銀價之低跌。爲世界各國共感之苦痛原因又甚複雜。印度問題之所得挽回者。固其微之又微然因其機之動。凡與金融商業有關之各方面各問題各種人心之覺悟。皆趨向於圜之一途。事事得順利之解决。則可危可懼之今年。或即轉爲可慶可喜之今年歟</p>

<p>丹靑中有所謂傳神者。蓋以筆墨摹寫人狀貌。而得其精神也。傳神二字。始見於世說。顧長康畫人。或數年不點目睛。人問其故。曰傳神正在阿堵中。世俗傳神。大都矜持呆版。作衣冠端坐之狀。匠氣滿紙。腐惡欲嘔。有名畫家。恥不屑爲。然爲名賢冩照。布園林之景。衣着不加刻畫。飄逸有致者。亦得傳世成品。山隂任頣伯年氏。爲吳昌碩寫像蕉蔭石牀間。昌碩裸裎其體。手揮蒲　。據坐其上。一種閒適之意。盎然溢露於縑輻之中。自屬任氏佳構。昌碩死。其畫集中曾以寫像製珂羅版刋印於其端。去歳。江灣路六三園。開昌碩遺畫展覽會。予固景仰老缶者。且六三園距寓居近。廼往作一度之參觀。任伯年氏所寫之像高張於素壁。筆意蒼秀。與尋常傳神。逈有天壤之别。對之令人想像前輩風流不置。斯畫深印腦幕。己間寒暑。客有稔熟昌碩生平者謂任氏之寫像初非寫昌碩之像也。其像短軀而勝。恰與昌碩相稱。昌碩得之。剜去其頭面、倩人圖己容。而付諸裝池。居然補綴熨貼。一如無縫天衣。諺有所謂改頭换面者。昌碩竟猶獪實行之。客之所述。未知果確否。但事頗趣雋。不妨誌之。爲關心畫苑者一解頣也。</p>

<p>大連日文報載云。大連之女學校。首推彌生高等女學校。該校對於畢業生之出路等問題。一向頗爲注意。最近施行選夫標準之測騐。尤爲轟動一時。本届春季畢業生。計共一百八十七名。該校長爲欲明悉彼等對於將來結婚之希望。印就一種表格。區分資格職業等數欄。發給各畢業生塡注。藉以了解各畢業生對於選擇夫婿之態度。結果。則願夫婿爲公司職員者。居一百一十票。一般有薪給者十票。爲教師者十八票。爲實業家者爲二十五票。爲官吏者祇十三票。其他願夫婿爲軍人者共八票。其中六票。係願夫婿爲從事陸軍者二票。餘則希望從事海軍。希望擇政治家爲夫婿者四票。希望擇藝術家爲夫婿者亦只二票。以醫師爲理想中之夫婿者。計九票。至於希望將來之夫婿從事農業者及自由職業者。各僅一票。綜此一百八十七票中塡明夫婿之教育程度。希望中等學校以上畢業者。約居百分之五十。注明須要大學畢業者。不過二十有二人。最有趣者。即此一百八十七票中。注明對飲酒絶對反對者。居一百五十餘票之多。而對於吸烟問題。則幾乎全部采取寛大之態度。又據該校校長之披露。謂願夫婿爲公司職員者之一百十票中。大半注明以南滿鐵道從事員爲最滿意。蓋因南滿鐵道之從事者。大率能得優厚薪給之故耳。</p>

<p>— 鄒今適</p>
<p>元旦日。余偕戈妹與劉君範猷伉儷。參觀明復圖書館書版展覽。其中宋元明清精槧精鈔本。不下數百種。分類陳列。萃海内藏家秘本於一堂。以供衆覽。非徒一時之快事。亦數千年來未有之盛舉。洵可樂也。外此若殷墟甲骨。齊魯封泥。秦漢銅印。唐人寫經。雷峰藏經。均爲人間希世秘寳。古色古香。盈溢一室。其尤可奇異者。厥爲張天方氏所莊埃及古代甲蟲佩印。實爲見所未見。聞所未聞者。印形皆椭圓。大者如拇指。小僅如瓜仁。背鏤象甲蟲。故以爲名。腹刻文字。中有小孔。蓋爲貫索之處。以爲佩。體色翠綠。驟視之。宛然一甲蟲也。顧余嗜古成癖。一見而奇。奇而狂喜。曰。符壐之用。豈獨吾國歟。惜張氏不在。不得面質。越月餘。往訪老友曹禮吾君於曁大。遂得禮吾之介。謁天方先生。余即以求示古印爲請。時值先生家居養疴。即慨然而起。出印以示。殷殷垂教。印計四十五鈕。（有兩印無字）其質或石或匋。古色爛斑。殆數千年前物。爲先生留法時所得。每即之值。約四五元。非特中土未之前有。即外國藏家亦所罕觀。殊爲珍秘。考其文字率皆吉語或神道。蓋用佩於胸前。可以祓除不祥之意。字體奇古精妙。自有别緻。有數字一印。或一字一印。章法匀宜。細巧入微。有日月山川之象。有如裸女而起舞。或趺坐而鼓琴。有如執轡而立。或携杖而行。埃人造字之源。於此可見。余摩挲良久。愛不忍釋。乃手爲鈐拓。以印過小。摘印爲難。盡半日始成四十三紙。而指痛己不堪矣。印畢。稍事休息。張氏復出示所藏埃及瓷石古器數十事。無不精美可喜。張氏工詩文。又邃於考古。故所聚多而且精。所作考古學一卷。及南邨一集見貽。乃興辭而别。歸而援筆記其顚末。以告海内好古君子。</p>

<p>余前「志手搦之肖象」一則刋出後。承朋好見告。謂嘉邑猶有前輩顧志偉顧劍舟兩先生之遺象、亦係一時所塐。至今完好如初。而余未之獲睹。殊爲遺憾。</p>
<p>越昨葛君劍潭又謂現在搦象之名手。尚有其人。渠友某君在滬。曾搦伉儷二象。時在前年春仲。其塐者則倩自蘇之光福鄉。而其名己佚。但憶姓鄭。且不易得其許可。必輾轉間接促其駕。始得惠臨一試其技。至則又未可僅以藝人待之。必誠必虔。有若上賓。而其工作。與人對坐。輙在几下爲之。故人始終不知其如何。其象之成。歷時非至月餘不可。面貎未竣。固不許出示。衣摺具矣。而履鳥未完。則仍秘不稍露、迨見。則栩栩欲動。無論知與不知。皆能識其人而指其名也。其技之神。有如是者。并云代價亦甚鉅。每搦一象。須近百圓。而供飲憇息之所需。猶不計焉、</p>
<p>據上所述。與余前志之事實略同。而時間相違。殆别有其人。而同具斯詣者。唯同爲蘇人。雖皆不知其名。吾謂必有識其。人者。或者其一派之嫡傳。爲其後裔。故能後先輝映於世。余雅好藝事。此尤品之絶作者。不得不一再述之。亦欲冀世之博聞者。有以廣之焉。</p>

<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>去冬嚴寒。爲南中三十年來所未有。不佞偕内子輔吉　　適作鄉行。客裏無伴。僅携心愛之細種金魚三十尾與俱。奈鄉間苦寒。加之雨雪頻仍。氣候究較城市爲冷。雖置之内室。日更井水一次。使其體温不凍僵。無如有翻腮及朝天龍八尾。同時身側不良於游行。視其呼吸亦甚促。少頃。氣反緩而神漸停。四尾竟浮水面死。余頗不忍。然己返魂無香。聽之而己。忽輔吉謂余曰。死馬權作活馬醫。曷不移入温水中。看能甦醒否。余姑如言試之。須臾。居然有生氣。余大樂。復注水入釜中。魚亦遷入。比炭熾。水漸熱。魚亦漸動。視兩腮呼吸亦漸勤。俄竟游動如生。毫無濡滯。指試則水將沸矣。亟易井水。迄今安然無恙。輔吉笑曰。君發明此煑魚重生法。曷不書寄鵑公。余笑應之。筆之爲愛魚者告。</p>

<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>自羅馬車站開車後約一小時。己到意大利海岸。在車窗遠遠眺望海平綫。只見迷霧間露出了一條白光。四月間意大利天氣。爲年一中最好的時期。天空略帶雲霧。幾隻白鷗在海面覓食。晨間的凉爽。沁人肺腑。這一種暮春柔和的感覺。使旅者精神愉快。一路經海峽無數。人工的點綴。都含美的情調。雖比不上瑞士的優秀。可是也夠得我們贊賞了。午後二時。車停於意大利中部的比閘。pise此問有座斜塔。爲詩人畫家盤桓而不忍去的所在。尤其在美術史上。是極著名的。</p>
<p>在中部意大利。現在我們所看得見的那座卡答鐸拉cathedoral寺院。是建於一零六三年至一零九二年問。大體取basilica式樣。又加上幾分byyantium式的要素。其華麗與雄奇的特色。可稱romanesque建築初期的形式。後來仿照此種式樣的教堂。歐洲各地都能看得到。</p>
<p>在比閘參觀卡答鐸拉教堂。足以使我們滿意。但是還有兩個著名世界的建築物。就是斜塔與洗禮堂。斜塔campanite因歪形。所以沿用其名。一說是建築工事中地盤沉下。故成斜形。還有一說。建此塔時。故意傾斜的。這是一千一百十七年間的建築。全體爲七層洞形。頂上有圓塔。斜度計三十三呎。古色斑爛。其雄偉無與倫比。洗禮堂的雄偉。雖不及斜塔。但其美觀。則勝於斜塔及卡答鐸拉教堂。建於一一五三年。圓形平面。直徑一百二十九呎。純用大理石造成。觀其全體。有簡素的特色。</p>
<p>在比閘遊覽四小時。再乘車前行。同車廂來了一位法國教徒。在羅馬教皇宫充職。人極和藹。教徒講斜塔的故事給我們聽。雖含宗教的意義。却於美術上有密切的關係。歐洲各國。對歷史上的古物。保守得極爲完備。塔雖斜了八百多年。可是没有斜坍。因爲常常有人保管。疊經修理。古意尚存。</p>

<p>Song Ziwen Presents Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee held a meeting at the National Government building at 10:00 AM on the 6th. Chairman Wang Chonghui, committee members Wang Zhengting, Wang Boqun, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, and Kong Xiangxi attended. Chairman Wang Chonghui presided over the discussions: (1) Song Ziwen presented a report outlining the progress of consolidating internal and external debt in the 18th year, and a proposal for determining consolidation methods. It was resolved to submit the report to the government for review and publication. (2) It was decided to continue the meeting at the National Government building on the 13th. According to a committee member, the internal debt group has not yet been fully established, and the investigation of the external debt group has not been fully submitted. Therefore, the current progress is still focused on reviewing matters. The qualifications for appointing committee members have been determined as: 1. Those related to their official duties; 2. Experts; 3. Representatives from the banking sector. Over thirty people have been appointed and will attend the general assembly. It was also stated that the consolidation of internal and external debt will be conducted on an equal basis, without discrimination. (6th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Hu's Condition Improved Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Sun Ke and Others Plan to Bring Hu into the City for Recuperation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Jitao stated that Hu Hanmin felt unwell after arriving at Tangshan. On the 2nd, Hu's daughter, Mulan, went to visit him with a maid. On the 3rd, Deng Zhende, a medical officer from the Ministry of Railways, was invited to provide medical care. Deng went to Tangshan that evening. On the 4th, Deng returned to Nanjing to obtain medication, stating that Hu was suffering from posterior neuralgia, combined with hemorrhoids and gastrointestinal discomfort. On the morning of the 5th, Deng called, saying that Hu had been dizzy the previous night and had a slightly elevated temperature. In the afternoon, Sun Ke and I went to offer our condolences. Chiang Kai-shek sent Liu Ruiheng to examine him. It was found that Hu's temperature and pulse were normal, but his blood pressure was quite high and he needed complete rest and easily digestible nourishment. On the morning of the 6th, Deng returned to Nanjing, saying that he had slept well the previous night and felt better than the previous two days. He ate beef broth and wheat flour and his condition was good. Liu Ruiheng also said that Hu's condition had been improving since the afternoon of the 5th, with a temperature of 99 and a pulse of 80 gradually returning to normal. However, he had slight pain in his head and stomach. His blood pressure was measured at 200, which was likely caused by overwork. A urine test is currently being conducted, but there are no other significant symptoms. He went to examine him again on the morning of the 6th and found nothing unusual, but his blood pressure was too high and he needed long-term rest. (6th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, and others believe that it is inconvenient to examine Hu Hanmin, who is ill in Tangshan. Sun's private residence behind the Ministry of Railways has fresh air, and they plan to bring Hu into the city for recuperation there. (6th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Non-violent resistance. Its authority is greater than military force. Its suffering inflicted on the other party is greater than any force. Among the methods of non-violent resistance, the boycott is the most powerful. Since India implemented non-violent resistance, the impact on British commerce has been profound. Now that there is an opportunity to repeal it, commerce can be activated. The British Labour Party, the Liberal Party, and the general merchants have expressed satisfaction. Even other parties opposing the government have criticized the government for making excessive concessions. However, in view of the need to maintain commerce, there is no fierce attack. This shows the great effectiveness of the non-violent movement.</p>
<p>Moreover, the impact of the Indian non-violent movement is not only on Britain. Yesterday, the Washington telegram said that the business community was very pleased with the success of the negotiations between the Governor-General of India and Gandhi. It is expected that this good impact will affect American commerce and that it will benefit the American and Mexican silver mining industries. Today, the New York telegram also said that the market silver price has risen by one-quarter and a half compared to yesterday due to the improved situation in India. It is also known that the Indian problem is related to the world's commerce and finance and its impact is swift. The current stagnation of commerce and the decline in silver prices are a common suffering for all countries in the world, and the reasons are complex. What the Indian problem has recovered is very small, but because of the movement of its machine, all aspects, problems, and awakenings of people's hearts related to finance and commerce are moving towards a perfect path. If everything can be solved smoothly, this dangerous and frightening year may turn into a happy and joyful year.</p>

The authority to make loans rests with the National Government and the relevant department. As the President of the Legislative Yuan, Hu cannot represent the government. The atmosphere for silver loans in the United States has now subsided. I have never been a loan broker. I am here to travel. (6th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e57">Text of Agreement Between Viceroy and Gandhi Published <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Non-Violent Resistance Effectively Terminated</p>
<p>Boycott No Longer a Political Tool</p>
<p>New York Silver Market Trends Upward</p>
<p>▲Reuter's dispatch from New Delhi on the 5th. The original text of the agreement between the Viceroy and Gandhi is now officially published in a form of government announcement. In addition to the terms already announced, this announcement also states that, in accordance with the British Prime Minister's permission on January 9th, efforts will be made to enable representatives of the All-India Congress to participate in future discussions on constitutional improvement plans, as planned by the Round Table Conference. It is also stated that the boycott of foreign goods, mostly aimed at British goods to exert pressure for political purposes, has been agreed that the termination of non-violent resistance includes the effective termination of the boycott of British goods, which will no longer be used as a political tool. As for methods of promoting Indian goods in place of non-Indian goods, or methods of suppressing the sale of strong liquor and drugs, except those that do not go beyond the scope permitted by ordinary laws, the use of pickets is not allowed, and if pickets form any infringement anywhere, they must be stopped. Gandhi had advocated a public investigation into the actions of the police during the disturbances, but Gandhi, knowing that this matter has various difficulties or may hinder the restoration of peace, agreed not to insist. Property that has been confiscated will be returned, except to original owners who stubbornly refuse to pay land tax and other taxes. However, if real estate has been sold to third parties, as far as the government is concerned, this transaction cannot be changed, but anyone can seek legal relief. If positions vacated due to self-resignation have been filled, the government will not be able to restore the former person to their original position. However, local governments should consider other resignation cases with a spirit of leniency. Finally, it states that if the All-India Congress cannot fulfill the obligations of this agreement, the government may take any necessary measures to protect the public and maintain law and order.</p>
<p>▲Reuter's dispatch from London on the 5th. The Secretary of State for India, Benn, read out the announcement issued in New Delhi in the House of Commons today, and explained that the effective termination of non-violent resistance means the effective termination of all activities aimed at promoting resistance by various methods, such as resisting land laws, refusing to pay taxes, publishing newspapers to promote the resistance movement, civil and military officials opposing the government, or abandoning their duties.</p>
<p>▲Reuter's dispatch from London on the 6th. The outcome of the talks between the Viceroy and Gandhi is very satisfactory to officials. Although the Conservative Party is not as happy as the Labour and Liberal Parties, most of them have no objection to the agreed-upon measures. Although a few newspapers feel that this agreement is difficult to tolerate, most commentaries are phrased reasonably. The general public's attention is focused on the revocation of the boycott and the impact it will have on British commerce as a result.</p>
<p>▲Associated Press dispatch from New York on the 5th. Silver prices rose in the market today, partly because the situation in India has now taken a turn for the better. Silver closed at 27 and 7/8, a quarter higher than yesterday's closing price.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Jiang Guangnai Goes to Jiangxi to Supervise the Army <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Jiang Guangnai, the Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, recently received repeated telegrams from generals at the front urging him to enter Jiangxi to preside over the supervision of the army and suppress the bandits. At that time, Jiang had not departed because the bandit suppression matters were still awaiting consultation with Chen Jitang upon his return to the province. However, after receiving the date of Chen Jitang's return south, he decided to depart for Jiangxi on March 1st. It was learned that Chen Jitang returned to Guangzhou on the 28th of last month. After Jiang discussed and agreed with Chen on that day, he immediately ordered his subordinates that evening to pack their luggage and ordered the recovering officers and soldiers to prepare. He also asked the Provincial Government to send a letter to Liu Juke, the Director of the Guangshao Railway Bureau, to prepare one parlor car, six third-class cars, and eight baggage cars for use. This morning at 6:00 AM, the Guangshao Railway Bureau had the cars hooked up as requested and waiting at Huangsha Station. Around 7:00 AM, about a thousand recovered soldiers of the unit lined up at the station and boarded the train. The army equipment and luggage were transported by truck and loaded into the baggage cars. It was not completed until 9:20 AM. At 9:50 AM, Jiang, accompanied by his wife and daughter, arrived at the station by car. At this time, the military music played in unison. Jiang and his wife got out of the car, walked onto the platform, and shook hands with the well-wishers. They then went to the stationmaster's office to rest and wait for the train. I paid a visit and had the following conversation with Jiang: (Q) Are you now going to Northern Guangdong, Commander-in-Chief? (A) Yes. (Q) Can you tell me about your itinerary? (A) I will first go to Shaoguan, then take the land route, passing through Nanxiong and Dayu, and go directly to Ganzhou. (Q) How many days do you expect to arrive in Ganzhou? (A) Because there are other matters along the way, the date cannot be determined. (Q) After arriving in Ganzhou, will you go to Xingguo to meet Commander Cai? (A) I will decide when I arrive. (Q) Will you go to Nanchang to meet Director He Yingqin? (A) Not yet decided. (Q) Where are the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province now? (A) The bandit whereabouts are elusive and unpredictable, but they are roughly still in Yudu and other places. (Q) After you arrive in Jiangxi, can you tell me about your bandit suppression measures? (A) I will first concentrate the various units and then launch a general offensive against the bandits. As for the plan, I need to ask Director He for instructions. (Q) In your opinion, how long will it take to eliminate the bandits? (A) Because the bandits are desperately resisting, the time to eliminate them is difficult to fix. However, we will actively plan the encirclement and suppression and hope to accomplish it in the shortest possible time to reassure the people. (Q) Where is Commander Cai now? (A) Still presiding over the Xingguo Command Headquarters. (Q) How many troops are departing with you this morning? (A) About two battalions of recovered soldiers. (Q) How many staff members are traveling with you? (A) About ten staff members, including Staff Officer Wu Dian. (Q) Is Brigade Commander Huang Yanzhen returning to Shaoguan on the same train? (A) Brigade Commander Huang's mission is complete, so he arranged to return to Shaoguan on the train this morning. The conversation ended here. Li Yangjing, Huang Yanzhen, and others were talking to Jiang about important matters, so I excused myself. At 10:20 AM, the special train had arrived at Xicun from Huangsha Station. Jiang, accompanied by Huang Yanzhen, staff members, and guards, boarded the train. At 10:30 AM, the whistle sounded three times, and the train set off. The well-wishers also departed by car.

<p>Nanchang correspondence: Zhang Huizan, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi Province, was martyred in Futian, Ji'an, on January 28th. His head was retrieved from the Ji River, transported to the provincial capital, and placed in a coffin. The Central Government, recognizing the tragic nature of his death, granted him preferential treatment as an Army General and approved a state funeral. The Jiangxi government allocated 10,000 yuan for funeral expenses and held a public memorial service for three days starting on the 1st of this month, which has now been completed. The coffin will be transported back to Hunan today (the 4th) for a state funeral. At around 8:00 AM, those attending the funeral gathered at the funeral home for a memorial service. Then, a seventeen-gun salute was fired to start the procession. The coffin was covered with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and National Emblem flag and carried by thirty-six pallbearers. The procession was very grand, with a military band, memorial banners, and over a thousand wreaths. There were about a hundred wreaths presented by Chairman Chiang, various Central Committee members, Minister He, and Chairman Lu, all of which were extremely beautiful.

<h3 id="e74">Bandit Alarms on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>▲Northbound Trains Currently Stop at Guangshui</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence: On the 2nd of this month, over ten thousand bandits were discovered in Lijiazhai, north of Guangshui. Liulin Station was even occupied. After the vigorous suppression by Yuan Ying's unit of the New 12th Division, fierce fighting continued for two days without completely annihilating them. The Pinghan northbound express train was thus forced to return to Hankou. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Liulin Invaded by Bandits: The New 12th Division, originally stationed in the Xinyang-Minggang area, was responsible for guarding the railway. On this day, upon hearing reports of bandits in the area, Brigade Commander Hou Zhenhua led a company of soldiers to Lijiazhai to suppress them. After several hours of fierce fighting, they were surrounded by the bandits due to their overwhelming numbers. The division dispatched another team, and after fighting fiercely all night, the bandit forces did not weaken, so they temporarily retreated to the vicinity of Minggang. Liulin was thus occupied by the bandits. On the 4th, Division Commander Yuan dispatched another battalion, along with a special service battalion, to counterattack the bandits in Liulin. The bandit forces were unable to withstand the attack and began to flee south. The division's office in Hankou has recently received two telegrams from the division's staff department, reporting the battle situation in detail, which are recorded as follows: (Telegram 1) (1) I have just received a telegram from Liu Jiang, the Director of the Bianxing Military Headquarters, stating that the communist bandits are attempting to seize Xinyang and ordering our division and the 6th Division to make proper arrangements and maintain strict defense. (2) I have received a telegram from He Yao, the Director of the Hanxing Military Headquarters, ordering our division to be responsible for suppressing the communist bandits who have infiltrated Lijiazhai. (3) I have dispatched a brigade, a regiment, Li Battalion, and special service engineers to contain Dongshuanghe and suppress the bandits step by step. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting. (4) I have flown the Second Regiment stationed in Minggang today to increase the pain and suppression at the front line, in order to restore traffic as soon as possible. Respectfully reported. (Telegram 2) I have just received a report from Battalion Commander Li Fengwu stating that I was ordered yesterday afternoon to lead my unit from Minggang to provide assistance. I arrived at Dongshuanghe that evening and, at 1:00 AM this morning, led the team in cooperation with the special service battalion to counterattack the Liulin line. After two hours of fierce fighting, the bandit forces were unable to withstand the attack and fled south. The Liulin station was immediately recovered. I immediately tracked and pursued them along the railway line. The bandits continued to resist stubbornly. I encouraged the soldiers to advance bravely, and at 3:00 AM, we reoccupied Fuzishan and other places south of Liulin Station. In addition to reporting by telegram, respectfully reported.</p>
<p>▲Pinghan Traffic Blocked On the afternoon of the 2nd, the special express train from Hankou to Pingjiang was traveling to Guangshui, and as it was nighttime, it was reported that over ten thousand bandits were harassing Lijiazhai, Xindian, and other places, making it impossible to proceed. The train waited at Guangshui for three or four hours, but still did not receive a telegram from Xindian Station to the north. For the safety of passengers, the train returned to Hankou and arrived at Dazhimen Station at 2:00 PM on the 3rd. According to the investigation of the railway bureau, when the bandits arrived, two locomotives at Xindian Station were destroyed by the bandits, and all equipment inside the station was also destroyed. Over forty telegraph poles were broken along the Guangshui-Liulin section of the route, and many rails were destroyed, resulting in losses of approximately 10,000 yuan. Currently, northbound trains on the Pinghan Railway are temporarily stopping at Guangshui as the terminal. (March 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Hunan Provincial Bank to Issue Paper Money <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>▲Decision to Issue Auxiliary Currency Notes Worth 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Hunan Provincial Bank, established when Lu Diping was the chairman of the provincial government, was allocated 1 million yuan from the provincial treasury as its foundation and had not issued paper money. After He Jian succeeded him, due to the thriving unified tax revenue, another 500,000 yuan was allocated, bringing the bank's total capital to 1.5 million yuan. For the past two years, the bank's business has been quite profitable. However, since Zhang Gui's army captured Changsha last June, the Fourth Route Army, in urgent need of military funds, withdrew 600,000 yuan from the provincial bank's foundation, which has not yet been returned. Furthermore, the communist Peng Dehuai also invaded Changsha on July 27th, and He Jian withdrew all the bank's deposits as military expenses. It is estimated that four-fifths of the bank's capital of 1.5 million yuan was withdrawn by the government, while the remaining one-fifth, because it was deposited with merchants and not yet due, was preserved. After Changsha was recovered last August, the bank did not officially resume operations. For the past half year, it has only been receiving money and not lending it out. Up to now, about 300,000 yuan of the deposits with merchants have been gradually recovered. As for the foundation withdrawn by the government, due to financial difficulties, not a single cent has been returned. Currently, the bank's actual capital is less than 500,000 yuan. Recently, in order to invigorate the market and regulate finance, He Jian decided to issue paper money in the name of the bank. Because the central government restricts provincial banks from issuing banknotes of more than one yuan, it was decided to issue auxiliary currency notes, in denominations of 10 cents, 20 cents, and 50 cents, printed at the Changsha Xiang'e Printing Bureau. The total amount is provisionally set at 500,000 yuan, to be issued in two phases. The first issuance will be 200,000 yuan, fully backed by cash reserves. After establishing credibility, another 300,000 yuan will be issued, secured by guarantee reserves. All the banknotes have been printed and are scheduled to begin circulation on March 10th. The issuance regulations and reserve inspection regulations have been announced. Currently, there are four types of auxiliary currency notes in circulation in the Hunan market: (1) Auxiliary currency notes of the Shanghai Bank of China, (2) Auxiliary currency notes of the Hubei Provincial Bank, (3) Auxiliary currency notes of 10, 20, and 30 cents issued by the Hunan Electric Light Company, and (4) Auxiliary currency notes of 10, 20, and 50 cents issued by the Hunan Hefeng Match Company. The first two types are not numerous, while the latter two types flood the entire province, amounting to about 400,000 yuan. It is reported that the provincial government has decided to order the recall of the auxiliary currency notes issued by the two companies after the Hunan Provincial Bank's auxiliary currency notes are issued, in order to avoid affecting the market.

<h3 id="e76">The "Tianjin" Plane Detained in Jinan <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲Right Wing Oil Pipe Leaking</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The China National Aviation Corporation is conducting trial flights between Shanghai and Peiping (Beijing). Nie Kaiyi, supervisor and deputy director of the aviation group of the company, and four others, flew from Xuzhou to Jinan on the "Tianjin" plane on the 2nd. Last night, Zhang Qifang, acting mayor of Tianjin, sent a telegram stating that the Tianjin airport was suitable for landing. Therefore, the "Tianjin" plane decided to fly to Tianjin. Today (the 4th) at 9:30 a.m., it took off from Zhangzhuang Airport and circled over the city for a week before flying north along the Jinpu Railway. Unexpectedly, at 9:50 a.m., it flew back to Zhangzhuang and landed. I happened to be there and visited Nie Kaiyi. According to him, after taking off this morning, the plane climbed to 2,000 feet over the city. The sky was extremely clear. However, after flying over the Yellow River, the air was filled with thick fog, so they descended to 800 feet and continued to fly north, with a slight reduction in speed. When they reached Sangzidian, they suddenly noticed a white ice-like substance on the right wing. When departing from Shanghai, oil leakage had been discovered in the right wing oil pipe, but it did not hinder the flight. However, they dared not take risks at this point, so they flew back to check. It has now been verified that one of the right wing oil pipes has a significant leak. The other two on the left wing are barely passable. However, repairs are necessary before flying. The most difficult thing at the moment is that repairs may not be possible in Jinan. Nie asked me if I knew anyone at the Dahuaishu Railway Factory and asked me to introduce him. I told him about Qin Wenfan, the deputy director of the railway factory. Nie then sent a mechanic, Yu Yongquan (mistakenly reported as Yu Feiquan yesterday), with me to meet Deputy Director Qin. However, there was still no solution, because the oil pipe is made of steel (i.e., aluminum) and requires oxygen welding (i.e., chlorine gas welding). The railway factory only has electric welding, which is useless. Later, Deputy Director Qin introduced the Lu Da Iron Factory, which has oxygen welding, but after inquiring by telephone, it was found that it was broken and could not be used. At this point, repairs were completely hopeless. Nie then telegraphed Tianjin to report the situation and telegraphed Shanghai to request that someone be sent to Jinan with welding equipment for repairs. It is expected that the person sent by the airline will not arrive in Jinan by train until the evening of the 6th. If the repairs are successful, the plane will not be able to fly out until the afternoon of the 7th. This afternoon, Nie, along with the pilot and mechanic, conducted a test flight at Zhangzhuang Airport, plugging the cracked pipes on the right and left wings, leaving only the remaining two pipes to supply oil. After a 15-minute test flight, they landed again. According to Nie, the test flight results were good, but it takes one and a half hours to fly from Jinan to Tianjin. It is still uncertain whether the two pipes can supply enough oil. Another test flight will be conducted tomorrow morning. If they are confident, they will fly to Tianjin. Otherwise, they will have to wait until after the repairs, he said. (March 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Bengbu Merchants and Residents Strike to Protest Rice Levies <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Guards at the Huaiyuan Sailboat Rice Inspection Sub-Bureau shot and wounded boatmen who were petitioning, inciting merchants, industrialists, navigators, and residents here to march in demonstration and petition the authorities, pleading for assistance. Wei Lihuang, commander of the Anhui North Garrison, according to the request of the masses, has already telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting instructions on how to handle the matter. Although the Huaiyuan and Bengbu Rice Inspection Sub-Bureaus have faced fierce opposition from the people, they continue to detain rice boats and forcibly collect levies. To express their firm opposition, merchants and residents here unanimously went on strike, ceasing business operations from 9:00 a.m. on the 4th, in order to awaken the authorities. That afternoon, dozens of navigators found Cao Bingxiong and Hang Zhaofeng, two officials from the Bengbu Rice Inspection Sub-Bureau, at the Da Dong Hotel and handed them over to the joint military-police inspection office for custody. Zhang Xin, the newly appointed director of the Rice Inspection Sub-Bureau, and all other personnel have fled without a trace. No one is inspecting rice boats or collecting levies at the riverbank. The Bengbu General Chamber of Commerce believes that the town-wide strike has greatly affected commerce. This afternoon at 3:00 p.m., it specially convened a meeting of representatives from the 38 trade guilds at the Salt and Grain Guild to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to organize an Anhui North People's Petition Delegation to oppose illegal rice levies, and Liu Huaxuan, Dong Jingsheng, Xiao Dafu, and others were elected as representatives, scheduled to go to Beijing within days to petition the central government. They will not stop until the goal of abolishing the levies is achieved. The General Chamber of Commerce and the 38 trade guilds sent a telegram to the central government today, requesting that it be stopped. The Bengbu Transport Guild and others also sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting that he send a senior official nearby to order the abolition of all rice levies along the Huai River to appease public anger. The original telegram from the Chamber of Commerce and the 38 trade guilds to the central government is recorded below: "To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, President Chiang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister of Finance Song Jun: The case of the Huaiyuan Rice Inspection Sub-Bureau shooting and wounding merchants and residents has already been reported to Your Excellencies in two telegrams. However, the sub-bureau disregards the law and ignores public opinion, still intercepting merchant ships and forcibly collecting levies. Merchants and residents throughout the city are on the verge of losing their livelihoods, and the situation is perilous. Therefore, starting at 9:00 a.m. today, they have all closed their shops and are quietly awaiting a resolution. However, the Rice Inspection Sub-Bureau dares to defy the central government's clear orders and oppress merchants and residents, inciting public anger and causing a city-wide strike. If the delay continues for too long, the consequences will be too terrible to contemplate. Therefore, we telegrahically inform Your Excellencies, requesting that you quickly send a special commissioner or telegraph to the military commander stationed there to forcibly abolish the rice levies along the Changhuai area, in order to comply with the law and maintain the people's food supply. We await your urgent orders, the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce and the 38 Trade Guilds respectfully kowtow with seals." (March 4th)</p>

<p>▲He Chengjun and He Qiyang Swear Them In</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Fang Dazhi, Director of the Construction Department of the Hubei Provincial Government, and Committee Member Chen Guangzu, held an oath-taking ceremony at 10:00 a.m. on the 2nd. He Chengjun, swearing-in committee member from the central government and the Executive Yuan, He Qiyang, swearing-in committee member from the National Government, Wu Xingya, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Zhang Guanshi, Director of the Finance Department, Huang Jianzhong, Director of the Education Department, Liu Wendao, Mayor of Hankou, and others were present. Presided over by He Chengjun, after the ceremony, Fang and Chen read the oath. Then, He Chengjun, the central government's swearing-in committee member, delivered an address, saying: "Today, Director Fang and Committee Member Chen are holding their inauguration ceremony at the same time. I and my brother were ordered by the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan to administer the oath. Everyone knows the abilities and knowledge of both comrades Fang and Chen. I hope that from now on, they will follow the oath and do things practically. The oath includes several points: loyalty, integrity, and diligence. The 'loyalty' of loyalty is the loyalty of the Three Principles of the People, which is very meaningful. If loyalty is achieved, the other seven will not be difficult to achieve. Government officials who want to be loyal and work hard at their posts must think of ways to eliminate the bandits who have not yet been wiped out, eliminate corruption, and complete the unfinished construction work. Furthermore, for the people's problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, if there are any that have not been resolved, one must think of ways to resolve them. If this can be done, one will naturally be diligent and honest, and one will not violate the teachings of the late leader. All political works can be carried out smoothly. Politics is not about saying much, but about doing it. In the future, I hope that both comrades Fang and Chen will follow the oath and work hard." Next, He Qiyang, the swearing-in committee member of the National Government, delivered an address, saying: "Committee Member Chen has participated in the Northern Expedition several times and has recently assisted Chairman He in defeating Tang Shengzhi, Feng Yuxiang and other rebels, and his achievements are well known. Director Fang has served as the director of the Railway Bureau and has both knowledge and experience. In the past, the province's politics did not have any achievements because the provincial government's organization was not sound. There has not been much establishment in construction. Now that the provincial government is sound and Director Fang is fully responsible for construction, I believe that Comrades Fang and Chen will have good performance after taking office." Then, Committee Member Chen Guangzu delivered a reply, saying: "I have been studying in the military, and politics is not my strong point. Now that I have been appointed by the National Government, I will follow all the laws and regulations of the central government and the provincial government, and I will follow Chairman He and the other committee members and work hard." Director Fang's reply said, "I have limited knowledge, and I am deeply worried that I will fail. From now on, I will follow Chairman He and the other committee members and work harder, and I ask all of you present to give me advice at any time." After the ceremony, music was played, photos were taken, and the meeting was dismissed. After the meeting was dismissed, Chairman He immediately telegraphed the Central Executive Yuan to report the swearing-in process. (March 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Fuzhou Merchants Refuse to Pay Business Tax <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲Also Telegraph the Yuan and Departments to Request Tax Rate Reduction</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Minhou Business Tax Bureau is negotiating with various merchant guilds on the matter of agreeing to pay taxes. Most merchant guilds believe that the tax rate set by the Finance Department is too high and does not suit the business conditions. Moreover, the original draft of the tax rules has not been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval by the Central Political Conference, so it is considered to be illegal. Therefore, Zheng Shou, the representative of the hardware guild, proposed opposition and refused to agree to pay the tax, saying that it must be approved after the guilds have convened a meeting to discuss and revise the tax rules. The implementation of the Fuzhou business tax has therefore fallen into a standstill. However, after Fujian Province abolished through-taxes, it relied on business tax as compensation. Now that the tax cannot be levied, the Finance Department's revenue is extremely strained. The expenses of the various institutions in the provincial capital for February have not yet been settled. Therefore, Director He Gonggan asked the provincial government for instructions on how to proceed. The provincial government stated that the province's business tax was ordered to be implemented by the Executive Yuan, and the collection regulations and implementation rules were formulated in detail according to the guidelines and supplementary measures issued by the Yuan. Since it has been promulgated, it must be implemented. Fujian is the first province to abolish through-taxes, and merchants should share the difficulties and take into account the overall situation. Fuzhou is the provincial capital, and if each guild can resist payment, merchants in other places will surely follow suit, which will greatly affect the financial future. Therefore, it ordered the Finance Department to levy the tax on schedule, no matter what. If anyone dares to advocate resistance, they should be investigated, reported, and dealt with accordingly. After receiving the order, the Finance Department sent a letter to the General Chamber of Commerce, asking it to convene the merchant guilds, earnestly persuade them, and report and pay the taxes on the specified date, without disobedience. Upon hearing this, the guilds also convened a joint meeting at the Commercial Research Institute at 3:00 p.m. on the 2nd to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to first telegraph the administrative and financial departments to request the provincial government and finance department to postpone the levy and to send representatives to Beijing with the business tax regulations promulgated by the provincial government to petition the administrative, legislative, finance, and industrial departments to reduce the tax rate. Currently, the attitudes of officials and merchants are becoming extreme and it will only be resolved by the Yuan and departments. (March 3rd)</p>

After getting off the train, Wang stayed at the 12th Division headquarters and discussed everything with Division Commander Jin. On the morning of the 28th, he summoned the officers of the 12th Division to the division headquarters to give a speech, generally encouraging them to step up training, prepare for review, and maintain local security. On the morning of March 2nd, Wang attended the 12th Division's Commemoration Week and gave a speech. That day was also the date of the inauguration of Zhou Tiren, the newly appointed commander of the 35th Brigade, and Wang supervised his inauguration. At 10:00 a.m. on the 3rd, Wang returned west from Xinpu with Division Commander Jin. He originally intended to give a speech to the 69th Regiment in Guanhuzhen along the way, but it did not happen due to light rain. He arrived in Xuzhou at 9:00 p.m. that night. According to Wang, the defense along the way was very solid during this inspection and review.

<p>Business Tax Bureau Established: After the National Government Self-Abolished Li Taxes, it immediately formulated various regulations on the collection of business taxes and implemented them in various provinces. The reporting procedures for the merchants in this county have been mostly completed. The Department of Finance appointed Zhang Yin from Zhejiang Province as the director of the Business Tax Sub-Bureau of this county. He arrived in Songjiang yesterday and rented a house owned by the Liao family to set up the bureau office. It is heard that the date of tax collection will depend on the arrival of the rural inspection supervisor in Songjiang. Chen Qingyu, the inspection supervisor of the Rural Clearing General Bureau, was sent to inspect the handling of rural clearing work in various counties. Chen arrived in Songjiang on the 6th, visited County Magistrate Jin to inquire about everything, but it is heard that the household registration survey for this rural clearing is complicated, and the areas with more population are unable to complete it as scheduled, so Supervisor Chen first started with the areas that have been completed and conducted spot checks.</p>
<p>Reviewing the Design of the Memorial Monument: Since the demolition of the Yuecheng in the West Gate, the base has been spacious and the location is suitable. The County Party Department previously decided to designate it as the site for the construction of the memorial monument to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, but there are several public lands in the middle that were bought by warlords and private individuals in the past. The county government decided to take them back for public use in accordance with the Land Requisition Law, but it is heard that the landowners are still disputing the matter, and the Civil Affairs Department is deciding on the matter, so the memorial monument that the people have been yearning for has not yet been built. However, the design drawings and budget have been completed by the Construction Bureau. Today (the 6th), the county government convened various agencies such as the Education Bureau to review it, and they all passed the proposal. Now it is only waiting for the decision of the provincial department.</p>

Now, Zhang Xinjian, a member of the county standing committee, believes that the town of Zhaolin, which is connected to Songjiang and Fengxian, also needs to be merged into this county in fact. Not only is the terrain important, but the area connects to the coast and is the key to entry and exit. Since Songjiang is remote in the west, it is difficult to manage, and this county is also limited by its borders and cannot intervene. It seems that the unification of jurisdiction is necessary to achieve results. He has already reported the above reasons to the province through the county for joint review.</p>

<p>Cerebral Meningitis Is Rampant in Urban and Rural Areas: Since entering the spring, the weather has been abnormal, with continuous rain and cloudy skies. Therefore, cerebral meningitis is very rampant in urban and rural areas, and it is spreading rapidly. The disease is quite severe, and if treatment is delayed, it will be fatal.</p>
<p>The Director of the Construction Bureau Was Replaced Yesterday: Yao Dixing, the Director of the Wuxi County Construction Bureau, was ordered to be exchanged with Mao Feng, the Director of the Jiangyin Construction Bureau. County Magistrate Pan believed that Director Yao had made remarkable achievements in local construction, so he telegraphed the Construction Department to retain him and postpone the transfer. Yesterday, Sun, the Director of the Construction Department, replied that the matter had been decided by the provincial committee and could not be changed. Director Mao has already arrived in Wuxi from Chengjiang (Jiangyin) with his entourage. He made contact with Director Yao yesterday and is scheduled to take over the affairs this morning.</p>
<p>Strict Orders to Recover Slaughter Surtax: The county government previously approved Wang Yun'gong's statement that the merchants of the slaughter tax alleged that the business tax was to be changed and levied due to the abolition of the through-taxes, so they only allowed half of the construction surtax to be levied. When the tooth tax and the slaughter tax were issued in January. On the 15th, the provincial order was to continue to handle the tax as before and allocate it for education expenses, which has nothing to do with the abolition of the through-taxes. Yesterday, it specifically notified the tax payers to abide by the established case and pay the full amount, and not to delay the payment under any pretext, so as not to cause inconvenience.</p>
<p>The Hengyi Steamer of Nan Tang Overturned: The case of the Hengyi Steamer of the Taili Company overturning on the 14th of last month near the Nanshui Xian Temple, drowning ten passengers (men and women), was brought to the county court by the relatives of the deceased. Yesterday, the prosecutor's office opened a court to investigate the case. Five people, including Yang Qiaoquan, Yang Boquan, Mi Zhu, and Wang Wenying, arrived from the family members of the deceased. Prosecutor Zhu Zonghai, who was a candidate, ascended the court and signed the order to bring the company manager Yang Xiangqi, the old helmsman Lu Xingsheng, and the treasurer Xiang Sanbao, who were in custody, to the court for interrogation. First, the plaintiffs, the family members of the deceased, were called one by one and asked to give a detailed account of the tragic incident and requested that the crime be punished according to law to clear the snow for the dead. Next, Yang Xiangqi was interrogated. He stated that he was the manager of Taili Company. The company was a joint venture and was divided into six shares. He only accounted for half of the total amount of the shares, which was 1,800 yuan. He did not know anything about the accident of the steamer. The official asked how it was possible to carry more passengers when only twelve passengers were inspected at the time. Yang replied that there were only a dozen people. Six of them were on official business and did not buy tickets. The steamer staff could not stop them. The official asked if the steamer accident was purely caused by overloading passengers. He said that there were only a dozen people. Now, ten bodies have been recovered, and fourteen people have been rescued. Nine people were revived in the kiln, two in the bathroom, and three others escaped. In total, there were twenty-four people, which is more than double the prescribed number. This proves that overloading passengers caused the disaster. Yang lowered his head and said nothing. Next, Xiang Sanbao was interrogated. He stated that a total of 47 tickets were sold on the ship, carrying 47 people. The steamer had been inspected by the customs, but the tow boat was not inspected. Prosecutor Zhu said that if the tow boat was not inspected, it was a private passenger carrier. How could it be allowed to sail without inspecting the tow boat? He replied that this was the right of the old master, and we could not interfere. After that, Lu Xingsheng was interrogated. He replied that he had been working at Yan Dong for more than two years. The official said that you were not experienced and it was no wonder that something went wrong. When asked why there were so many passengers, why not add another tow boat, he replied that since the company started operating, business has been very slow and the old master was unwilling to spend money to hire a boat. At this point, Prosecutor Zhu ordered the family members to return, and Yang Xiangqi, Lu Xingsheng, and Xiang Sanbao were returned to custody to await public prosecution.</p>

After Magistrate Zhang signed the order to bring the Gao bandit to court, Magistrate Li questioned him about his age and address. Then, Magistrate Li interrogated him about the facts of the crimes committed by the Gao bandit in Cheng, as recorded in the files.  However, his confession was evasive and he stubbornly refused to tell the truth. He only claimed that when he was arrested in his village, the villagers gouged out his eyeballs. Fortunately, after arriving at the Yangtou Bridge military camp, his eyeballs were put back in. At the time, they also wanted to cut off his ears, but the military stopped them, so they were only slightly cut. After the interrogation, he was instructed to put his fingerprint on the confession, and he was sent back to prison.</p>

<p>Plaintiff in Land Case Requests Exemption from Summons: Huang Bingying, a local resident, previously filed a complaint with the Provincial Department accusing Detective Captain Yang Bingwei and others of embezzling opium and dividing it among themselves. The province ordered the county government to thoroughly investigate. Because both the plaintiff and the defendant failed to appear in court, only Xing Huiwen, who guaranteed Yang and Wu, was detained. Yesterday (the 4th), Huang Bingying returned to Cheng from Beijing and petitioned the Public Security Bureau to exempt the plaintiff from summons until Yang Bingwei, Chen Xiangbao, and Wu Shanbao were apprehended. In the afternoon, Magistrate Li interrogated Xing Huiwen again. Xing claimed that Yang and others were all public officials in office, and the guarantee was based on friendship. Magistrate Li said, "If you can find them, you will be fine. The government will also send people to find them. You can tell them that the matter has implicated many people in the party and government, as well as newspapers. They can come out. Don't let it come to a wanted order." Then he ordered his detention.</p>
<p>Transfer of Trial Official Yang: Yang Ying, the Trial Official of this county, took office on March 29th of last year.

They specifically presented this issue to the Cheng-Xi County Governments and the Construction Bureau, requesting them to detain the steamer and prohibit its operation. Yesterday, they also telegraphed the Construction Department, stating that it was obstructing the industry and disrupting shipping administration, and requested Cheng-Xi two counties to immediately seize the steamer to uphold the law and maintain order in shipping administration. The deputy township heads of the Eleventh District and Qinan Township also held a meeting to oppose the steamer passing through the Shantang River outlet and detouring to Wuxi, and appointed Zhou Meilin, Yan Ping, and eight others to be responsible for negotiating with Qiaozhen Company.</p>

<p>Two Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad: The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously sent the two kidnappers, Xu Abao and Li Aqiu, who were sent by the Special Operations Squad of the Security Team. According to the interrogation, the bandits confessed that on November 21st of last year at 3:00 PM, they, along with the deceased bandit leader Lao Mao and five others, armed with a wooden-cased gun and a Browning pistol, kidnapped two children, Cheng Zhenqing and Cheng Jisheng, in Jiangwan, Paitou, Wukang.

<p>Difficulty in Clearing Autonomous Household Donations: Since the establishment of the district offices in Xiaoshan, the county government, due to a lack of funds, has been handling autonomous household donations in various townships and towns. However, ordinary village officials have been using this as a major source of income, causing the residents to complain. Magistrate Du has become aware of the situation and has appointed several clearing officials to go to the countryside to clear the donations. For villages that have been handling the donations for 18 or 19 years, they will handle it for one year, and from the 20th year onwards, the county will handle it. Unexpectedly, after the clearing officials went to the countryside to clear the donations, few people paid them.

<p>Jingdezhen Porcelain Merchants Petition for Exemption from Porcelain Tax: Jingdezhen is famous for its porcelain production.</p>
<p>Commerce has always been prosperous. Although in the past decade, due to the low tax rate, large quantities of foreign porcelain have been imported, it has inevitably been hit hard, but it has not lost its original position. Unfortunately, last year it was captured by Red Bandits three times. Silver, money, and goods were looted, totaling more than 10 million losses. Tens of thousands of workers were forced to go with them. Therefore, after the bandits retreated, the market was desolate and slumped. Although the Chamber of Commerce has urged various kilns to resume operations, it is difficult to see enthusiasm. Not only are the equipment and raw materials destroyed by the bandits, but it is also difficult to recruit the required workers. The kilns that are now back in operation are less than one-tenth of the usual amount. The General Chamber of Commerce, seeing this, convened a meeting last month to discuss post-disaster measures. It was unanimously agreed that the city was bankrupt and deeply traumatized, and that a request to the government to exempt the special tax on porcelain would not be enough to compensate for the losses. Therefore, on the deletion date, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance requesting a three-year tax exemption for relief. At the same time, the National United Association of Porcelain Merchants in Zhen is also carrying out a tax exemption campaign. It is heard that if necessary, merchants will also have to send representatives to Beijing to petition in order to achieve their goals as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Recently, the newspapers have repeatedly reported that the people of our village have engaged in illegal activities, such as selling drugs, possessing firearms, and robbing in all directions, storing the great crimes, and accusing all the people of our village. After reading it, we were shocked. According to the people of this village, 19 are engaged in the slaughtering and leather industries as the main occupation, and the rest rely on farming for a living. The customs have always been simple and honest, and they are thrifty by nature. There is no one who sells poisonous substances, let alone a secret den for making gold pills. Recently, there have been villains seeking revenge, designing to frame us. All the people of our village swear not to admit it. As for saying that the residents of this village are inherently strong, and in this eventful time in Henan Province, they often surround defeated soldiers and order them to hand over their weapons, that there are now several pistols, several rifles, and even machine guns and cannons, it is even more absurd. There were not many residents in this village to begin with. Although there has been an increase over the years, there are now only about 200 households, but the report says more than 3,000 households, which is very inconsistent with the facts. This is one. The Red Spear Society of Henan Province is nominally the Republic of China, but in reality, it is a disguised form of bandits. It has long been known to both Chinese and foreigners. Jing County belongs to Henan Province, and it is no exception. Burning, killing, and looting are commonplace. And surrounding defeated soldiers and ordering them to hand over their weapons is nothing more than what they do. The facts are all there, and the people of the country know it together. The people of our village have always believed in Islam and never participated in any associations. Now, the actions of the Red Spear Society are being attributed to the people of our village. Isn't this a case of mistaken identity? This is two. In short, the people of our village have always been law-abiding and have never engaged in any illegal activities. All the sections in the report are purely false. In addition to informing various newspaper offices to make corrections, we hereby solemnly declare that we hope all sectors will investigate. Respectfully, Bai Yingfu, Mai Facai, Chen Mingxian, Shan Xinyong, Tong Huchen, and Ding Jukui, villagers of Xinzhuang, Bo'ai County, Henan Province.</p>

<p>(E) Grassland Reclamation and Livestock Farm: Investigation of the wasteland on both sides of the Wei River in Caotan Town, Chang'an, extending from Xianyang in the west to Weinan in the east, covers an area of no less than a thousand hectares. In recent years, only over two thousand mu have been reclaimed, and the rest is still wasteland, covered with lush grass, which is a pity. It is planned to establish a reclamation and livestock farm there, selecting the land that can be cultivated to plant five grains, and the remaining land will be used as a pasture to test various livestock and improve their breeds. The estimated initial cost is over 10,000 yuan. (F) Shaanxi North Reclamation Zone: Northern Shaanxi is sparsely populated and in dire need of prosperity. It is proposed to establish a Shaanxi North Reclamation Zone in the Yan'an area, with 100,000 yuan to attract virtuous people from outside to engage in animal husbandry and reclamation. After making profits, it will be gradually expanded to restore the prosperity of the Northern Wei Dynasty.</p>
<p>In addition, it is planned to advocate the compilation and printing of various popular agricultural and forestry books, to be distributed to the people, such as the improvement of cotton planting, the quality of fertilization, and the digging of ditches to store water, treating the fields, and digging wells. Specialists will be assigned to handle each task according to the actual situation in Shaanxi, carefully considering the implementation, and widely publicizing it to achieve significant results.</p>
<p>Seventh, regarding culture, it is planned to first build an exhibition hall in Xi'an, where various machines and agricultural implements from various countries that can be practical for Shaanxi Province will be selected and displayed to serve as models for the people to imitate. In addition, domestic and foreign products will be displayed for comparison and reproduction. The agricultural and industrial products of the province will also be widely collected, classified, and displayed, with explanations of their uses and manufacturing methods to arouse the public's interest in industry. The estimated initial cost is 100,000 yuan, and it will be gradually expanded in the future. Secondly, it is planned to build a meteorological station on Mount Hua, to connect with major meteorological stations in the country. The estimated initial cost is 50,000 yuan, and it will be gradually expanded. Thirdly, it is planned to promote rain gauges in various counties. The instruments will be manufactured by the Construction Department and ordered by the counties.</p>
<p>The above three matters must be carefully planned this year to prepare for implementation. In addition, there are projects that should be restored, one is the Huaqing Park in Lintong County, and the other is the Revolutionary Memorial Park in Xi'an City. Huaqing Park includes the scenic Lishan Hot Springs. It is planned to restore it and build a hotel to provide rest for tourists. The total cost is estimated to be about 100,000 yuan. The Revolutionary Memorial Park has a large area, and it will take time to complete. The planned cost is estimated to be about 50,000 yuan. The above various plans are currently important projects in Shaanxi and are also necessary for the people of Shaanxi to live. In fact, for Shaanxi, which is riddled with holes, there is nothing that does not need to be built. As the saying goes, "To climb high, one must start from the low; to travel far, one must start from the near." Therefore, the 20th year is only the beginning of the implementation of construction in Shaanxi. I dare not make grandiose claims or engage in empty talk that does not benefit the people's livelihood. (End)</p>

<p>Amidst thousands of calls and expectations, the China-Portugal World Cup football replay will take place at Yiyuan today at 3:00 PM. China's talents are at their peak. The key to today's victory or defeat lies in whether the most elite lineup can be fielded. It should be known that the Portuguese have long been determined to sacrifice for their country, and all the famous assassins in the city are ready to go, prepared for a big battle. I hope that the selected athletes will be able to show their fearless spirit and work hard for the country. At that time, all will be on the front line. Hopefully, they will not degrade themselves and be spurned by the Chinese people. If they are fierce and strong, we are also elite. A ninety-minute battle for the deer, whether it wins or loses, will give our people good comfort. Finally, we hope that the weather will be bright so that it can be held as scheduled.

According to the standings, the two teams have each won 20 sets and lost 2 sets. Whoever wins three out of five today will be the champion. However, according to the regulations, the champion team must have the most sets and the most points. Before the game, China Qing had 307 points and Mac Ling had 303 points. If Mac Ling wins three out of two, they still need to win five more points, otherwise the two teams will have to play again. Therefore, China is superior in terms of both form and strength.

<h3 id="e125">Recording a Guest's Talk About Wu Changshuo's Portrait <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Among paintings, there is what is called "conveying the spirit," which means using brush and ink to depict a person's appearance and capturing their spirit. The two words "conveying the spirit" first appeared in "A New Account of Tales of the World." Gu Changkang painted people, sometimes not dotting the eyes for several years. When people asked him why, he said that conveying the spirit lies precisely in the "a du." Common depictions of the spirit mostly are rigid and dull, creating an image of someone sitting upright in formal attire, with a craftsman's touch filling the paper, so rotten it makes one want to vomit. Famous painters are ashamed to do so. However, taking pictures for virtuous people, arranging garden scenery, and not adding detailed descriptions of clothing, resulting in an elegant style, can also create world-renowned works. Ren Yi (Bonian), from Shanyin, painted Wu Changshuo's portrait among banana trees on a stone bed. Changshuo exposed his body, waving a cattail fan, sitting on it. A sense of leisure is abundantly revealed in the silk painting. It is truly a masterpiece by Ren. After Changshuo's death, his collection of paintings was printed as a collotype at the end. Last year, the Wu Changshuo Painting Exhibition was opened at the 63rd Garden on Jiangwan Road. I have always admired Old Cang and, since the 63rd Garden is close to my residence, I went to visit once. Ren Bonian's portrait was hung high on the white wall. The brush strokes are ancient and elegant, completely different from ordinary depictions of the spirit. Facing it makes one imagine the predecessors' elegance without end. The painting is deeply imprinted in my mind, and it has been a year or two since then. A guest who is familiar with Changshuo's life said that Ren's portrait was not initially a portrait of Changshuo. The portrait has a short stature and is robust, which matches Changshuo perfectly. Changshuo got it, carved out its head and face, asked someone to draw his own face, and then had it mounted. It was patched up perfectly, like a seamless garment. As the saying goes, "changing the head and face," Changshuo actually carried it out mischievously. Whether the guest's account is accurate or not is unknown, but the matter is quite interesting, so it is recorded. It serves as an interpretation for those who care about the art world.</p>

<h3 id="e128">An Essay on Ancient Egyptian Beetle Amulets <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Jinshi</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, I, along with Mr. and Mrs. Ge Mei and Mr. and Mrs. Liu Fan You, visited the bookplate exhibition at the Mingfu Library. Among them, there were no fewer than hundreds of meticulously printed and copied books from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, classified and displayed, gathering secret copies from collectors all over the country in one hall for public viewing. This is not only a joyful event for the moment but also an unprecedented grand occasion in thousands of years. It is truly delightful. Besides these, the oracle bones from the Yin Ruins, the clay seals from Qi and Lu, the bronze seals from the Qin and Han dynasties, the handwritten scriptures from the Tang dynasty, and the scriptures hidden in the Leifeng Pagoda are all rare treasures in the world, exuding an ancient and fragrant atmosphere that fills the room. What is particularly peculiar is the ancient Egyptian beetle amulets collected by Mr. Zhang Tianfang, which are truly something I have never seen or heard of before. The amulets are all oval in shape, the large ones are like thumbs, and the small ones are only like melon seeds. The back is carved with the image of a beetle, hence the name. The abdomen is engraved with characters, with a small hole in the middle, presumably for threading a rope to wear as a pendant. The body color is emerald green, and at first glance, it looks exactly like a beetle. As a person with an addiction to antiquities, I was immediately amazed and overjoyed. I exclaimed, "Is the use of amulets and seals unique to our country?" Unfortunately, Mr. Zhang was not present, so I could not question him face to face. More than a month later, I visited my old friend Mr. Cao Liwu at Jinan University and, through Liwu's introduction, I met Mr. Tianfang. I immediately asked to see the ancient seals. At that time, Mr. Zhang was resting at home due to illness, but he readily got up and showed me the seals, teaching me earnestly. There were a total of forty-five seals (two of which had no characters). The material was either stone or pottery, with ancient mottled colors, probably objects from thousands of years ago, which he obtained while studying in France. Each one was worth about four or five yuan at the time. Not only have they never been seen in China before, but even foreign collectors rarely see them. They are extremely precious and secretive. Examining the characters, they are mostly auspicious words or words related to deities, presumably worn on the chest to ward off misfortune. The script is ancient, peculiar, and exquisite, with its own unique style. Some seals have several characters, while others have only one character. The composition is balanced and harmonious, delicate and meticulous. Some have images of the sun, moon, mountains, and rivers; some are like nude women dancing or sitting in meditation playing the qin; some are like holding reins and standing, or carrying a staff and walking. The origin of Egyptian writing can be seen in these. I caressed them for a long time, reluctant to let go. I then made rubbings by hand. Because the seals were too small, it was difficult to pick them up. It took half a day to complete forty-three rubbings, and my fingers were already unbearably sore. After finishing the rubbings, I rested for a while. Mr. Zhang then showed me dozens of ancient Egyptian porcelain and stone artifacts, all of which were exquisite and delightful. Mr. Zhang is proficient in poetry and prose and also deeply versed in archaeology, so his collections are numerous and exquisite. He presented me with his volume of archaeological studies and the "Nancun Collection." I then bid farewell and left, returning home to record the entire process with my pen, to inform gentlemen who love antiquities at home and abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Supplementary Notes on Pinching Likenesses <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>After my previous article "Recording Likenesses Pinched by Hand" was published, I received information from friends stating that the former generation of Mr. Gu Zhiwei and Mr. Gu Jianzhou of Jiayi also had portraits left behind, which were sculpted at the time and remain intact to this day. It is a great pity that I have not been able to see them.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Mr. Ge Jiantan also said that there are still masters of likeness pinching today. A friend of his in Shanghai had a portrait of a couple pinched, sometime in the spring of the year before last. The sculptor was hired from Guangfu Township in Suzhou, but his name is now lost. However, he remembers that his surname was Zheng, and it is not easy to obtain his permission. One must go through intermediaries to urge him to come and try his skills. When he arrives, one cannot treat him merely as an artisan but must be sincere and respectful, as if treating a distinguished guest. His work involves sitting face to face with the person, always doing it under the table. Therefore, the person never knows how he does it. It takes more than a month for the portrait to be completed. The face is not allowed to be shown until it is finished, and even if the folds of the clothes are complete, the shoes and birds are not finished, it is still kept secret. When it is seen, it is lifelike and vibrant. Whether one knows the person or not, one can recognize them and point out their name. Such is the magic of his skill. He also said that the cost is very high. Each portrait costs nearly a hundred yuan, not including the cost of food, drinks, and rest.</p>
<p>According to the above description, it is similar to the facts I previously recorded, but the timing is different. It is probably another person, but with the same skills. The only similarity is that they are both from Suzhou. Although their names are unknown, I believe someone must know them. Perhaps they are direct descendants of the same school, so they can shine successively in the world. I have a strong interest in the arts, especially the masterpieces. I cannot help but describe them again and again. I also hope that those who are knowledgeable can expand on this.</p>
<h3 id="e130">A Record of Reviving Fish by Boiling <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Last winter was severely cold, unprecedented in Nanzhong for thirty years. My wife, Fu Ji, and I happened to be traveling in the countryside. We had no companions on the journey and only brought thirty of our favorite fine goldfish with us. However, the countryside was bitterly cold, and with frequent rain and snow, the climate was colder than in the city. Although we placed them indoors and changed the well water once a day to keep their body temperature from freezing, eight goldfish with upturned gills and celestial eyes simultaneously had difficulty swimming on their sides. Their breathing was also very rapid. Shortly after, their breathing slowed down, and their spirits gradually stopped. Four fish actually floated to the surface and died. I was quite reluctant, but since there was no fragrance of resurrection, I let it be. Suddenly, Fu Ji said to me, "Treat a dead horse as if it were a live one. Why not move them into warm water and see if they can revive?" I tried it as she said. In a short while, they actually showed signs of life. I was very happy. I poured more water into the pot, and the fish were moved in. When the charcoal was hot and the water gradually heated up, the fish also gradually moved. Their breathing in the gills also became more frequent. Soon, they were swimming as if they were alive, without any sluggishness. When I tested the water with my finger, it was about to boil. I quickly changed the well water. To this day, they are still safe and sound. Fu Ji laughed and said, "You have invented this method of reviving fish by boiling. Why don't you write it and send it to Mr. Juan?" I smiled and responded, writing this to inform fish lovers.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Tianbai, I have received your letter. "Hongwei's Sentimental Recollections" is a short piece in parallel prose and was published in the "Nanshe Congkan" (now lost and unavailable). There is no separate book. Respectfully, your brother, Juan.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's "A Word of Insight," the name signed "Cai Shangsi" should be "Cai Ensi." Also, the author of "Monkeys Addicted to Tobacco" is "Jianfu," mistakenly written as "Cangfu." We hereby correct these.</p>

<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>About an hour after leaving the Rome station, we arrived at the Italian coast. Looking out at the horizon from the train window, I saw only a strip of white light appearing through the mist. The weather in Italy in April is the best time of the year. The sky is slightly cloudy. A few white gulls were foraging on the sea. The coolness of the morning was refreshing. This gentle feeling of late spring made the travelers feel happy. Along the way, we passed countless straits. The artificial decorations all contained a sense of beauty. Although not as excellent as Switzerland, it was enough for us to admire. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the train stopped at Pisa in central Italy. This place has a leaning tower, a place where poets and painters linger and are reluctant to leave. Especially in the history of art, it is extremely famous.</p>
<p>In central Italy, the Cathedoral church that we can see now was built between 1063 and 1092. It mainly adopts the basilica style, with some byyantium elements added. Its gorgeous and majestic characteristics can be called the initial form of romanesque architecture. Later, churches modeled after this style could be seen throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Visiting the Cathedoral church in Pisa is enough to satisfy us, but there are also two world-famous buildings: the Leaning Tower and the Baptistery. The Leaning Tower campanite is named for its leaning shape. One theory is that the ground subsided during construction, causing it to lean. Another theory is that the tower was deliberately tilted when it was built. This is a building from 1117. The whole body is seven stories with arched openings, with a round tower on top. The inclination is thirty-three feet. The colors are ancient and mottled. Its grandeur is unparalleled. The magnificence of the Baptistery, although not as great as the Leaning Tower, is more beautiful than the Leaning Tower and the Cathedoral church. It was built in 1153. The plan is circular, with a diameter of one hundred and twenty-nine feet. It is made entirely of marble. Looking at the whole, it has a simple characteristic.</p>
<p>After visiting Pisa for four hours, we took the train again. A French clergyman came into the same carriage. He was serving in the Vatican. He was very amiable. The clergyman told us the story of the Leaning Tower, which, although containing religious significance, has a close relationship with art. European countries maintain historical antiquities very completely. Although the tower has been leaning for more than eight hundred years, it has not collapsed because people often take care of it and have repeatedly repaired it, preserving its ancient meaning.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Financial Gold Price Plummets <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲Drop of... Twenty-eight taels and six mace</p>
<p>▲English-Indian Political Strife Has Peaceful News. Yesterday, March 6th, gold prices suddenly showed a low drop. The market's changes were so drastic that it was the most drastic, with collapses of four or five taels to more than ten taels. The industry's central thoughts were still... and confused and at a loss. Sellers accounted for the majority. Zifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Fufuyong, Fuchang Hengxingyuan, and others sold their positions. Hengxing Dalian Gang and Hedgers mostly bought. Foreign exchange has tended to be exhausted, and the listed price is slightly longer by half a point. Bank purchases are still strong. The overseas silver market suddenly reported an increase, and people were terrified. Gold prices opened low and it was reported that the English-Indian political strife may be peaceful. The news that silver prices were expected to rise caused major players to sell off aggressively, suddenly breaking through the fifty-tael mark. Afterwards, buyers became active, and the exchange rate seemed stable, so they saw a premium of seven or eight taels. However, speculators' intention to sell continued, and the exchange rate continued to loosen, and the market weakened again. It turned sharply downward, plummeting more than ten taels, and even falling to the forty-tael mark. The market outlook was different for buyers and sellers, but the exchange rate was always loose, making it difficult for prices to be supported. It quickly broke through forty taels, but the rise and fall were uncertain. Finally, it fell to about thirty-seven taels. The environment was precarious. Spot goods must increase by eight taels in addition to the period mark. This morning, big bullion continued to rise.</p>
<p>▲The morning opened with a setback of seven taels and six mace. The April opening price in the morning was seven hundred and fifty-eight taels, a drop of seven taels and six mace. Big bullion, which was seen as low the day before yesterday, suddenly rose one, two, five to one, eight, seven, five, unexpectedly. Silver prices also increased by a quarter. Private telegrams were also longer by sixteen and three-eighths. Afterwards, it rose slightly by one and a half taels, to fifty-nine and a half taels. However, Fuchang, Yuansheng, Hengxingyuan, and others tended to sell off and were weak again, plummeting more than ten taels, only forty-eight taels. The buying price for English gold by British banks in April and May increased from 128.125 to 93.75, probably because Hengxing and hedgers bought in when the first order was announced, so it increased by four or five taels, totaling fifty-three taels. Although the listed price increased by 1.25, the US dollar was 0.25, and the Japanese gold went down by half a point, it did not move and only retreated by two and a half taels. However, Sumitomo, Mitsui, and McCallie HSBC all bought English gold at 93.75 to 8.75 in April and May, so the gold price rose to fifty-six taels. At nine and three-quarters, it softened again because Qianchangxiang Hongli and others all had hands, so it dropped to forty-eight taels and five mace. In an instant, it went back up by more than five taels. Hengxing and others bought in. At ten o'clock, it was fifty-four taels. Because Fuyu, Yuanmao, Yongteng, Fengyong, Qianchangxiang, and others desperately sold off, the British gold became harder. Banks made three pence, then three pence and zero, six, two, five, which was still difficult to close. People's hearts were particularly weak, and the situation turned sharply downward, plummeting fourteen or five taels, a huge storm. At eleven thirty, it was only thirty-five taels. Afterwards, Yuanmao, Yongwanxing, Fuyu, and others dragged in the upper court, so it was pulled up by four or five taels. However, the market's ups and downs were erratic, fluctuating by more than four taels in an instant. When the market was about to close, it was raised to forty-four taels and five mace. The closing price was forty-two taels and eight mace. It was then raised to four taels, and speculators re-entered. The opening price has been changed to 804 taels and six mace, which is fifty to sixty-four or five taels. The noon closing price was sixty taels.</p>
<p>▲In the evening market, exchange rates were loose and unbearable. The later market opened at forty-five taels and five mace, followed by forty-three taels and five mace. Hengxing Yuanmao Yong, etc., purchased, and then rose to forty-six taels and a half. Mitsui absorbed April Japanese gold at 1 tael, 6 mace, 2.5 to 75 points. Banks also made April English gold three pence. After entering, English gold became loose, and Dalian Gang Qianchangxiang Yuanmao Yong, etc., tended to sell. It was heard that the Indian exchange rate reported a big three or four Anna, and the full price fell sharply. It could be settled at English gold 1.3125, so at two forty, it plummeted ten taels, only thirty-six taels and three mace. Soon, Fuyu Yuanmao Yong, etc., re-entered, and it was pulled up by four taels. At about three o'clock, it was forty taels. Five mace, suddenly it was suppressed to thirty-seven taels and a half. It only began to level out at three twenty, because Hengxing and Hedgers bought in, resulting in a high of four or five taels, but there were often two taels of ups and downs. At three forty-five, it was forty-two taels and five taels. At this time, the Indian exchange rate reported a low of three Anna. After four o'clock, the sellers flourished again, and the English gold 1.31875, the bank still had no intention to buy, so it was cut down by five or six taels, suddenly thirty-six taels and two mace. Finally, it added slightly more than one tael. The market closed at thirty-seven taels at four thirty, a drop of twenty-eight taels and six mace compared to the previous day. The maximum price of the day was fifty-five taels and a half, and the minimum price was thirty-six taels and two mace, a difference of twenty-three taels and three mace. The early market price of goods was fifty-eight taels and a half, the noon closing price was forty-four taels, the afternoon was forty-five taels and two mace, and the closing price was thirty-seven taels. The opening price was between sixty taels and sixty-eight taels. The book closing price was between thirty-six taels and forty-three taels in the morning, and the afternoon was not logged. The water supplement was thirty-six taels, and thirty taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲Large speculators dumped huge amounts of money, and transactions between various peers were varied. Zifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuancheng, Hongli, Yifengyong, Hengxingyuan, Qianti, Dadesheng, Fuxingyong, and others all sold. Hengxing, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanmaoyong, and two hedgers all bought. Hengyu, Yuantai, Changshengyong, Futaiheng, Taifengcheng, and Yongfengcheng had a lot of receipts and payments. Fuyu initially sold and then bought, allegedly on behalf of a major player. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Dadesheng, Dakang, Yuhe, Yuantai, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, etc., suddenly sold and bought again. Shunli, Wanxing, and Fuyu had more demand than supply. Yuancheng Yong and Yuanmao Hengxing all entered. Zifengyong, Hongli, and Tongtaichang all sold. The incoming and outgoing goods were inconsistent. Speculator Wu initially sold and then bought, in large numbers. The Guang Gang also bought two thousand several hundred bars, and the Dalian Gang sold one thousand six or seven hundred bars, and bought two thousand two or three hundred bars.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Foreign Exchange Trend is Loose <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets suddenly reported increases, but the market was flat and there were still many buyers. British and American exchange rates also increased slightly. As for the Shanghai foreign exchange market, the trend was loose. HSBC's listed price increased by half a point. English gold was 125, 1 shilling, 2 pence, 625 points. US dollars were 25, 29 yuan, 625 points. Indian exchange rates were 75, 81 rupees. French francs were 6 yuan, 755 yuan.

Hong Kong was still 77 taels, 75 points. Japanese gold fell by one and a half points, 1 tael, 6 qian, 7 points. The inner disk initially tended to be loose, then peaceful, and then exhausted at noon. The afternoon was more affected by the particularly tired gold market, which suddenly broke through 740 taels. Overall, silver prices were largely stimulated by rising prices. When the afternoon market closed, English gold was half a penny higher than the previous day, US dollars were 93.75, and Japanese gold fell by 5 points and 75. The Chinese gold industry, which specializes in hedging, tended to sell and hedged back the strips [,] which was the opposite of yesterday afternoon. Banks still had a wide appetite, and the total gold turnover was about 400,000 pounds. Mitsui Shanghai Sumitomo Taiwan McCallie HSBC Datong Huabi Zhengjin and others all absorbed, but Fuchang and others sometimes closed, sold by Mitsui Shanghai. Banks made several hundred thousand pounds with each other and made 200,000 US dollars.

<h3 id="e137">The Yarn and Cotton Market Experiences a Sharp Decline <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market suddenly weakened, and the decline was severe. The rapid changes in recent days have left people bewildered. The market fluctuates greatly, rising and falling unpredictably. This situation is entirely affected by the financial wave. In addition, rumors are rife in the business community, and people are panicked. The spot yarn market is lifeless, and the marked yarn at 177-178 taels is already a high level and is prone to changes in response to any news. In fact, there is an upward trend, but the actual demand is sluggish because domestic farmers' purchasing power is insufficient. The higher the price, the more stagnant the transaction. The future of the yarn market is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲ Marked Yarn Fell by as Much as Three Taels. In the morning market, the marked yarn opened with steady American cotton and a weaker gold price, causing the market sentiment to soften, with each decline ranging from 8-9 cents to 1-2 taels. In the second session, buyers raised the price, recovering 8-9 cents. The market closed with each decline ranging from 7 cents to 1.346 taels. In the afternoon, the marked yarn market suddenly turned sharply downward because bankers sold off, causing the market to suddenly weaken, with prices falling in each session. Each month fell by 2.12456 taels. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 33,350 bales. It was found that Tianlong sold 5,500 bales, Rongxing 1,250 bales, Lichang 1,000 bales, Mingde 1,000 bales, and Xincheng 600 bales. Heshen bought 1,150 bales, Gongtai 1,300 bales, Changfeng 2,550 bales, and Gengfeng 800 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>May, 1738, 3833,100</p>
<p>August, 1736, 388,500</p>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Demand is Even Weaker. The sales of spot yarn are becoming increasingly sluggish. It was found that the total purchase by each gang for the whole day was only 510 bales. Among the same trade, 650 bales were imported, and the market price fell by 2-3 taels. Among the guest gangs, 340 bales were imported from the mainland, 35 bales from Jiangxi, 30 bales from Hong Kong, 50 bales from Tianjin, and 51 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>

<p>The cotton market experienced a major decline, and the downturn was sharp. The recent changes have been rapid, with sudden falls and rises, making it difficult to grasp. The overseas cotton market is generally flat, but the exchange rate has been extended, the gold market has fallen sharply, and the Shanghai yarn market is sluggish. The attitude of each factory is indifferent, so people are terrified. Yesterday's hot situation has suddenly turned into a collapse. However, some bulls are taking advantage of the rise to exit, so the market is becoming more and more loose.</p>
<p>▲ Han Marked Cotton Drops by One Taels. The Han Marked Cotton market opened with a flat Indian cotton rising trend, and gold prices also fell. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and there were many scattered settlements. Each fell by 4-6 cents. In the afternoon, news of a sharp fall in gold prices caused panic, and selling intensified, with each falling by 8-9 cents. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 60,200 dan. It was found that Tianlong sold 6,400 dan, Shenchang 3,300 dan, Ruida 2,500 dan, and Yichang 2,900 dan. Gongtai bought 2,700 dan, Changfeng 2,200 dan, Shenda 2,600 dan, and Yongda 2,200 dan.

<p>▲ American Cotton Bulls Settle. Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to bull settlement and reactionary selling. Futures fell by 6-9 points, and spot fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 4-5 points, and spot rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 10 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to purchases by Japanese merchants and exporters, but later weakened due to bull profit-taking and weakness in Liverpool. Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, and forward rose by 2 rupees. Aomla and Bairoxi rose by 2 rupees for both near and far months. The original telegram is recorded on the left (5th telegram).</p>

<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, the number of boats arriving from various gangs was scarce due to the rain. The market transaction was also light. The white japonica rice was slightly opened, and the market price continued to weaken. The thin indica rice was still less common, and the market was dull and soft. The sheep indica rice and Du indica rice were all stable. The price of high-quality rice was slightly loose, and the price of medium-quality rice was slightly lower. Although there were transactions throughout the day, the amount was small.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: Yesterday, few boats arrived. The sales in this street turned brisk. Various parties paid attention to japonica rice such as Su Tong, while Changxi white japonica rice was not very active. However, prices were uniformly strengthening. The thin early rice from the South Gang was also slightly畅销, and the overall market was elevated. The transaction of sheep, Du and pointed rice was bleak, slightly tight. The white yuan goods were scarce and the market was strong, with little change in price.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Tianjin Gang Continues to Handle Guest Rice <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of guest indica rice and guest yuan rice were very active, and the market continued to improve. The situation of guest yuan rice was even better due to the eagerness of guest gangs to handle it. Yesterday, the Tianjin Gang offered to handle 100 bags of Hunan yuan rice at a price of 14 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. 150 bags of Jiangxi yuan rice were priced at 14 yuan and 6 jiao and 6 fen. Although the goods were slightly better, the market price was still about 2 jiao higher than the previous day. The appetite for guest indica rice was weak, and the street handled 500 bags of Nanjing car goods, calculated as Nanjing machine rice at 9 yuan and 8 jiao and a half to 9 yuan and 8 jiao, and willow brown rice at 9 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 9 yuan. However, the appetite of the national households was still good.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month once showed a lively image, although the price of foreign wheat was slightly lower by 1-2 jiao, because the spring rain was very sudden, the psychology outside the industry was quite turned on, and at that time the attitude of the factories also waited and watched before, so each month was generally one point better than the previous day, but since the second session, it gradually softened again. Until the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere changed greatly again, because the gold price fell very weakly, and according to the narration of foreign firms, it was said that a certain factory had also made an Australian order, and the combined price was only 4 taels and 1 qian and a half, so the large factories were extremely smooth in selling the forward contracts, and the months of June, July and August fell by 2-3 fen compared with the highest price in the morning, and once entered the 1 qian customs, according to this kind of scene, I am afraid that the forward contracts are still difficult to stand still. As a result, this month was 5 li lower than the previous day, April was 1 fen 1 li and a half lower, May and June were 7 li and a half lower, July was 1 fen lower, and August was 2 fen lower.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the market in each month, because the price of foreign wheat was slightly better, the market was stable. The new wheat for the distant months of June and July was once 2-3 fen better, and August was once 5 fen better. By the time of the afternoon opening, because it was reported that the gold price had fallen sharply and the flour market was also weak, each month was also flat. However, at present, those who sell short, if they do not have a foreign wheat order in their hands, do not dare to sell short. The thoughts of outsiders are all dominated by bulls, so the trading between the two sides is sparse, and the ups and downs are not huge. As a result, this month was 1 fen lower than the previous day, April and May were 2 fen lower, June was 1 fen lower, and July and August had no comparison. The spot wheat market is still flat. Yesterday, only 500 bags of Dongtai wheat were opened, and the price was 3 taels, 7 qian, and 3 fen, which was handled by Huafeng.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Consulate General, the U.S. Embassy will soon add a branch office in Shanghai, and the office building has been surveyed. It can probably accommodate a secretary and a clerk to work. However, there is no definite news on how many officials will be sent.

<h3 id="e154">British Newspaper Predicts That Demand for Silver Will Increase <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲ The situation will improve after the Indian political problem is resolved.</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the resolution of the Indian political problem is unlikely to have a good impact on the exchange rate in a day or two, but yesterday (5th), the popularity showed a good sign and the market was quite firm, probably because the demand for silver is about to increase and the exchange rate may increase. Not only can India's commerce fully reach this point, but also China's commerce. For example, from January to May of last year, the silk that China transported to India was worth one million taels of silver per month. Later, India implemented a boycott of foreign goods, and the silk transport stopped. Now it is expected that the commerce between the two countries will resume in a few days. This is a great benefit to China's export trade and is sufficient to benefit the exchange market. In addition, the trade between India and 英甸, especially for Lancashire, will have a turnaround due to the end of the boycott of foreign goods, and an effect of the same importance, or even more importance, is that India's silent export trade in recent months will be revived, so India must need more silver to be sent to the interior to pay for this item, which is also enough to make the market improve.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Japanese Scheme to Monopolize Northeast Shipping <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to restore its Northeast shipping rights. The British Swire Company has also opened routes from Shantou and Xiamen to Guangdong. Japanese shipping companies, upon hearing this, have planned various countermeasures, fearing intense competition. The following is a special report:</p>
<p>▲China Merchants Designates Regular Liners. Li Zhonggong, Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to develop Northeast shipping and recover lost shipping rights in Andong, Yingkou, etc., plans to add formal scheduled ships in the Northeast to transport goods such as soybeans from outside the customs. He ordered Shen Zhongyi, head of the business department, to conduct a detailed investigation and prepare for navigation. At the same time, Zhang Xiangcai was also commissioned to conduct on-the-spot inspections in Yingkou. As a result, it was decided to start shipping. Zhang Jicai has already submitted a report to Shanghai, listing detailed methods. After approval by Director-General Li, a branch office will be established in Yingkou, with Zhang as the branch manager. Now that the weather is gradually warming up, Yingkou will soon thaw. It has been decided to assign the company's largest ships, the "Gongping" and "Tunan," to serve as dedicated Shanghai-Yingkou liners, starting with the Shanghai-Yingkou route. After the company acquires new oceangoing vessels, it will add routes from Yingkou to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong. The regulations for the branch office are being drafted, and the Yingkou port wharf is being repaired. Navigation will begin in one or two weeks.</p>
<p>▲Weihaiwei Line to Open Simultaneously. The Weihaiwei Port Administration requested that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company add Shanghai-Weihaiwei ships to boost the local economy, facilitate transportation, and develop commerce. Li Zhonggong accepted the request and dispatched the Zhifu branch manager to Weihai to set up an agency. It was originally planned to have Tianjin liners also serve the route, but since the "Xinming" is under repair and the "Xinfeng" has been transferred to the Yangtze River, it was decided to have the two newly opened Yingkou liners also serve this port and Dalian. Because of the urgency to start the service, a telegram was sent to Xu Zushen of the Weihaiwei Port Administration yesterday, urging the payment of 4,000 yuan as preparation funds for the new route. In the future, mail to Weihai will also be exclusively loaded by China Merchants ships.</p>
<p>▲Swire Company Dedicates Four Ships. The British Swire Company,</p>
<p>which previously did not have scheduled ships in Yingkou, has recently opened a dedicated route from Shantou and Xiamen to Guangdong to compete for the transport of miscellaneous grains from the Northeast. It has designated four oceangoing vessels, "Ganzhou," "Liangzhou," "Luzhou," and "De'an," to operate scheduled services, competing to load soybeans, sorghum, soybean cakes, millet, etc., to various ports in South China. Since the start of the service, business has been very successful, arousing the jealousy of Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>▲South Manchuria Railway Hastens to Compete for the Transport of Northeast Miscellaneous Grains. The transport of miscellaneous grains from the Northeast has always been dominated by Japan, and the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) regards this as a vested right. Last year, it added 10 million yen of new capital to its affiliated Dalian Steamship Company to build eight new ships, four of which have already been completed. Its aim is to completely monopolize the export of goods from the three ports of Yingkou, Andong, and Dalian, using Mantetsu's land transportation to control all exports from the Northeast, preventing other countries' ships from getting involved. Last winter, it began a decisive battle to compete for transport with British Swire ships and Chinese Zhaoxing ships, recklessly cutting freight rates and disrupting cargo transport. Zhengji and other ships were severely affected, leading to staff reductions and salary cuts due to business losses. Swire entrusted a Japanese person to persuade Mantetsu to join a trade association and compete fairly by avoiding excessive rate cuts, but this was rejected by Mantetsu.</p>
<p>▲Intense Competition Imminent. Last year, Mantetsu made a profit of approximately 600,000 yuan. Once the second batch of four new ships is launched, it will open regular routes from Yingkou to South China. Recently, upon hearing that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is developing Northeast shipping routes, the Dalian Steamship Company considers it a formidable business rival. Therefore, at the recent shareholders' meeting, it proposed countermeasures against China Merchants' addition of Shanghai-Yingkou services. It is reported that it has been decided to use all of last year's profits to defend against Chinese ships. Once China Merchants ships start operating, freight rates will be drastically reduced, willing to use this huge amount of money to block Chinese ships from Northeast shipping. Therefore, the day China Merchants ships start operating the Shanghai-Yingkou route will mark the beginning of intense business competition among British, Japanese, and Chinese shipping companies, and a major upheaval is imminent, with the Japanese already preparing for it.</p>

Tang then stood up to respond, stating that he had been appointed by the central government as the magistrate of Zhongshan County, which concerned his hometown, and that he would do his best to fulfill the role, hoping that his fellow villagers would provide guidance. He said that governance did not require much talk, so he would refrain from making too many remarks, and would only strive to put in more effort in practice. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM. This reporter met with Tang yesterday, who stated that he had originally planned to travel with Minister Sun Zhesheng (Sun Ke), but Sun was unable to leave Beijing due to matters there, so Tang and others were traveling first. As for the opening of Zhongshan Port, a decision would be made after surveying. He would not stay in Shanghai and would return directly to Guangdong.</p>

<p>▲Issuance of First Flight Commemorative Envelopes</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Sino-German joint venture Eurasia Aviation Corporation, it is actively proceeding. The organization by the Ministry has been completed. The company is located on the third floor of the Zhongfu Bank on Renji Road. Aircraft have been successively transported and will begin flying soon. It is reported that the company will issue the first Eurasia Flight Commemorative Envelope during the week of the first flight, and the post office will specially stamp a commemorative postmark on the airmail stamps. All letters sent to Beijing, Ping, Manzhouli, and European countries can be purchased for commemoration.</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the aircraft of the Eurasia Airlines were originally scheduled to be assembled and test-flown by the end of this week. However, due to cloudy and rainy weather, coupled with delays in the installation project, they could not depart as scheduled. According to Schmidt, if the weather clears up in the future, the first test flight should be able to depart from Shanghai next Wednesday or Thursday. After the two aircraft used were transported last week, it was originally planned to assemble them all at the Hongqiao Airport. However, due to the excessive weight of the fuselage of one aircraft, there were no vehicles available for transport, so the aircraft parts had to be transported back to the warehouse for assembly. It was not until yesterday that the assembly was completed, and this morning (the 6th), the tail was supported by a car and pushed to the airport. The wings were transported by other vehicles and will also be assembled today. It is estimated that short-range test flights will be conducted near this city next Monday or Tuesday. The company has two more aircraft, which will be shipped by the Hengmei Company's Cooperland liner and will arrive in Shanghai on the 9th of this month.</p>

<p>▲Borrowing Gengzi Indemnity from the Yuehan Railway</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Hangyong Railway Bureaus previously planned to purchase ten locomotives and steel rails, etc., requiring approximately 170,000 pounds. However, due to financial difficulties, it has not been carried out. It is now heard that the British Gengzi Indemnity refund includes 120,000 gold pounds, which were originally earmarked for the completion of the Yuehan Railway. The Railway Bureau is now borrowing it from the Yuehan Railway for the purchase of materials for the Jinghu and Hangyong Railways.</p>

<p>▲Exemption for Those Who Directly Pay Special Tax to the Central Government</p>
<p>▲Retailers and Sellers of Goods Should Still Be Taxed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance responded to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Dyeing and Weaving Industries Association regarding the nature of the business tax: "Your telegram is noted. All yarn factories that are manufacturers and should pay cotton unified tax, and have already directly paid special taxes to the central government, should be exempt from business tax. Wholesalers and retailers among merchants selling goods should still be taxed to show differentiation. Your requests should not be discussed. Please take note." Seal of the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>▲Favorable Results from Petitioning in Beijing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ham Industry Association previously sent representatives to Beijing to petition for a reduction in the ham business tax. Ham merchants from various places also sent representatives to Beijing at the same time. Within a few days, a total of 24 representatives from eight places, including Jinhua, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Jiaxing, Nanjing, and Shanghai, arrived. They organized the Jiangzhe Provinces Ham Industry Representatives Petition Delegation in Beijing and began petitioning the day before yesterday (the 5th). They first went to the Ministry of Finance, where Section Chief Zhou Gangren of the Tax Division came out to meet them. Cai Xiaohe, Qi Wenwei, Xu Ruiqing, and Yu Weiqing were elected from among the representatives to speak and present their grievances. The outcome of the talks was very satisfactory. According to the Ministry of Finance, it is also aware that ham is indeed a farmer's byproduct. Although Jiangsu and Zhejiang have stipulated 15 per mille, the Ministry of Finance also knows that it should be reduced. However, the extent of the reduction has been discussed at five meetings and has not yet been determined. In any case, it will not be contrary to people's livelihood. The Ministry will convey the intention of the representatives to the minister. The delegation then went to the Ministry of Industry, where Minister Kong personally met them and promised to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for review and reduction, and encouraged the ham merchants to improve the quality of ham materials in order to develop exports. The representatives were very satisfied with Minister Kong's instructions. After leaving, they went to the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan of the National Government to petition, and were all very satisfied.</p>

<p>▲Demanding Reduction of Business Tax</p>
<p>The members of the Department Store Association held an emergency meeting, believing that the department store business tax rate set by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, reaching 10 per mille, exceeded the Ministry's outline by more than five times. They decided to send five representatives, Zheng Hairuo, Zheng Baoqing, Zhang Wei, Chen Huiqing, and Cheng Guichu, to Beijing to petition. It is learned that the five representatives left Shanghai last night at 11:00 PM and went to Beijing together.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Machinery Association Telegraphs Request to Correct Cumbersome Inspections <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance regarding the obstruction of transportation of cotton textiles, saying: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance of the National Government: The collection of the cotton yarn unified tax</p>
<p>on goods that have already been woven from cotton yarn, such as towels, socks, cloth, blankets, undershirts, and sanitary flannel shirts, etc., is not to be taxed again. This was originally the government's intention to reorganize the new tax system and eliminate the old and bad tax rules, in order to comply with the principle of one tax per item. The intention is good, and the implementation is also free from drawbacks. However, since the implementation of the new tax, there have been regulations on separate transportation. For example, the same goods that have already been taxed are transported separately from Place A to Places B and C. Place A has already been taxed, but Places B and C are again detained and the tax certificates are inspected. There are also regulations on transshipment. For example, goods that have already been taxed in Place A are transported to Place B and then transshipped to Place C in batches, and the tax certificates must be inspected repeatedly. The procedures are cumbersome and unhelpful, and only cause confusion. As a result, customs brokers have been incited to stop loading and transporting, and the reporting and transportation of woven products have been withdrawn, resulting in obstruction of commercial transportation and the stagnation of commercial goods. It is believed that the state's implementation of new taxes is originally intended to promote benefits and eliminate malpractices. The simpler and more convenient the handling procedures, the more conducive to promotion. Therefore, the collecting agencies should strictly inspect at the port of import and when leaving the factory to prevent untaxed cotton yarn textiles from being smuggled out. This method eliminates the need for cumbersome and repetitive tax certificate inspections, which cause hardship to merchants and the public, and will certainly not affect the state's tax revenue. Is this appropriate? It is requested that the Ministry investigate and quickly instruct the Customs and Unified Tax Bureaus to correct the cumbersome inspection procedures for transshipment and separate transportation in order to alleviate the suffering of the people. This is extremely urgent. [Signed] Shanghai National Goods Machinery Factories Association."</p>

<p>▲City Executive Committee Orders City Chamber of Commerce to Rectify</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Executive Committee issued an order to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "For the matter of ordering rectification: Trade associations of various industries are originally members of the Chamber of Commerce, and the Chamber of Commerce is the legal entity formed by the collective organization of various trade associations. If there are important commercial incidents or special issues related to all industries that need to be discussed, the trade associations of various industries should request the Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee to discuss them in accordance with the law. If it is deemed extremely important and it is considered necessary to convene a meeting of member representatives, it can also be requested in accordance with the law. There is no need for various industries to convene representative assemblies of trade associations on their own, which would only create discord. However, on the 4th of this month, various newspapers in this city published news that the trade associations of various industries in this city convened a representative assembly of various trade associations at the Chamber of Commerce due to the Central Government's amendment to Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the Trade Association Law. This kind of action is extremely inappropriate and should be rectified immediately. Furthermore, after investigation, the trade associations of various industries in this city have successively formed the Industry Regulations Maintenance Committee and the Business Tax Rules Research Committee, etc., which have no legal basis. If there is a need for organization or research, it can also be requested that the Chamber of Commerce handle it; otherwise, the duplication of efforts will inevitably lead to confusion and discord in the business community's opinions in the future. The Chamber of Commerce is the main body of commercial organizations in this city and is responsible for guiding the various trade associations. If any of the above-mentioned violations of laws and regulations are discovered, they must be rectified immediately. Therefore, this order instructs the Chamber to comply with it. Strictly adhere to this order."</p>

<p>▲Admirable Enthusiasm of Women in Donating Funds</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society recently had a gentleman named Wu, from Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, introduce four anonymous female benefactors from Shaanxi residing in Shanghai. Due to the severity of the disaster in Jingyang and their concern for the disaster victims in their hometown who have no food or clothing and are about to perish in ditches, each donated 2,000 silver dollars, totaling 8,000 dollars, to the Society for relief. The Society immediately added several thousand dollars to the donation and telegraphed its Chang'an branch to handle it. Now, a reply telegram has been received, stating that fair and hardworking comrades have been selected to go, and the Society has publicly appointed members Li Yunmen and Ma Jintao to carry disaster relief medicines to inspect and provide relief in Shaanxi, and to bury accumulated corpses. They will depart immediately. The women's community is so eager to do good. There is no shortage of compassionate and charitable individuals in Shanghai, and they will surely compete to contribute and rescue as many people as possible.</p>

<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Society, in view of the fact that there are often street performers in Shanghai who cruelly force children to perform arts in public and extort money, which violates humanity, sent letters to the police authorities of the Chinese and Foreign Concessions, requesting strict investigation and prohibition. After receiving a letter from Director Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, a circular was issued yesterday to various district offices, stating: "According to a letter from the Chinese Children's Welfare Society, there are street performers in the concession who use cruel methods to treat the children they use, such as having a child bend over and grab their feet with their hands, forming a circle, and the street performer then uses a wooden stick to string them up, with two people carrying them or one person standing on their abdomen, soliciting money from the audience. Such a situation is inhumane. In addition, there are acts such as climbing a mountain of knives, going through a circle of knives, and hiding in a wine jar, all kinds of suffering, which are greatly harmful to the physical condition of young children. If we do not request prohibition, it would violate humanity. The duties of this Bureau are related, and we cannot remain silent. In addition to distribution, this order instructs everyone to pay attention. If you encounter such street performers, strictly prohibit them to emphasize humanity."</p>
<h3 id="e177">Real Estate Association Re-admonishes Water Company <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲Wording of British Consulate's Reply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the British Shanghai Waterworks Company yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, we have received your reply of February 13 and are aware of its contents. In our letter of the 6th, we mentioned that your company's coercive actions are offensive and violate your country's policy of friendship with China. Your failure to refute these points indicates that you acknowledge them as undeniable facts. However, your company still insists on continuing to be wrong about the additional water fee, showing that you are unwilling to think reasonably. We are very disappointed. What we hope for is not ill-gotten wealth. Your company should not take what it should not from others, and real estate owners should not give what they should not to others. However, your company clearly knows that charging an additional water fee is an inappropriate act, but in order to maintain its continued acquisition of improper profits, it uses the excuse of custom, 4% for foreign residences, 5% for Chinese residences, and otherwise increasing the price rate. This is even more inappropriate. We believe that bad customs should be corrected immediately. Landlords collect rent and water fees on behalf of the water company, and including the water fee in the gross rent was originally for convenience of collection. If the water fee is collected directly by your company, the landlords will naturally remove the water fee. However, your company uses this simple procedure to create the bad custom of charging an additional water fee. We recall that seven years ago, your company repeatedly changed its regulations and applied them retroactively, causing landlords to have to pay tips for as long as three years. This has also become a custom. You do your best to comply with customs that benefit your company, but customs that are not beneficial to your company, you even break the law and do not apply the principle of non-retroactivity, and do not hesitate to cite the old events of 6% for Chinese residences and 5% for foreign residences. This has no relationship to the issue of charging an additional water fee, but it is enough to prove your company's past shame of unfair treatment of Chinese and foreign residences. You also said that if the rent is calculated according to the actual rent, the price rate will inevitably increase. We believe that it should increase in fact, and if it is legal and reasonable, we should accept it. However, we are unwilling to have a low name but a high reality, and we are especially unwilling to see people being forced to hand over a kind of money that they have no obligation to pay by law or reason, and being seized by violent and coercive means without claiming restitution according to law, or even continuing to pay. Your company said that the current price rate will end this year and be considered again next year. However, we are extremely unwilling to see your company continue to use violent and coercive means in these few months, intending to or actually seizing improper profits. Accordingly, we re-admonish you and hope that you will jointly abide by the law."</p>
<p>Also, the association previously sent a letter to British Consul-General Sir Brenan regarding the water issue, requesting him to stop it according to law. The association received a reply from Consul Brenan yesterday, stating: "(Above omitted) (A letter dated February 28 regarding the dispute between the Shanghai Waterworks Company and Xingping Company over the payment of water prices). According to my investigation, the clause in the contract stating 'actual rent paid without reduction' is interpreted as gross rent not only by the Waterworks Company but also by the Public Works Department. This interpretation has been in effect for more than forty years and is not without reason. It has also been tacitly approved by custom and the times. Your association's opposition seems to lack a strong basis, and I am not in a position to interfere directly. I am sorry to disappoint you. Respectfully submitted, etc."</p>

<h3 id="e179">Robbery and Killing of Victim at Baxianqiao <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲Two Robbers Enter the House</p>
<p>▲"Please Help, Boss"</p>
<p>▲Shop Owner Shouts "Robbers!"</p>
<p>▲Three Shots in Succession Cause Death</p>
<p>At around 8 o'clock yesterday morning, a robbery occurred at the Mao surname iron car clothing store located at No. 53, Maigao Baolu Road, Baxianqiao, in the French Concession. The robbers opened fire and killed the shop owner on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The shop owner has a violent nature. The owner of Mao Anji Iron Car Clothing Store (north of Baxianqiao Xiaocai Market) at No. 53, Lane Entrance, Fifth Lane, Shou'anli, Maigao Baolu Road, French Concession, is Ningbo native Mao Anhong, who is 43 years old this year. The store has been open for 18 years, but Mao has a violent nature. His wife, Tong, died ten years ago due to miscarriage and typhoid fever. Mao refused to treat her, and Tong hated him and swallowed the gold ring she wore on her ear and committed suicide, leaving behind two daughters and one son. The eldest daughter, Amao, is 18 years old this year, the son, Jinquan, is 15 years old this year, and the youngest daughter, Xiaomao, is 11 years old this year.</p>
<p>▲Expelled Mother-in-law and Children At that time, after Mao's wife died, the children were young and no one to take care of them, so his mother-in-law, Tong Shi, came to the store to help take care of the children. Three years ago, Mao had an affair with a woman surnamed Wu, also from his hometown, who is 31 years old this year, and brought her to live in the store. Mao increasingly abused his children, and his mother-in-law often argued with him. The year before last, Mao expelled his mother-in-law and children together and moved them to No. 4, Chonganli, Lafeide Road.</p>
<p>The robbers visited early in the morning. His concubine Wu gave birth to a girl last month. Mao is very fond of Wu. At nearly 8 o'clock yesterday morning, the store door had just opened, and apprentice Ma Gen (18 years old) was working at the counter. Mao had not yet gotten up. Wu got up, emptied the chamber pot, and returned to the room. While sitting on the chamber pot urinating, two robbers dressed in long gowns and speaking in Ningbo dialect suddenly came into the store and pushed the apprentice into Mao's bedroom (in the back of the store), forbidding him to make a sound. The robbers then said, "Please help, boss."</p>
<p>▲The victim was killed on the spot. After saying that, one robber immediately acted, first taking off a gold bracelet and a gold ring from Wu's hand (the bracelet weighed about five qian and the ring weighed about three qian), and a gold ring from Mao's hand (weighing about two qian), and wanted to escape with the loot. At that time, Mao was still lying in bed and shouted "Robbers!" The robbers immediately turned back and fired a gun at Mao, and two shots rang out. The bullets hit Mao's right rib cage and penetrated his thigh. Mao still got up with injuries, intending to pursue them. The robbers fled to the door of the store and turned back and fired another shot, hitting Mao in the throat, and he immediately fell to the ground and died.</p>
<p>▲Both Robbers Fled. The robbers immediately fled outwards, escaping northwards from Hongyunfang Lane behind the Nanjing Grand Theater towards the west and disappeared without a trace. Later, the Songshan Road Police Station in charge of the area was informed and immediately ordered detectives to investigate. At the same time, Mao's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuantang autopsy office. Zhu, the judge of the French Court, was reported by the criminal section of the General Patrol Station and arrived at the office at noon to verify the body. He sat in the public seat after clarifying the body, and the detective reported the details of the case first.</p>
<p>▲The Main Wife Narrated the Case. According to the description of his wife Wu, her husband was shot and killed by robbers. Judge Zhu instructed that the body of Mao Anhong, who had died, was indeed shot and killed by robbers while he was alive. After taking pictures, the wife was allowed to prepare a coffin and collect the body, and the police station was ordered to strictly arrest the robbers and bring them to justice. According to the wife, one robber was wearing a woolen camel hair robe and a flower satin mandarin jacket, with a melon-skin small hat with a red knot on his head, who was the one who fired the gun, and the clothes of the robber who committed the robbery were not clearly seen. Now the family of the deceased is allowed to collect the body this morning.</p>

<p>▲To Avoid a Bicycle...Caused the Accident</p>
<p>▲Unable to Enter the Door...Breaks Through the Wall</p>
<p>▲Western Woman Sitting in the Bus...Injured</p>
<p>At around 2 pm yesterday, a No. 15058, Route 9 public bus traveling between Yangshupu and Daxilu Road, when passing the intersection of Fuxu Road and Hadong Road, turned the rudder to the side to give way to a bicycle, but it was too late to brake, and drove onto the sidewalk. Because the wheels were out of control, it continued to move forward after going up the stairs, causing the front of the bus to crash into the reception room of the Tang family at No. 602. Fortunately, except for an old woman in the room, there were no others, and the place where the old woman was sitting was far away from the window and did not meet the front of the bus, so she was not harmed. At that time, the public bus was traveling from east to west, and the bicycle seemed to come out of Hadong Road and wanted to turn into Fuxu Road to the west, which caused the public bus to give way and caused this disaster. No. 602 is a three-story house at the bottom of Minhoulida Street near the street. When the No. 15058 public bus crashed into the wall, its position was very close to the door. Although the driver was anxious to brake, it was too late, causing the front of the bus to drill straight into the window. However, the window was too small to accommodate this behemoth, so the walls around it loosened and fell, until a huge hole appeared in the wall, and the front of the bus fell into the house. Except for a western woman, the passengers on the bus were fortunately unharmed. The western woman, named Lv Fuqiti, seemed to be of Russian origin, and was sent to Hongen Hospital on Daxilu Road for treatment. It was generally fine, but the tables, chairs, magnetic bottles and decorations in the reception room of No. 602 had all become powder.</p>

<p>▲Li Sigong and Li Zhengtang are Involved</p>
<p>▲The Chauffeur Zhu Heqing Took the Initiative</p>
<p>▲Zhu Chengzhang was Hidden on Lafeide Road</p>
<p>▲There are About Thirty Witnesses in This Case</p>
<p>The Lu Shaotang kidnapping case, the captured bandits, has been thoroughly investigated by the Special District Local Court, and sentences were passed separately the day before yesterday, which was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. However, two people who were declared innocent, Li Sigong (also known as Qian Deji and Qian Baijin) from Chuansha and Li Zhengtang (also known as Chen Kuisan) from Anhui, were found by the police station to be related to the case of the kidnapping and killing of Zhu Chengzhang, the manager of the Guohuo Bank from Anhui, and were still detained. According to the case of Zhu's kidnapping, it happened on the morning of December 23 last year. Zhu was a Christian. At 9:50 that morning, he took his daughter Runzhu and two male and female servants in his own No. 1430 car to the city to</p>

<p>When boarding the car at the entrance of No. 189, Yuyuan Road where he lived, before driving fifty yards, he was intercepted by several bandits. One bandit fired several shots at Zhu's car, and the chauffeur Li Lisheng died from the bullets. Zhu</p>

<p>Zhu was taken out and driven away in a bandit car at full speed. At noon, the bandits abandoned Zhu in the wild. Zhu hired a rickshaw to return to his residence, and then went to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died a few days later. The police station has learned that the two Li</p>
<h3 id="e184">Both are Major Criminals in the Zhu Case. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Special <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Court to file a lawsuit. The two Li also hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend them. After Judge Ge Zhitan opened the court, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that there were about thirty witnesses in this case, which could not be completed in a short time. Please start with the detective</p>

<p>Jian and Detective Feng Zhiming stated that Li Zhengtang was arrested at the China Hotel on Guizhou Road, and Li Sigong was suddenly arrested in a brothel at No. 648, Minqingli, Zhejiang Road. After the Inspector Yao Ke translated, the day after the Zhu case occurred, someone saw Li Sigong move from No. 1231, Lafeide Road to No. 346, Duofuli, Tongfu Road. When Zhu was in the hospital, he told a friend who came to comfort him in English that he was kidnapped</p>

<p>The police station went to Lafeide Road to investigate and saw that there were only two buildings similar to what Zhu said, No. 1231 and No. 1233, and Li Sigong moved from No. 1231, so Zhu was hidden in that house undoubtedly. However, according to Li Sigong's testimony in the police station, the Zhu case</p>

The police lawyer continued that when Zhu was kidnapped, passers-by included two western children and rickshaw driver Xu Jingui, vendor Lu Ada, etc., who all witnessed it and would be summoned to testify on the case in the future.

<p>▲ Mayor Zhang Intervenes to Mediate</p>
<p>Following a martial clash between Chinese tram workers and naval aviation artisans, the #4 and #1 tram lines remained halted at the South Railway Station as of 4 PM yesterday and had not yet resumed service. However, all parties desired to prevent the escalation of the disturbance. Therefore, throughout yesterday, discussions and mediation were conducted by various parties, and progress was made. Traffic on the Gaochang Temple section resumed at 8 PM last night. The details of yesterday's mediation are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Tram Workers Petition the Tram Workers' Union</p>
<p>At 9 AM yesterday, permanent members Zhu Hanhe, Xu Yusheng, and Jia Renjie were dispatched to the Municipal Government to request an audience with Mayor Zhang. They were met by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, to whom the representatives conveyed three requests for the Mayor's consideration: 1. Guarantees against future incidents. 2. Punishment of the main perpetrators. 3. Joint issuance of a proclamation by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau. Secretary-General Yu promised to relay the requests and stated that the proclamation by the two bureaus would be issued and enforced. However, the representatives also acknowledged that tram service must resume immediately upon the proclamation's issuance. They then departed, awaiting a resolution.</p>
<p>▲ Mayor Zhang and Others Mediate in the Afternoon. Mayor Zhang Qun specifically summoned Tram Company Manager Lu Bohong, Traffic Director Zhu Shaoqi, Public Utilities Bureau Director Huang Boqiao, and Police Chief Wang Zijing of the Second District to the Municipal Government to discuss solutions. As a result, a decision was made that Mayor Zhang would be responsible for providing guarantees, the company would be represented by Lu Bohong, and the workers would be temporarily guaranteed by the labor union.</p>
<p>▲ Traffic Restored Last Night at 7:30 PM</p>
<p>▲ Police Bureau Chief Chen dispatched two platoons of the Security Team's motorcycle corps, totaling 100 officers, led by Captain Jiang, to the Tram Company. Two police officers were assigned to each tram on the #1 and #4 lines to provide protection. Simultaneously, Police Chief Wang Zijing of the Second District and Inspector Niu led several senior police officers with 100 copies of the proclamation to the company to post at Gaochang Temple and on various trams. Consequently, tram service in the Gaochang Temple area resumed at 8:30 PM last night.</p>
<p>▲ Proclamation of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau: Proclamation Regarding the Matter of a Proclamation. According to a report from Wang Zijing, Police Chief of the Second District, on the 1st of this month, ticket sellers on the #1 and #4 tram lines of the China General Edison Company had an altercation with workers from the Naval Aircraft Depot over ticket purchases, which resulted in a mass brawl. As a result, the drivers and ticket sellers feared further danger and temporarily suspended tram service from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Station to Gaochang Temple. In light of this, public transportation is of utmost importance. This Bureau has the responsibility to maintain local order. It is not appropriate to allow arbitrary changes to tram routes. The company's employees must be fully protected to facilitate transportation. In addition to ordering the company to quickly restore the original tram routes, the Second District is ordered to increase the number of police and work with the military to provide strict protection. This proclamation is to be widely publicized. If any further instances of mob disturbances are discovered, those involved will be immediately arrested and severely punished. This is imperative. March 6th, Republic of China Year 20, Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng.</p>

<p>▲ Left Behind by the Aviation Team</p>
<p>▲ Unexpected Disaster Yesterday</p>
<p>The Lu Family Garden, located west of Longhua Town on the south side of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, had been the site of the First Naval, Army, and Air Force Seaplane Team during the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic. When the team was ordered to depart last autumn, they left behind a white iron-cased hand grenade in the main room of the garden. At approximately 7:30 AM yesterday, Zhou Jintu (from Suzhou), the garden's caretaker, his wife, Zhou Zhu, his friend Liu Xiaofu, and Zhou's eight-year-old daughter, Gendi, were having breakfast at the same table when, for unknown reasons, the grenade suddenly exploded. Zhou and Liu were both injured in the head, face, hands, and feet, resulting in a bloody mess. Zhou's wife, Zhu, and daughter, Gendi, sustained slightly lighter injuries. Zhao Lianshan, a police officer from the Sixth Station of the local sub-bureau, rushed to the scene upon hearing the explosion. He quickly transported the four injured men and women to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. He also recovered a blank iron grenade casing in front of the main room and took it back to the station to be submitted to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Shanghai West Residents Express Opinions on House Tax Issue <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>▲ Unwilling to Bear Double Taxation</p>
<p>▲ Hoping for a Fundamental Solution</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau will implement the collection of house taxes from businesses and residences along the newly built roads, such as Roberts Road, Caoxi Road, Jessfield Road, and Zhoujiaqiao in Shanghai West. This has been reported in this newspaper. The recent sentiments regarding this issue from various parties are explored below:</p>
<p>▲ Residents' Expression. Since the Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice and dispatched personnel to investigate rents in various districts such as Caoxi Road in Shanghai West, public sentiment has been anxious. Many merchants and residents believe that they pay quarterly dues to the Municipal Council solely due to business needs and usage of the Municipal Council's water, electricity, and telephone services. Residents who do not use these utilities generally do not pay quarterly dues. The reason why businesses pay quarterly dues is quite clear. Moreover, at a time when prices are high and business is slow, it is unbearable to bear double taxation. Therefore, De Da Clothing Store and other businesses have jointly sent a letter to the Third District branch of the Citizens' Federation, requesting them to discuss solutions immediately. Upon receiving the letter, the branch held an emergency meeting the night before and decided to first write to the Municipal General Assembly, requesting them to convey the grievances of merchants and residents to the Municipal Government. They must thoroughly resolve the issue fundamentally before collecting taxes.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Council Attention. Since the Municipal Finance Bureau issued the notice, the Municipal Council has also paid close attention to this issue. In recent days, the Municipal Council has dispatched several Chinese detectives to areas such as Connaught Road to inquire about the opinions of businesses and residents regarding the Municipal Finance Bureau's upcoming tax collection. It is understood that most merchants and residents have not expressed any opinion and are mostly vague, believing that the area of Shanghai West is vast and that a decision should ultimately be made based on the opinion of the majority.</p>

<p>▲ Sent from Sichuan to Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ Noticed by the Postal Bureau</p>
<p>▲ Detectives and Postal Workers Together</p>
<p>▲ Recipient Detained and Convicted</p>
<p>The General Post Office received a confidential letter from the Sichuan Post Office the day before, stating that a roll of newspaper sent from that office, addressed to Qian Hengjiu and Zhang Shenzhi at No. 838 Mei Bai Ge Road, Shanghai, should be carefully watched. At 3 PM the day before, this bundle of newspapers arrived. The postmaster immediately notified Detective Ma Xiaozhi of the Hongkou Police Station to deliver the item to the address with a postal worker. The recipient was a person resembling a rickshaw puller. When asked about the name Qian Hengjiu, the rickshaw puller initially did not respond. After taking the newspaper upstairs, he said that Qian had already received it. Detective Ma immediately went upstairs, where the package had already been opened. Two doses of morphine were found inside. There were only a man and a woman in the room. The man's name was Qian Hua, from Sichuan, and the woman was his wife. Detective Ma immediately took Qian and the morphine back to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation by Judge Feng. However, the defendant's statements were evasive. The judge, based on conclusive evidence, sentenced him to one year and two months of imprisonment, fined him 300 yuan, and confiscated the morphine.</p>

<p>▲ Files for Divorce</p>
<p>▲ Jurisdiction Still in Question</p>
<p>Huang Ruifen, a young woman from Huaiyang, is 23 years old and has a beautiful appearance, resembling a modern female student. However, she is married to a rickshaw driver. Living in this arrangement, she inevitably feels like a bright phoenix coupled with a crow. Although they have been married for five years, their love has faded, and they are estranged. A few months ago, Gong, a student at a certain school, who lived with them on Roberts Road, caught her eye. She gave him a photo of herself, which Gong cherished and kept in his bedroom. It was accidentally seen by Huang's husband, Li Guisheng, who accused his wife of infidelity. He negotiated with Gong, demanding 2,000 yuan, or else he would find another way to deal with it. Gong, unable to satisfy his demands, moved elsewhere to avoid him. Li also moved to the jurisdiction of the Sixth District of Connaught Road because his reputation was at stake. However, Huang Ruifen separated from Li and hired a lawyer to file for divorce in the Local Court. Li also reported Huang and Gong to the Procuratorate of the Shanghai Local Court for seduction. After the prosecutor opened the case and investigated, he determined that the evidence was insufficient and dismissed the case. Yesterday morning, the court opened the divorce case. The defendant hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Xu questioned Huang Ruifen, who stated that she currently resided at the Patriotic Girls' School, while Li claimed that he lived in the Chinese area. Judge Xu stated that the jurisdiction of the case was still in dispute and it was not appropriate to proceed. He adjourned the case temporarily, pending clarification of the defendant's address. If it was indeed within the Chinese area, the case would be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for acceptance. He also instructed both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court.</p>

<p>▲ Request Submitted to the National Government to Order National Observance</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association is currently focused on social education, aiming to evoke social sympathy and create a strong public opinion in favor of child welfare. Therefore, at the Executive Committee meeting last month, it was proposed to promote the celebration of Children's Day, stating that children are the future masters of the country and the center of cultural transition. All countries, East and West, pay attention to children's welfare, including various facilities and the name of Children's Day. Domestic institutions give speeches on various methods related to children and seek noble entertainment for children on this day. The child welfare cause in our country is still in its early stages. If there is no extremely important expression and extremely broad publicity movement, it will not be enough to attract the attention of social figures, and Children's Day should be held to promote publicity. However, the climate of each country is different, and the date of Children's Day also varies. The United States holds it on the second Sunday of June and also designates the second Sunday of December as the Happiness Day for Poor Children. Japan designates March 3rd as Girls' Day and May 5th as Boys' Day. It is now designated that April 4th is Children's Day, named "April 4th", and it will correspond to the ancient "March 3rd," "May 5th," "July 7th," and "September 9th" and the current "October 10th" National Day festivals, with the names shining together without conflict. In the spring, the climate in both the north and south should be warm, and it is close to Arbor Day, which is in line with the national plan to plant trees and cultivate people. As a result of the discussions, it was fully approved, and a request was submitted to the competent authorities for approval and forwarded to the National Government to order the observance nationwide. A Children's Day Preparatory Committee was also organized to prepare for the celebration. In the blink of an eye, April 4th is approaching. At that time, the Association will surely have a grand event. We will record it here to see what happens later.</p>

<p>At the Asia Literary Society at No. 5 Museum Road in this city, Dr. Bingzhi, a former professor at National Southeast University, was invited to lecture on the natural history of the capital at 4 PM the day before. Dr. Paul Boutwell, chairman of the society, gave a welcoming speech. Dr. Bingzhi gave a very detailed account of the investigation and analysis of the animals and plants in the capital and its neighboring areas. The Chinese and foreign people who came to listen to the lecture were deeply interested. According to Dr. Bingzhi's report, animals such as tigers, wolves, wild boars, and northern deer occasionally appear in the mountains outside the capital city. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are rich in tropical amphibians and other animals.</p>

<p>▲ Hoping to Spread the Universal Sentiment of the Chinese Toward Concessions The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a tea party at 5 PM the day before to bid farewell to Colonel Commandant E.B. Macnaghten of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps on his return home. Guests included Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Macnaghten, Director Brown, Liu Hongzhong, Yuan Ludeng, Director-General Fessenden, Wang Xiaolai, Zheng Chengqing, Hu Yunqiu, and Xu Tonghao. Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting. During the meeting, Wang delivered a farewell speech, as follows: Colonel Commandant Macnaghten of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, having served for a long time, is tired of traveling and is returning home. He will soon leave Shanghai. The Chamber, as a local organization, dares to follow the ancient custom of offering parting words, representing the merchants and residents of the city, to express sincere gratitude to the Colonel Commandant. The Shanghai Concession has always been known as a place where people from all five directions live together. People are not uniform. In recent years, commerce has increased many times over, and it has become coveted by bandits. Therefore, the Municipal Council, under these circumstances, suffers from the shortage of police resources. On the one hand, due to the unreasonable regulations from the past, Chinese military and police forces cannot cooperate in sharing the responsibility for maintaining law and order in the Concession. As a last resort, only merchants can unite to defend themselves. Therefore, the organization of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps can be considered a suitable organization for the current Concession system. The Colonel Commandant has served until now, and there are two points that deserve our praise: (1) He is proficient in military affairs and has fulfilled the mission he was assigned. (2) He understands the history of the Chinese militia for many years and its local relationships, and he has given it considerable trust and guidance. However, because of the various complex situations mentioned above in the Shanghai Concession, it is difficult to eradicate bandits, even if the parties concerned do their best. The Colonel Commandant has served in Shanghai for many years, and he must have a deep sense of this feeling. The reason for the difficulty stems from the special organization of the Concession. Therefore, the attitude that your government took toward the Hankou Concession four years ago was the wisest policy, which is also the same psychology that our people have. The Colonel Commandant is returning home this time, and we hope that he will spread the universal sentiment of the Chinese people to your government and people, so that your country's trade with China, especially with Shanghai, will have even more new and improved opportunities. The Chamber presents a small token to express our gratitude and hope, not to make a grand farewell, but as a memento.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company submitted a document to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities yesterday, stating that, due to the loose roadbed and dangerous driving, the ticket sales hours had been reduced. It has already been reported to your bureau and approved by order No. 1205. Now, due to continuous light rain, the damaged roadbed has been further eroded, and driving is more difficult than before. However, in order to maintain service as much as possible, it is proposed to sell tickets from 7 AM to 12 PM every day starting from March 7th, and to stop selling tickets in the afternoon, only transporting the passengers who have already purchased tickets in the morning. After the weather clears and the road is repaired, normal traffic will resume. In addition to sending personnel to the Fourth Section of your bureau to explain the difficulties, another official document is submitted, requesting your bureau to review and record the case.</p>

At 3:25 PM yesterday, while traveling on Zhizaoju Road at the intersection of Kangqu Road, in front of the Hubei Guild Hall, a car suddenly approached head-on. Du immediately braked and swerved to the left to avoid it. Due to the uneven road, the bus tilted to the left and fell to the ground. Eight passengers, including Ma Jinbiao, Sun Tao, Liang Seng, Yang Tuming, Li Shimian, Wang Yiming, Liang Rulin, and Yang Tingfang, were injured by broken glass. Upon learning of the incident, the company quickly sent the injured and the bus to the Southeast Hospital for treatment. As the injuries were not serious, they were bandaged and released from the hospital. However, Xia Xianyi, the ticket inspector No. 16, sustained slightly more serious injuries and was temporarily kept in the hospital for treatment. The driver, Du Xuedao, sent a letter to the Second District Headquarters of the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation and submitted a detailed report of the accident to the Municipal Police Bureau for review.</p>

<p>Wang Xinging, Du Yansheng, Liu Suizhi, and three other police officers from the Second Precinct of the Shenxiangge Police Station of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, while patrolling Wangyi Ma Lane, caught sight of a young man who seemed flustered. When he saw the police, he tried to flee. The three bravely chased him. Unexpectedly, the young man turned around and pulled out a gun to fire, but a bullet was lodged in the chamber, so it did not fire. He was eventually apprehended, and the gun was seized.

<h3 id="e208">Cotton Yarn Tax Certificates Regularly Exchanged for Fabric Shipping Permits <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>▲ Implemented on the 9th of this month</p>
<p>Dyed fabrics that have paid the unified cotton yarn tax must be transported and exported tax-free with a shipping permit exchanged for a cotton yarn tax certificate, as reported. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired about the implementation date and visited Zhu Wenqi, chairman of the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association. According to him, it has been agreed with the Unified Tax Bureau to implement it next Monday (9th). However, the method is slightly different from the original agreement. When dyeing and weaving factories transport yarn into the factory, they should first exchange the cotton yarn tax certificate for an entry permit. When the finished dyed fabrics are transported and exported, they should then exchange the entry permit for a shipping permit, which is used to declare customs for tax-free export. However, before the entry permit exchange is implemented, the shipping permit will be temporarily exchanged for a cotton yarn tax certificate. The procedures and location for exchanging the shipping permit will still be handled by the Unified Tax Bureau's personnel at the Silk Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association, as originally agreed.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Chamber of Commerce Responds Regarding the Habit of Delayed Orders <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Special District Local Court, stating: "Greetings, Upon receiving your letter, regarding the handling of order disputes, Party B claims that completing customs duties after the goods arrive is considered a form of negotiating delay, commonly known as 'playing the quarrel,' while Party A denies this custom. With conflicting accounts, you requested clarification. Upon investigation, according to common practice, orders and deliveries are processed according to the order specifications. The specifications of each trade generally follow the standard order form filed with the British Chamber of Commerce. This dispute is clearly addressed in Articles 2 and 8 of the standard order form, and by referring to both, the matter can be easily resolved. Furthermore, regarding the payment of taxes, Article 3 of the standard order form stipulates that it is the buyer's responsibility, and therefore, in practice, taxes must be paid upon arrival of the goods, and this cannot be used as a basis for refusing to negotiate. Also, the term 'playing the quarrel' is a common term in the business community for general disputes and does not specifically refer to tax payments. On the 26th of last month, at our Chamber's 33rd regular meeting, this investigation report was thoroughly discussed, and it was resolved to attach a copy of the Chamber of Commerce's standard order form and send a factual reply. Accordingly, a copy of the form is enclosed for your reference."</p>
<h3 id="e210">Stamp Duty Should be Affixed When Collecting Land Practice Certificates <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>▲Notice from the Stamp Tax Bureau</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Real Estate Stamp Tax Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Notice is hereby given that, according to the stamp tax regulations, a stamp duty should be affixed to land title deeds for all properties in the Shanghai urban area, as clearly stipulated. Now that the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau has completed the measurement and announced the results by district, land deeds will be submitted for verification and exchanged for land practice certificates. This is an important document for property ownership and has the same effect as a land deed. All those who have received a land practice certificate should affix a stamp immediately in accordance with the regulations to make it a legal certificate and ensure the protection of property rights. We are concerned that the public may not be fully aware of this, so this notice is issued for clarification. It is important to know that the land practice certificate is crucial to the rights of property owners, and the stamp duty is very low. If you neglect to pay attention or evade taxes and fail to affix the stamp as required, the authorities will not provide protection in the event of future land disputes or lawsuits, which may damage property rights. Property owners are urged to come to this bureau to purchase and affix stamps as soon as they receive their land practice certificates, in order to comply with the law and protect their rights. The bureau has a summary of the regulations on stamp duty application, which can be provided for on-site viewing. Please comply accordingly and do not make mistakes. This notice is hereby issued. March of the 20th year of the Republic of China, Director Song Jiju, Bureau Address: No. 8, Xiansheng Lane, Zhonghua Road, Xiaoximen."</p>

<p>The seabed of the Yangtze River downstream from Wusong to Nantong is heavily silted and undergoes drastic changes. In order to facilitate navigation, the Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of the Navy constantly sends ships to survey and produce a new type of map, with the English name (correctnhlan), for reference by the Ministry of the Navy, shipping authorities, and merchant ships. In the past, the Customs authorities produced a type of blueprint, but it lacked longitude and latitude lines and was not very accurate. Since the bureau adopted the proposal of the International Hydrographic Bureau that only one organization can survey and publish nautical charts, and after taking back the authority to do so, all hydrographic charts produced by the bureau have been exceptionally clear.</p>
