<p>中國船同盟合作</p>
<p>長江上遊川河航業、本年夏初、滬上英日美各外商、曾計謀壟斷、而擬將華商各輪公司打倒、當時乃將主要貨之棉紗水脚、自十二兩跌至六兩、引起六華輪公司之恐慌、當時宜昌航務局長、曾來滬與各輪公司磋商挽救之策、乃組織商運公會以謀抵制、但不久爲外商加入、計劃失敗、而各外輪更將運費跌至四兩、此事曾歷誌本報、及抵制事起、形勢稍變、上游外商之壟斷毒計、業被華輪合力打破、亟將此事詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>▲抵制跌價川河重慶一綫、自英日美各洋商加入商運會議以後、將運紗水脚、自六兩跌至四兩、復自四兩再减實收三兩、其他各貨、亦復如是、川河六華輪局、至是十分恐慌、遂經各公司公同會議、除將中上段航綫延長直放上海外、對於運費亦實行跌減、自重慶來滬、每件雜貨祗收水脚銀八錢、忍痛與競、以維航權▲公同攤派六華輪公司以外商勢大資厚、非合羣難與久抗、由是公决、組一同盟會、不准外人加入、由六公司合議制、訂一維護川河華輪營業之公約、其主點在六家、此後營業、取互助與公攤之辦法、如一家有損、則五家合補之、庶使團集力量、支持久遠當曾訂約十一條名曰（大打官）公約蓋其意則取營業打公司之旨也、</p>
<p>▲日輪無貨自上月抵制事起、外輪之在上游者、日本船首先受抵制之影響、查川河日輪共有六艘、上自溆瀘、下逮宜沙、最爲國輪勁敵、在八月十八日宜渝各埠、議定拒運日船、並不收日貨後、上江日輪、至今已無貨可裝、而予國輪一絕大之生機也、宜渝一綫、華輪營業已漸見活躍矣、上海直放輪之去貨、亦甚起色</p>
<p>▲英船改幟川河上游之溆瀘各埠太古公司之營業極大、特造淺水輪四艘、專航此綫、近自川中各業團對外旗商輪、禁止行駛非通商口岸之川河内港後、英輪所受打擊甚大、太古公司爲補救此事起見、特由該公司將萬縣·萬通·萬流·秀山·及綏定·五輪·計三千七百噸、劃出英商太古公司之外、另組織一管理機關、仍用太古名義、惟表面上則歸華商經營、而將此五船改用中國旂幟矣、</p>
<p>▲華輪缺班近日自水災發生、中國船多應　救難民上游、華輪亦受影響、此但一時之現象、不久即可以恢復原狀也、在此華輪缺班時期、英美各輪之上江營業、又稍起色但壟斷之謀、則已爲六公司打破矣、</p>

<p>誰都不知申報是吾國報紙的老前輩、歷來持論的態度、亦如老年人一般的頂穩穩健健、絕無半些火氣、近來貴報時評怱然呈返老爲童的現象、這位六旬老人、精神較前矍鑠多了、頭腦也新頴多了、誰說申報老了呢、他的前途、正不可限量啊、這是我最近讀貴報後的感想、</p>
<p>今日是、貴報六十週年誕辰、發表有六十週年幻紀念宣言、洋洋洒洒、樹立今後努力之目標、所列各點、與我國家我民族、確有絕大的關係、我希望貴報努力實踐、邁步向着偉大的前程、幹幹幹、此外、今日貴報上有一個令讀者可喜可慶的消息、——讀者通信廣告、給讀者解决自己不易解决的問題、這眞爲青年方便不少、</p>
<p>我現在謹提出一個問題、特以誠意、希請先生賜答、</p>
<p>（一）據今日貴報紀念宣言、所提研究自然科學、自是必要的了、但不知除自然科學外、社會科學是不是應該研究、或者必須研究、</p>
<p>（二）如果（應該）而且（必須）那末從那一科着手、應先讀一些什麽書、應如何讀、</p>
<p>（覆）社會需要、是多方面的、人們天性天才所接近、是各各不同的、本報宣言願介紹研究科學、祇應過去的我國社會、對自然科學似乎太不注意、認爲有特别提倡之必要、至於自然科學以外、各科學當然也是應該研究而且必須研究的、</p>
<p>說到社會科學呢、範圍很廣、單說大學罷、試看他的課程、關於社會科學的課目、不知多多少少、君儘可一方體察社會需要、一方體察自己天性和天才、愼重挑選、一步一步研究上去、如果本在學校修學的、就該很誠意地向本級敎師、請求指導、</p>

<p>胡適整理國故,最有見地；他所著的中國哲學史大綱雖然只成三分之一，已是不朽之傑作。但他所撰時論，多不中肯要。去年他在新月發表一文，我們走那條路，裏面陳說中國五個鬼即貧窮，疾病，愚昧，貪污，擾亂，而對於帝國主義之侵略，竟武斷的將它一筆勾消。梁漱溟曾寫了一封信駁他。東京的幾位朋友對於他這種見解也深致不滿。我個人則以爲除了外國帝國主義之外，國内還有一個大妖精被適之忽略了。這個大妖精便是多福多壽多男子的多生主義。因爲多生所以田不夠種，工不夠做，飯不夠吃。因爲多生所以窮；因爲窮所以有病不能醫，有子女不能敎。因爲大家多生所以窮親戚多，窮朋友多，累得意志薄弱的人不得不貪。因爲多生而求生不得所以爲盜，爲匪，稱兵，搆亂。貧窮，愚昧，疾病貪污，内亂，當然是要打倒的，但是國内若不剷除多生之迷信，國外若不推翻帝國主義，則這五個小鬼必定是跟着我們寸步不離。其實，帝國主義之總司令也是多生主義因爲多生所以要殖民地，要原料，要市塲。世界最大之亂源便是多生主義。這個妖怪不除，世界那能太平，中國那會有出路。下面是我送適之的一首詩：</p>

<p>— 高晦齋</p>
<p>姬朱氏。小字蘭馥紹興人。祖某曾舉孝廉。父茂才。服務金華某署。姬長於金華畢業高小學校。乙丑年年十六。父死。貧無以殮。母復病劇。醫藥乏資。索債盈門。不得已。鬻姬於蘭谿江山船。姬以墮落風塵。實非所願。投江自殺。時三弟果齋。司榷蘭谿。令巡船拯之起。詢以顚末。姬曰。爲妾媵所不辭。若賣笑。則誓死弗爲也。三弟悲其遇。貸其值。留養局中。丙午春余作嚴灘游。姬一見心傾。納爲小星。隨歸北平。余家寒素無僕媪。一切烹紉。咸姬任之。料理米鹽。井井有條理。暇時敎以詩歌。頗能得門徑。石刹海夜納凉有句云。湖平風乍定。樹密月疑遲。余易以風欲定。月偏遲。一時頗爲傳誦。詩雖不佳。得之初學。頗不易易。余嘗偕其觀名伶某演覇王别姬。念白宁蘿村誤宁爲丁。姬笑不可仰顧謂余曰。今而後始知名伶徒負虚名。固胸中無點墨也。其頴慧如此。性柔婉。與家人相處五年。無不親善。遇其父母忌日。必請於余。私祭如禮。篤於天倫。不失舊家風範。去春余妻以女兒姻事。與余反目。有㚥人陳某胡某從中敎唆。涉訟法庭。以世篤禮敎。舊家庭遭此奇變。余愁腸百結無生人樂趣。姬多方慰解。冬季于君右任電召余南來。姬已病。余躊躇莫决。姬促速行。藉以排遣。力疾爲余製棉布襪。以禦長途之寒。余抵寗方一月。迭接家信謂姬病日重。姬尙來函。謂可望勿藥。病愈即南下。蓋恐增前。面龐豐腴。詢其病。笑而不答。驚而寤。出視天空。昏暗無光。時方月蝕也。次晨得平電。姬已於先一夕子時逝世。夢中一現。笑而不答。魂或有知。不願傷余之心耶。嗚呼慘矣。余輓以聨云。三千里遠隔新都。詎意生離。竟成死别。廿二年遽辭濁世。卿誠薄命。天太無情。聊誌悼耳。姬生於庚戍年七月十四日本時。年二十二歲。葬北平西直門外萬壽寺南三虎橋。嗚呼。余愧無東坡之才華。姬實具朝雲之賢淑。烏得無一言以表彰之。聊慰幽魂於地下歟。</p>

<p>▲世界最大的佛像　日本人向來崇拜我佛如來。雖然他們的行爲。恰與佛旨相反。據英國方面傳說。東京附近不久即將建立一個世界最大的佛像。計高四十英尺。全川混合土造成。異常堅固。需費一萬金鎊。佛的前裾展開着。地位極大。足可容三千人立在上面。</p>
<p>▲飛行千里的蝴蝶　英國夏間。常能看見一種大白蝴蝶。名呌（菜白）Cabbage　White它們的產地是在波羅的海。Bartic島中。一時可生數百萬。糧食一缺。就成羣結隊。飛往歐洲各地。有時可以看見它們飛過德國。滿空雪白。有如下大雪一般。英國又有一種蝴蝶。呌做（粉娘）Painted　Lady的。本來產於非洲中部。有時數千百萬飛過撒哈拉沙漠。在北非小作勾留。然後繼續北飛。直逹英倫三島。這種蝴蝶。也可算是長途飛行家了。</p>

<p>雲川爲產藥最佳之區。其所產藥品。異於常地。獨得地氣之英精。效用宏大。如茯苓金耳參三七鷄血籐鹿𠼫草等。皆滇中著名之良藥。曩歲。有滇省軍事代表李修家氏。自滇來京。過海上。以誼屬近戚。贈予以雲茯苓一。重七十二兩。參三七兩匣。金耳數斤。白藥二瓶。茯苓參三七金耳。爲滇中之天然特產。而白藥則由於配合。其功用專治跌打損傷。斷骨接骱等症。雖受槍彈洞穿肌膚。或且損毁筋骨。服之無不立愈。一名爲百寳丹。製者爲一老人。年以古稀。老人以外。無能製者。其傳此法。由於滇省苗子。蓋滇省遠處西南。四圍崇山峻嶺。苗蠻之屬。蟄居於山洞中者甚衆。苗性殘酷。喜械鬥。動輒以白刃相享。受傷者無醫士。即吞此白藥。無不奏效如神。老人即得之於苗子所傳。有請授此秘法者。皆遭屏絕。謂予不識字。方能配合此藥。識字者頭腦已壞。不能製也。或請傳於其子。則謂冥頑不靈。不能也。以此除老人外。無一能製。滇省軍隊。以善戰名。愛傷之後。即吞此白藥。其藥品之配合。老人亦秘不示人。曾有日本之化學家。欲知其成分。多方化騐。卒不可得。會陸澹庵君游滇。聞白藥名。乃與老人約。以名譽擔保。不令奸商朦混。老人方允諾。以陸君爲江蘇全省之代售者。陸君歸時。已帶有數百瓶。今聞老人又續寄千瓶。以便應付云。</p>

<p>耷旣以末路王孫隱於道流。乃號德朗。良月者。朗之化名也。其意以爲明亡。帝統以絕。藐諸孑遺。已不復見日。而江山無限。感懷故國。只許回首月明中耳。故又號薄雲子。冀雲薄而易見月之明也。與其弟之號破雲子者。皆深寓眷懐故國之忱。耷本姓朱。又與其弟俱諱之。而各取其半以爲號。一取八。曰八大山人。一取牛。曰牛石慧。每書必草作八大山人爲哭之笑之。牛石慧爲生不拜君。哭之云者。悼宗社之已屋也。笑之云者。譏自身之未亡也。生不拜君者。誓終其身不食周粟也。馬師原姓上官氏。明之武臣。不知何故易姓馬。與山人兄弟同來。或云山人兄弟之來此。馬實爲介云。言已。導觀香火堂。所以奉祀列世故道師者。龕中栗主累累。間有雕像。其首即良月師主。次破雲子。次馬。花果雜陳。香烟繚繞滿室。不覺肅然生敬。慨然有餘憾焉。當明之亡其臣民之勤王謀復者。踵起。雖無一得意。而各葆其志氣於江湖會黨間。以冀一逞。垂數百年到今。獨得藉其潛力爲民族革命具。諸師之來此。即易觀曰圃。其志倘不僅在道。以清靜自足。薄雲破雲。固無時不望日月之重明也。然卒以道流終。受奉祀爲此中祖師。舉目河山。眞不知其哭笑之無從矣。而山人乃復發其孤憤。潑墨爲戲。殘山賸水。古木寒烟。以及蟲魚鳥獸花草之屬。信手拈來。俊逸奇瑰。卓然樹異幟於藝苑。爲後世楷模。則其非常之抱負。不發之彼。即見於此。是又非游神乎道者。不克有。位諸列仙。世世受有道者之奉祀。不亦宜哉。余問道人山人墓所在。曰在丁家山。廣度庵前。去此五里强。問有人能爲導否。道人俯仰視。謝曰。天欲晚。且雨。田間路小泥濘。不能方足。請俟明日乃可。因言山人墓。實厠叢塚中。一土饅頭耳。了無碑碣之飾。荒草斜陽。牛羊上下。無可資憑吊者。先師雲巖曾擬修整之。以傍塚累累。恐遷闢有礙陰隲。乃止。言次。不勝感喟。余謂山人逃於玄。生已忘身。更何有於身後。歷數百年猶存一坯土於荒草斜陽間。是眞有足憑吊者。玉匣冬青。千古幾何完穴。孝陵風雨。亦徒有翁仲輩飲泣荆棘中耳。能修整之。固後人責仍其舊。亦無喪往哲之靈。若漫爲粉飾。轉恐山人不耐俗。難安　穸矣。相與莞爾。時雨甚如瀉。積水滿庭。凉風習習侵肌。若深秋。御者又恐天晚戒嚴。不便入城。催歸。度即不能謁山人墓。遂約期别道人行。車上泥途。輪重不可轉。御者一挽一推。邪許盡氣力。得寸寸以進。余顧謂風子曰。一出象妙之門。雲泥頓别矣。象妙之門四字。山人書。其門人朱宏選刻諸一門石上。展舒圓勁。風子嘆爲仙筆。嘗口占太祖江山成往事。先生筆底自千秋者也。山人有姑某。國變後。亦爲女道士。其地今號朱姑庵。有橋曰朱姑橋。去青雲圃不遠。亦道士言。（移酬助賑）</p>

<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>但是陳先生却比陳夫人率直得多。他以爲李先生是自己的好朋友，自己妻子和李夫人又是好朋友，應該設法解除他們夫婦間的隔膜，平時又因爲同居在一宅屋子裏的關係，正和一家人一般。所以他隱約地把李先生平時金錢收入的數目告訴了李夫人，又秘密地敎導李夫人最緊要的方法，是監察李先生的財政，</p>
<p>李先生的收入，是比陳先生寛裕得多，但是家庭裏的用度，却是陳先生負擔得重。陳先生有兩個兒子，三個女兒，一個瘋癰的姑母，一個老邁的伯母，並且陳夫人擅長交際，交際費的數目也很可觀，所以陳先生每月收入，差不多完全安放在家庭裏化用，自己所用的，佔不到全收入十分之一。他很尅苦省儉，輕易是不肯化用一個錢的。</p>
<p>李先生恰巧相反，他自奉很奢，家庭裏所負擔的費用是很少。他除了一個夫人以外，什麽分利者也没有了。他夫人很體恤他。替他很省儉，伊知道丈夫在外面做事很辛苦，他賺的錢，應該由他舒服地化用，祇要使他精神上身體上都受到愉快與舒適，他可以長期或永久的勤懇而安心地工作。</p>
<p>這兩對夫婦的環境與見解，是這樣的不同，所以他們的際遇，也發生了不相同的火花，</p>
<p>李夫人雖然也覺得陳先生的說話，是有相當的理由，但是伊還懷疑着一個妻子假使時時刻刻去和丈夫鬧着錢的問題，是不是一件很麻煩而容易增加夫婦間的惡感？所以伊嘴裏是答應着陳先生，却不敢實行。伊不懂私自背着丈夫積藏金錢。伊不會浪費，少許的錢，伊覺得已够開支，什麽都滿足了；但是伊的不滿足，祇在躭心着丈夫爲了什麽到家裏是這樣不愉快，爲什麽精神這樣地恍惚，而每夜又回來得這樣遲？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Jiangbei Flood Devastation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Eighteen Counties Severely Affected</p>
<p>Guazhou East Riverbank Collapses Again</p>
<p>Nanjing Provincial Committee telegraphed after inspecting the Dongtai area, stating that although Dongtai was flooded and suffered population losses, the situation was not as severe as reported. However, villages along the edges of Gaoyou, Bao'ying, Hongze, and Dazong Lakes, with a population of over three million and tens of millions in property, have been completely washed away. The floodwaters are raging, and it is impossible to count the number of victims clinging to rooftops, trees, and gathering in slightly higher areas, making widespread relief efforts impossible. Only those visible are being provided with food first, but there is no general solution yet. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: The east riverbank of Guazhou, across from Zhenjiang, has collapsed again, submerging 120 square li, affecting over 50,000 victims. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: According to a telegram from Bao'ying County Magistrate Zhao to the Provincial Government, the water level has been rising sharply for days. Despite leading efforts to reinforce the dikes, the strong winds and surging water have caused almost all the dikes to collapse. The number of deaths is incalculable. Fortunately, the city remains intact. Please provide swift relief. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: The Provincial Government has dispatched He Haiqiao and others, along with troops from the Pacification Commissioner's Office, to Dongtai to find a way to open a port and divert water into the river. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: As of the evening of the 3rd, a total of 18 counties have been severely affected, with approximately 2.4 million victims. The hardest hit include Taizhou (400,000), Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Yancheng, and Dongtai (300,000 each). Moderately affected areas include Zhenjiang (150,000), Funing (100,000), Bin'ying, Jiangyin, Jurong, and Yizheng (50,000 each), Gaoxun and Lishui (30,000 each), Rugao, Jiangning, and Yangzhou (20,000 each). In addition to organizing seven relief teams that have already departed, the Jiangbei Temporary Charity Relief Association has also dispatched ten special commissioners to conduct on-site investigations. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman Chiang Likely to Arrive in Nanjing This Morning <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Naval News: Chiang's ship departed from Hankou as late as 4 AM on the morning of the 3rd. Based on the ship's speed, it is estimated to arrive in Nanjing between 3 AM and 4 AM on the morning of the 4th. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Telegrams from various Hankou agencies give conflicting dates and times for Chiang's journey. However, the Tan Funeral Ceremony Office stated that they received a telegram from Chiang indicating that he would definitely arrive on the morning of the 4th to oversee the ceremony and hold the funeral rope. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing Relief Committee's Hankou Telegram: Chiang only began his journey downstream on the afternoon of the 2nd. On the 1st, he inspected the water situation on the Yong Sui warship, returning to Hankou on the same day. The disaster situation in Jiangbei is no less severe than in Hubei. Losses of life, livestock, and fields account for half of the wealth. The terrain in southern Anhui is slightly higher, but several county towns have also been flooded. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Wuhan River Water Continues to Recede <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Bridge Construction Proceeding Actively</p>
<p>Hankou: The river water receded by about one inch on the 3rd. There are gradually more rickshaws. Bridge construction is proceeding actively. The section from Jianghan Customs to Yiyuan has been completed. Anti-epidemic injections are expected to be completed in about five days.

<p>Hankou: Although there was heavy rain yesterday, the accumulated water continues to recede, having no effect. People in Hankou are greatly relieved today. The lower levels of many houses with higher foundations have dried out. The problem of accommodating refugees remains very difficult. Public and private relief organizations are currently handling this matter and find it extremely challenging. Although temporary shelters have been widely erected in Wuchang and Hanyang, they are still insufficient. Anti-epidemic efforts are also being carried out vigorously. Dozens of sampans flying the Red Cross flag are providing injections in various streets. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: According to an investigation released by the Wuhan Garrison Command, the initial assessment of the losses from the Wuhan flood is as follows:</p>
<p>Houses Collapsed  Victims</p>
<p>Hankou 22,087 97,147</p>
<p>Wuchang 17,209 79,066</p>
<p>Hanyang 3,793 17,577</p>
<p>Total 43,089 193,790</p>
<p>Hankou: The Wuhan flood has gradually receded. Last night, the water on the floors of houses in the concession area receded completely. The water on the roads has also gradually receded to waist level. The whole city is gradually showing signs of recovery and joy. The flood season is almost over. The Hubei Flood Relief Association is currently planning to drain the entire city of Hankou, intending to use the railway line as a boundary. An average of 51-foot waterproof walls will be built along the Yangtze and Han Rivers, bounded by Qiaokou and the Japanese concession upstream and downstream, to start draining the water together. It is estimated that the total amount of water accumulated in Hankou is approximately 400 million cubic feet. Assuming a drainage capacity of 170,000 gallons per minute, it would take ten days of non-stop drainage. The plank bridge built from Hankou Customs to the Water and Electricity Company on Zhongshan Road was completed today, a remarkable sight created by the flood.

<p>The United States Has Agreed to Mediate</p>
<p>Nanjing: Foreign Minister Wang told reporters on the 3rd about the situation of the anti-Chinese movement in Mexico: "This case began in June. According to a telegram from Minister Xiong, Chinese merchants in several ports in Sonora were forced to close by the anti-Chinese party. The situation was severe and negotiations had begun with the Mexican Foreign Ministry. Chinese merchants account for 80 to 90% of the grocery business in the states of Ren Shun and Shan. This has long been noticed by Mexicans. Also, because thousands of Mexican overseas Chinese who were unemployed returned to the two states of Shun Shan, the anti-Chinese party took the opportunity to claim patriotism and saving the country, forcing Chinese merchants to close. The leader of the anti-Chinese party is former President Calles. His son is the newly elected governor of Shun Province. Officials were forced and could not interfere. The Mexican Foreign Ministry was also unable to stop them. The President also has no real power. Minister Xiong asked the American ambassador to mediate, but it was ineffective. The American side agreed to allow refugees to enter temporarily to avoid danger when necessary. Because negotiations were ineffective, Minister Xiong issued a statement that the Mexican government should bear full responsibility and reserve the right to demand compensation for losses. Negotiations have reached a dead end. It is normal to temporarily suspend relations with Mexico and withdraw the ambassador for the sake of the refugees seeking temporary refuge in the United States. For the sake of solemnity, we asked the US government to be responsible for mediation, and the US side has agreed. We sincerely hope that it can turn around." (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Mexico Telegram: Today, Chinese Minister Xiong received a telephone report from the Chinese Consul in Hermosillo regarding the anti-Chinese movement. It is claimed that the new Governor of Sonora, Carlos, has guaranteed that the remaining overseas Chinese in the state will not be immediately forced to leave. However, the telephone was slightly obstructed, and the language transmitted was not very clear. Therefore, the content of the negotiations is not very clear, but it is expected that at least the coercion of Chinese to leave will be temporarily stopped. However, because the overseas Chinese in the state can no longer make a living, those who are given permission to enter the US to go to San Francisco to board ships to return home are still coming one after another. (2nd National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: Today, the Chinese Embassy in the United States issued an article stating that the anti-Chinese movement in Sonora and Sinaloa, Mexico, has abused overseas Chinese, deprived more than 7,000 overseas Chinese of their legal rights, and is currently spreading to other states.

<h3 id="e42">Foreign Merchants' Monopoly of Shipping Rights on the Upper Yangtze Broken by Chinese Ships <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Big Fight Official Agreement) Established</p>
<p>Chinese Shipping Alliance Cooperation</p>
<p>In early summer of this year, foreign merchants from England, Japan, and the United States in the shipping industry on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Sichuan River planned to monopolize the industry and eliminate Chinese shipping companies. At that time, they reduced the freight rate for cotton yarn, a major commodity, from 12 taels to 6 taels, causing panic among the six Chinese shipping companies. At that time, the Yichang Navigation Bureau Chief came to Shanghai to discuss countermeasures with various shipping companies and organized a Commercial Transport Association to resist the foreign merchants. However, the plan failed shortly after the foreign merchants joined the association. The foreign shipping companies further reduced the freight rate to 4 taels, and then reduced it further to 3 taels in actual payment. This matter has been previously reported in this newspaper. As the resistance began, the situation changed slightly, and the poisonous scheme of the foreign merchants to monopolize the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was broken by the joint efforts of Chinese ships. The details of this matter are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Resist Price Cuts: Since the English, Japanese, and American foreign merchants joined the Commercial Transport Conference, the freight rate for transporting yarn from Sichuan River to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was reduced from six taels to four taels, and then further reduced to a net of three taels. The rates for other goods were also similarly reduced. The Six Chinese Shipping Bureau of the Sichuan River was extremely panic-stricken. As a result, the companies held a joint meeting and decided to extend the mid-upper route directly to Shanghai, in addition to the fare is also reduced to compete for the same, from Chongqing to Shanghai, only eight money to shipping miscellaneous goods per piece to maintain shipping rights. ▲ Joint Apportionment: The foreign merchants are strong and well-funded, it is difficult to resist for a long time by one company alone, it was decided to form an alliance, foreigners are not allowed to join, the six companies agree on the system, to order a convention to protect the business of Chinese ships in Sichuan River, the main point in the six companies, after the business, take the method of mutual assistance and public share, such as one loss, then the five companies together to make up for it, so that the strength of the regiment, to support the long-term. The eleven-article agreement, called the (Big Fight Official) Agreement, was originally intended to take the business to fight the company's purpose.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Ships Have No Cargo: Since the beginning of the resistance last month, Japanese ships in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have been the first to be affected by the resistance. According to the investigation, there are a total of six Japanese ships in the Sichuan River, from Xuyu to Yisha, which are the most powerful enemies of Chinese ships. After the ports of Yichang and Chongqing decided on August 18 to refuse to transport Japanese ships and not to accept Japanese goods, Japanese ships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have had no cargo to load until now, giving Chinese ships a great opportunity to survive. The Chinese shipping business on the Yichang-Chongqing route has gradually become active, and the shipment of goods from Shanghai to the Shanghai direct line has also improved.</p>
<p>▲ British Ships Change Flags: The Taikoo Company has a very large business in the Xuyu ports in the upper reaches of the Sichuan River. It has built four shallow-water vessels specifically for this route. Recently, since the business groups in Sichuan Province have banned foreign-flagged merchant ships from operating in the non-treaty ports of the Sichuan River inland ports, the British ships have been greatly affected. In order to remedy this situation, the Taikoo Company specifically transferred the Wanhsien, Wantong, Wanliu, Xiushan, and Suiting Five Ships, totaling 3,700 tons, from the British Taikoo Company and organized a separate management agency. It still uses the name Taikoo, but on the surface, it is operated by Chinese merchants, and these five ships have been changed to use the Chinese flag.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Ships Lack Classes: Recently, since the floods occurred, many Chinese ships should be for rescue of refugees on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and Chinese ships have also been affected. This is only a temporary phenomenon, and it will soon be able to return to its original state. During this period when Chinese ships are short of shifts, the business of British and American ships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has improved slightly, but the monopoly plan has been broken by the six companies.</p>

<p>The Social Bureau is Ordered by the Yuan to Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Social Bureau received an order from the Municipal Government to forward Administrative Yuan Order No. 3895, which opened the matter for compliance. The case was reported to the Administrative Yuan in Administrative Yuan Order No. 3895, which opened, according to the joint presentation of the two departments of foreign affairs and industry, saying, "We have secretly investigated that in recent years, there have been many cases in which foreign oil companies rented land in our country to build oil pools and docks. Most of the provincial and municipal governments have reported to the Central Government for approval, but there are also many examples of local authorities not requesting instructions from the Central Government and directly signing contracts with foreign merchants to allow the construction. The construction of docks involves municipal management, and oil pools affect the safety of residents, and they are especially related to the scope of the right to rent and build in the treaty. They must be strictly reviewed and are insufficient to limit them. We propose that the Jun Yuan issue an order to all provincial and municipal governments and local military officers to pay attention to this type of rental construction by foreign merchants at any time and strictly prohibit them. If there are cases that are difficult to resolve due to the actual situation, they should also be reported to the Central Government for consideration and handling to show prudence. All those that have not been approved by the Central Government and have been directly allowed to rent and build, or have signed contracts with foreign merchants, will be invalid. Is it appropriate? We hereby report to the Jian Yuan for approval and implementation." According to this, in addition to instructing to approve and ordering the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to forward it to all local military officers and dividing the order, it is appropriate to order the Municipal Government to comply. This order, etc., is hereby issued to the Bureau for compliance. This order,</p>
<h3 id="e50">Sichuan Fellow Association Telegraphically Urges Liu Wenhui to Increase Troops to Aid Kang <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to Liu Wenhui, Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense, yesterday, saying: urgently, Chengdu, Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Army, Commander-in-Chief Liu, Ziganxun, in this battle, the Dalai Lama invaded Kang. The honorable army has been fighting against the enemy in the frozen and snowy land for several months. Whether it succeeds or fails, this fighting spirit alone is enough to be respected. However, this association has repeatedly received telegrams from the Xikang Preservation and Consolidation National Defense Support Association and the refugee groups from the thirteen counties of Xikang, saying that the loss of Ganzi Zhanhua by the border army this time is actually due to the fact that the number of soldiers is too small to resist the Tibetan army. Although the special commissioner of the Central Government, Ke San, has already arrived in Kang, the result of the negotiations is that the Tibetan army not only does not return Gan Zhan, but also increases the number of troops to peep at Lihua and invade Changtai, and even uses force to coerce the people to surrender. Large cannons are fired in Ganzi to demonstrate. If the border army does not increase its troops, the remaining areas of Xikang cannot be self-protected everywhere. This association is shocked and secretly believes that the reason why the situation in Sichuan has fallen into an irrecoverable situation is that the army is too large and there is no way to settle it, so seizing land and fighting for cities has actually become the natural and righteous way for the Sichuan army to fight each other. In fact, the Sichuan army is not suffering from being unable to settle down. As in the case of Kangzang in front of us, both national defense and reclamation require a large number of troops. However, all the generals do not have this far-reaching ambition. Since you have taken the territory of Xikang and have been authorized by the Central Government to serve as the Sichuan-Kang border defense, this association very much hopes that you will strive to become a famous figure in history, and do not make meaningless disputes like chickens and worms. As the commander of the 100,000 brave troops, go straight to the Guanshang of Yadong, then not only will the Dalai Lama meet and bow his head first, but with your strength, it will be easy to reverse the palm, so why bother to be reluctant to give up the chicken ribs in Sichuan? The time is now. I hope that you will immediately give priority to the border and make plans early. At the very least, you must increase troops to Kang to consolidate our encirclement. Do not sit back and let the Dalai Lama act as a puppet and run around with a stroke. I have sent this special telegram to you. I hope that you will pay attention to it.

<p>The National Seaport Quarantine Office has released its No. 6 report on cholera prevention. (1) In Shanghai last week (ending August 29th), a total of 21 cases of cholera were discovered. However, all were minor. Except for one death, there was one foreigner and five Chinese people (one deceased) in the Public Concession. These patients were scattered in various locations. (2) The British company's steamship "Cartay" departed from Shanghai on August 19th and arrived in Kobe, Japan on August 22nd. However, between August 21st and 26th, five cases of true cholera and ten carriers were discovered on board. All those affected were Indian. Cholera is very prevalent in Bombay, India this year. The ship has now departed from that port. Since the sailors did not disembark in Shanghai, the cholera discovered on board must have been carried on board before the ship arrived in Shanghai, which is why it occurred during the voyage and after arriving in Japan. However, the distance from India to Shanghai is quite far, and the incubation period of cholera is short, so it does not seem necessary to declare India a plague port. However, a detailed inspection is still required. It is also reported that the ship left Kobe on September 2nd. (3) Japan and the Dutch East Indies have both declared Shanghai a plague port. However, at the same time, passengers from this port to Java and other seaports are all required to be injected with cholera vaccine. (4) For the past two weeks, no new cases of cholera have been reported in Zhoupu, Pudong. This is clear evidence of the good results obtained from injecting preventive vaccines after the disease was discovered. (5) Passengers arriving in Shanghai from Ningbo are all injected with vaccinations in Wusong. This matter should continue until September 15th. According to statistics, from August 2nd to 31st, 22,415 people were vaccinated on board ships. Starting in August, the number of people vaccinated in Shanghai is estimated to be 90,448 in the Shanghai Municipality and 12,679 in the French Concession. (6) Special Department medical officers have been dispatched to Hankou, Nanjing, and Wusong to inspect and vaccinate refugees in various disaster areas against cholera, smallpox, and typhoid fever, to reduce the spread of these infectious diseases to a minimum. In Chinese history, the government and health authorities have never paid as much attention to public health as they do now. The cooperation policy between Chinese and Westerners in this humanitarian endeavor will surely increase international amity in the East.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Private Detective Problem <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Director-General and the Lawyer Hold Inconsistent Views</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: "Sir, in view of the fact that the Police Protection Association overstepped the authority of a public agency, on July 20th, the Grell Private Detective Agency sent a letter to your bureau, stating that it was due to an advertisement seen in the newspaper that was published by the Grell Private Detective Agency. The association observed that, firstly, the actions of the agency would inevitably result in something similar to the Police Protection Association; secondly, the agency used the name of the former Deputy Chief of Police of your bureau, which was akin to flaunting and would have a bearing on the reputation of your bureau and the social peace. Based on the above two points, this association should request your bureau to take measures to prohibit it." Subsequently, on July 24th, your bureau replied with No. 3117, approving the big letter of July 21st for the Grell Private Detective Agency. Upon this, the establishment of a private detective agency is not illegal and is common in major cities in Europe and America. If the employees of the detective agency do not infringe upon the duties of the police and do not violate the law, it is impossible to give a real objection. As for Mr. Grell using his former position in the police department as advertising material, it should not have any adverse effects. Mr. Grell is now striving to make his detective agency perform its duties within a legitimate and legal scope. Therefore, the Grell Private Detective Agency is not an illegal organization. Your director-general, representing your bureau, has given a real recognition. And the actions of the agency will definitely be legitimate and legal. Because the Director-General is familiar with Mr. Grell, he also gave an affirmative guarantee in the memorandum. As for the association's long-term considerations, they are neither respected, nor is the position of the Police Department of your Bureau cherished. Letting the agency set up an anti-certification police department has no ability to deal with detective matters and must be handled by private detectives. When the reply was approved, it was intended to send another letter of protest. I then thought that the Director-General had been working in the bureau for a long time, and if there was no definite opinion, how dare he represent your bureau and make such a definite certification and guarantee reply. As for the event, try the view of your bureau and the association. Which is higher, which is lower, which is better, which is worse? But I don’t want the Association to say something that will harm society. How can the newspapers report on September 3 that a local news story is for your director-general, representing your bureau, is recognized as a non-illegal organization, and the private detective protection office run by Mr. Grell, who guarantees its legitimate and legal performance, has been filed in court by the police department of your bureau, and the court of the public prosecution lawyer Ru Baoyi, said that the words "private detective" are reminiscent of the fact that they are no different from the arrest and exploration. According to the charter of Yangjingbang real estate, private detectives have no basis, and the police agency in the public concession can no longer have any police agency other than the public works bureau, exercising its powers. Therefore, the Public Works Department absolutely denies the private detective protection office and considers it to have no right to exercise its duties. The court's president, Zhou Hanting, decided that (the private detective protection office is an illegal agency and cannot arbitrarily exercise its functions). This association believes that your director-general represents the above-mentioned reply of your bureau, and the statement of the arrest lawyer, their judgment on the office, one is recognition, one is denial, one guarantees its legitimate and legal exercise of duties, and the other is said to have no right to exercise duties. The Association believes that your bureau should be consistent in its attitude towards any event. Please explain the reasons for the differences. Otherwise, your director-general is an important responsible public official of your bureau, and should know how to be in his place to protect the position of your bureau. Corresponding letters, I hope to check and handle them."</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>Respectfully, I read an article in your newspaper's local news section on the first of this month entitled "Head of Village Beats Man to Death," and found that many of the facts were inconsistent. On August 7th, Qing Chao Chen A'tu tied up Zhang Chaosheng and Ke Miaofa and brought them to the village office, claiming that Zhang and Ke had stolen fish. At that time, I had just gotten up and was doing business in the shop. The shop is two streets away from the village office. Upon hearing the news, I immediately went there and saw many people mediating, ordering Zhang and Ke to compensate one thousand fish fry to be delivered by the tenth month of winter to settle the matter. Chen was also willing to settle the matter in this way and did not want to escalate the situation. The crowd then encouraged Zhang Chaolin to explain the matter on behalf of the bound men. I, seeing that Chen's intention was such, did not want to interfere and let them disperse. On the 19th, Zhang and his wife came and said that they wanted to go to Chen A'tu's house, with a particularly angry look. Fearing that something would happen, I advised them to go to the district office together, but Zhang refused. I told them to wait temporarily and went to the district office myself to inform the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who dispatched police to the town. By then, Zhang and his wife had already returned home. On the 24th, because of Zhang's death, his wife went to the district office to demand fifty yuan for funeral expenses from Chen A'tu, but Chen refused, and the matter dispersed. I had no say in giving rice or money. This is the true state of affairs. As for whether Zhang Chaosheng died from his injuries and whether there was any beating at the beginning, I did not witness it and am not in a position to speculate. However, I have no grievances with either Chen or Zhang, and I did not order Zhang to be hanged from a paulownia tree and beaten, nor did I say anything about giving rice or money. There were many merchants and residents in the town who gathered to watch the scene, and they all heard and saw it. It can be inquired and investigated. The report in your newspaper is likely a misinterpretation of hearsay. I am writing to request that your editor publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section for clarification and to clarify the facts, as a matter of utmost fairness. Respectfully addressed to the editors of the Shen Bao, Yang Yandong, September 2nd.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Mr. Xing, director of the Shen Bao: Respectfully, I was surprised to read in the local news column of your newspaper that Li Junfu, an employee of our company, committed suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River after being unsuccessful in his marriage proposal. Upon investigation, there is no person named Li Junfu among the employees of our company. It must be a misunderstanding. I am writing specifically to request that you immediately correct this error. This is what we earnestly hope for. Sincerely, the Guang Sheng Hang Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Respectfully, according to the statement of the party concerned, Qu Yunlong, Yunlong was suddenly hit by a car on the evening of the first of this month at the intersection of Great Western Road and Columbia Road and is now receiving treatment in the first-class ward No. 22 of the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. Unexpectedly, this morning, the Shen Bao local news section reported that Qu Ronglong, the owner of the New Star Milk Stall, was crushed to death by a car. This is far from the truth. I entrust you, dear lawyer, to write to the newspaper to make a correction immediately. Respectfully addressed to the Shen Bao, Lawyer Fang Jiahe, September 3rd.</p>
<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Weishan's Message</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Shen Bao is the old pioneer of Chinese newspapers. Its consistent attitude has always been as steady and prudent as an elderly person, without any signs of being inflammatory. Recently, the editorials in your newspaper have suddenly shown a phenomenon of returning to youth. This sixty-year-old man is much more energetic and has a much fresher mind than before. Who says the Shen Bao is old? Its future is truly limitless. These are my recent thoughts after reading your newspaper.</p>
<p>Today is the 60th anniversary of your newspaper's founding. You have published a 60th anniversary commemorative declaration, full of ambition, establishing goals for future efforts. The points listed are indeed of great importance to our country and our nation. I hope that your newspaper will strive to put them into practice and move towards a great future. Go, go, go! In addition, there is a piece of good news for readers in today's newspaper—the Reader Correspondence advertisement, which helps readers solve problems that are not easy to solve on their own. This is truly a great convenience for young people.</p>
<p>I would now like to raise a question, with sincerity, hoping for your kind reply:</p>
<p>(1) According to the commemorative declaration in today's newspaper, it is certainly necessary to study natural science. But I wonder, in addition to natural science, whether social science should be studied, or must be studied?</p>
<p>(2) If (should) and (must), then from which subject should one start, what books should one read first, and how should one read them?</p>
<p>(Reply) Society has many needs, and people's innate talents and aptitudes differ. The newspaper's declaration wishes to introduce the study of science, only because our past society seemed to pay too little attention to natural science, believing that it was particularly necessary to promote it. As for sciences other than natural science, of course, they should also be studied and must be studied.</p>
<p>Speaking of social sciences, the scope is very broad. Just looking at the university, look at its courses, the number of subjects related to social science is unknown. You can fully understand social needs on the one hand, and your own talents and aptitudes on the other, carefully select, and study step by step. If you are studying at school, you should sincerely ask your teachers for guidance.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Hu Shi Catches Ghosts <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Hu Shi's organization of national heritage is most insightful; his Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy, though only one-third complete, is already a timeless masterpiece. However, his contemporary commentaries are often off the mark. Last year, he published an article in Crescent Moon, "Which Road Should We Take?", listing China's five ghosts: poverty, disease, ignorance, corruption, and turmoil, and arbitrarily dismissing the aggression of imperialism. Liang Shuming wrote a letter rebutting him. Several friends in Tokyo were also deeply dissatisfied with his views. Personally, I believe that besides foreign imperialism, there is also a great demon in the country that Shi Zhi has overlooked. This great demon is the doctrine of multiple births, of many blessings, long life, and sons. Because of multiple births, there is not enough land to cultivate, not enough work to do, not enough food to eat. Because of multiple births, there is poverty; because of poverty, there is no money for medical treatment, no money to educate children. Because everyone has multiple births, there are many poor relatives, many poor friends, making those with weak wills inevitably greedy. Because of multiple births and the inability to make a living, people become thieves, bandits, raise armies, and create chaos. Poverty, ignorance, disease, corruption, and internal strife, of course, must be defeated, but if the superstition of multiple births is not eradicated in the country, and if imperialism is not overthrown abroad, then these five little ghosts will certainly follow us every step of the way. In fact, the commander-in-chief of imperialism is also the doctrine of multiple births, because multiple births require colonies, raw materials, and markets. The greatest source of chaos in the world is the doctrine of multiple births. If this demon is not removed, how can the world be peaceful, how can China have a way out? Below is a poem I sent to Shi Zhi:</p>
<p>(Clear on archeology,</p>
<p>Ignorant of knowing the present:</p>
<p>Catching five little ghosts,</p>
<p>Letting go of a big demon.)</p>
<h3 id="e78">A Brief Biography of Zhu Ji <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Huizhai</p>
<p>Ji Zhu, given name Lanfu, was from Shaoxing. Her grandfather was once recommended as a filial and incorrupt official. Her father was a scholar serving in a certain government office in Jinhua. Ji grew up in Jinhua and graduated from elementary school. In the year of Yi Chou, at the age of sixteen, her father died, and there were no means to provide for his funeral. Her mother also fell seriously ill, lacking funds for medical treatment. Creditors filled the door. Having no other choice, she was sold to a boat on the Lanxi Jiangshan. Ji felt that falling into prostitution was not her wish and attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself into the river. At that time, her third younger brother, Guozhai, was stationed in Lanxi as a salt inspector. He ordered a patrol boat to rescue her. Upon inquiring about the beginning and end of the matter, Ji said, "I would not refuse to be a concubine, but I vow that I will never be a prostitute." Her third younger brother was saddened by her situation and borrowed money to pay for her ransom, leaving her to recuperate in the bureau. In the spring of Bing Wu, I traveled to Yantan. Ji fell in love with me at first sight and became my concubine. She followed me back to Beiping. My family was poor and had no servants or maids. Ji took charge of all the cooking. She managed the rice and salt in an orderly manner. In her spare time, I taught her poetry, and she was quite able to grasp the basics. One of her lines from a cool summer evening at Shichahai was: "The lake is calm, the wind has just settled, the trees are dense, the moon seems slow to appear." I changed it to "The wind wants to settle, the moon is especially slow." For a time, it was widely circulated. Although the poem is not excellent, it is not easy for a beginner to achieve. I once took her to watch the famous actor performing "Farewell My Concubine." The reciter Ning Luocun mistakenly read Ning as Ding. Ji laughed so much that she could not stand upright and told me, "Only now do I know that famous actors are just empty names. They truly have no ink in their chests." Her intelligence was such. She was gentle and kind, and got along well with the family for five years. On the anniversary of her parents' death, she would always ask me for permission to offer private sacrifices as prescribed by etiquette. She was devoted to her family and did not lose the demeanor of an old family. Last spring, my wife argued with me over our daughter's marriage. A wicked woman named Chen and another named Hu instigated her to file a lawsuit in court. As a family dedicated to ritual and morality, this sudden change in the old family caused me a hundred knots of sorrow and no joy in life. Ji consoled and comforted me in many ways. In winter, Yu Youren telegraphed and summoned me to come south. Ji was already ill. I hesitated to make a decision. Ji urged me to go quickly to relieve my troubles. She forced herself to make cotton socks for me to wear in the cold on the long journey. I arrived in Ningfang for only a month, and repeatedly received letters from home saying that Ji's illness was worsening day by day. Ji still sent me a letter saying that there was hope for recovery without medicine. She would come south as soon as she recovered. She was afraid of adding to my worries. She had a plump face. When asked about her illness, she smiled and did not answer. I woke up in surprise. I looked up at the sky. It was dark and there was no light. It was an eclipse of the moon. The next morning, I received a telegram from Ping saying that Ji had passed away the previous night at midnight. She appeared in my dream, smiling and not answering. Did her soul know and not want to hurt my heart? Alas, how tragic. I mourned with a couplet, "Three thousand miles away, separated by a new capital, who would have thought that a life separation would become a death farewell. At the age of twenty-two, she suddenly left this turbulent world, she was truly unfortunate, and Heaven was too merciless." I will write this to mourn her. Ji was born on the fourteenth day of the seventh month of the year of Geng Xu, and she died at the age of twenty-two. She was buried at Sanhu Bridge, south of Wanshou Temple, outside Xizhimen in Beiping. Alas, I am ashamed to lack the talent of Dongpo, and Ji truly possessed the virtue of Zhaoyun. How could I not say a word to honor her and comfort her soul in the underworld?</p>

<p>▲ The World's Largest Buddha Statue The Japanese have always worshiped Buddha. Although their actions are exactly the opposite of the Buddha's teachings. According to reports from the British, the world's largest Buddha statue will soon be built near Tokyo. It is estimated to be 40 feet high and made entirely of mixed soil. It is extremely solid and will cost 10,000 pounds. The Buddha's front hem is spread out, and the area is so large that it can accommodate 3,000 people standing on it.</p>
<p>▲ Butterflies Flying Thousands of Miles In the British summer, you can often see a large white butterfly called the Cabbage White. Their place of origin is in the Baltic Sea. Millions can be born at a time. Once there is a shortage of food, they form groups and fly to various parts of Europe. Sometimes you can see them flying over Germany, the sky is white, like a heavy snow. There is also a butterfly in England called the Painted Lady, which originally originated in central Africa. Sometimes hundreds of thousands fly over the Sahara Desert, stop briefly in North Africa, and then continue to fly north, reaching the British Isles. This butterfly can also be regarded as a long-distance flyer.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Talking about Strange Dogs <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shuping</p>
<p>The righteousness and strange deeds of dogs have been repeatedly published. I have recently obtained two more incidents and must record them.</p>
<p>Bingge is a famous war dog in the American army. During the European War, the American army took it to the battlefield. Its sense of smell is more acute than that of ordinary dogs. For example, detecting enemy positions, touching near gas, all use its nostrils. It can also use special signals to hint to the same army that the war is over. When awarding merits, Bingge also participated. After winning honors, he unfortunately died recently. The US government deeply regretted this and ordered him to be buried in a public cemetery. In addition, he was given 40 gold coins per month to his caretaker to help cultivate war dogs.</p>
<p>There is a Mr. in the United States who likes to keep dogs. His food, clothing, shelter, and travel are always with them. Mr. was suddenly sentenced to several months in prison for an offense. The dog refused to leave and abandon him on the day his master entered the prison. He followed him to the prison. When the prison door was locked, he was screened outside the door. The dog stood guard and did not leave. It waited from October 14, 1929, to June 20, 1930. During the middle, the prison guard gave it food every day, but it was never seen to leave for a moment. Such perseverance, loyalty, and love, expressed by a dog, is valuable. Upon hearing the news, the American Dog Friends Federation awarded him a gold medal with the inscription (A True Friend of Mankind).</p>
<h3 id="e81">Notes on Yunnan Baiyao <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Nanding</p>
<p>Yunnan and Sichuan are the best regions for producing medicine. The medicines produced there are different from those of ordinary places. They uniquely obtain the essence of the earth's energy. The effects are great. For example, Poria, golden ear fungus, ginseng, notoginseng, chicken blood vine, deer velvet antler, etc., are all famous and good medicines in Yunnan. In the past, Li Xiujia, a military representative from Yunnan Province, came to Beijing from Yunnan and passed through Shanghai. Because of close family ties, he gave me one Yunnan Poria, weighing 72 taels, two boxes of ginseng and notoginseng, several catties of golden ear fungus, and two bottles of Baiyao. Poria, ginseng, notoginseng, and golden ear fungus are natural specialties of Yunnan, while Baiyao is made by combining ingredients. Its function is to specialize in treating injuries from falls and fractures, broken bones, and dislocated joints. Even if the skin is penetrated by bullets or even if the muscles and bones are damaged, taking it will heal immediately. It is also called Baibao Dan. The maker is an old man, who is in his seventies. No one but the old man can make it. The method was passed down by the Miao people in Yunnan Province. Yunnan Province is located far in the southwest, surrounded by high mountains and ridges. Many Miao barbarians live in mountain caves. The Miao are cruel and like to fight. They often fight with swords and knives. Those who are injured have no doctors. They swallow this Baiyao, and it always works like magic. The old man got it from the Miao people. Anyone who asks to be taught this secret method is rejected. He said that he is illiterate and can only prepare this medicine. Those who are literate have ruined brains and cannot make it. Or ask to pass it on to his son, and he says that he is stubborn and unresponsive and cannot do it. Therefore, no one but the old man can make it. The Yunnan army is known for its good fighting skills. After being injured, they swallow this Baiyao. The old man also keeps the combination of medicines secret. A Japanese chemist once wanted to know its ingredients and made many attempts, but he could not get them. When Lu Dan'an visited Yunnan, he heard the name of Baiyao and made an appointment with the old man, guaranteeing with his reputation that he would not let unscrupulous merchants deceive him. The old man agreed and made Lu Jun the sales agent for the entire Jiangsu Province. When Lu Jun returned, he had brought hundreds of bottles. Now I hear that the old man has continued to send a thousand bottles to meet the demand.</p>
<p>▲ Organization of a Gathering to Study National Opera Recently, Mei Wan Hua has been in Beiping, studying famous Chinese and foreign plays with famous old and new opera scholars, intending to improve Chinese opera. Recently, he launched a gathering to study opera, intending to invite famous amateur actors and well-known performers from Pingjin to gather often to study each other and discuss progress. It is reported that Yu Shuyan was the first to agree and has already begun preparations. As for Mei's position as vice president of the Peking Opera Academy, he has resigned and will serve as a director of the academy. (Knowledge)</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Editor Esteemed reporter, recently, fundraising for disaster relief is very noisy in Shanghai. Thinking of the contributors to Free Talk, some have volunteered not to receive remuneration. Then, in the future, the remuneration can be moved to help disaster relief. Or the contributor volunteers to automatically move the remuneration from the article to help disaster relief. (You can indicate the words "Remuneration Moved to Disaster Relief"). Then the literati will also have the opportunity to donate. Please publish this letter. I wish you all the best. Brother Shen Tingkai respectfully bows. August 30th.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Qingyunpu and Bada Shanren (Part 2) <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— He Wuchang</p>
<p>Da, as a descendant of the fallen royal family, hid in Taoism, then called himself Delang. Liangyue is a pseudonym for Lang. His intention was that with the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the imperial line was extinct. He despised the survivors and no longer saw the sun. With infinite rivers and mountains, cherishing the old country, he only allowed himself to look back in the bright moonlight. Therefore, he also called himself Boyunzi, hoping that the clouds would be thin and the moonlight would be easy to see. His younger brother's name, Poyunzi, both deeply expressed their cherishing of the old country. Da's original surname was Zhu, and he and his brother avoided it, each taking half of it as their name. One took eight, called Bada Shanren. One took the ox, called Niushi Hui. Every book must be written in cursive as Bada Shanren for crying and laughing. Niushi Hui means not bowing to the ruler in life. Crying means mourning the destroyed ancestral shrine. Laughing means ridiculing that he himself had not died. Not bowing to the ruler in life means vowing not to eat Zhou millet for the rest of his life. Ma Shiyuan's original surname was Shangguan, a military official of the Ming Dynasty. It is not known why he changed his surname to Ma. He came with the Shanren brothers. Some say that Ma was actually the intermediary for the arrival of the Shanren brothers. After he finished speaking, he led us to the incense hall, which was used to worship the successive Taoist masters. The memorial tablets in the niche were stacked, and there were statues in between. The head of the statue was the master of Liangyue, followed by Poyunzi, and then Ma. Flowers and fruits were arranged in a mess, and incense smoke filled the room, making one feel respectful. There was more than enough regret. When the Ming Dynasty fell, its ministers and people rose up to restore the dynasty. Although none of them succeeded, they all preserved their ambitions among the Jianghu gangs, hoping to make a difference. After hundreds of years to this day, they have been able to use their potential for national revolution. The purpose of the masters coming here was to change Yiguan to Pu. Their ambition was not only in Taoism, but also in contentment with tranquility. Boyun and Poyun never stopped looking forward to the re-emergence of the sun and moon. However, he eventually ended his life as a Taoist and was worshiped as the ancestor of this sect. Looking around at the rivers and mountains, it is really not known how to cry or laugh. Shanren then expressed his loneliness and anger, splashing ink as a play. The remaining mountains and waters, ancient trees and cold smoke, as well as insects, fish, birds, and flowers, were all taken at will, with his talent and strangeness. He established a different banner in the art world and became a model for future generations. His extraordinary ambition was not expressed there, but was seen here. This is also not something that a Taoist who travels with the gods can have. Ranked among the immortals, receiving the worship of Taoists for generations, is also appropriate. I asked the Taoist where Shanren's tomb was. He said that it was on Dingjia Mountain, in front of Guangdu Temple, more than five miles away. I asked if anyone could guide me. The Taoist looked up and down and said, "It's getting late, and it's raining. The country roads are small and muddy, and it's not easy to walk. Please wait until tomorrow." He then said that Shanren's tomb was actually among the many tombs, a mound of earth, with no monuments or decorations. The wild grass and setting sun, cattle and sheep going up and down, there is nothing to mourn. The late master Yunyan once intended to repair it, but he stopped because he was afraid that the many tombs next to it would hinder the Yin Zhi. As he spoke, he was filled with emotion. I said that Shanren escaped to the mystery, forgetting himself in life, and what does he have to do with after death? After hundreds of years, there is still a pile of earth in the wilderness. This is really worth mourning. The jade box and winter green, how many complete holes in the ages? The wind and rain in Xiaoling, also have only statues of officials weeping among the thorns. Being able to repair it is the responsibility of future generations to keep it as it is. There is no loss to the spirit of past philosophers. If you casually decorate it, I am afraid that Shanren will not be able to bear the vulgarity and will be difficult to appease. We smiled at each other. At that time, the rain was heavy like pouring. The accumulated water filled the courtyard. The cool wind blew on the skin, like late autumn. The coachman was also afraid that it would be too late and the curfew would make it inconvenient to enter the city, so he urged us to return. Du, I could not visit Shanren's tomb. I made an appointment to say goodbye to the Taoist. The wheels were heavy and could not turn on the muddy road. The coachman pulled and pushed, exerting all his strength. We got inch by inch to advance. I turned to Fengzi and said, "Once out of the door of Xiangmiao, the clouds and mud are different." The four characters of the door of Xiangmiao were written by Shanren, and his disciple Zhu Hongxuan carved them on a stone on the door. He expanded and stretched the round strength. Fengzi sighed as a fairy's pen and once improvised a poem: "Taizu's rivers and mountains have become the past, and the teacher's pen is from a thousand autumns." Shanren had an aunt who was also a female Taoist after the national change. Her place is now called Zhugu Nunnery. There is a bridge called Zhugu Bridge, not far from Qingyunpu, also said by the Taoist. (Remuneration Moved to Disaster Relief)</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chen was much more straightforward than Mrs. Chen. He thought Mr. Li was his good friend, and his wife and Mrs. Li were also good friends. He should find a way to resolve the estrangement between their couple. Besides, they lived in the same house, just like a family. Therefore, he vaguely told Mrs. Li the amount of Mr. Li’s usual income, and secretly taught Mrs. Li the most important method, which was to monitor Mr. Li's finances.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's income was much more abundant than Mr. Chen's, but the household expenses were heavier for Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen had two sons, three daughters, a crazy aunt, and an elderly aunt. Moreover, Mrs. Chen was good at socializing, and the amount of social expenses was also considerable. Therefore, Mr. Chen's monthly income was almost entirely used in the family, and what he used himself accounted for less than one-tenth of the total income. He was very frugal and would not spend a penny easily.</p>
<p>Mr. Li was exactly the opposite. He was very extravagant in his own consumption, and the expenses borne by the family were very small. Besides his wife, he had no other beneficiaries. His wife was very considerate of him. She was very thrifty for him. She knew that her husband worked very hard outside. The money he earned should be used comfortably by him, as long as his spirit and body were pleasant and comfortable, he could work diligently and peacefully for a long or permanent period.</p>
<p>The environment and views of these two couples were so different, so their experiences also produced different sparks.</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Li also felt that what Mr. Chen said was quite reasonable, she still doubted whether it was a very troublesome matter and easily increased the ill feelings between husband and wife if a wife argued with her husband about money all the time? Therefore, she agreed with Mr. Chen in her mouth, but she did not dare to implement it. She did not understand how to secretly save money behind her husband's back. She would not waste money. She felt that a small amount of money was enough for expenses, and she was satisfied with everything; but her dissatisfaction only lay in worrying about why her husband was so unhappy at home, why he was so distracted, and why he came back so late every night?</p>

<p>▲ The market situation is very weak. Yesterday, the silver bar mark rose and fell for three days, with quite a lot of changes and stormy waves. The volume was only two or three taels. The market was uneven, with a difference of up to thirteen taels. People's hearts were unusually fragile. Most firms were selling, mostly because the silver market reported a drop, and the United States was still selling. Therefore, the opening was slightly higher. Unexpectedly, U.S. President Hoover planned to open a meeting to rescue the silver market. Generally, large households and speculators suddenly sold off, and the exchange rate became loose and excessive.

Soon after, Zhifengyong, Tianfengyong, Hongliyongfeng, etc. sold off a lot, and sold the spot gold at 1 tael and 6 qian and 4 fen to brokers. The October British gold bank mutual trading at 875, the market was stimulated, fatigue reappeared, and it suddenly fell to 73 taels. At 3:30, because Zheng absorbed the October British gold 875, and the December 9375, Qian Changxiang, Shunli, Wanyu Shunmao, etc. came in. However, the Indian exchange rate was only a large 1 anna, so the price was raised by 3 taels and a half. At 4:20, it was calculated at 6 taels and 6 qian, with a few qian to 1 tael circulating. After that, goods such as Dadecheng, Yu Datong, Taichang, etc. were all sold, and each bank was selling British gold 875, so it fell by 2 taels again.

<h3 id="e95">Rice Market Downstream Slightly Stronger Due to Rainy Weather <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>▲ The rice situation in the South City rose yesterday due to the rainy weather. The shops took the opportunity to add inventory. In the past, the price of rice must be raised before the White Dew Festival. The price of thick japonica, early and late thin indica rice all rose by 1-2 jiao. The sales of new japonica rice are still good and the situation has stabilized. Yanglu sharp rice arrived yesterday and was sold out. The circulation of goods was lacking.</p>
<p>▲ There were not many sources for each gang in Xinzha yesterday, and the transactions on this street were not smooth. The price of northern japonica rice was raised by 1-2 jiao. The arrival of early and late indica rice was also rare, and the Ningbo appetite was small. The fresh and new rice in this city is still active, and the price has also risen slightly. Yanglu sharp rice and Bu sharp rice were even tighter, and the market price rose. The glutinous rice was thin and sold well, and the market rose slightly. Foreign rice customers and local sales were still average, and the market situation was sluggish.</p>

<p>The Price of Origin also Reports Small</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation, there was a slight way out on this street, and the market began to open, but the transaction was very small, only slightly embellishing the market. The price was also slightly tired than before. The opening price of Min Dang 100 bags was 13 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, and the price of small twisted 200 bags was 13 yuan, 7 jiao and a half to 13 yuan, 7 jiao. The futures opening price of small twisted rice in September 300 tons was 6 taels, 5 qian, 2 fen and a half, and 6 taels, 5 qian and 3 fen in October, which was also slightly tired than the previous market. However, the foreign price was still high, and there was no change in the new transaction. The market price of foreign rice in the place of origin was small last night. No. 1 Saigon was only 7 taels, and No. 2 Saigon was 6 taels and 7 qian.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Flour Prices Consistently Decline <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months showed a trend of decline. Although the quoted price of imported wheat rose slightly by two or three cents, the autumn rains were quite heavy, and the decline in imported wheat prices was not very significant, so there was no possibility of excessive decline. However, the market's chips were indeed huge, and the inland buyers' absorption was difficult to sustain. Moreover, manufacturers and related parties, if imported wheat continued to be traded, would have to release it to the market, resulting in more selling than buying, which would destabilize the market. Yesterday, due to the dumping of 200,000 to 300,000 units by small and medium-sized factories and large short sellers, the market situation declined. As a result, this month fell one cent compared to the previous day, October fell one and a half cents, and November to February fell one and seven-eighths cents.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Futures Wheat Market Plummets <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the closing of the futures wheat market in the afternoon, the prices for all months were still stable. Soon, due to a certain factory's active hedging, the market atmosphere became unstable, falling by two or three cents from the opening price. By the afternoon opening, both near-term and far-term contracts showed a straight downward trend. It was rumored that large short sellers related to a certain factory continued to dump heavily, with a huge volume of over 100,000 contracts. On the buying side, due to the limited absorption capacity of inland buyers, it was difficult to support the market, so prices for all months fell sharply across the board. Therefore, if the U.S. wheat relief plan is finalized, the changes will likely be even greater. As a result, this month fell five cents compared to the previous day, October fell five cents, November fell eight cents, December fell seven cents, and February fell six cents. The spot wheat market remained quiet, with only 200 bags of Shuangfeng wheat opened, priced at 3 taels and 6 and a half mace.</p>

<p>Yesterday, raw silk transactions by foreign firms in this port were still difficult to improve. Inquiries to Shanghai factories from New York and other places did not show any improvement. Although the quoted price of raw silk in Lyon rose, telegram inquiries were still rare. Yesterday, only 30 bales of white silk from Anqi and 20 bales of grey silk from Xinfu were imported to Shanghai, and prices remained firm.</p>

<p>▲Handkerchief silk... the first batch of silk tops shipped to Shanghai this year.</p>

They are now on the pier awaiting sale.</p>

<p>Yesterday, green tea transactions from various regions were increasingly brisk. English firms such as Yihe and Xiehe were showing strong interest in goods such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei needles from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Tea prices rose again by five to six taels. The sources of supply from various regions are about to be cut off. The total amount of green tea from the roadside tea shops is only 160,000 to 170,000 boxes, a decrease of 80,000 boxes compared to last year. Chinese tea merchants are adhering to the principle that scarce goods are valuable, and the market sentiment is unanimously upward. As a result, the price of tea in various markets continues to rise sharply.</p>
