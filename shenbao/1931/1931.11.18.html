<p>國聯行政會昨開秘密會議討論兩項試行建議</p>
<p>一、商訂東方洛迦諾條約</p>
<p>二、組委員會監視日出兵</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯理事會今晨十一時二十分開秘密會議、討論東三省事件、中日代表俱未參加、當開會前、美大使道威斯曾與中國施總代表相晤、事後施氏語人、東三省及中日間局勢日益嚴重、經渠竭力陳說後、道威斯大使已表示不擬折衷辦法、渠確知美政府與道威斯大使俱無折衷處置之意、亦不欲將非戰公約擯除於東北危局之外、又道威斯語人、渠與美政府俱未預料有列席理事會之必要、因調解之進步、大半將在私人談話中獲得云云、施道兩氏會晤之後、國聯秘書處即正式發表今日不復舉行公開正式會議、十二理事將繼續秘密談話、中日代表俱不參加、嗣開秘密會議時、聞各理事分組談論、大都集中於兩項試行建議、第一項建議、即（一）商訂東方洛迦諾條約、（二）組織兩中日委員會在東三省及歐洲同時進行工作、商訂東方洛迦諾條約之提議、倘能獲有成議、則將規定類似歐洲諸國所訂洛迦諾公約之條欵、一國侵略則他國合阻之而以中日條約目前狀况爲根據、第二項建議、係國聯秘書處發出、將組織一委員會監視日本撤兵、同時另組一混合委員會在歐洲開會、商定中日條約地位、秘密會議至十二時散會、在明晨以前將不復有會議、又據可靠方面傳出、目下雖已有數種提議交理事考慮、但議長白里安尚未有特别計劃提出、現法理事會在星期五以前、恐未必能商得解决辦法、（十七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今日午後法外部發公報聲稱、理事會將於星期三上午十一時開秘密會議、外間謂此公報、足以表示各理事之秘密會議與私人談話、迄今仍未能有充分進步、足以舉行公開會議、（十七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　當此戰雲砲火瀰漫嫩江橋畔之際、國聯理事會諸公好整以暇、今日下午四時重行開會後、正式會議不過二十四分鐘、繼以一小時半之私人談話、即宣告延會、對於中日問題僅以最簡單之陳述、對於切實解决辦法、并無任何討論、議長白里安建議各代表倣美大使道威斯所創辦法仍各自繼續私行接洽、按道威斯今日早晨遠在理事會開會之前、即定所寓旅邸陸續接見諸大使諸外長及其他代表等交換見解、探測意見、及至理事會在法外部鐘室開幕時、道威斯即完全退居幕後、留於旅館之内、至理事會開會情形已見昨電、當白里安致辭、與西門及浦洛答謝白氏歡迎盛意後、各代表皆同意於白氏之建議、在今夜及明晨仍分頭進行私人談話、俟有充分進步、再開正式會議、會商决定眞正可行之辦法、（十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯理事會今日召集會議、外長白里安所致之開會詞、已失其往日之銳氣、此處報紙皆預料國聯會議所能成就者、爲一種原則上之折衷辦法、此折衷辦法提出後、必將繼以極延長之談判、白里安之演說詞、即可認爲該項折衷辦法之先聲、至其内容若何、則目下尙難明瞭、此處今日外交界有極熱烈之活動、而活動之範圍則集中於法外部、國聯會議散會後、大衆之注意尙盤旋外部之左右也、美國駐英大使道威斯則在幕後活動、道氏雖未參加國聯會議、但彼頗能與國聯協力合作也、（十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　滿洲問題决裂之危險、現已過去、此爲許多人在今日行政會開會後所抱之觀念、蓋以會場内並未言及暗含採用任何方法以實施十月二十四日議案之意也、今日會議公開、但因過分公開、而開會情形反受其累、如攝影機之軋軋聲、電光拍照、渾似砲彈之爆裂聲、及其散出之烟氣、皆令人不寗靜、白里安受此烟氣、引動一陣狂咳、會衆見其勉力撑扎、忍咳發言、代爲痛楚、施肇基博士四時前即到會塲、首先就席、坐於馬蹄形議席之隅、似亟盼會議開始、英外相西門隨衆而入、與芳澤握手時作微笑、美代表未列席、四時六分、白里安正式開會、先歡迎西門與德閣員蒲洛之與會、因此二人初次參加行政會會議也、旋略述行政會上次集會後之滿洲情形、謂十月間之集會、雖未能獲得有關係的雙方對於草議案之同意、然此議案始終有道德上重大關係、施博士在末一次會議後來函聲明中政府决定忠實履行其義務、並願將條約解釋問題提交公斷、但日政府則謂施博士此函、似對於條約效力有所疑問、日政府不允承認此事有何疑念、迨十月二十六日接日本來文、言及五項基本要點、審愼研究之下、覺首四項皆爲行政會議案所包括、至於第四點、即中國承認中日條約事、渠以爲沿照施博士來函所言之輪廓、尙有諒解餘地云、白里安繼言及軍事地位、謂渠接到中政府關於日軍截取中國鹽欵之情報、又接到日政府對於此事之解釋文、雙方皆準備供給渠所請求之消息、渠甚感之、渠於此見兩方皆欲忠實合作、以解决其爭端之表徵云、白里安對於問題中焦點、能扼其要、謂亟須儘速籌思保障日人生命財産安全之計畫、日本早有苟無此種計畫、日本不能改變其態度之聲明、令所難者、在尋覓何者應列入安全題目下耳、日人以爲所爭之根本問題、爲中日間現有條的、尤其是滿洲與鐡路區域條約之尊重、自渠觀之、施博士願將此種條約有效問題提交仲裁一舉、亦可爲雙方稍有好意、即可獲一諒解之理由、雖日本遵守十月二十四日請其於十一月十六日以前撤兵之議案、但日政府已發出現準備尊重其拘束、始終如此之聲明、行政會議繼續致力於中日問題、而不爲任何迎合的建議所左右、行政會决定維護國聯會章原則之尊重云、白里安之演詞譯成他國語後、西門發言表示其能參與商决中日問題及鞏固國聯權勢之滿意、德代表蒲洛繼起發言、大意與西門同、並謂私人談話可使手續便利、因有種種文件尙待研究也、白里安答稱、渠覺此種辦法、大爲有益、故提議秘密會議一次之後、再舉行一次公開會議、此議爲全體所通過、今日之公開會議、遂告完畢、施肇基與芳澤皆未發言、聞係駐英美大使道威斯疏通所致、蓋道威斯以爲雙方如不當衆爭論、則談判較易成功、而西門亦贊同此意也、後即開秘密會議、歷二十分之久、星期三日以前有無公開會議、現尙未定、白里安在秘密會議時聲明、凡行政會會員願討論此事、而對於上次行政會閉會後時事進行表示意思、或提出建議者、渠無不樂聞、最大困難、即在日本所提出五項基本要點之第五項、即中國須承認中日間一切條約是、如此點獲有協定、則解决即可得矣、行政會將繼續努力以始終不偏袒之精神、謀一解决方法、不作草率的判斷、與迎合的批評、行政會唯一志趣、在於尊重國際之義務根據上有和平與公道耳云、施博士略述中國所遇之嚴重事態、力言勿拖延時日、處理此難題之必要、並主張多舉行公開會議、俾儘量宣佈中國意思、芳澤未發言、非公開之會議乃延會、大約明晨尙有一度非公開會議、路透社探悉道威斯將以旁聽員資格參加本星期中此後之行政會會議、各代表旣魚貫而出、芳澤留後與白里安談話、白里安忽中止其談話、而着人往覓施肇基、則施已出外矣、聞西門在巴黎時尙擬與白里安及蒲洛作非正式之談話、商榷德國賠欵及德國所欠短期債欵六萬萬鎊事、惟路透社探悉西門不欲於此時與法政府談判此事、但不過欲於與法政府人員談及此事時探試空氣、聽其意見、而不自發主張耳、西門此次專爲處理中日問題而來、西門在英國新内閣成立時、担任外相席後、即從事研究中日問題之始末、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　午前十一時三十分行政院舉行非公開會議、列席者係中日兩國以外之代表、行政院此次所採手續、與往昔對於類似事件所採者相同、此種會議之目的、在使各方見地、能於客觀環境之中作一對照、苟遇有益之建議即採取之、而當事國無由發生反抗、自不致阻礙進行、白里安午後須赴衆議院參加外交問題之討論、故非公開會議儘於午前舉行、下次開會則定於明日午前十一時、本日秘書長特魯蒙奉命與芳澤及道威斯接洽、一般人印象、行政院在現狀之下、對於九月三十日全體一致通過之决議案、將予以維持、但爲滿足日本要求計、擬於安全問題原有之界說中、加入尊重條約一層、此固不可視爲一種新事實、蓋尊重條約、即所以維持安全、而十月二十五日施博士發表之宣言、亦屬關於尊重條約之鄭重諾言故也、然則此種折中案、一方面旣已注重國聯會之成績、一方面又以雙方當事國之宣言爲基礎、是亦不獲己之辦法云、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今晨開秘密會議之前、道威斯又見松平、對談頗久、昨日施肇基與芳澤有懷欲白、終未發言、蓋從同事之請也、行政會第一次公開會議、雅不願其會務進行即爲雙方正式提出不能融洽的要求所妨害也、白里安之欲私人討論、以待折衷辦法確有把握時再舉行公開會議、亦即此意、聞施博士曾請於昨晚秘密會議時發言、但因白里安之勸告、撤回其請、（十七日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯第三次集會之第一聲</h3>
<p>國際聯盟行政會於十六日已正式第三次集會。世界人士之視聽。今都集中於巴黎。集全世界外交家政治家之焦思苦慮。經兩次會議之辯駁討論。而東北之嚴重局面。迄未得絲毫之展開。兹且第三次集列國外交之能手於巴黎。作第三次之集議。於此誠令吾人深感於公理克服强暴之艱難。</p>
<p>吾人推斷此第三次之會議。决不至再無結果。此結果或者爲公理遂能得伸張。或者爲公理愈被加重其蹂躪。我國愈淪於悲慘之深淵。但就眼前事實之說明。則後者不幸之結局。較前者之可能爲多。截至記者執筆時。巴黎方面所傳來關於國聯會議之消息。尙未見有若何具體之討論。但就中有最足令吾人注意者。則爲各國現都同意於在一種秘密方式之下。進行其工作。</p>
<p>在十六日會議重開之時。代表金元王國之儼然權威者道威斯氏表示。「若爭論國不作公開對峙式辯論。可使進行會議易得較速之結果。」此種主張。立即博得各國代表之同意。而白里安氏在秘密會議中。曾謂「最難解决者爲日方要求之五項基本條件之第五項。即要求中國承認中日一切條約。若此問題解决。則中日事件即可告一段落。」又謂「和平與公正。總須尊重國際條約而完成一。</p>
<p>吾人基於此種事實之顯示。可知國聯今已極厭煩中國代表之嘵嘵辯訴。而以一種靈活之外交手腕。制止中國代表之發言。日軍今儼然據我領土。并繼續擴大其暴行。且其本身處於强者之地位。本無屈可訴。無發言之必要。獨是中國迫於暴力之刦持。國家民族。已置於存亡綫上。而在此純爲維護公理正義之集會中。尙不能一訴其寃屈。此爲一種何等不平之現象。世界人士應都可以明白我國施代表之極短陳說。主張公開會議愈多愈善。以便陳述中國意見之正當。今則我國即欲告哀乞援而亦不可得矣。嗚乎。</p>
<p>至於白里安氏所躊躇之日本要求之第五項。吾人亦不能不預有所聲明。夫國際條約之締立。第一項視其是否基於平等之原則。而後可以確定其遵守之義務。中日間東省一切條約。都爲在一種暴力刦持之下所訂立。尤以二十一條之威脅。更使中國人民痛心疾首。一日不能忘。此項不平條約。其本身已背棄信義。無成立之可能。若欲令中國人民於斯時追予承認。則毋寗認爲中國有甘受日本宰割之義務。吾人誠不信路透所傳白氏態度改變之說。然亦不能不希望白氏能堅持其公理與正義者也。尤有進者。目前最迫切之問題。爲如何制止日軍之暴行。并撤退盤踞於我領土内之日軍。此爲一切問題之先决問題。今國聯對此一先决問題。擱延不决。而居於幕後之美國。且主張應不限定日軍撤退期限。則巴黎今日所盛傳而未揭露之所謂折衷辦法。實不能使人無疑。</p>
<p>然而中國人民今仍未减其信賴國聯之熱忱第三次集會之國聯。究是否能拔救公理與正義於暴力刦持之下。中國人民當暫屏息忍死以觀秘密會議之究竟。</p>

<h3>白里安發表重要談片正在試勸日本代表接受施肇基之聲明</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　白里安今夜向報紙發一談片、希望中日爭執迅速解决、據稱、日本所提撤兵之五要點内、其中四點已不復成爲問題當不致再爲和平解决之障碍、但第五點日本堅持承認現有條約所予一切權益一節、迄今雙方俱無絲毫讓步云云、按中國總代表施博士認此點在談判範圍之外、即討論亦所拒絕、但聞白氏刻正試勸日代表接受施肇基博士十月二十四日在日内瓦關於中國尊重國際條約之聲明、作爲解决此爭點之基礎、至在中日代表團以外則白氏斯議頗爲一般人所贊成、料明日上午各理事非正式談話時、此層當成爲一種有力主張（十六日國民社電）</p>
<h3>迷離惝怳之新道威斯計劃大都迎合日本意旨</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　迷離恍惚之折衷辦法、即所謂「新道威斯計劃」以解决滿洲問題者、今猶活潑潑的存在、今晨愛克賽爾索報稱、道威斯西門松平曾在倫敦討論及此、聞此辦法不規定切實時期、但使日政府於可得日人生命財産保安之條件下撤退其軍隊、同時令中日直接談判、停止軍事行動、此種折衷辦法、雖言者甚多、但迄未提交行政會、所無可疑者、現從事覔取解决辦法者、固皆覺有此相類方案之需要也、道威斯極爲活動、可徵美國對於國聯工作之注意也、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美政府仍持冷靜態度史汀生昨又有訓令致道威斯</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　今晨美國務卿史汀生聲稱、渠已有完備訓令致道威斯、關於中日爭執之發展、與國聯所應採取之步驟等均已詳言、故道氏可無參加理事會實際討論之必要云云、現料華盛頓方面對於中日爭執、在巴黎情勢未有分曉以前、殆將罕有所舉動、惟史汀生與意外相格蘭第談話時、或將非正式論及此事、（十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>紐約講壇報今日揭載美國對日之態度云、國務院一面以堅决之牒文致日政府、宣佈美國贊助國聯勸日撤退佔據滿洲土地之軍隊之努力、一面密告駐華盛頓日大使、謂美國不欲贊助國聯憑藉武力之要求、國聯如對日施行經濟絕交、或召回駐東京外交代表之計畫、美國亦不欲附和之云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>國聯會費我國積欠甚鉅達九百餘萬金佛郎</h3>
<p>倫敦　英外部次官艾登今日在下院稱、各國欠交國聯會費、至一九三○年止、共達一千四百二十六萬四千金佛郎、中國欠九百二十二萬七金佛郎、餘者爲中美南美諸國所欠、各國雖欠交會費、然無損其投票權、國聯不敷之經費、由餘存欵内撥付、國聯秘書長德魯蒙異常注意此事云、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>各國輿論一斑</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日英國各報詳載昨日國聯行政會開會之報告、皆不欲於此時發表批評、惟留心政治者以昨日會議經過平穏、中日雙方代表未有公開爭辯、頗爲釋慮、法國報紙多作批評、最可注意者、爲巴黎晨報一文、謂國聯以其在滿之代表直接行事、較諸過分偏重開會、於事較爲有益、在滿洲衝突尙慮發生之時、徒在巴黎討論國聯會章、殊無益也、應訓令駐遠東之外交代表切實干涉云、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　孟却斯德指導報登載社論、專論遼吉爭端及行政院開會情形、堅稱日本人所採取之態度、實屬破壞國聯會章並違反非戰公約、目前時局且較前此倍形嚴重、該報對於英國保守黨多數機關報加以抨擊、蓋日本暴行已爲清議所不許、而保守黨機關報反欲爲之辯護、日本不察、以爲英國代表團改變態度、或不堅請行政院採取所有手段藉以平息中日爭端、則謬矣云云、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　德報論調、對於東三省事件、雖仍力求維持完全中立、但其多數晨報今日評論、巴黎國聯理事會之希望、已有一種意見、以爲當十月底時世界輿論正集矢於日、今則日本地位已有顯著進步、如福錫志報社論可以概見、據稱、大半理事會今已切實袒日、其袒日之程度、正與在日内瓦時反日之程度不相上下、至變更態度原因、一由景象之轉移、二由各大國政府已有廻省時間深覺日本在明年軍縮大會内居於重要地位、各國必不可結怨於日、至德國態度、該報以爲德在遠東無政治利益、但在東三省有鉅大經濟利益、今已大受打擊、故將盡力謀中日爭執之迅速公允解决、德當始終秉此方針、不爲外界所轉移云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　巴黎晨報今晨評論理事會和平解决中日爭執之希望、謂理事會行動當不致出於十月二十四日决議範圍之外、會章十五與十六欵之提出、其勢不成問題、該報以爲終可覔得一折衷辦法、或者即以道威斯正在草擬之計劃爲根據、至道威斯計劃之内容、則該報猶未知其詳、但稱國聯中人多信其可行云云、此間人士對於昨夜白里安與蘇俄駐法大使杜加萊夫斯基之會晤、頗爲注意、此項談話未有公報發表、但當道亦嘗否認兩人所談爲東三省糾紛及蘇俄對日態度云、（十七日國民社電）</p>

<p>（柏林）　國民黨機關報對於溥儀在滿洲稱帝、加以評論、略云、此舉足使中日爭端爲之改變面目、瀋陽方面日益多事、日本自必快意、但溥儀稱帝、端賴日本助力、日本對於溥儀亦願久於其位、惟有此而日本在滿洲之軍事行動、乃有理由可言也、（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>日本對於東北問題之謬論（三）</h3>
<p>爲最後之克服而前進　阿部氏</p>
<p>目前我們已臨到「國難當前」的嚴重時期了、但國人的精神、此時仍未臻於十分之緊張、大部分的同胞對於中國問題的本質、没有把握、也不曾理解、因爲此一問題之解决、需要相當時日、所以在這時期中、必須將這問題的本質、澈底的印入國民的腦筋中、而使他們知道、此時誠已爲「國難當前」之嚴重時期、舉國一致的緊張起來、這是當前的第一要圖、有一部份人對於此次事件、認爲國際聯盟易於對付、或且認爲此一問題將無若何之艱難、但爲了我國的生存、我們可以擔承任何犧牲、忍受任何苦痛、但解决此一問題最重要之點、在於應趁這機會、站在我們國家的立塲上、將滿蒙權益的特殊性、對國際聯盟詳細的說明、而使其理解、對於國聯的主張、應儘可能的尊重、而不必和中國進行直接交涉、我們不可漠視聯盟、假如我們能如此進行、中國未必拒絕我們的主張、如其我們已做到如此地步、而中國仍是如現在一樣的暴戾態度、則已實在達到訴諸最後的手段的時候了、此時日本國民國際以及全世界都十分理解了日本的立塲、便可以澈底的解决多年的懸案了、我們等待此一時機到來然後發動、决不爲晚、現在因滿洲事件而引起的排貨運動、不消說我國的工商業受着絕大的打擊、但此非我們目前所應着意討論、我們應爲這最後之克服而突進、單就棉製品來說、因此一物爲中國的必需品、對於棉製品之排斥、不僅日本受痛苦、中國所受之痛苦或更加大、因此我們懷疑這排斥日貨運動是否果眞長久支持、但是就現在的狀態看來、排日運動决不會很快的終止、所以我們非得要努力求其解决不可、</p>
<p>時機來了安宅氏斬斷一切的禍根國論已經一致了</p>
<p>關於滿蒙的權益的條約、現在已被蹂躪殆盡、日本兹已忍無可忍了、在這時候若仍不能予以解决、那將永無解决之時機、我們雖擁有許多權益、但因爲多年遭受壓迫、陷於不能享受這當然的權益的狀態中、尤其是對於住在滿洲的朝鮮人的壓迫、簡直是難以言語形容現在國論已經一致了、此時再不能持怯懦軟弱的手段了、應以斷然的手段、澈底的幹下去、臨到這重大時機的國民、還格外鎭靜、不作無謂的騷擾、這是「大國民」的態度、决不是對這問題不關心的表現、就目前國際聯盟的態度而觀察、我們不能不奮起以應付迫近的危機、有一部份對於中國有利害關係的人、常發表格外軟弱的意見、這雖說能得到相安於一時的狀態、但其結果必留下永久的禍根、所以我想這個時候、正是剷除一切禍根的絕好的時機、</p>
<p>「還價」是中國特有的國民性</p>
<p>大連代表高田氏</p>
<p>我在滿洲和中國人交易已有二十七年、對於物件的價值的必須還價、是中國人共同的買賣心理、而這心理在外交政治上亦充分表現、舉其實證、即中國在國際聯盟中的態度、以及對於美國的外交態度、即是「還價」的買賣心理的表現、所以對華外交、若不能得此一種國民性、必致失敗、我希望我國在現在解决多年懸案的時機、應將此種國民性常置念中、</p>
<p>尙容等待友邦的出現嗎飯島氏</p>
<p>承高柳主席指示我們中國排日問題與滿蒙問題爲同一問題又拜聽了蘇峯先生滿洲不是中國領土的高見、可是這兩個問題果然是調和的嗎、由現在的狀况看來、滿洲事件與中日鬥爭若不解决、排日是不會停止的、假使在滿洲日本有某種程度的讓步、排日運動或能稍爲緩和、這中間難道没有若何的因果關係嗎、對中國有直接利害的實業家諸君、當然希望排日運動很快的終止、但是日本對於中國全體的經濟關係與滿洲局部的利害問題比較起來、這兩個問題便很顯明的不是一個問題了、有許多人說「排貨」是中日雙方的苦痛、不能長久支持、但是我以爲到達那種程度、不必還須經歷相當時日、雙方刻正對此運動之進行與應付、作進一步的縝密的考察、故此運動刻尙無轉換方向之可能、先前拜領了末廣博士先出兵而後窺探列國的態度、另一方面與美國及其他列强結合友邦關係的意見、我以爲對華問題的解决、我們或許不能得一友邦、我想這是值得我們深深考慮的問題、</p>
<p>我同意并欽佩澈底解决的意見</p>
<p>但應防止步調混亂矢野氏</p>
<p>這回的事件已與國際聯盟及美國發生重大的關係、其前途如何、不見得不是以國運相賭的大問題了、大阪的商工業諸君、對此問題都有澈底解决的决心、這是我所極其同意、并極其欽佩的、此一同時、英國停止金本位制度、這個也將會成爲世界的重大問題、因受此一波浪之影響、故我們對於中國經濟上的問題、極難解决、在這二大難局的當頭、工商業者各在自己的立塲上、注重其本身的利害關係、所以我深懼在此國難之中、國人步調混亂、我們鑑於滿蒙問題的重要性、應各自愼重的考慮着、好好的幹去罷、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>遼東變起。暴日不顧公論。强佔營口各地。客有自營口歸者。爲述所見。其種種慘酷行爲。令人髮竪眥裂。日兵巡行街道。托辭亂民騷動。特來保護僑民。雜持治安。每出必四人結隊而行。横持上刺刀之槍。行人偶不經意。行近其旁。即將槍刺亂刺。稍加抵抗。拘入司令部。治以極刑。倘忍痛而遁。該兵目逆而哂。以示得意。凡遇衣西裝長袍者。尤加注意。如四五人在街道閒談。即遭槍擊。惟破衣垢面之苦力。則待之甚寬。其意謂若輩毫無知識。不足畏也。各商店雖經日司令出示。照常營業。然市面蕭條。終日無一顧問者。即居民亦閉户伏處。不敢越雷池一步。豪富之家。遷避一空。其稍有積蓄者。亦大半化裝遠遁。滿目荒凉之態。見者都爲之泣數行下。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>佛蘭克林（五）</h3>
<p>小徒弟列傳之一</p>
<p>一七三六年一位蘇格蘭修道士名呌戈登Gordon的，在德國發明了一個電鈴：兩邊各安一鈴，中間懸一絲線掛的金屬球，球感了電即依同性相拒異性相吸的理，將鈴繼續的打起來。他還發現電感的水能把火酒燒起來。</p>
<p>在這些零星的發明中，忽然跑出一個奇妙的來頓瓶。oLeyden　Jar一七四五年克來斯特Dean　Von　Rleist，一七四六年范麥聖布洛克Pieter　Van　Musschenbrock，各自發現了可以用玻璃瓶將摩擦的電儲蓄起來。因爲來克斯特是住在荷蘭國，來頓城，所以這瓶就呌做來頓瓶。其實依創製之先後，這榮譽是給錯了地方。先是用水在玻璃瓶裏蓄電，後來瓦曾Watson將瓶改良，用錫箔在瓶内瓶外對着貼起來代替水，格外有效。法國諾列Abbe　Nollet呌皇帝的侍衛軍一連人手拉手的站在那兒，組成電路，只要來頓瓶所儲蓄的大量的電一接上，這些兵便同時一齊打倒。</p>
<p>這些是佛蘭克林未上電氣舞臺前，人類所已經得到的關於人造電的知識。這時天空之電與人造之電是否相同，尙無證明：天空之電是當做神秘瞎猜；人造之電是摩擦着玩耍。</p>
<h3>紀客談倭國之軍人</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>暴倭之侵陵我華者。令人髮指而眦裂。戰氛醖釀。鼙鼓日亟。孫子云。知己知彼。百戰不殆。然則倭國軍人之究何若。當爲我人之所宜知。我友洪君左肩。旅倭有年。熟悉彼邦情形。一昨爲談倭國之徵兵制。按之法例。凡屬國民。俱有當兵之義務。故其民庶。大都受有相當之軍事敎育。即婦女亦無不有看護之學識。男丁二十一歲至二十四歲。此三年爲當兵之期。除殘肢病體外。不得或免。二十四歲後。則爲後備軍人。國家遇有危急。仍得召赴疆塲而効命。當軍人之出征也。無不以戰死爲榮。家家門上。徧貼標紙。一若我國獻歲之桃符然。　、其標紙則什九爲「祈戰死」三字。雄壯激烈。求諸泰西。不多覯也。每一軍人。每日所獲餉銀祗七銅圓。似甚儉苦。然膳食住宿。以及沐浴理髮之微。均由營中供給。　、不費分鈔。烟捲餌果。即出代價。亦絕低廉。爲外界所未有。蓋國家專以廉值之物品。以供軍人享用者也。並於附近軍壘處。倣我國漢時營妓之法。設有軍娼。以待軍士之無妻者。娼有醫官檢騐。有梅毒症者。立撤之。軍人出夜度貲五角。得以永夕綢繆。極陰陽配合之樂。凡此種種。皆所以慰藉軍人之勞苦者也。義務如彼。權利又如此。故一旦有變。無不以身許國。抱馬革裹屍之决心。精銳奮勇。非百戰之師不克敵。所病者。則自一戰勝俄。將士驕揚。往往有輕蹈易涉之舉。語云。驕必敗。我國士卒得能利用其驕而攻制之。則庶有殲仇滅寇之望乎。</p>
<h3>小學生之義憤</h3>
<p>暴日專横。佔我遼吉。凡有血氣之倫。莫不眥裂。上海樹人院小學生王圭璋王和章姊弟二人。經袁明山先生訓導。義憤塡胸。竟欲罷學從軍。其實黄口孺子。力不足以搏鷄。經其父母勸慰力阻方止。爰將平日所蓄筆墨點心之餘欵。合足大洋八十元。托人轉匯黑龍江。犒勞馬占山將軍及其軍隊。并願將乃父所賞國文獎金。合大洋四十元移助建築韓光第將軍之紀念塔。讀者讀至此。應如何聞風興起乎。</p>
<h3>董君生壙誌</h3>
<p>— 周樹奎</p>
<p>董君芝初。名浩。淛江鄞縣人。孫清誥授武翼都尉。花翎。參將。炳生公長子也。天性肫摯。能親其親。温清不愆。孝思無匱。參將公。管帶測海金甌等兵艦於長江上游。兼帶江南製造局練勇。吳頭楚尾。君恒僕僕於二親之間。蹀躞庭幃。以取容說。參將公之卒。年五十有二。後三十載。妣氏陳太淑人繼殂。綜君生平。事母之年。修於事父之日。而生事葬祭。亦易亦戚。前喪後喪。皆克衷禮。族䣊歸美焉。君善居致。又嫺警察學。仕宦貨殖。足迹半中國。歷大江南北。遠躡嶺表。所至傾動。爭納交董君。超然俊人勝流也。好酒妉飲。齦齦斗石。以婁釂角勝負。歡塲酒所。拇戰讙譁。聲震梁梠。至酩酊無悔。酒人咸多之。奉爲渠率。用是婁嬰疾病。尋納醫者言。擯不復飲。然豪情勝概。不減疇曩。儕輩讌集。猶非君勿懽。雖止酒亦必邀致之。興之所騁。亦一破戒。惟不縱耳。君豪於飲。亦果於行。任事敢爲。不卹勞怨。急人如己。惟恐後時。蓋於飲德覘之矣。有弟三人。源。湘。洪。源。湘。皆後先不禄。獨與季洪。相依爲命。卵翼臻至。民紀二十年秋。君將爲元配何孺人營葬。即地穿穴。規度陰陽。自治生壙。爲身後計。其繼室韓孺人。他日亦將祔焉。達哉有趙岐司空圖遺風矣。工旣竣。屬樹奎爲誌。乃書其崖略如上方。勒諸佳城之貞珉。</p>
<h3>明星攝影隊歸途訪問記</h3>
<p>— 渭賓</p>
<p>明星影片公司爲攝製「啼笑因緣」影片外景。於九月中旬由導演張石川君偕同全劇主要演員及攝影技師等一行三十餘人。赴北平實地攝取眞景。歷時兩閱月。始於昨日返申。愚就訪問所及。筆之如次。</p>
<p>北平自國都南遷。氣象丕變。昔日豪華。今已不復存在。平民生活程度。亦較上海爲低。例如雇汽車一輛。值此金價昻貴之秋。每小時僅須一元二角足矣。以此推想。其他可知。</p>
<p>平地氣候亢爽。塵沙彌漫。初到時感於乾燥太甚。皮膚都起裂紋。尤以諸女星感受痛苦爲更甚。然一星期後。亦覺安之若素矣。</p>
<p>攝影工作。在北平最爲適宜。因雨水稀少。陽光朗澈。絕少陰霾晦遲之色。尤以攝製五彩片爲更佳。加以故宫遺址。莊嚴宏偉。西山翠微山岡巒起伏。風景攸宜。其一種雄秀之氣。逈非南中所有。取作電影背景。益覺恰當。</p>
<p>各演員每日工作之餘。四出採辦物品。以便歸貽親友。所購除食品而外。以古董皮貨兩項爲大宗。皮貨人購有兩三件。取其物美價廉也。某君購文虎章多枚。云每枚價一二元。昔日榮獎之品。今等玩具。其中亦有小小滄桑也。女明星所購翠玉指環圈鐲等飾物綦夥。莫不喜形於色。</p>
<p>一夕。光陸影戲院適開映明星公司之第二部有聲片「如此天堂」。時距開映尙早。胡蝶以宵來無事。偕夏佩珍龔稼農至該院觀光。坐尙未定。爲觀衆所見。一時視綫集中。大有飽餐秀色。百看不厭之勢。於以見舊都人士醉心明星之甚矣。</p>
<p>歸途乘十日通車。途經天津。正值日寇肆虐。風鶴遙傳。人心惶惑。司機者開足速力。不稍滯遲。且恐日軍窺及燈先。乃將全車電炬熄滅。直至車過楊柳青。始得車見光明。人心亦於是稍安矣。</p>
<h3>冠蓋之交</h3>
<p>— 徐碧波</p>
<p>十三日本欄。刋有不才招換呢帽之啓事。復於翌日在快活林中。發表一文。爲「陞冠别紀」後。即有邱子嘉君。倩其友持敝帽如址見訪。果得各歸原主。惟不才有云。「當以返諸落帽孟嘉」。今易帽者之大名。適具一嘉字。天下離奇巧合之事。誠有匪夷所思者。</p>
<p>當易帽時。趙君還吾在旁。余復笑謂之曰。還吾（雙解）此眞所謂冠蓋之交矣。但冠蓋宜作實字解。不敢冒充爲代名詞耳。因相與粲然。</p>
<p>邱友座次適傍於廣告部。見某君正在撰八集荒江女俠影片告白。因曰。此劇即前晚席間。英武秀拔之徐琴芳女士主演者乎。余曰然。遂檢予參觀券二。渠足恭爲謝。歡然道别。余送至電梯口。入室。得「冠蓋獲相交。斯人未憔悴。」兩句。書以示漪。想亦當莞爾也。（酬資助振）</p>
<h3>故都聞見録</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>騾車</p>
<p>竹葉亭雜記云。京城騾車近多踵事增華。即買賣車之站口跑海者。褎幃亦有綢綾。窗亦有玻璃矣。（市中製車供人雇用曰買賣車。終日置胡同口得價方行曰站口。東西奔走莫定曰跑海。）額約齋司農云。乾隆初祗有驢車。其先德農中丞起初在部當差時。猶只驢車。惟劉文正有一白馬車。人見白馬車即知劉中堂來矣。自川運例開。騾車始出。其時名騾車爲川運車。適讀吾鄕劉海峯徵君贈姚道冲歸里詩。有騾車日日穿胡同句。道冲爲余叔高祖。名孔鋅。以雍正戊申保舉人才來京。然則騾車雍正時已有之矣。大興金春甫克諧云。乾隆三十年後。京中惟馬車漸多。騾車尙罕見。蓋前此或有。自川運始盛行也。車之有旁門。則紀文達始創也。車旁開門碍於轉軸。於是將輪移後。始有後攩之製。據此則先有馬車而後有騾車。</p>
<p>光緒三十年以後。都中始有出賃歐式馬車者。前此南人入都。無不以乘騾車爲苦。蓋乘者須結跏趺。剛輪擊石。車輒左右震蕩。觸額每墳起若瘤。又其行至緩。正陽門外。胡同狹隘。前後魚貫。不得爭先。一有阻滯。動經晷刻。其名曰岔車。大抵朝出訪客。必抵暮始能歸。故彼時内外城隔絕殊甚。滿人居内城者。甚至半生未至外城。居東城者。亦經年不至西城。熟於故都土著之語者。輒謂東西南北城語音各異。凡以此也。惟後攩車稍舒適。然非達官莫敢御。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（二十）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>他此刻也不肯再來做什麽和事老了。還是再坐車子到梅蘭坊去，尋他的外甥阿木林。他向東首跑過去，却見那邊站着幾位打扮得花枝招展的姑娘。粉拍得比牆壁還要白；胭脂擦得比紅房子還要紅；嘴唇像盂蘭勝會裏的鬼王，一張血盆大口；頭髮似滑油山裏的夜叉小鬼，披頭散髮。長的好似帳竿竹；矮的好似紹興甏；胖的好似打氣的糖人；瘦的好似油煎的猢狲。閙閙嚷嚷，都擠在一塊兒。</p>
<p>鄕下人瞥見在一位姑娘的褲脚邊，有一團紙，引着了一團火，將要燒着伊的褲管了。他想：救火比了什麽都要緊。現在那位姑娘火已燒到了屁股跟頭了，伊還是從容不迫，這個鎭靜功夫倒也不小。我非拉開伊不可。他便三脚兩步的奔上去，把那位姑娘亂推亂揉，兩脚把一團火亂踏，口裏却亂嚷道：</p>
<p>「火！火！火！」</p>
<p>那個姑娘也被他嚇昏了。</p>
<p>「阿唷喂！要死呀！你做什麽啥！」那位姑娘嚷出發急的江北聲音來了。</p>
<p>「火燒到了腿肚子上來了，你還不覺得發燙嗎？」</p>
<p>鄕下人倒是正言厲色，但是那位姑娘却以爲這個鄕下人給伊打岔，伊就破口大駡道；</p>
<p>「你這老殺千刀的！誰要你管什麽閑事。我們正在燒路頭，却被你踏熄了，你不是觸我們的霉頭嗎？今天拉不到客人，要算你的賬。你這老殺千刀的，不放你過門。」</p>
<p>說時，那位姑娘窮兇極惡的，便把鄕下人一把拖住了，鄕下人那時正莫名其妙。</p>
<p>「我是好意呀！你的火不是燒到腿上來了，你又没穿襪子，火是要攻心的咧。」</p>
<p>「誰說我没有穿襪子啥？你只是放屁亂說。」那位姑娘抬起一雙腿來，給鄕下人瞧。</p>
<p>原來鄕下人没有瞧清楚。近來上海的姑娘們，流行穿一種肉色絲襪。旣然是肉色的，當然和肉的顔色是一般的了。鄕下人的眼睛有些不大子細，穿肉色絲襪的人，都以爲没有穿襪子。穿了長統絲襪的姑娘們，他還以爲他們没有穿褲子咧。現在那位姑娘抬起腿來，他方纔看出是穿了一雙和肉一色的襪。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>一九三二年式英國斯旦達新車概况</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>一九三二年式斯旦達新車式樣共計四種。即斯旦達二十號。十六號。大九號。及至足驚羨之小九號是也。其搆造之安全舒適。效用之宏偉卓絕。與夫價格及駕駛費用之低廉等。無不出色當行。宜其確切適合於現代經濟狀况。而爲汽車界中最爲一般人所需要。抑且最爲人所信仰之車輛。按斯旦達新車所以臻此佳境。蓋以製造廠家。本其二十八年來精造汽車之經騐。與研究改善耗費已經數千萬鎊之金錢由最精細之設計專家。與最著名之工程技師。聚精會神。精益求精。而後製成故耳。此項新車。所具種種特色。不一而足。兹特以其犖犖大者。略述如次。</p>
<p>一、價格僅同小車舒適却似大車　斯旦達新車所具種種特色。類皆尋常小汽車之所無。而惟價值高昻之大車有之者。即各裝於後方稱臻安全之汽油池。半椭圓形彈簧裝置。以及前後吸震器。大號鋼絲輪。保障玻屏風等。無不美備。然雖有此種種特優設備。而其售價之低。則殊出乎意表。斯蓋確能充分滿足公衆需要之新出品也。</p>
<p>一、駕駛費用特别廉省無論設計也。構造也。斯旦達新車對於駕駛費用方面。無不充分注意。悉心研究。藉使其彌極經濟合算。即以汽油消耗言之。其廉省程度。實非同樣舒適。同樣效能。其餘任何種車輛。所可冀及。</p>
<p>一、駕駛管理簡捷便易關於車主親自駕駛之便利與安適。斯旦達新車蓋已考慮周詳。竭全力以圖之矣。按斯旦達新車所以爲宜於婦女駕駛之。最優美車輛者。此蓋諸大原因中之一也。其管理機關與力量充足之塞車等。無不簡便靈效。運用自如。一經駕駛。自可享受乘車之無上樂趣。</p>
<p>車身構造堅優罕見之斯旦　達新車車身。堅强鞏固。寬敞舒適。無論路面若何惡劣。車行其上。絕無巔簸震撼。或軋軋作響之虞。至於選料精優。漆飾美觀。自不待言。其他四擋速度齒輪箱。新式水箱頭。以及活動車頂等。胥足使購者彌極滿意。而活動車頂。尤足使人稱道不置。蓋旣可用作精巧舒適保護週密之轎車。藉以避免風寒雨雪。復可用作篷式車輛。藉以流通空氣與日光。且此種啓閉車頂之裝置。極簡單巧妙之至。雖值行車之際。亦可隨意啓閉焉。本埠靜安寺路七零二號中國汽車公司爲英國斯旦達汽車公司駐華獨家經理者。歷有年所。兹據該公司聲稱。斯旦達新車第一批將於日内到滬云。</p>
<h3>今年銷車數量</h3>
<p>— 頌</p>
<p>在二·○○○·○○○輛之上</p>
<p>汽車事業之盛衰。有關於經濟之轉移甚鉅。美國向以造車名於世。一年所産生之汽車。佔全世界之最大部份。向執全球汽車製造之牛耳。但今年因世界經濟發生極大之恐慌。金價暴跌。百工失業。影響於造車事業旣鉅且大。不可勝言。故今年即一九三一年之美洲之汽車製造業。其受經濟衰落之打擊。亦殊令人注意也。除美國而外。等而下之。則有歐洲之英吉利·法蘭西·意大利等。其汽車製造事業亦佔實業界之重要地位。就中尤以英吉利爲更甚。此三國之汽車製造業。以今年之成績觀之。並無若何之重大發展。是以述及全世界之汽車製造業。今年一九三一年之紀録。殆無足以驚人者在也。</p>
<p>據地屈立屋傳來消息。一九三一年之美國摩托車總銷數。將超過二·○○○·○○○輛。但有一事爲歷年以來所未見者。此事維何。即客車之購買其數目將跌至此數量之下也。此項結果現由商業統計專家卜克公司加以預測。渠最初之估計。客車一項今年之註册數當爲一·八七五·○○○輛。及至年中估計。則客車一項其數目將屆二·○三六·○○○輛云。</p>
<p>除客車而外其次當述商用運貨車。此項車輛常年之銷數。往往不致大相懸殊。故一九三一年之商用運貨車銷數亦未見有若何重大之低跌。據目下預計。一九三一年之運貨汽車銷數。在三二○·○○○輛或三三○·○○○輛之間。據卜克公司之估計今年即一九三一年之運貨汽車銷數以視往年實已低落若干成矣。若與一九三零年即去年相比較。其所差成數爲百分之二二·三一。至於客車之低落百分成數。以一九三一年與一九三零年相較乃爲百分之二七·六七成一九三一年之各種汽車銷數。目下預估爲二·一九五·○○○輛至二·二○○·○○○之間。其大體上實較去年爲低落是也。</p>
<p>關於各種汽車銷售之數。如加以詳細之分析。頗有意外之趣味。可供參考用。照今年之銷車數量而言遠不若奢侈式及高價。式者之甚也。今年高價車之銷數以視一九三零年。其低落成數約爲百分之三十。奢侈車之低落成數與去年相較。乃爲百分之三十二。若中價車則低落之成數遠不若高價及奢侈兩者之鉅。其所差不過百分之十九已耳。</p>
<p>一九一三年之各種汽車銷數已如上述讀者於今昨二年間之汽車銷售消長當已有一大概之印象矣。今姑將關於引擎方面之發明及改革略述於此。關於汽車引擎之改進。日新月異。不時不在改進之中。今年汽車製造界又有新貢獻一種。業已問世。此項新引擎具有巨大之發動力。其馬力爲二百四十五匹。汽缸之數目爲十二只。但此種式樣之引擎並不作爲客車裝置之用。良以普通駕駛之客車。但求平穏已足。固無須乎若是之鉅大力量也。此項引擎之裝置聞最宜於消防車之用。載量甚重。而駛行時仍極迅速。每小時之速率。約在六十英里左右。而其加速時之度數。又與普通私通小汽車相仿。誠極新頴便捷者也。美法公司對於汽缸之改革亦有新的發展。現在計劃中之雙倍汽缸引擎。其裝置之角度爲三十度。式樣方面殊稱别緻云。</p>
<p>邇來各汽車製造廠因出産低落。羣策減政之方。此亦無可諱言者。惟當局之意。苟稍有辦法。則辭退工人一舉。决不令之實現。關於此事在地屈立屋。盛傳已久。且有事實可以證明。即製造雪佛蘭汽車之工人。其數目現在仍爲三○·○○○人。以與今年開始工作時相較。幾無差别。然當時該廠之汽車出産數目。較之現在所增幾及一倍也。别克廠於九月中因整理財産目録。暫停一月。目下已經復工矣。第伏克斯牌汽車。製造上亦有若干革新之處。頗關重要。除早經宣佈之自由輪裝置外。引擎方面採用橡皮墊器。以减少動作時之聲息。其他如車身式樣之改善。及舒適方面之改良。均所顧到者云。</p>
<h3>推銷聲中之雪鐡龍</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>廠家代表搿爾波氏之談話</p>
<p>法國雪鐡龍汽車製造廠主人雪鐡龍氏之至友搿爾波君。爲雪氏營業方面之得力助手。君曾代表廠方。迭作環球旅行。以努力從事於促進廠方之業務。頃者搿君復於日前行抵此間。據君自稱。此行實更有重大意義在。蓋决意擴充雪鐡龍汽車於遠東方面之活動範圍也。今聞搿君業已開始實行其偉大推銷計畫矣。</p>
<p>搿君自與其摯友合作以來。旅行全球。已經十次。此番抵申。對於上海之以中國汽車市塲而言之佔有重要性。曾臚列事實藉作證明。搿君略謂上海進口汽車輛數。實佔全國進口汽車總額五分之二。計一九二八年份。進口汽車凡四一零三輛。其中運銷上海者。達一六六一輛。一九二九年度進口總額八八七九輛。上海佔三七七七輛。一九三零年份進口總額四四四八輛。上海則佔一八六六輛。至現在遠東方面所銷之雪鐡龍汽車。總計約近十萬輛。現法國最享盛名之汽車廠。正擬竭其全力。以與英美製造廠家相競爭。冀於中國市塲獲得勝利焉。按法國因經濟地位之優越。故所蒙世界衰落影響。未若英美等國之甚。至其營業方面。雖亦不無損害。但人各有其業。而商家對於前途之希望。且極確切信任焉。即以汽車業而論。一九三一年度蓋較愈於一九三零年也。預計一九三二年之末。法國境内各種汽車之銷數當達二百萬輛。此蓋於其每年銷數增加百分之十五。可以覘之者。至於一九三零年份之汽車輛數。爲一百五十二萬零五百零一輛。所佔世界各國汽車輛數之位置。蓋僅次於英美兩國耳。斯年出産總額二五五一一一輛。運銷國外者爲三一一五八輛。至别國汽車之銷行法國者僅七八一輛。默察趨勢。此種進口數量。且將有减無增焉。考外貨所以不能暢銷法境者。誠以法國汽車價旣低落。而法國汽車廠家。且精益求精。邁進無已故也。當一九三零年時。法國居民每二十七人中有客車一輛。每一百人中有運貨車一輛。斯年汽車産額爲每日七百五十輛。出口數量佔第八位。價值一三三五四八五○○○法郎。搿君并稱雪鐡</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>龍氏近在巴黎語人。謂彼認爲於中國方面努力活動之時機已屆成熟。目下雪鐡龍汽車式樣。雖僅四缸與六缸兩種。但皆爲尺寸十足之車輛。其引擎仍甚經濟。而其機力則大增加。藉以適應世界市塲之需要。至於車身線紋。則尤特别注意。彌極美妙。除此之外。雪鐡龍并製有長輪基之兩噸運貨車。以備適用於公共汽車服務焉。搿君末謂以「歐洲之福特」著名於世之雪鐡龍氏。常作美洲之行。今方勾留彼邦。蓋與美國製造廠家及工程師等。互相研討關於汽車業方面之種種最新進展也。</p>

<h3>汽車瀛聞</h3>
<p>— 甘</p>

<h3>寗夏公路修築實况</h3>
<p>— 浪</p>
<p>寗夏地處邊陲。交通梗阻。民十四以後。雖有汽車公路之修築。只因溝渠縱横。湖沼頗多。並未建修完善。以故每當夏令灌田之際。渠水汜濫。水即淹漫路基。濘泥徧道。行者不免有繞道之苦。自十八年改建行省。建設廳歷年起夫修築。又爲路基堅固計。於汽大各道。派員測量路綫。計畫工程。分期進行。特因事變層出。中輟數次。現在雖未臻十分完美。而行駛尙無阻碍。兹將計畫及修築經過各情。分述於後。</p>
<p>（甲）關於三大幹綫者　（一）由寗夏省城至綏遠之包頭爲寗包路。該路由省城至磴口一段。計長三百九十里。路幅爲十二公尺。此段由省城經李崗堡平羅縣城。修築極平。由石咀山磴口縣城至大灘。入綏遠境略遜。由石咀山至三盛公一段。沿途多係沙漠。如欲無阻。須渡河由東岸行。較爲省事。（二）由寗夏省城至甘肅省城爲寗蘭路。該路由省城至中衛一段。計長三百九十里。路幅爲十二公尺。該路由省城經葉昇堡大壩廣武石空等地至中衛縣城。過營盤水。入甘肅境。但由省城至大壩。路面平坦。由大壩至廣武。有小沙嶺横互。亦無阻碍。由此直達中衛縣城均平坦。惟由營盤水至沙坡頭一碗泉。則沙窩極大。不易通行。故此路當以由石空渡河至寗安堡。再由該堡入山河溝。經新堡子川至靖遠而達蘭州。較爲平坦。不過夏令山河溝山水甚大。爲可慮耳。（三）由寗夏省城至甘肅之平凉爲寗平路。該路在寗境者。由省城至豫旺之李旺堡一段。計長五百七十里。路幅爲十二公尺。此路由省城至石空。情形同前。渡黄河。經寗安堡同心城。至李旺堡。沿途由寗安堡至李旺堡一段。多係山坡溝濠。地勢起伏不一。尙未修築完善。</p>
<p>（乙）關於四大支線者　（一）由省城至鹽池者爲寗鹽路。計長三百一十里。沿途經横城水洞溝清水營沙坑牛毛井至鹽池。此段由省至横城尙好。由横城至鹽池一段。道路崎嶇。沙漠横互。正在計議興修中。（二）由省城至靈武者爲寗靈路。計長一百里。該路由王洪堡渡黄河至靈武。沿途地勢平坦。惟溝渠縱横。橋梁甚多。亦正在擬議修築期間。（三）由省城至豫旺者爲寗豫路。計長四百六十里。沿途經吳忠堡石溝堡葦州至豫旺。由省城至吳堡一段。業已修築平坦。此外多沙漠山坡溝壕。尙未興修。（四）由省城至定遠營者爲寗定路。計長一百二十里。經寗翔縣城逾賀蘭山。至定遠營。但由省城至山根之一段四十餘里。已修理平坦。由山口至定遠營。溝道險竣。地勢起伏不一。尙未修築。以上三大幹線。現已興修三次。路面尙好。其曲度有易於改者。皆取爲直率。事實上有種種困難情形者。仍依原形修築。但此線雖能通行汽車。祗以與其大車道混合。不免時有碾壞之虞。俟將來庫欵充裕。照計畫測定路線。將汽車道與大車道分開修築。與交通上更覺便利也。至上述四大支線。將來由建設廳直接修築。或由各縣縣政府及建設局修築。逐漸進行。則寗省交通。不難蒸蒸日上也。</p>

<p>League of Nations Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss Two Proposed Pilot Suggestions</p>
<h3>Our Troops Bravely Resist Amidst Raging Wind</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Take Advantage of the Wind to Fiercely Assault; Our Troops Emerge from Trenches to Resist</p>
<p>Both Sides Engage in an Hour of Hand-to-Hand Combat; Enemy Troops Finally Retreat, Unable to Sustain</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 2:17 PM on the 16th, approximately 300 Japanese cavalry and over 1,000 infantry and artillery soldiers attacked Sanjianfang, Xinlitun, and Sanjiazi along our infantry and cavalry's right flank defense line. The wind was fierce, sand and dust obscured the sky, and the smoke from the exploding shells rose several dozen feet. The Japanese troops took advantage of this, launching a fierce assault. Supported by artillery fire, the cavalry and infantry advanced with bayonets fixed, charging towards our trenches. Our troops emerged from the trenches to engage, and the enemy and our forces were locked in a melee. After nearly an hour of hand-to-hand combat, four Japanese aircraft arrived to drop bombs. However, due to the strong wind, the pilots could not maneuver as desired. More than thirty bombs were dropped, but they had little effect. After 3 PM, our lines gradually solidified. Supported by mortar and machine gun squads, two cavalry and infantry detachments launched a flanking maneuver from the left and right. The enemy troops, fearing encirclement, used machine guns as a rearguard and retreated. Fighting ceased at 3:50 PM. One lieutenant colonel battalion commander from our infantry regiment died, and over sixty cavalry and infantry soldiers were wounded or killed. Fighting occurred at Daguantun on the evening of the 16th; details await further reports. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) This morning, two Japanese aircraft flew to our battlefront, conducting reconnaissance for half an hour. Our first line of defense moved back twenty li towards the Jiangqiao (Nenjiang Bridge) area this morning. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 9 PM on the evening of the 16th, several hundred Japanese cavalry and artillery soldiers harassed our defense line near Xiahezi, Jingxing. They were repelled. The Japanese army has increased its troop deployment in the Jingxing area by over 2,000. It is feared that the military situation in that area will become more serious. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The wind remains strong today. There is no fighting along the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line. Ma Zhanshan has dispatched Zhang Guangwen, a former regimental commander, and three others to Heidong to recruit troops, planning to organize two cavalry and infantry brigades. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan, due to empty treasury funds, is negotiating with Harbin banking groups to borrow one million. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 1 PM this afternoon, a Japanese aircraft flew to the Fularji firewood factory on our defensive line and dropped four bombs, which did not explode. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 4 PM on the afternoon of the 16th, over one hundred Japanese cavalry harassed our Sanjianfang defense line. A Japanese aircraft assisted by dropping bombs. However, due to the blinding wind and sand, they were unsuccessful and retreated. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) This afternoon, a Japanese aircraft flew to Heihe to conduct reconnaissance, flying very high for ten minutes before leaving. The Japanese troops captured one of our soldiers, dismembered him into eight pieces, and dropped them onto our position from the aircraft to demoralize our troops. Our soldiers became even more incensed. At 1 PM on the afternoon of the 15th, there was a clash between Daxing and Sanjianfang. Japanese troops sent a small cavalry detachment to harass, but they were repelled by our troops. Ma Zhanshan arrived at Ang'angxi on the evening of the 15th, planning everything. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Heilongjiang army is constructing defensive fortifications in Ang'angxi, Sanjianfang, Tangchi, and other places. Ma Zhanshan led his guards to inspect the trenches, providing strategic instructions to officers at all levels, urging them to firmly defend their positions and calmly respond to the enemy. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Xi Qia ordered the Jilin army in each town not to obstruct Ma Zhanshan's resistance against the Japanese; all the generals responded with a laugh. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two Japanese aircraft flew towards our cavalry positions in Fularji at noon on the 16th, dropping six bombs. They also dropped over twenty bombs in Mujia, six li in front of our position. Another Japanese aircraft flew around the provincial capital of Heilongjiang for a week to conduct reconnaissance before flying away. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Bu Kui (Qiqihar) states that Banzhuang notified the Eastern Railway that it would pass through the Chinese Eastern Railway within the 16th to occupy Longjiang Province's capital city. The Railway Bureau has already made preparations for this. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Various groups in Harbin, due to the brave fighting of Ma Zhanshan's troops against the enemy, are competing to purchase supplies and sending personnel to the front lines. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters sent a telegram requesting the central government and Vice-Zhang to dispatch troops to assist Ma Zhanshan in order to solidify the morale of the troops. The Northeast students in Beiping who oppose Japan presented a petition to Vice-Zhang requesting the issuance of firearms in order to assemble for training, and they also sent a telegram to console Ma Zhanshan. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Train Derails at Jiangqiao; Twelve Cars of Ammunition Plunge into the River</h3>
<p>(Harbin) At 8 AM, a Japanese armored train with twelve ammunition cars and over a hundred soldiers was traveling from Tailai across the Jiangqiao (Nenjiang Bridge). While traveling across the bridge, the bridge, newly repaired with wood, could not withstand the weight and collapsed in the middle. The entire train plunged into the river, and all the soldiers drowned. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Incrementally Increase Defenses Along the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Line</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Harbin states that, according to reports, the Japanese army in Nenjiang has increased significantly, and a large-scale offensive is imminent. It is said that this time, the Japanese army is greatly threatened by our reclamation army operating on their flank. From Nenjiang to Tongliao and Tao'nan, defenses are being incrementally increased. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) All of the Japanese troops from Shenyang have been deployed to the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line to attack Heilongjiang. Inspection of the city gates is handled by the commercial associations. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Two regiments of the 8th Mixed Brigade of the Japanese army stationed in Korea arrived in Fushun on the 16th and will be transported to the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line. It is expected that the entire brigade will arrive before the 25th, and a major battle will occur between Jiangqiao (Nenjiang Bridge). (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Issues Final Ultimatum to Japan, Demanding the Withdrawal of Japanese Troops from the Nenjiang Region</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) A Reuters correspondent learned here this afternoon that Ma Zhanshan has sent an ultimatum demanding that the Japanese army withdraw from the Nenjiang region. Japanese authorities had previously demanded that the Heilongjiang army withdraw from Heihe and Ang'angxi, so Ma Zhanshan responded with this. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Sternly Refuses Japanese Demands; Banzhuang Submits Three More Demands, Which Ma Zhanshan Has Refuted Point by Point</h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 16th, Ma Zhanshan received a telegram from Banzhuang, sent from Shenyang, stating that he had received an order from Southern Army Minister of the Army Department presenting three demands to Ma Zhanshan: 1. The Ma army must withdraw north to Qiqihar. All troops currently concentrated in Qiqihar and Ang'angxi must return to their original garrisons. 2. The Ma army must not be stationed south of the Chinese Eastern Railway. 3. Ma must not interfere with the management of the Tao'an Railway Bureau. Otherwise, the Japanese army will immediately take necessary and effective measures. Regarding the above three points, the Japanese side also stipulated that Ma should implement them within ten days, starting from November 14, and respond by noon on the 16th, specifying that the reply must be forwarded through the Japanese Special Service Agency in Harbin. After receiving these unreasonable demands, Ma Zhanshan immediately reported the situation to Vice-Zhang and requested instructions on how to respond. Zhang, based on each point, telegraphed instructions to Ma to refute them one by one: 1. Qiqihar and Ang'angxi are completely within Chinese territory, and Ma Zhanshan's troops are troops of the Chinese government. On what basis does the Japanese government interfere with their stationing within their own country's territory? This is highly inappropriate. 2. Both the north and south of the Chinese Eastern Railway are Chinese territory. The intention of the rebuttal is the same as the first point. 3. Although the Tao'an Railway was built with borrowed funds, the loan contract clearly stipulates that the sovereignty of the railway belongs entirely to our country, and all management and disposition are not subject to the unilateral control of the creditor. This is recognized by all countries in the world, and it is an unreasonable demand that is difficult to accept. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tonight's newspapers urgently report that negotiations between the Japanese military authorities and General Ma Zhanshan have broken down. Ma insists on leaving some troops stationed south of the Chinese Eastern Railway for the purpose of suppressing bandits and using the prohibition of Zhang Haipeng's use of the Tao'an Railway as a condition for accepting Japanese proposals. Although his demands seem very reasonable on the surface, the Japanese consider them pretexts and therefore refuse them. According to unverified reports, the military authorities have decided to request the Cabinet to approve the additional dispatch of an army division to relieve the crisis in Manchuria. It is not certain whether the Cabinet will reject it. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Repair Jiangqiao (Nenjiang Bridge)</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Nenjiang Bridge on the Tao'an Railway was repaired by the Japanese army using wood on the 15th. Eighty spans of the bridge are empty, with fourteen spans destroyed at the southern end and seven spans destroyed at the northern end. The Japanese army carried out a trial run of trains on the afternoon of the 15th. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Tao'nan National Salvation Army Defeats Zhang Haipeng's Troops and Advances Towards Tailai; Zhang's Troops Plan to Retreat to Rehe</h3>
<p>(Harbin) On the evening of the 14th, the Tao'nan National Salvation Volunteer Army defeated Bai Fu's regiment of Zhang Haipeng's troops and has advanced towards Tailai. The Japanese army has deployed two regiments to block them. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Haipeng's troops still number 5,000, mostly cavalry. Due to Japanese pressure, they have concentrated the troops in Tailai at Tao'nan. An increasing number of Japanese troops are arriving in Tao'an. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Harbin states that Zhang Haipeng, due to his failure to attack Heilongjiang, plans to move his troops towards Rehe, abandoning his plans for Heilongjiang. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Duomen, the commander of the Japanese division, because Zhang Haipeng's troops did not follow orders and moved to other locations, induced a battalion of Song's regiment to cross the Nenjiang on the 16th. When the soldiers were halfway across, he opened fire and sank the boats, drowning all the soldiers. Many of Zhang's soldiers angrily fled and scattered. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Lin Yixiu, Representative of Banzhuang, Contacts the Harbin Authorities</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Lin Yixiu, representative of Banzhuang, has come to Harbin with an important mission to contact the authorities. The previous telegram stating that Banzhuang had arrived was a false report. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Jinkai and Xi Qia telegraphed Zhang Jinghui in Harbin, inviting him to Shenyang to discuss everything. Zhang replied with a stern refusal. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Department Instructs Banzhuang to Act Expeditiously; Japan Uses Heavy Troops to Pressure Jiang Province</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Japanese Army Minister Minami and Prime Minister Wakatsuki held lengthy discussions, reporting on the activities of General Ma Zhanshan. They stated that the Army Department had instructed Banzhuang to act expeditiously in necessary emergency measures in combat with Ma Zhanshan. They also stated that a one-day delay in the decisive actions of the Japanese army would further increase the danger in northern Manchuria. Therefore, the Army Department had instructed Banzhuang to take necessary and severe measures against Ma Zhanshan. A mixed regiment of the 8th Division of the Japanese Army boarded ships at 8:30 AM this morning to rush to the three eastern provinces. The 7th and 4th Air Squadrons also departed for the three eastern provinces at 9:00 AM this morning. It is expected that they will all be deployed to the Tao'an-Ang'angxi road, where a major battle is imminent. (17th National Telegram)</p>

<p>League of Nations Executive Council Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss Two Proposed Pilot Suggestions</p>
<p>1. Negotiate an Eastern Locarno Treaty</p>
<p>2. Form a Committee to Monitor Japanese Troop Deployment</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council held a secret meeting at 11:20 AM this morning to discuss the situation in the three eastern provinces. The Chinese and Japanese representatives did not participate. Before the meeting, US Ambassador Dawes met with Chinese Chief Representative Shi. Afterwards, Shi told people that the situation in the three eastern provinces and between China and Japan was becoming increasingly serious. After his best efforts to explain, Ambassador Dawes indicated that he did not intend to seek a compromise solution. He certainly knew that the US government and Ambassador Dawes had no intention of compromising and did not want to exclude the Kellogg-Briand Pact from the northeastern crisis. Dawes also told people that neither he nor the US government anticipated the need to attend the Council meeting, as most of the progress in mediation would be achieved through private talks. After the meeting between Shi and Dawes, the League of Nations Secretariat officially announced that no further public formal meetings would be held today. The twelve council members will continue to hold secret talks, with the Chinese and Japanese representatives not participating. Later, during the secret meeting, it was heard that the council members were discussing in groups, mostly focusing on two proposed pilot suggestions. The first suggestion was (1) to negotiate an Eastern Locarno Treaty, and (2) to organize two Sino-Japanese committees to work simultaneously in the three eastern provinces and Europe to negotiate an Eastern Locarno Treaty. If the proposal to negotiate an Eastern Locarno Treaty could be agreed upon, it would stipulate clauses similar to the Locarno Pact signed by European countries, where if one country was invaded, the other countries would jointly resist it, based on the current state of the Sino-Japanese treaty. The second suggestion was issued by the League of Nations Secretariat, which would organize a committee to monitor the Japanese withdrawal of troops, while also organizing a mixed committee to meet in Europe to determine the status of Sino-Japanese treaties. The secret meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, and there will be no further meetings until tomorrow morning. According to reliable sources, although several proposals have been submitted to the Council for consideration, Chairman Briand has not yet put forward a special plan. It is feared that the French Council may not be able to reach a solution before Friday. (17th National Press Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the French Foreign Ministry issued a communique stating that the Council will hold a secret meeting at 11:00 AM on Wednesday. It is said that this communique is sufficient to indicate that the secret meetings and private talks of the council members have not yet made sufficient progress to hold a public meeting. (17th National Press Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) At a time when the clouds of war and the sound of artillery fire fill the air near the Nenjiang Bridge, the gentlemen of the League of Nations Council are leisurely engaged. After reconvening at 4:00 PM this afternoon, the formal meeting lasted only twenty-four minutes, followed by an hour and a half of private talks, before adjourning. The Sino-Japanese problem was only briefly stated, and there was no discussion of concrete solutions. Chairman Briand suggested that the representatives follow the method created by US Ambassador Dawes and continue to conduct private contacts separately. Dawes had already begun receiving ambassadors, foreign ministers, and other representatives at his residence early this morning, before the Council meeting, exchanging views and gauging opinions. When the Council opened in the clock room of the French Foreign Ministry, Dawes completely retreated behind the scenes, remaining in the hotel. The details of the Council meeting have been described in yesterday's telegram. When Briand gave his speech, and Simon and Pruger thanked Briand for his welcome, the representatives all agreed with Briand's suggestion to continue private talks separately tonight and tomorrow morning. Once sufficient progress has been made, a formal meeting will be held to discuss and decide on truly feasible solutions. (16th National Press Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The opening address given by Foreign Minister Briand at the League of Nations Council meeting today lacked its usual sharpness. The newspapers here all anticipate that the League of Nations meeting will achieve a compromise solution in principle. After this compromise solution is put forward, it will be followed by extremely lengthy negotiations. Briand's speech can be regarded as a prelude to that compromise solution. As for its content, it is still difficult to understand at present. There is extremely enthusiastic activity in diplomatic circles here today, and the scope of activity is focused on the French Foreign Ministry. After the League of Nations meeting adjourned, public attention still revolved around the Foreign Ministry. US Ambassador to Britain Dawes is active behind the scenes. Although Dawes did not attend the League of Nations meeting, he is quite capable of cooperating with the League of Nations. (16th National Press Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The danger of a breakdown in the Manchurian problem has now passed. This is the idea held by many people after today's Executive Council meeting, because there was no mention in the meeting of implying the adoption of any method to implement the October 24 resolution. Today's meeting was open, but due to being overly open, the meeting was hindered by its openness. The whirring of the cameras, the flashes of light, all seemed like the sound of exploding artillery shells and the smoke they emitted, making people uneasy. Briand, affected by this smoke, triggered a fit of coughing. The audience saw him struggling to support himself, enduring the cough to speak, and felt pain for him. Dr. Shi Zhaoji arrived at the meeting place before 4:00 PM, taking his seat in the corner of the horseshoe-shaped seating arrangement, seemingly eager for the meeting to begin. British Foreign Secretary Simon entered with the crowd, smiling as he shook hands with Yoshizawa. The US representative did not attend. At 4:06 PM, Briand formally opened the meeting, first welcoming Simon and German representative Pruger to the meeting, as this was their first time participating in the Executive Council meeting. He then briefly described the Manchurian situation since the last meeting of the Executive Council, stating that although the meeting in October had failed to obtain the agreement of the parties concerned on the draft resolution, this resolution still had a major moral significance. Dr. Shi stated in a letter after the last meeting that the Chinese government had decided to faithfully fulfill its obligations and was willing to submit the issue of treaty interpretation to arbitration, but the Japanese government stated that Dr. Shi's letter seemed to question the validity of the treaty. The Japanese government refused to acknowledge that there was any doubt about this matter. On October 26, they received a letter from Japan mentioning five basic points. After careful research, they found that the first four points were all included in the Executive Council's resolution. As for the fourth point, namely China's recognition of the Sino-Japanese treaty, he believed that there was still room for understanding along the lines of Dr. Shi's letter. Briand went on to mention the military situation, stating that he had received information from the Chinese government regarding the seizure of Chinese salt taxes by the Japanese army, and also received an explanation from the Japanese government regarding this matter. Both sides were prepared to provide the information he requested, and he was very grateful for this. He saw in this the signs of both sides wanting to cooperate faithfully in resolving their dispute. Briand was able to grasp the key points of the problem, stating that it was urgently necessary to devise a plan to ensure the safety of Japanese lives and property. Japan had long stated that without this plan, Japan could not change its attitude. The difficulty lay in finding out what should be included under the heading of safety. The Japanese believed that the fundamental issue at stake was respect for the existing treaties between China and Japan, especially the treaties concerning Manchuria and the railway area. From his point of view, Dr. Shi's willingness to submit the issue of the validity of these treaties to arbitration could also provide a basis for understanding if both sides had good intentions. Although Japan had complied with the October 24 resolution requesting it to withdraw its troops before November 16, the Japanese government had issued a statement showing its willingness to respect its obligations and remain consistent in this regard. The Executive Council will continue to work on the Sino-Japanese problem without being swayed by any expedient suggestions. The Executive Council is determined to uphold the principles of the League of Nations Covenant. Briand's speech was translated into other languages, and then Simon spoke, expressing his satisfaction at being able to participate in the deliberations on the Sino-Japanese problem and consolidate the power of the League of Nations. German representative Pruger spoke next, with the main idea being the same as Simon's, and said that private talks could make the procedure easier because there were various documents that still needed to be studied. Briand replied that he felt this approach was very beneficial, so he proposed a secret meeting followed by another public meeting. This proposal was adopted by the whole body. Today's public meeting was thus concluded. Shi Zhaoji and Yoshizawa did not speak, which was said to be due to the intervention of US Ambassador to Britain Dawes, who believed that negotiations would be easier if the two sides did not argue in public, and Simon also agreed with this idea. A secret meeting was then held, lasting twenty minutes. Whether there will be a public meeting before Wednesday is currently undecided. Briand stated during the secret meeting that he would be happy to hear from any member of the Executive Council who wished to discuss the matter, express their views on the progress of events since the last Executive Council meeting, or make suggestions. The greatest difficulty was the fifth of the five basic points put forward by Japan, namely that China must recognize all treaties between China and Japan. If an agreement could be reached on this point, a solution could be found. The Executive Council will continue to work towards a solution in a spirit of impartiality, without making hasty judgments or expedient criticisms. The Executive Council's sole aim is to uphold peace and justice based on international obligations. Dr. Shi briefly described the serious situation faced by China, emphasizing the necessity of dealing with this difficult problem without delay and advocating for more public meetings in order to publicize China's views as much as possible. Yoshizawa did not speak. The closed-door meeting was adjourned. It is expected that there will be another closed-door meeting tomorrow morning. Reuters has learned that Dawes will participate in the Executive Council meetings later this week as an observer. After the representatives filed out, Yoshizawa stayed behind to talk with Briand. Briand suddenly stopped their conversation and sent someone to look for Shi Zhaoji, but Shi had already left. It is said that Simon also intends to have informal talks with Briand and Pruger in Paris to discuss the issue of German reparations and Germany's short-term debt of 600 million pounds, but Reuters has learned that Simon does not want to negotiate this matter with the French government at this time, but only wants to test the waters and listen to their opinions when discussing the matter with French government officials, without taking the initiative to propose it. Simon has come to Paris specifically to deal with the Sino-Japanese problem. After taking over as Foreign Secretary in the new British cabinet, Simon began to study the ins and outs of the Sino-Japanese problem. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Before this morning's secret meeting, Dawes also met with Matsudaira and had a long conversation. Yesterday, Shi Zhaoji and Yoshizawa wanted to express their views but ultimately did not speak, due to the requests of their colleagues. The first public meeting of the Executive Council did not want the progress of its work to be hindered by the formal presentation of irreconcilable demands from both sides. Briand's desire for private discussions, waiting until there was a firm grasp of a compromise solution before holding a public meeting again, was also for this reason. It is said that Dr. Shi had requested to speak at last night's secret meeting, but withdrew his request due to Briand's advice. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Embassy Counselor Inspects the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Line</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Fraser, Counselor of the British Embassy, went to the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line on the 15th to inspect the atrocities of the Japanese army. He obtained a Japanese artillery shell with the numbers "Showa 6" (1931) on it and took it away to be shown to the British ambassador. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The First Sound of the League of Nations' Third Assembly</h3>
<p>The League of Nations' Executive Council formally convened its third assembly on the 16th. The eyes and ears of the world are now focused on Paris. The anxious thoughts and considerations of diplomats and politicians from around the globe are gathered. After two sessions of debate and discussion, the serious situation in the Northeast has not seen the slightest progress. Now, for the third time, capable diplomats from various nations are assembled in Paris for a third round of deliberations. This truly makes us deeply feel the difficulty of righteousness overcoming brute force.</p>
<p>We infer that this third meeting will certainly not end without results again. This result will either be that righteousness can be upheld, or that righteousness will be even more severely trampled upon, and our country will sink deeper into the abyss of misery. However, based on the facts before us, the latter unfortunate outcome is more likely than the former. As of the time the reporter is writing, the news coming from Paris regarding the League of Nations meeting has not yet revealed any concrete discussions. However, the most noteworthy aspect is that all countries now agree to conduct their work in a secret manner.</p>
<p>At the reopening of the meeting on the 16th, Mr. Dawes, the seemingly authoritative representative of the United States, stated, "If the disputing countries do not engage in open adversarial debates, it may make it easier to achieve faster results in the meeting." This proposal was immediately agreed upon by the representatives of various countries. Mr. Briand, in a closed meeting, stated, "The most difficult issue to resolve is the fifth of the five basic conditions demanded by the Japanese side, namely, the demand that China recognize all treaties between China and Japan. If this issue is resolved, the Sino-Japanese incident can be brought to an end." He also said, "Peace and justice must ultimately be achieved by respecting international treaties."</p>
<p>Based on the revelation of these facts, we can see that the League of Nations is now extremely tired of the Chinese representatives' incessant appeals and is using flexible diplomatic tactics to prevent the Chinese representatives from speaking. The Japanese army now occupies our territory and continues to expand its atrocities, and being in a position of strength, it has no grievances to plead and no need to speak. Only China, forced by violence, has its country and nation placed on the line of survival. Yet, in this gathering purely for upholding righteousness and justice, it still cannot voice its grievances. What an unfair phenomenon this is. People around the world should all be able to understand the extreme brevity of representative Shi's statement, advocating that open meetings are the more the better, in order to present the legitimacy of China's views. Now, we cannot even appeal for help. Alas!</p>
<p>As for the fifth item of the Japanese demands that Mr. Briand hesitated about, we cannot but make a statement in advance. The establishment of international treaties, first, depends on whether it is based on the principle of equality, and then it can determine the obligation to abide by it. All treaties between China and Japan in the Eastern Provinces were concluded under a kind of violent coercion, especially the threat of the Twenty-One Demands, which made the Chinese people heartbroken and unforgettable for a single day. This unequal treaty itself has abandoned good faith and has no possibility of being established. If we want the Chinese people to retroactively recognize it at this time, then we might as well think that China has the obligation to accept Japan's domination. We sincerely do not believe the Reuters report that Mr. Briand's attitude has changed, but we cannot but hope that Mr. Briand can uphold his righteousness and justice. Moreover, the most pressing issue at present is how to stop the Japanese army's atrocities and withdraw the Japanese army entrenched in our territory. This is the prerequisite for all issues. Now, the League of Nations is postponing the decision on this prerequisite, and the United States, which is behind the scenes, is even advocating that there should be no limit to the deadline for the Japanese army's withdrawal. Then, the so-called compromise that is widely rumored but not disclosed in Paris today cannot but make people suspicious.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese people have not diminished their enthusiasm for trusting the League of Nations. Will the League of Nations, in its third assembly, be able to rescue righteousness and justice from violent coercion? The Chinese people should temporarily hold their breath and endure death to observe the outcome of the secret meeting.</p>

<h3>Briand Issues Important Remarks, Trying to Persuade Japanese Representative to Accept Shi Zhaoji's Statement</h3>
<p>(Paris) Briand issued a statement to the newspapers tonight, hoping that the Sino-Japanese dispute would be resolved quickly. It is said that among the five points of the Japanese proposal for troop withdrawal, four points are no longer a problem and should not be an obstacle to a peaceful resolution. However, the fifth point, Japan's insistence on recognizing all existing rights and interests granted by treaties, has so far seen no concession from either side. According to Dr. Shi, the chief Chinese representative, this point is outside the scope of negotiations and is even rejected for discussion. However, it is heard that Briand is currently trying to persuade the Japanese representative to accept Dr. Shi Zhaoji's statement in Geneva on October 24 regarding China's respect for international treaties, as the basis for resolving this dispute. Outside the Sino-Japanese delegations, Briand's proposal is generally supported by most people. It is expected that this will become a strong proposition during the informal talks among the council members tomorrow morning. (National News Agency telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Nebulous and Confused New Dawes Plan Mostly Caters to Japan's Intentions</h3>
<p>(Paris) The nebulous compromise, the so-called "New Dawes Plan," to resolve the Manchurian problem, still exists vividly. This morning, the L'Excelsior reported that Dawes, Simon, and Matsudaira discussed this in London. It is heard that this plan does not stipulate a definite period, but allows the Japanese government to withdraw its troops under the condition that the lives and property of the Japanese people are secured, while simultaneously ordering China and Japan to negotiate directly and cease military operations. Although many have spoken of this compromise, it has not yet been submitted to the Executive Council. There is no doubt that those currently engaged in seeking a solution feel the need for a similar plan. Dawes is extremely active, which shows the United States' attention to the work of the League of Nations. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>The US Government Still Maintains a Calm Attitude; Stimson Issued Another Instruction to Dawes Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Washington) This morning, US Secretary of State Stimson stated that he had issued a complete instruction to Dawes, detailing the development of the Sino-Japanese dispute and the steps the League of Nations should take. Therefore, Mr. Dawes may not need to participate in the actual discussions of the Council. It is expected that Washington will rarely take action regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute until the situation in Paris is clear. However, Stimson and ex-Secretary Grandy may informally discuss the matter during their conversation. (National News Agency telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>The New York Tribune today revealed the US attitude towards Japan, stating that the State Department, on the one hand, sent a firm note to the Japanese government, declaring that the United States supports the League of Nations' efforts to persuade Japan to withdraw its troops occupying Manchurian territory. On the other hand, it secretly informed the Japanese ambassador in Washington that the United States does not want to support the League of Nations' demands based on force. The United States also does not want to support the League of Nations' plan to impose economic sanctions on Japan or recall diplomatic representatives stationed in Tokyo. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>China's League of Nations Membership Fees Are Heavily in Arrears, Reaching Over 9.22 Million Gold Francs</h3>
<p>London Eden, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, stated in the House of Commons today that the total amount of League of Nations membership fees owed by various countries as of 1930 reached 14,264,000 gold francs. China owes 9,227,000 gold francs, with the remainder owed by the United States and South American countries. Although countries owe membership fees, it does not affect their voting rights. The League of Nations' funding shortfall is covered by remaining funds. League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond is paying close attention to this matter. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Public Opinion in Various Countries</h3>
<p>London Today, the British newspapers detailed the report of yesterday's meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council, all reluctant to publish criticisms at this time. However, those concerned with politics are relieved that yesterday's meeting was calm, and the representatives of China and Japan did not have an open debate. French newspapers mostly made criticisms. The most noteworthy is an article in the Paris Morning Post, stating that the League of Nations should act directly through its representatives in Manchuria, which would be more beneficial than overemphasizing meetings. While the conflict in Manchuria is still feared to occur, it is useless to discuss the League of Nations' charter in Paris. It should instruct the diplomatic representatives stationed in the Far East to effectively intervene. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>London The Manchester Guardian published an editorial, focusing on the Liaoning-Jilin dispute and the meeting of the Executive Council, firmly stating that the attitude adopted by the Japanese is indeed a violation of the League of Nations charter and a violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The current situation is even more serious than before. The newspaper attacked the majority organs of the British Conservative Party, arguing that Japanese atrocities have been condemned by public opinion, but the Conservative Party organs are trying to defend it. Japan fails to see that it is a mistake to think that the British delegation has changed its attitude or will not firmly request the Executive Council to take all means to quell the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Havas telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although the German press's tone still strives to maintain complete neutrality regarding the Northeast Three Provinces incident, most morning newspapers commented today that world opinion at the end of October was focused on Japan, and now Japan's position has made significant progress. This can be seen in the editorial of the Vossische Zeitung, which claims that most of the council members are now effectively siding with Japan, and their degree of siding with Japan is no less than the degree of anti-Japan at the time in Geneva. The reason for the change in attitude is, first, the shift in the situation, and second, the governments of the major countries have had time to reflect and deeply feel that Japan occupies an important position in next year's disarmament conference, and countries must not antagonize Japan. As for Germany's attitude, the newspaper believes that Germany has no political interests in the Far East, but has huge economic interests in the Northeast Three Provinces, which have now been greatly affected. Therefore, it will do its best to seek a speedy and fair resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Germany will always adhere to this policy and will not be changed by the outside world. (National News telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Morning Post commented this morning on the Council's hope for a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute, saying that the Council's actions should not go beyond the scope of the October 24 resolution. The proposal of Articles 15 and 16 of the Charter is undoubtedly a matter of course. The newspaper believes that a compromise can ultimately be found, perhaps based on the plan currently being drafted by Dawes. As for the content of the Dawes plan, the newspaper still does not know the details, but it claims that many in the League of Nations believe it is feasible. People here are paying close attention to the meeting between Briand and the Soviet Russian Ambassador to France, Dovgalevsky, last night. No public announcement was made regarding this conversation, but the authorities have also denied that the two discussed the Northeast Three Provinces dispute and the Soviet Russian attitude towards Japan.

<h3>The Japanese Deliberately Mystify the Issue of Puyi's Accession to the Throne</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Puyi arrived in Liaoning on the evening of the 14th, and everything still needs to be discussed and resolved. The rumor that he would ascend the throne on the 15th is inaccurate. (Special telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Reuters correspondent visited Puyi, the leader of the Restoration faction, this morning, but did not see him, but saw his followers, who said that Puyi went to Dalian this morning to meet with a certain important person. The so-called important person probably refers to Puyi. If so, then Puyi is now hiding somewhere between Dalian and Lushun, waiting for the preparations for the restoration to be completed. Puyi's followers admitted, after being questioned by the correspondent, that Puyi would arrive in Shenyang within a few days, and admitted that the dragon flag was being manufactured to welcome the deposed emperor. At the same time, the Japanese authorities said that the Japanese would not interfere with Puyi's actions. Uchida, the president of the South Manchurian Railway, told the correspondent today that the Japanese authorities did not know the news of Puyi's actions and had not paid attention to this matter. In its plan to stabilize Manchuria, the Japanese authorities did not have Puyi's position. This afternoon, Japanese Army Commander Honjo told the correspondent that he had heard of Puyi's departure from Tianjin, but had not received reliable information about his actions. The Japanese army was not involved in this matter. The restoration was a matter for the people of Manchuria and had nothing to do with the Japanese army. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Kuomintang's newspaper commented on Puyi's claim to the throne in Manchuria, saying briefly that this move would change the face of the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Shenyang area is becoming increasingly troubled, and Japan must be pleased, but Puyi's claim to the throne depends on Japan's assistance. Japan also wants Puyi to stay in his position for a long time, only then will Japan's military actions in Manchuria be justified. (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Special Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses the Puyi Restoration Incident and Decides to Issue a Statement to the World</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Special Foreign Affairs Committee met today to discuss the issue of Japan taking Puyi to the Northeast in an attempt to restore the throne, and decided to issue a statement to the League of Nations and the world. It was issued this evening. According to news from foreign consulates, as of this morning, Puyi has not yet arrived in Shenyang and seems to be in Dalian. Many people speculate that Japan is taking Puyi to Shenyang in order to forcibly invoke the League of Nations' principle of national self-determination to deceive the world. An investigation shows that Han Chinese account for the majority of the people in the three eastern provinces, and no one wants Puyi to restore the throne. Even Puyi himself does not want to be a puppet of the Japanese. This move by the Japanese warlords is almost a child's play. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to external news, since the Japanese army occupied various parts of the Northeast by force, it has repeatedly instigated or used bandits, traitors, and other unscrupulous elements to disrupt local order, and under the coercion of Japanese riots, organized illegal agencies and usurped administrative power. Recently, it has been reported that Puyi, the deposed emperor of the Qing Dynasty, is right at the time when rioters in Tianjin are disrupting security based in the Japanese concession, someone was taken from the Japanese concession to Shenyang by the Japanese to organize a puppet government and openly claimed the throne. It has been investigated that wherever there are any illegal organizations that undermine the integrity of China's administration in the Northeast, which is under Japanese control by force, the Chinese government and people will not recognize them. The League of Nations and the governments of friendly nations have been notified of this on record. Now, if Puyi organizes a puppet government, if it is true, the Chinese government will of course regard it as a rebellious organization, and at the same time, it has to be regarded as a disguised subsidiary of the Japanese government. It absolutely cannot recognize all its illegal actions, and the Japanese government should bear full responsibility for it. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Chinese Youth believes that Puyi is willing to be a puppet of the Japanese and has made the absurd move of plotting restoration, which is not tolerated by the laws of the Republic of China. On the 17th, it asked the Fourth Plenary Session to resolve it and unanimously condemned it. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Ning and Yue have been continuously consulting with each other on how to deal with the restoration case in the Eastern Provinces, with telegrams going back and forth endlessly. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Since the implementation of martial law in Beijing, the order has been strict. The city gates open at 6:00 a.m. and close at 7:00 p.m. The trams stop at 5:30 p.m. All stores close their doors before 6:00 p.m. Silk and cloth shops, banks, and exchange shops have assigned additional employees to guard them at night. Most cinemas have stopped showing movies, and theaters only perform daytime shows, with very few customers. Rickshaw pullers have poor business during the day and must stop working at night. Last night, machine guns were set up at the entrance of Dongjiaominxiang, with strict security. The lights on all floors of the Telegraph Bureau were turned off or covered with black cloth, which shows a glimpse of the martial law in Beijing. (Special telegram, 17th)</p>

Grandi is currently a guest of Stimson and will discuss disarmament and international financial and economic issues, as well as the issue of the three northeastern provinces.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>The telegram from Qiqihar requests all news agencies to forward to the awareness of compatriots nationwide: Since the Japanese army occupied Jilin and Liaoning, they have used the remnants of the Qing Dynasty, Xi Qia, and the madman Zhao Xinbo to reorganize the Liaoning and Jilin provincial governments, wanting to use the means of destroying Korea to create a conspiracy to merge Manchuria and Mongolia or create a mandate of control. After advancing troops to Taonan, they tried their best to collude with the rebel Zhang Haipeng, leading his bandit army to invade the borders of Heilongjiang. Recently, because the Jiangqiao natural barrier was destroyed by our defense forces, preventing them from crossing the river, the Japanese, under the pretext of obstructing traffic and affecting the Taoang Road loan, wanted to use force to cover the construction of the Jiangqiao bridge. In order to avoid conflict, our side retreated in good faith. The Japanese army built a pontoon bridge, led the rebel army of Zhang Haipeng across the river, invaded our positions, and launched a fierce attack. Our army had no way to retreat and could not bear it any longer. We resisted bravely in self-defense, resulting in a fierce war that is still ongoing in close combat. The people of our province held an anti-Japanese national salvation conference at the Provincial Party Headquarters, attended by more than 300 representatives, and resolved the following cases: (1) Please send a telegram to the central government to mobilize the whole country and fight a life-and-death battle with the violent Japanese; (2) Please send a telegram to the central government to dispatch a squadron of aircraft to assist in the battle; (3) Please send a telegram to the Beijing-Guangdong peace talks to cooperate with each other in foreign affairs; (4) Please ask the provincial government to quickly dispatch the security teams and protection groups along the railway line to reinforce; (5) Please ask the provincial government to quickly dispatch fire brigades and water tankers to the front line to transport water; (6) Please ask the provincial government to strictly order all机关 civil servants not to move around at will; (7) Raise comfort donations and send 15 representatives to leave immediately for the front line to comfort the soldiers; (8) The bad gentry Li Weizhou and Zhao Zhongren, members of the Provincial Committee, colluded with the Japanese to sign a treaty selling the country, gathered private parties, and, under the guise of public opinion, coerced the provincial government to withdraw its troops and secretly planned to welcome the enemy and declare independence. The military and civilians were indignant and wanted to eat their flesh and sleep on their skin. Now, because their rebellious actions are obvious, they have fled in fear of crime. The central government should be asked to expel Zhao Zhongren from the party, and telegrams should be sent to military and police forces everywhere to strictly arrest them and execute them on the spot, and confiscate their property to be used as military expenses, in order to punish traitors and reassure the military; (9) Please ask the government to strictly investigate the gang of traitors; (10) Entrust comrades stationed in Harbin to侦察 the actions of the traitors, scout out news, and unite with all sectors to save the country together; (11) Immediately establish an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, whose staff will be changed from the staff of the National Diplomacy Association.

Most of our compatriots do not grasp the essence of the China issue, nor do they understand it. Because the resolution of this issue will take a considerable amount of time, it is necessary during this period to thoroughly imprint the essence of this issue into the minds of the people, making them aware that this is truly a serious period of "national crisis" and that the entire nation must unite and become tense. This is the foremost task. Some people believe that the League of Nations is easy to deal with regarding this incident, or even that this issue will not be very difficult. However, for the sake of our country's survival, we can bear any sacrifice and endure any suffering. But the most important point in resolving this issue is that we should seize this opportunity to stand on our country's position, explain the special nature of our rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia to the League of Nations in detail, and make them understand. We should respect the League of Nations' claims as much as possible and avoid direct negotiations with China. We must not disregard the League. If we can proceed in this way, China may not reject our claims. If we have done so, and China remains as violent as it is now, then it is truly time to resort to the final means. At this time, the Japanese people, the international community, and the whole world will fully understand Japan's position, and the long-standing problem can be thoroughly resolved. We will wait for this opportunity to arrive before taking action, which will not be too late. The anti-Japanese goods movement caused by the Manchurian incident has undoubtedly dealt a great blow to our country's industry and commerce, but this is not what we should be focusing on at the moment. We should advance towards this final overcoming. Taking cotton products as an example, because this item is a necessity for China, the rejection of cotton products will not only cause pain to Japan, but the pain suffered by China may be even greater. Therefore, we doubt whether this anti-Japanese goods movement can truly be sustained for a long time. However, judging from the current situation, the anti-Japanese movement will definitely not end quickly, so we must strive to find a solution.</p>
<p>The Time Has Come, Mr. Ataka, To Cut Off All Sources of Calamity, National Opinion Is Already Unified</p>
<p>The treaties regarding the rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia have now been trampled to pieces. Japan has now reached the point of being unable to tolerate it any longer. If we still cannot resolve it at this time, then there will never be an opportunity to resolve it. Although we possess many rights and interests, we have been unable to enjoy these natural rights and interests for many years due to oppression. In particular, the oppression of Koreans living in Manchuria is simply indescribable. Now national opinion has already been unified. At this time, we can no longer take timid and weak measures. We should take decisive measures and do it thoroughly. The people, facing this important moment, are even more calm and do not engage in unnecessary disturbances. This is the attitude of a "great nation," and it is by no means a sign of disinterest in this issue. Judging from the current attitude of the League of Nations, we cannot but rise up to meet the approaching crisis. Some people with interests in China often express particularly weak opinions. Although this may achieve a temporary state of peace, the result will inevitably leave behind a permanent source of calamity. Therefore, I think this time is an excellent opportunity to eradicate all sources of calamity.</p>
<p>"Bargaining" Is a Unique National Trait of the Chinese</p>
<p>Mr. Takada, Representative of Dalian</p>
<p>I have been trading with Chinese people in Manchuria for twenty-seven years. The need to bargain over the value of goods is a common buying and selling psychology of Chinese people, and this psychology is fully expressed in diplomatic politics. The proof is the attitude of China in the League of Nations and its diplomatic attitude towards the United States, which are expressions of the "bargaining" buying and selling psychology. Therefore, diplomacy with China will inevitably fail if this kind of national trait is not understood. I hope that our country, at this time when it is resolving long-standing issues, will always keep this kind of national trait in mind.</p>
<p>Is It Still Worth Waiting for the Appearance of Friendly Nations? Mr. Iijima</p>
<p>I thank Chairman Takayanagi for pointing out that the issue of China's anti-Japanese activities and the Manchuria-Mongolia issue are the same question. I also listened to Mr. So峯's insightful opinion that Manchuria is not Chinese territory. However, are these two issues truly compatible? Judging from the current situation, unless the Manchurian incident and the Sino-Japanese conflict are resolved, anti-Japanese sentiment will not cease. If Japan makes some concessions in Manchuria, the anti-Japanese movement may be slightly缓和. Is there no causal relationship between these two? Entrepreneurs with direct interests in China certainly hope that the anti-Japanese movement will end quickly. However, comparing Japan's overall economic relationship with China and the local interests in Manchuria, it is very clear that these two issues are not the same. Many people say that "boycotting goods" is painful for both China and Japan and cannot be sustained for long. However, I believe that reaching that point will still require a considerable amount of time. Both sides are currently conducting further thorough investigations into the progress and response to this movement. Therefore, this movement currently has no possibility of changing direction. Previously, I received Dr. Suehiro's opinion of first dispatching troops and then observing the attitudes of the various countries, on the one hand, and forming friendly relations with the United States and other major powers on the other. I believe that in resolving the China issue, we may not be able to obtain a friendly nation. I think this is a problem that deserves our deep consideration.</p>
<p>I Agree With and Admire the Idea of Thorough Resolution</p>
<p>But We Should Prevent Confusion Mr. Yano</p>
<p>This incident has already had a major impact on the League of Nations and the United States. Its future is not necessarily a gamble with the nation's fate. The business and industry leaders of Osaka all have the determination to resolve this issue thoroughly, which I greatly agree with and greatly admire. At the same time, the UK's cessation of the gold standard will also become a major world issue. Because of the impact of this wave, it is extremely difficult for us to resolve economic issues with China. In the face of these two major crises, business and industry leaders are each focusing on their own interests from their own standpoint. Therefore, I deeply fear that in this national crisis, the people's steps will be confused. In view of the importance of the Manchuria-Mongolia issue, we should each consider it carefully and do a good job.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Determined to Defend Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Speaks to Representatives of the Harbin Military Labor Corps</p>
<p>He Will Resist to the End as Long as He Has Breath</p>
<p>If the Army Is Finished, He Will Go to Eastern Wasteland to Train a People's Militia</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since Zhang HaiPeng's defeat and collapse, disturbances by the National Salvation Army have occurred in the rear. Zhang's ambitions for Heilongjiang have thus been slightly curtailed. Since the previous day, his troops have been moving towards Jixing Town, indicating an intention not to be controlled by the Japanese side. Chairman Ma Zhanshan, considering that Zhang has shown signs of repentance, has sent Xu Yonghe, the former brigade commander, to Jixing to persuade Zhang to return. Xu departed from the province yesterday. Zhang HaiPeng's response should be clear within a week. As for the headquarters of the Heilongjiang Army, which was originally located in the provincial capital of Longjiang, it has now been moved to Angangxi Railway Station for the sake of convenient command.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Ma Zhanshan spoke to the representatives of the Harbin groups that went to Heilongjiang to offer condolences, regarding the cause of this war and future defense plans as follows: "Japan is bullying China too much, simply forcing us into a corner. At first, we made concessions step by step, hoping that the League of Nations could find a way to resolve it. Unexpectedly, Japan again used the excuse of repairing a bridge to oppress us. Originally, we had already started repairing the bridge for two days, but they repeatedly interfered and drove away the workers. We still made concessions. Unexpectedly, they advanced towards the Jiangqiao area and repeatedly provoked us. We had truly reached the point where we could no longer tolerate it. Therefore, I telegraphed the government and Deputy Commander Zhang, declaring that if Japanese troops continued to press forward, our army would have no choice but to take legitimate defense measures. I am willing to sacrifice everything personally, but if they do not invade me, I will not move. Later, Japanese troops captured our sentries at the bridgehead and beat them to death. The front line called and reported to me, and I still ordered them to endure. If they do not attack, we will still take a defensive posture. Finally, there was another phone report saying that two thousand Japanese soldiers were launching a large-scale attack. At this point, I felt that I really could no longer bear to be beaten by them, so I ordered that after they opened fire, our side would immediately retaliate. On the sixth, I personally went to the front line to inspect and saw that the formation had a tendency to retreat, so I strictly ordered a counterattack and convened brigade commanders and officers at Sanjianfang for a lecture: 'Those who wish to be slaves of a subjugated country should retreat, otherwise, they should immediately counterattack.' All the officers knew the great righteousness, so they bravely took the lead and drove the Japanese troops back in one fell swoop. In fact, I know that it is impossible to withstand a strong enemy with a single army. It is only because the Japanese soldiers are pressing forward step by step, and there is no way to go, so there is no real solution. Therefore, I have made up my mind that as long as I have breath, I will resist to the end. Even if the army is finished, I will go to the eastern wasteland to train a people's militia and continue to fight them. As for letting Chairman Zhang HaiPeng go, that is perfectly acceptable, but there must be an order from the central government." Subsequently, Representative Wan asked again, "I heard that Zhang HaiPeng's army secretly came to the provincial capital from Jixing Town via Zhujiawan. How does the chairman view this?" Mr. Ma replied, "I am prepared for Zhang HaiPeng's arrival. The cavalry and infantry are now also sufficient to control. The strength of the Jiangqiao front line remains the same and will not be withdrawn. This matter is not a problem, please do not panic in Harbin. In short, we are doing it step by step. I have a definite purpose and will definitely live up to the Chinese people. As for the local merchants and people, I will never allow them to be trampled on." (12th)</p>
<h3>Yuan JinKai and Others Expand Illegal Organizations</h3>
<p>The Maintenance Committee Acts as the Provincial Government</p>
<p>A So-Called Inauguration Ceremony Has Been Held</p>
<p>Honjo Shigeru Sends Chief of Staff to Give Instructions</p>
<p>Jinzhou Correspondence: After the Japanese army attacked and occupied Shenyang, the traitors Yuan JinKai, Yu ChongHan, Zhao XinBo, and others, instigated by the Japanese side, seized the opportunity to set up a local Maintenance Committee, using the name of maintaining law and order to flatter the enemy and seize profits. Recently, they saw that the Japanese army intended to occupy the area for a long time and believed that the foundation was gradually solid. On the sixth of this month, they openly revealed their true colors and publicly declared that they would act as the provincial government, severing relations with the government of the Republic of China and the Northeast authorities. They moved the committee to the old site of the Liaoning Provincial Government, expanded the organization, established a secretariat and four sections with sixteen sub-sections, and established an autonomous guidance department. Yu ChongHan called himself the minister. On the morning of the tenth, they held a so-called inauguration ceremony in the old provincial government auditorium, inviting more than a hundred people from the Japanese military and political circles to participate. Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, sent his chief of staff, Mimaki, to the site to supervise and deliver a speech. Subsequently, Yuan JinKai and Yu ChongHan delivered speeches in response, with extremely arrogant words. Yuan JinKai said in his reply, "The acting government begins today. Since the incident, I and the members of this committee have emerged to organize a local maintenance committee, originally hoping that it could be revoked in the shortest possible time. Now, due to the trend of the times, the scope has expanded, so we have no choice but to act as the government. We can ignore the debate about right and wrong. We are now taking saving the people as our purpose and carrying out the cause of saving the country and the people. Now that we are in a military period, and since we are acting as the government, we hope to respect each other in the relationship between China and Japan." Yu ChongHan said in his reply, "Autonomy is a matter of convenience for the people. If autonomy is done well, then redization cannot intrude. There are eight principles for autonomous opinion: First, follow the will of the people; second, cultivate the strength of the people; third, treat everyone equally; fourth, practice honest politics and give high salaries; fifth, send officials from various counties to the province to attend classes to study autonomy; sixth, reorganize the Public Security Council, recruit public security teams, and give them sophisticated equipment to specialize in suppressing bandits; seventh, make finance public and establish an audit office; eighth, save administrative expenses and reduce harsh taxes." Chief of Staff Mimaki of the Japanese Army said in his instructions, "This time, the local Maintenance Committee has taken a step further in severing relations with Zhang Xueliang's old regime and the Nanjing government in order to seek the happiness of the people and the strength of local autonomy. In the future, we should sincerely and forcefully assist in its completion." It is now decided that Yuan JinKai and others, since the two halls of industry and finance have already been restored, will proceed to restore the two halls of people and education, and are urgently preparing to carry out the clearing of the countryside, with Kan ChaoXi as the false clearing superintendent and Zhao EnZhen MuChun as the organizers (November 13).</p>
<h3>Japanese Ronin Collude With Bandits in Haizhou</h3>
<p>Yangji, Guanyun County, Was Burned and Looted by Bandits</p>
<p>Japanese Flags Were Found in the Bandit Den</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Haizhou borders northern Jiangsu and is very rich in salt. Salt smugglers and bandits gather like locusts. Robberies of vehicles and interceptions of wheels are common. Since the Japanese invasion of the eastern provinces, Japanese warships have sailed to the ports of Haizhou and it has been rumored that the Japanese are secretly helping the Haizhou bandits to seize the salt-producing areas to prepare for military expenses. Therefore, the tragic incident of bandits burning and looting Yangji in Guanyun County on October 31 occurred. Zhang Zhongli, director of the tax police stationed in Banpu, supervised the team to suppress the bandits and seized several Rising Sun flags from the bandits. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>On the night of October 31, the bandits of Longju Town colluded with the bandits of Liudashui in eastern Shudong, Pan Lianmiao, the bandit of Longwangtang, and other bandits to suddenly break through Yangji in Guansu, burning and looting wantonly. Zhang Zhongli, director of the tax police, reported and led Guo Xiwu's three companies of the Independent First Battalion of the tax police, with machine guns, mortars, and a platoon of police from the county police brigade of Li Zhenji. He also ordered Ding Congzhong, captain of the Fifth Tax Brigade, to recruit more than 100 militiamen to participate. He telegraphed Wu Yifeng, captain of the provincial police water police brigade in Xiangshui, and Hu Wenchen, captain of the Third Tax Brigade in Dongzoushan, to lead their respective departments to arrive at Yangji on the morning of November 2, surrounded on all sides, but the bandits had already set fire the night before, kidnapping more than 200 men and women, including the American pastor Mr. Wen Sheng, and fleeing to the fourth team north of Longwangkou. After Zhang Zhongli and others arrived at Yangji, the fire was not yet extinguished. They immediately supervised the various departments to track and pursue the bandits. At the northern end of Longwangkou, they saw from afar that the bandits had occupied the North Fourth Team and the left Zhuang Wangzhuang Chenzhuang and the front and back Yaozhuang area, which stretched for six or seven miles from southeast to northwest. Zhang immediately ordered his troops to surround the bandits from the south, east, and west. On the third day of the attack, after five hours of fierce fighting, Wu Yifeng, captain of the water police brigade, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the bandits, was shot and killed, and the Xiangshui Security Group rushed to assist in the attack. It was not until about 7 pm that the fighting stopped. On the morning of the fourth, Zhang ordered the artillery to cover the attack from the side, captured the artillery tower at the southern end of the bandit nest, and the bandits' morale began to fall. In the evening, the fighting stopped. The government army selected a daredevil team, rushed to the bandit nest, and set it on fire. The bandits collapsed to the north. Later, dozens of bandit corpses and dozens of bandit flags were found in the bandit nest, including two Rising Sun flags and two Rising Sun symbols. It is said that Japanese ronin incited them to participate, which is probably not false. The government troops tracked forward, searched separately, and recovered more than 60 hostages, and also found dozens of hostage corpses and bandit corpses. The corpse of the American pastor Mr. Wen Sheng was also among them. According to the hostages, the bandit leaders San Tuquan, Jiao Buling, Sang Baoqing, and Da Jiangdou were killed in the battle, and more than 100 bandits were killed or wounded. The Liudashui bandit gang fled to Xiaoyi River, and the Pan Lianmiao gang fled to Yilushan. On the afternoon of the fifth, the various bandit suppression teams returned to Yilushan and surrounded the northeast and south sides. Hu Zheng, the district chief of the first district, was also transferred to lead more than 200 militiamen to intercept and attack the south side. After two hours of fierce fighting with the bandits, Hu Wenchen, captain of the Third Tax Brigade, led his troops up the mountain and occupied the peak. Ding Congzhong, captain of the Fifth Tax Brigade, occupied Luzhuang in the south of the mountain. Guo Xiwu, captain of the Independent Battalion, led his troops to seize Maojiachang in the north of the mountain. The Cao Battalion of the 75th Brigade of the 25th Army stationed in Haizhou sent by Liu Guoming arrived to assist, and the morale was doubled. The strict encirclement was carried out that night. At 5 o'clock in the morning of the sixth day, they attacked together. The bandits who climbed the mountain and searched fled down the mountain to the southeast and joined the Liudashui gang and fled. The government troops chased to Xiaoyi River. The Pan and Liu gangs had all disappeared. Zhang Zhongli, because the bandits had fled the salt area and it was inconvenient to pursue, led the team back to Banpu. The corpse of the American pastor was also carried to the Tongxing District Office, where the Public Security Bureau joined the Yangji Presbyterian Church friends to properly coffin him (15th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Enter the Minjiang River</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate in Fuzhou Is Like Facing a Formidable Enemy</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After four Japanese warships sailed into Fuzhou Mawei, the Yuandao sailed deep into Taijiang, causing panic and anxiety. The Japanese consulate in Cangqianshan has 40 to 50 Japanese soldiers with two machine guns and live ammunition, as if facing a formidable enemy. It is also rumored that the Japanese are buying over Taiwanese people and plotting a riot. Although the provincial government has repeatedly negotiated, the Japanese consul has only stated that the ship's visit to the province is to protect僑民 and will leave in a few days, without any further expression. The provincial government is now taking precautions and has ordered the various armies to be on special alert in order to respond. The officers and soldiers of the Second Brigade of the provincial defense army stationed in Fuzhou, with the responsibility of defending the area, are determined not to relax, which shows the unease of the situation in Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Communications Committee Moves to Peiping to Work</h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Since the Shenyang Incident, the personnel of the Northeast Communications Committee fled in panic. Later, some people came to Peiping to visit Chairman Gao Jiyi and report the situation. Mr. Gao immediately ordered to open another room at the Qianmen Railway Station to be used for personnel who came to Peiping to sign in and gather. Later, the leaders of various departments, Lu Jinggui, Zou Zhiquan, and others, came to Peiping one after another and immediately held a meeting to establish a temporary office in Peiping, and borrowed two classrooms from the Traffic University on Fuyou Street for temporary use. Officials from the section chief to the clerks were given a relief fund of 30 yuan each, 15 yuan for clerks, and 10 yuan for servants to maintain themselves. The committee originally sent personnel stationed in Shenyang to take care of important documents, silver, and other items, and those that could be shipped out were secretly shipped to Peiping, and those that could not be shipped out were either destroyed or deposited elsewhere. The seals and small official seals were all reissued. It is estimated that when the committee established a temporary office on October 1, there were 80 to 90 members and soldiers, and more reports came in succession, reaching more than 100 people by October 20. Mr. Gao believed that if the officials were reported without restrictions, it would not be appropriate, so he ordered that November 5 be the deadline for reporting. Those who failed to arrive by the deadline would be dismissed, and those who were unable to come to Peiping due to lack of funds in Shenyang would be given travel expenses (30 yuan per person) and ordered to report to Peiping by the deadline. On the one hand, the houses borrowed from Jiaotong University were only two, which was not enough for office use, and the school was only borrowed temporarily, and it was difficult to maintain it for a long time. The general affairs staff was ordered to borrow dozens of houses in the old site of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Fenzi Hutong, Xisipailou, and speed up the repairs so that they could move in. By the end of last month, the layout was completed, and they moved in on the first day of this month. On the tenth day, the five characters of the temporary office were cancelled and made into a formal office. After moving into Fenzi Hutong, the first step of the committee's work was to notify all communications agencies in the Northeast after the incident that all illegal orders and unauthorized use of public funds without the permission of the committee would not be recognized. The second step was to organize a loss investigation committee to investigate the direct and indirect losses suffered by the Northeast communications agencies after the incident, so that it could be submitted to the commission for the recovery of lost territories as the basis for negotiations (November 14).</p>
<h3>◎ Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Troops Suppress Kong Hechong</h3>
<p>▲ Kong's Bandits Have Fled to Tonggu</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The red bandit Kong Hechong's troops are now entrenched in the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, namely the junction of Pingjiang in Hunan, Xiushui and Tonggu in Jiangxi, and Tongcheng in Hubei. He Jian telegraphed Lu Dipin in Jiangxi, He Chengjun in Hubei, and others, requesting that they send troops to jointly suppress the bandits and ensure the safety of the border areas. It is estimated that a total of four divisions have been assigned to the troops, and they have simultaneously crossed the front lines since the eighth of this month. The recent suppression situation is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Jiangxi Province, Chairman Lu of Nanchang has reported by telegram for several days. (1) The telegram on Yuan Ri said that according to the telegram from Cheng Guangyao, brigade commander of Tonggu, about thousands of red bandits with more than a thousand guns are now in the high mountains in the southeast of Paibu, fighting with Peng's regiment of 澂. Zeng's regiment is concentrating in Xintian. According to Jiang Guinan, the chairman of the captured bandits, the bandits plan to attack Tonggu and Paibu at the same time. According to a self-surrendered person, more than a thousand bandits gathered near Ruoping last night and attacked Tonggu from the direction of Youju, etc. In addition to ordering Yue (Sen)'s brigade to lead troops to assist in the suppression, please forward the telegram to the Hunan army to expedite the joint suppression, etc. Xianggang border areas are stationed with heavy troops. It is a good opportunity to wipe out the Kong bandits. Please order the troops stationed in Pingliu to rush to cross the border to assist in the suppression. (2) Wen Ri's telegram said that according to the real telegram from Liu Yiyi, brigade commander of Xiushui, Zhen Chen sent Wang Jianhuang's regiment to jointly attack the main force of Kong's bandits in Daqiao with a part of Li (Jue)'s division and Deng Nanji's brigade from Longmenchang, Pingjiang, killing more than a hundred bandits and seizing a lot of weapons. The remaining bandits fled to Zhuchang and are being jointly blocked and suppressed, etc. Special report (3) Zhen Ri's telegram said that the bandits who fled to Zhajin had about three thousand people and about five or six hundred guns. After being suppressed by our six nine regiments, they captured fifty or sixty people and fled to Dakeng. Another large group of Kong's bandits with more than a thousand guns fled to Gaochun Huaqiao. In addition to ordering Liu Yiyi's brigade in Xiushui to suppress the area, please order the Hunan border troops to advance eastward from Longmenchang in order to achieve the effect of a pincer attack.</p>
<p>▲ Hunan Province, the provincial government has received telegram reports from the generals of Pingliu for several days. (1) Division Commander Li Jue's telegram from Pingjiang on the 13th said, A. According to Tao's brigade commander Liu's report from Xinjiang on the 12th, all of Tang Xinzhao's regiment have been suppressing various caves in Zhaomen, Xujia, Zhangjia, and Yijiang for days, killing many bandits and capturing nine bandit soldiers including Chen Dongfang. According to the captured bandits, Kong's bandit forces, the false Seventh Division, are moving to Jiangxi due to the difficulty of supplies in Pingjiang and the strict suppression. The main force of the bandits has fled to the Jiuling Huangjindong area. I urge friendly troops to make efforts to block and suppress them so that they cannot escape. B. Zhuang's regiment commander Wen Shu reported on the 12th that he was ordered to suppress the red bandits near Enxi. This morning, he advanced and attacked the bandit's nest, killing forty bandits and destroying twenty-two bandit sentry posts in the bandit area. They are now pursuing them. C. According to Tang Xinzhao, the regiment commander, reported on the 13th, the peasant bandits lurking in GaoTian Yan Shuangyuan Zhaomendong and other places have ordered a battalion to patrol and suppress near Zhaomendong Tianyan, a battalion to suppress near Gao, and a battalion to suppress in Xinjiang Shuangyuan. Many have been captured in the past few days. Most of the people have returned home, but many suffer from malaria and dysentery (2) Division Commander Peng Weiren's telegram from Liuyang on the 13th reported that A. According to Liu Jiren, the brigade commander, the false Seventh Division and the false guard regiment of Kong's bandits, with a total of more than a thousand guns, occupied the Xudong Liuyang 㘭 area. On the 11th, Hu Ti's regiment was sent to Liuyang 抝, and Lan Wei's regiment was sent to attack Dadong, killing many bandits and killing two bandit battalion commanders including Wang Dahe. A Soviet government village was burned in Xidadong, etc. In addition to telegraphing Li (Jue)'s division to send Tao's brigade to assist in the suppression, I respectfully report B. According to Cheng Tiexia, the brigade commander, reported on the 13th, it was reported that the false county Soviet area of Su occupied the Niaoshi, the junction of Liu and Tong, and Du's regiment was sent to suppress it on the 12th. After contacting the bandits, our army divided into two routes to encircle them. The bandits were defeated and fled to Baigongtang, chasing them for twenty miles, destroying two false Soviet houses, and capturing five bandit leaders including Li Ruikui. When returning to defend, they detoured through Maotian and killed Hu Biao, the leader of the false Liudong Red Guard Regiment. On the 13th, Dai's regiment was sent to suppress the bandits in Yangjiaping, and the bandits abandoned their food and fled to Houcheling in separate groups, chasing them to Wangjiadong, killing more than forty people and rescuing more than a hundred refugees.</p>
<p>▲ Hubei Province, Division Commander Xie Bin telegraphed He Jian yesterday, saying that there was no bandit situation in Tongcheng, but the bandits in Gaochapin, Tongshan, were routed by my Liu brigade and hid in the high mountains. It is now ordered that his troops are suppressing Huangsha, special report.</p>
<p>According to the above situation, most of Kong's bandits are fleeing from Pingliu, Hunan, Tongcheng, Hubei, to Jiangxi, and attacking Tonggu, Jiangxi. Therefore, the bandit suppression situation in the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is most tense in Jiangxi (November 15).</p>
<h3>◎Methods for Maintaining Paper Currency in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>▲First, Seal and Store Paper Currency Remaining in Circulation</p>
<p>▲Second, Use Cash Reserves to Restore Convertibility</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the military conflict, the value of Central Bank paper currency in Guangdong fell to 60% of its face value. It soon rose back to 70%. As the unification and peace talks progressed, the value rose slightly again, currently standing at around 80%. The Finance Department, eager to maintain the currency's value, formulated three measures at the beginning of this month to solidify its foundation. The first measure involves the government and merchants jointly sealing and storing paper currency in circulation. The second involves using existing cash reserves to restore convertibility and circulation. The third involves the government and merchants jointly organizing a fund management committee to be responsible for managing the fund and supervising the issuance and countersigning of paper currency. The first measure, of government and merchants jointly sealing and storing paper currency to reduce the amount remaining in circulation, is currently being implemented. The detailed sealing methods are as follows: (1) Referencing the precedents set in 1928 for stabilizing finances and the 1929 agreement between officials and merchants to seal paper currency, the amount of currency to be sealed will be determined based on the capital of the local shops, with different percentages for different sizes of businesses. (2) For the aforementioned paper currency to be sealed, commercial establishments with business licenses, silver shops, and merchant-run banks will seal 30% (i.e., 30 yuan per 100 yuan) of their registered capital. Other miscellaneous shops with business licenses will seal 10% (i.e., 10 yuan per 100 yuan). Those with capital under 300 yuan are exempt. If a store operates both a silver business and a miscellaneous shop, the business license will be the standard. The sealed paper currency will be unsealed after two months. Upon unsealing, the Guangdong Central Bank will provide a monthly interest rate of 6% per 100 yuan. (3) The Finance Department will dispatch personnel to accompany police officers from various public security bureaus, with escorts, to seal the currency at the shops. This must be completed within three days, starting from November 10 of this year. (4) Committee members from the Finance Department will bring wooden stamps, paper, paste, and sealing wax. They will jointly count the paper currency surrendered, noting the number of one-yuan, five-yuan, ten-yuan, fifty-yuan, and one-hundred-yuan bills on a form. The currency will be sealed in the presence of the shop owner, and the total amount of sealed currency will be noted on the seal. After affixing the seal and signatures, the currency will be returned to the shop for safekeeping. (5) If the shop fails to surrender the full amount of paper currency for sealing by the 10th, they must raise the necessary funds by the 12th at the latest and report to the local sub-bureau for sealing. Failure to comply will result in the revocation of the business license and suspension of business. (6) Once the paper currency is sealed, it must not be privately unsealed without an official announcement from this department within two months. Any unauthorized unsealing will be penalized threefold upon discovery. (7) After the paper currency is sealed,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>shops may freely mortgage the sealed currency with local silver shops and banks without breaking the seal. The mortgagee must not privately break the seal, or they will be penalized according to Article 6. (8) Within two months of the sealing, if this department believes that the financial situation has returned to normal, it may unseal and distribute interest payments at any time. After the above measures are implemented, it is estimated that the amount of paper currency scattered in the market will be reduced by 10 million yuan. However, the total amount of paper currency scattered in the market is approximately over 20 million yuan. In addition to sealing, the remaining 10 million yuan will be absorbed by the government through advance tax and salary payments. Specifically, the Finance Department will issue an order to all provincial tax bureaus and companies to advance one month's salary payments. These advance payments will be made in full with the various unredeemed paper currencies of the Central Bank. This will absorb several million yuan of unredeemed paper currency lingering in the market. At this time, the amount of unredeemed paper currency remaining in the market will only be three to four million yuan. The Central Bank will then immediately begin using existing cash reserves and plans to restore convertibility in a short period.

<p>According to Song Ziwen's statement released today, the Finance Committee held a meeting yesterday (the 15th). The Ministry of Finance originally proposed a revenue and expenditure estimate for the six months starting in January of the 21st year. After discussion, there were slight changes. The military expenditure was originally intended to be reduced from 25 million per month to 16 million, but it was not feasible. As a result, it was set at 18 million per month, which is 2 million more than the original estimate. To compensate, 1 million was deducted from the Party and government coordination fund. The temporary and special expenses item is in principle 1 million per month, of which a portion can be diverted. As a result, the originally estimated total expenditure and the deficit can remain unchanged. As for the deficit for the six months, although it is as high as 73.4 million, it can be seen from the listed figures that the principal repayment of domestic debt in this period is 84 million, and the principal repayment of foreign debt is 19 million, totaling 103 million. The deficit is 73.4 million. Therefore, if this plan is implemented, the debt burden will not increase but will decrease by 29.6 million.</p>
<h3>Shandong Antiquities Research Society Second Excavation of the Ancient Tan Kingdom Capital</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Antiquities Research Society, jointly established by the Academia Sinica and the Shandong Provincial Government, excavated the ancient Tan Kingdom capital at Chengziya, east of Jinan City, last winter. They unearthed numerous bone, shell, pottery, and stone implements, making significant contributions to archeology. This autumn, they conducted a second excavation at the site, which lasted 20 days and has now been completed. The unearthed artifacts are currently undergoing detailed research. The excavation process and results are described below: (A) The purpose of this excavation was to supplement the materials from the previous excavation, which yielded many rare discoveries but still required additional evidence for confirmation, and to further study specific questions. Therefore, a second excavation was carried out. (B) The personnel participating in the excavation included Liang Siyong (son of Liang Qichao), Wu Jinding (investigator at Academia Sinica), Liu Yuxia, Wang Xiang, Zhang Shan, and Liu Xizeng (sent by the Shandong Provincial Library), as well as 48 laborers. The total labor units were 657.5. (C) The excavation process began on October 8, after preparations and planning were completed in early October, and continued until October 31. Excluding Sundays, the excavation lasted a total of 20 days. A total of 45 pits were dug, covering an area of 1520.8 square meters. (D) The results of the excavation: By the end of work on October 31, a large number of pottery, bone, shell, and stone artifacts had been unearthed, which were divided into 66 boxes and have been transported to the Research Society (located in the old industrial school in Nanguan, Jinan) for sorting and research. (E) New discoveries of artifacts: In addition to an increase in the number of shell, bone, pottery, and stone implements unearthed this time, new types of artifacts were also discovered (currently being unearthed and confirmed to be different from those previously unearthed; what they are is still under research). (F) Regarding the Tan capital city walls and pottery kilns: The orientation and shape of the Tan Kingdom capital city walls are irregular, probably built according to the scattered tribal settlements of the time. The construction period cannot be definitively determined with available materials, but it is generally judged to be during the Shang Dynasty. There are three pottery kilns for firing pottery outside the city walls, and their shape and structure are well-proportioned. According to research, the construction period is estimated to be the pottery kiln of the Bronze Age. (G) The most important contribution concerns the boundary between the upper and lower cultural layers and the distinct differences between them, which have been largely resolved (the lower layer is the Stone Age, and the upper layer is the Bronze Age). The division between copper and stone can now be clearly seen. The main points of differentiation can be seen on the pottery: (1) Form: Pottery from the Bronze Age has fewer styles and is clumsy, while pottery from the Stone Age has more styles and is more delicate. (2) Pottery quality: Pottery from the Bronze Age contains less sand and has a rough surface, while pottery from the Stone Age contains more sand and has a smooth surface. The coarse ones are extremely coarse, and the fine ones are extremely fine. The earliest pottery has delicate styles and a smooth surface, while later pottery is clumsy and coarse. This is the most surprising thing. (3) Color: Generally, pottery from the Bronze Age is gray, while pottery from the Stone Age is black. (H) The topography of Chengziya and the surrounding terrain have been measured and mapped in detail. (I) A detailed report on the items unearthed in the previous excavation was completed this summer. After the items unearthed this time have been researched, the complete report can be compiled, printed, and published. (J) The excavation staff this time, except for Mr. Wu Jinding, who stayed in Jinan for research, Liang Siyong and others have returned to Beiping and are traveling to Anyang, Henan, to participate in the excavation of the Yin Ruins (November 9).</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Provincial Office Orders a Review of the Boundary Changes of Fengxian County: The Fengxian County Government, in accordance with the General Outline of the Administrative Area Reorganization Methods promulgated by the Ministry, proposed to the two Civil Affairs Offices that some townships on the border between Fengxian County and Songnan County be incorporated into Fengxian County, due to the wishes of those townships. The grounds and reasons for the proposed boundary changes from the Fengxian County perspective were as follows: The western and southwestern areas of Fengxian County are adjacent to the Ye Xie, Huan An, Cao Jing, Qiang Que, and Zhe Lin markets of Songjiang County, and these areas are interspersed within the Fengxian boundary in a complex manner, making governance difficult and creating negative impacts. The robberies at the Hu Jia Bridge and Ruan Xiang, as well as the clashes between the police of the two counties, all occurred within this boundary. Bandits are constantly breeding, making remote capture difficult. Zhe Lin is an important coastal area for defense. It seems appropriate to incorporate the Songjiang County areas that are interspersed within Fengxian County, from the area east of Ye Xie Pond and north of Longquan Port, into the jurisdiction of Fengxian County. The Civil Affairs Office, together with the map drawn by Fengxian County, instructed this county to conduct a detailed review and response. County Magistrate Shen believed that this matter was of great importance and was carefully planning the response when he received another instruction from the Civil Affairs Office stating that if a response was not received, it would be considered a final decision. County Magistrate Shen believed that the division of districts should respect public opinion and, in addition to instructing the 14th and 15th District Chiefs to convene local officials, township chiefs, and deputies to conduct a detailed review and response within seven days, he also responded to the Civil Affairs Office requesting a postponement of the final decision.</p>
<p>The Water Police Department Escorts Bandits to Songjiang: The Water Police First District Department dispatched an inspector today to escort bandit Sun A'bu to the Command Headquarters for interrogation. According to reports, this criminal is a remnant of Cai Yi'a'jin's gang and had previously worked for Cai Yi'a'jin, extorting large sums of money in the Jinshan Ganxiang and Lu Xiang areas. He is also suspected of being involved in the robbery case at the home of Shen Shaoyu in the 13th and 14th Tutelage Groups of Hougang in this county. He was captured by the First Team and is currently being held in the county prison. Yesterday, the District Department escorted two female bandits, Yin Zhao Shi and Xu Shuai Shi, who were responsible for guarding the kidnapped ten-year-old Quan Fa, son of Lu Duji and Han Liansheng. They were captured by Captain Fan Guozhong at No. 1041, Sanyi Lane, Sichuan Road, Shanghai. They have also been escorted to Songjiang for legal processing.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Provisional Court Begins Hearing Cases: The County Government of this county previously received instructions from the High Court that emergency cases endangering the Republic of China should be tried by a provisional court organized by the County Government. County Magistrate Chen, after receiving the order, has already organized the court. Yesterday (the 17th) at 6 PM, the first hearing was held. County Magistrate Chen Fude, along with Judges Huang and Liang, and the court clerk, took their seats in the court. The counter-revolutionary criminals Yu Genbao, Jiang Abing, Chen Baochun, and Zhou Yigen were brought to court one by one for a joint trial. They were then ordered to be returned to custody pending further interrogation and processing.</p>
<p>The Tenth Route Army Arrives in Wuxi: The Nineteenth Route Army of the Central Army, under the command of Chen Mingshu, was ordered to defend the Beijing-Shanghai area and take on the duty of protecting the roads. The Fifth Regiment of the 120th Brigade of the 60th Division, under the command of Liang Zuoxun, was ordered to be stationed in Wuxi. Regiment Commander Liang had departed from Jiujiang a few days ago and arrived in Beijing. The entire regiment of soldiers departed from Beijing for Wuxi the day before yesterday. The regiment headquarters will be located in the Yang Gong Ancestral Hall in Huishan. Other battalions will be stationed in various ancestral halls. The machine gun, mortar, and anti-aircraft gun teams are all stationed in Huishan.</p>
<p>Tai Fu Silk Factory Maintains Resumption of Operations: Tai Fu Silk Factory is jointly operated by Wang Songlu, Shen Zhonghua, Ni Zicheng, and others. It has expanded annually and has had surpluses every year. This year, due to sluggish yarn sales and a depressed market, it has suffered excessive losses and has a large inventory of silk that cannot be sold. There is insufficient capital, and the factory announced its closure last month. It owes over 70,000 taels of silver to the Jiangsu Industrial, Communications, and Three Banks and 140,000 taels of silver to Ruichang, Runfu, Changsheng, Xinyuan, and Fuyuan Qian Zhuang. Including the factory building mortgages and inventory, the total is approximately over 300,000 taels. Afterwards, the creditors believed that the factory still had sufficient silk inventory and could be maintained if working capital could be raised. Yesterday, Wang Songlu, Shen Zhonghua, and Ni Zicheng, in consultation with the banks, mortgaged the existing 75,000 yuan and are allowed to resume operations within days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Exchange</h3>
<p>The County Boundary Committee is Organized: The Tai Ping and other townships in the Tenth District are adjacent to the boundary of Fengxian County. The Fengxian County Government submitted a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Office, stating the reasons for requesting that the townships be placed under the jurisdiction of Fengxian County. The Provincial Office instructed the County Government of this county to review and discuss the matter. Yesterday, the matter was raised at the county administrative meeting, and it was resolved to organize a Nanhui County Boundary Committee. The number of committee members was also determined. The committee will meet at the County Government on the 23rd of this month to discuss solutions to report back.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Opening Rickshaws: Wang Jisheng and others from Wu Yi County submitted a report to the Provincial Office several months ago requesting the opening of 200 rickshaws and offering to pay 5,000 yuan for street repairs. The request was initially approved for postponement. Then, suddenly, when the former Director of the Construction Department, Sun Hongzhe, was handing over his duties, he approved Wang Zikuan and others to open 100 rickshaws. Wang Jisheng and others, upon hearing the news, submitted another report to the Provincial Office stating that they should be given priority to open the rickshaws and continue to pay the street repair expenses, attacking Wang Zikuan and others for setting a bad precedent of extortionate fees. The Provincial Office has now instructed the county to prepare a plan for submission and approval.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Relief American Wheat Shipped to Nantong in Batches: The National Government's Flood Relief Committee ordered the Director of the Nantong Office, Bernard, to ship the first batch of 1,000 tons of American relief wheat from Shanghai to Tianshenggang, Nantong, by November 20, to be transported to the Dongtai, Xinghua, Yancheng, and Funing counties, which were more severely affected by the disaster. A total of 15,000 tons of relief wheat will be shipped to the disaster areas in Jiangbei.</p>
<p>Progress of Reorganizing Local Finances: The local finances of Nantong have recently fallen into dire straits. Various sectors have formed a reorganization committee. On the 16th, the county administrative meeting designated nine committee members: Xu Gengqi, Li Yinong, Qian Xiaowu, Zhao Jianhua, Chen Guanying, Gu Zuoqing, Cheng Houyao, Li Disheng, and Wang Tiaomei.</p>
<h3>Yangzhong</h3>
<p>Rescuing a Young Woman and Executing Kidnappers: On the night of the 28th of last month, the family of Jin Daoquan in Xiaojuegang, this county, was suddenly attacked by over ten bandits armed with long and short guns. They kidnapped Jin's 22-year-old daughter (named Jin Erguang). After receiving the report, the County Government dispatched personnel to investigate and confirm the facts and ordered strict apprehension. On the 30th of last month, in the Qixuigang area of Taixing, the Sixth Patrol Boat of the Fourth Detachment of the Fifth District of the Water Police discovered a bandit boat and captured the bandits Liu Yisheng and Shao Wenhan (aka Li Dalong). Jin Erguang was also rescued. After learning the news, the County Government prepared a document overnight and sent police to escort them back. After County Magistrate Bi and Judge Peng Cheng conducted two joint interrogations, the confessions were confirmed. In addition to ordering that the victim, Jin Erguang, be returned to her father in court, the Provincial Government was requested to approve the death penalty in accordance with the regulations for punishing kidnappers. County Magistrate Bi took his seat in the court on the morning of the 16th, verified the identities of the two criminals, Liu and Shao, and escorted them to the execution ground to carry out the execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Case of Plotting to Murder Husband: Wu Changrong, a farmer in Nanbaonianzhen, owned some farmland. He married his wife, Ding Shi, early in life, and their relationship was still good. Recently, however, they often argued. The previous evening, Wu was hungry and asked his wife to stir-fry rice for him. After eating, he vomited incessantly and soon became unconscious. The family rushed to his aid and he recovered slightly. Upon examining the vomit, it was found to be gone, having been eaten by the cats and dogs he kept. Upon further investigation, the cats and dogs were found dead outside the door. Suspicions arose. Wu Ding Shi wanted people to bury the cats and dogs, but was stopped. The villagers spread rumors that she had plotted to kill her husband. After the local self-defense corps learned of this, they sent Ding to bring Wu Ding Shi and the dead cats and dogs to the city the previous evening and sent them to the court for investigation according to the law. The prosecutor's office opened a court for investigation, and after the interrogation, they were detained. The cats and dogs were handed over to the examiners and forensic doctors for a joint examination to determine if they were poisonous. The results have not yet been announced. It is rumored that her husband died yesterday. The details of the investigation will not be released.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Shops on Jiufu Street Robbed: At 11 PM on the 15th, the Mayongshun General Store in the Dongquanmen Street on Jiufu Street was robbed by four men in short clothes and two men in long gowns, armed with daggers and short guns. Under the pretext of buying goods, they immediately shouted to stop any commotion. They robbed over a hundred yuan in silver dollars and paper money, fourteen small silver dollars, and a gold earpick and hairpin, before fleeing with a whistle.</p>
<p>Multiple Impersonators of Police Officers Arrested: Public Security Bureau Chief An Zheng had heard that impersonators of police officers were using this tactic to extort money. Recently, the Xu family in Fuxue was defrauded of 80 yuan by someone claiming to be the Inspector General, leading two police officers. They took 50 yuan in silver dollars immediately and agreed to collect the remaining 30 yuan the next day. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau learned of this, sent police to lie in wait, and the impersonator actually arrived on schedule and was arrested. The names of his accomplices were obtained. They then went to the Huizhong Hotel in Xincheng and arrested several people, including Wang Yihu and Li Jun, and found forged Public Security Bureau warrants, all stamped with the forged private seal of the Public Security Bureau Chief.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Longjing Kidnapping and Murder Case: Two Bandits Executed: In the previous case where Cantonese merchant Li Jiyun was kidnapped while resting at Longjing Temple in West Lake and brutally murdered at Songhe Villa, three bandits, including Wang Yang and Wang E, had already been executed by firing squad. Two more accomplices in this case, Wang Shizhen (aka Wang Shizhen) and Lv Xueya (aka Zhang Zhenfang), were subsequently apprehended. The Criminal Court sentenced them to death, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government approved the sentence. This morning (the 17th) at 8 AM, the two criminals were brought out to verify their identities and escorted to the execution ground outside Qingbomen to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Seventy-Year-Old Woman Raped: Xiao Chen Shi, a 71-year-old woman from No. 18, Xinliangting, Hushu, Hangzhou, has been making a living selling cigarettes there. Last night around 9 PM, she was already asleep when Chen A'jin, a neighboring farmer, broke into her room under the pretext of buying cigarettes, knocked her down, and forcibly raped her, causing injuries to her lower body. This morning, the woman reported the incident to the Third District Fifth Precinct, and the police arrested Chen and transferred him to the Hangzhou Local Court for legal processing.</p>
<p>Bandit Leader Wu Tianbao Escorted to the Province: Wu Tianbao, the leader of the bandits in Fenghua, had previously gathered a gang of four or five hundred people and committed a series of robberies. After recently robbing a Ninghai steamboat, he hid in Shanghai. Jiang Zhongyong, a detective from the Zhejiang Security Office, was sent to arrest him but was killed. Subsequently, the bandit was arrested by the police, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government sent a special commissioner, Wang Zongmeng, to escort him with four soldiers. He was escorted to the province by express train yesterday and handed over to the Fourth Section of the Security Office for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Xinshi Steamboat Robbed: The Shunfa steamboat, operated by the Jiaxing Tongyuan Bureau between Jiaxing and Xinshi, was sailing from Xinshi to He on the morning of the 16th when, after passing the Qilihui area of Pingwangzhen, three bandit boats suddenly appeared. Thirty to forty bandits, speaking with a Dongbang accent, armed with pistols, ordered the steamboat to stop. They then fired shots as a warning. The bandits swarmed onto the steamboat, first shooting and destroying the steampipes, then proceeding to rob the passengers of all their valuables. The steamboat's purser was also robbed. The total losses are estimated to be enormous. Finally, they kidnapped 14 passengers, including Wu Weiru (manager of the Nanxun Fuda Qian Zhuang), Zhou Shijie (son of Zhou Peizhen, the director of the Hangzhou Mint, from Nanxun), his wife Qiu Shi (daughter of Qiu Baishu), Peng Gongyu (from Majiawan, Nanxun), Hu Tasheng (from Linghu), Ge Guanhua (owner of the Nanxun China Western Clothing Store), and others whose names are unknown. They were taken onto the bandit boat and headed towards Dianshan Lake. The steamboat then sailed to Wangjiangjingzhen, which belongs to Jiaxing County, and reported to the water and land police. After receiving the report, the Water Police District Office and the County Public Security Bureau ordered troops to be towed by steamboat to the scene to investigate. At that time, the Tongxun steamboat, which was dispatched by the Tongyuan Bureau from He, also happened to arrive at Wangjing. Upon learning the news of the Xinshi steamboat robbery, they all turned back to He city to avoid any mishaps.</p>
<h3>Guanyun</h3>
<p>Yangjiaji Bandit Gang Repelled: Guanyun bandit leaders Pan Liansen, Wu Kaifu, and others occupied Yangjiaji on the first of this month, burning and looting wantonly, and killing merchants and civilians. It is now known that Zhang Zhongli, the police chief stationed in Banpu, led troops, together with Ding Guoging, the head of the Chenjiagang merchant patrol, and the nearby water and land military police and civilian corps, to rush to Yangjiaji at dawn on the 3rd, launching a three-pronged attack. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated north. They were immediately pursued, and fierce battles were fought with the bandits in the North Fourth Team. The bandits finally collapsed after being chased to Mount Ruyi. Over thirty bandits were killed, and over twenty were captured alive. About eighty male and female hostages were rescued. It is estimated that the team leader of the water police, Wu Yifeng, one police branch director, Fan Zijiao, and over twenty soldiers were killed in action, and about thirty were wounded. Forty-five merchants and civilians in Yangjiaji were killed by the bandits, including an American missionary from the Haizhou Jesus Church. The body has been identified by members of the church and taken back to the Haizhou Cathedral. Furthermore, many of the hostages who were kidnapped were killed by stray bullets during the fierce fighting on the way. There are still many who have not escaped danger. The town suffered such a catastrophe because Yang Ziyi, a local gentry, opened a gambling den along the street, which led the bandits into the area. Director Zhang has already arrested Yang and is subjecting him to severe legal punishment.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Collection of Arrears in Agricultural Rice from Past Years: The County Government, according to the initial report from the County Granary Administrator Lu Renchu, stated that the agricultural rice borrowed from the Agricultural Rice Bureau to various wards over the years, as of the end of October this year, totaled over 8,000 shi of rice (including principal and interest). Among them, quite a few unscrupulous leaders, vagrants, and dishonest ward officials illicitly borrowed, illegally collected, and arbitrarily embezzled, resisting [repayment].</p>
<p>This has led to a severe shortage of food for the people and reliance on future prospects. Yesterday, the county government issued a notice, ordering households in arrears to repay according to regulations to clear the procedures. Those unscrupulous leaders and corrupt elements who embezzled and have not yet returned [the rice] should be investigated and pursued, and punished according to the law.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Clarifies Doubts Regarding Appointment and Removal of Educational Personnel</h3>
<p>▲Principals of Secondary Schools and Below, and Heads of Social Education Institutions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a clarification regarding the doubts concerning the measures for the appointment and removal of principals of secondary schools and below, and heads of social education institutions. The Ministry sent a circular to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating: The measures for the appointment and removal of principals of secondary schools and below, and heads of social education institutions in various provinces, cities, and counties, have been promulgated and implemented by this Ministry in Instruction No. 445 of the 19th year of the Republic. For the sake of prudence in the appointment of principals of municipal and county secondary schools and heads of social education institutions, this Ministry specifically stipulated in Article 3 that "qualified personnel should be selected and recommended by the municipal and county governments and submitted to the provincial education department for approval and appointment." However, according to reports from various provincial education departments, some municipal and county education bureaus have misunderstood the intent of this article, believing that since the principals of municipal and county secondary schools and heads of social education institutions are selected and recommended by the municipal and county governments, the municipal and county education bureaus should not be able to interfere in any measures taken by the municipal and county secondary schools and social education institutions. However, it is not known that the municipal and county education bureaus are in charge of education in a municipal and county, and they have the responsibility to supervise and promote the secondary schools and social education institutions under their jurisdiction. This responsibility does not change because the principals and heads are selected and recommended by the municipal and county governments. Furthermore, the social education institutions mentioned in the measures refer to those with a larger scale, such as education halls, museums, art galleries, libraries, and public stadiums, as already noted in the parentheses of Article 1 of the measures. As for people's libraries, reading rooms, literacy centers, inquiry centers, people's tea gardens, etc., with simple organizations, they are not included. The above two points should be urgently notified and informed. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for your information and to instruct your subordinates to be informed accordingly. This order.</p>

<p>▲Shanghai University Defeats Qingguang</p>
<p>▲Qingguang Loses in the Second Half In the Shanghai University vs. Qingguang game, the scores were very close in the first half, and it was difficult to tell who would win. The score fluctuated by one point or less. Qingguang led twice, 7 to 6 and 17 to 16. At the end of the first half, Shanghai University won by one point with a score of 20 to 19. In the second half, Shanghai University's coordination improved, and they scored basket after basket. After 28 to 21, the score gradually widened, and Qingguang suffered a setback. Tan Yuanfeng committed four fouls and was ejected, and the situation deteriorated further. Shanghai University's performance was not yet at its best and could be improved further. Wang Xiliang's assists and Feng Li's scoring were both very impressive.</p>

<p>▲Jiangwan Falls Once and Gains the Upper Hand This match was far inferior to the previous one. Ganshi's skills were mediocre. Although they had one or two famous players, there was no coordination. Their roaring like a bull was ear-splitting. Jiangwan maintained the upper hand throughout. The first half was 13 to 10. After 23 to 21 in the second half, Jiangwan gradually gained the upper hand, making it 29 to 23. Finally, Ganshi scored to make it 32 to 27, a difference of five points. Then they scored another basket, getting even closer. The atmosphere became tense. Jiangwan also scored, making it 34 to 31 and winning. Both sides were not very impressive.</p>

<h3>East Asia Sports College Holds Track and Field Meet: Women Break Three National Records</h3>

Due to the flooding of the track and field, the events could not be carried out, as reported in this newspaper. The competition was postponed until the field was usable in recent days and continued. The results of each event were better than in the preliminary competition. The men's and women's groups each set four new school records, and the women even broke three national records.

<h3>Successive Assistance to Heilongjiang from All Circles</h3>
<p>Zhang Fakui Wishes to Lead Valiant Troops to Assist Ma in Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Petition Requesting the Guangdong Authorities to Dispatch the Entire Army to Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Willing to Die for the Country Alongside Soldiers</p>
<p>Also Cables Ma Zhanshan Praising His Understanding of the Greater Good</p>
<p>Vowing to Defend the Northeast with One Heart and One Mind</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, filled with righteous indignation at General Ma Zhanshan's solitary resistance in Heilongjiang Province, specially sent two telegrams yesterday, intending to lead his troops to Heilongjiang to provide assistance. The telegrams are as follows: (Telegram 1) Respectfully to the Fourth National Congress of the Guangzhou, the Extraordinary Conference of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, the National Government, and the Peace Negotiating Representatives in Shanghai: The violent Japanese have abandoned international credibility, destroyed world peace, and, using the methods of robbers and arsonists, have suddenly sent troops to invade and occupy Liaoning and Jilin, seizing territory and sovereignty, slaughtering at will, and devastating the lives and property of the people. The Northeast Defense Army, claiming to number 300,000, has closed its eyes and tied its hands with the words "no resistance," allowing the violent Japanese to act without restraint. The violent Japanese are now even trying to use the old trick of the annexation of Korea, utilizing a few scoundrels to advocate for the "independence of Manchuria," seeking to detach the territory of the three northeastern provinces from the Republic of China and deliver it into the hands of the violent Japanese. Fakui, with eyes tearing and hair standing on end, looks eastward. Recently, I heard that General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang, alone has been able to resist the violent Japanese without fearing the powerful enemy. This is not only somewhat encouraging, rescuing the hearts of the dead and saving the dying national fate, but it is also a resounding blow. Since Fakui joined the National Revolution, he has fought hundreds of battles, large and small, and the warlords who served as running dogs of imperialism have been successively destroyed. From now on, he should turn his blade to directly fight a life-and-death battle with the imperialists. The violent Japanese are the most cruel and inhumane among the imperialists. The Fourth Army under Fakui's command, despite years of fighting and the remaining effects of battles, all gnash their teeth upon hearing of the national crisis, regretting that they cannot spray their hot blood on the mad invaders. Now that the peace negotiations have been concluded, it is time to unite and resist foreign aggression. Fakui has already obtained the consent of all the officers and soldiers of the army, unanimously volunteering to go to the Heilongjiang battlefield to assist General Ma Zhanshan in jointly controlling the deadly fate of the powerful enemy. I respectfully implore you to appreciate our zeal and immediately issue an order for our deployment. Fakui vows to die alongside the soldiers who are serving the country, not to live alongside the soldiers who shamefully steal life with the words "no resistance." In great agitation, I respectfully implore you to consider and accept this. Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, along with all the officers and soldiers, kowtow. Xiao. (Telegram 2) Respectfully to Mr. Ma Zhanshan, Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang: Ever since Fakui heard of the violent Japanese invasion and occupation of Liaoning and Jilin, he has looked eastward with tearing eyes, constantly regretting that he cannot spill this hot blood and spray it on the powerful invaders. The Northeast Border Defense Army, with the words "no resistance," has surrendered Liaoning and Jilin, and shamelessly does not consider it a disgrace, which Fakui cannot bear to hear. Only you can clearly uphold the great principle of defending the territory and fulfill the duty of a soldier, resisting the powerful enemy without yielding, so that Heilongjiang does not become a continuation of Liaoning and Jilin. Hearing of this from afar is extremely encouraging. The Fourth Army under Fakui's command, over the years, has fought hundreds of battles. Although there have been many casualties, the determination to serve the country is as firm as iron. I believe you have heard of this. Fakui has now obtained the consent of all the officers and soldiers of the army and is requesting the central government to immediately deploy us from Guangxi to Heilongjiang to assist you. Fakui deeply believes that all the officers and soldiers of our Fourth Army will be able to work with you with one heart and one mind to preserve this clean land in the three northeastern provinces. If not, then we will spray it with our hot blood. My thoughts race as I send this telegram. I respectfully implore your consideration. Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, along with all the officers and soldiers, kowtow. Xiao.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan Receives Report on Ma Zhanshan's Arduous Battles</p>
<p>Officers and Soldiers All Fight Fearlessly, Wan Guobin Rolls Up Huge Sums to Harbin</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qinglan received a letter yesterday from an important figure in Heilongjiang Province, reporting on the arduous battles of Ma Zhanshan against the Japanese army and the current difficult situation, as well as the fact that Wan Fulin's son, Wan Guobin, rolled up 1.1 million yuan in treasury funds to Harbin, leaving the Heilongjiang treasury empty, making the responsibility of defending the city even more arduous. This report is extremely noteworthy and is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arduous Battles On the 5th of the month, the Japanese side, under the pretext of repairing the Jiangqiao Bridge, sent troops to protect Zhang Hai peng. Our army met them head-on, initially mistaking it for a Japanese consular mediation, and agreed to withdraw fifteen li each. They took advantage of our withdrawal to launch a sudden attack, almost causing the entire army to be annihilated. Subsequently, the bullets and food sent to the front line were mistakenly not delivered due to a small train derailment. Our army had not eaten for two days, and the ammunition was exhausted, leading to successive defeats. Before noon on the 7th, the enemy had already occupied Sanjianfang near Angangxi Station, and the provincial capital was in imminent danger. Fortunately, Chairman Ma rushed to the front line and immediately executed one regimental and one company commander each for cowardice, greatly boosting morale. They then engaged in close-quarters combat with bayonets, while the reclamation army circled around from behind the enemy, and Ding Zhi's railway protection army also arrived with some troops. At the critical moment, they turned defeat into victory and reoccupied Jiangqiao Bridge, narrowly avoiding the loss of the city, which can also slightly wash away the humiliation of surrendering Liaoning and Jilin with folded hands. This time, the junior officers and soldiers all fought fearlessly, with everyone risking their lives. The enemy's casualties were several times greater than ours. It is a pity that those who died were all our compatriots, and bandits dressed in Japanese military uniforms. The Japanese seized our weapons and used them to attack us, driving our ignorant and foolish people to kill each other, their cunning is beyond description. Chairman Ma is currently in a very difficult position: first, there is no one (all are Wan's people, unable to work together with one heart and one mind); second, there is a lack of military supplies and provisions; third, there is no money, all of which has been scraped clean by Little Wan (Wan Fulin's son). However, he is still able to do his best to support the situation without the slightest timidity or laxity. The people have greatly benefited from today's turning of danger into safety. Ma has already replaced Liang Heng, the head of the Public Security Bureau who ran away for the second time, as well as the director of the Food and Forage Factory and the general manager of the official silver office. Some of the department heads and provincial committee members have also run away, and there may inevitably be some changes in the future.</p>
<p>Ma's Brief Biography Ma Zhanshan, styled Xiufang, served as a battalion commander under Wu Junsheng. Later, he entered the pass and served as a military commander. He is currently the garrison commander of Heilongjiang Province and concurrently the commander of the Third Brigade. He is now also acting as the chairman of Heilongjiang Province.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Harbin The Harbin market is depressed, and the financial situation is tense. The exchange rate for Harbin dollars has fallen to 60%, and remittances are difficult to obtain. Each bank has established a financial custody committee, which has severed relations with the Liaoning and Jilin General Bank to maintain operations. This is all thanks to the efforts of He Cehan, the manager of the Three Provinces Bank, who united various sectors to organize this. Wan Fulin's son, Guobin, rolled up 1.1 million Harbin dollars of Heilongjiang treasury funds to Harbin, buying up gold tickets, leaving the Heilongjiang treasury empty. Consuls from various countries have ridiculed Wan Guobao's actions, which is truly lamentable, etc.</p>
<p>The Citizens' Association of the First District Received a Reply Telegram from Ma Zhanshan Yesterday</p>
<p>Only Seeking the Integrity of the Territory, Not Daring to Covet Great Merit</p>
<p>The Citizens' United Association of the First District of this city, formerly believing that Ma Zhanshan, acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, was valiantly resisting the Japanese and serving as a pillar of the country, had resolved to donate 1,000 yuan for military expenses and had first inquired about the location for remittance. Now, yesterday, a reply telegram was received from Chairman Ma, stating: (Omitted above) Upon reading your warm telegram, I am honored by your praise and comforted by your condolences. As soldiers, it is our undeniable duty to serve the country and protect its territory. We only seek the integrity of the territory and dare not covet any great merit. Your patriotic fervor and your consolation to the humble are deeply appreciated. I hereby express my gratitude on behalf of the officers and soldiers of our unit. I beseech you to provide guidance at all times and act as our support. Furthermore, I pray that you remit the funds to our provincial government for verification and receipt. Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province.</p>

<p>The Sichuan Native Place Association Remits 1,000 Yuan The Sichuan Native Place Association in Shanghai telegraphed Ma Zhanshan yesterday, saying: Urgent: To Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Longjiang, addressed to all officers and soldiers: When the Japanese invaders attacked, many did not resist, losing territory and humiliating the country, and many regarded it as a matter of course. Only Heilongjiang's extraordinary army has risen up, striving to defend the endangered territory, repeatedly thwarting the powerful invaders, awakening the unawakened people, shaming the fearful soldiers, demonstrating the true spirit of the valiant soldiers of the north, and expressing the grievances of the Chinese nation. Even if there were none like you before, there will be none after you today. Your heart and your determination are worthy of tears and song. Our association, admiring you, has respectfully remitted 1,000 silver dollars donated by the Sichuan people in Shanghai, as a small token of our respect. At the same time, we have been strongly requesting assistance from the central government to share the burden of your hardship. We still hope that all our soldiers in Heilongjiang will continue to work hard and fight the Japanese invaders to the end.

They will also telegraph the central government, requesting it to immediately send troops to assist the Ma army.</p>
<p>More Than a Hundred Accountants Remit 300 Yuan The colleagues of the accountants of various foreign firms telegraphed Heilongjiang yesterday, saying: Respectfully to Acting Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Qiqihar: You are the key to the northern gate, chilling the hearts of the powerful invaders. The nation's glory depends on you. Our colleagues are eager to express their appreciation, but our ability is limited. We have now raised 300 yuan, representing our colleagues' monthly salaries, which we have immediately remitted to your office through the Bank of Communications as a small token of appreciation for the troops. We will continue to raise funds and remit them to fulfill our duty as citizens. The colleagues of the various foreign firms kowtow.</p>
<p>The Datong Factory Workers, 200 Yuan The Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper transmits to all compatriots and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: We hereby inform you that at the second meeting convened by our association's executive committee today, member Wang Haifan proposed that General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province is resisting the violent Japanese and defending Jiangqiao. His entire army of soldiers obeyed orders without flinching, causing the Japanese army to be discouraged and retreat. When our people throughout the country heard of this, they were all excited and danced for joy. The Heilongjiang army is fulfilling its duty to protect the territory and is deeply worthy of respect. Please initiate a fundraising campaign to reward the soldiers of General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province in order to encourage them and express the support of our members. After discussion, in order to quickly remit the funds, we have immediately requested the Shanghai office (located at 452 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai) to allocate 200 yuan in national currency, which will be delivered to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for consolidated remittance. The funds will be deducted from the 20% bonus for the year. We know that a cup of water cannot put out a fire, but it is a small expression of our sentiments. We hope that all sectors of the country will respond together. We respectfully announce this and wish you peace. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Datong Yarn Factory Workers respectfully announces.</p>

<p>The Rescue Team Member Zhang Gan Cut Off a Finger The Heilongjiang Rescue Team, which set off from the Southeastern Medical College in Zhenru, consists of 30 members in total. Team member Zhang Gan felt particularly indignant towards the violent and barbarous actions of the Japanese. Yesterday, when the team held a meeting to discuss the situation, Mr. Zhang spoke very sorrowfully and then cut off his finger with a knife, with blood flowing freely, to vow his determination to resist the Japanese. All the classmates present were moved by this.</p>
<h3>The Martial Law in Zhabei is Extended</h3>
<p>Postponed to 12:00 AM</p>
<p>The Guard Corps also advanced their defense schedule</p>
<p>Since the Northeast Incident occurred, the situation in this city has suddenly become tense. The tax police corps stationed in Zhabei received an order from their superiors at the beginning of this month to implement strict martial law before the 16th. Therefore, traffic was cut off after 8:00 PM. Yesterday marked the end of the 16th. Although martial law is still in effect, the time has been extended to about 12:00 AM. However, if there are temporary orders, the original schedule may not be followed. The Guard Corps in the district was also ordered yesterday to advance their patrol schedule to maintain public order and prevent petty criminals.</p>
<h3>The Military Police Corps Office Has Found a Location</h3>
<p>Director Wang Wei has requested to resign due to illness</p>
<p>The address is inside the Second Branch of the Fifth District of Zhabei</p>
<p>Since the Tianjin Incident occurred, the defense of this city has been very strict. The district and branch offices of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, as well as the police brigades, guard corps, and the Ministry of Finance's tax police, are on patrol day and night, ensuring public order. As for the joint office of the military police corps, its internal departments include four sections: general affairs, intelligence, planning, and public relations. The director is Wang Wei, and the deputy director is Wang Zhijing. It was originally intended to borrow the Huzhou Guild Hall on Huiwen Road in Zhabei as the office, but because the Second Regiment of the Tax Police is stationed at the Huzhou Guild Hall, the office has not yet moved in. A location has now been found at the Second Branch of the Fifth District on Qiujiang Road in Zhabei as the office, and responsible personnel are stationed there permanently. In the event of temporary incidents, announcements can be made at any time. Internal office staff have already been appointed, but the section chiefs are still under consideration. It is reported that Director Wang Wei has requested the garrison headquarters to approve his resignation because the position of director is very important and cannot be left vacant due to his illness.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Will Not Return to Guangdong for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei, the representative of Guangdong, spent the entire day yesterday at his residence, receiving guests. In the afternoon, visitors included Wu Chaoshu, Zhang Fakui, and Huang Hanliang, representatives of merchant groups in this city. As for the recent telegram from Guangdong requesting Wang to return to Guangdong, according to those around him, Mr. Wang received a telegram from Guangdong urging him to return, but only to attend the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session in Guangdong Province, with no other business. Therefore, Mr. Wang has decided not to return for the time being. One reason is that it would be inconvenient to contact the Nanjing representatives after going there, and the other is that as the peace negotiations have just been concluded, if Wang and others go to Guangdong together, it is feared that negative rumors will arise. Therefore, he will not leave Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<h3>News of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting of the Anti-Japanese Association The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held its 20th Standing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the standing committee room of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

The association has already remitted 10,000 yuan to reward the generals and soldiers. Please approve the retroactive recognition of this matter. Resolution: Retroactive recognition is approved. (4) The Design Committee submitted seven proposals. Please implement them separately and request a public decision. Resolution: Member Fang Jiaobo is assigned to review them.

Resolution: To be submitted to the general assembly.

<p>Public Announcement Regarding Matches The Anti-Japanese Association issued Announcement No. 15 yesterday regarding the matches of the Ruizhong Foreign Firm and the Minguang Company: Purchasing and using domestic goods is the duty of every citizen. In recent years, the domestic match industry has made increasing progress and is sufficient for the use of the Chinese people. Regarding the matches of the Ruizhong Foreign Firm and the Minguang Company, the association has conducted a detailed investigation, and the results are as follows: (1) The Phoenix, Earth, and Bridge brand matches of the Ruizhong Foreign Firm are indeed produced in Sweden by various factories of the Swedish Match Company and have no connection with Japan. (2) The Minguang Company was originally founded by the Japanese, but due to poor business, the business rights have been transferred to the Ruizhong Foreign Firm. Its products, including Bowl, Green Tree, Rose Tree, Red Boy, Cartwheel, Temple Character, Four Horses, Ancestral Hall, Gold Chain, and Ruyi brands, are either manufactured by other foreign factories or by the Japanese-owned Suisheng Match Factory in Shanghai. The situation is complicated and difficult to distinguish. (3) For example, 7,200 paper boxes of matches of the Ruizhong Foreign Firm are stored in Warehouse No. 27 of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. They are all Ruyi brand matches produced by the Japanese-owned Suisheng Factory, with the words "Minguang Company" printed on the box. Because the report states that the various brands of matches of the Minguang Company are not Japanese goods, the facts are hereby stated. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will uphold the enthusiasm for promoting domestic goods, distinguish right from wrong, and not be deceived. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Organizational Authority of the Anti-Japanese Association The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce resolved yesterday that the Anti-Japanese Association is not bound by other groups in its decision to punish unscrupulous merchants and sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Merchants in Minhou County, stating: In reply, we received your valued telegram on the 16th of this month, and we are fully aware of the situation. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this city is a joint organization that brings together important figures from all walks of life and is not limited to the business community. Its resolutions represent the public opinion of the citizens. Therefore, once a decision is made to punish unscrupulous merchants and goods, the punished person may request a review or reconsideration, but it is not bound by other groups. The aforementioned information in your telegram is hereby replied to, and please take note.</p>
<p>Ban on Unloading Japanese Ships Carrying Fish The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Forwarding and Reporting Gate Industry Association yesterday, stating: In reply, we received the reply letter from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this city, stating: We have received your letter stating that the Japanese ships Qing'an Maru and Rong Maru are carrying Russian salmon to Shanghai. Your association is responsible for reporting gates and dare not be involved in transporting Japanese ships. Please reply for verification. We approve of this. If the fish is indeed of Russian origin but is transported by Japanese ships, it violates our principle of economic severance of relations. The case has been resolved at the 17th Standing Committee meeting of this association and is not allowed to be unloaded. In addition to replying to the Forwarding and Reporting Gate Industry Association to inform them of the decision, we are also recording the case and sending a reply. Please take note. We inquired about this matter with your association before, and we forwarded the letter to your association for verification. We are now sending a reply as aforementioned. Please take note.</p>
<h3>Merchants' Petition Delegation Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>More than 160 trade associations in this city dispatched delegates Ma Shaoji, Luo Qinghua, Zheng Chengqing, Ye Jiaxing, Xie Zhongle, Zheng Hairuo, and more than 20 others to Beijing to petition the Fourth Plenary Session. The delegates returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is reported that they were received by Yu Youren in Beijing. The delegates presented their petitioning opinions in detail: (1) Guarantee peace, (2) Prepare for resistance against aggression, (3) Eradicate banditry, (4) Rectify finances, and (5) Increase production and achieve labor-capital coordination. Yu responded to each item, roughly stating that the congress had already issued a declaration today, and that the central government's overall intention was to adhere to the principles of no compromise externally and no contention internally. Since domestic peace and unification have been completed, the eradication of banditry can be easily resolved. As for rectifying finances and increasing production, these are fundamental national plans, which will be submitted to the congress for implementation. He hopes to work together with compatriots across the country. At this point, the delegates were satisfied and bid farewell, taking the night train back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks for Swift Resolution on Handling Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Eighteen Trade Associations Jointly Urge</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday, urging them to quickly discuss and handle the methods for dealing with sealed Japanese goods previously submitted. The letter states: "Regarding the matter that on the 16th of this month, we received letters from the city's cotton cloth industry, southern goods industry, new medicine industry, knitted goods industry, department store industry, sugar industry, seafood store industry, Chinese woolen factory industry, northern and southern goods exchange industry, flower industry, medicinal materials industry, ginseng and bird's nest industry, mercerized cotton weaving industry, seafood and sundry goods industry, yarn industry, flying flower industry, paper industry, and other trade associations, stating that because our country's industry and commerce are not prosperous and production is backward, we have to rely on foreign goods for everything, including industrial materials, raw materials, and common supplies. Among foreign goods, Japanese goods account for half, which is undeniable. However, since the Japanese forcibly occupied the eastern provinces, the merchants and people of this city have been filled with righteous indignation and unanimously advocated economic severance with Japan as a passive form of resistance. Therefore, all industries have voluntarily sealed up their old Japanese goods, with a total value of no less than tens of millions of dollars. The various losses are countless, but sacrificing for the country is nothing to regret. However, these tens of millions of dollars are all the lifeblood of our Chinese merchants. In other words, the sealed Japanese goods were purchased with funds from Chinese merchants, and the ownership has long been transferred from Japanese merchants to Chinese merchants. Therefore, although they are called Japanese goods, their essence has already become Chinese merchants' goods. No matter what degree of sacrifice is made, it has nothing to do with Japanese merchants. They even deeply hope that we will destroy them to inflict a great blow on our country's finances. Because our country's commercial practice relies purely on the smooth flow of market finance for the operation of business funds, either by offsetting goods or by rotating credit. Therefore, of this huge sum of tens of millions of dollars, two or three tenths belong to the capital of the respective businesses, and seven or eight tenths belong to the loans of the silver and money industries. If they are permanently sealed up without finding a way to unclog them, then when silver is tight and the economy is exhausted, Shanghai's finance will inevitably go bankrupt. Shanghai is the center of commerce in our country and holds the hub of national finance. Therefore, the bankruptcy of Shanghai's finance is also the bankruptcy of national finance, and the disaster it will cause is unspeakable. Moreover, according to the original meaning of economic severance, it is nothing more than wanting the Japanese side to feel economic pain. If the result is the opposite, how can we explain ourselves? Our association and others are in charge of the business, and our knowledge is deeper. What we feel is dangerous, and we cannot but speak out. Fortunately, we read in the newspaper yesterday that your association's implementation of the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan has already decided on six measures for the disposal of sealed Japanese goods in various industries. It still embodies the intention of comforting merchants and revitalizing industry, and plans comprehensively, showing concern for commercial difficulties, which is deeply admired. However, as the end of the year approaches, the collection and payment of accounts must be completed, and the public is in a panic, hoping for relief every day. Therefore, we jointly request your association to promptly implement these measures to maintain finance and prevent major disasters." After receiving the letter, the association checked that this matter had been sent to your association for consent, and a reply was received to hand it over to the Design Committee for consideration and handling. Now, according to the previous situation, we are sending another letter to you for your review and handling."</p>
<h3>Party and Government Organs Jointly Issue Notice to Stop the Great Eastern Bookstore Strike</h3>
<p>Simultaneously Dispatching Personnel to Mediate, with Workers Proposing Preconditions</p>
<p>After all the employees of the Great Eastern Bookstore's head office in this city went on strike because the company was insincere in accepting the terms of treatment, yesterday, the party and government organs jointly issued a notice to stop the strike and dispatched personnel to mediate. The workers proposed preconditions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Notice for Cessation The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Joint Notice No. 45 Regarding the matter of jointly issuing a notice, it is reported that Shen Junsheng, manager of the Great Eastern Bookstore, stated that the workers of the bookstore suddenly went on strike on the morning of the 16th of this month, and organized a strike committee to take charge, violating laws and obstructing business. He requested strict sanctions. In response, it is found that during this period of national crisis, both labor and capital should endure for the sake of the country and should not cause disputes. This association has already issued a notice to all industrial and commercial groups, and jointly with the municipal government, jointly issued a notice to all sectors of the city to abide by it. The workers of the Great Eastern Bookstore, at this time of serious national crisis, went on strike without authorization, clearly disregarding laws and endangering public order, which is very wrong. According to the previous report, in addition to this association strictly ordering the publishing industry union to order a return to work, it is urgently necessary to jointly issue a notice to the workers of the bookstore to strictly abide by it and immediately return to work on the day the notice arrives, and wait for this association to mediate according to law. Do not disobey, lest it cause inconvenience. This is the notice. Standing Committee Members Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Tao Baichuan, Director Pan Gongzhan, November 17th, Republic of China Year 20.</p>
<p>Party and Government Instruction to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Yesterday, the publishing industry union was instructed: "Regarding the matter of compliance, it is found that during this time of national crisis, labor and capital should coordinate, and this has been repeatedly ordered and warned. (Omission) This time, the workers of the bookstore suddenly went on strike, and neither submitted a report to the bureau beforehand nor reported afterwards, which is obviously intentionally violating government orders and disturbing public order. According to the previous report, in addition to issuing a notice jointly with the municipal party department, it is urgently ordered that the union comply with the instructions, and immediately order those responsible to persuade the workers to immediately restore the original state and wait for investigation and verification. Do not be accommodating, lest it cause inconvenience. This is the order." Yesterday, the municipal party department also instructed the publishing industry union, similar to the above (omitted).</p>
<p>Preconditions After receiving the instructions from the municipal party department and the Bureau of Social Affairs, the publishing industry union, responsible for persuading the workers to return to work immediately, immediately instructed the branch offices of the Great Eastern Bookstore to comply. All the employees were quite angry because the company was too insincere and were unwilling to return to work, and proposed preconditions: (1) The Great Eastern Bookstore recognizes the branch offices of the Great Eastern Bookstore. (2) A subsidy of 60 yuan per month for the operating expenses of the branch offices. (3) Terms of treatment to be negotiated sincerely immediately. If the goal is not achieved, they vow not to return to work.</p>
<p>Attempting Mediation He Yuanming from the municipal party department and Wang Bing from the Bureau of Social Affairs went together yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to attempt mediation. They first went to the publishing industry union to contact the director Wang Yongliang, and then went to the Great Eastern Bookstore to negotiate with the manager Shen Junsheng. The preconditions proposed by the workers were discussed in detail. It is heard that the opinions of labor and capital were divided, resulting in no solution.</p>
<p>Strike Committee The strike committee of the Great Eastern Bookstore held its first strike committee meeting yesterday. It was decided that during the strike period, all members must strictly abide by the following disciplines: (1) Absolutely obey the orders of the strike committee. (2) During the strike period, do not contact the capital privately. (3) During the strike period, strictly maintain order and do not engage in out-of-bounds actions, and do not enter the company privately. (4) Those who sabotage the strike will be regarded as traitors to the working class, and a strike declaration will be issued, drafted by the propaganda department. At the same time, a victory newsletter will be published. Furthermore, the branch offices of Commercial Press, World Book Co., and China Wisdom Book Co. held meetings yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss assistance matters.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Union and Other Unions Assist in Various Labor-Capital Disputes</h3>
<p>Submitted Documents to the Municipal Party Department and the Bureau of Social Affairs Yesterday</p>
<p>The Postal Workers' Union of this city, the Postal Employees' Union, the Press Union, the Toothbrush Union, the Pharmaceutical Union, the Pharmacy Union, the Second District Shipbuilding Union, the Sauce Industry Union, the Fragrance Industry Union, the First District Knitting Industry Union, and the Cotton Weaving Unions of various districts, totaling more than 40 unions, stated that the various labor-capital disputes in this city have been delayed and not resolved. Yesterday, they submitted a document to the municipal party department and the Bureau of Social Affairs for assistance. The original text stated: "Regarding the Silk Dyeing and Mercerizing Office, the Fourth District Egg Industry, the Second District Knitting Industry, and other unions separately complaining that the capital side is violating the orders of the party department and the government and oppressing workers, requesting that the affiliated unions and others provide unanimous assistance. In order to impose strict sanctions on the respective capital side, to demonstrate authority and show impartiality, according to the Silk Dyeing and Mercerizing Office, the Fourth District Egg Industry, the Second District Knitting Industry, the Bookbinding Industry, the Publishing Industry, the Steamboat Wood Industry, the City Brewing Industry, and others, they have successively dispatched representatives to make a full appeal to the affiliated unions, stating that recently the respective capital side has been oppressing workers, disregarding the laws and regulations of the party department and the government, and especially requesting that the affiliated unions and others provide full assistance. According to the case, domestic factories are using the excuse of a lack of raw materials to stop work, which has already been prohibited by the Ministry of Industry. However, the capital side of the Daxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory turned a deaf ear and still used the above-mentioned excuse to close the factory on the 19th of last month. The facts of their contempt for the law and oppression of workers are all there and need no further explanation. The Fourth District Egg Industry has been approved by the party department to organize a union, but the capital side has dismissed workers. The Meiya Knitting Factory dismissed workers for no reason. The Labor-Capital Dispute Mediation Committee of the Bookbinding Industry Union, together with both labor and capital, signed a treaty, but the capital side delayed in fulfilling it. The Zhonghua Minzhi Bookstore dismissed workers for no reason. The capital side of the Steamboat Wood Industry Union violated the orders of the municipal government and the court and withheld labor business fees. And the case of Huji Winery dismissing workers has been repeatedly mediated and arbitrated by the钧部局 and the Shanghai Municipal Government, but the capital side has still delayed in complying. Where will the party-state discipline and government authority be placed? Moreover, our party advocates a policy of protecting labor, and the union is guided by our party. All labor-capital disputes are subject to the arbitration of party and government organs. Now the capital side alone can defy and disobey. From an active point of view, workers are losing their protection and are full of suspicion and fear, which has a destabilizing effect on society. From a passive point of view, our party is failing in its responsibility to guide workers, and workers are losing their faith in our party. What are the long-term consequences? Furthermore, in recent years, the capital side has frequently used increasing production as an excuse to oppress workers. The affiliated unions and others have thought about it again and again and found it to be a fallacy. In fact, the industry in Eastern and Western countries is so developed that it is beyond our country's ability to catch up. However, in reality, most of them are based on the principle of labor-capital cooperation, and depriving labor will not enable them to obtain the assistance of labor to increase national production. This is very obvious. Summarizing the above points, we see that the capital side's oppression of workers is inappropriate. Therefore, we are presenting it to you in detail and earnestly requesting that you impose strict sanctions on the respective capital side to ensure the authority of the party and government and truly fulfill the responsibility of protecting labor. Those who are in arbitration are also requested to handle it impartially. We are awaiting orders with extreme urgency."</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Firewood Falling into the Kerosene Tank and Burning Five People to Death</h3>
<p>Wang Wu cannot shirk responsibility; Wang Zhicheng narrowly escapes death</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew open the thick smoke, revealing the window, allowing him to jump down</p>
<p>At 11:45 AM on the 14th of this month, a fire broke out in the home of Wang Wu, a woman from Haimen, at No. 886-7 North Sichuan Road, due to carelessness while cooking, causing firewood to fall into a kerosene tank. The fire quickly spread, extending to the Xie Da stable at Nos. 882-885, which was next door. The Hongkou Fire Brigade drove to the scene and extinguished the fire. Six houses were burned down, and four women and one boy were burned to death on the spot. The Huishi police station in charge arrested the fire starter, Wang Wu. The prosecutor went to the morgue to examine the bodies, ordered the bodies to be collected by the family, and ordered Wang Wu to be sent to the Special Court for review due to her negligence. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Wang Wu to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council is prosecuting the defendant under Article 187, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for the crime of endangering public safety and Article 291 for the crime of causing death by negligence. The defendant Wang Wu lived upstairs at No. 886-7 North Sichuan Road. The downstairs was a garage with a car. Next door, Nos. 882-885, was the Xie Da Carriage Company. At 11:30 AM on the 14th of this month, the defendant was cooking downstairs. Because it had been raining for days and the firewood was damp, she poured kerosene on it. After finishing cooking, the defendant took the vegetables upstairs, causing the firewood in the stove to fall into the kerosene tank and catch fire. Because the houses in the area were old and dilapidated, they were easy to burn, and it was impossible to control the fire. Moreover, there were 25 gallons of gasoline stored upstairs. By the time the fire brigade arrived, the fire had already spread to the next door. After a long time of pouring water, it was extinguished. Six houses were burned down and five people were burned to death. Therefore, the police station is prosecuting the defendant according to law. Moreover, Clements, a Westerner from the Hongkou Fire Brigade, submitted evidence of the previous situation. Wang Shouhua, a local, 54 years old, who runs the Xie Da stable on North Sichuan Road, stated that he was not at the scene when the fire broke out, but the five people who were burned to death were all members of his family: (1) his wife, Wang Zhang; (2) his daughter-in-law, Wang Xu; (3) his daughter, Chen Wang; (4) his uncle's wife, Zhang Lu; and (5) his grandson, Wang Jinbao. Wang Zhicheng, Wang Shouhua's son, stated that he was 17 years old. When the fire broke out, he was upstairs, but he did not hear the defendant shouting. When he heard people outside shouting, he opened the window and saw that the fire was raging. He quickly helped his mother and others to go downstairs to escape, but the stairs had been burned down. He changed to escape from the drying platform, but it was also on fire. At that time, the smoke was thick and he could not distinguish the location of the doors and windows. Then he suddenly saw a gust of wind blowing open the thick smoke, revealing the light from the window. He jumped down, fell on the road, and was helped by an plainclothes policeman to a carriage in the alley opposite. The remaining five people, including his mother, were all burned to death. When questioned, the defendant Wang Wu stated that because the firewood was wet, she bought eight copper coins worth of kerosene from a cigarette paper store nearby and poured it on the firewood. After finishing cooking, she carried the vegetables upstairs. Unexpectedly, the firewood fell into the kerosene tank and overturned, causing a fire. She quickly shouted "Fire!" and ran upstairs to take her child down and escape. Later, the fire was extinguished by the fire brigade. After Judge Feng verified the testimony, he ordered the defendant to be detained for questioning again in seven days.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Human Traffickers Arrested on the Huaan Steamer Yesterday</h3>
<p>The child traffickers are all from Fujian. One boy was rolled up in a straw mat</p>
<p>Seven human traffickers, ten trafficked children In recent days, a large number of human traffickers have been discovered in Shanghai, specializing in abducting young boys and girls everywhere, taking them to various places outside the port, selling them for profit, separating families, which is extremely hateful. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team cracked three trafficking cases in one day yesterday, arresting more than ten male and female human traffickers and rescuing more than ten trafficked boys and girls. The details are recorded below. At around 1:00 AM yesterday, Wu Minshen, the chief of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, police officers Liu Jinshan, detectives Yang Chunting, Liu Changdu, etc., were patrolling the river near the Dada Wharf in Shiliupu when they saw the Huaan steamer docked there, not yet setting sail. They immediately boarded the steamer for inspection. They found old woman Zheng Huang, leading a boy, woman Zhang Tang, carrying a boy and a girl, Wang Li, carrying a boy, Lin Dong, carrying a boy, and Ni Zheng, carrying two boys, all of whom were one year old or so. The old woman and the women were all from Fujian. Two Fujian women, Zhang Zhong and Lin Chen, each carrying a boy, about three years old, looked flustered when they saw the police team arrive, which was very suspicious. After questioning them one by one, their words were evasive, so they were all detained. At that time, there was a roll of straw mat standing next to the women. Suddenly, crying was heard from the mat roll. The police became suspicious and tried to untie the rolled-up straw mat. They suddenly discovered a boy, about three or four years old, holding a piece of chicken cake, a pear, and tears on his face, crying. They asked who brought the child, but no one answered, so they were also taken into custody. Xu, the captain of the team, took the case. During the preliminary hearing, Zheng Huang, 53 years old, stated that the boy she was carrying was her grandson, but the rest of her words were vague. Lin Tang, 22 years old, stated that the boy and girl she was carrying were given to her by a Lin who she knew. Ni Zheng, 27 years old, stated that the two boys she was carrying were her twin sons, but the rest of her words were evasive. Wang Li, 29 years old, and Lin Dong, 35 years old, were vague about the origin of the boys they were carrying. Zhang Zhong and Lin Chen stated that the boys they were carrying were their own biological children. When questioned, the boys they were carrying also said that the two women were their biological mothers. The boy rolled up in the straw mat said that his name was Ye Yuecai, he was four years old this year, and he was from Ningbo, living on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. A man he didn't know tricked him into coming out to play a few days ago, and then he was rolled up in a straw mat, taken to the ship, and forced not to shout. Then he was given pears and cake to eat, and told to eat them. Because he was trapped in the mat, he was extremely frightened and cried. The police immediately sent someone to summon the child's grandmother, Ye Du, who stated that the child was born to her widowed daughter-in-law and was a posthumous child. The child disappeared five days ago, and they searched everywhere without knowing his whereabouts. The family was very anxious about losing their beloved child and had attempted suicide several times. As the case involved a large number of abducted children and was of great importance, in addition to releasing Zhang Zhong and Lin Chen who were not involved in the case, the rest were prepared and submitted to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Three human traffickers, four trafficked children At around 2:00 PM yesterday, the police officers discovered three women carrying four boys on the steamer, who were suspicious. They were immediately taken into custody. During the preliminary hearing by Captain Xu, one woman stated her name was Shao Ren, 25 years old, from Fujian, one stated her name was Liu Zhang, 40 years old, from Fujian, and one stated her name was Dai Chen, 42 years old, from Fujian. Their words were evasive about the origins of the boys they were carrying, which was undoubtedly a case of abduction. They were ordered to prepare documents and send them to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>One man, one woman abducts one woman At around 3:00 PM yesterday, police chief Yang Bingkui, police officer Li Yunting, and detectives discovered a man and two women on the steamer. They were flustered and uneasy when they saw the police arrive. Upon questioning, their words were evasive. They were immediately taken into custody for preliminary interrogation. One woman stated her name was Li Afeng, 14 years old, from Huzhou. One of the women who came with her was named Qiao Aying, who used to live next door to her, so they knew each other. A few days ago, she came to my hometown and took me to Shanghai to play, lodging at Qiao Aying's house in Pudong. Qiao also told me that Fujian was much more fun than Shanghai. If you are interested, I can take you there for a trip. I was overjoyed when I heard this, so I followed her on the steamer today. As for the man, I don't know him. When questioned, Qiao Aying initially argued, but after repeated questioning, she stated that she was 23 years old, from Haimen. The man in question was named Chen Yulin, who she knew. A few days ago, she took Li Afeng to Shanghai to play. Chen caught sight of Afeng, who was beautiful, and repeatedly asked her to help him trick her into going to Fujian to sell her. Because she was embarrassed to refuse, she acted rashly. When questioned, Chen Yulin stated that he was 26 years old, from Fujian. The rest of his words were confused. At that time, Li Afeng, as if waking from a dream, recalled Aying's sweet words at the time, which were actually intended to trick her into going to Fujian to sell her. Fortunately, the police team cracked the case midway and she did not fall into their trap. She felt angry. Captain Xu ordered that as the case involved the abduction of a young girl with the intention of selling her, they should be prepared and transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Tian Shulan's Nationwide Journey Begins Towards Fujian</h3>
<p>Mr. Tian Shulan, formerly a professor at Minzhi Middle School, with a firm resolve to travel throughout the country, departed from Shanghai at noon on July 1st of this year. Following a pre-determined itinerary, he headed first to Zhejiang Province. Along the way, he passed through important locations such as Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Chuzhou, Jinhua, and Quzhou. On the 9th of this month, he arrived at Jiangshan County, at the border of Zhejiang and Fujian, thus completing his journey through Zhejiang Province. On the 11th, Mr. Tian, accompanied by his comrade Mr. Wang Zimin, crossed the Xianxia Ridge and began entering Fujian. Yesterday, Mr. Tian sent a letter to people in the Shanghai education circles, as well as to Minzhi alumni and his younger brother in Shanghai. The findings of his investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Completion of the Trial Journey in Zhejiang Province: Mr. Tian left Shanghai on a bicycle on July 1st. Until the 9th of this month, the route he took was: Songjiang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Cixi, Yinxian, Xikou, Fenghua, Ninghai, Tiantai, Linhai, Huangyan, Haimen, Wenling, Yueqing, Yongjia, Qingtian, Lishui, Jinyun, Jinhua, Lanxi, Longyou, Quzhou, Jiangshan, and other places. During the journey, he traveled 1,020 li by bicycle, 870 li on foot, 320 li by train, and 270 li by ferry, totaling over 2,500 li across 26 counties. The branch lines where he went back and forth, either by bicycle or on foot, were approximately 400 li.</p>
<p>Investigation Plan: Mr. Tian, with unwavering perseverance, travels around the country to investigate folk customs and geographical conditions. He includes in his plans all aspects of social education, famous mountains and rivers, and actual conditions along the way. The experience of Mr. Tian's journey has slightly changed his original plan: (1) In terms of transportation, in addition to cycling, he initially walked. However, since departure, he found railway-side paths inconvenient for transporting a heavy bicycle, and walking along the railway tracks was limited. Accommodation and food were also difficult. Mr. Tian's purpose in traveling was to investigate the natural and human conditions throughout the country. Therefore, he regarded such hardships as a necessary sacrifice and decided to use some of the profits from selling maps, forms, souvenirs, and commodities along the way to hire trains. Therefore, after Jiaxing, he took a train for about 320 li and a ferry for 270 li after Linhai. (2) Extending the investigation time is a practical necessity. Mr. Tian's original plan was to travel around the country for six years, but his experience over the past four months, observing along the way, has shown that it cannot be completed in six years. At the same time, he felt regretful about only scratching the surface. The products and local customs of Ninghai are gradually becoming slightly different from those of Jiangsu Province. To collect inherent geographical data, or those not found in textbooks, he has to conduct detailed investigations. In Fujian and Guangdong, except for the educated class who speak the national language, it is very difficult to communicate with ordinary people. However, the customs and local conditions are very different from those in the north and can be collected in large quantities. Therefore, he plans to extend the time for traveling and investigating by two or three, or three or four years. However, the planned route in the south remains unchanged, so the results of the investigation will certainly be better than the original motivation hoped for.</p>
<p>Tibetan Poem Presented to Mr. Tian by Mr. Xiao Bida, Director of the Tibetan Affairs Department of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission</p>
<p>Encountering a Comrade on the Road: Mr. Tian arrived in Jiangshan County in Zhejiang Province, having traveled for four months. He planned to cross the Xianxia Ridge and enter Fujian, when he met Mr. Wang Zimin, a traveling comrade from Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province. Mr. Wang had departed from Zhenjiang on foot on January 6th of this year to travel around the country. His purpose was to investigate the country's wasteland, study soil quality, examine agriculture, mines, and factories, as well as scenic spots, historical sites, languages, and customs, with the aim of promoting the realization of immigration policies in the future. His journey covered Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Zhejiang provinces. On the 8th of this month, he walked to Jiangshan County. The two gentlemen met unexpectedly. After meeting, they shared their thoughts and had a very pleasant conversation. Their goals and attitudes, itineraries, and plans did not conflict much, and they both felt lonely on the long journey. Finding each other like-minded, they believed that cooperation was possible and decided to implement a spirit of mutual assistance from the 9th, travel together across Xianxia Ridge, and work together to advance their journey. As for the route, Mr. Wang was willing to sacrifice his pre-determined plan for Mr. Tian's detailed plan and extend his six-year term by another three or four years, so that they could delve into the barren lands. The two gentlemen departed from Jiangshan County again on the 11th, heading towards Fujian. They rely on selling maps, souvenirs, and photographs along the way to maintain their livelihood. They also issued slogans saying that our wishes are: (1) To set a precedent for Chinese travelers to engage in exploration; (2) To break the Western perception of "China having no explorers"; (3) To conduct on-site investigations of the natural and human conditions in various regions; (4) To break down regional and ethnic concepts (all under heaven are one family, all seas are brothers); (5) To communicate opinions among various ethnic groups to promote world harmony; (6) To regulate population migration and colonize wasteland; (7) To promote equal freedom for all ethnic groups in the world.</p>
<h3>The National Government Flood Relief Commission Appoints Simpson as Deputy Chairman</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the National Government Flood Relief Commission announced that Sir Simpson has been appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Commission and Director-General of the General Office. Chairman Song, considering the severity of the disaster, telegraphed the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, requesting the introduction of personnel with rich experience in disaster relief to come to China to manage all disaster relief matters. The League of Nations recommended Mr. Simpson and others, who were formally hired by the Flood Relief Commission. Mr. Simpson readily agreed. Since arriving in Shanghai at the end of last month, he has temporarily served as the acting secretary-general of the Commission.</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson has extensive experience in disaster relief. He served in British Indian government agencies for 27 years, holding various prominent positions. He presided over disaster relief efforts in India on several occasions. He resigned in 1916 and returned to England, where he worked for the Department of Labor, organizing an information office. In 1922, he was elected as a Member of Parliament. In 1924, the British government appointed Mr. Simpson as Chairman of the Indian Colonial Committee. Two years later, at the invitation of the League of Nations, he served as the Deputy Chairman of the Greek Refugee Settlement Commission, handling the resettlement of 1.3 million refugees who returned to Greece from Turkey. His achievements were remarkable.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Chinese Business No. 2 Tram</h3>
<p>The China General Edison Company issued a notice yesterday stating: "To inform you, for the convenience of passengers, the company will increase the number of trams on the No. 2 line running on Zhonghua Road, starting from the 25th of this month, and extend the route. From Xiaodongmen, via Dongmen Road, along the Bund, it will directly reach Xuejiabang as the terminal for turning around. The stations passed are listed as follows: Laoximen, Xiaoximen, Dananmen, Xiaonanmen, Dadongmen, Xiaodongmen, Shiliupu, Guanqiao, Dongjiadu, Xuejiabang. (1) Customers from Laoximen who want to go to the Bund, Dongjiadu, or various wharves to take small ferries, and those who want to take long-distance buses and ferries to Shangnan, can reach directly without changing cars. (2) Passengers from Xuejiabang north of the Bund who want to go to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station to take the No. 5 tram of the concession, and those in the western part of the Public Concession who want to take the No. 6 tram of the French Concession, can connect and transfer at Laoximen, which is particularly convenient."</p>
<h3>Hailong Wheel Towed Back to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Junpu Bureau's Hailong vessel was sunk by a German merchant ship outside Wusongkou on August 18th. At the time, three crew members drowned. Afterwards, the Bureau entrusted a Japanese salvage company to send technicians, workers, and divers to the site of the accident aboard the Haiyuan Maru vessel to engage in salvage work. After more than two months of work, the salvage was successfully completed on the 14th of this month. It was then towed back to Shanghai by the Haiyuan Maru and the Nisshin small steamer Kunshan Maru and immediately sent to the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs.</p>
<h3>Industrial Circles Initiate a Carbonate of Lime Factory</h3>
<p>Since the rise of the anti-Japanese movement, the industrial and commercial circles of our country have unanimously severed economic ties with Japan. For several months, the effects have been remarkable. However, general domestic goods factories have been greatly affected in terms of raw materials. Carbonate of lime is the most difficult item. Mr. Fang Yixian and others in the local industrial circles, in view of this situation, raised 250,000 yuan to initiate the Zhao Xin Chemical Factory Co., Ltd., specializing in the manufacture of carbonate of lime and magnesium carbonate to meet the needs of domestic goods factories. The founding meeting was convened yesterday at No. 150 Binlang Road, the main factory of the China Chemical Industry Society. The factory building has also started construction and is expected to be ready to ship goods around December next year. Its output is about 1 million pounds per month, which is indeed good news for the cause of resisting Japan and domestic goods materials.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Property Held in the Course of Business</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>He Zhicheng, a native of Suzhou, on the morning of the 7th of last month, at about 10 o'clock, sneaked into the Lili Jewelry Store at No. 31 Wusong Road. Under the pretext of consignment of ornaments, he colluded with three Japanese rogues to defraud the store of four diamonds worth 5,480 yuan. He sold the stolen goods at Tianchengxiang Jewelry Store inside the Xinbeimen, obtaining 2,800 yuan. He hired Chen Jinlong, a native of You Tong County, to help him move and redeem the clothes he had pawned in the past, giving him a total of 560 yuan. He fled to the capital and then to his hometown. After the case occurred, the Hongkou Police Department sent detectives to Suzhou to arrest and bring He to Shanghai. Subsequently, Lu Jinlong was also arrested. The diamonds have been redeemed from Tianchengxiang Jewelry Store by Zhou Chunbo, a shareholder of the store, with funds. The statements of the two defendants after being sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation have been recorded in this newspaper. The case has been concluded and is awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced He Zhicheng to two years of imprisonment for embezzling property held in the course of business, and Chen Jinlong to six months of imprisonment for receiving stolen goods. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Unemployed with Ten Family Members to Support</h3>
<p>Xu Shanxiang Desperately Throws Himself into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>At about 6 p.m. the night before last, a man over forty years old threw himself into the Huangpu River at the Huatong Wharf of the Taikoo Company in Pudong. He was discovered by nearby boatmen, who immediately rescued him. They notified the wharf police, who transferred him to the Third District. The district chief interrogated him and learned that his name was Xu Shanxiang, 41 years old, from Cixi, Zhejiang Province. He used to work as a clerk in the Jiaxing Unified Tax Bureau, but the bureau has now been reorganized, and he was laid off. There are still ten people in his family, big and small, who depend on him for their livelihood. Therefore, his life has been greatly affected. He came to Shanghai to look for work last month, but his efforts have not been successful, and he has run out of money. Unable to return home, he had no choice but to commit suicide. His words were full of sorrow. The district chief ordered him to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for relief.</p>
<h3>Inquiry into the Private Installation of a Radio Station</h3>
<p>Without the Permission of the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives of the Political Department of the French Concession Police learned that the Tianling Company at No. 47 Hehefang, Xiafei Road, had privately installed a radio station without obtaining a license from the Ministry of Communications, which violated the Telecommunications Regulations. They reported to the Political Department Director and requested the Second Special District Court to issue a search warrant. At 6 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, they went to the company's broadcasting room and searched out nine items, including a radio transmitter, high-frequency motor, vacuum tube radio, amplifier, storage battery, and resistor, and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they summoned Zhang Jianqiu, the manager of the company, to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the defendant had privately installed a radio station without the permission of the Ministry of Communications, which violated Article 3, Item 5, and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Regulations, and should be punished with a fine of 5,000 to 2,000 yuan according to Article 21 of the same regulations. The police, upon receiving the court's search warrant, went to search out the machinery and filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting a trial and judgment according to the regulations. When interrogated, the defendant Zhang Jianqiu stated that he had applied to the Ministry of Communications for registration and a license in April and had received approval, but the license had not yet been issued. He is currently testing the sound and the Municipal Education Bureau sends personnel every Wednesday and Saturday to give reports, etc., and hired a lawyer to defend him, presenting documents from the Ministry of Communications, etc., to the court. After Judge Wu Fanglian reviewed the documents, he said to the defendant, "The Ministry's approval does not mean permission. You should install the equipment after receiving the Ministry's license, which would be legal." The defendant had no response. The official ordered a postponement for further investigation and interrogation. The defendant was ordered to post a cash bail of 500 yuan. Upon the lawyer's request, the court approved a reduction to 300 yuan cash bail. The defendant paid the cash bail in the afternoon and was released pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Fined Sixty Yuan for Hitting a Chinese Police Officer</h3>
<p>Lu Peiwang, a chauffeur from Yangzhou working for the Sichuan Automobile Company at No. 472 Xiafei Road, drove car No. 12609 on a business trip at 11 p.m. on the 3rd of this month. While driving through Lafay Road, he accidentally hit five upper-class Chinese police officers from the French Concession Police who were passing by, injuring their hands, feet, waist, and back. His fellow patrol officers recorded the license plate number and reported to the head of the police, who sent Lu to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. He was interrogated and a verdict was scheduled to be announced. Yesterday, when the date of the verdict arrived, Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the First Criminal Court in the morning, ordering the defendant to be brought to court for questioning, and then sentenced Lu Peiwang for the crime of negligent injury, fining him 60 yuan. If he is unable to pay the fine, he will be imprisoned, with two yuan counting as one day. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the fine at a rate of two yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Li Henian Pays 3,000 Yuan Shop Bail</h3>
<p>Fined One Hundred Yuan for Carrying Opium</p>
<p>Ma Xiao-jun's son Zhi-chao, former member of the Guangxi Provincial Government, along with Li Henian, Cheng Chunlin, and American Chinese Li Yaoguang, opened the Sino-American Banking Company at No. 13 Guangdong Road. Ma himself served as the general manager, Li Yaoguang as the manager, Li Henian as the general inspector, and Cheng Chunlin as the secretary. Ma Xiaojun and foreigners McLein and Na'an served as directors. The opening was scheduled for August 3rd of this year. On one hand, they advertised in newspapers to recruit male and female employees. Consequently, Lin Zhijie and Ms. Wu Shiying (i.e., Wu Ming) saw the advertisement and applied for the job. The company deemed them qualified and appointed Wu as a clerk in the cashier department with a monthly salary of 60 yuan, and Lin as a clerk in the deposit department with a monthly salary of 40 yuan. They were also asked to pay a security deposit of 1,000 yuan each. Lin and others, unaware of the fraud, paid the required amount respectively. However, the company went bankrupt after only two months of operation. Ma and others fled without a trace. Wu and Lin then hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to sue Ma and the other four at the First Special Court. The court issued a warrant and Li was arrested. The details of the interrogation and detention have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Gongliang opened the court for a continued hearing. Wu Shiying and Lin Zhijie successively filed lawsuits, proving that the security deposits they had paid were given to Li Henian. They also stated that although Ma Zhichao was the general manager, he had to ask Li Henian about everything before handling it, so Li's power was actually greater than Ma's. When questioned, Li Henian stated that he was recruited by Ma Xiaojun to assist his son in running the business, and he also paid a security deposit of 200 yuan and deposited 350 yuan in the company. I am also one of the victims. As for the security deposit that the plaintiffs said they gave me, it is not true at all. He hired a lawyer to request permission to post bail. Judge Jiang reviewed the statements and ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing. Li Henian paid 3,000 yuan shop bail. Li was also fined 100 yuan by Judge Shen of the Special Court for privately possessing opium.</p>
<h3>A Tutor Lost His Job, Lost Gambling, and Hanged Himself</h3>
<p>Liu Tongsheng Actually Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Liu Tongsheng, a native of Funing, who had limited knowledge, was over sixty years old. He lived with his elderly wife, Mrs. Wang, at No. 16 Tongchunli, Changan Road, Zhabei. He used to make a living by tutoring children. Recently, due to the crackdown on private tutoring, Liu lost his job and stayed at home idle. Liu was addicted to gambling, and he could be found in all kinds of gambling dens, such as pai gow and dice stalls. Unfortunately, his luck was bad, and he lost every time, leading to heavy debts. Recently, he even took out his elderly wife's clothes and jewelry to pawn them off and went to the gambling den to make a final gamble, but he still lost. Mrs. Wang found out and quarreled with Liu, giving him earnest advice, but Liu was obsessed with money and did not change his ways. The day before yesterday, he stole more than ten of his elderly wife's burial clothes and pawned them for eight yuan, and still went to gamble. In a few minutes, he lost everything. His wife went to the gambling den, found Liu, and cried loudly, wanting to fight Liu to the death. Liu was filled with remorse, and the creditors were chasing him, so he developed a desire to end his life. On the night before last, while his elderly wife was asleep, he untied his belt and hanged himself. When Mrs. Wang realized it, his body was already cold as ice, and there was no way to bring him back to life. After the police in charge of the area found out, they ordered the local guarantor Shen Xiaohe to report the case to the local court for an examination. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Yang, accompanied by an examiner, went to the scene to examine the body and declared that the wife should arrange for the coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Wang A-Qiao Attacked by Thugs with Knives</h3>
<p>Probably Related to a Woman</p>
<p>Wang A-Qiao, a native of Ningbo, 22 years old, used to work as a waiter on a ship. He lived at No. 1, Maurice Materri. However, Wang was addicted to gambling and often went to the opium den set up by Suzhou doctor Ai Boying in the east wing on the second floor of No. 10 Yuqing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession, for card games. He made it a habit every night. At about 8:40 last night, Wang went alone again. After entering the room, he sat down next to the No. 3 opium couch in the south. Just as he was about to call someone to join the game, more than a dozen thugs suddenly rushed in. One of them held a pistol, and several others held sharp axes. Seeing Wang sitting there, they rushed up without asking any questions, dragged Wang down, and hacked him with their axes. They stabbed him more than a dozen times. At the same time, they also stabbed him several times all over his body with sharp knives. When Wang cried out for help, the thugs scattered and fled downstairs without a trace. Dr. Ai ran to the Grand Bell Police Station to report. The head of the police immediately sent Officer No. 74 to investigate the scene. He saw Wang lying in a pool of blood. Upon closer inspection, he found that Wang had an ax wound on his right waist, which was the most serious, one on each foot, and more than a dozen knife wounds. Wang was unconscious. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries were too severe, and his life may be in danger. According to Dr. Ai, Wang has a concubine named Lao Qi, who used to be a prostitute. She used to have an affair with Officer Wang Lao Wu of the Public Concession Police. Before long, Lao Qi had an affair with A-Qiao and broke up with Officer Wang Lao Wu. Then she lived with A-Qiao. The attack by the thugs may have something to do with this relationship.</p>

<h3>Liukegou Coal Mining Company Shareholders Meeting</h3>
<p>The Liukegou Coal Mining Company held its annual shareholders meeting on the 15th of this month at the company's headquarters at 38 Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai.

This is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Merchants and Residents Write to the Public Works Bureau Requesting the Construction of Mud Roads</h3>
<p>Several dozen stores in Zhabei, including Wan Hong Nanhuo Store, Wan Tai Rice Store, Fu Chang Nanhuo Store, De Tai Feng Tai Porcelain Store, Hua Cheng Department Store, Xie Sheng Rice Store, Wan Xing Nanhuo Store, and Wan Sheng Cigarette Paper Store, jointly signed and stamped a public letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of requesting construction: We merchants have observed that since the news of the construction of the new municipal government in Zhabei spread, merchants and residents in Shanghai have been moving north one after another, so the development of the Zhabei market is rapidly growing. However, due to the vast area, daily necessities are difficult to concentrate, and many residents still feel inconvenienced. Recently, although the two-story reinforced concrete vegetable market and municipal buildings at the intersection of Datong Road and Zhongxing Road have not yet been completed, they have already been almost entirely rented out, and the surrounding market is even more active, seeming to have a situation of 'too many monks and not enough porridge,' with supply falling short of demand. This shows that the market is far more developed than in the past. It is a pity that the important main roads in Zhabei, such as the new Datong Road, which connects the Nantong Concession to Liuhe Zhenru in the north, and the mud roads in the west section of Zhonghua Xin Road and Tiantong'an Road, which traverse the center of Zhabei, have not yet been developed. As a result, landowners who have purchased land, although wanting to build houses, cannot proceed with their plans and are waiting to see. If the mud roads can be developed as soon as possible, not only will landowners be able to find ways to build houses, but also the land prices along the roads will surely become more active, the market will definitely develop further, and the municipal revenue will also increase. The future development is immeasurable. However, as the case concerns municipal facilities, we merchants dare not remain silent, and hereby submit this document to your esteemed office for review, so as to benefit the municipality and its citizens. This is truly a matter of public convenience. Respectfully submitted to Shen, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau."</p>
<h3>Wu Tianbao Escorted to Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Tianbao, a notorious bandit from Fenghua, Zhejiang Province, opened fire to resist arrest at No. 1 Beidi Fang, Beidiaolu, in the French Concession on the 24th of last month. After escaping, he hid in the home of Sun Naitai, a Ninghai native, at No. 9 Taiheli, Baierbulu. The special agency of the French Concession Police learned of this through undercover detectives and went to arrest Wu, along with Sun Naitai and Sun's nephew, Ji Ying, and friend Zheng Dezu, a total of four people. They were taken to the police station, and a handgun and nine bullets used for resisting arrest were found at No. 18 Gansidong Road. They were sent to the Second Special Court. It was ordered that they be held for interrogation along with Wu's concubine, Ms. Yang, and others who had been arrested earlier. This has been reported in previous issues. Yesterday was another scheduled interrogation date. At 10 a.m., the police escorted Wu and the six men and women to the Criminal Division of the court. Judge Luo Renji opened the court for the hearing. First, Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, stated that the police did not object to the Zhejiang Provincial Government's extradition of Wu Tianbao, but Wu had also committed murder in the Concession and should be tried and sentenced. There was no evidence of criminal activity by Sun and the others, so no charges were filed. In addition, Wang Zongmeng, a special agent sent by the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office, arrived to request the extradition of Wu Tianbao. He also stated that the provincial government had received a confidential report that Zheng Dezu had also committed crimes in Zhejiang and requested permission to transfer him back to the province for investigation. Wu Tianbao confessed to opening fire to resist arrest and said that Sun Naitai was not involved. He had not entrusted anyone to protect his wife and concubines. Sun had previously been a regimental commander in the army, and he had been a squad leader under him. Sun Naitai testified that Wu was a squad leader when he was in the army sixteen years ago. He only knew him as Wu Binghui and did not know that he had committed crimes in Zhejiang. He came twice this time and asked him to vouch for him, and so on. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. Sun Jiying testified that Naitai was his uncle. He had recently come to Shanghai from his hometown to look for work and was staying at his uncle's place. He knew nothing about Wu's affairs. Zheng Dezu testified that he was friends with Sun Naitai. This time, Sun asked him to bring firewood and coal to make connections. The official told Zheng that he had received a document from the Zhejiang Provincial Government stating that he had committed many crimes in Zhejiang and was to be extradited. Zheng replied that he had always been a boatman and had never dared to commit any crimes. Judge Luo verified the testimonies and ordered Wu Tianbao and Zheng Dezu to be handed over to the Zhejiang Provincial Government's representatives, along with the gun and bullets, to be taken back to the province for trial. Sun Naitai was allowed to be released on bail of 2,000 yuan or by providing a store guarantee, and the hearing was rescheduled for the morning of November 23. Sun Jiying, Wu Yangshi, and Wang Xiaohui were all released. It was reported that in the afternoon, Wang Zongmeng, the Zhejiang representative, and his entourage took Wu and Zheng away and took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train back to the Hangzhou court. Police detectives were sent by the police to escort them to the station.</p>

<h3>Dongtai Pengcha Zhai Duo asks</h3>
<p>(Using Domestic Raw Materials to Make the National Flag)</p>
<p>Since the violent Japanese invasion of our Northeast, and the massacre of our people, compatriots throughout the country are calling for a boycott of Japanese goods and an economic severance with Japan. Organizations in various regions are very enthusiastic about the work of resistance. However, I see that the party and national flags are mostly made of Japanese goods, using red foreign labels, Haichang blue foreign cloth, and white bamboo cloth as raw materials. The red foreign labels are Japanese goods. The white base of Haichang blue foreign cloth is also inevitably Japanese goods. Although there are Western goods among the white bamboo cloths, some are Japanese goods. The national flag is intended to promote national prestige and develop the national spirit. How can it be appropriate to use foreign goods? And at this time, in the midst of resistance, local organizations should be reminding the public to refrain from using Japanese goods. How can they hang the party and national flags made of Japanese goods in the auditoriums? I propose that all organizations in the country use domestic raw materials for the party and national flags. Is this appropriate? Please advise.</p>
<p>(Reply) Of course, domestic goods must be used for the national flag, but I hope domestic manufacturers will hurry up and make them for use.</p>
<h3>Xu Shangqian asks</h3>
<p>(How to Persuade People to Love Their Country)</p>
<p>I am just a junior high school student with insufficient knowledge. The other day I read the newspaper and suddenly discovered a sad thing. It turned out that Japan had forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces and burned down our government offices and massacred our people there. I was very indignant when I read it, and angrily told my friends about it. However, my friends did not listen to me and instead scolded me, saying, "What does the affairs of the country have to do with us?" I thought about it and could not come up with a good way to make them know how to love the country, so I would like to ask you for guidance. This is my greatest hope.</p>
<p>(Reply) To persuade people to love their country, you should first identify some important tenets, set an example, and strive to start with yourself. At the same time, persuade others to make the same efforts. As for the method of persuasion, you should use the painful history of national subjugation, such as the brutal treatment of Koreans by the Japanese when Korea was subjugated, and the recent violent occupation of our territory and the massacre of our people, to preach tirelessly at any time and any place, so that those who listen will be shocked. The ancients said, "When the nest is overturned, can any eggs remain intact?" After the country is subjugated, not only life, property, and everything else will lose their protection and perish with it, but people will also be knives and meat, and they will be slaughtered by others. The pain at that time is truly irredeemable. I think that no matter what kind of self-seeking person, there is no one who does not cherish his own life and property. If you can make him deeply understand the close relationship between the country and the family, know that there is first a country and then a family, love the country because you love your family, and treat "national difficulties" as "family difficulties," and regard someone invading our country as invading our family property, then you should try your best to protect it. Why is it that officials who are responsible for defending the territory are indifferent and hand it over without resistance? I hope that you will act with the spirit of an enlightened person, and make unremitting efforts to guide and persuade, and never be discouraged, so that you can succeed.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, In accordance with the order of the mayor, I am sending the letter from Murai Kuramatsu, Consul-General of Japan stationed in Shanghai, which translated as follows: "On the 11th of this month, the Shen Bao published a special dispatch from Peiping entitled 'Jin Liang Incites Puyi,' which stated, 'And he produced a handwritten edict from the Japanese Emperor, stating that if Puyi was willing to do this, the Japanese army would use all its strength to help.' My Imperial Household would never easily interfere in matters related to national relations. The article is intended to insult the dignity of my Imperial Household and is deeply harmful to Sino-Japanese relations. I hereby request that you forward this letter to the newspaper for correction." In accordance with this order, I am sending this letter for your information and action. Sincerely, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, November 17.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read the news in today's edition of your esteemed newspaper about the strike by all employees of the Datong Bookstore, which is not in accordance with the facts. Yesterday, only a few employees of the bookstore went on strike, only the letterpress printing, color printing, and typesetting departments. The General Store on Simalu Road and the business department of the main factory printing plant are still operating as usual. The General Affairs Office, the Translation Office, and the Securities Printing Department are also working as usual. There was no all-employee strike. Please correct this. Sincerely, Datong Bookstore, November 17.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I was very surprised to read the news in the newspaper that the union representative of the Dahua Match Factory was beaten. The 217 bales of poplar wood that were sealed by the factory were purchased from the Chinese merchant Yichangyong on June 13. The rest of the wood was purchased from the Jiu Ji National Products Factory in Nanshi, which can be verified. There is no room for concealment. The workers' mutual beating and strike are not related to the inspection of Japanese goods. Since the anti-Japanese movement, the factory has vowed not to import Japanese goods again. The factory has already registered the previous Japanese goods with the Anti-Japanese Association, and the Industry Association has forwarded the registration. Fearing that the rumors are inaccurate, I would like to state this for your information. Sincerely, Dahua Match Co., Ltd., November 15.</p>

<h3>Memories of the Carved Beam</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Since the Liaodong incident, the brutal Japanese have disregarded public opinion and forcibly occupied various areas of Yingkou. A traveler returning from Yingkou recounted what he had witnessed, and the various cruel acts were hair-raising and infuriating. Japanese soldiers patrolled the streets, using the excuse of disturbances by rioters to protect foreign residents and maintain order. They always moved in groups of four, carrying rifles with fixed bayonets. If a pedestrian accidentally approached them without paying attention, they would stab wildly with their bayonets. Any resistance would result in arrest and severe punishment at the headquarters. If one endured the pain and fled, the soldiers would mock and sneer to show their triumph. They paid particular attention to those wearing Western suits or long robes. Even a group of four or five people chatting on the street would be attacked. However, they treated poorly dressed and dirty laborers with great leniency, believing them to be ignorant and therefore not a threat. Although the Japanese commander had issued notices ordering businesses to operate as usual, the market was desolate, with no customers all day long. Residents remained indoors, afraid to step outside their homes. Wealthy families had evacuated completely, and those with some savings had mostly disguised themselves and fled far away. The scene was desolate, bringing tears to the eyes of all who witnessed it.</p>
<p>Not Removing the Courtyard Grass: Miscellaneous Talks by a Vegetarian</p>
<h3>Franklin (5)</h3>
<p>One of the Biographies of Young Apprentices</p>
<p>In 1736, a Scottish monk named Gordon invented an electric bell in Germany. It had a bell on each side, with a metal ball suspended by a thread in the middle. When the ball was charged with electricity, it would repeatedly strike the bells due to the principle of repulsion between like charges and attraction between opposite charges. He also discovered that electrified water could ignite alcohol.</p>
<p>Amidst these sporadic inventions, the marvelous Leyden jar suddenly emerged. In 1745, Dean Von Kleist, and in 1746, Pieter Van Musschenbrock, independently discovered that frictional electricity could be stored in glass jars. Because Kleist lived in Leyden, in the Netherlands, the jar was named the Leyden jar. However, based on the order of invention, the credit was misplaced. Initially, water was used to store electricity in the glass jar. Later, Watson improved the jar by lining the inside and outside with tin foil instead of water, which was much more effective. Abbe Nollet in France had the Emperor’s guards stand in a line, hand in hand, forming a circuit. As soon as the large amount of electricity stored in the Leyden jar was connected, all the soldiers fell down simultaneously.</p>
<p>This was the extent of knowledge about artificial electricity that humans had gained before Franklin entered the electrical stage. At that time, it was not yet proven whether the electricity of the sky was the same as artificial electricity. The electricity of the sky was considered a mystery and a matter of guesswork, while artificial electricity was used for playful experimentation.</p>
<h3>Ji Ke's Discussion of Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits’ invasion of China is infuriating and causes one’s eyes to crack with rage. The atmosphere of war is brewing, and the drums of war are beating faster every day. Sun Tzu said, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." Therefore, it is essential for us to understand what Japanese soldiers are really like. My friend, Mr. Hong Zuoqiao, has lived in Japan for many years and is familiar with their affairs. Yesterday, he discussed the Japanese conscription system. According to their laws, all citizens have the duty to serve in the military. Therefore, most of their people have received considerable military training. Even women have knowledge of nursing. Men aged twenty-one to twenty-four must serve in the military for three years. Except for those with disabilities or illnesses, no one is exempt. After twenty-four, they become reservists, and the country can still call them to the battlefield in times of crisis. When soldiers go to war, they all consider dying in battle an honor. Every family pastes paper labels on their doors, similar to the peach charms used in China during the New Year. Ninety percent of these labels read "Pray for death in battle," which is courageous and intense and not commonly seen in the West. Each soldier receives only seven copper coins per day, which seems very frugal. However, food, lodging, and even small things like bathing and haircuts are provided by the camp, without costing them a penny. Cigarettes and snacks are also sold at very low prices, which is unheard of elsewhere. The country provides cheap goods specifically for soldiers to enjoy. Near the military barracks, they have also established military brothels, similar to the military prostitutes of the Han Dynasty in China, for soldiers who do not have wives. Prostitutes are examined by medical officers, and those with syphilis are immediately removed. Soldiers can spend an evening with them for fifty cents, enjoying the pleasures of yin and yang. All these things are done to comfort the hardships of the soldiers. Obligations are like that, and rights are like this. Therefore, once there is a change, they all dedicate themselves to the country, determined to be buried in their horsehide armor. Being elite and brave, they cannot be defeated except by an army that has fought hundreds of battles. What is worrisome is that since their victory over Russia, their officers and soldiers have become arrogant and often act rashly. As the saying goes, "Pride comes before a fall." If our soldiers can exploit their arrogance and subdue them, then there may be hope of annihilating the enemy.</p>
<h3>A Primary School Student's Patriotic Indignation</h3>
<p>The Japanese are tyrannical and have occupied our Liaoning and Jilin. Anyone with any spirit is enraged. Wang Guizhang and Wang Hezhang, siblings who are primary school students at the Shuren Academy in Shanghai, were filled with patriotic indignation after being taught by Mr. Yuan Mingshan. They even wanted to drop out of school and join the army. But in reality, they were still children, too weak to fight even a chicken. After their parents persuaded and forcefully stopped them, they took their savings from pens, ink, and snacks, totaling eighty silver dollars, and entrusted someone to send it to Heilongjiang to reward General Ma Zhanshan and his troops. They also wished to donate their father's national language award money, totaling forty silver dollars, to help build a memorial tower for General Han Guangdi. Readers, upon reading this, how should you be inspired?</p>
<h3>Epitaph for Mr. Dong's Living Tomb</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shukui</p>
<p>Mr. Dong, whose courtesy name was Zhichu and given name was Hao, was from Yin County, Zhejiang Province. His grandfather, Qinggao, was awarded the title of Wu Yi Duwei, with a peacock feather and the rank of a colonel. He was the eldest son of Mr. Bingsheng. By nature, he was sincere and honest, able to be close to his parents, being warm and attentive without fault, and his filial thoughts were inexhaustible. Colonel Dong commanded naval vessels such as the "Measuring the Sea and Golden Basin" on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and also led the trained troops of the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau. He constantly traveled between his two parents at the beginning and end of Wu and Chu, moving gently within the court to please them. Colonel Dong died at the age of fifty-two. Thirty years later, his mother, Madam Chen, also passed away. Summing up Mr. Dong's life, the years he served his mother surpassed those he served his father, and his care for them in life, burial, and sacrifice was both easy and solemn. Both before and after the mourning periods, he conducted himself according to ritual. The clan and community praised him. Mr. Dong was good at managing property and was also familiar with police studies. He served as an official and engaged in trade, with his footprints covering half of China, traveling through the north and south of the Yangtze River and even reaching the Lingnan region. Wherever he went, he caused a stir, and people vied to associate with him. He was a superior and outstanding man. He loved wine and indulged in drinking, often consuming several dou (a unit of dry measure) or shi (ten dou) amounts, winning or losing by guessing fingers. The sounds of battle and shouting filled the drinking scenes, shaking the beams and rafters. He often got drunk without regret. Wine lovers respected him and regarded him as their leader. Because of his frequent drinking, he fell ill. Following the doctor's advice, he abstained from drinking completely. However, his heroic spirit and grand sentiments did not diminish from the past. Even when his peers gathered for banquets, they were not happy without him. Even though he had quit drinking, he was still invited. When the mood struck him, he would occasionally break his abstinence, but he would never overindulge. Mr. Dong was generous in drinking and decisive in action. He dared to take on responsibilities and did not care about hard work or complaints. He helped people in need as if it were his own problem, always afraid of being late. This can be seen from his virtue in drinking. He had three younger brothers, Yuan, Xiang, and Hong. Yuan and Xiang both died one after the other, leaving only him and his youngest brother, Hong, to rely on each other. He cared for him in every way. In the autumn of the twentieth year of the Republic, Mr. Dong was preparing to bury his first wife, Madam He. He dug a hole on the land, measuring the yin and yang, and built a living tomb for himself, planning for his afterlife. His second wife, Madam Han, would also be buried there in the future. How enlightened! He had the legacy of Zhao Qi and Sikong Tu! After the construction was completed, he asked Shukuai to write an epitaph. Therefore, I have written the above outline and inscribed it on the fine stone of his good city.</p>
<h3>A Visiting Reporter's Account of the Star Film Company's Return Trip</h3>
<p>— Weibin</p>
<p>The Star Film Company, in order to shoot location scenes for the film "A Fate in Tears and Laughter," went to Beijing in mid-September. Director Zhang Shichuan led the main cast and crew of more than thirty people to film the real scenery on location. After two months, they finally returned to Shanghai yesterday. I have recorded my interviews below.</p>
<p>Since the capital was moved south, Beijing has undergone a great change. The luxury of the past no longer exists. The standard of living for ordinary people is also lower than in Shanghai. For example, hiring a car, even with the high gold prices, costs only one dollar and twenty cents per hour. From this, other things can be inferred.</p>
<p>The climate in Beijing is dry and dusty. When we first arrived, we felt the dryness was too much, and our skin cracked. The actresses felt the pain even more. However, after a week, we got used to it.</p>
<p>Beijing is most suitable for filming because of the rare rainfall and clear sunshine. There is very little haze or dullness, especially for filming color films. In addition, the ruins of the Forbidden City are solemn and magnificent, and the Western Hills and Cuiwei Mountains have undulating peaks and beautiful scenery. The majestic beauty is something not found in the South. It is very suitable as a film background.</p>
<p>After work each day, the actors went out to buy souvenirs for their relatives and friends. Besides food, the main purchases were antiques and furs. Some people bought two or three pieces of fur, as they were good and inexpensive. Someone bought many Orders of the Striped Tiger, saying that each cost one or two yuan. These once glorious awards are now toys, which is a small example of historical vicissitudes. The actresses bought a large number of jade rings, bracelets, and other ornaments, and they were all overjoyed.</p>
<p>One evening, the Guanglu Theater was showing the Star Film Company's second sound film, "Such is Paradise." Since it was early before the show, Hu Die, along with Xia Peizhen and Gong Jianong, went to the theater for sightseeing. As soon as they sat down, the audience noticed them. All eyes were on them, as if they were enjoying a feast of beauty that they could never get enough of. This shows how deeply the people of the old capital were fascinated by the stars.</p>
<p>On the return trip, we took the express train on the tenth day. We passed through Tianjin, where the Japanese invaders were raging and rumors were spreading, causing panic. The driver stepped on the accelerator without hesitation. Fearing that the Japanese soldiers would see the lights, he turned off all the lights in the car. Only after passing Yangliuqing did the lights come back on, and people's hearts were slightly relieved.</p>
<h3>Interactions between High Officials</h3>
<p>— Xu Bibo</p>
<p>On the 13th, this column published my notice for the recovery of a felt hat. The next day, I published an article in the Kuaihuo Forest after "Farewell to the Ascending Hat." Then, Mr. Qiu Zijia asked his friend to bring my hat to the address. We were both able to get back our own hats. I wrote, "I should return the hat to Meng Jia, who dropped his hat." Now, the name of the person who exchanged hats happens to have the character "Jia." The strange coincidences of the world are truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>When the hats were exchanged, Zhao Jun was by my side. I smiled and said to him, "Huan Wu (returning to me) is truly an interaction between high officials." But "crown and cover" should be interpreted literally. I dare not pretend that it is a pronoun. We then laughed together.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu's friend happened to be seated next to the advertising department. He saw someone writing an advertisement for the eight-part film "The Female Knight Errant of the荒江." He asked, "Is this the drama starring the heroic and elegant Ms. Xu Qinfang the other night?" I said yes. I then gave him two complimentary tickets, and he thanked me very respectfully and said goodbye happily. I sent him to the elevator door and entered the room. I got the two lines, "Officials interact, this person is not haggard," and wrote it to show Yi. I think she should also smile. (Contributing to disaster relief)</p>
<h3>Records of What I Saw and Heard in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Mule Carts</p>
<p>The "Miscellaneous Records of Zhuyeting" states: "Mule carts in the capital are increasingly becoming more luxurious. Even the cart stands and runners that buy and sell carts have silk and satin curtains and glass windows." (Carts made in the city for hire are called 'buying and selling carts'. Those that are placed at the mouth of the alleys and only set off when a price is agreed upon are called 'cart stands'. Those that run around east and west without a fixed location are called 'runners'.) Si Nong of E Yuezhai said: "In the early Qianlong period, there were only donkey carts. When Zhongcheng of Xian De first worked in the department, there were only donkey carts. Only Liu Wenzheng had a white horse carriage. When people saw the white horse carriage, they knew that Lord Liu had arrived. Mule carts only appeared after the opening of the Sichuan Transport." At that time, mule carts were called "Sichuan Transport Carts." I happened to read a poem presented to Yao Daochong on his return home by Zhengjun Liu Haifeng of my hometown. There is a line that says, "Mule carts run through the alleys every day." Daochong was the great-great-uncle of my uncle Gaozu, named Kongxin. He was recommended as a talented person in the year of Wuchen in Yongzheng's reign and came to Beijing. So, mule carts existed in the Yongzheng period. Jin Chunfu Ke Xie of Daxing said: "After the thirtieth year of Qianlong, horse-drawn carriages gradually increased in the capital, and mule carts were still rare. This is because they may have existed before, but they only became popular after the Sichuan Transport became prosperous." The side door of the carriage was first created by Ji Wenda. The side door of the carriage interfered with the axle, so the wheels were moved back, and the rear baffle was created. According to this, horse-drawn carriages came before mule carts.</p>
<p>After the thirtieth year of Guangxu, European-style carriages for hire began to appear in the capital. Before this, southerners who came to the capital all suffered from riding mule carts. The riders had to sit cross-legged. The hard wheels hit the stones, and the carts shook from side to side, causing bumps on the forehead. Also, they moved very slowly. The alleys outside Zhengyangmen were narrow, and the carts lined up one after another and could not compete to go first. If there was an obstruction, it would take a long time. This was called "crossing carts." Generally, when visiting guests in the morning, one would not be able to return until evening. Therefore, the inner and outer cities were very separated at that time. Manchus who lived in the inner city had not even been to the outer city for half their lives. Those who lived in the east city had not been to the west city for years. Those who were familiar with the local language of the old capital often said that the pronunciations of the east, west, north, and south cities were different. This was all because of this. Only the rear baffle carts were slightly more comfortable, but only high officials dared to ride them.</p>

<h3>The Country Bumpkin Goes to Shanghai Again (20)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>He was no longer willing to be a peacemaker at this moment. He still wanted to take a car to Meilan Lane to find his nephew, A Mulin. He ran towards the east, but he saw several girls dressed in gaudy clothes standing there. The powder on their faces was whiter than the walls; the rouge was redder than the Red House; their lips were like the Ghost King in the Hungry Ghost Festival, with a bloody gaping mouth; their hair was like the yaksha ghosts in the oily mountains, with disheveled hair. The tall ones looked like bamboo poles; the short ones looked like Shaoxing vats; the fat ones looked like inflated sugar figures; the thin ones looked like fried monkeys. They were all crowded together, making a lot of noise.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin noticed a wad of paper next to a girl's trouser leg, catching fire and about to burn her trouser leg. He thought, "Putting out the fire is the most important thing. Now that girl's buttocks are on fire, she is still calm, which is quite a feat. I must pull her away." So, he ran up in three steps, pushed and rubbed the girl, and stomped on the fire with both feet, shouting:</p>
<p>"Fire! Fire! Fire!"</p>
<p>The girl was also scared out of her wits.</p>
<p>"Oh my! I'm going to die! What are you doing!" the girl shouted in an anxious Jiangbei accent.</p>
<p>"The fire is burning your legs, don't you feel the heat?"</p>
<p>The country bumpkin spoke sternly, but the girl thought the country bumpkin was interrupting her, so she cursed:</p>
<p>"You old son of a bitch! Who told you to mind other people's business? We were burning the road head, but you stomped it out. Aren't you touching our bad luck? If we don't get any customers today, it will be your fault. You old son of a bitch, I won't let you pass!"</p>
<p>As she spoke, the girl grabbed the country bumpkin fiercely. The country bumpkin was baffled.</p>
<p>"I meant well! Isn't the fire burning your legs? You're not wearing socks, the fire will attack your heart."</p>
<p>"Who said I'm not wearing socks? You're just talking nonsense." The girl raised her legs for the country bumpkin to see.</p>
<p>It turned out that the country bumpkin didn't see clearly. Recently, it has been fashionable for Shanghai girls to wear flesh-colored silk stockings. Since they are flesh-colored, of course, they are the same color as the skin. The country bumpkin's eyes were not so good, and he thought that people wearing flesh-colored silk stockings were not wearing socks. He even thought that the girls wearing long silk stockings were not wearing pants. Now that the girl raised her legs, he finally saw that she was wearing a pair of socks the same color as the skin.</p>

<h3>The Gold Price Soars to an Extreme</h3>
<p>Due to the Sharp Drop in Silver Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 17th, the gold price surge intensified, becoming shockingly prominent. However, the market was quite large, with rapid advances and retreats, chaotic and erratic, and unpredictable. From morning to night, there was a fluctuation of 21 taels. In the end, it surged upwards, more than 26 taels. Counterparts were uniformly higher, but the demand differed, perhaps due to the unexpected sharp drop in the silver market. When the gold price opened, it had already soared, leaping above 640 taels. Subsequently, although the foreign exchange rate was reduced by 6 points, the domestic market was not overly tight. Furthermore, the Guangdong group released a large amount, so it retreated within 40 taels. Later, major players such as Mr. Wu and others worked hard to cover their short positions, especially as the drafts became increasingly tight. As a result, the market suddenly surged, soaring by more than 10 taels and exceeding the 50-tael mark. In the after-market, foreign firms continued to take short positions, becoming even more aggressive. Unexpectedly, the Guangdong group and major players sold off their long positions, turning downward and presenting a rebound. It fell sharply by more than 10 taels, with considerable fluctuations, drifting and fluctuating, revolving around 50 taels. The exchange rate declined from the gains. Afterwards, it was between 44 and 45 taels. It is said that there may be a slight upward reversal in the major trades this morning.</p>
<p>Opening with a Jump of 23 Taels. Opening early in the morning, it rose 23 taels and 2 qian, to 641 taels. The major exchanges plunged: 3 pence 15625, forward delivery 3 pence 4375. The silver price fell 2 fen 875. There were subsequent fluctuations of more than 2 taels, from 41 and a half taels to 39 taels. Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Tongtaichang and others were eager to rush in, and immediately soared 10 taels to 48 taels and 7 qian. Shortly, Hengxing, Yifeng, Yifengyong, and others sold out, and the initial price of British gold was 19.75, then 19.875 was available for settlement, and it fell 10 taels. There were only 2-3 taels of progress. The British gold opening price was 38 and a half taels, and the listed price was reduced by 1 and a half pence, and the US dollar fell by 2 yuan, only increasing to 40 taels. This was because the sellers did not stop, and the British gold bank traded with each other at 10 pence 0625, and then immediately fell to 36 and a half taels. After 9:30, it gradually rose, and Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yu Dayuan, Kangxiang, Yuan Maoyong, Hengchangyong, Wu, and retail short sellers were eager to buy aggressively. Especially because various firms were scrambling to close out their drafts, the price suddenly tightened, and the British gold only settled at 19.6875 and the US dollar at 34 yuan 125, while the market atmosphere was extremely sharp, rising section by section, actually soaring by as much as 13-14 taels, reaching 50 taels and 5 qian at 10:45. At that time, the Guangdong group continued to sell, slightly losing 4 taels, to 46 taels and 5 qian. After 11:00, the buying trend became even more intense, with Qianchangxiang, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Yufu Chang, and speculators unanimously competing to buy. It almost rose 10 taels, but the British gold only settled at 19.375, and the US dollar at 33 yuan 75 was still difficult to buy. At 11:45, it reached 55 taels and 5 qian. In a moment, the Dalian group sold off, falling to 52 taels. At the close, it was again 54 taels and 2 qian. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate was down 2 robies 04, and the HSBC British gold changed to a reduction of 25 and the US dollar 5 jiao, so it had risen to 56-57 taels, with the opening price at 716 taels, with a suppression of 80 to 60 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market is Very Wavy. The afternoon market initially fell to 51 taels, due to Shunli and Wanxing selling out. In a moment, it soared upwards, rising wildly by 6-7 taels, because of the foreign firm Joe and John covering their short positions. At 2:15, it reached 57 taels and 8 qian. Then, Hengxing, Chengfengyong, Wu, Fuchang, and others sold out, and the exchange market weakened. The US dollar was sold by Zhengjin from 33 and a half yuan to 875. Sumitomo released British gold at 19375, then later at 4375. Therefore, the gold price plummeted, and at 3:00 it was 44 taels and 5 qian. Suddenly, Tong Taichang and others entered, and with a report of a small 1 robie in the Indian exchange rate, it rose by more than 7 taels, reaching 52 taels at 3:20. However, people's hearts were unsettled, and the sellers exceeded the buyers. Most of the long positions with profits had already sold off, so the price could not last long. After 3:30, it fell to 43 taels. Zhengjin also released British gold at 5625, while the US dollar was at 34 yuan 25. There were slight fluctuations after entry. After 3:45, it rose again by 5-6 taels, with Hengyu and others buying in. At 4:00, it was 49 taels. Unfortunately, Zhifengyong, Shunliwanxing, Fuchang and others swarmed out, and the situation was not optimistic, and the silver was particularly tight. By the time of the 4:30 close, it was only 43 taels and 7 qian, a sharp increase of 25 taels and 9 qian from the previous night. It was again traded to 45 taels. According to the entire day, the highest was 57 taels and 8 qian, and the lowest was 36 taels and a half, a difference of 21 taels and 3 qian.

<h3>Exchange Market Very Bullish</h3>
<p>Listed Prices Contracted by Seven Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets plummeted, while exchange rates rose. The HSBC exchange rate contracted twice, totaling seven points. Initially, British gold contracted by one and a half pence in the morning, reaching one shilling nine and a quarter pence. U.S. dollars contracted by two yuan, reaching thirty-three and a half yuan. Hong Kong dollars suddenly increased by 0.4375, reaching seventy-six taels and 9.375 mace, due to maintaining the local currency standard. The remaining currencies all contracted uniformly. After 12:00, the rate suddenly contracted again by 0.25, reaching one shilling and nine pence for British gold, and half a yuan for U.S. dollars, reaching thirty-three yuan. The Hong Kong rate remained unchanged, but the remaining rates also contracted. This was likely due to fluctuations in the domestic market, which were chaotic and unstable. The market was strong from the morning, then declined, tightened at noon, and turned from rising to weakening in the afternoon, ultimately remaining expensive. Compared to the day before, British gold contracted by 1.3125 pence, and U.S. dollars contracted by 1.625 yuan. Consequently, the gold market soared, once exceeding 650 taels, but the market conditions were chaotic, with fluctuations exceeding 20 taels. Short sellers were greatly stimulated and reluctantly covered their positions, while long positions were released. As a result, the market declined, and it is expected that British silver may rebound today. Chinese merchant gold firms extensively covered short positions, with approximately 200,000 to 300,000 pounds of British gold and over one million U.S. dollars traded. However, there were sellers, with Chinese and Japanese banks reportedly selling.</p>
<p>British exchange in the domestic market had a review of 8.125, with the loosest rate being one shilling, six pence and 0.0625, and the tightest rate being nine and a quarter pence.

Later, it was changed to 3 taels, 0 mace, 3 fen and 0.3 hao.</p>
<h3>Drastic Reactionary Decline in Silver</h3>
<p>Both Near and Far Term Prices Fell by More Than Three Pence, with America Eager to Sell and Few Buyers</p>
<p>According to a London telegram yesterday, the reactionary movement in silver was drastic, marking a review of the new era that has repeatedly appeared in recent days. The near term price plummeted by 3.5625 pence, reaching 18 pence, while the far term price also contracted by 3.4375 pence, reaching 17.9375 pence. The spot market fell due to America eagerly selling off and India also reselling, with few buyers. The market turned firm after closing. There were few American buyers. Transaction prices all exceeded the listed price by 1.75 pence. Furthermore, according to a New York telegram, the price of American silver also plummeted by 2.875 cents, with the spot price being 32.625 cents. The exchange rate of British pounds against U.S. dollars increased by 0.5 cents, reaching 3.77625 dollars.

<h3>Tightening of Credit Follows the Situation</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, due to the tense situation in the North, financial panic has ensued, with unexpected changes occurring. Credit has been tight for days, increasing compared to the previous month. However, the tightening last month was due to uneven market adjustments, so it subsided quickly. Now, due to the impact of the situation, commercial categories everywhere are greatly affected, and the difficulty of financial adjustment is even more pronounced. Therefore, it is anticipated that seeking a quick and peaceful resolution in the current situation is unlikely to be possible in reality.</p>
<p>Interest Rates: The morning "foreign interest" rate was 7 mace, 2 fen, 5 li and 2.5 hao. The afternoon rate was slightly smaller by 0.25 hao, at 7 mace, 2 fen and 5 li. As credit was tight, the interest market was too busy to pay attention, leading to quietness. The "silver discount" rate was 4 mace and 5 fen in the morning, and suddenly soared to 5 mace in the afternoon, reaching this year's second highest price, and people were panic-stricken, making it difficult to calm down for a while. The bank's listed rate was 1 mace and 8 fen, and the mark-up rate reached 5 mace, closing at 4 mace and 5.6 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Early market prices for the Jiangnan small silver coins were 6 mace, 5 fen and 2 li. The afternoon price was the same. The morning trading volume was 5,000 jiao, and the afternoon trading volume was 3,000 jiao. Early market prices for the Guangdong small silver coins were 6 mace, 5 fen and 1.5 li. In the afternoon, because supply and demand were comparable, the price did not fluctuate much. The morning trading volume was 190,000 jiao, and the afternoon trading volume was 75,000 jiao. Copper coins increased by 500 wen, reaching 380,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" Yesterday's news from the bank on the collection of funds showed that Chinese merchants collected over 2.5 million in banknotes, foreign merchants collected over 1.7 million to 1.8 million in banknotes, and various types of goods, exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds collected over 7 million, with 800,000 entering the warehouse. Due to the urgency of funds in the money shops and silver public associations, collections were delayed, making reconciliation difficult, and there was no accurate quantity. The general estimate was approximately 47 million to 48 million. Over 3 million in mark-up funds were collected, and over 900,000 in remittances from various routes were collected, with 600,000 to 700,000 in remittances paid out. "Foreign Funds" Exchange remittances and banknotes made out in the morning totaled 1,575,000, and those made out in the afternoon totaled 1,175,000. Paper money was 75,000 in the morning and 30,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange paper money was 115,000 in the morning and 55,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions were 750,000 in the morning inter-market and 600,000 in the afternoon inter-market. Over 4.5 million in receipts and payments between foreign accounts of various banks, over 1.4 million in foreign mark-up funds collected, and over 1.3 million in foreign funds lent and borrowed. Small money shops traded over 500,000.</p>
<h3>Security Bond Prices Slightly Increased Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds showed that although various spot prices were offered, transactions remained scarce, and the futures market remained sluggish. The sentiment of both buyers and sellers in the market remained calm. Various bonds continued to have few large transactions, and the trend was generally peaceful. As the League of Nations had just opened its meeting yesterday and there were no major developments yet, the future remained gloomy. The general public remained in a wait-and-see attitude, and major players remained as calm as before. Both supply and demand remained balanced. However, market sentiment seemed slightly better than the previous day. In the Northeast, the Black Army fought hard, and the situation had not changed much. The domestic situation was good, and retail investment in the market was stronger than selling, so prices rose slightly. Except for the 19 Good Next Month futures, which rose by 9 jiao, others only improved by about half a yuan. Only the Dismissal Next Month futures and the 20 Customs Current Month futures continued to decline slightly. 19 Customs 20 Bonds spot goods had almost no transactions, and all fell significantly compared to the beginning of last week. Observing the future of the bond market, it will still depend on the evolution of the external situation. The total daily spot transactions were only 7,000 yuan, and the futures transactions were 4,610,000 in the morning and 2,265,000 yuan in the afternoon, totaling 6,875,000 yuan. Among them, the 20 Customs Unified Tax accounted for over 1 million yuan each.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Trend Mediocre</h3>
<p>The yarn market was firm in the morning and declined in the afternoon, with a very soft trend. Due to the difficult times and financial urgency, most speculators viewed the general trend as unfavorable and tended to sell off. As soon as the market rose slightly, sellers increased. Short sellers generally looked to 50 taels. However, the inventory of each factory was thin.</p>
<p>The Renbiao was vigorous in the morning and weak in the afternoon. The opening price of the Renbiao forward market saw a surge in the gold price, with retail investors scrambling to cover short positions, causing the market to rise sharply. All months rose by 1 qian to 8-9 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was weak, and all months fell by 4-5-7 qian to 1 liang. The total trading volume for the day was 25,200 bales. It was found that Taixing sold 3,100 bales, Changfeng 1,350 bales, Ruidai 600 bales, and Houfeng 850 bales. Gongtai bought 950 bales, Gengfeng 1,650 bales, and Yiyu 1,150 bales.

The market trend was declining. Customer gangs from the interior purchased 390 bales, Nanjing purchased 15 bales, and miscellaneous gangs purchased 70 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Slight Bullish Signs</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly firm. The surge in gold prices and the large contraction in silver prices led to firming sentiment. Long positions increased, and the market conditions brought gains. However, actual demand became even quieter. Factories made no inquiries at all. The trend for this month was reversed to loosen, due to deliveries. However, the long positions were unwilling to loosen due to the small prices. Overseas prices continue to trend downwards.</p>
<p>The Hanbiao long positions increased. The Hanbiao opened earlier and rose sharply by 2 qian following the surge in gold prices. The market conditions softened slightly in the afternoon, with all months falling by 0.5 fen to 1 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 84,800 dan.

<h3>The Grain and River Rice Market Turned Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Nantou Yesterday, 23 boats from the West Road arrived at Tou Nian. The Houxin Japonica market was temporarily mediocre. Early and late rice arrivals accumulated somewhat. Ning Wei and the local city were sluggish and not smooth, and prices rose slightly by several fen due to the scarcity of goods. The supply of old broken rice was not connected, and the market did not rise or fall. Du Yangjian arrived and sold two flats, and the price did not fluctuate. Bian Yin Yuan arrived and sold vigorously and was stagnant, and the price was low by 2-3 jiao.</p>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday, 20 to 30 boats arrived. Sales in the local city were sluggish. Changkun's new Japonica rice had the most hulls, and the market did not rise or fall. The opening of white Japonica rice such as Wuxi and Danyang was extremely dull, with a slight decrease of 1 jiao. The small movement of thin rice for store stomachs by guest gangs in Chonggu and Shishi made the opening slightly stronger. According to inland telegrams, the trend of foreign Yangjian was stable, and the local transaction was limited, and the overall market could not fall too much. Glutinous rice was tight at the top and fatigued secondarily.</p>
<h3>Hankou Gang Purchased and Packed Current Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Wenzhou rice has a new arrival in port. Inland gangs purchase forward rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions showed that spot goods and guest chemical activities were active. The Hankou Gang packed small twisted goods and other spot goods in the market, and the appetite of the local street stomach was also active, and the price rose by nearly 1 jiao, with more than 3,000 bags of small twisted goods being offered, priced at 10 yuan and 3 jiao to 10 yuan and 2 jiao, followed by 10 yuan. 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 were priced at 11 and a half yuan, and 200 bags of Mindang were priced at 10 yuan and 7 jiao and 7 fen. After the sudden rise in gold prices, the forward foreign rice price rose in aggregate, and the foreign firms' dumping opinions were lax, and the price was also called high, while the inland gangs had an appetite, and the market also showed improvement. The unified market opened a new transaction of 500 tons of small twisted goods in January, priced at 4 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, and 500 tons of small twisted goods for the return cargo in May, priced at 5 taels and 1 qian. Another 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon for November and December was priced at 5 taels, 3 qian and 3 fen, all of which were about 1 qian higher than the previous day. A new batch of Wenzhou white rice arrived, with 1,000 bags being handled by the local street, priced at 10 yuan and 5 jiao to 10 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>The Label Flour Rose in the Morning and Returned in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed an attitude of frenzy in each month's market since it opened in the morning. The foreign wheat rose by 7-8 jiao. The gold market also soared 30 to 40 taels due to the drastic contraction of the big bar. Generally speaking, speculators and part of the Tianjin Gang were very interested in the turning point of the opportunity. The market price rose when the market opened and continued to be bullish later. The number of transactions reached 800,000 to 900,000, which was 3-4 fen higher than the closing price of the previous day. The situation at that time was agitated and explosive. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was unstable again. The foreign wheat telegram of the continued setting was turned over, and the price was only 3 taels and 8 qian and 2 fen. Rumors also spread about the exchange of 500,000 bags of relief wheat for flour, which caused a big impact on the market. As a result, this month was only good for 7.5 li, December was good for 5 li, January was good for 2.5 li, February and March were good for 5 li, and April was good for 1.25 fen.</p>
<h3>The Afternoon Rise of Forward Wheat Was Frustrated</h3>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market showed a consistent surge in each month's market since it opened in the morning. The foreign wheat quotation rebounded by about 7-8 jiao. Furthermore, the environmental situation changed, and people's hearts were naturally agitated. This month's opening price was 3 taels and 7 qian and 3 fen, which was 1 qian and 1 fen higher than the previous day. Each month was also raised 1 qian, and the severity of the situation could be imagined. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still stable at first. However, after the second round, it fell back again. It was rumored that two more ships of Australian foreign wheat at 3 taels, 8 qian and 3 fen had been finalized, and rumors of a large batch of relief wheat being sold to factories (3 taels, 7 qian and 5 fen) and the exchange of flour made people very false, and it fell back by 5-6 fen. The rise and fall are now just right, and it should be transferred to the environment. As a result, this month was still 2 fen better than the previous day, December was 6 fen better, January was 5.1 fen better, February rose 6 fen, March rose 4 fen, and April rose 5 fen.</p>
<h3>The Delineated Pan Sugar Market Unanimously Soared</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams, the current price of Cuban raw sugar was still 1.375, the price of New York forward sugar in December was 1.27, and the price in March next year was 1.25, which was 2 fen lower than the previous telegrams. The price in May was 1.29, which was also 1 fen lower, and the price in September was still 1.39, with no rise or fall. The current and forward sugar prices in Java remained unchanged. The delineated pan of the Association market was high due to the steep rise in foreign exchange and the sharp rise in customs duties. As a result, the popularity suddenly turned for the better, the needs were also active, and the exports were becoming tighter. He sugar No. 24 crude sugar was initially priced at 10 taels and 2 qian, but it was rarely accepted. The result was that the later market fell back to 9 taels and 9 qian, and medium-grade white sugar also called for price increases, but transactions were very quiet, and the market was calm. The trade in Taikoo sugar was particularly prosperous. B brand was priced from 11 taels and 5 qian to 5 and a half qian, DY brand was priced from 11 taels, 4 qian and 2 and a half fen to 4 and a half qian, HX brand was priced at 11 taels and 3 and a half qian, and the number of HM brands priced at 11 taels was not many, and the market was quite high. Then Huaxin sold B brand at 11 taels and 5 and a half qian, and CW brand at 11 taels and 4 and a half qian, so the market was flat and not surprising.</p>
<h3>The Market Price of Walnut Kernels in Zhabei Turned Loose</h3>
<p>The distribution of walnuts in Hanzhuang used to drive the price of land up in the Shen market one after another. Now it has gradually become moderate, and the price has also become loose. Currently, the top-handed selected peach market is selling 24-25 taels, the medium-grade market is selling 19 and a half to 19 taels, the second-grade market is selling 16-17 taels, and the walnut meat market is selling 47-48 taels to 42-43 taels, which is all lower than before. Walnuts are estimated to be less than 2 liang, and walnut meat is less than 1-2 liang. The market for various gangs is flat, and the market trend is temporarily set.</p>
<h3>The Silk Sales of Silk and Tea Foreign Firms Nearly Stalled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of foreign silk firms in this port nearly stalled. Although there were telegrams transferred from British and French factories, the price of 13-15 strips was only 870-880 taels (B grade). The price of the telegram transferred from New York was still difficult to rise. The manufacturers had difficulty selling the capital, the market atmosphere was stagnant, and only Xiangli and others imported 11 packages of yellow rough silk, and the price was still flat and tired.</p>
<h3>The British Sales of Luzhuang Zhenmei Moved Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market of foreign firms in this port, Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi, Shexian and other roads, was started by British firms such as Xiehe Jinjiang, but due to the high exchange rate, sales were not strong, and the tea price plummeted by 20-30 taels, surging the top and middle-grade goods, and the market was still sluggish. The market is still sluggish and the market still has a tendency to continue to fall. As for the planned pearl tea, Yihua, Tongfu, Baochang and Tianxiang all had stomachs to import, and the transaction was not lonely. The market was also relatively firm.</p>
<h3>The Sales of Broadcloth and Long-Haired Camel Down Were Smooth and Rising</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been no special rise or fall in the broadcloth market. Retail and wholesale transactions are still prosperous. The price of goods is still weaker than last month. Only shoe felt is firm, and the material of the coat is mostly used for this velvet. Therefore, the western-style clothing gang in this street is purchasing in groups, which has made the market smooth and the market suddenly good. Yesterday, the market sold Huahua for 4 taels and 8 and a half qian net disc. The Taihe goods used to sell for 4 taels, 9 qian and 7 and a half fen, but now they are uniformly sold up to 5 taels and 1 qian and 2 and a half fen.</p>

<h3>General Overview of the 1932 British Standard New Car</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>There are four models of the 1932 Standard new car: the Standard Twenty, the Sixteen, the Big Nine, and the truly admirable Little Nine. Their construction ensures safety and comfort, and their performance is outstanding. Furthermore, their prices and running costs are low, making them perfectly suited to modern economic conditions. They are the most generally needed and trusted vehicles in the automotive world. The reason Standard new cars have reached such a state of excellence is that the manufacturer has drawn on its twenty-eight years of experience in crafting automobiles, and has spent tens of millions of pounds on research and improvement. The most meticulous design experts and renowned engineering technicians have devoted their full attention and strived for perfection in creating them. These new cars possess numerous features; the most prominent are outlined below.</p>
<p>1.  Priced Like a Small Car, Comfortable Like a Large Car: Standard new cars possess characteristics not found in ordinary small cars, but only in expensive large cars. These include a rear-mounted, safe gasoline tank, semi-elliptical spring suspension, front and rear shock absorbers, large wire wheels, and protective glass screens. Despite these superior features, the selling price is surprisingly low. This truly is a new product that fully meets public needs.</p>
<p>2.  Exceptionally Low Running Costs: Regarding design and construction, Standard new cars pay full attention to running costs, conducting thorough research to make them extremely economical. In terms of gasoline consumption, the level of savings is unmatched by any other vehicle with similar comfort and performance.</p>
<p>3.  Simple and Easy Driving Management: The convenience and comfort for car owners who drive themselves have been thoroughly considered and pursued with all efforts in the Standard new cars. This is one of the main reasons why Standard new cars are the most ideal vehicles for women to drive. The management mechanisms and sufficiently powered starters are all simple, efficient, and easy to use. Once driven, one can enjoy the supreme pleasure of riding in a car.</p>
<p>The Standard new car body is exceptionally strong, sturdy, spacious, and comfortable. No matter how rough the road, there is no worry of bumps, shakes, or creaks. The use of superior materials and beautiful paint need not be mentioned. Other features, such as the four-speed gearbox, the new style radiator cap, and the sliding roof, will fully satisfy buyers. The sliding roof is particularly commendable, as it can be used as a sophisticated, comfortable, and well-protected sedan to avoid wind, cold, rain, and snow, or as an open-top vehicle to allow air and sunlight to circulate. Furthermore, the mechanism for opening and closing the roof is extremely simple and ingenious, and it can be opened or closed at will, even while driving. The China Motor Company at 702 Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai has been the exclusive agent in China for the British Standard Motor Company for many years. According to the company, the first batch of Standard new cars is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>This Year's Car Sales Volume</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>Above 2,000,000 Vehicles</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the automobile industry is greatly related to economic shifts. The United States is renowned worldwide for its car manufacturing. The annual car production accounts for the largest portion globally, dominating the global car manufacturing industry. However, this year, due to the massive global economic panic, plummeting gold prices, and widespread unemployment, the impact on the car manufacturing industry has been significant and profound. Therefore, the impact of the economic downturn on the American automobile manufacturing industry in 1931 is particularly noteworthy. Besides the United States, countries such as England, France, and Italy in Europe, have automobile manufacturing industries that also hold important positions in the industrial sector. Among these, England is particularly prominent. Judging from the performance of these three countries' automobile manufacturing industries this year, there has been no significant development. Therefore, in terms of the worldwide automobile manufacturing industry, the record for 1931 is hardly impressive.</p>
<p>According to news from Detroit, the total sales of American motorcycles in 1931 will exceed 2,000,000 units. However, one thing is unprecedented: the number of passenger car purchases will fall below this number. This result is currently being predicted by commercial statistics expert Brooke Corporation. Their initial estimate was that the number of passenger car registrations this year would be 1,875,000 units. By mid-year, the estimate was that the number of passenger cars would reach 2,036,000 units.</p>
<p>Apart from passenger cars, the next category to mention is commercial trucks. The annual sales volume of these vehicles generally does not fluctuate significantly. Therefore, the sales of commercial trucks in 1931 have not seen any significant decline. According to current forecasts, the sales of commercial vehicles in 1931 will be between 320,000 and 330,000 units. According to Brooke Corporation's estimate, the sales of commercial vehicles this year (1931) have indeed fallen somewhat compared to previous years. Compared to 1930 (last year), the difference is 22.31 percent. As for the percentage decline in passenger cars, comparing 1931 with 1930, it is 27.67 percent. The current estimated sales of all types of vehicles in 1931 are between 2,195,000 and 2,200,000 units, which is generally lower than last year.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of the sales figures for various types of vehicles reveals unexpected and interesting information that can be used for reference. The sales volume of luxury and high-priced models this year is far less than in previous years. Compared to 1930, the sales volume of high-priced cars has dropped by approximately 30 percent. The drop in luxury car sales compared to last year is 32 percent. However, the percentage decline in mid-priced cars is much smaller than that of high-priced and luxury cars, with a difference of only 19 percent.</p>
<p>The sales figures for various types of vehicles in 1931 have been mentioned above. Readers should now have a general impression of the growth and decline of automobile sales in the past two years. Now, let's briefly discuss the inventions and reforms in engine technology. Improvements in automobile engines are constantly evolving. This year, the automobile manufacturing industry has made another new contribution that has already been introduced. This new engine has tremendous power, with 245 horsepower and twelve cylinders. However, this type of engine is not used for passenger car installations, as ordinary passenger cars only require stability, so there is no need for such great power. It is said that this engine is best suited for use in fire engines, carrying heavy loads while still being extremely fast, with a speed of approximately 60 miles per hour. Its acceleration rate is similar to that of ordinary private cars, making it truly innovative and convenient. The American-French company has also made new developments in cylinder reform. The double-cylinder engine currently in planning has an installation angle of 30 degrees, and the design is particularly unique.</p>
<p>Recently, due to declining production, various automobile manufacturers have been collectively seeking ways to reduce expenditures. This is undeniable. However, the authorities intend to avoid layoffs as much as possible. This matter has been widely circulated in Detroit, and there is evidence to support it. The number of workers manufacturing Chevrolet cars remains at 30,000, almost the same as when work began this year. However, the factory's car production volume at that time was almost double what it is now. The Buick factory temporarily suspended operations in mid-September for inventory taking but has now resumed work. There have also been several significant innovations in the manufacturing of the Vauxhall car. In addition to the freewheeling device that has already been announced, rubber cushions are used in the engine to reduce noise during operation. Improvements in body style and comfort have also been taken into account.</p>
<h3>The Citroën in Promotion</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Talks by Manufacturer's Representative, Mr. Helbo</p>
<p>Mr. Helbo, a close friend of Mr. Citroën, the owner of the French Citroën automobile manufacturing plant, is a capable assistant in Citroën's business operations. Mr. Helbo has traveled around the world repeatedly on behalf of the factory to promote its business. Recently, Mr. Helbo arrived in Shanghai again. According to him, this trip is even more significant because he is determined to expand the scope of Citroën automobiles' activities in the Far East. It is reported that Mr. Helbo has already begun implementing his grand promotional plan.</p>
<p>Since collaborating with his close friend, Mr. Helbo has traveled around the world ten times. Upon arriving in Shanghai this time, he listed facts to prove the importance of Shanghai in the Chinese automobile market. Mr. Helbo briefly stated that the number of imported cars in Shanghai accounts for two-fifths of the total number of imported cars in the country. In 1928, 4,103 cars were imported, of which 1,661 were sold in Shanghai. In 1929, the total number of imports was 8,879, with Shanghai accounting for 3,777. In 1930, the total number of imports was 4,448, with Shanghai accounting for 1,866. To date, approximately 100,000 Citroën cars have been sold in the Far East. The most famous car factory in France is now planning to exert all its efforts to compete with British and American manufacturers in hopes of gaining victory in the Chinese market. Due to France's advantageous economic position, it has not been as severely affected by the global recession as Britain and the United States. Although its business operations have also suffered some losses, everyone has their profession, and merchants have very real confidence in the future. Taking the automobile industry as an example, 1931 was even better than 1930. It is estimated that by the end of 1932, the number of various types of cars in France will reach 2 million, which can be seen from the annual increase in sales of 15 percent. The number of cars in 1930 was 1,520,501, ranking only behind Britain and the United States in terms of the number of cars in the world. The total output that year was 255,111 units, with 31,158 units being sold abroad, while only 781 cars from other countries were sold in France. Observing the trend, this import volume will only decrease. The reason why foreign goods cannot be sold well in France is that French cars are not only low in price, but French car manufacturers are also constantly striving for improvement. In 1930, there was one passenger car for every 27 residents in France and one truck for every 100 people. The annual car production was 750 units per day, and exports ranked eighth, with a value of 13,354,850,000 francs. Mr. Helbo also stated that Citroën, recently speaking in Paris, believes that the time is ripe to make efforts in China. Currently, Citroën automobiles are only available in four-cylinder and six-cylinder models, but they are all full-sized vehicles. Their engines are very economical, and their power has been greatly increased to meet the needs of the world market. Special attention has been paid to the body lines, making them extremely beautiful. In addition, Citroën also manufactures long-wheelbase two-ton trucks for use in bus services. Mr. Helbo concluded by saying that Mr. Citroën, known worldwide as the "Ford of Europe," often travels to America and is currently staying there, engaging in mutual discussions with American manufacturers and engineers on all the latest developments in the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Translated Compilation</p>
<h3>News from the Automotive World</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>Traveling at 300 Miles Per Hour: The world record for automobile speed is currently held by British man Mr. Campbell, with a record of 245 miles per hour. However, automobile driving experts from various countries believe that automobile speeds are not limited to this. Many are rising up to break Mr. Campbell's record. Recently, a Mr. Naaman Smith has created a new type of racing car and will be driving it in the Newsland area. He hopes to be able to travel at 300 miles per hour in order to break Mr. Campbell's record. Mr. Smith's new car is quite similar in design to Mr. Campbell's, but there are also many innovations. The most notable is that the middle of the car body is very close to the ground. When starting, it flies like an arrow, capable of covering 11 miles. The driving location is on the 90-mile beach in Newsland. It is expected that this will once again cause a sensation worldwide.</p>
<p>Drivers Driving Slowly Should Be Penalized: The west-central region of the United States recently promulgated a new automobile driving law. Those who drive slowly on the road should be punished by the government. This new law is truly unprecedented. The speed specified in the law is 40 miles per hour. Those who drive at a speed less than 40 miles per hour should be penalized. Regarding the implementation of this new law, the general opinion is that it is still in the experimental stage, as the roads where this law applies are currently only a few segments.</p>
<p>Proof of the Sturdy Nash Body: In Calgary, Alberta, Canada, thieves recently stole a Nash sedan from the Paris Tourist Hotel car dealership. Afterward, the owner reported it to the police, who searched in all directions and found it. At that time, the thieves were sitting in the back seat of the Nash car. The police immediately opened fire on them, and the bullets hit the car body five times. However, according to Mr. Gambell, the Nash sales representative in Calgary, the five shots fired by the police did not penetrate the car body, demonstrating the sturdiness of the Nash body.</p>
<p>Awards for Automobile Racing Compiled: Recently, Auburn and Cord cars have repeatedly won excellent awards. The honor won in Beres, Syria, is the most significant. The participants in this race were custom-built sedan cars. As a result, Auburn won the first prize, and Cord took second place. Also, in the Powder赛 race, the Auburn 8/98 sedan car won the second prize, while the first prize was won by the Cord car. Mr. Miller recently drove a Stutz car from San Francisco to New York, breaking the previous round-trip record. The total distance from San Francisco to New York and back was 6,278 miles, and the time spent was only 132 hours and 9 minutes. Afterward, the Stutz car dealer in New York hosted a special banquet for Mr. Miller at the Commodore Hotel.</p>
<p>The Number of Gasoline Imports in the UK: The automobile industry in the UK is currently very developed, and its gasoline consumption is quite considerable. According to the latest report, the number of gasoline imports in the UK in August was 76,723,207 gallons, an increase of 6,520,986 gallons compared to the same period last year. At the same time, Britain imported a total of 31,774,442 gallons of crude oil, of which 20,633,607 gallons came from Persia, which were transported to Britain for refining and sale.</p>

<h3>The Actual Situation of the Construction of the Ningxia Highway</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Ningxia is located on the frontier, and transportation is obstructed. Since the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925), although automobile highways have been built, they have not been completely constructed due to numerous ditches and lakes. Therefore, whenever farmland is irrigated in the summer, the canal water overflows and floods the roadbed, and the roads become muddy, causing travelers to have to detour. Since the reorganization of the province in the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929), the Construction Department has hired laborers to build and repair the roads over the years. For the sake of roadbed strength, personnel were assigned to survey the routes of the major roads and plan the projects, which were carried out in stages. However, due to the frequent occurrence of incidents, the work was interrupted several times. Although it is not yet perfect, the roads are still passable. The details of the plan and construction process are described below.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the Three Major Trunk Lines: (1) The Ningxia Provincial Capital to Baotou, Suiyuan, is the Ningbao Road. The section from the provincial capital to Dengkou is 390 li long and 12 meters wide. This section is very smooth from the provincial capital through Ligangbao and Pingluo County. The section from Shizuishan, Dengkou County, to Datan, entering Suiyuan, is slightly inferior. The section from Shizuishan to Sanshenggong is mostly desert. If you want to avoid obstacles, you must cross the river and travel along the east bank, which is easier. (2) The Ningxia Provincial Capital to Gansu Provincial Capital is the Ninglan Road. The section from the provincial capital to Zhongwei is 390 li long and 12 meters wide. This road passes through Yeshengbao, Daba, Guangwu, Shikong, and other places to Zhongwei County, crosses Yingpanshui, and enters Gansu Province. The road surface is flat from the provincial capital to Daba. There are small sand dunes crisscrossing from Daba to Guangwu, but there are no obstacles. It is also flat from here directly to Zhongwei County. However, from Yingpanshui to Shapotou Yiwanquan, the sand dunes are very large and difficult to pass. Therefore, this road should cross the river from Shikong to Ning'anbao, and then enter the Shanhegou from the fort, pass through Xinbaozichuan to Jingyuan, and reach Lanzhou, which is smoother. However, the mountain water in Shanhegou is very large in the summer, which is a concern. (3) The Ningxia Provincial Capital to Pingliang, Gansu, is the Ningping Road. The section of the road in Ningxia, from the provincial capital to Liwangbao, Yuwang, is 570 li long and 12 meters wide. The situation on this road is the same as before from the provincial capital to Shikong. Cross the Yellow River, pass through Ning'anbao, Tongxincheng, to Liwangbao. Along the way, the section from Ning'anbao to Liwangbao is mostly mountainous slopes and ravines, and the terrain is uneven. It has not yet been completely constructed.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the Four Major Branch Lines: (1) The road from the provincial capital to Yanchi is the Ningyan Road, which is 310 li long. It passes through Hengcheng, Shuidonggou, Qingshuiying, Shakeng, Niumaojing, to Yanchi. This section is good from the province to Hengcheng. The section from Hengcheng to Yanchi is rugged and crisscrossed by deserts. It is currently being planned for construction. (2) The road from the provincial capital to Lingwu is the Ningling Road, which is 100 li long. This road crosses the Yellow River from Wanghongbao to Lingwu. The terrain along the way is flat, but there are numerous ditches and bridges. It is also currently under consideration for construction. (3) The road from the provincial capital to Yuwang is the Ningyu Road, which is 460 li long. It passes through Wuzhongbao, Shigoubao, Weizhou, to Yuwang. The section from the provincial capital to Wubao has already been constructed smoothly. The rest is mostly desert mountain slopes and ravines, which have not yet been constructed. (4) The road from the provincial capital to Dingyuanying is the Ningding Road, which is 120 li long. It passes through Ningxiang County and over the Helan Mountains to Dingyuanying. However, the section of more than 40 li from the provincial capital to the foot of the mountain has been repaired smoothly. The gully from the mountain pass to Dingyuanying is dangerous, and the terrain is uneven. It has not yet been constructed. The above three major trunk lines have now been constructed three times, and the road surface is still good. Those curves that are easy to change have all been straightened. In cases where there are various difficult situations, they are still constructed according to the original shape. However, although this line can be used for automobile traffic, it is mixed with the major cart road, which inevitably causes damage from time to time. When funds are sufficient in the future, the route will be surveyed according to the plan, and the automobile road will be constructed separately from the cart road, which will be more convenient for traffic. As for the above-mentioned four major branch lines, they will be directly constructed by the Construction Department in the future, or by the county governments and construction bureaus of each county, and gradually carried out. Then, Ningxia Province's transportation will not be difficult to thrive.</p>
