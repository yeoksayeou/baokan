<h3 id="c13">外侮與外交（一） <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>近來寳山案及全韓排華事件接踵發生。實爲國際間駭人聞聽之大變。同時益足徵弱國國民處於横暴者鐵蹄之下。幾於無人權無公理可言。國人怵於外侮之日亟。國步之艱難。乃倍切望於外交當局之能以不屈之精神。整齊之步驟。運用靈活之手腕。折衝樽俎。挫彼强横洒我恥辱。希望愈切。責備自亦較嚴。故最近對於外交當局。時作微辭之投。此種現象。要皆國人激於愛國至誠。向當軸致眞摯深切之希期。其言雖嚴。而其意則至足欽。同時國人對於政治。向少顧問。盡委責任於政府。使政府常苦於無民意爲監督。無民氣作後盾。今日國人對外交當局深致其批評與希期。正足以證明國人已有深切之政治覺悟。此則尤爲進步之現象。據前日電訊。外部將聲明希望國人合理的督促政府處理萬案。以博最後之勝利。足見當局之尊重民意。及處理萬案之愼重。記者目擊時艱。悲感叢集。對於比來外交。亦覺有未能已於言者。感於當局之尊重民意。爰亦效野人之獻曝。謹抒管見。略爲論列。國人有恒言曰。「弱國無外交。」故每當與國外交涉。輒先自以爲我弱彼强。我非彼敵。外交必難操勝。已氣先餒。人乃益張。而外交乃眞無往而不失敗。固也。最後之武力。實爲外交强而有力之後盾然而彼爲侵略。我爲自衞。彼曲而我直。彼非而我是。假使負責交涉者。能以勇往直前之精神。不卑不抗之態度。作嚴正之爭辯。則公理之所在。正義之所在。雖不足以挫　横暴者之氣燄。我卽不求勝。要亦足以自衞。要亦足以使世界人士明辯是非。春秋時子産相積弱之鄭。對晉楚之兩大交涉。辭令不卑不抗。持正義與抗爭卒以全鄭。卽其明證。孰能謂弱國遂無外交。此則外交貴乎善於辭令。善於以氣之壯老爭勝負之說也。進而言之。所謂外交絶非限於負責交涉而已。平時必先充分準備。求瞭然於各國之情况。及其相互之關係。瞭然於對手之隂謀。及進取之步驟。更以己國之利害爲依向。確定對各國交涉之政策觀察旣明。政策旣定。臨事運用敏捷之手段。以决勝負於撙爼之間。則卽不必勝。應亦不至敗。十九世紀時内部散漫之德意志與意大利。其能抗禦外侮。完成統一卽得力於俾士麥及加富爾之優越外交政策。戰敗後之德國。以及號稱東方病夫之土爾其。其能逐漸提高其國際地位。亦由於德前外長斯德萊爾蔓。及土總統凱末爾之以艱苦卓絶之精神努力與各國周旋。孰能謂弱德遂無外交。此則外交貴乎有充分之準備。有確定之政策之說也。故弱國非必無外交。惟無充分準備。無一貫政策。而又先自餒其氣者。乃眞無外交。吾人以弱國無外交爲可痛則可。因之先行餒氣則不可。以弱國無外交而益以自勵則可。坐以待人得寸進尺。操刀宰割。而不謀自衞則不可。一念之差。足以種亡國之因。此我外交當局我國人在今日所應深切認淸者也。</p>

<p>中俄竟見不易接近</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）據最近莫斯科消息、中蘇會議代表團關於中國贖回中東路之談判、業告停頓、一時不易解决、蓋蘇俄代表雖似願將鐵路出售、而中方求贖之心亦切、然關於鐵路估價及付欵方法諸問題、雙方意見殊無接近之可能、蘇俄對於中東路估價、至少亦在三萬萬金元或二萬萬五千萬金元、中國全權代表莫德惠、則堅執代價不得超過一萬萬金元、中國代表團並建議組織一專家委員會、切實估定東路價値、而俄方則不能同意、關於付欵方法、俄方所極盼者、爲付現金、否則以關稅計賬付欵法相抵補、俄方希望凡由蘇</p>

<p>會議僅限討論財政不及軍縮</p>
<p>國際法庭開始審查德奥稅約</p>
<p>▲路透二十日倫敦電　法德意比當軸今晚到倫敦維多利亞車站後、不足一小時、卽齊集於英下院中之首相室、連同英美日代表舉行預會、羣衆集於車站及下院門外者、頗爲擁擠、足見一般人對於此次七國會議之重視、各國代表由英首相外相財相三人招待入室、英首相行開幕禮、略述此會所須應付之時局、法總理賴伐爾報告巴黎開會之經過情形、及說明發起法德開談話之精神、又詳叙法國在此問題中之地位、並表示法德兩國忠實合作、以恢復世界信任之希望、德總理白魯寗亦說明合作精神、並感謝巴黎談話之機會、後以統計表册詳述德國所有之金融狀况、及已行之應付方法、一再陳說援助德國之必要、最後討論手續問題、定明晨在外部重行集議、</p>
<p>▲路透二十日倫敦電　執政會議今日舉行歷兩小時、英相麥唐納略陳德國恐慌與世界商業凋蔽之原因、英相稱、胡佛總統停付債欵之提議、爲具有毅力與政治手腕之行爲、且亦切中時艱之舉動、德國窘迫、必須有以助之、勿使之牽動全歐、對德投資者之信任、必須恢復、凡可爲之事、當然泰半須留待銀行家與金融家爲之、但此會之協定、可使各國人民復生信任與膽氣、此會將成世界歷史中禍福所倚之樞紐、苟不得解决時艱之策、則政治上與財政上行將發生之危險、將無人能預言之、如得解决之策、則可爲國際合作逐漸有效之明證云、英相後在下院與德總理白魯寗財長寇蒂斯夜餐、英外相漢德森財長史諾登亦在座、明晨十時將開執政會議全體大會、</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日華盛頓電　昨晚國務卿史汀生電話報告胡佛總統、謂執政會議開幕時、英相麥唐納之演詞、令人欣快、且亦友好云、官塲旋發出消息、聲明美國所擬救濟德國之辦法、將於今日提交倫敦會議、</p>
<p>▲路透二十一日倫敦電　倫敦會議今晨討論各事後、業已延會、美國務卿史汀生曾在會宣稱、美國未向德國提回任何放欵、且有增加其原數者、一般人之印象、此次會議結果、大約將爲繼續短期放欵、而不另訂借欵、</p>
<p>▲國民二十一日倫敦電　英報稱、昨日各國代表談話結果、似已放棄對德長期借欵之原來計劃、而代以十月到期之短期借欵、且將决定休會至秋間再予考慮、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十日柏林電　汎歐洲政治之中心、雖已自巴黎移至倫敦、但德人之關心德法會議、仍未稍减、且以該會議未有具體結果、故引起輿論之爭辯、和平派報紙如柏林日報日曼尼亞報等、皆謂德法會議其事實上之功效如何、姑不置論、而其在歷史上之價値、誠屬不可忽視、波爾森報則謂德法會議雖缺少具體之效果、但法國旣能承認德國財政危機之存在、及救濟之緊急、則前作尚屬有望云云、至反對派報紙則謂德爲德、法爲法、法國之第三共和國將始終與德爲仇、亦如豹之始終不失其斑點云、德意志普通報則目黎會議爲虛僞、勸國人莫爲過度宣傳所誤、蓋法人爲工於禮貌之國家、今德政治家訪法、其甘詞如飴、敬禮有加、固屬其外交上之慣技也、該報復引法國陸軍部長麥金諾氏星期日在蒙米突地方歐戰軍士宴會席上之演說爲證、蓋麥氏對於法國加入國際團體、救濟德國財政之計劃、在德法會議討論正酣之際、尚加以極端之反對也、德國輿論反對論調固甚激昂、但政府方面則尚默默無所表示、據政界中人謂巴黎會議不過一初步會議、其結果須取决於倫敦會議、且巴黎會議中法國始終未有政府要求提出、卽賴伐爾及白里安之赴英、亦未聞有何附帶條件云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十日華盛頓電　倫敦每日紀聞報政治通訊員所稱、美國擬請法意德停造軍艦一年、或至少暫停至明春軍縮大會之後、明日將由史汀生提出七國執政會議等語、今日已由美國務院加以否認、並鄭重聲明、美國受邀出席執政會議之主旨、僅在助成一種協定、供給德國財政接濟而已、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十日倫敦電　七國執政會議雖僅限討論德國財政問題、美國務卿史汀生在此間仍以美總統代表資格、非正式進行軍縮問題、今日下午四時日本駐英大使造訪史氏、晤談半小時、聞日使保證日本對於停付戰債計劃、準備竭誠與美合作、并於軍縮問題有簡單討論、嗣史氏與梅隆接見美新聞記者時、亦稱與日使談及軍縮、惟史氏午間曾與英相麥唐納午餐於海德公園飯店、當時是否討論及此、則史氏不肯明言、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十日海牙電　國際法庭今日在此開第二十二屆特會、由日代表安達主席、本屆會議議程中最重要之事件、厥爲德奥關稅協定、次爲丹麥挪威互爭東格林蘭主權事、會議期約歷一星期、故關於德奥關稅協定之决議、大約可在倫敦七國執政大會閉會前發表、</p>

<h3 id="c56">石友三變態後之東北 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>張學良貫澈和平主張</p>
<p>▲一方希望石覺悟</p>
<p>▲一方則早有防備</p>
<p>天津通訊、第十三路軍石友三之變態、在五月下旬及六月上旬、卽已明顯、六月十二日東北軍檄調步兵三旅砲兵一旅入關、當時雙方形勢幾至一觸卽發、其能延宕至今始行爆發者、則張學良維持北方和平之苦心、實可邀諒於國人、刻下雖已小有接觸、而東北和平使者、仍四出奔走、是否尚能化干戈爲玉帛、不可知矣、茲述事變始末如左、</p>
<p>▲反動派挑撥　石友三之腦筋極簡單、居恒對部下演說、輒曰我不懂甚麽呌作主義、我祗知道誰給我錢化、我就替誰幹事、所以其人反覆無常、徵諸近數年石之行爲、固甚明顯、去年閻馮失敗後、中央本擬將石部解决、無如張學良待人寬大、始終不忘和平二字、代懇中央予以收編、然以中央所給月餉、猶嫌不敷、時有煩言、反動派遂乘機施其挑撥離間技倆、致起疑團、發生隔閡、三月間石赴遼、請張向中央催匯月餉、留遼經月、外間盛傳、石被監禁、嗣雖安然回防、而謠言繁興卜足使石聞而心悸、未幾廣州事起、石與之電信往還、時有接洽、斯時中央方以全力剿赤、無暇北顧、不得不予以優容、增加月餉、同時張副司令亦優加接濟、局勢乃稍緩和、</p>
<p>▲起用張學成　張學成係日本士官畢業、在東北鬱鬱不得志、四月間赴順德、游說石氏、應擴充實力、否則無以圖存、石甚贊成、卽委張爲第三軍軍長、並撥與編餘槍械七八千支、張卽招兵買馬、大發委任狀、共委六個師長、五個混成旅長、識者卽知爲蠻幹、無如近年招兵極難、乃四出招撫土匪、委以官職、臨城馬頭鎭一帶煤礦工人、多被强迫當兵、所轄各縣之警察民團槍械、均被徵發、不消匝月、居然集合三萬餘衆、石部軍餉、益感不足、乃就地籌借給養、日益嚴厲、各縣長無法籌辦、紛紛棄職、來省報告、東北高級將領、見石氏如此胡幹、必有野心、乃暗中戒備、每屆日落、雙方均放武裝步哨、刁斗相聞、天明撤退、局勢至此、又復緊張、</p>
<p>▲槍斃張云責　石之秘書長張云責、曾充吉林大學教授多年、頗有才智、深得石氏倚畀、因見石氏不顧利害、一味胡幹、稍加勸阻、反招石之疑忌、張係東北某要人所推薦、乃將石之隂謀密報於東北、不料事機不密、被石發覺、遂於六月四日深夜、石執手槍、潛入張之臥室、一槍命中、卽令左右瘞於荒郊、外傳活埋者、非信史也、石斃張後、料知東北不能相容、乃電約雜牌軍及與有歷史關係之某某等將領、共同舉事、風聲所播、草木皆兵、斯時張學良正臥病協和醫院、左右將領、旣不便向張請示應付辦法、又無人敢自作主張、幾經磋商、始决定檄調砲兵一旅步兵三旅入關、藉固防務、以防萬一、後來各方面、均不以石氏約期舉事爲然、石氏感覺孤立、乃又派代表到平、表示服從命令擁護中央、局勢至此、在表面上已趨緩和、内中仍甚緊張、</p>
<p>▲東北軍戒備　石軍在去年受張學良改編後、曾經中央指定晉豫交界之七縣爲防地、石不願離開鐵路線、故仍駐順德沙河邯鄲磁州成安彰德等縣、總指揮部設在順德、教導團設在彰德、去年東北軍進關時、曾派騎兵第六旅白鳳翔進駐順德、意在使石軍退出冀省、赴中央指定之各縣屯駐、石氏置之不理、嗣後白旅士兵、不能與石軍相處、乃退出順德、而以内邱南和任縣永年等縣、爲緩衝地帶、彼此各不駐兵、迨至猜欵旣生、雙方互放夜哨、石氏遂派兵進駐緩衝地帶、遇有東北軍夜間派遣之步哨連、卽行繳械、幸東北軍官長、均明大義、避免衝突、乃呈報主官、向石交涉放還槍械、石則諉稱不知、查無其事、東北軍雖隱忍、終感不快、至本月上旬、張學良回復健康、對於軍政事、稍稍過問、漸漸明瞭石軍最近之種種舉動、深感不快、但爲維持華北和平起見、一面派遣代表分赴魯晉向各將領宣示中央意旨、一面調動軍隊、作防務上之戒備、並下令任憑石軍如何挑釁、我方决不與之交鋒、冀促石氏覺悟、一面令于學忠擔任平漢路、令王樹常擔任津浦路、目下軍隊配備極爲周密云、（七月十八日）</p>

<p>南昌通信、萬寳山案發生张、全國憤慨、中外各報社隨軍及駐贛記者、以蔣已由前線返省、特於十八日聯袂至行營晋謁、叩以萬案交涉情形、及前線剿匪情况、時蔣適因處理中樞要政及批閱前敵軍報、非常忙碌、乃派行營副官長何競武代見、茲錄其談話如下、</p>
<p>▲萬寳山案　鮮人無理槍殺吾國僑胞、蔣主席憤慨異常、惟此事發生時、蔣適在最前線督師、交通不便消息遲滯、關於此事詳細情形、尚不十分明瞭、及返抵省垣、得閱各報之記載及外交部之詳細報告、方悉一切、比卽電令外交部嚴重抗議、據理力爭、以期達到革命外交之目的、</p>
<p>▲出巡經過　蔣自電令各軍開始總攻後、特於本月二日由省出發督師、三四日到達臨川、（卽撫州）停留數日、復向南城南豐出發、對各將領指示機宜、並視察當地黨政設施、及民間疾苦、蔣到前線後、士氣振奮、故不出旬日、卽將廣昌黎川克復、富田籐田招携康都亦先後佔領、赤匪最初計劃、係以大部精銳（彭德懷項英兩部之第五第八等僞軍）竄集閩西之建寗寗化一帶、擾我左翼之側、圖出南豐、斷我入廣昌黎川各軍之後路、幸我軍早有準備、並集厚兵力於康都千善石嘴一帶、將由閩來犯之彭匪、完全解决、同時進克廣昌縣城、先後繳獲匪槍八千餘支、解散脅從之之赤奴數萬人、匪之竄擾計劃、完全失敗、匪化民衆、悔悟來歸者亦甚衆、</p>
<p>▲匪衆現狀　赤匪糧食子彈、均無接濟匪兵無吃無穿、苦不堪言、彭匪已全部在康都被解决、朱匪精銳、亦喪失殆盡、現匪殘部、退集寗都、但寗都多平原、可用機槍掃射、最短期内、當可望肅淸之也、</p>
<p>▲蔣暫留省　蔣在前方時、已依照原定計劃、布置完善、故暫回南昌駐節、調度一切、前線軍事、由何應欽負責、蔣總司令暫不回京、赴牯嶺與否、亦未决定、（七月十九日）</p>

<p>▲磋商妥洽　交通部前會有命令至航政局、令奚局長赴江海關、討論接管代辦權問題、嗣海關方面、答稱、尚未奉到交部轉咨財部發下之公示、未便移交、遂致延擱、日前該局又奉交通部令、着赴海關接洽、奚局長奉命後、又越海關與稅務司梅樂和商議、昨日談妥、準於今日移交、</p>

<p>▲茶房互敺　趙連生頭目雖被革除、惟仍在輔工作、昨日該輪由揚回滬、照規停　後、茶房分析濟資、頭目應得一份半、趙雖被買辦革除、因未奉工會命令各工友亦仍認趙爲頭目、故所有半份之酒資、仍給趙、黄雲舫與之爭論、當有工友朱志亭在旁不平、遂生口角、繼以互毆、復由人解　、幸均未受傷、</p>
<p>▲工會調解　朱黄互毆後、經人勸解、乃於下午二時、趙海員工會上海分會由羅唐兩委員　解、結果雙方讓步、以後頭目半份酒資、由趙黄二人均分、工作互助、雙方認爲滿意解决、黄本非會員、現亦由趙介紹入會矣、</p>

<p>▲馬阿蘭卽姚玉英</p>
<p>▲男女之結合如此</p>
<p>▲死者尚遺有妻母</p>
<p>▲結果玉英判無罪</p>
<p>本月十一號夜半十二時、北山西路界路口北站大旅社十一號房間内、有男子馬壽祥（卽馬子祥）、及少婦馬阿蘭、（卽姚玉英）、男女雙服毒自殺、男子當時身死、少婦送入醫院、得慶更生、至十四號由匯司捕房將馬阿蘭解送特區地方法院訊供各情、已誌本報、</p>
<p>▲外間兩封書　但自此案發生後、</p>
<p>一般社會人士、頗爲注意、日前該管匯司捕房及特區法院均曾接到郵遞信函、捕房方面接到之信、具名者爲凌元芳·錢東福·自楊家浜路二百四十號寄發、其信中大致謂馬阿蘭實名姚玉英、其父向在靑島營業、家頗富有、請與死者伸冤、而法院方面所接之一信、則係郭姓具名、謂因慕姚玉英人格、彼願娶爲妻室、</p>
<p>▲男女旁聽多　昨晨已屆此案續　　訊之期、捕房傳同姚女之家屬及證人、將姚玉英解送特院第二庭、由葛之覃推事偕檢察官郭懷璞升座、到庭旁聽之男女、亦滿坑滿谷、被告姚玉英、因毒氣尚未完全淸除、故其兩眼仍極紅腫、站立於被告欄内、</p>
<p>▲夫死後大歸　首由捕房代理王耀堂起而陳述調查經過情形頗詳、謂自此案上次改期後、捕房探員、卽着手詳加調查、始悉被告實名姚玉英、二十二歲、無錫人、家居北四川路士慶路東六里二十二號門牌、父名姚仁傑、向在靑島經營煤礦、髮妻已亡、娶楊氏爲繼室、玉英爲前妻所生、幼時曾在淸心學校讀書四年、於十七歲時、由父母作主、嫁與朱纖澄爲妻、備受虐待、越一年有半、朱忽得病身故、姚女因不堪其苦、乃於一年前、回至母家、與繼母楊氏同居、</p>
<p>▲先抛入情書　會其對面二十號門牌爲張文濤所開之羣新紋藝社、因房屋狹小、不敷應用、乃將十八號房間擴充、死者馬壽祥、則在該社爲技師、其辦公室卽屬十八號房間、與被告臥室、適成望衡對宇、遂致相識、但被告尚有一友名陶桂道、亦在羣新紋藝社辦事、與死者爲同事、陶初頗醉心於被告、嗣因與被告之繼母相識、時往姚家游玩、但因個人獨往、殊不方便、乃帶同馬壽祥同去、但馬壽祥猶恐不妥、遂先書一情書、從窗口抛入被告臥室、閱後頗表同情、自此開始往返、</p>
<p>▲到崑山之巓　本月九號、被告之父、怱於靑島回家、突見有一男子（卽馬壽祥、與被告同在客堂中、乃深起懷疑之心、入晚、向楊氏詰悉、前情、卽與馬壽祥交涉、馬欲自殺、爲被告勸阻、遂於十號、被告與死者先在附近酒店内會面、决議赴崑山山巓一同自殺、以免外人探悉底藴</p>
<p>▲同赴梵王渡　當日因時間已晚、同至湖北路安東旅館闢室住宿一宵、書就遺書五通、分致被告之父·母·及馬壽祥之父·叔·朋友、翌日出外、購得鴉片烟一元、計兩盒、欲至梵王渡車站索取火車時刻表、以便赴崑自殺、中途乃將遺書五封及公園游劵一紙、一併投入郵筒、及至梵王渡、因索討時刻表無着、乃擬改變方針、同赴兆豐花園自殺、惟公園游券、已投入郵筒、</p>
<p>▲大旅社服毒　乃又思同往閘北宋公園圖盡、故同至法阻界霞飛路某飲冰室痛飲冰淇淋、又作遺書一封附郵致其友、嗣被告對於宋公園自殺一層、表示反對、結果遂同至北站大旅社開十一號房間、同服鴉片自盡、被告先服一盒、死者後服一盒云云、今被告家屬及證人均已到案請求質訊、</p>
<p>▲自殺二原因　遂據被告馬阿蘭卽姚玉英供稱、丈夫朱載澄、死已數年、葛推事問曰、頃間捕房律師所述各節、是否事實、答、然、但此次係馬壽祥起意自殺、其自殺原因有二、（一）係疑我另有情人、外面名譽不佳、（二）因經濟壓迫、</p>
<p>▲購一元鴉片　推事又問汝父母欲將汝嫁給一裁縫、有此事乎、答、我並未見過、我與馬早已發生肉體關係、此次彼之自殺原因、已經說明、而我之自殺、則因我並無另與他人發生關係之故、鴉片係馬起意購買、計洋一元、共購兩盒、各吃一盒、我先吃、問、有無教唆及帮助馬壽祥自殺、答、無、全係自願、問、你之自殺是否爲家庭壓迫、答、非也、但死者實名馬子祥云、</p>
<p>▲姚仁傑供詞　繼據姚仁傑供、五十九歲、上海人、煤業、家住士慶路東六里二十二號、髮妻早故、祗生一女、卽被告姚玉英、楊氏係我繼室、於民國十五年結婚、平日與玉英感情、尚稱和睦、玉英於十七歲時嫁朱載澄爲妻、嗣朱身死、迄死三年、遂與夫家脫離、住在我處、我於五月二十二號赴靑島、經營煤礦、於七月九號回滬　得悉此事後以馬壽祥已有妻室、且無力贍養、故未加同意、詎玉英於翌日十號、不别出走、初時祗知其赴親戚處、後見報載、始悉有服毒自殺之事、現要求准予將被告給領、以便將來擇配等語、</p>
<p>▲繼母之所言　又據姚楊氏投稱、三十二歲、北平人、本月九號、丈夫自靑島回家、見馬壽祥在客堂中、乃問我何人、我答其係玉英之朋友、此時馬亦已潛出、迨至翌日、玉英忽然出走、我對於玉英與馬壽祥曖昧之事、初不知悉、某日途遇裁縫店主婦、欲代其姪兒矮子王姓做媒、將玉英嫁彼、且將馬壽祥之事告我、我始悉其事、但玉英此次因何自殺不得而知、</p>
<p>▲張文濤供詞　又據　新紋藝社主張文濤投稱、死者在我處服務、已四五年、月薪五六十元、陶桂道甫於前月始至我處、上月十七號、因死者與陶辦事不力、均被我辭歇、被告姚玉英、確住在隔壁、但對於馬有無曖昧及因何自殺、不得而知、馬原籍無錫父親於去年逝世、現家中祗有老母妻子及一女孩云云、</p>
<p>▲律師之意見　訊至此人證已畢、乃由捕房律師王耀堂起而返稱、馬壽祥此次自殺、不外二點、（一）因生意被歇、經濟壓迫、與被告旣發生關係、乃被告之父、從中反對、且彼倆所作之事、附近一帶、幾人人知悉、故而與被告商議、同謀自殺、照刑法第二百九十條第三欵謀爲同死而犯本條之罪者、得免除其刑、故請依法處斷</p>
<p>▲姚玉英無罪　末由郭檢察官發表意見、略謂按照刑法凡帮助或教唆自殺者有罪、其謀爲同死者無罪、今察核本案各方面情表、實係同謀自殺、應認爲無罪云云、葛之票推事核禀、諭辯論終結、當庭宣判决馬阿蘭卽姚玉英無罪、交其父領回</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>泰晤士河上之鬼</p>
<p>西方科學昌明。文化發達。似乎决没有迷信鬼怪的風氣了。然而民間的信鬼。也正不减於東方。并且有許多文士學士。都在研究靈魂之學。如創造大偵探福爾摩斯的故英國名小說家柯南道爾氏。Ｃonan　Doyle晚年就很信鬼。曾在雜誌中發表文字。大創有鬼之論最近有一位著作家福克司施密司氏。做了一部「泰晤士河」。“The　Thames”叙述泰晤士河上有幾處地方、都有鬼物出現、遊客們要是怕鬼的。還是不去爲妙。據說白克歇埃的喀佛歇Ｃaversham,Berkshire鎭中。遊客倘在河邊搭篷過宿。夜半往往聽得打槳之聲。子細看時。河上没有船。但是總聽得有船隻在那裏駛去。又有一個傳說。阿平屯橋Ａbingdon　Bridge上。每夜有一個女鬼走過。很可怕的高呌一聲「報仇」。竟有人在白天看見伊的頭髮浮在水面。這眞是匪夷所思了。此外尤其有趣的。是皮歇Ｂisham鎭中的一個傳說。據說三百年前。河邊的教堂裏住着一位極有學問的婦人。伊見伊的兒子的習字簿中。墨汚縱横。太不乾凈了。便責罰伊的兒子。可是責罰得太重。竟把他打死了。隔了幾年。伊也鬱鬱而死。從此伊的幽靈常在河邊與教堂中出現。并且在河中洗伊的手。要洗去伊兒子的血跡。這些事情也無非齊東野語、不可深信。只可作爲談助罷了。</p>

<p>▲祭堂佈置　祭堂設豫章公園之中山紀念廳。公園門首。懸胡公遺像。四週圍以電燈。兩旁闌干。滿掛輓聯。祭堂中亦懸胡公遺像。四週繞以素花。並嵌電燈攢成之「精神不死」四字。下列花圈。成月圓形。中設祭桌。上置祭品花果。至爲整肅。</p>
<p>▲公祭情形　十二日爲公祭之第一日。公祭人員。有蔣主席代表賀耀祖。中委程天放、張道藩。黨政委員曹浩森。省政府魯滌平。省黨部劉振羣。及黨政機關要人數百人。（團體來賓在外）祭畢。分送手巾。及胡公遺像。家族代表並向各主祭者答禮。表示謝意。賀魯曹諸氏。當公祭時。泫然涙下。及祭畢。復馳入靈幃。向胡夫人及德馨公子慰問。</p>
<p>▲總座祭文　此次公祭。國府蔣主席。特派賀耀祖代表致祭。其祭文曰。（上略）嗚呼。四郊變壘。烽火飛揚。龍韜虎略。奮迹旗常。曰惟將軍。允推健者。萬夫莫當。單騎匹馬。轉戰千里。絶囐叢巒。敵望風潰。軍中一韓。西北戡定。草簡雄師。滔滔赤禍。乃授江西。敬薛梓桑。直撲盜藪。奚爲我后。同聲異口。余懋乃德。擢破登壇。整軍經武。殺賊方酣。廣昌之役。拔幟先登。傾巢萬瘈。彈雨槍林。爾乃虎發。猛猛騰騰。天胡不弔。喪我干城。功居人後。險趨人先。不矜不伐。矯矯時賢。惟我國軍。移師西討。下誓同袍。上盟有昊。昊天明明。平賊何難。祚我百順。扼我多艱。緬想將軍。英靈不爽。浩氣雄風。長留天壞。相我多土。赳赳桓桓。蘇我孑遺。挽彼狂瀾。擒渠掃穴。一鼓肅淸。相率戮力。以告英靈。伏維尚饗。</p>
<p>▲攝收影片　胡公治喪事務所。爲表揚胡公功績起見。特向上海天一影片公司聘請攝影師嚴秉衡等三人。携帶活動攝影機。赴贛攝取公祭及國葬情形。攝成後。卽用飛機運滬洗製。製成後。帶贛放映。以資表揚。並留紀念。</p>

<p>聖瑪利亞女校。今年適逢創立五十周。曾刋行紀念册。延張默君女士題眉。據其所述五十年前之情形。頗有廻溯之價値。先是有瓊思女士Ｅmma　Jones者。由美來華傳道。旋卽在虹口禮拜堂後。設立女校。命名曰文紀。計得學生八人。均居留在校。當時女士以來學者少。不特免費。反與以錢。給以衣。雖倍加優待。而學生仍寥寥無幾。後値年荒。饑民載道。女士因得學生多人。惟知彼輩窮迫而來。勢必歳豐而去。乃規定在此學者。不以程度爲標準。而以年齡爲限。凡學生年達十八者。不問程度。均須畢業離校。時功課方面。以紡織縫紉園藝烹飪等爲主。唯於上午略讀淺易之聖經與四書而已。内有優秀份子。始稍習英文。未幾美國南北開戰。校中經費無着。女士乃令學生停課。專事女紅。由彼携售洋商。以維持校用。不幸旋又以天花流行。病者幾占全校之半。繼起者又一瓊司女士。且因而不起。校中乏人主持。遂停辦。迨聖約翰大學。建築新校舍。文紀復開。乃易今名云。當時社會風氣之閉塞。及女學創辦之不易。與今之女子年納巨費尚不得其門而入者。相去霄壤矣。</p>

<p>車方由西摩路轉入靜安寺路。卽見愛儷園門前之巍峨牌樓。上書東轅西轅四字。園中走道。悉以白布臨時紮成走廊。懸燈無數。此燈胥以輓聯紮成。誠創舉也。園中一片圓形草地。上有一碑。亦輓聯製成。入夜碑中電炬放光。洵屬奇觀。昔日壁柱之有色者。今咸髮以白色。宛如雪後之銀裝世界。</p>
<p>治喪事務處。不啻一小規模之政治機關。内分庶務·會計·文牘等科。辦事人甚多。僕役咸服夏布長衫。禮貌甚恭。一望而知爲曾經訓練者。余小坐僅半時許。竟易茶十五次。而每易一次。僕役亦易一人。若能知其僕役之數目字。或可得一驚人之數也。</p>
<p>祭堂以王君事冗。不遑一觀。然據王君言。其祭堂之佈置。與孔廟丁祭時無異。兩旁置鐘鼓。禮儀隆重。聞大祭時。將由大同樂會鄭覲文以倉聖大學校友資格。加入奏中和韶樂。中和韶樂係祭聖人所用。今用之哈同。抑哈同亦聖人耶。一笑。點主者係三位前淸遺老。一狀元。一探花。一榜眼。外國人之喪事。而完全用中國式。余未之前聞。有之。恐自哈同始也。</p>
<p>▲出版界消息　周世勳君主編之「電影月刋」第九期。業於昨日由文華印刷所出版·與該書同時出版者。尚有電影明星小史。内容詳載明星之出身情史等。實爲愛觀中外電影者之唯一讀物。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>中國人好闢外道。當然隨順佛說。然未遊印度。不知佛。并非憑空想出。乃憑藉印度生活文化而産出佛教。故欲學佛者遊印度一次。抵得在中國學數年也。須知印度乃智慧樹。而佛乃其所結之果。先有印度文化。後乃産生佛教。不然。佛何以不生於中國。猶太日本高麗。而必出自印度。猶孔子出於中國也。知人乃可論世。論世乃可知人。吾願中國佛徒勿閉門談空。每千人中可開一會。選舉一代表。每人集五角。千人可集五百元。遊印度。從上海到印度。以三百元爲旅費。二百元購佛像帶回。此會可名曰千佛報恩會。若能人出一元。則存儲其一半於會。以爲世界布教之用。若全國佛徒。每人能出一元。一半選人來印度參訪。一半辦世界佛會。則不久全中國文化。可執全球牛耳。須知今日之印度。不似從前。可并參觀進化之印度。接其士大夫。不徒參觀佛跡而已。來者以能英語爲宜。否則所得較少。若結伴而來。五人有一人能英語足矣。來參觀。可并遊錫蘭島。乃佛化之要地。昔法顯曾居此數年。今振興佛教之主倡者。英美均有分會。而華人寂然無聞。止太虛師一遊世界。然太虛師爲余言。彼計劃以三四萬元在巴里辦一佛會。終不可得。可想見佛徒之吝嗇。以學佛者而不能去吝嗇。亦何用呼。但若遊錫蘭。須多用一百元。但以上之數爲最少數也。果有來者。上海赫德路十九號佛會當可招待。</p>
<p>是晚納侖米沙教長與英文教員等。修飾余所作之亞洲文化協會宣言。其宣言以復興東方文化。反對戰爭爲主旨。詞極冷刻。用余名義發表於世界。其文中根本推翻屠戸之文明。在印度方面。運動甚爲熱烈。與甘地運動聯络。但甘地學術感化力甚大。運動甚烈。余在此數月。并曾見甘地。而於其根本致力大運動之本源。尚未能甚了解。究竟何以徒手與英政府戰。而能得勝利如止。余問之多人。均言甘地善默禱。蓋得佛力。彼等信甘地如新佛。試與印人一談論。便可驚其心力之偉大深遠。均云受甘地之教化如此。蓋印人長於用心力。而甘地爲心力新發明者。觀於全印人心力之猛進。則徒手戰勝槍砲之運動。似未嘗無希望。此事印人深信爲可能。然以吾中國人思想觀之。似頗不易也。余初時頗以爲笑談。但近日或亦受印人精神環境之感化。似亦覺得有二三分可能性。不過印度文化欲以良心戰勝强權。究竟人類良心是否可靠。在今日尚一疑問也。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良便把三國志授與夫人，夫人搖搖手：</p>
<p>「你念給我！」</p>
<p>無法可想，祇得念給伊聽。這是第三山了，旣不是從頭看起，就隨便揀了一回，隨口念着。夫人聽了一下，不知是是没有什麽趣味呢？還是很專心聽着？伊把眼睛閉了。子良念了好一會，覺得伊聲音也没有，難道伊睡着了麽？於是住了口，輕輕的呌伊：</p>
<p>「月如！」</p>
<p>伊不答應。</p>
<p>「月如！睡着了麽？」</p>
<p>當眞睡着了，伊一些聲音也没有。子良把三國志放好，自己用極輕的足步，走往亭子間去，其時還不過七點鐘光景，大可以改幾本作文簿咧。他正走到樓梯頭：</p>
<p>「捉賊！」</p>
<p>子良聽得夫人一聲狂呌，怎麽不嚇？</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>「捉你這逃走的賊！」</p>
<p>說罷，伊哈哈大笑：</p>
<p>「你好！你好！我並没有睡着，你倒逃走了。你以前常對我說：永遠不娶小老婆。我總以爲：我不死，你却不會娶小老婆，不過到我一死，恐怕難免；但是從你現在的行爲看來，就是我不死，你也會娶小老婆的。你想，我人還没有睡着，你已經停了三國志，溜到後面去了。</p>

<p>▲新閘　昨米市提漲、人心激昂、因天時關係、店號雙方乘此檔勢、購買存貨、歷年以來、大暑前米價必漲、厚粳早稻晚稻等貨售盤均增二三角、蘆洋尖銷場極殷、情况堅定、變隂二元昨到三筒、當日如數斛脫、行情喊起尺許、内地來船被野鷄墩一帶大風、不能馳入、故而絡繹進口</p>
<p>▲南頭　各帮來源寥寥、城鄉店銷雖不旺、惟售性因到積不多、厚粳行情抬高二三角、薄稻到頭亦薄、寗胃仍細、本街鮮料尚活、行情亦增尺許、蘆洋尖緣洋米日增、銷路尚活略昂、變隂元到銷兩寂、無徣沉、洋米客帮及本街去路續有、市形步緊、</p>

<p>▲内地帮活動買進</p>
<p>昨日粉市、以洋麥報價、雖又小去一二角左右、惟以連日均有陣雨、氣候又見隂寒、各處正患水災、何堪再經陣雨、故於將收之早熟、及未收之晚禾、直接間接、均有影響、所以内地帮之買氣、又　活動、遠期各月份、均步開步高、惟本月份因實銷不動、依然平疲結果本月份較前日好二釐半、八月份好一分半、九月份好一分二釐半、十月份好一分、十一月份好十釐半、十二月份好一分云、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、大致呈堅定之象、洋麥報價雖微小、惟内地帮及長江一帶、均有購進、蓋以各處患水、糧食喊價步昂、順勢拾辦、其意亦有所據、不過本埠之經營者、終以洋麥之未脫過剩、前途仍有洋麥之打擊也、結果本月份較前日好二分、八九十月份好一分、十一月份小一分、十二月份好二分、現麥市面、仍居定局、較昨無甚上落、開丹陽揚州南京滁州麥計二千一百包、由福新埠豐華豐信大等辦去、送廠船麥高貨開三兩五錢半、次至三兩三錢半云、</p>

<p>▲五百五十斤繅折價開一百四十五兩</p>
<p>浙屬春蠶、今歲因備受天時之損害、繭身次多優少、産額奇歉、廠絲原料枯薄、繭市俏利、邇來各絲廠因絲業公債發行在卽、分謀開工、咸起補購原料、求過於供、繭價益趨漲勢、昨日閘北某絲廠進杭紹新春乾繭三百八十担、五百五十斤繅折、價開一百四十五兩、凈絲本每包須扯八百兩、外加繅工等成本須一千兩左右云、</p>

<p>昨祁寗兩路之花香紅茶、俄國協助會進意轉濃、全市成交三千餘箱、售盤自十四兩五錢至十六兩五錢、見跌二三兩、路莊珍眉綠茶、市面仍無重大進展、茶價愈趨下跌、惟針眉·秀眉等項、法莊需求尚殷、市上存底枯薄、市盤回漲三四兩、其餘貢熙珠茶等貨、市况均趨寥落云、</p>

<p>▲箱茶運輸問題　婺源箱茶出口、向由樂河鄱湖運至九江轉滬、去歲鄱樂匪氛、河運阻截、箱茶多改旱道挑運溪口、由屯杭運申、但旱運挑費旣昂、手續繁細、本年饒樂匪氛稍靖、河運漸可通行、不料上月方邵共匪、又由閩邊竄擾德興、婺樂河路復阻、各號鑒近金源昌箱茶水客被匪扣綁、咸具戒心、欲改旱道挑運、又苦缺乏挑夫、對此運輸問題、甚費躊躇、間有改經江灣由屯轉申、惟多數須俟贛河通運、齊帮啓行云、</p>
<p>▲二字珍眉大帮齊堆　本邑首字珍眉大帮均早陸續運滬、雖抽蕊稍有動機、出盤已不如屯珍早到得之善價、普通珍眉、更滯積無銷路、市面之緊縮、前所罕有、故茶號對二字珍眉大帮、均從容緩製啓運、以免貨擠跌價、刻全邑各號二字珍眉大帮相繼齊堆、成箱等運、進茶不多之號、僅做二帮完場、續製三四帮者實不多覯、除吉生昌·元吉·馨記·益太怡·益太祥等號進茶最豐外、餘均下月中旬告竣云、</p>

<p>▲客帮今日有止裝說</p>
<p>連日疋頭市頗有直上靑雲之勢、走銷之暢達、爲歷來所罕見、自朝鮮發生排華以來至昨終、達一萬六千件之譜、故存底已呈一空之勢、雖檢查已漸實現、然大部份已運入内地矣、就中以長江流域辦意較濃、四川採辦最早、漢口江西蕪湖等帮近三日來、方猛力搜辦、北帮心思較淡、良以嗣後倘抵制劇烈、可改向大阪直接添辦、所以反有回出、本街去路亦異常踴躍、滬杭京滬二路車站大有山積之狀、惟至昨檢查已有實行之勢、故稍歛跡、客帮方面、亦有今日止裝之說、昨市略形見軟、行家退關之貨爲從來未有、實以貨未到滬、已先出售之故、然亟謀出脫、亦屬重大原因、細嗶嘰頗有呈絶跡之象、湖心亭·歡樂·千里駒紛紛售罄、寳球三錢九分二厘半、長江帮搜辦頗烈、莫干山·獵雁直貢一致斷檔、花　無論大柄·中柄黑花均羅掘殆盡、花直貢呢更呈希有之狀云、</p>

<h3 id="c195">活輪的解剖 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 呆</p>
<p>▲英美汽車界同聲贊美</p>
<p>關於活輪之文字。本刋迭有刋載。固無庸再述。但今再爲讀者作進一步之研究。俾知活輪之主要優點何在。並將各種優點。加以解剖。蓋自活輪車發明以來。英美兩國汽車界方面。一般工程師皆已承認爲汽車上絶大之成功。自有汽車史以來。活輪更爲最大之發明。揆其原因。乃在開車之時。用電力發動耳。工程界利用活輪。發動汽車之時。一若孩童之輩。騎於自由車上。發動與進頓。隨心所欲。非常自由。實屬令人驚異者也。此外活輪之優點頗多。不勝枚舉。今姑擇重要之點。爲讀者告。卽以黑潑麻鼻爾汽車而言。自利用活輪以來。已有六缸車一種。八缸直邊式車四種。實行採用活輪。而各種新車之中。竟因採用活輪之故。試車結果。滑油節省百分之十八。汽油節省百分之十二以上。他如車身之上。機件之磨擦石。亦减少多多。此皆因齧合子之必要動作。利用活輪。可减少百分之三十至六十而有以致之。且活輪汽車、所採安全計劃。均足予駕車人以安全便利。實無美不備也。</p>
<p>活輪汽車。滑油及汽油。可節省如許者。蓋舊日所用之引擎。喉道閉塞而後。仍在轉動。以致油量虛費。今則除緩緩行動之時。每小時行十哩。二十五哩。三十哩。引擎仍在動作外。喉道閉塞而後。卽可停止旋轉。新車之上。一經採用活輪。則所有震力。卽可完全消滅。至於後方之衝撞。在普通車輛之上。年習見者。在活輪車上。可不致發現。蓋喉道突然開放或閉塞。普通車輛之機件。均不免因而衝撞。在此種情狀之下。車胎之剥蝕程度。必可因而低减。車身亦然。此外活輪汽車。更有一重要優點。如黑潑廠各種新車。世紀牌八缸及六缸新車。以及Ｇ字。Ｈ宇。Ｕ字等各牌新車。裝用活輪者。雖用第二擋排。駕駛之時。亦便利易如。無聲而靜止。</p>
<p>以黑潑車廠。所有各種新車。採用活輪者而言。其構造原理。亦頗簡單。並無特殊之點。與普通車輛不同者。惟活輪汽車。齧合子之移動。頗爲便利。不拘用何種速度。均可互相移動而轉變。蓋在普通車輛之上。要减速率。須先降至低速之處。再由低速而改用第二擋排。而活輪車則不然。自第二擋排加至最高速率。或自最高速率减至第二擋排。均可直接轉換。且不必用契合子。在此種情狀之下。車輛向前之勢力。必足控制引擎前進之力量。然車輛之中。若不用活輪。則齒輪之變換。必須用齧合子矣。足見活輪車輛。駕駛之時。非常簡便。故駕車之人。一經採用黑潑廠各種活輪新車。莫不萬分滿意也。駕車之時。所有動作。均可無聲。實足予駕車人以極大之便利。今日之汽車。以運用最高速率而無聲靜止者爲上乘、駕車之人。固莫不知之。然自黑潑廠以活輪車輛。介紹於社會而後。第二擋排。亦有驚人之成績矣。此種新式第二擋排。用三部分速法。主要優點。卽在無聲。而齒輪之改換。更見便利易如也。</p>
<p>黑潑麻鼻爾活輪新車。其中所製齧合子。爲過度式或一方式者、此種齧合子。可使車輛前進之際。自動之時。約每小時六哩至八哩、擋排不拘最速或較次。均可運用。蓋此種齧合子。運用之時。一如孩提之輩。在駕駛自由車也。職是之故。各種黑潑新車。行動之時。可節省。汽油滑油。一切其他費用。亦較經濟。而舊式車輛之傳動系統。幾視爲古董矣。在車輛擁擠之處。有時衝入途中。出發駛行者。活輸車輛。祇須用足力高舉加速器。卽引擎停止之時。車輛仍在前進。卽在途中疾駛之際。欲使車輛停止。亦頗爲便利。藎車輛自身之動力。亦可加以阻止。將加速器低降。引擎之速力立可增加。駕車之人。在閙市之中。欲擠入車輛中心。祇須將轉換桿推動。不必動及齧合子。卽轉換最高速車。杜桿亦祇須放回第三位置。而不必動及齧合子。由過去之成績。證明活輪車上。齧合子之動作。可减少百分之三十至六十。卽此一端。物質之經濟。人力之節省。盡在其中矣。是故活輪新車。旣可節油。又可减少修理之次數。因而問世以來。大受汽車界之歡迎。預料不久更有重大之發展也。我人可拭目而待之。</p>

<p>— 學遷</p>
<p>浙省對於路政之進行。最爲猛速。故其成績。遠在各省之上。其在最近一月中。或則分别整頓。或則限制票價。或則勘測路線。或則准設分站。尤覺無微不至。他如修正給照辦法。催繳養路捐欵等等。更能逐漸改良。是則不可謂非路政當局注意之效果也。爰將調查所得。分别言之。</p>
<p>▲别别整頓紹蕭段車務　浙建廳以紹蕭段公路。年來營業尚稱發達。祇因未能切實整頓。致路務日漸腐敗。旅客咸感不便。近紹興縣建委會。提議從速整頓蕭紹段路務。大致分三點。一應由路局將開窗售票時間。酌量延長。並督飭駐站路警。維持購票秩序。乘客在購票時間。可依到站之先後。分行排列。先到者先購。俾不致有擁擠之弊。二應由路局嚴飭司機及站務人員。於每次開車前。先將車輛詳細檢查。平時亦應規定每月檢騐次數。一經發覺機件稍有損壞。切須從速修理。庶不致車輛因小有損壞。遂致不堪收拾。三當視沿線交通情形。酌加區間車。以資救濟。至於車窗破損。乘客時遭風雨一節。其事雖小。而其影響人民對於路局之印象甚大。尤應從速修復。以便行旅。此外尤宜洗滌車輛。標明站名。業已由縣呈請省建廳令飭公路局迅行分别整頓。以期改進云。</p>
<p>▲限制增加各路段票價　浙建廳頃據公路局呈請近日以來。各種材料。無不漲價、營業收之盈餘、頓形減少。擬將各路段車票價目稍爲增加。以資彌補等情。並附送各路段里程表。各站現在票價表。及將來擬加之票價表一份到廳。兹悉建廳以築路行車。原爲便利交通。但查核所增票價。多則百分之七十。少亦百分之八九。爲數似嫌太多。殊非顧全物力。且現在各路段車輛。泰半損壞、旅客往來。深感不便。嚴令路局遵照前令。切實整頓。所請票價一節。當俟整理就緒。及各路段車輛補足後。再行查核辦理也。</p>
<p>▲寗波分站暫緩行設立　奉化縣商人組織統一委員會曁寗波市商人組織統一委員會。代電報省公路局有塡塞濠河。添設汽車站之舉。呈請省府迄迅飭取銷原議。以利交通。當由省府令飭省建廳查明核辦具報。頃悉由路局派鄞奉改車務辦事處主任沈洸。會同寗波市政府共同核查。據報設擬塡濠河部分。原係鄞縣内河航船碼頭。如塡作基地　。則原有碼頭。勢必向西遷移。是往來民船。裝卸貨物。距市稍遠。不免略受影響。就地市民。所以反對塡河。亦卽在是。玉靈橋門附近。如欲另設車站。除市政府業經標賣空地外。實無相當地址。且寗波市府標賣空地價値、每畝約在二萬五千元左右。現値經費</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>支絀。一時尚無餘力購地。故設站一節。擬暫從緩辦理。建廳據復。卽令惟暫行從緩。並令飭鄞縣縣長轉飭知照。並呈復省府矣。</p>
<p>▲勘測松遂松麗兩路線　松陽縣政府建設科提議擬於三年内。開闢完成松遂松麗兩路一案。前經省建廳令飭省公路局先行派員前往勘測。並以原提案所議於縣建設特捐項下。每年酌撥若干成。充作築路經費一節。碍難照准。經令飭松陽縣長另擬籌欵辦法。呈候核奪。茲悉公路局業經令派黄樂叚測量隊佐理工程司盧銳。前往勘測。是兩線計長一百八十五華里。經過山嶺。跨越大溪之處頗多。工程艱巨。所需經費約銀一百三十餘萬元。並以是線非達龍游興蕭常鐵路相啣接。營業難期發展。經盧工程司將遂昌至龍游一叚附帶勘測。由省建廳將原報告書及調查表。令飭松陽縣長存備參考。至於建築兩路經費。仍須照廳令辦理。</p>
<p>▲修正長途汽車給照法、浙建廳近奉鐵道部令開。查長途汽車公司發給執照規則。業由本部於十九年九月五日公布。並制定報照格式。先後呈請行政院備案。旋奉第二七一○及第三三五○號指令·連同本部前呈之長途汽車公司發給執照規則。修正備案等因。茲將修正長途汽車公司發給執照規則及格式。一併抄發。仰卽知照云云。頃已由建廳修正長途汽車公司發給執照規則及格式。抄發并通飭各縣長。省公路局及商辦各長途汽車公司知照。</p>
<p>▲蕭常路業已試行機車　蕭常鐵路。業經試行機車。沿路居民。蠭擁爭觀。此後車輛運料往來益頻。一般鄉愚。罔知危險。偶一不愼。非特人畜死傷。卽車輛路基。亦受損害。杭江鐵路工程局爲愼重起見。將應行示禁各節。臚列於後。（一）沿線居民應嚴加管束兒童。不得在軌道上放置石塊。及其他障碍物。違者拘辦。（二）鐵路上所置石碴。不准移動。違者處罰。（三）一切牲畜不得在鐵路而同放牧、違者重罰。（四）鐵道上螺絲釘枕木軌道號說等。關係最爲重要。絶對禁止搬弄盜竊。違者責令村長根究。（五）一切船隻經過鐵路橋下。務須緩行。如有衝撞椿木。應將船隻扣留議罰。（六）鐵路上絶對禁止行人行走。（七）行人横越軌道時。須遵照路局所設横道行走。并應注意有無火車來往。如聞汽笛放聲。尤應立卽遠避。茲聞浙建廳亦以事關鐵路與人民之安全。令縣轉飭沿線各村里曉喻居民。勿自蹈禍害也。</p>

Since the Red bandits have caused chaos, it has lasted for three years and poisoned seven provinces.

<h3 id="e13">Foreign Insults and Diplomacy (I) <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Wanpaoshan case and the pan-Korean anti-Chinese incidents have occurred one after another. These are truly shocking events in the international arena. At the same time, it also shows that the people of weak countries are under the iron hooves of the violent, and there is almost no human rights or justice to speak of. The people of our country are aware of the urgency of foreign insults and the difficulty of the country's steps, and hope that the diplomatic authorities will be able to use an indomitable spirit, orderly steps, and flexible means to negotiate and reverse the humiliation with the powerful. The more we hope, the stricter the criticism. Therefore, recently, there have been slight criticisms of the diplomatic authorities from time to time. These phenomena are all caused by the patriotism of the people, and the sincere and profound hope to the authorities. Although the words are strict, the meaning is worthy of admiration. At the same time, the people of our country have always had few advisors on politics, and have entrusted the responsibility to the government, making the government often suffer from the lack of public opinion to supervise and the lack of public spirit as a backing. Today, the people of our country deeply criticize and hope for the diplomatic authorities, which is enough to prove that the people of our country have a deep political awareness. This is an even more progressive phenomenon. According to yesterday's telegram, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will declare that it hopes that the people of our country will rationally urge the government to handle the Wanpaoshan case in order to win the final victory. This shows the authorities' respect for public opinion and the prudence in handling the Wanpaoshan case. The reporter witnessed the difficulties and felt a lot of sadness. Regarding recent diplomacy, I also feel that there are things that I cannot say. Feeling the respect of the authorities for public opinion, I also learn from the wild people's exposure of the sun, and respectfully express my humble opinions for a brief discussion. There is a common saying among the people of our country: "Weak countries have no diplomacy." Therefore, whenever dealing with foreign countries, we always think that we are weak and they are strong, we are not their enemies, and diplomacy will be difficult to win, and we are already discouraged first. People will become more arrogant, and diplomacy will really fail everywhere. It is also true. The final force is the strong and powerful backing of diplomacy. However, they are invading and we are defending ourselves. They are wrong and we are right. If the person in charge of the negotiation can use the spirit of courage and perseverance, the attitude of not being humble or arrogant, and make serious arguments, then the place where justice lies, the place where justice lies, even if it is not enough to frustrate the arrogance of the violent, even if we do not seek victory, it is enough to defend ourselves. It is also enough to make people in the world understand right and wrong. During the Spring and Autumn Period, Zi Chan assisted the weak Zheng State and dealt with the two major negotiations of Jin and Chu. His words were neither humble nor arrogant, and he upheld justice and resistance, and finally saved Zheng. This is clear proof. Who can say that weak countries have no diplomacy? This is the saying that diplomacy values ​​being good at rhetoric, being good at using the spirit of strength to compete for victory or defeat. Furthermore, the so-called diplomacy is by no means limited to those in charge of negotiations. In peacetime, we must first fully prepare, seek to understand the situation of each country and their mutual relations, understand the opponent's conspiracy and the steps of advancement, and take the interests of our own country as the basis to determine the policy of dealing with each country. Once the observation is clear and the policy is determined, we will use agile means to decide the outcome between the pots and pans. Then, even if we don't have to win, we shouldn't lose. In the 19th century, the internally scattered Germany and Italy were able to resist foreign insults and complete unification thanks to Bismarck and Cavour's superior diplomatic policies. Germany after the defeat and Turkey, known as the sick man of the East, were able to gradually improve their international status also because of German Foreign Minister Stresemann and Turkish President Kemal's efforts to deal with various countries with hard work and outstanding spirit. Who can say that weak Germany has no diplomacy? This is the saying that diplomacy values ​​having sufficient preparation and a definite policy. Therefore, weak countries do not necessarily have no diplomacy. Only those who have no sufficient preparation, no consistent policy, and are discouraged first have no diplomacy. It is painful for us to think that weak countries have no diplomacy, but it is not possible to be discouraged first because of this. It is possible to encourage ourselves with the fact that weak countries have no diplomacy. It is not possible to sit and wait for others to gain an inch and cut them off without thinking about self-defense. A difference in thought is enough to plant the cause of national destruction. This is what our diplomatic authorities and our people should deeply recognize today.</p>

<p>(Kaifeng) Liu Zhi and other 32 generals sent a circular telegram, saying, "The Red bandits are harming the country, and the race is in danger of extinction. Koreans are repelling the Chinese, and the Japanese are coercing the territory. All patriots are filled with righteous indignation and want to carry their weapons to suppress internal rebellion and resist foreign insults to protect the national heritage. Moreover, Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally entered Jiangxi in the heat to command the bandit suppression, working tirelessly. Those who have a little conscience should rise up at the news and work together to extend a line of life to save the existence of the nation. If we are still ignorant of the great righteousness, act for private interests, and act outside the norm regardless of the country's emergency, it is to isolate ourselves from the Party and the country, willingly sink the land of China, and we are the giant moths that endanger the people and the public enemy of the country. We and others belong to the military and dedicate our lives to the country. We swear to supervise our troops, accuse them of their crimes, support unity, and die for it. The ruling officials and generals of the provinces are passionate and patriotic, and I believe they will have sympathy. We send our sincerity and wait for enlightenment."

<h3 id="e15">East Route Negotiations Stalled <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Sino-Russian Views Difficult to Bridge</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to recent Moscow news, negotiations between the Sino-Soviet conference delegation on China's redemption of the Chinese Eastern Railway have stalled and are difficult to resolve for a while. Although the Soviet Russian representatives seem willing to sell the railway, the Chinese side is also eager to redeem it, but on issues such as the valuation of the railway and the method of payment, the two sides have no possibility of approaching. The Soviet Russian valuation of the Chinese Eastern Railway is at least 300 million gold yuan or 250 million gold yuan. The Chinese plenipotentiary representative Mo Dehui insisted that the price should not exceed 100 million gold yuan. The Chinese delegation also suggested organizing a committee of experts to realistically assess the value of the Eastern Railway, but the Russian side could not agree. Regarding the method of payment, the Russian side most hoped to pay in cash, otherwise, it would be compensated by the method of customs duty accounting. The Russian side hoped that all goods imported into China from the Soviet</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Russian territory would be taxed by accounting. In addition to Soviet Russian products, this measure must include goods exported from Germany and Poland through the border. Of course, the Chinese side cannot agree to this request. Furthermore, even if China recognizes this method of customs duty accounting, during the payment period, Soviet Russia requires to continue to employ Russian directors and Chinese as deputy directors. The Chinese delegation insisted on using Chinese as directors and one Russian and one Chinese as deputy directors, and at the same time requested to be employed as directors of various offices, with Russians as deputies. Judging from the above disputes, even if the negotiations do not break down for a while, the views of the two sides have little opportunity to be reconciled. In addition, there have been slight changes in the method of paying salaries to Russian employees of the Eastern Railway. According to the old practice, all salaries were directly paid by the railway bureau on time. Recently, Russian employees jointly requested that their salaries be deposited in the Harbin branch of the Soviet Russian National Bank for withdrawal at any time. However, there is an additional condition for the implementation of this measure, that is, if there is a need for service in the Soviet Russian country, Russian employees have the obligation to be transferred back to the country. Although most Russian employees are unwilling to return to their country, in order to achieve this newly promulgated salary payment method, they have also declared that they are willing to be transferred at any time.

<p>Respectfully to All Newspaper Offices: The fields of Wanbao Mountain have been forcibly occupied and reclaimed by Korean immigrants transplanted by Japanese imperialists. When they are reasoned with, they resort to their power and disregard justice. First, they expand propaganda to incite Koreans to hate China, and then they use the supreme authority of the military and police against defenseless and unfree Koreans, but they fail to seriously suppress the riots. As a result, rioters have risen in Incheon, Seoul, Pyongyang, Wonsan, Busan, and other places, brutally beating our overseas Chinese, destroying our property, attacking our consulates, and running rampant. The tragic news of bloodshed and devastation is deeply saddening. It is believed that external insults are caused by internal turmoil and a weak national strength. Such an unprecedented tragedy should be seriously dealt with by our party and government authorities to stop the atrocities of the Koreans. Our compatriots should express their righteous indignation. Only with genuine awakening and solidarity can we strengthen ourselves and wipe out national humiliation. It is hoped that all virtuous people at home and abroad will work together to maintain peace and unity, eliminate reactionaries, and quickly sweep away the Communist bandits, so that the foundations of the country can be consolidated and construction can be completed. By gathering the strength of all the people and using it as a backing for diplomacy, justice can be upheld and power can be restrained. The vast land of China relies on our joint efforts, which will not only protect our overseas Chinese. We are sending this telegram to express our sincerity and await your guidance. Liu Zhenhua, the Pacification Commissioner of Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Suiyuan, and Liu Maoen, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eleventh Route Army, along with Deputy Division Commanders Xu Pengyun and Ruan Xun, Brigade Commanders Wu Tinglin, Xing Qingzhong, Yang Tianmin, Liu Huixin, Yao Beichen, Ma Qixing, and all officers and soldiers respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e53">London Conference Opens <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Political Leaders from Seven Countries Gather in One Hall</p>
<p>A Major Turning Point in the European Economy</p>
<p>Speech by British Prime Minister MacDonald</p>
<p>Confidence in Investment in Germany</p>
<p>Said to Be Necessary to Restore</p>
<p>The United States Plans to Submit a Concrete New Plan</p>
<p>Advocates for Short-Term Loans to Germany</p>
<p>The Conference is Limited to Discussing Financial Matters and Does Not Include Disarmament</p>
<p>The International Court of Justice Begins to Examine the German-Austrian Tax Agreement</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 20th: Officials from France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium arrived at Victoria Station in London tonight. Within an hour, they gathered in the Prime Minister's room in the British House of Commons, along with representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, for a preliminary meeting. The crowds gathered at the station and outside the House of Commons were quite dense, showing the importance that people generally attach to this seven-nation conference. The representatives of each country were greeted by the British Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Chancellor of the Exchequer and led into the room. The British Prime Minister gave an opening speech, outlining the situation that the meeting must deal with. French Prime Minister Laval reported on the proceedings of the meeting in Paris and explained the spirit of initiating talks between France and Germany. He also described in detail France's position in this matter and expressed the hope for faithful cooperation between France and Germany to restore world trust. German Chancellor Brüning also explained the spirit of cooperation, thanked him for the opportunity of the Paris talks, and gave a detailed account of Germany's financial situation and the measures taken to deal with it, repeatedly stating the need for assistance to Germany. Finally, the procedural issues were discussed, and it was decided to reconvene at the Foreign Office in the morning.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 20th: The executive meeting was held today for two hours. British Prime Minister MacDonald briefly stated the reasons for the German panic and the decline of world commerce. The Prime Minister said that President Hoover's proposal to suspend debt payments was an act of perseverance and political skill, and also a timely move. Germany's plight must be helped to avoid dragging down the whole of Europe. The confidence of investors in Germany must be restored. Of course, most of what can be done must be left to bankers and financiers, but the agreement of this meeting can restore trust and courage to the people of all countries. This meeting will become a pivot of fortune and misfortune in world history. If a solution to the current difficulties cannot be found, the political and financial dangers that will arise will be unpredictable. If a solution can be found, it will be a clear demonstration of the gradual effectiveness of international cooperation. The Prime Minister later had dinner with German Chancellor Brüning and Finance Minister Kortis in the House of Commons, with British Foreign Secretary Henderson and Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden also in attendance. A full meeting of the executive meeting will be held at 10:00 am tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 21st: Last night, Secretary of State Stimson telephoned President Hoover, saying that Prime Minister MacDonald's speech at the opening of the executive meeting was pleasant and friendly. The official arena then issued a message stating that the United States' proposed relief measures for Germany will be submitted to the London Conference today.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 21st: After discussing various matters this morning, the London Conference has been adjourned. U.S. Secretary of State Stimson announced at the meeting that the United States has not withdrawn any loans from Germany and has even increased the original amount. The general impression is that the result of this meeting will be to continue short-term loans and not to make new loans.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 21st: British newspapers said that as a result of yesterday's talks between representatives of various countries, it seemed that the original plan for long-term loans to Germany had been abandoned and replaced by short-term loans due in October, and it was decided to adjourn the meeting until autumn for further consideration.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 20th: Although the center of Pan-European politics has shifted from Paris to London, the German people's concern for the Franco-German conference has not diminished, and the lack of concrete results from the conference has aroused public debate. Peace-oriented newspapers such as the Berliner Tageblatt and Germania all said that the actual effect of the Franco-German conference, whatever it is, cannot be ignored in terms of its historical value. The Börsen-Zeitung said that although the Franco-German conference lacked concrete results, France was able to acknowledge the existence of the German financial crisis and the urgency of relief, so there is still hope for previous actions. Opposition newspapers said that Germany is Germany, and France is France, and the Third Republic of France will always be hostile to Germany, just as a leopard will never lose its spots. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung called the Paris meeting hypocritical and advised the people not to be misled by excessive propaganda. After all, the French are a polite nation, and now that German politicians are visiting France, their sweet words and respectful etiquette are their diplomatic conventions. The newspaper cited as evidence the speech given by French Minister of War Maginot at a banquet for World War I sergeants in Montmédy on Sunday. At a time when the discussion of France's joining international organizations and the German financial relief plan was in full swing at the Franco-German conference, Maginot still strongly opposed it. Although German public opinion's opposition was very strong, the government remained silent. According to people in political circles, the Paris meeting was only a preliminary meeting, and the results will depend on the London Conference. Moreover, France has never made any government requests at the Paris meeting, and even Laval and Briand's visit to England has not been heard with any accompanying conditions.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 20th: The London Daily News political correspondent said that the United States plans to ask France, Italy, and Germany to stop building warships for a year, or at least suspend them until after the Disarmament Conference next spring. This statement will be submitted by Stimson to the Seven-Nation Executive Conference tomorrow. Today, the U.S. Department of State denied this and solemnly stated that the main purpose of the United States' invitation to attend the Executive Conference is only to help an agreement to provide financial assistance to Germany.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 20th: Although the Seven-Nation Executive Conference is limited to discussing the German financial problem, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson is still unofficially conducting disarmament issues here as the representative of the U.S. President. At 4:00 pm today, the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom visited Mr. Stimson and talked for half an hour. It was heard that the Japanese Ambassador assured that Japan is ready to cooperate with the United States sincerely on the plan to suspend war debts, and had a brief discussion on the disarmament issue. Later, when Mr. Stimson and Mellon met with U.S. news reporters, they also said that they had talked with the Japanese Ambassador about disarmament, but Mr. Stimson did not say whether this was discussed during lunch with British Prime Minister MacDonald at the Hyde Park Hotel at noon.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, The Hague, 20th: The International Court of Justice held its 22nd special meeting here today, chaired by Japanese representative Adachi. The most important event on the agenda of this meeting is the German-Austrian tariff agreement, followed by the dispute between Denmark and Norway over the sovereignty of East Greenland. The meeting will last about a week, so the resolution on the German-Austrian tariff agreement will probably be released before the closing of the Seven-Nation Executive Conference in London.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Indian Round Table Conference Expanded <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Leaders of the People's Party Invited to Participate</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 21st: To expand the foundation of the Indian Round Table Conference and to include the leaders of the Indian National Congress Party, British Prime Minister MacDonald has issued 36 invitations to participate in the Federal Structure Committee meeting to be held in London in early September. Last year, a total of 21 representatives attended the Federal Structure Committee meeting. Now Gandhi is one of the newly invited members. Representatives of oppressed nationalities, workers, and women in India are also participating this time. The number of Muslim representatives has also increased. The date of the meeting has not yet been determined and is expected to be announced soon. The possibility of Gandhi coming to England reminds people of Gandhi's first visit to England forty-two years ago. At that time, Gandhi was 19 years old and entered university to study law. Later, he became a lawyer and resided in South Africa, witnessing the plight of overseas Chinese and thinking of ways to help them, and invented the theory of non-violent resistance. He returned to India before the European War, and during the war, he helped British officials recruit Indian soldiers.</p>

<h3 id="e56">The Northeast After Shih Yiu-san’s Aberration <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Chang Hsueh-liang Upholds Peaceful Principles</p>
<p>▲ One Side Hopes for Shih’s Awakening</p>
<p>▲ The Other Side Has Long Been Prepared</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The aberration of Shih Yiu-san’s 13th Route Army was already evident in late May and early June. On June 12th, the Northeast Army urgently dispatched three brigades of infantry and one brigade of artillery into the Shanhaiguan Pass. At that time, the situation between the two sides was almost at the point of ignition. The fact that it was delayed until now to erupt is due to Chang Hsueh-liang’s painstaking efforts to maintain peace in the North, which should be understood by the people of the country. Although there have been minor clashes, the Northeast peace envoys are still running around. It is unknown whether they can turn hostility into friendship. The beginning and end of the incident are described as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Instigation by Reactionaries: Shih Yiu-san’s mind is very simple. He often says to his subordinates in his speeches, "I don't understand what is called a doctrine. I only know that whoever gives me money to spend, I will work for him." Therefore, his personality is fickle. This is very obvious based on Shih's actions in recent years. After the failure of Yan and Feng last year, the Central Government originally intended to resolve Shih's troops, but Chang Hsueh-liang was generous and always remembered the word "peace," so he pleaded with the Central Government to incorporate them. However, he still felt that the monthly salary given by the Central Government was insufficient and often complained. The reactionaries then took the opportunity to use their divisive tactics, causing suspicion and alienation. In March, Shih went to Liaoning to ask Chang to urge the Central Government to remit the monthly salary. He stayed in Liaoning for a month. It was widely rumored that Shih was imprisoned. Although he safely returned to his defense, the rumors made Shih feel uneasy. Soon after, the Guangzhou incident occurred. Shih had frequent correspondence with them. At that time, the Central Government was focusing all its efforts on suppressing the Communists and had no time to attend to the North, so it had to appease him by increasing his monthly salary. At the same time, Deputy Commander Chang also provided generous assistance, and the situation eased slightly.</p>
<p>▲ The Appointment of Chang Hsueh-cheng: Chang Hsueh-cheng is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy. He was frustrated in the Northeast. In April, he went to Shunde to persuade Shih to expand his strength, otherwise he would not be able to survive. Shih agreed very much and immediately appointed Chang as the commander of the Third Army and allocated 7,000 to 8,000 surplus rifles. Chang immediately recruited soldiers and issued commissions widely, appointing a total of six division commanders and five mixed brigade commanders. Those who knew the situation knew that this was reckless, but it was very difficult to recruit soldiers in recent years, so he went everywhere to appease bandits and appoint them to official positions. Coal miners in the Lincheng Matouzhen area were mostly forced to become soldiers. The police and militia firearms in the counties under his jurisdiction were all requisitioned. In less than a month, he managed to gather more than 30,000 troops. Shih's military pay became even more insufficient, so he borrowed supplies locally and became increasingly harsh. The county magistrates were unable to raise the funds and resigned one after another, reporting to the province. The Northeast senior generals, seeing Shih acting so recklessly, believed that he must have ambitions, so they secretly prepared. Every sunset, both sides would deploy armed sentries, and the sound of night watchmen would be heard. At dawn, they would withdraw. The situation became tense again.</p>
<p>▲ The Execution of Chang Yun-tse: Shih's Secretary-General, Chang Yun-tse, had been a professor at Jilin University for many years. He was quite talented and deeply trusted by Shih. Seeing that Shih was acting recklessly without considering the pros and cons, he tried to dissuade him slightly, but instead aroused Shih's suspicion. Chang was recommended by a key figure in the Northeast, so he secretly reported Shih's conspiracy to the Northeast. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was discovered by Shih. On the night of June 4th, Shih, holding a pistol, sneaked into Chang's bedroom and shot him. He immediately ordered his men to bury him in the wilderness. The rumor that he was buried alive is not true. After Shih killed Chang, he knew that the Northeast could not tolerate him, so he telegraphed to miscellaneous troops and certain generals with historical ties to start an uprising together. The news spread and everyone was alarmed. At that time, Chang Hsueh-liang was ill in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. His generals were not convenient to ask Chang for instructions on how to deal with the situation, and no one dared to make their own decisions. After several discussions, they decided to urgently dispatch a brigade of artillery and three brigades of infantry into the Shanhaiguan Pass to strengthen defenses and prevent any eventuality. Later, all parties did not think that Shih's appointed date for the uprising was right. Shih felt isolated, so he sent representatives to Beiping to express his obedience to orders and support the Central Government. At this point, the situation had eased on the surface, but was still very tense inside.</p>
<p>▲ Northeast Army Prepares: After Shih's army was reorganized by Chang Hsueh-liang last year, the Central Government designated seven counties bordering Shanxi and Henan as defense areas. Shih was unwilling to leave the railway line, so he remained stationed in Shunde, Shahe, Handan, Cizhou, Cheng'an, Zhangde, and other counties. The general headquarters was located in Shunde, and the training regiment was located in Zhangde. When the Northeast Army entered the Shanhaiguan Pass last year, it sent the 6th Cavalry Brigade, Bai Fengxiang, to station in Shunde, intending to force Shih's army to withdraw from Hebei Province and go to the counties designated by the Central Government to garrison. Shih ignored this. Later, the soldiers of Bai's brigade could not get along with Shih's army, so they withdrew from Shunde and used Neiqiu, Nanhe, Renxian, Yongnian, and other counties as buffer zones, with neither side stationing troops. When suspicions arose, the two sides began to deploy night sentries, and Shih sent troops to station in the buffer zone. When encountering a Northeast Army night patrol company, they would disarm them. Fortunately, the Northeast Army officers all understood the overall situation and avoided conflict, so they reported to their superiors and negotiated with Shih to return the firearms. Shih denied any knowledge of the matter and claimed that nothing had happened. Although the Northeast Army was patient, it was ultimately unhappy. In early this month, Chang Hsueh-liang recovered his health and began to inquire about military and political affairs. He gradually understood the recent actions of Shih's army and felt deeply unhappy. However, in order to maintain peace in North China, he sent representatives to Shandong and Shanxi to declare the intentions of the Central Government to the generals, and mobilized troops to prepare for defense. He also ordered that no matter how Shih's army provoked, our side would never engage in conflict, hoping to prompt Shih to wake up. He also ordered Yu Hsueh-chung to be in charge of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, and Wang Shu-chang to be in charge of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. It is said that the troop deployment is currently very thorough. (July 18th)</p>

<p>▲ Communist Bandits Flee to Ningdu and Ruijin</p>
<p>▲ But Ningdu is Also Under Encirclement</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: After the Communist Suppression Army's left wing captured Guangchang, it went straight to Shicheng and Ningdu, and Jianning in Fujian. On the 16th of this month, Zhu Shaoliang, Zhao Guantao, Chen Cheng, and other troops attacked the Mao bandits from Baishui Town in Guangchang, advancing towards Shicheng. At that time, the Mao bandits believed that this place was related to the contact between the Red bandits in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, so they personally led 20,000 to 30,000 bandits, including Gu Daogong, Li Wenlin, and Luo Binghui, to resist stubbornly. The Communist Suppression Army took advantage of the victory to drive straight in, and the Red bandits were defeated, suffering heavy casualties. The bandits, seeing that the Communist Suppression Army was irresistible, wanted to win with a surprise attack, flanking and attacking, attempting to bypass Jianning and Ningdu, and encircle the Communist Suppression Army's left and right. The Communist Suppression Army divided its forces to resist, responding calmly, and sent several airplanes to drop heavy bombs on the bandit side, bombing them. The bandits resisted slightly, but were unable to withstand it and fled back to Ningdu and Ruijin. The Communist Suppression Army then recovered Shicheng County. The Headquarters has received an airplane report that there are our army symbols in Baishui, Guangchang, and our army has entered Shicheng. Also, the front-line headquarters yesterday received a telegram from Zhu Commander-in-Chief, that before our army captured Shicheng, Zhu bandits robbed clothes, food, and silver dollars from Fujian, forcing 8,000 to 9,000 farmers to carry loads through Shicheng to Ningdu lair, but our army used lightning speed to capture Shicheng, bandits stolen goods, all were seized by our army. He Yingqin immediately telegraphed Chiang, asking for instructions on how to deal with the 8,000 to 9,000 porters, Chiang specifically ordered to give them money and send them back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>The front-line headquarters recently sent another telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, roughly saying that one unit of our left wing entered Fujian to pursue the bandits, and recovered Jianning on the day before yesterday, capturing more than a thousand Red bandits. Fujian army Liu Heding, Zhang Zhen and other divisions, because the left wing entered Fujian, took a pincer style attack on the Red bandits. The bandits, because Guangchang and Shicheng were lost, Fujian-Jiangxi contact was cut off, extremely panic wanted to break out of the encirclement from Ninghua Changting, was Liu Zhang each division from Yanping Jiangle, severely attacked killed more than a thousand bandits, peasant bandits scattered.

<p>▲ He Jingwu’s Talk to Newspaper Reporters</p>
<p>▲ Chiang's Attitude Toward the Wanbaoshan Incident and Temporary Unwillingness to Return to Nanjing</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: After the Wanbaoshan incident occurred, the whole country was indignant. Military reporters and reporters stationed in Jiangxi from Chinese and foreign newspapers visited Chiang at the command center in a group on the 18th, as Chiang had returned to the province from the front line. They asked about the negotiations for the Wanbaoshan incident and the front line's suppression of bandits. Chiang was dealing with central government affairs and reviewing front-line military reports, so he dispatched the Adjutant General of the Headquarters, He Jingwu, to meet them. A transcript of He’s speech is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Wanbaoshan Incident: Koreans unreasonably shot and killed our country's overseas Chinese, Chairman Chiang was extremely indignant. However, when this happened, Chiang was inspecting the troops on the front line, communication was difficult and the news was delayed. Regarding the details of this matter, it was not very clear. After returning to the provincial capital, he read the records of various newspapers and the detailed report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then he knew everything. He immediately sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest seriously, argue with reason, in order to achieve the goal of revolutionary diplomacy.</p>
<p>▲ Inspection Trip: After Chiang telegraphed the various armies to begin a general attack, he set off from the province on the 2nd of this month to inspect the troops. On the 3rd and 4th, he arrived at Linchuan (i.e. Fuzhou), stayed for a few days, and then set off for Nancheng and Nanfeng, instructing the various generals on the situation, and inspecting the local party and government facilities, and the suffering of the people. After Chiang arrived at the front line, the morale was boosted, so in less than ten days, Guangchang and Lichuan were recovered. Futian, Tengtian, Zhaoxie, and Kangdu were also occupied one after another. The Red bandits' initial plan was to gather a large number of elite troops (Peng Dehuai and Xiang Ying's 5th and 8th fake armies) in Jianning and Ninghua in western Fujian, to harass our left wing, and attempt to break out of Nanfeng and cut off our army's rear route into Guangchang and Lichuan. Fortunately, our army had prepared early, and concentrated heavy troops in Kangdu, Qianshan, and Shizui, completely resolving Peng's bandits who came from Fujian. At the same time, Guangchang County was captured, and more than 8,000 bandit rifles were seized, and tens of thousands of Red slaves were disbanded. The bandits' plan to harass was completely defeated, and the bandits turned into the people, and many who regretted and came back.</p>
<p>▲ Current Status of the Bandits: The Red bandits have no supplies of food and ammunition, and the bandit soldiers have nothing to eat or wear, and are suffering unspeakably. Peng's bandits have all been resolved in Kangdu, and Zhu's elite troops have also lost almost all of them. Now the bandit remnants have retreated to Ningdu, but Ningdu is mostly plains, and machine guns can be used to sweep them away. It is hoped that they can be wiped out in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>▲ Chiang Stays in the Province Temporarily: Chiang had made perfect arrangements in the front according to the original plan, so he temporarily returned to Nanchang to reside, and directed everything. He Yingqin is responsible for the military affairs on the front line. Chiang General Commander will not return to Nanjing for the time being, and it has not been decided whether to go to Kuling or not. (July 19th)</p>

<p>▲ Water Begins to be Released into the Irrigation Ditch at Majiashao Pass</p>
<p>▲ Plainclothes Japanese Police Freely Search Civilian Residences</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Since the 13th, water has been released into the ditch for the Korean rice planting in Wanbaoshan. Because the irrigation ditch has only been dug through five li, the areas around Sanxingbao where the farmers filled in the land have not been fully restored. The river water is blocked, overflowing the civil fields on both banks, measuring several hundred qing. The farmers are afraid of the Japanese side's power, and dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Because the Japanese police are stationed at Majiashao Pass, the costs are too high, so according to the consulate's order, 23 people have been secretly withdrawn to Changchun, and machine guns, rifles, and ammunition have also been transported back to Changchun in part. However, most of the transportation back is at night, in order to prevent exposure. The machine guns are transported in yellow felt packages, claiming that the Japanese police died of illness. Currently, the Japanese police at Majiashao Pass are afraid that the farmers will attack, because of the small number of Japanese police, so they specifically built five thatched huts by the river, and set up more than twenty tents, insert Japanese flags, inside no one, and three or four li outside, implement martial law, prohibit people from entering, plainclothes Japanese police, every day enter each village to probe the farmers news, and investigate each farmers representatives names and addresses, especially pay attention to Sun Rongqing Sun Yongming, and also advertise that someone look for Sun Rongqing Sun Yongming to come forward to mediate, reward with gold tickets thousand yuan, notify Sun Rongqing Sun Yongming residence and by the Japanese police find, reward with five hundred yuan, two Sun therefore dare not live at home, Sun Yongming Changchun annexed land, set up Qingshengda candy store, for Japanese police know, send many people to cover search, Sun in advance avoided to other place was exempted, Japanese police has not got Sun, actually will the number counter staff beat a meal to go, in Sanxingbao Majiashao Pass of the Korean, Heng night into nearby rural village, steal away cattle dogs, skin cook, supply Japanese police, so the farmer lost cattle and dogs are very many, the Japanese side also instructed the Chang City Korean People's Association president, coerced the detained Hao Yongde and his wife, ordered them to sign and seal on blank contract paper, trying to make false evidence, for use, Hao and his wife, are illiterate, fear fall into a trap, increase the guilt, refuse to sign and seal, the matter was heard by the municipal planning office, will Hao carry out the investigation, get the whole story, immediately chase out its name chapter, seal save the office, and leave its husband and wife fingerprints, in order to avoid the Japanese side other life trick, about this case, the Japanese side advocates by local negotiations, not with Korean case confused, stationed in Liaoning Japanese consul general Lin, on the 15th of this month, visited Zhang Zuoxiang, for informal contacts, has put forward (1) retain Wanbaoshan paddy field contract effectiveness, allow Korean people to come to plant rice next year, its cause of planting rice of all the works, also retain, China must not destroy, (2) compensate Wanbaoshan Korean planting rice of the loss, (3) guarantee Wanbaoshan live in Korean life and property, (4) China will allow Korean people free into the Northeast territory to live in the future, Zhang Zuoxiang not immediately reply, promise to wait for the transfer of Jilin negotiator Zhong Yu to talk, Zhong was telegraphed on the evening of the 15th, i.e. traveled night and day to Liaoning, resident Jilin Japanese leader Ishishi, also on the 16th to Liaoning, the future is to be by Zhong and Ishishi negotiate in Liaoning, all Wanbaoshan case files,</p>

<p>The Chinese Consulate General in Korea, the Kuomintang branch in Korea, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce dispatched personnel to Pyongyang to comfort the Chinese who were in distress and investigate the circumstances of the Korean riot. The entire process has been recorded in previous reports. Now we will further</p>
<h3 id="e61">Chinese Overseas Chinese Who Were Beaten in Seoul <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Record the full text of the report as follows: We set off for Pyongyang on the evening of the 8th of this month, and arrived at Pyongyang Station the next morning. Immediately, the Japanese governor's office staff Mori Yama and police officer Mori O, and the Dong-A Ilbo reporter Kim Sung-eop surrounded us at the station. A few steps away, there were also sixteen or seventeen representatives of various Korean people's groups. After greeting each other, we walked out of the station. We originally wanted to hire a car to go directly to the Chinese overseas Chinese shelter to comfort the victims and inquire about the details of the victims, but the staff of the governor's office forced us to take the car they had prepared and escorted us to the Pyongyang Hotel. They invited us into an extremely deep room. After exchanging greetings, Mori Yama once again made various alarming threats and shed tears (fake crying) to express his love for the Chinese overseas Chinese. He also told us not to act freely, so as to avoid being attacked by unexpected rioters. After we severely questioned him and said that before we came, we had already asked the chief of the foreign affairs section of the Governor-General's office and the chief of the police department about the truth here. They all said that the place was already peaceful and nothing was happening, so we could go. Therefore, we came here under the orders of our superiors. The mission of this trip is only to comfort the overseas Chinese and inspect the situation of the victims. It has no other purpose. We have already made the determination to sacrifice our lives when we came, and we especially hope that the rioters will quickly attack us to fulfill our benevolence of sacrificing ourselves. In short, no matter what, we must first go to the Chinese overseas Chinese shelter to comfort and inquire. Mori Yama had no reason to answer, so he excused himself to go back to the governor's office to ask the governor for instructions, and then went together.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Chinese Resident of Seoul who was Beaten <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>After a while, Yanben, the chief secretary of the Pyeongannam-do Governor's Office, came and stated, "It is extremely regrettable that the esteemed residents of your country have suffered this unwarranted disaster. However, post-incident accommodations and other matters have been handled jointly by the provincial and municipal offices, as well as the compassionate relief efforts of the Korean populace. All are now safe and sound." We then stated, "There is no need to discuss the matter of 'giving two jujubes after a slap in the face.' What we want to know is the actual current situation of our compatriots." He said that all 5,200 or so Chinese residents in Pyongyang had been accommodated in the Medical Training Institute and felt very safe. "We (the Japanese) have been working day and night to fulfill our responsibility of protection." We also said, "We have come to express our condolences, not for investigation or negotiation. Please do not say more, and quickly allow us to see our suffering compatriots." He had no choice but to agree, and asked us to wait a moment for permission from his superiors before allowing us to meet. We ordered him to make frequent phone calls. At that time, a reporter from the Dong-A Ilbo came to visit and stated that this unfortunate incident was not the intention of the Korean people, nor was it the work of the Pyongyang Koreans. According to his personal observation, those who committed the violence were all hired from other places by a certain country, specifically to do this. According to his investigation, none of the more than 500 Chinese households were spared; all were destroyed and looted by rioters. 71 men and 12 women were beaten to death with clubs, short knives, etc., for a total of 83 people. 64 men and 9 women were seriously injured, and 33 men and 6 women were slightly injured. All property was lost," and so on. As we were talking, the Japanese man returned from making a phone call, and the reporter hurriedly bid farewell. We then traveled with Japanese police officers in a car to the accommodation center. Along the way, we did not see any signs of alert or instability. Unexpectedly, as the car approached the accommodation center, we saw a large team of Japanese soldiers and police, heavily armed and on high alert, as if facing a major enemy. When the car arrived at the gate, we saw countless compatriots in the courtyard, men, women, old, and young, who had been harmed, with broken heads, swollen legs, broken arms, and blind eyes, which was heartbreaking and unbearable to witness. We were then led by a Japanese gate guard to a room, but we did not see any compatriots. Among those who came to speak with us, we requested to meet with the business association leaders and party comrades among the disaster victims. The Japanese, reluctantly, sent more than ten people, including the business association president Meng Xian Shi, escorted by military police who spoke Chinese. When we met, we stared at each other in silence, unable to say a word. Then, everyone embraced and cried bitterly, unable to make a sound. Later, someone forced out a few words while weeping, saying,</p>
<p>"We have been ordered by Consul General Zhang and the chairman of the business association and the party committee to come and express our condolences, and we are willing to investigate the circumstances of the harm suffered by our compatriots, the true nature of the Korean riot, in order to prepare materials for requesting a serious negotiation with the government." He then advised Chairman Meng to stop crying and report in detail. He said, "Before the incident, I stayed in Andong due to business. I heard rumors of unrest among the Koreans and rushed back to Pyongyang, requesting protection from the Japanese police in Pyongyang. The Japanese police officer said that there was no need to panic and assured us that we would be safe. That night at nine o'clock, a large number of Korean youths started a riot, wielding long sticks, short knives, stones, and bricks. They killed and injured any Chinese they encountered, and destroyed and looted any Chinese households they found. Some blew whistles to give orders, and some shouted slogans to instigate, yelling 'Kill the Hu people.' Hu people is what Koreans call Chinese people. None of the Chinese who encountered them were spared, and not a single Chinese household was left. According to their post-incident investigation, 5,112 people were forcibly detained here by the Japanese police. More than 500 households in the city were destroyed, and more than 500 men, women, old, and young were injured to varying degrees. 216 people were beaten to death, and countless people were missing. Some were even disemboweled and had their hearts gouged out, with livers and intestines scattered everywhere. Even infants in swaddling clothes were not spared, and some had their noses and ears cut off. We have been in Korea for decades, and our property is worth hundreds of thousands, and we have never offended anyone. At the beginning of the riot, some Koreans planned to hide and protect us, but the Japanese police not only did not allow it, but also did not allow us to carry any belongings, only allowing us to be detained here alone, suffering in the open air. Not only could we not move freely, but even news from inside and outside was completely cut off. The riot lasted for two days, with numerous acts of violence, but the Japanese police did not interfere at all. Only after all the Chinese were wiped out did the Japanese military police begin to impose martial law." At this point, the Japanese police did not allow him to continue speaking, and Meng and others burst into tears again, not daring to say more. We then requested the Japanese police to allow all the refugees to meet and receive condolences. The Japanese police excused themselves by saying that the space was limited and they could not gather everyone. We insisted, so they gathered fifty or sixty refugee leaders to talk. Before we could speak, all the representatives burst into tears. We were filled with anger and grief and slapped ourselves in the face several times, expressing that as officials protecting overseas Chinese, we had allowed our compatriots to suffer so much and could not fulfill our duties, feeling ashamed and unable to face anyone. We asked our compatriots to especially forgive our helplessness due to the lack of any police power. We then told the disaster-stricken compatriots several points: (1) The tragedy suffered by our compatriots this time is beyond the expectations of any civilized country in the world. In this so-called civilized and law-abiding country under Japanese rule, such a major massacre and act of violence has occurred. I don't know where the Japanese police have gone. Therefore, regarding this planned massacre, we will not ask the people of the subjugated Korea, but we will seriously negotiate with the Japanese state. (2) Our Eastern spirit has always valued universal love and the principle of great unity. This tragedy has even killed many ignorant infants, which is truly a bankruptcy of Eastern morality to the extreme. We are not only ashamed for the Korean people and for the Japanese officials and civilians ruling Korea, but also feel unfortunate for the Chinese people, the center of our Eastern civilization. (3) Regarding this tragedy, we do not have to hate the great Japanese Empire, but we should thank the lessons of the great Japanese Empire. Our weakness and strength, the theory of self-strengthening with might but without justice, our great sacrifice this time can be considered the price of awakening. Now that things have come to this, I hope you will not think of fighting with your bare hands. Since there was no resistance before, we can only let the Japanese kill or spare us as they please, and wait for the sympathy, assistance, and negotiation of the government of our country, the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chinese business associations, and the civilized countries of the world."</p>
<p>While someone was speaking, the Japanese police forcibly stopped him three times, but we thought that since things had come to this, it was still not allowed for officials of our country to say a few words of self-blame, which was truly unreasonable. Therefore, we did not listen to the prohibition. After someone finished speaking, Comrade Zheng intended to express his opinion as a representative of the Chinese Kuomintang, but the Japanese police ultimately did not allow it. We then went to various places to inspect and saw thousands of female compatriots, holding more than 300 babies, crying together, swarming towards us, pulling at us, and shouting for help. We were empty-handed, and our hearts were filled with fear and sorrow, and we cried together, shedding tears of sympathy. When the Japanese military police saw this scene, they feared a major incident, so they carried out an emergency mobilization, preparing to fire, surrounding us, and not allowing us to cry anymore, even hitting women and children with rifle butts, not allowing them to cry anymore. Fortunately, a certain gentleman was alert and secretly took several photos of the tragic situation amidst the noisy voices, which could be used as a reference for future negotiations. The most tragic thing was that not only were ordinary farmers and workers greatly abused, but even the business association president and other leaders had to sleep on damp ground in grass sheds and eat sticky rice balls. The wealth accumulated through more than 20 years of blood and sweat was lost in an instant, and they still had to endure such great suffering. What was even more unbearable was that they had to represent the disaster-stricken compatriots and thank the Japanese side. As we were urgently inspecting, an official from the provincial office suddenly came to invite us to the provincial office to talk, otherwise we would not be able to inspect freely. We had no choice but to go to the provincial office. When we got in the car, one of the business association leaders tried to go with us to see the provincial governor, but he was pulled back by the Japanese police. When we arrived at the provincial office, we saw that the Japanese all looked panicked, but pretended to be calm. When we saw the provincial governor, the chief of internal affairs, and the chief of police, we were filled with anger and did not know what to say. They expressed their gratitude to us, and we replied that we were busy. Later, the chief of internal affairs asked us in a stern tone why we had stirred up the excitement of the refugees. We then loudly told him that the refugees were in a foreign country and were brutally murdered by foreigners for no reason. When they saw officials from their own country, it was like seeing their parents. How could they not cry and express their grievances? As for us, we uphold public justice and fairness, and your country does not need to ask too much to avoid creating more bad feelings. They then softened their tone and boasted about their efforts to protect the overseas Chinese, and showed us the provincial office's notice. However, it was nothing more than a proclamation inciting Koreans to massacre Chinese. Before we finished talking, the provincial governor had already secretly ordered someone to prepare a Western meal. When we saw that the table had been set, we forcibly bid farewell, telling them that our compatriots were suffering in the accommodation center and that we had come to express our condolences, so how could we enjoy ourselves here? We were also afraid that your government office would be suspected of bribery, which would be even worse. They did not dare to keep us any longer. After we left, we were surrounded by Japanese newspaper reporters who asked us what our impressions were of this trip. We replied, "Only one word: barbaric behavior." They then insisted on taking a photo of us, and we asked the Japanese police to take us to the cemetery in the jurisdiction of the Daidong Police Station in the suburbs to pay our respects to the overseas Chinese who had been killed. The Japanese police were reluctant, but after we repeatedly requested, they agreed to first take us to the Pyongyang Hospital and then to the cemetery. We first went to the hospital and saw more than 200 seriously injured overseas Chinese men and women, and 30 or 40 children, all with serious head injuries, who were unlikely to survive. As we were inspecting, two people died before our eyes, and the tragic situation was beyond words. After leaving the hospital, we took a car to the cemetery. Unexpectedly, the car deliberately went the wrong way, detouring for more than 20 miles, and we saw that the vegetable gardens of the overseas Chinese had all been looted and their huts had been burned down. The most convincing evidence of the Japanese conspiracy was that next to the Daidong County Office and west of the Daidong Police Headquarters, the large Chinese flour mill and soy sauce garden were also burned and looted. We don't know how the Japanese authorities can explain this. After several hours, we finally arrived at the cemetery, where we saw dozens of Japanese police officers helping Korean workers hurriedly bury the dead bodies. When they saw us, they pretended to be compassionate and said that the Korean rioters were too hateful and that the people they killed were too pitiful. Fortunately, the Japanese authorities chose this place to bury them and hired workers to repair the graves. We asked how many people had already been buried, and they replied, "Not many, not many, only a little over 90 people." We then asked how many children had been killed, and they replied, "Only five or six." Alas, according to the Japanese report, there were already so many, let alone the actual number. I remember that during the Gengzi Incident (Boxer Rebellion), the Chinese only killed one Japanese clerk, which led to the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance and a great disaster for our country. But now, the massacre is so huge, yet no country has come out to speak up for justice. The so-called grave repair by the Japanese was just burying five or six communal mounds of flesh. We bowed four times to the graves, cried a few times, and Comrade Zheng delivered two sentences. A certain comrade took photos to commemorate it. We returned to the city and inspected the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Not only was the entire Chamber of Commerce destroyed and smashed by the rioters, but the national flag and consular passports were also torn into pieces. The portrait of the founder Sun Yat-sen was trampled into scrap paper, the party flag was stained with blood, and the party plaque was split into two pieces, because the party headquarters was attached to the Chamber of Commerce. We took</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>photos, and the Japanese police even threatened us with another attack by Korean rioters. What could be more ridiculous? We are willing to die, so what is the point of scaring us? We finally took photos and left, then took a car back to Seoul to report. Regarding the results of this inspection, we conclude that this major massacre was entirely under Japanese rule and was carried out in a planned manner. Its cruelty is unprecedented, a hundred times more barbaric than the remnants of Baluchi's group in Nikolaevsk. Is this how civilized countries act? Is this how friendship and love are proclaimed? Thinking of this makes one shudder. May all the people of our country be aware of this, and may all the people of the world be aware of this. (Among the 5,200 refugees detained, there were 900 women and children who were too terrified. The refugees asked the Japanese police to allow them to return to their country to reassure them, but the Japanese police did not allow it. This is recounted here.) (July 10)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Attitude of Korean Residents in Jilin Toward China <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>▲Issuing a Declaration 丨 Expressing Goodwill</p>
<p>▲Kim Ri-sam 丨 Was Assassinated</p>
<p>Jilin dispatch: The attitude of Korean residents in Jilin toward the Sino-Korean incident is highly noteworthy. Our authorities are both earnestly advising them and strictly guarding against them. As a result, the 600,000 Korean residents have not taken any unusual actions. They have also organized a committee to investigate the Wanbaoshan Incident, thoroughly investigating and understanding that our side has not oppressed the Korean residents in any way. The massacre of Chinese in the Korean territory was due to being misled, which damaged the goodwill between the Chinese and Korean nations. In addition to sending a telegram to Gyeongseong to convey to all the Korean people to recognize the facts and not to riot again, they also issued a declaration to China expressing their regret. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>A respectful message to all Chinese compatriots: The Wanbaoshan Incident was originally a very minor issue, but because the Japanese police in Changchun mobilized their forces and Japan incited anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea, it has surprisingly become a major issue in Sino-Japanese negotiations and Sino-Korean relations. As this issue escalates and rumors abound, we feel it is necessary and obligatory to issue a solemn declaration. Since Korea was ravaged by the Japanese railway, our people and passionate youth have been planning independence every day. During this period, due to our historical and geographical ties with China, we have received considerable assistance from our Chinese compatriots. No one with a brain and knowledge does not appreciate China's magnanimous attitude. Under these circumstances, we should show extreme goodwill to our Chinese compatriots so that we do not betray them. However, human nature is uneven, and it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad, so the unfortunate events of the Wanbaoshan Incident and the anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea occurred, which truly fills us with remorse, hatred, and sadness. Although these two incidents were instigated and manipulated by the Japanese, we cannot help but feel regret and shame. We have thoroughly investigated the Wanbaoshan Incident and confirmed that it was the work of pro-Japanese running dogs (Kim Dong-man, Lee Hong-ju, Lee Deok-seo, Lee Jo-hwa, etc.). These people are the greatest public enemies of our Korean independence movement and deserve to be killed. Now, Japan is using them to create antagonism between China and Korea and to disrupt China's security, which is even more unforgivable. Japan is also using this opportunity to play tricks in Korea, creating false rumors and inciting Koreans to commit violence against Chinese residents. The Japanese police not only did not stop them, but secretly sent some Japanese, disguised in civilian clothes, to join the crowd and commit barbaric acts of destroying Chinese businesses and harming Chinese residents, making the Chinese adopt the same narrow-minded attitude as Japan. If this continues, the Korean people living in the three northeastern provinces will have no place to live. In addition to our heartache, we would like to make the following statements: On the one hand, we will advise the Koreans under the command of the Japanese imperialists to repent and quickly leave Wanbaoshan. If they do not, we will definitely use the final means against these hateful elements. On the other hand, we have already informed our compatriots at home about the Wanbaoshan Incident, so that they know that Chinese officials and people have not harmed the Korean farmers in any way. Do not be used by the Japanese, quickly stop the violence, and restore goodwill to the Chinese residents. The facts have already been reported in the newspapers, and Chinese compatriots may have already read them. How should China and Korea work together to defeat this evil Japanese invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia? The shortcut is to first eliminate the shameless running dogs, and then find ways to fight against the imperialists. The Japanese have now organized the "Great Alliance of Japanese Autonomy in Manchuria" to plan for the invasion by the people. At this time, we should unite the Chinese and Korean nations, organize popular organizations, and use the solidarity of the people to confront them and eliminate their invasion as the most important way. We should also awaken the ignorant peasant masses from the temptation of imperialism and provide them with ideological and political training so as to avoid future troubles. In short, the happiness and friendship of our Chinese and Korean nations cannot be achieved until the Japanese imperialists are defeated. We must not be deceived by the Japanese imperialist conspiracy, and we must fight together to achieve our goal. With this, we swear to our beloved 400 million Chinese compatriots. Our slogans are: 1. Oppose Japanese interference in the Wanbaoshan Incident; 2. The Korean farmers in Wanbaoshan must leave immediately; 3. The Chinese and Korean nations unite; 4. Down with pro-Japanese running dogs; 5. Down with Japanese imperialism. Jilin Korean Overseas Wanbaoshan Incident Investigation Committee.</p>
<p>Kim Ri-sam, a reporter from a Korean newspaper stationed in Changchun, previously made provocative propaganda between the Chinese and Korean nations in Korean newspapers regarding the case of Korean farmers forcibly cultivating terraced fields in Wanbaoshan. This led to the massacre of Chinese residents by Koreans in various places in Korea. Recently, Kim, due to criticism from his own Korean people, specially came to Jilin to apologize to various Chinese parties, and submitted articles to various Chinese newspapers clearly stating that he had been deceived and had made mistakes that were unfavorable to Sino-Korean propaganda. The Japanese side, seeing his change of attitude, dispatched Korean police officer Park Chang-ha and several other Koreans from the consulate to Kim's residence at the Far East Hotel, which was set up by Koreans in the commercial port, at 12:00 noon on the 15th. They shot Kim seven or eight times, killing him instantly, and injuring a Chinese passerby named Li En.</p>

<p>▲The Bandit Troops were Defeated by Guo's Troops</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: About 4,000 remnants of the Red Bandit Kong Hechong recently fled into Mushigang, Yangxin County, Hubei Province, and their momentum was very rampant. Guo Rudong's troops stationed in the area suppressed them. Guo also transferred the regiments stationed in Daye and concentrated them to suppress the bandits in Baishapu. By the morning of the 20th, the bandits were defeated. Kong himself led his troops to flee to the Sanxikou area, more than 60 miles south of Yangxin, and their situation was extremely embarrassing. After Guo won this victory, he reorganized his troops to pursue and suppress them, and telegraphed the Wuhan headquarters, requesting that the troops stationed in the neighboring areas act in unison. It is said that the headquarters has sent an airplane and a warship to patrol the Daye, Yangxin, and Huanggang areas, and the airplane is responsible for covering and dropping bombs. It is expected that the bandits can be completely eliminated in a few days. Near the Tongcheng County area, more than 1,000 Red Bandits have also fled from the Hunan border and are looting in the Shuibeilong area. Xie Bin's troops stationed in the area have sent teams to defeat the bandits and are pursuing them toward Xingjing. (July 20)</p>

<p>Hankou dispatch: He Chengjun, the director of the Wuhan headquarters, had previously planned to go to Nanchang to meet Generalissimo Chiang, report on the military and political situation in Hubei Province, the recent progress in bandit suppression, and request instructions on everything. However, Chiang Generalissimo moved to Fuzhou, so he did not make the trip. Recently, Chiang has returned to Nanchang and telegraphed He to go to meet him. He then took the Yihua Company's Ruihe wheel eastward to Xun on the night of the 19th, accompanied by Xia Douyin, commander of the Wuhan Garrison, Liu Hangchen, director of the Finance Department of the Sichuan Provincial Rehabilitation Supervision Office, and others, to transfer to Nanchang. Those who came to the ship to see him off included Xu Yuanquan, Zhu Chuanjing, Chen Guangzu, etc. After He left, Chen Guangzu and Zhu Chuanjing jointly handled the affairs of the headquarters. The chairman of the provincial government meeting was temporarily replaced by Liu Wendao, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and routine official duties were performed by Peng Jieshi, the secretary-general. It is said that He will go to Jiangxi for about four or five days and then return to Hankou. His important tasks, in addition to reporting on the progress of bandit suppression, are probably also to request instructions on the political situation in the north. (July 20)</p>

<h3 id="e69">Hankou Court Bribery Case Closed <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ Defendant Xu Xuehai and others given non-prosecution disposition</p>
<p>The case of Gao Wei vs. Gao Jiazhi in Hankou, involving a property dispute and allegations of collusion and bribery between lawyers and judges, caused a media uproar. The Hankou Lawyers Association reported the matter, and the Supreme Court transferred the investigation to the Jiujiang District Court. Now, the prosecutor of that court, in addition to separately prosecuting lawyer Teng Wensui and Chief Prosecutor Wang Qing, has decided not to prosecute the handling prosecutor Wang Jue, Xu Xuehai, and related person Wang Huazhen due to insufficient evidence of criminal suspicion. The disposition order is recorded below:</p>
<p>Defendant Xu Xuehai, Wang Jue, Wang Huazhen, the defendants listed on the right are suspected of fraud and dereliction of duty. After investigation, it is deemed that they should not be prosecuted. The factual and legal reasons are stated below: Gao Jiazhi, a wealthy merchant in Hankou, was involved in a property dispute with Gao Wei. Gao Wei entrusted lawyer Teng Wensui to handle the case. Fearing failure, she also initiated criminal proceedings for forgery and embezzlement. While under investigation, she further accused Gao Jiazhi of smoking opium. He was examined at the municipal hospital and detention center. Gao Jiazhi, exhausted by the repeated lawsuits, sought reconciliation with Gao Wei, offering 3,000 yuan in cash and five houses. Gao Wei, knowing her claims were unreasonable, agreed to settle. At that time, rumors spread, causing much discussion. The Hankou Lawyers Association received a confidential letter alleging collusion and bribery between lawyers and judges. The Wuchang Higher Procuratorate also received this letter and summoned the handling personnel Wang Jue, Xu Xuehai, and Chief Prosecutor Wang Qing for questioning about the actual situation. Separate records were made and submitted for transfer of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruled that the first instance of this case should be managed by this court. After repeated hearings and investigations, although there were multiple defendants, the existence of facts and evidence should be determined separately. In addition to separately prosecuting Teng Wensui and others, the reasons for those with insufficient suspicion are explained separately: (1) Wang Jue was handling the criminal case of Gao Wei. After the settlement, a relative from Jinan Town held Yu Liangcheng's name card, asking if this person had lobbied the court. Wang Jue was surprised and, considering he had not committed any illegal acts, initiated investigative procedures upon hearing of the official fraud allegations, immediately arresting Yu Liangcheng and questioning lawyer Teng to get to the bottom of the matter and fulfill his duties. However, Chief Prosecutor Wang Qing suggested leniency and repeatedly urged for Yu Liangcheng to be released on bail, which Wang Jue consistently refused. Unable to persist, he transferred the case to another officer and refused to accept illegal orders. With no evidence of criminal acts, there was no suspicion of dereliction of duty. (2) Xu Xuehai took over the Yu Liangcheng fraud case on the morning of November 15th. Wang Jue did not inform him of Wang Qing's suggestion, so he was unaware of the content. On the same day, Wang Qing ordered Xu Xuehai to release Yu Liangcheng on bail. Xu reviewed the case file and, finding no reason to disobey, released Yu Liangcheng on bail with a guarantee from Sanjia Dian to show his seriousness. "See record of this office on June 22nd." After the bail, Wang Qing said that Yu Liangcheng was a person who gets things done and should be dealt with quickly. Xu did not comply and soon left the court due to other matters, with no criminal suspicion to support the allegations. (3) Jiang Huazhen is Chief Wang Qing's cousin. Outsiders used her name to spread rumors about litigation, causing much discussion, but Wang Huazhen was unaware of this. This office is conducting a thorough investigation. Wang Qing presented a letter from Wang Huazhen interceding for Yu Liangcheng, but the letter was not stamped, and the handwriting did not match. Furthermore, the fake letter was mailed from the Hankou Post Office on November 13th of the previous year, as evidenced by the postmark. According to Wang Huazhen, she was in Nanjing in mid-November, helping her husband stamp and collect funds from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, presenting the receipt for proof. "The photo of the receipt is dated November 11th and attached to the file." This shows she was not in Hankou at the time, which is credible. Upon reviewing the forged letter, which used Wang Huazhen's name to intercede for Yu Liangcheng, and observing the defendant, she was confirmed to have no shared fraudulent intent and should not be discussed further. In conclusion, the criminal suspicion of defendants Wang Jue, Xu Xuehai, and Wang Huazhen is deemed insufficient. In accordance with Article 244, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision not to prosecute is hereby issued as right. Prosecutor Xiong Li, June 29th</p>

<p>Torrential Rains Cause Disaster, Villagers Report Famine: Continuous torrential rains in Suzhou recently have caused rivers to rise sharply. Low-lying areas in various townships have become watery regions. Villagers in places like Chefang, the East Mountain, and the West Mountain have already submitted petitions to the county government and the finance bureau in the past few days, reporting the disaster and requesting that officials be dispatched to the villages to survey the situation. The government and bureau have instructed them to make every effort to pump out the accumulated water in order to save the crops. However, the torrential rains have not stopped immediately, and only the early rice has been damaged. If the weather does not clear up soon, the late rice will also be unsalvageable.</p>

<p>Representatives of Fresh Meat Businesses from Various Counties Go to Beijing and the Province to Petition: Since the government implemented the elimination of "li" tax and the adoption of a business tax for the fresh meat industry throughout Jiangsu Province, petitions have been repeatedly submitted to the Ministry of Finance requesting the abolition of the original slaughter tax and the adoption of the business tax, and also requesting a clear date for the abolition. However, approval has not yet been granted. The industry associations from various counties recently sent representatives to Wuxi to gather and discuss the matter. It was decided that the representatives would go to the provincial capital to petition. Representatives from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Taixing, Shanghai, Kunshan, Wujin, Wuxi, Yizheng, Danyang and other counties were designated as representatives to petition the ministry and the province. They were requesting that, in accordance with the supplementary measures to the outline established by the ministry, after the implementation of the business tax law, the provisions for merging or abolishing the previous slaughter tax be implemented. At the same time, they will also go to the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office in Nanjing to petition, in order to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases Cracked, Stolen Goods Recovered: Xue Furui, the captain of the detective team of the County Public Security Bureau, received a tip-off a few days ago stating that multiple robbers involved in the robbery of the chief of Lengdu Township's house and the farmer Zhang Boguan's house in Houyangfang Qianqingshiqiao were hiding near the city. Captain Xue, upon receiving the report, immediately gathered all the detectives and arrested the suspects. He first arrested Hu Shijin and Gu A'er, both from Tongzhou, and recovered many stolen goods in Zhoushanbang. They confessed that there were still fugitives in the workshops outside the East Gate and under the Baqiao Bridge outside the West Gate. Captain Xue immediately dispatched officers to search separately. Xu Dexin was arrested in the workshop outside the East Gate, and Zhang Xianda was arrested in the Hongfuyuan teahouse outside the West Gate. All were sent to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The robbers all confessed to robbing the Miao and Zhang families and distributing the stolen goods. They were ordered to be detained pending transfer to the County Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Battalion Commander Clash with Finance Bureau Chief Over Disbursement: The expenses of the Jiangsu Provincial Pacification and Security Force are assigned to this county, which is responsible for 5,000 yuan per month. The Jiangci Group sends personnel to Changshu to collect the funds on a monthly basis. Since the arrival of the Second Battalion of the First Regiment to reside in our county, the head of the Zhu Chumin militia has obtained approval from the Security Office to directly allocate the 5,000 yuan that the county's Finance Bureau is responsible for to the Second Battalion as military pay. Previously, when Head Zhu came to Changshu on orders to investigate the Hupu bandit case, he had discussed the matter with Zhuang Yeguang, the head of the county's Finance Bureau, urging him to quickly allocate 2,000 yuan for food expenses. It was agreed to pay in two installments. The 18th was the date for the first payment. Shen Yiming, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the garrison, took the payment voucher from the regimental headquarters to the Finance Bureau and met with Bureau Chief Zhuang Yeguang. To his surprise, Zhuang did not honor the agreement regarding the military expenses, claiming that there were no funds available at the time. Battalion Commander Shen said that the expenses were for the soldiers' food and could not be delayed. Moreover, it was a previously agreed date. If the food supply was cut off, who would be responsible? At that time, the head of the Finance Bureau continued to prevaricate and even retorted. As a result, Battalion Commander Shen became furious and severely reprimanded him. (It is said that he slapped Zhuang twice.) Subsequently, Shen and Zhuang went to the county government to report everything to the county magistrate. Fortunately, Magistrate Tan did his best to mediate and promised to allocate 800 yuan in silver to meet the urgent need by the 20th of this month. The matter was then settled.</p>

<p>Li Leng Case, Non-Prosecution Disposition: The former county magistrate, Li Leng, was investigated by Shi Zechen, dispatched by the High Court, for an opium bribery case. He was handed over to the Wuxian District Court for interrogation. This had been done three times. On the 19th, according to news from Suzhou, the local procuratorate issued a non-prosecution disposition for the Li Leng case.</p>
<p>A Corpse Case Turns into a Farce: The red boat of the North Wai Yidu Bureau salvaged an unidentified female corpse from the river a few days ago. At that time, Hong, the concubine of Shen Huaigui, the owner of the Dayichun store, had been missing for several days. People such as Zhu Jinru suspected that the female corpse was Shen's concubine, so Huaigui went to identify the body. The face of the female corpse had already decomposed. Because the clothes and shape were not right, he did not recognize her. Subsequently, the county government sent an examining officer to verify the body. The Shen family also sent people to Shizhuang, Rugao, to the home of Hong's mother to inquire about news. To their surprise, Hong and her four-year-old daughter were safely at home. Because the main wife did not tolerate her, she had not returned home. After reporting back to Cheng, the doubts of the public were difficult to resolve. Even Magistrate Peng did not fully believe it. On the 19th, he summoned Shen Huaigui, ordering him to hand over Hong within three days. The reporter also found this matter strange and personally visited Shizhuang a few days ago to investigate. He indeed saw Hong and her daughter safely at home. However, a corpse case has already caused a sensation throughout the city.</p>

<p>Robbers in the Northeast Township Rob and Injure People: The home of Pan Xiaoyu, a farmer in Panjia Village, Henan, Lingkou, in the Eastern Township, was suddenly broken into at 11 p.m. last night by several robbers speaking in mixed dialects and wielding guns. They extensively searched the house, twisted Xiaoyu, and forced him to hand over cash, burning him with fire. When nearby villagers sounded gongs and shouted for help, the robbers scattered and fled. The home of Mo Jinsheng in Mojia Village in the Northern Township was also broken into by several robbers who forced their way inside and searched the house. Jinsheng was severely burned with fire and may not survive. The case has now been reported and police have been asked to apprehend the robbers.</p>
<p>Robbers Posing as Transport Personnel Arrested: The home of Wu Yaogui in Dengjia Village in the Eastern Township was robbed some days ago, suffering heavy losses. Sima Shusheng, a key criminal in the case, suddenly joined the conscription office of the garrison police stationed in Danyang as a transport personnel in order to avoid being noticed after receiving his share of the stolen goods. This was discovered by the county's detective team, which reported the information to the County Public Security Bureau, who prepared a document and sent personnel to the garrison police to bring Sima Shusheng in for interrogation.</p>
<p>Multiple Drownings at Dengjia Bridge: Due to continuous heavy rain in recent days, the river at Dengjia Bridge in the Eastern Township has risen sharply. The wooden structure of the bridge has been washed away by the water. The local people, in order to facilitate transportation, have set up a wooden raft to provide passage. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, seven male and female passengers boarded the raft and started towards the center of the river. The stern of the boat suddenly leaked, causing panic among the passengers, which led to the wooden raft falling apart. All fell into the water. Only Ding Shigeng, a blind man, managed to climb ashore and escape. The rest drowned. It was truly tragic.</p>

<p>Finance and Agriculture Bureaus Thoroughly Investigate Hemp Gum Tax: The Finance and Agriculture and Mining Bureaus have repeatedly received petitions from coastal fishermen in the Jiangbei, Tong, and Ru counties, accusing Liu Xiaoshu and others of illegally collecting hemp gum tax, with annual revenues of more than 2,000 yuan. This tax was originally required for the green camp troops stationed along the coast during the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi era, with hemp used by soldiers to weave shoes and glue used for arrows. It has continued to this day without being abolished. The Finance Bureau has dispatched Inspector Yuan Chengzen, and the Agriculture and Mining Bureau has appointed Shen Susheng to come to Tong and then go to Juegang and Fengli to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Disputes Over Converting Copper Coins into Silver Dollars: The public funds for education and charity in Tongyi have always been deposited in money shops for interest. In the past, everything was calculated in copper coins. In recent years, disputes have arisen over the conversion to copper dollars. The county government has specially petitioned the High Court for resolution.</p>
<p>Yu Shenshou Case, Complaint Withdrawn: After Yu Jue and Zhang Xiaoruo reached a settlement in the Yu Shenshou case, the civil court of the Nantong County Court has approved Yu Jue's withdrawal of the complaint against Zhang. The Nantong County Government also reported the situation to the provincial government on the 20th to close the case. However, the tomb of Ms. Yu Shenshou is located under Huangni Mountain. Currently, the riverbank is collapsing severely, and the tomb is getting closer to the river, making it difficult to avoid being washed away.</p>

<p>Trial Involves Suspicions of Bribery: Gaogang in Jingjiang County has always been an area rife with smuggling. A large amount of opium was discovered there a month ago. The military police investigated the case, and the involved parties abandoned the opium in the river. Wei Sanguan recovered it and was arrested by the county government. The judgment was hasty and involved suspicions of bribery. The matter was learned by Liu Zhenzhi, a local, who filed a complaint with the High Court, stating that County Magistrate Wang Jiwu and Public Security Bureau Chief Jin Ming'an were suspected of shielding the guilty. After receiving the complaint, Dean Lin secretly ordered a thorough investigation. Finding that there was cause for the investigation, he sent the case to the Zhenjiang Court for interrogation. After receiving the order, the court studied the case and issued 15 summons yesterday, scheduling a hearing for 8 a.m. on the 24th to investigate. Those summoned were Wang Jiwu, the County Magistrate of Jingjiang, and Liang Wei, Huang Weibang, Yao Zhusan, Xu Ming'en, Chen Chao, Lu Zhuoqun, Wang Jiadian, Lu Haoran, Liu Zancheng, Zhu Boyu, Du Zhihe, Zhu Zhongyi, Wan Tianyi, who handled the case, and the plaintiff Liu Zhenzhi.</p>

<p>The Battle Between Soldiers and Bandits at Yugou: Due to local bandits demanding an exorbitant sum of 20,000 yuan in taxes in Yugou Town, Huaiyin Fourth District, all the merchants and residents of the town fled. On the 14th of this month, more than 100 representatives, including Wu Qiqing, Luo Zhaolun, Gao Zixi, and Zheng Heting, came to the city to petition. Liang, the commander of the 25th Route, sent Battalion Commander Kong of the First Regiment of the Independent Brigade with two squads of soldiers to defend and suppress the bandits on the 15th. They arrived at 11 a.m. today. At that time, the town's militia and bandits were engaged in a firefight at Zhuzhuang to the east of Langshi. Battalion Commander Kong immediately led his troops there. Unexpectedly, the bandits occupied the houses and fired out, showing no fear. Kong ordered his troops to throw a hand grenade, setting the houses on fire. The bandits then fled outward. As a result, one member of the defense force was killed, and two soldiers of Battalion Commander Kong were wounded. Two bandits were killed, and two bandits were captured alive. In the afternoon at 7 p.m., the government troops returned to the Yugou Fortress to rest. On the morning of the 16th, Battalion Commander Kong was ordered to return to Yangzhuang for inspection. However, the people of Yugou were still uneasy. Therefore, yesterday (the 16th) morning, more than 400 people came to the city to petition again.</p>

Upon seeing the two bandits standing on the East Bridge, they ordered the silk boat to stop. The boat owner saw that the bandits had weapons and had to dock.

The bandits were still not satisfied and wanted to take the silk. After repeated pleas from the passengers, the bandits took three carts of silk, went ashore, and left.</p>

<p>Bandit Den Discovered at the Border of Three Counties: In recent years, Qinghua, Tuokou, Hongyuan, Sikou, Gutan, and other places in Wuyuan have been repeatedly robbed by bandits. It is heard that the bandit den is about ten li in size, with place names like Zunli (Jar Inside), Pingli (Bottle Inside), and Wengli (Urn Inside). Mountain sheds are built wherever the mountain terrain is slightly flat. Going from the Tunkengwu of Xiuning Meixi, the three mountain sheds have several hundred families about thirty li away. Initially, the bandits were kiln workers from various provinces, but later, old mountain farmers joined them. After plundering their fill, they all returned to Zunli and dispersed to their respective sheds. When the stolen silver ran out, they would go out to rob again. Recently, Xing, the head of the zoning self-defense group of Qimen County, led a team and more than a hundred hunters to suppress the bandits. However, the bandits outnumber us, and it is feared that victory is uncertain.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Dr. Cai Le-sheng Returns to China and Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>▲Former Professor at the University of Chicago in the United States</p>
<p>▲Now Appointed by the National Central Research Institute</p>
<p>▲Included in the Who's Who in American Science</p>
<p>Dr. Cai Le-sheng, a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School in the United States, is a leading figure in modern psychology. At the World Psychology Conference held in the United States two years ago, he was uniquely invited to present a formal paper, which brought great honor to the academic community in our country. After Dr. Cai obtained his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1928, he was immediately hired as a professor at the Graduate School, pioneering the path for Chinese scholars to serve as science professors at famous European and American universities. At that time, an American industrial magnate donated eight million US dollars, specifically allocated for medical psychology research. Dr. Cai was appointed as the director of this research project. Under his guidance, five American scholars assisted him in his research day and night. In recent years, the results have been very good. In addition to reporting them in European and American psychology journals, most of the results have been published in the most famous American "Science" magazine in the scientific community. Dr. Cai discovered that the level of intelligence is directly proportional to the amount of a certain vitamin received in the mother's womb and during breastfeeding. Since ancient times, our country has strongly advocated prenatal education. Now, Dr. Cai has proven it using scientific methods, opening a new era in modern education. The Illinois State Government in the United States, in view of the great contribution of this research, specially sent technicians to make a moving picture of Dr. Cai's experiments and show it in various villages and cities. At the same time, the Chicago Tribune, the New York Times, and the London Times in the United Kingdom all provided powerful introductions. Recently, the Who's Who in American Science included Dr. Cai's name and biographical sketch, treating him as an American celebrity. Dr. Cai was quite averse to this. The National Central Research Institute sent letters and telegrams one after another, urging Dr. Cai to return to China to serve the country, so as to avoid employing talents from Chu in Jin. Dr. Cai agreed generously, resigned from his position in the United States, went to Europe for inspection, and then returned to China by ship. It is reported that he has now arrived in Shanghai.</p>

<p>| 26 to 19 |</p>
<p>| The Red Light Team Plays Tonight |</p>
<p>Greatly satisfying, in last night's fourth game of the Japanese Shanghai College of Commerce basketball team, the Fudan United team won a resounding victory of twenty-six to nineteen, and everyone was beaming with joy. The referee was Shao Ji.</p>
<p>▲ Superior Technique. The Fudan United team, a joint team from Fudan University, won last night entirely due to its superior technique and seamless coordination, which was dazzling to watch. The three forwards, Mo, Guo, and Lu, skillfully shot through the basket and net, scoring at will. The Japanese team's two coaches, Ueda and Ohashi, both joined the game, otherwise the result would have been even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>▲ Irresistible Momentum. After the score was seven to six in favor of the Japanese team, their performance declined sharply, while the Fudan United team soared upwards. In the first half, the Shanghai College of Commerce only managed to score one point for every six points scored by the Fudan United team, resulting in a score of twelve to seven. In the second half, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the two coaches of the Shanghai College of Commerce joined the battle, but the Fudan United team continued to win, reaching twenty-four to fourteen. At this point, the Shanghai College of Commerce caught up by four points, and Guo Zhihong scored two more points with a clean shot. Near the end, Guo committed his fourth foul and was ejected from the game. The Fudan United team won with a score of twenty-six to nineteen.</p>
<p>▲ The Red Light Team Takes the Field. Tonight, the mixed team of the Qingguang Red team will take the field to play against the Shanghai College of Commerce. The game will start at eight o'clock in the basketball hall.</p>

<h3 id="e104">After the Telegram to Confiscate Goods, Japanese Goods Are Gradually Affected <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>▲ Telegrams from Ningbo and Other Places to Stop Loading</p>
<p>▲ Dongtang Implements Suspension of Sales</p>
<p>▲ Shandong Business Community Sends Letter Requesting Attention</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Society resolved to implement economic severance with Japan and announced measures for dealing with Japanese goods, merchants from various places took advantage of the fact that inspections had not yet been implemented and purchased large quantities of Japanese goods, resulting in the complete sale of Japanese goods stored in various warehouses in Shanghai. General merchants urgently telegraphed Japan to rush shipments to Shanghai, but it was still not enough to meet demand. The market price of Japanese goods rose sharply, and merchants rushed to buy them. Domestic goods also sold well as a result. The number of Japanese goods exported was unprecedented in recent times. Since the Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Society telegraphed party departments and organizations in various provinces and cities on the 20th to implement the confiscation of Japanese goods and began inspections in Shanghai, the people in various places were greatly aroused upon hearing the news. Therefore, starting yesterday, merchants from various places felt apprehensive, fearing that their goods would be confiscated and punished when they arrived inland, so they stopped purchasing Japanese goods. The situation in various places yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Rushing Shipments for Ten Days. All sectors are taking a firm stance in boycotting Japanese goods. However, in order to allow business groups from various places to clear out their previous inventory, they were allowed to clear shipments within these ten days, from the 13th to the 23rd. Therefore, the amount of goods shipped out in recent days has been extremely high. Now that the deadline is approaching, starting yesterday, even more Japanese goods were reported by the Changjiang business group, and the ship ticket offices of various shipping companies were working overnight. Exports from various ships were also delayed by up to twelve hours due to the congestion of goods. The value of goods reported yesterday was even higher than the day before. The various ships were unable to accommodate the volume, and many shipments were rejected. The piers were especially full of kelp. All shipments must be cleared by the 23rd.</p>
<p>▲ Deadline for Suspension of Shipments. Starting on the 24th, ships on the Yangtze River and coastal routes in this port will completely stop loading Japanese goods. According to various shipping companies, no less than one million yuan worth of Japanese goods have been shipped out of Shanghai from the 14th to the present. Today and tomorrow are the last days for shipments. Starting on the 24th, British, Japanese, and American ships in this port will also refuse to accept Japanese goods reported for shipment by Chinese merchants. However, they will still transport goods reported by Japanese customs brokers. Starting on Friday, committees will be assigned to inspect Japanese goods at the piers of various shipping companies to prevent further smuggling and private shipments.</p>
<p>▲ Telegrams to Stop Shipments. Ningbo, Jiaxing, Linghu, and other places have started to prepare for strict inspection of Japanese goods at docks and stations after receiving information from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Society. It is reported that the transshipment industry in this port received telegrams from the three places yesterday, instructing them to stop shipping goods there, especially in Ningbo, where the efforts are most intense. It is expected that Japanese exports will gradually decrease starting today.</p>
<p>▲ Dongtang Suspends the Market. The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association yesterday notified its members: "Regarding the resolution of the general meeting on July 20 concerning the measures for dealing with arriving and not-yet-arrived Japanese sugar due to the economic severance with Japan, as follows: (1) Resolved, the measures for dealing with arriving and not-yet-arrived Japanese sugar: Resolved, already-arrived Dongtang sugar will be refused acceptance starting today. Orders for goods that have not yet arrived will follow the same actions as other businesses dealing in Japanese goods. (2) Resolved, suspension of Dongtang sugar trading in the market: Resolved, starting from the 20th of this month, Dongtang sugar trading will be suspended in the market and announced in the market." Therefore, Japanese sugar has been absent from the market since yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Letter Requesting Attention. The Preparatory Office of the Shandong Business Community Joint Association in Shanghai writes: "To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Society: According to our investigation, some traitorous merchants are taking advantage of the nationwide anti-Japanese movement and economic severance to engage in speculative and traitorous business. After your society announced the measures for dealing with Japanese goods, these merchants not only did not reject Japanese goods, but increased shipments; they not only did not return goods, but increased orders. Our enthusiastic compatriots are creating opportunities for traitorous merchants. On the surface, it is a boycott, but in reality, it is promoting Japanese goods. Inferior goods are selling well, and the fault lies with our own people. We hope that your society will pay attention to this and find ways to strictly stop it, so as not to let down the patriotic enthusiasm of all sectors. We await your response with great anticipation."</p>
<p>▲ Business Community Expresses Itself. The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation yesterday sent a letter to various factories stating: "All sectors in this city are angered by the instigation of Koreans by the Japanese to discriminate against Chinese and massacre overseas Chinese, and have formed an Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Society. The society has resolved to implement economic severance with Japan and has formally issued four measures for dealing with Japanese goods. Some of the raw materials usually needed by various factories are Japanese goods. We hope that you will list the names of these materials so that we can study them and replace them with domestic goods." (Remainder omitted). (1) The 8th Branch of the Special District Citizen Federation held its second executive committee meeting the afternoon before yesterday at 8:00 PM. The chairman was Chen Chuanmao. The resolutions were: (1) Regarding the Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese issue, a notice will be issued to the citizens of this district today, the 23rd of this month, to close business for half a day and fly flags at half-mast to commemorate the deceased. (2) Act according to conscience, do not purchase Japanese goods, prepare for economic severance, and persist to the end. (3) Those who have purchased Japanese goods should first register with the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Society and temporarily suspend sales. (4) Those who secretly purchase Japanese goods again with the intention of making exorbitant profits will be severely punished. (5) To expand and promote the realization of residency rights, a letter should be sent to the Citizen Federation to proceed quickly.</p>

<p>▲ Business Closed for Half a Day and Flags Flown at Half-Mast</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Society has scheduled a memorial service for the overseas Chinese who perished in Korea on the morning of the 23rd of this month at 9:00 AM at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The committee members will also be sworn into office. All procedures are being prepared these days. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Banks and Money Exchanges Close. The Shanghai Banking Association yesterday notified all member banks to close for half a day tomorrow morning to express their condolences. It is reported that the Money Exchange Association has also notified its members to do the same.</p>
<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce Notice. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday announced that all industries in the city will close for half a day tomorrow morning to express their condolences. Business will resume as usual in the afternoon, and shops will fly flags at half-mast for one day. It is reported that the Anti-Japanese Society has also printed several types of slogans for closing business and expressing condolences, which will be distributed to shops throughout the city to be posted.</p>
<p>▲ Citizen Groups. The Special District Citizen Federation and the Taxpayers' Association of the two concessions both issued notices yesterday (omitted for brevity) stating that in order to mourn the deceased overseas Chinese, a memorial service will be held on the morning of the 23rd of this month. All citizens should fly flags at half-mast and close business for half a day to express their condolences.</p>
<p>▲ Labor Union Side. The Municipal Party Department's People's Training Committee issued Notice No. 4608 yesterday, notifying all labor unions in the city to close business for half a day tomorrow morning to express their condolences. It is reported that the labor unions have informed the workers of various factories.</p>
<h3 id="e106">American Soldiers Sentenced for Assault <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>▲ Munn Sentenced to Two and a Half Years in Prison</p>
<p>▲ Daniel Sentenced to Two Years in Prison</p>
<p>Corporal Munn, Private Daniel, and Private Kinna, all American soldiers, assaulted and stabbed sewing worker Ma Chengbu and Ju Shixiang at the intersection of Avenue Road and Seymour Road on May 36. Earlier this month, the American military authorities organized a military court to conduct a joint trial. The results of the trial were submitted to Admiral McVay, Commander of the US Far East Fleet, for approval. The US military headquarters on Haifang Road has now received Admiral McVay's reply and announced the sentences yesterday morning: (1) Corporal Munn is sentenced to thirty months of imprisonment for misconduct and will be transferred to the barracks in the Philippines for confinement and hard labor. After serving his term, he will be discharged and deprived of all civil rights. (2) Private Daniel is sentenced to twenty-four months of imprisonment for drunkenness and assault, which damaged military discipline, and will also be sent to the barracks in the Philippines for confinement and hard labor. After serving his term, he will be discharged. (3) Private Kinna was acquitted.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Case of a Western Constable Shooting a Chinese Policeman on Haig Road <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Government Continues to Negotiate with the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Since the case of a Western constable shooting a Chinese policeman on Haig Road occurred, the Municipal Government, through Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, has been in serious negotiations with the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council sent a letter to Secretary-General Yu on July 3, stating that the case had been handed over to the Police Committee for urgent special consideration. However, as a result, the Municipal Council only agreed to pay the injured Chinese policeman's hospital expenses and disability compensation. There was no clear indication regarding the punishment of the perpetrator, an apology, or a guarantee. Therefore, Secretary-General Yu sent a letter to Mr. Feith, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, yesterday to continue the protest. The two most recent letters between Secretary-General Yu and Director-General Feith of the Municipal Council are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Director-General Feith's Letter to Secretary-General Yu. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 23rd of this month regarding the case of a Chinese policeman being shot on Haig Road, I invite your consideration. The case has been considered in detail by the Police Committee of the Municipal Council at a special meeting held on the 8th of this month. Yesterday, the report of the meeting was also discussed at the Board of Directors meeting. After careful consideration from all aspects, the Board of Directors decided as follows: (1) The incident occurred at No. 858 Haig Road. The house faces Haig Road, and access to the house is only possible from that road. Therefore, the Municipal Council's police entry was not inappropriate, especially since they were acting on the request of the lady of the house. (2) Although the evidence on how the incident occurred is contradictory, the Board of Directors believes that if the Chinese policeman had not drawn his gun at the time, the incident could have been avoided. (3) The incident might not have occurred if senior and experienced police officers had been dispatched to the scene. Regarding the third point above, the Municipal Council has considered it and has informed the police department in writing that in order to avoid similar situations from happening in the future, senior and experienced police officers must be dispatched to the extra-settlement roads. We hope that your government will also instruct your Public Security Bureau to take similar measures. In view of the various circumstances, the Municipal Council is willing to pay the injured Chinese policeman's hospital expenses and, if he suffers permanent disability, to provide compensation based on a report, without affecting the Municipal Council's position and denying that the actions of the Municipal Council's police officers were inappropriate. I am sending you this letter to inform you of the handling of the matter and ask you to investigate. Sincerely, Feith, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>▲ Secretary-General Yu's Reply to Director-General Feith. Sir, In response to your letter of July 16, regarding the case of a British police officer of your council shooting a Chinese policeman on Haig Road, the Director-General of this government is instructed to reply as follows: (1) The house where the incident occurred is located outside the scope of the extra-settlement road. The police powers exercised by your council on the extra-settlement road are legally unfounded, and in fact, Chinese authorities have never recognized them and have repeatedly protested them. Moreover, the house is located outside the scope of the extra-settlement road, making your council's actions even more unwarranted. Your council's police officer disregarded Chinese sovereignty and acted recklessly, causing the trouble. It is regrettable that your council's superior police officers did not stop him beforehand. Afterwards, it is even more surprising that your board of directors condoned and covered up his actions. As for the claim that access to the house is only possible from the extra-settlement road, which is used as a reason for your police officer to exercise his duties outside the extra-settlement road, I do not know what basis it has. The request of the American woman was inappropriate, and it was even more inappropriate for your council's police officer to accept this extra-jurisdictional matter. The principle is very simple. (2) Your board of directors, on the one hand, admits that the evidence from both sides is contradictory, and on the other hand, speculates that the shooting incident would not have occurred if the Chinese policeman had not drawn his gun. This attitude is regrettable. If the Chinese policeman drew his gun when he did not need to, would he not have retaliated when he was under violent oppression? The injured wrist was the right wrist, and there is evidence that the gun had already fallen to the ground if he had been holding it in his hand, but none of the witnesses mentioned this. Your board of directors may not have noticed this. Even if we take a step back and assume that the police officer did see the Chinese policeman holding a gun, should he have immediately opened fire, firing again after missing the first shot? Does this situation meet the legal requirements for legitimate self-defense? All of these are things that your council should sincerely consider. (3) Your board of directors stated that the incident might have been avoided if senior and experienced police officers had been present at the time, so they proposed that both sides order senior and experienced police officers to be in charge when similar situations occur on the extra-settlement roads. While this government does not want similar incidents to happen again, with regard to the police administration issues on the extra-settlement roads, in addition to reiterating that it is not within the purview of any of your council's police officers to interfere, it has already instructed the responsible bureau to strictly warn its members to handle all matters with caution. (4) Regarding the board of directors' willingness to pay the injured police officer's medical expenses and disability compensation, this government originally requested compensation for damages. It cannot but express its admiration for the spirit of this proposal by your board of directors. However, what must be solemnly stated is that what this government is requesting is a claim for fairness and justice, not just compensation for material losses. Based on the above points, this government hopes that the board of directors will reconsider the matter and provide a satisfactory response to the previous letter's request for punishing the perpetrator, compensation, an apology, and a guarantee, so as to demonstrate fairness and maintain good relations. Please reply accordingly. Sincerely, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Navigation Administration Bureau Officially Takes Over the Customs Agency Authority Today <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>▲ Eight Technicians Appointed as Inspectors and Measurers</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau was established on the first of this month, it immediately proceeded to take over the authority for ship inspection, ship measurement, and ship registration, which was previously handled by the Customs on its behalf. Director Xi Dingmo and Jianghai Customs Commissioner Merrell negotiated several times, and an agreement was reached yesterday. The official takeover is scheduled for today. The events leading up to this are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Successful Negotiations. The Ministry of Communications previously ordered the Navigation Administration Bureau, instructing Director Xi to go to Jianghai Customs to discuss the issue of taking over the agency authority. Later, the Customs responded that they had not yet received the official notice from the Ministry of Communications relayed by the Ministry of Finance, so it was inconvenient to hand over the authority, resulting in a delay. Recently, the bureau received another order from the Ministry of Communications, instructing them to go to the Customs to negotiate. After receiving the order, Director Xi went to the Customs to discuss with Commissioner Merrell, and an agreement was reached yesterday. It was agreed that the authority would be handed over today.</p>
<p>▲ Handover Situation. Today is the official handover date. Jianghai Customs completed all procedures yesterday. Today, they will hand over the files and documents to the Navigation Administration Bureau. The bureau's ship licenses and permits were issued by the Ministry of Communications and will be used from today onwards. However, the equipment for measuring ships, such as the measuring instruments and measuring rulers, are not yet complete, so the Customs will also hand over all the sophisticated instruments to the Navigation Administration Bureau.</p>
<p>▲ Taking Over Officials. The officials taking over the Customs agency authority were appointed yesterday. Zhu Tiankui, Director of the Technical Department, and technicians Huang Shaoqi, Cao Shoulian, Zhou Houkun, Meng Muzhuang, Zou Jiyun, Ding Yanling, and Xu Shipu, will be responsible for inspection and measurement matters. The registration of ships will be handled by the staff of the registration section of the Second Division.</p>
<p>▲ Customs Officials Assist. Because the bureau is just starting to take over, it is not familiar with previous ship matters. For example, in the ship inspection process, the Customs inspection is carried out step by step, so it often takes several days to complete the inspection of a ship. This time, with the takeover, there may be ships that have not yet completed the Customs inspection, and the Navigation Administration Bureau will have to continue the inspection. Therefore, the Customs has specially sent two foreigners to the bureau to assist in handling all unfinished matters. The two foreigners are named Leons and McIntyre, and they are expected to serve for about two or three months.</p>
<p>▲ Procedures and Fees. Mr. Yao Zhaozhi, the Secretary of the bureau, told a Riri News reporter that the handling fees for ship measurement are very low, more than twice as low as the fees charged by Jianghai Customs. The fee structure is as follows: Ships with a gross tonnage of 20 tons or more but less than 50 tons will be charged 20 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 50 tons or more but less than 100 tons will be charged 30 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 100 tons or more but less than 300 tons will be charged 40 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 300 tons or more but less than 500 tons will be charged 50 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 500 tons or more but less than 1,000 tons will be charged 60 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 1,000 tons or more but less than 2,000 tons will be charged 80 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 2,000 tons or more but less than 3,000 tons will be charged 100 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 3,000 tons or more but less than 4,000 tons will be charged 120 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 4,000 tons or more but less than 6,000 tons will be charged 140 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 6,000 tons or more but less than 8,000 tons will be charged 160 yuan. Ships with a gross tonnage of 8,000 tons or more but less than 10,000 tons will be charged 180 yuan. For ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000 tons, an additional 20 yuan will be charged for every 2,000 tons. If the remaining tonnage is less than 2,000 tons, it will be calculated as 2,000 tons. For ships whose capacity is expressed in dan, 10 dan will be calculated as 1 ton.</p>
<p>▲ Navigation Bureau Announcement. The Navigation Administration Bureau will issue an announcement today stating: "This bureau has now transferred from Jianghai Customs and taken over the inspection and measurement of Chinese and foreign ships. Within the areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Chinese and foreign ships that are required to be inspected, measured, registered, and issued licenses should come to the bureau immediately to complete the procedures according to law. This is hereby announced for your information." This announcement.</p>

<p>▲ Du Yuesheng and Others Elected as Chairman</p>
<p>▲ Xu Xiuting and Others Elected as Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association held its election of chairman and committee members, as well as standing committee members, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The vote count resulted in Du Yuesheng and two others being elected as chairman, and Xu Xiuting and four others being elected as standing committee members.

<p>▲ Meeting Details  Fourteen committee members attended yesterday's meeting, including Du Yuesheng, Shang Mujiang, Cheng Zhusun, Dai Chunfeng, Pan Zhaobang, Tao Leqin, Long Jingyan, Xu Xiuting, Zhu Shengmao, Zhai Zhenhua, Dong Kechang, Bei Zairong, Tong Lizhang, and Li Weiliang.

<h3 id="e110">China Merchants Bureau Applies for Yangtze Wharf Permit <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sending Representatives to the Ministry of Communications for Discussions</p>
<p>The Yangtze Wharf, after being sealed by the Ministry of Communications committee, together with the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and subsequently recovered by our country, was previously purchased by the China Merchants Bureau. It is now said that it has been transferred from the Ocean Society. Due to property rights issues, the Bureau plans to apply to the Ministry of Communications for a permit. Details of the meeting and measures are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Long-term Occupation by Japanese Merchants  During the European War, the Yangtze Wharf was confiscated from German merchants by our country. The land and property were purchased by the China Merchants Bureau from the Ministry of Communications. However, it was leased to the Japanese Ocean Society, preventing the Bureau from taking over. During the first rent arrears negotiation, the China Merchants Bureau approached the Ocean Society to take over the wharf, but the Japanese stubbornly refused to hand it over. After the National Government took over the China Merchants Bureau, it also negotiated with the Japanese to request the return of the wharf, but the Japanese still occupied it without yielding. Although the China Merchants Bureau repeatedly petitioned the Ministry to strive for its return, it was ultimately ineffective, and the matter has been delayed for many years.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting for Permit  This time, after the Ministry of Communications sealed the wharf and recovered it, and revoked the Japanese merchants' lease rights, the China Merchants Bureau held a special meeting, chaired by Guo Waifeng, with the attendance of all department heads and secretaries. Commissioner Guo presented this case, stating that the Yangtze Wharf property had been purchased by the Bureau long ago, but it had not been recovered due to the Japanese occupation. Now that the Ministry of Communications has sealed the wharf, if the Ministry leases it to others, it will be detrimental to the Bureau's property rights. He asked how to reclaim it for the Bureau's own use and requested a public decision.</p>
<p>▲ Sending Representatives to Request  After discussions among the attending department heads and secretaries, it was agreed that this matter should be handled according to property rights, and an application should be made to the Ministry of Communications for a permit. The measures were divided into two steps: (1) The Bureau should first submit a report to the Ministry of Communications, stating that the wharf was purchased by the Bureau and the past negotiations with the Japanese merchants, requesting the Ministry to return the Yangtze Wharf to the Bureau for management; (2) The Bureau should send a commissioner with the case files to the Ministry of Communications to discuss with the Minister and request a permit. It is said that this method will be followed, and a written report will be submitted to the Ministry first, seeking approval.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Ministry of Finance Reduces Unified Tax on Waste Yarn <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲ Six Jiao Per Hundred Jin Based on Waste Cotton Tax Rate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Industrial and Commercial Association Tax Rules Research Committee received a reply from the Ministry of Finance No. 13312 yesterday. A submitted document requested exemption from the waste yarn tax to maintain the established case and alleviate merchants' difficulties. After investigation, since waste yarn is still yarn with considerable use and value, it should be subject to unified tax. However, considering the varying qualities and prices of this type of waste cotton yarn, it is difficult to assess the price separately for each batch. Therefore, it is provisionally approved to handle it flexibly, and it is generously stipulated that a unified tax of six jiao be levied on 100 jin of waste cotton yarn, which is equivalent to the customs duty rate on waste cotton. This fully demonstrates the intention to alleviate merchants' difficulties. It is hoped that all yarn merchants will be notified to comply with the payment and avoid further doubts. This is the earnest hope of the ministry.</p>

<p>▲ Decided to Re-Investigate by Chamber of Commerce First</p>
<p>The case of the National Products Market was discussed yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, when the Municipal Government summoned representatives of the market to the Municipal Government for questioning. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun met with them and, as a result of consultations, it was decided that the amount of market losses would be re-investigated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce before further action was taken.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Japanese Merchants Boycott Chinese Hemp Cloth Sales in Korea <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>▲ Extra Attention Should be Paid</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the local cloth and rough cloth trade associations regarding the Japanese merchants' boycott of Chinese hemp cloth sales in Korea. The letter stated that the Ministry of Industry instructed [the chamber], "Instructing officials, approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to the consul stationed in Sinuiju, the clothing of the Korean people still retains the legacy of the Ming Dynasty in our country. Common people admire white and love to use hemp cloth. The number of consumptions each year is worth about 16 million Japanese yen. Among them, local Korean hemp cloth accounts for about 59 percent of the total, worth more than 9.3 million Japanese yen. The hemp cloth imported from our country accounts for about 34 percent of the total, worth more than 5.9 million Japanese yen, which is a large amount. The Japanese are thinking about boycotting this. Now, the Korean Weaving Association is paying great attention to this matter. On the one hand, it guides farmers and promotes hemp planting, intending to increase production. On the other hand, it encourages the government to double the tariffs, intending to reduce imports. However, the doubling of tariffs is restricted by treaties between the two countries, so there is no need to worry. However, the promotion of hemp planting and increased production is the key to pushing out foreign goods. It should not be underestimated. If the manufacturers and sellers of hemp cloth for sale in Korea do not pay close attention to the quality, value, size, and subtleties of hemp cloth, it will inevitably be boycotted and reduced year by year. Two clippings are attached. Please verify and forward them, etc. Correspond, after checking the original newspaper clipping sent, to consult and forward the contents, extract translations, and instruct domestic hemp cloth merchants to be informed. This order, etc." In response to this, the export value of hemp cloth in our country is very large. At this time of fierce commercial competition, extra attention should be paid to the inherent national products of China, and efforts should be made to improve them in order to promote them. Corresponding translations are attached, hoping that you will check and forward them.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Shanghai Finance Bureau Announces Measures for Collecting Donations and Small Silver Coin Surcharges <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the city has a vast area and exchange rates for silver dollars vary from time to time. It is always difficult to obtain appropriate standards for collecting donations and funds. Therefore, nine official articles have been formally established to limit small silver coin surcharges, hoping to achieve consistency in income and expenditure and to demonstrate fairness. It has already been approved by the Municipal Government for promulgation. The measures are excerpted below:</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau Measures for Limiting Small Silver Coin Surcharges   Article 1: The collection personnel of the Bureau's affiliated agencies shall handle the collection of various donations and taxes, the payment of small silver coin surcharges, and the discount of copper coins in accordance with the following articles, and shall not arbitrarily change them. Article 2: The standard exchange rates for small silver coins and copper coins are stipulated as follows: (A) 300 copper coins are equivalent to one silver dollar (3 copper coins are equivalent to one cent of a silver dollar). (B) 12 jiao of small silver coins are equivalent to one silver dollar. (C) 1 jiao of small silver coins plus 5 copper coins are equivalent to 1 jiao of a silver dollar. Article 3: Those whose donations and taxes are more than one silver dollar shall pay in silver dollars. Article 4: If the total amount of donations and taxes or the odd amount is more than five jiao and one cent, it can be paid in silver dollars, and the collector shall return the balance in accordance with Article 2. Article 5: If the total amount of donations and taxes or the odd amount is less than five jiao, small silver coins shall be paid, and surcharges shall be paid according to the number in accordance with Article 2. Article 6: If the number of jiao to be collected is paid in silver dollar subsidiary coins, it shall not be restricted by Articles 4 and 5 of these measures. Article 7: If the Bureau's collection personnel do not comply with the provisions of these measures and engage in excessive collection and extortion, the donors may report it to the Bureau for investigation and punishment. Article 8: If the market price has special rises and falls, and a new standard price must be set, the items in Article 2 may be revised and announced. Article 9: These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government.</p>

<p>Regarding the incident of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 2 airplane, which was forced to land in Outer Mongolia while flying from Beiping to Hulun (Manzhouli) on July 2, the company's letter to the postal authorities expressed apologies for the impact on the mail carried by the airplane. It also stated that the airplane is still being detained and has not been released, and efforts are being made to ensure that both the airplane and the mail are returned as soon as possible. According to news from the local post office, mail collected in Shanghai from June 28 to 30 (including these two days) was affected by this accident.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Donggang Steamer Hits Reef in Xiamen Waters <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲ All Crew Members Rescued</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Ship Carries Them to Xiamen</p>
<p>▲ Donggang Hits Reef  Recently, there has been continuous mold rain, and the sea is often foggy, making navigation very difficult. The Donggang, a steamer of the local Chinese merchants, operates on the South China and Fujian waters. This time, it was loaded with cargo and set sail. While sailing off Xiamen, near the lighthouse, it encountered foggy weather. On the 19th, the ship was lost in the fog, lost its course, and there were winds and waves on the sea surface, causing the ship to hit a reef outside the lighthouse. The hull was breached, seawater entered the cabin, and the ship sank, which was very dangerous.</p>
<p>▲ Shipowner Seeks Help  After the ship had an accident, the crew, sailors, etc., scrambled to lower lifeboats into the sea in an attempt to escape. The ship had no wireless telegraph, so the shipowner sent out a distress signal, blowing a whistle and firing rockets, hoping that the ships passing by could hear the alarm and come to the rescue. It is said that the ship was fortunately grounded on the reef, so it was not completely submerged in the sea.</p>
<p>▲ Employees Rescued  At about 4:00 AM on the 20th, the Lushan Maru, a Nanyang liner of the local Nissin Company, passed by. The Lushan Maru is a Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Guangdong liner. It departed from Shanghai on the 18th and went to Xiamen to unload goods. On the morning of the 20th, while passing through the waters off Xiamen, the fog had cleared. The crew of the ship saw the distress signal, and the shipowner, Nagayama, followed the navigation regulations and sailed to rescue. Near the Donggang wreck, it dropped anchor and lowered the lifeboats to the Donggang reef, rescuing all 40 crew members, sailors, and passengers. They were taken aboard the Lushan Maru and sent to land in Xiamen.</p>
<p>▲ Sent to Xiamen  After rescuing these 40 employees and others, the Lushan Maru carried them to Xiamen. When the Lushan Maru arrived in Xiamen, it handed over the crew and sailors to the Japanese Consulate in Xiamen. The Japanese Consulate then notified the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, which sent personnel to receive them. Yesterday, it was heard that the rescued people had arrived safely in Xiamen, and the crew and passengers on board were not injured or left behind.</p>
<p>▲ Loss Situation  According to yesterday's telegram, all the cargo on the Donggang ship was submerged. All the shipowners and others barely escaped with their lives and did not carry any luggage or clothing. As for whether the hull can be salvaged, there is no definite news.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Changes to Branch Office in Wusong <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲ Former Chamber of Commerce is Still Striving</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has established a branch office in Wusong, and it began operating at the original site of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce on the 14th of this month. Although the business of the former Chamber of Commerce has been virtually suspended since the seal was seized, the members are still arguing reasonably. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Yuchi Resigns as Director  The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly considered the issue of the director of the Wusong branch office. It must appoint someone who is familiar with the situation of Wusong and trusted by all the merchants and residents of the town to be competent. As a result of the discussion, telegrams were sent to various agencies stating that Zhang Yuchi did not take office because Zhang is the general manager of Wansheng Garden in Wusong and the founder of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, serving as the vice president and standing committee member of the chamber. Recently, regarding the issue of the separate establishment of the chamber, he and Zheng Shushan, Dong Fei, Wang Yingru, and other members of the chamber are striving for the existence of the chamber. Although the chamber has been suspended, it is still in dispute, so he is unwilling to give up the chamber and take the position of director of the office.</p>
<p>▲ Change to Branch Office  The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's establishment of a branch office requires the director to be qualified as a member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the regulations. However, when the Municipal Business Consolidation Association reorganized the chambers of commerce in the special municipality, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce was not included in the reorganization, and no merchants in Wusong joined the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the establishment of the branch office was inconsistent with the regulations, so it was changed to a branch office. A wooden seal was carved with the words "Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wusong Branch Office Seal," which was put into use yesterday and notified to various agencies. The official director of the office has not yet been appointed and is currently being sought. All affairs are still temporarily handled by Sun Mingqi, a staff member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Attitude of the Former Chamber of Commerce  According to Zheng Shushan and Dong Fei, members of the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce, the chamber received a reply from the Central Training Department stating, "All documents are known. After investigation, this case has been handled in accordance with laws, regulations, and precedents, and replies have been sent to the Executive Yuan and the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee for reference. Await the local party headquarters and the competent official agency to resolve it according to law, etc." In response to this, regarding the issue of existence, we are still waiting for a resolution. Upon reading the newspaper, we saw an article stating that the Central Party Headquarters replied to the Executive Yuan, explaining that the Wusong Chamber of Commerce does not need to be established separately. The members believe that the Central Government misunderstood and violated Article 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. A telegram was sent to the National Government Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, and Ministry of Industry on the previous day, requesting separate explanations.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Resolution of the Tea Room Dispute on the Datong Company's Zhengda Steamer <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tea Room Wage Disputes</p>
<p>▲ Union Mediation Concludes</p>
<p>The Zhengda Steamer of the Shanghai-Yangtze line, formerly the New Daming Steamer of the Datong Company, which was built after being sunk by a Japanese ship, is dedicated to the Shanghai-Yangtze line (i.e., the Little Yangtze River). Yesterday, it returned to Shanghai from the port of Yangzhou. The tea room staff had a fight over the distribution of alcohol funds, which was later mediated by the Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Union and resolved peacefully. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Replacement of Head  The Zhengda Steamer has a total of 25 tea room staff members, including Zhao Liansheng, the head, who was the deputy head of the tea room on the New Daming Steamer. After the New Daming was sunk, he was transferred to the Zhengda Steamer as the head. Last month, Zhao took leave to return home to repair his house that was blown down by the wind. He returned to the ship for work on the 17th of the previous day, only to see a notice from the comprador Zhu Zuoting that he was dismissed as head and changed to an ordinary worker. The position of head was promoted by deputy head Huang Yunfang. Zhao then negotiated with the comprador and inquired about the reasons for his dismissal. He was told that he often took leave. Zhao reported to the union and requested assistance. The union is currently investigating.</p>
<p>▲ Tea Room Staff Fight  Although Zhao Liansheng was dismissed as head, he was still assisting in the work. Yesterday, after the ship returned to Shanghai from Yangzhou, according to the regulations, after stopping, the tea room staff analyzed the aid funds. The head should get one and a half shares. Although Zhao was dismissed by the comprador, because he had not received an order from the union, the workers still recognized Zhao as the head, so all the alcohol funds of half a share were still given to Zhao. Huang Yunfang argued with him. At that time, worker Zhu Zhiting was dissatisfied and quarreled with him, followed by mutual beatings, which was stopped by others. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<p>▲ Union Mediation  After Zhu and Huang fought each other, after being persuaded, at 2:00 PM, the Shanghai branch of the Zhao Seamen's Union was mediated by two members of Luo Tang. As a result, both sides compromised. From now on, half of the alcohol funds for the head will be shared equally by Zhao and Huang, and they will help each other in their work. Both sides were satisfied with the solution. Huang was not a member, but is now being introduced to the association by Zhao.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Inside Story of a Love Suicide <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲ Ma Alan is Yao Yuying</p>
<p>▲ A Man and Woman United in This Way</p>
<p>▲ The Deceased Left Behind a Wife and Mother</p>
<p>▲ Yao Yuying Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>At midnight on the 11th of this month, in Room 11 of the North Station Grand Hotel at the intersection of Beishan West Road, a man named Ma Shouxiang (also known as Ma Zixiang) and a young woman named Ma Alan (also known as Yao Yuying) committed suicide by poisoning. The man died instantly, while the woman was rushed to the hospital and survived. On the 14th, the French Concession Police Department escorted Ma Alan to the Special District Local Court for questioning. Details of the case have already been reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>▲ Two Letters From Outside: Since this case occurred,</p>
<p>it has attracted considerable attention from the general public. Recently, both the French Concession Police Department and the Special District Court received letters by mail. The letter received by the police department was signed by Ling Yuanfang and Qian Dongfu, and mailed from 240 Yangjia Bang Road. The letter stated that Ma Alan's real name was Yao Yuying, and her father was a wealthy businessman in Qingdao. The writers requested justice for the deceased. The letter received by the court was signed by a Mr. Guo, who claimed to admire Yao Yuying's character and wished to marry her.</p>
<p>▲ Many Male and Female Spectators: Yesterday morning was the date for the continued</p>
<p>hearing of the case. The police department brought Yao's family members and witnesses, and escorted Yao Yuying to the Second Tribunal of the Special Court. Judge Ge Zhitan presided with Prosecutor Guo Huaipu. The courtroom was packed with male and female spectators. The defendant, Yao Yuying, still had very red and swollen eyes due to the incomplete elimination of the poison. She stood in the defendant's dock.</p>
<p>▲ Returning Home After Husband's Death: First, Wang Yaotang, the agent of the police department, stepped forward and gave a detailed account of the investigation. He stated that after the last postponement of the case, police detectives began a detailed investigation and learned that the defendant's real name was Yao Yuying, 22 years old, from Wuxi. Her home address was 22, Lane 6, Shiqing Road East, North Sichuan Road. Her father's name was Yao Renjie, who ran a coal mine business in Qingdao. His first wife had passed away, and he had married a Yang as his second wife. Yuying was born to the first wife. She had studied at Qingxin School for four years in her childhood. At the age of 17, she was married to Zhu Xiancheng at the arrangement of her parents and suffered severe abuse. After a year and a half, Zhu suddenly fell ill and died. Because Yao could not bear the suffering, she returned to her mother's home a year ago and lived with her stepmother, Yang.</p>
<p>▲ Secret Love Letters: Across the street, at number 20, was the Qunxin Art Studio, opened by Zhang Wentao. Because the premises were small and insufficient, he expanded to number 18. The deceased, Ma Shouxiang, was a technician at the studio, and his office was in room number 18, directly opposite the defendant's bedroom. As a result, they became acquainted. However, the defendant also had a friend named Tao Guidao, who also worked at the Qunxin Art Studio and was a colleague of the deceased. Tao initially had a crush on the defendant. Later, after becoming acquainted with the defendant's stepmother, he often visited the Yao family. However, going alone was inconvenient, so he brought Ma Shouxiang along. Ma Shouxiang, still concerned, first threw a love letter through the window into the defendant's bedroom. After reading it, she expressed sympathy, and their relationship began.</p>
<p>▲ Plotting Suicide at Kunshan: On the 9th of this month, the defendant's father suddenly returned home from Qingdao and saw a man (Ma Shouxiang) with the defendant in the living room. He became suspicious and, in the evening, questioned Yang, learning the whole story. He negotiated with Ma Shouxiang, who wanted to commit suicide, but the defendant dissuaded him. On the 10th, the defendant and the deceased first met in a nearby hotel and decided to go to Kunshan together to commit suicide, to prevent outsiders from discovering the truth.</p>
<p>▲ Going to Fanwang Ferry Together: Because it was late that day, they went to Andong Hotel on Hubei Road to spend the night. They wrote five suicide notes, addressed to the defendant's father, mother, Ma Shouxiang's father, uncle, and friends. The next day, they went out and bought a yuan's worth of opium, two boxes in total. They intended to go to Fanwang Ferry Station to get the train schedule to go to Kunshan to commit suicide. On the way, they dropped the five suicide notes and a park admission ticket into a mailbox. When they arrived at Fanwang Ferry, they could not find the schedule, so they decided to change their plan and go to Zhao Feng Garden to commit suicide. However, the park admission ticket had already been dropped into the mailbox.</p>
<p>▲ Poisoning at a Grand Hotel: They then thought of going to Song Park in Zhabei to end their lives, so they went to a cold drink shop on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession and drank ice cream. They wrote another suicide note and mailed it to their friend. Later, the defendant expressed opposition to committing suicide in Song Park. As a result, they went to Room 11 of the North Station Grand Hotel and committed suicide by taking opium. The defendant took one box first, and the deceased took one box later, etc. Now the defendant's family and witnesses are present, requesting interrogation.</p>
<p>▲ Two Reasons for Suicide: The defendant Ma Alan, also known as Yao Yuying, confessed that her husband, Zhu Zhaicheng, had been dead for several years. Judge Ge asked, "Are the facts stated by the police department's lawyer earlier true?" She replied, "Yes." But this time, Ma Shouxiang initiated the suicide. There were two reasons for his suicide: (1) He suspected that I had another lover and my reputation was not good; (2) Due to economic pressure.</p>
<p>▲ Buying a Yuan's Worth of Opium: The judge also asked, "Did your parents want to marry you to a tailor?" She replied, "I have never met him. Ma and I had already had physical relations. The reasons for his suicide have been explained. My suicide was because I had no other relations with others." Ma initiated the purchase of the opium, a yuan total, buying two boxes. Each of us ate one box. I ate first. "Did you instigate or help Ma Shouxiang commit suicide?" She replied, "No, it was all voluntary." "Was your suicide due to family pressure?" She replied, "No." But the deceased's real name was Ma Zixiang.</p>
<p>▲ Yao Renjie's Testimony: Yao Renjie, 59 years old, from Shanghai, coal business, resident of 22, Lane 6, Shiqing Road East, testified: "My first wife died early, and I only have one daughter, the defendant Yao Yuying. Yang is my second wife, married in 1926. Usually, I had a harmonious relationship with Yuying. Yuying married Zhu Zhaicheng at the age of 17. After Zhu died three years later, she separated from her husband's family and lived with me. On May 22nd, I went to Qingdao to run the coal mine business. On July 9th, I returned to Shanghai. After learning about this matter, because Ma Shouxiang already had a wife and was unable to support her, I did not agree. Unexpectedly, Yuying left the next day, the 10th, without saying goodbye. At first, I only knew that she went to a relative's place. Later, I saw the news in the newspaper and learned about the suicide by poisoning. Now I request permission to take the defendant back, so that I can arrange a marriage for her in the future, etc."</p>
<p>▲ What the Stepmother Said: Yao Yang, 32 years old, from Beiping, testified: "On the 9th of this month, my husband returned home from Qingdao and saw Ma Shouxiang in the living room. He asked me who he was. I replied that he was Yuying's friend. At this time, Ma had already slipped out. Until the next day, Yuying suddenly left. I did not know about the ambiguous relationship between Yuying and Ma at first. One day, I met the wife of a tailor shop owner, who wanted to arrange a marriage for her nephew, a short man named Wang, to marry Yuying. She also told me about Ma Shouxiang. Only then did I learn about it. But I do not know why Yuying committed suicide this time."</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Wentao's Testimony: Zhang Wentao, the owner of the Qunxin Art Studio, testified: "The deceased had been working for me for four or five years, with a monthly salary of fifty or sixty yuan. Tao Guidao had just arrived at my studio last month. On the 17th of last month, because the deceased and Tao were not working effectively, I dismissed them both. The defendant, Yao Yuying, did live next door. But I do not know whether Ma had an ambiguous relationship and why he committed suicide. Ma's original home was in Wuxi. His father passed away last year. Now there is only his old mother, wife, and a daughter at home, etc."</p>
<p>▲ Lawyer's Opinion: At this point, the witness testimony was completed. The police department's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stepped forward and stated that Ma Shouxiang's suicide was due to two points: (1) Because he was dismissed from his job and faced economic pressure; (2) He had a relationship with the defendant, but the defendant's father opposed it. Moreover, the things they had done were known to almost everyone in the vicinity. Therefore, he discussed suicide with the defendant. According to Article 290, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, those who conspire to commit suicide and commit a crime under this article may be exempt from punishment. Therefore, please adjudicate according to the law.</p>
<p>▲ Yao Yuying Not Guilty: Prosecutor Guo then gave his opinion, stating that according to the Criminal Law, anyone who helps or instigates suicide is guilty, but those who conspire to commit suicide are not guilty. After examining the various aspects of this case, it is indeed a conspiracy to commit suicide, and she should be found not guilty. Judge Ge Zhihao reviewed the report and announced the end of the debate. He declared that Ma Alan, also known as Yao Yuying, was not guilty and ordered that her father take her back.</p>

<p>▲ Beating a Man to Death With Four Fists</p>
<p>Lu Suzhen, from Chongming, had been working as a foreman in various construction plants in Shanghai. Recently, he moved with his family to live in Wujia Ting, Pudong. Due to a minor dispute over moving, he was dragged to a teahouse by local thugs, who arbitrarily extorted money and injured his vital organs. On the morning of the day before yesterday, he died from his injuries. The murderers fled without a trace. Yesterday, his wife reported the case to the police station, who arrested a woman named Shen Yang, who was the instigator. The local bailiff has reported the case to the local court for a post-mortem examination and to arrest the murderers. The details of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Cause of the Dispute: Lu went to Wujia Ting, Pudong, last month to find a house to rent. He was introduced by a woman named Shen Yang from Haimen, and rented a bungalow belonging to Zhang Aliu. He moved across the river with his wife, Mao (32 years old). After only a month, the house became dilapidated due to thunderstorms. Lu then rented Number 8, Zhu Family Residence in the same area. However, the former landlord, Zhang Aliu, suspected that Shen Yang had been manipulating things from the sidelines because Lu did not state his intention to terminate the lease in advance. He questioned Yang, who did not show any weakness, and was beaten twice by Zhang. This was the cause of the dispute.</p>
<p>▲ Extorting 100 Yuan: After being embarrassed, Yang blamed Lu for not notifying her about the move, and became entangled with Lu. Lu had no choice but to pay five yuan for medical expenses to apologize and settle the matter. However, Yang became greedy, thinking that Lu was a foreman and had plenty of money. She told a nearby thug, Wu Liufu, who gathered more than ten ruffians on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 18th) at 8 AM, dragged Lu to a small teahouse owned by Wu Xu in Wujia Ting, and demanded 100 yuan from Lu. Lu refused, and Wu beat him several times, causing internal injuries to his waist and ribs. As a result, Lu paid Wu and the others 40 yuan to settle the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Dying from Injuries: Lu returned home with internal injuries and took to his bed. He died from his injuries at 10 AM on the 10th. His wife, Mao, had just moved here and was unfamiliar with the area and helpless. She rushed to the accounting office of the construction plant in Puxi to cry and tell Shi Yulin about what happened. Shi was from Haimen and had been working with Lu for many years. He was determined to avenge his friend and immediately crossed the river with Mao to report to the 3rd District Police Station of the Qichang Zhan Public Security Bureau. Chief Shen, at 9 PM that night, supervised the police officers to arrest the murderer, Wu Liufu, who had long since disappeared. He immediately detained Shen Yang, who started the trouble, and the teahouse owners Wu Xu and Zhu Zhang, who were witnesses, and took them to the 3rd District for questioning.</p>
<p>▲ Escorted to Court: First, Lu Mao, the wife of the deceased, 32 years old, testified, "My husband, Lu Suzhen, died unnaturally. I request justice." Next, the first witness, Wu Xu, 39 years old, a local resident, living at 21 Dingjiazhai, who runs a small teahouse, testified: "On the 18th of this month, Shen Yang invited many people to have tea at my teahouse. I saw Lu being punched four times by a man, and then they all scattered. I do not know the murderer. Ask Shen Yang, and she will know." The second witness, Zhu Zhang, 60 years old, a local resident, living at 9 Zhujiazhai, a neighbor of Lu, testified: "On the 18th of this month, Lu borrowed 25 yuan from me, saying that he had been extorted 40 yuan and had already paid 15 yuan. It is true that I lent him the money at that time." Shen Yang also testified, 40 years old, from Haimen, living in Dingjiazhai, Wujia Ting, "I introduced Lu to rent Zhang Aliu's house. Lu moved elsewhere in less than a month, and Zhang said that I instigated it and beat me twice. I was angry and negotiated with Lu. Lu gave me five yuan for medical expenses. Later, I asked Wu Liufu and others to find Lu to talk. I did not tell Wu to beat him, etc." The district chief, considering that the case involved a death, ordered the thousand witnesses to be escorted to the local court for questioning yesterday afternoon. Lu's body was also inspected by the court yesterday afternoon and ordered to be collected, pending the arrest and prosecution of the murderer.</p>

<p>▲ Dredging... Repairing... Applying Medicine</p>
<p>Since taking over the South Shanghai Wharf, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has actively streamlined the security, order, cleanliness, and hygiene of each wharf. Recently, the Bureau has reported to the mayor regarding dredging, which various shipping companies consider to be of vital interest, and negotiated with the Junpu General Avoidance Agent. After the No. 1 wharf at the 16th Shed starts work, dredging will commence. In the future, merchant ships will not have difficulties berthing. Since the dredging of one wharf will temporarily suspend the use of four wharves, the Bureau plans to take the opportunity to repair each floating wharf to ensure a permanent solution. It is understood that the first step is to repair wharves No. 1 to No. 4. An agreement has been reached with the He Xing Machinery Manufacturing Factory on the price, and work will begin immediately. It is estimated that wharves No. 1 and No. 2 will be completed and reinstalled by the end of this month to facilitate docking. It is also reported that the Bureau has prepared three medicine boxes for emergency treatment to prevent the outbreak of cholera and other diseases, as merchants and travelers gather in the wharf area. The medicine boxes contain Ten Drops of Water, 万金油, hemostatic drugs, and other medicines. One box is placed in the warehouse management office at the Maojia Nongkou Wharf, and the other two are placed on wharves No. 2 and No. 14, so that patients on the wharf ships can use them nearby at any time.</p>

<p>▲ Russian Teenager Unable to Deny It</p>
<p>A Russian named Bao Yigu (transliteration), 27 years old, worked as a bodyguard. Last month, he went to 728 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession to propose marriage to a Russian woman named Gao Re Laofu (transliteration), 19 years old. He had a dispute with the son of Bai Chaixi (transliteration), who lived with the woman. Bao took out a pistol and fired, killing Bai's son. Yesterday, the police department summoned all the witnesses to the French Court Criminal Division for questioning. First, the Western Detective Chief reported the entire case. The victim's family hired lawyer Lei Shengbu as their representative. They claimed that the case was very simple but very serious. The defendant proposed marriage to the victim's girlfriend, but was unsuccessful. He took out a pistol to threaten her. The victim heard the noise and went downstairs to question him. At that time, both parties went to the police station. The police chief briefly warned the defendant and instructed him not to carry a gun to scare people again to avoid danger. He was severely reprimanded and dismissed. Unexpectedly, after returning home, the defendant took out a gun again and killed the plaintiff's son. In such a situation, the defendant committed the crime of intentional homicide under Article 282 of the Criminal Law. In addition to requesting a strict investigation, the victim was only 20 years old and was operating in Harbin, earning 75 yen (Japanese currency) per month, equivalent to 120 Chinese yuan. They requested compensation of 50,000 yuan. Then, the woman, Gao Re Yingfu, and Pei Erjin, etc., took the stand to testify about the situation at the time.

<p>Ye Zhang, a woman from Dongting Mountain, 34 years old, lives at No. 16, Yin Xian Alley, inside Dadongmen. Her husband, Ye Shaochu, 46 years old, is doing business in other cities. She is addicted to opium and spends all day lying in bed, smoking. As a result, the money her husband sends home every month is not enough to cover expenses, and she has been facing increasing financial difficulties. Recently, she has become more and more impoverished. Feeling that there is no joy in her life, she suddenly had the idea of ending her life. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, she walked to the Nanshi Wharf and, taking advantage of people not paying attention, jumped into the Huangpu River. In an instant, waves splashed everywhere. A detective, Wang Anming, from the French Concession General Patrol Department happened to be passing by on business. He saw it and immediately called on the boatmen to rush over and rescue her. She was fortunate to survive. After asking her the reason, he sent her to the First Sub-station of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The police chief, Jin, preliminarily questioned her. Considering that she brought the trouble on herself, he gave her some advice and ordered her to stay temporarily while waiting for her family to come and claim her.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association Telegraphs Request to Recover Chongqing Japanese Concession <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>▲ Also Expresses Complete Anti-Japanese Stance on the Wanxian and Xiamen Cases</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, in order to urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to recover the Japanese concession in Wangjiatuo, Chongqing, and hoping that the Chinese people will unanimously oppose Japan, sent two telegrams the day before yesterday, as follows: (Telegram 1) Urgent, respectfully addressed to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, upon investigation, the Japanese special administrative concession in Wangjiatuo, Chongqing, was forcibly leased by the Japanese from our local authorities on August 12th of the 27th year of the Guangxu Emperor [1901]. Since the Japanese occupied this concession, they have indulged their military police, brutally killing citizens, such as the Yang Shunfa case and the Tian Jinshan case, which remain unresolved to this day. Their harboring of bandits and harming of the local area, such as selling firearms and smuggling pig bristles, is especially heartbreaking to the people of Chongqing. Now that the central government plans to recover all concessions nationwide, why is the Chongqing people's repeated request to recover this concession being delayed by your ministry? Furthermore, Article 10 of the treaty states that all leases are limited to thirty years, after which the contract should be renewed. According to the regulations, a new contract should be signed every thirty years. According to the date starting from the 27th year of Guangxu, this year, September 24th, marks the end of the thirty-year period. Since the lease has expired, it should be unconditionally recovered. As for renewing the lease, since our country has abolished unequal treaties, there is no room for further recognition. We specially request your ministry to revitalize the spirit of revolutionary diplomacy, implement the declaration of the National Assembly, and recover this concession as scheduled to protect national rights and appease popular anger. Furthermore, the people of Chongqing, deeply resentful of the Japanese's outrageous behavior in Chongqing, have formed a Grand Assembly for the Movement to Recover the Japanese Concession. The public sentiment is high, and the concession must be recovered. According to Chongqing news, the assembly has resolved that if your ministry fails to recover the concession as scheduled, they will use the power of the masses to automatically recover it. Your ministry cannot ignore this matter. If the people of Chongqing act hastily and implement automatic recovery, and are then massacred by Japanese military police or other major incidents occur, who will be to blame? We hope that your ministry respects the late Premier's legacy of abolishing treaties and fulfills the ardent desires of the people of Sichuan. We respectfully submit this telegram, awaiting your wise instructions. Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, respectful salute, seal. (Telegram 2) (Omitted titles) To all, the Japanese imperialists have arbitrarily massacred our Chinese people for a long time. Recently, the Wanxian and Xiamen cases have occurred, exposing their ambition and viciousness, which are truly heartbreaking. The people of Sichuan have suffered particularly deeply from Japanese oppression. The Japanese special administrative concession in Wangjiatuo, Chongqing, was forcibly leased by the Japanese from our local authorities in the 27th year of Guangxu [1901]. Chongqing has no other foreign concessions, but Japan occupies this one to control the people of Sichuan. Over the years, they have indulged their military police, brutally killing citizens, harboring bandits, and trampling on the local area, doing everything they want. This September marks the end of the thirty-year lease for the concession. The people of Chongqing, having learned from their pain, have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate for its recovery, but it has been delayed. Recently, the Japanese have increased their military police in the concession area to demonstrate against our Sichuan people in support of the Wanxian and Xiamen cases. Upon hearing this, our association, in addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request that they recover the concession as scheduled, believes that opposing Japan and wiping out the shame has become a movement for our entire nation. Therefore, we offer four points for encouragement to our compatriots nationwide: (1) Recognize the Japanese imperialists as the greatest enemy of our national revolution. We must work hard to defeat them to ensure the survival of our nation. (2) Recognize that Koreans' anti-Chinese sentiment is directed by the Japanese. Firstly, Koreans are Japanese citizens, and secondly, anti-Chinese sentiment is directed by the Japanese. (3) Economic severance with Japan must be maintained until all unequal treaties between China and Japan are abolished and all illegal rights of Japan in China are canceled. (4) Urge the diplomatic authorities to implement revolutionary diplomacy, promptly resolve all pending cases and tragedies between China and Japan, and not engage in secret diplomacy, separating themselves from the people. Compatriots nationwide, opposing imperialism and abolishing treaties are the most important legacies of the late Premier. Now, the Japanese imperialists have placed their knives on our necks. If we still do not vow to oppose imperialism and strive to abolish treaties, how can we face the descendants of the Father of the Nation? We seventy million people of Sichuan will not dare to lag behind you gentlemen, and we will be ready to perish with Japan. We respectfully submit this telegram, asking for your consideration. Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, respectful salute, seal.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Liu Maochu Suggests Compassionate Treatment of Prisoners <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲ Memorandum to the High Court</p>
<p>Liu Maochu, Chief Prosecutor of the Local Court, submitted a memorandum to the High Court, stating that he was presenting a memorandum on fundamentally improving prisons, hoping for review and implementation. The overcrowding of prisons has been reported monthly and is already well known. The number of cases has surged during the summer seasons, and with many executions, the prisons are overcrowded, with inmates sitting on the floor, suffocating from carbon monoxide. Every visit to the prisons evokes many thoughts. The duty of the prosecutor is to expose crimes, eliminate evil, and not be lenient. For those who disrupt the country and infringe upon public interests, they are brought to justice. The criminal court convicts them, causing them shame, making them pay compensation, restricting their freedom, or taking their lives. Those whose freedom is restricted wear gray clothes, eat coarse food, live in cramped rooms, are separated from their families, and their letters are inspected. Who doesn't have parents and feels heartbroken? Who doesn't have spouses and is constantly dreaming of them? In many cases, a family's livelihood depends on one person, and the wife becomes a servant and the children are sold to other places. The weak commit suicide, and the strong take risks. Secondary problems arise as a result. The reason for this is none other than the problem of people's livelihoods. Driven by the need to survive, people resort to murder, arson, adultery, theft, and other different means. Some are due to a moment of misjudgment, others to a momentary impulse, or they are forced by circumstances. The motives are different, and the situations are pitiable. I have often said that the increase in social crime is primarily due to material civilization, but the country's incomplete education, the imperfection of social systems, and the government itself cannot shirk their responsibility. Furthermore, during imprisonment, on the one hand, they are influenced by what they see and hear, and their bad habits increase, and their knowledge of crime only expands. On the other hand, their personal status is impacted, and they decline further, and few can return to their original state. At the same time, prisoner rations damage the national treasury, using useful rice to feed useless people, which is uneconomical. The way to alleviate the current situation is to grant parole according to law. A slight change during the hot summer is urgent. There are two principles for fundamental improvement: first, in criminal law, if both fines and imprisonment are possible, fines should be imposed; second, in cases of imprisonment, if the conditions for probation are met, probation should be announced. This would increase legal revenue and reduce prisoner rations, benefiting the treasury, and would also allow people to reform, reverse their failures, and allow the weak to escape from their predicament. I, as the Chief Prosecutor, have discussed these two principles during memorial weeks, and they do not violate the articles of criminal law. Before the prisons are expanded, there is no other way, it is said. Chief Prosecutor Liu believes that the latest criminal policy adopts the principle of rehabilitation rather than intimidation and retaliation. It is said that after the Ministry of Justice approves this principle, it will instruct all prosecutors to state their opinions when arguing cases in court to ensure uniformity and avoid discrepancies.</p>

<p>▲ Preferential Treatment for Women</p>
<p>Regarding the recruitment of postal clerks by the local postal bureau, the bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday, stating that there are vacancies for postal clerks in the Shanghai, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei, Liaoning, and Hunan postal districts, and a total of fifteen people need to be added due to business development. Local recruitment should be approved according to regulations. However, in recent years, many women in various places have received advanced education, and many postal bureau affairs are suitable for women's work, especially in savings and remittance affairs. For the purpose of promoting women's employment, women applicants should be given preferential treatment in this recruitment of postal clerks to show encouragement. This should be followed, and the details of the examination and the names of the recruited employees should be reported to the Ministry for record. According to this order, the postal bureau has decided to give preferential treatment to women who apply for this examination.</p>

<p>▲ Three People Jump from the Building and Are Seriously Injured</p>
<p>At 11:15 last night, a fire suddenly broke out at Lao Tiancheng Shoe Store, No. 196 Fangxie Road, Nanshi, which was opened by Ji Chuchen from Zhenjiang. The fire quickly spread, and fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene to rescue. It took twelve minutes to extinguish the fire. However, when the fire was raging, Ji's elderly mother, Ding (60 years old), his younger brother A Lin (22 years old), and his sister-in-law Yin (19 years old) all jumped from the building and were seriously injured.

<h3 id="e146">Chinese Hospital Plans to Expand <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Medical Association has established the Chinese Medical College on Huangjiaque Road and attached a Chinese Hospital for students to practice. The hospital doctors are selected by the association from Chinese medicine practitioners with rich knowledge and experience. In case of difficult and serious illnesses, the association can appoint specialists for diagnosis and treatment. With this reputation, the hospital is extremely crowded with patients. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has approved factories to send sick workers to the hospital with vouchers for free medicine and treatment. The diagnosis and treatment business has become more developed. In addition, the Factory Law will be implemented on August 1st, and more than a dozen factories have sent representatives requesting that the hospital be contracted to treat their workers. The original wards and clinics are not sufficient and must be greatly expanded to meet the demand. However, the expenses for diagnosis and medicine are huge and cannot be borne solely by the Chinese Medical Association. Therefore, the association has hired Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, Pan Gongzhan, You Jusheng, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Ye Huijun, and Fang Jiaobo as directors of the hospital to expand it as much as possible. The night before last, a banquet was held at the Hangzhou Restaurant on Edward Road to entertain the directors and discuss the direction of progress. Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, and a representative of Pan Gongzhan attended. The standing committee directors of the association gave a detailed explanation of the expansion plan. Work will begin soon, and Shanghai will have a large-scale Chinese hospital to benefit the sick.</p>

Before entering the door, the robbers fired three shots to intimidate, and then invaded the inner room, robbing 40 silver dollars and seven pieces of clothing, and fled without a trace.</p>

Ms. Gordon was kind and devoted her life to the temperance movement, working extremely hard, serving the community, and achieving remarkable results. Women's Temperance Unions in various countries will hold a memorial service on the 21st of this month (Ms. Gordon's birthday).

<p>▲ Stone Lime Transportation Industry. The Stone Lime Transportation Industry Association held its first executive committee meeting yesterday. Temporary Chairman Xu Shengfang gave a report. Qiu Zijia, Ma Zhaoye, Xu Shengfang, Lu Fusheng, and Zhou Jinfang were elected as standing committee members, and Qiu Zijia was elected as chairman. The positions of general affairs, accounting, and investigation were appointed, and work began immediately. Next, the proposals were discussed: (1) Stone lime market price issue. It was resolved that from July 20th, the price per load would be uniformly 2.25 silver dollars. If the brick and ash industry trades with cash, a commission of 0.05 silver dollars may be deducted. All members should be notified to comply. (2) It was resolved that if various lime ship companies enter into fixed-order contracts with customers, they should register the contracts with the association within three days. (3) Various lime ship owners reported that when unloading goods at the dock, they were often blackmailed by hooligans. How should this be dealt with? It was resolved that a request should be submitted to the authorities to strictly suppress this. (4) Before the lime ships arrive in Shanghai, they do not know how many ships are already docked at the pier. They often go directly to the port, but if there are too many ships, the Suzhou River current is rapid and dangerous. How should this be avoided? It was resolved that the association would establish a branch office in Bailianjing, Huangdu, where lime ships from the north and south would temporarily register and then be released to Shanghai in order to avoid congestion and danger. The association will also submit a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to notify the local Public Security Bureau to issue a notice of protection. (5) The appointment of the Zhengming Law Firm as the association's permanent legal counsel was approved. (6) The new national standards of weights and measures should be notified to all members to change to the new standards within a time limit.</p>

(A) The various reports were completed. (B) The discussion began. (1) The anti-Chinese sentiment of the Koreans is entirely instigated by Japan. According to the Anti-Japanese Aid Association organization, this association should unanimously provide assistance. It was resolved to notify all member stores to fly a half-mast flag for one day on the 23rd, close for half a day, and stop importing Japanese goods and register Japanese goods. The association will certify the claims to show the spirit of the Chinese nation. (2) Business tax is a national tax and should be paid in accordance with the tax law to emphasize tax collection. It was resolved that the collection method would be notified to member stores to comply. (3) The issue of tax exemption for exported embroidery. It was resolved to notify member stores to investigate. (4) The weights and measures reform plan. It was resolved to send a letter to member stores to implement it as soon as possible to emphasize the system and show uniformity. The required supplies should be obtained from the association.

<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Ghosts on the Thames</p>
<p>Western science is prosperous, and culture is developed. It seems that there is no atmosphere of superstition about ghosts and monsters. However, folk beliefs in ghosts are no less than those in the East. And many literati and scholars are studying spiritualism, such as the famous British novelist Conan Doyle, the creator of the great detective Sherlock Holmes. Conan Doyle was very believing in ghosts in his later years and published articles in magazines, creating the theory of ghosts. Recently, a writer named Fox Smith has written a book "The Thames," which describes that there are several places on the Thames River where ghosts appear. Tourists who are afraid of ghosts should not go there. It is said that in the town of Caversham, Berkshire, if tourists camp by the river, they often hear the sound of oars in the middle of the night. When they look closely, there is no boat on the river. But they always hear a boat sailing there. There is also a legend that a female ghost walks across the Abingdon Bridge every night, screaming a terrible "revenge." Some people have even seen her hair floating on the water during the day. This is really incredible. What is especially interesting is a legend in the town of Bisham. It is said that 300 years ago, a very knowledgeable woman lived in the church by the river. She saw that the ink was smudged on her son's writing book and was too dirty. She punished her son, but the punishment was too heavy and he was beaten to death. A few years later, she died in depression. Since then, her ghost has often appeared by the river and in the church, and she washes her hands in the river to wash away her son's bloodstains. These things are nothing more than Qi Dong's wild words and cannot be believed deeply. They can only be used as conversation aids.</p>

The public memorial service is described in detail below.</p>
<p>▲ Arrangement of the Memorial Hall The memorial hall was set up in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall in Yuzhang Park. A portrait of General Hu was hung at the entrance of the park, surrounded by electric lights. The railings on both sides were covered with mourning couplets. Inside the memorial hall, another portrait of General Hu was hung, surrounded by white flowers, and embedded with the four characters "Spirit Immortal," formed from electric lights. Below were wreaths arranged in a circular shape. In the center was a sacrificial table, on which were placed offerings of sacrifices, flowers, and fruits, arranged in a solemn manner.</p>
<p>▲ Public Memorial Service The 12th was the first day of the public memorial service. Representatives of the public memorial included He Yaozu, representing Chairman Chiang; Cheng Tianfang and Zhang Daofan, members of the Central Committee; Cao Haosen, a member of the Party and Government Committee; Lu Diping, representing the Provincial Government; Liu Zhenqun, representing the Provincial Party Headquarters; and hundreds of key figures from Party and government organs. (Group guests were outside). After the memorial service, handkerchiefs and portraits of General Hu were distributed. Representatives of the family returned the greeting to the main officiants, expressing their gratitude. He, Lu, Cao, and others shed tears during the memorial service. After the ceremony, they went to the mourning hall to express their condolences to Madam Hu and her son, De Xin.</p>
<p>▲ Memorial Oration by the Commander-in-Chief For this public memorial service, Chairman Chiang of the National Government specially sent He Yaozu as his representative to deliver a memorial oration. The oration read (excerpt): Alas, the four suburbs changed fortresses, beacon fires flew. The dragon and tiger's strategy, spiritedly left a mark on the flag. Saying only the general, deservedly pushed forward the brave. Ten thousand men could not stop. Alone with his horse, fighting battles thousands of miles. Across the clustered mountain peaks, the enemy collapsed at the sight of the wind. A Han in the military. The northwest was pacified. Heroic troops written in grass. The rushing red disaster. Was then given to Jiangxi. Respectfully Xuesang. Directly pounced on the bandit nest. Why did I come later? Same voice with different mouths. Yu Mao Nai De. Selected to ascended the platform. Organized the army and practiced military skills. Killing the enemy was in full swing. The battle of Guangchang. First to climb the flag. Overwhelming nests of ten thousand madnesses. Rain of bullets and a forest of guns. Then you roar like a tiger. Fierce and vigorous. Why did heaven not pity? Lost my great city. Merit is after the people. Danger is before the people. Not arrogant, not boastful. Outstanding virtuous talent. Our national army. Moved the army to the west to conquer. Below vowed to comrades. Above vowed to the vast sky. Vast bright sky. Pacifying bandits is not difficult. Granting me a hundred obedience. Blocking me with many difficulties. Recalling the general. Brave soul is not lost. Grand and majestic spirit. Forever in the sky's destruction. Corresponding to my many lands. Brave and valiant. Reviving my orphans. Reversing the raging waves. Capture the leader, sweep the lair. In one fell swoop, clean up. Work together to the best of our ability. To tell the heroic spirit. Humbly, please accept the offerings.</p>
<p>▲ Filming the Ceremony To highlight General Hu's achievements, the General Hu Funeral Affairs Office hired photographers Yan Bingheng and others from the Shanghai Tianyi Film Company to film the public memorial and state funeral in Jiangxi with a motion picture camera. After filming, the footage was flown to Shanghai for processing. After processing, it was brought back to Jiangxi for screening, to promote his achievements and as a memento.</p>
<p>▲ Lantern Festival by the Chamber of Commerce In addition to following the public memorial schedule and attending the public memorial service, and notifying all shops to lower flags to half-mast to show mourning, all executive and supervisory committee members of the Nanchang City Chamber of Commerce held a lantern festival on the 14th. All kinds of lanterns used were contracted by a certain paper shop, with interlocking designs and novel patterns, which were quite unique, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Female Education and Female Students Fifty Years Ago <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— K</p>
<p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the St. Mary's Girls' School. A commemorative album was published, with an inscription by Ms. Zhang Mojun. Her account of the situation 50 years ago is quite valuable to look back on. Initially, there was Ms. Emma Jones, who came to China from the United States to preach. She then established a girls' school behind the Hongkou Church, named Wenji. It had eight students, all residing at the school. At that time, there were few women scholars, so they were not only tuition-free but also given money and clothing. Despite these generous treatments, the number of students remained small. Later, during a year of famine, starving people filled the roads. Ms. Jones was able to obtain many more students. However, knowing that they came out of poverty and would leave once prosperity returned, she stipulated that students would not be judged by their level of education but by their age. All students who reached the age of 18, regardless of their level of education, would have to graduate and leave the school. At that time, the curriculum focused on weaving, sewing, gardening, cooking, and other skills. Only in the morning would they briefly read simple versions of the Bible and the Four Books. Some outstanding students began to learn English. Before long, the American Civil War broke out, and the school had no funding. Ms. Jones ordered the students to stop classes and focus on needlework. They sold their work to foreign merchants to maintain the school. Unfortunately, smallpox broke out, and nearly half the school fell ill. Another Ms. Jones took over, but she succumbed to the disease. The school lacked leadership and was closed. When St. John's University built a new school building, Wenji reopened and was renamed as it is known today. The social conservatism of that time and the difficulty of establishing female education are vastly different from today, when women pay huge fees and still cannot gain entry.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Quick Sketch of Hardoon Garden <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 19th, my friend Mr. Wang of the She family went to Hardoon Garden to negotiate the matters regarding Hardoon's funeral. I thought of seeing this magnificent Hardoon Garden and followed him. Unfortunately, it was a brief visit, and I didn't get to stroll leisurely, but it broadened my horizons considerably. Here is a random account to show the grandeur of the rich man after his death and the enormity of his extravagance.</p>
<p>As the car turned from Seymour Road into Jing'an Temple Road, I saw the towering paifang (decorated archway) in front of Hardoon Garden, with the characters "East Yuan West Yuan" written on it. The walkways in the garden were temporarily decorated into corridors with white cloth, with countless lanterns hanging. These lanterns were all made of mourning couplets, which was truly innovative. In the center of the garden was a circular lawn with a monument, also made of mourning couplets. At night, electric lights in the monument shone, making it a spectacular sight. The previously colored pillars were now all painted white, like a silver world after snow.</p>
<p>The funeral affairs office was like a small-scale political organization, divided into general affairs, accounting, documents, and other departments. There were many people working there. The servants all wore long summer cloth gowns and were very courteous, which showed they had been trained. I sat for only about half an hour, and tea was changed fifteen times. Each time the tea was changed, a different servant did it. If one knew the number of servants, one might get an astounding number.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Wang was busy, I didn't get to see the memorial hall. However, according to Mr. Wang, the arrangement of the memorial hall was no different from the Confucian Temple's Ding Sacrifice. Bells and drums were placed on both sides, and the ceremony was grand. It was said that during the main sacrifice, Zheng Qinwen of the Datong Music Society, in his capacity as an alumnus of the Cang Sheng University, would join in playing the Zhonghe Shaoyue music. Zhonghe Shaoyue music is used to worship sages. Is Hardoon also a sage now? A smile. The people who performed the dotting of the spirit tablet were three former Qing Dynasty elders: a zhuangyuan (top scholar), a tanhua (third-ranked scholar), and a bangyan (second-ranked scholar). A foreigner's funeral completely using Chinese customs, I had never heard of it before. If there is such a thing, it probably started with Hardoon.</p>
<p>▲ Publishing News The ninth issue of the "Movie Monthly," edited by Mr. Zhou Shixun, was published yesterday by Wenhua Printing House. Also published at the same time was the "Short History of Movie Stars," which contains detailed accounts of the stars' backgrounds, love stories, and so on. It is truly the only reading material for those who love to watch movies from China and abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Travels in India (65) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>The Chinese are good at heresy. Naturally, they follow the Buddhist teachings. However, without traveling to India, one does not know that Buddhism was not conjured out of thin air but was produced based on Indian life and culture. Therefore, those who want to study Buddhism should travel to India once, which is equivalent to studying in China for several years. It must be known that India is the tree of wisdom, and the Buddha is the fruit it bears. There was first Indian culture, and then Buddhism was produced. Otherwise, why was the Buddha not born in China, or in Jewish, Japanese, or Korean cultures, but necessarily came from India, just as Confucius came from China? Knowing people is the only way to discuss the world; discussing the world is the only way to know people. I hope that Chinese Buddhists will not talk about emptiness behind closed doors. One meeting can be opened for every thousand people, and one representative can be elected. Each person can collect five corners, and a thousand people can collect five hundred yuan. Travel to India. From Shanghai to India, 300 yuan will be used as travel expenses, and 200 yuan will be used to purchase Buddha statues and bring them back. This association can be named the Thousand Buddhas Gratitude Association. If everyone can contribute one yuan, then half of it will be saved in the association for global missionary work. If all the Buddhists in the country can contribute one yuan each, half can be used to select people to visit India and half can be used to organize a world Buddhist conference. Then, before long, the entire Chinese culture can hold the bull's ear of the world. It must be known that today's India is not the same as before. The evolving India can also be visited. Contact its scholar-officials, and not only visit Buddhist sites. Those who come should be proficient in English. Otherwise, they will gain less. If you come together, it is enough for one in five people to be able to speak English. When visiting, you can also visit the island of Ceylon, which is an important place of Buddhist influence. In the past, Fa Xian lived here for several years. The main advocates of reviving Buddhism now have branches in the United States and the United Kingdom, but the Chinese are silent and unheard of. Only Master Taixu has traveled the world. However, Master Taixu told me that he planned to organize a Buddhist conference in Bali with 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, but he was unable to do so. One can imagine the stinginess of Buddhists. What is the point of calling oneself a Buddhist if one cannot get rid of stinginess? However, if you travel to Ceylon, you need to use an additional 100 yuan. But the above numbers are the minimum. If anyone comes, the Buddhist Association at 19 Hede Road, Shanghai, can provide accommodation.</p>
<p>That evening, the head of the Naren Misha Church and English teachers revised the declaration of the Asian Cultural Association that I had written. The declaration focused on reviving Eastern culture and opposing war. The language was extremely harsh. It was published in the world under my name. In the text, the civilization of butchers was fundamentally overthrown. In India, the movement is very enthusiastic and is linked to the Gandhi movement. However, Gandhi's academic and charismatic influence is great, and the movement is very fierce. I have been here for several months and have even seen Gandhi, but I still do not fully understand the source of his fundamental dedication to the great movement. How exactly does he fight the British government barehanded and be able to achieve victory to this extent? I asked many people, and they all said that Gandhi is good at silent prayer and has gained the power of the Buddha. They believe in Gandhi as a new Buddha. Try talking to an Indian, and you will be amazed at the greatness and depth of his mental strength. They all say that they have been so influenced by Gandhi's teachings. Indians are good at using mental strength, and Gandhi is a new inventor of mental strength. Looking at the rapid progress of mental strength in all of India, the movement of fighting guns and cannons barehanded seems not without hope. Indians firmly believe that this is possible. However, from the perspective of our Chinese thinking, it seems quite difficult. At first, I thought it was a joke, but recently I have also been influenced by the spiritual environment of the Indians and feel that there is also a two or three-point possibility. However, Indian culture wants to conquer power with conscience. Whether human conscience is reliable is still a question today.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Ziliang then handed the Romance of the Three Kingdoms to his wife. His wife shook her head:</p>
<p>"You read it to me!"</p>
<p>With no other option, he had to read it to her. This was the third time. Since he wasn't starting from the beginning, he picked a chapter at random and started reading. His wife listened for a while. Was it because she didn't find it interesting? Or was she listening very intently? She closed her eyes. Ziliang read for quite a while, but he didn't hear any sound from her. Could she have fallen asleep? So he stopped reading and gently called her:</p>
<p>"Yueru!"</p>
<p>She didn't respond.</p>
<p>"Yueru! Are you asleep?"</p>
<p>She had really fallen asleep. She wasn't making any sound at all. Ziliang put the Romance of the Three Kingdoms away. He tiptoed toward the attic. It was only seven o'clock, so he could easily correct a few composition notebooks. He had just reached the top of the stairs:</p>
<p>"Thief!"</p>
<p>Ziliang heard his wife's wild scream. How could he not be scared?</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Catch you, this runaway thief!"</p>
<p>After saying that, she laughed loudly:</p>
<p>"Well done! Well done! I wasn't asleep. You ran away instead. You used to tell me: you would never take a concubine. I always thought: as long as I'm not dead, you wouldn't take a concubine. But once I'm dead, I'm afraid it would be inevitable. But judging from your behavior now, you would take a concubine even if I'm not dead. Just think, I haven't fallen asleep yet, and you've already stopped reading the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and sneaked off to the back."</p>

The pre-market trading was still somewhat active, but the post-market was sluggish, and the market situation became clearer. This was because the market demand was weak, major players were waiting and watching, and buying interest was idle. The former opened weakly, but later sought balance by borrowing, and bond prices turned stable. The fluctuations between the various sessions were minimal. As a result, the 20th Customs Bond fell about 9 cents, the 19th Customs Surtax August issue fell 9 cents each, and other issues mostly fell by small amounts of 3 or 4 cents. However, the entire Sixth Issue spot price fell by 2 yuan compared to the beginning of the month. Spot prices for the Reorganization and Demobilization bonds still rose. It is estimated that the total transaction volume for the day was 16 million yuan, with only 4,000 yuan in spot transactions. In addition, 10 shares of Shanghai Bank stock were traded.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Market Amidst Refusal of Goods <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yarn Market Slightly Flat, Trend Still Upward. Due to the unusually enthusiastic patriotic movement, starting from the 23rd, all customs declarations for inferior goods have been stopped. There are rumors that Ningbo and Zhejiang are not allowed to ship goods. Therefore, the price of fine yarn has soared by more than 20 taels in recent days. Mainland dealers are rushing to load spot goods, and the prices of other yarns have also risen one after another. However, the price of 10-count coarse yarn is still stagnant, and transactions are extremely scarce. However, most small investors are optimistic about the refusal-of-goods movement and have a very strong intention to go long.</p>
<p>▲People's Standard Initially Rose, Then Fell. The opening of the People's Standard market at the exchange was driven by the rise in American cotton and the increasingly strong atmosphere of rejecting goods. The prices of all months rose by more than one or two taels. There was a slight drop in the second and third sessions, and the final increase was 1.27 qian. The afternoon was slightly weak, and the near month fell by 4.6 qian, while the far month was flat. The total transaction volume was 48,750 bales. It was found that Sen Kang sold 1,000 bales, Yongchang 1,250 bales, Dachang 1,100 bales, and Dafu 700 bales. Tongxing bought 1,150 bales, Yongfeng 1,300 bales, Yuda 1,200 bales, Gongtai 850 bales, Yuantai 800 bales, and Yongda 900 bales. The closing prices of the People's Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>▲Fine Yarn Rises Another 3-4 Taels. The sales of spot yarn are still good. It is found that the total daily sales statistics are 2,750 bales, with 900 bales imported by fellow traders. The price of fine yarn has risen by another 3-4 taels. Foreign traders imported 1,000 bales from Guangdong, 355 bales from inland areas, 100 bales from Wuhu, 175 bales from Jiangxi, 300 bales from Shantou, 100 bales from Xiamen, 100 bales from the Northern traders, and 200 bales from various other traders.</p>

<p>▲Excessive Rainfall... Far-Term Soars by Seven Qian</p>
<p>The cotton market has been stagnant for a long time, but yesterday it suddenly rose because the Han area suffered from excessive rainfall, and some cotton fields were slightly damaged. At the same time, American cotton also turned upward, so the Han dealers actively covered their short positions, and there was also a rumor that Japanese merchants were selling cotton futures in Qingdao factories. As a result, people's confidence greatly increased, and gold prices also remained firm. The market atmosphere is gradually expanding, and actual sales are becoming more active.</p>
<p>▲Han Standard, Han Dealers Covering Shorts. At the opening of the Han Standard market at the exchange, American cotton rose, the weather was unfavorable, and buying interest was tight. The Han dealers covered their short positions, and the prices of all months rose by 1, 2, 3, and 4 qian. In the afternoon, the Han dealers covered their short positions, and the market situation became even better. The prices of all months rose by another 1, 2, and 3 qian. The total transaction volume was 91,300 dan. It was found that Gengfeng sold 4,800 dan, Yuanda 2,100 dan, Dachang 2,500 dan, and Tianlong 1,500 bales. Rongxing bought 5,100 dan, Shenchang 4,500 dan, Gongtai 2,300 dan, Yutai 1,500 dan, and Yongfeng 2,600 dan. The closing prices of the Han Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>▲Spot Cotton Sees a Turning Point. Transactions in spot cotton are gradually becoming more active, and various factories are actively purchasing. There have been no reports of arrivals at the docks.</p>

<p>▲American Cotton Rises by More Than Thirty Points. Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to good news from Liverpool, excessive rainfall, and a lack of sellers. Futures prices rose by 33 to 35 points, and spot prices rose by 35 points. British cotton futures rose by 4 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm due to the rise in American cotton, short covering, and purchases by brokers. Pingguoer rose by 3.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 3 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 20th).</p>

<p>▲Xinzha. Yesterday, the rice market prices increased, and people's minds were agitated. Due to weather conditions, the shops on both sides took advantage of the situation to purchase inventory. In past years, rice prices invariably rose before the Great Heat (solar term). Sales of thick粳 (japonica), early rice, and late rice increased by two to three jiao. Sales of Luyang tip rice were extremely brisk, and the situation was firm. Bianyin 2 yuan rice arrived in three batches yesterday. All dou (a dry measure for grain) sold out on the same day, and prices were bid up by a chi (a unit of length). Inland boats were unable to enter due to strong winds in the Yejidun area, so imports arrived continuously.</p>
<p>▲Nantou. Sources from all sides were sparse. Although retail sales in urban and rural shops were not strong, prices rose because there was little accumulation of goods. The prices of thick 粳 rice increased by two to three jiao. The arrival of thin稻 (indica) rice was also thin, and the consumption was still low. Fresh goods in this street were still active, and prices also increased by a chi. Sales of Luyang tip rice and foreign rice increased daily and were slightly higher. Sales of Bianyin yuan rice were both sluggish, and there was no demand. Foreign rice dealers and this street continued to have outlets, and the market tightened.</p>

<p>▲Mainland Dealers Actively Buying</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, although foreign wheat quotations fell by a small amount of about one or two jiao, due to continuous showers and cold weather, various places were suffering from floods, and the early maturing crops that were about to be harvested and the late maturing crops that had not yet been harvested were directly or indirectly affected. Therefore, mainland dealers' buying interest became active again. The prices of far-term months opened higher and higher. However, due to the sluggish actual sales, this month remained flat and weak. As a result, this month was 2.5 li better than the previous day, August was 1.5 fen better, September was 1.25 fen better, October was 1 fen better, November was 10 li better, and December was 1 fen better.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Wheat Market: Futures and Spot Firm <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market generally showed a firm trend. Although foreign wheat quotations were slightly lower, mainland dealers and the Yangtze River area purchased because various places were suffering from floods, and grain prices were rising. Taking advantage of the trend, they purchased, and their intentions were based on some grounds. However, the operators in this port ultimately believed that the oversupply of foreign wheat had not been resolved, and the future would still be affected by the impact of foreign wheat. As a result, this month was 2 fen better than the previous day, August, September, and October were 1 fen better, November was slightly down by 1 fen, and December was 2 fen better. The spot wheat market remained stable, with little fluctuation compared to yesterday. 2,100 bales of wheat from Danyang, Yangzhou, Nanjing, and Chuzhou were opened and were purchased by Fuxin, Bufeng, and Fengxin. High-quality wheat for delivery to factories opened at 3 taels and 5.5 qian, and the next grade was 3 taels and 3.5 qian.</p>

<p>▲550 Jin of Reeled Silk Opens at 145 Taels</p>
<p>This year's spring silkworms in Zhejiang Province have suffered from weather damage, and there are few high-quality cocoons and many inferior ones. The yield is extremely poor, and the raw materials for silk factories are scarce. The cocoon market is brisk. Recently, various silk factories have been preparing to start work due to the imminent issuance of silk industry public bonds. They have all begun to purchase raw materials, and demand exceeds supply. Cocoon prices have become increasingly upward. Yesterday, a certain silk factory in Zhabei imported 380 dan of new spring dried cocoons from Hangzhou and Shaoxing. 550 jin of reeled silk opened at a price of 145 taels. The cost of pure silk must be 800 taels per bale, plus the cost of reeling, etc., which amounts to about 1,000 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Factory Silk Exports to Europe Show No Improvement <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' silk market in this port remained firm. It was found that the export of Shanghai white factory silk to the United States had been stagnant for a long time, and there was no improvement in the sales volume to Britain and France. The market atmosphere was sluggish. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson and others imported 20 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Taihe and others imported 15 bales of white dried silk. Prices were all firm.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Qining Flower Scented Black Tea Exports to Russia Continue to Be Smooth <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Russian Assistance Association's interest in importing Qining flower-scented black tea was strong. More than 3,000 boxes were traded throughout the city, with sales prices ranging from 14 taels and 5 qian to 16 taels and 5 qian, a decrease of two to three taels. The market for Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea has not made any significant progress, and tea prices are increasingly declining. However, there is still strong demand from French firms for Zhenmei and Xiumei, and the market inventory is scarce. Market prices rebounded by three to four taels. The market conditions for other tribute tea and pearl tea were all sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e173">News from Wuyuan Tea is Fragmentary <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲Transportation Problems for Boxed Tea. Wuyuan boxed tea is exported from Lehe and Poyang Lake to Jiujiang and then transferred to Shanghai. Last year, Poyang Lake was plagued by bandits, and river transportation was cut off. Most boxed tea was changed to land transportation and transported through Xikou, and then transported from Tunxi and Hangzhou to Shanghai. However, land transportation costs were high, and the procedures were complicated. This year, the banditry in Raole has been slightly quelled, and river transportation is gradually becoming passable. Unexpectedly, the Fangshao communists from the Fujian border invaded Dexing last month, and the Wuyuan and Lehe river routes were cut off again. Various firms, seeing that the Jin Yuanchang boxed tea boatmen were detained and tied up by bandits, were all cautious. They wanted to change to land transportation, but they were also suffering from a lack of porters. They were very hesitant about this transportation problem. Some changed to transporting from Jiangwan and then transferring to Shanghai, but most had to wait for the Gan River to be open for transportation before starting their shipments.</p>
<p>▲The Second Batch of Zhenmei Tea from Big Firms Piled Up. The first batch of Zhenmei tea from this county from big firms has already been shipped to Shanghai one after another. Although there was some activity in removing stems, the selling price was not as good as the early arrival of Tunxi Zhenmei tea, which obtained a better price. Ordinary Zhenmei tea was even more stagnant and unsalable. The market shrinkage was unprecedented. Therefore, the tea firms were all leisurely and slowly manufacturing and shipping the second batch of Zhenmei tea from big firms to avoid price declines due to the accumulation of goods. At the moment, the second batch of Zhenmei tea from big firms in various firms in the county are piled up one after another, packaged into boxes and waiting for shipment. Only a few firms that imported a small amount of tea only made two batches to complete the season, and it is rare to see those that continued to make three or four batches. Except for Jishengchang, Yuanji, Xinji, Yitaiyi, and Yitaixiang, which imported the most tea, the rest will be completed by the middle of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Piece Goods: Goods Sold Before Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲Existing Inventory Already Exhausted</p>
<p>▲Foreign Dealers May Stop Loading Today</p>
<p>The piece goods market has been soaring in recent days. The smoothness of sales is rare in the past. From the outbreak of the anti-Chinese movement in Korea to yesterday, it amounted to 16,000 pieces. Therefore, the existing inventory has been exhausted. Although inspection has gradually been implemented, most of it has already been transported into the mainland. Among them, the Yangtze River basin has a stronger intention to purchase. Sichuan purchased the earliest. Hankou, Jiangxi, Wuhu, and other dealers have been vigorously searching for goods in the past three days. Northern dealers have less interest because if the boycott becomes severe in the future, they can change to directly purchasing from Osaka. Therefore, there have been some resales. The outlets in this street are also unusually enthusiastic. The Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai railway stations have large piles of goods. However, inspection has been implemented since yesterday, so they have slightly restrained themselves. On the foreign dealer side, there are also rumors of stopping loading today. Yesterday's market was slightly softer. It is unprecedented for traders to return goods to customs, mainly because the goods were sold before arriving in Shanghai. However, it is also an important reason to urgently seek to sell. Fine broadcloth is almost disappearing. Huxinting, Huanle, and Qianlijv have all been sold out. Baoqiu's broadcloth is priced at 3 qian 9 fen 2.5 li, and the Yangtze River dealers are vigorously searching for it. Moganshan and Lieyan straight tribute cloths are uniformly out of stock. Whether it is large-patterned, medium-patterned, or black-patterned floral cloth, they have all been exhausted. Floral straight tribute wool is even rarer.</p>

<p>The first batch of new Daxing vegetables was transported by Zhenbang firms yesterday, totaling 153 pieces. They were immediately displayed for inspection. The quality of the goods varied slightly. The color was still good, but the body was still soft. This is unavoidable in the new season. They were immediately offered for sale, priced at 19.5 to 20 taels. Upon hearing the news, Guangdong dealers immediately purchased more than 70 packages from various firms. Goods with good color were sold for 21 taels, while goods of the next grade were sold for 20 taels and 5 qian to 20 taels. The trend was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Rises Gradually <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reports from the producing areas showed that the spot price of Cuban sugar had not changed compared to the previous report. New York sugar futures fell by 3 fen in September, 2 fen in December, and 1 fen each in March and May of next year. The spot and futures prices of Javanese sugar remained unchanged. The Public Association's scheduled operations for Japanese sugar have effectively ceased. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar turned firm again, and the ex-factory price rose to 11 taels and 6 qian, and later to 5 qian and 5 fen, but buying interest was not strong, and the price offered was low, so they held each other and there was no transaction. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at 11 taels, and the market was also stable. The booking price of Taikoo sugar for August rose by another 1 jiao, and the firms' intention to purchase was very weak. Spot DY mark was priced at 11 taels and 7 qian 5 fen to 8 qian, B Lai was priced at 11 taels and 1 qian, CW mark was priced at 11 taels and 8 qian 5 fen, H mark was priced at 10 taels and 7 qian, and HM mark was priced at 11 taels and 3 qian 5 fen. The ex-factory supply was scarce, and the market was quite brisk. A few hundred bags of locally produced Binghua Qing were offered at a price of 10 taels and 2 qian. The local Shanghai and China brands were also offered, and No. 1 goods were priced at 13 taels and 8 qian. The prices were at the original price, and the market situation was firm.</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Anatomy of the Free Wheel <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>▲Unanimous Praise from the British and American Automotive Industries</p>
<p>Articles about the free wheel have been published in this magazine before, so there's no need to repeat them. But today, we will conduct further research for our readers to understand the main advantages of the free wheel and analyze its various benefits. Since the invention of the free wheel, engineers in the British and American automotive industries have generally recognized it as a great success in automobiles and the greatest invention in the history of automobiles. The reason lies in the use of electric power to start the car. When engineers use the free wheel to start a car, it's as if children are riding a bicycle, starting and stopping as they please, very freely. It's truly amazing. In addition, the free wheel has many advantages too numerous to list. Today, we will select the most important points to tell our readers. Taking the Huppmobile as an example, since using the free wheel, one type of six-cylinder car and four types of eight-cylinder straight-edge cars have adopted the free wheel. As a result of using the free wheel in these new cars, test results show that lubricating oil is saved by 18% and gasoline is saved by more than 12%. In addition, the friction of the mechanical parts on the car body is also greatly reduced. This is all because the necessary movement of the clutch can be reduced by 30% to 60% with the use of the free wheel. Moreover, the safety plans adopted by free wheel cars provide drivers with safety and convenience, leaving nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>Free wheel cars can save so much lubricating oil and gasoline because the engines used in the past continued to run even after the throttle was closed, resulting in wasted fuel. Now, except when moving slowly, at 10, 25, or 30 miles per hour, the engine continues to run, but after the throttle is closed, it can stop rotating. Once the free wheel is used on a new car, all vibrations can be completely eliminated. As for rear-end collisions, which are common in ordinary vehicles, they can be avoided in free wheel cars. This is because sudden opening or closing of the throttle can cause shocks to the mechanical parts of ordinary vehicles. Under these circumstances, tire wear can definitely be reduced, as can the wear of the car body. In addition, free wheel cars have another important advantage. Hupp Motor Car Company's various new cars, such as the Century eight-cylinder and six-cylinder new cars, as well as the G, H, and U series new cars, are equipped with free wheels. Even when using second gear, driving is convenient and easy, silent and still.</p>
<p>Taking Hupp Motor Car Company's various new cars equipped with free wheels as an example, their construction principles are quite simple and have no special features. The only difference from ordinary vehicles is that the movement of the clutch in free wheel cars is very convenient. No matter what speed is used, they can move and change each other. This is because in ordinary vehicles, to reduce speed, you must first downshift to a low speed and then shift from low speed to second gear. But free wheel cars are different. Shifting from second gear to the highest speed or from the highest speed to second gear can be done directly, without using the clutch. Under these circumstances, the vehicle's forward momentum will be sufficient to control the engine's forward power. However, if a vehicle does not use a free wheel, gear shifting must require the use of a clutch. This shows that free wheel vehicles are very easy to drive. Therefore, drivers who have used Hupp Motor Car Company's various free wheel new cars are all very satisfied. All movements during driving can be silent, providing drivers with great convenience. Today's automobiles are considered superior if they can operate at the highest speed silently and smoothly. Drivers certainly know this. But since Hupp Motor Car Company introduced free wheel vehicles to society, second gear has also achieved amazing results. This new type of second gear uses a three-part speed method, and its main advantage is silence, and gear changes are even more convenient and easy.</p>
<p>The clutches made in Huppmobile free wheel new cars are of the overrun or one-way type. These clutches allow the vehicle to move forward automatically at about six to eight miles per hour, regardless of whether the gear is the fastest or the next fastest. The clutch operates as if a child is riding a bicycle. For this reason, various Hupp new cars can save gasoline, lubricating oil, and all other expenses when moving, and are more economical. The transmission systems of old-fashioned vehicles are almost regarded as antiques. In crowded places, sometimes when rushing into traffic and starting to drive, free wheel vehicles only need to fully depress the accelerator, and even when the engine stops, the vehicle continues to move forward. Even when driving fast on the road, it is quite convenient to stop the vehicle. The vehicle's own power can also be used to brake. Lowering the accelerator immediately increases the engine speed. Drivers who want to squeeze into the center of traffic in a busy city only need to move the shift lever without touching the clutch to shift to the highest gear. The shift lever only needs to be returned to the third position without touching the clutch. Past results have proven that the movement of the clutch on free wheel cars can be reduced by 30% to 60%. This alone demonstrates the economy of materials and the saving of manpower. Therefore, free wheel new cars can save fuel and reduce the number of repairs, and have been widely welcomed by the automotive industry since their introduction. It is expected that there will be even greater developments soon. We can wait and see.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Miscellaneous News on Road Administration in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Qian</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is making rapid progress in road administration, so its achievements are far ahead of other provinces. In the recent month, whether it's separate rectifications, restrictions on fares, surveying routes, or approving the establishment of branch stations, it feels meticulous. Other measures such as revising the license issuance method and urging the payment of road maintenance donations are gradually improving. This cannot be said to be anything other than the result of the attention of the road administration authorities. I will now present the findings of my investigation separately.</p>
<p>▲Separate Rectification of Car Services on the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Section  The Zhejiang Construction Department believes that the highway on the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section has been quite developed in recent years, but due to the failure to effectively rectify it, road services have gradually deteriorated and passengers feel inconvenienced. Recently, the Shaoxing County Construction Committee proposed to expedite the rectification of road services on the Xiaoshan-Shaoxing section, mainly in three aspects: First, the Road Bureau should extend the ticket window opening hours as appropriate and supervise the road police stationed at the station to maintain order when purchasing tickets. Passengers can line up according to the order of arrival at the station when purchasing tickets, with those arriving first purchasing first, so as to avoid congestion. Second, the Road Bureau should strictly order drivers and station staff to thoroughly inspect the vehicles before each departure. The number of monthly inspections should also be stipulated in peacetime. Once it is discovered that the mechanical parts are slightly damaged, they must be repaired as soon as possible, so that the vehicles will not become irreparable due to minor damage. Third, section cars should be appropriately added depending on the traffic conditions along the route to provide relief. As for the broken car windows and passengers being exposed to wind and rain from time to time, although the matter is small, it greatly affects the people's impression of the Road Bureau and should be repaired as soon as possible to facilitate travel. In addition, it is also appropriate to wash the vehicles and mark the station names. The county has already submitted a request to the Provincial Construction Department to order the Highway Bureau to expedite the rectification of the various aspects in order to improve the situation.</p>
<p>▲Restrictions on Increasing Fares on Various Road Sections The Zhejiang Construction Department recently received a report from the Highway Bureau stating that the prices of various materials have been increasing recently, and the surplus in business revenue has suddenly decreased. It is proposed to slightly increase the fare prices on various road sections to compensate for the losses. A mileage table of various road sections, a table of current fares at various stations, and a table of proposed fare increases in the future were attached to the report. The Construction Department believes that building roads and operating vehicles is originally intended to facilitate transportation, but upon checking the increased fares, many are increased by 70%, and the lowest is also 80% or 90%. The amount seems to be too high, which is not conducive to considering the people's financial capacity. Moreover, most of the vehicles on various road sections are damaged, and passengers feel greatly inconvenienced. The Highway Bureau is strictly ordered to comply with the previous orders and effectively rectify the situation. The proposed fare increase will be reviewed and handled after the rectification is completed and the vehicles on various road sections are replenished.</p>
<p>▲Ningbo Branch Station Postponed Establishment  The Ningbo Merchants' Organization Unification Committee and the Fenghua County Merchants' Organization Unification Committee telegraphed the Provincial Highway Bureau, reporting the plan to fill in the moat and add a bus station. A request was submitted to the Provincial Government to quickly order the cancellation of the original proposal in order to facilitate transportation. The Provincial Government then ordered the Provincial Construction Department to investigate and verify the matter and report back. It is recently learned that Shen Guang, the director of the Ningbo-Fenghua Car Service Office appointed by the Highway Bureau, jointly verified the matter with the Ningbo Municipal Government. According to the report, the part of the planned moat filling was originally the wharf for inland waterway vessels in Yin County. If it is filled to be used as a base, the original wharf will inevitably have to be moved westward. As a result, the distance for merchant ships to load and unload goods will be slightly longer, which will inevitably have a slight impact. The local citizens oppose filling the river for this reason. Near the Yuling Bridge Gate, if another station is to be built, there is no suitable location except for the vacant land that the Municipal Government has already put up for auction. Moreover, the value of the vacant land auctioned by the Ningbo Municipal Government is about 25,000 yuan per acre. The current value of funds</p>

<p>is depleted, and there is no spare capacity to purchase land for the time being. Therefore, the establishment of the station is proposed to be postponed. The Construction Department, upon receiving the reply, ordered that it be temporarily postponed and ordered the Yin County Magistrate to inform and notify accordingly and report back to the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>▲Surveying of the Songyang-Suichang and Songyang-Lishui Routes  Regarding the proposal by the Songyang County Government Construction Section to open and complete the Songyang-Suichang and Songyang-Lishui roads within three years, the Provincial Construction Department previously ordered the Provincial Highway Bureau to send personnel to survey the routes in advance. It was also deemed difficult to approve the proposal to allocate a certain percentage of the county's construction special donation each year as road construction funds. The Songyang County Magistrate was ordered to propose other fundraising methods and submit them for review. It is recently learned that the Highway Bureau has ordered Lu Rui, an assistant engineer from the Huang Le Jian surveying team, to go to survey the routes. The two routes are 185 li long in total and pass through many mountains and cross many large streams. The project is arduous, and the required funds are estimated to be more than 1.3 million yuan. Since these routes are not connected to the Longyou-Xixiao-Changshan Railway, business development is difficult to expect. Engineer Lu also surveyed the Suichang-Longyou section as an attachment. The Provincial Construction Department ordered the Songyang County Magistrate to keep the original report and investigation table for reference. As for the construction costs of the two roads, they must still be handled in accordance with the Construction Department's orders.</p>
<p>▲Revision of the Long-Distance Bus License Issuance Method  The Zhejiang Construction Department recently received an order from the Ministry of Railways stating that the regulations for issuing licenses to long-distance bus companies were promulgated by the Ministry on September 5, 1920, and the reporting formats were formulated. A request was submitted to the Executive Yuan for recordation. The Executive Yuan then issued directives No. 2710 and No. 3350, along with the Ministry's previous submission of the revised long-distance bus company license issuance regulations for recordation. The revised long-distance bus company license issuance regulations and formats are hereby copied and distributed for your information. The Construction Department has already revised the long-distance bus company license issuance regulations and formats, copied and distributed them, and notified the county magistrates, the Provincial Highway Bureau, and the various long-distance bus companies operated by merchants.</p>
<p>▲Locomotives Have Been Tested on the Xiaoshan-Changshan Railway  Locomotives have been tested on the Xiaoshan-Changshan Railway. Residents along the route flocked to watch. From now on, vehicles will transport materials more frequently. The general public is ignorant of the dangers. A slight carelessness will result in casualties to people and livestock, and the vehicles and roadbeds will also be damaged. For the sake of caution, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Engineering Bureau listed the items that should be prohibited as follows: (1) Residents along the line should strictly control children and not place stones or other obstacles on the tracks. Violators will be detained. (2) The stone ballast placed on the railway is not allowed to be moved. Violators will be punished. (3) All livestock must not be grazed on the railway. Violators will be heavily fined. (4) The screws, sleepers, and track numbers on the railway are of utmost importance. It is absolutely forbidden to tamper with or steal them. Violators will be ordered to be investigated by the village chief. (5) All ships passing under the railway bridge must proceed slowly. If there is a collision with the piling, the ships should be detained and fined. (6) It is absolutely forbidden for pedestrians to walk on the railway. (7) When pedestrians cross the tracks, they must follow the crosswalks set up by the Road Bureau and pay attention to whether there are trains coming and going. If they hear the whistle, they should immediately move away. It is reported that the Zhejiang Construction Department also believes that this matter concerns the safety of the railway and the people, and has ordered the county to inform the residents of the various villages and neighborhoods along the line not to court disaster.</p>
