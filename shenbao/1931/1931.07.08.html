<p>— 海客</p>
<p>時髦女子的單眼鏡</p>
<p>近代愛時髦的女子。都不喜歡戴眼鏡。以爲戴眼鏡是不時髦的表示。所以有許多時髦女子。即使雙眼近視。伊們也勉强的與人周旋。决不肯乞靈於眼鏡的。然而英國的交際社會。在一九二九年間。竟流行一種單眼鏡。一般時髦的女子。都有一個單眼鏡架在眼上。全是本色的玻璃。據說可以增添美觀。但是在眼上架上一個單眼鏡。很不容易。偶不經心。往往會掉落下來。所以伊們不得不小心翼翼提防着。倒像多了一椿心事哩。考查單眼鏡的歷史。最初發見於一八一五年。奥京維也納的國會中。有一位外交家。是第一個戴這單眼鏡的。以後歐洲各國的紳士與美少年。都紛紛效學。想不到一百餘年後。竟又成了英國時髦女子的裝飾品。</p>
<p>匪徒的世界語</p>
<p>世界中無論那一國的好宄小人。都有他們一種特有的言語。局外人是不知道的。中國的下流社會。也是如此。稱爲切口。現在歐洲有一般聰明的匪徒。新發明一種國際通用的言語。專給他們應用。因爲他們的黨中。有英法美德意西班牙葡萄牙希臘諸國的人。彼此言語不通。異常不便。所以非有一種通用的世界語不可。最近因破獲了一起要案。發見一本記事簿。纔知道有這種新發明的匪徒的世界語。據說近年來有好多件没有破獲的疑案。都是這匪黨的傑作。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>甘肅情奇重。民不聊生。甚至食榆皮　首蓿以果腹。五年以來。天災人禍。交相逼迫。因僻處邊陲。道路險阻。辦賑人員。裹足不前。兼之久伏軍閥積威之下。形格勢禁。呼籲無門。災情真相。未能盡情披露。公諸國人。至爲痛心。近有舊雨某君由甘來申。出示其所作食榆皮　苜蓿等近著。一字一涙。令人不忍卒讀。轉錄本談。代爲宣傳。想亦仁人君子所樂許也。</p>
<p>（食榆皮）食榆皮。療貧饑。或如焙香茗。分片碎紫芝。或如磨炒麫。烙餅勝肉糜。刀刮榆樹霜刃滋。植物知若有知。剥膚忍痛肉許剜。聊餬民口益民脂。飢腸雷鳴轆轤轉。一日偎樹十二時。老榆偃蹇撑骨幹。捨身濟人無復辭。匠作不顧掉頭去。笑榆滿身生瘡痍。榆不能言對以砍。樹稍摇動臨風嘶。匠作笑我愚。我笑匠作痴。我不但甘蛻皮肉供人嚼。還散青蚨扶人危。樹猶如此人胡及。反唇相譏鍼砭施。痼疾不將驕吝醫。多藏厚亡天難欺。忍心不作慈惠師。衆窮獨富理豈宜。食桃梗。恣諧謔。姑忘言之忘聽之。榆方鳴得意。我聞淚如絲。必待有財方濟世。千倉萬箱何日副虚期。必待有位方救國。輔世長民何賴儒士爲。莫若隨兮恤急難。推食解衣周癃疲。寸縷尺布雙弓米。積善餘慶夫奚疑。君不見馬馱千鈞蟻一粒。各盡心力無欠虧。莫笑老榆摇錢樹。老榆反將錢癖嗤。天風浪浪榆錢落。朝朝暮暮哺窮兒。窮兒嬉。折樹枝。樹枝折盡血滬垂。磨刀霍霍趨樹下。日朘月削起　羸。起　羸。療貧飢。療貧飢。食榆皮。（　苜宿）洮西難婦　苜蓿。女伴三五謀果腹。漢田荒蕪回田馥。飢來驅我紛相逐。苜蓿一斤錢百六。回民珍惜同麥菽。阻止不能施鞭扑。奪鑱踏籠相報速。難婦奔竄號且哭。就中年妻僵且伏。（年生桂妻傷重不起）老拳毒手任怒蹴。血癊片片暈骨肉。傷重難望元氣復。死生不知在溝瀆。貧民護食誰怨讟。最恨田主糧滿屋。古人仁恩及草木。今人吝色見饘粥。衆貧獨富九年蓄。爲富不仁嫩積福。我聞髮指削尺牘。力請縣官懲豪族。要令飢民得養育。毋使貪人屯谿谷。飢溺縈懷閱信宿。賦詩未半涙盈掬。將來持歸告司牧。料知鼻酸不忍讀。</p>

<p>年來海上舞潮勃興。每當華燈初上。俊侣雲集。音樂聲裏。翩𦒘起舞。互抱腰支。緊握香臂。此樂陶陶。固非局外人所得而知也。惟自此風盛行。大好青年。沉迷其中者。實繁有徒。一輩妖姬蕩婦。溷跡其間。施其勾引之手腕。顛倒衆生。盡入彀中。從此娱樂之塲。一變而爲銷金魔窟。傾囊失業。時有所聞。鴛鴦折翼。危機四伏。在當局者。紙醉金迷。胡天胡帝。豈知一刹那間。巳墮落至於不可拔。有心人惄焉憂之。近聞明星影片公司攝製之有聲片「如此天堂」即以舞塲爲背景而深切描寫之發人深省。起人迷夢。實爲有裨世道人心之作。大可爲一般迷戀舞塲者之黨頭捧喝也</p>

<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>自來我們貴國最講究「衛生學」的。要算是孔二先生。你想他老人家「沽酒巿脯不食」。對於飲食口腹。何等慎重。因爲買來的食物。往往烹調失宜。蚊蠅叢集。難免不清潔。還是不食爲妙。所以俗語有句話。呌做「眼勿見爲淨」。倘然使你親眼見了。包敎你摇首縐眉。難以下咽。還委實有些可怕咧。現在在下把那「可怕」的情形。隨便寫了幾則出來。也無非使人們在暑天中的吃。須格外注意。那一般經營飲食店的老　。對於衛生上的設備。總要刻意改進。切不可冥頑不靈。糊塗從事。做那「間接的殺人」纔好。</p>
<p>燒鴨中的活物　前天在午膳的時候。到一家敎門館裏添了一樣燒鴨。雖則是色慾過度的鴨。但細細咀嚼。倒也饒有餘味。不料吃了過半。忽見湯汁中蠕蠕而動。仔細一看。原來是活蛆。這一來可大煞風景。忙把箸擱住。飯也不吃了。肚子裏還鬧着不安。至於這蛆從何而來呢當然這鴨和那帶着赤化的蒼蠅。發生過戀愛。那蠅除了播送微菌之外。還要産生白色的子。這子經過數小時。或經陽光照射。就會化成蛆。那店裏事前旣不知預防。事後又熟視無覩。依舊售給人家。你想可恨不可恨。</p>
<p>特别龍虎菜　我記得去年的夏天。一晚。和幾位朋友到一家著名的館子聚餐。大家任意大嚼。興致不淺。後來湯炒完了。端上了清燉全鴨。都喫得津津有味。那知湯中忽發見一隻壁虎。衆人不覺驚駭起來。就喚了辦事人來責問。說這壁虎燉鴨。倒從未嘗過。那人連聲謝罪。還扣除鴨的價錢。纔算了事。在下還揷趣道。廣州食品。有龍鳳會。龍虎菜。這壁虎其形如龍。其名曰虎。可名之曰特别龍虎菜。</p>
<p>冬菇生起脚來了　一天我和一位朋友到素菜館裏果腹。呌的是冬菇麫。那位朋友架起老光眼鏡。吃得津津有味。最後他鉗了一隻冬菇。正要望口裏送。忽然呆住了。喊道。冬菇生起脚來了。我朝它一望。原來是一隻很大的蟑螂。那朋友就向堂倌問道。這麫是葷的。還是素的。堂倌很誠懇的答道。這裏葷不入内。當然是素的。那朋友道。旣然是素的。爲何加這東西在内呢。我的眼光向來照碼對折。當它是隻冬菇。難道你們的廚子也同我一樣嗎。那堂倌無話可說。連聲對不住。在下笑道。冬菇生脚。倒是素館中的笑話。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>上海市政府昨日舉行新屋奠基典禮於巿中心區域。斯爲大上海計劃建設之發軔。其紀念之含有深長意義。自不待言。愚亦趨車往觀。一睹其　况。由公園靶子塲經西體育會路·翔殷路·淞滬路·進三民路以達會塲。距滬巿十餘里。車行四十分鐘可達。路旁所植樹木。蔚然成行。青　可愛。路面舖以煤屑。尚稱平匀。寛度與南京路相埒。將扺塲。見城牆式之牌樓。東西兩座遥遥相對。頗爲壯觀。入口之右爲來賓簽名處。招待員贈以本報本期畫報（因載有大上海影片）及上海市巿中心區域計劃概要各一份。前進爲會場。搭大蓆棚一座。可容三千人。左右搭中西賓招待室各一座。場之東設衛生處及職員休息室。其西　二室。陳列大上海計劃各種圖樣及模型。製作精美。規劃周詳。集美術家工程家悉心盡力不知費幾許心血之結晶品。巳非易事。然此後謀實現各種計劃。其所費之精神與物質。必將十百倍於斯耳。</p>
<p>十時奏樂開會。中外來賓。士女如雲。不下兩千餘人。上賓羣集主席臺。普通來賓及巿府職員均鵠立臺前。靜聆偉論。惟以淫雨初晴。積水盈寸。塲内所舖蘆蓆。幾盡爲汚水所沾。西側數處。水深及踝。某君呼之曰西湖。可知立足之難矣。行禮後張巿長致開會詞。頗爲懇摯。希望巿中心區域能變一片荒凉土而成繁榮之巿集。故凡大上海計劃中之行政。工商業。水陸交通之碼頭。車站。莫不參照各國都巿之設施。以期適應現代之潮流與巿民之需要。并謂巿中心區爲全上海之中樞。應合全上海市民之心力以赴之。始克奏功。言次頗稱述前巿長黄膺白氏對此計劃之熱心。欲其有一言以爲幸。黄氏遂於工務局長沈怡氏報告籌備經過之後。登壇演說。通篇議論。亦莊亦諧。最引起全塲之同情。彼謂上海三百萬人口之衆。與新疆一省相等。謂上海地位之重要。乃長江之門户。東南之屏幛。商港軍港。兩種資格。兼而具之。謂租界之繁盛。譽之者曰。此乃歐西文明之媒介物。毁之者曰。是中國肺病之結核菌。於八十年來租界腐敗之現象。洞燭無遺。對大上海希望。不僅物質上之設施。而在文化·道德·風紀·秩序等精神方面之成功。末謂余在巿長任。爲時至暫。所擬計劃。都歸泡影。一紙空談。等於銀行發行之空頭鈔票。幸而張巿長能維持信用。實行兌現。致令全場粲然。次虞洽卿·葉恭綽·王曉籟諸氏演說。王謂上海租界巳有八十餘年歷史。譬諸老弱無用之人。巿政府纔四周歲。將來的是有爲青年。前程無量。對大上海計劃。希望巿長總其成。各局長及企業界·金融界助其成丶人民促其成。三言兩語。亦甚中聽。至是舉行奠基。巿長執巿中心區圖樣。計劃概要。該區建設委員業務報告等書七八種。密封紫銅匣内。嵌藏基石之中。徐徐安放基石。而大典告成焉。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良看了，不免驚異，當真在百葉炒肉絲的項下，材料裏頭，有醋的一項，并且的確寫着一兩，醋的用法，也很詳細。子良當然不解了，他看了好久，方始發見一個奥妙。</p>
<p>「你的講義，怎麽第四十五頁，接下去便是第四十七頁呢？」</p>
<p>夫人聽了，目光閃閃，似乎也很奇怪，伊自巳再過來細看，確是缺了頁第四十六。</p>
<p>「盡信書，則不如無書，你的死用講義，真可以！它缺了一頁丶你還當它寳貝似的用着。第四十五頁上，載着的百葉炒肉絲，只有三行，下面接到第四十七頁上去，不知講些什麽，你牛頭不對馬嘴時也凑到百葉炒肉絲上去，加了醋，自然不能吃了。」</p>
<p>「誰想得到會缺一頁？」</p>
<p>二人將就吃完了飯，子良不敢躭擱，洗洗臉，拏了幾根牙籤，又上樓去了。到底剛才吃飯，不便立刻就就伏在桌上做事，且休息休息，養養精神，如果在樓下，也無非被伊纒擾而巳，所以姑且逃到自巳的田園裏來。</p>
<p>他上來之後，想喝一杯茶；但是不高興再回到樓下去了，打算呌娘姨送上來呢？又恐怕夫人要自巳送來，所以還是不喝罷。</p>
<p>他在亭子間裏很小的地方，隨意踱踱，有時坐下來，桌上拏一本書看看，他忽然想起：今天的報紙呢？怎麽没有送上來？他也不願意問，多一事不如少一事，只好不看了。</p>
<p>歇了一回，他要入手工作了，研濃了墨，動筆咧。上半天，被伊時常來鬧，鬧得只改好了三本，還有一百六十本左右，今天那裏趕得完？正在這個時候，樓梯上有脚聲，夫人又來了，只見伊手裏拏着一本新的簿子。</p>

<p>— 德新</p>
<p>予於汽車之學。經歷至淺。惟予性甚酷好。故從事於汽車之研究。及學習。除在上海一汽車專科學校習課爲時不及全年外。其他即無甚多機會能與汽車專家朝習研磨矣。</p>
<p>今幸本年五月十八日上海浦東福特汽車公司。有服務學校之設丶予得美通盧經理之紹介。得入該校作比較實際之訓練。雖爲時不久。而所獲益不少。是則不得不感謝敎師余騰茅先生及福特公司豐富之設備。並及盧經理之熱忱介紹也。今兹略述在校六週之經過。及種種美備熱忱之訓練。以告樂聞汽車新聞諸君。</p>
<p>中國於汽車事業。根本尚談不到。所有需用車輛。除向歐美定購外。毫無他法可得此電馳雲湧之交通利器。因之外國之汽車製造廠家。安閑踏步垂手而得此東方一大巿塲。故凡有血性之國人丶睹此交通神品。而又無法挽救中。能不奮興急起。以冀中國車廠之實現。而挽此不景氣者乎。此予所以棄執鞭之業。蹈此黑暗中而冀摩索有得也。國内旣無良好設施。退而不得不仰求外人商業化之技術學校。此猶吾國學校敎育發軔時西人敎會學校給與影響爲多也。上海一隅。歐美汽車廠家。來此求售者固不少。尤以美國之福特廠來吾國。設廠規模。經營銷售。恐將稱第一位置。最近且有來華設廠製造之提議。因而宣傳方面與車主服務方面。修理配件方面。訓練技術人材方面。均有整個完備之計劃。以應社會種種需要。此所以有服務學校之設。專以訓練各經理處巳有宏富經騐之技師。而敎以新式福特正當修理方法。正當使用特殊工具。及正確瞭解福特工程師種種設計之規劃和原理。並告以經理福特之方法。管理廠地之法則。故不收學雜諸費。除不另給工資一事外。與該廠工人一律用同樣方法管理進退之。但須各有關係之廠家介紹。以能嚴守該廠規則而有相當車務知識者始允入學</p>
<p>余騰芳先生粤人。在美專研究汽車學近十年。並在福特廠服務丶其後任該廠工程師多年。近今派回中國爲在中國之福特廠旅行代表。兼服務學校敎師。先生性情。恢諧活潑。熱忱過人。每日八小時之指導。從無倦容。雖異常忙碌。而口講指畫不絶也。其於學理技術均非常熱練。炯非或僅能高談闊論。片面只諳工作手術者可比。故學者一切問題均可獲得極滿意之回答。兹分述在學情形如下。</p>
<p>（一）入廠與出廠　每日晨七時半。趁大來公司義務輪渡由黄浦灘海關碼頭接送至浦東大來碼頭。而福特公司即在大來公司左側。入廠時須佩出標記以示閽者。並在計出入之時鐘機下記出各人卡片之出入時刻。隨即入更衣間改易工服。而八點一刻之上工喇叭鳴矣。每次均由余師點名。本級約同學三十左右。均由四方負笈來此。有在汽車界服七八年。及二三年者不等。亦有不甚了了者。故其結果自亦不佳。十二時出廠午餐。時間僅限三十分鐘。故巷匆促。飯后工作直至午後四點半。沐手更衣。四點三刻循例在卡片上記出廠時刻。仍趁大來小輪回浦西。如是者每週除星六星期休假外。實際工作五日。而每日工作八小時無稍休息懈怠。除立蹲外無椅凳以資息坐。縱須記錄亦只能曲膝俯腰而爲之。每日衣履手臉爲油汚所敝。自不待言。然於廠地機械工具則非注意清理整齊不可。故每日出廠前。須詳爲掃除。並用帚清潔焉。因而每晨入廠所見。均極清爽豁目。有如新起設置而從無人在此工作過者。即此清潔一項余師不憚再四叮嚀。</p>
<p>（二）廠房及設備　學校範圍不及全廠十六分之一。度其面積在十五平方丈以内。内置福特生發電機一部。爲本部一切電量之來源。舉凡室内一切機械。均置戴那莫一具充電發動之。如以下各件均隨件備置。如壓氣機。汽缸車床。凡爾修理機。釘車制片機。磨車制片機。磨石機。騐舊式變壓器機。騐電機等外並置升車機。引擎修理架。承後輪軸架。油壓機。充電機。鋼工作台。及應用工具五大櫃。滿貯修理新舊式客車貨車種種特殊工具。據聞所有工具及機械約值華幣二萬以上。此所儲用具專爲學校所用。與世界任何一福特修理廠均相同。而在中國則僅只此一套最爲完全。如有亲法問世。必有一具寄來備用也。</p>
<p>（三）實習與修理　先發給每人一册福特配件目錄（中央文合印）令學者熟識各件名目。及新式福特管理備要一册。第一二日將所備引擎分組折上。以熟悉各件配置情形。因來學者均早有相當準備。故一二次折上巳得具體概念矣。第三日由廠外交來新式客車一輛。巳行一萬六千英里以上。此即爲實習修理之絶好對像。旣置升車機後。將引擎發動。敎以騐病種種手續。然後逐部折除。先騐引擎部份。即此一部引擎經詳密之檢騐與修理竟達十日。所有任何部份。均經千分之一之檢騐。如某部規定在千分之三以内即須修理。或加鑄合金。或增加襯片。或換新時。均按照法定手續依次修正添置之。至折上時雖一扳頭之微。必以法定某式扳頭以資折上。均絲毫不准假借掉換。决非巿間以一活動扳頭即認爲萬能可比也。而折上時除一般習知必須扳頭螺絲力外種種用具甚多。總之所以用具如此其繁者無非爲折上便利。省時减力。尤以不傷機件爲主要目的。該車共計汽缸車大千分之五以上。活塞及活塞環凡爾均部份換新。其他如電系方面之充電·換線·修發電機等。散熟系之調節。換新汽油系油系之檢騐清潔與調節。以及車架車制均詳爲查騐修理。凡有銹蝕處均噴漆補之。如是者三星期。除外觀光鑑方面有遜於新車外。至機件内部據余師言與新車無異。並謂有時外間修理固可不必如此費事。且亦不必如此精審。但在真正福特修理廠即不可稍事馬虎對待車主也。此車出廠後。再行逐步折除修上另一車上。應有之各部份一週。並詳細指示原理設計尺寸以資熟練。凡有問題均在此兩星期間質問。有時表列於小黑牌上。學者每於講述重要處。輒以鉛筆記下。故無須一般黑板講桌式之講授矣。如稍不注意。即失此筆記機會。蓋余師講述無一定時間無一定地方。且旣講后輒不欲重講。故非隨時留心不可。偶一婉言申請。未始不見余師又滔滔重述也。</p>
<p>（四）試騐及參觀　各課旣畢。即以一不良於發動之貨車令學者檢騐修理。以善於發動爲止。此段工夫爲余師故意弄出許多病症以試學生者。作時余師但笑而言。由指定之人負責修正之。爲最有興趣之一段學程也。其次爲口問口答。凡關於過去巳敎之修理手續及口講之一切規定。依次立對每人輪流數題。</p>
<p>又某曰。講汽車歷史及福特廠内種種情形。始悉其計劃之偉大。設置之美備。不禁咋舌。並映放福特特製告我人如何經理其營業與種種推銷法。惜福特本廠工作一片巳運往漢口未得窺其全豹。所見影片中亦有一段如流水般的引擎從引道運出以備琢磨。工具盤旋空際如空中跳舞隨手取用。無奔馳之苦。宜乎本年四月份其車出廠竟達十二萬一千餘部。入學時由余師導引參觀廠内零件儲藏所。分新舊客貨各部。木工部。漆鬆部。製電池部。廠内人員。部份雖不繁瑣而秩然有序。整潔可風。最後一日並導往上海經理福特之美通公司各部參觀以資印證。參觀畢即告結束亦即師友分道揚鏖握别之日也。出廠前人佩福特服務學校紀念章一。並授予福特公司發給證明書。爲時雖短。而師友間依戀之情大有不忍握别之意。良以余師學識豐厚。有時雖於滑稽譏笑中而不憚煩關照。條分縷析。足令我人難忘其熱心誠摯也。因是某晚曾邀部份同學於大東聚餐攝影。以誌不忘。</p>

<p>— 學遷</p>
<p>察哈爾省。地接外蒙。爲通庫倫之要道。其汽車事業。向巳盛行。其最著者。一爲張庫線。即由張家口至庫倫。長約二千七百餘里。一爲張多線。即由張家口至多倫。長約六百里。祇因草地遼闊。一望無垠。中間又無山河之修阻。亦鮮工程之可言。即昔日之京張大道。（自舊都北京至張家口）長約四百餘里。在軍事時期。曾行走汽車。因與平綏鐵路平行。此路早巳失修。無車行駛矣。自民國十七年秋。察省荒旱　。無法拯卹。當局爲謀救濟災民起見。爰有以工代賑之法。而遂有全省省道路網之計劃。並擬定施工辦法。呈請省府備案。通飭各縣照辦。十八年察建廳組織測量隊。實測重要幹線。是年秋間。各縣大都開工興築。以迄十九年末。曾完成第一期幹線之宜蔚路。以後倘路欵有著。不難次第實現。最近更擬定省區施工辦法十則。亦可見察省對於興築省之孟晋矣。兹將省道路網施工辦法二端。分誌如次。</p>
<p>省道路網　據察建廳所擬計劃。共分四期。其第一期爲幹路。一爲宣蔚線。由宣化經深井化稍營兩鎮至蔚縣之西河營長一百七十八里。二爲宣獨線。由宣化經龍赤兩縣達獨石長二百七十里。三爲獨沽綫。由獨石口至沽原綫。爲内地入蒙鎮之第一綫。長六十里。其第二期爲幹線。一爲陽化線。由陽原縣至化稍營與宜蔚線相接。長八十里。二爲新化線。由化稍營經壞安縣横逾平綏路之柴溝堡沿以至新平口。爲由内地入蒙旗之第二線。三爲涿園線。由涿鹿至平綏路之下花園車站。長三十五里。四爲康慶線。由平綏路之康莊車站至延慶縣。長四十里。其第三期支線有二。一爲張康支線。由張北縣至康保縣。長二百里。二爲法商支線丶由法原經寳昌康保兩縣以至商邱縣。長四百五十里。其第四期支線有四。一爲涿蔚支線。由涿鹿經桃花堡西河營蔚縣至山西之廣靈縣。長二百三十里。二爲龍壞支線。由龍關至土木與平海路銜接。長一百里。三爲蔚縣支線。由蔚縣至陽原縣。長九十里。四爲陽鎮支線丶由陽原至山西之天鎮線。長九十里。大抵察省全省汽車路。有二千零一十三華里内幹路八百五十三里。支路一千一百六十五里。境内有桑乾河洋河兩大河流。故大橋有六。需欵甚多。預計全省省道建築費。約需三百六十一萬餘元。雖分四期依次興築。但因經費尚未籌妥。故未定年限。僅於十九年賑欵十二萬元。完成宣蔚縣之橋樑涵洞及石工。在路端當有數座橋涵未修。本年春繼續興工。此路不久即能全綫通車矣。</p>
<p>施工辦法　蘇省建設廳擬訂公路施工辦法十則。（一）建築蘇省公路工程之標準。其概要有九。甲路面寛度。幹路以八公尺以上。支路以六公尺以上爲標準。洩水溝及植樹地。須兩旁各再留二公尺。若地易徵收。愈寛愈好。除各種車輛行駛外。人行道兩旁。亦須計劃五公尺。公路面材料先築固堅之沙土路。以後觀交通之情形改舖石子路。路之中線高過路之兩邊。平一尺至一尺半爲標準。丙路線有高低不一之處。須填高或掘低。兩旁斜度。定爲高以尺。斜開一尺。或一尺半。須按地質而定。丁坡度。遇山嶺崎嶇之地。最大坡度。亦不得過百分之六。戊路基建築。須逐層平舖。原不得過八寸。一層填匀後。再舖第二層。俟到一定之高度爲止。巳方向。路之方向。最貴取正直平坦之線。到不得巳時。寗屈曲而務平坦。亦不就譾陋之最大坡度。庚彎度。爲路途修養及運輸之便利與安全起見。最小半徑以一百公尺爲限。辛溝渠。道路兩旁均宜築洩水明溝。底寛一。尺斜度百一比一。至沿山麓之處。視山勢之大小而定之。壬橋梁涵洞。務須依水流之大小而定之。應以水泥或木石造成。以取一勞永逸之計。且免行車危險。（二）關於全省公路之線之勘測。及橋梁涵洞圖樣之擬定。均由本廳派員負責辦理。（三）修築全省公路之橋樑涵洞。其工廠統由省庫担任撥付。（四）修築公路關於土工者。如挖土墊泥者。概由路線經過各縣之全民衆担任。近村出工。遠村出錢。至工作之分配。與出錢之標準。應由各縣政府會同各機關籌商。擬訂呈報備查。（五）担任的築公路之民工。僅給火食。得折發現金。其數目由各縣酌量情形規定之。但至多每工不得超過二角。（六）民工工作用具。除特種工具由公家預借外。普通工具。概由民夫自備。（七）民夫担任之築路工作。由各縣政府督率建設局負指揮監工之全責。並隨時由本廳派員查勘。如遇有煩難重要工作隨時糾察之。（八）本省各縣修築汽車道。應佔用之民有土地。依　頒土地徵收法第四條之規定。永遠租用。其辦法另定之。（九）本辦法如有未盡事宜。得隨時呈請省政府修改之。（十）本辦法得呈本省政府核准後公布施行。</p>

<p>汽車自聞世以來。巴黎緣組設汽車展覽會。遂得汽車新奇風氣之先。是項展覽會。創設巳逾二十五年。每次開會。非僅徒顯其壯麗美觀之盛舉。尚極端發揮其在汽車巿場中之主人翁地位。國外汽車製造家。雖明知是意。欲取而代之。顯有不能。則每次開會。有不得不躬逢其盛之概。於是其會場所展覽汽車之種類。殆集全世界之所有。斯巴黎汽車展覽會。所以稱謂世界汽車展覽會也。至於各處之汽車展覽會。始倫敦·柏林·紐約等。僅各陳列各該地汽車製造家之出品而巳。外人鮮有參預者。今年紐約汽車展覽會。即如是。法人之參加者僅一家。返觀巴黎最近之汽車展覽會。洵不可以同日語之。外人參預之熱烈。實不亞於法人本身。推其故。實由於多數觀衆之心理。成認巴黎爲世界汽車先進之邦。展覽各車。定能饜觀。故不殫遠道。聯袂一覩當年世界出品。以新耳目。其俗風如是。因此各國之汽車製造家爲競爭營業計。亦無不有不參加者。且所這展覽之車。必預爲鈎心鬭角。其視重有如是。並在展覽會期内。制造汽車家。每施其手腕。推銷其本廠出品於私人主顧。或代售汽車商。或經售汽車公司等。更有價值可述者。巴黎汽車展覽會實能左右全世界汽車製造家。縱其製造計劃本年業巳確定。或未確定。或正在進行中者。自展覽閉會後。必重定其製造步　。俾免其出品有所滯銷。斯巴黎汽車展覽會。所以不愧推爲世界汽車市塲也。</p>

<p>— 吳展農</p>
<p>李恩紹·吳漢·合譯</p>
<p>在今日、印度民族革命奮鬥的勇猛、和英帝國主義者壓迫的强暴中、凡關心世界弱小民族自决的人們丨丨尤其是主張「聯合世界上弱小民族共同奮鬥」的人們丨丨對於印度的國内政潮及外交上的國際關係、都應當有很澈底的研究、行將出版的「民族革命奮門中的印度」一書、可算是研究印度政治情形最上的參考書了、</p>
<p>印度的民族運動、發源甚早、但經佛經哲學的薰陶、回敎理論的浸染、印度國民的思想、大都趨於保守、調和一途、但是受了革命理論的洗理、急進青年的思想正如世界民主政治國家底青年的思想一樣、並不後人、所以在印度的政治運動、雖然直到今年丨丨一九三一年丨丨的元旦流血、仍然未得着自治或獨立的實現、但他們的奮門精神、較之一九八五年成立國民大會時間、巳有霄壤之别、他們的犧牲精神、堅决的意旨、奮鬥的持久、巳足爲高麗·安南·所欽羡、全世界帝國主義者所折伏了、</p>
<p>印度的地域之大、宗敎人的言語、語言的不同、（南印人不懂北印人的言語、甚至以英語代國語、）因思想不同、黨派林立、意見紛岐、在外表觀察、印度各黨派、各民族·各宗敎的意見、不能融洽、幾乎無不要爲印度抱悲觀、但仔細觀察、印度政治運動的前途、完全可以樂觀、因爲他們意見雖然不一致、思想有的太守舊、甚至在印人視爲神聖的甘地也不能免、但他們完全站在反抗英帝國的苦枙、求印度的自由底立塲上忠誠地奮鬥的、</p>
<p>中國與印度同是東方古國、文化也有許多相仿之點、在今日的世界上同在被侵略之列、中國在租界未收回、不平等條約未取消以前、仍不能脫於次殖民地或半殖民地的地位、我們的民族奮門、仍未有達勝利的目的、我們對於印度的民族革命、有聯絡扶助的必要、有共同奮鬥的責任、對於印度的政治狀况更有研究的急需、</p>
<p>本書係Swarthmore　Collnge國際問題敎授哲學博士威廉好爾所著Wrillian　I　Hull　Ph　th原名The　Politiiar　Crises　of　India一九三○年牛津印刷公司之最新印本、書内篇幅並未分劃章篇、僅提綱挈領的按年月之先後、述明各事件之經過及民衆之態度社會之輿論及英政府的對策、自國民大會成立之時一九八五年起、直至一九二九年爲止、其間印度各宗敎的政治概念、各領袖的德性與精神、青年思想之激昻、無不用其流暢之筆、或借各領袖之演說或宣言、各派報紙的社評和記載、間接直接的描寫無遺、各次會議的主旨及爭點、尤其發揮得透澈、英政府壓迫行爲的狂暴、更描摹得猙寗可怖、誠爲研究印度民族革命空前之作、</p>
<p>譯者李恩紹吳漢二君、對於社會政治經濟素有研究、對於各國政黨、及革命歷史、尤甚明悉、此次用其生動之筆、譯述何氏流利之文字、更覺相映益輝、凡讀過此書、則對於印度的民族革命、無論英政府沿革的侵略政策、及印人爲獨立奮鬥的精神、都可以一目了然、特介於我國革命的讀書界以前、籍供參考焉、</p>

<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>四月二十五日在沙格斯一度會議、對於此點立即協調、布立斯司令也出席會議、詳商之下、在大綱上决定五六兩月裏、美軍首先調遣步兵、對於五月的問題在當時可說完全解决、關於六月的問題當時商定容後再作具體的决定、不過從今起、華盛頓政府準備至少運送步兵六師來法、</p>
<p>這次會議、同時顯出美軍的指揮與調度須利於聯軍的逼切需要、美軍的指揮須臨機應變、其調度須避免個人的支配、這是潘興司今同米爾納侯爵所商定的、四月二十五日的會議再加一層證明、綜而言之、此後的軍事由協約國政府統盤研究美軍實力的問題、所有的决議、概與美軍有運帶關係、</p>
<p>這是五月一二兩日在西伯費會議决定的、其内容如下、</p>
<p>（一）英政府擔任供給船只、在五月裏運輸美兵十三萬至法、六月裏運輸十五萬人、盡屬步兵及機關槍隊、</p>
<p>（二）美國船只用於運輸砲工等軍隊、</p>
<p>（三）六月初再行研究形勢决定將來的計劃、</p>
<p>這種重要的决議卒獲圓滿的給果全賴英船的慷慨合作、在七月一日美國步兵及機關槍隊運到法國填補英法兩軍空虚的不下四十萬人、同時潘興司令用美船運載其他軍隊源源而來、他因能在短時間内在法境另行編成獨立的美國軍隊、特别的利益以及協約國共同的利益因此均得顧及、</p>
<p>如限於美國自巳的能力、一九一八年三月美國運來的兵隊不過　萬人、四月裏九萬三千人、得着英國的帮助之後、這兵額在五月裏便激增至二十四萬、六月裏二十八萬、</p>
<p>然而大隊美軍的開到、别的問題因之發生、美軍在國内未得時間完成其編練、因須在法國繼續、訓練的問題固易處置、軍隊編制及新式軍隊所須要的兵器的供給、則頗費手續、如要避免錯誤、此多彼缺、及曠廢時日等弊、則不得不時時加以嚴密的注意、</p>
<p>我的參謀部因在巴黎特設一股、由助理參謀長指揮之下、專司搜集及支配關於完成美軍編練種種問題、</p>
<p>德軍在法蘭特的進攻、五月九日告一段落、十八日、米特里司令奉令减少他前方的兵力、以便增厚他的後備隊、前巳言之、但基克的軍事長官也奉令把防水酌量减退、以輕居民的不便利、</p>
<p>三月二十一日、德軍砲擊明示大戰時期開始、其先則有一個沉寂的時期、爲一年來所未曾經過的、這平靜的後面藏着的是什麽、我們知道敵人有大隊人馬可供指揮、根據總司令部情報處的調查、敵人有七十六到八十師的兵力、就是比他用在史家坡及疴阿斯兩河間首次進攻的爲多、大隊敵軍將在何處突出攻擊、這個戰局之謎、百思而難於得着個綫索、</p>
<p>海格總指揮相信德軍有在亞眠與北海之間採取新攻勢的危險、其主力將以攻擊亞爾伯或頁着爾爲目標、貝當司令也有同樣的觀察、他確實不再怕敵人會在香本進攻了、因爲缺少别方面的證實、他不相信五月十九及二十二兩日俘虜所說德軍準備在疴亞斯河與里姆間大舉進攻的話、</p>
<p>我不主張聯軍的動作僅限於推測和討論敵人的計劃、别一個逼切的任務我們應當注意的便是我軍的準備採取攻勢、「唯有採取攻勢、我軍始能獲勝、更須先發制人、方能重振我們的軍威、」</p>
<p>但在我軍忙於補充實力的時候、這個攻勢戰所得的結果、必與所蒙的犧牲爲比、合於這條件的有兩個戰區、</p>
<p>（一）疴亞斯河同沙姆河之間的區域、這方面可使法國第三及第一兩軍會同英國第二軍聯合進攻、以解除巴黎亞眠鐵路線及交通中心的亞眠的圍困爲目標、</p>
<p>（二）雷斯河區域、這方面可由英國第一軍左翼及北面支隊會攻、以驅逐壓逼頁普爾及倍什内煤區的敵人爲目標</p>
<p>擇定了這兩個作戰的區域、聯軍進攻的計劃因在五月二十日發交各總司令</p>
<p>兩處的進攻同時加緊準備了、假使敵人不攻、聯軍兩處猛攻可使敵人措手不及、假使敵人進攻、我軍的攻擊也好成爲很有價值的迎擊、兩處的進攻、以兵額論、當然以第一處疴亞斯河與沙姆河之</p>

<p>A reporter went to Changchun on the 4th to investigate the Wanbaoshan case and returned to Harbin this morning. On the 5th, he met with various parties concerned. On the 6th, he ventured to Majiashao Pass, the site of the incident, fifty miles from Changchun, with Zhou Wuxiang, a translator from the Municipal Government, to take photographs and confer with Japanese police officer Nakagawa. The results are as follows: The number of armed Japanese police has increased to seventy-three. Some are camping in tents, while others have invaded the homes of Wang He and Ma San in the former Majiashao Pass. They are using the dug ditches as two-mile-long trenches, setting up machine guns and cannons towards the villages. On both sides of the trenches, they have buried bombs and landmines, communicating with the consulate and barracks via carrier pigeons. They have also provided dozens of police uniforms, ordering Koreans to wear them to demonstrate to the villagers, and at night, they stand guard for several miles. Under the protection of the Japanese police, the Koreans are cutting down willow branches from the villagers' homes and using sacks to hold soil to build a dam in the river, which is already more than ten feet high. However, the water is still far from entering the ditch, and the upstream water level is rising daily. At Jiangqiao, twenty miles from Majiashao Pass, it was originally possible to ford the river, but on the 6th, the reporter nearly drowned while crossing on horseback. At the highest point of the river, the water is less than a foot away from overflowing the banks. Due to continuous heavy rain and the increasing height of the dam at Majiashao Pass, the water is flooding, and nearly 40,000 mu of farmland will be submerged. Traffic on both banks has also been cut off. The ferry at Majiashao Pass has been seized by the Japanese, and traffic in the area has been cut off. Most of the villagers nearby have moved away to avoid the situation. Those who have not fled keep their doors closed during the day and do not go out. The Japanese in Changchun held a large meeting on the 4th, attended by thousands, and decided to ask the consul to insist on a resolution to the Wanbaoshan case. The Japanese army stationed in Changchun is fully prepared and awaiting orders, and the situation is extremely dangerous. Japanese Police Officer Nakagawa Yoshiaki told the reporter that no one was killed or injured in the incident on the morning of the 2nd because both sides fired into the air. He said that he was ordered by the consul to bring forty-seven police officers to protect the Koreans and that he knew he was responsible, but he did not know anything else. He also said that he would need an order to withdraw, but he sincerely hoped for an early resolution so that he could return to Changchun soon. (Special Telegram of the 7th)</p>

<p>The Provincial Government sent Secretary Pan E'nian to Changchun to investigate. He returned to Jilin yesterday and is currently negotiating with the Japanese consul. However, the Japanese police are still forcibly occupying civilian homes at the site, urging Korean farmers to rush to dig trenches and build fortifications, and have completely cut down several miles of willow groves on both sides.

<p>Korean farmers are converting 5,000 mu of dry farmland leased from Changtian Company into paddy fields, digging a twenty-li ditch that uses the riverbed. They are paying three shi of grain per ten mu, but without the consent of the authorities or the people. After negotiations, the special commissioner proposed allowing them to lease the land but not to convert it into paddy fields. The Koreans no longer insisted, but the Japanese police ordered them to continue digging. Our police are protecting the people to prevent riots and are awaiting the outcome of the negotiations. The Japanese are vigorously expanding their propaganda, intending to provoke resentment so that they can use it as an excuse to repeat the Jinan Massacre.

<p>On the 5th, the Jilin Provincial Government sent Secretary Pan to Changchun to investigate. On the 6th, he returned to the province to report. Tsukamoto, the Governor-General of the Kwantung Leased Territory, went to Changchun on the 3rd to investigate and returned to Ryojun on the 6th. The farmers in the Wanbaoshan area are extremely indignant. Dozens of villages have jointly formed a foreign affairs support group, drawn blood to take an oath, and erected banners stating: "The cultivated land that concerns our lives and property has been illegally divided into two sections by the digging of ditches, harming our work. We have repeatedly petitioned the government, but to no avail. We are forced to make our own decisions, implement legitimate self-defense measures, restore the land to its original state for cultivation, and demand that the government order the illegal actors to compensate for the losses. This notice is hereby promulgated to inform everyone. Public notice by the victims of farmland damage in Wanbaoshan." The support group has a chief of staff and thirty staff members, representing dozens of villages, each equipped with self-defense rifles and farm tools as weapons, vowing to fight for the land. Zhang's police are suppressing and persuading, warning against further conflicts, but if the Japanese continue to dig ditches, a fierce fight is inevitable. (Special Telegram of the 7th)</p>

<p>Farmer representatives Qu Xianglou and others told reporters that the land in Wanbaoshan is all good farmland, free from waterlogging and drought. Now that it has been destroyed by digging, hundreds of households have been impoverished, so everyone is of one mind and must persevere to the end. Zhou Yubing, the head of the Municipal Office and negotiator, told reporters that he had negotiated this case many times, but Japanese Consul Tashiro always used the pretext of maintaining rice cultivation by the Koreans, so the negotiations have made no progress. The negotiations have now stalled. (Special Telegram of the 7th)</p>

<p>The protest from the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office to the Japanese consul reads: "Sir, this morning, the Changchun County relayed a telephone call from the Second and Third Branches reporting that this morning, the farmers of Wanbaoshan continued to gather to restore the river channel to its original state. Japanese police fired shots, a total of thirty-eight rounds, and the farmers immediately jumped into the trenches, filled with indignation and eager to seize the guns to fight back. They were repeatedly dissuaded and temporarily returned home to await a negotiated resolution. Fortunately, the incident did not escalate. We request that you seriously negotiate with the Japanese consul to withdraw all the Japanese police immediately to avoid further conflict, etc. We have found that your side has violated the previous agreement and continues to send police, which is a breach of faith. When farmers implement legitimate self-defense measures to restore the land to its original state, the police you send dare to shoot live ammunition, which is extremely barbaric and unreasonable. Your side should immediately withdraw all the police sent and impose appropriate punishment on those police to avoid further complications and inform us of the handling. Sincerely, to Tashiro, Japanese Consul stationed in Changchun." (Special Telegram of the 7th)</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Sanxingbao farm issue, I dispatched a member of the consulate on July 1st based on a report from the area to convey the situation of the riots by your country's farmers. Although I notified your side previously, there has been no intention to suppress the rioters, and in order to protect the Korean farmers, it was necessary to dispatch the appropriate number of police. However, according to subsequent reports, a group of hundreds of farmers from your country abruptly destroyed the dam and filled the ditch. The police I dispatched earlier prevented the Korean farmers from retaliating in order to avoid a conflict between the two sides. It has been found that when the farmers went to the site before 10:00 AM on July 1st, Tian Xiyi, the chief of the Second Public Security Bureau of your country, came with seven police officers to stop the farmers' riots, but they were beaten by them. Based on this violent act, our police, or when unavoidable, will not use self-defense measures. I hope that your side will do everything possible to stop the farmers' violence. Furthermore, according to the request of the Korean farmers, the damage caused by the farmers destroying the dam and filling the ditch will be investigated later, and I ask for your negotiations, etc. I am writing to inform you of this for your reference. Sincerely, to Zhou, Head of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, Tashiro Shigenori, Consul stationed in Changchun, July 2nd, Showa 6th year." (Special Telegram of the 7th)</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Preparatory Office submitted another protest, which reads: "Sir, I have just received and read your official document No. 50 of today. It has been found that the Koreans in Wanbaoshan have illegally violated the current laws and regulations without a consensual contract, infringed upon the inherent legal rights of the farmers, and obstructed navigation and transportation. On June 8th, both parties agreed on investigation and resolution measures, and it was agreed to withdraw the Japanese police and stop the Korean farmers' work as a prerequisite for resolving this case. However, after the factual investigation was completed on the 12th of the same month, your side again sent plainclothes Japanese police to the site to cover the Korean farmers' continued dredging of the waterways and building dams across the river, violating faith and deliberately engaging in malicious acts to infringe upon the inherent legal rights of the landowners and farmers. The farmers, unable to bear their anger and having reached the end of their patience, were forced to automatically restore the original state, implementing their legitimate self-defense measures. The motivation behind this was stated in our official document No. 183 of June 27th. As for what is stated in this letter, the actual situation in which the head of our Third Branch went to suppress the riots yesterday and was unable to stop them, it should be possible to clearly realize the miscalculation of the violent infringement. The police sent by your side, one after another, should be withdrawn immediately to avoid conflict. If they are not withdrawn immediately, all responsibility for the conflicts and incidents that occur shall be fully borne by your side. Please refer to our office's official document No. 159 of June 12th for this. I am hereby making another solemn statement. As for the issue of compensation for damages between the parties concerned, once your police have been completely withdrawn, both sides will resolve the matter fairly and appropriately in accordance with the law and reason, based on the requests of the parties concerned. I am writing to inform you of this for your reference. Sincerely, to Tashiro, Japanese Consul stationed in Changchun." (Special Telegram of the 7th)</p>

<p>More than 800 overseas Chinese in Pyongyang are currently being sheltered and protected by the police station. However, there are rumors that Korean rioters will launch a large-scale attack on the police station. To prevent any eventuality, the authorities ordered 200 households near the Pyongyang police station to relocate immediately to avoid being harmed. At the same time, the 5th company of the 77th Infantry Regiment was dispatched yesterday morning to guard the area. The remaining troops also anticipated the worst-case scenario and prepared to move out. A military telephone line has been set up between the regimental headquarters and the police station. The police have been fully mobilized to carry out patrols, and the military has also been dispatched. Korean rioters are unlikely to take any further action. However, at 4:30 PM yesterday, about 3,000 Korean rioters suddenly attacked a buckwheat factory operated by overseas Chinese outside Pyongyang, intending to harm the Chinese sheltered inside the factory. The police on guard tried their best to stop them, but to no avail, and they began firing to repel the rioters, killing one rioter on the spot. As of this morning, it has been confirmed that 41 Chinese men and 3 Chinese women have died in Pyongyang, and 68 men and 14 women have been seriously injured. Furthermore, since the outbreak of Korean riots in Pyongyang, all shops have closed and suspended business, and the atmosphere throughout the city remains extremely uneasy.

<p>Political observers believe that this large-scale riot by the Korean people, in which overseas Chinese were massacred, appears to be an organized action. The Korean people are usually severely oppressed by the Japanese army and police. The Japanese police intervene in everything. How could the Korean people riot? It can be seen that there must be someone else behind the instructions. (Special Telegram of the 7th)</p>

<p>A certain dignitary said that some time ago, there were rumors about how Japan would deal with Russia, and there was a saying that it was necessary to deal with China first to deal with Russia. At that time, I did not believe it because I thought it was groundless. A month ago, Major General Doihara Kenji came to visit and told me that the Soviet Union's five-year economic plan was actually a military plan and that we must defeat this plan. I replied that Japan's dispatch of troops to Siberia in previous years cost 700 million yuan. What was the result? Even if Japan could occupy Siberia now, what could Japan do? Doihara said that there was no need to worry. From this, we can see the arrogance of the Japanese military. Recently, Japan decided to increase its troops in Korea and station troops in the Eastern Provinces for a long time, which seems to be related to this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Strange is the so-called oppressed. <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Our compatriots living in Korea have suffered such cruel and poisonous harm, and no one in the country is not expressing extreme grief. What is especially sad among the sadness is that this action by the Korean people is said to be a reaction to oppression. In Manchuria, the Korean people invariably hold the power of Japan to insult and trample on our Chinese people. Even unscrupulous Korean people use the Korean Communists to disturb our country's borders and impersonate bandits to plunder our merchants and people. Their oppression of our people can be said to be all-encompassing. And yet, to turn around and say that the Korean people are the oppressed, is this not strange? Even in this Wanbaoshan incident, the Korean people used force to forcibly dig water fields, clearly oppressing the Chinese farmers, and yet they are said to be oppressed by the Chinese farmers. The world's rights and wrongs are so upside down. How could there be such a thing? Our Chinese nation is a nation oppressed by the world, which is almost universally recognized. And yet, the Korean incident today has escalated to such a major event, and its government still says that it originated from oppression. Is this not a double wrong? The Japanese government, on the one hand, uses the term oppression to blame us, in order to lighten the crime of the Korean people and plot to occupy the negotiation ground, and on the other hand, uses empty words such as punishing the murderers and comforting the victims to beautify its face of fair handling. In fact, the matter is so major. Blaming it on insufficient prevention before the event is a failure to notice. How can people believe it? The Japanese government's usual suppression of the Korean people is extremely strict. If there is nothing to rely on, how dare they make such a large-scale reckless move? Governor-General Ugaki initially suspected that there was a problem of thought involved when he heard about the riot and wanted to rush to take office. After hearing that it was only anti-Chinese, he stopped. It can be seen that the Japanese government does not pay much attention to the matter and has a preconceived notion of being oppressed. Therefore, the handling of the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents thereafter can also be seen. Therefore, today, what they call "planning a fundamental solution to end the dispute" is unknown what method they will use to solve it. Our people must think deeply and prepare for it.</p>

<p>Wang Jiazhen said that the Wanbaoshan incident was caused by the Korean people seizing the land of the Chinese people to dig canals. There is no reason why it could have caused the Korean people to turn around and reject the Chinese. It is very regrettable that this incident has now occurred. The government is seriously studying this matter. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received several telegrams, including those from the Consul-General's Office in Korea and the Yuansan Chamber of Commerce. It is estimated that 27 overseas Chinese have been victimized in Gyeongseong, Korea, 37 have died in Pyongyang, and more than 100 have been seriously injured. It is estimated that in the days since the riots, the number of overseas Chinese who have died or been injured will be over a thousand, which is quite serious. It is hoped that the public will study this matter with a calm mind. The most troublesome thing for Korean residents in Northeast China is dual citizenship. After Korean merchants join Chinese citizenship, they still retain their Japanese citizenship and want to drive the Chinese people above them in everything and receive special privileges. How can disputes not arise? Therefore, not only is it hoped that attention will be paid to this incident afterward, but it is also hoped that the relationship between the people of northern Ping and the Korean people will be greatly studied.

<h3 id="e111">Agreement Reached in U.S.-France Negotiations on Deferred War Debt <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Agreement Officially Announced in Three Parts</p>
<p>Subject to Approval by Concerned Countries</p>
<p>Paris to Convene Experts' Conference</p>
<p>To Specifically Study the Issue of Goods Delivered as Reparations</p>
<h3 id="e112">National Telegram, Paris, 6th <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>France and the United States have formally reached an agreement here this evening regarding the issue of deferred war debt payments. However, this agreement is still subject to approval by the countries concerned. The French government immediately issued an official gazette, declaring that the Franco-American negotiations had reached a satisfactory compromise at 10:00 PM this evening. Agreement has been reached on the main principles of President Hoover's proposal to suspend all war debt payments for one year. The first part of the agreement includes the following points: (1) All government debts will be handled according to the one-year period stipulated by President Hoover. (2) During the suspension period, Germany's unconditional reparations must still be fully paid to the Bank for International Settlements, but France agrees that the bank will use this money to guarantee German railway bonds. (3) All suspended funds must accrue interest according to the U.S. proposal, and the principal and interest must be repaid within ten years starting from July 1, 1933. (4) The German railway bonds will also be handled in this way. Subsequently, the French government gazette published the second part of the Franco-American agreement, which has three items and is less related to the U.S. government: (1) The major national banks should act in concert to seek the interests of European countries affected by the German suspension of reparations. (2) An understanding must be reached between countries to ensure that if the suspension period for payments under the Young Plan exceeds the U.S. President's proposal, France should not be held fully liable. (3) The issue of paying German reparations in the form of goods will be studied by experts, hoping to reach a compromise in the spirit of President Hoover's proposal. Furthermore, the French government gazette published the third part of the Franco-American agreement, which reserves for France the right to demand necessary guarantees from Germany to ensure that the funds saved by suspending reparations payments are used exclusively for economic purposes. According to reports, the representatives of the two countries held several meetings before reaching final agreement today. French Premier Laval first met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon and others from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and then presented the resulting compromise to the cabinet. After a lengthy and heated debate, they resumed the meeting with Mellon and others at 7:30 PM. At 8:20 PM, Mellon reported the results by telephone to the U.S. President for instructions. From then until 9:30 PM, the two sides reopened the meeting, and finally reached full agreement at 10:00 PM. After the agreement was concluded, the French Premier immediately telegraphed the British Prime Minister, hoping to quickly convene a conference of countries that signed the Young Plan. It is reported that British Prime Minister MacDonald has expressed his willingness to participate.</p>

<p>The U.S. President summoned representatives of the press to the White House today and announced that the U.S.-France negotiations on deferred war debt payments have been successfully concluded. Treasury Secretary Mellon and French Premier Laval reached an agreement at 10:00 PM this evening. The French cabinet has already passed it, and the U.S. government is also completely satisfied. If the Franco-American agreement can be approved by the countries concerned, the one-year suspension proposal can be implemented. The second most important step will be to convene a conference of countries that signed the Young Plan. The French cabinet has already exchanged views with London. In addition, there are some details to be resolved by a committee of experts, such as the goods that should be paid for German reparations, which is a major issue. Subsequently, the U.S. President paid tribute to the spirit of French Premier Laval and U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon in resolving this most difficult problem, and also expressed deep gratitude to Britain for its willingness to act as a mediator when negotiations were difficult, and for its intention to convene an emergency meeting of representatives from France, Germany, Italy, Britain, and the United States in London to assist.</p>

<p>President Hoover believes that the new method submitted to France, which stipulates that various specialized issues be reviewed by experts, has eliminated the various points of contention regarding the suspension proposal. Acting Secretary of State Castle said tonight that we have no doubt that the President's plan will take effect. He also said that Treasury Secretary Mellon does not recognize France's final document as the basis for a solution, because it raises significant new difficulties, many of which involve the Young Plan, in which the United States did not participate. France also asked the United States to provide loans to other countries and facilitate their fundraising in the United States. France also argued that goods reparations worth 20 million should be distinguished from other reparations. The gist is not 20 million, but the fact that other countries have stated that if other countries have exceptions, then they must also have exceptions. Therefore, the United States cannot accept this proposal, otherwise the President's plan will be greatly impacted.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Reuters Telegram, Washington, 6th <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>President Hoover said, "I am pleased to announce that the plan proposed by the United States for a one-year suspension of all government debts and reparations has been accepted in principle by all major creditor countries." This important statement by the U.S. President is a sign that the talks between France and the United States in Paris today have been successful. President Hoover also said that the conditions under which the French government accepted the U.S. proposal are subject to the approval of other countries concerned. The United States, of course, cannot negotiate on behalf of other countries. The U.S. Congress still needs to pass the Franco-American agreement, but he has received promises of support from many members of both houses of Congress. The cost of competing armaments is far greater than government debts. The burden and fear of competing armaments are one of the causes of the world's depression. The documents concerning the suspension will now be sent to the major countries concerned.</p>

<p>The U.S.-France Hoover Plan agreement was only reached at midnight today. U.S. Treasury Secretary Mellon, Ambassador Edge, and French diplomats convened the final meeting at 7:00 PM this afternoon. The meeting lasted until 11:30 PM, at which time reporters had gathered outside the doors of the conference hall, quietly waiting for good news. After the news came out, extra editions were issued within minutes, and buyers were very enthusiastic. The U.S.-France agreement, when approved by President Hoover, made a reservation, that is, the U.S. approval is contingent on the approval of other countries. However, this is just a formality, because Britain, as Germany's second debtor country, has also agreed to the agreement. Furthermore, the agreement states that the suspension of debt payments will take effect from July 1 of this year to June 30 of the following year. The suspension of debt payments only applies to conditional payments, while unconditional payments should still be paid by Germany, but can be offset by bonds from the German National Railway, which will be guaranteed by the Bank for International Settlements. All extended payments will accrue interest from the effective date, and the interest rate will be set by the U.S. government and must be paid off after ten years. The first installment of interest on all suspended debts and the German unconditional annuity offset by railway bonds will begin on July 1, 1932.</p>

<p>Due to the time difference between the two capitals, the news of the U.S.-France Hoover Plan agreement arrived after noon. At that time, the government may have received prior notice, but the people were already impatient. At about 11:00 AM, shocking news came that the U.S.-France negotiations had broken down, and the temporary notice boards at the entrances of various newspapers were already crowded with people, all wanting to be the first to get the news. When the news of the final reconciliation was announced, the mood of the people suddenly turned joyful. Soon, various newspapers printed extra editions for distribution, and most people held a copy in their hands and went to bed happily. As for those in political circles, although there were various predictions, such as that France would then demand that Germany cancel the construction of its second batch of pocket battleships, or that France would demand the suspension of the German-Austrian customs union, there was no concrete public opinion at this time, and the joy of the whole country was an undeniable fact. Furthermore, the government's next step may be to organize a delegation of economic experts to negotiate with various countries the procedures for suspending debt payments, etc., because the conference will soon be convened in Paris. The conference is specifically to discuss matters related to the suspension of debt payments and does not involve German reparations.</p>

<p>Regarding the recent riots in Korea, the Seiyukai pointed to the government's major blunder, saying that the improper measures of replacing the Governor-General of Korea and the Director-General of Political Affairs had caused the entire leadership to be away from their posts for a long time, so the unstable atmosphere between the Chinese and Koreans could not be prevented in advance.

<p>The Japanese cabinet decided on the 7th on the following policy to resolve the Korean incident: (1) Although the Wanpaoshan incident was the direct cause, it was also caused by the long-standing resentment accumulated by the oppressed people in Manchuria and Korea. Therefore, it is planned to take a mitigating solution. (2) In order to resolve the various outstanding issues for the people in Manchuria and Korea and remove the root of the disaster, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and the Governor-General of Korea will soon begin negotiations to establish future policies. (3) This incident should be separated from the Wanpaoshan incident. Those who harmed Koreans will be severely punished according to the law. Compensation will be paid to the Chinese victims and general victims to show the government's sincerity in handling this incident.</p>

<p>Regarding the Korean people's massacre of overseas Chinese in various parts of Korea, Governor-General of Korea Ugaki said, "The Korean people's atrocities against overseas Chinese in various parts of Korea seem to have largely calmed down. I was initially quite worried about whether there was an ideological background behind the riots, but it is now clear that it is only a reaction to the Wanpaoshan incident. Therefore, I do not need to rush to take office," he said.</p>

<p>Newspapers commented on the Korean riots, unanimously regretting them, and criticizing the Koreans for using such violence as a means of retaliation.

<p>Draft Organizational Regulations of the National History Museum Approved</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui's Resignation as Chairman of Ningxia Province Rejected, Retention Urged</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 29th cabinet meeting on the 7th. Attendees included Song Ziwen, Ma Fuxiang, Li Shuhua, Liu Ruiheng, Wang Zhengting, and Liu Shangqing. Attendees by invitation were Zheng Hongnian, Chen Yi, and Chen Shaokuan. The meeting was chaired by Song Ziwen. Items reported: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a case entrusted by the Ministry of Interior regarding whether to send personnel to attend the international conference on population research held in Rome. After consultation between the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry, it was decided that the embassy in Italy should dispatch personnel to attend the meeting as appropriate, and a reply was submitted for review. Items discussed: (1) The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education jointly submitted a case for establishing a preparatory office for the National History Museum in accordance with the resolution of the 24th cabinet meeting. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education would each send five members, and five people would be hired from outside, for a total of fifteen people, to serve as preparatory staff for the National History Museum. However, it seems that these externally hired personnel should be eminent scholars and experts familiar with the history of the Party and the country. Should these personnel be jointly hired by the two ministries, or should the Executive Yuan send letters of appointment? A draft of the organizational regulations of the National History Museum has been prepared for review and approval. Resolution: The regulations were approved for record. In addition to the regulations being approved for record, the preparatory personnel should be jointly hired by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education. (2) The Ministry of Finance submitted a case entrusted for review and approval regarding the Fujian Provincial Government's report on issuing 500,000 yuan of short-term treasury bonds in Fujian Province in the 20th year of the Republic of China, along with revised regulations. It was found that the original report stated that the proposed issuance of 500,000 yuan of short-term treasury bonds was intended to provide temporary turnover to offset expenditures, and it seems that this should be approved. The original draft provisions are also appropriate, but the word "regulations" should be changed to "ordinances." It is appropriate to submit this case for review. Resolution: Approved according to the land occupation fee exemption procedures for land use taxes. Please review and forward this to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. Resolution: Amended and passed. Submitted to the National Government for record. (4) Resolution: Zhao Zhangjiang was appointed as the director of the Army Hospital in Henan Province, under the Ministry of Military Affairs. (5) Committee member of the Anti-Opium Commission, Ma Yinchu, requested permission to resign from the Anti-Opium Commission. Resolution: Retention was urged. (6) Ma Hongkui requested permission to resign from the position of Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial Government, and to appoint another capable person. Resolution: Retention was urged.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Fujian Anti-Opium Inspection Office Has Opened <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>However, the Provincial Government and Various Agencies Are Still Opposed</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The order from the Fujian Provincial Government to temporarily suspend the opening of the Anti-Opium Inspection Office has been reported previously. However, the director of the office, Yuan Jin, believes that the office is directly under the Central Anti-Opium Commission, and since he has not received an order from the Central Government to suspend operations, he should proceed according to the original plan. Therefore, on July 1, he set up an office in the Ellis Foreign Firm in Pan Shipu to handle affairs, divided into three sections. The head of the first section, Zhou, is from Jiangsu. The head of the second section, Chen, is from Fuzhou. The head of the third section has not yet been determined. It is also planned to establish branch offices in six locations: Xiamen, Sandu, Xinghua, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Yanping. However, the detailed measures have not yet been determined. It is heard that the Anti-Opium Inspection General Office sent Ye Zhensheng to Fujian the day before yesterday to serve as a special envoy in Fujian to supervise the office's handling of cases. As for the Provincial Government, it believes that the issue of opium prohibition in the province has been telegraphed to the Central Government for interpretation. Before a reply is received, it should continue as before. In addition to returning Yuan Jin's original report on the opening of the office, ordering him to continue to comply with the previous order, it also issued a notice to the county governments and public security bureaus, stating that they should continue to actively carry out opium prohibition affairs and should not slack off. Therefore, the Anti-Opium Commission has been working doubly hard these days, sending out a large number of investigators to work with the city public security bureau police to investigate and search various places, and has already cracked down on many opium dens and native opium shops. On the Party Department's side, the Minhou County Party Department convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees on the 2nd and decided on three items: (1) Submit a request to the Provincial Party Department to quickly send a letter to the Provincial Government to revoke the Anti-Opium Inspection Office and urgently telegraph the Central Government to stop its establishment. (2) Convene people from all walks of life in the county to hold a National Salvation Movement against Opium Prohibition. (3) Telegraph the party departments of various provinces to unanimously oppose the opium monopoly. On the 3rd, slogans were posted all over the city: 1. Thoroughly prohibiting opium is following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last wishes. 2. Opium business and the National Government cannot coexist. 3. Opium dens and native opium shops are institutions that kill people and destroy families. 4. The opium monopoly is destroying the country and exterminating the race. At the same time, the Anti-Drug Society also joined forces with various social organizations to send a telegram to the Central Party Department, requesting the preservation of Fujian's history of opium prohibition, and printed leaflets containing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last wishes on opium prohibition and President Chiang's instructions at the National Opium Prohibition Conference, which were distributed in the city and public entertainment venues by car to promote social awareness.

<p>The Executive Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department held its 80th meeting yesterday (the 7th). Attendees included Ye Suzhong, Chen Xihao, Zhang Qiang, Xu Shaodi, Zheng Bingtang, and Fang Qingru. The meeting was chaired by Ye Suzhong. Items discussed: (1) A letter from the Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition Anniversary, requesting an appropriation of 200 yuan for the conference expenses, was approved. (2) It was found that Pan Nai'en, the Executive Committee member and Propaganda Minister of Xiangshan County, had only attended four meetings since the establishment of the county's second Executive Committee. The propaganda work of this committee was also extremely derelict. According to the regulations on the punishment of Executive Committee members of party departments at all levels for unauthorized absences and the regulations on rewards and punishments for diligence and dereliction of duty in the work of party departments at all levels below the county level, he was given a public reprimand. Furthermore, the county's Executive Committee failed to report to the committee in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the regulations on the punishment of committee member absences, which was also inappropriate and was also given a reprimand. (3) It was resolved to appoint Committee Member Xu Shaodi as the chairman of the Hangzhou All-Circles Celebration of the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition Anniversary. (4) Another telegram was sent to the Central Government and the National Government, instructing them to revoke the Anti-Opium Inspection Offices at all levels, which are ostensibly for opium prohibition but are actually implementing an opium monopoly, and to severely punish the responsible personnel. (5) An order was issued to all party members in the province to prohibit them from participating in the work of the Anti-Opium Inspection Office, and those who violated the order would be punished for violating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last wishes. (6) A letter was sent to the Provincial Government to respect public opinion and implement the province's long-standing strict opium prohibition policy. (July 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e132">Liu Zhenhua's Announcement to the People of Western Henan on Implementing Pacification <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>To the people of the counties of Western Henan: In recent years, affected by the current situation, the suffering of the people in Western Henan can be said to have reached its extreme. Since the end of the war last year, although order in the area has gradually recovered, incidents of bandit gangs looting villages and individual bandits robbing and seizing goods still occur everywhere. Residents are still startled several times a night, unable to live in peace at home. What a painful life this is! This Commissioner-General has moved to Luoyang this time, and is ordered to implement pacification work in Western Henan. The task undertaken is to suppress bandits and clear the countryside. Suppressing bandits is to remove the current obstacles for the people, and clearing the countryside is to seek permanent peace for the people. The phrase "cooperate with the people" is the sole purpose of this Commissioner-General. Anything that benefits the people will be done without hesitation; anyone who harms the people will be eliminated on behalf of the people. This is the first thing this Commissioner-General announces to my people. Speaking of the bandit situation in Western Henan, it is also very complex. Some are driven by hunger and cold and take risks; some are forced by circumstances and only care about the present. Still others are exploited by others, gathering vagrants, hoping to be recruited and see it as a shortcut to promotion and fortune. In summary, it can be said that only a small number of people are socially undesirable and willingly become bandits. Western Henan is this Commissioner-General's hometown, and this Commissioner-General knows the local situation and social conditions most clearly. I hope everyone will thoroughly awaken, fathers will advise and brothers will encourage, and quickly seek to extricate themselves. The ancients said, "Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." If everyone knows that the path they have taken before was completely wrong, and repent wholeheartedly, this Commissioner-General will not only not pursue trivial matters or delve into the past, but will also take measures to protect them so that they can live and work in peace. This is another matter that this Commissioner-General announces to my people. Furthermore, the current social situation in Western Henan is one of poverty and exhaustion of wealth, and extreme hardship. To start construction work, we must first cultivate the vitality of the region. Eliminating violence and ensuring peace is the most important task at present. Since this Commissioner-General bears the responsibility of maintaining public order, I naturally have the determination to stabilize society. For those who have gone astray, I sincerely hope that they will reflect and ensure their safety. However, for bandits who are obsessed and harm the people, I will never dare to be lenient. I should follow the common psychological demands of the people, unite the strength of the people, and jointly defend ourselves in order to fulfill the duties that this Commissioner-General should fulfill. May my people consider this. Respectfully announced by Liu Zhenhua, Commissioner-General for Pacification of the Border Region of Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi.</p>

<p>The Changshu County Government has received reports that there are 60 to 70 shrimp gang boats operating near Xianzi Mountain and Xiaojing, which border the county. Their movements are erratic. Ostensibly, they fish for shrimp, but in reality, they are pirate ships. Yesterday (the 7th), they specially consulted with the local county government to strictly crack down on them.</p>

<p>Feng Dongbao, a villager in Huangjinbang near Liutanqiao, District 11 (Nanyan City), is over fifty years old and has a modest family fortune. His wife, Sima, bore him one son and three daughters. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Dongbao and his wife suddenly argued over a trivial matter, which escalated into a physical fight. Dongbao, in a fit of anger, threw a clay pot from the table at his wife. It hit Sima's head, causing her to bleed profusely and faint. Shortly after, she died. The next day, Dongbao knew that he had caused a disaster and sent someone to inform the mother's family of the deceased, falsely claiming that Sima had died of a sudden illness. After receiving the news, the nephew learned that his aunt had died unnaturally, but due to poverty, he was unable to avenge his aunt and had to let her be buried hastily.</p>

<p>It has been raining heavily in the city for three days and nights, and the river water has risen three or four feet. The low-lying fields in the surrounding countryside have been flooded. Vegetables along the river and in low-lying areas have been submerged, causing prices to rise sharply. Watermelons in low-lying areas have also been flooded, resulting in heavy losses. Small steamships heading to Jiangyin and other places have also been suspended. Only small steamships to Nanfangquan and one or two other places are still operating normally, causing inconvenience to transportation and delays in mail. Each ship hires temporary small boats to operate, profiting from the transportation. Roads such as Youlong along the river outside the North Gate and Xiaomuqiao in the West City are all submerged in water, preventing pedestrians from passing. There are many cases of centuries-old houses collapsing due to water intrusion. The river system at Ximen Bridge is an important route to Taihu Lake.</p>

<p>There are a total of nineteen county magistrates elected in the second session of Jiangsu Province. Except for Li Jinfang, Shen Zhenjia, Chen Guiqing, and Chen Xi, who have been appointed as county magistrates by the Provincial Government, most of them remain in the province and are assigned to serve in the Civil Affairs Department, Rural Clearing Bureau, etc. Each person receives a monthly allowance of 50 silver dollars. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, they feel it is particularly difficult. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Li Jinfang and ten others prepared a statement and visited Provincial Chairman Ye Chucang and Civil Affairs Director Hu Pu'an, requesting an increase in the allowance. Since Chairman Ye and Director Hu were busy with official duties, they were specially instructed to be summoned again at a later date.</p>

<p>Li Jinfang, the former Magistrate of Liyang County, reported that Pan Keping, the former Director of the County Finance Bureau, colluded with Shi Chuanji, a standing member of the Chamber of Commerce, to open a court for investigation. Pan Keping did not appear in court due to illness, and the Finance Department sent a letter to the court to prove it on his behalf. Because Pan was an employee of the Finance Department who had been suspended, the Finance Department's behavior of communicating about Pan's failure to appear in court was reported to the Supervisory Yuan, requesting impeachment. It was also stated that Pan Keping was a person selected by Jiangsu Province. According to the selection regulations, if corruption is discovered, the original recommender should be punished. The matter was referred to the National Government, instructing the original recommender and the Finance Department of Jiangsu Province to hand over Pan Keping to the case as soon as possible to avoid prolonged suspension.</p>

<p>After the Nantong Rural Clearing Bureau was abolished, a temporary court was difficult to establish. More than 40 bandit and Red bandit cases were apprehended. County Magistrate Zhang was commissioned by the Pacification Commissioner to concurrently serve as a military judge. He took the concurrent position on the 6th and incorporated the detained bandits into the scope of military law. They will be tried in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China and submitted to Commissioner Zhang for review and closing.</p>

<p>Jin Haihe, a member of the Baoweituan (local defense corps) of Xincang Sanzhuhe Village in this county, colluded with Wang Sihe and his son this spring to sell five rows of bullets from the public weapons of the Baoweituan to the bandit Liu Dexing. Chen Laohu, a bandit who surrendered some time ago, reported to the Baoweituan that the Liu bandit had been killed, and the case of private sale of military weapons was also exposed. Tuanzong Gankaijun immediately captured Jin and Wang Sihe and his son. The original stolen goods were also seized from the home of Ma Zhenhu, Liu bandit's nephew. Ma fled upon hearing the news. The four offenders, including Ma's son, were escorted to the county government for severe punishment in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>There is a Dingxin Cloth Shop on Beijie (North Street) in this city. It moved from Zhicheng Road in March of this year and was scheduled to reopen on June 30. Therefore, the manager of the shop, Cheng, requested a 吵盤 for several days from the Cloth Industry Association beforehand. The industry association agreed to allow three days. Therefore, the shop hung colorful banners and put on a 吵盤 starting from the opening day. Unexpectedly, the three shops, Zenghui, Derun, and Yichengxing, also intended to sell their goods for profit and each put on their own 吵盤. As a result, the businesses that were not putting on a 吵盤 inevitably experienced sluggish business. Therefore, at around 7:00 PM yesterday the 5th, apart from the above four shops, representatives from both labor and management of the remaining shops gathered at the Cloth Industry Association for a meeting. It was resolved that, because the three-day period had expired, the 吵盤 of each shop should be stopped. Therefore, at around 7:30 AM this morning, Li, from the Tongyu Cloth Shop on Beijie (located diagonally across from Dingxin), and dozens of laborers from the industry went to the Dingxin Cloth Shop and ordered the paper banners hanging in the shop to be removed immediately. The Dingxin employees replied that they would remove them as soon as the manager arrived at the shop, etc., which led to arguments and then fights. The Public Security Bureau heard the news and immediately dispatched police officers to intervene. As a result, a man named Zhan from Tongyu Shop was injured in the face, and the counter boxes in the Dingxin Shop were overturned. All cloth shops in this city, except for the above shops putting on 吵盤, were all closed.</p>

<p>Li Zicai, the former Director of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, was found by Zhu Jiahua, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, to have violated the law and neglected his duties, embezzling nearly 20,000 yuan of public funds. Zhu arrested Li and transferred him to the court for legal punishment. After many trials, the evidence was conclusive, and he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Li stated that he would appeal, but because he fell ill in prison, he repeatedly requested bail. After paying a temporary bail of 17,000 yuan, Li went to Harbin to serve as secretary of the Chinese Eastern Railway Council. Therefore, the case was delayed until now, and it has been more than a year. It is now learned that the case will be heard at 10:00 AM today (the 7th) in the third criminal court of the Zhejiang High Court. The summons to Li was sent to both Li's residence in Peiping and Harbin, entrusting the courts in those locations to deliver the summons on behalf of the court. The summons to Peiping has been returned because Li was not there. There is still no news from Harbin. Therefore, Li has not appeared. The defendants in the case are Zhu Chengjie, former section chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the accountant Yao Ailuo. Police were dispatched to their original residences to arrest Zhu Yao, but they were not found. Only the witness Zhu Rongtai, owner of the firewood and charcoal store Zhu Liansheng, arrived that day, and the store's books and records were retrieved for inspection by the court. Presiding Judge Wang Rulin questioned the witness, proving that the chops on the firewood and charcoal purchase invoices were indeed forged and that the amounts did not match. However, since none of the defendants were present, the court was adjourned and a new hearing date was set.</p>

<p>The bandit Tang Linye was sentenced to twelve years in prison by the Fenghua County Government and was serving his sentence in the Fenghua Prison. On September 10 of last year, he masterminded a prison break, resulting in the escape of more than ten prisoners. The criminal Tang Linye was only captured by the security team in the Kangling area last month. After the county government verified the facts of the situation, it submitted the matter to the provincial government for approval. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, after verifying his identity, he was tied and taken to the execution ground and executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>Pingkeng, Huixi and other villages bordering this county and Fenghua County have always been a den of bandits. Because the area is located in the mountains, connecting several counties, and both civilians and bandits live there, they carry plows and hoes during the day and go out to kidnap and loot at night. Government troops find it difficult to suppress and appease them. Although the Provincial Government dispatched security teams last winter to carry out a painful suppression for more than a month within a dozen miles around the village, the adjacent villages were able to enjoy a small degree of prosperity. However, these people are exceptionally stubborn. Banditry has been rampant again since the beginning of summer. Recently, they kidnapped a twelve-year-old "god of wealth" from a certain place in Yin County and hid him in a cave with tight security. Nearby villagers are afraid of repeating the tragedies of the past and have risen up to organize self-defense groups to guard against unexpected events.</p>

On the afternoon of the first day, a review committee was opened in the bureau to determine the validity period, which was divided into five types: two years, half a year, one year, half a year, and half a year of probation. A total of eighty-six people passed this time, including sixty-three local teachers, eight from Sheng County, four from Yuyao, four from Hang County, two from Shaoxing, two from Dongyang, one from Yongkang, one from Zhuji, and one from Yiwu. Teachers from outside the county accounted for slightly less than three-tenths. Last year, 205 people passed the registration, and teachers from outside the county accounted for more than one-third.</p>

<p>Lou Baozhen, wife of Han Rongsheng, owner of Han Yuanchang's copper and tin shop outside the East Gate of Xiaoshan in Fan Jia Nongkou, because her husband was poor and ugly, and failed to please her, held a polyandrous point of view. On the 6th, she secretly hid saltpetre in a teapot in order to murder her husband. Fortunately, it was detected early, and no disaster occurred. The promiscuous woman has been detained for investigation.</p>

<p>Yao Jiaming, an alcohol tax inspector in Xiaoshan (erroneously reported as Yao Lie in the previous report), extorted 300 to 400 silver dollars while in the countryside. He first went to the Wendao Village Committee, and the village chief appointed Xu Songlin and others to privately extort money from door to door without issuing receipts or tickets. Then he went to Shi Yu Village and Sangjiang Village, where he also extorted hundreds of dollars. No farmer who brewed even a few dou (unit of volume) of alcohol was spared. Yesterday, the farmers of Dongcao Village also telegraphed the Provincial Bureau to request an investigation.</p>

After submitting the matter to General Commander Chiang Kai-shek, he received a telegram from Chiang specially appointing Zhang Xiyuan, a senior staff officer of the Tax Police Special Service Regiment, as the director and Zhao Chunpu, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, as the deputy director. The Tax Police Special Service Regiment then received a telegram from the Garrison Headquarters stating that Chief of Staff Zhang was unable to take office due to special missions and appointing Wang Tianming, the commander of the regiment, as the acting director.

<p>Order from the Jiangsu Education Department to the governments of Zhenjiang and 17 other counties: Regarding the education plans and budgets of the various counties for the 20th year, orders were previously issued to prepare them separately and submit them to this department for verification and instructions before March 30 of this year, and orders have been issued to urge them. Now that the 19th year has ended and the 20th year is about to begin, the education plan and budget for the 20th year in your county has not yet been submitted for verification. The progress of future undertakings and various expenditures will inevitably lack a basis. Such repeated delays are a mistake in important government affairs. Another order is hereby issued, urging the county magistrate to supervise and urge the education bureau to prepare and submit the documents to the department immediately. Before this plan and budget have been submitted and approved, the county magistrate and education bureau director shall be jointly responsible for compensating any expenditures that exceed the approved budget in the future. This order must be strictly followed.</p>

<p>The funding for primary schools in urban and rural areas of Wuxian County was previously only issued until the first half of May. Now, due to the end of the summer vacation and the end of the year, representatives from various schools have repeatedly urged the Education Bureau to pay. The bureau is also well aware of the difficult situation, but after exhausting all means, it managed to raise the funding for the second half of May and issued it yesterday afternoon. However, the principals of various schools believe that the teachers are poor and cannot be owed for long, so most of the funding for June has been temporarily advanced.</p>

<p>(3) Contents of Increased Funding for Various Educational Institutions</p>
<p>The general amount of the approved budget for provincial educational institutions this year and last year has been described in detail yesterday. We can understand the comparison between the two to learn that the funding for each school has almost all increased compared to last year. (The funding for Central University remains the same, with no increase or decrease. However, Central University is a national university, and it is indeed insufficient to allocate its funding from Jiangsu's education expenses. However, the Administrative Yuan's 34th meeting on August 20, the 18th year, resolved that "Central University's funding should be permanently allocated by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office according to the fixed amount of 1,320,000 yuan in the 17th year." The provincial government has no choice but to comply with this.) As for the increased components, it is what was mentioned the day before yesterday (July 6), such as natural grade increases, etc. Now, let's briefly describe the situation.</p>
<p>1. In the 20th year, various primary and secondary schools need to appropriately add grades due to natural connections. It is estimated that four grades need to be added to junior high school, five grades to senior high school, six grades to rural normal school, ten grades to experimental primary school, and two grades to simple primary school, requiring a total funding of 108,000 yuan.</p>
<p>2. Within this year, due to curriculum modifications and increased credits in junior high schools, the original hourly fees are insufficient. Approximately 2 hours will be added to each grade in junior high schools on average, costing a total of 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>3. Among provincial schools, vocational courses or vocational schools will be established appropriately in those with relatively complete facilities and special circumstances. The total equipment and start-up costs will be 30,000 yuan, of which 20,000 yuan can be transferred from the remaining funds under the special project fund for primary and secondary schools in the 19th year. The actual increase is 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>4. Rural normal schools were originally a three-year system, but after being changed to a four-year system in the 17th year, grades must be added in the 20th year. The original school buildings and equipment are difficult to meet the needs and must be supplemented appropriately. An average of 5,000 yuan is estimated per school, totaling 30,000 yuan for six schools.</p>
<p>5. As of now, the counties north of the Yangtze River still do not have a provincial-level education center, which is a pity. In order to promote the widespread development of social education, it has been decided to add a farmer education center in Xuzhou (i.e., Tongshan County) north of the Yangtze River this year. It is heard that the regular expenses for running it will be approximately 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>6. For the sake of natural connections, the College of Education needs to add four grades to each department and specialty this year, requiring at least 35,000 yuan.</p>
<p>7. Various social education institutions also need to increase funding due to natural development, appropriating 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>8. Before the National Games in the 20th year, it is planned to hold an amateur sports meeting. The original sports meeting fee (13,000 yuan and 1,100 yuan) is insufficient, and at least 3,000 yuan needs to be added.</p>
<p>9. In order to step up the supervision of the education funds in various counties, the Education Fund Committee's 22nd meeting on December 9 of last year resolved to increase the number of supervisors, adding 500 yuan per month in expenses, totaling 6,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>The total amount of the above nine items is 262,000 yuan. These are the largest components of increased funding for each unit. In addition, there are several small additions:</p>
<p>1.  Increase of equipment personnel in agricultural and sericultural schools: 5,000 yuan</p>
<p>2.  Increase of regular expenses for the National Studies Library: 3,750 yuan</p>
<p>3.  Provincial school achievement exhibition: 3,000 yuan</p>
<p>4.  People's schools: 3,000 yuan</p>
<p>5.  People's education achievement exhibition: 1,500 yuan</p>
<p>6.  Subsidy for Zhengze Middle School: 2,000 yuan</p>
<p>7.  Subsidy for Jingzhi Girls' School: 2,000 yuan</p>
<p>8.  Subsidy for Yutang People's Education Center: 3,000 yuan</p>
<p>The total of these eight items is 23,250 yuan. Combining it with the above, the total is 285,250 yuan, which is the entire component of the increase in funding. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e179">Xu Kepei, Former Player of the Qingguang Basketball Team, is a Hero in France <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Returned to China with a Master's Degree in Political Economy after Studying in France for Nearly Two Years</p>
<p>Experienced in More Than a Hundred Battles, He Dominated the French Basketball Scene</p>
<p>A Well-Rounded Player with Both Intelligence and Courage: Xu Kepei, Former Star of the Qingguang Basketball Team, Recently Returned from France. Mr. Xu Resided in France for Approximately One Year and Ten Months, Obtaining a Master's Degree in Political Economy from the University of Toulouse. When Mr. Xu First Arrived in France, He Occasionally Threw Basketballs and Was Suddenly Appreciated by the President of a Well-Known Local Sports Association, Earning a Place as One of the Official Players. Afterwards, His Fame Spread, and Everyone in the French National Basketball Community Knew of Xu Kepei, a Chinese Man Skilled in Basketball, and Adored Him. Relying on His Genuine Skills, He Represented the New Chinese Youth and Waved His Power in a Foreign Land. Xu Kepei is Truly a Good Man of the Sports World.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Obtained a Master's Degree in Political Economy in France <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xu and his classmate Wu Shengwu went to France by boat to study. Xu entered the University of Toulouse to study political economy, and Wu entered the University of Paris to study sociology. Xu continued to appear in the basketball gym in his spare time, while Wu gave up sports and focused on his textbooks. Their daily lives were different, and their personalities changed accordingly. Xu remained strong as before, while Wu became bloated like a fat man. Xu graduated on June 12 of this year with a Master's Degree in Political Economy and returned to China. Wu will return to China next spring. Wu is also a talent in the Chinese sports world, but it is a pity that he gave up halfway.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Kepei</p>
<h3 id="e181">His Fame Almost Spread Throughout the National Basketball Community <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Within three months of Mr. Xu's stay in France, he was invited by the famous Toulouse CA Colonne to sign up and join the basketball team, earning a place as one of the official players. The school basketball team lost a strong player, which was regrettable at the time. Mr. Xu has experienced more than a hundred battles, and the most memorable ones were the Southwest Provinces Open League, the Big City League, and the French National Championship. The Toulouse team won the championship in the first two competitions, and Xu, as the captain of the team, made great contributions. In the last competition, they were defeated by the Paris team in the semi-finals. Xu's great talent and fame were spread through these three major competitions. Afterwards, many basketball teams invited him to serve as an honorary coach. Xu was unable to refuse and accepted the position in his spare time, also serving as a coach for a women's team in Bordeaux. The women in that area used the same rules as men, were lively and brave, and sometimes even surpassed men. As for the sports situation in France, tennis and American football are very popular. After the Four Musketeers kept the World Davis Cup Tennis Championship for several times, the national atmosphere became more intense. The level of basketball is also very average. If an excellent Chinese team can be organized, it will not be difficult to sweep across European countries. There is a lack of sports organizations among students studying in France, so this can also be reported.</p>
<p>In the future, in addition to serving as a teacher at a certain university, Mr. Xu will still be active in the basketball world when he has time. Mr. Xu has not yet formally indicated whether he will serve the Qingguang team again.</p>

<p>Unless Schmelling Beats Sharkey Again</p>
<p>The New York Championship Will Be Officially Recognized</p>
<p>New York, 5th—Official Molton, the secretary of the New York Athletic Association, formally announced today that the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship has not yet been decided in New York. In other words, it denies the championship qualification of Schmelling's victory over Stribling in 窕海窕州 this time. Although Schmelling's victory was supremely glorious, relying entirely on his superior technique, New York still cannot recognize him as the World Champion. Moreover, Schmelling defeated Jack Sharkey in the finals in New York on June 12 of last year. If Sharkey is disqualified, then he has defeated Schmelling. If he cannot defeat Sharkey again, he will never be able to stand tall in New York.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Women's Swimming Club Meeting Rescheduled <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Since its inception, the Shanghai Women's Swimming Club has attracted over twenty members and has begun practicing at the Hongkou Swimming Pool, with Yu Binqi serving as the voluntary instructor. The members are making rapid progress. The club originally planned to hold a meeting at the Chinese Sports Advancement Association to elect officers and formally establish the club to intensify training. However, due to late notification, members from afar (such as students from Guanghua University) were unable to attend on time, and the formal meeting could not be held. The club has rescheduled the meeting to next Sunday (the 12th) at 3 PM at the Hongkou Swimming Pool. Attending members are required to bring their swimsuits, as they will practice swimming immediately after the meeting. The club welcomes new members to join before its formal establishment. Although the election meeting was not formally held the other day, it was reported that Ms. Zhu Shujia and Ms. Qiang Jie and others attended to register, which shows that women in Shanghai have gradually felt the interest in swimming.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The Lorgnette of Fashionable Women</p>
<p>Modern fashionable women do not like to wear glasses, thinking that wearing glasses is a sign of being unfashionable. Therefore, many fashionable women, even if their eyesight is poor, reluctantly socialize and never resort to glasses. However, in the social circles of England in 1929, a type of lorgnette became popular. Generally, fashionable women all have a lorgnette propped on their eyes. They are all made of clear glass, said to enhance beauty. But it is not easy to prop a lorgnette on the eyes. Inadvertently, it often falls off. So they have to be careful and vigilant, as if they have one more thing to worry about. Examining the history of the lorgnette, it was first discovered in 1815. At the congress in Vienna, Austria, there was a diplomat who was the first to wear the lorgnette. After that, gentlemen and beautiful young men from various European countries followed suit. Unexpectedly, more than a hundred years later, it has become an ornament for fashionable women in England again.</p>
<p>The Language of Thieves</p>
<p>In the world, no matter which country they are from, all good looters and petty people have their own unique language. Outsiders do not know it. The lower classes of Chinese society are the same, and it is called “Qie Kou” (slang). Now, there are a group of clever thieves in Europe who have newly invented an internationally used language, specifically for their use. Because their party includes people from England, France, America, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece, they cannot understand each other, which is extremely inconvenient. Therefore, there must be a commonly used world language. Recently, due to the cracking of a major case, a notebook was found, and it was then discovered that there was this newly invented world language of thieves. It is said that in recent years, there have been many unsolved mystery cases that are the masterpiece of this criminal gang.</p>
<h3 id="e187">A Sketch of the Gansu Disaster <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The situation in Gansu is extremely dire, and the people are struggling to survive, even eating elm bark and alfalfa to fill their stomachs. For the past five years, natural and man-made disasters have been pressing down on them. Because it is located in a remote border area with dangerous roads, relief workers are hesitant to move forward. In addition, they have long been under the oppressive power of warlords, and the situation is constrained, making it impossible to appeal for help. The true picture of the disaster has not been fully disclosed and made known to the people of the country, which is extremely heartbreaking. Recently, an old friend, Mr. Mou, came to Shanghai from Gansu and showed me his recent works on eating elm bark and alfalfa, etc. Each word is filled with tears, making it unbearable to read. I am transcribing it for this column and publicizing it on his behalf. I believe that benevolent gentlemen will also approve.</p>
<p>(Eating Elm Bark) Eating elm bark alleviates poverty and hunger, sometimes like roasting fragrant tea, splitting it into pieces like purple Ganoderma, or like grinding and stir-frying flour, making cakes better than minced meat. Scrape the frost off the elm tree with a sharp blade. Plants seem to know, enduring the pain of having their skin peeled and flesh cut away, just to feed the people and enrich their fat. The hungry stomach rumbles like a turning pulley, leaning against the tree twelve hours a day. The old elm tree stands tall, sacrificing itself to help people without complaint. The craftsman turns away, laughing at the elm tree covered in sores. The elm tree cannot speak, but it is cut down. The tree sways in the wind, whimpering. The craftsman laughs at my foolishness; I laugh at the craftsman's ignorance. I not only willingly shed my skin and flesh for people to chew, but also scatter copper coins to help people in times of crisis. The tree is like this; what about people? They retaliate with mockery and criticism, refusing to cure chronic illnesses with arrogance and stinginess. Hoarding wealth leads to destruction; heaven is not deceived. It is cruel not to be a benevolent teacher. Is it right for the many to be poor while the few are rich? Eating peach pits, indulging in jest, let us forget about it. When the elm tree cries out triumphantly, I hear tears like silk. Must one have wealth to help the world? When will a thousand granaries and ten thousand storehouses fill the void? Must one have position to save the country? Who can rely on scholars to assist the world and govern the people? It is better to follow and relieve the urgent needs, offering food and clothing to the weak and weary. Every bit of thread, every inch of cloth, every handful of rice, accumulating good deeds brings blessings; what is there to doubt? Do you not see ants carrying a thousand catties, each doing their best without fault? Do not laugh at the old elm tree as a money tree; the old elm tree scorns the obsession with money. Heavenly winds scatter elm coins, nourishing the poor children morning and evening. Poor children play, breaking branches. When the branches are broken, blood drips. Sharpening knives, they head towards the tree, diminishing it day by day, making it weak. Weak, alleviating poverty and hunger. Alleviating poverty and hunger, eating elm bark. (Alfalfa) Poor women in Tao River area gather alfalfa. Three or five female companions plan to fill their stomachs. Han fields are desolate, Hui fields are lush. Hunger drives us to compete. One catty of alfalfa costs one hundred and six coins. Hui people cherish it like wheat and beans. They cannot be stopped, they whip and beat each other. They snatch shovels and trample on baskets, retaliating quickly. Poor women flee, crying. One middle-aged wife lies stiff and prostrate. (Niansheng Gui's wife is seriously injured and unable to get up.) They kick her with old fists. Blood and bruises spread across her flesh. The injury is so severe that it is difficult to recover her vitality. Her life or death is unknown in the ditch. Poor people protect their food; who can blame them? They hate the landlords with houses full of grain. In ancient times, benevolence extended to plants and trees. Today, people are stingy and unwilling to share even thin gruel. The many are poor while the few are rich, hoarding for nine years. Being rich without benevolence does not accumulate blessings. I hear the hair standing on end, and I cut paper into strips. I urge the county magistrate to punish the wealthy families, so that the hungry people can be nourished and the greedy people will not hoard in the valleys. Hunger and drowning weigh on my mind, reading letters and lodging. Before half of the poem is written, tears fill my eyes. I will take it back to tell the pastor. I expect him to be heartbroken and unable to read it.</p>
<h3 id="e188">What is the Pleasure of Dancing? <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>In recent years, the dance craze has flourished in Shanghai. Every time the lights come on, handsome men and beautiful women gather, dancing gracefully to the music, embracing each other tightly. This joy is something outsiders cannot understand. However, since this trend has become popular, many young people have become addicted to it. A group of glamorous women haunt these places, using their seductive skills to captivate the masses and draw them into their trap. From then on, the entertainment venues have transformed into money-devouring dens, where people are known to lose their fortunes and their jobs. The wings of love are broken, and danger lurks everywhere. The authorities are indulging in pleasure and luxury, unaware that in a blink of an eye, they have fallen to an irredeemable state. Concerned individuals worry about it. Recently, it has been heard that the Star Motion Picture Company's sound film "Such is Paradise" uses the dance floor as a background and deeply depicts it, which is thought-provoking and awakens people from their dreams. It is truly a work that benefits the world and people's hearts, and it can be a warning to those who are obsessed with the dance floor.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Problem of Diet in Hot Weather <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>Since ancient times, our country has paid the most attention to "hygiene." The one who emphasizes this the most should be Confucius. Think about how he “would not eat wine and dried meat bought from the market.” How careful he was about diet. Because the food bought is often poorly prepared and infested with mosquitoes and flies, it is inevitably unclean. It is best not to eat it. Therefore, there is a saying, “What the eye does not see is clean.” If you were to see it with your own eyes, I guarantee you would shake your head and frown, and it would be difficult to swallow. It would indeed be a little scary. Now, I will write down a few of the "scary" situations so that people must pay extra attention to what they eat in the hot weather. The owners of the restaurants must strive to improve their hygiene facilities and must not be stubborn and muddle through, doing that "indirect murder."</p>
<p>Living Things in Roast Duck The day before yesterday, during lunch, I added a roast duck dish at a Muslim restaurant. Although it was an overly sensual duck, it was quite tasty to chew on carefully. Unexpectedly, after eating more than half of it, I suddenly saw something wriggling in the gravy. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be maggots. This was a major setback. I quickly put down my chopsticks and stopped eating, and my stomach was still uneasy. As for where these maggots came from, of course, the duck had a love affair with the red-shifted flies. In addition to transmitting germs, the flies also produce white eggs. These eggs, after a few hours or exposure to sunlight, will turn into maggots. The store did not take precautions beforehand and turned a blind eye afterward, continuing to sell it to people. Imagine how hateful that is.</p>
<p>Special Dragon and Tiger Dish I remember last summer, one night, a few friends and I went to a famous restaurant for dinner. Everyone gorged themselves and had a great time. Later, after the soup was finished, a clear stewed whole duck was served. Everyone ate with relish. Unexpectedly, a gecko was suddenly found in the soup. Everyone was shocked. They called the manager to question him, saying that they had never tasted gecko stewed duck. The man apologized repeatedly and even deducted the price of the duck to settle the matter. I also interjected jokingly, saying that Guangzhou food includes dragon and phoenix gatherings and dragon and tiger dishes. This gecko has the shape of a dragon and the name of a tiger. It can be called a special dragon and tiger dish.</p>
<p>Dried Mushrooms Started Growing Legs One day, a friend and I went to a vegetarian restaurant to eat. We ordered dried mushroom noodles. My friend put on his old glasses and ate with relish. Finally, he clamped a dried mushroom and was about to put it in his mouth when he suddenly froze. He shouted, "Dried mushrooms have started growing legs!" I looked at it. It turned out to be a very large cockroach. The friend then asked the waiter, "Is this noodle vegetarian or non-vegetarian?" The waiter answered very sincerely, "No meat is allowed inside here. Of course, it is vegetarian." The friend said, "Since it is vegetarian, why add this thing inside? My vision has always been halved, and I thought it was a dried mushroom. Are your chefs the same as me?" The waiter had nothing to say and repeatedly apologized. I laughed, saying, "Dried mushrooms growing legs is a joke in a vegetarian restaurant."</p>
<h3 id="e190">A Record of the Shanghai Municipal Government's New Building Laying Ceremony <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Government held the laying ceremony for its new building in the downtown area. This marks the beginning of the Great Shanghai Plan, and its commemoration has profound significance. I also went to watch it and see the situation. We traveled from the Park Shooting Range via the West Sports Association Road, Xiangyin Road, Songhu Road, and Sanmin Road to reach the venue. It was more than ten miles from Shanghai City, and the drive took forty minutes. The trees planted along the road were lush and green, and the road surface was paved with coal ash, which was still relatively smooth. The width was comparable to Nanjing Road. Upon reaching the venue, we saw castle-like archways facing each other to the east and west, which were quite spectacular. To the right of the entrance was the registration area for guests. The receptionist gave us a copy of this issue of the newspaper’s pictorial (because it contained the Great Shanghai film) and an overview of the Shanghai Municipal Central Area Plan. Continuing forward was the venue, a large mat shed that could accommodate 3,000 people. There were two reception rooms, one Western and one Chinese, on the left and right. To the east of the venue were the Health Bureau and staff rest rooms. To the west were two rooms displaying various drawings and models of the Great Shanghai Plan. The production was exquisite, and the planning was detailed. It was not easy to gather artists and engineers to devote their efforts and spend so much effort to create these crystallizations. However, the spiritual and material resources required to realize these various plans will be ten or a hundred times greater.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock, the meeting began with music. Chinese and foreign guests, men and women, were like clouds, no less than two thousand people. The distinguished guests gathered on the stage, and ordinary guests and municipal government officials stood in front of the stage, listening quietly to the great theories. However, due to the light rain, the accumulated water was an inch deep, and almost all the reeds in the field were stained by the dirty water. In several places on the west side, the water was ankle-deep. Someone called it West Lake, which shows how difficult it was to stand. After the ceremony, Mayor Zhang delivered a sincere opening speech, hoping that the central area could be transformed from a desolate land into a prosperous market. Therefore, all administrative, industrial, commercial, and transportation terminals and stations in the Great Shanghai Plan refer to the facilities of various capital cities in order to adapt to modern trends and the needs of citizens. He also said that the central area is the center of the entire Shanghai and should be supported by the efforts of all Shanghai citizens in order to succeed. In his speech, he praised former Mayor Huang Yingbai's enthusiasm for this plan and hoped to hear a word from him. Huang then took the stage to speak after the Director of Public Works, Shen Yi, reported on the preparations. The entire speech was both serious and humorous, arousing the sympathy of the entire audience. He said that Shanghai has a population of three million, which is equal to that of Xinjiang Province. He said that Shanghai's position is important because it is the gateway to the Yangtze River and the barrier to the southeast. It is both a commercial port and a military port. He said that the prosperity of the concession is praised as a medium for Western civilization, and it is destroyed as a tubercle bacillus of China's lung disease. He has a clear understanding of the corrupt phenomenon of the concession in the past eighty years. He hopes that the Great Shanghai will succeed not only in material facilities but also in the spiritual aspects of culture, morality, discipline, and order. Finally, he said that his term as mayor was very short, and all the plans he proposed were just bubbles, empty talk, equivalent to blank checks issued by the bank. Fortunately, Mayor Zhang was able to maintain his credit and cash them, which made the entire audience laugh. Then, Yu Qiaqing, Ye Gongchuo, Wang Xiaolai, and others gave speeches. Wang said that the Shanghai Concession has a history of more than eighty years, like an old and useless person. The Municipal Government is only four years old and will be a promising young man in the future. He hopes that the mayor will complete the Great Shanghai Plan, that the directors of various bureaus and the business and financial sectors will help him complete it, and that the people will urge him to complete it. His words were also very pleasant to hear. At this point, the laying ceremony was held. The mayor held the central area map, plan overview, and business report of the district construction committee, and seven or eight other books were sealed in a purple copper box and embedded in the cornerstone. The cornerstone was slowly placed, and the grand ceremony was completed.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Zi Liang couldn't help but be surprised when he saw it. Sure enough, under the heading of "Stir-fried Shredded Tofu with Pork," there was an item for vinegar in the ingredients list, and it was indeed written as "one tael." The usage of vinegar was also very detailed. Zi Liang was naturally puzzled. He looked at it for a long time before finally discovering a mystery.</p>
<p>"How come your lecture notes skip from page 45 to page 47?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the lady's eyes flashed, and she also seemed very surprised. She came over to take a closer look herself and confirmed that page 46 was indeed missing.</p>
<p>"Blind faith in books is worse than having no books at all! You really know how to use lecture notes blindly! It's missing a page, and you still treat it like a treasure. Page 45 only has three lines about stir-fried shredded tofu with pork, and then it jumps to page 47. Who knows what it's talking about? You just randomly attach it to the stir-fried shredded tofu with pork. Adding vinegar will naturally make it inedible."</p>
<p>"Who would have thought it would be missing a page?"</p>
<p>The two finished their meal reluctantly. Zi Liang didn't dare to delay. He washed his face, grabbed a few toothpicks, and went back upstairs. After all, it wasn't convenient to immediately sit down at the table and work after eating. He needed to rest and recharge. If he stayed downstairs, he would only be bothered by her, so he temporarily escaped to his own territory.</p>
<p>After he went upstairs, he wanted to drink a cup of tea, but he didn't want to go back downstairs, and he was worried that the lady would insist on bringing it up herself, so he decided not to drink it after all.</p>
<p>He paced around in the small space of his attic, sometimes sitting down to read a book on the table. He suddenly remembered: Where's today's newspaper? Why hasn't it been brought up? He didn't want to ask, as it was better to have one less thing to worry about, so he just wouldn't read it.</p>
<p>After resting for a while, he was about to start working, grinding the ink and preparing to write. He'd been constantly disturbed by her in the morning, only managing to correct three books. There were still about 160 books left. How could he possibly finish them today? Just then, there were footsteps on the stairs. The lady was coming again, holding a new notebook in her hand.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Confused Situation <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold standard turned from strong to weak, the situation was chaotic, fluctuating high and low, often with 4-5 tael swings, a total of 18 tael retrospective view before and after the market, and finally fell back by 3 tael and some odd change, people were hesitant, and the subsequent trend was terrifying. The silver market reported a decline, immediately opening higher, especially with the war bond suspension case not yet settled, and large households constantly purchasing, once rising to 726-7 taels, but the exchange rate strengthened and then flattened, the listed price continued to shrink by one grade, and the tail-end dealers and Hengxing and others were selling off, causing the market price to fall sharply, retreating to 720 taels. The market seemed slightly eased at noon, the afternoon market was initially stable and then tired, with the exchange rate easing, and the selling pressure on the table was even more turbulent, and the price was under pressure, difficult to support, and finally broke into 710 taels. As for this morning, the large bar initially looked at continued decline, and then the forecast was hold steady, to be certified.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Morning Opens High <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The opening price for the initial August contract this morning was 717.5 taels, an increase of 3.2 taels (it was heard that the hairy market did over 14 to 16.7 taels), the large bar did fall by 1/8, the silver price fell by 3/8, and the private cable shrank by 7/16. Then, due to the strong buying interest from companies like Tong Taichang, Shunli, Bingxing, Wanxing, Qian Changxiang, and Chengfengshui, and the initial purchase of 875 taels of British gold by the Dalian gang, which then showed strength, and banks mutually trading at 75 to 6875, the gold price rose further, up over 9 taels, a sudden jump to 27 taels, which was then sold by Yuan Maoshui, Yuan Heng, and Wupin, and Mitsui issued August British gold at 6875, absorbing September at 75, so the gold price sharply reduced by more than 3 taels, to 23.5 taels. As for the exchange rate announcement, it shrank by 25, the US dollar by 5 jiao, and the Japanese gold added 2.5 fen, slightly increasing to 25 taels. Later, Tian Daxingyong, Hengxing, Yifengshui, Fuchang, Yuan Heng, and speculators agreed to sell, falling more than 6 taels, to 18.5 qian at 10:00. Then, since the British gold could be settled at 8125, Fuyu, Zhifengshui, and Yixing bought in a short time, pulling up 4 taels, to 22.5 taels. However, the selling interest did not stop and it was still softening, with 18 taels at 10:50. After 11:00, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, Fuyu, Huixiang, and Dadecheng competed, and it was also heard that there was a small Anna from India, so at 11:45, it was 24 taels. The Guangdong gang sold again, falling back to 20.05 qian, and Bingxing and others chased up again, and the bank absorbed British gold at 8125, so the noon closing was 23.8 qian, again doing over 24 taels. The announced price had closed at 751.8 taels, a small press down of 27-8 taels to 34 taels, 28 taels at noon.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Evening Closing Plummets <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 25 taels, and then at 25.5 taels, but the Wupin opened large, in addition to another small three Anna from India. Afterwards, the selling households continued one after another, with Yuancheng, Bingxing, and Richang all selling off. However, the exchange rate was flat, but people's hearts were trending downwards, becoming lower and lower, dropping 7-8 taels. It was heard that there was a swing of over 1 tael, to 17.5 qian at around 3:00, not long after rebounding 2 taels, but Fuyu, Yuan Heng, and retail households were all hedging out. From 3:10 to over 19 taels, it fell to 10.05 qian at 3:50. Daxingyong, Yuyu, Dadecheng, Hengxingyuan, etc. also sold off, almost the British gold also loosened, and Mitsui and Shanghai did the August/September contracts at 875, to 9375, with HSBC eating 9375, dropping to 12 taels and some odd change. It soon plummeted to 09 taels, which was indeed due to the inactivity of buyers, especially with the British gold at 9375, which was not easy to sell. Wanxing and Shunli slightly advanced, rebounding to 11.2 qian. The closing price at 4:30 was 710 taels 09 qian, a decrease of 3.3 taels compared to the previous day, and again pulling up one tael, to around 12 taels. According to the day's maximum price of 27 taels, the minimum price of 09 taels, there was an 18 tael difference, the Wupin was 17.5 qian in the morning market, 23.5 qian at noon closing, 24.3 qian in the afternoon, and 11 taels at the closing market. The announced price counted 27-8 taels to 41 taels, the registered price was 27 taels to 24 taels in the morning, and 14 taels to 11 taels in the afternoon, and the water replenishment was 27 taels to 14 taels.</p>

<p>A few hundred taels of spot bare bars were handled by the Tianjin gang at prices of 14 taels inside and out, sold by Yingfeng Heng and others, but there were not many routes to go, still afraid of depreciating, so the industry colleagues were eager to sell.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Active In and Out <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>

The Guangdong gang sold out more than 2,000 bars, including many sold on behalf of other companies, and then bought in 4-500 bars.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Tighter, Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported declines, the market was flat, and trading was not much, and the HSBC listed prices had shrunk by one grade, counting the British gold as 25, for one shilling, three pence, 625, the US dollar as half a yuan, counting 31 yuan 625, and the Japanese gold added 2.5 fen, for one tael, 5 qian, 6 fen, and the rest also tended to shrink. As for the domestic market, the changes were not small, initially strong, and then tighter, and then there was a swing, turning from stable to loose in the afternoon, and the result was a pull even with the previous day, counting British and American as flat, the Japanese gold slightly reduced by 25, exactly what is called tighter and flat. The gold market front was strong and then frustrated, the waves were turbulent, and Chinese merchants traded quite smoothly. The British gold was initially sold to the Dalian gang and Fuchang Yuanheng by various companies, and then most companies sold more and settled less. However, Mumbai sold out in the morning market and bought in the afternoon, and HSBC repeatedly saw absorption, due to the government settling accounts. The listed price has been shrinking for two days now, totaling about 4-500,000 pounds in transactions, but the gold industry is probably hedging the gold standard, and the US dollar is very scattered, and the Japanese gold was sold by the Dalian gang for more than 1 million yuan, all absorbed by Japanese merchant banks.</p>

<p>Yesterday's silver market situation was generally characterized by weak demand, resulting in a gradual decline. Observing the current situation, without special influences, it seems that there will be further declines, which is evident to us. However, summer is traditionally a quiet period, and this year is no exception. Only this foreign exchange turnaround may stimulate commercial activity, suggesting a glimmer of hope for the market afterward.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Interest Rates Generally Stagnant <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>

<p>1920 Readjustment Bonds and 1920 Customs Bonds Each Fell by Several Yuan</p>
<p>Other Bonds Also Weakened, with Trading Volume of 21 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading volume of spot public debt was still scarce, and the futures market was also relatively calm. However, buying and selling were not inactive. Regarding the fluctuations of each bond, although the market was quite good, the market prices of various bonds have risen substantially in recent weeks, with only a small difference from the highest point. Therefore, the market is watching, and buying is no longer as active as before, resulting in a reverse trend in bond prices, which turned loose at the initial opening in the morning, and then weakened again. However, the trend remained peaceful, as major players rarely made large-scale transactions. As a result, the 1920 Readjustment Bonds and 1920 Customs Bonds fell by 1 yuan and 2-3 jiao, while others fell by 4-5 jiao to 8-9 jiao. Only the spot prices of the 1919 Customs Bonds and 1919 Readjustment Bonds rose significantly compared to last week. The total trading volume of spot goods for the day was only 13,000 yuan, and futures trading was over 21 million yuan, with the 1920 Customs Bonds accounting for over 8.3 million yuan, and the 1920 Rolled Bonds and 1919 Readjustment Bonds each accounting for several million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market turned downwards again, showing a weak trend. This was because the overseas cotton yarn situation was consistently declining, and the sentiment in the local market softened. Moreover, a certain large firm's intention to sell had not ceased, and rumors circulated in the market that deliveries were due in the coming months. Consequently, the bearish sentiment became stronger, and as soon as the market price rose, sellers flocked in. However, in reality, there should be a possibility of stabilization. However, the inventory of 10-count coarse yarn was too large, and sales were lacking. Therefore, short sellers occasionally covered their positions on dips.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Human Label Falls Below 60 Taels <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The pre-market opening of the human label at the exchange saw a decline in the prices of American cotton third-grade yarn. Due to the selling by major firms, the market loosened further, with prices falling by 5, 7, and 8 qian. The afternoon market remained weak, with sluggish actual sales. Prices for each month fell by another 4, 5, 6, and 7 qian. The total transaction volume was 37,250 bales. Mei Kee sold 1,550 bales, He Shen sold 2,450 bales, Tai Xing sold 1,050 bales, Da Kee sold 1,000 bales, and Yi Chang sold 1,100 bales. Shen Xin bought 1,500 bales, Yi Cheng bought 1,100 bales, Shen Kee bought 1,350 bales, Rong Xing bought 1,150 bales, and Geng Feng bought 1,100 bales.

<p>The cotton market turned weak again, with an unusually mediocre situation. This was because the overseas market situation showed no signs of improvement, and the yarn market faced pressure from a portion of coarse yarn, resulting in a dim outlook. The demand was especially disappointing. Although current inventory was low, the factories considered the quality and color to be poor, resulting in no interest in purchasing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sources for each group increased, with about 30 to 40 dealers facing sluggish sales. The thick japonica rice was cheaper due to the softening of prices in Wuxi. However, the Suzhou market remained stable. Buyers were less enthusiastic due to the surge in goods. The opening price was reduced by 1 chi. Dealers from thin indica rice villages sold several hundred dan, with prices similar to the previous day. The Du Bu sharp rice also weakened today, with a sudden decline in sales and a decrease of 1.5 chi. The sales of imported sharp rice were two-fold, with prices unchanged. There was still a large supply of glutinous rice, with no transactions and a soft price trend. River factories offered about 2,600 to 2,700 dan of various goods.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Hu Nan <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, 21-22 ships arrived from the Pu River. The most transactions were for thin indica rice in urban and rural areas, with stable prices. There was little interest in Changzhou-Wuxi thick japonica rice and Suzhou-Tongzhou white japonica rice. It was impossible to sell Pingwang and Li Li rice without lowering the price. The sales of early rice from Tinglin and Ye Xie were especially sluggish, with prices discounted by about 1 chi. There was still a small number of customers interested in imported Du sharp rice, and the market had stabilized. Passenger sharp rice was affected by imported rice, with prices discounted by about 1 chi. Yin Yuan arrived in large quantities, and sales continued actively, with prices holding steady. There was a lack of incoming Saigon rice, with some inventory remaining. The weather turned sunny, and local sales were poor, resulting in a lower outlook.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for various months were generally stable. Although foreign wheat continued to decrease slightly by 0.3 qian, the gold price rebounded. Although the weather was sunny, it was unusually hot and humid, and there was concern that it would rain, so the market remained stable with little fluctuation. After the opening in the afternoon, due to the still good weather, the sentiment of the domestic groups softened. Moreover, a certain factory slightly reduced its holdings recently, and the market became even quieter. The actual sales at present feel particularly quiet, and even the spot sales in Tianjin are inferior to those of previous years. The future changes should not deviate from this. As a result, the current month was down 5 li from the previous day, August, September, and October were down 1 fen, November and December were down 1 fen and 2.5 li, and December was down 1 fen, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Wheat <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed a weakening trend for each month in the morning and afternoon openings. The weather had cleared, and the quoted price of foreign wheat continued to decrease by about 0.3 qian. The oversupply of foreign wheat production still did not improve due to the exchange rate. The market sentiment naturally changed again. Moreover, since the harvest of new wheat, the Shanghai factory has always been watching and has not made large-scale purchases. This situation has never happened in previous years, and the nervous sentiment had to soften. As a result, the current month was down 4 fen from the previous day, August was down 2 fen, and other months were each down 1 fen. The spot wheat market remained quiet, and major factories did not pay attention. Yesterday, more than 1,200 bags of Liuhe, Chuzhou, and Nanjing wheat were opened, and Xin Da handled it, it was said.</p>

<p>Continuous Heavy Rain...Almost to the Point of Having Sales but No Market</p>
<p>The early batches of summer silkworms in the four towns of Yu Hang this year were mostly abandoned, so they supplemented with late silkworms. The harvest was still poor, with an overall yield of no more than 40%. New cocoons went on the market at 56 yuan, and arrivals were not strong. Various firms competed to collect high-quality cocoons, and the price of improved silkworm eggs had already opened at 52 yuan. Continuous heavy rain prevented villagers from bringing cocoons to the market to sell, and arrivals in the market became increasingly scarce, almost to the point of having sales but no market. Cocoon prices are expected to rise by 23 yuan, it was said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Lake Chou and Ping Shui Green tea market at the local foreign firms' tea market saw sales to Europe become brisk. The total sales for the entire market, including shrimp eyes, sesame pearls, needle eyebrows, and show eyebrows, were over 4,700 boxes. The selling price was unchanged from before. Lu Zhuang's precious eyebrows, needle eyebrows, and other green teas were also purchased by Xie He, Bao Chang, and other firms. The market was slightly active. Only the China Tea Company exclusively purchased Keemun black tea, and foreign firms were still watching. The market situation was quite quiet, it was said.</p>

<p>The transaction of new iron wire suddenly had a vigorous trend yesterday. A total of 70-80 barrels were transacted, and the market price was 14 taels and 2.5 qian per box. Although there was no increase or decrease from the previous price, the internal situation was more robust than before. It was heard that the buyers were all customers from the Yangtze River area, and various groups in Tianjin and Yantai have also been inquiring recently. According to industry insiders, the current inventory is not large, and the market may have hopes of rising in the future, it was said.</p>

<p>The venue was located between Sanmin Road and Wuquan Road. At the east and west entrances, tall archways resembling city walls were erected. On the right side of the road, two reed mat sheds were built. One was a drawing room, with many drawings of municipal buildings and residences hanging inside. The other was a model room, storing models of the Municipal Government and the Finance Bureau, as well as a complete model of the Greater Shanghai Plan. A large platform was erected to the south of the venue. The venue was covered with national flags and equipped with amplified microphones. In the center of the cornerstone laying platform was a cornerstone, about four English feet in cube. At 10:15 AM, the Municipal Public Security Bureau Military Band played music, opening the meeting. Mayor Zhang presided over the meeting, following the established protocols. The chairman delivered an opening speech. Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi reported on the preparations. Guests Huang Yingbai, Yu Qiaqing, Ye Gongchuo, and Wang Xiaolai delivered successive speeches. Then music was played, guiding the audience to the cornerstone laying platform on the opposite side, where Mayor Zhang performed the cornerstone laying ceremony. Afterwards, a rectangular copper box, about one and a half English feet long and one English foot wide, containing various souvenirs, was buried in the center of the cornerstone with cement. Then the ceremony was declared complete and the meeting adjourned. The inscription on the cornerstone read: "July 7th, 20th Year of the Republic of China, Shanghai Municipal Government Cornerstone Laying Commemoration, Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun."

I am extremely grateful for your presence in the summer heat to offer guidance. Shanghai is one of the world's renowned commercial ports, and its importance goes without saying. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has been recognized that special efforts in municipal administration are necessary to meet the needs of the times and achieve the goal of building a Greater Shanghai. Therefore, on July 7th of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the establishment of Shanghai Special Municipality and the Municipal Government was initiated, and it has been four years now. Recalling the beginning of the founding, the first Mayor, Mr. Huang Yingbai, was the popular choice of the time. His grand plans and regulations were also a model for later generations, worthy of lasting influence. In April of the 18th year, I was entrusted with the responsibility of this municipality. I deeply felt the importance of my duties and dared not be negligent or idle. Because I recognized the rapid increase in the city's population and the skyrocketing land prices, the housing problem for the citizens was the most difficult to solve. As for transportation, the land and water facilities had no connection, causing much inconvenience for travelers and cargo transportation. Moreover, the concessions running through the entire city hindered the central government's administrative facilities and development in this city. After careful research and planning by my colleagues, it was proposed in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China to designate more than 5,000 acres of land north of Xiangyin Road, south of Zhayin Road, east of Songhu Road, and west of the Ten Yitu of Zhounan as the construction area of the City Center. After being submitted to the Municipal Government Meeting Construction Discussion Committee for approval, it was reported to the Central Government for approval. This area is adjacent to Wusong in the north, connected to the concessions in the south, leads to the Huangpu River in the east, and is close to the railway in the west. The transportation is very convenient. It is the most suitable location in the entire city. Once the ideal commercial port is built and the railway lines are reorganized, the prosperity of future undertakings can be expected in the near future. After completing the necessary procedures, the Municipal Government established the City Center Area Construction Committee, recruited professional talents, and tasked them with handling the matter, still under the leadership of the Director of the Public Works Bureau. Over the past year, concrete plans have been formulated, such as the allocation of administrative, commercial, dock, and residential areas, which have been planned separately. In addition, the important trunk roads connecting the docks, railways, and various urban areas have also been specified in detail, approved, and implemented. Several roads have already started construction or will soon start construction. From now on, progressing in order, this desolate and barren area will become prosperous and completely transformed in a few years. As for the organization within the area, models from various countries' municipal administrations have been adopted and adapted to our country's society. Facilities such as parks, stadiums, and other equipment related to human health are required to be complete. Furthermore, a portion of the land in the area, about 800 acres, which is the most valuable and easily developed, will be publicly reclaimed at the original land acquisition price, including the necessary expenses for road construction and drainage. The purpose is nothing more than to allow citizens to enjoy the benefits of the city center area, and the Municipal Government will not charge excessive fees. As for construction, the most suitable house building styles will be solicited for builders to choose and refer to. At the same time, citizens will be encouraged to operate and build, in order to promote the development of the City Center. Furthermore, the design of the new commercial port is also in active planning. The location is near Wusong Town, where the river is deepest, which facilitates the berthing of giant ships and also facilitates connection with the railway. Regarding the railway issue, discussions are also underway with the Ministry of Railways to implement more convenient methods in the future. In addition, a new dock area is planned at a deep-water location in the east of the City Center area to meet current needs. The above plans will surely be realized in a considerable amount of time. As for the content of each plan, due to time constraints, a detailed report cannot be given today. If you would like to know the details, please refer to various publications and today's report by the Director of the Public Works Bureau. Finally, I have one more thing to say to all the guests: this City Center area is the city center area of the entire Shanghai city, not the city center area of the Municipal Government. Therefore, regarding construction issues, I hope that all citizens and the Municipal Government will jointly bear this important responsibility. The Municipal Government will act as the vanguard, first building office buildings here. Starting from the day of today's cornerstone laying ceremony, construction will be completed within one and a half years. Various subsidiary structures and necessary equipment will also be carried out simultaneously. In January of the following year, the Municipal Government colleagues will be able to move here to work, so as to supervise and promote the success of the construction of this area. However, at the beginning of construction, many things need to be carried out. The talents and resources of my colleagues are limited, and I am deeply afraid that we will not be able to achieve perfection. I hope that all of you will provide guidance and correct our shortcomings. Today is the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Municipal Government. We will never forget the pioneering spirit of the first Mayor, Mr. Huang Yingbai. I have specially invited Mr. Huang to come here from Moganshan to participate in the ceremony and provide guidance. I would like to introduce him to everyone so that you can listen to Mr. Huang's remarks."</p>
<h3 id="e245">Director Shen's Speech <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Director of the Bureau of Public Works, Shen Yi, gave a speech about the Shanghai Municipal Government's preparations for building new houses, saying: Although the construction of new municipal government buildings and the development of the city center area have been advocated by the Shanghai Municipal Government for just over a year, the motivation can be traced back to four years ago. When the Municipal Government was established in July of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the first mayor of this city, Mr. Huang Yingbai, realized that the previous municipal administration was corrupt and that thorough reform plans were necessary for rectification. Therefore, on the one hand, he sought to fully consolidate the organization of the ten bureaus of the Municipal Government, and on the other hand, he first requested the Central Government to determine the scope of the city area, including Wusong, Jiangwan, Dachang, Yanghang, and other districts. The above two points have a close relationship with the subsequent development of municipal administration in this city. Mayor Huang resigned less than two months after taking office, and Mr. Zhang Boxuan succeeded him as mayor. All undertakings continued as before. In November of the 16th year of the Republic of China, a Design Committee was established to study various municipal issues. In order to understand the current situation of each city area, in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he led the directors of each bureau to inspect each city area and conduct on-site surveys. At the same time, a part of the city area was taken over, making the selection of the city center area directly under the Municipal Government largely related to this. It was unexpected that the new municipal government buildings could be based here today, which is deeply memorable. At that time, it was realized that the Municipal Government was remotely located in western Shanghai, and the bureaus were scattered throughout the city. The transmission of documents was time-consuming, and citizens found it particularly inconvenient to travel back and forth. Therefore, there was a plan to build municipal government buildings. In September of the 17th year of the Republic of China, a Preparatory Committee for the Construction of Municipal Government Buildings was established. Later, because the construction of the Municipal Government required a large amount of money, which was not easy to realize at that time, and the School of Arts and Crafts opposite the Xinpu Yutang in southern Shanghai had been closed for a long time, it was quite suitable for the offices of the Municipal Government and its bureaus. Therefore, in November of the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was decided to formally lease the school, and a contract was signed at the end of that year, with March 1 of the 18th year of the Republic of China as the date of relocation. Soon after, Mayor Zhang Boxuan resigned, and the matter was suspended. When Mayor Zhang Yuejun took office, he made the construction of a new city area his ambition. He believed that borrowing the School of Arts and Crafts as office buildings for the Municipal Government and its bureaus was not a thorough solution, as it was uneconomical and would indefinitely prolong the construction of new municipal government buildings. Therefore, he advocated not moving temporarily, but actively planning the new city area and preparing to build new municipal government buildings. This was in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China. In July of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the plan for the city center area was announced, and the City Center Area Construction Committee was established. At the same time, the Municipal Government Construction Committee was abolished, and all matters related to the construction of the Municipal Government were transferred to the City Center Area Construction Committee for handling. Mayor Yuejun also believed that the city center area was still a vacant lot, and he was deeply concerned that investors would hesitate to move forward, which would affect the future development. Therefore, he resolutely advocated building municipal government buildings in the city center area first to promote it, and designated funds from the first municipal public bond issued in this city to be used for operating the city center area. On the one hand, the City Center Area Construction Committee selected the location for the new buildings, engaged in planning, and in order to gather ideas and broaden benefits, in January of the 19th year of the Republic of China, a reward was offered for the design of the municipal government buildings. In July of the 19th year of the Republic of China, an architect's office was established to draw up formal plans, and architect Dong Dayou was hired to take charge. In May of the 20th year of the Republic of China, bidding began, and the Zhu Senji Construction Company won the bid for 548,000 yuan. Construction officially began in early June and is expected to be completed by the end of the 21st year of the Republic of China. The new building is more than 30 meters high, more than 90 meters long, and 25 meters wide. The exterior adopts the Chinese architectural style. The building has four floors. The ground floor is for offices, a cafeteria, etc. The second floor is for the auditorium, conference room, and library. The third floor is all offices. The fourth floor is for archives and storage rooms. After the construction is completed, in addition to the secretariat, it can accommodate approximately two bureaus for office work. The remaining bureaus will temporarily build temporary houses to the north of the new municipal government buildings, which will also begin construction soon. On the occasion of the groundbreaking ceremony, I respectfully report the preparations as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Huang Yingbai's Speech <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has been established for four years, and today is exactly the beginning of the fifth year. It is also the date for the groundbreaking ceremony of the new municipal government buildings. Mayor Yuejun insisted on inviting me to attend because I have a two-time historical relationship with Shanghai in the first year of the Republic of China and the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Therefore, I came down from the mountain a few days ago to participate in this grand event, and I feel a limited amount of pleasure in my heart. Now, I will briefly share with you my thoughts. Shanghai is a major port for trade between China and foreign countries, with many railways and merchants gathering here. It has become one of the world's largest commercial ports. In recent years, its development has been particularly rapid, and I heard that the population has reached three million, ranking first among all cities in the country. Politically speaking, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has implicitly grasped the center of national politics, economy, and diplomacy. Geographically speaking, Shanghai is the gateway to the Yangtze River and the shield of the southeast, possessing the qualifications of both a military port and a commercial port. The National Government, recognizing its important position, explicitly promulgated Shanghai as a special city in the summer of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Although the name of special city no longer exists, its special nature does not change due to the name. However, Shanghai has a concession with more than eighty years of history. What is now called Shanghai is actually more than half of its essence within the concession area. What is a concession? Why does it exist only in our country? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the concession for our country? In recent years, the inland has become increasingly impoverished. Why can the concession accelerate its prosperity? These questions cannot be answered in a short speech. What can be said is that the existence of concessions in our country originated from a treaty of "necessity". For the past eighty years, those who praise it call it a medium for Western civilization, and those who slander it call it tuberculosis of the Republic of China. In fact, everything is intricate and cannot be observed simply. Civilization is a medium, and so is evil. Microbes cause disease, and microbes can also cure disease. This is why the contradictory phenomenon of the Shanghai concession is formed: everyone slanders it, but it flourishes every year. However, microbial treatment is ultimately a temporary and necessary measure, while the medium of evil is a great danger to the country. Today, people strongly advocate the recovery of concessions. They do not know that forcible seizure is not only impossible, but also feels inappropriate. Begging not only will not be allowed by others, but also puts us in what position? Li Wenzhong once said that there is no diplomacy in the international arena, only self-reliance. For example, in dealing with friends, each other must have considerable qualifications. I want to contact him, and he also wants to contact me, and then we can be called friends. If I have no foothold and only want to rely on others, even if I speak eloquently, it will be useless. When I first arrived in Shanghai, foreign soldiers were very rare and arrogant, thinking that I must rely on them completely. They hesitated and watched, intending to coerce me. They saw that our soldiers looked tattered and laughed, saying that they were a group of beggars and how could they fight. I ignored them and used my own army to fight. After fighting a few times, they saw that we had some ability and gradually wanted to come forward. I asked them even less. Later, we won even more battles, and our military reputation was greatly enhanced. Seeing that I did not ask for their help, they felt that it was meaningless and came again and again to ask to volunteer. I said that it would be good to help me fight, but they must be under my command and control, and the rewards and punishments for merits and demerits must be according to military orders. They agreed one by one and then I used them. They really obeyed the agreement and made great contributions. Gordon also gained a great reputation. If my own army was not good enough, they might not help even if I asked. If they did help, it would become a case of the guest taking over the host, and I don't know how much convenience they would take and how many hidden dangers they would leave behind. Alas, our country's future handling of the Shanghai concession issue is the same. We can know what to do. As mentioned above, the important position of Shanghai is so important, and its relationship is so complex. Therefore, the construction of Shanghai is a common and urgent need for the country and the local area. When implementing the construction, we must also consider national defense, industry, commerce, transportation, and territorial integrity. The significance is far-reaching, and the responsibility is heavy. It is completely different from ordinary municipal facilities. The most suitable location for the Shanghai city center area, based on the situation of Wusong Port, should be the area east of Jiangwan Town, which is the location currently selected by the Municipal Government. It can centrally control the north of Wusong Port and the south of the Shanghai urban area. When the Jiangqiao Bridge is completed in the future, it will be even more convenient for the development and facilities of Pudong. The reason why the concession did not select this location in the past may be because it was too far from the city, there was a lack of workers, transportation was inconvenient, and trade was scarce. They had to accommodate the facts and start with the area near the city, along the Huangpu River, which is now called the Bund. If this location had been selected in the past, I know that in these eighty years, half of it would have been due to the needs of reality and half of it would have been due to the perfection of planning. Gradually, the concession would have been connected to Wusong, like Go, forming a corner on its own. We would have no room to add a living eye. Therefore, this city center area can be said to be a suitable land specially left by heaven, giving us the opportunity to renew ourselves and extricate ourselves. This is what people across the country should cherish, support, and promote. The construction of Shanghai is a common and urgent need for the country and the local area. I have said this before. But do we hope that the national financial resources will be used for construction? I am afraid that with so many construction projects urgently needed across the country, we cannot focus all our efforts on one corner. Or do we hope that local financial resources will be used for construction? Facts show that the mere three million Shanghai citizens cannot shoulder the heavy responsibility of the whole country. Therefore, I believe that we should divide national affairs and local affairs into two categories. Local affairs should naturally be borne by local financial resources, such as public security, sanitation, primary and secondary education, land consolidation, public utilities, civil engineering, and all industrial, commercial, and other social affairs. As for national affairs, except for the fortification equipment, which should be directly responsible by the military department, and the location of the station, which should be jointly determined with the railway department, and the railway department should implement it on a regular basis, the remaining items, such as wharf construction, water and land transportation, and Jiangqiao construction, are local affairs with the nature of national affairs. The government should subsidize the shortage of local financial resources with national financial resources, designate funds, and allocate them to the Municipal Government on a regular basis, so that it will be easy to do things and it will be reasonable. In short, Shanghai is not only Shanghai for Shanghai people, but also Shanghai for the whole country, which has a major impact on politics, economy, industry, trade, diplomacy, and military affairs. If all construction projects are considered to be what Shanghai citizens should have, and the Shanghai Municipal Government does not consider itself to be the government of Shanghai, but considers itself to be the municipal government, then it would be a big mistake. At the same time, colleagues in the Municipal Government should pay attention to the cultural construction, moral construction, discipline construction, and order construction of the new Shanghai during the process of material construction. Otherwise, ten or twenty years later, even if the material construction is brilliantly prepared and completely matches the current concession, ask whether the spiritual life and material life of the citizens living in the concession today are consistently satisfactory? I know that it will not be the case. We often travel to major cities in Europe and the United States, and most of them have what is called the upper city and the lower city. The lower city has chimneys like forests, wharves like combs, clerks, workers, and heavily loaded trucks coming and going on the road, like weaving. The upper city has beautiful residences, great universities, solemn churches, quiet parks, magnificent libraries, and noble entertainment venues gathered together to form another world. In the city, whether it is the upper or lower city, not only are there no armed soldiers, but there are also few police officers with guns. However, the residents and travelers all have a sense of living and working in peace and contentment, and being active and enterprising. Alas, enriching and educating people at the same time, and spiritual life and material life are advancing together, is why Europe and the United States have become Europe and the United States. Fortunately, Shanghai</p>

<p>Although the Municipal Government has often suffered from the lack of unified administration since its establishment, it has been able to refer to both theory and practice, and respond and deal with it appropriately, either by welcoming or rejecting. Although the military has not yet ended its financial exhaustion, it has still been able to improve the old urban area and promote the new urban area within its reach. Its achievements are seen by us, and the ideal of the Shanghai city center area plan for several years is now beginning to be implemented. This is a gratifying phenomenon. I believe that today it is more appropriate to consider the founding of the new city hall, and to consider it the founding of the city center area. If we can achieve the expectations mentioned above, and get the central government's subsidies, the nation's love, the citizens' trust, and the continued efforts of the colleagues in the Municipal Government, I know that the speed of the results and the impact will be greater than what can be imagined today. Recalling what I said four years ago today, when I took office as the first mayor of this city, I said, "In addition to the goal of building a great Shanghai, we must not allow those who want to occupy our territorial sovereignty for a long time to use it as an excuse. We must not allow those who are jealous of our party's success to say that all slogans and all doctrines are an unredeemed paper currency." Although I made this statement, I soon left, so that the "Greater Shanghai" banknote I issued could not be redeemed. Fortunately, the successors, such as former Mayor Zhang Boxuan, today's Mayor Yuejun, and all colleagues in the Municipal Government, have been able to maintain the credit of the banknote, and Mayor Yuejun is even preparing to start redeeming it. Therefore, I am here today to participate in the ceremony, and the kind of joy in my heart is indescribable. The ancients said, "Its beginning is simple, and its end will be huge." I dare to borrow this saying to wish the success of the city center area of Greater Shanghai. Xuan Yuqiaqing, Wang Xiaoyu, and Ye Gongchuo gave speeches on behalf of the citizens, which are omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Protests from All Circles Against the Korean Anti-Chinese Case <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams and Declarations</p>
<p>Righteous and Stern</p>
<p>The Korean anti-Chinese riots are worsening day by day. The government has not yet made any response, and all circles are filled with grief and indignation upon hearing the news. Yesterday, they all sent telegrams of protest. Now, they are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e248">City Chamber of Commerce Telegram <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, saying: The Japanese are using the Wanbaoshan incident to instigate Koreans to persecute overseas Chinese, in order to alienate the feelings between China and Korea and achieve their goal of invading the East Province. The basis for Korean migration to China is Article 3 of the Sino-Korean Border Affairs Treaty of the Tujingmen in the first year of Xuantong. According to this article, the so-called Chinese government still allows Koreans to reside in the cultivated land north of the Tumen River, which only refers to the places already cultivated north of the Tumen River in the first year of Xuantong, and allows them to continue to reside there. It is not a limitless permit for them to continue to occupy and cultivate land in the future. Therefore, the fact that Korean farmers have arbitrarily occupied and cultivated paddy fields in the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin is actually because the authorities of the province failed to adhere to the Tumen River Treaty and only sought to gain a false reputation for appeasement. Looking back at the Japanese in Korea, on the one hand, they secretly induce Koreans to promote anti-Chinese sentiment, and on the other hand, they restrict Chinese workers with orders from the Governor-General's Office, doing everything possible. Therefore, the plan to get to the root of the matter today is to imitate the Sino-French Special Treaty on Vietnamese Commerce and formulate a special treaty on reciprocal trade between overseas Chinese and Koreans in Korea. There should be restrictions on the number and area of ​​cultivating farmers and immigrants, and the principle of mutual immigration should be determined. Before this special treaty is signed, the Tumen River Border Treaty should be strictly observed, and new immigrants should not be allowed to cultivate beyond the border, so as to avoid disputes at any time and place. As for the situation of hostility towards Chinese in Incheon and other places, your ministry should telegraph the Japanese ambassador and resident consuls in Korea to properly negotiate and protect them. Incheon is close to the coast, and warships can reach it. If it can be negotiated by the Bohai Fleet to send ships to patrol, it will also be enough to comfort the overseas Chinese. You should submit it to the National Government for consideration and handling. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully asks.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Declaration of the Three District Party Headquarters <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>(Title omitted) It is noted that recent reports indicate that Japanese newspapers have fabricated the Wanbaoshan incident and incited Koreans to kill overseas Chinese. The news has spread, and we are filled with grief and indignation. Since Korea was annexed by Japanese imperialism, it has been subjected to all kinds of oppression, almost inhuman. Although patriots from the country have repeatedly risen up to shout and run for revolution in recent years, they have been unable to do anything due to excessive oppression. Recently, Japanese imperialists have seen that our national revolution is about to be completed, and the late Premier's will to support small and weak nations must be realized. The Japanese imperialists also suffer from overpopulation and urgently need to immigrate abroad. The only colony they see is the area of ​​Manchuria and Mongolia in our country. Therefore, they incite Koreans to immigrate to Manchuria and Mongolia, while immigrating their own people to Korea. People with discerning eyes have long known this specific invasion plan. It is a pity that the Korean people are ignorant of the matter and willingly act as puppets of Japanese imperialists, and are deeply poisoned by their cruel plan. How painful it is! In addition to submitting a request to the central government to severely order negotiations, the association also hopes that the Korean people will quickly return to the banner of the Blue Sky and White Sun, stand on the same front, and attack Japanese imperialism. Then, when the violent Japanese collapse, it will be the time for your Korean people to be liberated. Which to go to and which to follow, please think carefully. (Omissions below)</p>

<p>(Title omitted) Repeatedly reading reports that Koreans are anti-Chinese, like madmen and lunatics, and that overseas Chinese in Korea have been brutally massacred, the situation is dangerous and has reached this point. We are deeply indignant. The current Korean riots originated from the Wanbaoshan incident, and the Koreans there forcibly planted on the farmland of Chinese farmers. After the opposition of our farmers, the Japanese imperialists actually sent Japanese police to shoot our farmers with live ammunition, causing innocent deaths and injuries, to carry out their brutal acts. It is extremely hateful. The Koreans do not know the great righteousness, recognize the thief as their father, and forget the incitement of the Japanese imperialists behind them. They replay the beastly nature of the riots. The bad news has spread, and those who hear it are shocked. The party headquarters in this district strongly advocates serious negotiations to achieve punishment of the murderers and compensation, and to ensure that the same incident will never happen again. We will not give up until the goal is achieved. The situation is serious. We hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together to protect the survival of the nation. The Shanghai Special City Seventh District Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang respectfully asks.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Telegram from the Six District Party Headquarters <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>(Title omitted) Standing under the banner of helping small and weak nations, we have given deep sympathy and enthusiastic support to the descendants of Jizi, who will never recover. Unexpectedly, their shackles of slavery have not been shaken off by a fraction, and they blindly listen to the instigation of Japanese imperialists. They are using the Wanbaoshan incident as an excuse, and using fierce anti-Chinese methods to show in front of our eyes. They even gather hooligans and indulge in beating. The areas where our overseas Chinese merchants live are all destroyed. This kind of barbarism is hateful. It must be known that the Wanbaoshan incident was entirely caused by Korean overseas Chinese acting as Japanese machines, forcibly planting on our country's farmland. When our people rose up to resist, the Japanese actually used live ammunition to shoot and kill hundreds of Chinese people. The May 3rd massacre was replayed on the outskirts of our country. This is a great shame for our country, and Koreans should also be considered public enemies. The blind and riotous Korean slaves only know to obey the secret orders of the Japanese to launch the attack, and forget the revolutionary friends with the pure white oath. So I say that the anti-Chinese facts in Seoul and other places are not just a small conflict problem, but the vanguard of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, and not just the fuse of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia, but the expulsion of Korean overseas Chinese from the country, making them a suicide squad to open up wasteland. From this, it can be known that the blind anti-Chinese sentiment of Korean overseas Chinese is entirely a predetermined conspiracy by the Japanese, and definitely not the original intention of revolutionary Koreans. We do not want the true spirit of national self-determination to be destroyed by the anesthetics of imperialism, and we do not want to hear the slave Koreans under the iron heel policy and grow into the tools of ambitious empires. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the diplomatic authorities will make serious protests against the Japanese instigating Koreans to be anti-Chinese. On the other hand, we also hope that the government and the people will work together to prevent the national life of the Northeast from being trampled on by Japanese imperialism. That is the new barrier of national self-defense. The colleagues of this association are willing to dedicate millions of bushels of blood from grief and indignation to build the rearguard of the martyrs, to defend against foreign insults and complete our homeland. At this critical moment, the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City Sixth District Executive Committee respectfully asks.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Statement by the Japanese Acting Minister <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>First Defend the Koreans</p>
<p>Then Talk About Aftermath Measures</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai News Agency on the 7th, regarding the unfortunate incident in Korea, Acting Minister Shigemitsu issued a statement to China and foreign countries at noon today. The main idea is that this incident originated from the oppression of Koreans in Manchuria, which led to anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea, and then caused riots by Koreans. It is regrettable that many Chinese people were killed and injured in Pyongyang. Japan will never recognize violence at any time, and will use all its strength to suppress Korean rioters and seek countermeasures for the aftermath. As for the saying that Japan sent troops to Jilin Province, it is completely unfounded. At this important moment in Sino-Japanese relations, I intend to do my best to resolve this unfortunate incident as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e253">This Month, Second Day: Outer Mongolian Troops Shoot at Eurasia Aviation Company's Northbound Aircraft Number Two During Descent <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Aircraft Now Found Safe and Sound</p>
<p>Pilot and Mechanic Seem to Be Captured</p>
<p>According to Li Jingcong, Director of Operations at Eurasia Aviation Company, the company received urgent telegrams from Manzhouli on the third and fourth of this month, reporting that the Eurasia Number Two aircraft, scheduled to fly on Thursday, the second of this month, had not arrived. Simultaneously, a report from Linxi stated that the aircraft had departed on time, leading to the conclusion that the aircraft must have encountered an obstacle between Linxi and Manzhouli. On the fifth and sixth, two aircraft, Eurasia One and Eurasia Three, were dispatched to search the area. According to the report from the pilot of Eurasia One, Eurasia Number Two was found in Outer Mongolian territory. The aircraft is safe and sound, but the pilot and mechanic seem to have been captured. The aircraft attempted to land and provide assistance, but was met with heavy fire from Mongolian soldiers, making it impossible. The company was astonished upon hearing this news. When I (Li referring to himself) and Shi Mide, the Director of the Air Navigation Section, first conducted the straight-line trial flight from Duolun to Manzhouli, it was clear that this route would inevitably pass through Outer Mongolian territory. Fearing that this would easily lead to various misunderstandings, we subsequently took a second flight, detouring through Linxi towards Manzhouli. According to the maps drawn by China and other countries, this route does not require passing through Outer Mongolian territory. Therefore, we decided to change the route to fly from Linxi to Manzhouli. From the trial flight to the official opening of the route, for at least two or three months, there were no obstacles, proving that we did not pass through Outer Mongolian territory. Now, it has been forced to descend because it flew over Outer Mongolian territory. The reasons for this are likely to be one of the following two: (1) When the Number Two aircraft flew out of Linxi, it had to detour through Outer Mongolian territory due to weather conditions; (2) It was forced to descend due to heavy fire from Mongolian soldiers after passing through Outer Mongolian territory. Fortunately, the company is commercial in nature, and the aircraft used are all for postal transport. The routes and markings used are already known to all countries in the world, and Outer Mongolia must also have heard of them. After inspection, it should be released. Currently, the company is still actively trying to rescue the crew. The mail bound for Europe carried that day will not be delivered on time. The company has formally reported this to the post office today.</p>

<p>Ministry of Industry in Talks with Cuban Sugar Merchants</p>
<p>Preliminary Agreement Now Signed, Progressing Actively</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Cuban joint venture for establishing a large-scale sugar factory in Shanghai, which the Ministry of Industry is currently pursuing, Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi told reporters yesterday that this matter is being negotiated and carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Cuban sugar merchants, not with the Cuban government. The capital is set at US$5 million, and the main factory will be located in Shanghai. Both parties have already signed a preliminary agreement. The Cuban sugar merchants have now left Shanghai to return to their country. Once the National Government has reviewed and approved the preliminary agreement, they will come to Shanghai to sign a formal contract. The Ministry of Industry conducted a detailed investigation before handling this matter. According to customs import statistics, the first item is of course yarn, and the second is sugar. Even for China with its 400 million people, according to precise statistics, the average person uses 0.3 to 0.45 yuan of sugar per month, so the quantity needed is enormous. Therefore, establishing a sugar factory is an urgent matter to solve the problem. Kong departed for Beijing last night by night train.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu, and Zhang Shusheng, the Chief of Staff of the Commissioner's Office, hosted a gathering at Gongdelin yesterday at noon, attended by over a hundred people. During the gathering, Commissioner Zhang reported that it has been eight months since he was appointed as Commissioner by the central government. The establishment of the Commissioner's Office was initially limited to four months before being disbanded, which was later extended for another four months. It will expire at the end of July. Although the central government has not expressed whether to retain or abolish it, the Commissioner's Office has already submitted a request to close it down. As for the suppression of bandits, the provincial government can handle it themselves. Therefore, after the Commissioner's Office is abolished, all matters will be transferred to the provincial government. The troops under his command, including the four divisions led by Liang Guanying, will not be transferred elsewhere for the time being and can still work hard to suppress bandits in Jiangsu Province. He expressed deep gratitude to everyone present for their efforts in assisting and hoped for continued support in quickly pacifying the bandits. He added that whether you are from Jiangsu or other provinces residing here, you should all be able to seek happiness for Jiangsu Province. He then reported the intention of establishing the Central Guoshu Institute to strengthen the nation and save the country, and to raise funds. The initiative was launched by Niu Tiesheng, Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others.</p>

If a vegetable vendor's scale is found to be non-compliant during the inspection, it will be stamped with a non-compliant mark and ordered to be repaired. Therefore, it has been decided to hold the inspection as scheduled.</p>

<p>Obtains a Packet of Unslaked Lime</p>
<p>Plots to Blind Xia Amao</p>
<p>Chen Genjiang, from Chongming, lives at No. 1512 Jiaxing Road. His daughter, Chen Amao, is eighteen years old and has a decent appearance. A man from Haimen, Lu Jinwen, twenty-one years old, who is still single, has been coveting Amao for a long time and wants to marry her. However, Amao has already been betrothed to someone else, and Lu Jinwen has been tempting her in every way, but has not been able to fulfill his wish. On the 4th of this month, he said to the girl, "If you don't agree to come with me and be my wife, I will use lime to blind your eyes." Amao resolutely refused, and Lu left in hatred. Fearing that he would actually carry out this vicious act, Amao reported it to the Harbin Police Station. The next morning, Lu met Amao's father, Chen Genjiang, on the road and said, "Your daughter Amao has slept with me twice. Please don't be 元龍高臥 [indifferent], and quickly marry Amao to me, otherwise there will be unfavorable consequences." After speaking, he fled. Chen returned home and questioned his daughter. Amao firmly stated that nothing of the sort had happened, and that Lu's words were completely fabricated. Later, her older sister, Fengmei, also asked Amao whether she had any ambiguous relationship with Lu twice. Amao said that if she had lost her virginity to Lu, she would buy incense and candles and swear to Heaven. The next day, while Chen Genjiang and Amao were out, Lu sneaked into their home and tried his best to persuade Chen Fengmei to marry Amao to him, or to run away from her father, but was scolded by Fengmei and left. Lu then decided to use a poisonous hand and bought a packet of unslaked lime from a certain place. At around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, he rushed to Amao's home, intending to blind her eyes. Unexpectedly, the girl's father, Chen Genjiang, saw Lu Jinwen arriving with a paper bag and knew his intentions. He tried to capture him, but Lu could not resist and dropped the bag and fled. Chen chased after him for about dozens of yards and was intercepted by Hua Police No. 3133, who arrested him along with the lime bag and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and stated that investigations revealed that the defendant had previously committed theft and robbery and was sentenced to two years and seven months of imprisonment. He was also sentenced to fifteen days of detention for soliciting prostitutes. He asked the court to take this into consideration and presented the lime bag as evidence. Amao then stated that the defendant used to be her neighbor, so they knew each other. He often came to her house to look around and tease her, and briefly described the situation. Her father, Chen Genjiang, and her sister, Fengmei, also testified to the previous situation. When questioned by the defendant, his confession was vague and he denied the allegations. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation and questioning.</p>

<p>For Use as Food</p>
<p>Japanese Suffer Blow</p>
<p>Qingdao Port has the largest export of beef every year. The beef in Shandong Province is praised and bought by foreigners. Japanese companies have established special transportation companies in Qingdao to purchase Chinese beef for export, with annual shipments amounting to several million yuan. Recently, the United States has been buying food beef in Shandong, which has aroused jealousy among the Japanese. The first shipment of cattle to the United States is scheduled to depart from Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>The largest export from Qingdao to the East is Shandong beef, which is transported by ships from Japanese mail companies such as Osaka and Harada. It is not certain whether live cattle or slaughtered meat is transported. The Japanese have historically held a dominant position in the export of Shandong beef in Jiaozhou.</p>

<p>This year, American merchants have specially come to Qingdao to purchase a large number of food cattle. Mr. Luo Meng, an American in Qingdao, has placed an order with Shandong cattle merchant Hui Xing.

<p>The first batch of cattle to be shipped to the United States has been agreed upon by the American merchants and Hui Xing to ship 700 head first. However, due to the long distance across the ocean, it has been decided to slaughter them in Qingdao and transport the beef in the refrigerated compartments of the ship, which can still maintain its freshness. The first shipment is scheduled for the 15th of this month, and a ship will be dispatched from Shanghai to Qingdao to act as an agent. After this incident, Japanese cattle exporters are strongly opposed because it has broken their monopoly and raised beef prices.</p>

<p>Yonghe Trading Company at 268 North Suzhou Road in this city consigned 32 pieces of cotton yarn, valued at over 10,000 yuan, to a barge owned by Cao Guan'gen. The barge was moored at the Bund of Beijing Road, intending to transfer the goods to the Dadong Steamer of the Dada Company in the South City for unloading. However, the barge suddenly went missing on the evening of the 5th, and despite searching everywhere, its whereabouts were unknown. Subsequently, the barge captain, Cao Guan'gen, claimed that he feared that the first mate, Jin Hai, had absconded with it. He immediately reported to the Water Patrol Police Station and the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team to conduct a strict search, and also placed a reward notice in the newspaper for his capture. At around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, Ding Xiaoping, the leader of the Fourth Detachment of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team in Wusong, led his team on patrol in the Huangpu River area. While patrolling in a small harbor opposite the Guanghua Oil Depot in Gaoqiao, they caught sight of a barge moored there, unguarded. Upon inspection of the cargo, they found that it was all cotton yarn. Knowing that it was the lost cargo of Yonghe Trading Company, they carefully took inventory, counting 27 pieces. However, as it was low tide at the time, the ship was stranded on the shoal and could not be moved. Later, the tide rose that evening, and the ship was towed to Wusong and impounded. Yesterday, Leader Ding had already reported to the Shanghai General Team to request instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Woman Sues for Property of Two Inns <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a woman named Zhang Jinbao, represented by a lawyer, filed a criminal lawsuit with the French Court, claiming that the plaintiff's birth mother, Zhang Laoer, nicknamed "Antique Laoer," had been running the Huaxing and Xindengfeng inns on Avenue Edward VII for many years. Unexpectedly, after Laoer passed away due to illness in 1928, all the land and buildings of the two inns and all movable property were seized by the bookkeeper Zhou Heshang alone, ignoring her claims. This constitutes the crime of encroachment, and she requests an investigation and the return of all property. The defendant also retained a lawyer to argue that the Huaxing and Xindengfeng inns were indeed opened by Zhang Laoer. The Huaxing Inn was merged into the Xindengfeng Inn due to demolition and reconstruction. When Zhang Laoer was critically ill in April 1928, fearing that there would be no one to take care of her two sons and all her property after her death, she entrusted Lawyer Jiao Kun to make a will, placing her two sons and the business of the inns under the management of the defendant Zhou Heshang, who would raise the two sons and then return the property. There is a will to prove this. He questions whether the plaintiff is Zhang Laoer's daughter, as Zhang Laoer never mentioned it during her lifetime, and the defendant has never even seen the plaintiff's face. The plaintiff's claim is without evidence, and he requests that the case be dismissed. Judge Zhu instructed that witnesses be summoned to court for further questioning and verification.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Accomplice in Robbery of Wages Apprehended <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>Liu Huicheng, a native of Nanjing and the accountant of the Tianzhang Paper Mill at the Yangshupu Wharf, withdrew over 1,000 yuan in banknotes at the factory's office at 38 Avenue Edward VII on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to pay wages. He took a public bus back to the factory. After getting off the bus at Dalian Bay Road in Yangshupu, he had only walked a few steps when four bandits stabbed him in the head with knives, causing him to fall to the ground, and robbed him of 1,258 yuan in banknotes, fleeing in different directions. As a result, one bandit, named Liu Ji, a native of Qingkou, was captured, and 350 yuan in stolen banknotes were found on him. He was taken to the Hongkou Police Station. The injured victim was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. This incident has already been reported in the newspaper. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Liu Baoshan apprehended another accomplice, Xu Abao, a native of Ningbo, at a certain address in Renshou Lane on Avenue Petain. A search revealed no stolen money, only two small knives. He was taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were jointly escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and requested a postponement. The stolen banknotes were presented for inspection. Liu Kunjin, a native of Zhili, testified that he happened to be passing by the cinema and saw many people and heard cries of "Catch the thief!" The defendant was running wildly, and he was stopped by him. The stolen banknotes presented were found in his hand and on the ground. However, the victim, Liu Huicheng, was discharged from the hospital after the doctor bandaged his wounds and is currently recuperating at home, so he did not appear in court to testify. When questioned, Liu Ji confessed that he was selling peaches near the cinema and found the banknotes on the ground. He did not steal them. Xu Abao confessed that he sells Jiaolun cakes and knew nothing about the robbery. The two knives presented were used for cutting cakes. He begged for leniency. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confessions and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and the case to be investigated and questioned at a later date.</p>

<p>Electrocution from Bedside Lamp</p>
<p>His Wife Narrowly Escapes</p>
<p>Wu Jincheng, a native of Qingjiang and a Chinese police officer with badge number 1580 in the Hongkou Police Station, lived at 276 Dayou Lane, Ruijin Road. At around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, during a heavy rain with thunder and lightning, Officer Wu was sleeping in bed. Because he lived downstairs, there was five or six inches of accumulated water, and there was an electrical leakage from the bedside lamp. Wu was electrocuted. His wife witnessed this and rushed to pull her husband down, but she was also electrocuted. When family members heard the commotion, they immediately turned off the power. His brother, Wu Jinshan, also a Chinese police officer with badge number 1187, arrived and took the couple to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. Wu's wife suffered a lighter shock and was not seriously injured, but Wu Jincheng died before he could be treated. The hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Pylon Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the Special District Court was commissioned to examine the body. He opened the case and, after questioning Wu Jinshan and others, concluded that the deceased Wu Jincheng died from electrocution before his death. The body was released to his brother for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Foreign Shipping Companies on the Sichuan River Maintain Equilibrium <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>Freight Rates Not Falling</p>
<p>Proceeding According to Plan</p>
<p>Various foreign merchants in this city believe that the competition among shipping companies on the Sichuan River is too fierce, leading to a sharp drop in freight rates. Furthermore, Chinese merchants' ships are also operating direct routes to Shen and Yu, causing significant damage to the shipping between Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, and between Yichang and Chongqing. The foreign merchants have been meeting for several days. They have recognized that the freight rates for cotton yarn on the Sichuan River have fallen to the point where they cannot be reduced any further. If they fall any lower, the losses will be even greater. Yesterday, a reporter learned that the foreign merchants have reached a final decision: they will change their strategy of lowering prices to maintaining equilibrium. They have agreed that the freight rates for direct shipments of yarn from Shanghai to Chongqing will not be lower than those of Chinese ships, in order to eliminate the price war in the Yangtze River shipping industry and to achieve mutually beneficial cooperation with Chinese ships upstream. They have completely abandoned the previous strategy of price competition and have switched to a more positive approach of operating according to plan.</p>

<p>A National Telegram Was Sent Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the first preparatory meeting of the Sichuan Railway Shareholders' Association in Shanghai on July 2nd at Bansong Garden, where Wu Hua, Duan Zhishu, Tan Fu, Tan Jiqing, Yao Banghua, Zhang Menglin, and Ge Manyin were elected as preparatory committee members, they have been very busy these days with clarifying the whereabouts of the share funds and monitoring the actions of the corrupt railway officials. Yesterday, they sent an express telegram, describing in great detail the inside story of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company. Here is an excerpt: (Omitted above) "We, in order to protect shareholders' rights and eliminate the chaos in Sichuan, have voluntarily initiated the Sichuan Railway Shareholders' Association in Shanghai as the first step for shareholders to exercise their rights. On June 2nd, the first general meeting was held in Shanghai, and the following important resolutions were passed: (1) Fundamentally deny the dissolved board of directors, which has lost its effectiveness, and all illegally appointed false three managers, and send those who openly disregard shareholders and use their names for evil deeds to the authorities for strict investigation according to law. (2) Shareholders in various counties in Sichuan and other places should voluntarily initiate shareholders' associations to further promote a general meeting of all Sichuan shareholders to fundamentally resolve all issues of the company. (3) All existing property and evidence of the company should be cleared and properly handed over to a reliable bank for safekeeping. No one shall dispose of them until after the formal shareholders' meeting is convened. (4) The loan bonds issued by the Bank of Communications should be ordered by the authorities to be handed over by Xie Chi and handled in accordance with the third proposal. A letter should also be sent to the Bank of Communications stating that no funds should be handed over unless a legally responsible person is produced by the company. (5) Urge the past responsible persons of the company to announce the accounts and hand over the accounting records. At the same time, shareholders should investigate the evidence of the corrupt railway officials embezzling share funds and submit it to the shareholders' meeting for thorough investigation. (6) If the frustrated warlords and politicians who intend to erode the share funds still do not repent, their various conspiracies and crimes will be exposed and the National Government will be asked to arrest them. (7) The 2.7 million yuan owed to the company by the Ministry of Railways should not be requested to be transferred to other uses before the shareholders' meeting is convened, and especially should not be interfered with by the Sichuan military and political authorities. (8) This company is of a commercial nature and has full autonomy. No illegal interference from any individual or organization outside the shareholders is permitted. We will spare no effort to achieve these eight points. However, we fear that our strength is weak and that we will not be able to achieve much. We hope that all virtuous people will uphold justice and give us candid advice, and that shareholders in various places will work together to advance our cause and support us so that the future of the Sichuan Railway will have a glimmer of hope and will not be robbed by villains. This telegram is respectfully submitted for your clear instructions. The Sichuan Railway Shareholders' Association in Shanghai, sealed with a yang seal."</p>

<p>— De Xin</p>
<p>My experience with automobile studies is quite shallow, but I have a strong passion for it. Therefore, I have been engaged in automobile research and learning. Aside from attending a specialized automobile school in Shanghai for less than a year, I have not had many opportunities to study and learn from automobile experts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Ford Motor Company of Pudong, Shanghai, has a service school established this year on May 18th. Through the introduction of Manager Lu, I was able to enter the school for more practical training. Although the time was short, I benefited a lot. I must thank teacher Mr. Yu Tengmao and the Ford Company's rich equipment, as well as Manager Lu's enthusiastic introduction. Now, I will briefly describe my six weeks in school, as well as the various excellent and enthusiastic training, to tell the gentlemen who enjoy reading automobile news.</p>
<p>China's automobile industry is still in its infancy. All vehicles needed are purchased from Europe and the United States, and there is no other way to obtain this transportation tool that travels like electricity and surges like clouds. As a result, foreign automobile manufacturers can easily obtain this large Eastern market without any effort. Therefore, all patriotic Chinese people who see this transportation marvel but cannot salvage the situation must rise up and strive to realize the dream of a Chinese automobile factory and reverse this recession. This is why I abandoned my teaching career and ventured into this darkness, hoping to find something. Since there are no good facilities in the country, I have to rely on foreign commercialized technical schools. This is similar to when Western missionary schools had a greater influence when our country's school education began. In Shanghai, there are many European and American automobile manufacturers seeking to sell their products here. In particular, the American Ford factory has come to our country and established a large-scale operation. Its management and sales will probably be in the first position. Recently, there have even been proposals to establish a factory in China for manufacturing. Therefore, in terms of publicity, vehicle owner services, repair parts, and technical training, there are complete plans to meet the various needs of society. This is why there is a service school, specifically to train technicians from various agencies who already have rich experience, and teach them the proper Ford repair methods, the proper use of special tools, and a correct understanding of the planning and principles of Ford engineers' designs. It also tells them the methods of managing Ford, and the rules of managing the factory. Therefore, no tuition or miscellaneous fees are charged. Except for not providing wages, the workers are managed in the same way as the factory's workers. However, they must be introduced by related factories, and they must be able to strictly abide by the factory's rules and have considerable car knowledge before they are allowed to enter the school.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Tengfang is from Guangdong. He specialized in automobile studies in the United States for nearly ten years and worked at the Ford factory. Later, he served as an engineer at the factory for many years. Recently, he was sent back to China as a traveling representative of the Ford factory in China, and also as a teacher at the service school. Mr. Yu is humorous, lively, and extremely enthusiastic. He instructs for eight hours a day without ever tiring. Although he is extremely busy, he never stops lecturing and demonstrating. He is very skilled in both theory and technology. He is not someone who can only talk eloquently or only knows one aspect of the job. Therefore, all the students' questions can be answered very satisfactorily. The following is a description of my studies at the school:</p>
<p>(1) Entering and Leaving the Factory: Every morning at 7:30, I took the free ferry provided by the Da Lai Company from the Customs Wharf on the Bund in Huangpu to the Da Lai Wharf in Pudong. The Ford Company is located on the left side of the Da Lai Company. When entering the factory, I had to wear a badge to show the gatekeeper, and record the time of entry and exit on the time clock machine using my personal card. Then, I entered the changing room to change into work clothes, and at 8:15, the work horn sounded. Each time, Mr. Yu would call the roll. There were about thirty students in my class, all from different places. Some had worked in the automobile industry for seven or eight years, and some for two or three years, while others were not very knowledgeable. Therefore, the results were also not good. At 12:00, I left the factory for lunch. The time was limited to only thirty minutes, so it was very rushed. After lunch, I worked until 4:30 in the afternoon. I washed my hands and changed clothes, and at 4:45, I followed the routine of recording the time of leaving the factory on my card. I then took the Da Lai small ferry back to Puxi. I did this five days a week, except for Saturday, which was a holiday. I worked eight hours a day without any rest or slackness. There were no chairs or benches to sit on, except for standing and squatting. Even when I had to take notes, I could only bend my knees and lean over to do so. Needless to say, my clothes, shoes, hands, and face were always stained with oil. However, the factory grounds, machinery, and tools had to be carefully cleaned and arranged. Therefore, before leaving the factory every day, I had to sweep thoroughly and clean with a broom. As a result, what I saw every morning when I entered the factory was extremely clean and refreshing, as if it had just been set up and no one had ever worked there before. Mr. Yu repeatedly reminded us of this cleaning item.</p>
<p>(2) Factory and Equipment: The school's area is less than one-sixteenth of the entire factory. I estimate its area to be within 15 square zhang. It contains a Ford generator, which is the source of all electricity for the headquarters. All the machinery in the room is equipped with a dynamo for charging and starting. The following items are equipped as follows: air compressor, cylinder lathe, valve repair machine, nailing machine, grinding machine, whetstone machine, old-style transformer testing machine, motor testing machine, lifting machine, engine repair frame, rear axle frame, hydraulic press, charger, steel workbench, and five large cabinets filled with special tools for repairing new and old-style passenger cars and trucks. It is said that all the tools and machinery are worth more than 20,000 yuan. These are stored specifically for the use of the school and are the same as any Ford repair shop in the world. In China, only this set is the most complete. If a new method is invented, a tool will be sent here for backup.</p>
<p>(3) Practice and Repair: First, each person is given a copy of the Ford parts catalog (printed by Central Wenhe) to familiarize students with the names of the parts, and a book on the essentials of managing the new Ford. On the first and second days, the prepared engines are disassembled in groups to familiarize themselves with the arrangement of each part. Since the students who came here already had considerable preparation, they had a concrete concept after one or two disassemblies. On the third day, a new-style passenger car, which had traveled more than 16,000 miles, was delivered from outside the factory. This was an excellent object for practice and repair. After being placed on the lifting machine, the engine was started, and they were taught the various procedures for testing the engine. Then, it was disassembled part by part. First, the engine part was tested. This engine alone took ten days for detailed inspection and repair. Every part was inspected to within one-thousandth of an inch. If any part was specified to be within three-thousandths of an inch, it had to be repaired, or cast with alloy, or have shims added, or replaced with a new one. All modifications and additions were made in accordance with the prescribed procedures. Even the slightest use of a wrench had to be done with the prescribed type of wrench. No borrowing or swapping was allowed. It was definitely not comparable to using an adjustable wrench as if it were omnipotent. When assembling, in addition to the commonly known wrench screw force, there were many other tools used. In short, the reason for using so many tools was to facilitate assembly, save time and effort, and especially to avoid damaging the parts. It was determined that this car's cylinder car was more than five-thousandths of an inch. The pistons, piston rings, and valves were partially replaced with new ones. Other parts, such as the electrical system's charging, wiring, and generator repair, the ignition system's adjustment, the fuel system's and oil system's inspection, cleaning, and adjustment, and the frame and brakes were all carefully inspected and repaired. All rust was repainted. After three weeks, except for the appearance being inferior to a new car, the internal parts were said by Mr. Yu to be no different from a new car. He also said that sometimes external repairs do not need to be so troublesome or so thorough. However, in a true Ford repair shop, it is not permissible to treat car owners carelessly. After this car left the factory, another car was disassembled and repaired step by step, with all the necessary parts being done in a week, and detailed instructions on the principles, designs, and dimensions were given to ensure proficiency. Any questions were asked during these two weeks. Sometimes, they were listed on a small blackboard. Students would write down important points with a pencil whenever they were mentioned. Therefore, there was no need for a general blackboard lecture style. If you didn't pay attention, you would miss the opportunity to take notes. Mr. Yu did not lecture at a fixed time or place, and he did not want to repeat what he had already said. Therefore, it was necessary to pay attention at all times. Occasionally, a gentle request would be made, and Mr. Yu might repeat himself in a rambling manner.</p>
<p>(4) Testing and Visiting: After the various courses were completed, the students were tasked with inspecting and repairing a truck that was not starting properly, until it started successfully. This was a stage where Mr. Yu deliberately introduced many problems to test the students. When doing so, Mr. Yu would laugh and say that the designated person was responsible for correcting it. This was one of the most interesting parts of the course. The second was a verbal question and answer session. All the repair procedures and verbal regulations that had been taught in the past were asked in turn to each person, one question at a time.</p>
<p>On another day, he spoke about the history of automobiles and the various situations in the Ford factory. I began to understand the greatness of its plans and the beauty of its setup. I couldn't help but be amazed. He also showed Ford's specially made film to teach us how to manage its business and various sales methods. Unfortunately, Ford's factory work was already being shipped to Hankou and I was unable to see the whole picture. In the film I saw, there was also a section where engines flowed out of the launch pad like water, ready for grinding. Tools circled in the air like dancing in the air, ready to be taken. There was no suffering from running around. It is appropriate that in April of this year, its car production reached more than 121,000 units. When I entered the school, Mr. Yu led us to visit the factory's parts storage, which was divided into new and old passenger and freight parts, a carpentry department, a paint thinning department, and a battery manufacturing department. Although the factory staff was not large, it was orderly and clean. On the last day, he also led us to visit the various departments of the Meitong Company, which manages Ford in Shanghai, to verify what we had learned. After the visit, the course ended, and it was time for teachers and friends to say goodbye. Before leaving the factory, each person was given a Ford Service School commemorative badge and a certificate issued by the Ford Company. Although the time was short, there was a reluctance to say goodbye among the teachers and friends. Mr. Yu was very knowledgeable, and although he sometimes used humor and sarcasm, he was always willing to take care of us and explain things in detail, which made it difficult for us to forget his enthusiasm and sincerity. Therefore, one evening, I invited some classmates to have dinner and take pictures at the Great East to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<h3 id="e319">Chahar Province's Road Construction Plan <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Qian</p>
<p>Chahar Province borders Outer Mongolia and is a vital route to Kulun. Its automobile industry has been flourishing. The most notable routes are the Zhangku Line, from Zhangjiakou to Kulun, about 2,700 li long, and the Zhangduo Line, from Zhangjiakou to Duolun, about 600 li long. Because the grasslands are vast and boundless, without mountains or rivers to obstruct them, and with few engineering challenges, even the old Jingzhang Highway (from the old capital Beijing to Zhangjiakou), about 400 li long, which was used by automobiles during military times, has fallen into disrepair due to its parallel route with the PingSui Railway. No cars travel on it now. Since the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), Chahar Province has suffered from severe drought, making relief efforts difficult. In order to provide relief to the disaster victims, the authorities adopted a work-for-relief method, leading to a province-wide road network plan and the formulation of construction methods, which were submitted to the provincial government for record and circulated to all counties for implementation. In the 18th year, the Chahar Construction Department organized survey teams to conduct on-site surveys of important trunk lines. By the autumn of that year, most counties had started construction. By the end of the 19th year, the Yiwu Road, the first phase of the trunk line, had been completed. If road funds are available, it will not be difficult to gradually realize the plan. Recently, ten construction methods for the province have been drafted, demonstrating Chahar Province's commitment to road construction. Two key points of the road network construction methods are detailed below.</p>
<p>Provincial Road Network: According to the plan proposed by the Chahar Construction Department, it is divided into four phases. The first phase consists of trunk roads: (1) the Xuanwei Line, from Xuanhua via Shenjinghua and Shaoying towns to Xiheying in Wei County, 178 li long; (2) the Xuandu Line, from Xuanhua via Longchi counties to Dushi, 270 li long; (3) the Dugu Line, from Dushikou to Guyuan, the first line for entering Mongolia from the interior, 60 li long. The second phase consists of main lines: (1) the Yanghua Line, from Yangyuan County to Huashaoying, connecting with the Yiwei Line, 80 li long; (2) the Xinhua Line, from Huashaoying via Huai'an County, crossing the Chaigoubao of the PingSui Railway, along to Xinpingkou, the second line for entering Mongolian banners from the interior; (3) the Zhuoyuan Line, from Zhuolu to the Xiahuayuan Station of the PingSui Railway, 35 li long; (4) the Kangkang Line, from the Kangzhuang Station of the PingSui Railway to Yanqing County, 40 li long. The third phase consists of two branch lines: (1) the Zhangkang Branch Line, from Zhangbei County to Kangbao County, 200 li long; (2) the Fashang Branch Line, from Fayuan via Baochang and Kangbao counties to Shangqiu County, 450 li long. The fourth phase consists of four branch lines: (1) the Zhuowei Branch Line, from Zhuolu via Taohuabao, Xiheying, and Wei County to Guangling County in Shanxi, 230 li long; (2) the Longhuai Branch Line, from Longguan to Tumu, connecting with the Pinghai Road, 100 li long; (3) the Weixian Branch Line, from Wei County to Yangyuan County, 90 li long; (4) the Yangzhen Branch Line, from Yangyuan to Tianzhen in Shanxi, 90 li long. In general, the total length of automobile roads in Chahar Province is 2,013 li, including 853 li of trunk roads and 1,165 li of branch roads. There are two major rivers within the province, the Sanggan River and the Yang River, so there are six large bridges, requiring significant funding. The estimated construction cost for the province's roads is over 3.61 million yuan. Although the construction is divided into four phases, the completion date is undetermined due to the lack of funding. Only 120,000 yuan of disaster relief funds were used in the 19th year to complete the bridges, culverts, and stonework of the Xuanwei County. There should be several bridges and culverts un-repaired on the road. Construction will continue this spring. This road will soon be open to traffic along the entire line.</p>
<p>Construction Methods: The Jiangsu Construction Department has drafted ten rules for road construction: (1) The standards for the construction of Jiangsu provincial roads. The outline has nine points: A. Road surface width. Trunk roads should be 8 meters or more, and branch roads should be 6 meters or more as the standard. Drainage ditches and tree planting areas should be left 2 meters on each side. The wider, the better, if the land is easy to acquire. In addition to various vehicles, a 5-meter sidewalk should also be planned on both sides. The road surface material should first be a solid and firm sandy soil road. Later, observe the traffic situation and change to a gravel road. The center line of the road should be higher than the two sides of the road. One foot to one and a half feet is the standard. C. Where the route has uneven elevations, it must be filled or dug low. The slope on both sides is set to one foot high. Open one foot or one and a half feet diagonally. It must be determined according to the geology. D. Slope. In rugged mountainous areas, the maximum slope shall not exceed 6%. E. Roadbed construction. It must be laid flat layer by layer. The original shall not exceed eight inches. After one layer is evenly laid, lay the second layer until it reaches a certain height. F. Direction. The direction of the road is most valuable to take a straight and flat line. When it is impossible, bend it to keep it flat. Don't take the largest slope of narrow and shallow roads. G. Curvature. For the convenience and safety of road maintenance and transportation, the minimum radius is limited to 100 meters. H. Ditches. Drainage ditches should be built on both sides of the road. The width of the bottom is one foot, and the slope is one hundred to one. At the foot of the mountain, it depends on the size of the mountain. I. Bridges and culverts. Must be determined according to the size of the water flow. Should be made of cement or wood and stone to take a once-and-for-all plan and avoid driving danger. (2) The surveying of the entire province's road lines and the drafting of bridge and culvert drawings shall be the responsibility of personnel assigned by the Bureau. (3) The cost of repairing bridges and culverts on the province's roads shall be borne by the provincial treasury. (4) The earthwork involved in repairing roads, such as digging and filling soil, shall be the responsibility of all the people of the counties through which the route passes. Villages near the construction site should provide labor, and villages far away should provide money. The distribution of work and the standard for providing money should be discussed and drafted by the county governments in conjunction with various agencies and reported for record. (5) Civilian workers who undertake road construction will only be given food. They may be paid in cash, and the amount shall be determined by each county based on its own circumstances. However, the maximum shall not exceed 20 cents per worker. (6) Civilian workers' tools. Ordinary tools are generally provided by the civilians themselves, except for special tools borrowed from the public. (7) Civilian workers undertaking road construction shall be under the full responsibility of the county government's construction bureau for supervision and engineering. The Bureau shall also send personnel to inspect at any time. In case of difficult and important work, it shall be investigated at any time. (8) The privately owned land to be occupied for the construction of motorways in each county of this province shall be rented permanently in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the promulgated Land Requisition Law. The method will be determined separately. (9) If there are any matters not covered in these measures, they may be submitted to the provincial government for amendment at any time. (10) These measures shall be promulgated and implemented after being approved by the Provincial Government.</p>

<h3 id="e321">Paris as a World Automobile Market <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>Although French people are easily squeezed out by competitors in the world automobile market, their capital, Paris, is often located in the center of the world automobile market.</p>
<p>Since the advent of automobiles, Paris has been at the forefront of the novelty of automobiles because of the organization of automobile exhibitions. This exhibition has been established for more than 25 years. Each meeting is not only a grand celebration of its magnificence and beauty, but also extremely demonstrates its position as the owner in the automobile market. Although foreign automobile manufacturers are well aware of this intention and want to replace it, it is obvious that they cannot. Therefore, for each meeting, they have to attend in person. Therefore, the types of automobiles exhibited at the venue are almost all in the world. This is why the Paris Motor Show is called the World Motor Show. As for automobile exhibitions everywhere, such as London, Berlin, and New York, only the products of automobile manufacturers in those places are displayed. Few foreigners participate. This year's New York Motor Show is the same. Only one French company participated. Looking back at the recent Paris Motor Show, it cannot be mentioned on the same day. The enthusiasm of foreigners to participate is no less than that of the French themselves. The reason is that the psychology of the majority of the audience recognizes Paris as an advanced country in the world automobile industry. Exhibiting each car will definitely be pleasing. Therefore, they do not spare the long journey and join hands to see the world's products of the year to refresh their senses. The custom is like this. Therefore, automobile manufacturers in various countries have no choice but to participate in order to compete for business. Moreover, the cars that are exhibited must be carefully designed. They value it as such. During the exhibition, automobile manufacturers use their skills to sell their factory products to private customers, car dealers, or car sales companies. Even more valuable, the Paris Motor Show can influence automobile manufacturers all over the world. Even if their manufacturing plans have been determined, not determined, or are in progress this year, they must re-determine their manufacturing steps after the exhibition closes to avoid any unsold products. This is why the Paris Motor Show is worthy of being called the world automobile market.</p>

<h3 id="e322">India in National Revolutionary Struggle <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhannong</p>
<p>Translated by Li Enshao and Wu Han</p>
<p>Today, amid the valiant national revolutionary struggle of India and the violent oppression of British imperialism, all who care about the self-determination of the world's small and weak nations丨丨especially those who advocate "uniting the world's small and weak nations in a common struggle"丨丨should have a thorough understanding of India's domestic political trends and diplomatic international relations. The forthcoming book "India in National Revolutionary Struggle" can be regarded as the best reference book for studying India's political situation.</p>
<p>India's national movement originated very early, but influenced by Buddhist scriptures and philosophy and imbued with Islamic theory, the thinking of the Indian people has largely tended towards conservatism and reconciliation. However, having been cleansed by revolutionary theory, the thinking of progressive youth is no less advanced than that of the youth in democratic political countries around the world. Therefore, although the political movement in India, even until this year丨丨1931丨丨on New Year's Day, has not yet achieved the realization of autonomy or independence, their spirit of struggle is vastly different from the time the National Congress was established in 1885. Their spirit of sacrifice, firm will, and sustained struggle have already been admired by Korea and Annam and conquered by imperialists all over the world.</p>
<p>India's vast territory, the differences in religion, people, and language (South Indians do not understand the language of North Indians and even use English as their national language), and the divergence of opinions due to different thoughts and the proliferation of factions, on the surface, it seems that the opinions of various parties, ethnic groups, and religions in India cannot be reconciled, and there is almost no one who does not hold a pessimistic view of India. However, upon careful observation, the future of India's political movement is entirely optimistic because, although their opinions are not consistent, some thoughts are too conservative, and even Gandhi, whom Indians regard as sacred, cannot avoid it, they are all standing on the position of resisting the yoke of British imperialism and striving sincerely for the freedom of India.</p>
<p>China and India are both ancient Eastern countries with many similarities in culture. In today's world, they are both among the countries being invaded. Before the concessions are recovered and the unequal treaties are abolished, China still cannot escape the status of a semi-colony or semi-colonial land. Our national struggle has not yet reached the goal of victory. We have the necessity of contacting and helping India's national revolution and the responsibility of fighting together. There is an urgent need to study India's political situation.</p>
<p>This book is written by William I. Hull Ph. th, Professor of International Relations and Doctor of Philosophy at Swarthmore Collnge. The original name is The Politiiar Crises of India, the latest edition published by Oxford Printing Company in 1930. The book does not divide chapters and sections, but only outlines and explains the process of various events, the attitude of the people, the public opinion of the society, and the countermeasures of the British government in chronological order, from the time of the establishment of the National Congress in 1985 to 1929. Among them, the political concepts of various religions in India, the virtue and spirit of various leaders, and the excitement of young people's thoughts are all expressed in fluent writing, or by borrowing the speeches or declarations of various leaders, the editorials and records of various newspapers, and indirectly and directly describe everything without omission. The main points and disputes of each meeting are especially thoroughly elaborated. The British government's violent acts of oppression are even more vividly portrayed, making it a unprecedented work for studying the Indian national revolution.</p>
<p>Translators Li Enshao and Wu Han have studied society, politics, and economics and are particularly familiar with the political parties and revolutionary histories of various countries. This time, they used their vivid writing to translate Mr. Ho's fluent writing, which made them shine even more brightly. Anyone who has read this book can clearly understand India's national revolution, whether it is the British government's evolutionary policy of aggression or the spirit of the Indian people's struggle for independence. It is specially introduced to the revolutionary readership of our country for reference.</p>

<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>On April 25th, a meeting was held in Sarcus, and an immediate consensus was reached on this point. Commander Bliss also attended the meeting. After detailed discussions, it was decided in principle that in May and June, the American army would first dispatch infantry. The issue of May could be said to be completely resolved at that time. Regarding the issue of June, it was agreed at that time to make concrete decisions later. However, from now on, the Washington government is preparing to transport at least six divisions of infantry to France.</p>
<p>This meeting also highlighted the urgent need for the American army's command and deployment to benefit the Allied forces. The American army's command must be adaptable, and its deployment must avoid individual control. This was agreed upon by General Pershing and Marquis Milner. The April 25th meeting further proved this. In summary, the Allied governments will comprehensively study the strength of the American army in future military matters. All resolutions are generally related to the transportation of the American army.</p>
<p>This was decided at the Cibef Conference on May 1st and 2nd. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The British government will be responsible for providing ships to transport 130,000 American soldiers to France in May and 150,000 in June, all of whom are infantry and machine gun units.</p>
<p>(2) American ships will be used to transport artillery and other troops.</p>
<p>(3) The situation will be studied again in early June to decide on future plans.</p>
<p>This important resolution was successfully achieved thanks to the generous cooperation of British ships. By July 1st, no less than 400,000 American infantry and machine gun troops had been transported to France to fill the void in the British and French armies. At the same time, Commander Pershing used American ships to transport other troops continuously. Because he was able to form an independent American army in France in a short period of time, special interests and the common interests of the Allied countries were taken into account.</p>
<p>If limited to the United States' own capabilities, the American troops transported in March 1918 were only 80,000. In April, there were 93,000. With British assistance, this number surged to 240,000 in May and 280,000 in June.</p>
<p>However, with the arrival of a large American army, other problems arose. The American army did not have time to complete its training in the country, so it had to continue in France. The training problem was easy to solve, but the army's organization and the supply of weapons needed for the new army were quite complicated. To avoid errors, shortages, and delays, close attention must be paid at all times.</p>
<p>My staff specially set up a department in Paris, under the command of the Assistant Chief of Staff, to specialize in collecting and managing various issues related to completing the training of the American army.</p>
<p>The German offensive in Flanders came to an end on May 9th. On the 18th, Commander Mitry was ordered to reduce the strength of his front lines in order to strengthen his reserves, as mentioned earlier. However, the military officer of Kik was also ordered to appropriately reduce the flood defenses to alleviate the inconvenience to residents.</p>
<p>On March 21st, the German bombardment indicated the start of a major battle, preceded by a period of calm, the likes of which had not been seen for a year. What was hidden behind this calm? We knew that the enemy had a large force at his disposal. According to the intelligence department of the General Headquarters, the enemy had 76 to 80 divisions, which was more than he used in the first offensive between the Chemin des Dames and the Arras River. Where would the large enemy army launch its attack? This mystery of the war situation was difficult to unravel.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Haig believed that the Germans were in danger of launching a new offensive between Amiens and the North Sea, with the main target being an attack on Arras or Hazebrouck. Commander Pétain also had the same observation. He was certainly no longer afraid that the enemy would attack in Champagne. Because of the lack of other evidence, he did not believe the prisoners captured on May 19th and 22nd who said that the Germans were preparing to launch a major offensive between the Arras River and Reims.</p>
<p>I do not advocate that the Allied forces' actions should be limited to speculating and discussing the enemy's plans. Another urgent task that we should pay attention to is the preparation of our army to take the offensive. "Only by taking the offensive can our army win. We must strike first to revive our military prestige."</p>
<p>But while our army is busy replenishing its strength, the results of this offensive battle must be commensurate with the sacrifices made. There are two war zones that meet this condition:</p>
<p>(1) The area between the Arras River and the Somme River. This area would allow the French Third and First Armies to jointly attack with the British Second Army, with the goal of relieving the siege of the Paris-Amiens railway line and the transportation hub of Amiens.</p>
<p>(2) The Lys River area. This area could be attacked by the left wing of the British First Army and the northern detachment, with the goal of driving out the enemy that was pressing on Ypres and the Béthune coal mining area.</p>
<p>Having chosen these two operational areas, the Allied forces' offensive plan was issued to the commanders-in-chief on May 20th.</p>
<p>Preparations for the offensive in both places were stepped up at the same time. If the enemy did not attack, the Allied forces' attacks in both places could catch the enemy off guard. If the enemy attacked, our army's attack could also become a valuable counterattack. In terms of troop strength, the first attack, between the Arras River and the Somme River, was certainly the most</p>
